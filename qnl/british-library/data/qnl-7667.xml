My Russian colleague writes me that he has brought to bear all his influence on Sipahdar in vain, and thinks it possible that he will now march on Tehran from InS present quarters at Kazvin, as he professes'dissatisfaction with the Shah’s concessions. I have no direct information as to the Sipahdar’s attitude, but if my Russian colleague is right, a joint remonstrance from the two legations would seem to afford the best chance of bringing about a reconciliation. No. 3. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received May 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 12, 1909. EOR the moment we must await developments here. It is to be hoped that if the present crisis ends in reconciliation Nasr-ul-Mulk will return. Pending his return, Saad-ed-Dowleh will act as Prime Minister. Reference is to your telegram of yesterday. No. 4. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received May 12.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 12, 1909. MY Russian colleague informs me that he has made a second communication to Sipahdar through a secretary of his legation now at Kazvin, pointing out that the Shah has granted all the demands of the Nationalists, and insisting on his checking the revolutionaries’ advance. In Tehran dissatisfaction with the Shah’s concessions is growing. This is, perhaps, more due to a general feeling of mistrust of the Shah than to certain points in the decrees which have provoked criticism. I have no news of effect in the provinces of the Shah’s surrender, excepting from Tabreez and Kazvin. [824] # “ Persia No. 2 (1909),” p. 119, No. 274 BNo. 5. &amp;ir A.

The proposal in your telegram of the 11th instant has the sanction of His Majesty’s Government, and you may make a joint remonstrance with your Russian colleague to the Sipahdar. You should at the same time point out to him that the Nationalists ought certainly to be satisfied with the Shah’s Decrees, and urge him to accept them, and add that, in the event of the Shah trying to evade the fullilment of his pledges and not putting into execution his promises of reforms, the two Representa tives will give His Majesty neither support nor sympathy.

Almost all the bastis have now left the Turkish Embassy, and to-day reconciliation seems more probable. The Shah appears docile, and, so far, the new Cabinet is dealing reasonably with the situation.

As regards the Russian advance, M.

Tcharykoff on the 8th instant that it had been stated that the Russian Government were contemplating the dispatch of troops to guard the Resbt-Tehran road. I expressed the hope that the Russian Govern- [824j 15 ^4 ment would, in any case, at first await the results of a threat to employ military measures, as I was given to understand that the road was for the present open, and the dispatch of a detachment might have the appearance of an intervention. M. Tcharykoff said that he intended to propose that a force should be held in readiness at Baku, and that it should be made known at ^ Besht and along the road that this force would be landed in Persia if the road were interrupted. This morning I received a private letter from his Excellency informing me that it had been decided that “ a sufficient number of Cossacks should be held ready at Baku in case it should be necessary to reinforce the Cossack guard at Besht, and to protect and keep open manu militari the road connecting Tehran with the Caspian. In view, however, of the satisfactory turn which the negotiations of our Bepresentatives with the Shah seem to be taking, we hope that the dispatch of the above-named Cossacks will not be necessary.” I have, &amp;c.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received May 15.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, May 15, 1909._ THE Cabinet has received urgent entreaties this morning from Tabreez, Kazvin, Besht, and Ispahan to secure withdrawal of Bussian troops. Saad-ed-Dowleh tells me that the continued presence of Bussian troops will constitute an obstacle to reconciliation, as the people are possessed with the idea that these troops came in with the consent of the Shah. He thinks that the withdrawal of a large part of the force, leaving 600 men for the town and 400 for the road, would convince the public of the temporary character of Bussian action, and make for reconciliation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs thinks that it would be premature now to ask for the complete withdrawal of Bussian troops, but on the ultimate appointment of a governor to Tabreez his Government will put forward this request. Ijlal-ul-Mulk, a prominent local Mationalist, has, at the request of the Tabreezis, been appointed vice-governor. No. 17. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey^(Rcceired May 16.) (Telegraphic.)

Following is translation of draft communication suggested by Russian Govern ment :— “ Persia for several years past has been a prey to an internal struggle. Animated by feelings of true friendship towards that country, Russia and Great Britain have used all their influence in order to assist in calming the troubles by which she is torn. Their efforts have not been in vain ; quite recently Shah, following advice of the two Governments, has decided to re-establish constitutional regime and to grant to his people a general amnesty for political offences with a view to restoring calm to the country. “ In order to facilitate success of Shah’s efforts to secure peace, the consular representatives of Great Britain and Russia are instructed to appeal to the patriotic sentiments of the spiritual chiefs of the Shiah community, which are well known among Miissulmans of the East, and to influence which they exercise among their co religionists. “ These representatives therefore ask Mujteheds of Kerbela and Nejef to lend their energetic support to this humanitarian object. In exhorting all parties of Persians to abandon fratricidal struggle, and, in giving them wise advice to exercise moderation, the venerable Mujteheds will contribute largely to the happiness of their beautiful country, which has suffered so much from the troubles of recent years, and to the restoration of the order and calm so ardently desired by the Persian people.” * I No. 25. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 24.) SiB ^ . ' Tehran, May 5, 1909. I HAVE kept you fully informed by telegraph of the events following upon the audience of the 22nd ultimo, at which the two Representatives tendered to the Shahthe advice decided upon by His Majesty’s Government and the Russian Government, but for facility of reference it seems desirable that I should now record them as briefly as possible in narrative form. On the day following the audience the Minister for Foreign Affairs, by command of the Shah, visited the two Representatives at the Russian Legation and told them that His Majesty was still disquieted as to the danger of disturbances if he followed the advice of the two Powers. We pointed out that the best security that the Shah could have lay in following the advice we had tendered to him the day before. His Excellency then told us that the Shah needed more than the 100,0001 promised him. We reminded his Excellency that our programme held out hope of more than the 100,0001, and we added that when the Assembly was_ working and the financial administration had been reformed the two Representati\ es would do then best to facilitate a substantial loan to the Persian Government, the need for which was well known to us. ^ On the following morning a Council was held, at which the Shah, his Ministers and others were present, to discuss our programme. Saad-ed-Dowleh visited me in the afternoon to say that he had vigorously urged the acceptance of oui advice, and though he had been strongly opposed by the reactionaries present, he believed the Shah would, in the end, be guided by iiim. On the 25th Saad-ed-Dowleh sent for the two dragomans and expressed the desire to discuss with them the details of the execution of the programme. His Excellency was told that before we could go into details the Shah must officially signify his acceptance of our advice. . . Meanwhile, the news of the impending arrival of Russian troops m Azerbaijan had reached Tehran, and Taki Zade and the local assembly of Tabreez proceeded to use it as leverage in negotiations with the Shah, which resulted on the 25th in the grant of a truce for an indefinite period, facilities for the introduction of food into the town, and on the 26th in an amnesty for all in Tabreez. _ Sittings of the Council of Ministers, with the addition of some of the Shahs unofficial reactionary advisers, were held on the 25th, 26th, and 2/th, at which Saad- ed-Dowleh did his utmost to combat the counsels of reaction. At one of these sittings the project was mooted of publishing an electoral law. This law had been on the eve of he in o* promulgated last ^November, when the artificial demonstiation against the Nationalists, engineered at Bagh-i-Shah by the Court party gave the Shah a pretext for suppressing it. As there was now good reason to believe that the Shah was again about to publish this totally inadequate measure m the hope of escaping from the full execution of our programme, my Russian colleague and 1 informed His Majesty through the Saad-ed-Dowleh that such a step would be incon sistent with our programme, and would in no way improve the situation. We pressed for a definite answer to our representations. ^ 7 n .. . , ^ • On the 29th the Legations learnt that the Shah had dismissed the Grand Vizier and Amir Bahadur Jang from their posts in the Cabinet and appointed his own unc e and father-in-law, Naib-es-Sultaneh, Prime Minister with the portfolio of War. A aib-es- Sultaneh is a reactionary of the most stubborn type, and although he has not been recently a member of the Cabinet, he has had an influence quite as baneful as that of Amir Bahadur Jang. After consultation with my Russian colleague we agreed to inform the Shah in writing, through Saad-ed-Dowleh, that Naib-es-Sultaneh’s presence m the Cabinet was altogether inacceptable. We again pressed for an answer to our represen tations, and warned the Shah that if we had not received one by the 2nd May we should ask for another audience. ^ n i ^ i j -u -i Early next morning we learnt from Saad-ed-Dowleh that he had been summarily dismissed from the Cabinet. Believing this step to be due to the firm stand he had taken during the few days preceding in favour of the Shah’s accepting our programme, and feeling &amp; that his dismissal, coupled with Naib-es-Sultaneh’s appointment was calculated to cast ridicule on the representations of the two Powers we decided to make a strong protest, and we dispatched the two dragomans to Bagh-i-Shah to state to the Shah that unless Naib-es-Sultaneh was at once dismissed and Saad-ed-Dowleh reinstated we should telegraph to our Governments that the measures taken by the Shah showed clearly that His Majesty had rejected our advice. I inclose a Memo randum by Mr. Churchill giving an account of this audience ; you will see that it was made quite clear to His Majesty that the two Powers had no intention to force their advice upon him. He was free to follow it or to reject it, but Saad-ed-Dowleh was indispensable for any reform Cabinet, and therefore his dismissal, if persisted m showed that His Majesty rejected one of the essential parts of our programme. What passed [824] ' ' 48 at this audience evidently made a deep impression, for early next morning Naib-es- Sultaneh sent for Mr. Churchill, and, while protesting that he was not a reactionary, assured him that he would not accept the place in the Cabinet as the two Legations were so strongly opposed to him. On the 4th instant we received a notification that the Under-Secretary of State was for the time directing the affairs of the Ministry, and an hour or two afterwards a communication reached this Legation, in which the Under-Secretary of State stated that the Shah accepted our advice, but desired explanations on certain points of detail which might be given by the representatives to delegates from the Palace at an informal meeting. We have taken act of this communication and asked that an hour may be fixed for the meeting. Meanwhile, notwithstanding the official announcement that the Shah accepts our advice Amir Bahadur Jang, though dismissed from the Ministry of War, still remains at Bagh-i-Shah as commander of the Shah’s body-guard, and Na'ib-es-Sultaneh, against whose appointment to the (Cabinet we had protested, still appears to be officiating as President of the Council and Minister of War. To day on his birthday the Shah has taken a step in the right direction by issuing a rescript promising a constitution. The decree describes the constitutional principle as the best foundation for the security of the people and for the reorganization of the Government and the State, and fixes a date for elections to be held according to an electoral law shortly to be published. Past experience leaves one sceptical as to the Shah’s sincerity of purpose, but the decree is in itself so far satisfactory that it contains nothing incompatible with the execution of the programme of reforms recommended by the two Powers, I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 25, Memorandum by Mr. Churchill. M. BABANOWSKY and I saw the Shah at 7 P.^r., and my Bussian colleague, who acted as spokesman, said “ We apologise for troubling your Majesty at so late an hour, but we are deputed by the British Minister and the Bussian Charge d’Affaires to tell your Majesty that unless you immediately dismiss Na'ib-es-Sultaneh and reinstate Saad-ed-Dowleh the two Bepresentatives wid be compelled, by to-morrow at noon, to telegraph to their Govern ments that your Majesty has taken measures which show clearly that your Majesty has no intention of following the friendly advice of the two Powers.” His Majesty asked by what right such a step would be taken. He had accepted the advice and had acted upon it. How could he be forced to have a Minister for Foreign Affairs who was personally disagreeable to him ? To ^ all these questions M. Baranowsky replied that our instructions were to give His Majesty the above message, and we were not authorized to say any more. The Shah, however, was very persistent, and declared that the two Bepresentatives coiild not telegraph that he refused the advice of the two Powers in the face of his official declaration to the contrary. I said that the proper channel for such a communication to the two Legations was Saad-ed-Dowleh, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Shah said that he would tell the two Bepresentatives, through us—who, he presumed, came m an official capacity that he accepted the advice as laid down in the representations and he had carried out most of its provisions already. He had dismissed Mushir-.es-Sultaneh and Amir Bahadur, he had given an amnesty, and he was preparing an electoral law ; but he found nothing in the representations which justified us in forcing Saad-ed-Dowleh upon him. Naib-es-Sultaneh would not be in the Cabinet, but he was determined not to have Saad-ed-Dowleh. M. Baranowsky said that, in that case, at noon the following day the two Bepre sentatives vvould telegraph accordingly to their two Governments. The Shah said we were using brute force and that he apparently was no lono-er Shah ; that we must choose between himself and Saad-ed-Dowleh. tt* vr^ 0 ^ of saying that the two Governments had no desire to force His Majesty to do anything--that, in fact, such an attitude was very much the reverseof the attitude of the two Governments. His Majesty had been given friendly advice which, if he followed it, would lead to financial assistance on our part. He was, however, quite at liberty to reject the advice and to go his own way. To this His Majesty replied that he would never reject the friendly advice of the two Powers. He had, in fact, accepted it, and would carry it out. All he asked was that they should give in on this small point, as he could not possibly get on with Saad- ed-Dowleh, who was personally distasteful to him and in wPom he had no confidence. M. Baranowsky said that he was mistaken as to Saad-ed-Dowleh, who was, in fact, the only man available who could carry out the programme of reforms on constitutional lines. I added that the choice of a reactionary such as Naib-es-Sultaneh and the dismissal of Saad-ed-Dowdeh proved clearly that His Majesty had no intention of carrying out the advice given to him. He had not as yet signified his acceptance, noi had he properly carried out the provisions, of the programme. The Shah then asked us who were the persons the tw^o Legations had confidence in. To which we replied that when the formal acceptance of His Majesty had reached the two Bepresentatives they would then, and then only, enter into details. M. Baranowsky then reminded the Shah that his Legation had clearly told His Majesty that they would not consent to the dismissal of Saad-ed-Dowleh, but he had taken this step all the same. Now he w^ould have to reverse it, or the two Legations w T ould most certainly telegraph at noon the following day that he had rejected their advice.

His Majesty’s consul-general seems, however, to be still in favour of the appoint ment.

According to the information telegraphed by the Russian consul, an encounter between tv T o bands of Nationalists seems to have taken place. It would appear that a man called Yusuf was at the head of the aggressors, and that this man is said to terrorise the quarter of Tabreez in which the affray occurred. The party which was attacked fled, in the first place, to the vice-governor. He was not in a position to afford them protection, and so they took refuge at the Russian consulate, The vice- governor has been informed by the Russian authorities that as soon as he is ready to receive the arrested men they will be handed over to him. No. 40. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.- '(Received Jane 7.) Sir, Tehran, May 1.1, 1909. CONTINUING my narrative of the events following the presentation of the two Powers’ advice to the Shah on the 22nd ultimo (see my despatch of the 5th May), I have the honour to report that the rescript issued on the Shah’s birthday (oth May) promising a limited constitution, though well received at Tabreez, fell flat at Ispahan and other places, whence it elicited the declaration that the Nationalists would be satisfied with nothing less than the old constitution. At Kazvin, in particular, which had just been taken by a party of revolutionaries from Resht, the rescript failed of its effect, and from accounts which reached this Legation from people who had recently passed through, it seemed probable that as soon as reinforcements, which were constantly arriving, strengthened them sufficiently they would march on Tehran. Outposts had indeed already been thrown out as far as Kevendeh, one stage out on the Tehran road. Rumour in the capital exaggerated the strength of this force, and Bagh-i-Shah was seriously alarmed. It was doubtless due in great part to this, and to fears as to what the Bakhtiaris were about to do from Ispahan, that my Russian colleague and I have found the Shah amenable to reason. People who ought to have known better talked wildly of hundreds of Caucasians who were already almost within striking distance of Tehran. These were obviously cock-and-bull stories, but at the same time I knew the attitude of these men from Resht to be very uncom promising, and it seemed to me quite possible that, even if the Shah adopted our advice in every particular, they would continue to threaten Tehran. The meeting of the two representatives with delegates from the Shah, at whichexplanations on points of detail in our programme of reforms were to be given, took place at this legation on the 7th instant. The composition of the Shah’s delegation : the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Motamin-ul-Mulk, Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, Ala-ul-Mulk, and Heshmet-ed-Dowleh, was such as to aifoid hope that the meeting would have useful results. We opened proceedings by reading to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Moshar-es-Sultan eh, a statement to the effect that unless Saad-ed-Dowleh were immediately reinstated^ as Mnnstei fot Foreign Affairs, and Nasr-ul-Mulk appointed Prime Munster and Minister of Finance, the two Powers would consider that the Shah had definitely rejected their ad\ ice. We then went through the programme point by point. I need not weary you with the explanations we gave in response to all the enquiries addressed to us. The two points which gave most trouble were the advice concerning the grant of a general amnesty and the promise as regards financial assistance. On the first point we found some difficulty in convincing the delegates that the exclusion of certain classes of peisons bom the^ amnesty, those who had committed offences against the common law and acts of brigandage, was not speciallv directed against offenders on the Tvoyalist side. In the end we succeeded in making them understand that the passage regarding these peisons was only inserted in order not to bind the Shah to grant immunity to persons who had used the constitutional movement in order to commit crimes. As regards the question of financial assistance, the delegates seemed suspicious as^ to the intentions of the tv o Governments on account of the phrase, twice repeated, “if it thinks necessary.’ We were able to reassure them in part by telling them that we had both advised 0111 Governments of Persia’s urgent need of money. They complained that no money was at once forthcoming, adding that they could not possibly hope^ for the 100,000/. fiom His Majesty’s Government for many months, for, however expeditiously the programme was executed, the difficulties of travelling were so great in Persia that it must be long before the Assembly could meet. From the wording of the promise regarding the Itussian advance, they feared that the Shah would be precluded from using it for payment of arrears to the troops ; my Itussian colleague replied that he had pointed out to his Government the necessity for the payment of the troops, and added that he had reason to believe that the money was intended for the purpose. The delegates com plained also of the mention of guarantees in connection with the larger loan ot which hopes were held out in the programme, and they asked us to substitute for “ guarantees the word “conditions” ; they said the Assembly would be indignant at being committed to o-uarantees. We pointed out that it was usual for guarantees to be given in such cases, but that the wording really committed them to nothing. It would be open to the Assembly to accept or refuse any loan that the two Governments might see then- way to facilitating, when it knew what guarantees were required. Before the termination of the meeting my Itussian colleague^ and I gave the delegates two lists of persons who, in our opinion, would inspire confidence as membeis respectively of the Cabinet and the committee for the elaboration of the electoral law. In doino- so we made it quite clear that, except as regards Nasr-ul-Mulk and Saad-ed- Howleth the persons named were merely suggested privately as suitable. Fvery eilort was made by the delegates to induce us to withdraw Saad-ed-Dowleh s name. After the conclusion of the meeting we asked the delegates if they felt authorised to convey to the Shah a message which did not, strictly speaking, come within the business arranged, and, on their consent, we begged them to urge upon His Maiesty the pressing need, in view of His Majesty’s precarious position for the immediate publication of a proclamation announcing in unequivocal terms that His Maiesty had already carried out such part of the measures we had recommended as admitted of immediate execution, and was taking the necessary steps for the prompt execution of the remainder. ., . , x . a , Next day (the 8th May) the Shah made a last attempt to avoid reinstating Saad- ed-Dowleh. Emissaries were sent to both legations, who told my Bussian colleague that T no longer insisted on Saad~ed-Dowleh, and informed me that the question was merely a personal one taken up by the Bussian Charge d’Affaires at the instance of his dragoman. It is perhaps needless to say that this very puerile attempt failed. In the afternoon I had an opportunity of telling the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that M. Sabline and t were about to present a joint note fixino- an hour by which certain parts of our programme had to be executed, failina- which we should report the Shah’s definite rejection of the a ^ v ice of the two Powers. Possibly this message, which was no doubt conveyed to the Shah, hastened matters for next morning, the 9th instant, Saad-ed-Dowleh was sent for to the palace, when the Shah requested him to form a Cabinet and gave him complete liberty14 of action to deal with the situation. In the afternoon I called on his Excellency by appointment, when he read to me the draft of a decree for the re-establishment of constitutional government which he was about to submit to the Shah. This decree, which was to be accompanied by another granting a general amnesty, went even further than our advice, as it restored the old constitution, whereas the two representatives have throughout carefully refrained from recommending this precise form of constitu tion, confining themselves in general terms to urging the restoration of a constitutional regime. The two decrees were signed the same evening by the Shah and published yesterday, and translations of both are enclosed herewith, together with a translation of Saad-ed-Dowleh’s note transmitting them to me. The Cabinet formed, in accordance with our advice, is as follows :— Nasr-ul-Mulk. Saad-ed-Dowleh. Farman Farm a. Mnstaufi-ul-Mamalek. Mushir-ed-Dowleh. Motamin-ul-Mulk. Mohandis-ul-Mamalek.

(Translation.) FROM the day that, by the will of Providence, we became the heir apparent of Persia, we always thought that the evils existing in this 6,000-year-old country, which is our beloved home, could not be removed without the co-operation of the nation with the Government, and were constantly in this thought until the Persian nation helped us in this intention, and appealed to our late lamented father for a constitution. Our telegrams and letters addressed to our august father, which still exist, are proofs of our sympathy with the nation. After the grant of the constitution, when we came to Tehran, we took a great deal of trouble in getting it signed by our father. When we came to the throne we exerted every effort for the maintenance of the constitution and the glory of the National Assembly, hut the intrigues of the intriguers, as is known to everyone, made such a bad impression on our mind, and so disappointed us, that we thought the unfortunate proceedings of the Assembly were not calculated toremove the various difficulties in which Persia found herself. We therefore resolved, according to the usage of all countries, to dissolve the Assembly, but when on the 19th of Shavval we wanted to reopen Parliament, the circumstances were such that every wise man thought that it would lead to no other result but bloodshed. For some time we were engaged in removing these obstacles, and now that the time is suitable and the difficulties have been removed, we are glad to ordain, by this rescript, the reopening of Parliament in accordance with that very same constitution without the sho-htest chanu-e. AVe also ordain that a certain number of enlightened Nationalists, who enjoy the confidence of the Government and nation, should be added to the Council of State for the purpose of elaborating an electoral law as soon as possible, and that when ready, elections should begin, and that as soon as two-thnds of the deputies are ready, the National Assembly should be opened in the Bahanstan (t.c., the same place as before).

I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia during the last four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 41. Monthly Summary. Tehran. FROM the 24th to the 27th April councils were held at Bagh-i-Shah to discuss the Anglo-Russian joint representations of the 22nd April. Saad-ed-Dowleh, who on these occasions firmly advocated a complete acceptance of the programme, met with great opposition, and incurred the Shah’s displeasure, which resulted on the 29th in his summary dismissal. The Shah at the same time dismissed the whole Cabinet, including Mushir-es-Sultaneh and Amir Bahadur, and appointed his uncle, Naib-es- Sultaneh. Prime Minister and Minister of War. On the 3()th April the British and Russian legations protested against this appointment, and their two dragomans had an audience of the Shah at which they insisted on the reinstatement of Saad-ed-Dowleh. On the 1st May the Shah sent his private secretary (Heshmet-ed-Dowleh) to inform His Majesty’s' Minister that he accepted the Anglo-Russian programme in principle ; and the form in which the official acceptance was to be drawn up having been agreed to, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs wrote on the 4th May :— “ Je suis autorisb par Sa Majeste Imperiale le Schah if faire savoir aux honorables representants des deux Puissances amies qu’elle accepte les conseils amicaux qui lui out ete transmis au cours de 1’audience du 22 avril . . . . ”The Shah having given orders that a rescript announcing the reintroduction of the constitutional regime should be published the following day (the 5th May), his birthday, an attempt was made by the reactionary court party to organise the usual counter-demon stration. The British and Russian legations therefore sent in a strong joint note declaring that the Shah would be held personally responsible if any disturbance of the peace occurred, and the plan was consequently abandoned. On the 5th May the Corps Diplomatique was received in audience by the Shah, who was looking very well, and wore his priceless emeralds, which showed up very well on a white coat. He also wore a remarkably fine diamond aigrette in his hat. A review of the troops in camp was afterwards held, to witness which a few of the diplomatists remained. The Silakhori irregulars, who had been collected by Amir Bahadur, and have done so much damage of late, were conspicuous, but their commander did not appear. The news of the capture of Kazvin by the Caucasian revolutionaries from Resht, which occurred during the previous night, was received by the Shah a short time before the audience and review. The Shah’s rescript, reintroducing the constitu tional regime, was printed on that day, but though a few copies were obtainable, it was not generally made public. On the 6th May the British and Russian legations took official act of the Shalfs acceptance of the Anglo-Russian programme. During the course of the day 100 Persian Cossacks, under a Russian officer, were sent to Kerej, a place some 30 miles on the road to Kazvin. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs called on His Majesty’s Minister, on behalf of the Shah, to say that Naih-es-Sultaneh was no longer Prime Minister. On the 7th May the Shah’s delegates, six in number, called at His Majesty’s legation to discuss the details of the Anglo-Russian programme with the two repre sentatives. The following day (the 8th May) the Shah sent emissaries to the two legations to make a last appeal against the reinstatement of Saad-ed-Dowleh, but on the 9th May, finding that resistance was no longer possible, and being thoroughly frightened by the presence of the Caucasians at Kazvin, the following Cabinet was formed :— Minister for Foreign Affairs and Acting President of Council Minister of Finance (to be President when he arrives from Europe) Minister of the Interior Minister of War Minister of Justice ... Minister of Education Minister of Telegraphs and Posts ... Minister of Public Works, Roads, Mines, &amp;c. Saad-ed-Dowleh. Nasr-ul-Mulk. Farman Farm a. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek. Musbir-ed-Dowleh. Motamin-ul-Mulk. Mukhber-ed-Dowleb. Mohandis-ul-Mamalek. On the 10th May a proclamation was printed and widely circulated in the Shah’s name announcing the introduction of parliamentary institutions. The old constitution was declared to be re-established and the electoral law was to be elaborated immediately by a committee, and the National Assembly to open as soon as two-thirds of the deputies were in Tehran. At the same time another proclamation was issued granting a general amnesty. On the 11th and 12th May the Council of State met to discuss the electoral law, and twenty members were chosen to form a committee for the purpose of drawing it up. On the 13th and 14th May the refugees who had been at the Turkish embassy for over four months began to leave, and by the 15th had practically all left. On the 14th May a proclamation was issued by the new Cabinet declaring that persons insulting Nationalists or making demonstrations against the constitution would be severely punished, and on the 17th a further proclamation was issued entrusting the Cossack brigade with the work of policing the town. On the same day the Shah moved from Bagh-i-Shah to Sultanetabad, a country palace on the way to his country seat. Order has been maintained throughout in Tehran.The circumstances which led up to the entry of the Russian troops into Tabreez have been reported. On the Russian approach the Royalist forces surrounding the city began to disperse, and early on the 30th April the Russian advance guard, consisting of 180 men, entered without the occurrence of any untoward event, the remainder arriving later in the day. By the 3rd May there were 269 Russian troops iii the town, and General Snarsky told Mr. Wratislaw that he had nearly 4,000 men under his orders. The postal service was resumed on the 1st May, and by the 4th May it was reported that Rahim Khan had left the neighbourhood of Tabreez, not without carrying off a good deal of loot. The Shah’s proclamations of the 10th May ordering measures for the restoration of constitutional government were well received by the Nationalists, who, though they at first professed themselves anxious to receive guarantees for the execution of His Majesty’s promises, on being informed by His Majesty’s consul-general and his Russian colleague that it was now incumbent on them to work for a reconciliation, became reassured, and promised to send delegates to quiet Western Azerbaijan, and subsequently telegraphed to Resht and Ispahan counselling a conciliatory attitude. On the night of the 10th May some shots were fired at a Russian sentry in the neighbourhood of the Russian consulate-general, and he was badly wounded in the arm. The Nationalists raised a sum of 3,000 tomans as an indemnity. Ain-ed- Dowleh left Tabreez for Tehran on the 12th May accompanied by the Persian Cossacks, but the Cossacks have since been instructed to return to Tabreez at the request of the recently appointed vice-governor in order to assist in policing the city. The vice- governor in question is Ijlal-ul-Mulk, a prominent local Nationalist leader, whose appointment two or three days ago has given general satisfaction. Resht. The town has remained quiet during the month, though one Unpopular priest is said to have been murdered by the Nationalists. Kazvhi. On the evening of the 4th May a party of Nationalists from Resht) estimated variously at from 45 to 200 mounted men) entered Kazvin. The explosion of a few bombs and the firing in the air of their rifles by the horsemen was sufficient to make the greater part of the garrison surrender to them. Some fighting, however, took place at the governor’s palace, but by the afternoon of the 5th May the town was in the hands of the Nationalists and order was re-established. The governor appears to have fled before his palace was surrounded. The Shahsevan horsemen, under Sardar Muzaffer, Who formed part of the Shah’s troops, did not stop to fight, but went off on the Zenjan road, where they began to rob travellers. On the way they abandoned their guns, which the Nationalists then seized. Kazim Agha, one of the generals with the Shah’s troops, who was formerly in the Cossack brigade, and distinguished himself in the attack on^ the Assembly on the 23rd June last year, was shot by the Nationalists. Sipahdar arrived from Resht on the 11th May, by which time reinforcements had also come up from Resht. The total Nationalist force at Kazvin appears to be about 1,000 men. Though telegraphic communication with Resht was interrupted for some days, there has been no interference with traffic on the Resht-Tehran road, posts and caravans alike arriving safely and regularly. Meshed. The event of the past month has been the arrival of the Russian troops.^ lour officers) seventy-five Cossacks, and a machine-gun detachment of thirty men with two Maxim guns, arrived on the 26th April, and were received by the Persian general with troops lined up. The Nayer-ed-Dowleh, who had been appointed governor-general, remained at Nishapur, being afraid to go on to Meshed. He has been dismissed, and Rukn-ed-Dowleh has been reappointed, but has not yet left Tehran. A gang of revolutionaries who left Astrabad about the middle of April cut the telegraph line near Miandasht and shot at the Persian telegraph clerk. They again cut the line near Sabzevar, and after seizing three horses left the main road for the side track to Kucham [824] 0IS Turbat-i-IIa iclari. Salar Khan has continued to govern Turbat, and has collected 1,000 tomans of the revenue. He has also collected a certain number of arms from various individuals. On the 4th April Yaver Assadullah defeated Salar Moazziz, the former governor, at Sabukh ; the latter fled. Seistan. It appears that the Meshed local Assembly had instructed the leading priests in Seistan to see that further payments of revenue are suspended. Mollah Mehdi and the deputy governor hoth replied expressing their readiness to suspend further collections. The Karguzar has also been instructed to work in future through the Karguzar at Meshed, who was described as acting on behalf of the “ nation.” Kerman. * Sahib Ekhtiar has been dismissed from the governorship, and Nizam-es-Sultaneh appointed in his place. The latter being in Tehran appointed a committee of four to take charge for him, but of these only one, Eashir-i-Khakan, accepted the charge. He has since found it impossible to act as deputy governor as long as the ex-governor remains at Kerman and continues his intrigues. The Kalentar, who alone had kept the town together, resigned on the 20th April. Yezd. The state of the roads and surrounding country shows no improvement. Many bands of robbers are still active, one in particular in the Rafsinjan district, on the Kerman road, is said to have looted sixteen villages besides several caravans. This band attacked a large camel caravan at Khushkuh, two members of the Indo- European telegraph department’s staff being in the caravanserai at the time. They were, however, able to proceed in safety to Rafsinjan, as the robbers, having taken 400 camels, moved off with their bootv. 7 J Kermanshah. At the end of April the Sinjabi and Guran tribes were reported to he fighting. The news of Russian troops crossing the border, and of British sailors being landed at Bush ire, made a great stir. Captain Haworth and his Russian colleague combined to explain the real motives for their coming. The news of the granting of the constitution was received on the 4th May, and orders were issued for the illumination of the bazaar for one night. The people, however, insisted on keeping up the illumination for three nights. Kama dan. Telegraphing on the 15th May from Hamadan, Captain Haworth reported that the local Nationalists had been instructed by telegraph by Sipahdar to make the same demands from the Shah as he was making. In .view of this, and of the news that Sipahdar is dispatching some horsemen to Hamadan, many people were hanging out the nationalist flag from their houses. Bh 'ira%k Early in April the local Assembly took two steps of importance ! Nasr-ed-Dowleh \\ as sent towards Neniz with 200 infantry and one gun to keep the peace and prevent the nomads destroying the crops east of Shiraa; he was also furnished with an order of the Assembly confirming him in the headship of the Khamseh tribes. The second step was intended to meet the growing scarcity of food which was becoming serious. It was decided by a committee of sixteen that anyone holding stocks of wheat was to be compelled to sell to bakers at 1 kran for lbs. .The Kawam, his principal agent, and the goveinoi-general also supplied three bakers with wheat. The party opposed to the Assembly, wh ch appealed to be gaining strength, had its guns spiked by an invitation from the Assembly to elect two members to sit in the Assembly. Meanwhile the positionof the governor-general was becoming more and more imcomfortable. On the 17th April His Majesty’s consul bad a long conversation with Nasir-ul-Mulk, who is coming steadily to the front as a moderate and sensible man with public experience, and attached neither to the Kawamis nor to the popular interest. He began by frankly admitting that all Persians would prefer a strong Persian administration to any foreign interference, but went on to make a strong plea for English intervention at least, to restore order. He was speaking with unusual frankness, and admitted that his main preoccupation was pecuniary ; and that he, and every other land-owner in Ears, was on the verge of bankruptcy owing to the ravages of the tribes ; that this situation was bound to react on trade, and, if it continued unchecked, to end in famine. He finally put a number of questions about the increase of Russian consular guards, and enquired why no reinforcement was coming to Shiraz; 100 British troops marching up the Bushire road would, he said, be enough of itself to make the tribesmen at least pause in their work of destruction. On being informed that Mr. Bill saw no necessity for the increase of his present escort, he said in a half joking way, “ But would you not if the consulate were to be attacked ? ” It may be worth noting that, although the Shirazis of the better class seem to realise that there is no hope of British intervention, it is quite impossible to prevent them talking about it. On the following evening a laige meeting, attended by the members of the local Assembly and many other prominent persons, was held in Nasir-ul-Mulk’s garden. The proceedings were nominally private, but the governor-general’s vizier, Benan-es-Sultaneh, attended by special invitation, and it was generally understood that important business was to be transacted. I he meeting first arrived at an agreement that, although the form of government now prevailing in Shiraz was in the fullest sense constitutional, still it was established contrary to the will of the Shah, and the members must be prepared to declare them selves hostile to the Shah. This having been generally admitted, Benan-es-Sultaneh was asked, as representing Assaf-ed-Dowleh, whether the latter considered himself as the nominee of the Shah, with whom the Shiraz Assembly was at war, or of the Assembly. Benan-es-Sultaneh asked for time to transmit this very awkward question to the governor. This was granted, and at a meeting^ held ^ on the following day Assef-ed-Dowleh was explicitly asked to explain his position m writing; he must either accept his appointment at the hands of the Assembly and renounce the Shah or he must resign. In the former case he must provide 10,000h, which he might recover from the revenue, and another sum of the same amount wou d be raised, as an advance on their revenue payments, by the land-owners, these sums to be devoted to raising and paying a force to restore order. The urgency ot these demands is explained by the'fact that Assef-ed-Dowleh had been showing unprece dented vigour in the collection of revenue from all land-owners resident in Shiraz, and they naturally wished to make sure of its destination. The governor-general s rep y was not without ingenuity : he declared that he had always been m favoui o e constitution, of which Mohammed Ali Shah was an integral part; that as the constitu ion was now in force in Shiraz he considered himself a constitutional governor, but it t rey insisted on his explicitly renouncing his allegiance to the Shah he must resign. I is reply was written out and read by him to a number of leading persons. It had the etiect, evidently designed by its author, of splitting up the opposition, the more extreme party insisting that it was tantamount to resignation, and the large number who were averse to committing themselves hopelessly declaring that there must be a governor- general, and it was better to have one with some status other than the mere appointment of the Shiraz Assembly. The question of Assef-ed-Dowleh’s remaining as governor was solved on the 24th by an abrupt intimation from Sowlet-ed-Dowleh to the local Assembly that unless Assef-ed-Dowleh was maintained in his position and properly obeyed he would come in himself to Shiraz and compel obedience to the governor- general. He also intimated his disapproval of the arrangement come to with the Kawamis, and of the method of selection of the present Assembly, which he said was quite irregular. He promised his co-operation, however, to a government ot bars whic should consist of a properly constituted local council with Assef-ed-Dowleh as governor- general. This message naturally upset the constitutional apple cart for the momen , and two prominent members of the Assembly left on the same day for Sovdet s camp, as did also a messenger from the Kawam. The latter visited the consulate on tie. &gt; and again enlarged on the difficulty of his position. The object of his visit, he said, was to ask for advice, and especially to call His Majesty’s consul to witness tha i e should be forced by the bitter persona! hostility of the Lari Seyyid to fight against him, it would not only be against his will, but quite independently ot general political20 questions. He was telegraphing in the same sense to Samsam. In reply to his request tor advice, Mr. Bill, after premising that the consulate had no concern whatever with the constitutional question, and that the first interest of everyone in Fars, whether Persian or foreign, was the security of the trade routes, suggested to the Kawam that he and Sowlet-ed-Dowleh were in a position to render a great public service, which would also be of great benefit to himself as a land-owner, if they would unite in joint measures to keep these routes opened and properly policed. Kawam-ul-Mulk replied that he had already sent a messenger to Sowlet with that object, but that Assef-ed- Dowleh was determined to make mischief between them now that he was assured of Sowlet’s support. It was then suggested that a personal interview between the two great men would tend to smooth over difficulties, and that the Imam Jumeh, being a friend of both parties, would be a suitable person to arrange it. It is very much to be hoped that the Sowlet and Kawam may come together, and there is no real obstacle, as both have made it plain enough that they have no real convictions on the constitu tional question, and will readily follow any Government that can maintain itself. Unfortunately, however, there are many persons whose private interest it is to keep them apart, and genuine co-operation between them, in which lies the only hope of public order, is most unlikely. On the 9th April a Parsee visitor to the consulate produced a notice sealed by Seyyid Abdul Husain to all Shirazis, whether Mahomrnedans or not, in which he exhorted the inhabitants of Shiraz to take vengeance on the Kawamis. and finally solemnly warns all persons who have helped the Kawamis with arms or money, especially Parsee merchants, that if anyone does this in future he will be considered, like the Kawamis, as an infidel with arms in his hands, and his blood will be lawful to all Mahommedans. Several telegrams have been received from Bushire by private persons expressing satisfaction at the landing of bluejackets to preserve order, and it seems to be the general expectation of the Shirazis that they were coming there. The state of the road continues bad. There have been more robberies of posts and caravans. On the Ispahan side a series of assaults on telegraph gholams has taken place, making it very difficult to induce them to go out and repair the damage done almost daily by the Arabs, of whom the Jabbara section appear to be no longer under control. Beports of plundering and destruction, especially by Arabs, have come in from all parts. Persian GulB Bunder Abbas-. Oil the 17th March the popular party, as the result of reiterated orders by lettet from Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari, seized the customs and appointed the Karguzar deputy-governor. The Belgian director of customs was given the opportunity of accepting service with the Nationalists, and handing over the receipts or of retiring from his post. He took the latter course and withdrew, being put on board the “ Persepolis ” by a boat from His Majesty’s ship “Fox.” After the customs and the government had been taken over by the Nationalists, the customs stall were sworn on the Koran to work with the Nationalists. Between the 17th and 26th March some 780 riflemen came into the town. They received 2 krans and 2 lbs. of bread daily. By the 22nd a local Assembly of six persons, representing different classes, had been started. The Nationalists prepared trenches along the shore and barricaded the streets in the town in anticipation of having to defend their position. The trenches extended from the town for 2 miles eastward and 1 mile westward. On the 20th March His Majesty’s consul, under orders from His Majesty’s Minister, made a demand for the customs revenue of the port. On the 22nd the Karguzar called on His Majesty’s consul to discuss the demand. He appeared anxious not to quarrel with the British Government. From reports from various sources it appears that the majority of the real population of the town was anxious that any desire of His Majesty’s Government should be met and order maintained in order to secure the good offices of His Majesty’s Government lor the Nationalist cause, but a few Laris and bad characters influenced their councils adversely. On the 22nd news was received from Minab that the Nationalists had peacefully assumed the customs and government there. On the 24th twenty-five riflemen under Ali Mollah Sufi were sent to Minab to keep order there on behalf of the Nationalists. On the 28th March, at the request of His Majesty’s consul, the riflemen in Bunder Abbas were informed that they were no longer required, and all except 350 soondisappeared. They committed no excesses in the town, but are said to have levied heavy toll on the villages, Lingah, On news of the overthrow of the royalist Government at Bushire reaching Lingah on the 25th March, the people of Lingah, both Shiahs and Sunnis, decided to take similar joint action. They approached Sheikh Shubbar, the leading priest, and under his leadership called upon the deputy governor to surrender. The latter, being helpless, surrended, but was reappointed deputy governor on behalf of the Nationalists. The director of customs, an Armenian, was also called upon to surrender, but, being afraid of his life, took refuge in the British agency, where he remained until the 5th April, when, on a written assurance of safety being given him by the deputy governor on behalf of the Nationalists, he was induced to leave the agency and resume his duties as the employd of the Nationalists. Both Shiahs and Sunnis were afraid of people coming from the interior and robbing them, and accordingly put up defensive works outside the town and closed the roads to Bar and Bunder Abbas. The permanent inhabitants of Lingah were very uneasy at the existing state of affairs under the so-called Nationalist domination ; while outwardly fearing to show disapproval of the action of the Laris, of whom they were in terror, they took precautions to prevent Lari riflemen and other bad characters entering Lingah, but they stilly feared that Seyed Abdul Hussein might send riflemen to the port. r ihe occasional visit of a British man- of-war was therefore anxiously looked forward to, and created an intense relief among the people, Mohammerdli, On the 27th March the Sardar Arfa, accompanied by the Karguzar, visited the custom-house and informed the inspector-general of customs that, in order to avoid trouble or attempts by Nationalists to seize any custom-houses in the province, all moneys must be retained in the custom-house. The inspector-general agreed to this, and also to keep the customs steamer “Mmzaffer” at Mohammerah, Supplement to Monthly Summary of May 18, 1909. Fans. The latest news to hand is that Nasr-ed-Dowleh and Ali Kuli Khan, acting in concert, have taken Lar and have decapitated Seyyid Muhammad and Seyyid Jaffar. Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari is said to have been captured. One hundred Laris took refuge at His Majesty’s consulate at Bunder Abbas, demanding intervention to save Lar from Nasr-ed- Dowleh, but left on the same day (the 13th May) on the consul’s promising to telegraph their request to Tehran. On receipt of the news of Nasr-ed-Dowleh’s success reaching Shiraz, the leading Nationalist priest, Haji All Agha, took refuge in His Majesty’s consulate. According to him, Seyyid Abdul Hussein had been killed, and as this had happened after the issue of the amnesty, other leading Nationalists might meet with a similar fate. Later in the day (the 15th May) eight other leading Nationalists took refuge in the consulate, while a large crowd also assembled at the gate, and the bazaars were closed. The governor-general and the Kawam, who declared that Seyyid Abaul Hussein had not been killed, having given a guarantee^ the refugees, Haji Ah Agha and his son excepted, left the consulate the same evening and the ciowd dispersed. On the 17th May the bazaars were still closed. Mr. Bill anticipates that the return of Nasr-ed-Dowleh will be the signal for a riot at Shiraz. He has been instructed to impress on the Nationalists the necessity foiy all parties to work for a reconciliation between the Shah and his people and to avoid disorder.* See Persia No. 2 (1909),” p. 121, No. 281. f Ibid., p. 122, No. 282. OQ No. 42* $ if (7, Barclay to Sir Udicavd Grey.—(Received Jane 7.) Sir, Tehran, May 20, 1909. SINCE my last despatch respecting affairs at Tabreez of the 19th ultimo,* the situation in that town has completely changed, Hostilities have ceased and Tabreez, temporarily in the occupation of Russian troops, is now exerting the influence it possesses in other centres of revolt to bring about a reconciliation between the Shah ‘and his people. It may be convenient that 1 should report as briefly as possible the events leading up to the arrival of Russian troops, which, while it has effectually secured the safety of foreigners—its primary object—has also incidentally saved the Persians of Tabr eez from the horrors which would have followed its surrender to the Shah’s troops, and materially contributed to such measure of success as has so far attended the representations of the two Powers urging His Majesty to restore constitutional government. It will be remembered that when I last wrote provisions in the besieged town were almost exhausted and a request from some of the legations for permission to introduce food for foreigners had been refused by the Persian Government, who suggested that in lieu of this foreign subjects should leave the town under safe- conduct. This was an illusory, not to say derisive, suggestion, as it was well known that the militant Nationalists of Tabreez, fully alive to the value to their cause of the foreigners as hostages, would never willingly permit them to leave. On the 19th ultimo the question of the safety of foreigners became urgent. The two legations learned from the consuls-general that a plan was in contemplation for attacking the two consuhites-general and the houses of their nationals in the hope of forcing Russian occupation in preference to surrendering to the Shah. There was also believed to be imminent danger of the famine-stricken population taking violent measures to obtain food from those foreigners better supplied with provisions than themselves. My Russian colleague and I, though daily expecting instructions to tender the advice to the Shah which it was hoped would relieve the situation at all the centres of revolt, decided that we could not risk the chance of delay, and we accordingly applied for an audience for the following morning, the 20th ultimo, in order to urge the necessity in the interests of the safety of our compatriots at Tabreez for a truce and for permission to introduce provisions. Our representations to His Majesty were, as already reported in my despatch of the 20th April,| successful, and the Shah promised to send orders forthwith to his generals at Tabreez for a cessation of hostilities for six days, during which all facilities were to be given for the introduction of enough food for that period for the whole town. It should here be mentioned that on the previous day His Majesty’s Ambassador at St. Petersburgh had sounded the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether his Government would send the small force of Cossacks to bring away consuls and other foreigners who wished to leave, and on the 20th Sir A. Nicolson reported to His Majesty’s Government that the Russian Government had decided to send a force to labreez with orders to protect the consulates and foreigners, to facilitate the entry of the necessary provisions, and to assist the departure of such foreigners as desired to leave. His Majesty’s Government expressed cordial approval of any steps which the Russian Government might take to save the lives of foreigners from starvation or attack, on the understanding that such steps would not be taken in favour of either side, but solely for the protection of foreigners. The truce granted by the (Shah seemed to render the dispatch of troops no longer urgent and their departure was countermanded with the concurrence of His Majesty’s Government on the news reaching the two Governments of the result of our audience of the 20th ultimo. Owing, however, to circumstances which have never been clearly explained, the Shah’s generals received no orders regarding the armistice and no sufficient facilities were given for the introduction of food. The two consuls-general on 1 earinng that an armistice had been granted had induced the Nationalists to cease hostilities ; consequently the non-observance of the terms of the truce by the Royalist generals rendered their position awkward in the extreme, and the situation seemed more threatening than before. Accordingly, on the 23rcl ultimo, the Russian Government[824] C 4 * See “Persia No. 2 (1909),” p. 120, No. 280. ordered troops to move on Tabreez; the force was instructed to abstain from any inter ference in the struggle between the two parties and to undertake no administrative duties. It was to be withdrawn when the situation had settled down. Mr. Wratislaw and M. Miller, who apprehended danger to Europeans when it was discovered that Russian troops were coming, proposed themselves to inform the Nationalists of then* advent, and were authorised to do so by the two legations, stating that the troops were not coming in the Shah’s interests, but in those of Tabreez, in order to secure the opening of the Julfa road and to protect foreigners and natives from the Shah’s irregulars ; that the occupation was intended to last only until peace was made between the Shah and his people and that no one, whatever his nationality, would be molested for his share in recent events, and that the Shah’s troops would not be admitted^ into the town. Although there was some fanatical agitation against the impending arrival of the troops, the intervention was used to good purpose by the local assembly and Taki Zadeh, who opened negotiations with the Shah’s Government on the evening of the 24th. The Shah was urged to come to terms with his loyal subjects and thus avert the disgrace of a foreign occupation of Persian territory. This leverage was successful, and on the 25th His Majesty granted an armistice for indefinite duration and every facility for the introduction of food. With the experience of the illusory character of the truce previously granted by the Shah to guide them the two consuls-general considered that in the interest of trie security of foreigners it would be unwise to stay the advance of the Russian troops on account of the Shah’s concession. My colleague and I believed this opinion to be sound and we expressed our concurrence. 'The dispatch of the troops was not counterordered, and on the 26th Mr. Wratislaw and M. Miller wrote to the local assembly, giving them full assurances of the temporary character of the Russian action anil explaining its motives. This produced a good effect in Tabreez, and Sattar Khan called on His Majesty’s consul-general on the 29th April to express great gratitude to Great Britain and his hopes for the future. The troops arrived on the 30th April under General Snarsky to the number ot nearly 4,000, of whom some 250 were, in the course of the next day or two, brought into the town without any untoward incident, for the protection of foreigners, I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 43. Sir G, Barclay to Sir E(hoard Grey.—(Received June 7.) Si Tehran, May 20, 1909. AS reported in my despatch of the 16th April,'' it was arranged by the Bakhtiari Khans at Ispahan that their forces should march on Tehran on the 21st ultimo. Sardar Assad had not on that day arrived at Ispahan, and the inability of the Khans to agree among themselves, coupled with their unsuccessful attempt to laise lunds, prevented any move from being made. _ Sardar Assad reached Ispahan on the 6th instant, and the Khans on the 11th instant fed their troops, numbering in all about 3,000 men, to a camp 2 miles outside Ispahan, where they have since remained. Samsam-es-Sultaneh explained that this step was taken in order to prevent disturbances within the city. The continued presence of the Shah’s army at Khaledabad, greatly exaggeiated rumours as to its strength, one version giving the number of men as 8,000, haying been current at Ispahan, has gone far to minimise the effect of the news of the Shah s concessions, and though the local Assembly of Tabreez has telegraphed to that ot Ispahan urging the reception of His Majesty’s promises in a conciliatory spirit, it is not yet known whether the Khans will be willing to compromise. I learn from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that, as a matter of fact, the royalist forces are short of money and forage, and have been ordered to return to Kashan and the neighbouring villages to await further orders. In Ispahan cases of disorder, robbery, and drunkenness became more frequent towards the end of the stay of the Bakhtiari soldiery in the town, while the state of the neighbouring country and roads remains deplorably bad.

IN continuation of my despatch of the 22nd rdtimo,* I have the honour to report that the general situation at Bushire has during the past months undergone little change, and under the auspices of the bluejackets from His Majesty’s ship “ Box ” order has been effectively maintained. Darya Beggi, the new governor, arrived on the 10th instant and was cordially received. The question of the retention of the customs receipts is, as explained to you in my telegram of the 16th instant, satisfactorily settled temporarily, and I shall, when notifying the withdrawal of the bluejackets officially to the Persian Government, convey a verbal warning that the consequences will be disagreeable to the Persian Government if the arrears due to the Imperial Bank of Persia and the monthly instalment are not treated as a first charge. It is to be expected that the bluejackets may be withdrawn within the next few days, the Darya Beggi having assumed complete responsibility for the maintenance of order and the security of foreigners, I have, &amp;e, G. BARCLAY. No. 45. Sir G, Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received June 7.) ^ Tehran, May 20, 1909. Ab far as can be judged from Tehran, the prospects of reconciliation between the Shah and his people, and of His Majesty s being given another chance of ruling as a constitutional Sovereign, are hopeful. His Majesty is apparently giving the Cabinet a nee hand to deal with the crisis ; he will be well advised if lie continues to do so. By Saad-ed-Dowleh’s advice he left the capital on the 18th instant and has taken up his summer quarters at Sultanatabad. So far the Cabinet has shown considerable tact in iandling the situation, and is lending a sympathetic ear to complaints on points on which further concessions are desired by the Nationalists. At first it was not easy to further requirements owing to the difficulties of communication between the different centres^ of revolt and the lack of cohesion amongst the Nationalists of lehran, but a committee of tbe leaders has now been formed at the capital, which the Cabinet has wisely recognized, and which it is hoped will, before long, have authority from the most important provincial centres to speak for the Persian ^Nationalists as a body. It lias already presented a list of desiderata supplementary to what the Sliah has granted on the advice of the two Powers, which has the imprimatur of Sipahdar and labreez. This list is as follows 1. The expulsion of mischief-makers. Amir Bahadur Jang and Mufakher-ul-Mulk are the two persons specially aimed at. The former still remains with the Shah, though \\e ha\e piessed for his removal.^ Saad-ed-Dowleh has asked us to cease our pressure, foi the present at least, and await developments. As his removal from the Palace was not a sine qua non of the programme of reforms, and his influence seems broken for the moment, we have deferred to Saad-ed-Dowleh’s request. Mufakher-ul-Mull i was recently V ice-Gjvernor of Tehran, in which capacity he was believed to have been mainly responsible for the murder of some bastis at Shahabdulazitn some weeks ago. My Kussian colleague and I pressed for bis dismissal, which has since been effected, but he is still at the Court in close touch with the Shah.2. Disarming of the roughs at Tehran. A decree has been issued prohibiting the possession of arms without a permit and the promiscuous letting off of lifles &gt;} t le Shah’s troops and others, which has of late been such a disagreeable feature in 1 ehran. The decree confides the maintenance of order to the Cossack Brigade, so that there is some hope of its being executed. It contains a clause forbidding “ assemblies which create disturbances.” This, I understand, was directed really against reactionary demonstrations, but it has aroused some mistrust among the Nationalists, who see m it an infringement of the right of public meeting. . , . , T 3. A definite pronouncement from the Shah that the old constitution, which he has restored, includes the 107 supplementary articles added in 1907. The decree of the 9th instant was on this point not sufficiently clearly worded. The Shah has already stated that the decree must be interpreted as restoring the old constitution m its entirety, but the Nationalists ask for an explanatory decree on the point. One has been drafted by Saad-ed-Dowleh and submitted to the Shah. ^ 3 . 4. That no further troops be brought to the capital. It is to be hoped that the money now about to be advanced by Kussia will be employed to pay ofi and disband many of the useless troops now under arms. , ,, r ,, '5. That telegrams should no longer be censored. At first Nationalists of the capital wishing to communicate with their fellows in the provinces could have no confidence that their telegrams would be correctly transmitted. They have obtained satisfaction on this point, and the different nationalist centres can now communicate freely with each other. . . ^ . .• - 6. That the Shah should do his best to end the Russian occupation m the north.' There is, no doubt, strong feeling against the Russian occupation among the Nationalists, who cannot get rid of the conviction that the presence of Russian tioops is welcome to the Shah. They choose to forget that Tabreez was m extremis and was only saved from the horrors which must have followed surrender to the Shah s troops by the arrival of the Russian force. As I telegraphed on the 15th instant, Saad-ed- Dowleh while thinking that complete evacuation would be^ premature at present, is o± opinion that the withdrawal of a large part of the force might take place at mice and would quiet the popular agitation against the occupation I have acquainted my Russian colleague with Saad-ed-Dowleh’s remarks to me on this subject. M. Sablme told me that Saad-ed-Dowleh had not approached him on the matter. It has been so unequivocally announced by the Russian Government that the occupation is merely temporary, and for specific and entirelydegitimate objects, that one might have thought the Nationalists, who have certainly been the gainers by this intervention, could afford to be patient. t • x* i ii i • c n m 7 That the mujteheds of Kerbela and Nejef should be informed that the constitution had been restored. This, I understand, has already been done by the Shah mnse^ liberation of Nationalists imprisoned at Tiflis. My Russian colleague, who knows nothing of this, has telegraphed to the Viceroy yf the Caucasus. 9. Assurances to refugees, and their participation m the preparation of the electoial law. This has now been abandoned. There was no need for the first in view ot the general amnesty proclaimed, and the committee working at the electoral law is making g 0 °dio° Af^er the fulfilment ot the above conditions, general illuminations in Tehran and the provinces. All the above points, with the exception of that relating to the continued presence of Amir Bahadur Jang at the Court, lie outside of our advice, so that my Russian colleague and I have not supported this list of desiderata. The response it has received from the Cabinet is due to no pressure from us, and argues an earnest desire on the pait of the Ministers to bring about a reconciliation. . 01 ,i My Russian colleague and I, on the publication of the Shah s decree on the 10th instant, instructed our consuls at the centres of revolt to urge upon the Nationalists that, now that the Shah had _ made ^concessions winch ought to satisfy them, it was their duty to work for pacification. Except for this, I have confined my interference to giving similar advice to the Nationalists of Tehran, and to pressing upon Saad-ed-Dowleh the desirability of recognizing the newly-formed nationalist committee of the capital as the best channel of negotiations, and especially for obtaining some definite idea of what Nationalists as a body desire in addition to what the Shah has eE My^Russian colleague’s influence has been employed principally with the Sipahdar,to whom he lias used the strongest Janguage. Unfortunately, however, the Sipahdar seems to be entirely in the hands of the four hundred odd Caucasians who are with him. It is satisfactory, however, to know that the desiderata above enumerated have been approved at Kazvim It would seem to show that Sipahdar and the force with him are not so uncompromisingly resolved to depose the Shah as has been generally believed at Tehran. They are, however, very insistent, and when I saw Saad-ed-Dowleh yesterdav afternoon he told me that Sipahdar had demanded an immediate answer to the desiderata. It may seem strange that the possibility of a march on Tehran of the 400 Caucasians and the Persians who are with them should loom so large in the situation, but they are known to be determined men, and they would no doubt, in any conflict with the Shah s tatterdemalion troops in Tehran, be able to give a good account of themselves. The Cossacks—the only respectable force in the capital—are far from being at full strength at the present moment, Till the Kazvin force is satisfied or disposed of the situation will not clear, I have, &amp;e.

M. Tcharykoif said that they must await the appointment of a governor, though they were most anxious to recall the troops, as their sojourn in Tabreez cost money. M. 1 charykoff said that he would like to tell me that after six weeks’ silence the Russian Government had received a telegram from Urumia, which depicted the situation as one of complete anarchy. The anti-nationalist party had driven out the nationalist governor, wlio had fled to a distance of some 12 to 15 miles, but had announced his intention of shortlyreturning and wreaking vengeance on his rivals. The Russian consular guard consisted of onl^y six men, and the Government considered it, therefore, prudent to reinforce it by a detachment of forty men, who would be dispatched from labreez. It would be necessary to transport them across the lake, and as the ciafts available were not fitted to carry horses the detachment would have to consist of foot soldiers. I have, Ac. A. NICOLSON.

His Excellency stated that Sardar Assad had been in correspondence with the nationalists at Kazvin and was now marching to Tehran at the head of a large force, nominally to compel the Government to put the constitution into force, although the latter have begun to carry out the Anglo-Russian programme without any loss of time. Saad-ed-Dowleh added that the reason of his visit was that the Shah^ wished me to be informed that the patience of the Government was exhausted and it had been decided to dispatch Amir Mufakham, the Bakhtiari chief, who was royalist, to summon his followers and offer a resistance to the Sardar’s advance. this would amount to the reopening of civil war, and I therefore deprecated it, while advocating the adoption of conciliatory measures. His Excellency replied that, as regards my suggestion that conciliatory measures should be adopted by Amir Mufakbam, such a course would be to no purpose, but that the Government would wait two days before taking action, if I could discover any way of stopping the advance of Sardar Assad. My answer to this was that I could do nothing unless I received instructions from you. I venture to suggest that the British and Russian consuls-general at Ispahan should be instructed to overtake him and to inform him that the two Governments advise him most seriously to return to Ispahan and abandon the demonstration. My private advice to Saad-ed-Dowleh was to get the new electoral law promulgated without a moment s delay. When it was shown to the provinces, it called forth, it is true, criticism from the nationalists at Tabreez, but in spite of that it is a measure of a most democratic nature. I pointed out to Saad-ed-Dowleh that it was hopeless to expect to satisfy all sections of the community, that the electoral law had been drafted by an able committee, and that in the Anglo-Russian programme there was no stipulation that it should be submitted to the provinces.

M.

The objects of such an expedition would be to keep entire control of the road to Tehran without proceeding to an occupation of Tehran, to which latter step he said that the Russian Government were most averse. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs showed me a telegram from the Russian charge d’affaires, in which the situation at Tehran is described as alarming. In this telegram M.

In reply to my question as to what were the exact dangers to be apprehended in the event of the advance of the Bakhtiaris, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs said that there was the danger of the Russian bank being plundered, in addition to that which foreign subjects and missions would incur. The force which it is contemplated sending amounts to about 1,500 men. The expedition, M.

He informed us that it had always been his wish to see a constitutional Govern ment established in the kingdom, even though the nation suffered from ignorance. He had carefully considered the advice which had been given him by the British and. Russian Governments, and had in consequence restored the previous constitution. He had agreed to the whole of the Anglo-Russian programme, and had called upon S;iad- ed-Dowleh to put its various points into execution. There were people, however, wdio maintained that the views of his Excellency were those of an absolutist, that the constitution was neither more nor less than a fraud, and who had prevented the [824] D 236 electoral law from being published at the very last moment when it had already received His Majesty’s signature. The capital had now summoned the provinces to supply forces, and these were already on the march hither, although he had been given to understand by us that all his difficulties would be removed if he carried out the joint programme. He had made a reduction of 7,000 men in his troops, but now with only 5,000 (instead of 12,000) he would fight to the bitter end. His object in summoning us that afternoon was that he might consult us on the situation. In replying to His Majesty’s observations I pointed out that it was now many months since the two legations had tendered him advice of a similar nature ; it was not until May, however, that he made up his mind to act on it, and in the meantime unfortunately the situation had got beyond control—the crisis now was most serious. Although at the time it had seemed to us that His Majesty’s best chance of success lay in faithfully carrying out our proposals, yet the situation had become so critical that we were no longer in a position to say that it would succeed. In reminding His Majesty that we had assured him of our support and sympathy, provided that, and so long as, his rule was that of a constitutional monarch, I pointed out that lie had proof of our support and sympathy quite recently in our endeavours, which unfortunately had failed, to stop the advance of Sardar Assad and the Sipahdar. I here observed that as for the former, he had not even stated what it was that he demanded. Saad-ed-Dowleh hereupon interposed with the remark that Sardar Assad demanded (l) that Tabreez should be evacuated ; and (2) that certain ministers and other personages should be expelled. The Shah exclaimed that the Fedais’ real objects were of a different nature, their demands as above mentioned being merely a cloak. I and the Russian charge d’affaires informed His Majesty that, although we could at present give no other counsel, he might rest assured that we should, if an opportunity occurred, use our influence to bring about a settlement of the difficulty by peaceful means. Tabreez was not mentioned by the Shah. His Majesty entered upon no discussion and bore himself with considerable dignity; the audience was, however, none the less painful on that account. No. 82.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 5 .) Gulahek, May 24, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith copy of an interesting despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Tabreez regarding the final stages of the investment of that town. In doing so, I venture to record my high appreciation of the assistance which His Majesty’s consul-geneial has rendered me since his return to Tabreez in the discharge of my duties at this post, and to express the hope that the manner in which he has conducted the affairs ofhis consulate-general during the past trying months will be held to merit the entire approval of His Majesty’s Government. I should add that my Kussian colleague informs me that the Russian acting consul- general has written to him in high terms of appreciation of the loyal manner in which Mr. Wratislaw has co-operated with him during the recent crisis. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in Ho. 87. Consul-General Wratislaw to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, Tabreez, May 2, 1909. I HAVE the honour to submit the following remarks on the final stages of the investment of Tabreez. Although the sufferings of the population were daily increasing and the store of grain in the ark was rapidly dwindling, it was not until towards the end of March that the nationalists seem to have had any idea that their position was at all critical. It was then decided that a sortie en masse should be directed against the royalist positions near the village of Barinch, whither their head-quarters had been removed from Basminch. This took place on the 24th March and had no material result. A small band of about twenty determined men, including several Caucasian Christians, carried one royalist position by assault, losing eight killed and wounded in the effort; but Bagher Khan, who commanded in that direction, left them unsupported while he and his men remained idle in their trenches. A mob of armed townspeople went as far as the advanced nationalist positions, suffering some losses from the fire of the royalist artillery, but they did not summon up courage to deliver an assault. Further feeble sorties took place on the 28th and 29th March, but it was by this time plain that the nationalists were quite unable to take the offensive successfully against the far superior royalist forces which surrounded them. The royalist artillery at Barinch had hitherto fired exclusively against the nationalist defences at or near Khiaban, but on the 4th they dropped shells indiscri minately into the town, killing and wounding several non-combatants and doing some injury to buildings. On the 8th April the foreign consuls telegraphed to their respective legations asking that a supply of flour should be sent in for the use of the foreign subjects in the town. Little hope was felt that the Shah would accede to this request, and as a matter of fact nothing came of it. Many foreigners were now hard pressed for food, and there was special difficulty in feeding their servants whom the patriarchal relations existing between master and man in Persia bound them to provide for. By this time quite three- quarters of the bakers’ shops were closed permanently, meat was very bad and procured wfith difficulty even by those with money to pay for it, while very few luxuries were obtainable. Strong hopes of a favourable settlement with the Shah were raised by a telegram from His Majesty to Sikkat-el-Islam, the only Mujtehed remaining in Tabreez, who had begged the Shah to consider the sufferings of his people, and grant them the constitution they required. The Shah’s reply was couched in cordial if vague terms, and acting on it Sikkat-el-Islam proceeded on the 10th April to Basminch with the consent of the Anjuman, though not as their accredited agent. His mission was a failure, and produced intense disappointment, but for tfie on iment-it effected -ar-s-ligh-t-Ia-il in--prices generally, as persons who had secreted grain and other provisions brought out their stores for sale,On the 15th a party of Kurds from Samad Khan’s camp raided past the Aji bridge. They were attacked by Sattar Khan’s men, and two were killed. At the same time the Barinch artillery again bombarded the town promiscuously, a couple of shells falling close to the Anjuman’s place of meeting, which is near the European quarter. Next day I received a private visit from one of the leading members of the Anjuman, who informed me that the game was up, and that the only hope for Tabreez lay in the intervention of Great Britain and Russia. Even while speaking frankly on. other points, he could not tell me the truth regarding the food question, and assured me that there was still grain enough in the ark to last for three weeks at the present reduced rate of distribution. 1 asked him whether in view of the difficulty in providing food it would not be possible to allow those of the foreign subjects who wished it to leave the town, but he replied that it could not be thought of. On the following day I, in common with my colleagues, received a letter from the Anjuman, drawing our attention to the shortness of food in the town and the difficulty in feeding foreigners and natives alike, and calling on us to do something to remedy this state of things. Later in the day M. Miller, the acting Russian consul-general, and I were invited to visit the Anjuman to discuss the question. We found all the members there, as well as Ijlal-ul-Mulk, the nominal Governor of the town, who acted as spokesman. He said that they had requested us to come in order that they might put before us the very serious situation, and beg us to do something to avert the danger wdiich lay before us all. The supply of grain, he said, was all but exhausted ; the great majority of the population of over 200,000 souls were starving ; and they feared that it would not be possible much longer to hold them in check. They might break out at any moment into rioting and pillaging of the houses, in which they hoped to find a supply of food. At this point one member of the Anjuman, a mollah, broke in with a statement to the effect that the mob would be no respecter of persons, and that there was no doubt as to who would have to bear the brunt of any disturbance. He said this in a manner which left no doubt that the foreign residents were meant. Only one other member, however, at all supported him, and the rest made him stop. We replied that we were just as anxious to end a very trying situation as anyone else, only we did not exactly see what could be done. If they wmuld make some suggestion, we w'ould consider the possibility of carrying it out. Ijlal-ul-Mulk replied that what they wanted was an armistice, during which the Basminch (Tehran) road should be opened and provisions allowed to enter the town. Advantage would be taken of it to enter into negotiations with the Shah with a view to peace, for which purpose they would choose delegates, and they would at the same time communicate with the nationalists in other towns. After some discussion they came to the conclusion that 150 kharvars of wheat was the daily allowance for the town under normal circumstances, and they undertook that if this quantity were allowed into the town daily while the armistice lasted none of it should be diverted to combatants, who for the rest had still a sufficient supply in the hands of Sattar and Bagher. These proposals they asked us to submit to the British and Russian legations, begging your Excellencies on their behalf to urge their acceptance on the Shah, and at the same time to assure His Majesty that the people of Azerbaijan were only fighting for their constitution and not in any way against him personally. We agreed to do as they requested, but we pointed out that such terms were not likely to be accepted considering the straits to which the town was known to be reduced, and we suggested that they might have some alternative proposition to make— meaning that they might wish us to act on their behalf with a view to obtaining a favourable capitulation. They replied, however, that there was nothing else. Bread was very short next day ; indeed only a favoured few apart from the soldiery could obtain any at all. The day after hardly any bakers’ shops were open, and crowds of women assembled in various parts of the town and had to be dispersed by force. This was rather an ominous sign, as women are always pushed forwards to start bread riots. On the 19tti again they gathered in great numbers at a shrine, from whence they were dislodged after some difficulty by the persuasive eloquence of a mollah especially told off for the purpose. The same day I received information that the plan of attacking foreign consulates and houses, of which I had previously received warning, was again mooted. On receipt of your Excellency’s telegram of the 19th April, I addressed a letter to the Anjuman informing them that your general representations to the Shah would be made on the morrovt. This I believe to have had a calming effect. The' same day I informed the British subjects that, in view of the reports [824] ’ D T40 circulating ol danger to foreigners, any of them who wished could at any time take up their quarters in the consulate. None of them cared to accept for the moment, though they had been rather disquieted about their situation for several days past; hut later in the day they addressed a telegram to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, in which they stated that they were in imminent danger and that the consulate guard was insufficient lor their protection. The Russian subjects were in a state of panic, and crowded into the Russian consulate and neighbouring houses. All the valuables from the Russian Bank were deposited in the consulate, which M. Miller placed in a state of defence. The houses of foreign subjects might easily, had not circumstances altered in time, have been pillaged by the mob, as well as the dwellings of the richer Persians. A forlorn hope in the shape of an assault on Samad Khan’s positions round Karamalek had been arranged for the night of the 19th-20th April. Owing to the inevitable procrastination of the nationalist leaders it did not take place till dawn on the 20th, and, as the royalists had as usual timely information of what was intended and were fully prepared, it had no chance of success. There Avere two assaulting parties, led respectively by Mr. Moore, correspondent of the “ Daily News,” and Mr Baskerville, a teacher in the American Mission school, who had joined the nationalists. Both of these gentlemen behaved with the greatest pluck, but their men failed to support them and they reached the royalist positions with only the merest handful of followers. Mr. Baskerville was shot dead, but Mr. Moore escaped unhurt. Firing continued till late in the afternoon, though the failure of the assault was assured early in the day. The nationalists lost about twenty killed and wounded. At about 4 in the afternoon I received your Excellency’s telegram informing me that the Shah had granted a six days’ armistice, during which provisions were to be allowed into the town. M. Miller, having received a similar telegram from the Russian legation, we at once proceeded to the Anjuman and communicated the news. We requested them at once to obtain a cessation of hostilities, which was immediately done, and to take measures for the strict observance of the armistice on the nationalist side. We informed them that we proposed to send representatives to Ain-ed-Dowleh to press the sending of provisions, and we urged them at once to write to him announcing their intention of choosing delegates to treat for peace. Mr. Vice-Consul Stevens went to Basminch as my delegate, and M. Nazarbegoff, the Russian tajir bashi, represented my Russian colleague. They carried a letter from the Anjuman, as well as one from us jointly, in which we informed Ain-ed-Dowleh of the Shah’s orders concerning an armistice, and requested him to co-operate with our delegates in ensuring the entry of an immediate supply of provisions. In the evening of the next day we received word from our delegates at Basminch that Ain-ed-Dowleh denied having received any orders whatever from the Shah regarding armistice or provisions, but that they had persuaded him to open the Basminch road on the strength of our assurances. They further stated that though the telegraph line from Tehran to Basminch had been working ail the previous day, it was reported on the morning of the 21st to be interrupted. At midday on the 22nd ljlal-el-Mu!k informed us that the troops of Samad Khan had occupied Khatib, and asked us what was to be done. We replied that if the royalists did not observe the armistice the nationalists must naturally defend them selves. Later in the day the royalists retired after some firing. They did not actually occupy the nationalist post at Khatib, though they came very near it. In the afternoon news came in that a consignment of some 25 kharvars of grain, sent by a private person at Basminch, with Ain-ed Dowleh’s permission, as a present to the poor of Tabreez, had been turned back by the Shah’s generals, who declared that they had no instructions to allow provisions into Tabreez, and would not obey them if they had. They had not, they said, been suffering all sorts of privations for months past in order to see their prey escape them at the last moment. This was subsequently confirmed by our delegates, who also informed us that there had been an angry scene between the royalist general and Ain-ed-Dowleh, and that the latter had threatened to take himself off to Tehran, as no one obeyed his orders. Ain-ed-Dowleh, in a subsequent letter to us, referred to the disobedience of the royalist commanders. On the 23rd my Russian colleague was informed by his Government that a force of Russian troops was ordered to Tabreez, and we accordingly acquainted the Anjuman. In general, the coming of the Russians was looked on as the only way in which Tabreez could be saved. The town was now in the last extremity, many of the poorer classes lying exhausted in the streets, and few of them finding any food but green-stuffs.On the 24th the Anjuman entered into direct communication with the Shah, and it having become known that some Russian troops had already crossed the frontier, His Majesty on the 25th telegraphed precise orders to Ain-ed-Dowleh and the royalist generals to cease hostilities, open the roads, and send provisions into Tabreez. The telegrams were at once sent out to Basminch, and reached Ain-ed-Dowleh the same evening. On the Shah’s telegram reaching Tabreez, a deputation from the Anjuman called on us to ask whether the Russian troops could not be kept back for a few days, in order to see if the Shah was this time serious in his goorl intentions, but the manner of the petitioners did not lead us to think that they made a great point of their request being granted. We replied that we would report their desire, but that the matter had now passed entirely out of our hands. For the next two or three days, until provisions came in in quantities, great scarcity continued to prevail, and no bread whatever was baked, but the Shah’s orders were obeyed with satisfactory promptitude, and things soon began to right themselves. I have, &amp;c, A. C. WRATISLAW. No. 88. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 5.) Sir, Gulahek, June 16, 1909. THE course of events during the past four weeks has presented no very noteworthy developments. Good progress has been made in the execution of our programme for the restoration of constitutional government, and there is good reason to hope that in the course of the next few clays an electoral law, which should satisfy the most exacting Nationalists, framed by the committee formed for the purpose, will be promulgated, and a date fixed for the elections for the Assembly. There have been dissensions in the Cabinet due generally to the mistrust felt for Saad-ed-Dowleh, and in particular the jealousy between him and Farman Farma, Minister of the Interior. It was realised at the time the two legations suggested its composition that it would be difficult for some of its members to agree. A more harmonious Cabinet might have been got together, but it would have lacked any element of strength or courage, and it is these elements embodied in Saad-ed-Dowleh which have enabled the present Ministry so far to superintend, not unsuccessfully, the execution of the programme which it is hoped will, before long, lead to the assembling of Parliament. It is unfortunate that Nasr-ul-Mulk has not been available at this juncture. Had he been able to take up his post as President of the Council he would have gained for the Cabinet the confidence of the Nationalists, who, despite the progress which has been made towards the re-establishment of parliamentary government, cannot bring themselves to believe that any good can really come of a Ministry controlled by Saad-ed-Dowleh, and yet the two measures of Saad-ed-Dowleh’s to which most objection is made by the Nationalists were, I think, sound. The placing of the policing of Tehran in the hands of the Cossack Brigade under Colonel Liakhoff was certainly a wise measure. It had my entire approval, and has resulted in a notable improve ment in the state of public security in the capital. The appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh Avas made in the interest of order, and it remains to be seen Avhether the view of the two consuls-general is not correct, i.e., that the appointment is in Tabreez only unpopular among a noisy section of the inhabitants. Taking stock to-day of the results of the execution of the programme of the two Powers, so far as it has yet gone, we find that it has not yet produced any great amelioration of the general situation. It is true that the reactionary clique which surrounds the Shah, and whose activity Avas a source of constant terror to the Nationalists of the capital, is now no longer in evidence. Amir Bahadur Jang has, indeed, formally announced to the leading Nationalists that he has followed the example of his Sovereign and himself become a constitutionalist. It is also true that the danger of a march on Tehran by the Bakhtiaris from Ispahan and by the revolu tionaries from Kazvin has not materialised, but though Samsam-es-Sultaneh had at one time disbanded a large part of his force, a number of his men have now been recalled to Ispahan owing to the continued presence of the Shah’s troops at Kashan, avIio cannot be Avithdra\ATi or disbanded, for want of funds ; and though42 a number of the Kazvin revolutionaries have left for the north, Sipahdar, not withstanding that the Government have appointed him governor of Ghilan and Mazanderan, and that the newly appointed governor of Kazvin has arrived at his post, still stays in Kazvin or its neighbourhood with a good number of followers under arms. This force continues to be in some degree a menace to the capital, and with the suspicions felt as regards every act of Saad-ed-Dowleh, and with the deep-seated distrust of which the Shah is the object, it will be difficult to induce it to disarm. Of other towns which are prominent centres of the Nationalist movement, or where the state of public order has of late given cause for anxiety, Bushire and Bunder Abbas alone, under the strong hand of Darya Beggi, have returned to normal conditions. For the rest, Resht is still in the hands of the Nationalist Committee, while Sipahdar, as mentioned above, remains at, or near, Kazvin. Meshed is reported to be in a state of complete anarchy, and the same maybe said of Kerman, and in a less degree of Yezd. Shiraz, which under the incompetent rule of Assef-ed-Dowleh, is a prey to the rivalry of local factions, seems to be perpetually on the verge of disorders. The state of the roads in the south could not be worse, though the Bakhtiari route is a conspicuous exception, with the result that it is favoured by traders, to the serious loss of Bushire, where the custom receipts have dwindled almost to vanishing point. In the north Tabreez remains in the occupation of the Russian troops, though it is intended to withdraw a considerable portion of these at an early date In the rest of Azerbaijan the situation is as bad as can be. Near Ardebil the Shahsevans are plundering the villages, and the Russian consular escort is being increased. In the north-west the meagre reports which I receive suffice to show that the district is in a state of chaos. It was, of course, never expected that the chaos in Persia would at once give place to order on the restoration of the constitution. What was expected was that it would produce a detente, and that expectation has been fulfilled. It remains to be seen whether the coming constitutional government will ba able to quiet the forces of disorder which have gained such strength during the late corrupt and impotent regime. If it conducts itself reasonably, and, in particular, it shows a desire and sets to work sensibly to reorganise the financial administration, I presume that the Powers will facilitate for it adequate pecuniary assistance. It should then have within its reach funds, which the present Ministry totally lacks, but which are absolutely necessary if the Government is to make any serious attempt to grapple with the prevailing chaos. All the present Cabinet can do in its desperate financial straits is to select the best men available as provincial governors, and trust to them to improve matters by their influence. The 100,000L which Russia is about to advance will be employed to pay off a number of unnecessary troops and to meet urgent arrears. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 89. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 5.) Sir, ^ Gidahek, June 17, 1909. THE electoral law was completed by the committee of twenty persons chosen to elaborate it on the 10th instant, and w^as presented to the Shah on the 13th, but has not yet received His Majesty’s approval. The persons chieflv responsible for the measure are Mushir-ed-Dowleh, Motamin- ul-Mulk, Sani-ed-Dowleh, Farman Farma, Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab, and Mustashar-ed- Dowleh. The new law provides for 120 members of Parliament, in place of 156 decreed by the law of the 8 th September, 1906. Elections which in 1906 were direct and on a class basis are now indirect, and the class basis has disappeared. The electors are to choose three times the number of persons eventually to represent them in Parliament, and the College of Electors thereby formed will elect one-third of their number by vote to go to the House. Each province is divided into electoral districts, with a specified number of representatives to be chosen by the inhabitants of that district qualified to vote.- Those chosen in this manner will meet in the capital of the province, and in their turn choose from among themselves those to be sent to Parliament. Although it is stipulated that the deputies need not necessarily be natives of the province electing thenq they must be on the spot to be elected in the first instance, but when vacancies occur through deathor resignation they may be filled by persons, not necessarily natives of the province they represent, to be elected by the National Assembly itself. In this way by degrees it will be possible to have a majority of persons from Tehran or Tabreez in the Assembly. Elections are to begin at Tehran ten days after the regulations have received the Shah s approval, and in the provinces five days after their receipt. The qualifications for the electorate are of the usual kind as to age, sex, &amp;c., and include provision for a certain stake in the land. The deputies are not required to have any fixed means, but the usual qualifications are laid down as in the last electoral law. The National Assembly is to open as soon as one-third of the deputies are present, and they are elected for a term of two years, which period will begin when Parliament opens. The question of salary of the deputies is left to the Assembly to decide upon when it meets. Travelling expenses for the deputies from the provinces to the capital and back are provided for. Elaborate regulations are laid down for the procedure to be observed at the elections, which are to be supervised by a committee including the provincial authorities and local councils provided for in the constitution of the 7th October, 1907 (articles 90 to 93). Ihe electors are to obtain from the central committee electoral vouchers, entitling them to vote, after having satisfied the committee that they enjoy the necessary qualifications. On an appointed day they will meet at the hustings, where voting will take place for the Electoral College in accordance with the regulations laid down. Another innovation provides for representatives of the five principal tribes, i.e., Bahktiari, Shahsevan of Azerbaijan, Kashgai of Ears, Khamseh of Ears (known as the Arab tribes), and the Turkomans, who are to have one deputy each. The following non-Moslem communities are also to have a deputy each : Chaldeans of Azerbaijan, Armenians of Ispahan, Jews, and Parsees. The Shah on the 15th instant made the following observations on the measure : — 1. The idea of giving representatives to the tribes was, in His Majesty’s opinion, likely to lead to trouble, as each tribe is divided into numerous subdivisions O;ten not on very good terms with each other. 2. An article stipulates that at the end of the two years session the electmate may, if they so desire, re-elect any of the old members. This His Majesty finds fault with, but it has been pointed out to him that thereqs no means of preventing the election of former members of Parliament, or, in fact, of influencing the electorate by any clause^ in the electoral law which would not be a violation of the constitution, or by the omission of any clause. , . ,. His Majesty stated yesterday, however, that he would withdraw his objections and sign the law forthwith as it stood. _ . . An attempt will be made by the Cabinet to bring about the simultaneous opening of the senate as provided for in the constitution of the 30th December, 1906 (articles 43 to 48). So far some resistance has been manifested against a tentative attempt to raise the question, and article 44 of the constitution of 1906 is quoted as an obstacle in the way, but this article, which runs as follows :— “ The regulations of the senate must be approved by the National Assembly,” does not refer to elections for the senate, but only to its internal regulations which will have to be drawn up later, just as internal regulations were drawn up for the last Assembly. The Cabinet would wish the senate to be formed according to the provisions of article 45 of the 1906 constitution, which enacts that thirty members must be elected by the people, of which fifteen for Tehran and fifteen for the provinces—the remaining thirty members to be chosen by the Shah, of whom half from Tehran and half from the provinces. I have, &amp;c. H. BARCLAY.44 No. 90. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 5.) Sir, Gulahek, June 18, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BAKCLAY, Inclosure in No. 90. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia during the past four weeks, Tehran. THE principal event of the four weeks under review was the completion of the electoral law on the 10th instant. Colonel Liakhoff has been entrusted with the duty of policing the town of Tehran and the summer quarters known as “ Shemran.” The result has been that order has been well maintained. The proximity of the Shah’s new camp at Sultan- etabad to the village of Gulahek has not been without inconvenience. Incidents of a more or less trivial character have occurred through the want of discipline among the Silakhori irregulars under Amir Bahadur Jang who still remains at the Shah’s side. The Ain-ed-Dowleh with a considerable portion of the royalist forces lately before Tabreez, arrived in Tehran on the 9th June. Ain-ed-Dowleh called on the Shah the following day. He is not likely to play any political part for some time at any rate. G. P. CHUBCHILL. Tabreez. On the 19th May His Majesty’s consul-general at Tabreez reported that the Caucasian fedais had almost all left the town or gone into hiding. A general disarmament had taken place, and, though many weapons were probably concealed in the houses, yet for some days past no armed men had been seen in the streets. The behaviour of the liussian troops in the towm is reported as being generally exemplary. Four days later Mr. Wratislaw reported that the vice-governor’s police force had been largely increased. This had been done with the intention of soothing the feelings of Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan, by allowing them the control of fifty policemen each, and the concession had been very liberally interpreted by the two ex-generals, who were said each to have put into uniform some 200 men, who were little inclined to consider themselves under the orders of the deputy governor. It was evident that Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan were both disposed to give trouble, and His Majesty’s consul-general stated that the arrival of a strong governor, who would be superior to local influences, was very desirable. Ala-ed-Dowleh, who is generally considered to be one of the “strong men” in Persia, has now been appointed. His Excellency is at this moment at Charlottenburg in Germany, and has telegraphed accepting the appointment. He will come to Tehran before proceeding to his new post. As regards the late nationalist rising in the Salmas and Urumia districts, the facts appear to be that Said-ul-Mamalek, who is already nationalist governor of Salmas, came to Urumia on the 13th April and took over the administration. He remained in power some five weeks and kept fairly good order. But the heavy contributions he levied on the wealthier citizens were unpopular, and in the middle of May another revolution was engineered by a local fedai leader who, calling some Kurdish auxiliaries to his assistance, compelled Said-ul-Mamalek to retreat hastily to Salmas. On the 7th June Mr. Wratislaw reported that forty Russian infantry were under orders to proceed to Urumia to serve as an escort to the Russian vice-consul there. This force was to protect Russian and, in case of need, all foreign subjects, but their instructions were to avoid interfering in local affairs.45 Resht. Sipahdar, lately in command of the nationalist forces here and at Kazvin, has been appointed governor of Ghilan and Mazanderan. He is said to intend leaving Kazvin for Resht shortly. The nationalist force at Kazvin remains under arms, and is likely to do so until the National Assembly meets. Astrabad. It appears that the Turkomans, having done all that the Shah wished them to do, were requested to disperse, but some of them were dissatisfied at not having received the money they were promised. They consequently resorted to robbery, and are reported to have plundered four villages, one of which they burnt. A fifth village, Kalander Mahaleh, repulsed the Turkomans after several hours' fighting. The grant of the constitution was notified to the people, and was received with expressions of joy. Considerable friction, however, still exists between Royalists and Nationalists. Meshed. Rukn-ed-Dowleh, on reappointment as governor-general, left Tehran for Meshed in the first week of June. On the 13th May the Shah telegraphed that the original constitution was restored. People paraded the streets, but there was no idea of praising His Majesty. It was known that the two Powers had forced the Shah to take this step, and everyone was sceptical of the result. A large party of Arab pilgrims, who reached Meshed about the 22nd May, reported that near Meiomai, some 40 miles east of Shahrud, they were attacked by Turkomans, and forty-five of their number were killed. Property to the value of 400 liras was also taken. This is confirmed by a waggon driver employed on the Tehran-Meshed telegraph line, who adds that on the 8th May the Turkomans surrounded Meiomai and drove away all the camels and cattle they could find. The marauders numbered about 300. In the Nishapur district Gholam Ali, a well-known bandit, with 200 horsemen, was committing robberies during the latter half of May. Telegrams from His Majesty’s consul state that on the 4th June an attempt was made to kill the Karguzar, and a leading shrine official was murdered in his house. On the 7th June there was a murder in the local assembly, and the Begler Beggi was also murdered. There was firing near the consulates, both of which were struck. On the 9th June an attack was made on the house of the chief of police, which is near His Majesty’s consulate-general. About forty shots were fired, but no one was killed. Turhat-l-IIa Ider i. On the 6th May a copy of the Shah’s proclamation announcing the re-establish ment of the constitution was posted on the gate of the town. The people were absolutely indifferent. . On the 17th May Mohammed Khan, of Dowletabad, with two of his relatives, took refuge in the consulate. Salar Khan and Assadullah, with a party of Baluchi, had seized his fort. They were said to have found much treasure m it, and weie reported to be quarrelling over the spoil. Seistan, The people of Seistan generally have, under instructions from the Meshed Assembly, ceased to pay revenue to the Shah’s officials at Birjand. Hissam-ed-Dowleh appears to have tried to maintain the Shah s authority, but with little success. Ispahan, During the latter part of May the dissensions among the Bakhtiari khans at Ispahan continued, and though it was decided to disband their forces in view of the Shah’s concessions, and this measure was indeed in part carried out, a false report, to the effect that the Shah’s forces at Kashan had received orders to march on Ispahan, produced a reversal of this decision, and some 200 horsemen who had left Ispahan were40 recalled. It is, however, probable that the khans will shortly return to their own country, with the exception of Sardar Assad, who proposes to remain in Ispahan until the arrival of a governor, and then to proceed to Tehran for the elections. Some anxiety has been felt by British firms at Ispahan on account of the probable insecurity ot the Ahwaz road consequent on the rivalry between the factions of Samsam- es-Sultaneh and Sardar Mohtashem. Sams;im-es-Sultaneh at first disclaimed respon sibility for any disorder that might occur, which he averred would be caused by Kuhgelu tribesmen. His Majesty’s consul-general has repeated to the khans a warning from His Majesty’s Minister that both tactions of the khans will be held responsible for any loss to British trade. Y ezd. News of the grant of the constitution by the Shah was very coldly received, the general opinion being that the Shah was only trying to gain time. One idea was that the constitution had been granted to induce people to pay revenue ; this done, it would be withdrawn. A caravan for Meshed, w’hich left Yezd towards the end of April, reached Turbat safely, while another got through to Tabbas. With the exception of the Meshed road, all roads to Yezd continue to be infested with bands of robbers, and a change in the command of the road guards has had no good result. There have been two outrages on Parsees during the past few weeks. In one case a Parsee wine seller was shot in cold blood by a customer for no apparent reason. He died a few days later. The murderer took refuge in a shrine and subsequently escaped from the town. In a second case a youth, who was extorting money from Parsees in a suburb of Yezd, stabbed an old man who had already given him some money. The wound is dangerous. The local authorities seem powerless to keep order. Strong representations have been made by His Majesty’s Minister, in reply to which Saad-ed-Dowleb has stated that Prince Moayyed-es-Sultaneh has been appointed governor and wdll go to Yezd, taking with him a force sufficient to maintain order. Kerman. Sahib Ekhtiar having been dismissed and Nizam-es-Sultaneh appointed governor, but not having yet left Tehran, the town is in a chaotic condition, there being no authority to appeal to. Early in May Hajji Ibrahim Naib took refuge in the consulate, but subsequently left on being appointed to charge of the town. Telegraphing on the 11th Jurie His Majesty’s consul reported that the state of the town and district was very serious and that the leading men of the town threatened to take refuge in the consulate as they could get no answer to their complaints to Tehran. In answer to representations, Saad-ed-Dowdeh has promised to hasten Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s departure. Kermanshah. Zabir-ed-Dowleh has been appointed governor. The local assembly, w^hich was elected during the former constitutional regime, has resumed its sittings, but rather to discuss aflairs and policy than for purposes of government. Hamadan has remained quiet, the nationalist force expected from Kazvin not having arrived. The Kermanshah-Hamadan road, which was closed for a while owing to the presence of robbers, is now open again. Shiraz. Soulet-ed-Dowleh has remained the dominant factor in the Shiraz situation. His Majesty’s Consul visited him on the 2nd May, at his invitation in his camp some miles from Shiraz, and discussed several pending matters of no great importance. As regards his own intentions he was very guarded, and confined himself to expressing his strong desire to keep out of the turmoil of Shiraz politics. He spoke bitterly of the Kawamis, accusing them ot hereditary and incurable bad faith, and also stating that their power over the Arabs was gone. He also spoke very bitterly against the Mullahs, and laughed at the present local assembly of Shiraz, which he said was irregular. As regards himself and his tribe, he declared that he could put the Bushire road in perfect order in a month, but that it would cost money, which he could not be sureof recovering from the Shah or the assembly. Consequently he proposed to get away from Shiraz as quickly as possible, and take no part in politics beyond keeping the Kashgai as quiet as possible. His language tended to confirm an idea previously formed by Mr. Bill that Mansur-es-Sultaneh secretly meditates contesting the headship of the Arabs with the Kawami family. Soulet left the immediate neigh bourhood of Shiraz about the 10th May, apparently intending to proceed to his summer quarters. He received extraordinary attentions from the governor-general, who went out 5 miles to visit him, and ostensibly made great efforts to reconcile him with the Kawarn, who went so far as to await a summons from the governor-general, in a neighbouring garden ; but it appeared that Soulet absolutely refused to see him. The grant of the constitution was duly announced, and was received with somewhat remarkable coldness, even the popular party apparently confining themselves to awaiting the details of the constitutional law with a good deal of scepticism, while the Shirazis in general were as usual more absorbed in local than in general politics. The fact is that no one seems disposed to attach any credit to anything bearing the Imperial ignature. The question of possible action by Soulet-ed-Dowleh being set at rest, attention was again focussed on the situation at Lar, whence the usual contradictory rumours constantly arrived. The position of Nasr-ed-Dowleh, whether he was victorious or defeated, was a delicate one. He was fighting for his own hand (for he had been recalled by the governor-general at the instance of the popular party) against an eminent constitutional leader, and he had so many people with him who had blood-feuds with Seyyid Abdul Hussain Lari, that an agreement was practically impossible, especially as the Seyyid had for months been issuing public notices condemning him and his brother as infidels worthy of death. On the 15th May Haji Ali Agha, the leading priest in the extreme constitutional party, arrived quite unexpectedly at the consulate, accompanied by his son, and explained that he had a telegram from Bunder Abbas to the effect that Nasr-ed-Dowleh had taken Lar, killed the Seyyid, massacred the inhabitants and plundered the town, that as this had occurred subsequent to the amnesty he had no longer any faith in the latter, and he expected to be treated in the same way. He also declared that he would accept no guarantee from Asef-ed-Dowleh, who had formally promised the Shiraz Assembly .that Nasr-ed-Dowleh would not go to Lar, and that he would not leave the consulate without a guarantee from the legation. He added that numbers of^ the popular party might be expected to follow him. Some eight persons of position arrived later and were admitted, while a large crowd assembled outside the consulate. They complained at great length against the Kawamis. Eventually Mr. Bill, having interviewed the governor-general and the Kawam, obtained a written assurance for all the refugees, who, with the exception of Haji Ali Agha, left the consulate; the crowd also dispersed. The bazaars remained closed for some days, and mourning ceremonies for the alleged deceased Seyyid were held in several mosques. The agitation soon lost force, but it resulted in open war between Asef-ed-Dowleh and the Kawam over the question whether the former did or did not send Nasr-ed-Dowleh to Lar, the former maintaining that he did not, and the latter that he holds the governor-general’s written orders to proceed to Lar and re-establish the Shahs Dovemment theie at all costs. The Kawamis concentrated their attacks on Ata-ed-Dowleh, who was held responsible for getting up the agitation of the previous week. On the 21st May a fairly well-known priest was assaulted in the street, severely beaten, and his life threatened. On the following day another priest was attacked in the same quarter, and Ata-ed-Dowleh consequently flogged the head-man of the quarter. The inhabitants promptly raised a riot, and were joined by the people of the adjoining quarter, where the Kawam’s town house is situated. Ata-ed-Dowleh appealed to the Kawam to restrain the latter, who eventually agreed to stop rioting on condition that Ata-ed-Dowleh should be dismissed within five days. From a telegram received on the 30th May it appears that Nasr-ed-Dowleh has telegraphed to the Shah, complaining that he has been lecalled fiom Lai by the governor-general at the instigation of certain members of the Shnaz local assembly, though he went to Lar by His Majesty’s orders. He added that he felt aggrieved at this action of the governor-general, as for the last two years he had made great endeavours to carry-out the Shah’s orders. He asked for a reply through his brother, the Kawam. The roads in Ears continue very unsafe, and robberies of posts, &amp;c., are frequent. In the neighbourhood of Konartakhte a local feud has been the cause of a good deal of inditing, (hiring which the Indo-European Telegraph Department’s office was invadedand some damage done to the building. The governor-general has now placed a guard of soldiers in the building. The Itussian acting consul-general at Bushire, while on his way to Shiraz, appears to have been fired on in this neighbourhood, his own and another horse being hit. The leading Persian merchants of Shiraz have telegraphed to the Minister of the Interior complaining bitterly of the state of public order and the incapacity of the governor-general. The appointment of a strong governor would appear to give the best hope of restoring order. The governor-general has officially notified His Majesty’s consul that Soulet-ed-Dowleh has undertaken the protection, for part of the journey, of caravans using the Firouzabad route to Bushire. It is too early to say whether this will be sufficient to restore trade to its normal condition. As illustrating the present condition of Fars it may be mentioned that quite recently the governor-general had great difficulty in getting anyone to take a message from him to the Kashgai Chief. A party of 100 men of the Chaharmahal Begiment took refuge in the consulate on the 1 Ith May, demanding arrears of pay. Mr. Bill made an unofficial representation on the subject to the governor-general, who promised to pay the men, but at the end of May they were still in the consulate. Persian Gulf. Buehire. On the 27th April 100 soldiers took refuge under the residency flagstaff, as a protest against their arrears of pay being withheld. They were, however, induced to leave on the 6th May, when the main part of their claims had been met and a written assurance given to His Majesty’s consul-general that retaliatory measures would not be taken against them. Normal arrangements have now been restored in the customs at Bushire, and the impounding of the receipts by the bank, a temporary expedient made by Major Cox, with the Minister s approval, in order to secure the receipts from improper use, has now ceased. During the time it has been in force the Bushire receipts have been very low, owning partly to the uncertainty of the situation and partly to the insecurity of the road, and after paying the expenses of the Customs Administration and a small daily allowance to the governor to enable him to maintain order, a balance of only 12,000 tomans remained, which has now been remitted to the Imperial Bank as part of the interest on their advances to the Persian Government. The British bluejackets were re-embarked on the 19th and 20th May, and since Darya Beggis arrival order has been well maintained except that Seyyid Murteza, whose conduct had been a constant source of anxiety, introduced a force of Tangestanis into the town. Darya Beggi, however, took decisive steps and succeeded in driving them out, and on the 8th June it was reported that Seyyid Murteza himself had been taken prisoner. Bunder Abbas. During the whole of April Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari continued to send messengers to the leading Nationalists in Bunder Abbas ordering them to close the Customs. Their reply that this was impossible only drew from the Seyyid a threat to send a force to enforce his orders. I his threat caused considerable uneasiness in the town and though Lar was taken by Nasr-ed-Dowleh and the Seyyid reported a fugitive early in May, as late as the 29th May His Majesty’s consul reported that the people of Bunder Abbas were in a state of painful anxiety owing to the Seyyid being still at large. In view of the loss to British trade and the possibility of damage to life and property of British subjects, he suggested that the Persian Government be asked to take active measures against the Seyyid. In reply to representations, Saad-ed-Dowleh said that he was unable to do anything at present. All British Indian subjects who were residing at Minab arrived at Bunder Abbas on the 12th April with all their goods and valuables. Minab was threatened at the time by one Mir Barket Khan with a large Baluch following.Art. 3. Le taux des interests est fixe it 6 pour cent 1’an, payables tons les S ' X ' Art. 4.

MALGRE les mesures prises par le Gouvernement du Schah a la suite des conseils de la Russie et de I’Angleterre pour le retablissement en Perse dune forme de gou vernement representatif, ainsi que pour la realisation de reformes indispensables, le mouvement revolutionnaire dans le centre de ITran ne s’est pas apaise. Les demarches faites par les legations de Russie et de la Grande-Bretagne dans le but de prevenir tout mouvement centre la capitale de la part des Bakhtiars sous les ordres de Serdar Asad, un des khans de cette tribu, aussi bien que de la part des forces reunies des revolutionnaires de Kazvin et de Resht et des aventuriers caucasiens, ayant le Sipehdar, gouverneur du Ghilan, a leur tete, sont restees infructueuses. ^ Les forces des adversaires du Gouvernement du Schah avancent graduellement sur Teheran oil se trouvent des elements qui leur sont favorables et oil Ton pent constater des aujourd’hui une forte agitation. Ayant inurement pese 1’etat de choses resultant de la situation mdiquee, le Gou vernement Imperial a etabli que la politique russe en Perse doit continuer a etre baseesur le principe de non-iiiterventioii absolue dans les affaires interienres du pays, ainsi que dans la lutte entre le Schah et son people, quelle qne soit 1’issne de cette lutte, mais en meme temps nous devons avoir en vue que 1’entree des Bakbtiars, et des re- volutionnaires a Teberan pourra exposer an pins grand peril les legations, les entre- prises, et les sujets rnsses et etrangers, aussi bien qne notre rente Enzeli—Telieran, d antant pins qne, d’apres nos renseignements, la senle troupe persane organisee, e’est- a-dire, la brigade de Cosaques, est extremement affaiblie et sera probablement impuissante a maintenir 1’ordre a Teheran. Tout cela nous impose 1’obligation morale de prendre tontes les mesures en notre ponvoir pour que les institutions et les sujets susindiques puissent recevoir une protec tion effective et pour que les communications entre Teheran et Enzeli restent libres en toute occurrence. Dans ce but, il a ete decide d’envoyer immediatement de Bakou a Enzeli un detachement compose d’un regiment de Cosaques, dun bataillon d’infanterie, et dune batterie, ce detachement ne se portera pas an dela de Kazvin et veillera a 1’etablissement d’une libre communication entre ce point et la mer ; son mouvement ulterieur dependra du cours des evenements et ne pourra avoir lieu que sur 1’ordre de la legation Imperiale a Teheran en cas de grave peril dans le sens susindique. Le chef du detachement sera muni d’instructions categoriques a I’effet que nos troupes auront pour but exclusif de proteger les legations, les entreprises, et les sujets russes et etrangers sans immixtion aucune dans les luttes politiques en Perse ou dans les affaires interieures de ce pays en general. Les troupes russes ne resteront en Perse que jusqu’au moment ou la vie et la propriety des representants diplomatiques, ainsi que des institutions et des sujets russes et etrangers, seront a 1’abri de tout peril. Ambassade de Russie, LondreS, le 4 juittet, 1909. Translation m spite of the measures adopted on the advice of Russia and Great Britain by the Government of the Shah fot the restoration in Persia of representative government and the realisation of the necessary reforms, the revolutionary movement in Central Persia has not died down. The steps taken by the Russian and British legations to prevent the advance on Tehran of the Bakhtiaris under the orders of Sardar Assad, one of the khans of that tribe, as well as of the united forces of the revolutionaries from Kazvin and Resht and of the Caucasian adventurers under the Sipahdar, Governor of Ghilan, have not been successful. The troops of the opponents of the Shah’s Government are gradually nearing Tehran, where there are elements favourable to their cause, and where a strong ferment is already noticeable. On careful consideration of the state of affairs as indicated above, the Imperial Government has come to the conclusion that Russian policy in Persia must continue upon the basis of absolute non-intervention in the internal affairs of the country as well as in the conflict between the Shah and his people, whatever the outcome of that conflict may be ; we must not, however, lose sight of the fact that the entry of the Bakhtiaris and the revolutionaries into Tehran will place the Russian and other foreign legations, institutions, and subjects, as well as our road from Enzeli to Tehran in the gravest danger, the more so because, according to information which has reached us, the only organised Persian brigade of troops, that is to say, the Cossack brigade, has been much weakened and will probably be powerless to maintain order in Tehran. This circumstance imposes upon us the moral obligation to take all measures in our power to afford effective protection to the above-mentioned institutions and subjects, and to ensure that communications between Tehran and Enzeli remain unrestricted in all circumstances. It has therefore been decided to send immediately from Baku to Enzeli a force consisting of one regiment of Cossacks, one battalion of infantry, and one battery of artillery; this detachment will not advance beyond Kazvin, and will ensure the establishment of unrestricted communications between that point and the sea; the further movements of this force will depend upon the course of events, and can only ensue upon the order of the Imperial Legation at Tehran in the event of the aforesaid dangerous situation arising. The commander of the force will be provided with definite instructions to the effect that the exclusive object of the force must be the protection of the Russian and other foreign legations, [824] E 2institutions, and subjects, while abstaining from any interference in the political struggle in Persia, or generally in the internal affairs of the country. The Russian troops will remain in Persia only until the lives and piopeity or the Russian and other foreign diplomatic representatives and subjects and the safety of Russian and foreign institutions shall be completely ensured.

Saad-ed-Dowleh has returned a reply to the effect that he is willing to receive the two leaders’ delegates and to discuss any legitimate proposals which may tend towards a settlement. He has at the same time made it clear that those of their demands which are evidently unconstitutional cannot be entertained by the Shah’s Government. No. 107. Sir G.

The Seyyid, who is known to be of an irresponsible and violent character, would, it is greatly to be feared, show violence to the Russian consul should he succeed in reaching Shiraz. My Russian colleague is talking of asking for an increase of his Cossack guard.

There has been a complete absence of looting, and, beyond what may possibly result from stray bullets, no danger to European subjects is to be feared. , , ,.

I am proceeding imme diately to Sultanatabad with M. Sabline, in order to urge upon the Shah the necessity of making a truce for negotiations with the nationalists. At 8 a.m. the two dragomans started for Tehran, with the object of seeing the nationalist leaders and inducing them to open negotiations. This was at the Shah’s own request. The fighting, however, seems to have become more serious, and it is feared that they may not be able to enter the town. Yesterday His Majesty promised that Tehran would not be bombarded. No. 120.

REFERRING to my telegram of this morning, in which I reported the bom bardment of Tehran and our contemplated joint representations to the Shah, I beg to state that our audience, which was of a distressing character, had no satisfactory results. We prayed His Majesty to order the cessation of the bombardment, and to proclaim an armistice in order that negotiations might be opened. The Shah replied complaining that when the forces loyal to him were sufficiently strong to overcome the revolutionaries we had restrained him, but now that they were in Tehran and attacking his palace there, he must do what he could to protect himself. At the moment when his troops were being attacked he could not proclaim an armistice ; it was tor us to compel his adversaries to desist from attacking him, and then any constitutional demands that they might have to make would receive his consideration. In reply, we stated that efforts had been directed throughout towards a reconcilia tion between’ His Majesty and his people. The conciliatory counsels tendered to the latter had, unhappily, been rejected, and to ask them to give up their arms when everything was strongly m their favour would certainly provoke a refusal. If, however, we could assure them that it was the firm intention of the Shah to grant an aimistice, we might be able to prevent them from driving home the advantage they had already obtained. His Majestv would not hear of this proposal. On taking leave 'of His Majesty, we met the Minister for Foreign Affairs. We told him that It would be useless to ask the nationalists to give up their arms, and he requested us to await the result of an audience which he was about to have of His Majesty before we informed the Sardars of the result of our representations. To this we agreed, but his Excellency has not yet communicated w ith us. By reason of the bombardment, Messrs. Churchill and Baronowsky were unable to enter Tehran this morning. No. 121. Sir G.

His Majesty was already aware that, at a meeting held yesterday at Baharistan, the Vaiiahd had been chosen to succeed him, this decision having been announced last night informally. Both Mohamed Ali and his consort are most reluctant to part with their elder son, although they would accept a separation from the younger. The Shah proposed to M. Sabline, at the end of a long and distressing interview, that the Yaliahd should ascend the throne, but that he should be allowed to travel abroad for some time with his mother, or, if this arrangement be inadmissible, that the younger brother should be proclaimed. His Majesty requested the two representatives to reply to the nationalist leaders that His Majesty declined to receive any deputation, and declared that he had already abdicated by leaving Sultanatabad for the Russian legation. My Russian colleague and I replied to the nationalist leaders as desired, but did not mention His Majesty’s views as regards the succession.

(Telegraphic.) _ Gulahek, August 2, 1909. DURING the last fortnight little progress has, lam afraid, been made towards ensuring the departure of his late Majesty. The Persian Government is still engaged in efforts to recover certain jewels, said to be of great value, which the ex-Shah claims as his own property, but which are nevertheless asserted to belong to the Crown, I trust that there will be no further delay when once the cjuestion of the jewels is settled. No. 175, Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 3.) Sir, Gulahek, July 12, 1909. IN my despatch of the 16th ultimo I stated that the Shah’s acceptance of our pro gramme had produced a detente, and that the prospect of the Bakhtiari from Ispahan and the fedai from Kazvin marching on Tehran, which at one time seemed imminent, was now remote. The prompt and striking manner in which events have contradicted this statement affords a somewhat disheartening illustration of the difficulty of correctly gauging the situation in Persia. The information in my possession was to the effect that many of the Bakhtiari had left Ispahan for their homes, and that the disbandment of the remainder would be effected shortly. At Kazvin, too, so far from there being any signs of an approaching advance on Tehran, my information was to the effect that the fedai were gradually dispersing. Hardly, however, had I signed my despatch above referred to when 1 received on the 17th ultimo a telegram from His Majesty’s consul-general at Ispahan reporting that Sardar Assad had called on him to say good-bye as he was leaving for Tehran, and that rumour credited the Bakhtiari chief with the intention of taking with him 1,000 men to enforce the execution of the constitution. Ten days later we learned that the fedai under Sipahdar had advanced from Kazvin, and were already well on their way to Tehran, and this notwithstanding that Sipahdar had only a few days before agreed to dissociate himself from his men, and visit the capital with a view to a reconciliation with the Shah, provided the Russian Legation gave him a guarantee for his personal safety, which M. Sabline had consented to do. On receipt of Mr. Grahame’s telegram I at once dispatched an urgent message, instructing him to point out to Sardar Assad that tlm preparatory work for the restoration of parliamentary government was proceeding without hitch, and^ that the demonstration which he was believed to be contemplating would only complicate and _ retard matters. Sardar Assad had already started, and Mr. Grahame forwarded my message to him by letter. On the 20th'l received a visit from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who told me that the Government were about to send Amir Mufakham, a Loyalist Bakhtiaii chief, with what following he could get together against Sardar Assad. I deprecated this as a resumption of civil war, and told his Excellency what I had done with a view to arresting Sardar Assad’s advance, adding that should this fail I would do my best to obtain authorisation for my Russian colleague and myself to send out the two consuls- general from Ispahan to overtake Sardar Assad and give him stiong advice to abandon his demonstration. His Excellency promised in that case to hold back Amir Mufakham for a few days. On the 22nd Mr. Grahame received an answer to my message. It was not satisfactory, and I accordingly directed Mr. Grahame to o\ertake the Sardar, who was now with some 700 or 800 men well on his way to Kum, and to make it clear to him that the two legations were satisfied with the progress which had been made in the execution of the programme presented to the Shah by the two Powers, and also, as Sardar Assad seemed to be under a delusion as to the nature of our programme, to deny emphatically the story in circulation that it involved any curtailment of Persia’s independence, and to explain to him that our representations had merely taken the form of friendly advice to the Shah as to measures for the restoration of constitutional government. My Russian colleague sent similar instructions to his consul-general later in the day.74 The joint communication from the two legations was made by the two consuls-general to Sardar Assad at Kum on the 26th. I enclose a report from Mr. Grahame of what passed at the interview. Here I need only state that Sardar Assad maintained that the restored constitution was a sham, citing as proofs of this the presence in the Cabinet of Saad-ed-Dowleh, the retention of Amir Bahadur Jang at the Palace, and the continuance in office of Mukhber-ed-Dowleh as Minister of Telegraphs, and that he promised to let the two consuls-general have by the 28th certain demands which he was formulating in concert with the various nationalist centres. As to Mukhber-ed-Dowleh, I should mention that when the reform Cabinet was formed, it was part of the private suggestions of the two legations that the Minister of Telegraphs under the late reactionary regime should retain his post. We knew him to be a reactionary, but the Minister of Telegraphs in Persia has no seat in the Cabinet, and, in view of Mukhber-ed-Dowleh’s experience in telegraphic adminis tration, we wished him to remain in office. To resume my report of our efforts to check Sardar Assad's advance : my Prussian colleague and I, on learning from the consuls-general what had passed at their interview with the sardar, instructed them to emphasise once more to the Bakhtiari chief the inopportuneness of his armed demonstration, to repeat to him that the two legations were satisfied with the progress made in the execution of our programme, and to point out the grave responsibility he incurred if he disregarded our advice. Mr. Grahame and M. Bogoiawlensky were also to tell Sardar Assad that they would wait at Kum until midday of the 29th in order to learn his demands. Sardar Assad asked for time, before formulating the demands, to communicate with Kazvin and Tabreez and for the free use of a telegraph wire for the purpose. We did not think it suitable to keep the two consuls-general waiting longer at Kum merely to learn the Sardar’s demands, which we had good reason to believe had already been presented to the Persian Government, and which could equally well reach us through some other channel. We therefore instructed Mr. Grahame and M. Bogoiawlensky to inform Sardar Assad that they had no further communication to make to him, and they left Kum on the 29th. Meanwhile, on the 28th, news had reached the capital that some '900 fedai from Kazvin were within 45 miles of Tehran. With the failure of the mission of the consuls-general at Kum, and with this move of the revolutionaries from Kazvin, the outlook for the Shah was a dark one indeed, and the greatest alarm prevailed at the Palace. The troops in the capital, with the exception of the 800 or 900 Persian Cossacks, were not of a kind to inspire much confidence, and to make matters worse for the Shah all chance of serious dissensions amongst the Bakhtiaris seemed to have disappeared. The Ilbeggi, Mohtesham-es-Sultaneh, had made it up with the Ilkhani, Samsam-es-Sultaneh; and Amir Mufakham, who was, and has remained up to now, loyal to the Shah, was not likely to have any considerable following. To add to the difficulties of the position the Cabinet, with the exception of Saad-ed-Dowleh, was in a state of complete demoralisation. Saad-ed-E)owdeh had resigned on the 25th. his resignation being followed by that of the other Ministers, and, although the Shah commanded the Cabinet to carry on temporarily, Saad-ed-Dowleh was the only one who had the courage really to resume his functions. The others, while carrying on current business, absolutely declined to do anything involving responsibility. In the critical position in which he was placed, the Shah summoned my Russian colleague and me to Sultanatabad on the 2nd instant. I have so fully reported in my telegram of the 3rd July what passed at this audience that I need here only say that His Majesty asked for our advice, and that we had to tell him that it was his delay in following our advice tendered to him so repeatedly last winter that had brought him to his present straits. We had endeavoured to dissuade Sardar Assad from marching on Tehran, but had failed, and we did not know what advice we could now give him. We were ready, however, if any opportunity offered, to use our influence for a peaceful settlement. The audience left a painful impression on M. Sabline as it did on me. On the following day I received your telegram of the 2nd July, in which you informed me of your suggestion to the Russian Ambassador that a joint warning might be conveyed to Sipabdar and Sardar Assad that the only way to avoid inter vention was to restore order and to give the constitution which had been restored a fair chance. The danger of a conflict seemed so imminent that M. Sabline, although he had not received instructions, agreed with me to send representatives of the two legations to Sipahdar and Sardar Assad to convey the warning in question. Accordingly early in the morning of the 4th Major Stokes and M. Baronowsky left to interview Sipahdar, and Mr. Churchill and M. Romanowsky to interview Sardar Assad. MajorStokes and M. Baronowsky found fighting in progress at Shahabad between the fedai and the Cossacks, who had fallen back from Kerej. They were fired on by mistake by the Cossacks, fortunately without untoward consequences, and after the conflict was over proceeded on their way to the Sipahdar. I enclose a memorandum by Major Stokes reporting on his interview as well as a report by Mr. Churchill on his interview with Sardar Assad. As reported by telegraph on the 5 th instant, the communication made to the two Sardars did not seem to make much impression. Sipahdar, however, gave to Major Stokes and M. Baronowsky a list of his demands (see Major Stokes’ memo randum). These demands seemed to my Russian colleague and myself unreasonable, and we did not see our way to recommend the Shah to negotiate on the proposed basis. There were, however, two demands which, in the circumstances, it was very desirable the Shah should accept, and which, moreover, came well within the spirit of our programme, which aimed at having persons about the Shah who inspired coDfidence. They were those for the expulsion of “traitors” such as Amir Bahadur Jang, Sheikh Fazlullah, Mufakher-ul-Mulk and others, and the dismissal of Mukber-ed-Dowleh from the post of Minister of Telegraphs. In our reply to Sipahdar we accordingly signified our willingness to press these, provided that he intimated to us that he would be satisfied if the Shah granted them. In his reply he ignored our offer. He repeated the old story that the constitution was a sham, and expressed the hope that in view of the Anglo-Russian agreement the nation would not meet with interference in its efforts to recover its rights. A further opportunity was offered to the two legations of using their influence for a reconciliation on the 10th instant, when Saad-ed-Dowleh informed them that he had sent an invitation couched in conciliatory terms to the two Sardars to send delegates to discuss terms for a settlement. We seized the opportunity to press upon the Shah the necessity of getting rid of his obnoxious favourites, and His Majesty having given us a secret pledge to expel them on receiving a written promise from Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, through the two legations, that they would desist from hostilities and disarm their followers, we sent a message to the two Sardars (whose forces had now joined hands in the Shahriar district, some 16 miles west of the capital) urging them to send their delegates to negotiate, and assuring them of our conviction that the Shah would entertain such of their demands as were in accordance with the constitution. When this message reached the Sardars yesterday morning, fighting, which appears to have started on the previous day, was still in progress between the revolutionary forces (which I understand number about 2,000) and some 500 Cossacks, assisted by the loyalist Bakhtiaris under Amir Mufakham and other nondescript troops. The fighting continued until sunset, when the Cossacks, who had advanced to attack the fedai position, retreated. The reply to our message reached us this morning ; it was to the effect that the Sardars could not send delegates while they were being repeatedly attacked and while the road was blocked by royalist troops. They asked that the Persian Groveinment should send representatives to treat, and said that they would remain on the defensive till sunset. I have communicated this answer to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, but I fear that, for the moment at least, no further efforts of the two legations to bring about a reconciliation would serve any useful purpose. In this my Russian colleague agrees with me, and we intend for the present to let matters take then couise. I have reported the above fully by telegraph, but I have thought it convenient to record in consecutive form the steps taken by the two legations in the hope of pi eventing the nationalist forces from entering Tehran. I have, &amp;c. Gf. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 175. June 26, 1909. WE have had a conversation of one hour and a-half with Sardar Assad. We informed him that his demonstration was entirely misplaced in the opinion o both legations and could only be injurious to the constitution the leit motif” of Sardar’s argument was that the constitution does not exist, and that both legations are shamefully deceived He adduces as proof the presence of Amir Bahadur Jang as in effect Minister of War, the Mustaufi-ul-Mamalek havingpractically resigned, and that of Saad-ed-Dowleh and Mukhber-ed-Dowleh (both noted absolutists) in the Cabinet, We warned him that if be disregarded the advice of the two legations, they would consider that his object was to complicate the situation and would hold him personally responsible for the results. He protested energetically that he had no object but the establishment of a real constitution, of which, however, he gave no definition. As formerly in Ispahan, he pointed out that he had not come to fight with anyone unless they fought with him. As a proof of this, he averred he had avoided going to Kashan lest he should thus provoke an engagement with the Shah’s troops there, more than half of whom he had won over, while the others were ready to join him at the first signal. Urged not to put himself in opposition to the two legations, and advised to return quietly home, he replied that he could not go back without having accomplished anything. He is, however, prepared to retire as soon as certain demands of his are granted. He could only enumerate two of these :~— 1. That Amir Bahadur Jang and five or six other noted absolutists should be banished from Tehran. 2. That assurances should be given for the security of the members of the assembly when elected, as he is certain that they will never dare to assemble. The remaining conditions he said he could not formulate till he had consulted the members of a constitutional committee summoned by him to meet him on this very date at Kum, of whom, however, only one had as yet arrived. He promises to furnish his demand in writing by the 28th June at latest. Asked what he proposed to do if his demands were refused, he quoted a couplet from Firdausi in the vein of u Death or Westminster Abbey.” We pointed out that his demonstration, instead of expediting the constitution, would retard it. He replied that bis action would have one of two results, either a real constitution would be established or there would be direct foreign intervention. It would be better to hasten on the denouement. In further proof of his pacific intentions he stated that he bad counter-ordered the advance of the reinforce ments from Ispahan. At one point in the conversation he professed himself ready to wait with his forces, either at Kum or elsewhere, till Parliament assembled, adding that he was sure that it never would meet under the present pseudo-constitutional regime. He repeatedly avowed himself unwilling to place himself in opposition to the two legations to which he would be grateful if they could obtain for him his demands. These were not his only, but those of Tabreez, Meshed, Pesht, and other places which he only represented. He had no personal object. This did not prevent him adducing as one proof of the absolutism now rampant in Tehran the fact that he had heard to-day that the Shah had conferred his (Sardar Assad’s) lands in Bakhtiari on Amir-i- Mufakham. G. GBAHAME. BOGOIAVLENSKY. Inclosure 2 in No. 175. Joint Communication made to Sipohdar by British and Russian Legations, July 4, 1909. M. BARONOWSKI and I reached Kerej at 3 p.m. on the 4th July, and were immediately received by Sipahdar, to whom we had telephoned earlier in the day asking for an interview. M. Baronowski informed Sipahdar that we had been sent to him by the represen tatives of the two Powers at Tehran with a message which was the outcome of discussions which had taken place at London and St. Petersburgh. I added that Messrs. Churchill and Romanowski were on their way to Sardar Assad with a similar message. Sipahdar said that he had just heard from Sardar Assad who was at Robart Kerim. M. Baronowski then read in Persian the translation of the instructions which we had received. Sipahdar listened attentively, and when M. Baronowski had finished, said he would like to read them through himself. M. Baronowski handed him the paper, which we left with him. Having read the instructions, Sipahdar proceeded to complain of the general unreliability of the Shah ; that His Majesty made promises but there was great delay amounting to non-fulfilment in carrying them out; that he kept round him certain traitors, mischief makers and mollahs, and preferred the advice of five or six of these persons to the wishes of the rest of the people of Persia ; that norr rr l ( confidence could be placed in the Shah or his Ministers ; that the latter did not even reply to telegrams he had sent at least ten to which no reply had been given ; that some of the Ministers were traitors (he mentioned no names), and that the Ministers had refused to recognised the Tehran nationalist committee (this referred to the committee to which Saa'd-ed-Dowleh at first extended official recognition, which he, however, soon withdrew). Sipahdar then expressed a wish to consult the other nationalist leaders with his force, and withdrew for this purpose. On his return an hour or an hour and a half later he began by saying that the nationalists were very grateful to the two great Powers, the two leading Powers of the world, for their efforts to bring about a satisfactory settlement of affairs. He then enquired whether the Shah knew of our being sent to him with a message. I replied that I could not say for certain but I believed that His Majesty did not know of it. M. Baronowski said he also did not think the Shah knew of our coming. Sipahdar then asked what was meant by the words “to restore order” in the message. The movements of his troops were and would continue to be orderly. He said the nationalists’ forces had come to obtain certain objects, these they had not yet obtained. He and Sardar Assad would give the two legations an undertaking for the correct behaviour of themselves and their troops if the two legations would arrange that he and Sardar Assad, each with 150 men, should be permitted to come to Tehran, or to a garden near it, whence, in consultation with the provinces, they could arrange for the firm establishment of the constitution, I asked what he meant by “ establishment of the constitution.” He replied that there were certain things the nationalists wanted done. I replied that if he would tell us what the nationalists wanted the two legations would, if the nature of the demands allowed of their doing so. bring them to the notice of the Shah and endeavour to obtain His Majesty’s acceptance of them, in which case their execution would be guaranteed by the two legations. Sipahdar stated what some of the nationalist demands were and we requested him to give them to us in writing. He again complained of the Shah, that ever since the constitution was first granted he had continually tried to destroy it, and he referred to the events of last year. I said the matters he complained of belonged to the past and were best treated as by-gones, that quite recently the Shah had accepted the friendly advice of the two Powers, had carried out most points of the programme which he had accepted and was carrying out the rest; the electoral law was ready for promulgation and everything was going well for the elections and the convocation of the National Assembly. M. Baronowski pointed out that the National Assembly was the really important thing, when they had got that the nationalists could change all the Ministers if they wished. Sipahdar only repeated his statements that the nationalists had not yet got what they wanted. He then withdrew to have the demands written out. t An hour later Sipahdar returned with a paper containing eight demands. To prevent any chance of a misunderstanding w 7 e requested him to read the demands to us. This he did, and I enquired who were the persons whose deportation was one of the demands. He referred to a list he held in his hand, and read us the following six names : Amir Bahadur Jang, Sheikh Fazlullah, Mufakhar-ul-Mulk, Muktidar-i-Nazam, Sani Hazrat, and Mullah Muhammad Amoli. ssiicl wg would convGy tli© donneinds to the two legations, dnd ci roplj would be sent to Sipabdar stating whether or not the legations saw then yvay to asking the Shah to accept them. Sipahdar asked for an early reply. We pointed out that perhaps Some discussion would be necessary, and suggested that he should wait thiee days 01 a reply He said that every day cost the nationalists a considerable sum for the payment of their forces, and he could not wait for a reply after midday on Tuesday, the 6th July. To this we agreed. He asked if Ave would give an undertaking that no military movement would be made against him during this period We replied that we could not give such an undertaking, but that were he attacked he would, of course, be free to fight. We then withdrew. ... L , ,. ,1 , , From the time when we met the first nationalist outpost our reception throughout was entirely respectful, and in our progress through the camp every soldier we met saluted us. I saw no signs of despondency resulting from the morning s defeat, the few men we questioned maintained that it was an unauthorised outpost affair and of no consequence. s ghahabad on oul . re tum journey to Tehran we informed Captain Peribinoseff, who was in command of the Persian Cossacks there, of Sipahdar s intention to abstain from military action untd imdday on Tuesday, the 6th July.

Inclosure 4 in No. 175. Memorandum on Joint Representations made by Mr. Churchill and M. liomanowsky on July 3, 1909. M. ROMANOWSKY and I left Gulahek at 1‘30 a.m. yesterday, escorted by two Russian Cossacks and two Indian sowars, as well as a gholam of each legation. We arrived at Hassanabad, on the Tehran-Kum road, 36 miles from Tehran, shortly after 7 a.m., where we found Amir Mufakham, the Bakhtiari royalist chief and a Persian Cossack officer with a force of some 200 men. Amir Mufakham, on whom we called, said he was just about to meet Sardar Assad at a place half-way between Hassanabad and Robart Kerim, about 16 miles west of the Tehran—Kum road, where the Sardar was then encamped, to discuss matters amicably. Each party was to go to the rendezvous with oniy live men. He readily agreed to us joining him, and supplied riding horses for us and our escort. hen Sardar Assad arrived we saw him alone, and I read to him the message from the British and Russian representatives, which we had been charged to deliver to him. He listened to me patiently to the end, and then spoke as follows : “ I am informed that the granting of the constitution by the Shah is not genuine ; that there is no intention of sincerely carrying out the promises which have been made. What guarantee is there that the Shah will carry into effect the promises which he hasiioW made ? M I said that we had been authorised to say, if he raised this question, that the two legations were prepared to obtain such guarantees for him. He replied that foreign guarantees were exactly what they objected to. They did not want foreign guarantees in any shape or form. I hastened to assure him that no such guarantees were contemplated, but that we w~ere prepared to obtain guarantees from the Shah. He said this would be quite a different matter and would satisfy them, but he turned the subject and seemed to have no desire to discuss the matter, but repeated that he was convinced from reports he had received from all the provinces that the people were so distrustful of the Shah’s sincerity, that he knew there would be no elections for the Assembly. I said we thought the military measures taken by him and by Sipahdar were responsible for this feeling of unrest, and that he appeared to be entirely under a misapprehension as to what had been done at Tehran. We could assure him that the work done by Saad-ed-Dowleh’s Government and the Electoral Law Committee was very satisfactory, and there had been every prospect, until he and Sipahdar moved on Tehran, of a satisfactory re-establishment of the constitution. He retorted that no confidence could be felt so long as certain mischief-makers were allowed to remain at the Shah’s side. Did I deny that at this moment Amir Bahadur was in supreme command of the army '? I said that one of the recommendations of the recent Anglo-Russian programme of advice to the Shah was that Amir Bahadur should be deprived of office. This and the other recommendations had been followed by the Shah. I myself had been instructed to ask Saad-ed-Dowleh, who was genuinely working in the interests of the country, whether Amir Bahadur’s presence was an obstacle in the way of a settle ment. He had replied that he was no longer influential, that his power no longer existed, but that if there was the slightest sign of activity on his part, he would not fail immediately to say so. Under these circumstances there was no reason why we should insist on his removal as he now only commanded the Silakhoris attached to the Shah, and had no influence whatever. Sardar Assad then said that he had not come with the intention of fighting, but only to see that the constitution was re-established. If there was any fighting it would not be his fault. His messages to the Shah remained unanswered, and there was a ring round the Shah of persons who prevented the truth from reaching His Majesty. He had come so close to Tehran in order to be able to make his demands direct. He had a very large following, and the tribes of Ears were with him. We said we would leave a copy in Persian text of the message we had been sent to give him, and would return to Tehran. When we took leave of him at 1 p.m., he said, with marked emphasis : “ An revoir, k Tehran.” G. P. CHURCHILL. July 5, 1909. Inclosure 6 in No. 175. Instructions to Major Stokes and Mr. Churchill YOU will do your best to meet and communicate with Sardar Assad and Sipahdar and tell them that the only way to avoid foreign intervention is to restore order and to give the constitution as now re-established a fair chance. You should state to them that they are under a gross misapprehension both as to the representations made by the two friendly Pow T ers on the 22nd April, and as to the measures taken by the Shah’s Government to execute their recommendations. You should say that the representations took the form of fiiendly advice to the Shah to re-establish the constitution and to take certain measures to that end. _ These measures the Shah has already for the most part executed. A nationalist committee has without interference from the Government, elaborated a most liberal electoral law which has been signed by the Shah No obstruction whatever has been offered by those Ministers who are accused of absolutism, to the carrying out of the measures recommended. If Sardar 'Assad and Sipahdar ask for guarantees they should state what guarantees they demand and we will do our best to obtain t em. 'RA'RPT a VSir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .— (Received August 3 .) Sir, Gulahek, July 16, 1909. I HAVE the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia during the past four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inelosure in No. 176. Monthly Summary. Tabreez. ON the 19th June a detachment of Russian troops consisting of a howitzer battery and two companies of infantry left for Russia. On the 20th June the remain ing Russian troops moved camp from near the Aji River to the Shah’s garden. On the 28th June the Russian general w'as ordered to suspend the withdrawal of Russian troops. The town has remained quiet, and there have been no further incidents. Sattar Khan and Bagher Khan are still in the Turkish consulate-general, but are to leave Persia shortly with the Turkish consul-general, the Russian Government giving guarantees that they will in no way molest them. They are to remain abroad until order is restored in Persia. On the 7th July a force of 150 Russian Cossacks was dispatched toBasminch, as some Shahsevans, who were apparently fighting Rahim Khan’s men in Karadagh, had appeared near that place. This force returned to Tabreez a few days later, leaving a post of observation of sixty men at Basminch. The acting governor, Ijlal-ul-Mulk, has repeatedly expressed the wish to resign, but until the governor-general arrives his resignation cannot be accepted. The governor- general, Ala-ed-Dowleh, arrived at Tehran from Europe early in July, and has so far made no sign of leaving for Tabreez. Resht. On the 28th June reinforcements left Resht for the nationalist force at Kazvim On the 8th July Russian troops landed at Enzeli and left on the 10th July for Kazvin. The force known to be coming is 500 Cossacks, 4 guris, and 1,000 infantry. In s pite of the movements of nationalist troops against Tehran traffic on' the Resht-Tehran road has not in any way been interrupted, and the posts have gone through regularly and without delay Meshed: On the outbreak of disorders at the end of May the Russian consuls-general sent strong messages to the local assembly through the leading priests and fallowed these up with a somewhat less strong letter. The bazaars were shut in protest, and the Karguzar w r as attacked. On the 7th June a series of outrages culminated in the murder of the Begler Beggi. The Begler Beggi, wdio showed fight, shot one of his assassins, who was subsequently given a royal funeral, the assembly attending to a man. A Persian friend of Major Sykes’s told him that there was every chance of an attempt being made on Prince Dabija’s life by his own subjects, whose hate was that of madmen. Everyone of position fled either to the ark or to distant villages or was blackmailed. A list of about twenty people was drawn up and attempts were made to kill them. In short, a reign of terror prevailed. On two occasions, the 6th and 8th June, the defences of the British consulate were manned owing to the amount of promiscuous firing which went on. Neither Prince Dabija nor the members of his staff dared to leave the ark quarter, and the former received repeated warnings to be on his guard. As the arrival of the Rukn-ed-Dowleh w^as likely to be much delayed and would only excite the anarchists more, the two consul-generals telegraphed the state of affairs to their legations. Prince Dabija asked for reinforcements and, as the state of affairs was intolerable and there seemed little hope of improvement, unless the robbers quarrelled81 oyer the rich spoils. Major Sykes agreed that some such action was called for. The disorders continued, and when on the 16th June, Hukn-ed-Dowleh arrived, he found himself helpless, the city and telegraph office being still in the hands of the enemv Major Sykes visited him and found him scared. Major Sykes reports that during June two parties of revolutionaries, each of fifty or sixty men, from Tabreez reached Meshed, ihe Assembly continued to raise volunteers. On or about the 18th June Prince Dabija wrote to the governor-general demands to the following effect: . b The evacuation by “volunteers” of the telegraph office and the surrender of their arms. 2. The arrest of the murderers of the late shrine official and of the Begler Beggi. The letter ended up by promising the governor-general the help of both consulates. It vas sent to the Assembly on the 19th June and was torn up, both the governor- general and Piince Dabija being roundly abused. A body of ruffians had some weeks previously taken up their abode in the ark, which they made their head-quarters for raids into the town. On the 2.3rd June, the reactionary Sorab quarter, under the Shuja-ut-Taulia, who is believed to have been inspired by the governor-general, attacked some volunteers, and a skirmish followed. This led to general looting m the ark quarter, and to some desultory firing. On the 24th June there was a great deal of firing. In the evening Prince Dabija sent a patrol to the liussian bank with supplies for the post maintained there. As passage was refused, a Maxim was sent for, and opened fire. I here were no casualties, but the way was promptly opened. Looting and burning increased, and Major Sykes received an appeal from the Assembly whom he advised to come to terms with the governor-general. On the 25th June a telegram was received from the Constitutionalists at Tehran advising the Assembly to avoid giving chances of complaint. This produced a good effect and negotiations were opened and disarmament by the Assembly, in return for the expulsion of the leaders of the ruffians, was agreed upon. The latter meanwhile attacked the telegraph office, but were lepulsed with the loss of two men killed. On the 26th June, the governor-general took refuge under joint Anglo-Russian protection. On the 3rd July the governor-general, Prince Dabija, and two leading members of the Assembly met at the British consulate. A disarmament was agreed to, and a reconciliation was effected, and the governor-general resumed office on the Assembly ratifying the arrangement; since when Meshed has remained quiet. Major Sykes telegraphed on the I Oth July that the Assembl} 7 ' and the governor-general were co-operating successfully for peace. The Assembly guard of twenty men was alone armed, and confidence was restored. Set stun. Hissam-ed-Dowleh summoned the principal people of Birjand to meet him on the 21st May and the Shah’s proclamation was read and the members of the late local assembly were informed that, pending reorganisation, they would be considered to represent the local assembly. The Meshed assembly subsequently declined to order fresh elections so the former members retain their seats. The Meshed assembly has informed Hissam-ed-Dowleh that he will be held responsible for all revenues collected by him. This is said to have caused him some uneasiness. Ispahan. The town has, generally speaking, remained quiet, though in some cases the tribesmen have been guilty of offences against order. Sidtanabad. Writing on the 1st July His Majesty’s acting vice-consul stated that in the province of Irak lawlessness was rapidly increasing and robberies were reported daily. The Lurs had driven off the cattle of many villages and several villages had been pillaged. The peasants dared not leave their homes, the roads were unsafe and communication would soon be at a standstill. As soon as the Bakhtiaris reached Kum a local assembly was started here. Its members had repeatedly asked the governor to give them an account of the revenue and then leave the place. The greater part of the assembly was composed of fanatical and troublesome people. The chief priest had invited the Bakhtiari to Sultanabad. [824] GYezd. Numerous robberies are reported on the various roads leading to Yezd. The Kerman road is frequented by bands of Arab tribesmen, numbering in two instances 130 and 200 men, who pillage caravans. A large number of camels have been carried off, and attempts to ransom the animals have only resulted in the ransom offered being seized as well as the animals. In one case yarn to the value of 1,500?. has been taken by robbers. One Khusru Khan, who some time ago attempted to raid lezd from the direction of Taft, is said to be planning a raid, but has not been encouraged by the Taftis. The escort of the .Governor of Nain recently deserted and left for Tehran, robbing the villages they passed through. The Parsee reported stabbed in the last summary is recovering. The robberies and extortion to which the Parsees are exposed continue, and their appeals to the local authorities are without result. Kerman. Nizam-es-Sultaneh has not yet left Tehran to take up the governorship of Kerman. Bashir-i-Khakan was appointed deputy governor early in June, and has done what little he can to carry on the administration ; but as there is no revenue coming in, no salaries can be paid. The soldiers on duty at the consulates and at the houses of Europeans deserted at the end of May. Kerman itself remains quiet because in the face of the common danger all the respectable people have sunk their differences and are eager to show an united front to lawlessness and plunder. Outside the town, from all sides the story is the same; there is robbery with or without murder, according as resistance is offered or not. At Bafsinjan the Governor, Bifat-ed-Dowleh, after making a spirited and successful attack on some Arab robbers, fled leaving the town open to certain reprisals. The Baluchis have been raiding in Narraashir, and up to the 10th June eighteen persons had been killed. The fort of Mirabad had been captured. A village not many miles west of Kerman, was looted by Arab robbers and three or four villagers were killed. The Afshar tribe is split into factions, but His Majesty’s consul anticipates that they may combine to raid Kerman. A telegram from His Majesty’s consul received at Tehran on the 11th July, stated that news had been received that the Baluchi tribe intended moving shortly on Bam and Kerman. The news was telegraphed to Kerman from Dehanneh, to which it had been brought by the headman of a Baluchi village. Kermanshah. Zahir-ed-Dowleh arrived on the 13th June and assumed the governorship. Shiraz. The early part of June was marked by a violent development of the quarrel between the Kawami brothers and the governor-general. With this in view the quarrel between Ata-ed-Dowleh and the Kawami was composed, and the demand for the former’s resignation was dropped. Nasr-ed-Dowleh arrived on the 31st May. He claimed to have been ambushed by a strong force of Kashgais some miles from Shiraz, and to have driven them off with heavv loss. On the 25th June, the Kawam informed Mr. Bill that if Zil-es-Sultan were appointed governor-general of Ears, he and his brother would gladly leave for Europe immediately His Highness arrived. Early in July the situation became threatening owing to the governor-general inviting Soulet-ed- Dowleh and the Lari Seyyid to Shiraz to help him against the Kawamis. In the opinion of both consuls the immediate dismissal of the governor-general was necessary to preserve order. The difficulty was to find a suitable successor. Finally, His Majesty’s Minister and the Bussian charge d’affaires arranged for the announcement of the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan as governor-general, although His Highness is still in Europe. This announcement has had a calming effect, and it is believed that a dangerous situation has thus been averted. Persian Gulf. Bushire. On the 4th July His Majesty’s consul-general reported that the chief priests at Nejef were believed to be organising a bond Jide nationalist movement in the Persian Gulfand the south of Pema. On the 5th July Major CW received a letter from the local assembly, in which that body announced its intention, in view of untoward incidents occurring elsewhere, of assuming control of the administration, including the customs, the receipts of which would be deposited m the Imperial Bank of Persia in the name ot the nation, the assembly undertook to recognise His Maiesty’s Govern ments claim on the customs on the production of documents, and to pay such interest and principal as were due from Bnshire and Bunder Abbas customs receipts. It also undertook that all obligation^to the British, Silch as honourable treatment of consular officials and protection of British subjects w&lt;oiild be scrupulously observed. In conclusion, the assembly asked for the co-operation of the British authorities in the preservation of the rights ot the Persian nation, and particularly concurrence in the above arrange- ment. It appeared that the assembly’s action was the result of orders from Neief and Tabreez. The main object was to prevent the Shah getting the customs receipts. In reply to a request for his views, Major Cox said he would have to communicate with His Majesty s Mimstei before giving an official reply. His personal view was that the intended action of the assembly was precipitate and uncalled for, and likely to bring about the veiy state of things everyone wished to avoid. There was no reactionary element in the Gulf ports, so the assembly could well afford to wait and see what happened at Tehran. Major Cox sent the assembly a verbal reply to this effect. Major Cox s language to the assembly was approved by His Majesty’s Government, and he was instructed to add, if occasion offered, that the advance on Tehran of the Bakhtiaris and the Kazvm revolutionaries at the moment when the constitution was re-established had brought about the present crisis. Bunder Abbas. I he state of unrest recently prevailing here seems to have subsided during May, owing to Seyyid Abdul Hussain Lari’s attention being occupied elsewhere. The seyyid had ceased to threaten the town, and confined himself to sending orders to his agents at Bunder Abbas to buy arms and ammunition for him, to be sent to Lar. The governor-general of the Gulf ports having announced his intention to send 200 soldiers to protect the town against the seyyid, the deputy governor replied that they were not required. Lingah. Seyyid Abdul Hussain Lari being occupied in resisting Nasr-ed-Dowleh in Lar his men were withdrawn from the vicinity of Lingah, where tranquillity prevailed during May. The deputy governor, considering the presence of a Lari, Haji Ali, detrimental to the public peace, expelled him from the town. C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attache. No. 177. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.-—-(Received August 3.) Sir, St. Petersburg]!, July 28, 1909. THE Minister for Foreign Affairs has spoken to me several times during the last ten days regarding the situation in Tabreez and in the adjoining region. On the 18th instant his Excellency stated that the condition of affairs in Tabreez was most unsatisfactory, and that he had instructed the Russian charge d’affaires at Tehran to impress on the Persian Government the necessity of immediately sending a governor- general to the town, with the force necessary to establish his authority, iailing which, Russia would he compelled herself to take the steps necessary for the protection of her interests. On my enquiring what had occurred to call for these instructions, M. Isvolsky referred to Sattar Khan having announced that he was to he appointed governor- general, a thing which the Russian Government would no doubt have considered intolerable ; and he also spoke of extortion being practised on the residents by fedais masquerading as policemen, and of an agitation being fomented against the presence of the Russian troops. He gave me to understand that if the Persian Government failed to establish law and order without delay, it would become necessaiy foi Russia to take the measures required. [824] . G 2On tlie following da} 7 his Excellency again spoke to me on the same subject, hut he now seemed to take a less unfavourable view of the situation. He had been, informed by the Turkish Ambassador of instructions having been sent to the Turkish consulate-general to the effect that it was desirable that Sattar and Bagher Khans should leave Persia, but that if they were unwilling to do so, they should no longer be permitted to remain in the consulate-general. His Excellency added that there was a general condition of unrest at Tabrecz which made it urgently necessary that a governor should proceed to the spot without delay. H. Sazonoff, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, mentioned to me yesterday that he had no news of the departure for Tabreez of the newly appointed governor-general, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. M. Sazonoff stated that he had 'received no news of a disquieting character from Tabreez during the last two or three days. M. Isvolsky has also more than once spoken to me of Ardebil as a possible source of danger, owing to the intolerable depredations committed in the vicinity by the Shahsevan tribe. I have, &amp;c. HUGH O’BEIRNE. No. 178. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—Received August 3.) (Telegraphic.) # # # Guldhek, August s, 1909. MY Russian colleague, on instructions from his Government, is again making strong representations to the Persian Government with regard to the disorders created bv the Shahsevan tribes at Ardebil, on which I reported in my telegram of the 22nd July. He has now presented to the Persian Government a note, warning them that Russia will herself send a detachment of troops into this district unless within two days a capable and energetic governor, accompanied by a suitable force, has actually started for Ardebil. I am giving my support to M. Sabline’s demand concerning the governor and the escort to accompany him. No. 179. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 3.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 3, 1909. I HAVE small hope of our succeeding in inducing the ex-Shah and the present Government to come to terms on the question of the jewels, &amp;c., unless we bring strong pressure to bear, and my Russian colleague and 1 are now pressing upon both parties a compromise by which the Persian Government would increase His late Majesty’s civil list to 50,000 tomans, and the latter surrender the jewels now in dispute.

Twelve miles outside the town Soulet-ed-Dowleli s force of at least 2,000 men is encamped., I instructed His Majesty’s consul to endeavour to persuade him not to advance. He has consented to delay three days before occupying the town. He insists, however, that Ala-ed-Dowleh’s appointment be cancelled. I am bringing this to the notice of the Persian Government.85 No. 181. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-^(Received August- 4.) (lelegraphic.) Tehran, August 4, 1909. Ml telegram of the 3rd August. Russian charge d affaires tells me that he is promised a note from the Persian Government by this evening, announcing departure of a strong governor for Ardehil with a strong escort. I AM informed by Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs that no preparations have as yet been made for the dispatch of a Russian expedition to Ardebil, and that the question is not an immediate one. As yet all that has been done is to decide in principle that an expedition must be sent in the event of the Persian Government failing to restore tranquillity in that region. The matter will come up for discussion again in four or five days (see Sir G. Barclay’s telegram of the 3rd August). sentatives of the Nationalist committee, to which I referred in my telegram of the 3rd August, have resulted in the signing of a protocol by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, some members of the committee, and the dragomans of the two legations ; it is to the following effect:— Article 1. All jewels in His Majesty’s possession which are found after an investigation conducted before representatives of the two legations to belong to the Crown to be given up. Art. 2. His Majesty will also give up all documents relating to jewels which have been pawned. Persian Government may, if it chooses, redeem these. Art. 3. Persian Government will give His Majesty 75,000 tomans a-year, payable half-yearly in advance through the Russian bank. Art. 4. A list of missing jewels will be presented to the two legations, who will obtain all possible information from His Majesty as to their whereabouts, and if they are still in His Majesty’.s possession or that of his entourage legations will do their utmost to recover them. Art. 5. If any jewels are sold by His Majesty after the 3rd August, their value will be deducted from His Majesty’s civil list. Art. 6. His Majesty will leave Tehran not later than the 17th August. Yesterday the investigation laid down in article 1 was held, and after considerable pressure had been brought to bear, the ex-Shah handed over a great number of jewels which, he had hitherto maintained, belonged to him personally.

He mentioned the appointment as head of police at Tehran of a Russian Caucasian guilty of crimes committed in Russia as an instance of the unsatisfactory state of affairs. I said that it was for the Russian Government to decide what measures taken by the Persian Government in Northern Persia would inspire such confidence that the Russian Government would withdraw their troops. We would then co-operate in urging on the Persian Government the adoption of those measures. No. 185. Mr. O'Beirne to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 6.) (Telegraphic.)

Sazonow, who observed that the immediate departure of Mohammed Ali was much desired by the Imperial Government, but he had some apprehension lest after His Majesty had left ratification might be refused by the Medjliss to the arrangement arrived at respecting His Majesty’s pension ; he assumed that the sanction of the legislature would be necessary for this arrangement. The ex-Shah also owed a large debt to the Russian bank in Tehran, and this was a further source of difficulty. These points are to be discussed by M. Sazonow with the Minister of Finance. No. 186.

IA \ E the honour to place before you a memorandum on the prevailing condition of the trade routes within the sphere of my post, more especially of the Bushire-Shiraz route, drawn up for me by His Majesty’s vice-consul.87 Iain well aware that His Majestys Government are generally cognisant of the deplorable condition of insecurity into which all the main arteries of traffic in Southern Persia have been tin own by the chronic state of chaos and anarchy under which the country has been labouring for the past three years. The situation in the capital has now reached a well-marked stage, at which it seems possible that an opening may at any time offer itself for some definite action or form of co-operation on 0111 part with the central Government, in whatever form it may now be, foi the lestoration of order or the financing of reforms. I trust, therefore, that the present moment may not prove inopportune for the submission of the present note on the commercial outlook. I have, &amp;c. P, /. COX, Major, British Resident in the Persian Gulf, and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for Fars, dec. Inclosure in No. 188. Memorandum respecting the Disorders on the Trade Routes of Southern Persia. THE state of trade in Southern Persia is at the present time most seriously affecting British interests. This is especially true of Fars. The result of two years’ fighting amongst the Ivashgai, Lur, and Arab tribes, in the neighbourhood of Shiraz, and along the caravan routes leading to that trade centre was, in the first place, to render the dispatch of goods into the districts normally fed by Shiraz quite unsafe, and, in consequence, to cause an overflooding and congestion of goods in Shiraz itself. This market, like that of Bushire, has subsisted for years almost entirely on British credit; during the current period of unrest bills have had to be met, and to find money goods have had to be disposed of, usually at a heavy loss. On the other hand, the British firms have found outstandings ever harder and harder to get in, and at the best their accounts are often only partially settled. In addition to the insecurity prevailing round Shiraz and along the Ispahan road, and the outlying buying centres, bad harvests and the political troubles have further undermined the position of all trade in Southern Persia. Two-and-a-half years of this state of affairs have damaged the stability of most Persian traders ; there has been no chance of making losses good ; many bankruptcies have occurred in Bushire, and enquiries at which 1 have been present have brought home to me the heavy losses incurred by some British firms, and the jeopardy into which the capital, which all firms have outstanding, is already thrown. A British Indian firm of Bombay, established for more than fifty years in Bussorah and Bushire, is closing up its Bushire branch. Messrs, David Sassoon and Co. (Limited) had, so.I understood, some time ago more than 50,000/. outstanding from their Bushire office, though this has since been considerably reduced ; and we were informed at one time that this very old house in Persia w 7 ere threatening to withdraw altogether unless something was done to help British trade over the Shiraz route. • ^ t Messrs. Dixon and Co. have large sums outstanding due to then Bushne office alone, and their affairs in Ispahan are said to be in an unsatisfactory position. Messrs. Livingstone, Zeytoon, and Co. (Limited), a new film, have found then venture so far quite unprofitable. Messrs. Gray, Paul, and Co. have practically ceased dealing in merchandise, and confine themselves to the work of a shipping agency. Piece-goods have not been coming forward in any quantity for the past three months. The year March 1908-9 has seen the import of Manchestei goods alone mto Bushire reduced from 439,937?. to 318,3751. ; the year 1909-10 promises to he infinitely condition of reasonable security and prosperity. [824] worse, the first quarter’s figures being only 41,5bok . The question on which everything primarily hinges is the safety of the caravan routes. The importance of this has been repeatedly pressed by one officer after another even when the province of Fars was in relatively good or 01 , am &lt; le ma ei is far more urgent now. . . , ^ in The proclamation, or even the inception, of a constitution does not m itself offer any probability of the slightest improvement m the safety of the Busline Shiraz . the Bunder Abbas—Kerman routes. It must take yeais o ning aisExtortion by Khans along Roads. The local chieftains along the 180 miles of the Bushire-Shiraz road have become independent of the governor-general of Ears, and are in a constant state of warfare with each other. The posts are tampered with and robbed everj^ few weeks. Despite the specific engagement entered into by the Persian Government in the commercial convention of 1903, article 4, rahdari is extorted by armed tribesmen along the route in ever-increasing amounts. A statement of these exactions is appended. A sum of 1 kran is even extracted by the Kalantar at the gate of Bushire, and when protest was made in 1907 the local governor simjoly replied that he was powerless, as the Minister of Finance still included this item in the schedule of revenue which the governors of Bushire have to make good ; if the Persian Government would erase the item from the schedule, he, the governor, would cause the levy to be discontinued. Caravans are liable to be molested at all points and on evei-y route leading from Bnshire. The deviation from Shief, situated 9 miles from Bushire by sea, has been alluded to in all recent trade reports. It is shunned by all British and the principal Persian merchants on account of its many inconveniences and reputation for pilferages. The khan of Angoli, desirous of the caravan route passing through his territory—the exclu sive right of which he has for three years past tried to obtain by large bribes offered to local governors—loses no opportunity which fortune or a weak governor may place in his way of coercing muleteers, by imposts or by detention of mules, into using the Shief-Daliki road. Only lately he exacted a fine of 50 tomans (approximately 101.) besides “ rahdari ” dues from an unprotected caravan of 70 mules, which was approaching Bushire by the main route, which borders on his land. State of the Main Route. The u Imperial ” road, passing through Borazjun, Daliki, and up the mountains to Kazerun, nowin use for many years past, has been blocked for the last two months by the great feud which has joined the khan of Kumarij and the headman of Daliki and the khan of Borazjun. Report says that disputes about the passage of caravans have been the origin of the feud. Fighting has been heavy, and the narrow passes in the hands of^ the combatants. The dangers of the present situation are shown by the recent firing on the Russian acting consul-general, although he was travelling with an escort of Cossacks. The telegraph office at Konar Takhte has been a centre for opera tions. In 1908 the unrest was focussed a little further on, between Kumarij and Kazerun; 1907 was marked by troubles in the Kashgai tribe between Kazerun and Shiraz and by a series of postal robberies. I he main route being so hampered for traffic, native merchants in Shiraz have been of late endeavouring to arrange with the Kashgai Ilkhani for the transport of caravans by the Firuzabad route, which, in its course to Bushire, traverses Dashti territory, a district inhabited by a very lawless population, and Tangistan. The absence of the telegraph on this route and the likelihood of robbery occurring without the slightest chance of compensation being obtained, and other difficulties in the shape of dearth of forage, provisions, and caravan accommodation make British merchants very charv of trusting their goods to it. Dearth of Transport. Another serious feature has been the dearth of mule transport which has arisen. Muleteers have been so ill-treated and so plagued by robbers and “ roadguards ” during the past two years that a very large number have forsaken the route altogether and gone to the Yezd road or even more north still, to the Resht road. The result is that even when a short spell of comparative tranquillity does occur, merchants cannot depend upon being able to get transport. Wheieas in 1905 from 5,000 to / ,000 mules are stated to have been constantly engaged between Bushire and Shiraz, now in 1909 a British forwarding agency and leisian mule-brokeis estimate them at between 2,000 and 3,000. Some 1,500 Shiraz mules are stated to have forsaken the Bushire road for the Resht and Kermanshah routes (which aie not in the British sphere of influence). Ko large caravan had come down from Shiraz to Bushire from March to June 1909, and then only via Firuzabad.Price of Transport. The price of transport has risen to such an extent that it has become a burden on trade. The following figures show clearly the rise from the normal since the period of anarchy commenced Krans. 1900 .. 1901 .. 1902 .. 1904 .. 1905 .. March 1906-7 „ 1907-8 „ 1908-9 „ 1909-10 per 737 lb., 185 miles 90, 80, 60 95-80-100-110 80 80-90 85-95-75-95-110 150-220-140-150 160-120-110-90-140 140-160-170-220 200-250-300 (Or a rise from, approximately, 11. 9s. to hi. 3s.) Insurance. A further proof of the straits to which commerce has been reduced along the Shiraz road is shown in the premium rates of insurance companies in England. Formerly 15s. per 1001. was accepted by most underwriters for cotton bales from Manchester to Shiraz and Ispahan, and included risk of robbery. In 1907 the rate was 30s., I think; while in 1908 the long list of robberies had sent the rate up to 40s., and very few companies could be found to accept the risk. By April 1909 practically all insurance to Shiraz was refused in England, war risks being asked, which means hi. to 101. per 100k . The result is that the risk of robbery between Bushire and Shiraz rails on tire British exporter, not on the insurance company as hitherto, nor on the Persian buyer. Recovery of Claims. Recovery of claims was, up till 1906, frequently effected from the Ears Government, but during the last eighteen months claims for British merchandise stolen on t e Bushire—Shiraz road, with a value of 3,810 tomans (approximately 6 l0l), ha've been left unsettled and unattended to by the Persian authorities. These claims were advanced by British agencies alone. Prospects of Order being restored. Lawlessness is so far advanced on the Bushire-Shiraz route that it is doubtful if any governor-general of Ears will have the necessary influence and troops to restore ° r Persians concerned in the forwarding business to the interior appear to look to the British authorities alone for the necessary power to replace the road on a secure footing and repress illegal exactions. &lt; ^ . . , , e A seyyid, one of the two principal Persian merchants m Bushire, told me a few days ago that, in his belief, matters would become even worse than what they were, and that possibly, besides entailing grave political results, would certainly mean the ruination of Persian traders on a large scale, with the resultant effects on t le n as Te prevailing disorders on the two southern roads have had the effect of depreciating the receipts of the southern customs to an amount which qmte fads to suffice for 7he interest due towards the British loan and the interest pledged on the customs to the Imperial Bank of Persia. It is proposed to draw attention elsewhere to the disastrous effect which wholesale smuggling is having on the stability of many traders, but it is indnectlj connected with the road question. H. G. CHICK.91 No. 189. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 9.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 9, 1909. HIS Majesty’s acting consul-general at Tabreez telegraphed to me yesterday as follows;— “ I learn from Russian consul-general that a relative of the Maku khans has sought refuge in Russian vice-consulate at Bayazid, with the object of obtaining Russian pro tection for the khanate, which he declares the nationalists are threatening.” M. Sabline is recommending to his Government that he be authorized, in concert with me, to urge upon the Persian Government the advisability of proclaiming a general amnesty. By this means the disorders entailed by such movements as that directed against Maku, which the nationalists appear to have in view, would be avoided ; and the constant applications for protection from nervous reactionaries, with which my Russian colleague is being plagued, would no longer trouble the two legations. I fully concur in M. Sablines recommendation, and think that we might suggest that the amnesty should take the same lines as that put forward in the programme of reforms which we submitted to the late Shah. No. 190.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received August 11.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 11, 1909. THE Nationalists have taken Zil-es-Sultan back to Resht, where he is being kept in confinement. I have again received an application for my intervention from his son, who is afraid that the Persian Government may attempt to extort money from His Imperial Highness. Although, in my opinion, the Zil cannot reasonably base any claim to our protection after his complete neglect of our advice, I, nevertheless, propose to inform the Persian Government that I hope that His Imperial Highness will be allowed to leave Persia in safety. In making this recommendation, I propose to ask for the support of my Russian colleague. No. 194. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 12.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 12, 1909. AS foreshadowed in my telegram of the 10th August, the Persian Government have revoked Ain-ed-Dowleh’s appointment to the governorship-general of Ears, and have appointed in his place Saham-ed-Dowleh, who has as yet only held unimportant governorships. There is now a noticeable tendency, coinciding with Taki Zadeh’s return to Tehran, to give governorships to men who are new to provincial administration rather than to those who have had large experience of it in the past. In this way it is hoped that the corrupt methods which have hitherto distinguished local government in Persia may the more easily be abolished. No. 195.

WITH reference to my despatch, of the 17th June, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the new Electoral Law, dated the 1st July, as finally promulgated. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 198. Electoral Regidations for the National Assembly. Preface. WHEREAS, in accordance with the exigencies of the time, it became necessary to alter some of the articles of the National Assembly’s Electoral Regulations, in pursuance of the commands of His Imperial Majesty Mohammed Ali Shah (may God immortalize his reign !) a number of well-wishers of the nation, in conjunction with the members of the Council of State, formed a committee of twenty persons by a vote of the majority, to prepare a new' Regulation. As reference was made to four articles of the fundamental laws concerning the matter of elections, and the alteration of these articles was in contravention of those principles, in order to overcome this objection the above-mentioned committee s 11 ' - mitted the important articles of the amended Regulation to the consideration of the well-wishers in the more important provinces of Persia. ^ ^ . The important provincial centres transferred rights of supervision to the Azer bar)an capital. The learned of that centre approved in principle the modification of the four articles, and submitted their observations on the other principal articles. Therefore, taking into consideration the observations of the Azerbaijan capital, the piesent regu a- tions have been drawn up and written, on condition that the National Assembly, a ter its opening, shall be at liberty to exercise the right, according to the powers conferred upon it by the fundamental law's, to ratify or modify any one of its articles as may ie deemed advisable.

The elections in the whole of Persia will be by two deo-rees. Explanation (A).—The meaning of “ election by two degrees ” is that first in the quarters of a town or m the towns of an electoral district a particular number (of95 persons) are chosen—who are called “ the elected”—and afterwards, these (persons) elected in the first degree meet at the centre of the electoral district and elect from among them selves the desired number; and these persons so elected in the second degree are called “representatives.” Explanation (B). —The meaning of “electoral district” is that portion of the kingdom which, in accordance with the regulations, elects one or more persons collectively to be members of the National Assembly ; if even that portion (of the kingdom) should be under one or more governors. The centre of a district is that spot where the elections in the second degree for that district take place. Art. 16. The elections in the first and second degree will in general be conducted on the plural vote system, excepting in such places where, in accordance with the distribution provided by the regulations, they have not the right to vote for more than one person, in which case the elections will be conducted on the single vote system. Explanation. —The meaning of “ plural voting ” is that every voter will inscribe on his voting paper the names of all the persons to be elected for that district; the single vote system is that every voter will inscribe on his voting paper the name of one person. Art. 17. The elections in the first degree will be by a relative majority ; and the elections in the second degree will be by a full majority. Explanation. —The meaning of a “ full majority ” is that more than half the electors give their votes in favour of an individual. Art. 18. Those persons wdio obtain a full majority of votes from the total number of electors of the electoral district will be accepted as members of the National Assembly, independently of the second degree election. Art. 19. In the elections of the second degree, if on the first and second occasion a full majority is not acquired by a candidate, the same person can be elected on the third occasion by a relative majority. Art. 20. In case of equal votes being given to two or more persons, and should it be necessary to choose one from among them, that person shall be chosen by lot. Art. 21. In the elections of the first degree the number of persons to be elected for each division will be three times the number for that division stipulated in Ait. Art. 22. In the Tehran electoral district the elections in the first degree will be conducted in five quarters of the town, each of which, under the diiection of a Mayor, in accordance with the arrangements to be made by the supei vising committee. Art. 23. In the provincial electoral districts the election in each town of that district will be on a relative majority basis. Afterwards these persons elected m the first degree will meet in the centre of the district on the date fixed by the central supei- vising committee, and they will all together elect from among themse \es } a \ o e o the majority the number of deputies provided for in Art. 2. ^ . „ , . , Art. 24. The five principal tribes—Shahsevan of Azerbaijan, Bakhtiari, K ash gap t e Khamseh tribes of Fars, and the Turkomans will, in accordance wit 1 1 e stipu a lon ® of the regulations, each send a deputy direct to the National Assem y. ie e ec oia system for the tribes is also of two degrees. The number of electors m the first egr e for each tribe, however, and the electoral centre m the first degree, will be fixed by the Ministry of the Interior. In this case the elections of the second degree wdl be by lot Art. 25.

Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 16.) Sir, Gulahek, July 23, 1909. IN continuation of my despatch of the 12th instant I have the honour to report that- ' the nationalist forces entered Tehran at 6 o’clock in the morning of the 13th instant. The enclosed memorandum by Mr. Churchill gives an account of the circumstances of their entry and the fighting that ensued. On learning by telephone what had happened, I sent Major Stokes and Mr. Churchill, to town, the former to control the admission of refugees to the legation, and the latter to watch the course of events and report. Both were, if possible, to get into touch with Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, and enjoin upon them the necessity of main taining order. The news which reached me by telephone just before it was cut was to the effect that the nationalist forces were in possession of the town, and that good order reigned. It transpired later that this was not accurate ; only a portion of the capital v^as in their possession, and street fighting was in progress in other parts of the town. Mr. Churchill and M. Evreinow, whom M. Sabline had sent to town, were able later to report that Sipahdar and Sardar Assad had given them the most satisfactory assurances as regards the safety of foreign interests at the hands of the nationalists. Throughout the fighting there was of course danger from stray bullets ; but, so far as I know, only one foreigner, an Austrian, was hit, and his wound was slight. There was absolutely no looting on the part of the nationalists, though one British house was cleared of everything by some of the armed irregulars who fought on the royalist side. These rrere the only persons who did any looting. The assurances given by the nationalist leaders to the representatives of the two legations were thus justified. Soon after the fighting began in town, a report reached me that the Shah was about to bombard Tehran, and M. Sabline and I agreed to send in a joint protest to His Majesty. I drafted a stiff note, which we afterwards toned down, as in the meantime my colleague had received from the Shah a private assurance that the bombardment would not take place. Early next morning, however, we heard the boom of guns in the direction of Kasr Kajar, and it was clear that the Shah had broken his promise. A little later His Majesty sent us word that he had intended not to bombard Tehran without giving twenty- four hours’ notice so as to give time to foreigners to leave the town, but that the revolu tionaries were attacking his palace in the capital and he therefore had been compelled to begin the bombardment at once. My colleague and I immediately proceeded to Sultanatabad and begged His Majesty to desist and to proclaim a truce for negotiations. In reply he proceeded to complain that we had repeated!}^ tied his hands by dissuading him from attacking the^ revolutionaries. These had now entered Tehran and were attacking his palace. TVe could not expect him not to do his utmost to oppose them. I inally he declared that he would only grant a truce if the revolutionaries laid down their arms. _ Except for the rescue of Tabreez, it is not the case that the Shah has ever been restrained in his plans against the revolutionaries, but I did not think it worth while entering upon a discussion on this point. I therefore merely reminded His Majesty that the role of the two legations, since he had restored the constitution, had been to urge conciliation upon both sides; unfortunately our advice had not been followed by the revolutionaries. It was urgent now to consider what could be done to save the situation, and, in the opinion of the two representatives, the only hope lay in His Majesty proclaiming a truce. He said it would be impossible, as he could not communicate with his troops, who were surrounded and were being constantly attacked. In these circumstances an indispensable preliminary was that the revolutionaries should lay down their arms. W e replied that it was useless to expect the victors to consent to this, but if His Majesty would proclaim a truce for negotiations we thought we could arrange that the message should reach both revolutionaries and ro 3 T alists. His Majesty, however, would not hear of this and repeated that the revolutionaries must first surrender. On leav ing the palace we met Saad*ed“Dowleh, who, on learning the barren results of our representations, asked us to defer informing Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, whom we had apprised of our audience, until he had seen His Majesty. Meanwhile, Mi. Chiu chill and M. Baranowsky, who had been sent early in the morning, at the lequest of the Shah, to try to induce the nationalist leaders to negotiate, had had to tnrn back because of the fighting, which was then at its hottest. 1 Saad-ed-DowlelTs com eisation with His Majesty, it may here be said, led to the appointment of a deputa-101 tion with the object of opening negotiations, but there was delay in getting some of the members to accept the task, and after the deputation was finally formed a first attempt to enter the town failed. When it eventually succeeded in getting into the capital two days later, the Shah had already .taken bast in the Russian Legation and Colonel Liakhow had made terms. Some hours after our audience it was rumoured that Colonel Liakhow, who was defending the Cossack barracks, could not hold out much longer. My colleague hoped that before it came to this point the Shah would have taken bast, in which case Colonel Liakhow, whose mission would then ipso facto have terminated, would have been able to make terms without actually surrendering; and, indeed, M, Sabline, when I saw him in the afternoon, believed that the Shah would arrive that evening. He told me that he had sent M. Evreinow to discuss terms for Colonel Liakhow’s surrender with the two Sardars. M. Evreinow proceeded to Baharistan, the nationalist head-quarters, and requested the two Sardars to desist from attacking the Cossack barracks. He asked what would be done with the officers and men if they delivered up their arms—whether they would be allowed to continue their service under the future Persian Government, and whether the Nationalist leaders could guarantee that as far as possible they would run no danger. To this the Sardars replied that the nationalists had always acted on the defensive, and that after the officers and men of the Cossack brigade had handed over their arms there would be no necessity for the nationalists to defend themselves any longer. The Cossacks would be free to go to their homes or remain in their barracks as non-combatants. The Sardars added that the constitutional Government would be in need of well-organised troops, and therefore the Cossacks would be used and would continue to receive their usual pay. Their safety after laying down their arms would be guaranteed as far as possible. M. Evreinow returned to Zergandeh with this answer, but, owing to the bombardment from Kasr Kajar, he could not get mto Tehran the following day, the 15th, to continue the negotiations, and the fighting in parts of the town continued. M. Sabline was not satisfied with the terms offered by the nationalists to the brigade. We agreed that Mr. Churchill and M. Barauowsky should early the following morning, the 16th, make the best of their way to Baharistan and endeavour to obtain a satisfactory undertaking in writing. By the time they started, the Shah, ids family, and a number of his entourage, including Naib-es-Saltaneh, Amir^ Bahadur Jang, Mufakher-ul-Mulk, and Mujallah-es-Sultan, had taken bast in the Russian legation. We at once informed Sipahdar and Sardar Assad by telegraph, and took steps to make it known as widely as possible. Colonel Liakhow’s mission had now ended, and he could surrender with honour. Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky succeeded in making their way to Baharistan, and obtained from the ^ nationalist leaders a written undertaking that the Russian officers and the Cossack brigade should continue for the present to serve the new Government under the orders of the Minister of Vv ar. Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky were able to inform Colonel Liakhow of this undertaking, and he was asked to come to the Imperial Bank, whither a Bakhtian chief would be sent to escort him to Baharistan. The bank was conveniently situated ioi this purpose, being between the opposing forces. Colonel Liakhow reached the bank with an escort of Cossacks, which he afterwards dismissed, and on the arrival ot iusut Khan, Sardar Assad’s brother, he proceeded in the carriage with him, under Bakhtian and fedai escort, accompanied by the two dragomans, to Baharistan, where he placed himself and his brigade at the service of the new Government. It is perhaps wortli mentioning that in his drive to Baharistan Colonel Liakhow was cheered all along t le Desultory firing continued for a while in certain parts of the capital, but by the evening the town was perfectly quiet. A meeting of nationalist notables-uin extra ordinary grand council, as it was styled—was held in_ the afternoon at Baharistan, and decided to proclaim the abdication of Muhammad Ah and the appointment of t le Yali Ahd, Sultan Ahmad, as his successor, with Azad-ul-Mulk as temporary Regent. The council also elected Sipahdar as Minister of War and Sardar Assad as Minister of the Interior, and appointed a committee of twenty-five leading nationalists lor the guidance of the Ministers. The proclamation of the change of Sovereigns was not at once issued, the committee desiring first to announce it to Muhammad Ah by a depu a- tion. The dispatch of this deputation was contemplated for the following day, and a telegram from Sipahdar and Sardar Assad was received by the two legations on uo following morning announcing the committee’s intention, and asking us to ascertain when Prince Muhammad AH would receive the deputation. My Russian colleague [824] J1waited upon the ex-Shah with this message, to which His Majesty replied that, “ having left Sultanatabad he bad already abdicated. It was therefore unnecessary for him to receive any deputation.” This reply we telegraphed to the nationalist leaders. Although the Shah’s successor was not named in the Sardar’s telegram, Muhammad Ali knew that the Valiahd had been selected, and a painful scene ensued after His Majesty had directed M. Sabline as to the reply to the nationalist leaders. His Majesty declared to my Russian colleague that he would not allow his favourite son to be separated from his parents, and for a time, indeed, it seemed that he would stand firm on this point. The Valiahd’s mother, who kept appearing from time to time in the doorway, quite broke down. Finally, however, the Shah asked M. Sabline to arrange that if the Valiahd was placed on the throne he should be allowed to travel abroad with his mother for a time, or, failing this, that his second son might be made Shah. M. Sabline left His Majesty under the impression that we would endeavour to obtain the consent of the committee to one of these alternatives, but on talking it over together we thought that the proposed step might jeopardise the chances of the dynasty. We had reason to fear that the nationalists might snatch at the opportunity offered by Muhammad Ali’s hesitation to allow his eldest son to accept the throne, to look elsewhere for a candidate. We felt, too, that the first proposal was one which would certainly not'be entertained, as we knew the nationalists to be eager to get the boy away from his surroundings ; and as regards the second alternative, even if the nationalists agreed, we felt that the Valiahd would later regret the action taken by his parents, in which case he might perhaps come forward as a pretender in later years. We accordingly decided not to put forward Muhammad Ali’s proposals, and it was soon evident that it was well that we had done so, for the Shah very shortly let M. Sabline know that we were in no case to run any risk of losing the throne for the dynasty. The proclamation announcing the change of Sovereign appeared in the afternoon, and the official notification was received by the legations on the following day, the 18th July. I enclose copies of both documents. It will be noticed that in the latter Muhammad Ali is declared to have been deposed, whereas in the proclamation he is stated to have abdicated spontaneously. On the same day, the 18th duly, the little Shah left the Russian Legation and proceeded under an escort from the two legations to the Palace of Sultanatabad, where he received a deputation from the grand council, who formally announced to him his elevation to the throne. I enclose an account of this ceremony by Major Stokes, who was present. Three days later, on the 21st instant, my Russian colleague and 1 officially notified the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that the two Governments recognised Sultan Ahmad as Shah of Persia. Before closing this despatch I should like to record my appreciation of the services during the recent crisis of Major Stokes, Mr. Churchill, and Major O’Connor, His Majesty’s consul in Seistan, who was staying in Tehran at the time and who placed himself at my disposal. All three did most useful work in town in circumstances of considerable danger. I should also like to mention the work of Dr. Scott, of the Indo- European Telegraph Department, who, having removed into the legation because his house was in the line of fire, did admirable service in attending the wounded brought into the legation. I did not allow Dr. Neligan to go to his assistance, as the approaches to the legation were dangerous and I did not wish anyone to run unnecessary risks, so that Dr. Scott did his work single handed. Lastly, I should wish to record my recognition of the good sense and calm shown by the British community. Not a single alarmist report reached me from a British source during the whole of the three days’ fighting, and this notwithstanding that several British houses, being in the line of fire, suffered considerably. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure 1 in No. 199. Memorandum by Mr. Churchill, July 16, 1909. ON the 9th July the forces under Sipahdar left Kerej, about 1,000 strong, in a south-easterly direction toward Robat Kerim, where Sardar Assad was encamped with about 1,200 Bakhtiaris. Amir Mufakham, the royalist Bakhtiari chief, with about 200 men, advanced at the same time to meet the Sipahdar; and the following morning when the Sipahdar’smixed force of Caucasians and Persians, which I will call “fedai ” for lack of a better term, met these Bakhtiaris they took them for Sardar Assad’s men. The royalists, who used the red flag of the nationalists, tried to take the fedai by surprise and to disarm them ; but the ruse was soon discovered and a sharp engagement took place, and the royalists withdrew. Later in the day Sardar Assad arrived on the scene, but the fedai, not distinguishing them from the royalists, fired upon them, killing five men and wounding many others. The mistake was discovered in time, and the two v^ciptcUIL /JcipUibiv^y, blippui bUll Uy lilt? OUclU b llltJgUlcllb dllU lilt/ lOyclUbl IJcllAlLli several guns, and maintained their position in the face of severe artillery fire. On the night of the 12th July the combined nationalist force marched between the opposing Cossacks and irregulars, who were posted at Shahabad, Ahmedabad, and Yaftabad, between them and Tehran. They succeeded in getting through unnoticed, and at 6 a.m. on the 13th July the whole nationalist force entered Tehran by the north or Yussufabad Gate, which was not held against them. They rode three abreast past the British Legation, and shortly afterwards, dividing into three columns, proceeded to the Baharistan or assembly building, which they reached practically without opposition. The soldiers on duty at the various guard-houses were disarmed without difficulty, though two or three men were killed and wounded at the guard house opposite the main gate of the legation. A column which descended the Legation Street towards the Artillery Square was fired upon by soldiers posted in the square, the various gates of which w T ere immediately closed. The three northern and the three eastern gates of the town w r ere immediately taken possession of by the Bakhtiari, but three western gates remained in the hands of the Cossacks. During the course of the morning Captain Zapolsky with the 400 Cossacks under him entered the town by one of these gates and joined Colonel Liakhow, who was throughout at the Cossack barracks in the western part of the town with 400 men. The remaining 300 Cossacks under Captain Peribinoszeff remained akSultan- atabad with the Shah, who had besides some 2,000 men under Amir Bahadur wdio have taken no part whatever in the hostilities. Throughout the three days on which hostilities lasted, viz., the 13th, 14th, and 15th July, the Cossacks remained on the defensive in and around their barracks, while an irregular force of some 300 absolutely undisciplined men held the Gun Square ; the main forces, under Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, held the rest of the town with their head quarters at the Baharistan, whilst a determined body of fedai crept gradually as close to the barracks as possible, using their Mausers with great effect and throwing bombs at night. ^ , On the 14th tbe Shah declared that he intended to stake his all on a determined combined attack on the town by all the forces at his disposal, and take refuge at the Russian Legation if it failed. The attack proved a complete^ failure. ; Captain Peribinoszeff shelled the Baharistan quarter from the hills near Kasr-i-Kajar, which covered an attack by some of the irregulars in the Dotchantupeh Gate. The Bakhtiaris however, appeared in such force to defend that approach that the attacking party fled in confusion, while the bombardment produced no impression wdiatever. Colonel Liakhow' endeavoured to shell the Baharistan at the same time, but the range must have been inaccurate, as a number of the shells exploded above the Imperial Bank, and one actually crashed through one of the rooms while I was there, without doing much ] iarm I spent the night at the Imperial Bank, and realised from experience the de moralising effect of the use by the fedai of bombs at night, when they were able to creep right up to the royalists’ positions and throw them. The most severe engage ment occurred in the direction of Mr. Barker’s house, which has suffered considerably from shell fire. In this quarter the fedai occupied houses and crept very close up to the Cossack barracks. . It was perfectly clear to anyone who could see what was actually going on at Tehran that, though it might be possible to keep up the fight for a considerable time, by avoiding big engagements, it was quite impossible for the Shah s forces to dislodge the nationalists, now strongly reinforced by their sympathisers m tlm town. But the Shah was assured by his Persian officers that victory might still be his. Consequently, the following day the 15th July, further attempts w^ere made by his irregulars to attack the crates, but the Cossacks remained entirely on the defensive. Every attack was however, repulsed with enormous loss for the royalists. During the day a small number of the royalist Bakhtiaris contrived to reach a house near the British Legation, and a great [824] H 4deal of firing went on between them and the u fedai.” The head of the legation gholams, who was standing at the main gate of the legation, was struck in the thigh by a bullet, but the wound is fortunately not dangerous, and he is progressing favourably. About 150 Armenians who live in the quarter, finding themselves in danger, took refuge in the legation, where at first Major Stokes, and later Major O’Connor, His Majesty’s consul for Seistan, who was in Tehran on his way to his post, was placed in charge. Dr. Scott and Mr. Baggaley, with their wives and Dr. Scott’s children, also came to the legation, as their houses were in the zone of fire and they were in some danger. The casualties in this part of the town were considerable, and wounded men were constantly being brought into the legation, where Dr. Scott formed a temporary hospital. I went over it on the 15th, when he had about ten patients, who had increased to fifteen by the following day, though several had died in the meantime. The wounds in some cases were of a shocking character, and I venture to say that Dr. Scott deserves the highest praise for the admirable way in which he has devoted himself to the wounded, and spared no pains single-handed to alleviate the sufferings of these poor men. On the 15th a number of shells exploded over the legation garden, and one, which failed to explode, actually fell in the garden. No damage has been done to the buildings. On the IGth the Shah took refuge at the Russian Legation and fighting ceased. I should also like to state that the British colony at Tehran has shown remarkable calmness throughout the three very trying days that these hostilities lasted. The staffs of the Imperial Bank and the Indo-European Telegraph Department and Company remained in town the whole time, and many of them went to their offices as usual through the quarters where fighting was going on, but I have not heard of a single murmur of complaint from any one of them. The correspondents—Mr. Fraser, of the “ Times,” and Mr. Maloney, of Reuter— were in town throughout, and even took their places in the trenches, from which they saw the fighting. I venture to state my absolute conviction that at no time have any foreigners been in any danger, excepting, of course, from stray bullets, provided they took normal precautions. The “fedai” and the Bakhtiaris show remarkable respect towards foreigners, and on my way from the bank to the legation I walked down a street occupied at one end by royalists and at the other by revolutionaries without the slightest danger of beiim shot at. ° Cn the three occasions on which I have driven to the Baharistan I have found the “ fedai ” most respectful, and the crowds assembled at the gates of the Medjliss always cheered the legation sowars and gholams. 1 G. P. CHURCHILL. Inclosure 2 in No. 199. Proclamation. AS the circumstances of the country of Persia show that the restoration of order and security in the country and the establishment of rights and confidence in the heait of the nation could not be restored without the change of Sovereign, and as the former Sovereign is perfectly aware of the great displeasure which the people entertain ton aids him, he therefore has taken refuge in the Russian Legation under the protection of Great Britain and Russia. His Majesty has spontaneously (or naturally) abdicated from the crown and throne of Persia. Iherefore in the absence of the Senate and the National Assembly an extraordinary Grand Council, in view of the necessities of the case, was convoked at once on Friday, the 27th Jamadi II, 1327 (16th July, 1909), in the lalaee of Baharistan in lehran. His Imperial Majesty, Sultan Ahmad Mirza, the Heir Apparent of Persia, has been appointed the Shah-in-Shah of Persia. For the present the regency has been confided to his Excellency Azad-ul-Mulk, so that after the convocation of Parliament, in accordance with article 38 of the constitutional law respecting the regency, and in accordance with the exigencies of the time, a definite arrangement will be made.

After the opening of Parliament, in accordance with article 38 of the fundamental law, a definite arrangement will be made regarding the regency'. We therefore address this official letter informing you of the deposition of Muhammad Ali Mirza and the accession of Sultan Ahmad Mirza to the sovereignty of Persia. Inclosure 4 in No. 199. Memorandum by Major Stokes respecting the reception of Sultan Ahmad Shah by a Deputation from the Provisional Government. MUHAMMAD ALI having taken refuge in the Russian Legation, and having refused to receive a deputation which was to announce to him the accession of his son Sultan Ahmad to the throne of Persia, the latter was proclaimed Shah on the 17th July. At 10 a.m, on the 18th July a deputation from the provisional Government awaited Sultan Ahmad Shah at the palace of Sultanatabad. The deputation consisted of the Regent, Azad-ul-Mulk, and the following priests and notables : — Agha Behbehani (son of Seyyid Abdullah,-Mujtehed). Agha Imamzadeh (son of the late and brother of the present Imam Juma, of Tehran). N i zam-ul-Mulk. Muwassak-ed-Dowleh (formerly comptroller of the household to Muzaffar-ed-Din Shah). Ala-ed-Dowleh. Ala-ul-Mulk. Sultan Ahmad Shah drove from the Russian Legation under an escort of Russian Cossacks and Indian sowars. In a second carriage were seated Muwassak-ul-Mulk, comptroller of the heir-apparent’s household, Zil-es-Sultaneh, cousin of Muhammad Ali, and two other Kajar Princes, M. Smirnoff, who for two or three years has been the new Shah’s tutor, followed the procession in his own carriage in order to tell the escort when it was no longer required. On arrival at Sultanatabad the combined escort withdrew. His Majesty alighted and walked from the gate of the garden to the palace. Some 30 yards from the building His Majesty was received by Azad-ul-Mulk, the venerable head of the Kajar tribe, who, in a kind but deferential manner, addressed a few words to him and invited him to enter the palace. The young Shah’s manner was dignified, but just at first he seemed a little nervous. The deputation awaited His Majesty in the palace, to which only Persians were admitted, where the following address was read to him :— “ To His Majesty Sultan Ahmad Shah. Long may his kingdom and rule endure. “As your Royal Sire, His Royal Highness Prince Muhammad Ali, has been excused from the important duty of Sovereign, in accordance with articles 36 and 37 of the fundamental laws, at an extraordinary council held on the 27th of Jamadi-us- Sani (16th July) in the Baharistan building, the sovereignty was conferred on your Imperial Majesty, and a proclamation was issued and the regency was temporarily entrusted to his Excellency Azad-ul-Mulk until, after the meeting of Parliament,according to article 38 of the fundamental laws, a final decision in the matter of the regency is given. “The above communication is on behalf of the Extraordinary Grand Council by the agency of the delegates of that Grand Council officially conveyed to the foot of your Imperial Majesty’s throne, and we who are here present on behalf of the whole body of your people offer your Majesty our sincere congratulations, and we pray God that the constitutional rule of your Majesty maybe adorned with every kind of blessing and prosperity for the children of Persia, and that the progress and happiness of this kingdom may, under the shadow of your auspicious regard, increase and become perfected.” The reception was a very simple affair, and no one present was in uniform. In all there were not more than thirty people present, and it was remarked that, apart from the two priests, the persons selected to be present were either members of the Kajar tribe or persons who belong to Court circles. No militant nationalist or prominent leader in recent events was present. After the reception the Shah remained at Snltanatabad, whence His Majesty a day or two later moved to Tehran. C. B. 8. No. 200. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey.—(Received August 17.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 17, 1909. TWO further questions concerning the ex-Shah’s departure, in addition to those connected with pension and crown jewels and dealt with in our protocol, have recently arisen, namely His Majesty’s debt to the Russian bank and the claims and charges against persons in his suite. The latter question was finally settled at meetings between the two representatives and delegates of the Persian Government which took place on the 15th and 16th August. The delegates agreed to a settlement of the former question on the following lines : His Majesty to make over his properties to the Persian Government, who would, in return, make a small addition to the pension already assigned to him and take on themselves his liabilities to the Banque d’Escompte. Unfortunately, however, a difficulty has arisen which will necessitate reference to our Governments, and my Russian colleague and I have reluctantly agreed with the delegates that His Majesty’s departure be temporarily postponed. We have been asked by the Persian Government to enter into an undertaking to the effect that, if it ever be proved to the satisfaction of the two Governments that the exiled Shah is engaged in intrigues in Persia, the Persian Government will be released from every obligation on the score of pension. It is natural that the Persian Government should endeavour to safeguard them selves against such an eventuality, but the question is a difficult one, and I do not think that the Russian Government could agree to this proposal, involving as it does the possibility of the ex-Shah being left in destitution on Russia’s hands, besides being open to interpretation as a reflection on Russian good faith. No. 201. Sir Edward Grey to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, ^ Foreign Office, August 17, 1909. THE Persian Minister came to see me to-day. He emphasised the feeling which was aroused in Persia by the continued presence of Russian troops, especially at Razyin. He complained that the troops at the latter place had given rise to the suspicion that they might advance on Tehran, owing to the arrangements they had made to move to a camp 8 miles nearer Tehran, when it would have been just as easy, for sanitary reasons, for them to move to a camp on the other side of Kazvin, towards Resht. I told the Persian Minister that these were matters which should be discussedbetween the Persian and Russian Governments, but I might teR him that when M. Isvolsky was here he had expressed a desire to withdraw the Russian troops from Persia, and had explained that the difficulty in doing so was that no one could he sure that order was yet firmly established. M. Isvolsky thought it would be a very bad thing if the troops were withdrawn and then had to be sent back again, and he did not wish this to happen. Though many Russian subjects in Persia had expressed great apprehension and had urged that Russian troops should be sent to Tehran the Russian Government had not yielded to these fears, and their restraint had been justified. But there was stiil a great deal of disorder in Persia. For instance, I was receiving great complaints from the south of Persia as to the damage to British trade and the insecurity of the roads. If the Russians were receiving similar complaints from the north, it would be difficult for them to withdraw their troops. I told him that his Government should discuss the necessary steps with the Russian Government, though I thought it was possible that, after all the disturbances which had taken place, the Russian Government might be reluctant to take a decision in the matter until they heard from M. Poklewski, whom they expected to report on the situation after his arrival at Tehran. The Persian Minister dwelt very strongly on the complete order which, he said, now existed in Tehran and Kazvin. I said I had no doubt that with the situation as it was at present the Russian Government could not have sent troops. But as their troops were already on the spot, they were afraid to withdraw them until they felt sure that the situation would go on improving. I have, &amp;c. E. GREY. . No. 202.

Barclay to Sir Edward Grey—(Received August 18.) (Telegraphic.) Gulahek, August 18, 1909. MOHAMMED ATI MIRZA refuses to give up his property on the lines of the arrangement referred to in my immediately preceding telegram. The substance of that arrangement was briefly as follows Persian Government to take over His Majesty’s liabilities to the extent of some 1.400.000 tomans at 12 per cent., at the same time to increase his pension to 90.000 tomans per annum ; His Majesty, on the other hand, to make over to the Government his estates, which bring in an estimated income of 50,000-100,000 tomans. From a financial point of view the arrangement is nothing if not advantageous for the ex-Shah, and the inducements for the Persian Government to grant such terms were the fear that His Majesty might use his position as a landed proprietor for purposes of intrigue and their strong objection to giving foreigners a hold over this property. In this way the ex-Shah’s legitimate interests are safeguarded, while the Persian Government have a substantial moral and political return for their financial loss. The Russian bank also will gain by securing the Government’s guarantee for a loan which, as far as one can see, the security of His Majesty s estates would not have covered satisfactorily, and, further, they are relieved from the many embarrassments which such a security would inevitably entail.His Majesty still refuses to yield, in spite of our endeavours to make clear the' personal advantage accruing to him from such an arrangement. My Russian colleague and I hope that we may be instructed by our Governments to oblige His Majesty to give his consent, M. Sabline, who agrees fully with the above, is telegraphing to St, Petersburgh for authorisation in this sense. The joint protection accorded to His Majesty, it will be remembered, referred only to his person, and we might consequently explain to him that if he continues to reject this arrangement he will not only lose the increase to his pension, but also, in the event of the Persian Government making themselves responsible, as they are willing to do on certain conditions, for His Majesty’s debt to the Russian bank, the Persian Government will be allowed to confiscate his estates without protest from the two legations.

I am informed by the Russian charge d affaires that, in the opinion of the Russian consul-general at Tabreez, Shah’s properties in Azerbaijan are not worth more than 40,000 tomans per annum. The surrender of his properties by the Shah on the conditions proposed would open the way for the early departure of His Majesty, for we should then be able to urge the Persian Government to relinquish their claims for the restoration of sundry properties, such as jewels, rifles, horses, donkeys, mules and saddles enumerated in a list which they have laid before us. As an alternative to this arrangement, I suggest that Russian charge d’affaires be authorised to allow the question of the debt to the Russian bank to be settled in the uture. No. 209. Sir G.

Sir, ^ Gulahek, Jidy 31, 1909. I HAVE tlie honour to report that the corps diplomatique was received in audience by Sultan Ahmad Shah for the first time this morning at 11 a.m. The young Shah was accompanied by the Regent, Azad-ul-Mulk, the venerable head of the Kajar tribe, an old man about eighty years of age, with courtly manners and a dignified bearing, who acted as spokesman on behalf of the thirteen-year-old Shah. The German Minister, as doyen, delivered a short address, offering the Shah the congratulations of the diplomatic body, and afterwards presented the felicitations of the Emperor and of the German Government. The Regent replied on behalf of the Shah in a few well-chosen words, expressing gratitude for the good wishes conveyed by the doyen and assuring the diplomatic body of the determination of the Shah’s Government to maintain and strengthen the friendly relations happily existing between Persia and the Powers. The Regent then conducted the young Shah round the circle of foreign represen tatives, who presented their respective staffs to His Majesty, and replied to the usual formal inquiries as to their respective Sovereigns or heads of States. When it came to my turn, I took the opportunity of conveying to His Majesty the congratulations and good wishes of His Majesty the King, His Majesty’s Government, and of the Viceroy of India, for which the Regent begged me to convey the Shah’s heartfelt gratitude. He added that he had had the honour of meeting His Majesty the King and of being presented to Her late Majesty Queen Victoria on the occasion of one of the visits to Europe of the late Nasr-ed-Din Shah more than thirty years ago. The diplomatic body was subsequently received by the Regent in a separate apartment. His Highness Azad-ul-Mulk, who at his advanced age and unaccustomed as he is to official life, or, in fact, to any intercourse with foreigners, must have found the ordeal a very trying one, received us again and went through a second process of presentations with remarkable charm of manner. The absence at the proceedings of the well-known faces of prominent courtiers who have done so much to bring about the collapse of Mohammed All’s corrupt autocratic rule was very noticeable. The two leaders who have brought about this great change did not appear at the ceremony. 1 have, G. BARCLAY. No. 2l7i Sir G. Bar day to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 30.) !3i rj Giilaheh) August 10, 1909. ’ SINCE the capture of Tehran by the Nationalist forces, government has been virtually in the hands of a committee of twenty-five, elected for the guidance of the Ministers by the extraordinary Grand Council. A Cabinet has been formed, but no Minister seems to venture upon action with out the concurrence of the committee. On the whole the committee has conducted affairs with success, Order was speedily restored in the capital after the fighting was over, and so far it has been well maintained, though the predatory proclivities of the dispersed or disbanded troops of the ex-Shah have from time to. time given ground for anxiety in the neighbouring districts. No date has yet been fixed for the meeting of the assembly, but the committee fully realise the necessity for its meeting without delay, and elections on the basis of the new electoral law are already proceeding. In the provinces generally the revolution has been well received. In their present financial straits the Government have not, of course, been able to take active measures towards suppressing the lawlessness prevalent in many districts, but as regards the chief provincial towns they have succeeded by means of urgent injunctions to would-be disturbers of the peace in producing a detente, and in some cases averting imminentdisorders. In the choice of provincial governors the new Government has not been altogether happy. The matter is a difficult one on account of the unfortunate dearth of men in the governing class of honesty and strength of character. For the moment counsels are divided as to whether it is Letter to appoint men who have been prominent in provincial administration in the past or to select men who have only held minor posts. In favour of the former course it is said that the more prominent men are likely to have greater personal influence, and it is on personal influence that for a long time to come the Government must mainly rely for the maintenance of order in the provinces. On the other side, it is contended that it will be easier with men of less standing to break with the corrupt traditions of the past. It is due to this difference of opinion that the post of governor-general of Fars remains unfilled, to the detriment of the province. Ain-ed-Dowleh had been appointed when it was found that the Kashgais would not accept Ala-ed-Dowleh, but in the meantime Taki Zadeh had returned to Tehran, and at once made his influence felt against the selection of a prince who is the embodiment of the old system which it is desired to reform, flffie governorship of Tabreez has been another difficulty. Notwithstanding the representations of my Russian colleague, which I have supported, the Government persists in the appointment of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, rather than Ala-ed-Dowleh. The same objection applies to Ala-ed-Dowleh as to Ain-ed-Dowleh, but here at least it would have been wiser, in deference to the wishes of Russia, to waive any objections there may be to the employment of men of the old school. It in this question of the choice of governors that I think the Government has been least judicious, though there are other matters which have provoked criticism. Among these are the forced contributions alleged to have been levied on corrupt officials of the late regime and the execution of Sheikh Feizlullah and others. I have no certain knowledge that anyone has been squeezed, but supposing the allegations to be true, the methods by which these men have amassed fortunes render them fair game, besides which allowance must be made for a Government which is almost entirely without ordinary sources of revenue to draw upon. In the disorganised state of the provinces nothing is to be expected from the maliat for a long time to come—indeed, much of that due for the current year has already been spent, and the other chief sources of revenue are heavily pledged. At the outset the new Government raised with difficulty a loan from local merchants of 20,000 tomans, but this sum is long ago exhausted. A fortnight ago a leading member of the committee told me in the course of a visit that the Government were undecided whether to have recourse to forced contributions or to make a request to the banks for ' accommodation. There were objections to both courses ; the former would make a bad impression and provoke an outcry from those on the look-out for alarmist tales, while the latter would be inconsistent with the repeated declarations in the past that no foreign advance of any kind would be recognised without the approval of the assembly. Since my friend’s visit it would appear, if the reports current are to be believed, that the Government has decided to follow the former course. This may enable them to carry on for a time ; but many of the men who deserve squeezing are under foreign protection. This considerably reduces the fund available for such extortions, and I gather that the Government are likely to find themselves compelled before the assembly meets to apply to the banks. The persons who have been executed are Mufakher-ul-Mulk, Sani Hazret, Mir Hashem, Sheikh Feizlullah, and a certain adjutant bashi. They were tried by a special court, which has now been dissolved, and though the reports published of the trials are somewhat inadequate, it may be asserted with confidence that, with the exception of the adjutant bashi, against whom the principal charge was that he had opened the fire on the Medjliss on the occasion of the coup cVfitat last year, none of these men call for any pity. Mufakher-ul-Mulk, Sani Hazret, and Mir Hashem all had murders to their account. This, perhaps, cannot be said of Sheikh Feizlullah, but he has been one of the most unscrupulous enemies of the constitutional cause, and, though no proper account of his trial has appeared, he is believed to have been plotting for the restoration of Mohammed Ali. The danger from such plots is very real. Sheikh Feizlullah was a danger to his country, and Persia is well rid of him. I have, &amp;c.

I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith copy of a- despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s acting consul-general at Tabreez regarding the reception of the news of the overthrow of the ex-Shah’s Government and its effect upon the general situation at that place. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 218. Acting Consul-General Smart to Sir G. Barclay. Sir, ( # Tabreez, July 25, 1909. 1 HAVE the honour to report that the abdication of Mohammed Ali Shah was welcomed here with general satisfaction by all classes, who dislike and distrust him beyond hope of a reconciliation. On the 22nd July Ijlahul-Mulk, the acting governor, gave an official reception in honour of the accession of Sultan Ahmed Shah, and since then festivities, illuminations, and fireworks have been the order of the day and night. Sattar and Bagher Khan, who left the Turkish Consulate-General on the 10th July, immediately after the arrival of the new consul-general, Remsi Bey, in order to prepare for their departure with the outgoing consul-general, Mohammed Ali Bey, have changed their minds since the coup d’Etat. Mohammed Ali Bey left on the 22nd instant without Sattar and Bagher, who are at present keeping cpiiet in their houses, and have apparently abandoned all idea of leaving the country. All the respectable nationalists are anxious to get rid of them, and it is most desirable that they should be removed on some pretext. There is in Tabreez a strong party of moderate nationalists who, if Sattar and Bagher v r ere removed, might be able to overcome the undesirable elements, consisting mainly of armed fedais. The anti-Russian agitation has collapsed for the present, and it is unlikely to become general unless the Russian troops are not withdrawn after the arrival of the governor-general with sufficient escort. The behaviour of the private soldiers continues to be, on the whole, exemplary. The Anjuman, wdiich was re-elected at the beginning of this month, and the acting governor continue to govern the town, somewhat incoherently, but the presence of Russian troops is sufficient to prevent any disorder. The appointment of Mukhber-es-Sultaneh as governor-general has caused general satisfaction, for he has the reputation of being a strong and enlightened man. He is apparently coming direct from Berlin via Julfa, but it is to be hoped that a strong escoit for him will be dispatched from Tehran as soon as possible ; otherwise he will be unable to suppress the fedais in Tabreez, much less restore order in the province. The state of the province is very unsatisfactory, and, with the exception of the Julfa road, the roads are very unsafe. The Shahsevans have plundered all along the Tehran road between Mianeh and Haji A glia, as well as the country round Ardebil. Mohammed Kuli Khan, a Shahsevan chief and famous smugglci, ^ having been appointed deputy governor of Ardebil by bipahdar, entered the town with his tribes men who indulged m general looting. Numbers of people, including the royalist governor, Rashid-ul-Mulk, took refuge in the Russian Consulate, and Mohammed Kuli was left in possession of the town. However, the arrival of 100 Russian Cossacks appears to have put an end to the disorders in the town. In Kaiadagh some fighting has been going on between the Shahsevans and Rahim Khan, in winch the honours appear to havelreen divided. The two parties have now' patched up a reconciliation. i L I have, &amp;c. W. A. SMART. [82-1]Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 30.) Sir, • Gulaheky August 12, 1909. 1 HAVE tlie honour to forward copy of the protocol mentioned in my telegram of the 5th August. I need not trouble yon with the wearisome negotiations which preceded the conclusion of this arrangement. It will suffice to say that in the early stages my Russian colleague and I held as much as possible aloof, leaving the questions of the surrender of the Crown jewels and of the ex-Shah’s civil list to be dealt with between His Majesty’s entourage and representatives of the Persian Government, and that it was only when matters had reached a deadlock between them—the ex-Shah refusing to give up a large part of the jewels—that we formally intervened. It was obviously in the highest degree desirable that Mohammed Ali’s stay in Persia should be cut short, and we therefore decided to bring pressure to bear on both parties to come to an arrangement. Part of the jewels w T ere among His Majesty’s effects at the Russian Legation, and, unless they were to be taken from him by force, it was necessary to bring the Persian Government to make some concession in regard to the civil list. The sum originally offered (25,000 tomans a-year) was small, even making allowance for Persia’s poverty, and it would have left His Majesty largely dependent on Russia, which had promised him a welcome. In response to our pressing advice the committee consented to increase it to 75,000 tomans on the conditions set forth in the protocol. On his side the ex-Shah has now, yielding to our pressure, surrendered for inspection certain boxes which contain a portion at least of the missing jewels. I have not yet heard the result of this inspection, but it is to be feared that a good many of the jewels claimed by the Government as Crown property will be found to have been pawned or sold. In this case the representatives of the two Powers are bound to do their best to secure from His Majesty the pawmtickets and full particulars. I trust that the Persian Government, in its desire to see the last of His Majesty, will not be too exacting on this point. Before affixing our signatures we shall insist on those of the Cabinet, using as leverage the stipulation for His Majesty’s early departure, and if we obtain them the assembly will find it difficult to repudiate the arrangement. There are other questions, of course, to be settled in connection with the ex-Shah’s money matters, such as his claim to arrears of civil list and his debts to the two banks, but these can be arranged after he has left. His claim to arrears of civil list is in large part for the period during which he has been ruling as an autocrat, and as such is not likely to be admitted by the Persian Government. He is said to owe 1,500,000 tomans to the Russian Bank, and he owes some 150,000 tomans to the Imperial Bank of Persia. The former debt is secured on His Majesty’s private property, and the latter was passed by Mohammed Ali during the post-Medjliss regime as a Government debt. If the assembly repudiate it, it will be worth considering whether we cannot obtain repayment for the bank from the 75,000 tomans a-year assigned to His Majesty. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY.

Monthly Summary .—(June 19 to August 6, 1909.) Tehran* SAAD-ED-DO WEEK’S Cabinet resigned on the 24th Julie, owing to panic caused by news of the advance on Tehran of the nationalist forces from Ispahan and Kazvin. The Shah, however, asked the Ministers to retain office temporarily, which they did, and the two legations sent their dragomans to enjoin “ solidarity ” upon several of the Ministers, especially Earman Farma, who were acting in a very foolish manner. The British and Russian consuls-general at Ispahan arrived at Kum on the 26th to urge Sardar Assad to abandon his advance on Tehran. They returned to their posts a few days later, and subsequent events showed that their mission had failed. On the 28th the Sipahdar’s mixed force of Caucasians and Persians from Resht and Kazvin arrived at Yengi-Imam, 45 miles from Tehran, within 20 miles of the Cossack post established four days before at Kerej under the command of Captain Zapolsky. On the 1st July Sardar Assad advanced from Kum much to the surprise of everyone, as it was thought that the serious warning given to him by the two legations would deter him. At Tehran the bazaars were closed, and a general exodus from town to the country began. The following day the British and Russian representatives had a painful audience of the Shah at Sultanatabad, when he was told that he should have followed the advice of the two Powers sooner, that they had done what they could, and would continue to use their influence to bring about a pacific Solution of the present crisis. The Shah was dignified in his attitude. On the 3rd and 4th July important developments occurred : Sardar Assad arrived at Robat Kerim,^ some 40 miles from Tehran, and the Cossacks were ordered to retire from ^ Kerej, which was followed by a forward movement by Sipahdar, who occupied Kerej. . Seeing that^ the two commanders were rapidly drawing their forces nearer to the capital, the British and Russian representatives decided, in pursuance of instructionsX IJ. I.

They were actually fired at by the Cossacks, and had to retire. This engagement appears to have been merely one of outposts, and the Cossacks held their ground inflicting considerable loss to the opponents, from whom they captured one gun. The delegates from the two legations delivered their messages to the two commanders respectively, but they produced no effect whatever. On the Gth July the Russian legation announced to the Persian Government that a force of Russian troops rvas on its way to Kazvin, not to intervene in the struggle then proceeding, but to be at the disposal of the Russian legation for the protection of Russian and other foreign lives and property. On the 9th July Sipahdar left Kerej with about 1,000 men, outflanked the Cossacks who remained posted at Shahabad, and advanced in a south-easterly direction towards Robat Kerim, from whence Sardar Assad had advanced to meet him with about 1,200 Bakhtiaris. Notwithstanding a treacherous attempt to surprise the fedai under Sipahdar, which was clumsily made by Amir Mufakham, the royalist Bakhtiari chief, the two nationalist forces joined hands, and for three days maintained their position against severe artillery fire. On the night of the 12th July the combined nationalist force marched between tie opposing Cossacks and irregulars. They succeeded in getting through unnoticed, and at 6 a.m. on the 13th July the whole nationalist force entered Tehran by the north, or Yusufabad gate, which was not held against them. They rode three abreast past the British legation, and shortly afterwards, dividing into three columns, proceeded to the Baharistan, or assembly building, which they reached practically without opposition. The soldiers on duty at the various guard-houses were disarmed without difficulty, though two or three inen were killed and wounded at the guard-house opposite the main gate of the legation. A column which descended the legation street towards the Artillery Square was fired upon by soldiers posted in the square, the various gates of which were immediately closed. The three northern and three eastern gates of the town were immediately taken possession of by the Bakhtiaris, but the three western gates remained in the hands of the Cossacks. During the course of the morning Captain Zapolsky with 400 Cossacks under him entered the town by one of these gates and joined Colonel Liakhov , who was throughout at the Cossack barracks in the western part of the town with 400 men. The remaining 300 Cossacks, under Captain Peribinoszeff,'went to Sultanatabad to protect the Shah, who had besides some 2,000 men under Amir Bahadur who had taken no part whatever in the hostilities. _ . , , Throughout the three days on which hostilities lasted, viz., loth, 14th, and 15th July, the Cossacks remained on the defensive in and around then banacks, win e an irregular force of some 500 absolutely undisciplined men held the gun square ; the main force, under Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, held the rest of the town, with then- headquarters at the Baharistan, whilst a determined body of fedai crept gradually as close to the barracks as possible, using their mausers wuth great effect and throwing bombs at night. . , -i ^ • i On the 14th the Shah declared that he intended to stake Ins all on a determined combined attack on the town by all the forces at his disposal and to take refuge at the Russian legation if it failed. The attack proved a complete failure. _ Captain Peribinoszeff shelled the Baharistan quarter from the hills near Kasr-r-Kajar winch covered an attack by some of the irregulars on the Dochantapeh gate. Ihe Bakhtiari, luwvever, appeared in such force to defend that approach that the attacking party ec in confusion, while the bombardment produced no impression whatever. Colonel Liakhow endeavoured to shell the Baharistan at the same time, but the range must have been most inaccurate as a number of the shells exploded over the Imperial 1 anv without doing much harm. . , The Shah was assured by his Persian officers that victory might still be Ins, am , consequently, the following day (the 15th July) further attempts were made by his irregulars to attack the gates, but the Cossacks remained entirely on the defensive. Every attack w T as, however, repulsed with severe loss to the royalists. During t e c . a T a small number of the royalist Bakhtiari contrived to reach a house near the British legation, and a great deal of firing went on between them and the iedai. The total casualties are \mknown, but probably did not exceed oOO. ^ [824] aOn the 16th July the Shah took refuge at the Russian legation under a joint Anglo-Russian guard, and the dragomans of the two legations were sent to town to make terms between the nationalist leaders and Colonel Liakhow, which they succeeded in doing. The same day the Cossacks began to fraternise with the Bakhtiari and fedai, and by the following day normal conditions had been re-established in the town. On the 17th the council proclaimed Mohammed All’s deposition and the enthronement of the Valiahd as Sultan Ahmed Shah. Azad-ul-Mulk was temporarily appointed to be Regent, and the following Cabinet was formed as a provisional Government pending the convocation of the National Assembly Minister of War ... „ ,, Interior „ „ Foreign Affairs ,, ,, Finance ,, ,, Justice „ „ Education, &amp;c. ,, „ Court „ ,, Telegraphs and Posts Sipahdar.

Several other minor appointments were made including the notorious leader of the reputed Caucasian revolutionaries, known as Yeprim, who became chief of police. Ala-ed-Dowleh, who had arrived at Tehran a few days before, was appointed governor- general of Fars, and Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, who was still in Europe, was summoned back and told to go direct to Tabreez to take over the government of Azerbaijan, which he held at the time of the last coup d’Etat in June 1908. Samsam-es-Sultaneh was confirmed as governor of Ispahan. Saad-ed-Dowleh and Mukhber-ed-Dowleh took refuge at the British legation, but seeing that there was no likelihood of their being interfered with they left after a day or two for their homes, but Saad-ed-Dowleh has since placed himself under Russian protection. ^ The provisional Government having officially notified the legations of the change of Sovereign, the British and Russian legations signified their recognition of Sultan Ahmed Shah and the other legations followed suit. The town was illuminated on the 21st July and the 22nd and newspapers began to reappear. On the 2()th Mufakher-ul-Mulk, the notorious reactionary agent of the ex-Shah, was captured, and two days later, after trial by a special court, he was shot at the Bagh-i-Shah. The same court also tried three other prominent reactionaries, including Sani Hezret, the leader of the armed roughs employed by Mohammed Ali, and Sheikh Fazlullah, the reactionary chief Mollah, who had done so much against the constitutional regime, and they were publicly hanged in the artillery square. Several arrests were also made, including Haji Majd-ed-Dowleh, K.C.M.G., and Amir Nizam, the ex-Minister of Finance. In the meantime steps were taken by the nationalist committee, which seemed to be managing affairs, and of which Hussein Kuli Khan, C.B., is the’ leading spirit, to take possession on behalf of the Government of the crown jewels and other property which Mohammed Ali had taken to the Russian legation. A large portion of these jewels was taken over without much trouble, but Mohammed Ali endeavoured to retain a considerable quantity. The committee offered to give the ex-Shah 5,0007. per annum as a pension, but after lengthy negotiations carried on with them by the two legations, a protocol was signed on the 3rd August by which the ex-Shah is to receive 15,0007. a-year, hand over all the jewels and leave Tehran at latest by the 17th August. The remaining jewels were handed over the following day. On the 31st July Sultan Ahmed Shah, supported by the Regent who acted as spokesman for His Majesty who is only about 13 years of age, held his first reception of the corps diplomatique. Colonel Liakhow left Tehran for Russia on the 4th August. Mohammed Ali brought with him to the Russian legation most of his reactionary following, including Amir Bahadur. Naib-es-Sultaneh had preceded his nephew a few days before. A number of the Silakhori and other irregulars also pitched their tents in the grounds outside the legation walls and were removed with difficulty. Some of119 them attempted to loot villages in the vicinity, and a force of Bakhtiari had to be sent up from town to disperse them. Normal conditions have now been restored, and the elections for 15 members of Parliament for the Tehran district are proceeding on the basis of the Electoral Law already elaborated under the old regime. Zil -es-Sultan arrived at Resht and left for Tehran on the 5th August, but was stopped at Menjil. Taki Zadeh arrived at Tehran on the 6th August. G, P, CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary, Oulaheh, August 6, 1909. Tabreez, Mukhber-es-Sultaneh, who has been appointed governor-general of Azerbaijan, has not yet'reached Tabreez from Europe. The local assembly of Tabreez is anxiou s that Samad Khan, a tribal chief, and lately one of the Shah’s generals, should be dismissed from the governorship of Maraga. As he is a good governor, and his is the only tranquil district in Azerbaijan, both legations have advised that he should be left in his post. Ar debit. The Russian Government having informed the Persian Government on the 1st August that unless a strong governor with a suitable escort was dispatched to Ardebil by the 4th August they would themselves send troops in to keep order. Fath-es-Sultan was on the 2nd August appointed governor, and has started from the neighbourhood of Tabreez for Ardebil. Resht. Three Russian transports reached Enzeli on the 9th July, and three on the 10th July, and landed troops. On the 10th, 625 Cossacks left Resht for Kazvin. The armed supporters of the nationalist cause laid down their arms. ()n the 1 oth about 1,000 infantrymen and four guns left Enzeli for Resht. They reached Kazvin on the 16th July. The infantry left Resht on the 15th. Ihree more tianspoits reached Enzeli on the 19th July, from one of which supplies were landed next day in charge of 159 commissariat personnel. On the 3rd August fifty Russian soldiers landed at Enzeli, and His Majesty’s vice-consul was informed that more weie to come in small detachments. Events at Tehran gave pleasure to the people of Resht generally. Taki Zadeh passed through Resht on his way from Tabreez to Tehran on the 3rd August. Astrabad. The news of the abdication of Mohammed AH Shah was joy. The town was illuminated for three nights, and salutes were fired. received with great Ispahan. In consequence of excesses of all kinds committed by Bakhtiaris, the British and Russian consuls-general early in July addressed^ strong notes to the Persian loreign Jffice agent. This led to the dismissal of the chief of the police, who was replaced by dharib Khan. The latter has displayed much energy in keeping order. Samsam-es- hdtaneh has also taken steps to this end. He published a proclamation to the ettect that any Bakhtiari extorting money from the townspeople or molesting women would be very severely dealt with, and another forbidding any firing m town. Ihe house of mv offender was to be pulled down. Ispahan has consequently remained quiet. The enti-y of the nationalist forces into Tehran on the 13th duly was announced to Ispahan the same day by the firing of guns. The bazaars were dlummated tor two evemnes On the 16th, news was received of the Shahs having taken refuge m the Russian Legation, and on the 18th the appointment of Samsam-es-Sultaneh as governor- general of Ispahan was announced. A day or two later Agha Aourullah, who had striven to assert the pre-eminence of the clergy, was compelled to resign the presidency [824]of the local assembly. There is considerable ill-feeling between Samsam and the clergy. On the 20th July salutes were fired to announce the accession of Sultan Ahmed Shall, and in the evening there were illuminations and fireworks in Ispahan and Julfa. The khans were on that evening the guests of the Armenian Archimandrite. Mr. Grahame reports that events at Tehran have created curiously little impression at Ispahan, and that the dominant note there was indifference. The majority, including enlightened notables and merchants, favours the new regime, but a large minority is against it. The minority consists of the clergy and the officials. The former feel that their influence is doomed, while the latter fear a reduction of their emoluments. The Tehran-Ispahan road was! for some weeks quite unsafe, and robberies of travellers and posts were frequent. The royalist and nationalist forces moving on the road appear to have been equally concerned in these robberies. Sardar Assad, on being appointed Minister of the Interior, at once issued orders for the patrolling of the road by Bakhtiaris, with the result that on the 24th July the road was reported free from brigandage. The Ahwaz road was reported at the end of July to be very unsafe-— two.large robberies of caravans having recently taken place. The elections for the national assembly began on the 29th July, and were to close on the 12th August. Yezd. The condition of the roads to Yezd did not improve during July. They were still frequented by large bodies of robbers, and numbers of robberies w^ere reported. The postal service was very irregular. In the town and suburbs the Parsees and Jews suffered continual annoyance at the hands of Mahommedans. The newest form of tyranny is the forcible conversion to Islam of Parsee girls. One or two cases have occurred, and threats of more have caused the closing of Parsee girls’ schools, the girls being afraid to leave their homes. The Parsee community is unfortunately at this moment somewhat bitterly divided over the question of the succession to the office of priest, to which the two sons of the late priest are the rival claimants. Adhed-Dowleh, who resigned the governorship, was reappointed to it. Kerman. The situation has not altered appreciably in the last month. Nizam-es- Sultaneh has been confirmed in the appointment of governor by the new Central Government, but has not yet left Tehran for Kerman. Kermanshali. The people of Kermanshali seem to have been divided into two parties by a private quarrel among the priests. Of the two factions, the one headed by Seyyid Kamal-ed-1 )m, a belli an pnest, vas supported by most of the notables of the town, the other, under Moin-i-Raya, had the secret support of the local clergy. On'the 14th July fighting took place between the two parties, in which Moin-i-Raya was defeated^ the other party’s force being commanded by Zahir-ul-Mulk. Early on the 15th, Moin-i-Raya and two others took refuge in the grounds of His Majesty’s consulate without Captain Crossle’s permission. In anticipation of such an incident, Captain Crossle had issued strict orders that no refugees should be admitted, but as the consulate grounds are quite open it is impossible to prevent entrance to them by night. Captain Crossle had also requested the governor to provide guards for British subjects* but the governor replied that he was powerless, as he had no troops and Zahir-ul-Mulk had seized the arsenal. Captain Crossle saw the refugees, and protested against their presence. They refused to leave, as if they did so they would be killed at once. At the same time Captain Crossle wrote to the governor to inform him that these men had taken refuge at the consulate, and asked him to make arrangements that they should be removed as soon as possible. The Foreign Office agent arrived on the part of the governor, and Captain Crossle protested strongly against these men taking refuse, and demanded that arrangements should be made for them to leave at once. He informed him, at the same time, that he had sent several times to the governor asking for guards, and had always recerved the reply that the latter was unable to supply them. Captarn Crossle went on to say that the consulate would not interfere in an affair exclusively local, and which did not affect our interests.121 The Foreign Office agent deplored the governor’s want of power, and after an interview with the refugees agreed to go and see Zahir-ul-Mulk and inform him that they were ready to leave the town if their lives were spared. In the meanwhile, Zahir-ul-Mulk took advantage of the excitement in the town to burn Moin-i-Raya’s house and to loot several others. In the evening Zahir-ul-Mulk sent messengers, saying that the refugees must be handed over unconditionally, and that he would put them in chains and have them tried ; that in the beginning Moin-i-Raya had sent to Nazr Ali Khan and a son of Daoud Khan, who is in revolt against his father, asking them to come and help him. Moin-i-Raya denied this, and gave letters to be dispatched to both these chiefs asking them not to come to Kermanshah on his account. Zahir-ul- Mulk’s messengers were accompanied by a large crowd of people, who said they were come to take the refugees, if necessary by force. As it was evident that if Captain Crossle handed them over they would be killed once they got out of the consulate grounds, he refused to do so unless an assurance were given that they would not be touched. On the 16th Zahir-ed-Dowleh, the governor, wrote informing Captain Crossle that he had resigned the governorship. He was induced to reconsider his decision, but refused to do anything until he got support from Tehran. He informed the consulate Mirza that he would not act as governor so long as Zahir-ul-Mulk made use of Government guns and soldiers for his private quarrels. On the morning of the 17th Daoud Khan, chief of the Kalhors, arrived with 200 horsemen to help Zahir-ul- Mulk. It was reported that he would loot the town unless Moin-i-Raya were surrendered unconditionally. During the day news arrived from Tehran that the Shah had abdicated, and this took a great deal of attention off local affairs. In the evening the consulate Mirza had an interview with Daoud Khan, and explained the position of affairs to him. As a result, the night passed quietly. On the 18th Zahir-ul-Mulk and his party called on Daoud Khan and asked him to send back his horsemen with the exception of some thirty as an escort. Daoud Khan agreed to do so, and later signed a telegram to be sent to the Sipahdar demanding that Moin-i-Raya should be handed over to Zahir-ul-Mulk unconditionally. On the 29th one refugee left the consulate. The governor again resigned, but once more resumed office on the 30th. Zahir-ul-Mulk, however, remained paramount. The other refugees left on the 3rd August of their own accord. On the 5th August a representative of the Persian Foreign Office called on His Majesty’s Minister to protest against the refugees being kept in the consulate. He was informed, in reply, that they were no longer there, and His Majesty’s Minister took the opportunity of protesting very strongly against the behaviour of the governor, Daoud Khan, and Zahir-ul-Mulk, and added that nothing would have induced him to send the men out, as it was known that ruffians like Zahir- ul-Mulk were waiting to massacre them. Little impression was created at Kermanshah by the news of events at Tehran, the town being occupied with local affairs. Carriages now run from Hama dan to Kazvin, the journey taking forty-eight hours. About the 10th July the governor of Kasr-i-Shirin telegraphed to the governor here that Agha Mullah Ahmad Yezdi had arrived there on behalf of the chief priests of Kerbela. He was in telegraphic communication with Naib-es-Sultaneh, the Shah’s uncle, to ascertain the Shah’s intentions. He stated that if the constitutional movement did not gain ground the chief priests of Kerbela would come to Persia and take a lead in the matter. Hamadan has remained quiet. There was apparently some preparation for sending a contingent to help the nationalist forces advancing on iehian, but few, if any, men eventually started. Sh Iraz. On the 11th July Assaf-ed-Dowleh informed the British and Russian consuls that he had resigned the post of governor-general rather than be the cause of bloodshed. On the 12th all the regular troops in Shiraz took refuge at the two consulates, encamping round them, as a protest against not receiving pay, while the go\einoi- general was paying the Kashgais regularly. The Arab tribes sent wore! that they were ready to attack Shiraz whenever the Kawam oideied it. On^the loth Jul} ^e\yid Abdul Hussain Lari was reported to be near Darab with Sheikh Zakana and 100 men. The two consuls delivered to Assaf-ed-Dowleh a message fiom the two legations conveying to him an emphatic warning, and got fiom him positive oideis to the Lan Seyyid and Soulet-ed-Dowleh forbidding them to advance on Shiraz. The governor- general still maintained that he w r as going, and promised to send the Kashgais aw ay from the town. On the same day the appointment of Zil-cs-eultan as gcveinoi geneialwas announced, and was received with the utmost enthusiasm. The consulate Munshi visited Assaf-ed-Dowleh on the 14th, and found him ignorant of his own dismissal, the news of which he received with evident consternation. Unfortunately the news of Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment was not confirmed. On the same day His Majesty’s consul at Bunder Abbas reported that the Lari Seyyid was ill at Tahrun, 100 miles from Bunder Abbas. The non-confirmation of the appointment of Zil-es-Sultan by Mushir- ul-Mulk, who, according to the offiqial announcement, was to be the new Wazir, led to a renewal of the agitation against Assaf-ed-Dowleh, and Seyyid Muhammad addressed the two consuls declaring that the crowd assembled in the Shah Chiragh mosque was beyond his control, and that if disorder was to be avoided Assaf-ed-Dowleh must leave at once. On the 17th news of Ata-ed-Dowleh’s appointment as temporary deputy governor, pending the arrival of Bahrain Mirza, was received. The two consuls visited him privately and urged him to take immediate steps to restore order, which he promised to do. A ssaf-ed-Dowleh, however, in spite of his previous declarations that he had^ resigned and was anxious to leave, refused to do so, on the ground that the Zil-es-Sultan’s appointment had been made by the Government of Muhammad Ali Shah, who had been dethroned. Rumours were also circulated that the Zil-es-Sultan had never been appointed at all, and that the telegram announcing his appointment and that of Ata-ed-Dowleh had been forged by the two consuls to keep their refugees quiet. On the 17th the two consuls wrote to Ata-ed-Dowleh urging him to pay no attention to unconfirmed rumours, and reminding him that whatever might have happened^ elsewhere he was responsible for order in Shiraz until further instructions were received. On the same day a messenger came in from Jahrum reporting that the Lari Seyyid had sent an emissary to that place to buy cartridges at any price, lelegrams were^ received from Sipahdar and Sardar Assad announcing themselves lespectic ely Minister of A\ ar and of the Interior. On the 18th a telegram was received irom the latter addressed to Soulet-ed-Dowleh directing him not to move, and on the same day the Kawam received a telegram from the Arabs at Dehbid urging him to fight the Kashgais at Beyza. ^ The Kawam sent excited messages to both consuls that Soulet-ed-Dowleh had left his summer quarters for Shiraz, and that consequently he was forced to summon his Arabs. In reply, he was urged to be careful to avoid any action which would serve as a pretext to Soulet-ed-Dowleh for coming, and it was pointed out that, as Soulet-ed-Dowleh was apparently still some eight stages away on the Sarhad route, he had no justification for representing the danger to be imminent. He then asked whether the consuls would permit him to send men out from Dehbid to defend his properties which were being ravaged, and was told in reply that the matter did not concern the consuls, whose duty was confined to warning both him and Soulet-ed-Dowleh that whoever moved their forces first towards Shiraz would be held responsible for any damage to the persons or property of foreign subjects which might result from the ensuing fighting. On the 19th telegrams from Sardar Assad and from Seyyid Assadullah at Bushire to the address of the Lari Seyvid and Soulet-ed- Dowleh were received, urging them to keep quiet. On the 20th 'the Shah Chiragh mosque was evacuated in the belief that A ssaf-ed-Do wleh’s dismissal was assured. On the 21st the appointment of Ala-ed-Dowleh was announced, and was apparently lecerved until somewhat mixed feelings, the respectable classes welcoming the appoint ment and the professional agitators resisting it. On the 22nd an agitation was begun against Ala-ed-Dowleh and in favour ol Zil-es-Sultan’s return, and the bazaars were closed. On the 23rd Soulet-ed-Dowleh telegraphed to Assaf-ed-Dowleh tellino- him not to 1ca\ e Shiraz, and that il he did he (Soulet-ed-Dowleh) would bring him back. . On the 24th, Assaf-ed-Dowleh started from Shiraz leaving the palace in the hands of a i a ( * ri the 25th a telegram from Abadeh informed Mr. Bill that boulet-ed—Dowleh had started for Shiraz with a large force, and had sent another to Abadeh to prevent Ala-ed-Dowleh reaching Shiraz. Mr. Bill, therefore, asked His Majesty s Minister to allow the reinforcement for his consular guard to start from Bushire. Ihe move was accordingly sanctioned. The Russian consul had on the -1 1 mfoimed Mr. Bill that he was asking for Russian Cossacks from Ispahan The Jpshgai guards on the same day expelled the deputy governor from the palace. On the ^ / th pi uly Soulet-ed-Dowleh was reported to be within five easy marches of Uiiiaz the Kawam had meanwhile left Shiraz to join the Arabs. At Mr. Bill’s suggestion Mr Christmas, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, was sent to see Soulet-ed-Dowleh m order to get him to stop his advance. Mr. Christmas started on the 29th, and returned with an answer from Soulet-ed-Dowleh asking Mr. Bill to ysit him at Ins camp twelve miles from Shiraz. Mr. Bill visited him, and on the 3rd August reported that Soulet-ed-Dowleh had said that he did not wish to be governor-123 general, and he would accept anyone else except Ala-ed-Dowleh whose enmity was of long standing and who was untrustworthy. He would withdraw every Kashgai from Shiraz the day another governor-general was appointed. To show that his object was not to capture Shiraz, he would wait for three days on condition that the Kawam did not advance on Shiraz and that Ala-ed-Dowleh did not start from Tehran. He wished the Persian Government to be informed of this decision. It was a matter of life and death to him to resist Ala-ed-Dowleh. At Mr. Bill’s suggestion he agreed to write in the above sense to the Russian consul. Mr. Bill thought that his force numbered over 2,000 men, and that more were probably within call. Soulet-ed-Dowleh had already sent into Shiraz a proclamation stating that lie was coming at the bidding of the chief priests of Kerbela to enforce the laws of the National Assembly, to hold elections and to start a local assembly, and to put an end to tyrants. He promised to pay compen sation for anything taken, and to maintain order. The reinforcement for the consular guard reached Shiraz on the 2nd August. The detachment was unfortunate enough to have three cases of heat-stroke resulting in the death of two of the Indian soldiers on the road. On the 5th August Soulet-ed-Dowleh, at the expiration of the three days, encamped outside Shiraz and entered into telegraphic communication with the Persian Government. On the 11th August it was reported that Saham-ed-Dowleh had been appointed governor-general of Pars. Events at Tehran produced no signs of regret for the late Shah or of enthu siasm for the new regime, attention being entirely engrossed with local affairs. Persian Gulf.—Biisliire. Seyyid Murteza, who had been a prisoner from the 7th July, was shipped off in the fast mail to Bussorah early in July en route to Nejef, in charge of Seyyid Abdul Sahib. Both Darya Beggi and the local assembly wrote to the leading priests of Nejef, saying that he was a dangerous firebrand and should be kept under surveillance and not allowed to leave the place. _ _ _ . On the 20th June a local assembly was elected consisting of six priests and live m erchants On the 23rd June, Darya Beggi moved out to Mokam, a village five miles from Bn shire, en route to Tangistan. He took with him 300 infantry and artillery, and three omns under the Amir Panj, 200 riflemen under Ahmad Khan, nephew of the Khan of Bundur Rig, 250 riflemen under Sheikh Hussain Chahkutai It was reported that Zahir Khadir, a Tangistani adherent of Darya Beggi, had collected 250^ men at Ahrem to assist him ’ The latter had sent some messengers to deliver an ultimatum to Rais Ali and Hussain Bakshu, the recalcitrant Tangistani chiefs. The former was to give up Dilwar to Zahir Khadir, who would instal a customs official, and be responsible ior the revenue. Rais Ali and Hussain Bakshu were to refund^ at once all moneys and goods plundered by their followers at Bushire. On the 25th June Zahir Khadn attacked Ahrem and captured it. The same afternoon Darya Beggi left Mokam for Bune Gez On the 30th June news was received from Darya Beggi from biiamsniri, the village of Zahir Khadir, to the effect that Rais Ali and Hussain Bakshu had bolted and taken to the hills, abandoning their villages, Dihvar and Ambarek. Darya Beggi had placed Dilwar under the control of Zahir Khadir s son, and had installed one Muhammad Bakir as customs director there. On the same day news was received that Darya Beggi had demanded compensation from Hussain Bakshu for loss, etc., but having received no reply, had bombarded, captured, and burnt his village, Ambarek. Darya g Beo-o-i caused a lot of date trees, valued at some 2,000^ tomans, to be cut down as a punishment. It was reported that Darya Beggi was going to attack Dilwar on the 1st July, as Rais All had refused to pay the fine demanded, and the Peisepo is was to leave on that day to co-operate from the sea. Ras All reoccupied Dilwar on the 5th July. Bunder Abbas. Owin o’ to the lull in the activity of the Lari Seyyid during June caravans once more ventured to take the road. The main caravan route to Kerman appeared ior the time to be fairly safe. ^ B g X OKES, Major, A f ilntriwi A tinrllP124 No. 221. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received August 30.)

Yesterday, however, I received another telegram from Resht, saying that his departure had encountered opposition. I am telegraphing to ask for information of a more definite nature. All the communications which we have addressed to the Persian Government on behalf of the Zil-es-Sultan have elicited nothing but a verbal answer. It was given us on the 18th August, and was to the effect that His Highness would Le allowed to return safely to Europe at once, but he is still being pressed for monev by the committee. The time has come, I think, for us to use greater insistence. A joint note from the two legations, issued under instructions from the two Governments, appears to me to be the best method of dealing with the case. The Zd-es-Sultan is willing, I think, to pay something in the way of a ransom, and the note would simply ask that he should be freed from molestation and permitted to go (piietly to Europe. No. 222.

In this note the proclamation of an amnesty for political offenders in Tehran itself is announced, but a reservation is made with regard to certain “traitors” (named in the note) who are at present in bast. In deference, however, to the Russian legation and Turkish embassy, which are affected by this exception, the Persian Government Avill postpone their trial, exiling in the meanwhile the persons in question. Any sentence which may be passed on them during their absence may be executed in the event of their returning to Persia. The Persian Government at the same time ask the legations concerned to hasten their departure, and to impress upon them that the legation’s protection will be forfeited should they return to this country.12a No. 225.

Inclosure in No. 227. Minute by the RireciorGn-cliief of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated August 26, 1909. n\T Hp 13th July 1909, the British Minister at Tehran addressed a letter to the director of telegraphs/Mi'. Barker, in which he said “ Owino- to press of business I have not been able before to express my high appreciation of the courage, coolness, and good sense shown by the British community durin“the very trying conditions of last week. I beg you to be good enough to convey this message to the members of your staff, and to express to them my gratitude for their conduct. ’The distance between the telegraph quarters at Tehran and the telegraph office, which is situated in the artillery square, is over a mile. The square was held by the Royalists, and the streets outside by the Nationalists. During the four days, 13th to 1 Gth July, there was heavy firing going on incessantly between the attacking and defending forces. All the telegraph signallers, however, regularly attended at the office when due for duty, and ran the risk of being shot as they walked to and from the office in the firing that went on. The telegraph office could not deliver messages, but the urgent messages from the British and Russian Ministers received from Gulahek for the Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, the Nationalist leaders, were telephoned to the telegraph quarters and delivered from there by the general service clerks, as the Persian messengers were afraid to venture out. A repair to the telephone line to Gulahek was carried out at much risk by a general service clerk, as the head gholam hesitated to expose himself until the clerk accompanied him. In fact, all the staff behaved admirably under very trying conditions. I feel sure that it would be an encouragement to the telegraph staff at Tehran, and in Persia generally, if the Secretary of State would be pleased to recognise the good conduct of the men at Tehran. I would therefore ask that I may be allowed to notify to the staff at Tehran that the Secretary of State had much appreciated the coolness, courage, and cheerful spirit with which, it had been reported to him, the telegraph staff* at Tehran had carried out their duties during the fighting in July last between the Royalist and Nationalist forces.

I should like to take this opportunity of recording how highly I have appreciated the privilege of being able to work during the recent crisis with such a colleague as M. Sabline. His loyal co-operation and assistance have left me profoundly grateful.12 ? No. 231. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received September 27.) Sir, Gulahek, September 9, 1909. DURING the past four weeks the principal seats of disturbance have been the Kerman district, where a large band of Arab robbers has been ravaging the country and the neighbourhood of Sultanatabad, where the depredations of the Lurs, noticed in previous monthly summaries, still continue. In the north there have been affrays between the Russian consular escort at Urumia and some Kurds at a village near and between some of the Russian troops at Tabreez and a band of fedai near Marand. But except for the above there have been no serious disturbances. While lawlessness is rife on most of the southern roads, especially on the Bushire-Ispahan road as far north as Abadeh and on the Kerman-Yezd route, no disturbances are reported from the principal towns in the provinces, and in the capital perfect order prevails. Government is still entirely in the bands of the committee, now generally known as the “ directoire ” ; the composition of this body has been slightly modified by the admission of some of the Cabinet members, notably Sardar Assad, Minister of the Interior, and Sipahdar, Minister of War—a change made in the interest of harmony between the body which really governs and the ministers who exist merely to carry out its orders and maintain the semblance of a Cabinet. I notice in one of the numbers of the Times ” which has just reached, me that, according to its St. Petersburgh correspondent, a pessimistic view is taken in Russian official circles of the situation, and it is asserted that anarchy is increasing in several provinces, that the roads are infested by robbers, and that commerce is said to be losing heavily. I gather from this telegram that an impression prevails in St. Petersburgh that things in Persia are wmrse after a month of the new Government than they were under the late regime. I do not think that this impression is warranted by facts. It is nothing new that the roads are infested with robbers. The same might have been asserted, at any time during mv year’s experience of Persia. The allegation that commerce is losing heavily is one that was made with equal truth under the late regime. I believe that the northern customs receipts are increasing rather than falling. Nor is it true, I think, that anarchy is on the increase. There are disorders in certain districts, hut this also is no new thing, and until the country receives substantial pecuniary assistance it would be folly to expect in this respect any great improvement, no matter what Government rules in Tehran. At the present moment the Government is living from hand to mouth on what it can collect by means of forced contributions fiom reactionaries, supplemented by meagre doles from the heavily pledged customs. iey derive nothing from what is usually the main source of revenue, the ma ia., which I understand they do not feel strong enough to collect till the Medjhss meets. They are thinking of pawning some of the Crown jewels; but these expe dients afford no means for a systematic attempt to pacify the disturbed districts and merelv enable them to carry on. Whether they will suffice to keep them going till the meetino - of the Medjliss, which will commence its sittings as soon as a quorum ot deputies is present at Teh ran-probably in the middle of next month-remains to be seen. What is certain is that they will not apply to the two Governments for an advance, which they know must mean at least supervision of expenditure, until t icn need is extreme, and then the sooner a substantial sum is advanced the better. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 232, Sir G. Barclay lo Sir Edward Grey .—(Received September 27.) Gutahek, September 9, 1909. ’ IN my despatch of thd 12th August t forwarded copy of a protocol signed by Mr. Churchill and M. Baranowsky, the dragomans of the two legations, and the delegates of the Persian Government, recording the arrangements which had been made for the surrender of the Crown jewels by the ex-Shah and the grant of a pension to him of 75,000 tomans per annum, and fixing the 17th August as the dale ot ins departure. It had been intended that this protocol should be ratified by the repre-seniatives of the two Powers and the members of the Persian Cabinet; but before the date fixed for Mohammed Ali’s departure, certain questions were raised which were not dealt with in the protocol, which was therefore never ratified. 1 now enclose copy of the protocol which has taken the place of the abortive one. This instrument contains much that was in the previous one, but it also embodies the results of the negotiations relative to the questions, the raising of which made it impossible to send Mohammed Ali away on the date originally fixed. Two of these questions involved long discussions with the Persian Government. You will notice that these questions—that of the ex-Shah’s debt to the Russian Bank and that of the departure with Mohammed Ali of the reactionaries in bast in the Russian Legation—are, in so far as the protocol settles them, arranged as desired by the Russian Government. The Persian Government takes over the ex-Shah’s debt and raises his pension to 100,000 tomans a-year, receiving in return the surrender of His Majesty’s private estates. The details of the arrangement for the transfer of the debt are in process of negotiation between the Russian Bank, the Russian Legation, and the Persian Government. The security is to be the northern customs receipts, and the debt is to carry 6 per cent, in the place of the 9 pei: cent, or 12 per cent, hitherto borne. As regards the react.onaries in the Russian Legation, they are to be allowed to depart with Mohammed Ali, provided they give their power of attorney to their repre sentatives, whom claimants may sue in the presence of a member of the Russian Legation. ^ The question whether the presence of a member of the legation is to be admitted in cases where the bastis are sued through their representatives for matters arising hereafter, e.a., disputes about Kanat rights, is left for settlement later between the Russian Legation and the Persian Government, and in this connection I transmit copy of a joint note which my colleague and I have addressed to the Persian Government. The four words, “ pour les affaires passees,” referred to in this note were the subject of long discussion in our negotiations. The delegates of the Persian Government strongly pressed that they should be inserted in article 9 after the words “ poursuite civile.” This would have excluded the presence of the member of the Russian Legation from cases in respect of claims arising hereafter. The contention of the delegates as regards bastis was quite in harmony with the view which this legation has taken in the past, that bast does not cover the future; but amongst the persons at tlm Russian Legation were certain “ Russian-protected persons.” These are on a different footing, and I could not deny that so long as the persons in question enjoyed Russian protection, and my Russian colleague was not prepared to with draw his protection, they were entitled to the intervention of the Russian Legation, and I therefore supported my colleague. I should mention parenthetically that the delegates of the Persian Government refused to recognise the Russian protection enjoyed by these persons as other than the ordinary protection afforded by bast, and so strong is their feeling on this question that, if my Russian colleague gains his point in the negotiations foreshadowed in the enclosed note, they will probably prefer that the bastis proper should be given the extension of their ordinary privileges involved by an admission that bast covers the future as well as the past, than that any distinction should be made between those who are merely bastis and those who besides being in bast are Russian-protected persons. As we could not agree on the point at issue, it was decided, in order not on this account to delay Mohammed Ali’s departure, that we should present to the Persian Government a note recording that the question should be left in suspense. Ihe enclosed protocol was signed by the two representatives last night, and is to^ be signed by all the members of the Persian Cabinet this morning.. All the stipulations, the execution of which was prescribed as a preliminary to the ex-Shah’s departure, have been carried out, and it is hoped that by the afternoon Mohammed Ali will be able to leave the Russian Legation with the reactionaries in his suite.

WITH a view to accelerating the departure from Persia of His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza, ex-Shah of Persia, who at the moment is under the protection of the British and Russian legations, the British Minister and the Russian charge d’affaires on the one part, and the Ministers of the Persian Government on the other part, have agreed to draw up the following protocol:— Article 1. His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza having declared that he has delivered up to the Persian Government all the jewels and other articles belonging to the Crown which were in his possession, the Persian Government will prepare a list of all jewels and other articles delivered up to them, and will forward to the two legations a list of those which are missing, and of those which have been exchanged, and the two legations will obtain from Mohammed Ali Mirza exact explanations with all possible details as to the whereabouts of these jewels and other articles, and in the event of any of these being still in the hands of His Majesty himself or in those of the persons who are in “ bast ” in the Russian Legation, or in the event of any of the details being incorrect, the two legations will do everything in their power to procure the restitution of such articles. Art. 2. If from the 3rd (16th) July, 1909, it is proved before the tribunals of the two legations that His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza has sold, pledged, or caused to disappear subsequent to that date any jewels or other articles belonging to the Crown, the value of such articles shall be deducted from his pension by the Persian Govern ment, if it is impossible to restore the articles themselves. Art. 3. His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza will deliver up to the Persian Govern ment all documents in his possession relating to the Crown jewels which have been pledged at banks or other money-lending establishments, or with private individuals in return for advances made to His Majesty, and the Persian Government shall have the option of redeeming any jewels so pledged. Art. 4. All personal debts of His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza, whether to the Discount Bank of Persia, totalling on the 1st January, 1909, 1,413,434 tomans 6 krans 85 centimes, including interest, or to foreign subjects, contracted before the 3rd (16th) July, 1909, communicated to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs before the 19th August (1st September), 1909, which must all be proved and duly substantiated by proper documents, will be transferred to the account of the Persian Government, who will be responsible for the payment of these amounts. The details of these transactions will form the subject of special documents, which should be signed at latest on the 29th August (11th September), 1909. Art. 5. His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza will hand over to the Persian Govern ment the whole of his personal estates, which are chiefly in Azerbaijan. His Majesty wi'l hand over to the Persian Government all documents concerning them, and willsign a special document transferring them to the Government. As regards the estates mortgaged to the Discount Bank of Persia, the latter will deliver to the Persian Govern ment a document confirming the transfer. In case of dispute as regards the estates, the registers of the Persian Government shall in principle he taken as the basis of a settlement. Art. 6. The Persian Government will grant to His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza and to his family, with the exception of His Majesty Sultan Ahmed Shah and of Mohammed Hassan Mirza, the present valiahd, an annual pension of 100,000 tomans, payable quarterly in advance through the Discount Bank of Persia, from the date of the departure of His Majesty from Persia. Art. 7. In the event of the decease of His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza, the Persian Government will grant to his widow and children, with the exception of His Majesty Sultan Ahmed Shah and Mohammed Hassan Mirza, the present valiahd, a pension of 25,000 tomans annually, to be divided amongst them. In the event of the decease of any one of these persons his share will automatically cease to be paid. Art. 8. His Majesty Mohammed Ali Mirza will leave Tehran and go abroad forty-eight hoiirs after the signature of this protocol. Art. 9. As regards the persons at present in “ bast ” at the Russian Legation, who will enjoy the privileges of “ bast ” for their past political actions, and a list of whom has been communicated to the Persian Government in the note from the Russian Legation No. 349 of the 20th Shaban (6th September), it is agreed that they shall not depart from Persia without leaving at Tehran an agent appointed according to conditions laid down, and that in the event of civil proceedings being hereafter instituted against one of these persons, such agent shall be required to attend the meeting of the Persian court, in the presence of a member of the Russian Legation, to answer and make reparation on behalf of the person he represents. This clause, as far as it concerns the presence of a member of the legation, being an exception, does not constitute a precedent. Art. 10. If any one of these persons returns to Persia he shall not enjoy the privileges above mentioned, and he shall not be received as a “ basti in either of the two legations. Art. 11. The two representatives undertake to give His Majesty Mohammed Ah Mirza strict injunctions to abstain in future from all political agitation against Peisia, and the Imperial Russian Government promise on their side to take all effective steps in order to prevent any such agitation on his part. If His Majesty Mohammed A i Mirza leaves Russia, and if it is proved to the satisfaction of the two legations that in any country other than Russia he has carried on political agitation against ieisia, t e Persian Government shall have the right 'to cease payment of his pension.

Inclosure in No. 233. Monthly Summary of Events in Persia {August 7 to September 8, 1909). Tehran. THE piotocol diawn up the 3rd August, which provided for the departure of the ex-Shah at latest on the 17th August, was not ratified or carried out, and after protracted negotiations another protocol was drawn up and completed by the 7th September providing for a pension of 100,000 tomans for Mohammed Ali Mirza who transfers all his personal property to the Persian Government, which also takes over his personal debts, including one to the Russian Bank amounting to some 300,000/. Ihe negotiators on the part of the Persian Government were the prominent members of the Nationalist committee, known as the £ ‘ Uirectoire,” including Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab, Taki Zadeh, Yosouk-ed-Dowleh, Mustashar-ed-Dowleh, and other prominent Nationalists. r The elections for fifteen members for Tehran for the National Assembly were completed in the middle of August. The following persons were chosen : 1. Haji Seyyid Nasrullah. 2. Ehtesham-es-Sultaneh. 3. Yosouk-ed-Dowleh. 4. Hakim-ul-Mulk. 5. Sadik-i-Hazret. 6. Musteshar-ed-Dowleh. 7. Taki Zadeh. 8. Zoka-ul-Mulk. 9. Sani-ed-Dowleh. 10. Hussein Kuli Khan Nawab. 11. Assadullah Mirza. 12. bheikh Mohammed Hussein Yezdi. 13. Yahya Mirza. 14. Motamin-ul-Mulk. 15. Yahid-ul-Mulk. On the 1st September Mohammed Hassan Mirza, the Shah’s younger brother, was officially pioclaimed as valiahd, and on the same day a general amnesty for political past offences was proclaimed. Many conditions were, however, attached to this amnesty. Yezn Akrem, who was appointed governor of Tehran in August has been replaced by Motamid-i-Khakan, a brother of Sadik-es-Sultaneh. The Tehran edition of the Habl-ul-Matin ” newspaper has been suppressed and the editor punished for publishing a seditious article. At present there are about ten newspapers in Tehran, of which several are dailies. The “Iran-i-No” for Modern Persia) is the latest. ^ , The Government appears to be in the hands of the Nationalist committee mentioned above, with whom it w^ould seem that Sipahdar, the Minister of War is not in sympathy. Most of the deputies elected for Tehran for the National Assembly133 are members of this committee. They have maintained order in Tehran, and have sent troops to Tabreez and Shiraz. In spite of forced contributions levied from the upper classes, they are m urgent need of money, and have applied to the Imperial Bank for an a.lvance of 100,000 tomans on jewellery, to be sent to the Credit Lyonnais, Paris, valued at o00,000 tomans. The Bakhtiari and fedai are, on the whole, behaving well. One of the latter murdered two persons, and wounded a third in the bazaars a few days ao- 0 , and was subsequently court-martialled and shot. The last public execution was that of Mir Hashem early in August. This man was a noted bad character who had been in the employ of the ex-Shah He richly deserved his fate. J Gr. P. CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary. Tabreez. Mukhbar-es-Sultaneh, the new governor-general, arrived on the 20th August from Europe via Julfa. Some “ fedais,” who had wounded and carried off an employe of the Russian Road Company to a village between Maraud and Julfa, were attacked by twenty-five Russian Cossacks about the 10th August. The Cossacks had one horse killed. They killed three and wounded seven of the “ fedais,” the remainder fled, and the employ^ was rescued. The incident caused no excitement. Resht. The town has remained quiet. Sardar-i-Motamid has been appointed governor of Ghilan and Talish. Zil-es-Sultan, who returned to Persia from Europe against the advice of the two Powers, was arrested at Manjil when on his way to Tehran and brought back to Resht. He is not in any way ill-treated, and is allowed to move about freely, but is always kept under observation by twenty men, styled “ guards of honour.” He is understood to have given the new Government a promise to pay them 60,000L, besides forgoing the repayment of 14,000L lent by him to the Nationalists two years ago. He has, however, paid nothing, but is in communication with two of his sons in Tehran. The six members for Ghilan in the National Assembly have been elected. Some of them have already arrived at Tehran. Astrabad. Early in August Salar-i-Moazaz, governor of Kutool, demanded the payment of taxes by the people. On the latter refusing to pay he joined the Dujees, and sent some Day Turkomans to Kutool, where they burnt several villages and carried off a large number of cattle. The people then rose and plundered the property of Salar-i- Moazaz, and the latter, having narrowly escaped with his life, is now trying to raise a force among the Turkomans The Jaferbai and Day Turkomans are said to intend to fight the constitutional Government. Repeating rifles are said to have been brought to Gunush Teppe for sale. Sipahdar has telegraphed to Salar-i-Mukarram appointing him deputy governor, and promising to send him two regiments of infantry. Meshed. The town and district have remained undisturbed. Rukn-ed-Dowleh, who has been confirmed in the appointment of governor-general by the new Government, complains that he has no power. The local Assembly have informed him that he must do nothing until precise instructions reach him from Tehran. Turbat-i-Haidari. The news of the deposition of Mohammed Ali Shah was well received at Turbat. The British and Russian consuls were invited to and attended an entertainment in honour of Sultan Ahmad’s accession. Rafat-ed-Dowleh arrived at Turshiz and took up the appointment of governor on the 11th August. [824] K 6In the middle of August Shuja-ul-Mulk with 300 horsemen was said to be near Zawa. His mission was to recover the property of the late Shaji-ul-Mnlk, which was seized by Assadullah at Doulatabad. The latter was preparing to resist, and the latest news is that he has been killed. Seistan. Hissam-ed-Howleh has been dismissed from the governorship, and Shaukat-ul- Mulk has been re-appointed to the post. The news of recent events at Tehran was received with great satisfaction by the trading and well-to-do classes at Birjand. The town was illuminated for two nights. In Seistan the news caused no excitement. Ispahan. The town has been remarkably quiet. The new chief of police is proving himself very efficient. There is, however, much discontent in the town against the incapacity of Samsam-es-Sultaneh who, on his side, appears to be more and more disgusted with his task. He states that he has several times sent in his resignation. He views with disfavour the appointment by Sardar Assad of Salar-i-Jung as governor of Yezd, and of three other Khans as chiefs of certain regiments. Salar-i-Jung arrived at Ispahan on the 22nd August, and left on the 25th for the Bakhtiari country. It is doubted if he will eventually go to Yezd. Iman Kuli Khan has been placed in charge of the Tehran and Yezd roads. Most of the roads appear to be much safer than for some time past. The Shiraz road as far as Abadeh has been quite safe lately. A caravan of 700 animals which reached Ispahan about the 14th August, gave an unsatisfactory account of the Sultanatabad road. The only robbery reported was that of the post to Tehran, near Murchikhurd, on the 2nd August. Beports from Sultanatabad describe the surrounding country as being in great disorder, owing to the depredations of the Lurs. The latter are under the governor of Burujird and the governor of Irak. Kaimakam, having no troops, is powerless to control them, or to restore order. The Kasas, Farahan, and Sareband districts have been overrun by Lurs, and it is believed that the carpet-making industry has sufiered severely. In Sultanabad many people have Bussian flags which they intend hoisting in case of danger. A Bussian flag has been hoisted over the village of Gils belonging to Saram-ed-I)owleh. It is not known if these flags have been sent from Tehran or from Ispahan. The prevailing insecurity is making the new Government unpopular. Yezd. Since about the middle of August, Yezd has been cut off from all communication by road with other places. Several large bodies of robbers, 200 to 600 strong, have- been on the move. They are reported to belong to the Arab tribes of Ears who are subject to Kawam-ul-Mulk. Many posts have been robbed. On the 24th August, two English missionary ladies returning to Yezd from the hills were robbed of their belongings and threatened by a band of robbers said to have been Ears tribesmen. His Majesty's Minister has requested the Persian Government to take immediate steps to punish the robbers and recover the stolen property. On the 28th August the town was reported to be quite quiet. The elections for the National Assembly have been delayed by the action of some town roughs, who threatened to fire on the people if the elections were continued. Salar-i-Jung, Bakhtiari, has been appointed governor of Yezd. He was at Ispahan on the 22nd August and has since gone to Bakhtiari country. He has not yet taken up the governorship. Kerman. On the 17th July a telegram was received from Sipahdar announcing the accession of the new Shah, and confirming all officials in their posts. The town was illuminated for three nights on a not very lavish scale. The Kermanis are not fond of the Kajars, and they are also sceptical as to the other tribes submitting to the leadership of the Bakhtiaris. ^ Towards the end of July there was a slight disturbance in the town, in which one man was killed and two were wounded. It arose out of a quarrel between a son of135 2rn&gt; the late Agha Bakir and the deputy governor. I he latter has resigned, and has been replaced by Nasrat-ul-Mumalik. Nizam-es-Sultaneh’s appointment to the governorship has been cancelled. On the 20th August Mr. A. Wright, of* the Imperial Bank of Persia, who left Kerman in spite of the warning of His Majesty’s consul that the road was unsafe, was held up by robbers at Nasirieh, some 60 miles west of Kerman. The robbers numbered from 600 to 1,000. They do not appear to have intended any harm to Mr. Wright, but to have wished to prevent him making known their movements to the authorities. One of Mr. W right’s escort is, however, reported to have died of wounds received from the robbers. Mr. Wright was released on the 23rd August, and was joined by Mr. James, of the Indo-European ’telegraph Department, who had come out from Kamalabad to get news of him, and to repair the telegraph line which had been cut by the robbers. They subsequently found themselves in Bafsinjan, when it was being attacked by the robbers, and though it does not appear that they were themselves attacked they were in some danger from stray bullets. The robbers later withdrew, and on the 26th August were 15 miles south-east of Kamalabad. They are said to be Ears tribesmen — Baharlus. On receiving a complaint from His Majesty’s Minister as to their conduct, the Minister of the Interior ordered Kawam-ul-Mulk at Shiraz to take immediate steps to control the tribe, which is under his orders. Kawam-ul-Mulk is reported to have started with a force for this purpose, and has meanwhile had the relatives of the chiefs of the tribe arrested at Shiraz. He has also telegraphed to the robbers that he will ravage their homes. At the beginning of September the robbers were still busy plundering villages. Kermanshah. Zahir-ed-Dowleh retains the post of governor. He is somewhat helpless against Zahir-ul-Mulk, but has been promised support by the Central Government, who have dispatched thirty Persian Cossacks and seventy irregular horsemen to assist him. Sipahdar telegraphed to the townspeople that the English and Russian nations had greatly helped in getting the constitution, and there should be no ill-feeling against them. He also telegraphed that Mukhtar-es-Sultaneh had been appointed to command the military forces in Kermanshah, and that he would arrive shortly with a regiment of his own. This will curtail the power of Zahir-ul-Mulk, in whose hands the regiments at present are. The three members of the National Assembly for Kermanshah have been elected. From a report received at this legation from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bagdad it appears that Abdullah Zinjani, a well-known priest of Nejef, went early in August to Kasr-i-Shirin to telegraph in his own name and that of Mullah Muhammed, Khorassani, that revenue should be paid to the new bhah, and that steps should be taken to quiet the people. On the 21st August the priests of Kermanshah received a telegram from Mullah Muhammad, stating that they should do their best to stop disturbances such as, he had heard, had occurred at Kermanshah, and prevent their recurrence • Two circular telegrams were received by the Governor from the Minister of the Interior on the subject of guarding the roads. Their purport was that the road guards should be dressed in uniform and should receive wages, so that they may not molest travellers, and that better guards should escort foreign travellers. Shiraz. The town has remained quiet, awaiting the arrival of the new governor, Saham- ed-Dowleh, who left Ispahan by post-carriage on the 2nd September Lieutenant Crosthwaite, who brought up the reinforcement for the consular guard, started for Bushire with five sowars, but a severe attack of fever compelled him to return to Shiraz from Dashtariin. The Arab tribes seem to have got completely out of hand the zone of their operations extending to Rafsinjan and Yezd. They interfered with telegraphic communication near Shiraz seventeen times between the 5th and 25th August, the Kawam-ul-Mulk, though among the tribesmen, appears to have been unable to control them Latest reports are, however, to the effect that he has started with a force to restore order This is the result of orders from the Central Government, The Kashgais appear to have remained quiet, and His Majesty’s consul reports that a notable feature has been the control exercised over them by Soulet-ed-Dowleh. The latter left Shnaz for Abadeh on the 16th August to meet the new governor-general. Hie mam Ispahan [824] K 4road has been completely closed by robbers as far as Abadeh, and Mr. Middleton, late of the Imperial Bank of Persia, was on the 18th August robbed on it two stages from Shiraz. He had left Shiraz without informing His Majesty’s consul or obtaining guards. At this time of year most caravans use the Sarhad road to Ispahan, and this route appears to have remained open. One hundred and fifty Persian Cossacks and 150 other horsemen left Tehran for Shiraz on the 3rd September as an escort for the governor-general. The Lari Seyyid is reported to have retaken Lar on the 30th July. His probable movements caused some anxiety, but Mr. Bill thinks that Soulet-ed- Dowleh will take care that he does not disturb the neighbourhood of Shiraz. Bushire. On the 12th July telegrams were received at Bushire stating that the chief priests of Nejef were contemplating an advance into Persia. Seyyid Assadullah convened a meeting in support of them, and a subscription was opened. 600/,. was promised, of which 240/. was remitted to Ispahan on the 16th to the Nationalist leaders. As^ soon as Darya Begi withdrew from Tangistan, Bais Ali and Hassan Bakshoo reoccupied their villages. The leniency shown these men by Darya Begi under orders from Tehran is to be regretted. Hassan Bakshoo arrived on the 29th with twenty-five men near Subzabad, 7 miles from Bushire. He was said to have come to complain to the local assembly against Darya Begi. On the 21st July, Darya Begi received a telegram from Sipahdar instructing him to inform khans, sheikhs, &amp;c., of the Nationalist success, and to order them to refrain from making disturbances, otherwise they would have to answer for the conse quences. On the same day the governor received a telegram announcing that holidays should be observed for three days on account of the accession of the new Shah. All the leading people were summoned, and the telegram was read to them. The bazaars were closed, and there were some illuminations and fireworks. The local assembly meets several times a week. On the 26th July the departure of the reinforcement for the Shiraz consular guard was discussed as also were telegrams on the subject received from the Sardar-i-Assad and others. Sardar-i-Assad said in his telegram that strict orders had been sent to Soulat-ed-Dowleh and to Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari not to make trouble. Seyyid Assadullah telegraphed to these two leaders in the same sense. At a meeting held on the 2nd August, Darya Begi read out two telegrams from the Minister of the Interior. One called upon his Excellency to recover 1,200/., robbed from the Bundar Abbas Customs, and also the rifles stolen from the Bushire Customs. The second telegram directed his Excellency to expel Seyyid Shubber from Lingah, apparently on the complaint of the Customs Department. Seyyid Assadullah called upon the members to help Darya Begi to carry out the orders regarding the recovery of money and guns. In regard to the second matter, it was decided that Sheikh Ali Dashti should go to Lingah and enquire into the matter, in case the affair had been misrepresented by the director of customs. A suggestion was made by Seyyid Assadullah that the Assembly should nominate a small court of justice to settle cases. The Bushire-Shiraz road has lately been in very bad condition, there being constant fighting at Konar Takhteh. Caravans have recently been using the Firuzabad route. Bunder Abbas. News was received on the 16th July of the Nationalists’ successes at Tehran, and that the Shah had taken refuge in the Bussian Legation. The telegram conveying the news was publicly read in the house of Sheikh Ali. News of the accession of Sultan Ahmad Shah was received with great pleasure by the people on the 18th, the bearer of the good news, the Persian telegraph official, being publicly presented with a robe of honour and a gold watch. The whole bazaar was closed on the 17th July, and a meeting of the leading men was held. C. B. STOKES, Major, Military Attache.No. 234. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—-(Received September 27.)

COUNT BENCKENDORFF came to tell me to-day that he was going away for a holiday. I took the opportunity of impressing upon him the importance of a reduction in the number of Russian troops in Persia. Count Benckendorff said that things were not altogether quiet. Incidents were constantly occurring, and he thought it would be difficult to withdraw all the troops. I replied that I had not spoken of complete withdrawal, though of course I should be very glad if the Russians considered such a step to be possible and safe. I had mentioned only reduction. The Persian Governor of Tabreez appeared to be a really good man, who would work with the Russians, and I was constantly impressing upon the Persian Government that it was in their interest to be on good terms with Russia. But the retention of so large a number of Russian troops galled Persian feeling. Count Benckendorff asked whether I had lately had complaints from the Persians on the subject. I said that I had not heard from them lately, because the answers I had given to the Persian Minister here had not encouraged him to make representations to me. I had taken the line with him that this question of troops was one between Persia and Russia, and that Russia must judge for herself what the situation required for the safeguarding of her interests. I pointed out to Count Benckendorff, however, that if, when the Medjliss met, the Persian Government could point to a substantial reduction in the number of Russian troops this would undoubtedly have a good effect on Persian feeling. It would be regarded by the Persians as evidence of good faith on the part of Russia, and would make it more easy for them to show a trustful and friendly spirit. I said that I had spoken to him now in order that when he was in St. Peters burgh he might impress upon the Russian Government the importance which I attached to the point. I heard that the Russian Minister at Tehran had already expressed the opinion that a reduction of troops was possible. Things might, therefore, already be moving in the right direction. But if this were not so, and if Count Benckendorff were unable to say in St. Petersburgh that I had spoken to him on the subject before he left London, the importance which I attached to it might not be understood. Count Benckendorff told me that his Government greatly appreciated the way in which Sir George Barclay had co-operated with M. Sabline at Tehran. In reply, I expressed my very warm appreciation of M. Sabline’s loyal attitude. He had shown true statesmanship, under very difficult circumstances, in laying the foundation of co-operation. I am, &amp;c. E. GREY.Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.-—(Eeceived October 7.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, October 7, 1909. . . RUSSIAN troops. I consider that the present moment would be a very good one for the recall of the Russian force stationed at Kazvin. The Enzeli-Tehran road is safe, and order has been perfectly maintained in the capital. Lately there have been fewer signs of anti- Russian agitation, but with the continued presence of troops at Kazvin they will doubtless recur. There has been no occasion for the troops to deal with the dangers which they were intended to combat. As regards the future, although it is impossible to say for certain that disturbances may not occur, the present moment is so opportune for the recall of the Russian troops, and the possibility of danger to foreigners, in my opinion, so remote, that the occasion should not be lost for carrying out a step which, in the event of the anti-Russian feeling being fanned into open agitation, would become more difficult for Russia to take with a good grace.

The leaders of Shahsevan tribes, who had submitted themselves to Sattar, will not oppose Rahim Khan, and have vacated the town. Rahim Khan is apparently also supported by a powerful Karadagh chief, Zergham, who was supposed to act against him. “My Russian colleague has received for transmission to ‘His Imperial Majesty Mohammed Ali Shah, Russian legation,’ a telegram from Rahim Khan, and bearing his signature with that of several Shahsevan leaders. They declare that they will not acknowledge the new regime, and that they will march on the capital after having laid waste to Ardebil. The day arranged for this move has, however, gone by, and up till now they have restricted themselves to the north-west of Ardebil and to a little plundering. “ Russian consul-general promises to reply that the addressee has left Tehran and to return the telegram. “ Mukhber-es-Sultaneh. is preparing to deal with the situation, but he considers that it presents no serious danger.

SAZONOW informed me to-day that to-morrow or the day after the papers would announce the withdrawal to Russia of about 900 men from the force at Tabreez. This meant, he said, that half of the present garrison would be brought home. I told him that this was satisfactory news, and would, I trusted, have a good effect in Persia; and I enquired whether some similar reduction could not take place in the force at Kazvin. M. Sazonow said that the moment had not yet arrived for reducing the Kazvin force ; it was impossible to say with certainty what the immediate future would bring forth, and there were only 1,600 or 1,700 Russian troops at Kazvin. He hoped that what the Russian Government had decided upon in regard to the Tabreez force would be taken as a surety of their good intentions. M. Sazonow said that he had just received information that the Shahsevans had recommenced pillaging round Ardebil. They were acting on their own account with no political objects—nothing beyond pure and simple brigandage. Sattar Khan was to have re-established order there, but he appeared to have been unable to effect anything. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON. P.S.

He promised to acquaint me in due course with the details. I have, See. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 247. Sir G. Barclay to Sardar Assad. Excellency, t # Gulahek, September 23, 1909. B i order of His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, I have the honour to draw the serious attention of the Persian Government to the deplorablecondition of the trade routes in Southern Persia, and more especially to that between Bus ire and _ Shiraz. Phis latter route has been lately almost entirely closed to commerce owing to disturbances, robberies, and illegal exactions. A reference to the Bus hi re customs statistics of the first five months of the current year wdll show what disastrous results this state of things has had for the Persian treasury, but I am princi- pa y concerned now with its effect on British interests, and it is my duty to impress on tie eisian Government that the losses incurred by British commerce owing to the laiiure o± the Persian Government to maintain order on the roads in the south are a matter or grave concern to His Majesty’s Government. I am to urge upon you the necessity or taking the necessary steps to render these routes secure, and in particular i am to insist on the suppression of the illegal exactions on the roads in accordance with article 4 of the Anglo-Persian commercial convention of 1903. . ^P^ rt the robberies to which goods are subjected when passing along the bhnaz-Bushire route, the accompanying statement of illegal dues* levied between Busline and Kazerun ivill show your Bxcellency that they amount, over a distance of no more than 100 miles, to a sum of 15 kraus per mule load, or over 100 krans per ton. I am to insist on the removal of this heavy and illegal burden from which British trade is the chief sufferer, without delay. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 248. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 25.) Sir, ^ ^ ^ Tehran, October 7, 1909. DURIXG the past four weeks the working of the Government has undergone some changes. In my telegram of the 13th September I reported the dissolution of the “ Directoire.” It was given out at the time that Mohammed Ali’s departure from Tehran had so far cleared the situation, that there was no further need of the existence of a committee for superintending the proceedings of the Cabinet, and henceforward the latter was to act independent^, and the body hitherto known as the “ Directoire,” enlarged by the addition of a number of new members, was to exercise merely advisory functions. For a time after the “ Directoire ” ceased to exist, its most prominent members, such as Taki Zadeh and Hussein Kuli Khan, held themselves entirely aloof from the Govern ment, and the Cabinet was left to itself. This arrangement did not answer, as the Ministers, deprived of the support of the men who will doubtless form the most influential section of the Medjliss, found their responsibilities too great, and they soon set to work to urge these men to abandon this attitude of aloofness. This they have succeeded in doing only to a certain extent, for though many of the members of the “Directoire” now attend the meetings of the Cabinet, I understand that the more important ones do so half-heartedly, and it is evident that the Cabinet no longer has such backing from them as enabled it some four weeks ago to undertake the serious responsibilities involved by some of the conditions they agreed to in the arrangement concluded with the two legations for Mghammad Ali’s departure. Quite recently its position has been strengthened, as far as appearances go, by the appointment of a Prime Minister and a Minister for Foreign Affairs. These two posts were long kept vacant in the hope that Nasr-ul-Mulb would accept them. Nasr-ul-Mulk has now express^ refused to take office for the present, and Sipahdar has been appointed Prime Minister and Ala-es-Sultaneh Minister for Foreign Affairs. I have not recently received any hint that the Government is about to apply to us for money. As you are aware, the Zil-es-Sultan has paid up 100,000 tomans, and this and other smaller contributions of a like kind, with what they can get from more regular sources, of which perhaps the mint is the most productive, should enable the Govern ment to carry on in the present hand-to-mouth fashion until the Medjliss meets. The elected deputies present in Tehran number, I am told, some forty-five, or only fifteen or so short of a quorum. From the provinces during the past four weeks the news has been, apart from the chronic disorder on the southern roads, relatively good ; No further disturbances have been reported from the Sultanatabad or Kerman districts, which were mentioned * List of rahdari charges (enclosed in Major Cox’s despatch dated July 18, 1909, to Sir E. Grey).last month as the principal seats of disorder, droops have been sent to the former district, and Ivawam-ul-Mulk has arrived at Kerman as the new governor. The Kerman district has long been suffering from want of a governor, and Kawam-nl- Mulk’s arrival seems to have resulted in some improvement. The road to Yezd is reported clear of robbers as far north as Anar. Sardar Janj, a Bakhtiari khan, the new governor of Yezd, is expected shortly at his post with 400 of his tribesmen. It is hoped that these will restore order on the Yezd—Ispahan route. In Azerbaijan I hear from Mr. Acting Consul-General Smart nothing but good of Mukhber-es- Sultaneh, who seems to be acting with firmness and tact. His task will be easier when the Russian Government act on the recommendation of their Minister in Tehran, and withdraw a substantial portion of their troops in the neighbourhood of Tabreez. 1 also hear good reports of the new governor of Bars, Saham-ed-Dowleh. He gives promise of governing with a firm hand. Disquieting news comes from the Lingah district, where Seyyid Hussein Lari is said to have taken Bastok, and to be threatening the port of Lingah. I have pressed the Government to take measures for the repression of the Seyyid and his following. I have no particulars as to the motives of this troublesome person, and the Government itself does not seem clear as to his purpose, but there seems no doubt in the minds of our consular officers in the Gulf fthat permanent tranquillity in the south is impossible while he is at liberty. Fortunately the Government are taking measures against him. Troops have been sent by the governor of the Gulf ports to protect Lingah, and Sardar Assad tells me that the Government are confident of being able to bring him under control. Lxcept for the proceedings of Seyyid Hussein Lari, no disturbances of any moment have been reported to the legation. Indeed, I may say that during the last few weeks there has been a very remarkable falling off in the number of telegrams from His Majesty s consulates in Persia, and I am inclined to think that, with the important exception of the southern roads, the general state of the country is less bad than at any time since my arrival in Persia. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. No. 249. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received October 25.) ^ Tehran, October 8, 1909. 1 HA\ L the honour to transmit herewith the usual monthly summary of events in Persia for the last four weeks. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 249. Monthly Summary of Persian Events. Tehran. AT the end of September Sipahdar, the Minister for War, became President of the Council of Ministers, and Ala-es-Sultaneh was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. M. Poklewski-Koziell arrived at Tehran on the 23rd September, and presented his credentials to Sultan Ahmed Shah and the Regent a few days later. Mohammed Ali Mirza, the ex-Shah, left Enzeli for Russia on the 29th September. Tentative proposals have been made to the Imperial Bank by the Persian Government with the object of mortgaging some of the Crown jewels, but nothing definite has as yet resulted. In the meantime the Government have obtained funds by the old-fashioned method of extracting contributions from wealthy persons. The Zil-es-Sultan was forced to pay 20,0l)0L before being allowed to leave Resht. Nizam- es-Sultaneh, Saad-ul-Mulk, and Muin-es-Sultan have each paid 3,000h,and Ain-ed-Dowleh is paying about 2,000L a-month. Prince Farman Farma resigned office as Minister of Justice early in October, but his successor has not yet been nominated.Order continues to be well maintained at Tehran by the police administration under M. Yeprim. It is said that only about 400 Bakhtiaris remain at Tehran out of the original force of some 4,000 men. the remainder have gradually returned to their own country. Those at Tehran appear to be well under control. A certain amount of dissatisfaction is felt by the general public at the manner in which the Government is being conducted. The press has taken the matter up, and has lately severely criticised the two leaders Sipahdar and Sardar Assad, for which one paper was recently suppressed. The former “ Directoire,’ composed of the Tehran deputies for the National Assembly, continues to meet and to discuss affairs of public interest, but their influence has been greatly diminished. Elections continue to be held in the provinces, and it is hoped that the necessary quorum of sixty-one members will have assembled at Tehran by the 15th October in order that Parliament should assemble. Reports received from Bagdad show that the clergy of Kerbela and Nejef continue to take a great interest in Persian affairs, and propose to select four of their number to represent them in Parliament at Tehran, though it seemed improbable that the scheme will be carried out, as there is no unanimity among the ulema. G. P. CHURCHILL, Oriental Secretary. Tabreez. The Russian Minister at Tehran informed Sir G. Barclay early in October that he had advised his Government to make a considerable reduction in the number of Russian troops in Azerbaijan. In the middle of September Sattar Khan was dispatched to Ardebil to restore order. His arrival there has had a good effect, and the country round Ardebil is reported quiet. Uesht. The ex-Shah arrived at Reskt, on his way to Russia, on the 27th September. He reached Enzeli next day, and left for Petrovsk on the 30th. On the 30th September His Majesty’s vice-consul learnt that Hussein Khan, Kasmai, who, with twenty-five Lesghis, was in charge of Zil-es-Sultan, intended to molest the latter, and should he refuse to pay in cash the 60,000Z. demanded by the Government to remove him to Rahmatabad. On the 16th September Zil-es-Sultan finally agreed to pay the amount demanded, and arranged with the Imperial Bank of Persia to pay 20,000L at once, and the remainder in four monthly instalments of 10,000/. each. Zil-es-Sultan left Resht on the 26th September. _ He stated that he would travel to London by Baku, and would go later on to the Riviera. He expressed his intention of returning to Persia next spring. Saad-ed-Howleh and the Imam Juma of Tehran, twx&gt; of the persons ordered into exile by the new Government, have been detained at Resht on their way to Europe until they have appointed agents at Tehran to settle any clyims the Government may have against them. . • -i p i During the past month two nationalist soldiers, convicted of murder, were hanged in front of the governor’s house. Zenjan. During the past month the situation here has caused some anxiety. Influenced by a prominent mullah, Kurban Ali, the people refused for some time to accept the governor appointed by the Government. It appeared at one time that troops might have to be sent, but tbe latest news is to the effect that the people have made their submission, and that the governor, Moin-ed-Dowleh, who is now on his way to his post, will be peaceably received. Meshed. According to the governor-general, the state of things in Khorassan appeared to be growing .steadily worse. The assembly and the priests both seemed to be tired of Rukn-ed-Dowieh, and the former telegraphed to Tehran asking for his dismissal This request is believed to be the result of an intrigue by certain personswho wished to get Ain-ed-Dowleh appointed governor-general. The Minister of the Interior conversed by telegraph with the assembly. He demanded 20,000?. in four days. It was agreed that the monev should be paid in four months. Major Sykes thinks it unlikely that the money will be collected. One of the leading priests, Fazil, was shot dead towards the end of August. His death was said to have been ordered by a secret society in Kesht. In Darra Gaz one Mirza Baba has been looting and torturing, and, according to Prince Dabija, 1,000 families have fled across the border into Transcaspia. A body of Lashani robbers has been raiding villages near Tabbas. Generally speaking, Major Sykes finds little reason for encouragement in the present situation. The elections for the National Assembly were completed by the 12th September, and the members are on their way to Tehran. Tur •bat-i-Haiddri. The report of the death of Assadullah has proved to be correct. Shuja-ul- Mulk took Zawa on the 17th August, and Assadullah was killed in the course of the fighting. Shuja-ul-Mulk then returned to Turbat and assumed the government, but as Mustafa Mirza was appointed governor he left for Karez. Sipahdar telegraphed from Tehran congratulating him on his success, and instructing him to arrest Salar Khan. He replied that the late expedition had cost him 800/., of which he had not been repaid a penny, and that until he was paid he could not undertake another expedition. Tabbas had for some months been the head-quarters of a gang of robbers, who have plundered many caravans. A force was dispatched against them from Turbat early in September. Seistan. The situation is normal. The local assembly meets three times a-week, but appears to transact but little business. Ispahan. The interest in the elections for the National Assembly appears to have died away rapidly, and a comparatively small number of voters eventually gave in their votes. The final choice from among those elected at the first election has yet to be made. Though the post had been robbed on one or two occasions, the general state of the roads appears to have improved, and no robberies have been reported to His Majesty’s consul-general. Several European travellers have reached Ispahan without incident. Kashan. A son of one Naib Hussain, a notorious bad character, recently seized and carried off to the hills part of the Government arms and ammunition. A party of Bakhtiaris has been sent in pursuit of him. I I ezd. The town has remained quiet and the elections for the provincial assembly have been completed, though attempts were made to delay them by the circulation of baseless reports of a reactionary nature. A large number of robberies on various roads is reported, and the postal service is most irregular. Kawam-ul-Mulk reached Yezd early in September, and after a halt of a few days left for Kerman. His presence had a good efiect on the local robbers, but his followers are said to have been guilty of several acts of oppression. The march of Kawam-ul-Mulk towards Kerman has for the moment opened that road. The Parsees inhabiting the villages round Yezd continue to be ill-treated. A number of them took refuge in His Majesty’s vice consulate early in October, but all but six have now left. In one week alone seventy-one Parsees—men, women, and children—left the neighbourhood of Yezd for India via Bushire. Fearful of being detained at that port, they requested His Majesty’s acting vice-consul to prevent their being molested en route. The Tafiis appear to be the worst oppressors of the Parsee community. His Majesty’s Minister has made strong representations to the Minister of the Interior both on the subject of the general disorder around Yezd and on that of the tyranny practised towards the145 Parsees. In reply he was informed that Sardar-i-J ung (Bakhtiari), the new governor, was now at Ispahan, and would proceed to Yezd very shortly with a force sufficient to maintain order. Kermanshah. On the 7th September the brother of Moin-i-Raya entered the town with a force, and being joined by friends in the town, seized certain commanding positions. The opposite party assembled at the house of Zahir-ul-Mulk. The bazaars were closed. Moin-i-Raya himself was outside the town with a force, and had the support of the majority of the tribes. The Minister of the Interior summoned Zahir-ul-Mulk and his sons and Moin-i-Raya to Tehran. They disregarded the summons, but became recon ciled a few days later. The danger of disturbances is for the moment averted. The town itself is quiet, and a system of police is being organised. Outside the town there is still much insecurity, and the governor has not the power to enforce his own orders. A large pilgrim caravan was looted outside the town, the victims including Afghan, Turkish, and Russian subjects. It is reported that the goods have been recovered, but the report lacks confirmation. Kerman. The town has remained quiet. Kawam-ul-Mulk arrived on the 28th September, accompanied by a force, and took up the appointment of governor-general. The Fars robbers, who had been plundering near Kerman, appear to have retired before he arrived. The Narmashir district has been the scene of several robberies. A caravan travelling from Kerman to Bam was robbed of merchandise to the value of 1,200L on the 23rd September within 30 miles of Kerman. Kawam-ul-Mulk’s arrival appears to have had a good effect on the general condition of the district. Shiraz. The town has remained quiet, though in the immediate neighbourhood several robberies have taken place. Saham-ed-Dowleh, the new governor-general, was visited by Soulet-ed-Dowleh at Abadeh, whence he travelled by the main road, which, until his arrival, had been practically closed by robbers, escorted by Arab horsemen sent by Nasr-ed-Dowleh. He arrived at Shiraz early in September, and at once issued orders for the elections for the National Assembly to be held, as soon as possible. He has also turned his attention to the conditions of the roads, and has dispatched forces to open them up. At the time of his arrival the Arabs appeared to be quite out of hand, and the roads were quite unsafe, excepting only the Sarhad route to Ispahan, which Soulet- ed-Dowleh was keeping open. Yezdikahst, on the main Ispahan road, was towards the end of September surrounded and besieged by a large number of robbers, but it appears to have held its own. The main Bushire road has also been disturbed, and caravans are using the Firuzabad route. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The governor-general received instructions during September from the Minister of the Interior to move against Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari, who continues to disturb the peace of Lar and the Gulf districts. Darya Beggi remained inactive, demanding money before he would move against the Seyyid, but the latter ^ having taken Bastok, and Lino-ah being threatened by him, the “ Persepolis ” was dispatched with troops from Bushire at the beginning of October to Lingah. It seems clear that the Seyyid is a freebooter as he pays no attention to either the Central Government or the chief priests at Kerbela. From both these quarters he has been urged to cease from disturbing the peace of the country. His Majesty’s Minister has communicated the Seyyid’s actions, as reported by consular officers, to the Persian Government, and has warned them that they will be held responsible for any loss incurred by British subiects.

PLEASE refer to telegrams from Tehran of the 23rd and 24th instant concerning the disorders at Ardebil. I spoke to M. Sazonow on the subject to-day, and he told me that as Russian troops could not get to Ardebil in less than a fortnight, it was impracticable for the Imperial Government to send any for the protection of their nationals ; and conse quently he has given a warning at Tehran to the effect that in case the Karadaghis or Shahsevans inflict any injury or damage on Russians, the responsibility will fall on the Persian Government. On my inquiring whether Rahim Khan could not be persuaded by the Russian authorities to stop ravaging the district, M. Sazonow answered that a Russian doctor had urged him strongly to keep quiet, but no advice was of any avail. News had reached his Excellency of discord having broken out between the Karadaghis and Shahsevans, and this might render a solution of the difficulty easier. No. 251. Sir G.

The Persian Government should, I therefore suggest, be pressed to dispatch an important force here without delay.” The Minister of the Interior, to whom I read these two paragraphs, and emphasised the need for reinforcements, informed me that a regiment of infantry which was due at Ispahan would at once be dispatched to the aid of Saham.

Reshid-ul-Mulk, who has been sent to Sarah in command of 100 Persian Cossacks to parley with the rebels, has been entrusted with a warning in writing to the same effect for delivery to Rahim. In this latter message my Russian colleague added that he would hold him responsible, in addition, for harm caused by Shahsevan tribesmen, whom he had, it was clear, incited to rebel. These threats should produce a salutary effect. _ u Some 1,500 infantry and cavalry have left Tabreez under Bagher Khan, but until the result of the negotiations is known they will probably be stationed a few miles on the other side of Basminch. “ There is a force about 800 strong that can march when required from Maragha, under Samad Khan. “ At Ardebil there are about 1,000 men under Sattar Khan. Reactionary element enters largely into composition of Government forces, whose allegiance, although now enlisted by governor-general to cause of new regime, may be doubtful if it is thought that rebellion is favoured by Russia. An appeal to arms under these conditions and in view of the strength of the rebels would be attended by risk* Russian consul- general, whom I consulted as to whether it would be possible to use our influence in the cause of law and order, is willing to take steps in this direction, but we agreed to wait until the result of the negotiations now in progress is known. “ The troops that were sent from Tehran have all arrived here; they are composed of 200 Cossacks, and 200 Inanloo only.

Isvolsky to-day his Excellency told me that he Rared that the Russian Government might be compelled to dispatch a strong force to Ardebil. The close proximity of this town to the Russian frontier makes it difficult oi Russia to tolerate a state of anarchy there which seems likely to continue; it also appeals that Russian suojects are in danger. There are obvious reasons which make M. Isyolsky very unwilling to embark on an expedition of this nature, but Rahim Khan and his followers would be effectively suppressed if a force were sent. It would really benefit the Persian Government that the rising should be quelled if it is in any sense of the word a counter-revolution. His Excellency makes light of the idea that the situation could be effectively coped with by Persian troops. No. 257. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 5.)

All bazaars, caravan sheds, and most of the houses have been looted. Shahsevans have demanded of the vice-consul surrender to them of three persons who have taken up their quarters in consulate compound. It is feared that consulate may be subjected to an attack by these nomads, and that small consulate guard, consisting of one sotnia of Cossacks, will not be able to withstand an assault. In view of such circumstances one battalion of infantry, two sotnia of Cossacks, with two guns and detachment of engineers, have been sent to Ardebil already; another column of sufficient strength is being dis patched thither in order, should occasion arise, to take decisive action against these nomads.

I ASKED M. Isvolsky yesterday whether he had received any recent news from Ardebil. He replied that affairs were most unsettled there, but that there were about 100 Cossacks in the town who would, he hoped, be able to protect the lives of the consul and other Russian subjects, but they were hardly sufficiently numerous to safe guard the property of the latter. I remarked that the Persian Government were hastening up troops to relieve the situation. M. Isvolsky was incredulous as to the Persian forces being able to afford any material assistance ; and he informed me that he had made the Persian Government responsible for all losses and injury which might occur to Russian subjects. His Excellency said that the mixed council or committee who dealt with Persian affairs had come to the decision in principle to withdraw practically all the troops from Kazvin, leaving merely fifty or sixty Cossacks there as a consular guard. Other Cossack detachments would be left at Resht and Enzeli, but the total number of all these three contingents would not exceed a regiment of Cossacks. The rest of the troops would be brought back to Russia. He was telegraphing to M. Poklewsky to inform the Persian Government of this decision, and to explain that they would doubtless see in it a sign of the good-will of Russia and of her desire not to cause any embarrassment to the Shah’s Government. At the same time, M. Poklewsky was to warn the Persian Government that if in the future events were to occur which would compel the Russian Government to send troops back to Persia, the measures which would then be taken would be on a larger scale and of more serious import than was recently the case. I have, &amp;c. A. NICOLSON. P.S. November 1.—The following official communique has appeared to-day :— “ The Imperial Government, deeming it unnecessary under present conditions to maintain in Kazvin any longer the column dispatched thither in June last, have decided to recall to Russia the greater part of that force, retaining in Persia^ only the Labinsky Cossack regiment, which forms part of the column. Half a sotnia of this regiment will remain at Kazvin as a guard to the Russian consulate in that town, and the [824j L 3remaining portion of the regiment will be quartered in Resht or Enzeli, in order to strengthen the consulate guard there. “ Should the future course of events again necessitate the reinforcement ot this military force, the Russian Government will not delay in taking the necessary measures,” A. N. No. 261. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edwai'd Grey.—(Received November 8.) Sir, St. Petersburgh, November 3, 1909. 1 HAVE the honour to report that the “ Official Messenger ” to-day publishes the following communique in regard to the situation at Ardebil :— “ Taking advantage of the unrest and total collapse of authority in Persia, the restless elements of the notorious tribe of Shahsevans, wandering near the Caucasus frontier, have of late repeatedly made raids into the Persian district of Ardebil, adjacent to the Caucasus. In the summer of this year they advanced close to the town of Ardebil, and for some time caused a complete cessation of goods traffic along the Astar-Ardebil-Tabreez road by their brigandage and pillaging; and in consequence of this an enormous accumulation of our merchandise, destined for the internal markets of Persia, was formed at the port of Astrakan. “ Owing to the measures adopted by our consulates at Tabreez and Ardebil, at the end of August (o.s.) several caravans, with the goods which had accumulated, succeeded in passing along the route specified under escort of Russian Cossacks. At the same time the 8hahsevans commenced to move off towards their encampments. “ However, as early as the beginning of October (o.s.), rumours arose of a fresh expedition of these nomads into Ardebil; and, further, this raid acquired a certain political character through the co-operation of the Karadaghis, under the leadership of Rahim Khan, who is known in connection with the siege of Tabreez. The Shahsevans and Karadaghis were ostensibly advancing in defence of Mohammed All, the dethroned Shah, and with the intention of abolishing the Persian Constitution. In view of the alarm which was raised in Ardebil, the governor-general of Azerbaijan ordered the well-known Sattar Khan to proceed from Tabreez to Ardebil with a column of his fedais. He was at the same time instructed to restore order in Ardebil and to take measures for curbing the licence of the local fedais, who for the most part come from the Caucasus. Upon his arrival at this town, Sattar first of all attempted to disarm and banish from the town all Caucasians, but this attempt met with no success. At the same time the Shahsevans and Karadaghis were approaching Ardebil, pillaging mercilessly the villages en route. The greater part of Sattar Khan’s fedais deserted their leader and returned to Tabreez. “ On the 12th (25th) October, Rahim Khan, with the Shahsevans, entered Ardebil itself and engaged in a fight with the few defenders of the town. Sattar Khan, with the governor, shut himself up in the citadel, leaving the town to its fate. Latest informa tion is to the effect that Sattar Khan fled to Sarah, half-way to Tabreez, where he is now, apparently, surrounded by Shahsevans who persistently demand his surrender. “In view of these events, which took place with extreme rapidity, the Persian Government ordered the dispatch of troops from Tabreez to Ardebil, and also two sotnias of Cossacks with machine guns from the Persian Cossack brigade. However, the column was delayed in leaving Tabreez through lack of financial and military supplies, and the column from Tehran, owing to the distance, will probably not reach Ardebil for some time yet. “At the same time the Russian consul at Ardebil has at his disposal only one sotnia of Cossacks with two machine guns, and in order to avoid the risk of splitting up this small force for the protection of the dwellings and offices of Russian subjects in various quarters of the town, the consul proposed that all Russian subjects should collect in one place under the protection of the consulate guard, leaving their property in their houses. The Russian Minister in Tehran was to hold the Persian Government respon sible for the value of such property, as also for all losses generally suffered by Russian subjects. Simultaneously, the acting consul-general at Tabreez informed Rahim Khan that responsibility for the safety of Russian subjects is laid personally on him. The above-mentioned proposal of the vice-consul at Ardebil could not be carried out owingto the fact that the local inhabitants, fearing for their lives, hastened to conceal them- selves in the houses of Russian subjects, thereby preventing the latter from leaving their homes. At^ the same time the Shahsevans and Karadaghis were heavilv bombarding the citadel, situated next to our consulate, which was therefore in the sphere of hre. In view of such a situation, and of ihe undoubted danger threatening our vice- consul and Russian subjects, the Russian Government have taken measures for the immediate reinforcement of the consulate guard at Ardebil by any portion of the troops in the adjoining military district of the Caucasus, as the arrival at Ardebil of any portion of the Russian columns at Pabreez or Kazvin would require much more time.” I have, &amp;c.

I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Inclosure in No. 262. Memorandum by Acting Vice-Consul Cowan. IN obedience to His Majesty’s Minister’s instructions, I accompanied the ex-Shah on his journey from Tehran to Enzeli, as representative of the British legation.

He was accompanied by the ex-Queen and the Anderun, and escorted by 120 Persian Cossacks under a Russian officer, by three Indian sowars from the British legation and three Russian Cossacks from the Russian legation. The whole party was under the charge of Captain Khobaieff, aide-de-camp to the ex-Shah. Besides the immediate suite, the following also took this opportunity of leaving the country: Amir Bahadur Jang, his brother and nephew; Mujallal-es-Sultaneh, Muwakker-es-Sultaneh, Arshad-ed-Dowleh, and Baron Staudach (Mispah-es-Sultan). _ Owing to the bad condition of the horses provided for the ex-Shah by the Persian Government, progress was very slow, and Enzeli was not reached until the 28th September. The journey was uneventful, and he embarked for Russia on the 30th September. Amir Bahadur and those with him had left on the preceding night. _ Amir Bahadur, though outwardly cheerful, was hurt on account of the little notice which the ex-Shah took of him. Indeed, he hardly spoke a word to him during the whole journey. N. P. COWAN. No. 263. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 9.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 9, 1909.

The Russian force will preserve order in the [824] L 4town, and if the Persian troops arrive no fighting will be allowed in the town, though, I am informed by M.

Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 22.) ^ St. Petersburgh, November 12, 1909. I ENQUIRED of M. Isvolsky yesterday whether he had received any further news from Ardebil. He replied that his latest intelligence was that Rahim Khan had nominated a governor of the town, who had taken up his residence in the citadel with a certain number of men. The bulk of Rahim Khan’s forces were assembled in a fortified camp close to the town. Rahim Khan had paid a visit to the Russian consul and had reiterated his demand for the surrender of those who had taken asylum in the consulate. He had also expressed his “fidelity” to Russia, and had suggested that that country should take over all the districts in Persia where her troops were located The inhabitants of Ardebil, who were overjoyed at the arrival of the Russian troops* were now appealing to be made Russian subjects. M. Isvolsky said that it was unnecessary for him to tell me that all the above requests and suggestions had been refused. I asked if Rahim Khan had returned to the subject of his march on Tehran His Excellency said that he did not know if the Khan had again alluded to the subject. I said that 1 understood that a considerable and fairly well-equipped force was hastenincr towards Ardebil from Tehran. His Excellenc}^ said that the two forces would probably153 come into collision, and if the Government troops were to win a victory it wonld be a satisfactory sign that the Persian Government were capable of re-establishing order with their own resources. If, on the contrary, Rahim Khan were to obtain the upper hand, he might march on Tehran or Tabreez with the prestige of success. It was SINCE my last review of the situation disturbances have broken out in eastern Azerbaijan, where Rahim Khan and the Shahsevans are seriously threatening Ardebil. Rahim Khan is stated to have given out that he is acting in the interest of Mohammed Ali, but his previous record tends rather to the supposition that it is a looting rather than a political movement. However this may be, the Persian Government are con centrating all their efforts to deal with this brigand chief. Mukhber-es-Sultaneh has sent from Tabreez reinforcements to the number of 1,500 for Sattar Khan, who has with him a force of 1,000, and a further force of 1,500 is being dispatched from Tehran. These latter troops should be a good fighting force, as they comprise, amongst others, a number of Persian Cossacks and of Bakhtiari, as well as some 300 Mujaheddin (nationalist volunteers who fought under Sipahdar at the time of the revolution) commanded by Yeprim, who was the leading spirit in Sipahdar s force, and has since been doing excellent work as chief of police in the capital. Except for Ardebil, my information shows that the state of public order in the provinces is relatively satisfactory. Seyyid Hussein Ran has been summoned to Tehran, and I have heard no more of Lingah’s being exposed to danger from this turbulent seyyid. The Yezdikasht district, on the border of the provinces of Ears and Ispahan, is suffering from the depredations of the Kuhgelus, and at this point traffic is held up on the Shiraz—Ispahan road, but, apart from this, the state of the southern roads shows some improvement. The roads from \ ezd to Ispahan and Kerman are now open to traffic, and it is reported that caravans have recommenced running on the road from Bushire to Shiraz, though I learn this morning that the Kashgais are blocking the road between Kazerun and Shiraz. In Tehran there is no sign of any trouble, and the Resht road seems to oe quite safe. Early in the period under review there was some discontent amongst a number of the Mujaheddin. The meetings of some sixty or seventy of these to protest ao-ainst the alleged misappropriation of funds by Sipahdar gave occasion for alarmist rumours but the movement was entirely pacihc, and there was never any ground for apprehending trouble. Sipahdar, the Prime Minister, visited one of their meetings and apparently satisfied the malcontents, for there have been no more of these miniature demonstrations. The situation of the Government remains apparently what it was four weeks ao-o. On the surface the advanced Nationalists seem to be co-operating with the Government, and indeed one of them, Vussuk-ed-Dowleh, has joined the resigned in the hope of getting a better post in the next Ministry. Nevertheless, the opinion is general that when the Medjliss meets a determined attempt will be made to upset the Ministry. More than sixty deputies are said to be now m Tehran. A quorum Tor the meeting of the Medjliss is sixty-one, but it will not open until there is sufficient margin; taking into account the possibility of some of the elections being found to have been irregular, a fortnight may the: efore elapse before the Assembly necessary to retain the Russian troops at Kazvin until the issue of the conflict was decided. M. Isvolsky said that his news from Tabreez was not satisfactory. There were apparently serious dissensions between Sattar Khan and the fedais on the one hand and the governor-general on the other; and the Russian consul seemed to fear that disturbances might occur.

This appointment is a new departure, as Vosouk-ed- Dowleh has so far never held Ministerial office. Nasr-ul-Mulk arrived at Tehran on the 30th October. ^ The Government is still of a provisional nature pending the convocation of Parliament, and the Ministers are assisted by the committee, which has periodical sittings to discuss matters of public interest. The proceedings of this committee are published in t he press, and these accounts seem to show that the committee acts as a f)rovisional Parliament. Foreign and internal politics are discussed and the acts of the Ministei s are criticised, and general supervision over the Government is exercised in a somewhat informal manner. Ihere are about sixty-four deputies in Tehran, which is just over the necessarv quorum of sixty-one, but there is as yet no sign of the convocation of Parliament. It is said that the credentials of some of the provincial candidates are probably not in order and it is preferred to wait for a substantial majority in order to be certain of a quoium. The Parliament building, moreover, which was nearly wrecked by the bombardment of 1908, is still undergoing repairs and does not appear to be nearly ready. It is hoped, however, that the House will sit before the end of November G. P. CHURCHILL. Tabr eez. The nineteen members of the National Assembly for Azerbaijan have been elected. Ihey are on the whole, men of integrity, and, if led properly by capable party leaders, should become a useful force for reform. Five of them, including Taki Zadeh and Musteshar-ed-Dowleh, were members of the former National Assembly. Only four lesser mollahs are included in the nineteen; this is indicative of the eclipse of clericalism, perhaps the most significant feature of the election. Seventeen of the nineteen members belong to Tabreez itself; it is regretted that the outlying parts of the province are not better represented, but this is to some extent due to the electoral law itself. In the opinion of the governor-general the system of direct election would have secured a juster and wider representation in Azerbaijan. With the exception of the Ardebil district Azerbaijan has remained quiet. The trouhie at Ardebil is due to Rahim Khan, who, immediately after the withdrawal of the Russian detachment from Ahar, collected a force, and at the same time instigated the Shahsevans some of whose chiefs had already made terms with the new Govern ment, to rebellion. The combined forces had by the 22nd October, practically surrounded Ardebil, and a good deal of fighting took place. The telegraph-lines were cut, so that news was much delayed. The governor-general took immediate steps to155 collect a force to relieve Sattar Khan, who, with 1,000 men, is in Ardebil, and by the 28th October Bagher Khan, with 1,500 cavalry and infantry, had started from Tabreez, while Samad Khan, at Maragha, had 800 men ready to march when ordered. The governor-general had meanwhile dispatched Beshid-ul-Mulk, with 100 eisian Cossacks, to Sarab to negotiate with the rebels. _ Reshid-ul-Mulk took with him a letter from the Russian consul-general, informing him that he would be held personal y responsible for harm to Russian life or property. M. Miller also instructed the Russian vice-consul at Ardebil to convey this message to Rahim Khan. it ^^°P ea that these communications may have a good effect. From Tehran a force oi 1,600 men of all arms with three guns has been dispatched to Ardebil under the command ot M.

General Snarski and his staff left on the _21st October. On the 23rd October the S Russian consul-general stated that there remained 1,000 men at Tabreez, 100 infantry at Urumia, and 1.00 Cossacks at Ardebil. Kazvin. One thousand six hundred Russian troops are still at Kazvin and detachments have been placed at each stage on the Resht road during the past month. The Russian Government has now decided to withdraw all but sixty men from Kazvin and 400 from Resht and Enzeli.

Complaints of the plundering of the Kasas district by Hussein Khan Zarghan, Bakhtiari, having reached Tehran, the Minister of the Interior directed his brother, Haji Khusru Khan, to proceed from the Bakhtiari country to Irak, to punish the offenders and restore the plunder to its owners. Khusru Khan went to Irak and about ^ the 15th October telegraphed to Tehran that he had carried out his instructions. This, Mr. Strauss says, is not the case. He states that Haji Khusru Khan joined forces with Hussein Khan Zarghan, and plundered some villages and two Lur tribes, and that large flocks of sheep have been driven off to the Bakhtiari country. His Majesty’s Minister has drawn the attention of the Minister of the Interior to Mr. Strauss’ report and the Minister has promised to enquire into the truth of the statements made in that report. In Sultanabad itself a leading priest who according to Mr. Strauss, enjoys the support of the Bakhtiaris, is tyrannising the people’ I he present governor appears to be worse than useless. r Yezd. O 11 ^ 16 28th September the suburban Parsee village of Kasimabad was raided by laltis who beat men and women and carried off three men besides much plunder. The prisoners were subsequently released after some ill-treatment on payment of a ransom. On the 29th the inhabitants of Kasimabad and a number of Parsee priests, merchants anf ^ ( P^^ e . rs f rom th e town took refuge in the vice-consulate against the oppression of the laftis, who were at the time very active all round Yezd, raiding the villages and plundering the people. They remained in refuge until the 19th October when the new governor, Sardar-i-Jang, Bakhtiari, arrived and assured them that they should be protected and the Taftis punished. The new governor’s arrival has had a very good efiect on the situation and the roads are now open and safe. Kermanshah. A reconciliation between the two factions in the town has been effected through Daoud Khan, the Kalhui chief. He is to preserve order outside the town, and a commission of notables inside. The governor having received ho troops from Tehran has informed the Central Government that he accepts no responsibility. Humours of dissensions at Tehran have had a disturbing effect and until affairs at the capital are constituted on a firm basis no progress is to be expected in local affairs. Daoud Khan hap been appointed by the Central Government “ chief of the tribes.” He collected the chiefs, who swore to act with him. It is said that he advised them to avoid paying taxes and to make raids, but not to attack pilgrims or merchants’ goods. If the new regime prove permanent and he is called on to restore order, he will reply that this can only be done it the chiefs are paid to establish a police force. Most of the property taken in the robbery reported in last summary was restored to its owners. Kerman. The town and district have remained quiet. Bafat-i-Nizam was summoned to Tehran from Bam, whereupon the people of Bam closed their shops and took refuge in the telegraph-office, protesting that they would not let him go, as he was protecting them against the raids of the Baluchis. He, however, started for Tehran on the 25th September. All the^ Baluchi chiefs are said to have made peace among themselves each keeping to his own fort and district. Shiraz. . The ne 'Y governor-general, Saham-ed-Dowleh, has displayed extraordinary enemy in putting into order the administration of the province. He has established a ''7 b , el A ° f bureau y ea ?h wit h a definite task-e.g,., Justice, Police, Army, Revenue Tribal Atiairs—and insists on the work of these bureaux being done. He'has reduced Nasr-ed-Dowleh to abject submission, and compels him to accompany him in all his157 official work. He signalised his arrival by hanging a well-known ruffian who was in the personal employ of Nasr-ed-Dowleh. This, combined with exemplary punishments in other cases, has helped to establish his authority. For the moment all opposition is paralysed, but the governor-general has made many enemies—especially the clergy—and His Majesty’s consul considers that it will be a miracle of successful bluff if he manages to maintain himself. He has already made some progress in the settlement of British claims. The general situation may be summed up as follows : The governor-general has frightened everyone with whom he has come in personal contact, mainly by his perfect self-confidence and placid ignoring of all difficulties, but it seems unlikely that the same impression will be produced by his lieutenants in other parts of the province, and it remains to be seen whether his authority will survive the first serious check which it may receive, unless he receives reinforcements of some kind with which the inhabitants are not too familiar. The unknown factor in the situation is the attitude of the tribes towards the new regime. As the arrival of Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari, who has been summoned to Tehran, at Shiraz might lead to disturbances Mr. Bill considers it best that the rein forcement of the consular guard should remain there until either troops arrive from Tehran, or Ears is guaranteed safety from the Seyyid. Haidar Khan of Kamarij has died of a wound inflicted by one of his servants and his followers have left Kazerun. The road between Kazerun and Konartakhteh is reported to be most unsafe. It is said to be in the hands of Kashgai tribesmen, who are reported to be engaged in plundering. This recrudescence of disorder is unfor tunate as caravans were once more just beginning to use this route to Bushire. Persian Gulf. Bushire. The local assembly has continued to meet two or three times a week, but does not appear to have transacted any business of importance. At the instigation of the agent of Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari it telegraphed to Tehran endeavouring to show that the Seyyid was a Nationalist and innocent of the charges of robbery, &amp;c., brought against him. In reply it was enjoined not to interfere in the matter. Ling ah. On the 30th September a telegram was received at Bushire from His Majesty’s consul at Bunder Abbas, stating that he had received a report from the residency agent at Lingah, to the effect that Seyyid Abdul Hussein Lari had taken Bastok, that the inhabitants of Lingah were panic-stricken, and many were leaving the place. Ihe governor-general, who was at Bunder Abbas, assured Captain Bae that the town would be safe, as he was sending the “ Persepolis with troops to defend it. Mohammerah. Fakhr-ul-Mulk, the new governor of Arabistan, assumed office at the end of September. His arrival coincided with the recurrence of robberies on the Shuster- Dizful road, where the Sagwand tribe looted 700 animals and theii loads. The governor appears to be powerless. Sardar Arfa was requested by the Central Government to continue de facto governor of Arabistan, as he was when Haji Saif-ed-Dowleh was governor. He replied that he could not undertake to do this, and that, Fakhr-ul-Mulk having been appointed without consulting him, the respon sibility of governing Arabistan must be with him only. Sardar Arfa has now with drawn his nominees from Shuster and Dizful, and a recurrence of trouble there is to be expected. &amp; B _ ^ Military Attache.No. 270. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 24.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 24, 1909. SITUATION in Eastern Azerbaijan. In continuation of my telegram of the 11th November, I am informed by His Majesty’s acting consul-general at Tabreez that Ardebil has been occupied by 3,200 Russian troops. The regiment which I reported was to be held in readiness at Astara is evidently included in this force. No. 271. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 25, 1909. M. PASSEK, Russian consul-general at Bushire, and M. Kadlobowsky, late acting consul-general at Bushire, were attacked on their way from Shiraz to Bushire two stages out from Shiraz, near Dastarjin, by Boarmadis, a branch of the Kuhgelu tribe. Several members of the escort were wounded, and one Russian Cossack was killed. M. Passek and his party have retreated on Khan-i-Zinian. The telegraph doctor, Woollatt, accompanied by His Majesty’s consul at Shiraz, with an escort of Indian sowars and Persians, have gone to their assistance. I have approved Mr. Bill’s action in accompanying Dr. Woollatt, as it would be unsafe for the doctor to proceed thither escorted oidy by Persians. No. 272. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 25.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 25, 1909. IN continuation of my telegram of the 25th November. M. Poklewski informs me that several caravans, doubtless for the sake of protection, had joined M. Passek’s party. They were ambushed by 250 tribesmen yesterday morning. Casualties included some twelve Persians attached to the caravans, among whom was a local official commanding the caravan guards, in addition to those reported in my immediately preceding telegram. Fighting lasted half-an-hour. The tribesmen robbed the caravans. No. 273. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 27.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 27, 1909. PLEASE refer to my telegram of the 18th July. I am informed by the Persian Government that the appointment of Azad-ul-Mulk as Regent has been confirmed by the Medjliss. No. 274. Sir A. Nicolson to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 28.) (Telegraphic.) St. Petersburgh, November 28, 1909. M. ISVOLSKY spoke to me yesterday, in the course of an interview, on the subject of the regrettable incident in Southern Persia, i.e., the recent attack on the Russian consul. His Excellency observed that the acting Russian consul had been on a previous occasion attacked by the same tribesmen and that no reparation had been4 ..J - 159 made. The punishment of the delinquents and the payment of compensation would, however, be insisted on by the Russian Government this time, and representations would be made to the Persian Government. He added that the evacuation by Russian troops was delayed by such incidents. No. 275. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edivard Grey.—{Received November 28.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 28, 1909. EASTERN Azerbaijan. I am informed by His Majesty’s acting consul-general at Tabreez that Shahsevans have gone into winter quarters at Moghan and that Rahim Khan has retired to Karadagh. No. 276. Sir G. Barclay to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 29.) (Telegraphic.) Tehran, November 29, 1909. I HAVE received a telegram from His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz, reporting disturbances yesterday in the town. The rioters looted the apartments of the governor- general, and he was obliged to leave Government House to escape from them. Riots have temporarily subsided, but Mr. Bill fears that they will again break out, and doubts whether authority of governor-general can be re-established. For the past fortnight there has been unrest at Shiraz, of the details of which I am unaware, and more than once governor-general has announced his intention of resigning unless troops were sent to his assistance. I do not know who could fill his place if he carries out this threat. I have pressed Persian Government to dispatch a force, and it is said that a regiment has left Ispahan already for Shiraz.
