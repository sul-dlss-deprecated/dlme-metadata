The report focusses on trade; in particular: the importance of Bahrain; the abundance of cheap Japanese goods (cotton, silk and pearls), which has been damaging the local production; the poverty of the locals; British commercial interests (Imperial Airways); the blockade of Kuwait by Ibn Saud; the import of motors and goods from Britain and the USA; and currency. The file also contains correspondence between the Political Agent in Kuwait and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, regarding the establishment of a depot for American oil machinery at Basra.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Vice-Consul, Bushire</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x00018b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
