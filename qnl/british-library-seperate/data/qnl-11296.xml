Asiatic Turkey and Arabia. Confidential. [July 3] Section 6.’ It summarises past correspondence (dated from February 1904 to May 1907) between Government officials on Britain’s policy of confining their influence to the coastline of eastern Arabia, and not interfering with Ibn Saoud’s [‘Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd (Ibn Sa‘ūd)] affairs in the Arabian region of Najd. The subheadings in the outer margin, alongside each paragraph, indicate the author, number and date of the correspondence being summarised. There is a handwritten addition to the memorandum, written in red ink at the top of the first page, which reads: ‘Memorandum B 200’.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Najd</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x00021b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
