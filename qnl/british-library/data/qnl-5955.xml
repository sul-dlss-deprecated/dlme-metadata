The latter, when he heard of the arrangement, protested vigorously on the grounds that he nad called before Shaikh Abdullah Salim on rally’s arrival, but was told that the arrangement would have to stand. On the appointed day, however, Abdullah Salim failed to appear until after mullah Muoarnic had called. He made his call two hours after the time fixeu and offerred no explanation or apology. I have not yet bean able to discover how Abdullah Mubarak achieved his end. lieutenant Colonel A. C. Galloway, O.B.S., Yours sincerely, BushireH Office of the Political Resident^ Persian Gulf, Camp, Shiraz, Dated 13th August, 1945. c^JLjP^r \ Oi . « i CONFIDENTIAL \n 0 jEL Wi Will you please refer to your letter No. C/656 July 19th 1945 ? There is no doubt that according to our calendar the 25th anniversary of Shaikh Ahmad*s rule falls on the day you mention, but I cannot see that there is any particular reason for us to celebrate. It is primarily a Kuwaiti matter, and the Kuwaitis decided that the anniversary fell last year. 2. Besides this the Shaikh, as you say, has recently been awarded the K.C.S.I. Personally I think that that is sufficient reward for his general bearing towards us. 3. The presentation of an expensive launch would first of all be a matter for the Admiralty, and the reasons you give to support an approach are not, in my opinion, sufficiently strong. Besides this I should prefer to regard the gift of the launch (which was no great shakes unless my memory deceives me) as the gift it was and leave it at that. 4. As regards oil. I see you have put forward the earliest estimate of production from June 1946. There will undoubtedly be some celebration to mark the production of oi}., but as the date is so uncertain it is premature to make any programme now. The same applies to the movements of H.M. ships. 5. I suggest you refer the matter to Sir Geoffrey Prior later.
