Inside of the naos-shaped top is a small cat below the clappers. \r\n\r\n", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1913", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/15898", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "[Found in Upper Egypt]; Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1913, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2014-11-25T01:00:00.87", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "2172", "Images": "PS1_54.493_3QtrLft_DD_T13.jpg, PS1_54.493_3QtrRt_DD_T13.jpg, PS1_54.493_Back_DD_T13.jpg, PS1_54.493_Fnt_DD_T13.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not on View"}
