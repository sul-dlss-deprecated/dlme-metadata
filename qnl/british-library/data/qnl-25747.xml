THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration two Notes by the Petroleum Department (Papers Nos. M.E. (0) 293 and 299) and a Memorandum hy the War Office (Paper No. M.E. (0) 295), THE CHAIRMAN reminded the Sub-Committee that they had had this question under consideration at their last meeting on the 20th December. 1933, The Memoranda now before them arose from the conclusions of that meeting. He asked whether the War Office had any comments to make on the explanations provided by the Oil Companies through the Petroleum Department. It appeared that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company was well alive to the dangers involved in employing German personnel. COLONEL CA /THORN said that the explanations were satisfactory as far as they went,, but the War Office felt that the employment of Germans, however well they were watched, entailed serious risk of sabotage in war. MR. STARLING pointed out that the Iraq Petroleum Company was an International Company, in which British interests only held a share of the capital and that the Government were not in a position to dictate to the Company, COLONEL CAWTHORN referred' to action taken by the French in similar cir^uius+^nces in only allowing foreign personnel to be employed for a certain time and in restricted numbers. He understood that the Iraq»• petroleum company v/as not prepared to accept any restrictions of this kind. The High Commissioner in Palebtine had a definite j scheme for dealing v/ith foreign employees in emergency, hut if no period of tension preceded hostilities, acts of saootage might he committed before they could he stopped. MR. STARLING explained in reply to a question hy the Chairman that the employment of these Germans arose from the placing of the contract hy the Iraq Petroleum Company with a German Company, on purely commercial grounds. WING COMMANDLR ELY said t .at the Air Ministry had recently received information from the Air Staff at Hahhaniyah that, in the event of a crisis the British Authorities could lay their hands on German employees with comparative ease. The Air Staff had heen in close touch with the Embassy on this matter hut so far as he was aware the Iraq Authorities had not yet heen approached. It was rather a delicate matter since the Iraqis were responsible for internal security. Since recent correspondence from the fknoassy had indicated that the Iraqis were prepared to take a strong anti-German line it seemed an opportune time to take up this question with them to ensure that effective measures would he taken if the need arose. He suggested that the Foreign Office might therefore communicate v/ith the Emoassy on this subject, COLONEL CA/THORN remarked that the Par Office had already heen in communication with the Foreign Ofiice on the subject, and had suggested th&lt; t this question should he dealt with early in the joint Anglo-Iraqi discussions now in progress on the Iraq Defence Plan. CONCLUSION . THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To take note that the far Office were still uneasy regarding the employment of Germans in oil installations in the Middle East. (h) To recommend that action should he taken hy the petroleum Department to suggest to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Iraqi petroleum Company that every effort should he made to reduce the employment of Germans in such installations. - 2 -t loU (THIS DOCUliENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HIS BRITANNIC MAJESTY’S GOVERNMENT).

With reference to the 2nd paragraph of the War Office memorandum circulated as Paper No. M.E. (o) 295 the report concerning the refinery of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at Abadan has been discussed with Mr. Fraser, the Vice- Chairman of the Company, from whom the following information on the subject has been receiveds- (a) Prec au tions against sabotage . The refinery is very carefully guarded. All the important points are fenced off and there are numerous control gates which no-one other than those who work inside is allowed to enter. V/hile the possibility of sabotage cannot be entirely guarded against every care is taken and plans are in existence to tighten up the Company’s regulations at the first v/arning of any trouble. No foreigner other than an employee is allowed to enter the refinery without permission. The Company occasionally receives requests to visit the refinery and although they try to keep the numbers down to the lowest limits there occasions when it would be impolitic on their part to refuse c Last September a German press representative from the ’’Berliner Illustrierte Zeitung” (not the’’Frankfurter Zeitung”) was the guest of the company at the request of Olex the Company’s Germansubsidiary Company. He was not, however, given free access to the plant hut was only shown matters of general interest and was always accompanied by an ofiicial of the Company. (b) Aerial surveys . It is true that an aerial survey can be obtained as a souvenir but this was taken some years ago and is now out of date. Aerial surveys of the refinery have been taken more recently and. Mr. Fraser is sending instructions through the management at Abadan to the company who takes them to the effect that all such photographs and the negatives are the property of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and must not be made available to anyone else. With reference to Paper No. M.E. (0) 293, the v/ar Office have requested additional information on three points relating to the employment of Germans at the refinery which is in course of erection by Consolidated Refineries Limited at Haifa, and the particulars which have been received from Mr. Fraser in this connection are summarised below for the information of the Committee. (1) The number of Germans employed on the construction of the refinery . No Germans are at present employed at Haifa and the Company do not anticipate employing any other than the two Engineers who as mentioned in Paper No. M.E. (0) 293 are to be engaged on the erection of the S.0.2 plant - probably some time between September, 1939 and. the latter part of 1940. (2) The date of the_refinery t s completion . The Company anticipate that construction will terminate some time in the latter part of 1940.( 3 ) Whether any Germans will be employed in working the refinery after it is ~built and, if so, how many . The Company do not anticipate employing any German personnel in the refinery after it comes into operation* In connection with ( l) above, Mr. Fraser states that the 32 Germans referred to in Paper No. M.E, (0) 293 as being engaged on the erection of tankage for the Iraq. Petroleum Company are at present at Tripoli and Kirkuk. They are a 'floating” staff who will be erecting tanks for the Company in different places until about June, 1940.

(0) 289. Mr. Fraser, vice-chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and a Director of the Iraq Petroleum Company, was accordingly asked to furnish a report, and the following is a summary of the information which has been received from him on this subject, in supplementation of the particulars given to the Committee verbally. Anglo-Ira nian Oil C omp any, In Ira n. (i) At the present time there are 4 Germans working at Abadan, all of whom are employed by Contractors (one American and two German companies) engaged on the erection of certain parts of refinery plant. Their work should be completed during the next few months. (ii) A German geologist was employed by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company until 14th January this year, when his engagement expired and was not renewed. (iii) A certain number of Germans and Italians who had previously been employed on the Trans-Iranian Railway were employed by the Company at the beginning of 1938, but they all returned to Tehran soon afterwards. (iv) A German firm had a contract some ti' c ago for the erection of an Iso-Octane plant at Abadan on which some Germans were engaged, but the work has been completed and they are no longer there.*Iraq Pet roleum Co mpany This Company employs one German (Ex-Aastrian) geologist, whose contract expires in Novemher 1940. The staff employed in connection with the B«0.D. Concession, in which German and Italian interests were represented, until control was acquired recently hy the Iraq Petroleum Company, includes four Germans - a driller, a workshop superintendent and two mechanics from a German firm to run the engines supplied hy that Company. 32 Germans are at present employed hy German contractors on the erection of tanks au liirkuk, Tripoli and Haifa for the Iraq Petroleum Co. As regards the Haifa Refinery which is heing constructed hy Consolidated Refineries Ltd. (a company owned jointly hy the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and the Shell Company), Hr. Fraser states that no agreement has 'been made with the German Government, nor has one been contemplated whereby German machinery is to he installed at Haifa and only German Aryan technical experts are to he employed. As an essential part of the refinery the Company intend to erect an S.0.2 plant, which will have to he obtained from a German company and two German engineers will probably he employed by the contractors for a few months on its erection. As regards Italian personnel. Hr. I'raser states that no Italians are employed hy any of the above mentioned companies. As was indicated at the meeting of the Committee -chere are occasions when it is necessary to obtain special plant from Germany and in connection with its erection to employ German personnel. As an example of this in tnis county Hr. Fraser has stated that three Germans are working at 2 -Llandarcy Refinery on the erection of plant supplied hy a German Company. The contractors have recently sent one of them to another Refinery at Manchester where some similar erection work is taking plfce. Hr. Fraser adds that the German employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company are all most carefully watched. In addition those employed in this country are supervised hy the local police and all their movements are known. Petroleum Department. February, 1939.- 1 - EMPLOYMEN T OF GERM AN NATIONALS IN OIL INSTALLATIONS IN THE Ivlil)DLE EAST. THE SUB-COMMITTEE had under consideration a Note by the War Office (Paper No« M e E.(0) 289jo MAJOR CAWTHORN, introducing the Note, said that efforts had been made to verify the information in the possession of the War Office but although confirmation had not been obtained, the statements had not been disproved. The War Office thought that further investigation was desirable. They had evidence that the German Intelligence Service was taking a great interest in oil installations in the Middle East, especially on the Mediterranean seaboard. He suggested therefore that the first step was to verify the facts as set out. If they were found true, the Sub-Committee could then consider what steps could be taken to dispense with German and Italian employees in the oilfields, or alternatively to arrest them in war before they had the opportunity of committing sabotage. He pointed out that 'The Anglo Iraqi Oil Company' should read 'The Iraq Petroleum Company' through out the Note. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the Committee should first discuss the position in the Anglo-Iranian Company. The Government had a controlling interest in that Company, but he was not clear as to the channel by which that interest was exercised. MR, HALE thought that the proper channel was for the Treasury to make representations to the Company through th^. Government Director.MR. STARLING said that the Mines Department had a good deal of information on this subject, though their investigations were not yet complete. The position in Abadan was that the Anglo-Iranian Company was extending its refinery. The Company, in common with other oil companies, was forced for the sake of efficiency to make use of certain German patents, ana part of the plant to be laid down in the extension was of German manufacture- Skilled German employees were required to assist in the erection of such plant. The Company had, however, assured the Department that German employees are under constant surveillance and are not allowed to work alone. According to his information, the report in paragraph 1 of the Note that 25 Germans and Italians previously employed on the Trans-Iranian Railway had now received employment with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, was incorrecto Further verification of this report was necessary. The position in Iraq was that all three concessions were now held by the Iraq Petroleum Company. One concession, in which the Germans and Italians had formerly been financially interested, to the extent at one stage of a controlling interest, had now come under the control of the Iraq Petroleum Company. To secure control the latter company had had to agree to purchase German material and some 7 German drillers were still employed. In Kirkuk there were some Germans engaged on tank erection ^d some of these would probably go on in due course to Haifa.- 3 - © In response to a Question, MR. STARLING said that the Iraq Petroleum Company was under international control. The British interest was not a controlling interest. There were also American, Lutch ana French interests, and the Americans in particular took; the line that they must employ the best technical personnel irrespective of nationality. He was assured by Mr. Fraser, the Deputy Chairman of the Anglo-Iranian Company, that the position in respect of foreign employees was carefully watched, and he suggested an approach to Mr. Fraser with a view to obtaining the real facts. THE CHAIRMAN agreed that the first move was to investigate the facts, but asked what the position would be in war or in time of crisis, if it should prove impossible to obtain the removal of German ana Italian employees in peace? MR. LED saia that a somewhat similar state of affairs had recently come to notice in the copper mines in Northern Rhodesia, where, similarly, American capital had an interest in the companies concerned. The companies were being asked to give an assurance that the contracts of German and Czechoslovakian employees would not be renewed on expiry and he understood that they would be prepared to agree to this. AIR. STARLING said that certain German employees working on refinery extensions in Great Britain were recalled to Germany during the recent European crisis and actually left their posts. It might be difficult and in some cases impracticable to obtain the dis missal of foreign employees in peace. The importantthing was to ensure that they were never left unwatched. He suggested that all future reports of the kind under discussion should he referred as early as possible to the Petroleum Department. CONCLUSIONS. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed - (a) To invite the Petroleum Department to investigate as early as possible the reports of the employment of C ';;:.aar. and Italian personnel by the Anglo-Iranian Oil and Iraq Petroleum Companies in the Middle East, set out in Paper No. M.E.(O) 289. (b) To consider the result of this investigation when complete, with a view to deciding whether further action is desirable, and, if so, what form such action should take, Richmond Terrace, S.W.I., 20th December, 1938.1 - ■ (THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY 0?
