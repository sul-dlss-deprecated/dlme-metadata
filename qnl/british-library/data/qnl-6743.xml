Secret. Bagdad-Basra Railway. I. Hie present position. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March 1911, Sir E. Grey proposed that we should ask for 50 per cent, participation, and a memorandum for the Turkish Government was prepared on this basis. On the 7th April 1911 the Board of Trade wrote that there were 'only two practicable policies 1 ' (1) ' to participate in the working of the southern section on terms of equality with Germany, but to the exclusion of all third parties as regards control,' and (2) to refuse participation altogether. Xo further communications passed between the departments on this subject, but on ) 2th July 1911 a draft memorandum to the Turkish Government was privately communicated to the India Office. This memorandum contained the proposal, which was actually made to the Turkish Ambassador on 29th July 1911, that Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and Turkey, should participate at the rate of 20 per cent, each, and that a convention should be drawn up precluding differential rates on all the railways of Asia Minor. The Turkish Government replied on 15th April 1912, not expressly rejecting this proposal, but substituting 25 per cent, participation for Great Britain, France, Germany, and Turkey, to the exclusion of Hussia. But in the private discussions that preceded the despatch of this reply the Turkish representatives more than once stated in the strongest terms their objection, on political grounds, to the inclusion of Russia, and said that if His Majesty's Government pressed it they would be obliged to insist on the admission of Switzerland. This His Majesty's Government would of course not be able to accept, for it would strengthen the Bagdad Railway Company's interest at our expense. Russia, it will be borne in mind, has said that, while she only wants to help us, she wants to be admitted if France is admitted. The Turkish counter-proposal of 15th April 1912 is therefore not a mere modification of our own, but, in effect, a complete rejection of it. A new situation is thus created, and it is submitted that in the circumstances His Majesty's Government are bound to consider it on its merits, and that it is possible for us, without doing any violence to diplomatic conventions, or giving any just cause of offence to Turkey, to treat our proposal of 29th July 1911 as completely out of court, and to substitute for it a better one, if such can be found. It may be conceded that as we have actually proposed the admission of France and Russia our position is no longer as strong as it was for proposing their omission. But here the Turks have fortunately helped us. For if Russia insists on participating in the event of French participation, while Turkey will admit France but not Russia, the result is a deadlock of which the only solution is the omission of both. The following considerations are intended to show that the proposal of 29th July 1911 should not be pressed, and that the terms which Sir E. Grey originally wished to put forward are, as the Board of Trade held, the only ones on which we should now consent to participate. II. The objections to the last proposals made by His Majesty's Govern ment. —The view underlying those proposals is that, provided we can secure S. 159. Ao a convention absolutely precluding differential rates on the whole of the Bagdad Railway system, the degree of our participation in the tiulf section is immaterial, and that it is in fact woith out wlulc to puuhast the convention by abating our claims to participation. The objections are :— (а) That no convention can absolutely preclude differentiation or the application of those advantages which Protectionist countries accord their trade. This is in effect the Board of Trade view also. (б) That the Bagdad Railway Convention already does so, a« far as any convention can. See Article -4 of the ^ ahier des ( haiges . tous ' les tarifs, qu'ils soient generaux, speciaux, on proportionnels ou ' differentiels, sont applicables a tous les voyagenrs et expediteurs u sans distinction.' This applies to the Bagdad-Khanikin luancli (Article 1 of the Convention), and to the Alexandretta concession, which is given on the same terms as the Convention of 1903 except where otherwise specified. (c) Differential rates are not the only risk involved in absence of effective control. The Bagdad Railway Committee in its report of -6th March 1907, quoted Sir James Mackay's opinion that the Company, if under 'a management of Avhich this country exercised no ' influence or control' ' would lose no time in establishing a line ' of steamers from the terminus to Bombay, and in course of time they would virtually monopolize the entire trade between India 44 and the Persian Gulf, because it would be impracticable for the 44 British lines to compete against the ships supported by the 44 Railway Company, which would give through bookings and 44 through rates for passengers and cargo.' This danger would, exist the moment that the Bagdad Railway Company's interest preponderated over the British interest, i.e., the moment the latter was less than 50 per cent. Again, there is the risk (referred to in the same report) that the 44 Railway Company will make it their business to cut the freights 44 between Basra and Bagdad, so as to be able to compete with the 44 river-borne traffic,' that is to say, the Bagdad Railway Company, if preponderant on the Gulf section, will drive the steamers off the river, and then raise the rates on the railway. They will not, of ^ course, be able to do so beyond the point at which it will pay to put the steamers back on the river. But in order that we may be ready to take advantage of that moment when it comes it will be necessary that the steamers shall be there, which probably means paying Messrs. Lynch or someone else a subsidy to keep them efficient, though idle—another charge on the revenue of the Gulf Section before it can pay a dividend. (d) The Gulf section being the shortest necessarily determines the rates on the northern section to Bagdad. It is therefore our interest to have as free a hand as possible on that section. Therefore a cjnvention applicable to the whole Biigdad Railway System is a positive disadvantage to us. (e) It is our interest to have as free a hand as possible because it is essential to prevent the Bagdad Railway Company's interest from getting the preponderance. This is not sufficiently secured by the 20 per cent, participation, since we cannot depend on the permanencein all circumstances of the entente, commercially and financially (Froncli finance, for example, is notoriously hoyond the c-oiitiol of its Government); while politically it may be a serious source of weakness elsewhere (as pointed out by the \ iceroy in his telegram of 29th May— see Appendix) that we should have important commercial interests bound up with the permanence of the entente in Mesopotamia. (/) As a financial proposition it is to be feared that _ )( &gt; per cent, in an international railway 350 miles long costing less than 3,(X)0,00n/,. to construct, will not be considered worth looking at. On the other hand the facts that (1) the German Company has first of all to be compensated ; (2) rolling stock has to be provided and poits to be built; (3) the expenses of international management will be unnecessarily heavy; (4) the railway will have no prospect of paying for many years (until, in fact, Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed); (5) in the meantime there will be no guarantee (for it may be taken as certain that the Government ot' India, at all events, will give no guarantee); will be further disastrous to its flotation. The Briiish share will simply not be taken up ; and where is the Russian share to come from, when the Russian Government cannot find money for its favoured project, the Trans- Persian Railway, and Russian unofficial finance is concentrated on that enterprise ? (g) If, therefore, participation on these terms is of no value as a financial proposition, and if we have not sufficient control to prevent the Bagdad Railway interest from preponderating, there is no apparent commercial advantage in participation over non -participation. (h) The Gulf section would be a most valuable political asset if it were all British. It would still be valuable if it were British controlled, but it loses in value by leaps and bounds as British participation diminishes, until a point is reached where prestige will suffer less and dignity be better consulted if the country which owns 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping stands aloof altogether, rather than participates on an equality with three other Powers who have practically no material stake in the country at all. (?) No attempt has been made to show how the joint arrangement is to work in practice, e.cj., is the actual working agency to be international, and is it seriously thought that that would he workable ? Again, in order that the commercial interests of the line may be effectively safeguarded, it must be worked independently of, and to some extent in opposition to, the Bagdad Railway : but it is extremely doubtful whether any arrangement with this object would be found workable in practice. III. The view therefore supported is that of the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911—that the only alternatives are to participate on a 50 per cent, basis (to which it should be added that, in that case, the Chairman must be British), or not to participate at all. (a) The view that British control on the Gulf section is useless without a convention to prevent differential rates on the rest of the system has alreadv been dealt with. It has also been pointed out thatby controlling the shortest section we should, in fact, control the rates over the German section. It may further be urged that the sole effect to the Bagdad Railway Company of imposing differential rates against British goods between Alexandretta and Bagdad would be to send British trade round to the Basra-Bagdad line. ith 50 per cent., the casting vote on the Board, and a free hand as regards rates, our position would, therefore, be impregnable. (/&gt;) \\ hat would it be if we did not participate at all ? It must be premised that from the British and Indian point of view it is bettei that the railway should not be built. It must be remembered that there is no analogy between the position now and the position in 1903. Then we might have had substantial participation in the whole length of the railway, which would, besides, have admitted us to the exploitation of a new country. Xow we are offered 20 per cent, in a branch 350 miles long, which will admit other Powers on equal terms with us to the exploitation of a country of whose trade we already have 70 per cent. Politically. The construction of the railway means the military and administrative consolidation of Turkey in Mesopotamia, with an increased tendency to seek influence in the Persian Gulf, and to extend control in Arabia, and an increased power of offensive against British interests, including Koweit and Mohammera. It further means the firmer establishment of German, French, and Russian interests—with a corresponding tendency to intervene—in a region where the outside interests have hitherto been preponderatmgly British. (It is not of course suggested that we can, or ought to try to, keep every one else out; but to invite them in, and on such terms, is quite another matter.) Commercially. Our interests are twofold. There is the existing trade AVith estern Persia via Bagdad and Khanikin, and the trade which is expected to grow np when Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed The Persian trade is worth about 2,000,000j. It is difficult to forecast its future ■ but li the Trans-Persian Railway is built, and Mohammera connected with it and with Burujird, the Persian trade will presumably desert Bagdad a together. ersian Railways remain in abeyance, it is not clear that we shall be worse off than we are at present, .o long as the river between Bagdad and the Gulf ,s open, and Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges operates to prevent differential rates on the Bagdad Railway. Again, the future a trade of Mesopotamia, being mainly in agricultural products, will probably in any case flow westwards to Alexandretta. l JJoff7r n mn V*, ,rne 0Ut by the Iatest ^res available for the tiade of Bagdad, 1J10, which are as follows : Imports to Bagdad. From—United Kingdom' - . France . ' ' ^' &gt; 762 a , • -r, ' - 203,284 ■ ■ - ».«' Germany . \ . ] 211 .^ United States of America . '' India, China, and Japan - .

It is, however, possible that cotton will be grown and pressed in Mesopotamia and will find its way into eastern markets, and the mineral resources of the country (especially oil) may also add to the trade eastwards. But, speaking generally, it does not seem certain that the volume of trade resulting from the development of Mesopotamia will necessitate the construction of the Gulf se\ moii if India is not to lose its share, and it is probable that India will retain her share whether it is built or not. But, of course, it is not possible to assume that the railway will never be built. From the difficulty which it is understood that the Germans have had in disposing of the bonds of the other sections of the Bagdad Railway, and from their willingness to part with their rights in the Gulf section, it may, indeed, be inferred that they will be in no hurry to undertake the latter, while the Turks themselves have neither the money nor the means of obtaining it. The construction will therefore be postponed, but as the line is of military and political importance to Turkey—it will eventually be built In the interval much may have happened in Mesopotamia, as the Viceroy has reminded us, and it is not easy to foresee the conditions that will then exist. But, supposing that the railway is worked on commercial lines, and that the clause precluding differential tariffs is still operative, it does not appear, from the point of view of our trade, that the fact of our having no share in it will be a disadvantage. But, of course, it may not be run on commercial lines. Protected by their kilometric guarantees the Germans may prefer to let it rust—it would always be available for Turkish military purposes-- and attract all the tratlic to the Northern section. In that case, too, it does not appear that, provided the river were kept free, we should be any worse off commercially than if the line did not exist at all. Politically, no doubt, we should be, because the Turkish consolidation would be effected, and if the railway were built under German auspices, German influence would be brought very near to the Gulf. But provided that we can ensure that the line will not be carried beyond Basra or, if so, only on terms agreeable to Great Britain, and provided that we have in the meantime consolidated our own position in the Gulf, that risk might fairly be taken. The one serious drawback would be that referred to under head (c) on page 2--the danger of the extinction of the British carrying trade between India and Bagdad. Although this disadvantage might to some extent be compensated by the advantages that might accrue to other branches of trade, it is a very real one and would have to be faced. (It could only be met, apparently, by a corresponding intervvorking between steamships and railway S. 169. BW^StidHIBBTTtflrs 6 companies 011 tlie Indian side— a matter which would obviously iennire v( r\ careful consideration). Moreover, as has aliead\ ])e(-ii pointed out, it is equally attendant upon any arrangement which does not secure to this country effective control of the (iulf section. IV. The importance of the river.—The necessity of keeping the river open has been emphasised throughout these remarks. By that is meant not only ensuring that it is kept properly dredged and navigable, and that no prohibitive dues are placed upon shipping (both of which will be secured, as far as the Shat-el-Arab is concerned, by the separate Convention setting up a Riverain Commission), but also by maintaining the right of navigation as far as Bagdad. This is equally necessary, for the reasons already given, whether we renounce the Railway altogether or participate in it on terms short of effective control. It is therefore essential that the questions should at once be closely examined with a view to ascertaining exactly what rights of navi gation British shipping possesses on the Tigris and Euphrates, and what steps should be taken to put them on a secure basis. V. Conclusions. —The conclusions seem to be— 1. That, if the river is open, it is better for us that the railway should never be built ; 2. That it is therefore not our interest to facilitate it except on terms which will make it commercially and politically advantageous to ourselves; 3. That the only terms on which it will be thus advantageous are that we secure effective control, i.e., 50 per cent, participation, the casting vote on the board of management, and a free hand as regards rates. 4 That failing that, we should stand out altogether, and con centrate on getting what we want in the Gulf, and especially the joint control with Turkey of the Shat-el-Arab and the right of navigation to Bagdad, which are really the key to the situation. Mr. Brereton ((rovernment Director of Indian Railway Companies) has read and entirely concurs in these remarks so far as they touch on the commercial aspects of the scheme. \T. The practicability of obtaining 50 per cent. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March Sir E. Grey had apparently no doubt of this, and he at once proceeded to prepare the ground with France and Russia. France. —Sir E. Grey to Sir F. Hertie, No. 123, of 6th April 1911—' M. 44 Cambon . . . had told Count Benckendorff that the question as to ' whether France should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section was one ' which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to ' do so, but she did not regard it as her affair.' Russia.—Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan, No. 105, of 10th April 1011. Count Benckendorff said that ... 44 the Russian desire was to help 44 us. and therefore their proposal [i.e., to participate] would not hold if the 44 question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, that if it was ultimately decided to have P rench co-operation, Russia 44 should come in too.' The India Office has no later information than this.i Germany. —The India Office has not heard of any overtures to Germany on the subject. We know only that in 1909 M. Gvvinner informed Sir E. Cassel that the Germans had no objection to Great Britain obtaining more than 50 per cent., and that it was from Hussein Hilmi that the opposition then came. Further, in 1911, Sir G. Lowther wrote (No. 183, of 22nd March) ' Prominent Germans here have recently been hinting that ' the Turks will have to accept any arrangement come to between Berlin and ' London . . . and that we perhaps could secure a more satisfactory ' arrangement by unofficial pourparlers with Germany.' He understood that the German Ambassador (Baron Marschall), who was just going to Berlin, would speak in this sense. To these facts, which are all that are available, must be added the consideration, already mentioned, that it is in Germany's interest that the Gulf section should be built, and she is therefore not likely to place unnecessary difficulties in the way of anyone who will find the money. It is, indeed, probable that she will ask a quid pro quo. Whether her demand will be excessive cannot be known until it is made. But it will doubtless be a matter for bargaining, and in any case it is a question whether it is not better to pav Germany for something that is worth having, than lurkey for something that is not. Turkey—The Turkish attitude may possibly be hostile. For positive information we have only M. Gwinner's statement quoted above. But it is known that Turkey is very suspicious of British designs in Mesopotamia, and she will doubtless prefer an international control because of the scope which it affords for the time -honoured policy of playing off the various Powers against one another. On the other hand, (1) it is stiongl\ to her interest that the line should be built; (2) Sir G. Lowther in his Despatch No. 328, of 12th May 1911, has given reasons why she need not herself claim a large share; (3) she will not necessarily be worse off if we obtain 50 per cent, than under her own proposal. She is content now to ask for 25 per cent., and our proposal will leave her to divide 50 per cent, with Germany on the best terms she can get. Nevertheless, let it be assumed that she will object. The considerations advanced above are intended to show that no harm will result if, as a consequence, the Bagdad-Basra Railway question is withdrawn from the present negotiations. It is submitted that His Majesty's Government would have a very good case for withdrawing it. Their own attempts to find a solution will three times have failed, and it is not reasonable to expect them to go on making overtures to Turkey indefinitely. The Turkish repre sentatives, at the private conferences which preceded the official reply, made a great point of the fact that it was to oblige Great Britain that Turkey had induced the Germans to renounce their rights. It will now be for lbs Majesty's Government, while expressing thanks for this sign of good will, to regret that they do not see their way to accept the concession on the terms oiTwhich it is offered. We should say that we have shown our own goodwill by making three attempts to meet the Turkish wishes ; we will give a still further proof of it now by withdrawing all objections to the construction of the railway as far as Basra, by any one to whom they choose to entrust it, on the sole condition that they conclude with us a thoroughly satisfactory settlement on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf (including Mohammera), in return for which we will further give them the increase of Customs duties. S. 159. C© It is submitted that we may then fairly expect a full satisfaction of the demands made in the memorandum of 29th July 1911 without the necessity of contemplating any further concessions. But it is at least open to argument that the Turks will not carry their objection to the 50 per cent, arrangement to the point of letting the negotiations break down :— (1.) As has been urged above, it is important to them that the railway should be made. (2.) They know that, whatever may be the value to us of Turkish friend ship, the value to themselves of our friendship is much greater, and if brought gently but firmly up to the point, it is likely that they will think twice before sacrificing it. VII. The procedure to he adopted now. —If the above views, which are only a development of those expressed in India Office letters of 3rd and 29th March 1911, are accepted, the doubt arises whether it is worth while to press for the 50 per cent, at all; whether it is not better to abandon the railway altogether, and devote ourselves entirely to the river and the Gulf, on the lines suggested above. l)ut jf it be decided that an attempt should be made to secure 50 percent., the next question is how. This is really a question for the Foreign Office. The India Office have suggested that we should go direct to the German Government, and the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911 recommended that a confidential conference should be held with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway as a preliminary to further negotiations with Turkey. If it is held to be impossible to go to Germany independently of Turkey, the only course is apparently to inform the Turks that their own proposals being quite inacceptable, we find ourselves unable to negotiate on the basis of the German declaration of 7th March 1911, but that if they choose to approach Germany with a view to modifying this declaration so as to give us 50 per cent, and the casting vote, we will use our good offices with Germany and be willing to discuss with her the terms of a settlement on those lines, on the understanding that Turkey concludes an entirely satisfactory arrange ment with us in the river and Gulf. VIII. The alternative—It is necessary to consider the possibility that if we take either of the lines suggested, the Turks will break off the negotiations altogether, as regards both the railway and the Gulf. It is not thought likely, for the reasons suggested under head VL that this will happen, though they may hint at it by way of bluff. But ii they did, it would seem that we should be morally in a very strong position if we could come before the public and say. ' We have made every effort to meet the Turks over the question of this railway, but without success. But we do not wish to block ''it if we can get a settlement of vexatious questions in the Gulf. We have ' accordingly offered them a free hand for the railway as far as Basra *' (beyond which, if it is ever made, it will never pay) and the increased ^ customs duties in return for a recognition de jure of the position in the Gulf which we have held de facto for a century ; and they have refused.' Our polic} would then be the maintenance, by force if necessary, of that position. We should have to reckon with Turkish hostility both to ourselves9 and to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera. The kind of measures which we should take are indicated in the Government of India's letter No. 24 of 15th February 1912 :i: - ; and, if driven to it, we should declare a Protectorate over Koweit. The strength or weakness of our position would then depend largely on the state of our relations with Germany. But it would seem that Germany would have no ground for taking exception to our action if we could tell her that we had been (and still were) anxious to make an arrange ment with her, but had found the Turks so irreconcilable that they would not even accept the free hand for the railway which we had offered them. This contingency is mentioned merely for the sake of completeness. It is almost incredible that it should occur at a time when more than for many years past Turkish interests clamour for the goodwill of Great Britain. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade has read and agrees with all the above remarks. A. H. India Office, 6th June 1912. APPENDIX. From Viceroy, 2^th May 1912. Private. Your private telegram dated 25th instant. Bagdad Railway. From an Indian point of view there can be no possible doubt whatever as to relative advantages of the two proposals. We infinitely prefer the proposal for a 50 per cent, participation for ourselves in the Gulf section, leaving the remainder for disposal as Turkey may wish. We have always felt a 20 or 25 per cent, participation must necessarily involve a loss of prestige in regions adjoining Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 2bid March 1 Jll), am that it might possibly become necessary some day to give compensation to France and Russia elsewhere for their continued support of our interests in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share we can make practically sure against differentiation in rates. In considering all questions affecting Mesopotamia, it is advisable to bear in mind that the situation is a iluid pne, and it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 \eais time. Careful as we should therefore be to do all in our power to consolidate our own position and to establish a lien for the future, we feel strongly that no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf where we are able and should continue to be able to assert ourselves in maintaining it against all comers. ♦ i.e., removal of Turkish light vessel, buoys, &amp;c. ; ejection of Turks from Bubiyan and El Katr (including El Bidaa) ; occupation ot tao.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001ef_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/B188</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x0001ef</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/B188</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Bagdad [Baghdad] - Basra Railway</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1912</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-10-07T14:31:22</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (5 folios)</extent><extent>The file is divided up into thematic sections as outlined in the scope and content.</extent><extent>The file is contained within a bound volume that contains a number of other files.Foliation: The foliation for this report commences at f 7, and terminates at f 11, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
