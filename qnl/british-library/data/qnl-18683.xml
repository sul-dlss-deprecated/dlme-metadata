Steam ers Mahuniiddy, Ncrhndda, Damooda, and Lord William Bentinck, as set forth in the accompan\mg Memorandum, showing the details of the whole force, dropped down the River below the Hastings Shoal, and waited for the morning tide. . j u u ♦ A convov of Boats, containing Provisions, Stores, and Camp-followers, escorted by the Gun-boats, under the command of Lieutenant Mason, preceded the Steamers on the afternoon of the 18th. Weio hinu- at earlv day-light on the 19th, and taking the whole of the flood-tide with them, the vessels, led by the l.ord William Bentinck, proceeded up the Pegu River, and arrived in the evening at stations a few niiles below Pegu. -r^. , • • , - a The Lord William Bentinck, more fortunate than the rest, (Mr. Digney having previously acquired some know edoe of the River on a former occasion,) reached a point two miles below the position it was proposed to take up j the Dnmooda, JSerbudda, and Mahanuddy remaining for the night at stations lower down the 1 The further advance of the Vessels on the following day was tedious, and a matter of considerable difti- cultv owimv to the decreasing width and depth of the Channel, and the serpentine bends of the River. Bv the evening, the Lord William Bentinck had pushed on to a position about a quarter of a mile below the S E aiu'le of the old ruined City of Pegu ; the Nerbnddn reached a point half a mile further down ; the Damooda three quarters ; and the Mahanuddy a mile and three quarters below the Lord W ilham ^ After anchoring, the Major General, accompanied by some Staff Officers and myself, proceeded up the River to reconnoitre, and make arrangements for landing on the following morning. In the evening, and during the early part of the night, some desultory firing took place from the enemy s River Stockades on the headmost Steamer, which was returned by her and the boats, while icquet-. vveie thrown out from the Steamers on the banks during the night to prevent the accident of a night attack. The disembarkation of the Troops commenced on-the following morning, Sunday, the 21st, at 4 a. m., each Steamer landing her men on the left, bank of the River, abreast of. her own position from whence the different columns marched along the bank to the point of concentration abreast of the headmost bteamei, the Lord William Bentinck. ■ i . r ^ r At the same time the Artillery, two 24-pounder Howitzers, (which had been previously transferred fiom the Mahanaddy to the Paddle-box Boats,) were landed by the Seamen, under the directions of Commander The ancient City of Pegu is of a quadrangular form : the ruined walls or ramparts are still eleaily defin ed and are surrounded on all sides by a moat, much choked with mud and rubbish, its sides being a &gt;out a mile and three quarters in length,—the Pagoda, which forms the key of the position, lying in the iV E. division of the space enclosed by the ruined ramparts. j r j The Enemy, whose numbers are stated to have amounted to between three and four thousand, were strongly posted at the S E. angle of the walls, and also along the river front of their position, which was[ 2344, ] strongly stockadod. I he Ijiicuiy made no opposition to our landing, owing to our movements beinsucon- III . 1 /• 1 • I *1 I * .1 1 . ' O cealed by tlie rog which prevailed in the early morning. I he concentration of the 1 roops and the arrangements for the advance, were completed bv about 6-30 a. m . ; at 7 the advance commenced, the columns moving along the outer edge of the Southern moat to wards the Eastward, so as to turn the flank of the Enemy's position, their progress bein&lt;&gt;- necessarily extiemely slow, on account of the difficult nature of the ground, which was covered with high (&gt; rass and jungle, and over which there wits no regular road. Ihe Enemy immediately commenced a sharp fire, which soon caused some casualties, and as the Troops advanced along the edge of the moat, they moved along the ramparts parallel to them, and maintained a constant fiie. At about 9-15 the European Iroops who were in advance reached a point opposite to a broken opening in the rampart, where the moat seemed passable, and after a short halt to refresh the men, and form them undei covei of a wood, they advanced at 9-45 a. m . in column of attack, charged gallantly across the moat, entered the line of the Enemy's defence, and drove the Burmese before them,—the 5 Enemy retreating towards the Pagoda. I had remained a little behind to assist the advance of the Artillery, about which the General had been anxious, and on my ainval at 10 a. m . had the satisfaction of seeing our Troops in possession of the Enemy's ramparts. After i efieshing the men, the Iroops advanced, at 10-45 a. m ., to the left along the bund, towards the line ()f tue iivei defences, foi the purpose of dispersing the Enemy in that quarter ; but on perceiving them in full letreat towards the Pagoda, owing to the efficient fire of shell and canister, which from the com- mencement of the afiair had been kept up on them by the Lord William Bentinch and the Gun Boats, General counteimatched the lioops to the right a^ain, and returned to our original position. At 12 o'clock the columns again advanced by the direct road leading towards the Pagoda without meet- ing any opposition, and on arriving near it, at 0-45 p. m . the columns were formed for the assault. On approaching it, we perceived some Burmese stealthily watching our movements ; our men advanced with a lush, the enemy fired a volley and fled, we entered the Pagoda, and Pegu was ours. It could scarcely be expected that this service could be performed without some loss ; and I regret to say that the Military force had six men killed and thirty one wounded, including, among the latter, three Officers ; most providentially none of the Seamen in the Boats or on board the Lord William Bentinck, (which vessel alone was near enough to take part in the attack,) were either killed or wounded, althouoli ^Continually exposed to a warm fire. It is with much gratification that I have to report to Your Excellency the zeal, energy, and &lt;&gt;ood con duct of the Officers and Seamen attached to the Expedition. io Commander Rowley Lambert, of H. M. S. Fox, praise is due for the able manner in which the Guns were promptly landed by the Seamen under his directions, and subsequently for the efficient manner in which he directed the fire from the Gun Boats on the enemy's position, bv which they were ultimately dislodged. Messis. Digney, Poiter, Berwick, and Simson, respectively Commanding the Honorable Company's ^ tea me is, desei ve great credit for the perseverance and energy they displayed in pushing their Vessels up the llivei, under circumstances of most difficult navigation, as well as for their general assistance. Lieutenants Mason and Glover, and Mr. Pocock, Mate, and the subordinate Officers in charge of Boats acquitted themselves to my entire satisfaction. 1 he services of Mr. J. K Johnson, Assistant Surgeon of U. M. S. Sphinx, were extremely valuable in attending on the wounded, many of whom were sent on board the Lord William Bentinck at the com mencement of the afiair. Commander Beauchamp Seymour, R. N., accompanied the Expedition as a volunteer, and was present with the Major General Commanding throughout the operations of the day.

S ir, In continuation of my letter No. 7, relative to the Expedition to Pegu, I have the honor inform Your Excellency that, in accordance with the wishes of the Major General Comm -Anding the Forces, the Troops whom it wa* proposed should return to Rangoon were embarked on board ;iie lion ble Com pany's Steamers Mahannddy, Damooda, and Lord William Bentinck, on the evening of the 22nd The two latter Vessels left for Rangoon on the morning of the 23rd, and General Godwin and Sta I , having embarked on board the Mahanuddy during the afternoon, that Vessel proceeded, and returned to Rangoon at noon this day. A Garrison of 430 men remains at Pegu, 230 Europeans and 200 Sepoys. The Major General at first wished the Nerhudda to remain at Pegu for a few days, but having subse quently changed his mind, I ordered that Vessel to return also, and desired one of the Sphinx's Saddle- box Boats to remain until further orders. Mr. Bamadistan, in charge of the Yawl of H. M.S. Winchester, arrived at Pegu, with a Convoy of Provision Boats from Rangoon, on the morning of the 23rd. i have instructed that Officer to return to Rangoon with the empty boats as soon as they have been cleaied.

ALLEN, Esquire, Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. Dated Pegu, November 22nd 1852. S ir, I have the honor to state, for the information of the Governor General in Council, that Pegu was captured yesterday. In June last, I was induced, by strong representations from various sources, to send a siiia'i force to drive out some Burmese from Pegu. We had had some friendly intercourse with the inhabitants of that place, who declared to me that if they were put again in possession of their' town, they would be able to hold it. There was an armed party ofTaliens at the time from the villages around, who promised their support. The Burmese were driven out, and the people recovered possession of their town, but, as I feared, they did not hold it a week. At this time it would have been inconvenient in many ways to have stationed a force there at the com mencement of the monsoon. Since that time I have had various reports of the enemy being in great force at Pegu, and that they had thrown up strong defences on the River, and from it to the Pagoda, within the site of the old city they became troublesome also to several villages between this and Rangoon. As the Army will shortly be at Prome, with a garrison only at Rangoon, it became imperative to^ke possession of and garrison Pegu. T I had determined upon this for some time, and the three small River Steamers, with the Mohnnnddy havin'-i-eturned from Prome on the 16th of November, I arranged with Commodore Lambert, tnat the troops should embark on Thursday evening, the 18th, when 300 men of the 1st Bengal l; usiliers, unc ei Lieutenant Colonel Tudor; -300 of the 1st Madras Fusiliers, under Major Hill; 400 men of the oth MadrasN. 1., under Major Shubrick; 70 Sappers, with two ^4-Pounder-Howitzers and 32 Artilleryni^a, em barked by 7 o'clpek p. m. This force I placed under the command of Brigadier McNeill, of the Madras Army. I also embarked with my own Staff in the Mahanuddy, for the purpose of accompanying the Expedition. Commander Shadvvell, of the Royal Navy, had charge of the Flotilla. Tlys town is situated about 60 miles from Rangoon, on a fine creek called the Pegu River, which runs into the Rangoon River, just below the town of Rangoon. We started on Friday morning, the 19th, at day-break, and in consequence of the shallow water were obliged to anchor about two miles below Pegu at sunset, on the evening of the 20th. The troops commenced disembarking at 4 a m . the next morning, and were all assembled on shore by ^ pastf) o'clock, and when I joined the force at this hour, 1 found it buried in high grass jungle, and the whole country enveloped in a thick fog. I was in some degree aware of the position of the Enemy, from a plan I had had in my possession for some time, furnished by Captain Latter, he having accompanied the former expedition in June, but not the particul&amp;rs of it until I saw it on the ground. The site of the old City, wherein the Enemy was posted, is formed by a square, surrounded by a high bund, each side of which is presumed to be about two miles in length, the West side facing the river, and the square is surrounded by a wet moat, between 70 and 80 paces wide. From the South-west angle there is a causeway over the moat, close to, and parallel with the river. This causeway the Enemv had made exceedingly strong by traverses, and breaking it down at various intervals to prevent our advance. On the whole of the South face of the bund, fronting our position, they had bodies of troops stationed, extending for about a mile and a quarter. As the causeway on the right of their position was so narrow that only a file of men could advance along it against their numerous musquetry and local impediments, I abandoned all idea of attacking them rthere. It was therefore determined to force our way along the moat, and to turn the left of their position, on the South face of the square. Captain Latter, my Interpreter, who was with me, had with him a Burmese, who promised to find us a causeway leading into the bmid, close to the left of their position. We commenced our advance, the Bengal Fusiliers leading, covered by tlie Rifle Company of the 5th Madras Native Infantry, and followed by the Madras Fusiliers and 5th Native Infantry, in file, and for two hours was this force struggling through the almost impenetrable grass and jungle along the outer edge of the moat, and exposed to a very warm fire from the enemy. We at last reached a part of the moat which admitted of a passage for the troops, and marked by the extreme left of the Enemy's position, and where they had a strong post and two guns. I here directed Colonel Tudor to form a storming party of 150 of his own men, and 100 of the Madras Fusiliers, which the Lieutenant Colonel led. At the signal given, they crossed the moat through mud and water, and most gallantly stormed the Enemy's post. We were now masters of their position. Our own guns wei'e actively employed under Captain Mallock at the spot from which we first commenced our move, and after some time they were brought up, over almost impassable ground, nearly to the spot where we effected our entrance into the Enemy's position, and they were protected by the Grena diers of the 5th Madras Native Infantry, under Captain Wyndham. After resting the troops for some time, and collecting the wounded men, we again advanced by an excellent path in the direction of the large Pagoda. We suffered no molestation from the Enemy, but on approaching the Pagoda, I formed a party for its attack, under Major Hill, of the Madras Fusiliers, consisting of 100 of his own Regiment, with a similar number of the Bengal Fusiliers. They advanced up to the steps of the Pauoda, and on ascending received a fire of musquetry, which they they soon silenced, and took possession of the place at about one o'clock p. m. The fatigues of the day were now over, and I am certain that while they lasted no soldiers ever met with more arduous ones, nor ever met the obstacles of such an advance with more cheerful and steady • perseverance than did this little band of brave and determined men. The Enemy, by the least computation, could not number less than 5,000 men, evidently headed by people of consideration, by the numerous mounted people, as well as elephants, which were seen retiring by the road to Sitang. Our loss is not nearly what I apprehended in the morning it might have been, and considering the diffi culties of the ground and exposure to the Enemy, I congratulate myself that it is so small. I have now to ask the Governor General in Council's consideration of the services performed on this expedition by the Officers and men engaged. To Brigadier McNeill, who forpied up the force in the morning as it disembarked, and whose inde fatigable exertions during the day brought on an exhaustion which occasioned me much distress to witness, and which deprived me of his valuable assistance for a short time. To Lieutenant Colonel Tudor, of the Bengal Fusiliers, w ho led the storming party and carried the Enemy's position. To Major Hill, of the Madras Fusiliers, who led the party which carried the Pagoda. To Major Shubrick, of the 5th Madras Native Infantry, whose position in tfce Bentinok, which was considerably in advance of the rest of the Flotilla, called forth his greatest vigilance to protect his people from the Enemy, who were around him, as also for his exertions during the day. To Captain Mallock, for his exertions with the Guns. To Captain Brown, who commanded the Rifle Company of the 5th Madras Native Infantry, who covered our advance, and whose conduct I witnessed with much pleasure during.the day. &amp;t i I feel most, particularly indebted to the attention and devotion paid to the sick and wounded by the Medical Officers who accompanied the force. The Brigadier has brought to my notice Captain Renaud, his Brigade Major, whose services he highly appreciates. To Captain Latter, whose distinguished gallantry on this as on all occasions has been conspicuous, as also his local information and active assistance, 1 beg to call your Lordships paiticulai attention. To Commander Shadwell, who had charge of the naval part of this Expedition, 1 an- deeply indebted for the most unremitting exertions by night and day, and for the disembaikation ot the a loops, which was conducted as quietly as expeditiously Neither the Steamers nor the boats could get up to the Enemy's defences, owing to the shallowness ot the Rivei. Captain Shadwell personally accompanied me throughout the day. Will your Lordship permit me to introduce to your notice Commander Beauchamp Seymour, of the Roval Navy, who is here on a visit to many tnends, who accompanied me duiuig the day, and whose conduct was conspicuous ou every occasion. To Major Mayhew, Deputy Adjutant General; Major Boulderson, Deputy Judge Advocate General ; Captain Hamilton', Deputy Assistant Adjutant General ; Captain Darroch, Deputy Assistant Quarter Master General; Captain Burne, Military Secretary, and Captain Chads, Aide-de-Camp; the Gene.al and my Personal Staff, whose duties were most arduous, being carried on on foot, and whose exertions to keep up the communication with the force in this broken ground were incessant, I beg to call your Lordship's attention. I leave a garrison of 400 men, 200 of the Madras Fusiliers and 200 of the 5th Madras Native Infan -r try, with two 24-Founder Howitzers, and a detail of Artillery with 40 Sappers, which the upper terrace of the' Pagoda will hold most commodiously, including the Magazine and Stores. This party will be under the command of Ma)or Hill, of the Madras Fusiliers, a most excellent otlicei. Lieutenant Campbell, of the Bengal Engineers, will see to its necessary defences. Eight guns were taken, and it is supposed that more will be found. I purpose leaving this for Rangoon to-morrow morning. Enclosing a list of Casualties, I have the honor to be, &amp;c. (Signed) H.
