The position then was that, while the Air Force (who are, of course, primarily responsible for carrying out H.M. Gr. ’s commitments in respect of the defence of Qatar) were very anxious that the Sheikh should buy rifles which would take British *303 ammunition, since such ammunition could be readily provided from British stocks in case of emergency, the Sheikh was showing a strong inclination to buy German Mauser rifles. The Resident wanted to order tne Sheikh to buy the British rifles but the Secretary of State decided that an attempt should be made to persuade him. It was, however, agreed with the Government of India (P.S.5573/36) that if the Sheikh could not be persuaded, further steps should be taken and a definite prohibition should be imposed. Such a prohibition can effectively be issued since under his treaty with H.M.G. the Sheikh of Qatar can only buy rifles from a source v/hich is approved by H.M.G. From the Resident’s letter of the 5th February now submitted, it is clear that the Sheikh is still recalcitrant. Colonel Fowle’s letter is a very clear and lucid summary of the situation, and his proposals in paragraph 7 seem to be obviously right. A draft telegram of concurrence is submitted/ subject to the v concurrence of the Foreign Office;, It is unnecessary to consult the Air Ministry since they have already agreed to similar proposals (P.Z. 5281/36).

Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No # 2390 dated the 19th August 19 36# 2. The Shaikh of Q,atar was addressed last August on the lines of paragraph 3 of your telegram No.2233, dated the 30th July 1936, without, however, at that stage any reference being made to Artidri v 3 of the Qatar Treaty of 1916. Some delay ensued owing to the fact that the Shaikh did not make it clear in his communications whether he was willing or not to purchase rifles and ammunition of *303 bore, and more recently owing to his preoccupation over oil matters. It is clear, however, from a recent coranunication, in which he reiterates his request for an unrestricted permit to import 500 rifles and 250,000 rounds of ammunition, that the type of rifle he prefers to import is the German Mauser 7.9 mm.* 3 3. It may be as well to summarise the main points of the question under consideration. In giving the Shaikh of Qatar our / (Signature) tv. • ’•* - \ S. 44. MFP—1013S&amp;P—(M-1323)—3U-10-33—10,(KX&gt;. (Designation &gt;our — 2 - proinise of protection by land (in connection with his granting an oil concession to Petroleum Concessions Limited) he was told that His Majesty’s Government expected him to take ail reasonable steps for his own defence# It is the noyal Air Porce who are primarily responsible for carrying out any defence measures necessary, and it is the responsibility of the Political Authorities to ensure that the maximum ground assistance in these measures is forthcoming from the Snaikh# Should the Shaikh’s tribesmen be armed with rifles which take standard .303 ammunition of Brit ish manufacture, supplies of anmunition and additional rifles could be provided by the Royal Air Force speedily and without difficulty in an emergency# Should the tribesmen, however, be armed with German Mauser rifles and ammunition, such supplies could not be provided without difficulty and much delay, and the Royal Air Force would find themselves deprived of the ground assistance of the Shaikh’s forces when such assistance was most needed. As mentioned in paragraph 2 of my Express letter No.459-3 of 1st June 1936 the Royal Air Force consider it essential that the rifles purchased by the Shaikh should taxe standard #303 ammunition of Brit ish manufacture and, for the reasons given above, I consider that the Shaikh should comply with this condition. 4. On the other hand, in one of his letters regarding his preference for German rifles, the Shaikh implied that His Majesty’s Government having accepted the responsibility for his protection, such responsibility was wholly theirs. I think it very probable that this idea has, at any rate partially, influenced him in adhering so tenaciously to arms of German make# If, and when, an emergency came, and he was called 0 n for /-3- for assistance, he could then reply that he had little or no amnunition left, and since no ammunition could be provided to fit hia rifles he would be in the comfortable position of being relieved of his responsibilities. This is not of course a position that we can in any way accept# 5. Moreover, in view of recent German attempts at commercial penetration into tt 16 Arab Coast (vide India Office telegram No# 57, dated the 8th January 1937, and connected correspondence) it is highly undesirable that the Shaikh should be permitted to purchase German rifles and ammunition, since it will lead to future supplies (of which under Article 3 of the 3,atar Treaty of 1916 he can purchase 500 rifles annually) being obtained from the same source, and other Shaikhs may try to follow his example# (In this connection please see last sentence of para graph 8 of ray letter No*l-B dated the 6th February 1936 to His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, copy to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India and the Government of India under Printed letter No#90-S of same date). Apart from the commercial point of view, on political grounds I inagine we should give no encouragement to German armament firms to turn their attention to the Persian Gulf even though the quantities involved would be comparatively small. 6 # Finally, there is the possibility, mentioned in Govern ment of India telegram No * 1739 ^ dated the 1st August 1936, that the Shaikh might desire to retail German rifles since, according to him, there is no Arab market for British rifles. 7# In view of the foregoing considerations I propose that I should now address a comprehensive letter to the Shaikh (a) explainii%* to the Shaikh once more in the terms of paragraph /paragraph 3 of your telegram Ho *2233, dated the :0th July 1936, the desirability of his purchasing rifles which will take standard .303 ammunition of British manufacture, (b) drawing his attention t 0 Article 3 of the 3,atar Treaty of 1916, and (c) informing him that His Majesty’s Government cannot therefore accede to his request for permit to purchase Mauser rifles and ammunition, but that they are prepared to grant him a permit for the purchase of any type of rifle^ * which will take standard .303 ammunition of British manufacture. sd. T.C.Fowle, Lieut.-fColonel. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Att ested. Resident in the Persian Gulf.Minute Paper Political Department. Mr.Wanton, Please see the notes on p.Z.5281/36. As you point out in your note of the 28th July the Air Ministry concurred in the course originally suggested hy the Political Resident (i.e.to give an order to the Sheikh that he is to huy British rifles), but we decided, subject to the concurrence of the Government of India, that at any rate in the first instance it would be better to make a further effort to induce the Sheikh to do what we want rather than to issue a peremptory order. Our telegram dated the 30th July on P.Z.5281/36 was on these lines. The Government of India in their telegram of 1st August concur but suggest^ stronger measures if the Sheikh continues to be recalcitrant.

It appears from the papers now submitted that the Sheikh has seen and does not like the S.M.L.E. rifle, but prefers the German 1934 Mauser 7*9 m.m. He has not apparently seen the 1914 pattern rifle, of which samples are being sent to him. The Air Officer Commanding is inclined to insist that the rifles to be bought should be such as will take standard .303 ammunition of British manufacture, and the Resident proposes to inform the Sheikh that permission wil] only be given for the import of a make which will take this ammunition. Colonel Powle proposes to base his communication to the Sheikh on the correspondence in connection with the guarantee of protection given to him last year, and in particular on ^the Resident’s letter of 11th May 1935 at P.Z. 4129/35. (f,®) It is perhaps stretching that letter a little iar to say that because the Sheikh must take 'all reasonable steps for your own defence ' 1 he must therefore purchase British and not foreign rifles. On the other ham Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty (flagged) only undertakes that facilities will be given to the Sheikh to purchase and import arms 'from the Muscat Arms Warehouse or such other place as the British Government may approve,' and it would appear that H.M.G. are perfectly entitled to lay down the source from which the Sheikh is to obtain his arms. It/It is clearly important that the Sheikh’s men should he armed with rifles for which, in an emergency, ammunition can he provided at short notice. This is, however, really a matter for the Air Ministry more than fpr this Office and a letter to them is submitted asking whether they agree that the Resident’s recommendation should he approved. 4 f ^ /U, flULj l~K^ tut 4 Ax u~Im- h, AvA. / U. ftS tu* Cv ^ *v&lt;.

Sir, I have the honour to refer to your express letter No«896-S of 1930 dated &amp; 7 th November in which it is stated that the Shaikh of Qatar is anxious to afrail him self of the ad'fcantages accorded to him under that clause of the Treaty with Government by which he is permitted to import 500 rifles annually* I agree that no opposition should fee made to the purchase of this years quota provided that the rifles bought take standard .503 ammunition of British manufacture. There appears to be no valid reason for pressing the Shaikh to buy standard short Lee Enfield rifles as used by the British armed forces: he may be able to arm himslef from other sources at a cheaper price. But, as an inducement to buy British, it might be pointed out to him that if he purchases our standard weapon, facilities for repair and inspection could be periodically provided. I suggest that if the Shaikh wishes to pur chase his full annual quota in future years, the matter should be referred to me before agreement is given. I have the honour to be.

Sir, 1 r I am commanded by the Army Council to refer to your letter of the 9th ultimo No .P. Z♦ 1^23/ 36_» regarding a proposed sale of rifles to the Sheikh Qatar, and also to the copy of telegram from the Political Pvesident in the Persian Gulf, transmitted on the same date under reference P.Z./l73o/l936• Sw ^ It is observed that in the letter, which was apparently despatc hed before the copy telegram, it is suggested that the sale should be arranged by His Majesty^ Govex-nment and that pattern 1914- rifles should be offered, but that in the second document the point is made that it is essential that the rifles supplied should be capable of repair by the R.A.F. I am to say that although large stocks of 1914 pattern rifles are in the possession of this Department, the sole selling rights to foreign countries are at present vested in B.S.A. (Guns) Ltd., of Birmingham, and their representatives, the Soley Armament Co. of 8 Park Village East, London, N.W.1. Arrangements have accordingly been made with the latter Company to forwai^d an offer of these Rifles for communication to the Sheikh of Qatar, and in view of the fact that these rifles are not now in use in the Army and that their repair would present some difficulty because stocks of the requisite spare parts are not maintained in Iraq the So3.ey Armament Co. were requested to offer also second-hand S.M.L.E. rifles, of which the Company holds a stock. This offer has, it is understood, been addressed to Lieutenant Colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, Bahrain, and the prices quoted are, for Patterry The Under Secretary of State for IndiaPattern 1914- rifles S.M.L.E. rifles each. £ 2 . 17.6 ) plus cost ) of packing 3 . 0.0 ) and freight. The Soley Armament Co. Ltd., also state that a consignment of the latter rifles (which it is anticipated may be preferred) is already on its way to Bahrain, addressed to Mr. C.

Department. :i9:J9 The Sheikh of Qatar, under his Treaty, is allowed to import 500 rifles annually. He does not appear to have bought any since 1927&gt; when the Government of India sold him 500 *303 carbines and 75&gt;000 rounds of ammunition. He is at present anxious to buy 500 rifles, and is considering a number of samples from British and foreign firms. The Resident suggested that in order to make sure of the Sheikh buying British rifles, he might be offered cheap ’'reconditioned” rifles from India. It appears from the Government of India*s telegram of 2nd LI arch that none such are available, and that only the expensive service rifle can be produced. The Government of India however suggest offering him 1914 pattern rifles from home stocks. These are the rifles which we are selling to the Afghans at the present time, and the Government of India think they would suit the Sheikh well. They would probably cost about £3 (or a little more with accessories, whereas the service rifle would cost about £ 7 .10s. The rifles being sold to the Afghans are being individually inspected and tested, and probably it would be a good thing to do the same for these. A draft letter putting the suggestion to the War Office is submitted. 5000 :35 71 t li u*, So A- V* A' \t~tCvymj 14 ^ JL A H/ivr '•'a-.? t * fy 1Draft Paper p.z. 1521/36.

In principle, too, they are averse from allowing machine guns and even armed cars to pass into the hands of Arab rulers unless this is quite essential and could not agree to provision of tanks or of ’’armoured cars” strictly so called.

Text of Treaty, dated November 3, 1916, and ratified on March 23, 1918, between His Majesty’s Government and Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani of al-Katar. Wlier eas my grandfather, the late Sheikh Mohammed-bin-Thani, signed an agreement on the 12th September, 1868, engaging not to commit any breach of the maritime peace, and whereas these obligations to the British Government have devolved on me his successor in Qatar; I. I, Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, undertake that I will, as do the friendly Arab Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Shargah, Aj man, Ras-ul-Khaima, and Umm-al- Qawain, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave trade and piracy, ami generally in the maintenance of the maritime peace. To this end, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Sheikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I will abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid treaties and engagements. II. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that I and my subjects and my and their vassals shall receive all the immunities, privileges, and advantages that are conferred on the friendly Sheikhs, their subjects and their vassals. In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements in the copy granted to me, and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements, in two other printed copies of the same treaties and engagements, that it may not be hidden. III. And in particular, I, Sheikh Abdullah, have further published a proclamation, forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and in consideration of the undertaking into which I now enter, the British Government on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from the Maskat Arms Warehouse, or such other place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as I may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the Political Agent, Bahrein. I undertake absolutely that arms and. ammunition thus supplied to me shall under no circumstances be re-exported from my territories or sold to the public, but shall be reserved solely for supplying the needs of my tribesmen and dependents, whom I have to arm for the maintenance of order in my territories and the protection of my frontiers. In my opinion, the amount of my early requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with, nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of the High British Government; neither will I, without such consent, cede, to any other Power or its subjects, land, either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way whatsoever. V. I also declare that, without the consent of the High British Government, I will not grant pearl-fishery concessions, or any other monopolies, concessions, or cable landing rights to anyone whomsoever. VI. The customs dues on the goods of British merchants imported to Qatar shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods, and shall in no case exceed 5 per cent, ad valorem. British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxes of any other kind whatsoever, beyond that already specified. 2383 75 12.33VII. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further, in particular, undertake to allow British subjects to- reside in Qatar for trade and to protect their lives and property. VIII. I also undertake to receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an agent from the British Government, who shall remain at Al-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me, and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions. IX. Further, 1 undertake to allow the establishment of a British post office and a telegraph installation anywhere in my territory whenever the British Government should hereafter desire them. 1 also undertake to protect them when established. X. On their part, the High British Government, in consideration of these treaties and engagements that I have entered into with them, undertake to protect me and my subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, may suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions. XI. They also undertake to grant me good offices, should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly understood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part of myself or my subjects against others. In token whereof I, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and I, Shaikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, have respectively signed and affixed our seal to this original document and four copies thereof.

(After compliments.) Whereas your Honour has to-day entered into and signed with me, on behalf of the- British Government, an agreement or treaty, with the object of cementing the relations between the High British Government and yourself, and whereas your Honour has expressed the opinion that the time has not yet come for giving effect to articles (7), (8), and (9), which relate to :— (1) The admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade. (2) The admission of an agent on behalf of Government. (8) The establishment of post and telegraph offices in your territory. Therefore I, on behalf of the British Government, accept your opinion, and hereby inform you that the British Government see no present necessity for the -execution of these measures, and will refrain from pressing for them until some future time when the need for them shall be manifest, and the effect will not be given to these articles without full consultation with you and the obtaining of your consent. And whereas you have represented to me that you and your dependents possess a good many slaves from of old time, previous to this treaty, and that it would be difficult if the officials of Government were to interfere between them and their masters, accordingly I inform you that I recognise how you are placed in regard to this question, and that supposing that you accord your negroes fair and just treatment there will not be interference on the part of Government representatives in the matter. This is what had to be explained, and may God preserve you. P. Z. COX, Lieutenant-Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated, Al Bida, November 3, 1916 {Moharram 6, 1335). APPENDIX B. Proclamation by Sheikh Abdullah regarding the Arms Traffic. Be it known to all who may see this: Whereas it has become known to us that traffic in arms into British India, Persia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and the Trucial Coast is prohibited ; I, the undersigned, Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, Shaikh of Qatar, have decided to do all in my power to assist the British Government in putting a stop to this illegal traffic, and I hereby declare that from the date of this proclamation, the importation and sale of arms, cartridges, and all munitions into our territory, and the exportation of the same to other places, are absolutely prohibited. All arms and ammunition imported into Qatar territory, or exported therefrom, will in future be liable to seizure and confiscation. That it may not be hidden.
