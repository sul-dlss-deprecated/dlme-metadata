Dr William Henry Colvill's actions are also referred to as Pelly has felt obliged to report him as being 'perfidious and ill suited to civil employ'.Other matters reported on in the letter include a Mr Galton who might be suitable for employ at the Residency and would be able to undertake 'collecting' for the public museum; the news that Mr Markham wishes to harvest oysters from the Pearl beds in Persian Gulf for India; the news of Lord Edward's death; Pelly's attempts to find a suitable horse for Frere and Alfred Hyman Louis' arrival in Bombay.A postscript to the letter reports that a number of Pelly's employees at Bushire are down with fever and that both it and Cholera have been decimating the Gulf which has led him to send Dr Colvill to investigate the extent of the Cholera outbreaks and to acquire 'natural specimens'.A second postscript, dated 21 January suggests that it may be worth Pelly visiting Bombay once matters in the Gulf have settled to discuss affairs in more detail.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024195009.0x000007#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
