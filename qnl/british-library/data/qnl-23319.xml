Sir, TAXES - QATAP We have the honour to bring to notice that we have been notified by the Ruler of Qatar that he proposes to introduce with effect from October 1940 a system of taxation of the majority of our employees in Qatar. We anticipate that he will press for taxation of all Arabs - Iraqis, Kuweitis, Muscatis, Saudis - but be prepared to exempt British and British Indians, if opposed. This innovation has been put into his mind by visitors from Kuwait and Iraq. His form of taxation, we gather, is to consist of annual charges {Rs.5) for registration and issue of a nationality booklet, and a monthly tax of approximately 3^ on pay, but we cannot as yet be sure of these figures. In general, we consider it reasonable to dissociate ourselves as much as possible from the scheme and to suggest taxation of non-Qataris could be referred to H.M.G. with advantage. We may expect to be asked to make pay deductions on behalf of the Ruler and this we feel we should resist. We would add that it appears that the taxes are to be imposed on Company exployees only and this seems inequitable. An undesirable feature is that the booklet system puts the control of recruitment and the retentionPDQ/SAA. .2/2171 (oontd.) of employnaent very much in the hands of the Ruler. We need hardly say that we believe the Qatar employees (95$ unskilled labourers) will derive no benefits from-the proceeds of these taxes which will go straight into the Shaikh 1 s coffers. We should be grateful for your views as Mr.Packer is visiting Qatar in a few days and the matter is bound to be raised by the Ruler. We have the honour to be Sir, Your most obedient servants, For 8c on behalf of PETROLEUM DEVELOPMENT (QA.TAR) LIMITED MANAGERConfidential © No •C/866-22/10« Political Agency, Bahrain, the 9th November 1940 To The Hon*ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Bahrain* Memorandum I enclose a copy of a letter No.PDQ/SAA2/2171 dated the 3x*d November 1940 from the Manager, Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited. 2. It appears that the Shaikh contemplates imposing new taxes, i.e. an annual registration charge and a form of income tax which would discriminate against Company employees. As pointed out by the Manager the booklet system will give the Shaikh complete control over outside employees of the Company. 3. The last paragraph of Article 10 of the Qatar Gil Concession seems to have some bearing but it is the Company which is to be exempted from 'all present and future taxes of any kind whatsoever”• The ^Company” does not include employees as can b$ seen from the wording of Article 10. Ihere is nothing in the Qatar Oil Concession document to pre vent the Shaikh from discriminating against employees of the Oil Company. 4. As regards employees of the Company, article 17 of the Concession already gives the Shaikh sufficient control over their retention, which can be dispensed with if the Shaikh has observed any irregular conduct on the part of the employee/-&lt;■» 2 «* employee. The booklet system will of course enable him either to prevent the employment of outsiders or to make them leave the country without the necessity of giving any rea - * son to the Company. 5. These arbitrary impositions on the employees of the Company should, I think, be resisted. And although there is no provision in the Concession to prevent the Shaikh from taking such steps there is on the other hand nothin; to show that the Company agreed that the Shaikh could impose new forms of taxation on the Company’s employees whenever he wished. The general tenor is that the Company and its employees will pay the existing dues and no more. 6. I think that the Company should, as suggested by Mr. Packer, resist the whole scheme as being outside the terms of the Concession and request the Shaikh to r efer the matter to the Political Agent, Bahrain, if he wishes to do so.

Political Agent Bahrain has received similar / b report from Local Manager of P.C.L. He has informed him that if Shaikh raises question again he should be told that whole scheme is outside terms of Concession and that if he wishes to pursue it he should take it up with the Political Agent. Shaikh has taken no further action since. 3. • I am reporting by post.Confidential No. C/252 « 22/10 Political Agency, Bahrain, the 17th March 1941 To The Honourable the Political Hesident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Memorandum On my recent visit to Qatar I took the opportunity of speaking to Shaikh Abdullah on the subject of taxation of the Qatari employees of P.C.L. 2. The Shaikh seemed surprised at the idea of any tax being taken from these employees and said that no taxes were being taken from them as far as he knew. After he left the room however the Indian doctor of P.C.L*, who attends the Shaikh and who was with me at the time, told me that the Shaikh did not know about these taxes which were being taken by his son Hamad, v/ithout his knowledge. 3. In the absence of the Shaikh I asked Shaikh Hamad as to whether he was taxing these men and, after some hesitation, he rather defiantly said that they were being taxed but that all other countries did the same and in fact charged more. 4. I pointed out that in Bahrain there are no imposi tions on employees of the Company there. He said that he knew nothing about Bahrain but that in * Iraq employees had to pay various fees. I said that these Qataris are poor men and that it was a pity that they should be heavily taxed in this way. The Company was only just /•just starting and that such mathods were likely to hinder its work and thus cause loss both to the Shaikh and the Company. 5. Shaikh Hamad appears however to be a grasping, ignorant sort of man and it is unlikely that any argu ments will affect him# He is also said to be under the influence of Abdullah bin Darwish, a bird of the same feather, only more astute# One excuse was that all residents of Qatar are subject to taxation and that these Qataris employed by P#C#L. are in the same category, but this is not correct as while the average Qatari only pays ordinary Zakat, Customs, etc#, Company employees (Qataris) have to pay from R$' 3/- to Rs 5/- p*m# per head according to their pay. 6# Nothing was said about taxation of foreign employees of the Company, vide correspondence ending with your telegram No. 19 dated the 4th January 1941, to H#M# Secretary of State for India.
