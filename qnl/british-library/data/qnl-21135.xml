Juridical issue as regards Kuwait, Bahrain and Truol&amp;l Geaet Bhaikha is subject to some ambiguity though we doubt, in view of control of external relations of these States by Hie Majesty** Government, whether position as stated by Fowle in paragraph 4 of his telegram under refer ence needs to be accepted. As, however. His Majesty*a Government will presumably consider it desirable that in all matt ere relating to external relating, including application of sanctions, Arab states should fall into line with policy of His Majesty’s Government as Member of League, and ae moreover adherence to sanctions coincides with undoubted local sentiment (see Dickson’s intelligence Ho. 16 of 1933) we consider that hulere should be advised to apply sanctions simultaneously with Members of countries of League of Hr tiens. It should not be difficult for Resident to aecure the ^ulers’ adherence to general League policy as proceeding fro© their own initiative. 2. v/e are confirmed in this opinion by consideration that local dislocation of trade should be negligible and that strength of Arab opinion against Italy might, if trade with Italy were permitted to continue in the face of s&amp;nctlone, lead to possible disturbance at time of visits of /© 15 - 2 - of Itfclinc Yeavela to Sulf port*. s.

Binec the Contracting * rties are Members of the League it is clear that the treaty must be interpreted subject to Articles 16 and £0 of the Covenant.

The legal Sub* committee hr a been asked to advise whether a country participating in the sanetions which at present under the most-favoured*nation clause benefits by concessions made to Italy under eommereial treaties with ether states which «re participating in the sanctions can continue to do so when the sanctions hove resulted in suspension ot the CoBeessioas made to Italy.

The most-favoured* nation clause cannot give a right to continue ez\j eyment ef the /11 © Ui %h» in question » nee application of mo»t»favo ©d- iatlon tfcataent depends upon the existence of a particular state of things. It is nevertheless in conformity with the spirit of Article 16 paragraph 3 of the Covenant that the advantages should continue to be accorded independently of the most-favoured-nt ti un clause for one could hardly conceive that the States participating in the aancti ns which arc under an obligation to support one another mutually should proceed to render their eeoxaonio relations with one another more difficult than before, rhe iufc-committee considers th t this view might advantageously be expressed in the proposal dealing with eeonmsie sanctions by the insertion therein of a provision to the following effect &lt;« •Strtee participating in the sanctions which in virtue of moet-f*Toured -iu tion treatment have up to the present been obtaining from other $artlclp&amp;tlng States advantages or benefits accorded by the latter to Italy of which lU Xy will be in temporarily deprived through the application of sanctions will continue te enjoy such advantages and concessions on the new ground of the mutual support which the Members of the league of Motions arc bound to afford one another under Article 16 paragraph 3 ef the Seven* nt.* 2. The legal Sub- commit tec has been ashed to advise whether it is legally maintainable that countries entitled to the benefit of the moct-favoured-nation clause would neverthe less net be justified in claiming for theme elves the advantages of preferential treatment accorded temporarily and for the duration of the sanetlene only by one of the participating States to the goods of another participating State whose exports /12 «&amp;f&gt;erts h?d Wen spec ^ily restricted ae the result of the sanetloas* The SuWoo^ittee is of the following opinion* The Moet-favoured-n tion elause would not Justify the extension of the adwant^ges in question to third States* The reasons are firstly thnt such ^dr ant ages would h re an exeeptional as well as a temporary choree ter and would be the consequence of a special obligation existing between the States concerned in virtue of Article Id paragraph 3 of the Governnt of the league of nations f nd secondly thr t the »ost-frvoured-nr^tion clause is a provision peculiar to eof&amp;aerei&amp;l treaties which are the treaties in which it is found and accordingly is one which must be interpreted as not centeatplftting economic relations of so sxcsption .1 a nature ^e those which are here under consideration* *&gt;• ms hr -w ^ The Go-ord . nr t ion Committee requests ths Committee of 16 to continue in session in order to follow the execution of the proposals already subpitted to Clovern««nt* and to put such new proposals as it may think advise ids to make before the Co-ordination Committee or the Oovernmcnts represented thereon* To this end the Committee of 18 shell appoint such Sub-commit tee, technical or other me it may deem fit, among its own Members or from those of the Co-ordination Committee* Knds* telegraph urgently what measures you contemplate for giving effect to these proposals and by west d&amp;te they ean be brought into effect* Ifeds* PCJRS 16 H*a Telegram 1 - R/°7* *rom : - Political Agent, Bahrein.

Both v-oiorel Looh and Mr. Belgtave were of opinion that much more publicity would be ai,t meted to the notice by its annulment tiian by letting it stand and by endeavouring to ar’ange that its practical effect will be negligible. I concurred. Mr. Belgrave info mad me that local merchants for some time past had been expecting that some notice res sanctions would be issued and had therefore out down their orders from Italy, and that at the present time these orcters were small in quantity and that no more are being put in hand. 3ttoh Italian goods as do arrive will be treated as having been ordered before the notice was issued. In the unliiiely event oi an Italian ship arriving and unloading further Italian goods a similar procedure would be adopted. fbe practical effect, therefore, of the notice will actually be nil, and if the notice is not reproduced in the Arab Press is will probably escape publicity outside Bahrain, f-hould,however,the Italian Government come to hear of the notice smd make protests - official or unofficial - , or make it a basis for any propaganda, it could be explained that the Shaikh of Bahrain, who personally feels strongly on the subject, issued this notice on his own volition, ~nu it «u, U (, ^ that had His “ajesty’s Government inspired tha Bahrain notice thep would undoubtedly have also induced the roaaining 'ulers of the Arab Coast to do likewise.

Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare to invite reference to your letters P.Z.7656 and 7701/1935 of October Italy by the rulers of Arab States on the Persian Gulf, and to inform you that he considers it inadvisable on political grounds that any action should be taken at the present time to secure the co-operation of the States in question. 2. In erriving at this decision Sir Sameel Hoare has been influenced by the consideration that in the present inflamed state of public opinion in Italy it is preferable to avoid any step likely to be misinterpreted as a further and gratuit ous attempt on the part of His Majesty*s Government to inspire hostility to Italy on the part of foreign countries. This is more particularly the case when the countries in question are not in © position to contribute in any appreciable measure to the successful operation of the sanctions already in force or in contemplation. In this connection, I am to refer to the remarks of Signor Mussolini as quoted in Rome telegram No.670 of October 30th concerning the pressure alleged to have been exerted by His Majesty’s Government upon such countries as Venezuela. These remarks illustrate Italian sensitiveness in regard to the influencing of League members, and afford an indication of the resentment likely to be caused by any attempt to persuade States not members of that body to apply sanctions* ^^ ain request that the Government of India may be advised accordingly. 24th and 26th regarding the application of sanctions against I am, Sir, The Hnder-Secretary of State, India Office.

The available tanker tonnage is limited and has been fully occupied in the normal trade. A generous estimate might place the reserves at five months’ supply at the present rate of consumption. This would tide the Italian Army well over the rainy season in Abyssinia, but the probability of an early interruption of the supply would have an immediate effect. The question still remains to be discussed in its politi cal aspect outside the Committee, especially as regards transport. It is evident that the problem bristles with uncertainties. SHIPMENTS OF OIL TO WARRING NATIONS. Under the above title the Standard Oil Company of California states in its Bulletin: As a result of newspaper despatches concerning furnishing American oil to nations at war, the company has received several inquiries from stockholders and patrons as to its attitude. The letters revealed belief that this company is engaged in such trade. As a matter of fact, the Standard Oil Company of Cali fornia has no trade, nor has it had any, with Italy, nor with Ethiopia. One despatch from Rome stated that a certain American oil company had been granted a monopoly in Italy in return for a supply of oil. The report was erroneous. It has been officially, authoritatively and con clusively denied by those principally concerned—the oil company and the Italian Government. BAHREIN REFINERY. The fact that a group of engineers of this company were proceeding to Bahrein Island, in the Persian Gulf, where the company is about to construct an oil refinery, formed the basis of another story that the Standard Oil Company of California might be drawn into the situation. Again as a matter of fact, the decision to build the refinery is not even remotely connected with the Italian-Ethiopian situation. This company has been developing an oil field at Bahrein for several years. The construction of a re- ; finery is a logical, ordinary step in the development. The possibility has been before the company for a year or more. Further, the refinery will not be providing pro ducts for many months to come, possibly not until the Ethiopian situation is history. ANOTHER CANARD. Still another despatch gave sensational significance to the plan of an American company to build a refinery in Italy. This step, it was immediately revealed, but with far less publicity, was another industrial development not associated with the Italo-Ethiopian war. A tariff, not a war, caused the decision to build this refinery. The Italians imposed a high tariff on imports of petroleum products for the very purpose of compelling their manu facture within Italian boundaries. Without doubt the existence of refineries within Italy has national defence importance, but plans for this particular refinery were made many months ago, prior to the crisis and as a normal development resulting from a changed economic condition. Other reports, from Washington mainly, have created an impression that the American oil industry has defied its Governmei warring natior ising the Pres ammunition, &lt; issued a list o be exported, 1 other commod. eluded in the sional Act did fore, the Government has not prohibited oil shipments, nor has it made any request that American oil companies refrain from making shipments. Nor has the Govern ment of any other oil-producing country prohibited or advised against oil shipments to belligerents. ITALY’S SOURCES OF SUPPLY. The figures on the extent of Italy’s dependence on America for petroleum are interesting. As issued by the United States Department of Commerce they show that 93£ per cent, of Italy’s requirements come from elsewhere —only 6.5 per cent, from the United States. Of interest also is the fact that of America’s total exports of oil and oil products only 2.1 per cent, go to Italy. The following table shows Italy’s sources of supply: — Source. Percentage of total. Roumania 45.4 Iran (Persia) 14.8 Russia 14.4 Dutch West Indies . 11.5 United States 6.5 Colombia 3.2 Iraq 2.5 Others 1.7 importations from the United States have shown some increases this year over last, but not to an important degree. There are too many other sources of supply nearer at hand. From all of the foregoing facts it becomes clear that suggestions or charges that American oil companies are profiting by war, or are contributing to prolongation of war, or are putting business above patriotism and peace, are wholly unjustified. As to patriotic efforts, the World War showed the American oil industry to be second to none in patriotic endeavour and dutiful efficiency. It was Lord Curzon who said, “ The Allies rode to victory on a flood of oil.” Most of it was American oil. FRENCH RETAIL PETROL PRICES. (From Our Paris Correspondent.)
