The correspondence specifically concerns a request from the Commander-in-Chief of the East Indies Station, and the Senior Officer (Intelligence) at Colombo, for a copy of the Bahrain political diary. The request is protested against and vetoed by the Political Resident, who states that his own monthly summaries, which collate information from his Political Agents’ diaries, should suffice. A later letter in the file, from the Secretary to the Political Resident to his Political Agents, dated 3 January 1929, refers to submissions of a fortnightly diary by the Residency Agent at Sharjah (f 9).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Diaries</topic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial administration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0000f6#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
