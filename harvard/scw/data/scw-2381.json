Al-sala [ma]” (“Generosity is a disposition of the dwellers of paradise. Good health”). The calligraphy exhibits unusual features: the word al-salama is truncated, the two last letters, mim and ta’ marbuta, have disappeared, almost as if the calligrapher had run out of space. By contrast, three letters - the letter jim of al-janna [and] al-jud, and the kha of akhlaq - are extended disproportionately towards the right, and finely engraved in places as if to highlight their unconventional form. This might lead us to suspect that the absence of the two final letters in the word salama is in fact an aesthetic choice - an error of this kind seems unlikely. The circular inscription here is balanced by a dot that serves as a pivot for the composition. A verb in the imperative form, written in red, appears four times on the surface of the dish; two readings are possible: “tujza” (“be rewarded”), or “taharra” (“seek”). Two oval dots, with lightly hollowed centres, flank the word al-salama. They highlight the beginning and end of the inscription, guiding the reader.\" (From the Aga Khan Museum)", "Inscription: Generosity is a disposition of the dwellers of paradise.
