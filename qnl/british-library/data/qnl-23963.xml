D.O. Ko. 2 ,J, 2 ,( 5 -18/1. The ^of July, 1947. Dear Colonel Galloway, Would you kindly refer ud the correspondence ending with your Memorandum No.1419-62/1, dated the 19th June, 1947, regarding the renewal of the compound wall in the Agency garden? 2 . Che work is a minor repair, and I submit that it should not, in principle, be met from my C.C.G. which is intended for annual repairs and maintenance. It was Indeed in order to avoid a charge on my C.C.G. that I had the estimate made, and a special effort was made to keep the cost within the Ilon’ble the political Resident’s sanction. Furthermore, my C.C.G. allotment is only Rs.1,600/- (though, admittedly, since the war certairly, and perhaps before annual repairs to this Agency have never been completed within the allotment, i.e., an extra amount is always given). Of this Rs. 1,600/- T have only a balance today of Rs. 1,048-12-0; that is, I have not enough to meet the bill ior renewing the wall. 3. If you ar? unable to see your way to sanctioning the estimate perhaps fou would allow me to debit the cost to the Residency C.C.l. though I admit that theoretically at least, this is not \ satisfactory solution. - 1mrntmmmmam T^M's Political Agent| ^Krain. Respected Sir I beg to bring to your notice the following for your kind consideration and necessary action. The house I am staying in is part of the Agency building and requires the following minor repairss- 1. The house has not been white-washed for the last eight years and is filthy now. It may be cleaned and white-washed. 2. The floorings of W.C., terrace etc. are broken and may be cemented and patched. 3. The wiregauze of windows and doors require replacement. There are no bars for the windows and unless the torn wiregauze is replaced there is the danger of children falling on the streets through the windows. 4. The spring hinges of two wiregauze doors require replacement. 5. The wooden frames of windows and doors and trailies may be varnished or painted. I request that, as the house has not been repaired, during the annual repairs, fof the last eight or nine years, orders may kindly be passed now for the above minor repairs, before the cold season sets in.

Dear Lire, * i should be obliged if you would make enquiries in the follcr/ing matter and,if the results are satisfactory,send me quotations. 2. The Agency House at Bahrain suffers,as .do all other buildings,from a kind of damp salty exudation frfom the walls during the hot weather. The temperature runs up to only about 106°,but the humidity is very high and the salty air has a way of rotting things peculiar to Bahrain. Various kinds of distempers and paints have been tried but the results are not satisfactory as the walls soon get a patchy appearence. 3. I am thinking of trying an experiment of panelling the walls with three-ply wood,coated with solignum (or some similar preservative) on the wall side and either polished with linseed oil or painted on the side facing the room. ^ 4. /ill you kindly inform me:- (a) whether there is any particular ply-wood which you would recommend for panelling under the conditions described above, (b) whether the makers consider that treatment v/ith solignurn and oil or paint would be suitable. (c) whether the three-ply wood is liable to warp in damp hot weather and if so,what size panel the makers think could be used without fear of warping. (d) what the sizes and prices of the oly-wood would be,and Ce) what number of sheets and approximate weight is contained in a bundle of the various size sheets as made up for shipment abroad./(/ ^ 4 2 . covering the joints between the sheets and for taking the nails# 1 had thought of some thing quite plain as in the margin# Possibly,however,there is some better plan for fixing panelling of this sort: if so &gt; kindly let me know# 6 # Is it possible to obtain brass or copper,or other, nails which are suitable for fixing the panelling on to plastered walls and yet will not rust or discolour from the salty damp.

DO^/ '-/o Bu 8 hii* 0 , IStiJ May 33 , Dear Col. Loch, With to the question of panelling the Agency house at Bahrein 1 have now heard from Sir. Battey in Buereh to whom t wrote, and he ia of the opinion that the most economical method would be to have the walls lined with fibrelic aheeta, leaving an air space of about 3/4* to l^* between the wall and the sheets, which he considers will solve the question of the dampness. This material is available in Busreh in shaeta measuring 8 1 x 4* at a cost of i*D.1*500 per 100 square feet. If « large quantity is required it might of course be cheaper to order the sheets direct from the manufacturer and so save Iraq Customs duty. Mr. Battey suggests that Leighs Marine brand paint be used which is also available in Busreh at 15s/- per gallon. Yours Sincerely, Lieut.Col.Sordon Loch, Bushire. Akauhu .Dear Meikle, .

They flourished{ succe- ■ * 7 , at a time when the Persian Wddl formed part of the principal ■So/' communication and trade fen Past and West—before the caif round the Cape was found. l^rnold then went to Bahrain, entre of the pearling industry. ’ i aiue of the pearls exported from Gulf at the present time waspro- h 'y £3,000,000 a year. The richer j hunts were mostly Arabs. It was centre of American missionary Unrise in die Persian Gul/—other beinifXuwait, Basrah, and Upon the work of missions 'ie Persian Gulf Arabia, and jpotamia. Sir Arnold said *—“I itld not like to speak about the 'sian Gulf without bearing testim- /o the wonder/ul work they are oufg. I do not suppose they have lade converts in appreciable num ers, but they have, by their labours, ssisted by the high standard of rectitude displayed by British officials ind British merchants, profoundly modified the Arab outlook in ethical matters. The Arab is a Muhammadan first, and an Arab after, like all Isla mic races: he regards Europeans like- ( as Christians first and foremost. Be knoirs, perhaps better than we do, that our standard of conduct has its basis in the religion of our country; he respects our standard of conduct, and without adopting our religious views he tends, unconsciously, to reco gnise our standard of conduct as higher than his. He does not despise, but greatly recpects, those who devote their lives to spreading, by example and by teaching, the Christian reli gion. There is no greater influence tor good in the ] ) ersian Gulf than the Christian mission: no Europeans are so universally respected as are the missionaries, such as Zwemers 1 an Ess, Harrison, and Xlylrea, and those who decry foreign missions do less than justice to themselves, and harm to our good name.” A hundred knots north o f Bahrain was Bushire, the headquarters of British political influence in the Gulf, and the terminus of the most frequen ted and shortest road from the coast of the (tiuf to Shiraz and the interior of Persia. Again going towards the head of the Gulf, the lecturer described Kharag and the smaller island of Khargu. Kharag in 17o3 became the headquarters of Dutch commercial activities in the Gul f. During the Wav it was much drawn upon by the Expe ditionary force in Mesopotamia for road metal, and recently the quarries were reopened by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Twelve hours 9 steaming from Bushire brought one to Kuwait Bay. The juris diction of the Shaikh of Kuwait exten ded nominally for some 200 miles down the western side of the Gulf, when it met the Hasa territory of Ibn* Sauod. The rule of the Shaikh of y Kuwait was absolute. V 1 he lecturer ended his description with an examination of the Shaft al Arab, of Bawarda, of Abadan, and of Muhammarah. Sir Arnold concluded with a word on the people of the Persian Gulf; they were, he said, not unworthy of admiration. Islam in the waters of the Gulf was rooted in the older faiths: many of its shrines on the Persian side were places of pilgrimage before the teaching of Muhammad had rep laced that of Zoroaster: the names of the epic he roes of pre-Islam days—of Rustam, Zuhrab and Zal, of Solomon, Bahrain and Qubad—were still qjj^ the lips of men. Among the peopi of such a land it was the Bri+~sts privilege to exercise influence . ah out dominion, to obtain trade without acquiring territory: successive gene rations of British officials and mer chants had set their mark upon the Gulf without impairing the vigour of the local Governments, whose fweca- rious existence Great Britain had often assisted to maintain and had never destroyed.

Sir, I have the honour to state that the Artesian well with masonry tank, situated about 10 feet away from $he north-east corner of the new office building of the JPble. the Political Resident, requires to be demolished and a new one constructed some distance away from its present site due to the following reasons:- , (a) Steining pipe of the artesian well is completely worn out and the water percolates into the foundation of the new office building. This was observed before also when digging and laying the foundation of this building and necess ary precautions were taken by increasing the depth and width of the foundation and laying, extra cement -concrete but it appears now that the percolation, presumably due to further damage of the steining pipe, has considerably increa sed as a result of which the dampness • has risen up through the walls of the building. This is at present damaging the plaster. (b) The masonry tank is very badly cracked. The water leaks through its walls and foundation which, I think, is settled by the percolation of water from the artesian well. The tank Is, therefore, an additional source of causing, dampness to the office building. I am, therefore, of the opinion that immediate steps should be taken to demolish the existing well and the tank and construct a new one some distance away at a very early date otherwise the whole building may be damaged. I I have the honour to be, Sir. Your most obedient servant, ii! / ■ isor; Bahrain.

Persian Gulf, * . t PA-510 ^ -.y^ 20th March, 1946. H. B. M’s Political Agent Agency, Bahrein. Dear Sir, AGENCY WATER WELL File No. 762. With reference to your letter No.84^-18/1 dated March 15, 1946, the Company engineers are able to give you only a very rough estimate of the cost of relocating the artesian well and tank in the Agency garden because, in the final analysis, the cost depends entirely on the contract you make with the owner of a water well drilling machine for the drilling of the well. In 1940 the Company employed local contractors in the drilling of structure holes at a contract price of Rs.4/8/- per foot but it is estimated that the present price would be at least Rs.6/- per foot. This figure will be used in the following estimate. The Company is prepared to release materials for the completion of the well and give technical advice and assistance during its drilling. No charge will be made for technical advice and assistance. Again, the Company has no basis on which to estimate the cost of a masonry and cement tank built by a local contractor but on the basis of available data we believe that a tank similar in size to the existing one could be built for $300. The abandoning of the old well must be carried out with care and the cement for this operation is included in the following estimate under 'Materials*. Well Forecast Total Depth 230* 6' Casing to be cemented at 80’ Cost Estimate Drilling Contract (230 f © Rs.6/- p.f.)
