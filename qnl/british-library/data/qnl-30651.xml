Howes, M.Q 9 £., Political Agent, Muscat. The Hon*hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Sir, v&gt;&gt;* Bushire. A I have the honour to refer to your secret memorandum No. 24-S, dated the 12th January, 1942, on the subject of the South Arabian air route. 2 . I consider that by virtue of your having used the word rt unduly ,, , I may reply in the affirmative to your paragraph 3. I do not mean to contend that the work at Salalah might not have gone faster if there had not also been His Highness^ building programme there to compete with it for labour and materials; but I was quite satisfied on my last visit that both His Highness and his State Engineer have given us a very square deal, and got forward with the job in a most satisfactory manner. It is, I submit, worth keeping firmly in the mind of any possible critics that if His Highness had not had a building programme at Salalah, his State Engineer would not have been down in Dhofar; and I should not have been able to obtain at immediate notice (please see Government of India telegram No. 5666, dated the 8 th October, 1941) a supervisor ready on the spot, equipped with a knowledge of Arable. * J, J 3 . I am of opinion that the progress of the constructional works at Salalah could only be regarded as H disappointing tt by a person who had not had previous experience of conditions outside a developed country like India. I was myself agreeably surprised on seeing the progress of the work, when I last visited - ,m r ■2 teu Salalah. I do not, however, deny that even better results might have been obtained had Mr. Campbell found it possible to spend more time actually at Salalah. Two wireless engineers were left at Salalah two months ago} but they do not appear to have interested themselves in the constructional side of the undertaking. It is proverbially M the master's eye' that 'makyth the horse grow fat'; and I consider that if there has been any cause for disappointment, it should not be laid at the door of His Highness or of his engineer. Personally, I question whether it would be possible to point to any other place in the Arabian peninsula where an engineer could pay two flying visits and give} verbal instructions, return ing after a lapse of some weeks to find so much as one stone upon another• 4. I see that at one point of the report under reference, my words have been somewhat misrepresented; and I have corrected this in conversation with Mr. Campbell. On the third page of the report, in the third paragraph, the impression is given that my words 'the present arrangement is the best possible one in the circumstances' implied that I was averse from bringing in super vision from outside. This is not what I said or meant. I did say that the arrangement by which the State Engineer was looking after the air route work was the best arrangement I had been able to make at the immediate notice at which I had been called upon to produce an overseer with the necessary qualifications. 5. In the last paragraph on the subject of Has al Hadd, some correction is necessary. There is no Wali at Has al Hadd, which falls into the Wilayat of Sur. There is a local 'akid', who lives in the fort there. When I went down just before Christmas, the assistant engineer who was left on the spot to see to the levelling of the aerodrome, was established in a tent Vjikgide the fort area. The local akid guaranteed his safety there; and letters from His Highness to the Wali have been obtained which fix responsibility for the safety of our personnel on the Muscat authorities. The number3 of guards and other security questions have, however, still to he discussed in detail with the Wali (who has only just returned from Muscat to his Wilayat). On my last visit to Salalah, I obtained from His Highness the necessary letters to his Representative in Muscat and the Wali of Surj and arrangements for security must now be made by discussion with the Wali on the spot as soon as we ourselves know in detail the scale and area of the buildings which are to be installed.

While the Government of India are grateful to Sultan of Muscat for his co-operation in opening Southern Arabian air route and for assistance he has rendered in course of work at Salalah, it seems evident from reports of temporary withdrawals of labour and supervision from ^ . Salalah aerodrome work that extreme urgency of completing organisation of this route has not been altogether appreciated. It is essential that maximum effort be consentrated on this project, which is all the more urgent in view of need for -operational bases for the Royal Air Force on coastal reconnaissance, and the Government of India wish 1 /vt ti j c#- ' ? the Political Agent prescribe use every endeavour to induce Sultan to assist in providing increasing necessity for labour even at the expense of his own building projects. 3.

Presentt Group Captain Perry-Keene Group Captain Ironmonger * Colonel Lee Mr. i^glesfield (Dy. Director of Civil Aviation) Ur.Campbell (engineer Officer, Civil Aviation Directorate) The following points were agreed — (1) It is essential that the Political ^gent f Muscat, should visit H»H* the Sultan of Muscat at Salalah at the earliest possible opportunity to discuss in general the position at Masira ani Raa-al-Hadd ana in particular the question of usi% Salalah, Maaira and Ras^alcHadd as operational bases. To ao this an aircr Jft of at least 700 miles r %e woulu be n^cess^y. Mr. Campbell woula accompany the Political Agent* (2) As soon as this has been done, work on the preparation of the landing grouni at Uaalra should be put in hand aa: pressed forward imoedlately. fhUe this is bain, done, a airvey of the alighting area woula be Oiavisu out. Work at das-al-Hadd to proceed concurrently • (3) In view of the vulnerability of a depot ship to att iC&amp;, a staa shore base ahoulu be eatabiiahea at Uasira to aocomnouate »A, water condensing plant, motor transport, personnel, etc. never theless, a depot ship woula be essential at all events during the early stages of development of the base. After some discussion, it was agreeu that the most suitable site for the shore base woula be Unm Rasas opposite the alighting area. Althou^ this base is some 16 miles from the landing grouiu, it has the auvaBta&lt;i e of belnb screeneu from the sea, near such habitation and water supply - exist, adjacent to the anchorage of the depot ship when there ana convenient for flying boat operations. (4) in adaltion to the condensing plant at Uasir &gt;, one will no be necessary at Ras-al-Hadd in view of the possibility of a considerable/ ..••••jL-m ■* a - © to* A ship will &amp;ls»o be neco^^ciiv to carry pre-fabric at eel oui^ain^d, atores, aiotor transporti boiaba t conaensing plant t etc* for Masira* It is unlikely tbit all the pre-fa)&gt;ricatoa builain^a will be i^aay before the end of January. To jet on with the work with the Maximum expeclitioni two ships are therefore desirable f one to leave Karachi about the 15th (l*e* aa soon as j^ossible after Mr. Campbell* s return) to carry out the construction of the landing ground ana survey of the alighting area. This woulu also carry such pre-fabricatea ouiluin^s as are already an^i any other material that can be usefully sent at that time. A aeeoix: ship will be necessary at the ena of January or the beginning of February to carry the remainder of the supplies. It is most desirable th it the landing ground ahoulu be cun^leted as early as possible to make the use of the route prscticabl ? for comparatively short range aircraft and to enable air couiaunic ation to be established with *aaira for the secona stage of construction. This problem is obviously dependent on what shipping can be made available am when 9 ana a very early discussion with Naval Headquarters and the Controller of dhlppiife is necessary to examine this. (3, Provision of condensing plants This should be put in hand immediately and necessary priority arranged for steal as soon as the requirements are known. (4) Marine equipment! The possibility of launches anu power dlnejhies beiflb- built in Karachi to be immediately investigated, also the question of mooring ana marker buoy^. (5) Bombs and motor transport! These can probably be despatched on one of the ships ^oin to Uasirs for other purposes but that ship *ill | also have to go on x to Salalah to lam the equipment there. At Has-al-Hadd it can probably arranged for a Gull steamer to oj | diverted or alternatively transhipment at Jaiscat and thence by dho« but this will nat be so satisfactory. (6) personnel! It was originally intended th t British Air*ays l would provide the personnel at these station! i.e. */T operators, engineer/ ....— ^ eiyiiwer for maintananca of oomenaing plant, W/T plant, launches etc. and po.albly a coxswain. In view of the scale of M.T • vehicles now proposea, «iaitional staff will he necessary and the whole question requires re-examination. .hen air Head quarters have considered this aspect, an early discussion .-ould appear desirable* Mr. Campbell returned to Karachi on the 31st December and is taking action immediately on items (3) ana (4) above. Air Headquarters have already askeu Middle East to endeavour to obtain the use of the M.f. Impsria for the initial sta.es o construction at Masira. The question of obtaining &gt; depoxt s at this end is being pursued.L &gt; 1 VP of ^va^K iu iuulah. The Flight was made in accordance with following schedule. Karachi depart 12th instant.

BUILDUP. progress on the buildings is fair, two petrol stores have just been conpleted, the wireless station and the Met. station have also been completed. The dormitory is half-way between roof, level and plinth l3ve£. No work has yet been started on the lounge or sta^f quarters. AE-?OD;?OME dUHFACS, Some work has bean dona to improve the aerodroiae surface and it is considerably oetter than it was previously. It is still, however, far from satisfactory ana much more work remains to be done. ^ Mr. Pradhan Bingja, the State Engineer, explained that he had one no work on the aerodrome since the loth of December, owing to the fact that he was unable to suoervise tne work of the coolies! due to pre^cii® o-j- other works. In consequence he withdrew all the Intoui Iran the aerodroLne- as he felt that money was being wasted through la^K oi supervision. ^ - L. reg^ird to die supervision of the worK at &amp;alalah I invite your attention to paragraph 5 on page 3 of my last/ieport in which I stated Iwt-s not completely satisfied-vdth the existing arrangements, out the political Agent's «^«xxxi c deciued opinion that th^f ^rrantremen xM was the best, X agreed to accept io. Froru further exuerience. I fini that it is inadequate to meet our re sent 'nee ds^ and I must *k for the appointment of qualified supervisory staff to execute these works at Balalah. For the present in discussion with His Harness the Bui tan, the political Agent and Mr. Pradhan oingn, die tollo,W ha. „ 1U cont , luue e . tiS K Suimn will proluce lr«, his own household six pe(^)le to control iqhour on the aerodrome. , n^ 3. Dressing of tte aerodrome surface should oe concentrated upon, ao that may be fit ix for operation by all types oi d^cr within the next fortnight.- z * I’V Tiiis is an Interim arrangement axil I have not initiated wcrk on my of the additional. H.A.F. Duildings required; as I do not think they can he dene euificiently quickly fcy the present method to meet our requirements. I explained my attitude to the p.A. and he is now convinced that we should inport someone to supervise the wcrk. I also attach copies of corresppndence which passed between the political Agent and myseii. His attitude is that His Highness the Sultan has not asked for any remuneration and has placed the service of his state Sngineer e t our disposal, and we have in three nonuhs achieved a certain amount which is more than could oe expected under similar circumstances elsewhere in Arabia. I am not in entire agreement with this attitude as I feel that this work is most important now ana although oast progress has not been bad. we musts sk for oetter progress. It therefore seems that we must obtain a suitable overseer to, supervise the work, io will be impossi* ble to obtain anyone lairect recruitment; he must the rex ora be obtained from either the Provincial P.W.D. or the Central P.W.D. The political Agent has no odj action to a Hindoo being saat to ballalah, Although ne would prefer a Mohammedan. Cne of the reasons put forward for tiie &lt;x:ix±y delay in the building work was the fact t^ t Uie masons whom I hid sent from Muscat on the 2nd December naa not reciohea ttalulhh. This is iacsd indeed most unf ortunate out it amply demonstrates the dif fic 'flties oi trtdisport oy sea be tie an Muscat and Salalah. The dhow lait Muscat on the 2nd December and up •to-date has nou reached u al^l -c*, it ^so carries ^taln vital ^ ib Dl*it of the wireless set, -and aifc until tnese spare parts have been received, the station cannot operate efficiently.

My dear Campbell, I took an opportunity to mention to Hish Hjh;hness that you had not been expecting to pay any hire for the lorry; am he replied that Xfo he hati wished to lend it, but that you had insisted that it should be hired. Thai is as far as we can get. in fact, it was quite a/££t*raln on my* usual relations with His Highness to say afe much as I did. I quite get your point of view; but I think you will have to put it squarely to the Directorate---if they do raaife any fuss about this i temr---th3t in these parts it is not usual to get some tiling for nothing, sad you have really been very forturmte to fina on the sp spot a lorry which is costing you considerably less than cornels ould have done, aixi is twice or three times .as quick. As regards the pace of the work on the aerodrome and buildings, I should like to know in whit other part of the Arabian peninsula a an engineer could expect to pay two fleeting visits, and return a few weeks later to finu build inis erected to a proper design ty an overseer, not a penny having bean spent on importing (or paying him salary) or importing labour and material.

Your telegram No. 171 dated February 2nd. On 16th and 17th examined all works in progress at Dhofar. Buildings at present under construction nearly completed. Aerodrome still very uneven. Sultan’s building operations all reduced, sufficient masons, labour and stone available. Sultan has detailed eight of his servants to make the gangs work, without which present stage could not have been reached. State Engineer gives main attention to aerodrome and buildings but still spends part of his time attending Sultan’s work. Have impressed on Sultan and State Engineer extreme urgency of work and am satisfied of Sultan’s full co-operation. Campbell does not consider it necessary to ask Sultan to suspend his works at present. 3 . we are both of opinion however that full time super vision is essential and Assistant Engineer promised in paragr aph No. 4 of Government of India telegram No. 597 dated January 24th should be sent as early as pqssible. Sultan promises fill assistance. Campbell himself cannot stay as he has personally to collect material, plant, etc. in India for next voyage. 4. i propose returning to Dhofar with Assistant Engineer as soon as transport is arranged.

H BANDRA H (COMMANDER E,H* BRADY). H.T. H B«ndra H arrived off Moscat on February 7th. Four hundred liuecat coolies engaged through the State at a wage of £ 16/- per mensem plus food were shipped the same day. Hutting material for these men was also taken on board. Aboard were Messrs. J.H. Campbell f Engineer in charge (from Civil Aviation Directorate), C. Adams, British Airways in advisory capacity, and V.A. Griffiths, Burma Oil Company (Bitumen runway expert). There were also on board two British Officers and 30 - 40 Indians of No. 6 Artisan Company, the rest about 270 men to follow in 8 - 3 weeks* time. An iron water lighter was also towed astern to provide drinking water at Masirah. Next stop Ras-al-Hadd. Next day, February 8th, ship sailed at 6-30 a.m. speed about 8 knots. It was decided during the day that as the ship was over crowded with coolies and Ras-al-Hadd cargo difficult to get at the ship would go straight to Masirah and discharge coolies, Artisan Company and cargo. Masirah was reached nightfall February 9th and at dawn February 10th we steamed in to the anchorage of Ras Hilf. Mr. Adams went nearly to Umm Rasas in power launch in search of Sur craft sent for lightering (located one or two and ordered them to come to the ship). At the same time Campbell with Artisan Officer landed on beach to inspect site of camp, aerodrome and buildings. On going ashore I met a faw villagers from Ras Hilf village and ascertained that the Sheikh of Masirah, Sheikh Khamis, was in the vicinity. I sent a message asking him to meet me next morning. The work of landing coolies conlinusd all day and flnibj*eu at nightfall. Next morning, February 11th, two Suri small craft appeared alongside the ship and ware aet to work, rest had not turned up. Met Sheikh Khamis bin Hilal on the beach u the morning. Hs is obviously a man of soma influence in ne Island.I took tho Shoikh and party aboard 'Bandra* wbara thay war# bA own round by tba Commandar, Captain Brady. Tha Sbaikh had arranged to supply a numbar of craft for lighterage but owing to adverse wind these had not yet appeared. As a matter of convenience it was arranged to pay for craft by the day. I presented Sheikh Khamis with a .903 rifle brought by me for the purpose, but found the lack of amsunition to go with it somewhat embarrassing and t/ierefore borrowed a hundred rounds from the Commander for the purpose. I informed the Sheikh in terms of \H Political Residents telegram Ho. 7a dated the 17th January that he would be paid t 26 per mensem for his trouble. He replied that the amount was very meagre in view of the amount of work he had to do in collecting boats f etc., and the worry caused by his relatives' and others' constant demands of money from him. I said that the matter depended rather on his services and that I would see what could be done. I informed the Sheikh that six local guards would be required for Has Hilf camp now and other six later on for Uam Rasas. The Sheikh promised to select six suit able men as soon as possible. Captain Kemp, Commanding the Artisan Corp on shore, reported that extra water for the coolies would be necessary. The Sheikh agreed to provide craft to fetch water from wells at Dawa some distance down the coast of Jasirah provided that tanks and labour were supplied. This was agreed to. It was arranged that all monetary payments for craft, guards, etc., would be made through the Sheikh and not direct. It was ascertained from the Sheikh that the anchorage and beach at Has Hilf are protected during the south-west monsoon. On the 12th unloading continued whole day in moderately calm waathar. Eleven ilaeirah lighters were working. I landed at 9-30 a.m. with Campbell and Kemp and walked to the proposed site of the landing ground betwaen Jebel Jidufa and Jebsl Hilf, to two strips, one N.B.-S.W. and tha other W. K. are proposed. Surface loose sand stone on clay. Buildings, petrol stores, bomb stores, general stores and staff quarters will be built just east olHilf village. The village wall is very brackish bat sufficient for cooking purposes. We noticed a large number of cuttle fish bones which we were told were exported to Bombay via Sur. Large quantities of dried fish are also sent there. Got back to the beach to find that the tide was out. Beach is composed of fine white sand enclosed between two rocky outcrops about two hundred yards apart. Sheikh Khamis was waiting on the beach and I request ed him to come on board on the next day for final settlement regarding payment for lighterage 9 provision of guards, etc. Late in the afternoon Campbell reported that he had had trouble with coolies on shore. Sticks had been taken up and things had looked bad. Proceeded ashore immediately with Kemp, assembled coolies with their head men and enquired reasons which were t- (1). Neglect on the part of the Hindu contractor to provide anything like sufficient cooking pots and lack of cooking arrangements resulting in men having had no proper food since landing. (2). General fatigue and cold resulting partly from (1) above and from having to work in the sea most of the day, and (3). That they had been struck by the Indians of the Artisan Corp. The real cause of trouble was No. (1) and the men were obviously tired and disspirited. Imnediate arrangements are being made to rectify No. (1). It was also explained that regular work hours would be fixed as soon as landing operations had finished. There would be no contact between Indians aru wooiies, and ona day a week (Friday) would be observed as a holiday. The ^en ussar us of their readiness to work if these conditions were observed and they were given proper treatment, whlcn * asboi ^ would get. On February 13th tha number of local lighterage cralt had increased up to 22 and tha worK of unloading pi oceedeci fas About 2 p.m./Campbell reportad that they haa ail c ' 5 Abt J and collected off shore saying that thay would await the decision regarding their payment.me viiiiiKtt cane aboard at 3-30 p.m. and I requsstad to gat the craft working at once* he assured me that the boat owners had knocked off on their own initiative and without hie knowledge. After long and exhaustive discussion he eventually agreed on behalf of the dhow owners to the following rates below which he would not go i- (1) . Large boats of 200 bags capacity - * 30 a day. (2) » Medium boats of 100 bags capacity •&gt; £ 15 a day. (3) * Small boats of less than 100 bags capacity - # 10 a day. After this he had to go ashore again to ascertain the exact number of boats which had worked each day. The charges are no doubt high but considering how wild these people are and that H Bandra N is the first merchant vessel ever to call and unload cargo here, I think we have been fortunate in getting boats in such numbers. Three motor trucks and condensing plant were successfully unloaded during the day. Next morning| February 14th, Sheikh arrived on board early. He said he had slept out on the beach and complained of the ftold. He still appeared somewhat doubtful about the numbers of craft but eventually after some two hours a bill amounting to t 1,433 was made out. The amount was paid by Campbell in silver and handed over by me to the Sheikh for distribution. There were 22 craft of all sizes from Masirah working, eight were of 200 bags capacity. They are all built as fishing boats however and not very suitable for lighterage. Sheikh said that he had arranged six guards who would be produced at the camp tomorrow. After some discussion the pay of each man was fixed at 2 12 a month. I paid Sheikh £ 6 per man (l.e. half a months pay) to start them off and arranged with Campbell that the off leer* in-charge, Camp would disburse their monthly pay through the Sheikh. As regards Udbb Eases arrangements will be made when work commences there. I handed Sheikh jtf 100 to enable him to satisfy his relatives and other people in the Island. Sheikh asked for two boxee of ammunition (one of .303 and one of .476 bore). He also asked that(o4 the guards might be provided with rifles and ammunition. After discussion with Campbell it was agreed that a competent coolie master and interpreter was essential. I would take this up after seeing Sultan on return to Muscat. Unloading cargo was finished at 1 p.ra. Shaikh and I went ashore with money which he deposited in quarter guard to be called for later. I requested officer-in charge camp to see that coolies did not enter village of Hilf as villagers complained that they cause trouble there. I requested the Sheikh to appoint a vakil whenever he leaves the Island. Sheikh said he would. Things appeared satisfactory so returned to ship immediately. Ship sailed at 1-30 p.m. Next stop Dhofar. February 16th arrived Dhofar at 12 noon. Some wind from the sea and moderate surf running. Boats came out to meet us as we went ashore in motor dinghy* Khan Bahadur Ahmad Shubaily was in the first one. We transferred to it from dinghy and ran ashore through surf. Kative boats are built with planks sewn together with coconut rope. The bow is long and slanting. The beach extends from Has Raisut in a long curve past Husn (where Sultan’s fort and Air Force camp in coconut grove are situated) and northwards along the coast. On shore met by Saiyid Hamood, all of Dhofar, and Sheikh 2ubair who used to be Minister of Justice at Muscat but now is in Dhofar. He is originally a Baluch. At fort met by the son of late Salim Mandhari who used to command Sultan’s soeTyacht. He talks English sad works as clerk to Sultan. Sultan dressed informally in khaki robe and wi white head cloth met me at gate. House is coaifortabl? w*** furniture modern imported from Bombay. Hi* Highness nas a Goan cook end observes European style with guests. After lunch discussed various matters with ^uxtan. He agreed that a coolie master and interpreter was i. ■la*lrah and Bugg.at.d that l arranga on* at i&lt;u.cat through local authorItias. Regarding proposal to employ further 800 coolies at Kan-al-Hadd, His Highness suggested I talk with #ali Saud of Sur urn6 / Regarding the proposal that the State should build a read from Sur to Khor Jarama, Sultan appeared favourably inclined but requested that alignment might first be made by the Government. This was agreed to by Campbell. Saltan pointed out that his portion of road was much longer than that which the Government were building from Ras-al-Hadd to Khor Jarama. Rained heavily in afternoon for first time in the year. Radio message reported heavy rain in Muscat also. Visited personnel camp in coconut grove. Staff quarters and mess will be here facing the sea shore. Situation is about 4 mile from Sultan’s fort. Visited aerodrome which is about tnree miles inland behind Salalah village. There are five buildings including dormitory and mess hall. Last two unfinished. Power house, W/T and Met. offices, and store are complete. Dinner wil»h Sultan. Heavy rain falling. oultan says Raisut anchorage is sheltered from the monsoon (Commander Brady of ’’Bandra” considers that steamer cannot anchor close enough to enjoy shelter of headland)• Local inhabitants carry on fishing tnere during monsoon. Saltan has built motor road to Raisut. Open beach at Dnofar can be used for landing goods up to 15th of May. By nightfall half of the cargo had been landed. Remainder including lorry will be finished tomorrow. On February 17th heavy rain clouds over mountains at back. Fresh southerly wind blowing and sea rougher. Great difficulty in getting lighters alongside the steamer. Lorry could not be spends mornxng supervising v;ork on aerodrome buildings rest on Sultan’s work.

Raturnad to Palace and discussed question of labour and supervision of work on aerodrome and buildings . Impressed on Sultan and State Sngineer (separately) extreme urgency of work and requested full co-operation and that nothing should be alio &gt;ea to hinder. Sultan gave every assurance and has even detailea B of hie own servants to supervise labour gangs. Hie own work was much reduced and did not interfere with labour and material, i.a. st ie s. A certain amount of State Engineer's time le however taken up by Sultan's work. Campbell however does not consider that case will be met by pressing Sultan to suspend his own work. s both consider it essential that a full time Assistant Engineer fro* India should ba datailed for Salalah without daisy. Campbell bellaves that he can secure one on return. Sultan informs me that he is building a large ocean going dhow at Sur for trading purposes. He may build a second if venture is successful. During the day a telegram was received from Captain Kemp from Masirah raqueating^to remove 200 comes. Ho detail, iven . «e feared trouble as he gave no reasons.

Although it was late atnight Sheikh Khamie was in attendance with the headman of the guard appointed by him. Kemp and Boyd (the two British officers in charge of rtork at .iaalrah) informed me that they had a high opinion of Sheikh Khamis and of the newly appointed guards who are always ready to meet any requirements. They say that the Sheikh personally distributed the whole of £ 1,433 to boatmen openly in the cam. The Shaikh kept % 75 for himself (he has the largest boat) and each man returned £ 2 to him on going out. Water ie rather short but Sheikh has supplied a water boat on daily hire* Attempt will be made to survey a road to Umm Rasas and Dawa (where wells are) after which water can come by car, Kmbarked about 9 jum» in very rough sea* On February 20th ship left for Ras-al-Hadd at noon. On February 21st anchored off Khor Hajar about 10 a*a* Went ashore with Campbell and Griffiths and walked over proposed landing strips (two) 1,650 yards each. Also saw proposed sites of buildings. Ras-al-iiadd village situated close by (about one mile). At 1 p.ra. I set off for Sur in Agency launch to interview wali. Opposite Khor Jarama a serious breakdown occurred in the engine which left us at the mercy of a fresh wind and heavy sea. Fortunately distress signal was seen by the ship and the Dubai launch sent to bring us back. Launch subsequently anchored in Khor Hajar and will be brought back to Muscat when opportunity offers. Damage irrepairabls locally and broken part is being sent to Abadan on 'Bandra' for welding. On the monning of February 22nd Griffiths reported that Ras-al-Hadd collies had downed tools and gone off after demanding more money. Immediately went ashore. Indian overseer in charge of works complained that Ras-al-Hadd coolies were causing all the trouble and were out for money and not for work. They had had several free fights with Sur and lAiscat coolies and now about sixty had left work. Proceeded to Has-al-Hadd village and found one i Salim bin Basir who says he is Sheikh but appeal's to be without I influence (for good at any rate), also the Akid or ,l jemadsr ,, in charge of four Unseat aakaria in the fort.

Saiyid Shahab, “ le 0 f Sultan and representative in Muscat, was with us. Took direct course over Jebel Akhdar, 7,000 feet at this point, and part af Rub-al-Khall to Masirah, reached at 07.63, i.e. 1 hour 13 minutes - distance 210 miles. I doubt if direct course has ever been taken before. The two runways at Has Hilf have been completed and are very well done. Surface is hard gravel and There are 300 men and tifaree officers of “the 5 Artizan Corns in a good camp within barbed wire. Two concrete buildings „re nearly completed and the total will be 18 buildings eventually. A motor track to Umm Rasas has been completed and the whole stands out clearly from the air. Tomorrow part of the canip will ®oy# to Umn Rasas to commence work there where a similar set of buildings ia to be erected for the flying boat base. We found that the Sheikh who had interfered with our arrangements with Sheikh Khamis and had stopped the work on the road to Uam Rasas, was Sheikh Said bin Sultan, the chief k&gt; hei nf the Mai ala which is also Sheikh Khamis' tribe. Sheikh - aid 6 only h grievaffioe W was that as Chief Sheikh he was getting no allowance or share of guards, boat hire, etc. He is a true Bedouin with the characteristic love of money.

Several villages ai on the way* The mountains are, continuous on the left,,hand a distance of 1 - 2 miles from the sea f W« found the caa^p set about half a mile south-west of the village of Umm Rasas cloa beach. It was low tide and the Royal Air Force speed boat wa anchored about one hundred yards off shore in ten feet of wat sound between the Island of Shagha and the shore. The surf a calm in spite of the wind and the r{ sound appears sheltered fr&lt; winds. A jetty is to be built and mooring buoys to be laid this is to be a flying boat base*. 18 buildings are to be ei in the vicinity including a British Overseas Airways Corporal Rest House for which the furniture has already arrived albeit what damaged. One of the village wells of Umm Rasas yields fresh water without any trace of brackishness and if more we] sunk it is possible that the camp may not require a condensii although one is to be set up here. At both camps the flies worse than I ever»remember seeing anywhere* They fill the t follow everyone about in swarms. It appears that the dried trade of the Island is mostly responsible. The climate of 1 Island is good and the heat is not excessive. It is much c&lt; Muscat,. Indians and coolies looked well and said they founc climate good. They dislike the water of Ras Hilf owing to i brackishness. Lt* Boyd is in charge of the Flying Boat camp at Uj with three non-commissioned officers and two hundred Muscat 1 Some Indians are also there. The main camp will remain at t landing ground at Ras Hilf., Work is expected to be.completi about seven weeks 1 time after which the Artizan Corps and tin coolies will be removed. Arrived back at Ras Hilf camp at J 5 p.m. and found the &gt;, Bandra N had arrived from Salalah. Sheikh Said bin Sultan and Sheikh Khamis and once more imprej them the necessity of constant co-operation on their part wit British authorities Jon the Island.; The two Sheikhs said tni would do their best to co-operate in every way. I explainec they were responsible for the safety of both camps and all p&lt; and employees of Government also all property of Government Island including the Depot ship to be anchored off the coast Sheikhs accepted the responsibility and assured me that they see that nothing belonging to Government was interfered with, them made the payments mentioned above to Sheikh Said and pr Wed fou Dub urg med Eve coo it the looP&lt; &lt; pr&lt; I tents &gt;les anc &lt;oes anc leikh Kli Also ict as g 1 at Hair rid Shall; 2 Ras-al rid Shah ■ 4 .* ** .• v t Sheikh S agent, Saiyi For entc aid aske She ill at from /-i and i lorry at 22% llage o lages t , Jiand camp se sas clo boat « t of wat he surfa ered fr&lt; be laid to be ei Corpora 1 d albel yields more we! ondensii ie flies .11 the ' ie dried late of i much c( ley founc ring to imo at Uii at thi at I wi thi gome head-dresses to the two Sheikhs and other important persons and diemissed them. I arrived on board after 6 p.m. and found that the ship was remaining over the next day to enable Campbell to go over all the work, Tuesday* Marc n 3lg t a—iff,42* Campbell is pessimistic about the aerodrome surface here, he fears that with anything heavier than a Blenheim it may get badly cut up. It is very hard at present however and the wheels of our six seater plane left no impression. Campbell returned at lunch time. He had been to Umm Rasas and thought the sound between Shagha Island and the shore an excellent flying boat alighting area. He reported that a trench had been dug across the motor road near the village of Hilf which had held the lorry up a short time. This was rather disturbing news after having apparently settled the difference between the Sheikhs. However, petty annoyances of this nature occur anywhere. In Bahrain sign posts are torn down often and on the Batinah Coast when the road was first made ditches were often cut across to stop traffic. I told Kemp to send for the Sheikhs and make it clear that these annoyances must stop. He can even keep back their pay for a while if they fail to stop. I have since heard it suggested that one Salim bin Nasir of Sur may be at the bottom. This man probably wants to intrude himself into Masirah affairs for his own profit. Two of his party are on the Island, one Ali bin Musallim, the Akid “jemadar 11 of the guards at Has Hilf and the other Hamad bin Musallim probably his brother, who hangs on closely to Sheikh Khamis. As the “Bandra 11 was about to leave I requested Kemp to send for the Sheikhs on my behalf and inform them that another Akid should be engaged in place of Ali, and that they should make both of these men leave the Island. I will also consult with Saiyid Shahab on return as to other means ef getting rid of them. I think we should pay another visit to Masirah by air in about a fortnight. Lately Muscat and Ras-al-Hadd have frequently been visited by planes from Sharjah and there should, be no difficulty in sparing one to take us to Masirah. rt !andra w left at 5 p.m. for Ras-al-Hadd. gSa-MI (H-r ««■) « 08.30 ho*. — found State launch waiting for me. Griffith came off on ohe Dubai launch. He looked very fit but said that a doctor was an urgent necessity as there were about 800 men in the camp ^i oho at medical attention. I promised to represent matter on return. Everything on shore was quiet, but Griffiths says the Musca coolies do not work well. At Masirah they work very well, and it is the absence of an officer in charge of labour at Ras-al-Hadd that is responsible as collies must De properly uTganisea an Left for Muscat at 09.60 hours on state launch.- 5 - ^ z# \ Carried forward 14692 16472 Expenditure on Aerodrome and buildings etc. from 27th February to 5th March 42. 5879 46 Salalah house rent for Feb.1942 50 Landing charges from S.S.Bandra. 202 162 Expenditure on Aerodrome and buildings etc.from 6th wiarch-12th March 1942. 5551 52 Expenditure on Aerodrome and buildings etc.from 15th March - 19th March 1942. 5717 52 Expenditure on Aerodrome and buildings etc. from 20th March - 26th March 1942. 5752 156 Stones for Air Camp 16.5.42 64 Stones - do - 17.5.42 768 Stones - do - 27.5.42 480 Food expense for Masons and Coolies from Muscat for March 1942. 995 Rent of garden for March 1942 500 Rent of Salalah house for March 1942 50 Guards for Aerodrome for March 1942 180 Guards for Air Camp for March 1942 120 104 Watchmen for Salalah Rouse for March 1942 22 Paid to Mr. Dunderdale on 27.5.42 547 Tots.l 55089 17044Telegram From To No. Dated - Code. - Political Agent, Muscat. - Captain Kemp, Masirah. - C/337. - April 2nd, 1942.
