(b) Letter No. R-4/2029 dated 9th May from H.E. the Ruler of Kuwait to the Political Agent. 2. Both letters speak for themselves and 1 forward than without comments. 3 # In the event of His Majesty^ Government authorising me to accompany the Shaikh as his interpreter and companion on Jr his It months visit to the United Kingdom, I should like^to be understood now that I cannot afford to pay for my return ticket or live in expensive hotels in London at my own expense: I propose therefore asking His Excellency to put his hand in his pocket and assist me, if only with my railway fare home and out2 out. I trust His Majesty's Government will have no objection to my doing this. 4. At a dinner party which I attended last night, the Shaikh (who was there) mentioned casually that he hoped if all went well, to travel via Baghdad, Mosul, Allepo and Istambul on both the outward and return journeys, and that he would take only one servant with him. 5 # The Shaikh of course only wants me to go with him because i d of my linguistic capablities - I speak Nej^Arabic, which is his own dilect, and he feels accordingly at home with me, 6. It may interest you to know that the Shaikh was given a special and private gift of lis 24,000/— by the K.O.C# when he signed the Oil concession, for the express purpose to paying a visit to England, as soon as he could afford the time to do so.

I noticed from the beginning, of our conversation that His Highness is «exl disposed towards the Arabic press. He hinted, however# thrt journalists eometinies publish news 'before confirming the truth thereof. Certain sections of the press stated that Hie Highness presented a precious pearl, found in his domains, to Hie Majesty King George. But the truth of the matter was that His Highness took the pearl with him to England to show it to experts and brought it back with him for inciution in his collection of precious jewels. I told His Highness that ti-e origin of the nev^s was a telegram from London which our papers published without comment. I glad to know that this unique pearl will remain in his palace. His interview with the Kiru- Ql J Kn^lr:nd . I asked His Highness about his viyit to ..ondon; whether he enjoyed it and achieved the object of his journey. Kis Highness said he enjoyed hie journey and expressed hie pleasure at meeting King George Vvho ^as, together with the whole British nation, most hospitable. Ihough his visit wrs private and non-official, the English wished to make it semi official. When I asked him whether he could tell me how aucceasful had been the purpose of his journey. His Highness replied that he was not at liberty to say anything about thf;t. Between Bejd and Koweit. I questioned His Highness about the truth of the news, published\ publiBhed in the papers, regarding the bresk-down of negotiations between hie governnient fnd the Va *udi Arabian government respecting the questions in suBpenee between the two countries, and about the poeeibility of v resuoiption of the negotistj one. Hie Bighnees confirmed the newa, stating that before hiB journey to London, the Saudi Mi b aion, which consisted of Bo perBone (the delegetee and their retinue), were gueste Bt hie palace, f Che negotiBtion? broke down becauee the two parties failed to reach agreement on one point. He declare* that the negotiationa will be reeuju in the near future end that the contested point will be aoived in a mrnn« r satiBfactory to both pfirtlea. He added the bonde of ancient friendship which attach him end Kia Majesty Kin t Abdul Aziz will never break or weaken and will greatly facilitate the ne^otir.tionB. Between Koweit end Iraq, When I enquired about the relationB between Koweit nnu Iraci, Hib Highness replied thrt they are excellent, le are one nation, one people and one hand linked together by the bonds of national sentiment end religion. The Koweiti in Iraq or the Iraqi in Koweit feels that he i8 nt home among hit^ own people. The Koweitis and the Iraqis ere brothers. I asked whether eny efforts were bein^; made to join Koweit ana Basrr by a railway. He replied thet nothing is bein^ done at present but that it wes not impossible th/ t such a project be realizied in the future, I said that news telegrams stated th^t His Kigi'inesB intends to ma^e great efforts to improve education and public health in his country after his return to Koweit and to employ Arsb experts for thrt purpose* I esked whether he would be sending■ ll sending student b r.brord to study.

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, vSgd.) . 0's&gt; Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office, S.W.I.To Political .Resident, Bushire No. Dated 27th Deoemloer 1938. His Highness came today to tell me that he would like to get away to India soon, on a visit to include hunting and hawking. As he said !, I have : iad a tiring year - I have seen England and the West. I am 'bound in my relations to India, I should now like to go to India - taking my hawks with me.' Ee presuaes that he should go soon in order to get good hawking. 2. I gather that he is hankering after some de gree of official assistance and, subject to your views, I recommend this. His Highness has in the last year has 'been given, and apparently learnt t an important political lesson, and I think that the renewal of his ties with India will now 'be an excellent thing; and comes at the right moment. i therefore suggest that his visit should at least be given official cognizance and assistance, but that consideration should also be given as to whether or not his visit should in part, if convenient, 'be turned into an official one ? In that case perhaps dates could be suggested 4 # His Highness has of course noticed the official receptions which have 'been given to the ±iuler of jSanrain in England, and the visit of the Sultan of Muscat to His Excellency/Bxoe l leKicy the Vice roy, and he would no (iou'ot, he very pl eased i g^Leed if he too were given an official reception. At the same time it might he that in the circumstances of a visit of this kind and after the events in Kuwait during the last year, some words of advice from a high quarter might have most excellent and lasting effect upon him, —if mptalgi, political Agent, Kuwait a% Political Resident, Buahire. Government of India, iJew Delhi. January 1939. Powle to Metcalfe. Jhaikh of Kuwait has suggested a visit to India with hints that he would much appreciate that this should 'be an official one. 2. I think an official visit at the present juncture in I uv^ait affairs would be a -'ood thinj and if Government of India accept this » jr in principle i would propose informing the Shaikh unofficially that Government are prepared to invite him accordingly.

ResidentC on fid ent ial Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Kuwait ■D.O.NO.C/120. Dated the 28th February, 1939. Reference njy telegram No«?/48 of 24th February. I have discusaed the matter with de Gaury. de Gaury^ opinion, with which I concur, is that as the Bultan of Muscat has had an official Visit to India and England, and as the Shaikh of Bahrain has had an official visit to England, these three visits taking place in the last few years, the Shaikh of Kuwait feels rather out in the cold. Apart from the fact that the Shaikh has been ruling for some twenty years, in view of the increasing importance of Kuwait politically and strategically it is of considerable importance to do all we can to increase his prestige and attachment to us. An official visit which he would much appreciate would be a useful move in this direction. I would strongly urge therefore that some time in the future he should be given this privilege. A suitable opportunity would be, I suggest, next cold weather when flail oway who will then be Political Agent, Kuwait, could bring him to Delhi. It would, I think, have an excellent effect on the Shaikh if he could be informed now that he will receive an official invitation next winter.
