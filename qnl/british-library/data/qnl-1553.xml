BAHRAIN ST^yF . Bahrain Governments desire to start a Government Hospital in Bahrain.I©Translation of H.E f s letter 1st Ramadhan 1355. THE PALACE, MANAMA. To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent, Bahrain. After compliments:- We are writing this letter because in our opinion start a Government hospital for the benefit of the people of Bahrain. The health of our subjects is a matter of the greatest importance and the improvement of the public health is a matter which it is incumbent upon our Government to consider. The inhabitants of our islands number not less than 150,000 and at present only two hospitals exist, the Victoria Memorial Hospital which now has 12 beds and the hospital of the American Mission which is larger. All this is not enough. For many years no medical work has been done except by these two hospitals and we and our people will always be grateful for the work of the doctors of these hospitals; inshallah they will continue to carry on their good work which has our entire approval. But our subjects in Bahrain are numerous, more hospitals are needed and we wish to have a hospital of our own, which shall bear our own name. We have built schools, we have provided water, we have built roads and we have done many things to improve the condition of our people but health is more important the time is now suiftle for the Bahrain Government toimportant than all these other things. It is not suit able that people here and in all parts of the v/orld should be able to say with truth that in Bahrain the Government does not look after the public health and that the Government has no doctors and no hospital. We do not wish to reduce the work of the existing hospitals but we wish to make it possible for more of our people to receive medical attention. At present the people who live in the country receive little medical attention and there are over 200 villages without Manamah and Maharaq. In the beginning we wish to open a small hospital for men and for women and children and we wish to exploy a good English doctor and a female doctor. The doctor will take over charge of our municipal midwive^and our small dispensaries and he will visit the villages as well as working in the hospital. He will advise us on the best ways of improving the health of our people. The cost of the hospital, and annual expense. We will set aside in our Budget for next year a certain sum from the revenue / for the building and equipment of the hospital^ and we will place on deposit a sum which will pay for the maintenance of the hospital in years to come. May you be preserved and salaams, Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah.Translation 6f~a letter dated 16th Hamadhan 1355 (30th usual Ending.

I would not ordinarily have informed the Shaikh of a suggestion, before placing it before you, but I know that he is very anxious about the matter and had intended to speak to you about it. On the morning when you discussed with him the question of the Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, the proposals for an Accounts Officer, Engineer and Factor, put this question out of his mind.ff ■ © 4 # I gather from the Mviser that the Shaikh is very set upon having his own doctor and that a proposal (which has not of course been made to him) to utilize the services of the Residency Surgeon, when and if Residency is established here, would be unlikely to meet with his approval. b. In this connection I would mention that the Bahrain Petroleum Company are about to establish an hospital of their own at the New Cc.mp # An American doctor and his wife (also a qualified doctor) arrived on the last Airways 1 aeroplane and a matron from the Hospital of Tropical Diseases and four nurses are expected shortly. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant Lieut-Colonel, Political Agent, Bahrain.i#t\ t (9 D*O.No.2599. eU.o^. VcnAv The Residency, Bushire, the 27th December 1936. ” \ ' A ‘\ Could you please refer to your letter No.c/533-4/12 dated the 7th December 1936, with enclosures, intimating that His Excellency Shaikh Sir Hamad bin * Isa wished to establish a hospital. 2. I think that this is an excellent scheme and I shall be very pleased to give all the assistance I can to the Bahrain Government in the matter. The proposal at the end &lt; ? of the Shaikh’s letter for ensuing adequate funds appears sound. I entirely agree that it would be a good thing for the Bahrain authorities to have the benefit of the Residency Surgeon’s advice on this highly technical medical matter, and I have asked Rooney if he will visit Bahrain for this purpose, as you suggest. He will be very pleased to do so, and I am sure his advice will be extremely valuable. 3. I have talked the matter over with Rooney and the main questions to be decided appear to be those which are in the attached questionnaire. 4. I suggest that the Bahrain Government now decide in general terms, and approximately where finance is concerned, the replies to as *any of the above queries as they can. ^.Vhen they have thus given us an outlined picture of what they want we shall be in a position to assist them in filling in the replies to the more technical questions and in giving them general advice. It is at that stage that Rooney can usefully visit Bahrain. Lieut.-colonel Gordon Loch, C.I.E., Political Agent, , Bahrain. 5 . / i. r fj © - 2 - 5* The procedure will naturally ta^e time, and if the Shaikh gets impatient you might explain to him that no wise rran lays the foundation of a house without considering what the whole house is going to cost him. In the present case the scheme cannot be started piece-meal, and if the hospital is to do the Shaikh credit the details must be worked out beforehand, so that there is no hitch once it gets under way. People are only too ready to criticise, and obviously the hospital which is going to bear the Shaikh’s name must be above criticism. O 6. You will of course talk the whole matter over with Belgrave, and I enclose a copy of the questionnaire for him. I daresay that we shall have a certain amount of correspondence on the subject and it will be convenient if it follows the form set by the questionnaire. 7. I remember talking the question of the hospital over with Belgrave at home in a general way but we will now have to get down to brass tacks. * * c. •BAHRAIN HOSPITAL, Points for decision. (1) . Site of the Hospital ? (2) o How many wards? Two presumably, one for men and one for women, but see (9) below. (I note that the Shaikh wants the hospital to be for both sexes).

What other rooms are required attached to the hospital* servants quarters etc.? ( 6 ) . What quarters are required to be built not attached to the hospital, i* e&lt;&gt; Doctor’s House, or he is going to be accommodated in some existing building ? (7) .

If (a) one general cookhouse will be suff ici ent. If (b) smaller cookhouses will however be necessary and also quarters for relations. (9) . Will the patients be fa) nursed by their relations or (b) be nursed by the hospital staff? If (a) then quarters for the relations will have to be built, and the wards will have 10 be small, confined to one or two beds. One cannot have a crowd of relations filling up the wards. (10) . Is there going to be an infectious diseases block? If so this of course will have to be separate, and there will have to be a separate nursing staff. (id /( 11 ) # To what extent will the hospital be free ? Presumably those who can will have to pay, and the others not. This is the general system of hospitals everywhere.

He agrees *ith r^y proposal that to seek the advice of the Residency Burgeon on so highly technical a matter and will arrange for Major J. Rooney, tne Residency Burgeon, to visit Bahrain for this purpose in cue course. 4. The Honourable the Political Resident, however, thinks that, before Major ^ooney visits Bahrain, it would appear advisable that he shouiu be given a general outline of what the Bahrain Government require. 5. I am accorcingiy attaching to this letter a questionnaire ana request that the Bahrain Government will deciae in general terms (ana approximately, so far as finance is concerned) the replies to as many of the queries as they can When these queries have been answerea.

I enclose the answers to the question* naire sent by Major Rooney: the Bahrain Government would be very grateful if he could visit Bahrain and discuss the matter when possible. 3. The estimate for buildings is for build ings of local type such as those constructed by this Government at Jufair and elsewhere last year but I have estimated the expenditure at being considerably higher than the cost of buildings lately erected in order to be on the safe side. I have had long consultations with Dr. Holmes on the subject of equipments etc. and we have examined lists and catalogues but even so the amount which I have given is only approximate. 4. Regarding pay of staff; the pay of the Indian staff may appear high in comparison to rates elsewhere but conditions in Bahrain are unusualunusual, a motor driver can today earn Rs 100/- per month, or more and educated Indians are in great demand so that it is necessary to pay them well in order to retain them. The pay of Indian Nurses is what the Bahrain Government has been paying here for some years to the municipal midwives.

M f s Political Agent, Bahrain. R.Res idency, 2.1 ^Marc-H, 1937, A matter whicii I conaider is well worth taking in nand. while the Bahrain Government is interested in tne question oi Health is the establishment ol a Bahrain Board of Health, composed of representatives from all sections. 2 # At present there is no body which can attempt to stamp out prevalent prevent!ble diseases, such as malaria and dysentery. Malaria, of course, is the principal of these and measures can be taken to considerably lessen its incidence, but the co-operation of all parties and the education of the people in health matters would be necessary. 3 . My suggested composition of tne Board is as followsi- r € Presi dent His Highness the Ruler of Bahrain. Ghairman Political Agent, Bahrain (ex officio) Deputy Chairman Adviser to tne Bahra. n Government (ex officio) Chief Health Officer C.Q.M.O. (Residency Surgeon, Bushire) for tne Arab side of the Gulf (ex officio) Assistant Health Officers . * The Assistant Surgeon to the Political Agency and Q.M.O. Bahrain (ex officio) The Medical Officer to the Bahrain Government (when tne post is filled) (ex officio) Seer etary . Any suitable individial for recording the minutes of meetings etc. Lieut.-Colonel Gordon Loch, CIS., Political Agent, 3a hr a in • Members /ilember a. \ A representative of the Persian Gulf (Naval)Division. A representative of the Manaman 'au nioi ^* i --j A representative of the Muharraq Municipality A representative of the Bahra n Petroleum Company A representative of the Arabian (American) Mission. 4. The advice of the medical members would be useful, but the application of their reconmendations would require executive action 0 n the part of the other Authorities concerned. 5, There are, of course, various directions in which the Board could function, but I feel that if they attempt too much it will be a case of 'all cry and little wool” as too olten happens with Conmittees everywhere. On the other hand if tne Board concentrate in one particular direction tney are more likely t 0 make good, and thus get tne confidence of tne public - an important consideration. The most obvious direction in which the Board can usefully concentrate is Mala ria, and I think the Board might for some time disregard all other considerations and pursue a vigorous campaign against this scourge. ro^irds uni3 end I suggest that the Bahrain Government might allot a Special Fund to be at the disposal of the Board. 6# This letter has been sent after full discussion with Rooney. Please discuss it with the Shaikh and Belgrave, and • if the Shaikh approves of the idea in general - with the other communities involved. 7. The question of the health of Bahrain is obviously a most important one and I am anxious to get the Board working as soon as possible. Rooney is visiting Bahrain next month, and that would /-3- would be a good opportunity for a first meeting of tne ^oard. Sven if tne Board was not fully constituted by tnen some sort of meeting might be held and a general plan ox an ant i-maxar ia campaign drawn up. This campaign will largely depend on the j size of tne Special Fund which the Bahrain Government are prepare! to allot. Perhaps this point could be settled before Hooney's, arrival, and you and Belgrave, with Holmes’s a33i3tance f could get your ideas clear on the subject by preliminary discussions. 4 ^ c.-GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, Department, EXPRESS LETTER [N.

A younger man woula not hav© the necessary experience and an olaer man might find it difficult to start work in Bahrain, if a man of about thirty fitted into the job well, be woula oe able to settle down to fifteen or twenty years in charge of the hospital, ana that is really what is wanted. With regard to qualifications, a good knowieage of surgery and eye diseases would be essential. Be should also have had some experience of public health work. A suitable man would be one who has been a louse surgeon ir a General hospital. He would have acquired seme experience of hospital administration from this appointment. 'v V f* The best way of finding a man wcula be to aaver- tise ir a couple of medical papers - say The Lancet and The British medical Journal.* 1 could also write a letter, giving all particulars, to Guy’s Hospital Gazette and this would be read in other hospitals.

Copy INDIA OFFICE, P.Z. 512/38 Y/HITEHALL, S.W. 1 26th February 1938. Confidential My dear Fowle, Very many thanks for your most informative letter of the 23rd December (No. 888-S) about developments in Bahrein, which I have shown to Stewart. We have read with great interest your account of the various directions in which the local administra tion is making progress, and we fully agree with your view that, although outside help is inevitable at this stage, our object must be to teach Bahreinis to govern themselves. With regard to the reference in paragraph 8 of your letter to the intention of the Bahrein Government to advertise for a Medical Officer, the advertisement was apparently inserted in recent issues of the British Medical Journal, with the consequeni that we have had visits from three or four doctors enquiring about conditions in Bahrein. If any of the applicants in Eng land seem to the Bahrein Government prima facie suitable and if it would help the latter to have any promising candidates inter viewed and reported on by our Medical Board, and you would let me know, I should hope that we should be able to give any pos sible help in the matter in this way. Yours ever, Sd/- J.C. WaltonBahrain, March 8 , 1938. Dear heightman, With reference to our conversation today about the appointment of the Bahrain Government Medical Officer - you mentioned that the India Office had offeree to have some of the candi- dates looked by the Medical Department of the India Office. It would be of very great help if this could be done and we should be most grateful if the India Office authorities could give us an opinion on the following applicants who sound the most likely men out of the applications which we have received. 1. Dr. Ian Davenport Jones, The Middle sex Hospital, W. 1. 2. Dr. F. B. Turner, Hoyal automobile Club, S.W. 1. 3. Dr. M. F. D. haters, St. Stephens Hospital, 369, Fulham Hoad, S.W. 10. 4. Dr. B. m. Bertram, 7, Willow Hoad, Hampstead, i\i .W. 3. 5. Dr. John Martin, HoltsBank, Whitehall. Two or three of the other applicants who sound possible are abroad, in India and in nfrica and as I think it is essential that they should be interviewed first 1 am not including them in this list. The man who had been working with the iijaglo Iranian Oil Company applied for the post which- 2 - is now held by Dr. Kennedy, and was not accepted. I enclose a copy of the advertisement inserted in the Lancet and the British Medi cal Journal, also a note giving an idea of the duties of the doctor and the applications in original of the men on the list. I should like the doctor to start work before I go on leave, in June, if possible^ and for this reason do you think it would be possible to send the papers direct to the India Office and ask them if they would be so kind as to report on the applicants and advise us which they consider most suitable? This would obviate much delay. The Bahrain Government will willingly pay air mail charges on thi^ postage of the file. Yours sincerely, H.

The medical Officer will be in charge of the Grovernment Hospital which is now being built in Manamah. The hospital is intended to have about 30 beds for men and also a ward for women and children but the latter will eventually be in charge of a woman doctor as the patients are Moslem and purdah. The hospital is for the local .arab population and not for Europeans. The medical Officer must be capable of both medical and surgical work. Among the prevalent diseases in Bahrain are malaria, venereal and eye diseases. Attached to the hospital, but in a separate building, is an out patients dispensary and clinic with accomodation for men and women. This building is in the course of construction, the main hospital and wards have not yet been commenced. The staff of the hospital will be entirely Asiatic, Indians and local Arabs. Patients in the hospital will be fed by the hospital. 2.

Sir, 1 consider it my duty to inform you of my recent resignation from the post of M.edi.CEi. Llf-ficer. .t.Q— Bahrain Governm ent and to acquaint you with my reasons for doing so, both because you mentioned as referee to my contract with the Bahrain Government and because I was selected for this post by a Board conven^ed by the Under Secretary of State for India, at the India uffice of which the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was a member. I do not think that this Board would have been willing to recommend me to such a post, had they been aware of the exact state of affairs obtaining in Bahrain, nor do I think you would now be willing to recommend a successor. 1. Althougn I was aopointea in April 1938 and reached Bahrain in July of that year to take charge of the new Government hospital which was said to be nearing completion, the hospital is in fact so incomplete at the present time that there is not now accommodation for a single patient, nor is there a likelihood that the hospital will be completed for a very considerable time, which i would put at little less than two years, judging from the present rate of construct l.on. This has meantfthat for the past fifteen months, I have had to work under conditions of the utmost difficulty, and that my time has to a great extent been wasted; nor do I see any hope of improvement in the near future. 2 . I do not consider that I have received that co-operation and assistance which I might reasonably expect from the present Adviser, who by alloting to himself control of oublic works, funds, staff and other state affairs, is able to interfere at will in all matters affecting the medical and other state departments.

In viev» r of these considerations I have for some time realised that it was little use continuing in this oost. 1 think I should add that my resignation followed an incident with an Indian emoloyee of the Government whose insolence was hardy unexpected. I regret this incident but would adc that it was in no way connected with my resignation, although it may possibly be exaggerated. Finally I would add that it is 'with considerable regret that I give up my post here, both because of the excellent opportunities and the enormous demand for medical work which exists. I do not however consider that any medical man, whose prime interest lay in his work, would wish to continue under- present conditions.

Davenport Jones having left Bahrain the problem now confronts us of finding a successor as State i edical Officer. There have been various possibilities which now f as I see it, have boiled down to two, namely Dame and young Holland from Quetta, son of Sir K nry Holland. 3. Shaikh Hamad is very anxious to have Dame, though I do not think that the rest of the family, except perhaps Salman, are quite so keen. To my mind there are serious objections to Dame being appointed. He is on terms of hostility with the Mission from which he came and with the Bahrain Petroleum Company from which he resigned some months ago. He is inclined to be quarrelsome and overbearing, and I am definitely of the opinion that he is anti-British. On the other hand there is no denying th fact that he is a good doctor (though many people think he i* a grent deal too fre^ with the knife) and he has a good way with the Arabs. But perhaps the greatest objection to him is that he fishes for and obtains frequent invitations from Ibn Saud to attend him and his family in Riyadh. If he were appointed Bahrain doctor Shaikh Hamad would, I am sure , find it quite imposs ible to refuse periodic requests from Ibn Saud to send Dame up/- The Hon’ble Lieutenant-Colonel C.G. Prior, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.up to Riyadh these visits are liable to extend to months at a time. 4. While on this particular point I think I should mention the possibility which 1 have heard f that Dame will be paid by the Califonia Arabian Standard Oil Company to be Tbn Saud*s personal doctor, I shall probably hear definitely in about a month*s time whether thia to be the case or not# It is a question whether in present circumstances we should not intervene in this matter# I am sure that Dame will not be a good influence from our point of view, and I am fairly certain that it would not be impossible to induce the California Arabian Company to abandon the proposal. Thornburg for instance is most hostile to it and could probably be used to influence Skinner, who is due here in about a month and will, I gather, make the final decision. 5. To return now to Bahrain. I know young Holland very well and I believe that he wi 1 be quite admirable in a pioneering job like this. He is keen, energetic and tactful and though he would only want to stay here for three years or the duration of the war, t' at would suit admirably since after the war the Bahrain Government will be better able to pick up a good man from home. T 'e is rather young, it is true, but he has five years experience in Baluchistan and the North West Frontier Province. Another disadvantage is that he could not come here before the beginning of April 1940, but I am not sure that this matters so vitally since the new hospital will not be re dy before then. 6. I think I shall have to have a talk about this matter with Shaikh Hamad fairly soon and if you agree I shall tell him that we do not think Dame would at all be suitable, even if he is available. The Shaikh will be disappointed and probably it will be a little difficult to convince him? and/-— cand I should like t»o be authorised to say to him resort that Dame is not persona grata with us.

Holland 2. I think the following facts ought to be taken into consideration. Dr. Holland, at the time when he booked his outward passage from Karachi to Bahrain through the Imperial Bank, Cuetta, also booked a return passage on January 2nd, 1940. He was at that time informed that this would be arranged. On arrival at Karachi he was informed by your Company’s representatives there that they could not guarantee a sect on the 2nd January after ail but were booking for the 4th January. This was iat- r than Dr. Holland wanted, but he was informed 'that it would be all right if he saw the Station Superintendent at Bahrein'. On arrival here he found that your office had no’ information about eastbound services early in the new year. This of course is not the fault of the Bahrain office but the fact remains that information could not be • given; the natural presumption was that there would be considerable delay and it became necessary to book a return passage /-I I passage by the first available plane going east. It then happened that that first plane passed through on January 1st and Dr. Holland was unable to use this passage. 3. It was scarcely Lr. Holland’s fault or the fault of the Agency that any telegrams had to be issued from Bahrain or that the air services hue. been aislocateu for one reason or another or that Alexandria and other stations west were apparently unable to give information about probable dates of eastbound services. In these circumstances I do not con sider that the Company is justified in demanding this heavy charge of Rs. b7/2 for telegraphic bookings. Had the original return booking been upheld or had there been adequate information in advance of the dates on which the eastbound services were passing through Bahrain the entire charge couiu have been avoided.GOVERNMENT OF BAHRAI D.O.

Dear Weightman, I am returning Snow t s letter. I have discussed his appointment with the Shaikhs and His Highness has approved it. We are prepared to pay him a salary of Rs 1,250/- and other conditions as ment and I am sorry that I cannot make any alteration. Leave and furlough are on full average pay, average of preceding 12 months. Pay is by the arabic month, which means 10 - 11 days more pay per annum than if reckoned by Gregorian calendar. Passages are given to the official himself only, not to his family. Local leave is only granted after one year of service, I think that if Snow was given leave after being here only five months it would interrupt work. Should his appointment not be confirmed he would be given first class passage to place of residence. Regarding Customs: all Bahrain Government officials pay customs which varies from 5 - 1($ except in case of liquor and cigarettes on which customs is 15j&amp;. stated in my previous Regarding the various questions in his letter.

I think I should explain, in regard to the pay question, that I had to ask the Shaikhs^a special rate of pay for Harry Holland as we knew that when he came here he would have to con tribute ?s. 500/- or 600/- per mensem to the C.M.S. However the matter has been put again to His Highness and his advisers and they agree to offer a starting salary of Rs 1250/- per mensem tc you c-lso, with increments and Provident Fund as previously stated. ,%/ i$l 3. In regard to the leave question, I am afraid it is not possible for the Bahrain Government to meet your proposals. They already employ seven Kuropeans all of whom enjoy the leave and passage concessions which were offered to you. I am sure you will understand that if special terms were proposed for the .^tate edical ( fficer it would lead to considerable diffi culty with the other European employees. I fear therefore that the leave terms must remain as already offered. I ^»y add that if you desire to take the 30 days* 'local' leave towards the end of the coming hot weather this will be agreed to. 4. In regard to leave salary, this is granted on full average pay, the average being that of the preceding 12 months. Incidentally I might mention that pay is given by the Arabic month, which means that in a full year as reckoned by the Gregorian Calendar you receive an additional 10 or 11 days' pay. 5. As for passages, I am afraid these are only ^ranted to the officials themselves and not to their families. This is general with all European employees here. Dr. H.H.B. Sno\\f Fennel Memorial Hospital, C.M.S. Bannu , N.w.F.P. 6 /-2 - 6 . The Bahrain Government agree that if the appointment - is not confirmed after the period of six months* probation a first class passage to the place of residence will be granted, 7* In considering the terms offered a very important point to remember is that there is no income tax in Bahrain and that other taxation is extremely light. Customs for instance vary from 5 to 10 %, except for liquor and tobacco oh which the rate is 15 %. Indeed as far as the Bahrain Government servants are concerned there is no other taxation whatsoever. On the other hand servants are rather expensive since one needs an Indian cook, house servant and Ayah (if required), though sweepers and massalchis can be obtained locally. For clothing you require the same stuff that you use in India and I do not think that there is anything extra that you need bring. The bazaars are well-stocked and pro vide practically everything that one can need.* j 8 , I received your telegram on the 21st March and am very glad to hear that London agrees to your accepting the appointment, I hope you will do so as I am sure you will find that you have a most interesting task here.

The main reason is the White people who are here in this hospital are treating the Indian workers very badly. For this main reason only the strike has been risen. You may not know unless you come and se ths place , it i 0 very hot in summer and very cold in winter* In hospital we have got electric fans. Day and night it is so kt hot we cannot make the fan stop. So we had a notice*from the medical of icer that the fan should not run for 24 hours. It must be storped for a hours in 24hrs. We did and obeyed the ml order after sometime without giving any formal notice they h^ve fined each nurses Rslt/-* For every silly little thing they are trying to fine and they treat us worse than 3rd class xxi coolies* aee the workers here are all getting war allowance whereas we are getting nothing of that sort. Nowadays no wheat or wheat flour is not being exported from India so it is too difficult for the people here to live, 'e get old stuff that is £■ rotten wheat flour. It xx gives bit er/ ESC U bitter taste if anything, is prepared with it. We have got one Indian cook. '^e tried with that flour bread. That bread was so bit f er we could not eat. Then we prepared chapathi out of that flour it was little hit±»g better. So we said m c n have chapathi better than bread. For that our matron got so angry and she said that we must eat that br^ad. We complained it is so bitter that we cannot eat. The&gt;&gt;she s.iid that if we don't like bread and cannot eat that we should go without bread. You see, why should they keep one Indian cook if they can’t give Indian diet? So daily in the morning we are going to work without anything. They want only work from us nothing else. % About the fine the male nurses given a notice saying that they cannot pay it for that they tam never arexpb accepted. So all the male nurses o resigned the post and have given one month s notice from July 17th to August 17th. That too -they have accepted so the female nurses also given. I You see all r ill get^ passage easily except me* For I it is not yet one year. If I complete one vear then I too can have that. That shall I do now? I am also writing to father saying to keep Rs.300/- ready in hand if the matter is not settled here* What can I do if everybody goes? The ticket for passage itself from here to Bombay is Rs.240/- plus food. Please pray for us*. When everything is danger in the world we are in danger itself inside the hospital. No more I can write. I am so much worried. My love to all. Censor Station. Madras. Dated 27th July 1942. C1H/G/13. Your loving sister-in-law, Sd. M.R* David. Sd.

Political Resident in the Persian dulf. Attested, for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.\M{ No.C/1354, The Agency, Bahrain, the 6th September 1942 There has recently come to Colonel Hay* s notice a complaint by an Indian nurse in the Bahrain Government Hospital about the treatment being meted out to Indian employees there. The first cause of complaint is an order alleged to have been passed by you that fans must not be run for more than 16 hours out of the 24. The second is that they are frequently fined for little or no reason. The third is that whereas other Bahrain Government employees are given war allowances they get none. The fourth is that, although there is an Indian cook in the hospital, they are not allowed to eat chapathis but are told they must eat bread. The letter goes on to say that all the male nurses gave a month*s notice on July 17th, as they objected to being fined, and that the female nurses followed suit. 2. Will you please let me know, for Colonel Hay*s informatioia, whether there is any truth in these complaints and what is the position regarding the notice given by the nurses. Yours sincerely, Dr. R. H. B.
