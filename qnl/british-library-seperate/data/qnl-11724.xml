Much of the correspondence concerns the extent of control (or lack thereof) exercised by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] in the Omani interior. Related matters of discussion include the following: the evidence for the boundaries claimed by the Sultan along the Rub al Khali, and the question of whether Buraimi [Al Buraymī] forms part of his territory; the Sultan's relations with various tribes based near the Trucial shaikhdoms and his claims of authority over them; the views of Wilfred Patrick Thesiger on the situation in the Omani interior and the risk of parts of it falling under Saudi influence; the course of action to be taken by the British authorities regarding the Sultan and the tribal shaikhs.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Political Agent, Bahrain; the Political Officer, Sharjah; officials of the Foreign Office.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent, Trucial Coast</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>District Magistrate, Bahrain</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Jurisdiction</topic></subject><subject><topic>Tribes</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x000019#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
