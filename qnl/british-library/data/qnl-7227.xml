History, Administration and Population. 1. General—The town of Kuwait came into existence about the commencement of the 18th century, and was founded by settlers of the 'Utub tribe or Bani ' Utba, a branch of the Anazah of Nejd. The 'Utab consisted of three principal divisions : the Jalahimah, Al-Khalifah and Al-Subah. The Al-Khalifah subsequently moved South and conquered Bahrein where the r descendants rule to the present day, wh le the Al-Subah remained at Kuwait and founded the present dynasty. Kuwait sprang rapidly into an important commercial centre and soon became the entrepot for the trade of Cen tral and Northern Arabia, a position lost to it only within the last few years by the blockade instituted by Ibn .Saud. It is still a centre of the pearl-fishing 1 industry. The formation of the Kuwait Oil Company in Jan uary 1934, and the grant to the Company of a conces sion covering the whole of the Kuwait territory in 1935, brought increased prosperity to Kuwait. 2. Early History —In the latter part of the 19th century, the relations of the Sheikhs of Kuwait with their powerful neighbour in the west, Ibn Rash d, the chief of the Shammar, were generallv hostUe. and it was largely owing to the assistance of 'Sheikh Mubarak Kuwait that Abdul-Aziz Ibn Saud, now ruler of Saudi Arabia (and at one time a refugee in Kuwait), was able to conduct a successful campaign against their LS176CGS(P)2 common enemy, the Shammar, and annex their terri tories in 1906. The subsequent hostile attitude of Ibtt Said towards the ruling family of Kuwait has laid him open to the charge of gross ingratitude. Before 1895 official intercourse between the Bntisb Residents in the Gulf and the Sheikhs of Kuwait appears to have been infrequent, though personal relations were excellent Kuwait was, nominally, until about 35 years ago, in- eluded in the Ottoman province of Basra, but the bheik was accorded complete local autonomy m his own area. The British Government insisted on dealing directly witn the Sheikh, when the Baghdad Railway question began, and supported him against the Turks with whom Sheikn Mubarak repudiated all relations in 1914. In 1899 Sheikh Mubarak signed an agreement with the British Government, binding h mself and his succes sors not to hand over any part of his territory to foreign ers without the consent of the British Government. Four years later he accepted a British Polit cal Agen at his court. He subsequently regarded himself as under British protection and made important and ex clusive concessions to us. 3. Recent History—On the outbreak of war in 1914, the Sheikh of Kuwait made a declarat.on of loyalty and placed his ' efforts, his men and his ships at the dis posal of the Government of Great Britain ', offering at the same time to eject the Turkish garrison from the Islands at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab. The ter mination of the war necessitated a decision as to the status of Kuwait, which H. M.'s Government had pro mised in November 1914 to recognize as an independent principality under British protection. As a reward for having entered the war on our side, the Shaikh was also exempted in perpetuity from paying taxes on his date gardens in Iraq, The outstanding feature of the post-war history of Kuwait has been the stra : ned relations with Ibn Saud. Owing to the non-ratification of the Anglo-Turkish con-3 ventions of 1913, the boundaries of Kuwait, which had ' f th ^ Gunvention &gt; rema ned in a fluid state at the end ox the war, and it was not until 1922 that an agreement was reached. Under this agreement Kuwait lost two-thirds of her territory 4.

A series of disagreements over — ( 3 uestlons com menced between the Sheikh and council. In December, the Sheikh decided in toThelrb t S the /- wi ^ 0 PP 0 -tion of the people TW arbitrary use of its power, to dissolve the council. New eleetmns were held towards the end of the month and a fresh council of twenty members was elected. as i/ S r^ mi ? + neVer seriousl y commenced its work the chipf US f C f 0 ace ^ pt 'Sheikh's new Constitution, counS f ^ 0f Which was the chan ^ of the rom an executive to an advisory one The council was, therefore, dissolved on March 7th,' 1939,4 and a new Advisory Council was formed This council is of fourteen members, nine notab.es and five members of the Sheikh's family ; the president is the bneikn s cousin. The Sheikh himself is the executive power, and, has a right of veto. The new council is, in tact, a committee of experienced elders, and since .ts tion conditions in Kuwait have again become settled. It ,vas at this time that the agitation and propaganda from Iraq, described below, rose to its greatest heights. 5. Relations with neighbours. — (o) Relations with Saudi Arabia have at times been strained as a result of the blockade instituted by Ibn Saud, in connection^ with the customs dispute between Ibn Saud and the Sheikh of Kuwait. This dates from before the war. With the acquisition of El-Hasa in 1913, Ibn baud acquired a sea board, which had, however, no port of any real value. A friendly understanding Avith Bahrein and Kuwait on the question of customs and transit dues, therefore, was essential. Agreement with Bahrein was reached in 1920, but as no agreement could be reached with Kuwait, Ibn Saud has since then maintained an embargo on trade with Kuwait, with the result that the prosperity of the principality has been seriously aftected. One of the principal causes of a rebellion against Ibn Saud in 1928 was the determination of the tribes of Northern Nejd to raise this embargo, which seriously affected their livelihood. Negotiations are now proceeding, between Saudi Arabia on the one side and Kuwait and Great Britain on the other, for the conclusion of a trade agreement between the former two countries. The conclusion of this agreement will bring about the complete cessation of the Saudi trade blockade of Kuwait. (h) Relations between Kuwait and Iraq were outwardly cordial until 1938. In this year the ratification of the Iraq -Iran treaty produced in the Iraqis a feeling of insecurity as to their position on the Shatt -el -Arab. This directed attention towards Kuwait, which would provide for Iraq a fresh outlet to the Persian Galf-I The Iraq press and broadcasts eornmenced a violent campaign against the Sheikh and claimed Kuwait as part of Iraq. This agitation and propaganda from Iraq reached its greatest heights in March 1939, when the She;kh nart dissolved his council and was nominating a new one. Disturbances occurred in Kuwait and shots were fired when a Kuwaiti, long resident in Basra, arrived and addressed some members of the late council to the effect that the Sheikh was no longer ruler of Kuwait and that his authority should be resisted. The situa tion which arose was only saved by firm action on ths part of the She:kh. The attacks on Kuwait m the Iraq press and broadcasts died down and it is probable that, for a time at any rate, the idea of territorial acqui sition in this area aviII be dropped. Within Kuwait, the movement for union with Iraq has very few sup porters. (o) The friendly telegrams and letters of congratula tion on the firm handling of the situation which the She.kh received from Ibn Saud, the Amir Abdullah of Transjordan, and the rulers of the Persian Gulf States emphasise the solidarity of the rulers of. the Arab States against both Iraqi encroachment anu rapid de mocratic development. 6. British Influence. —His Majesty's Government and the Government of India are reoresented by the Poli tical Agent, an appo ntment created in 1904. The Poli tical Agent is directly responsible to the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf. He is not a consul. He exercises the powers of District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resi dent, he also exercises jurisdiction over British sub jects and protected persons of foreign States other than Muslim Governments. Advice on the internal administration of Kuwait is given by the Political Agent, but questions of foreign policy are dealt with by the Foreign Office in consulta tion with the India Office(5 The Sheikh, on August 30th, 1939, assured His Majesty's Government of his and his peoples' desire to place their services and resources at the d sposai of the Government at any time they may be required. 7. Faces. —The population of Kuwait town which represents practically the entire settled population of the Principality is made up of a large majority of Arabs of the Awazim, Ajman, Mutair, Rashaidah, Beni Klialid, Dawasir, Anizah. Dhafir and other tribes, besides Hasawiyah or Arabs from Hasa. Baharinah from Bahrein, and Nejdis from Nejd. There are also a large number of Persians, some Jana'at. many Negroes, some Jews and a few Indians. 8. Characteristics. —The Arab population of Kuwait w not on the whole of a robust type. They are generally longfaced. slender and inclined to lankiness. The com plexion of many is sickly. The greater part are engag er! in seafaring, fishing and pearl-diving. The Persians a;9 shopkeepers ar.d labourers. Though no census has ever been taken the settled population of Kuwait Prin cipality is believed to be about 70.000 increasing to 8u,000 in the pear] season. There is a small community, about 100 in 1939, of ut.sh and Americans, the majority beinof employees of the Kuwait Oil Company. The only permanently settled villages are Jahra at the head of the Bay, Qasr-es-Sabiva on Khor-es-Sabiya, /or on Failakah island. Dimna and Hawaii in the Qaraiah d strict and the Qusur villages of Fantas, v l ' a ' a ' '■ nu ti'daifah and Shu'aibah along the coast. -None ot these are more than 25 miles in a direct line froni Kuwait.

Tribal Camping Grounds. —The principal camping ground for the tribes when entering Kuwait area are the wells of Wafra, Grain, Tawil and Subaihiyah in the south, Jahra in the west, and those of Shamiyah, and Dasma in the vicinity of Kuwait Town. But wherever there are wells Bedouin may be expected to encamp. These camping grounds are only occupied from May to September, when the scarcity of water in the desert drives the Bedouin to them. In winter no Bedouin encamp ments are found on the wells. Many of them during summer months work as divers with the pearling fleets. 10. Labour available. —Labour is available only in Kuwait Town. The great majority are Persians, but their numbers fluctuate. The water carrying trade from the water boats to the houses is almost entirely in their hands. The normal wage of a labourer averages Rs|^.-8 per day. If organized, there is no reason why they should not work outside Kuwait. 11.

The frontier fiied in 1920-23 between Kuwait and Nejd starts from the junction of the Wadi- al-Aujah with the iiatin in the west j running thence (leaving Riqai to Nejd) in a straight line to the junction ol! tiie 29tii parallel of latitude with the arc of a semi circle having Kuwait as centre and a radius of 42 miles ; thence following the semicircle to a point immediately south of Ras-al-Qaliya. This forms the southern boundary of the recognized territory of Kuwait. The frontier between Kuwait and Iraq starts from the junc tion of Av adi-al-Aujah and the Batin, thence northwards following the^ centre line of the Batin, curving eastwards south of Safwan (leaving Safwan to Iraq), and then south-east to the head of Khor-as-Sabiya ; whence it fohows the northern shore of Khor Abdulla until it reaches a point opposite the eastern end of Warba Island. It then follows the centre of Khor Abdulla to the open sea including the Island of Warba. Bubiyan, Mashtan, I ailaka, Auhah, Kubbar. Qaru and Umm-al-Maradim. r ai.aka only is inhabited ; it has one village called Zoc and a few settlements. The tract of country hounded on the north bv the southern boundary of Kuwait, on the east by the sea, on the south by a straight line running eastwards from the bhaqq through Ain-al-Abd to the sea north of Ras- a ab and on the west by the Shaqq, is recognised as common to the two states of Kuwait and Nejd, until such tune as a fresh agreement be arrived at between them. • T i e I r q neutra] area fTawal Adh Dhafir) is an area in the shape of a parallelogram having its north, south, east and west angles at Al-Amffhar, A1 Uqubba, a point in the vicinity of Ar Rigai, and Ansab. to the ' &lt;1923 Fro ntier Agreement ' the bmkh or Kuwait was the recognised overlord and en- titled to levy tribute over a much larerer area. This area included m the west the line of the Batin to the well8 of10 Hafar inclusive. It then turned south-east and included the wells of Safa, Qar'aa, Haba and Warba ; the village of Anta'a, and joined the sea at Jabal Manifah. By the above agreement this territory was handed over to Ibn Saud, but the Sheikh's family entertain hopes of recovering it when opportunity offers. 2. Sea Littoral. —Kuwait Bay is a large inlet with an extreme length, east and west of 20 miles and a maximum width north and south of 10 miles. 3. Physical Geography.—As a whole the territory of Sheikh of Kuwait is a sterile desert with few oases, devoid of features other than the isolated hills or ridges which break the surface and serve as landmarks. Such hills are Warah, Barqan and Qrain Iving 25, 30 and 40 miles respectively south of Kuwait town, and the triple hills of Minaqish 25 miles to the west of it. The long low ridge of Musanna running north-east by south-west between the Dibdiba and the Batin, east of Hafar, also deserves mention. The only well marked valleys of any size are those of Batin and Shanq. The soil is generally gravel north of Kuwait Bay and in the more southerly districts it is partly sand and partly clay. In winter the country is everywhere passable for ' M. T. and armoured cars, and in summer it is possible to get to fill F IT -T, car - A™* 11111 ™ is almost entirely con t'd the fZ r e of the only oasis of an y size ' negligible.

It starts roughly 70 miles south-west of Hafar and runs north eastwards to within about 37 miles of Basra. Umm-el-Hiran is a small tract lying between the districts of Yah on the east and Shiqqat on the west and is in the north-west corner of the principality. It is about 8 miles across and is situated about 25 miles north west of Jahra. Al-Ahatah. —East of Shiqaq and south of Safwan in Iraq. An undulatinc: waterless desert with many dry water-courses. Tah. —A barren tract between Jahra and Batin tra versed from north-east to south-west by the ridge Jal-el- Yah, 50 feet high and half a mile broad. Qira'a-al-Marru. —A waterless ridge 6 miles broad north of Jahra. It has some camel grazing. Zaqlah. —A small basin-shaped tract between Jahra and Qira'a-al-Marru with grazing for camels. Zor. —Chiefly a range of hills on north side of Kuwait Bay, running north-east and south-west passing 3 miles north of Jahra. A small valley called Jauf-el-Mutla drains into the plain of Sif between the range and the Bay. This plain contains numerous wells. Near the eastern end of the range are the wells of Mudaira. Qara'ah. —A barren sandy tract bounded on the north by Kuwait Bay, on the east by the sea, on the south by the district of Adan and on the west by the locality called Kabd. The town of Kuwait lies in this district. Adan. —An elevated sandy plain enclosed between the district of Qara'ah on the north, that of Shaqq on the west, Salu' on the south and the sea on the east. It contains the group of villages known as the Qusur. Oil has been found in this district. Kahd.—A. locality about 25 miles south-west of Kuwait between Qara'ah on the east and Shaqq on the west. It is a belt of hieb eround running east and west over a distance of 6 miles.12 Shaqq. —A long and very shallow valley about 100 miles long, which for the northern 20 to 40 miles lies within Kuwait territory. In the north it ends about 20 miles north-west of Jahra ; in the south in the neighbourhood of Wariya ; on the east it is bounded by Kabd and Adan, on the west by Dibdibah. Shaqq yields a good deal of the grass and firewood sold in Kuwait town. 5. Towns and large Villages. Kuwait town. —Capital of the principality. Extends for about 3^ miles along the shore. Its greatest depth is 2 miles. The town has no regular plan. The streets are irregular and winding though many are passable for M. T. The bazaar and market place are south of the town on the edge of the desert. A mud wall .15 feet high encircles the town on the and side. It has 3 gates and towers at regular intends of 200 yards. Its total length is over 4 Siles. wal, f a 1 nd tower s are loopholed- for rifle fire and in some parts there is a fire step.

A line of wells 1 mile south-west of the town and another line south-east of the town supply water of in different quality to the Bedouins who camp round them in large numbers during the summer. The main water supply for the town is brought in wooden tanks by local sailing craft from the Shatt-al-Arab at Fao. There are no palms or cultivation in or near Kuwait. The high ground of Qasr-es-Sirrah or Mishrif 6 miles south-east of Kuwait is a good observation point. There is a ruined fort on the top of it. The Oil Cbmpanys water pumping station is at Shuwaik, 2^ miles west of the town. The Company has con structed a quay here, and water is landed from lighters and pumped through a pipe line to Maqwa. Jahra. —A large village at the foot of Kuwait Bay 20 miles by road west of Kuwait. It is a place of great importance from a strategical point of view. Besides being on the routes to Basra and Nejd its wells are the last before the waterless belt to the south-west is reached. It is an important camping ground and watering place of the Bedouin and a centre for Nejd and desert news. Its occupation is essential for the security of Kuwait town and the Kuwait-Basra road. Maqwa. —Lies 12 miles south of Kuwait, directly between it and Burgan, is the camp for the personnel of the Oil Company. The personnel are accommodated in huts the number of which it is proposed to increase. Maqwa is in open desert and only a few water wells exist in the vicinity. The Company, however, proposes to erect water storag'e for 60,000 gallons ; this will make Maqwa as strategically important as Jahra, and an ex cellent base for operations in the event of an emer gency. Burgan. —Thirty miles south of Kuwait and about twelve miles inland, is the centre of the oil wells area. In January 1939, there were two completed and sealed wells and a third in process of drilling ; there were no14 oil pipes connected up. Water is obtained by pipe from Shuwaikh and from the wells of Subaihiya. 6. Hospitals. —There is a Government of India Free Dispensary, and also a free dispensary maintained bv a rich notable. A State ' Cottage Hospital ' is proposed. Plans are now under way (March 1939). There is an American Mission Hospital where Europeans can be treated • it has an operating theatre. 7. Education.

In winter, especially when a Shimal wind is blowing it is sometimes bitterly cold. In summer the heat of the sun is tempered by sea breezes and the sandy desert around cools down rapidly at night. The Barih wind blows for 40 days from the north-west by west from the beginning of June. Coming over the bay of Kuwait it carries clouds of dust but reduces the temperature very considerably. The cool months are from November to March and the hot months from April to October. The rainfall occurs in the spring and winter. The average yearly rainfall is 4.8 inches. Good winter rains ensure the supply of water in tha desert wells during summer. They also ensure abundant pasture in spring and incidentally increase the range and frequency of Bedouin raids.

(2) Ear diseases. (3) Skin diseases. (4) Tuberculosis. (5) Digestive diseases. (6) Venereal diseases. Tn order of incidence. Epidemics. —There have been no epidemics of Cholera or Plague for many years. Small-pox is endemic all the year round. The town being walled lends itself to strict quarantine supervision, the regulations of which are governed by the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926. Insects. — A very few sandflies and mosquitoes appear in the Spring and Summer ; the latter are mostly of the non- malarial type though a few ^ases of malaria have been found during the last 3 years, in persons who have never left fhe town. Flies are troublesome during the Spring and Autumn months only. No mosquito nets are necessary. Quarantine. The quarantine service for Kuwait, Bahrein and Muscat is under the direction of the Political i en s at those places and the agency surgeon at each place acts as quarantine medical officer..14 27 CHAPTER III. Communications. . !• telegraph and Wireless. —There is a single telegraph line from the post office in Kuwait town to Basra. It can be cut at any point. There is no cable communication. Cable and Wireless, Ltd., are proposing- to erect a wireless station, which may be completed by the end of 1940. In the meantime the Royal Air Force have estab lished a wireless station in the Agency building as a tem porary measure. The Kuwait Oil Company possess two Marconi Portable Type E.-3 sets foj local communication. Details are :— Place. Kuwait Maqwa Call Sign. V. T. M. V. T.

Air Communications. —Imperial Airways have an agreement with the Shaikh, for the use of the harbour near Shuwaikh as an emergency alighting area and anchorage, but it is not used as a regular halting place, on their route to India. This is the most suitable anchorage as it is well sheltered from the winds. The Royal Air Force landing ground, 950 by 650 yards is to the^east of Kuwait, just outside the wall of the town. It has a circle and corner markings and a fuel and oil store is maintained. R. A. F. unmarked emergency landing grounds exist at A1 Jahra and Subaihiya, just south-west of the oil wells area. A landing ground could be constructed fairly easily a mile south of Maqwa Camp. The state of the country is such that many natural landing grounds exist all over the state especially in the west, north and south-west. Grani. —A good landing ground.

Numerous sailing boats are available for landing troops and animals, but it would be necessary to construct some sort of a jetty or ramp for the landing of guns and M. T. vehicles. Lighters could best be used for landing purposes. There is however, a masonry ramp, running into deep water and originally built by the navy. This ramp could be utilised for the construction of a jetty. Beaching is simple and easy at this point. The fore-shore is sandy, but would not seriously hamper movement. The best place for landing troops is Bandar-esh-Shuwaikh, a narrow basin about two miles west of the town, formed by the mainland and islet of Qrain. Here there is a deep sheltered channel, where native craft may anchor in three to four fathoms of water within fifty yards of the shore. This part of the harbour has good holding ground and reasonable protection from the Shamal (strong north-west wind) ; when a jetty is built, ships of about 22 ft. draught could be berthed at all states of the tide. Any hi^h wind interferes with landing operations at Kuwait itself, but Shuwaikh is entirely sheltered from the wind. The Kuwait Oil Company have commenced work (July 1939) on a jetty on the foreshore at Shuwaikh, it is expected to be completed by the spring of 1940 and will consider ably improve landing conditions here. The jetty will be 540 ft. long, 16 ft. wide, with an L. head 40 ft. long. The shore end for 400 ft. will be of concrete and the remainder of steel pile construction. The seaward end will be approximately 100 ft. beyond low water spring tide mark. With the assistance of the company, facilities can be provided for the landing of weights up to 15 tons. In March 1938, the S. S. Traqqi, with stores for the Company, was brought alongside at Shuwaikh and un loaded direct over a barge at the end of a short quay. There was 21 ft. of water beneath her. rjfl} m wiisa*-6. Boats available. —About 700 pearling dhows of al] sizes, of which a few are fitted with engines. f 6 n 0 nn'.

About 12 motor boats, seating capacity 20.31 CHAPTER IV. Resources. . ^ (iter Supply. The question of water is the most important factor that will affect military operations in Kuwait, as the state is almost entirely desert. There is no running water in the whole area, but there are numerous shallow wells. The extent of water available varies in summer and winter. In winter, water collects after rain in hollows and remains for several months. Wells in some cases over flow. In summer, water is confined to the wells ; many of these are brackish and a number dry up. The town of Kuwait, as already stated, obtains its water Irom two lines of wells south-west and south-east of the town, but th. water is of indifferent quality and Bedouins camp round the wells in large numbers during the summer. Therefore, the town mainly relies on water brought by specially fitted local sailing craft from the Shatt-al-Arab at a0- 40 craft are always employed in water carrying. On an average 6 such boats arrive daily and bring approxi mately 35,000 gallons of water. If local craft are em ployed medical supervision would be necessary. 2. Camping Grounds. —The following is a list of suit able camping grounds. This table and the table in Chapter JI show the normal state of water supply, but as m the summer the yield of good water is dependent on the extent of rainfall in the winter, the information can only be approximate. In every case it would be safer to depend on local and up-to-date information as to the state of the water supply in areas where operations are under consideration.3. Oil. —In January 1934, the Kuwait Oil Company wai formed by agreement between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the American Gulf Oil Company. The control of the Company is on a fifty per cent, basis, but by the terms of the agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company British control is ensured. This is satisfactory as the oilfields in Kuwait are strategi cally well-placed in that naval dispositions to protect the present source of supply in south Iran would in a large measure afford protection to sources of supply in Kuwait. Further, Kuwait would be a convenient alternative requir ing little diversion of shipping or change in protective dis positions should the A. I. 0. C. output from Abadan be interrupted. Early in 1935, the Sheikh granted a concession to the Company which covered the whole of Kuwait territory. Drilling was first commenced in May 1936, at Bahra, on the northern shore of Kuwait Bay, but this was abandoned after drilling had been carried without results to an approximate depth of 8,000 feet. A second well was com menced at Burgan, 30 miles south of Kuwait, in October 1937, and oil was struck in February, both the quality and pressure being good. The present situation (Septem ber, 1939), is that there are, in the Burgan area, two com pleted and sealed wells, and a third well, in process of drilling, has just struck oil. Prospects for oil development are, therefore, definitely good. There is as yet no refinery or oil pipe laid, but the Company are proceeding with the building of a jetty at Shuwaikh, on the coast 2 J miles west of Kuwait town, where there is already a water pumping station. Other developments of the Company are the Oil Personnel Camp at Maqwa, twelve miles south of Kuwait, and buildings in the town, at both of which the accommodation is to be increased. At Maqwa it is intended to construct a ' Service Unit ; this is a small self-contained rectangular fort in which reserve supplies are held and where the personnel can concentrate in emergency, similar establishments are to be found at the oil pumping stations on the pipe line from Kirkuk to Haifa.35 Water for Maqwa is pumped through a pipe line from Shuwaikh, and it is intended to erect storage tanks there. The oil wells at Burgan obtain their water from the wells of Subaihiya. 4. Supplies. —Agriculture in this principality is almost entirely confined to the village of Jahra and, to an increas ing extent, to the Qusur villages south-east of Kuwait. The products however are insignificant, consisting only of a limited supply of vegetables, and a little lucerne at Jahra. All other supplies have to be augmented from abroad principally Basrah and the Persian ports. Rice is brought from India. Wheat, barley and bhoosa from Per sian ports. The principal imports are sugar, rice, cotfee and cotton piece-goods. India supplies the majority of these articles except sugar, which comes mainly from Java. Kuwait's chief export is pearls, the bulk going to India. Pearling and fishing are the chief industries, but the majority of fish caught is consumed locally, only a small proportion being exported to Iraq. In summer a force landing in Kuwait could not depend on any local supplies. In winter, however, about 2,000 sheep per week should be available. 5. Fuel. —Firewood from India. Camel dung (jella) is used as fuel by the very poor to supplement the supply of brushwood which comes in from the surrounding desert. 6. Boat building. —It is claimed for Kuwait that the finest boats in the Gulf are built there. They are almost entirely of the Bum or ' Sambuq' type with pointed and square sterns respectively, and vary in capacitv from 50—300 tons. 7.. Accommodation. —No suitable accommodation exists in the town of Kuwait. The Agency could accommodate a small party, and in this area is probably the best camping site, close to drinking and washing water supplies.36 OH AFTER V. A rmed F orces. J. General. —A tabulated statement of the Armed Forces of the Sheikh of Kuwait is given below : The policy was laid down in 1929 that the Royal Air Force based on Iraq, would come to the assistance of Kuwait if she were in danger of serious attack by strong organized forces from Nejd ; but that for deal ing with ordinary raids, large or small, and for patrolling her frontier, she would have to depend on her own resources. For this purpose it was decided that a small highly mobile force of armed Ford cars would be the only satis factory method of dealing with the problem. 2- The Sheikh's Forces. —Approximately 150 men armed with .303 rifles ; these could be made mobile by the commandeering of cars and lorries in Kuwait town. 6 Lewis Guns mounted on trucks. Trucks are 3—1935 30 h. p. 2-ton Fords. 3—1939 6 cylinder 2-ton Chevrolets, Each truck is armed with one Lewis Gun, in good condition, mounted to fire forward, and carries 2 gunners and 10 men armed with rifles. There are also about 80 armed police. S. Value of the Force. —The troops are efficient from an Arab standard and would give a good account of them selves in any fight under Arab conditions. Care should be taken to ensure that the national characteristics of . in dividuality ' and '' initiative ' are not destroyed in attempting to improve the efficiency. In training operations with the Royal Air Force, they have shown great initiative and keenness, but discipline has b6 eD practically non-existent. 4 Training. In 1938 a flight of the Royal Air Force and a section of the Armoured Car Company in Iraq visited Kuwait for three days. They carried out tactical37 exercises, demonstrations and an inspection of the Kuwait force as well as giving instruction in the work of armecf cars. A British Warrant Officer Instructor also visited Kuwait for three weeks in order to give instruction in weapon training. These visits were extremely popular in Kuwait, the forces showing a keen interest in everything. This aid to their training is to be held as often as opportunity occurs, and will undoubtedly increase their efficiency. The Sheikh holds a private stock of .303 rifles and about 250,000 rounds of S. A. A, in reserve. 5. Irregulars. —(a) Tribes owing allegiance to the Sheikh. These are made up of those loose Bedouin elements whose interests directly connect them with Kuwait. In summer many of them join the pearling fleets as divers. They can muster about 1,000 rifles of various types. (6) Town defence force. Probably about 6,000 able-bodied men and boys of Kuwait town, armed with a variety of rifles and guns. Their duties are to man the town wall and their efficiency would be low except in purely passive defence. The town wall, when repaired, and if adequately manned, would be a formidable obstacle to tribal raiders. 6. Auxiliary Force. —The number of British and American personnel has increased with the development of the Kuwait Oil Company. It is proposed to store 4 light automatics, 50 rifles and 10,000 rounds of S. A. A. for issue in emergency. Instructions in the use of these weapons is to be carried out during visits of British instructors. 'ill - mHM 38 SECTION B. BAHREIN. CHAPTER I. History, Administration and P opulation. 1. General. Bahrein is the most prosperous and pro gressive of the Sheikdoms in the Persian Gulf. At first, the country enjoyed prosperity due to the pearl trade, and then, when this trade declined considerably, there was an immense increase in revenue due to the development of the oil fields. Apart from Bahrein's controlling position in the Persian • u ' developments in recent years have increased her importance to Great Britain. These developments include is tw. u fields and refinery ; the fact that Bahrein Kfltv i f- Persian Gulf division of the Royal air miitp f a n £ S ro u n d and anchorage on the Empire Air PnrV% ? 5 t e ac( l uisiti on of land by the Royal Nation a r d barracks and Proposal to wa selects J' fl ^ ht . there 5 a nd the fact that Bahrein if 1 shoul A TI Slte of the Persian Gulf Mdency u it snould be moved from Bushire. refn TTvZl' considering general history of Bah- about deb tors p f back t0 the y ear a-d. islands by the Persians 0r guese were 'Pelled from these duration P bm a 'b(mi'' ,1 lTl« 0 ?i, 'L P,a,lr ' ?in is of nnccrtam establishing their Dnw, +h useat Ar abs succeeded in 18th Century the Mh f Abo,lt the middle o£ tlM in Bah«in-heVd%le^ a ; ah i rabs - still «P res ^ power decreased as a result of ' f bufc aS for a short period internal feuds the islands Bahrein hL 1 Came Under Persian ^ule. Company as early Ts ^ 0tlee of the East lDdia y as lf&gt;13 ' b ut proposals to establish t39 .?o representative there were abandoned, in 1763, in favour of Bushire. In 1783 the Persians, who were in possession, were expelled by an Arab horde from the mainland led by Sheikh Ahmad ul Khalifah of the 'Utub tribe, and his descend ants have held the ruling power ever since. From this time onward the history of Bahrein is a tale of protracted hostilities with Muscat, the Trucial Chiefs, and her neighbours on the promontory of Qatar. From time to time the Persians have made abortive attempts to recover the islands. Strenuous efforts have also been made by the 'Wahabis to gain possession of the State, which indeed, for a short period, they actually controlled. The Ottoman Government, in pursuance of its policy of extending Turkish influence in the Gulf, interfered in the affairs • of the State. Meanwhile, misrule and piracy on the part of the Sheikhs of Bahrein, and dissensions among the various members of the Sheikh's family, weakened its power. British influence in the islands gradually increased, Treaties were entered into with the Sheikhs of Bahrein extending that influence, and it was finally consolidated by an agreement signed in 1892. 3. lieloticns with neighbours. — (a) The Turkish claim to sovereignty over the Bahrein Islands, put forward from time to time since 1847 and as often denied by His Majesty's Government, was finally renounced by Article 13 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. This instrument however was unratified at the out break of war in 1914, and has not since* been revived. (6) The claims of Iran to sovereignty over the islands have persisted over a longer term of years and have been as constantly repudiated by His Majesty's Government. Iranian interest in Bahrein became more pronounced when the discovery of oil suggested a potential source of revenue. In 1934, the Iranian Government sent a note to the United States to the effect that they did not recognise the validity of an oil concession granted by any one other than themselves, since they regarded Bahrein as an integral Sis40 part of Iran. Similar notes were sent to London and Geneva. His Majesty's Government have repeatedly stated, it is clearly shown on historical grounds, there is no justification for the claim. At no period, since the middle of the 18th century, has Iran had effective control of, or exercised any influence in, the islands. Since the improvement in Anglo-Iranian relations in 1935, the question of Bahrein has been raised only as a matter for friendly settlement at some future date. (c) Ibn Saud's contact with Bahrein commenced with his capture of Hasa from the Turks in 1913. By the Treaty of Jedda, 1927, he undertook 'to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of Bahrein ' an undertaking which has been f ulfill The only danger to Bahrein from Ibn Saud is that, in the event of the disappearance of British influence from the Gulf, he would probably step in to prevent the absorption by any other Power. The good relations that now exist between the two States is borne out by recent visits of their rulers. The Amir Saud, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, visited Bahrein in 1937, when he received a handsome reception. This hospitality was returned in full by Ibn Saud in the tollowmg year on the occasion of the Sheikh of Bahrein's visit to Mecca for the pilgrimage. In May 1939, Ibn fcained^ a ® a hrein and was lavishly enter- n S d l The Sheikh of Bahrein's relations with the Trucial Chiefs are friendly, and have been so for the last 90 years, eXCe ? ti0n t0 . this is Q atar » where the Sheikh ha« nenlnt^T T? )Ve n r r ei ? nty 0Ver Zubarah district of the Qatar claim anrl ^ ^^l €St ?

This situation still (1939) remains. 4. Administration. —The present Sheikh is Sheikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., who succeeded his father, Sheikh Isban Ali in 1933. The principality is an independent Arab State, under the protection of His Majesty's Government, but not a British Protectorate. The internal administration is conducted by the Sheikh, assisted by an Adviser to the Government, a Director of Customs and a State Engineer, all British subjects. In 1938, an outbreak of agitation occurred amongst the younger educated classes, who formed a Youth Movement, and amongst Bahreini employees of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The former demanded a more democratic form of government, including an elected council and the reform of the law courts ; the latter better labour con ditions. Some demonstrations occurred which the police were able to suppress without any casualties. The Sheikh refused to set up a council, but agreed to the reform of the law courts. The pay of the employees was raised and a representative appointed as liaison officer between the Company and the Government. 5. British Influence. —Treaties and Agreements were made with the Sheikhs of Bahrein in the years 1820, 1861, 1880, 1892, 1898, 1911 and 1914. The last 25 years has seen the consolidation of British influence in Bahrein and the establishment of a de facto control over the Islands, but the policy followed is that of encouraging in every way the autonomy of the Sheikh, and interference is only resorted to in eases of obvious necessity. His Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India are represented in Bahrein by a Political Agent, directly subordinate to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Political Agent exercises full jurisdiction in respect of British and all foreign subjects resident in Bahrein having powers of a Sessions Judge. The Sheikh is precluded from granting concessions for oil42 or for pearl fishing save with the approval of His Majesty 's Government and his foreign policy, and relations with his neighbours are shaped entirely by His Majesty 's Govem- tneni. There is also an Assistant Political Agent, and a Royal Air Force officer was appointed in 1937 as an Air Liaison Officer. Bahrein has been selected as the new location for the headquarters of the Resident in the Persian Gulf if it should be moved from Bushire. On the outbreak of war in 1914, Sheikh Isa Bin Ali ul Khalifa loyally observed his agreement with His Majesty's Government and offered his assistance. Since the war the relations between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh have remained friendly. Ihe Sheikh visited India in 1939 and took the opportunity to assure the \ iceroy of his and his people's desire to place their services at the disposal of His Majesty's Govern ment at any time they may be required. In September 19.)9, the Sheikh repeated this assurance, emphasising his friendship with Great Britain and making a gift of £30,000 to His Majesty s Government towards the costs of war. 6. Ixaces.

They come trom Persian ports, notably Lingah.22, 43 7. Characteristics. —The population of Bahrein has been estimated at 120,000. Of this number Manama and its environs account for 40,000 ; Muharraq and Hidd for 30,000 ; while the villages account for the remaining 50,000. The inhabitants of the villages are chiefly Baharinah, Shiah, and form 2j3 of the rural population. They are mainly agricultural, but also depend though to a less extent, than their Sunni brethren, on pearl diving and other seafaring occupations. As a class their condition approximates closely to that of serfdom. The population of the towns of Manama and Muharraq is unusually mixed, being composed of Sunni Arabs, Shia Arabs, Sunni Per sians and Shia Persians, Negroes and Indians. The Persian is the largest foreign community and they are believed to number about 15,000. The Negroes number about 5,000. There are about 1,000 British Indians, apart from employees in the Oil Company, who are principally located in Manama and Muharraq. The Bahrein Petroleum Company has some 5,000 employees ; 300 British and 100 American personnel are in the oil fields, with about 500 British Indians. The remainder are local inhabitants. There is an important colony of natives of Hasa and Nejd, and a few Basra Arabs and Jews. For about half the year there is an influx of foreigners who come for the pearl diving. Pearl divers come from most of the Gulf ports, the largest contingent coming from Oman. The numbers thus coming to Bahrein in the diving eeason may amount to 12,000. The Sheikh of Bahrein and the bulk of the population are pro-British and contented. But in Manama and Muharraq towns there are a number of ' foreigners Indians, Persians and other Arabs. These might take aB interest in political matters and attempt to organize raids, earry out sabotage in the oil fields, or stir up labour troubles, particularly among the Oil Company's employees. 8. Tribes. —The most important tribes or classes of Bahrein are given in the following table. It must bt46 CHAPTER II. G eography, C limate and H ealth, 1. General Description. —The Sheikhdom of Bahrein consists of the archipelago formed by the islands of Manama, Muharraq, Umm-Na'san, Sitrah and Nebi Sala, with a number of lesser islets and rocks. The whole forms a compact group almost in the middle of the bight which separates the promontory of Qatar and the main- land of Hasa. • i Th f m °f t , strikin g feature of the Bahrein group of islands is the low-lymg and flat featureless nature of the • nd and the shallowness of the surrounding sea, which is a mass of reefs, partially dry at low water Manama? 8 ^ f0Und in 0pen ^ eSert 14 miles soutil of eas 2 t T/Siirf isIand lies mtst r oTTnSeVi t 76T, ted by a ^ « with several groups of dni mi A ' low and sand y which runs a h , palms.

On this plateau is the only hill on the island, Jebel Dukhan 440 feet in height. The plateau is stony and surrounded by a sandy plain which extends in all directions to the coast draining generally from west to east. On the north side of the plateau is a wide field of ancient tumuli covering about 12 square miles called by the Arabs Muraqib. A large inlet, Khor-el-Kabb, runs into the east side of the island penetrating nearly to the centre. ai With the exception of the central plateau the northern half of the island is covered with extensive date planta- k tions while the southern half is sandy and barren. 3. Principal Towns. —Manama and Muharraq are the principal towns and there are about 100 villages in the islands. Manama. —The political and commercial capital and port ; extends for 1+ miles along the coast in the north east corner of the island and has a depth of about half a mile. The increased prosperity of Bahrein which resulted from the finding of oil has led to the modernization of Manama. In recent years much important work on roads, buildings, drainage system and water supply has been carried out. There are many fine, large buildings situated along the sea front and there is a large and flourishing bazaar. Good drinking water is obtained from numerous artesian wells. On the northern shores are found the new customs house, warehouses, piers and government establishments. The Shaikh's town palace is situated on the south-west outskirts of the town.48 In the extreme north-east comer of the town a causeway stretches out to the town of Muharraq. It is anticipated thdt by the enci of 1939^ the §rap of 130 yards which exists in the causeway will be reduced in width and spanned by a swing bridge. When this is done, the two towns will be only ten minutes apart by motor and will be virtually one. Muharraq. On the adjoining island, and about the same size as Manama, is the second town of the princi pality. It too has been modernized and the electric lighting from Manama has been extended to Muharraq. . 4. Important Places. The following are the main pointe in and around Manama which are of strategical import ance, apart from the Bahrein Petroleum Company's areas described in the next section. The Political Agency is situated on the sea front in the town, 200 yards from the end of the causeway. It is surrounded by a wall. The Power Station lies between the Agency and the causeway. The plant consists of two generating sets, tn^ iLVi ^ P ' oil - driven engine, direct coupled to a 100 kilowatt generator. a een ^ r 1 a ^ P 0 ^ ee station in Manama town, with :r e ^ ele P hon e exchange immediately adjacent to it, and the Eastern Bank within one hundred yards.

It is in open desert, surrounded by o?o d A ire and a circular road. Some 300 Europeans anct ^,000 natives are employed here. The personnel camp area is at Awali, five miles inland from the refinery, and directly between it and the oil wells. It is situated in open desert twelve miles south of Manama from which a good road runs. It covers an area oi about one square mile, surrounded by a light barbed wire fence. Accommodation here is excellent, with air- cooled houses and a very fine air-conditioned hospital. The water supply for the whole oil fields area comes from the water wells at Zellaq, on the west eoast of the LS176CGS(P)50 island, about 5 miles west of Awali Camp. The water is pumped from the wells, which are cemented in, to a reservoir tank between the oil wells and Awali, 6. Hospitals. —The Victoria Memorial Hospital is attached to the Political Agency and is in charge of the agency surgeon, an assistant surgeon of the I. M. D. who also acts as Quarantine Medical Officer for the Bahrein Government. It has an outdoor and indoor department and has ten beds for men and two beds for women. It is not suitable for Europeans. It is non-dieting. The Mason Memorial Hospital (for men) and the Women's Hospital are supported by the American Mission, who maintain a staff of three qualified American doctors. The surgeon in charge is able to perform any major operation not requiring a specialist, but he is not always present at Bahrein. It maintains an in and an out department, and has 45 beds in the men's hospital and 25 beds in the women's hospital. A limited number of Europeans can be accommodated. Both the above hospitals are in Manama. At Awali, the Oil Company's personnel camp, there is a very fine air-conditioned hospital maintained by the company for their employees and families. Two doctors are available. It can accommodate about twenty, has modem equipment, operating theatre and an X-ray plant.58 8, Climate. —The atmosphere of Bahrein, owing to the proximity of the sea on all sides and abundant irrigation, is damp and heavy. In January and February north winds blow and fires are necessary in houses. Though the weather is hot from the beginning of May to the middle of June, the heat is tempered by the sea breeze and the nights are fairly cool. The oppressively hot weather lasts from the middle of July to the end of September. In this period, though there may be irregular land breezes, the thermometer remains persistently above 95° F. All rams fall between November and May but actual wet days are few. The prevailing wind is the Shamal, or north-west wind. om the second week in June it blows for 40 days consecutively and is then called the Bariha. It is very violent in winter. On 33 per cent, of the days of the year the wind is north-west. On 20 per cent, of the days of the year the wind is west. And on 17 per cent, of the , ys !■! . e y ear the wind is north. For the remaining days the winds and breezes are variable. „ ' ias _ highest average annual relative any P^ ace Persian Gulf, The maximum Humidity, however, occurs in winter.

Communications. 1. Telephone and Cable. —There is a general telephone service over a large part of Bahrein island. The ex change is situated in the town of Manama, immediate ly adjacent to the central police station. There is one cable to Bushire, joining there with the England-India cable. 2. Wireless. —Cable and Wireless, Ltd., maintain the wireless transmitting and cable station on the sea coast, south-east of the town, and the wireless receiv ing and direction finding station, situated li miles inland to the south of the town. The following are details of the WjT Stations — Gall Sign. Frequencies. Aerial. Power. Eemarks. VTE 500,425,410,375,333 750 Local communi cations. Air and ship D/F. TTE 5945 500 Local communi cation.

Flying boats and aircraft of the Royal Air Force pay frequent visits to the islands. The R. A. F. aerodrome is situated on Muharraq island, one mile north of the town. It is an area of62 hard sand, 1,000 by 1 ,000 yards, and fully marked. Imperial Airways land planes also use this aerodrome. There is a fuel and oil store and a rest house by the aerodrome. Further land has been acquired on the eastern boundary of the aerodrome and the R. A. J 1 , are building barracks here. It is probable that a flight will be stationed on the island. An old R. A. F. landing ground exists south of Manama on Bahrein island. It is not now used and has no markings. The flatness of the island would allow aircraft to land in many places in an emer gency. The R. A. F. and Imperial Airways flying boat anchor ages, marked by buoys, are on the Khor Kaliya, oue mile to the south-east of Manama, opposite the R. A. F. rest house and pier. There is a petrol and oil store by the rest house. An anchorage for smaller craft exists at Khor Lupm, an inlet to the south of the town. 4. Sea Communications. —Communications between Bah- lein and Muharraq and neighbouring ports of the main land is by motor launch and by local sailing craft. Numerous launches and sailing boats ply regularly for hire. In 1934 there were the following :— 61 motor launches and dhows, average size about 15 tons, ranging from 10 to 70 H. P., the majority fitted with 20 H. P. Kelvin engines, average passenger-carrying capacity 45. With the increased prosperity of the island in recent years, the number of these launches and motor dhows has probably increased. There are, in addition, a number of private launches owned bv shipping com panies, Imperial Airways, the Oil Company, etc. 430 pearling dhows and 720 sailing dhows of all sizes, varying from 2% to 300 tons. The number of pearl ing dhows available fluctuates according to the time of42 63 year and the pearling trade. At least 100 dhows would be available at any given time. 2 iron barges of 30 and 20 shipping tons, the property of the B. I. S. N. Company. Imperial • Airways seaplane tenders. Steamers of the B. I, S. N. Company call weekly at Manama on their passage up and down the Gulf. The Strick and Ellerman City lines make frequent calls. Hansa line calls once a month, and regular calls are made by the Japanese Mitsui and Yamashita lines. The timings by motor launch to the principal ports on the mainland are given below :— Bahrein to Oqair 6 hours. Bahrein to Qatif 5-6 hours. Bahrein to Jubail 9-10 hours. Bahrein to Qatar 11-12 hours. Bahrein to Kuwait 37-40 hours. Bahrein to Dibai 40-45 hours. 5. Roads. —There are two kinds of roads, those main tained by the State and those constructed and maintain ed by the Bahrein Petroleum Company. The expan sion of the Company's interests has allowed the Gov ernment to improve the work on its own decreasing number of roads. State roads extend all over the islands, the majority being tracks suitable for motor traffic in fair weather only. The Company have a network of all-weather oiled roads covering the whole oil fields area. In the refinery, roads lead to and round all vital points, and a circular road runs completely round the refinery outside the barbed wire fence. IJoads also run on each side of the oil pipe lines. Consequently, communication is easy, and the area well suited for car patrols. The Company maintains the road across to Sitra island over a light bridge about fifty yards long.04 The following are the most important roads in the island ;— (i) Manama-Jebal Dukhan.—This is the most im portant road in the island. Maintained by the Company, it is fit for motor traffic in all weathers. It passes through the village of Rifa'ash Shaiki and Awali Camp, thence to the oil fields. . (') Manama-Muharrak—Fit for motor traffic in ail weathers^ 32 ft. wide over the causeway which will be about 1,200 yards long when completed. At present there is a gap of about 130 yards to be crossed by boat, but by the end of 1939 it is anticipated the gap will be reduced in width and will be span ned by a swing bridge. (iii) Manama-Budaiya.—Recently constructed all weather road bringing Budaiya 20 minutes by car from Manama. • ^ p ' ans . 0 f Transport. —The main means of transport in Bahrein and Muhharraq islands is by car and motor bus. Motor bus services run from Manama and Muharraq to most of the important villages in the two islands. There are also numerous taxis in Manama. Altogether there are over 200 ears and light lorries in Bahrein, apart from those owned by the Bahrein Pet roleum Company. The Company possess a considerable quantity of mechanized transport cars, light and heavy lorries. Six light lorries are fitted with flood lights^ and are very suitable for car patrol at night. There are, therefore, in the islands a large number of cars and lorries which could be commandeered for transport and patrol work. The big white donkeys of the famous Hasa breed standing 12.1 to 13 hands exist in large numbers. They65 are obtainable at Manama and from the villages on the islands. Manama Villages Total 200 1,400 1,600 will ks There are about 30 donkey carts in Manama. They are 2-wheeled carts drawn by a single donkey. Their capacity is 4 maunds. 7. Port Facilities .—Sloops anchor in Khor Kaliya, where a 500-ton naval oil barge is moored. Khor Kaliya is to the eastward of the northern end of Bahrein island and is enclosed by reefs. The flying boats achorage is also in Khor Kaliya. It is a fairly good and to some extent sheltered anchorage. Steamers anchor in four to five fathoms to the north of the town of Manama. The anchorage is between a shoal and the island, and is sufficiently sheltered to allow ships to lie there in any weather. There is space for a number of ships. A bight in the reefs north-west of the town forms an inner harbour of about a mile in length. This is well protected and suitable for ships of not more than 15 feet draught. During a shamal, a considerable sea gets up in the outer harbour but communication with the shore is seldom completely interrupted. The introduction of motor dhows, fitted with Kelvin engines, has made the land ing of stores considerably easier. Steamers discharge into local craft, which at high water can come alongside the Customs Pier or a pier in front of the Agency, but at low water there is only one foot at the sea end of the former and the latter is dry. Weather permitting, 1,000 tons can be unload ed at the Customs Pier in 24 hours. Cars and light lorries are regularly landed at the pier. The Customs Pier is 728 feet long, has a breadth at the sea end of 141 feet, tapering to 68 feet at the LS176CGS (P)66 shore end. There is a 5-ton hand power crane at the north-east end, and a trolly line is used to clear goods. There is a corrugated iron customs shed of 175 feet by 67 feet on the pier. The main customs shed, a stone building 324 feet by 97 feet, is behind the customs offices, 150 yards inland. The second pier is a stone one, about 450 feet long and 10 feet wide, in front of the Agency. There are three small adjacent basins. No. 1 and No. 2 are 49 feet long and 46 feet wide, pier 43 feet wide. No. 3 is 49 feet long and 128 feet wide. There is a mole 320 feet long, tapering to the head. On the east coast of Sitra island the Bahrein Petro leum Company's Loading Wharf is 3^ miles out to sea in water 40 feet deep. It is a small wharf where the oil pipes discharge into tankers, and is not connected with the land except by the pipes on concrete piers. Therefore, it must be approached by boat. About 3,200 yards south of the Loading Wharf, also on Sitra island, the Company have a pier which is used to unload or load freight from or to lighters. There is a 20-ton derrick available. At Zellaq, about the centre of the west coast of Bahrein island and five miles west of Awali Camp, there is a landing stage used to land crude oil brought in barges from the mainland opposite. There is a practicable landing place at Budaiya, on the north-west corner of the coast, but here boats ■v\ ould have to be beached, and cargo manhandled to the shore. There are no commercial ship-building or engineer ing works, but there are manv boat-building yards and many of the launches in the Gulf are built here. (For ^ details of boats available see under Sea Com munications above.)67 CHAPTER IV. R esources. 1. Water Supply. —Water is plentiful all over the north of the islands from natural springs and artesian wells. In certain cases the yield of some of these wells is diminishing. Certain of them are affected by the stat® of the tides, the quantity at high spring tides increas ing but becoming brackish. In some places fresh water gushes up from shallow reefs under the surface of the sea. List of Artesian Wells in Bahrein. Note.— The capacity of aa Artesian well varies in accordance with :— (a) Its position on the Island; some loca lities giving a greater yield than others. Where wells are isolated the yield is generally good, but not always so. Sburaibab Budaiya Jannusan Raiyah Manama Mnharraq Arad Ras Bisaitin . Dair Samahi . Galali . Hidd .

The quality of water varies as a rule with the distano* the well is away from th« sea. The nearer it is to th» sea the more brackish the water. But this again is not always true.68 The fact that water is so plentiful in the islands hai its disadvantages. The inhabitants believe there will always be an ample supply of water, and consequently indiscriminately drill artesian wells and waste water to an unnecessary degree. The danger of this attitudi is becoming evident from the decline of the static head almost everywhere. The water supply for the oil fields area comes from the wells at Zellaq, whence it is pumped to a reservoir tank on high ground between the oil wells and Awali camp. From the reservoir pipes run to the retinery, Awali camp and all over the oil fields area. There are numerous wells in the oil fields area and, consequently, emergency supplies from local wells could be develop ed should the supply from Zellaq be cut off. 2. Oil. The Standard Oil Company of California secured a prospecting licence from the Sheikh in 1930. Oil was discovered in 1931 and a subsidiary company, the Bahrein Petroleum Company, registered in Canada, was formed to exploit it. In 1934, a lease was conclud- e foi 55 years which covers tAvo -thirds of the main island of Bahrein. The Company met with early success and the output o oil steadily increased. As a result, it was decided to mild a refinery ; this and all other major construc tions were completed by the end of 1937. In 1938, ere were about 60 producing wells and the total out- P u ^ vas 8*297,998 barrels of crude oil. The refinery is capable of dealing w;th 875,000 gallons of crude oil per diem &gt; and there is a storage capacity of 85 million ^I e refiner y a ^ so receives for refining about ' arrels of crude oil a day from the oil fields on e mainland. Refined products exported are petrol, ethyl:zed petrol, kerosene, diesel and fuel oil. It is also hoped that in 1939, 85 Octane Fuel will be pro- need. This fuel can be treated so as to be suitable or modern aircraft in emergenev although not q« ite up to R. A. F. specification. '69 The Bahrein Petroleum Company's concessions con sist of the following :— (i) The Oil Fields Area. —These cover an area of about 12 miles long by 24 miles wide at Jebal Dukhan, some fifteen miles south of Manama. There are approxi mately sixty wells capable of production, the majority about 2,000 feet in depth, but there are four of over 4,000 feet. Crude oil flows in pipe lines from the wells to the five tank battery stations. It is not easy to damage the wells except by dynamite. The most vulnerable ones are the 4,000 feet wells where pressure is greatest. Pipe lines are easily repairable if damaged. The five tank battery stations are scattered over the oil fields, each station dealing with groups of wells. A battery consists of a few small tanks and a pumping plant, and its function is to eliminate the free gas before the oil is delivered at the refinery. Pipes run from the batteries to the refinery. The pumping stations and tanks can be damaged easily, but they are situated in the open desert. The whole oil fields area is covered by a network of all-weather oiled roads. («) The Refinery. —This covers an area of about 1,000 yards square on a bluff two miles inland from Sitra island, near the east coast of Bahrein island. It includes storage tanks, power station, distillation units, crack ing stills, acid plants and numerous other smaller build ings and workshops. In the refinery some 300 Euro peans and 2,000 natives are employed. Pipes carry the refined oil through a terminal on Sitra island to the loading wharf. The refinery has a barbed wire fence all round it and a barbed wire entanglement is to be put up round the face of the bluff. Searchlight platforms have been erected at suitable points and power lines laid to them, so that if searchlights were available they could quick ly be connected up. Cross roads lead to and round all71 (v) Awali Personnel Camp. —The camp lies twelve miles south of Manama and five miles inland from the refinery, directly between the latter and the oil fields. It covers an area of about one square mile. The British and American personnel of the Company live here. At the beginning of 1939 there were 280 British men, 80 American men, 90 wives and 50 children. The camp is composed of modern bungalows with air conditioning, an excellent hospital, ice storage plant, central canteen and a theatre. A light-barbed wire fence surrounds the camp which is in open desert. There is a good road into Manama. (vi) Zellaq. —This is situated on the west coast of Bahrein island about five miles west of Awali camp. Here are the water wells and water pumping station for the whole oil fields area. Water is pumped to a reservoir tank on high ground between the oil wells and Awali camp, and from the reservoir pipes run all over the oilfields area. The pipes, while easy to damage, are easily repairable and ample stocks of spare piping are held. At Zellaq also is a landing stage at which crude oil, brought in barges from the mainland, is landed and pumped to the nearest tank battery station. (vii) Gas Flares—At the tank battery stations and refinery there are continuous flares burning which burn off the poisonous gases. These flares, particularly the main flare at the Refinery, show up for several miles. 3. Pearl Fisheries. —The Pearl fisheries were the most important and flourishing industry, and Bahrein was one of the centres of the world's pearl trade. Exports in a good year being to the value of some two million pounds. The industry then suffered a severe decline, but in 1937 the season showed a great improvement, the percentage of seed and small pearls being much higher. Bahrein is the centre of the industry and the chief market in the Persian Gulf. Over 400 boats are registered in Bahrein for pearling and about 15,000 of the inhabitants gain a living by73 CHAPTEK V. The Armed Forces. 1. General. —In the event of any major attack nn Bahrein by sea or land, reinforcements would have to be sent. The accepted policy is that the local defence forces available at Bahrein must be capable of dealing with tribal attacks and internal security with their own resources. The former is not a very likely eventuality, and the latter would probably take the form of labour troubles, parti cularly among the Oil Company's employees, and attempts to carry out sabotage in the oil fields and at vital points. The Bahrein defence forces are, therefore, now (October, 1939) in a process of organization to enable them to deal with anything but a major emergency. Although to date no appointment has been made, it has id s; been accepted that a Regular Army Adjutant and an X. C. 0. Permanent Staff Instructor should be appointed to the Force. Both also being available for instruction duties at other stations in the Gulf. 2. The Sheikh's Forces. —The Bahrein Police Force consists of 350 Native Police, including about 50 recruits, armed with British Service Rities. The Force is under the command of the British Adviser to the Sheikh. The arrival in 1939 of a British Assistant to the Adviser allows more time to be given to the organization and training of the Force. The Force includes a Camel Section and a Mounted Section (mounted on Arab ponies), both of 18 men. During 1939, 12 V. B. guns were sent to Bahrein, and ■an N., C. 0. instructor in these guns visited the island. Approximately 500 rifles and 2 Verey pistols are held on charge. In January, 1939, the reserve of ammunition was 400,000, but this is being increased to 1,000 ,000 rounds. There is one Native Officer, a local Sheikh who com pleted a Police course in India. It is desirable that there should be an increase of officers, but there is difficulty in providing personnel since outside trained personnel are74 not always suitable. Recently, boys have been taken into the Police straight from school and it is possible that they may develop into potential officers. There is a suitable establishment of Native N. C. Os. 3. Value of the Force. —The Police Force are all enlisted locally, but come from a variety of districts and races. There is quite a fair proportion of Sudanese. They are an efficient force, entirely loyal, and could be counted on in any emergency. Their chief disadvantage is their short age of Native Officers. 4. Training. —A man enlists in the Police Force for 4 years in the first instance and is re-engaged for 2 years at a time. He carries out a 6-moriths' course as a recruit at Headquarters, the police fort south of Manama, and is then transferred to general police duties. Four Indian Army Instructors are attached to the police and police are sent on nine-months' courses to Indian rmy units. In 1939, nine police had completed these courses. An annua] rifle course is fired on an outdoor range, ranges up to 300 yards. A very satisfactory standard is obtained. 5. Natnors. These are armed guards who perform duties enmlar to chowkidars in India. They are armed with old I j rifles. Many have had previous service in the police and they are quite reliable. i T1 ;V nut, nn trniaing, but y ^ prapy w-iw fw !-- O U ''gii—some form' of' training and collected for yhoi'(^-weapon training conraca.-- For f ^ formation of »-kaaL-de£w« A W Ined 1 from the British if jxwsftfe, anTrnvprl' P^ 0nne ' er np lo y e d in the oil^fie^T^sbeen and poiii-nr»Pfi ! n n u ee full y organized, trained vital noints ' f in tiie protection of the Ir atteZL in , tlie ^ f^against local tribal attacks or attempted acts of sabotage.

As, except in a very few cases, all per sonnel are required for work in connection with production, they cannot be taken for whole-time defence duty. They can, however, be employed in shifts. In order therefore, to save personnel, guards of the Police of Natoors are necessary at vital points, and the Auxiliary Force's em ployment will be based on mobile car patrols, combined vith barbed wire fences and searchlights to protect vital areas. No transport is required as the Oil Conapany possess a considerable number of ears and lorries, includ ing six light lorries fitted with flood lights, for patrol work. 7. Intelligence. —The Political Agent is in a position to acquire all the intelligence which would be necessary in normal conditions. The Royal Air Force Liaison Offxcer is present to assist him if his other duties permit.76 SECTION C. HASA. CHAPTER I. General, Administration and Population. 1. General. —This region is bounded on the north by the southern boundary of the Principality of Kuwait and on the south by the northern frontier of Qatar and the desert of Jafura ; on the east by the sea and on the west by the desert of Summan. It is a province in the dominions of Ibn Saud. A long period of taxation reduced the population to desperate straits, and by 1937, the economic condition of Hasa was serious. However, the striking of oil in consi derable quantity in 1938, around Jebal adh Dhahran, and tne intention of the Oil Company to establish a large oil e , as improved the situation. The considerable reve nue from oil may, in fact, radically alter the internal economic situation of Saudi Arabia, whose main source of revenue has hitherto been from the pilgrims. t -''P^^nce of Hasa is that, as a province of the xi n - orn .

AdministTation. The province of Hasa is administered by a Governor appointed by Ibn Saud. The seat of government is at Hofuf in the Hasa Oasis. The coast towns of Jubail, Qatif and Ocjair are governed by representatives of the JSTejd Government and are directly responsible to the Governor of Hasa. 3. Population. —The settled population of Hasa is esti mated at about 100,000 and the nomadic at about 50,000. A synopsis of the population is given in the following table :— Place. Population. Hofuf 30,000 Mubarraz . 8,500 Other settlements 20,000 in the Oasis of Hasa. Jubail 2,000 Qatif . 6,000 u . . Other settlements 5,000 in the Oasis of Qatif. ■ r Remarks. Hofuf is by far the largest town in the dominions of Ibn Saud outside the Hejaz and about half the people are Shiah (called BAHARNA, as they originally emigrated from Bahrein). » The people are mixed Shiah and Sunni Muhamadans. Occupied in agriculture. The people trade with the Bedou in and are fishermen and sailors. Practically all are Baharinah. The principal occupation is agri culture. Occupied in agriculture.78 CHAPTER II. Geography, Cumate and Health. 1. General Discription. —The greater part of Hasa consists of steppe and desert rising westward from a low coast. The stony ridges of the Summan running more or less parallel with the coast of the Gulf intervene between Hasa ana the belt of the Dahana desert which separates it from Nejd. Shallow wells of drinkable water are fairly numerous. The Hasa and Qatif oases in the southern part of the province are the only fertile and well watered tracts in the area. 2. Districts Hasa Oasis. —This is an oasis of great fer- tithty separated from the Gulf at Oqair by over 30 miles of desert. It contains the two large towns of Hofuf and Muba^raz. The mass of the cultivated territory extends or about 12 miles to the east of Hofuf and Mubarraz, but there are detached blocks of cultivation further to the north. The most remarkable physical feature of the Hasa Oasia is the abundance of water in the cultivated area, from a very large number of springs, some of which are hot. Much c • i ! j ? 18 marsh y an d there are two small lakes at i ' i 2 S ileS E - N - E - of Hofuf ' and Birkat mi i eS 1 eas . t of A y un - The springs are the D i lana ' aina ^ e highlands of Nejd passing under T 1 !® oa ?} s extend s for about 30 miles north and south and 21 mdes east and west.

Climate and Health. —Statistics are not available for Hasa but it is probable that the variations of tem perature lie somewhere between those given for Kuwait and Bahrein. The average maximum temperature would then be about 110°F. and the average minimum about 40 o F, the hottest weather occurring in July and August. The cool season falls between November and March. Moisture is increased in the oasis tracts by the amount of surface water used in irrigation. The average rainfall would be about 4 inches, almost the whole being confined to the winter season and to the comparatively few wet days. Qatif has a very bad reputation for malaria, and most of the inhabitants suffer from enlarged spleens. I LS]76CGS(P)msammmassm 82 CHAPTER III. Communications. 1. Air Communications. —There are no R'oyal Air Force or Imperial Airways landing grounds and anchorages in Hasa. The following are areas where landings could be made in an emergency or where landing grounds could possibly be constructed. This list was compiled from observations made in 1932. Buhat Musallamiyah. —Village water waterholes. Sheltered anchorage to north-east of Musallamiyah Island. Water hole to south-east of Musallamiyah Island on the mainland. Jin ah Island. —Village with waterholes. Sheltered anchorage and landing ground south-west of village established by Ibn Saud in 1930. Used by Saudi Air Force. Circle and markings. No fuel available.

The existing routes are really tracks connecting groups of wells as all movement is governed by the location of drinking water. ^ ne d^elopment of the oil company, it is probable that the tracks in the Qatif area have been improved and are fit for light M. T. A motor road runs from Dhahran (the oil fields) to Ras Tanura, via Dammam, Qatif and hafwa. The Oqcdr. I^ofuf route is possible for light M. T. For a detailed report of the routes in Hasa See Part II. 3. Port Facilities.—The three ports of Hasa reading from north to south are Jubail, Qatif and Oqair. All are difficult of access being approached through narrow channels between reefs and shoals. Place. Method of landing. Craft avail able locally. j Notes. /ubaif , At high tide, gooda can be landed at the pier from small boats of 3 ft. draught. 25—30 The harbour is dangerous for vessels drawing over 8 ft. A small stone pier about 100 ft. long exists. Q«tif Goods have to be transhipped into small boats or on to donkeys. 70—80 Boats of over 6 ft. draught cannot reach an inner berth. '84 Place. Method of landing. Craft avail able locally. Notes. Oqair There is a small customs pier which can only be approached by boats drawing less than 4 ft. of water. A few boats trading to Oqair be long cbieflv to B A H REIN. The channel into the bay has depth of 8 ft.: the anchorage outside the port has 4 fathoms of water. The oil company are developing Ras Tanura as their chief port. There are storage tanks and a pier. A loading terminal for the oil is 1,100 yards from the shore and oil is exported at the rate of about 1,500 barrels per day. The channel has been buoyed and facilities for pro viding safe anchorage of shipping are being installed {1939). Kas Tanura is an admirable port for the Oil Company 's purposes, with ample space on the headland for a refinery should the company decide to build one. Whether Ras Tanura will be developed by Ibn Saud into a general port is not certain ; the chief difficulty is the fact that the country between it and Riyadh is not at all suitable for road construction. In the event of it being so developed, l.ne diversion of trade would be a severe loss to Bahrein. The anchorage, westward o.f the point for two miles, appears easy of access for vessels drawing up to eighteen ee . here is ample space for large vessels off the point m an open anchorage. hitTeloj '•iSflii85 CHAPTER IV. R esouces, 1, Water Supply.—WaXer in the coast towns of Jubail, and Oqair is scanty and poor in quality but there is a considerable quantity in the unexplored region rour&gt;d about 'NTa in mid Hasa, according to all re ports. In the oasis of Hofuf water is plentiful and good from gushing springs. The table in Chapter II shows the normal state of the water supply in different areas. 2. Camping Grounds— Place. Position.

Oqair Vicinity of town due west of Customs shed. i battahon Only one well with good water. 3. Oil. In 1933, the Standard Oil Company of Cali- tonua secured a concession from Ibn Saud for an area in the east of Saudi Arabia. The limits of the conces- sion are not dear as the exact area was not disclosed, ihe Cahfornian Arabia Standard Oil Company was formed to exploit the concession. In March, 1938, oil was struck in such quantity that the Company decided develop a large oil field in Hasa. A new agreement was signed in May, 1939, between Ibn Saud and the Company. This gave them a larger area to exploit in86 return for handsome royalties. The California Arabian Standard Oil Company is an entirely American con- eern. There are about 20 wells in the Dhahran area, where oil was first struck at a considerable depth in one well This well is 4,700 feet deep and shut in ; it produces approximately 400 tons a day. Work is progressing with the deepening of the remaining wells. A second area, where oil in commercial quantities has been struck, is Hadriya, which is 15 miles inland, due west of Uiinna Island. As yet (1939), no refinery has been built, but it is possible the Company will build one by Ras Tanura, where they have constructed their depot for permanent export. A pipe line and a motor road run from the Dhahran oil fields to Ras Tanura. There are large storage tanks, and the pipe line has been carried out to sea for about 1,100 yards to a loading terminal. A jetty has also been built at Damman. Until a refinery ii constructed oil for refining is shipped in tank barges to Zellaq, in Bahrein. 4. Supplies. —A force of any size landing in Hasa could not rely on local resources for any supplies what ever, with the exception of a small quantity of fuel. si •87 CHAPTER V. A rmed F orces. 1. General. —These can be considered under three head ings (a) Regulars or Fidawi, (b) Akhwan, (c) Aarab. (a) Regulars—Fidawi. —These receive regular monthly pay, but wear no uniform. They are mostly enlisted from the settled Bedouin rather than the nomads. They are directly under the orders of Ibn Baud's Amirs of Hasa, Riath and Hail. (b) Akhwan. —These represent the armed forces which the tribes can turn out under their Sheikhs. When Ibn Saud wishes to operate in any portion of his vast domaixis, he calls on the local sheikhs to collect their forces. These then act either directly under Ibn Saud or under a specially appointed commander selected by one of the great amirs. (c) Aarab. —These are Arabs more or less professing the Wahabi faith but living in territories outside that of the confederated tribes of the Akhwan. They can generally be relied on to join the Akhwan when operating in or near their areaj when they are usually employed as scouts, patrols, etc. From the above it will be seen that the Fidawi is the only class in which Ibn Saud can always rely for support. The other two-classes will be alfected to a great extent by the political attitude adopted by their sheikhs. 2. Hasa. —The Fidawi in the Hasa area have their headquarters at Hofuf—and provide garrisons at Qatif —Oqair and Jubail. They consist of about 600 men armed with modern rifles. Those of Riath, Qasim and Hail probably do not exceed 1,000 all told. The Akhwan are represented by the fighting men of the Mutair, Awazim, Murrah, Bani Hajir, Bani Khalid, Manasir and Ajman as far as Hasa is concerned. The Mutair can turn out about 3,000 armed men, the Awazim 2,200 and the Ajman 5,000. The rest in lesser propor tion. The Akhwan of Nejd proper consist of the fight ing men of the Ataiba, Shammer, Sbei, Sahool, Qahtan,88 Harb, and other smaller tribes, and can muster probably all told a force of 20,000. 3, Numbers. —Tl;e number of men that can be main- tained in the field depends, in summer, on the water supply, and in winter on supplies other than water. Operations may be considered under the headings of Raids and Protracted Campaigns. In the former, in winter, the maximum available man power can be put in the field : but in the latter the num bers will be considerably reduced owing to difficulties of supply. Other factors affecting the number of men in the field are :— (a) Hereditary feuds between tribes, which neces sitate a considerable portion of the tribal fighting forces being left to protect the home camps, herds, and grazinj;. i (^) ^ A 1 nb dislike to leaving his family for any considerable period. This would cause many to leave the field and return home 4.

General- —The Sheikh of Qatar became one of the Sheikhs of the Trucial Oman in 1916, when he entered into treaty relations with Great Britain, but it is more convenient to treat the Sheikhdom separately in this report. The importance of Qatar lies in the possibility of oil being found in commercial quantities and its consequent development, which might make Qatar a source of Empire oil supply. Unlike Bahrein, the oil company operating in Qatar is under British influence, and the concession contains a pre-emptive clause in favour of His Majesty's Government. The necessity to defend Qatar might arise from the guarantee given in 1934 to the Sheikh granting him protection from landward aggression, in addition to the promise of 1916 to protect his State from aggression by sea, and the desirability of maintaining the Royal Air Force landing ground and petrol store. The oil situation (September, 1939) is that geological survey work has been carried out and deep drilling ope rations were commenced in the winter of 1938. in October 1939, there was a small show of oil in the test well. 2. History. —In 1909 the important tribe of the A1 Bu Ainain emigrated from Wakrah to Qasr al Subai near Qatif as a result of enhanced dues levied on their pearl ing boats. On the 17th July 1913 the veteran Sheikh Jasim bin Muhammad al Thani died and was succeeded by his son Abdullah bin Jasim al Thani who had been his right hand man for many years past, his peaceful accession being no doubt due to this fact. In 1915, the Turks abandoned Doha, leaving 3 guns, 500 shells and 105,000 rounds of ammunition-• They had occupied Qatar since, 1871, but their claim was never90 recognised by His Majesty's Government and in 1914 was renounced. On the Sra* November, 1916, the Sheikh entered into a new treaty with His Majesty's Government, and the Sheikhdom was added to the number of the Trucial States. 3. Relations with neighbours. —(a) Although Ibn Sand litis no claim over Qatar, the Wahabis only occupying it tor a few years early in the 19th century, the Sheikh of Qatar is concerned regarding the possibility of an invasion from Saudi Arabia. This is due to two factors : first, the influence of Ibn Saud over the migrating Bedouins who are largely accustomed to make the interior ot Qatar their habitat ; and, second, the fact that the question of the boundary with Hasa has never been settled. The Sheikh of Qatar has very little authority over the interior of his State, which is habitated by migratin? i o-u U ^ S ^ , Saudl Arabia ; consequently, prior to k q Sheikh was very much under the influence of o-' iljQ/i an , d was afraid to act against his wishes. e 1934, however, the position of the Sheikh haa improved to a certain extent as in that year he received fl(Wr r r !J guarantee of protection against landward navsfir Q a 18 possible, however, that the Sheikh side an annual sum 80 as to b e on the safe in 'naqfl UC i CeS ^ ( ^ ^ mer ^ ean oil company operating; The Z a COncession granted by Ibn Saud, and Qatar haq ri ^ ^ ncessi 0n to a different company in the boundirv ^ \ question of the exact position of sideraWe hnrinrf 6 n 1 ^ a^as a matter of con- in effect nvprla J Saud claims a frontier which, Qatar oil pnn ^ 8 ^rmts of the concession held by the admit the elainf ^T 'f Majesty's Government do not which is nevprtfi ^ are Prepared to negotiate a boundary Sal one^irli 688 - h T nd what the y ^rd as the 1914 Thoap yn m the Anglo-Turkish convention of years and l^ eg0tlatl0riS have been ^ing on for several years and appear no nearer settlement.iil (6) Relations with the Trucial Chiefs are friendly, but those with Bahrein are slightly strained. Sine® 1937, when the Nairn tribe, living in Zubarah district of Qatar, agreed to observe the laws of Qatar, the Shiekh of Bahrein has cancelled the privileged rate of duty hitherto allowed on goods for Qatar in transit through Bahrein, and prohibited the entry of Qatar subjects into his territory. The Sheikh of Bahrein claims sovereignty- over Zabarah district, a claim not supported by His Majesty's Government. 4. Administration. —The Sheikh of Qatar is Abdtillah bin Jasim al Thani, C. I. E., who succeeded his father in 1913. He conducts the administration of the State him self, assisted by his very influential secretary, Suleh-bin- Mana, a reasonable and well informed man. The Sheikh has very little authority over the interior of his State, which is inhabited by migratory Bedouins. He is most anxious for close co-operation with the British Government. Qatar is under the political control of the Political Agent at Bahrein, but unlike Bahrein the Political Agent has no judicial powers there over foreign subjects. 5. British Influence. —Responsibility for the foreign relations of Qatar rests with the Government of India, subject to the ultimate control of His Majesty's Govern ment. Qatar is in the charge of the Political Agent at Bahrein. By the treaty of the 3rd November. 1916, between His Majesty's Government and the Sheikh of Qatar, thy Sheikh was guaranteed protection from attack by sea, his foreign relations were the concern of the British Gov ernment, and he was precluded from granting oil con cessions without their consent. In 1922, and again in 1930, the Sheikh desired to enter into some closer agree ment, but it was not until 1934, that a further guarantee was given. This guarantee was given in March, 1934, on condition that the Sheikh granted the oil concession to Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and not (in conformity with Ibn Saud's wishes) to the American company operating92 in Hasa, as at the time seemed possible. Tlic guarantee is for the protection of Qatar from unprovoked attack by land, although the Sheikh is expected to deal with minor incursions himself. He has been informed that this protection will probably be given by means of air- In the oil concession, there is a pre-emptive clause in favour of His Majesty's Government to purchase the oil m event of emergency. Q. Population.—The inhabitants of Qatar, as of most ot the districts on the western shore of the Persian Gulf may be conveniently classified as fixed and nomadic. j-iP 6 seclentar y population consists of a number of duterent communities and tribes of which nearly all are common to Qatar and the Bahrein islands ; the follow- ing taole gives its composition in some detail Name of tribe | Number of craft. or community. souls in Where found in Qatar.

A considerable proportion of the settled tribes oi Qatar go into camp in the interior in winter with their noeks and herds.

G eography and C limate. L General Description. —Qatar is a peninsular of land projecting northwards from the Persian Grulf coast of Arabia about midway between Ras Musandam and Kuwait and just south-east of Bahrein. It is approximately 100 miles long- from north to south, and 50 miles wide from east to west at its widest point, about half way down the peninsular. The whole peninsular is desert and there are practically no permanent habitations in the interior, but at certain times of the year there are nomads in considerable numbers. There are several small fishing villages on the coast, the chief being Doha, half way down the east coast. Imme diately opposite Doha, on the west side of the peninsular and about two miles inland from the coast, Petroleum Development (Qatar), Ltd., have a camp. They started prospecting for oil in the winter of 1938. Whether oil will be found in commercial quantities is not yet known (September, 1939). 2. Boundaries. —On the east, north and west, Qatar is bounded by the sea. The southern boundary is indeter minate. For the purpose of the guarantee against land ward aggression. His Majesty's Government treated the southern boundary as being a line drawn across the base of the peninsular from the head of Dohat es Salwa to a point at which the northern shore of the Khor el Odeid inlet leaves the main coast line of Qatar. Ibn Saud has laid claim in particular to Jebel Nakhlah, to the east of Salwa Bay and Khor el Odeid. The former is included in the concession granted to Petroleum Develop ment (Qatar), Ltd., and the latter is in the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's territory, the Qatar boundary being directly north of it. His Majesty's Government do not admit the claims of Ibn Saud but have offered him a frontier which, lying south of the Qatar concession boundary, is never theless north of the frontier laid down in the Anglo- Turkish convention of 1914, which is the border they, in principle, maintain he is bound to observe. Negotiations96 have been going on for several years but no agreement has yet been reached (September, 1939). 3. Physical Practically the whole promon tory consists of undulating rocky and pebbly desert The northern part is very low-lying, though the southern por tion is generally higher than Bahrein Island. The onlv hill of any importance is Jabal-At-Tawar. The soil is poor, consisting in the best localities of gravel and marl mixed with sand. There are practically no fields or date groves. Such gardens as exist near towns and villages are small and unproductive. Hardly a tree is to be seen anywhere. The only natural vegetation is coarse grass, growing m tufts among the sandhills, and some occasional stunted brushwood. fwS t ^ CeUtr( l,- of } he Promontory the water level is be en ^50 and ..oO feet below the surface of the ground. wnnM K SUrfaCe the north a nd west i^ fairly hard and lubtfufifW in m0St PlaCeS f0r ^ velllc ^ but ^ ^ Sound y arm( ? ure( l cars co nM traverse the uneven b^Cn In the sou tb-east, dunes are i.nQ Vn rontier ? the soft sand and sandy 11 SI? out ^£7 Plaees-The chief town of Qatar, and the Ras RakfiT • 1S ' situated 63 miles south of Of th® D e2,3» r0 T ately half wa y &lt;io ™ th e ^ ^ assistance could £ven t protected by reefs a n rl . i ifm g fairly Wel1 Doha is about 19 onrv iv. sandbanks.

There is good water and plenty of shade in the gardens belonging to the Sheikh. There is also a site for a landing ground. The Royal Air Force landing ground and petrol store is situated one mile north of Doha. There is a sheltered anchorage for seaplanes in the harbour. The oil fields area is miles from the sea, half way up the west coast of the peninsular. There is no water avail able. Water and supplies come by sea to Dohat-es-Zekrit, seven miles to the north. The water is piped to the camp and the supplies are brought in light lorries. A track, passable for mechanical transport, exists between the camp and Doha, 50 miles across the peninsular. The oil company possess a small wireless station for communication with Bahrein. A possible landing ground exists about 2 miles inland from Dohat-es-Zekrit, and flying boats should be able to alight in the bay. The Salwa wells are a large group of water wells just outside the frontier near the south-west corner of the peninsular. They are important as any major raiding force would probably have to utilise them as a gathering point. An indifferent track runs from them to Doha. 5. .Villages. —The following tables give a list of the principal villages and other places of importance in Qatar :— (a) On the east coast. -'A. 1 Name.

Climate. —The climate is dry and a few miles inland the air appears to be entirely destitute of moisture. The rainfall is, however, said to be less scanty than that of Bahrein. .oiodJ112 CHAPTER III. C ommunications. 1, General. —No telephone, telegraph, cable or wireless communication exists in Qatar. The Oil Company operate a small wireless station at their eamp which is in communication with Bahrein. 2. Air Communications. —Qatar is not a halting place on the Imperial Airways route to India. The Royal Air Force maintain a landing ground, with a petrol and oil store, one mile north of Doha. It is 1,000 by 200 yards, and marked with a circle and comer markings. A possible sheltered anchorage for seaplanes, unmarked, exists in Doha Bay. As the R. A. F. landing ground is only connected to the oil fields area by an indifferent road 55 miles long, it would be advisable, especially in the event of the oil fields develop ing, to have a regular landing ground in their area. A possible site exists about two miles inland from Dohat-es- Zekrit by the road to the oil camp. A suitable alighting area and good anchorage for seaplanes is available at Dohat-es-Zeknt, seven miles north of the oil camp. The following are possible landing grounds or anchorages observed on the coastline of Qatar :— Anaibar Island. —Possible landing ground on mainland 5 miles to north-east of the island. Duhat Salwa. —Southampton Bay. Anchorage. This bay was so named as it was uncharted in 1930. Possible landing ground exists just north of the bay. The interior of this coast consists of detached hills and ridges and it is thought that a safe landing could be carried out, in case of a forced landing, between them. Pas Ahuruk. —Possible landing ground and protected anchorage. Hawar Island. —Small village on south end of island.

Sea Commnnications and Port Facilities.—Doha is the only sheltered port of Qatar and the only place where naval assistance ^ could be given. The harbour is fairly well protected by reefs and sandbanks and is 3 to 5 fathoms deep, but its approaches are difficult. No shipping lines make regular calls at Doha, com- mumcation being entirely by local craft, of which there are approximately 300 pearling dhows, 40 other sea-goin^ Sheikh b0atS and 1 m0t0r dh0W 0Wned by the There is a small customs jetty which small pulling boats can go alongside at most stages of the tide.

The boats, it may be remarked, are built by carpenters who come over from Bahrein and from Persia. The Qatar pearl tleet carries about 13,000 men, the average crew of each pearl boat being about 16 men. 4. Roads. —There are no real roads in Qatar. Generally speaking, the existing ' roads ' are tracks connecting wells or villages. Broadly, in the northern and western portions of the peninsula the surface is fairly hard and is passable in most areas for light mechanical transport, but in the south-east, between Doha and the frontier, the soft sandy surface is unsuitable for any type of mechanical trans port.1 JK ' ^ '7d 115 The following tracks exist which are passable for light mechanical transport, but they are by no means good roads :— Doha to Dha'am, via Awainat bin Hassain. Doha to Wakra. Doha to Salwa, via Kara'ana. It is not certain whether M. T. could travel from Kara'ana to Salwa. A branch runs -from this track to Umm Taga. Doha to the Oil Camp, about 50 miles, and on to the oil camp's pier for supplies at Dohat-es-Zekrit, 7 miles to the north.116 CHAPTER IV. Besouroes. 1. Water Supply. —The question of water is the most important factor that will affect military operations in this area. There are no rivers, springs or streams ; water, therefore, is obtained from wells, many of which are brackish. Winter is the rainy season. During December, January and February, the supply of water is replenished and the quality improved. During the summer, the length of time that wells continue to yield good water is dependent on the extent of rainfall in winter. The ' List of Villages ' in Chapter II shows the normal state of the water supply, but the information can only be approximate. It would always be safer to depend on local and up-to-date information as to the state of the water supply should operations be under consideration. There is no water available in the oil fields area. Drink ing and washing water is brought on lighters by sea to Dohat-es-Zekrit and piped from there to the camp. Sea water, for oil drilling purposes, is pumped from the sea, one and a half miles from the camp. 2. Oil, The prosperity and importance of Qatar will considerably change should oil be struck in commercial quantities, as it has been in Bahrein and Hasa. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., obtained the original oil s ln 1935, and a political agreement was entered into m e same year, for 75 years. This agreement includes a pre-emptive clause in favour of His Majesty's Govern ment ^ to purchase oil in the event of an emergency. Petroleum Development (Qatar), Ltd., was formed i' ■ qV 1 an eoiI1I1 ienced operating the concession. pmc-il rmrrcT work hao boon Tmrrpteted-^niL-deep drilUfig operations commenced in the winter of 1938PTh» situation now (Sep.tfimb^ieSQ) is that one test well is in piocess of being drilled, and has just had its first ■mall show of ort:Page 116, paragraph 2, line 10, delete from ' Geographical survey' to end of page and substitute the following :— ' Survey operations are still (June 1941) in the exploration stage but work is expected to continue to the limit of materials obtainable in the present circumstances. By the end of May 1941 two test wells had been drilled on the south-western coast of the Qatar peninsula and in both cases oil was located. The oil ' potential ' cannot be safely estimated on two wells, but the possibilities appear promising. ^.| third test in the same area will be commenced at the end of July 1941.117 Petroleum Concessions. Ltd., is the concessions com pany of the Iraq Petroleum Company, which is owned jointly by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and otner interests. There are, therefore, British interests in thy 'Company, which is not wholly American as is the one operating in Hasa under a concession granted by Ibn Saud. It is the possibility of success in Qatar and the success of the company in Hasa that makes the ques tion of the exact boundary between the two areas :i matter of such importance. The area selected by Petroleum Development (Qatar), Ltd., in which to drill for oil is approximately two miles inland from the west coast and seven miles south of Dohat-es-Zekrit. They have a camp here and the test well. An indifferent motor track runs 50 miles across the peninsular to Doha, and a motor road runs to Dohat- cs-Zekrit, where there is a pier at which is landed from lighters all the supplies and drinking water for the camp. The water is piped up and the supplies brought by mechanical transport. The company have at the camp a wireless station with which they can communi cate to Bahrein. A possible landing ground exists about two miles inland from the pier and an anchorage at Dohat-es-Zekrit. Should the oil fields develop, it will probably be found /necessary to pipe the oil a considerable distance to * suitable point for transhipment to tankers, the water opposite the western coast not being deep enough. 3. Supplies and Fuel. — A force landing in Qatar could not rely on local resources for any supplies whatever, with the exception of a small quantity of fuel.118 CHAPTER V. ! A rmed F orces. 1. General. The Sheikh of Qatar has been promised protection from unprovoked attack by sea and by land. But he is expected to be able to defeat any raids, other than a general invasion from Saudi Arabia, with his own resources. He has been informed that any assistance given him against landward aggression will probably be by I'icans of aircraft. For this reason the maintenance of the R A. F. landing ground at Doha and the con struction of a landing ground in the oil fields area is of importance. In order to make the Sheikh's local forces as efficient as possible, they are now (September, 1939) in a process of being re-equipped. • T h e Sheikh's Forces. —The armed force really con sists ot the personal escort kept by the Sheikh. It is paid and armed by the Sheikh but wears no uniform. It is an irregu ar force of a few hundred tribesmen, armed with a variety of rifles. There are, however, 50 Mauser P^*fnnn lShPlk |' &lt;mler&lt;: ' d ^ J 0 S 0f . ammnnitlon - He wished to purchase countrv 8 hp. ^ • aS they are ^iO^itable for the Rxins Mi'd six li ^ ht machine ' trucks of the Ford V. 8 anv presen ' t force has no training of Doha bv thp ' 1 that visits be made to ^oha by the proposed Regular Army Adjutant and general tarILa?^ ^f r ^ a ^ re ^ n an d weapon training and PartLulara ^Lr m ^ 0 \ be duri ^ these visits. ©specially armed 0 ' cars in* ^ t0 ^ rainin?: the f(&gt;rce ' When thp Tf a -p a ?' co-operation with aircraft. be able ? ht iS stetioned at Shaikh's foroe s at suitable Ite^ab. 0 '' eIerCiSeS With th ''7«- 119 4. Auxiliary Force. —In the event of the oil company successfully striking' oil and the consequent increase in numbers of British personnel in Qatar, the question of forming an Auxiliary Force, armed 1 with modem weapons, for defence of the oil fields against raids or sabotage will probably be considered.120 X 5 SECTION E. TRUCIAL OMAN. CHAPTER 1. History, Administration and P opulation. 1. General. —The Trucial Sheikhdoms are independently administered tribal principalities governed by independent Arab Shaikhs entitled to varying degrees of protection from Great Britain. The Trucial chiefs are the Sheikhs of Ras-al-Khaimah Umm-al-Qaiwan, Ajman, Sharjah, Dibai, Abu Dhabi, A1 Qatar, and Kalba. Al Qatar was added to the number in 1916 and has been dealt with in Section D. Kalba became the 8th Trucial chief in 1936, when he agreed to enter into the same contracts as tbe others. The limits of the Sheikhdoms along the coast are known, although sometimes disputed, but the territories inland have never been delineated. In addition to the Trucial Sheikhs, there are others, such as Hira, Himriyah, and Dibah, who have asserted their practical independance of the major Sheikhs but have not as yet been recogniped as indepen dent principalities by His Majesty's Government. 1 he importance of the Trucial Oman to Great Britain lies in the following facts. It is the next stage after Bahrein on the main Empire air route to India and beyond. Khor Quwai, at the extreme northern end of the coast, is a IS aval recreation station for ships of the Persian Jaulf Division, and a naval oil barge is maintained here. Khor Quwai is under the control of the Sultan of Muscat. The landing grounds on the coast are suitable as a base for air reconnaissance and air operations over the entrance to the Persian Gulf. It is possible that oil will be found in commercial quantities, and Petroleum Concessions Ltd., a companv with British interests, has obtained concessions from certain Sheikhs. As regards the Empire air route, Sharjah and Dibai are Imperial Airways regular halting places and con- sequently the most important places, particularly Sharjah with its R. A. F. bomb store and wireless station. Butthe disorders that occurred in 1938-1939 show that the Trueiai coast is a weak link in the air route, and it is necessary that it should be strengthened by the provision bf alternative alighting areas suitable for every type of aircraft which may use the route. It will be seen there fore that from the point of view of the Royal Air Force and imperial Airways one or two areas alone are not important, but as the majority of the Sheikhdoms possess landing facilities and anchorages, and as alternatives are required they all must be considered in the defence of the air route. 2. History. —The history of the region, now known as Trucial Oman, before the middle of the 18th century is almost entirely lost. It seems clear, however, that neither the Portuguese nor the Persians then retained any hold upon the country, and that the predominating influence was that of the Qasimi Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. The decline of Persian influence in the Gulf after the death of Nadir Shah first brought the Qawasim Arabs upon the scene, and from 1778 until 1823 their depreda tions by sea (and on land) were a scourge throughout the Persian Gulf. They even sailed into the Arabian Sea where at times they harried the coasts of India and the Arabian coast as far south as the island of Socotra. The Government of India took action against, them in 1809-10 with a combined Naval and Military force which was successful locally, but whose action had no lasting effect. A second British attack in 1816 proved futile, but in 1819-20 a third expeditionary force, which had as an ally the Sultan of Muscat, was more successful. On the con clusion of operations a treaty known as the General Treaty of Peace was signed in 1820 by the Sheikhs of Ras-al- Kbaimah, Hamra, Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Sharjah, Umm-al- Qaiwan and also Bahrein. The main articles of this Treaty provided for absten tion from piracy, by land and sea, and the suppression of the slave traffic. An Arab official was established as Agent of the Government of India at Sharjah in 1823.122 Piracy now ceased to be a profession, though cases of it occurred, and in 1835 the Beni Yas and Albu Falasah tribes revived the flickering spirit of piracy for a time. The period 1820-35 was marked by hostilities with Muscat and internecine feuds among the Sheikhs of the Pirate Coast themselves. About this time the Wahabis had gained a footing in Eastern Arabia and from their outpost at Barami inter vened* in the affairs of the principalities. It was found in practice that the General Treaty of Peace was insufficient for the purpose of maintaining security at sea, as it did not prohibit regular maritime warfare, and, at the instigation of the Resident in the Per sian Gulf, the first Maritime Truce was signed in 1835. After an interval of 18 years a series of yearly truces were agreed on, mainly in order to permit the continuance of the pearl fishing industry, which affected everyone. In 1843 a ten-year truce was signed. Further treaties were concluded with the Trucial Chiefs in 1838-39-47 and 1892. 3. Relations with neifjhhours. — (a) Ibn Saud is pledged by treaty to maintain friendly and peaceful relations with the territories of the Sheikhs of the Trucial Oman, who are in soecial treaty relations with His Majesty's Govern ment. He has shown no inclination to violate this under taking and has not directly interfered in the Tmcial Coast affairs. Ibn Saud is however recognised as a really great man and considerable care is exercised by the Sheikhs to avoid any action which might be opposed to his wishes. Never- eJess he is a long way off, and it is ctoubtful if he it regarded as a serious menace to their independence. Theie are indications that the influence of Ibn Saud m t ie Baraimi Oasis, a place of considerable strategic im portance, is on the decline and that the dominant position is now held by the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi. The question cv, I'f b ° undar y between Saudi Arabia and 1 the Trucial bneikhs has been pending for years. (6) The Sultan of Muscat is recognised as quite a® impo ant ruler in his own domains, but otherwise h«123 wields no very great influence. His possessions in peninsula are recognised and he has influence over a certain area of the Baraimi Oasis, but any suggestion of his suzerainty over the hinterland would be vigorously rejected. This however is not likely to occur. (c) In 1926 Persia commenced to adopt an active policy in the Gulf. The result of this has been to bring her into conflict on certain points with the Trucial Chiefs and their interests. The Trucial settlements on the South Persian coast and* the Trucial ownership of the islands of Tamb r Little Tamb, Abu Musa and Sirri, which is claimed by the Sheikhs of Sharjah, and Ras-al-Khaimah and which is con tested by Persia, have all afforded grounds of friction. In 1928 Persia put forward tentative claims to suzer ainty over the Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast but these claims have not since been seriously pressed. In 1935 Iran again raised the question of the owner ship of Tamb and Abu Musa Islands. The Abu Musa dispute arose when the Sheikh of Sharjah granted an oxide concession to a British Company. His Majesty's Grovernment have made it clear to the Iranian Government that they have never admitted Iranian claims to these islands. 4. Administration. —The Trucial States are tribal prin cipalities governed by independent Arab Sheikhs. The Trucial Treaties accord to the contracting parties the right to accredit a representative on'the one side at the head quarters of the several Sheikhs, and on the other at the British Residency at Bushire. But in practice the Chiefs have no representatives and His Majesty's Government are represented only by an Arab Agent of the Residency who is stationed at Sharjah and moves from place to place as required. His summer quarters are at Ras-al-Khaimah. The Trucial Chiefs are so called on account of the treaties of maritime truce concluded by them between 1820 and 1853 with His Majesty's Government under which a check was imposed on their feuds and' their piratical and slaving activities in the Gulf, • ll1^4 The following are the present (1939) rulers of the major Trueial Sheikhdoms, and the year of their succes sion ;— Abu Dhabi—Sheikh Shakbut bin Sultan, 1928. Dibai—Sheikh Said bin Maktum, O.B.E., 1912. Sharjah—Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr, 1924. Ajman—Sheikh Rashid bin Humaid, 1928. Umm-al-Qaiwan—Sheikh Ahmad bin Reshid, 1929. Ras-al-Khaimah—Sheikh bir Salim, 1919. Kalba— Sheikh Hamud bin Said—Aged 7 when succeeded his Father in 1937. Regent Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmad, 1937. 5. Internal affairs. —The following incidents have occurred in the last three years which give a picture of the relations of the major Sheikhs amongst themselves and of their characters. Slave trading still continues to a limited* extent in the Gulf, slaves being brought from Iranian Baluchistan and disposed of in Hasa. Abu Dhabi is the focus of this traffic and the attitude of the Sheikh in this matter led in 1938 to the withdrawal of the good offices of His Majesty's Government. When approached by Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., for an agreement the Sheikh was extremely difficult and exorbitant in his demands. The matter has now been dropped (1939). He further showed general hostility to a party of the oil company who went through his territory in 1938 to Baraimi Oasis. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi is a powerful ruler and holds a dominant position in the Baraimi Oasis area. On the whole ms relations with the other Sheikhs are good, but e is having a boundary dispute with the ruler of Dibai and it is possible that he will claim further villages in .Daraimi Oasis.-Sg 125 The Sheikh of Kalba died in April 1937, he was succeeded by his 7-year old son. Two claimants immediately appeared, the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah and Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed, an ex-Sheikh of Sharjah. The advent of the former proved most unpopular with the local tribesmen. As there was a danger of serious disturbances, the Political Agent was obliged to ensure the Sheikhs departure. Meanwhile Sheikh Khalid was more success ful and was elected Regent in August on the understand ing he would safeguard the interests of the minor Sheikh. At the same time he agreed to abide by the treaties and agreements in force between His Majesty's Government and the State of Kalba. Sheikh Khalid is universally popular and there is little doubt that he is extending his authority. In the spring of 1938 there was agitation for ad ministrative reforms in Dibai by a popular party headed by the Sheikh's cousin. Certain demands were met by the Sheikh and the movement died out, but in October there was a recrudescence of trouble. A certain amount of fighting took place, and the Sheikh finally agreed to a representative council with executive powers. In March 1939 there was a renewal of trouble when the members of the council, having forfeited the support of their followers, were forced to escape from Dibai in face of a surprise coup by the Sheikh who gained control of the town. The Sheikh then formed an Advisory Council. The x expelled offenders fled tp Sharjah which they used as a centre of intrigues against Dibai. As the Sheikh of Sharjah appeared to encourage their activities and allowed them to remain in the town, Dibai threatened ari invasion of Sharjah. The situation was somewhat critical in June 1939 and the Political Agent had to intervene to ensure peace. The offenders were eventually removed from Sharjah to more distant states. The Sheikhs of Dibai and Sharjah have since met and are again on friendly relations with one another. During these troubles Imperial Airways flying boats which normally refuel at Dibai had to use an alternative anchorage at Ras-al-Khaimah. There was also a danger to the safety of the Imperial Airways personnel, equip-126 ment and wireless station by the Sharjah landing ground. The Sheikh of Dibai possesses very little influence outside Dibai and the recent quarrels with his family have not improved- his position. He has recently re-established his former alliances with the Sheikhs of Umm-al-Qaiwan and Ajman. The Sheikh of Sharjah has a very precarious hold on his Sheikhctom and his effective control only e::tends as far as his gardens beyond the aerodrome. 6. British Influence. —There is no Political Agent for the Trucial Coast but it comes under the charge of the Political A&lt;?ent, Bahrein who is represented locally by an Arab Official, the Residency Agent in Sharjah. The Sheikhs of the Trucial Coast by their treaty en gagements with His Majesty's Grovernment are bound to prevent slavery and arms smuggling, to enter into no correspondence with any other power other than His Majesty's Government and to allow no other power to occupy any part of their territories. They have been promised either directly or by implication a degree of protection which it is difficult precisely to define. In addition to the Treaties, Air Facilities Agreements have been concluded with the Sheikhs of Abu Dhabi Dibai, Sharjah, Ras-al-Khaimah and Kalba. British influence is the strongest foreign influence in Truc.ial Oman, and is in fact the predominating in^uenc# in all but the domestic affairs of the various sheikhdoms. Although it has not been found 1 necessary to exercise more than a nominal control over these States in the past, the recent establishment of an air route along the Arabian littoral of the Persian Gulf has brought this part of the coast into prominence. Now that the air route is established a somewhat closer control is considered neces sary. Tn September 1939 the Sheikhs of Sharjah and Dibai offered His Majesty's Government all the assistance within their power. 7. Population. —The total population of Trucial Oman has been estimated at over 80,000 of whom about 8,000 •re nomadic.r KS' 127 Tliey belong to numerous distinct tribes. The country is, tribally, one of the most intricate and perplexing in the Persian Gulf. As a result of the slave trade in former times, there is a large negro element. \\ ith the exception of a few thousand nomadic and semi-nomadic Bed'ouins of the interior, who raise herds of camels and goats, and engage in a little cultivation the bulk of the people live by the sea. In summer pearl diving employs most of the able- bodied men. In winter, though some take part in the ordinary fisheries, the majority are unemployed being supported by the pearl boat owners during the' slack season. The people are divided between the Hinawi and Grhaiiri political factions. J» ere rr? as a • civil war betweei1 these two factions in 1722. The distinction is racial and religious, Hinawis being of \emeni stock and the Khawarij sect and Ghatlrib of Nejdi stock and Sunnis. But the distinction cannot be too closely insisted on as there is apt to be re- groupmg In general, however, a Hinawi will not ally with a (jhann against another Hinawi, though he mav d&lt; «o against another Grhafiri. The population of the principalities of Abu Dhabi and inbai lean mostly to the Hinawi faction. The maioritv are Sunnis (Malikis). The people of Sharjah, Ajman, Umm-al-Qaiwan, and Kas-al-Khaimah belong mostly to the Ghafiri faction, and a great many are Wahabis, though not of the militant order. There are^ very few Europeans in the Trucial Oman, personnel of Imperial Airways and the oil company form e majority of those that there are. The former being stationed in Sharjah. There are a number of British coast 6 7 Indian traders, in the chief towns on the 8.

CHAPTER II. G eography, C limate and H ealth. 1. Boundaries.—On the coast, Trucial Oman • iteuda, in the Persian Gulf from Khor-al-Odaid to Ras-ash-Sbaam, and in the Gulf of Oman from a point between the vil lages of Bei'ah and Dibbah to Khor Kalba. A line joining 1 Ras-ash-Sha'am to this point betweei) Bai'ah and Dibah forms the Southern frontier of Ru'us-al- Jibal, a mountainous district nominally subject to the Sultan of Oman. From a point between Khor Kalba and Murair the Eastern frontier of Trucial Oman, which is essentially fluid, turns inland westwards and then south, passing north of the districts of Mahadhan and Jau to an uncer tain point in Khatam. Prom this point the inland bouD- dary follows the edge of the Ruba'al-Khali and Jafurah deserts running more or less parallel to the Gulf. 2. Physical Geography. —Physically Trucial Oman con sists of three zones or divisions—a maritime belt and islands ; inland plains ; and a mountain system. The Western coast is low and monotonous. In the north there are occasional date groves but as the coast trends away to the south and west trees die out, until ai Abu Dhabi they cease altogether. The shore is lined by suoals. reefs and islands ; creeks are numerous, uniting sometimes inland to form backwaters and swamps, and quasi -islan^ are created in this manner. Navigation is extremely diu&gt; cult and dangerous even to local craft and the whole coact is exposed to the strong Shamal (north-west) gales. The Eastern coast {i.e., that washed by the Gulf cf Oman), is bold and steep, the hills in places coming down to the water's edge. The inland plains, which consist almost entirely of sanuy desert, commence from the coast and merge in che north into the hilly tract and in the south into the desert. Mea gre desert vegetation and some wells and water holea sup port a scanty Bedouin population. ■ mi it Baii 5®! i EtiOII aleivil rjplaiiZ2 133 The mountain tract is in the East where a section the spinal range of the Oman Promontory is included. This tract is about 50 miles in extent from north to south and its average breadth is about 20 miles. Tht mountain ridges run from north to south. The tract is bare and, for the most part, waterless. The Baraimi Oasis is situated in the centre of the southern base of the Oman peninsula, approximately 75 miles east of Abu Dhabi. It is a very fertile area of about four square miles, watered by streams. It contains some ten villages, which are separated by stretches of un fertile plain. To the south, this plain continues on both sides of Jabel Hafit, to a breadth of about three miles on either side, the eastern plain being bounded by ihe Oman foothills, and the western by continuous sandhills. Jebel Hafit rises out of this plain as a great bare hog's back to a height of 'about 300 ft. above the plain level. On the uorch the sandhills curve round and about on Jebel Samaini. North of this sand the plain runs on past Jebel heiyah towards Ras al Khaimah. Dhaid is situated on th&lt;? northern part of this plain on a large wadi which tuns from the neighbourhood of Jezir-at al Hamra on the Trucial Coast to near the end of Jebel Faiyah. 3. The Principalities, (a) Abu Dhabi. —This princi pality is the largest in the area. It stretches along the coast from the creek of Ghanadhah on the north to Khor Odaid on the west. Towards the interior the bounugri-js are, ill-defined. They are said to extend on the ea.tt to the Baraimi Oasis and on the south to the margin or the Great Desert. The principality consists of the following districts from west to east :— Aqal, Mijan, Sabkhah Matti, Dhafrah and Abu Dhabi. All are tracts of sandy desert with a very poor water supply. Included in the principality are the islands of Arstanfth, Daiyinah, Das, Qarnain. Zirko, Dalmah, Yas and Salali. Of these the only important islands are Dalmah and \ *s134 The principal settlement is :— Place. Position. Water supply. Remarks. Abu Dhabi 88 m. S. W. of Sharjah. From indi fferent wells on landward side of town and shallow pits 3 to 4 miles inland. The capital. Ex tends for about 1J miles along th» shore. At high tide the place be comes an island through the con nection of creek and backwaters. The principal islands are :— Dalmah. —An island lying 40 miles east by north the mouth of the Khor-al-Odaid and about 25 miles from the nearest point of the coast to the south-east. It is 5 miles by miles, and for the most part hilly with wells of brac kish water and deposits of red oxide of iron. There is a small settlement of the Beni Yas tribe. Towards the end of the pearling season a temporary bazaar is set up and it becomes a centre for the near! trade. 1 as. Is an island about 20 miles south-east of Dalmah and only a few miles from the shore at Jebel Dhanuah. Tt is miles by 5 miles with central volcanic hills aud low shores. W ater froiil wells gives out in summer. It is visited by fishermen .in winter. At the south end is a land-locked harbour with a depth o from 4 to 6 fathoms. Across the entrance is a bar carrying only 2 or 3 feet of water at M. L. W. S. The island is conveniently placed for use as a seaplane anchor age and has been used as such by the Royal Air Force. P^ a ^' ^is principality lies on the coast south of btmxjah between Abu Hail on the north and Khor Ghana- ah on the south. Its extent inland is not precisely de- ned. It consists of low sandy country without important135 natural features, the only hill being Jebel-al-Ali (225 ft.) 19 miles south-west of the town. Two miles up the creek from Dibai town is Imperial Airways alighting area. The creek is several hundrad yards wide at the alighting area, but narrows to one hundred yards near the sea, and winds through the town of Dibai with houses on either side. All petrol and store lighters have to come through this narrow entrance. The alighting area includes a landing stage, two motor launches, some tents for stores and, on the south side of the creek, a petrol and oil store maintained by the Rafidnm Oil Company. The personnel employed in connection with the alighting area live in Sharjah Fort, seven miles north. The country between is open desert with a haid surface suitable for mechanical vehicles. In the event of serious trouble in the town it would be impossible to protect the narrow entrance without large forces. In addition, the alighting area would require pro tection in the form of picquets. The principal settlement is :— Place. Position. Water supply. Remarks. Dibai 7 m. S.

It con tains almost the whole of the settled popula tion of princi pality. It is the chief distributing centre of foreign goods to the in terior, especially to the Bsraimi Oasis.136 (c) Sharjah. —The principality has coasts on both gulfs. The northern boundary follows a line from Jezirat -al- Hamra to the southern extremity of the Jirri plain and from this point a line to Dibah on the Gulf of Oman forms the north-east limit. Its southern boundary is a line from Sharjah Towu on the Persian Gulf to Khor Kalba on the Gulf of Oman. From this area the principalities of Ajman Umm-al- Qaiwan and Hamriyah must be excluded. There is no doubt that this large area belongs to the Sheikh ' de jure' .but at the same time it is equally certain that he is unable to control it. He now possesses little influence outside his own town. One and a half miles inland from the town o£ Sharjah in flat open desert is Sharjah fort and landing ground. The iort is in the form of a rectangle with two loopholed towers at the opposite corners. It provides accommoda tion for Imperial Airways offices and employees, a rest house for passengers and the WjT and D|F station. Out side the fort is a barbed wire enclosure into which aircraft can be brought for protection. Inside this enclosure and about fifty yards from the fort is a R. A. F. bomb store. The D I masts are some five hundred yards to the north of the fort and the landing ground is immediately beyond the enclosure to the east. Ihe water supply for the fort is carried daily by donkeys rorn wells two miles to the east, but there is a saline ■well in oim ^ an( ^ a con( i en ser plant which can produce about ^40 gallons per day. , .^ 1( ' '''' r ^ ^ as ^s own electricity supply and this is a^ail- a e tor searchlights which are mounted on the towers, % n +^ irf J a ,)eacon k e Pt flight at night. From the top of the iort it is possible to signal to ships off Sharjah and an Aldis lamp is held for this purpose The number of permanent officials of Imperial Airways esi mg in th e f ort is 8 British officials and some 24 noiau clerks, |T operators, etc. But there are often i lona personnel stopping for short periods. the Reridency'Agent Sllarjah is the Aga ' CT ^J 37 The principal settlements are ,— Place.

It is pro bably accessible from Rasal Khai- mah by M. T. It lies on camel routes connecting it with Shamaili- yah District on Gulf of Oman. The islands of this principality are :— Abu Musa. —Is a larger island than Tamb and more thickly populated. It lies approximately midway between Lingeh in Persia and Sharjah. It has a good water supply and deposits of red oxide. (d) Ajman. —This is a small principality consisting of the town of the same name and its environs. Situation 5 miles north-east of Sharjah. The town lies on the south side of the entrance of a shallow creek. VJ ater of indifferent quality is obtained from wells about 9 ft. deep. The locality of the wells is constantly changing. (e) L mm-al-Qaiwan. —This is another small principality consisting of a town and adjoining country. It extends noithwards to Jazirat-ul-Hamra and southwards part of the way to Hamriyah. The town lies about 18 miles north east of Sharjah and is built on a spit of land, forminj with a neighbouring island a land-locked creek with * narrow entrance.r^ 139 The water of indifferent quality is obtained from wells $ ft. deep. About 16 miles south-east of the town at Falaj-al-Ali, there are large date plantations irrigated by a stream. (/) Bas-al-Khaimah. —The principality is divided from the Ruus-al-Jibal district of Oman by a line running oblique ly from Ras-al-Sham on the Persian Gulf to a point between the villages of Dibah and Baiah on the Gulf of Oman. The southern boundary of the principality follows a line from Jazirat-al-Hamra to the southern extremity of the Jirri plain from which point a line to Dibha forms the boundary on the south-east. The district consists of a low sandy maritime plain, rising to the hill country of the Oman promontory. The creek at Ras-al-Khaimah is very suitable as an alighting area. It is used as such by R. A. F. flying boats and a lighter with petrol is maintained there. Imperial Airways flying boats used Ras-al-Khaimah as an alterna tive alighting area when it was not considered safe to use Dibai OAving to local disturbances. There is however neither an Imperial Airways petrol and oil store nor any facilities for passengers and crews. Further, like Dibai, in the event of general unrest there might be difficulty in protecting this area owing to its proximity to the town. The principal settlements are :— Place. Position. Water supply. Remarks. Ras -al-Khai mah town. About 48 m. N. E. of S h a r j a h town. Drinking water is scanty and of poor quality. The capital.

The islands of this principality are :— Tamb. —An island 17 miles south of south-west point of Khishm island in the Persian Gulf. It is sparsely in habited and almost waterless. Roughly circular in shape and about 2^ miles in diameter. There is a lighthouse on Tamb Island. Parties landing should be particularly careful to avoid snakes. The deadly Russel's viper is common. Little Tamb. —An uninhabited and waterless island 8 miles west of Tamb. It is 1 mile long by f mile wide. (g) Kalba. —The exact boundaries of this principality are not very clear as Kalba only became a Trucial Sheikh dom in 1936. The. present Sheikh is gradually extending his influence and asserting his authority to the north towards Dibah, where the tribes are virtually independent, although owing nominal allegiance to the Shaikh141 Sfaarjah, and to the south to the Wadi-al-Qor. There is an Imperial Airways emergency landing ground and an exposed seaplane anchorage at Kalba. (h) The Baraimi Oasis. —Although not an independent principality this oasis is an area of considerable strategic importance to the Trucial coast. It lies in the centre of the base of the Oman peninsula, and any large raiding party or major invasion from the mainland would have to make use of it. The oasis is very fertile and a great trading centre. Tracks, many of them passable for light M. T., radiate from it to all the chief towns in the penin sula. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi lays claim to a part of Baraimi and through an able Wali weilds considerable influence there. The Sultan of Muscat similarly claims a part of the oasis, but his influence, through the Wali of Sohar, is not so great as that of Abu Dhabi. But neither can claim full suzerainty over the whole oasis as there are various Sheikhs of local tribes who claim to be inde7 )endent. There are about twenty different tribes in the oasis and near neighbourhood. A clash of interests is therefore always liable to occur and villages are at constant feud. The influence of Ibn Saud in Baraimi appears to be on the decline. The oasis was visited in the winter of 1938 by two explo ration parties of Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., and before this no European had been to Baraimi since 1905. The local tribes are most primitive and imbued with suspicion and fear of European visitors. The Baraimi oasis, some four square miles in area, con sists of groups of date gardens, separated by stretches of unfertile plain. The principle villages in the oi'sis under the Wali of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi are _ A1 Ain, Mu'taradh, Jimi, Gatarah, Hili, Mas'ud and Muraijib. The tribes who live in the villages of Hamasah, Baraimi and Sa'arah are independent. The gardens are watered by streams and are very fertile, dates, oranges, grapes and mangoes being ^rown. There is abundant grazing for camels in the vicinity.142 4. Climate. —Statistics axe not available, but the climate is dry and the humidity does not appear to be so lugh as that of Bahrain, while greater than that of Hasa, Tha cool season falls between November and Mawh. The average maximum temperature is about 106 o F. and the average minimum about 54°F. The whole of the Persian Gulf coast of the Trucial Oman is exposed to the full force of the shamal, north-west winds. 5. Health. —The following list shows the illnesses and diseases prevalent in Trucial Oman in order of inci dence :— 1. Eye diseases. 2. Malarial forms of all types, 3. Skin diseases. % 4. Septic sores. 5. Digestive disorders. 6. Venereal diseases.H7 143 CHAPTER III. C ommunications. 1. Wireless. —There is no telephone, telegraph or cable communication in the Trucial Oman. Cables and Wireless, Ltd., maintain a wireless and direc tion finding station at Sharjah. Details are :— Call Sign. Frequencies. Aerial power. Remarki. V.T.J. . • 333 100 Air D/F. 2. Air Communications. —Imperial Airways regular halt ing place on their route to and from India is at Sbarjah for land aircraft and Dibai for flying boats. Sharjah aerodrome 800 by 600 yards, is situated 14 miles inland from the town of Sharjah. It is a fully marked landing ground with accommodation for passengers in the fort and a petrol and oil store. There is a barbed wire enclosure into which aircraft can be brought for protec tion and in which there is a R. A. F. bomb store. There is a WIT and D|F station. Dibai, seven miles south of Sharjah, is the alighting area for flying boats. The anchorage is two miles up a creek from the town. There are mooring buoys, lighters and a petrol and oil store. There is no accommodation, and passengers are taken by car to Sharjah. This area would not be easy to protect in the event of serious disturbances in the town. Bas-al-Khaimah is used as a R. A. F. seaplane alighting area, and Imperial Airways flying boats have used it when it is not considered safe to alight at Dibai. A good sheltered anchorage is in the creek to the east of the town. An R. A. F. fuel barge is moored in the creek. There is also an emergency landing ground, 500 by 400 yards, near the village of Mearedh. It is unmarked, but R. A. F. aircraft have landed and it could possibly be developed. Ahu Dhabi, landing ground, 600 by 500 yards is situated one and a half miles south-east of the town, it has a circls144 and comer markings, and there is an R. A. F. petrol store. There is a lagoon by the town which affords sheltered anchorage for flying boats. Kalba on the east coast of the peninsula. There is an exposed seaplane anchorage with two buoys. Imperial Airways emergency landing ground, which does not appear suitable for all types of aircraft. It could be improved with little difficulty. It is marked and has a petrol and oil store. Khor Quwai at the extreme ISTorthern end of the Trucial coast comes under the control of the Sultan of Muscat. It is a Naval recreation station and there are certain shore establishments there. The protection would be easier than either Dibai or Ras-al-Khaimah in the event of a major emergency. It is a somewhat exposed anchorage being opeu at both ends. It has however been recently examined as an alternative alighting area, and it is considered quite suitable for Imperial Airways Empire flying boats. The following are possible landing grounds and anchor ages around the coast :— Jabal Jfutaid. —Two possible landing grounds, one dose to Wutaid on the west side and one 10 miles west. Jahal Dhanna. —Three possible landing grounds :— (a) 2 miles east. (b) 5 miles south-east. (c) 10 miles south-west. las Island.

Apart from this all trade is carried in local eraft. The slow mail steamer calls fortnightly at Dibai. There are no jetties, quays or other landing facilities at any of the ports of Trucial Oman. Ships have to lie out 1—3 miles off shore. The whole coast is exposed to the full force of the Shemal (N.-W. wind). The ports are situated in creeks and backwaters, approached in most cases through narrow and shallow entrances. The whole coast is lined with reefs, shoals and islands rendering navigation difficult and dangerous. Landing is effected by beaching except at Dibai where small vessels can get alongside a wharf.

Roads. —The routes in the Trueial Omaa are all camel tracks, bat a number of them are passable for light M. T. In the winter of 1938 an exploration party of the oil company travelled in motor cars from Abu Dhabi to Baraimi Oasis and back. From Baraimi they went as far south as Jebel Hafit. The country between Sharjah and Dibai i? open desert with a hard surface suitable for M. T. For a detailed report of the main routes see Part 11. The other tracks in the area are :— (a) Umm-al-Qaiwan to Dhaid. (&amp;) Sharjah to Dhaid. (c) Dibai to Baraimi Oasis.147 CHAPTER IV. R esources. 1. Water Supply. —In the towns on the coast water is obtained from wells. The details given in Chapter II. show the normal state of the water supply in the differ ent towns. As the state of water available varies in summer and winter, and depends on the extent of rain fall in winter, the information can only be approxi mate. In the interior there are a number of streams. Water being particularly plentiful at Dhaid and in the fertile Baraimi Oasis. The Sharjah Port obtains its water from a group of twenty wells situated about two miles east of the fort in three gardens, over an area of ten acres. The water is brought in daily on donkeys and in the fort there are tanks to store 3,200 gallons. The water from these wells is excellent and does not turn brackish. It is estimated that approximately 320 gallons per well per day can be drawn. In this area there is sufficient camping space and water for a battalion. In the fort itself there is a saline well and a condenser plant which can produce 240 gallons per day in an emergency. 2. Oil. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., are interested in * number of the Trucial Sheikhdoms. The following if their position now (1939) in the various states Dibai and Sharjah, concessions are held for 75 years. Concessions and political agreements signed in 1937. Ras-al-Khaimah, the option expired in 1937. A political agreement was signed in March 1938 and in December exclusive exploration rights were obtained for three and a half years.148 Kalba. A concession for 75 years was obtained in 1939. Ajman, an option to explore for oil expired in 1938 and so far the Company have failed to induce the Sheikh to grant a concession. Abu Dhabi, negotiations for a concession have recently been suspended as the Sheikh was proving difficult. Umm-al-Qaiwan, no option or concession has as yet been obtained but the Sheikh is williug to negotiate. No work, apart from exploration parties, has so ia r been carried out m any of the concessions obtained, it- is not known therefore if there is any oil in these areas. Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., is a subsidiary of the Iraq Petroleum Company and proportion of their sham are held by the Anglo-Iranian Company. The politi cal agreement which accompanies any concession obtain ed gives His Majesty's Government pre-emptive rights of all crude oil in the event of an emergency. 3. Supplies. —Local resources in the principal towns are scanty and a force of any size could not rely on finding sufficient available. But quantities of riee. flour, potatoes, dhall, wheat and sugar are imported monthly. It is estimated that in Sharjah bazaar a sufficient supply of food is always available to feed one company of Indian infantry for two months with out further imports. In the interior are goats, sheep, cattle and chickens. About 150 goats, 10 sheep, 50 cattle and 200 chickens could be obtained on arrival in Sharjah. Further stocki would become available as they were brought in by ^ tribes from the interior. As an indication of the numbers that could be obtain ed from the hinterland, Bahrein until recently purchas ed an average of 500 goats and 40 cattle per week from Dibai.149 Fresh and salted fish is always available in large, quantities. A stock of tinned food is held in Sharjah Fort. It should be sufficient to support ten Europeans for about a month. 4. Fuel. —The desert of the hinterland is well covered with a shrub about six feet high which would make quite ^ood firewood. There are also a certain number of gardens. In Sharjah and Dibai sufficient firewood is always available. It is also easily procurable in the Ras-al- Khairaah area.^ 1. The Sheikh's forces.—The armed forces of the Trueial Sheikhs consist of the personal escorts kept by each Sheikh. These bodies of men are paid and armed with a variety of rifles by the Sheikh. They wear no uniform. There is a fair proportion of modern rifles, the re mainder being of old pattern. The statement given below shews the appronmaU numbers in each principality :— Men. 50 150 100 15 15 75 Abu Dhabi Dibai Sharjah Umm-al-Qaiwan Ajman Ras-ul-Khaimah 2. Irregulars. The Sheikhs can normally depend on tht support of the adult male population of their towns. To a lesser extent and depending on the influence of the Sheikh they may receive the support of their Bedouin allies. Practically the only arms in possession of these tribes are old pattern rifles. 3. Sharjah Fort. —The Sheikh of Sharjah provides 37 guards for the normal protection of the fort and three for the Residency Agency in the town. These are paid for by the British Government and armed with servict rifles. The Sheikh holds a reserve of ammunition. The value of these guards is doubtful. They are re cruited from the Batineh and not particularly interest ed in local quarrels, but there is the danger that in emergency they could not be relied on. ij 1 * ocrvico tvflpn nnrL PUifi n f aflMaanitieft art earn the fort for issue to I mpeHaf^Swavs person- ne » J ^ lc 4 uire d.

MUSCAT AND OMAN. CHAPTER T. H istory, A dministration and P opulation, 1. General. —The Sultanate of Muscat and Oman is a sovereign state, the independence of which Great Britain and France undertook to respect in 1862. Since 1916 the authority of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman has been lim.ted to his capital and a narrow strip along the coast from Shinas in western Hajar to Salala in Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia. He further controls an area at the northern extremity of the Trucial Coast and Gwadur on the south coast of Baluchistan, near the Iranian frontier. The tribes of the interior, in other words the greater proportion of the inhabitants, do not acknowledge his sway and liv&lt;' in practical independnce of him under their own chiefs. If they acknowledge anyone, it is the Iman of Oman. There are now, however, indications that the Sultan is endeavouring to extend his influence over these tribes of the hinterland. But how far he will be successful is still (1939) uncertain. The strategical importance of Muscat and Oman is its long coast line on the flanks of the oil tanker route from the Persian Gulf and near the main shipping route to Karachi and Bombay ; the control held by the Sultan over landing grounds on the Royal 'Air Force route rom Iraq and India to Aden ; the fact that the recrea tiona: base of the R. N. Persian Gulf Division is situated a i. in the Sultan's territory at the northern extremity of the Trucial coast where it commands the entrance to the Persian Gulf ; and the possibility of oi being found in Oman by Petroleum Concessions, Ltd, a Company with British interests. The town oi Muscat itself is important as a cable station on the cable route between Karachi and Bushire. The fact that there is a R. A. F. wireless153 station and bomb store there, and that the Political Agency is situated in the town. 2. Early History. —The Imamate of Oman owes its origin to the peculiar tenets of the Ibadhi sect of Islam— an offshoot of the Khawarij or li Seceders r, who origi nated in the dissatisfied soldiers of the forces of the Imam Ali, son-in-law of the Prophet. Most of the tribes Of Oman belong to the Ibadhi sect. The Imams were invested both with religious and civil powers and for a space of nearly 900 years until the accession of the Imam Nasir bin Murshidi of the A1 Yaarabah dynasty in 1625, were elected for their per sonal merits or popularity, irrespective of family des cent. There was however a preference for the ruling family and for the son, not necessarily the eldest, of the last Imam over other members of that family. In 1650 Nasir bin Murshid was successful in expelling the Portuguese from Oman, thereby acquiring a prestige which enabled his descendants gradually to modify the principle of election which had previously prevailed. The Yaarabi period was disturbed at the beginning of the 18th century, by a contest for the succession which paralyzed the power of the Imam abroad and gave birth to the Hinawi and Ghafiri factions at home, a source of anarchy which none of the later rulers of Oman have been able to suppress and very few to control. As the modern history of Oman is mainly the narrative of the enmity between these two factions, it is essential to know the origin and causes of the feud. The contest for the succession gave rise to a civil war in which the rightful Imam was ejected from his capital, Rostaq, by a youthful pretender. He was however able to maintain himself in Central Oman, but not without the help of a remarkable partisan leader, Muhammad bin Nasir of the Beni Ghafir tribe. About the time of the true Imam's decease in 1723, a leader on the Pretender's Side had arisen hardly inferior to Muhammad bin Nasir. This was Khalaf bin Mubarak, a sheikh of the Beni Hina.154 In the following year Muhammad bin Nasir was elected to the Imamate by the elders of Oman. He conducted suc cessful campaigns in almost every part of the country and had many encounters with his adversary Khalaf. In a battle for the relief of Sohar, in 1728. both leaders were killed. The origin, composition, and even the names of the modern Hinawi and Ghafiri factions are traceable to the tribal combinations formed in this civil war by the genius of Khalaf the Hinawi and Muhammad the Ghafiri. Since that time certain tribes have for political purposes changed their denomination. Ghafiris becoming Hinawis and vice versa. The present dynasty of the Albu Sa : d was founded in 1744 by Ahmad bin Said, who was elected Imam on account of his patriotism and bravery in expelling the Persians. The family acquired the title of ' Seyyids' which their descendants have used ever since. The gradual increase in the number of rival and aspiring ' Seyyids ' has been a fertile source of internecine feuds which have arrested the progress of the country. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spiri tual ruler of the country, had, in accordance with the prin ciples of the Ibadhi sect, been elected by the people. In 1/93, however, Seyyid Sultan usurped the throne and pro claimed himself Imam, thus dispensing with the formality of election, and causing the trbies to look on the titu lar ruler as an usurper. The transfer of the capital from Rostaq in the interior to Muscat on the coast, which took place about this time, relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control to which they had been accustomed. The relations with infidel foreign Powers which followed the transfer of the capital to Muscat and the progressive degeneration of the ruling house further weakened the position of the Sultan (as he now came to be called by the English) vis-a-vis the Omani tribes. A representative of a younger branch of the family set him self at their head but was overthrown -by the legitimate branch in 1871. Between that date and 1913 numerous rebellions took place against the Sultan whose survival% J 55 may fairly be said to have been due to the support ot His Majesty's Government. 3. Recent History. —In the years before the Great War tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the arms traffic, following upon the suppression of the slave trade, at the instigation of Great Britain. A carefully organized conspiracy followed and in May 1913 the Omani tribes rose in rebellion. Reinforcements were despatched from India in accord ance with a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895 and the Sheikhs of the interior were warned that attacks on Mus cat or Matrah, or indeed on ports of the Batinah Coast, would not be permitted. This warning was disregardeo and a large force of rebels under the so-called ' Imam' made an attack on the British outposts stationed at Beit-el-Felej in January 1915 and were heavily defeated. The Sultan, however, was not permitted to follow up the victory and regain possession of his lost territories, and by 1916 the rebels had obtained complete control of Oman proper and established a Govern ment, the nominal head of which is the self-styled u Imam '• The Imam was murdered by his followers in July 1920, and by September 1920 an agreement was reach ed involving recognition by the Sultan of the practical independence of the tribes of the interior. Broadly speaking the situation has stabilized itself and the tribes of Oman, while they would, without doubt, con stitute a menace were the support of His Majesty's Gov ernment withdrawn, have ceased, at least for the time being, to harass the Sultan's Government. The present Imam, Muhammad bin Abdullah al Khalili, is a puppet in the hands of Sheikh Isa bin Saleh his powerful sup porter—a shaikh of Al Harithi tribe. The relations between the Sultan of Muscat and the Imam of the Interior, who usually lives at Rostaq, are peculiar. The boundaries between the respective spheres of influence are not defined, but generally speaking the Sultan's influence is confined to the coastal strip and that of the Imam to the mountainous interior. A relative of156 the Imam is employed as a Wali by the Sultan. Corres pondence from the Imam to the Sultan and his Heir- Apparent is couched in terms of a loyal subject ; and no attempt has been made to establish the outward signs of a separate political entity. As an instance, passports to the Imam's subjects are issued by the Sultan. Since 1937 there have been indications that the Sultan is attempting to increase his influence with a number of tribal Sheikhs of the interior. Early in that year he returned to Muscat after an absence of sixteen months in his province of Dhofar, and by June he had concluded an agreement with Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., granting them an oil concession n his Arabian territory. This brought the Sultan financial aid, but the money would not last for ever, and if he was to receive future benefit from the oil concession, it was essential that the com pany should strike oil. Unfortunately the most promis ing areas were outside his control. It therefore became necessary to allow the company safe access to these areas. There were three methods open to the Sultan of achiev ing this object. Fighting the Iman, coming to some monetary arrangement with him, or undermining his in fluence. The Sultan preferred the last method. In 1937 the Sultan was visited by Sheikh Isa bin Salih, the most powerful supporter of the Imam. This Sheikh had not visited Muscat for many years and had never before been a guest of the Sultan. Since the Sultan's return from his world tour in July 1938 many important and unimportant tribal leaders from the interior have visited him in Muscat, and have received gifts and sub sidies. 1 he present (1939) situation is by no means clear, and although the Sultan's influence in the interior has increased, it cannot be said that as yet his policy has been successful. It appears that the Sultan proposes to continue his efforts until either his financial resources fail or the Iman has been forced to abdicate and he, owing to his increased influence, has been elected as the next Imam. He would then become in fact, as well as in name, Sultan of Muscat and Oman.Sit ft, and lis i inject; ni;: atflrj® ce, passps; iltan, tkafis tli a 111114 that y®. sixteen e !

Relations with neighbours. —The Sultan's relations with the Imam of Oman and the tribes of hinterland have been described in the preceding paragraph. In the Baraimi Oasis area, where the frontier is vague, the local Sheikhs, though theoretically subordinate to the Sultan, are virtually independent and show an incli nation to follow the advice of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi rather than that of the Sultan. Ibn Saud, separated by a sea of sand, the Rub al Khali, from Muscat and Oman has no effective relations with the Sultan. In Baluchistan the boundary of Gwadur has never been demarcated, and should this question arise over • an oil concession, it is likely to prove difficult to settle with the Khan of Kalat, the ruler of the adjacent territory. 5. Administration. —The Sultan of Muscat and Oman is His Highness Sir Saiyed Said bin Taimur, K.C.I.E., who was officially recognised by His Majesty's Government in 1932, when his father Sultan Saiyed Taimur bin Faisal abdicated in his favour. The internal administration of Muscat is conducted by an Advisory Council of Ministers. At first the Sultan preferred to reside in Dhofar taking scarcely any interest in the welfare of his country, and Saiyed Shahab, his uncle was nominally in charge of affairs in Muscat. The Sultan's conduct led to a certain amount of discontent in Muscat and the surrounding districts. However in 1937 the Sultan returned to Muscat and began taking an increased interest in the administration. In November of that year he left Muscat on a world tour, paying his first official visit to India and visiting Japan, America, England and the Continent of Europe. Since his return in 1938 he has taken a more active part in the affairs of his state. The tour probably brought home to him his true position, that he was a ruler in name and little else. He has recently appointed two Ministers, a Minister for Foreign Affairs and a Minister for the Interior.168 At the request of the Sultan's father, an Englishman was appointed Financial Adviser in 1925. He was a member of the Council, functioning as Finance Minister. The post has now been vacant for several years, but when the Sultan was in India he requested that a new financial adviser be appointed. In the interior the Imam of Oman, supported by two powerful Sheikhs, is in a strong position. The Sheikhs are independent of the Sultan and like the Imam have no connection with his administration. They control the interior themselves ,paying tribute to the Imam. How ever, as described in paragraph 3, since 1937 the influ ence of the Sultan in alfairs in the areas controlled by these men has definitely increased. 6. British Influence. —Although the Sultan of Muscat is in theory a wholly independent ruler, British influence has been predominant in Muscat since the end of the 18th century ; and in practice the relations which exist between the Sultan and His Majesty's Government and the Govern ment of India approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. His Majesty's Government and the Government of India have been represented in Muscat by the Political Agent since 1861, who since 1867 holds a commission as Consul for Muscat and also exercises the powers of a District Magistrate and Sessions Judge. Political control rests with the Government of India subject to the general con trol of His Majesty's Government. The Sultan receives an annual subsidy of Rs. 86.000 and has since 1912 received a further annual subsidy of 1 lakh, in compensation for losses arising out of the sup pression of the arms traffic. The Sultan has commercial treaties with the Govern ments of France, 1844 ; United States of America, 1833 ; Holland, 18/7 as well as with His Maiestv's Govern ment.159 Under the Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, the two Governments engage reciprocally to respect the inde pendence of the Sultan. Under his treaty, relations with Bis Majesty's Government the Sultan is pledged never to cede any of his dominions save to His Majesty's Government, nor to grant oil concessions without that Government's approval. He further gives certain faci lities to British ships and aircraft visiting his territories. A commercial treaty between the Sultan and His Majesty's Government was concluded in 1891. This treaty has been revised and a new -Treaty of Commerce and Navigation was signed in February 1939. The actual extent of the responsibility of His Majesty's Government for the protection of the territory of Oman against external aggression has never been detined. However they have recently reaffirmed their readiness to protect the Sultan's territories, including Gwadur, from any external aggression resulting from the present war. In addition, in the event of internal disturbances, they are prepared to give him such assistance as may be possible. In September 1939 the Sultan expressed his readiness to render such assistance as was within his power to His Majesty's Government. 7. Races. —The total population of Oman has been estimated at about half a million, of whom at least 30,000 are Bedouin. Seven-eighths or more of the popu lation are Arabs, the rest consisting partly of aboriginal tribes such as the Shihuh, partly of later immigrants re presented by Persian colonists the relies of former in vasions) Baluchis (from the Mekran Coast), Indian com munities at Muscat and Matrah and at most places on the coast, and a large negro element the outcome of several centuries of the slave trade. The Arabs of Oman belong to two distinct stocks, the Qahtani or Temeni who claim to be the earliest settlers, and the Adnoni or Nazari, the later immigrants, whose pedigree is regarded as less purely Arab.160 Each of these supposed racial groups is split up into a number of separate tribes and these again into sections and sub-sections. Throughout the whole of Oman faction feeling ^ strong, and political divisions are far more important than those of race. The two great political factions are the Hinawiyah and Ghaflriyah.' The origins of this political division have already been discussed. The two factions are intermingled throughout the coun try usually in groups of villages belonging to one tribe or section each maintaining a feud with neighbouring groups belonging to the rival faction. On the whole the Ghaflri yah predominate in the north-west districts and the Hina- wiyah in the south-east. The majority of the Hinawi tribes belong to the Ibadhi sect of Islam. A considerable proportion of the Ghaflri faction are orthodox Sunnis but a few such as the Beni Bu Ali and the Beni Rasib are Wahabis. 8.

Boundaries. —The word Oman, in its widest geogra phical meaning, is used to designate that part of the Ara bian continent which is enclosed between the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the Ruba -ul-Khali, or Great Desert of Southern Arabia. The Sultanate of Oman is not coincident with Oman in its geographical sense ; for Trucial Oman, the Baraimi Oasis and the Mahadhah tract are not included among the Sultan's possessions. On the other hand, the Gwadur Dis trict on the coast of Baluchistan, and the Dhofar District on the Southern Coast of Arabia from part of the Sultanate of Oman. The dominions of the Sultan of Oman, if taken as com prising also independent and semi-independent localities, extend along the coast from Tibbat, on the west side of the Musandam promontory, to Ras Dharbat Ali in Dhofar. A small strip on the east side of the promontory between Dibah and Khor Kalba belongs to the independent Shaikh- dom of Sharjah in Trucial Oman, and must be excluded. The northern land frontier on the side towards Baraimi is vague ; but may be plaSii at the watershed between Baraimi and the coast of the Uulf of Oman. The Ruba-ul-Khali, or Great Desert, forms the remainder of the land frontier. 2. Physical Geography. —Oman consists of three belt®. First, the low littoral extending for about 900 miles from 11 jbat on the western side of the Musandam peninsula, to Ras Dharbat Ali in Dhofar. From this must be excluded tvk 11 !, on the east coast of Ras Musandam from ibah to Khor Kalba, which is in the administration of e minor chiefs of the Trucial Coast. The coastal stripfoy 17' Taries in width from a few hundred yards to several miles. The secondhand chief, physical feature is a mountainous tract which, commencing at Ras Musandam, runs parallel to the coast and terminates in the vicinity of Ras-al-Hadd. From Ras Musandam to Dibbah this tract is called Ruus- ul-Jibal ; the remainder is known as the Hajar of Oman and is divided by the Wadi Semail, beyond Jebel Akhdar, into Eastern and Western Hajar. Hajar attains its maxi mum altitude (nearly 10,000 feet) in Jebel Akhdar, a group of lofty mountains south-west of Muscat, enclosing many valleys of great fertility. The third and inner belt is a long and uneven south westward declivity of the high lands which merges into the desert of the interior. The country is not regularly divided into administra tive areas but falls naturally into several distinct geogra phical tracts. Ruus-ul-Jibal and the two parts of Hajar form three territorial divisions, and between western Hajar and the sea is enclosed the long and narrow, but fertile and populous, maritime district known as Batinah. Im mediately east of the rich Wadi Semail the mountains of Hajar approach the coast in confused masses and beyond this again the range actually skirts the sea almost as far as Ras-ul-Hadd. The valleys of eastern Hajar are not so numerous, nor, with the notable exception of Wadi Tayin and Wadi Semail and their tributaries, generally so popu lous as those of western Hajar. Separated from the Batinah by western Hajar lie the two inland districts of Dhahirah and Oman Proper. Of these Dhahirah slopes westwards to the Ruba'-uI-Khali, while Oman Proper, a table-land rising 1,500 to 2,000 feet above the sea and practically surrounded, by hills, discharges its drainage towards the Indian Ocean. Inland of eastern Hajar are the districts of Sharqiyah and Ja'alan. Sharqiyah adjoins Oman Proper, while Ja'alan touches the south-east corner of Sharqiyah at one end and the Indian Ocean at the other.178 The barren and desolate coast from Ras-al-Hadd to Has Nus has no general name. Off it lie Masirah and the Kuria Muria islands. Beyond Ras Nus is the district of Dhotar consisting of a highly fertile maritime plain and surrounded by the crescent of the Samahan hills. Springs and streams abound in the hilly districts of Oman and in Ja'alan, but elsewhere the supply of water depends entirely on wells and varies in amount and quality. 3. Districts, (a) liuus-ul-Jibul. —A mountainous dis trict forming the northern part of the Oman Promontory. Its coast line runs from Ras Sha'am in the Persian Gulf round Ras Musandam to Dibah-Beiah in the Gulf of Oman. The Trucial frontier between Ras Sha'am and Dibah-Bei'ah form the southern boundary. The whole area is a maze of barren mountains which, on the eastern side, rise abruptly from the sea and form precipitous cliffs. The promontory is indented by numer ous deep water inlets, some of considerable extent. Two of them, viz., Ghubbah Ghazirah (or Malcolm Inlet) and Khor ash Sham (or Elphinstone Inlet) form line natural harbours, capable of sheltering a number of ships, but, owing to extreme heat, are impracticable as harbours during the hot weather for ships with European crews. The district is sparsely populated by the Shihuh tribe. Khor Qmvai at the extreme northern end of the peninsula- is a recreational base for the Persian Gulf Division of the Royal Navy. It is in an important strategical position a? it commands the entrance to the Persian Gulf, but in view of existing treaties with the Sultan of Muscat which respec. his independence it is not possible to establish more than s recreational base. There are certain shore establishments, and a 500 tor naval oil barge is based on Khor Quwai. Tlu anchorage is suitable as an alighting area for «««- planes and Imperial Airways flying boats.••C6' 79 The principal settlements are given in the tabl« helow :— Place. Position. Water supply.

(b) Batinah. —This is the most important coastal dis trict of the Sultanate extending for 150 miles along the coast from Khor Kalba to Hail-ul-Umair. Inland it extends to the foothills of western Ha jar, which run roughly parallel with the coast at a distance of 10 to 20 miles. The Batinah is famous for its date belt, which fringes the sea shore and in some places extends for 7 miles inland. Water is everywhere obtainable from wells the average depth of which is 15 to 20 feet. The district is populous and many tribes are represented. The chief of these are the Yal Sa'd and the Hawasinah. The Sultan maintains Walis or representatives at nine of the coastal towns.ggpHiPi 180 The principal settlements are :— Place. Position. Sohar. Water supply.

(c) Muscat. —The tract of country which surrounds th» town of Muscat may be conveniently treated as a separate district though it has no special name. Its limits may be regarded as the Wadi Samali on the west, and the Wadi Taiyin on the south, and the sea on the north and east. It thus has a length of 50 miles from west-north-west to east-south-east and a maximum breadth of about 25 miles. Most of its surface is barren and rugged but in places the country opens out into more or less level tracts. The argest plain is Saih Hattat. It is about 30 miles in ength and includes the upper basins of the Wadis Adai and I mm Jalas (Mijlas). Its greatest width is about miles. Ruwi village of about 50 stone houses and some u s is strategically important. It is approximately four and a half miles inland, north-west of Muscat, and at the end of the good motor road, capable of taking 30 cwt. lorries, which runs from Muscat through Matrah an(? passes the landing ground and barracks at Beit-el-Felej. uwi all rotues to the interior diverge. There is exten- sive cultivation and vegetables for the markets of Matrah and Muscat come from here. The principal towns are : Town. The capital of the Oman Sultanate and fmr r&lt; M, ,( ■ . ^ u 'tan. Inland the town is cut off ivmlT k if CJ \ IOr , ^ and precipitous hills of igneous inlmd f +v i eX en . 1 * en m iles along the coast to a depth and of three miles. The town of Muscat is built in th#183 18! level tal ■ mnt Ik tie fiiili basin formed by these hills at the head of the Bay of Muscat. Muscat consists of a walled town and an extensive col lection of unwalled suburbs. The town fronting the har bour is about half a mile in length from east to west and extends a quarter of a mile inland. The wall is built on the south and west sides and has towers at intervals. On the east side the hills are precipitous and no wall is neces sary. The main gate, is on the west side, the Bah-ul- Kebir, through which runs the motor road through the majority of the suburbs and to Matrah. The Bab-us- Saghir, on the road to the village of Sidab, is on the south side. On the seaward side are two forts built on cliffs, about 150 feet high, on either side of the beach in front of the town. They are of Portuguese construction and that oa the east side called Jalali is used as a jail. The one on the west side is called Mirani. They are now of no mili tary value. Small blockhouses command the approaches of the town from the land side. The water supply of the town comes from wells situated about half a mile up the Wadi-ul-Kebir which receives the drainage of the surrounding hills. The water, though plentiful, is slightly brackish. The water is stored in tanks joined by an aqueduct leading to the landing place south of Mirani fort. It can be supplied to ships by stand pipe. Many of the houses of the town are well-built structures of two or more storeys. The suburbs consist mostly of mud huts, but some of them contain a few fairly good houses. Post and Telegraph Offices have been established by the Indian Government. The town is connected by cable with Bushire and thus with all parts of the world. The British Agency and Consulate and the Sultan 's palace are situated on the sea front. South of the Consulate is the Agency hospital, and behind the Consulate in the town is the R. A. P. rest house and wireless station. A small electric light plant has recently been installed in the town.184 The R. A. F. landing ground and the barracks of the Levies are at Beit el Felej, four to five miles inland and are connected to Muscat by the only main route from the hinterland. A motor road running from there to Matrah and then winding along the edge of the sea and over a pass into Muscat town. The barracks are connected by telephone with the agency. .There is a R. A. F. bomb store at the landing ground. Here also is the only flat area available for a camping ground. The country in the immediate vicinity, in general is quite unsuitable for the use of armoured cars or mechanical transpoit. M. T. can be employed on the winding 1 road from .Muscat to Matrah and on to the landing ground area. The bay is three quarters of a mile deep and balf a miie wide, giving good anchorage for steamers. It is open to tho north-north-west and consequently to the Shamal wind. Matrah. A large town about two miles to the west of uscat. It is larger than the capital and is more import ant commercially, as it has direct communication with the interior. Like the capital, Matrah is enclosed by rugged ii s on the landward side but its isolation is less com plete. The town is built at the head of Matrah Bay and ex en s a ong the beach for about f mile and has an aver age (( {) i inland of i mile. It is protected on the land- -oT' J 1 6 i a fortified gateways, the principal ft e .

As around Muscat, blockhouses side U 6 a PP roac ^ les of the town from the landward ThA h «nh 0U f eS ^ a trah are meaner than those of Muscat. su burbs also are more squalid.185 Water of indifferent quality is obtained from wells around the town. The Bay of Matrah is less remarkable in appearance than the Bay of Muscat and is more easily entered. Though open to the north-east it is sheltered from the north-west and is preferred as a harbour by native craft. It has anchorage for steamers. The town is governed by a Wali on behalf of the Sultan. (d) Western Hajar. —The mountainous district of Western Hajar extends from Wadi-ul-Kor on the north west to Wadi Semail on the south-east, having a length of about 160 miles. The watershed of the range is roughly parallel to the coast and runs at an average distance of 40 miles inland. Its boundary on the seaward side is the line of its foothills rising from the plain of the Batinah. The boundary with the district of Dhahirah is indefinite. The mountain system rises to its highest in the mass of Jebel Akhdar at its south-east end which has an eleva tion of nearly 10,000 feet. There are no large towns in Western Hajar and the amall towns and villages are, with one or two minor excep tions, on the seaward side of the range. The most important valley in this district is the Wadi Para. The principal settlements are :— Place. Position. Water supply. Remarks. Iharaijah In Jebel Akhdar. Excellent water from Spring.

Its watershed, which is continuous with that of Western Hajar, is about 50 miles from the sea at the head of the Wadi Semail, but eastwards its dis tance from the coast diminishes until, in the neighbour hood of Sur, the watershed approaches within 20 miles of the sea. There is no continuous coastal plain such as that which separates Western Hajar from the coast, and for some distance near Daghman the foothills of Eastern Hajar stretch down to the sea. The hills maintain a comparatively high elevation over the greater part of the district, reaching 5,250 feet at the head of Wadi Tayin, and 6,300 feet inland of Kuryat ; but beyond Sur they fall away to 2,000 feet and die out altogether at Ras-ul-Hadd. The most important district of Eastern Hajar is the Wadi Semail ; it is the most populous and politically the most important valley in the Sultanate. The other import ant villages and settlements are all on the coast. The principal settlements are :— Place. Semail Position. Water supply. In Wadi Se mail.

Water is brought by slaves in earthem vessels from wells on the mainland. (k) Dhofar.—ln its widest sense Dhofar includes the whole coastal tract from Ras Nus westwards to a point beyond Kharifot. It has a length of 134 miles and maximum breadth inland of 20 miles. It consists of an irregular range of barren hills known as Jebel Samnan at no great distance from the sea, and a maritime plain. More properly the district of Dhofar is confined to the maritime plain from Khor Rori westward to Ras Risut a distance of some 30 miles. There is no large harbour in Dhofar and landing is difficult because of the surf. The principal settlements are on the coast and are the following ;— Place. Position. Water supply. Remarks.

Climate. —The climate of Oman is not unhealthy though the heat in summer is intense and the average rain fall scanty. At Muscat and along the sea coast generally the climate owing to its humidity is relaxing and oppressive «xcept in the coldest months. In winter from October to March cold and wet weather may be encountered, and malarial fever makes this season unhealthy. Muscat has the reputation of being one of the hottest towns in the world, and the thermometric observations present no cri terion for the actual intensity of the heat, which is here con centrated by the hills. The barren hills further sustain the heat throughout the day until midnight. The Batinah and the district round Sur is much cooler in summer, especially at night, than the rocky tract in which Muscat lies. In the interior the summer heat is dry and oppressive and hot land winds prevail. The ordinary annual rainfall in Oman varies between 3 and 6 inches but occasionally violent storms sweep over the country. The prevailing winds in the Gulf of Oman in the winter months during the north-east monsoon are Shamals and Nashis. The general direction of the Shamal is north-west hut it changes with the trend of the coast. Its usual dur ation is three days but it may last seven. The Nashi is a north easterly wind which blows very violently in the Gulf. During winter south-east winds called Qaus or ' Sharki ' alternate with the Shamals, but only have great force from December to April. These winds often arise suddenly and are much dreaded by native craft ; and, owing to the fact that most harbours in the Gulf are unsheltered, it is neces sary for steamers to keep steam up while they are in port. The south-west monsoon is not felt inside Ras-Al-Hadd and only light variable winds prevail between June and Septem ber. Muscat and Matrah have the most sheltered anchorages on the Arabian coast, but landing of men and material would be much interfered with during a strong wind from any direction and may in the case of a Shamal or Nashi be held up altogether. a202 Weather is the ruling factor in landing operation! at every place along the shores of Oman, as with the excep tion of Muscat and Matrah every anchorage is exposed to winds from any direction.204 6. Health.—Prevalent illnesses and diseases. —The follow ing list shows the illnesses and diseases prevalent in Oman. They are given in the order of their incidence. Endemic— (1) Eye diseases. (2) Malarial fevers—all types. (3) Skin diseases. (4) Septic sores. (5) Digestive disorders. (6) Venereal diseases. (7) Tuberculosis (in over-crowded localities such as Muscat and Matrah). Epidemics. —Up to March 1930 no epidemic of plague had occurred for the previous 16 years. The last epidemie of small-pox occurred in 1922. Sporadic cases are common along the Batlnah coast during the summer months. Cholera is infrequent, no cases having occurred for some years. Quarantine regulations are carried out at the port of Muscat in accordance with the Paris Sanitary Convention of 1926. The Political Agency Surgeon acts as quarantine medical officer. Insects. —Mosquitoes are numerous during winter parti cularly in the towns. The practice of storing water obtain ed from wells in cisterns and in earthenware vessels in houses as well as pools in gardens afford ample breeding places for mosquitoes. Flies are a pest during the cooler months but die off when the temperature rises in the hot weather. 7. Hospitals. —The Agency hospital is south of the Consulate in Muscat town. It is of 20 beds, two of which are reserved for Europeans. It has an out dispensary. The hospital is in change of the Agency Surgeon, an officer oi the Indian Medical Department ; assisted by an Indian Sub-Assistant Surgeon. There is an American Mission Hospital maintained by Missionaries at Matrah, with a Zenana Hospital in Muscat.205 CHAPTER III. C ommunications. 1. Telephone and Cable. —There is no inland telegraphic communication. The only telephone system exists at Muscat. It consists of a number of private lines. The most important con nect the wireless station, British Consulate, landing ground and the headquarters of the Levies at Beit-el-Felej, 5 miles away. There are at least seven lines between Muscat and Matrah belonging to merchants. There is a Government of India Post Office in the Consulate. The Cable office is situated just westward of the Con sulate. Muscat is a ' repeater ' station on the main cable route between Karachi and Bush ire. 2. Wireless. —The station is situated in Muscat town just behind the Consulate. The details are : Frequencies. Service. Remarks. 268 , 13,333 ; 6,666 Local air, ground mobile and point to point. As above, also long range point to point. Under R.A.F., opera tional control using service call signs and equip ment. The Cable and Wireless Company hope shortly to erect a wireless station. 3. Air Communications. —There are a number of Royal Air Force landing grounds in the territory of the Sultan, and an Air Facilities Agreement exists which gives certain faeihties to British aircraft. The Sultanate is important as it lies along the air route from Iraq and India to Aden. At present (1939) Imperial Airways do not land in territory of the Sultan. But an anchorage suitable for206 their Empire flying boats exists at Khor Quwai, in the extreme north of the Oman peninsula, and may be taken into use as an alternative to Dibai on their route to India. Until 1938, Gwadur on the southern coast of Baluchistan was a regular halting place for the refuelling of Imperial Airways flying boats. In that year it was abandoned in favour of an anchorage at Jiunri, 35 miles to the west. The following are the landing grounds and seaplane anchorages in the territory of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. All except the first three and Gwadur are on the R. A. F. route to Aden :— Khor Quwai.—A possible alighting area for flying boats. No facilities, but shore establishments belonging to the recreational base of the R. N, Shinas. —R. A. F. maintained landing ground 1,200 by 400 yards to the south of the town. Circle and corner markings and a fuel and oil store. Sohar. Emergency landing ground two miles north of the fort, 1,200 by 800 yards. Circle markings. No fuel. Exposed anchorage off the town. Muscat. R. A. F. landing ground at Beit-el-Felej, four miles inland to the west of the town. It is a small landing ground difficult to get into owing to the surrounding hills. Circle and corner markings. There is a R. A. F. petrol, (&lt;il and bomb store. Telephone and motor road to Muscat. The seaplane anchorage with three buoys is in Muscat arbour north-west of Fort Mirani. Petrol and oil store. There is a R. A. F. W.|T. station and rest house and a cable station. Bandar Jissah. An. alternative seaplane anchorage to Muscat. Petrol and oil from Muscat. RJior Jarama. An excellent seaplane anchorage in a agoon. 1 etrol and oil maintained in a R. A. F. supply an . A possible landing ground to the east of the lagoon. -A landing ground, 950 by 750 yards, _ Sltuated 1,000 yards west of the cape. It has a circle an corner markings. Fuel would have to be brought rrom Khor Jarama.207 Masira Island. —The landing ground, 600 by 500 yards, is three miles south of Umm Rasas. There is a R. A. F. fuel store on the island. A seaplane anchorage between the island and the main land. Khor Milh. —A possible anchorage exists. Khor Garim. —Landing ground 250 by 400 yards by Subra Bay. Circle and corner markings. Possible sea plane anchorage in bay. Shuwainiya. —New landing ground recently constructed by R. A. F. no details are available. Murbat. (Dhofar).—Landing ground 600 by 300 yards half a mile east of village. Circle and corner markings. Petrol store. Seaplane anchorage close to the north shore of the bay. Khor Rori. —Possible anchorage 15 miles west of Murbat. Salalah. —Landing ground 1,000 by 1,000 yards, one mile north of village. Circle and corner markings. Gwadur. —On south coast of Baluchistan. Anchorage used regularly by Imperial Airways until 1938. 4. Sea Communications. —Muscat is a port of call for the B. I. S. N. Coy.'s subsidiary weekly mail service. Other companies such as Stricks, Ellerman City and Hansa lines call approximately monthly. The types of craft available locally and used in the fishing and coastal trade, are as follows :— Bedan, average of 8 to 10 tons, will take twenty men or six mules. Bagalahs are large sea going craft trading to Indian ports, Zanzibar, etc. They are from 100 to 200 tons capacity and are also called Khashbah. Sambuk is the name given to craft of between 60 and 70 tons capacity. There are also some barges at Muscat and Matrah which will each take forty men or twelve mules. r 5. Port Facilities. —Muscat and Matrah are the main ports, they are two miles apart. There are three har bours or bays. iH208 Muscat Cove at the head of which lies the town, is a good harbour but open to any winds between the north west and north-east. It is thus exposed to the shamals. The holding ground is good. It is 9 to 13 fathoms at ths entrance shoaling gradually to two fathoms at about a cable from the head of the cove. Kalbuh Cove is to the west of Muscat Cove. It is eight to four fathoms deep in the outer part, but this part is not used for anchorage as it affords little shelter. In the inner part the depth is from four to one fathom. Matrah bay is west of Kalbuh cove with the town at its head. It is a good anchorage, sheltered from the shamal but open to the north-east wind. At both Muscat and Matrah steamships of large draught can anchor, but the port facilities are very pi 'imitive. The only pier is the coaling one in Muscat cove extending from the coal sheds with four feet of water at its outer end. The coal sheds are now (1939) in ruins and no coal is stored there. There is no inland communication from the pier. There are two wharves at Muscat, one under Fort Mirani is 180 feet long, with steps on the south and east sides. There is at least four feet of water at both steps, ihe other is the customs wharf, 200 feet long, it has no steps and is almost dry at low water. There are no lifting appliances. ^ ater can be supplied to ships by stand pipe from an aqueduct at the wharf below Mirani Fort. It can also be supplied to vessels at anchor in a water lighter of 45 tons capacity. Landing can also be effected on the beach from local craft. At Muscat the beach is only fifty yards wide and enclosed by buildings. The best place to land is in front of the Agency. The beach at Matrah is spacious and landing from local craft would be simpler and easier here than at Muscat as the bay is more sheltered. At Muscat winds of any torce send in ^ a considerable swell. Ramps constructed of locally obtained material called Da'an could be erected on the Matrah beach. The British force sent to Oman* 209 in 1913 and in 1915 landed at Matrah, but at that tuao there were no wharves at Muscat. Landing in boats in calm weather is also possible in a small cove to the west of Matrah bay. Sandy beaches exist and the village of Shataifi is at the head of the cove. At every other place along the coast, ships have to lie well-off the shore and anchorages are nowhere sheltered. Everything would have to be discharged into local craft and landed on the beach. The following are possible landing places and local facilities available. This list was compiled in 1932, the number of craft available must be taken as only approxi mate. one w' siii^ 1 Place.

N ote.— The number of craft given above are those of the total numbers registered at the different ports in 1932. These being engaged in the fishing and coastal trade are not therefore all available at one time. Rowing boats called ' Hori' are available at all places m the rough proportion of 2 or 3 to a bedan. 6. Roads. —The rugged nature of the Ha jar of Oman makes communication difficult between the coastal towns and the interior. Physical features and the necessity for water confine such tracks as exist to a few well defined routes. These in general follow boulder strewn wadis.212 Around Muscat the country is quite unsuitable for armoured cars or mechanical transport. The follo-mng routes are fit for ears and light lorries. A good motor road runs from Muscat over a pass to Matrah, two miles, winding through that town, it passes the landing ground and barracks at Beit-el-Felej, three miles, to Ruwi four miles. From Ruwi the road becomes the main route to the hinterland, and has been used by light cars. Up to Ruwi it is fit for 30 cwt. lorries. A track passable for cars which could be improved to take light lorries runs north from Matrah along the coast to Sohar and Shinas. This journey can be done in a day. A second track runs south from Ruwi along the coast to Sur. This can be used with some difficulty by motor traffic as far as Quryat, 56 miles. The above three roads are the only approaches to Muscat and Matrah by land. The only other way of approaching is by goat tracks over the precipitous hills. In the Winter of 1938 an exploration party of the Oil Company motored to Baraimi Oasis by the route in the interior and returned to Muscat by Sohar and the coast route. The motor traffic on the later route has now (1939) increased considerably. For a detailed report of the main routes see Part II. 7. Transport available.- —The only means of transport is by camel and donkey. Transport inland from Muscat and Matrah is carried on by means of pack animals and is expensive and difficult owing to the rugged hills of the interior. About 50 camels and 100 donkeys can be col lected at a few hours notice in the region of the larger towns. More could be collected at longer notice. In Muscat town there are about 24 motor cars available, mostly old four cylinder Fords. There is no wheeled tramc mtside Muscat or Matrah.f 2*§ 213 CHAPTER IV. R esources. 1. Water Supply, —Springs and streams abound in the billy districts of Oman and in Ja'alan, but elsewhere the supply of water depends entirely on wells and varies in amount and quality. The water available at the ports along the coast is plentiful and good, although the extent available varies in summer and winter. The tables in Chapter II show the normal state of the water supply in the different areas, the information therefore can be only approximate. Muscat and Matrah obtain their water from wells around the towns which collect the water from the suav rounding hills. In Muscat there are tanks for the storage of drinking water and an aqueduct leading to the wharf south of Mirani Fort. Water can be supplied to ships alongside by stand pipe and there is a water lighter of 45 tons capacity to supply vessels at anchor. 2. Camping Grounds. —There are no billeting faci- lities in either Muscat or Matrah, neither is there any space near the towns for a camp. The nearest camping ground is in the area of the landing ground at Beit-el- Felej, three and a half miles inland, where the Levies have their barracks. Between here and Ruwi village, approximately one mile, there is ample flat ground, good and plentiful water being available from five wells in the vicinity. At Ruwi is an extensive market and cultiva tion supplying Muscat with vegetables. There is ample fuel and date palms grow in the area. An infantry brigade could easily camp here. Other possible camping grounds, all capable of taking an infantry brigade are at :— Sohar. —Between the palms and the beach, or north west of the town by the landing ground. Water is plentiful from numerous wells. Fuel is unlimited. A little lucerne wheat and sugar are grown. Sheep ar« plentiful.214 Shinas. —In the area of the landing ground to the south of the town. There is excellent water from wells. Fuel is unlimited. There are a few sheep and goats. Sur. —On a ridge called Eed overlooking the oasis and village of Belad-es-Sur from the east, two miles south west of Sur. Water is obtained from numerous wells in the oasis. Limited quantities of lucerne and vegetables are grown. 3. Oil. —In 1937, Petroleum Concessions, Ltd., secured two concessions from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. The first was for the Dhofar district of Oman, a mari time plain some 30 miles long by 5 miles broad lying almost in the centre of the south coast of Arabia, the second was for the remainder of the Sultan 's Arabian territory. Both concessions were granted for 75 years. During the Winter of 1938-39 a reconnaissance of the Dhofar area took place, and an exploration party of the Company proceeded to Baraimi Oasis from Muscat, by the hinterland route returning by Sohar and the coast. No immediate results were achieved and at the present stage (1939) it is impossible to say what prospects exist of finding oil in the Sultanate. Apart from the supply of petrol and oil maintained by the Royal Air Force, the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company maintain a small depot of petrol and paraffin at a cove in Riyam Bay. Average quantities of stocks held are 6,000 gallons of petrol and 12,000 gallons of kerosene. 4. Supplies. —The local resources in Oman are, for practicable purposes negligible. The country is barren in the extreme and except for the dates and fuel produces nothing. The aridity of the soil except on the Batineh coast will not support the growth of cereals. These are imported from India in quantities sufficient only for the needs of the population. The Batineh is the most fertile area and is celebrated for its dates, which should be procurable in vast quan tities during the harvest season, and in lesser quantities throughout the year. Other crops gro 11 !' irley, sugar and lucerne. Fruits grown include jiiangoes, bananas, figs, limes and melons. All sueh supplies andJ24 216 Tegetables would be available in small quantities at any given point. Vegetables are grown in quantities for local consumption at Ruwi, which supplies vegetables for the markets of Matrah and Muscat, and as it h/as a large water supply this cultivation could be extended. A limited quantity is available at Quryat, Sur and at the ports on the Batineh up to Sohar. The following vegetables are obtainable at Matrah and Muscat. Brinjal, broad beans, pumkin, cucumber, water melon and melon. There are no supplies of cattle. Goats are fairly plentiful, the local supply being supplemented by im ports from the Makran coast. In the Batineh, cattle, sheep and goats in limited numbers can be had at the larger villages. There is no grazing for horses. Small quantities of lucerne are obtainable at Ruwi, Sur, Quryat, Sib and Sohar. Fish in considerable quantity is available at the coastal towns and villages. A force of any size landing in Ota an would therefore be dependent for all supplies, except fuel, on an over seas base. Sufficient supplies, however, should always be available in Muscat bazaar and in the larger towns to feed two companies of Indian Infantry for about one month without further imports. Local supplies at most villages in the Batineh would be sufficient for one com pany for a short period. 5. Fuel. —The main source of supply of fuel is the Batineh coast, where unlimited timber and scrub is avail able. Wood is exported from here to the Trucial Coast and to Iranian ports. The acacia bush called ' sumr ' grows everywhere *nd is used as fuel. Ulttu a - ; iB216 CHAPTER V. The Armed Forces. 1. The Sultan's Forces. —The forces of the Sultan • ob - ■ist of the Muscat Levies, a small police force in Muscat and Matrah, and Arab irregular guards. The Muscat Levies are at present (1939) 150 strong, including the Sultan's personal guard of 40. This strength will possibly be increased on receipt of additional modern equipment. Until July 1938 they were commanded by a British Officer, assisted by an ex-Indian Army tsubedar. The Sultan had to dispense with the services of the Bri tish Commandant mainly for financial reasons. It it proposed, and the Sultan wishes, that the Commandant of the Levies should be a serving Indian Officer of the Indian Army. The Levies are all Baluchis and are not likely to be affect ed by local propaganda or disputes. They can be trusted to be loyal to the Sultan in an emergency. Their discipline and efficiency has improved considerably in the last threi years. The Muscat Levies are armed with the following mixture of rifles and variety of automatic weapons :— Rifles— Modern short service .. .. 45 Old long rifle, firing mark VI, ammunition ISO 1 Automatics— Vickers machine gun .. .. 1 Maxims. .. _ &gt; &lt; ^ g Lewis gun .. t &gt; # _ g Berthier .. 1 Guns— Hodgkiss 3 pounders, mounted on lorries .. ^ Ammunition— Hodgkiss 3 pounders .. .. 200 S. A. A., Mark VI and VII mixed, approximately .. ., .. 200,000KEG II 217 It is proposed now (1939) to increase the efficiency of Ihe Levies by the addition of the following arms and immunition for their re-equipment :— Modem Service Rifles and bayonets L. M. Q-. (Bren) .. 2-75 in. guns First Aid equipment Ammunition— S. A. A. 2-75 in. 3 pounder 300 2 2 1 set. 350,000 . np to 226 H. E. np to 125 Shrapnel. 250 An annual allowance of ammunition will be made for training purposes. In addition the Sultan wishes to obtain four light lorries. The barracks of the Muscat Levies is at Beit-el-Felej, three and a half miles north-west of Muscat and con nected to the Consulate by telephone. There are guards at the Consulate and Treasury in the town. There is a small regular police force of approximately twenty local police, who would be of value in preventing Babotage in the town of Muscat. 2. Training. —The efficiency of the Levies has increased considerably in the last few years. In order further to increase its efficiency it has been proposed that two more Indian Officers should proceed to Muscat to assist in the training, particularly of the mountain battery which is to be formed on receipt of the two 2*75 in. guns, and that selected N. C. O.'s of the Levies should be sent to India to undergo courses in weapon training and tactics. The proposed Regular Army Adjutant and Permanent Staii Instructor at Bahrein will visit Muscat annually and give general tactical and weapon training instruction. 3. Irregulars. —These are Arab irregular police guards called Askars found from retainers of local chiefs. They have no uniform and are distributed in small posts all I218 over Oman. They are armed with a variety of rifles, ani would be of doubtful value in an emergency. The tribes of Oman are in possession of about 20,000 rifles of all types, but it is believed very few magazino rifles are held. These tribes are scattered and do not naturally co-operate. For this reason and owing to the difficulties of maintaining forces in the field, it is impro- bable that more than a few thousand men could be induced to advance on Muscat, or more than 500 could b« collected for any protracted campaign. The population of Muscat and Matrah towns are not of fighting stock and would be of little value as soldiers.222 2. Detailed Reports.— ROUTE No. 1. KUWAIT to ZOBEIR ( in IRAQ).

(For continuation of this route to ABU DHABI sec Route No. 10. ) ROUTE No. 17. MUSCAT to MURAIR via SIB, SOHAR and SHINAS. Distance :—194 miles. Stages 11. 1. General Report. —The route is fit for cars, light M. T. and field guns. It was originally a camel track but in 1932 work on it was completed. The work done being a widening of the path through scrubs among the palms, and building a stony track over soft sand. It is now used regularly by light cars, and in the winter of 1938 an exploration party of the oil company in cars and light lorries returned from Baraimi to Muscat via Sohar. Lhe journey in a ear from Muscat to Sohar takes approximately 8^ hours. Alter getting clear of the hills around Muscat and Matrah, where the track rises and falls very steeply, and getting clear ol the sandhills between the wadi Boshar and the sea coast, the track runs through a tract of land known as Al Batinah for the remainder of the route. The whole of the Al Batinah is low lying plain, sandy towards the sea, clayey in the interior, and stony as the mils are^ approached. It is celebrated principally for its tes which are grown in an enormous palm belt that lun.-i parallel to the sea along the whole extent of its coastlme. The route runs through the middle of this jelt, and rarely does it leave the shelter of its palms.^ imm The limiting factor to the load and size of vehicles is ■chiefly the loose surface encountered in the many wadi beds that have to be crossed as they come down from the mountains to the sea. Heavy traffic could be got through, but only with great difficulty. There are no bridges or culverts. 9 Water. —Except for springs along the hill side of the wadi Boshar, the entire water supply along the route is from the numerous wells found m the palm belt (which are usually from 15 to 20 feet in depth) and from the 'more shallow wells in the wadi beds. Irom which the best water is obtained. The supply is un- limited throughout the route. In many of the wells among the palms the water is slightly salty, but usually fit for drinking purposes. 0. Supplies. —As already mentioned, the Batinah is celebrated for its elates, which should be procurable m vast quantities during the harvest season, and m lesser quantities throughout the year. Other crops grown are wheat, barley, sugar and lucerne, and some tobacco m the north-westernmost villages. Fruits include man goes. bananas, pomegranates, figs, limes, melons, quinces, olives, and almonds. All such supplies would only be available in small quantities at any given pomt. insh is a'so avai'ab'e among the coastal villages. Cattle, sheen and goats can also be had at the larger villages and'towns, sufficient for two companies at moderate notice. Local supplies at most villages would be sufficient for one company during a protracted period. 4. Fuel. —Unlimited timber and scrub is available throughout the route, except in the earlier stages before entering the Batinah, where sufficient is available for two companies. There are no petrol or oil supplies except at Muscat and Matrah. 5. Transport. —Native sailing craft are available at most of the coastal towns, at the rate of a ou o ^ per port, usually of the ' baqarah type. ame s an donkeys can be collected at a few hours ri()1( * ^ inn region of the larger towns, ranging from about 50 to 100248 of each. More could be collected at longer notice There is no wheeled transport outside Muscat or Matrah. 6. Grazing. Except during the first two stages, where grazing is scanty, there is good grazing throughout the route at all seasons. 7. Obstacles. —The only real obstacle is encountered during the first stage of the route, consisting of the mountain range that has to be crossed between Muscat and Matrah. The gradients at this point are steep, and the track precipitious. The only other obstacles are the loose surfaced wadi beds that are constantly being encount ered, making passage difficult for heavily loaded vehicles^ 8. Camping and Landing Grounds. —There are landing grounds at Beit Al Felaj and Sohar. Apart from these two points there are no other possible areas, except a patch between Abu Nahail and Birkah, at about mile 49 where an emergency landing ground could be made by clearing away some soft stemmed shrubs. Similarly the route does not lend itself to camping grounds. Dependent upon the size of the force to be accommodated, choice would have to be made between the sea shore and the open ground inland of the palm belt, ihe former would be nearer to the towns, and the latter more suitable for larger forces. The site should be chosen aecess^to wells'! t0 • ' n0t ^ ' Wadi bed £or ^ availa C brrrnareTam^ 0 Sf t meanS H 0f c0, ? mm i ca ' 0tt messengers sailing craft, or by camel or donkey in ^L^lr a i~ Tll | . main tactical Problems are involved Z npL' St f a ^ betwe ^ Muscat and Boshar.

General Report. —This route is fit for all forms of motor traffic as far as Rnwi (4m.) and for motor ears up to Quryat (56 m.) which place can be reached in approxi mately 4 hours. After Quryat the route is unsuitable for wheeled traffic, but it is proposed to make it a through motor road which will entail a great deal of work. The most difficult part of the route is between Quryat and Dhibab when it traverses mountainous country intersected by steep wadis. Thence to Sur the coastal plain is traversed ; though this is cut up by many wadis with rough, steep approaches. In places unshod donkeys have to be assisted while shod animals would have great diffi culty. After Quryat distances are computed by time.

A.—KUWAIT. 1. Currency. The Indian Rupee has been the currency since 1911 when it replaced the Maria Theresa Dollar or Rival. The latter however is still largely used and of necessity in all transactions with the Bedouin of the interior The Rupee—Riyal exchange for May 1930 stood at 85 f Riyals to 100 rupees. This is liable to considerable fluctuation. 2. Weights. The ordinary un : t of weight is the waqiyah of which there are 3 kinds, viz., one of 4 lbs. 10-22 oz another of 4 lbs. 15-168 oz., and a third of 9 lbs 4-44 oz being respectively the weight of 75, 80, and 150 Maria baseT 8 DolIarS (Kiyals ) on wllich coi n the Waqiyah is The Waqiyah of 4 lbs. 15-168 oz,, is used by the local customs for imports from the desert only.

The Kara is also used for the sale of date P a ^ branches (used for hutting) in which sense it equals 25 branches. Kuwait stone is sold by the Tishalah or lighter load, averaging 150 cubic feet. The 4 gallon kerosine and petrol tin is used as ^ measure of capacity principally for the sale of water, but ghee, fab, and dibs', or date syrup, are also some times sold by the tin. The price of a tin of water is 2 annas. 3. Measures. —The unit of length is the Dhra'or cubit of 18 inches. The war, or yard, is also used. Tt is ^ for cotton and woollen goods and for some kinds of plank- ing. Also used for measuring masonry work. For beams and masts; 1 Calicut Kandy=:10 cubie feet 29 cubic inches. For round rafters (bullies) or spars ; 1 Korjah = l score. For boat ribs ; 1 Gari or cartload of 40 pieces. Rope is normally sold by the Ba' or fathom, the full span of the arms.' There is no square measure mu^, H plot of ground is described as being so many according to the sum of its sides.268 B.—BAHREIN 1. Currency. The Indian rupee is the currency of Bahrein. Pearl divers are sometimes paid in the Rival (or Maria Theresa dollar) and also in Turkish gold liras or £ sterling. The general term in use for money ' in Bahrein is ' flusthough ' gawazi ' is sometimes heard. There is a branch of the Eastern Bank at Bahrein and all classes of business are transacted. 2. Weights— (а) -i mithqals equal to 1 tola (equivalent to weight of Re. 1). 40 tolas equal to 1 rutl —1 lb. 4 rutls equal to 1 ruba = 4 lbs. 7 rubas equal to 1 nusf mann == 28 lbs. 2 nusf mann or 14 rubas equal to 1 mann — 56 lbs. 10 manns equal fco 1 rafa = ^ ton. 18 manns equal to 1 kara = :4i tons. The above weights are used for commodities such as ghee, grains, flour, sugar, coffee. The last two, the rafa' and kara are used for wood, fish and salt in bulk. (б) Other local weights are— 16 mithqals equal to 1 qiyas equivalent to If rutl or lbs. Av. - qiyas equal to 1 alf equivalent to rutls or lbs. 16 alfs equal to 1 mann equivalent to 56 rutls or lbs. - manns equal to 1 cwt. (bunder Indian word) equivalent to 1 cwt. 12 manns equal to 1 pundy equivalent to 673 rutls or lbs., 6 cwts. 40 manns equal to 1 ton equivalent to 2,240 lbs. or 1 ton.(J S2 269 (c) A special measure for dates, is the galla— 40 waznas equal to 1 galla. 4 gallas or 10 Bahrein manns or 1 rafa (i ton English) equal to 1 Hasa mann. 1 galla Qatif equal to 16 Bahrein ruha's or 64 lbs. (d) The carrying capacity of local craft is described in terms of ' gallas '— 1 galla (a basket of dates) = 2 manns or 1 cwt. 20 gallas equal to 1 ton. Therefore a vessel said to have capacity of 200 ' gallas ' would in English terms have a capacity of 1|20 of 200 i.e., 10 tons. 3. Measures— (а) 1 dhra (standard of measure) equal to 18 ins. 2 dhras equal to 1 war or yard. 2 yards or from tip to tip of the outstretched arms equal 1 ba' or fathom. Also used— 1 shibr {i.e., span) approx. equal to 9 ins. 2 Shibrs equal to 1 dhra. (б) Distances by road are described in farasakhs (farasakh = 3 miles) but more commonly iu hours (sa'at). (c) Among date cultivators a rather loose measure of time is in use called Wadha. It serves to denote the period during which a cultivator may use all the flow from a common spring. The ' wadha ' is the space of 12 daylight hours, and is divided into | wadha J wadha i wadha, etc, (d) At sea, watches called 'zam' (pi,, ''za-wam') are used, ' zam ' is a four hour watch.270 The first watch is that from sunset (Arabic 12 o'clock) to 4 o'clock (Arabic). When coast ing in sight of land the ' zam '' is 12 farsakhs = 36 miles (calculated by distance between landmarks), C.—HASA. 1. Currency. —In the Hasa ports the riyal and the Turkish gold lira are current but the Rupee is also accept ed. The Government of Ibn Saud has now standardised the riyal at 40 qirsh or 160 tawilahs. Qirsh are minted in coins of ;— 1 qirsh minted 4 tawilahs. i qirsh minted 2 tawilahs. i qirsh minted 1 tawilah. The tawilah of Hasa, a brass piece shaped somewhat like a nail and equivalent to i anna or 2 bezas, is dropping out of the currency, but is still used in computation. The Muscat beza is now found in use in Qatif and Jubail only. 2. Weights— (а) 1 ruba equal to (weight of) 12 dollars (riyals). 32 rubas equal to 1 qiyasa. 6 qiyasa or pi. quiyis equal to i mann. 24 qiyasa equal to 1 mann. (б) The following weights are used exclusively for rice and wheat grown in Hasa :— 1 mosumiya rice in husk equal to 10 qiyis. 1 mosumiya wheat equal to 12 qiyasa. 3. Measures. —As for Bahrein. D.—TRUCIAL OMAN. The currency, weights and measures of the States of Trucial Oman approximate those of their neighbours.271 E.—OMAN. 1. Currency. —The currency of the country is predo minantly the silver Maria Theresa dollar called '' nyal ' and the Muscat copper coin called ' beza ' (a corruption of the Indian word ' paisa '). The principal silver coin in use in Muscat and Matrah is the Rupee which would also be accepted in all places along the Batinah and now-a-days in most places inland. The generic term in common use for money is 'gawazi plural of ' gazi originally a Persian copper coin no longer in general use but which still circulates in Ja'alan. The value of the dollar fluctuates according to fluctua tions in the price of silver, and that of the Rupee accord ing to the requirements of local merchants. The table given below shows the fluctuations in the rate of exchange during the years 1927, 28, 29, and the first three months of 1930. Rupee exchange per 100 dollars. Year. Maximum. Minimum 100 per dollarsj 1927 Rs. 133 (June) Rs. 126 (May). 1928 Rs. 132 (September) Rs. 125 (December), 1929 Rs. 126 (January) Rs. 104 (December). 1930 (first 3, months). Rs. 103 (January) Rs. 90 (March).10 manns—1 farasilah. 200 manns = 1 bahr. (N ote .—Kiyas are sub-divided into half, quarter, and eights of a Kiyas ; and the Mann is divid ed into half and quarter manns). (6) Ihe ' farasilah' is used exclusively for weighing dates. The dates are packed in reed baskets of 1, 1^, and 2 farasilahs. also used only for dates in Muscat and Matrah. (c) There is a 'bahr' of 400 manns used for weighing wood fuel in Muscat and Matrah ; and for weighing salt in all places. (d) For rice, grain, sugar, and commodities sold by the sack, the ' gonia ' (pi. gowani) is used. 1 gonia = 160 lbs. (locally). 15 gonias=:l ton (approximately). (N ote .—1 gonia of flour) = 196 lbs. (e) The ' palli' and 'farah' (wooden bowls) are sometimes used in Muscat and Matrah for measuring cereals in small quantities. 40 pallis^rl farah. 20 farahs = 1 khondi. (/) In addition to the above there are local weights for fuel in the Batineh, the chief source of supply. They are very approximate. 1 Waznah=45 manns, or the approximate weight of three men. 10 waznah^rrrrl murr or 450 mann. 4 muri^l kara or about 1800 mann. These weights undergo some variation in Sohar where— 1 waznah = :40 manns. or roughly the weight of two men and a boy. 10 waznah = l mur, or 400 manns. 4 mur —1 kara, or about 1600 manns.274 (g) Wcio-hts and Measures vary somewhat from place to place. Lorimer (Gazetteer, Persian Gulf) notes that the kiyas of the interior is only a quarter of the Muscat kiyas, and the same holds good for the mann. In the interior there is a weight called the ' sa'a' (pi. sa'at):=r:7i kiyas, and another called the Makiyal (pi. Maka 'il) equal to 12 kiyas or half a mann. In Sur the kiyas = 9 dollars or 8'9062 oz, 1 Suri mann = 24 kiyas or 13 • 3593 lbs. 1 Suri Palli = 4 Muscat Palli. 3. Measures. —The standard measure of length is the ' DhiraThis is the cubit, i.e., the distance from a man's elbow to the point of his middle finger. It is fixed at 19 inches. The following are also in common use :— 1 Shibr == l palm (of the hand) or 4^ inches. 1 ba 'a =4 dhiras or 6 feet 4 inches. The Shibr in some places is the span ; and the fatr the ' short span ' the space between the thumb and the fore finger when extended.275 APPENDIX II. Maps.
