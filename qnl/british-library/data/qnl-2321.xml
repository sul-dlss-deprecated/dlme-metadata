Office of the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, Sir, 27th June 1919. With reference to my telegram No. 10460, dated the 29th November 1918, I have the honour to enclose herewith a draft Notification which, with the concurrence of the General Officer Oommanding-in-Chief, I propose to issue, if its terms meet with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. 2. Du ring the course of the war a large number of applications to take up land in Mesopotamia have been received from officers and men of this Force, many of them of a class whose presence in the country could not be otherwise than desirable, and with every qualification, both as regards financial backing and training, for successful work. 3. There is &lt;it present plenty of room for such persons, and local landowners whom I have consulted are in favour of encouragement being given to selected applicants to settle here, in the belief that much useful experimental work would be done by them from which local landowners would benefit. 4. Several landowners have intimated their willingness to go into partnership with qualified Englishmen in the management, of their own lands, and of other lands which may be leased to them. 5. The limitation of the period of lease to 25 years should sufficiently protect indigenous interests, and the terms of the lease are such as to retain in the hands of the Chief Civil Authority full discretion as to whether or not a lease is granted to any particular individual. I understand that representatives of several land companies with experience in Egypt and elsewhere are likely to be visiting Mesopotamia during the coming cold weather, and I am anxious to be in a position to negotiate with them. I have sent a copy of this despatch with enclosures to the Government of India. 1 have,‘Ac. A. T. Wilson, Lieut.- Col., Indian Army, Acting Civil Commissioner in Mesopotamia. DRAFT NOTIFICATION.
