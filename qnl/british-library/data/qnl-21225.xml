Dated the 22nd February, 1946. TMPOaTANT. Cypher (O .T.P.) Political Agent, Bahrain. Britain Bushire. Government of India, New Delhi. This morning, February 22nd, at 9.30 the R.I.N, ratings (except Petty Officers) attached to Bahrain Naval Base refused duty out of sympathy with the R.I.N, mutineers in India. 2. After an opportunity to air any grievances and a talk by Commander Harris the men continued in their refusal to obey orders. They have been confined under guard in their quarters. The mutiny is passive. 3. The Senior Naval Officer now in Basra has been informed. 4. The incident is confined to the Naval Base and I suggest publicity is not repeat not desirable.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003be_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/223</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003be</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/223</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 5/17 Mutiny of Ratings at naval base, Jufair'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1946/1946</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-05-03T00:03:47</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (5 folios)</extent><extent>This file is arranged approximately in chronological order.
