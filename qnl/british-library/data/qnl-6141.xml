No.C/87 (7/7 ) &gt; . f\ 1 S' Please refer to ray Saviriararn No.0/71(13/9) of the bth April, 1949. 2. a question that arose in the course of Dr. Akopiantz 1 differences of opinion with the Kuwait G-overnment was whether or not His Highness could be sued by a forei^jner subject to the Kuwait Order in Council. Dr. AKopiantz’s contract was with His Harness himself. 3. The question might arise a^ain if Dr. AKopiantz, after taking legal advice in the Ini ted States, modifies his present intentions and tries to institute a suit in Kuwait, it might also arise out of the employment of other Non-Muslim foreit^iers (such as Indian doctors); and I think consideration should be given to the question now. 4. Ordinarily civil suii.s instituted by a person subject to the Kuwait Order in Council against a person not subject to it are admitted by the Political Agent and disposed of in accordance with the procedure laid down in sub-para 5 of oectipn 02 of Part V of the Order m Council. The conditions in which Kuling Chiefs could be sued in the Courts of british India are laid down in Section 86 of theCode of Civil Procedure (Act V of 1908). 0. My view is that permission to sue the Shaikh himself or in the name of the State should not be given. 6. It is desirable, however, that at any rat,e British and British Protected employ es should have some remedy in case of disagreement. They will expect us to assist them in such circumstances. It would meet the case if we could 0 et included in their contracts a clause appointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in case of dispute/ If the Shaikh would not cgree to this in respect of foreigners, he might agree to their contracts being made with the Head of the Department^ responsible for paying them, and to their being allowed to sue him (the Heaa of ohe Iepartment) under Part V of the Order in Council,, although this mijht not give them much protection, ./e /are unlikely to be able to do much for those employees who db not consult us before appointment. 7. Perhaps you would let me have instructions now about the admission of suits against the Ruler so that I may know the position if Dr. Akopiantz ooacx returns to the charge or if any of the Indian doctors comes' to me for assistance against the Health Department. H.K.Bir U.R. Hay, KCIK.,CSI., Political Resident m the Persian Gulf, Bahrain.FROM KUWAIT TO BAHRAIN. MR. G.N. JACKSON NO. 0/71(13/9) SAVING DATED 5TH APRIL, 1949. 1 ^ My predecessor^ Saving No. 0/55(13/9) of the 24th March 2 Akopiantz has not reached settlement with Sheikh with which he (Akopiantz) is entirely satisfied. He does not wish to pursue the matter further here in Kuwait beyond reporting the case to the Agency for record. He states that he intends, instead, to consult his lawyer in the United States; and, if he is advised that he has a case, to apply in the American courts for an injunction against the Sheikhas assets in the United States to the extent of his claims. 3. Galloway advised Sheixh’s Secretary unofficially that they should have given a month’s notice provided for in the contract instead of immediate dismissal with a month’s salary in lieu of notice; he also advised the Secretary that Dr. Akopaintz should be given time to settle his case before passages were provided for him and his wife to leave Kuwait. It appears fairly clear that his representation had the effect of securing more generous terms for Dr. Akopaintz although the Sheikh did not actually concede the point specifically raised. I also tried to discourage Akopiantz from taKing legal action in the United States. 4. United States Consul at Basra is being kept informed. He informed Akopiantz that his ( the U.S’at Consul’s ) direct intervention was not appropriate.tyt; rft &amp; V M/44(13/9) The Political Agent, Kuwait. April, 12th, 1949. ^ear Mr. Jova, Thank you for your letter of the 29th March about Dr. Akopiantz. 2. You will have by now received Galloway r s letter No.M/33 of the 1st April. Since then Akopiantz has received the money noted in the acquittance of which I enclose a copy. He signed it after recording before me a statement to the effect that he would sign it under duress. I explained to Dr. Akopiantz that, even if His Highness the Sheikh permitted the filing of a suit against him, it would be decided in accarrdance with para (5) of Section 52 of Part V(b) of the Kuwait Order in Council by the highest authority of the Sheikh or some person specially delegated by him for the purpose. Dr. Akopiantz told me that he did not wish to institute a suit in Kuwait; but., that he would file some more papers relating to his claim for record in tfris Agency. He left for Basra on Sunday without filing them, but left a message here that he would send them from Basra. Yours sincerely, sd. ^.N. Jackson. J.J. Jova, Esquire, Unitdd States Consul, American Consulate, Basra.H(v, 1/1 i (£) FROM POLITICAL, KUWAIT TO PHODROME, BAH HA. IN. NO. 0/55(13/9) SAVING. DATED MARCH 23TH, 1949. Reference correspondence ending with my telegram No. C/1 of 1st October, 1948. Akopiantz came to see me this morning and stated that he had been given one months notice by the Kuwait Government. He affirmed that this ftas not in conformity with his contract and alleged that the Kuwait Health Director had made improper advances to his wife. 2. He has written to the Sheikh requesting interview, apology for insult and notice in conformity with his reading of the contract, i.e. 6 months. 3. In the event of serious difficulty he asked if he could bring the case to me for settlement. I replied that he had not been engaged through His Majesty 1 Government and arbitration by the Political Agent was not allowed for in the contract. 4* It seems to me that matter is nne for U.S. Consul in first place and with which I should only concern myself if approached officially. = POLITICAL(214/2/49) Kuwait / .riw f, v. Vw &lt;v 0^ Please refer to Galloway's savingram No. C/55(13/9) of the 24th March. 2. I concur in the action so far taken. I am not quite sure however that I agree with the views expressed in paragraph 4 of the savingram. As a last resort Akopiantz could presumably institute a case under Article 52(5) of the Kuwait Crder-in- Council. We do not want him to do this and it is preferable that the case should be settled out of court. Should the United States Consul be brought into the matter, he would presumably deal with the case through the Political Agent and not direct so that it will not make much difference whether he is brought into it or not. Possibly the case has already settled itseli • by this time, but all I want to emphasise at present is that we should be chary of insisting on the formal intervention of the United States Consul in cases o this nature though it may well be desirable to keep him informed of the progress of events and perhaps to consult him before coming to a decision. 3* I hope to discuss this case and its implications with you during my forthcoming visit to Kuwait. G.N. Jackson, Esq., MBE*, Political Agency, Kuwait.RESTRICTED . (149/27/49) PERSIAN GULF RESIDENCY, BAHRAIN. 23rd April 1949. ' Please refer to your letter No.C/87(7/7) of the 16th April. I agree with the opinion expressed in rara 5 that per mission to sue the Shaikh himself or in the name of the State should not be given. 2. With reference to the suggestions made in para 6 I agree that when any British subjects are recruited through us we should endeavour to get a clause inserted in their contracts appointing the Political Agent as arbitrator in case of dis pute. It will be impossible to get this done in respect of persons recruited direct unless they consult us about their contracts. 3. Generally speaking I consider that the Political Agent should so far as possible use his good offices to bring about a settlement of disputes between persons subject to the Order- in-Council and the Kuwait Government. In the case of Dr. Alkopiantz if he submits a formal application asking for your intervention you should do what you can to assist him if you consider he has any reasonable grounds for complaint. Other wise you should inform him that his application discloses nothing which would justify your intervention and advise him to accept the position with the best grace he can. G.N.

It therefore considers whether foreigners subject to the Kuwait Order in Council should be able to sue the ruling Shaikh, and to what extent the Political Agent should act as an arbitrator in such cases.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Arbitration</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00015c#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
