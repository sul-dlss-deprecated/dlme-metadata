Wtlghtoan, Esquire, I«C«3« 9 Political Agent, Bahrain• To The Honourable the Political Heaid^nt in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Subject *- Visit of Ibn Baud to Bahrein. Sir, I have the honour to submit the following report on the visit of Hie Majesty King Abdul Aziz Ibn Saud to Bahrain from the 2nd to the 7th May 1939* It will be appreciated that this report has been written on the day of the King*s departure and that there has been Insufficient time to collect much gossip from the Palace or the bazaar. The report Is therefore based almost solely on my personal observations. 2. On the 1st May 1939 the Amir Baud arrived in Bahrain from A1 Khobar by launch and on the same day the Amir Felsal arrived from Cairo by air. The latter had chartered an Imperial Airways* aeroplane from H&amp;ypt and brought with him Shaikh Hafiz Wahba and Shaikh Jemal Husselnl who had been summoned by Ibn Saud for a discussion on Palestine. I paid an informal call on the Amirs the same evening and the following morning they crossed to Al Khobar by launch, in company with the brothers of His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain and his eldest son, Shaikh Salman, in order to escort the King to Bahrain. The King arrived in the late afternoon with a huge party of relatives /-C\ relatives, Ministers, Amirs, Political detenus and retainers, and mas met on the Customs pier hy His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, Mr# Belgrave, myself and the Assistant Political Agent* The arrival was admirably staged and an excellent guard of honour provided by the Bahrain Police was inspected before Ibn Saud and His Highness entered an open car to drive to the Palace in Manama where the remainder of the A1 Khallfah Family and the notables of Bahrain had assembled to greet him. At this point the King performed the first of many acts of cordiality towards myself by insisting on my accompanying him in his car, although I had intended to take leave of him at the pier# After a brief stay at the Palace in Manama the King and His Highness the Shaikh motored to Rafa 1 a where a Palace recently constructed by His Highness* son, shaikh Salman, had bsen placed at Ibn 3aud*s disposal# 3# On ths following morning the Bahrain Pollca gave a short display bsfors Ibn ssud, followed by Arab dancing; in ths afternoon the King, the Amir Saud, the Amir Feisal and several other sons and members of the entourage, together with Shaikh Hamad and the leading members of the Al Khalifah cams to a garden party at ths Agency# The whole party was in excellent spirits, and the King cracked several Rabelaisian jokes; while at intervals he made extremely offensive remarks about ths German Chancellor and Signor Mussolini. He reminded me that the ex-Falaer lilhelm had in 1914 claimed to be the Sword and Protector of Islam -- and had coma to a bad end; and he added, it was interesting to observe that Signor Mussoli ni is now using very much ths same language and will probably go very much the same way l He said that he was thankful that he had been able to put an end to the Italian connection with his ”Air Fores' by making ths excuse that he felt he ought to send his young men to Sgypt for training. 4/-J 0^ *» 3* 4* On th« following morning I was enabled to pay * formal call at Hafa'a on His Majesty who had with him only the Amir Saud and Shaikh Hafiz Wahba* The Interview lasted half an hour and I found an opportunity to tell the King something about the abortive agitation which occurred In Bahrain last autumn* His Majesty said that he knew well that It had been entirely foreign in origin and he proceeded to blame Iraq for the trouble it causes In neighbouring States by its press and wireless propaganda. The disturbances In Dubai were also mentioned and the King made it very clear that his sympathies were entirely with Sheikh Said bln 1/aktum. He then said that he wished to give me some friendly advice — never to believe any news from the Coast unless I had verified it myself. He thought that much of our difficulty with the Coastal Shaikhs in the past had been due to inaccurate infor mation from our previous Agent theref and he added that he himself had much the same trouble with some of his outlying districts. He wished to assure me that on more than one occasion he had advised Trucial Coast Shaikhs to placa their trust in the British and to cease making stupid difficulties in regard to sir facilities and so on. His Majesty was politely enthusiastic about Bahrain and the admirable relations which exist between the A1 Khallfah and ourselves| and at this point he said that there was one matter which he wished to mention as the friend of all parties concerned. Ha had intended tc rciae it with Sir Header Bullard if the latter had been able to come to Bahrain but he thought it would be proper to speak to me about it. He had been much criticised for not attempting to make peace between Bahrain and ^atar; it was a stupid and unnecessary quarrel and ought to be ended. In the subsequent pause I remarked that I also was graatly concerned at this quarrel and was constantly on the watch for/-($&gt; for an opportunity to initiato a settlement. I thought that both sides were still a little too hot, but I should be Immensely grateful for any advice which His Majesty could, in his wisdom, give me. The King then closed this part of the discussion by saying that he hoped to hear before long that a settlement had been reached. T expected the next subject to be Jebel Naksh and Khor-el-Odeid, but he then turned to a discussion on oil , making it evident that in his view the California Arabian Standard Oil Company did not have interests at heart. He was thankful that ©t last some progress had been made by them, but after all he needed oil royalties very badly and they were only Just beginning to come in in very minor sums. Fortunately he still had other large areas in his country uncovered by existing concessions and these would not go for nothing. I might add here that I gather the impression th-tthe whole Dammam visit has been somewhat unsatisfactory; the King would not follow the programme which had been arranged; he arrived at a banquet organised by the California Arabian Standard Oil Company and left inside three minutes; he com plained to Shaikh Hamad in my hearing that on one occasion he had been compelled to chase food unsuccessfully ell around ths tabls with a spoon and fork; and altogether he appears to have reacted somewhat violently to the American passion for schedule. 5. To revert now to the course of events in Bahrain. On the afternoon of the 4th May a formal entertainment was given by the Manama and Muharraq Municipalities In the T anama Municipal Carden. The proceedings, once they began, were comparatively brief, being confined to short speeches of welcome read on behalf of His Highness the Shaikh and the Presidents of the two Municipalities and a reply read on behalf /-behalf of the King by Shaikh v U8U f Yaein. The aantimenta expressed were in all respects admirablei the King*• speech referring to 11 this Arab Island under its Arab Holer'. Though it would be foolish to Imagine that the King had any parti cular motive| this part of the speech was a potent reply to those who talk of British domination snd colonisation In Bahrain or the dictatorship of the British Adviser. 6. On the following day, Friday, the King joined in the prayers at the Mosque in Manama. In the afternoon he paid a visit to the Oil Field and Refinery, during which Mr. Belgrave and I accompanied him in his car and were com pelled to assume the role of oil experts. During much of the drive however His Majesty held forth on politics; after a brief reference to M. Litvinoff* a departure from the scene in Russia and a remark that he wished he knew whnt this meant, the Bing embarked on a long statement of his dislike for Germany Italy and their hectoring methods. He said that Herr Grobba had told him recently that Germany and Italy were stronger than the rest of Europe put together, that the Democracies were afraid of them and that he, Ibn Saud, would be well advised to link his fate with the Axis* He himself however had not the least doubt that if war broke out in Europe there would be revolution in Germany and Italy whose people must, he said, be sick of 'having their tongues held'. He then went on to deprecate modem tendencies in Iraq. Iraq, he said, seemed to be composed of three quite irreconcilable elements, the Government, the tirmy and the People. Everyone was in far too much of a hurry and T raqi foreign policy was deplorable. He himself thought that they would all do well to remember how much Arab nations owed to England. But for England the Iraq State would never have come into existence and Egypt would have been at the mercy/-- 6 - mercy of any odd minor power, such as Greece. How happy was Bahrain undar Its Arab Shaikh, enjoying the protection of i&amp;gland — and at this stage point was given to his remarks by the eight of the battery of tanks at the Oil Company 1 a Refinery. From there on hie Interest was mainly in statistics \ of tone of oil. tanks and wells. He stopped at the Power House at the Refinery and wae obviously impressed, but worried by the noise. Later on, at tea, he whispered to me that he heard that the Bahrain Petroleum Company were to get a concession for the Unallotted Area of Bahrain, and said he would be very grateful if I would let him know in due course what the terms were as these would help him a great deal in his own concession al negotiations l I thought it well to make it clear that we did not settle the terms and were concerned only to see that iihalkh Hamad received fair treatment from the Company. 7. It struck me on this, as on other occasions, that he seemed extremely anxious to show publicly the good will which he entertained for the British. He made me sit by Him on all public occasions and would not tolerate any attempt on my part to retire into the back-ground. He was equally cordial to Mr. Belgrave and made a particular point of thanking him personally for all the arrangements which had been made for his entertainment. 8. On the earlier nights the banquets given by His Highness the 3haikh and his brothers (for which the State pays) had been restricted solely to Arab guests. On Friday and Saturday nights however a few European guests were also invited and received most kindly attention from the King. 9* On Saturday morning the King visited a few of the more important Nejdi traders in ksnama and also had his eyes tested. (Dr. Kennedy tells me that it is merely a matter of giving/-(3 0 -7- giviag him slightly s'trorv^cr lenses)* AtXtP dinner 1 the 1 Ing attended a toreh-llght Tattoo In which the Bahrain Police, some of the town watchmen and a number of school-children took part. It was an admirable production for which greet credit is due to Mr. Belgrave, who was solely responsible for Its organisation. Meanwhile I had arranged through shaikh Hafls Wahba that the King would give me a private audience after the Tattoo, and at this I solicited Shaikh Hafiz's assistance in reading to him two messages and a memorandum from His Majesty's Governmen'. in regard to Palestine. There had been insufficient time after the arrival of the telegrams (In very corrupt form) from the Foreign Office to do more than make a rough translation, but the English and Arabic versions were faired during the night and handed to ’-is Majesty when he left Bahrain this morning. As I have reported separately, Xbn Saud said that he was unable to make any com ment Immediately, but that he would study these papers In detail on arrival at A1 Khobar and, if he 'viahed to send any message or require further elucidation from His Majesty's Government, he would write to me at once. Explaining the presence of Shaikh Jemal Hussein!, ha said that he had re- | calved many kindnesses from the British Government and that, now that they were In difficulties, he wished to do what he could to help them. He had sent messages to the Palestine Arab Leaders to prepare for a settlement ^nd had asked Jemal Husselnl be sent to him for a discussion since he re garded him as probably the most intelligent anon -at them. It was probably an unusual expertones for b±BK to sit with only two companions in a large and empty palace late at night, and with no more than two Policemen and two of hie own fldawls outside. 10/-10• The King and his entourage left Bahrain thie morning after the moet affectionate farewell* and pressing Invitation* to visit him at Riyadh. I have not yet received full infor mation of the present* which have been given by shaikh Hamad but they include 21 motor cars, 50 camel* and 20 horse*. Other gift* include K«. 30,000 for the ling 1 * servant*, though a* a cheque for this amount was presented to shaikh Abdullah Suleiman the ultimate disposal of the money remain* in doubt. The Manama bazaar i* half denuded by the immense purchases made by the Saudi entourage and a fleet of boats la at present carrying these purchases across to A1 Khobar. I shall report more fully on the financial aspect of the visit st a later date* 11, According to information received so far, no political questions affecting Saudi - Bahrein relations were discussed with the Shaikh or his Family. The King did, it is true, enquire from Mr. Belgrave whether it would be possible to release from Jail one of the prisoners convicted of complicity in last October 1 s disturbances, but this enquiry seems to have been prompted by the fact that the man had at one time been a nakhuda in Ibn Sand's own employment* A roundabout request also reached me to release a Kejdi whom X had imprisoned for rash and negligent driving but I declined to do anything unless the King himself mentioned the matter* -azaar rumour* heard so far relate mainly to the Amir Faisal, - one of them referring to his impending elevation to the throne of Palestine. 12. The effect of this visit has been wholely admirable locally and will, X am convinced, have excellent results in a much wider sphere. The King has seen for himself the rela tions which exist between the Al Khalifah Family, the Agency end the Adviser; he has spoken publicly of his great pleasure in all that he has seen in Bahrain; he has exhibited equally publicly/--9- 3069 publicly (and at a time when there are many ^rlsiterV other Moelem States In Bahrain) the most marked cordiality towards British officials herej and further proof has been given of the personal affection which exists between the Kin^ and Jhaikh Hamad of Bahrain. I am sure that he has enjoyed his vlsit f and certainly Shaikh Hamad, his brothers and sons are delighted beyond measure. Indeed it is difficult to realise, after the events of the past few days, that only nine years ago the Political Agent in Bahrain reported after ^Ibn Saud's last visit to the Island that H the whole effect of this visit has been deplorable* A more successful impetus Tu - feeling could not have been given and the tenuity vfvvt 4 ~ ^ of our hold on Bahrain could not have been more clearly u/vftt ^ 4 W t** ' 2TVj&gt; P- P £ t&gt;C^VvV\AA&lt;WVv' . demonstrated.............. The futility of the A1 Khallfah Shaikhs in tlieir own dominions has been amply demonstrated .*•• ^ This present report might end with a quotation from Ibn 3aud f a own words to ihalkh Hafiz viahba * M In my own country I lose my temper not less than once in three days? here in Bahrain I cannot imagine how I could ever lose it*” ^ortunatelj the weather was cool* P*St « I have the honour to be. Sir, Your moat obedient servant, I have just heard through Shaikh Mohammad bln 'Isa, brother of shaikh Sir Hamad, that Ibn Baud talked constantly to shaikh Hamad and his relatives about world politics, and that time after time he impressed upon them the strength of his pro-British sentiments. He said he might have his minor differences with us but these were matters of no account and that he was solid with the British. 3d/- H. Weightman, Political 4gent, Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL.

Copy of to -4/. ^.4 SEEN POUTICAL COMMITTED. FOR INFORMATION. The Political Agent, Bahrein, has submitted a most interesting report on the recent visit of the Emir Saud to Bahrein. The visit, which lasted from the 15th to the 23rd December, was made at the direct request of His^Highness and seems to have been an unqualified success. Outwardly, at any rate, the visit had no political significance. Acting on instructions, the Political Agent was present on the arrival of the Emir and entertained His % Highness at dinner at the Agency. The dignity of the arrival ceremony seems to have been sadly marred by the uncontrolled behaviour of His Highness's followers, and Mr. Weight man A does not recommend that the Political Agent should be present at any similar arrival in future. 1CONFIDENTIAL. ^ 4 No. 13-S of 1937.

Sir, I have the honour to submit the follov/ing report on the visit of the Afllr laud to Bahrain. 2* The Prince arrived at fcanamah on the 15th December 1937 by launch. He had been met on the mainland by Sheikh !4ohamn\ad bin ’Isa and by Shaikh Salman bin Hamad, respectively elder brother and eldest son of Hie Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain. He was accompanied by two of his brothers, three cousins and e nephew, and by about 40 followers and servants. 3. He was met on arrival by His Highness the Shaikh and the A1 Khalif eh Family, by the Polltlcsl Agen t, and by the officers of the Bahrain Administration. The arrangements for the reception at the Customs pier were admirable in every way, but the dignity of the ceremony was sadly marred by the uncontrolled behaviour of the Saudi-n followers, who swarmed off the launches and reduced the reception to some* thing more akin to a foot-ball scrimmage. The Amir laud, in striking contrast, deported himself with dignity and calm. It was however a thoroughly uncomfortable affair, and I would not recommend that the Political Agent should be pre sent at any similar arrival in future. It is true that on this occasion no one was pushed off the pier into the sea, but the possibility of an exit in this manner is by no meansremote. A big crowd esser.bled outside the pier gates to see the proce8sion y which was accompanied by a pandemonium of horn blowing by the drivers of the cars, who apparently were not leipressed by the fact that the route had been cleared. 4. The Amir t&gt;aud stayed at the Palace in 2&lt;anaiuah and on the first night dined quietly with His Highness the :haikh ©t 3©khir, this being followed on the next three night# by dinners at the houses of Jhaikhs Mohammad, Abdullah and Sal man. On these nights no European guests were invittid. It is amtusing to note the local view that the dote of the visit hed been suggested to the Amir £aud by his companions and followers in order to coincide with Hie Highness the Shaikhs Anniversary Celebrations, as these are usually marked by a certain loosening of normal restraint, with a consequently greater expectation of pleasant adventures in the town. It appears from reports that thsy were not disappointed. 5. Cm the 16th December, I called on the Amir Baud, ac companied by the senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, end by the Adviser *uo the 33ahrain Government. His Highness the ihaikh, most of the A1 Khalifah Family, and other notables were present, and the ceremony was adequate. A friendly note was struck by an invitation to me from the Amir &gt;aud to visit him in his own home in the near future. 6. On the 17th December, I called on Kis Highness the Bhaikh at the Palace, again accompanied by the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, on the occasion of the Anniversary Celebrations. The Amir Baud was present and informed me of his wish to return my call. The return call took place the following morning, &gt;ecember the 13th, His Highness the Shaikh acctmipanying the Amir Baud. The visit lasted about 20 minutes. In the aften oon of December 13th the Amir Baud accompanied His Highness the Ghaikh to the annual 1 unicipal Garden/-Garden Party given in honour of the latter, when the usual laudatory speeches were delivered. 7. Cn the 19th December, the /dviser to the Bahrain Go vernment gave a dinner pa ty in honour of the Prince, at which la ies were also present. This was followed by large dinner parties on the two succeeding evenings at the Palace and at the house of the Saudian /gent in Bahrain, the days being occupied with hawfcing and Zreb dances. 8. Cn the last evening of the visit the Amir Baud and His Highness the Shaikh accompanied by six of the former's and three of the latter's relatives dined (Arab fashion) ©t the Agency. By this time the Saudian brothers and cousins, who had been very silent at the beginning of the visit, had thaw ed considerably and were quite animated. The Amir aud, who throughout had been most *riendly and charming, was almost affectionate. He was certainly most outspoken, one of his comments being that it was high time that England used her increasing strength to give Italy a sharp lesson, as the latter country appeared to be completely out of control. The more peaceful suggestion that while one might forge a sword one need not necessarily use it, was greeted with an unbelie ving smile. 9. The Saudian party left for the mainland on Thursday morning, the 23rd December. The visit has been an unquali fied success find every one is very pleased. So far as I can discover its ,, private rt nature has been carefully maintained, and there have been no real political discussions. The fol lowing items of reported conversation are, however, of interest* (i) The Amir Baud is reported to have said that he was very pleasantly surprised to find that the A1 Khalifah Zanily was not held down in a position of inferiority in Bahrain, without prestige or power, as he had so frequently heard from other/-other sources* He realised now that the stories of Bri tish interference ere untrue and that His Highness (act ing with the Al Khslifah Family) was left to exercise freely his prerogatives as tiler* (ii) The Prince exhibited very great interest in oil t and on a visit to the Bahrain Oil Corapany’s Hefinery made notes of production and royalty figures. He remarked that the third share of the royalties received by His highness amounted to a very large sum of money, but said that he realised that His Highness was extremely hospitable and generous to the poor, and that he felt sure that the r oney was being well spent. (iii) On one occasion Shaikh hohaimnad bin f Isa, brother of His Highness the Shaikh, raised the question of r'uberah. He became extremely excited and shrill saying that it v;as unbearable that the *1 Than! should seize the home and tombs of the Al hhalifah Family. His Highness rebuked his bro ther for his vehemence, and the Prince remarked that this was a subject about which rten might well become vehement. After all, he said, the Al Thani were nothing but animalsi This, so far as I con discover, is the only justifi cation for the bazaar rumour that the main object of the -mir Jaud* s visit was to effect a reconciliation between Bahrain and Qatar. 10. It is interesting to note that the Baud!an party brought a .great deal of gold to Bahrain, one report putting it as high as 25 to 30 thousand sovereigns. Borne of this had been left here In return for services 'endered end a ^ooddeal nore wae spent in purchasing aria Theresa dollnra. It appears that a duty of 205 was Imposed last month on the Import of dollars Into Haasa, following larve arrivals of/-5- of this coin minted in Belgium. The Bahrain hazaar was short of dollars but 70|000 coins were brought in by mail and were bought by the Saudi /r?*bian party, on which they will make their 20; : &gt; profit, as of course the Prince’s party will be able to avoid the payment of duty in Hassa* They are also taking with them 11 motor cars presented by His Highness the Shaikh, sac*e of them new and others rather pert-worn. Cosh presents to servants and followers amounted to at least is. 20,000/- and they have all been given new outfits of clothes. The cost to His Highness the Shaikh however has, I imagine, been well within Hs. one lakh, and so far as he personally is concerned he has enjoyed himself enormously throughout the visit, though he was beginning to \ look a little tired towards the end. The rotate will of cours not be a very great Siam. 11. There has been a certain amount of comment in the town on the extraordinary precautions which the ^mir 3aud took for his protection at night. He rr.oved from the i^oom prepared for him in the ialace to a smaller room on a high er floor, and the arrangement of the furniture was changed frequently. Kvery one is satisfied that such danger as was apprehended came not from Bahrain but from his own entourega, which induced his cousin Shaikh Khalid bin Mohammed. 12. It may be inter esting to report that the /mir Saud received a telegram from his father three days after his arrival telling him to return not later than Bee ember the 21st as there was a great deal of work for him to do at home. The local expectation is that he is to be char ed with duties corresponding roughly with those of a Foreign Minister./-Minute Paper.
