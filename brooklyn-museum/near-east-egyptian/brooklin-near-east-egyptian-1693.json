The fragment bears his cartouche written vertically. Above the cartouche are preserved signs. The cartouche is flanked by black border lines. To the left of the left border line is what looks like the lower part of a serpent hieroglyph painted yellow with red dashes. The ground of the cartouche bears traces of yellow paint. There are traces of red paint on the ground outside of the cartouche; the cartouche and border lines are painted black. The signs within the cartouche are painted as follows: sun-disk is red, the fringed cloth is red, and the seated god is red with black wig, feather and \"Ankh\". The seated figure above the cartouche is red; the \"t\" is black. The bottom edge of the fragment is smooth but not parallel to the cartouche. The other edges are rough.\r\nCondition: Paint partially preserved and flaking; head of figure in cartouche destroyed and filled in with white plaster.", "medium": "Limestone, pigment", "dimensions": "11 x 6 11/16 x 2 3/8 in.
