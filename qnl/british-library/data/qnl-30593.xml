October, 1945, concerning the ireposed air-mail service to Muscat, I give below the answers to your questions, so far as I am able to supply thorn. (1) Normal air-mail .fees will bo chargeable in addition to any subscription towards the cost of launch transport. For air-mail to India, inland rates for India will be charged as the Bfuscnt Post Office is linked to the Indian Poets and Telegraphs Department: that is to say on ordinary letters Fs .0-2-6 will be charged againfct Rs.0-1-6 by sea-mail. It will be realised from this that, as the bulk of Muscat’s correspondence is with India, the revenue accruing from air-mail sur-ch&amp;rges rill be small. (2) While 1 cannot answer definitely your question regarding the ft'ee carriage of your official correspondence tc India, it seems likely . that the present arrangement would be extended to include correspondence by air-mail. This question should be taken up with the Postmaster. (3) As soon as the service is Introduced air-mail facilities will be available to all. Yours faithfully.

Dated 15th April, 1946. &amp; Your telegram No.A/ 600 of 10th April and No.A/6l2 of 13th April. 2. Main defects in postal arrangements in Muscat territory are (l) failure to link Muscat and Gwadur with air-mail services (2) absence of instructions for mail steamers to resume carriage of mail to and l from Gwadur (3) absence of any internal mail system over Muscat’s coastline, and ( 4 ) poor terms of service of Sub-Postmaster which inevitably affect efficiency. 3. As regards (1) suggest examination of possibility of providing motor transport for carriage of mails between Gwadur and Jiwani and Muscat and Sharjah once weekly. If contractors at both places could be allowed to purchase trucks from army stocks and to carry passengers in addition to mail, these arrangements should not be undiLhy expensive. Jiwani does not possess Post Office but British Overseas Airways Corporation would probably agree to act as postal agents. 4* In regard to (2) use of mail steamers wh^ch are now scheduled to make regular calls at Gwadur would permit resumption of registered and insured mail which is not accepted for delivery by overland route. 5. As regards (3) if weekly mail service between Muscat and Sharjah as suggested is introduced, postal agents could be appointed at all Batinah towns, who would sell stamps and receive mail for collection by truck. Similar arrangement might be extended to Sur by means of runners. I anticipate no difficulty in obtaining Sultan's consent to this. 6. As regards ( 4 ) the grade pay of Rs.45-3-90 for postal clerks is deplorably low. In view of their educational requirements (matriculation) and responsibilities consider this shduld be not less than grade pay of Residency lower division clerk. Inadequacy of house rent allowance of Rs.15/- has already been pointed out to the Superintendent, Post Offices, Hyderabad, Sind, with recommendation for increase to Rs.30/-. Gulf Allowance of Rs.25/- also appears to be fully justified. -Political-INDIAF T ' F/rC IfW TKT : CrP/^HS Director General’s Post Office Circular Mo. iW Delhi, the 4th 'pril, 1 ( J46.

Dear Major Stewart, On my last visit to Muscat on the 24-12~46 we discussed the following points with regard to the Post and Telegraph arrangements in your area. I had further discussions with the Hon’ble Resident at Bahrein and the action taken by me is detailed below: (1) Orders are being issued to send mails to Gwadur by sea in addition to the land service via Quetta. This would give Gwadur a more frequent service than what exists at present. I am also examining the question of revising the system of collection of custom duty on Post Parcels to Gwadur With a view to avoid any clash with the local autho rities. i feel that if we introduce the same system as we have in Muscat there should be no trouble. if you agree with this please let me know so that final orders ma^ be issued. The land telegraph line between Gwadur, Panjgur Lasbella and Karachi is functioning now. It went out of order again few days a t o but it has be n put right. m any case xm strict orders have been issued tuat when the land line between ranjgur and Karachi via Lasbella is out of order, the messages must be transmitted by wireleso between ianjgur and Karachi and by land line between Panjgur and uwadur. i ho^e that in future there would be no avoidable delay to telegraph traffic to or from Gwadur. i have also taken up the question of securing a small wireless set and if that becomes available, it would be installed at Gwfcdur in substitution oi the existing land telegraph system. 2) —- - ' ' • 1 have been anxious to give Muscat a more frequent mail service. The B.I.S.N.Co., is being approached to expedite the introduction of their new Schedule which would give Muscat one steamer in 20 days from Karachi and one from Bahrein, in a month. As regards the land route c class services between Karachi-Dubai-Bahrein have- 2 - since been cancelled by the B.O.A.C. but once a week service is still being run to Sharjah. I an quite willing to send airmails and diplomatic mails by air to Sharjah once a week if it could be possible to establish a road link between Sharjah and Uuscat. I understood from Col. hay that lorries already ply between Sharjah and Muscat. If that is so, I would request you kindly to let me have the information on the following points, on receipt of which the proposed service could be introduced; 1) Distance of the proposed mail line. 2) Name and other particulars of your nominee for taking up the contract. 3) Minimum subsidy that the contractor would accept for his services. 4 ) Share of the subsidy which the political Department and the local government would be prepared to contribute. 5) Other important terms and conditions of the contract. 6) Names of offices between Sharjah and Muscat that would be served by the proposed mail line. 2. I have dealt with all the points that we discussed and if I have omitted any, kindly let me know so that further action may be taken. I might however mention that the question of giving the Post and Telegraph Staff special scales of pay for Muscat is being vigorously pursued with the Government of India along with a similar question with regard to other offices in the Persian Gulf area.

There is therefore ample justification for steamers lixe , '^arsova , ‘ and “Varala' to call at Owadur regulai'ly fortniglitly. 2. Failing quick transportation for accumulated stocks of fish in a fortnight, the fish is liaole to aeterioration involving risk of heavy losses to merchants. 3. it is high time that sea-mail service should be resumed but it could not done without the mail steamers calling regularly at ilwadur. &lt;—. it is i therefore requested that if you see no objection, it may kindly be suggested to Mackinnons that 'Varsova M and 'Varala” may be permitted to cal] at n rwadur regalarly fortnightly with a minimum halt of 6 to 8 hours at (iwadur.

Bamora which leaves Bombay on October 28th is said to be missing Muscat and next steamer to call will be Varsova arriving November 21st. Date of next down mail cannot be forecast but is likely to be Bamora which is now in Karachi on its return trip from Basra. 2. This complete disregard of Muscats shipping requirements is causing much complaint and I should be grateful if you could urge Mackinnons to ensure that Bs call at Muscat and Gwadur every trip. Apart from innumerable deck passengers there are to my knowledge 10 Cabin passengers awaiting passages from Bombay including two clerks of this Agency three of Cable and Wireless and five members of their family.

That port will have two vessels both outward and inward every six weeks (one a fort night and one in four weeks). Also the s.s.

Will you please refer to the correspondence forwarded to me with your Printed Letter No. 1874-S dated the 31st October 1947, on the subject of the B.I. mail services to Muscat. 2. At the time I issued my telegram No. C. 445 of the 22nd October I had not received a copy of the B.l's revised programmes. Even should the B.I. be able to stick to this programme for any length of time, I cannot altogether agree with Meikle that two vessels in six weeks (one after a fortnight and one after four weeks) is satisfactory, when it is realised that unlike all other Gulf ports on the Arab side, Muscat has no air communication, no fast ma-n service and no calls from any other vessels apart from the B.I's. 3. In point of fact, however, the B.I. have already changed the service, and the Varela appears to have been taken off the run thus leaving us with the four to five weekly service that I had anticipated. Actually figures show that while our last passenger vessel from India,(the Itaura was a cargo vessel) arrived on the 21st October the next is not due until the 4th December • eight weeks in all. The last mail from Basrah was on the 10th October and according to the programme the next is not due until the 26th November - six weeks in all. A telegram has^since been received indicating that the BaaoCTr is now calling at Muscat on the 16th November Instead of Dubai, doubtless due to the cholera report.

Dear Sirs, The hopes raised by your letter No.F/556 of the 7th August 1947, that in future we should have reasonably frequent communication with Muscat by fast mail have been repidly dashed to the ground by information since received from the Political Agent, Muscat and confirmed by Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., here that in future neither the H Dwarka M nor the 'Dumra” will call at Muscat in either direction. I was given no previous intimation of this change in the programme nor do I know the reasons for it. 2. The Political Agent, Muscat, has telegraphed as follows 'This complete disregard of Muscat’s shipping requirements is causing much complaint. Apart from innumerable deck passengers there are to my knowledge ten cabin passengers awaiting passages from Bombay including two clerks of this Agency three of Cable &amp; Wireless and five members of their families.' 3. Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Bahrain, inform me that Muscat will in future have two vessels both outward and inward every six weeks (one in a fortnight and one in four weeks). This means that as often as not the Political Agent, Muscat, will only be able to receive mails from this Residency and vice-versa once in a month - a most unsatisfactory arrangement from the administrative and political point of view. 4. I should be most grateful if arrangements could be made for the decision reached to be reversed or modified and would ask in any case to be furnished with the reasons for it.

Gray Mackenzie Bahrain have now informed me that the VARELA has been suspended which means that Muscat will only have one mail in each direction every six weeks. Trust you will be able to restore calls by DWARKA and DUMRA”. Your letter No.l889-S of November 3rd is not yet to hand. It was most unfortunate that we found it necessary to withdraw the “Varela' temporarily from the Persian Gulf Service and this has been necessitated by the very large numbers^of refugees who desired transportation between Bombay and Karachi and vice versa and also the large numbers of Government employees who had opted for service with either the Dominion of India or Pakistan. In order to cope with this mass migration we have had to place four passenger vessels including the “Varela' on the service between Bombay and Karachi. We anticipate, however, that the “Varela' will return to the Persian Gulf service, taking her scheduled sailing from this port on the 23rd December. In the meantime, however, the connection between Muscat and Bahrain has been catered for as follows Outwa rds “Barpeta' Left Muscat Left Bahrain 22nd October 28th October “Itaura' Left Muscat Left Bahrain 5th November 11th November “Barpeta' Due Muscat about 10th December Due Bahrain ' 15th December Inwards “Varela' Due Muscat Due Bahrain “ 29th December “ 1st January 'Barpeta' Left Bahrain Due Muscat about 12th November ' 16th ' 'Bamora' Due Bahrain a Due Muscat bout 20th Kovember ' 25th ' 'Barpeta' Due Bahrain ' 21st December (Extra) Due Muscat ' 25th ' 'Bamora' Due Bahrain Due Muscat 1st January ' 6th January “Varela' Due Bahramn Due Muscat “ 15th Januray “ 18th 't In view of the present 4 days cholera quarantine to which all vessels are subjected to in the Basrah River we intend turning the Subsidiary Mails at Kuwait and the above dates, are therefore tentative only. We trust, however, that this programme will meet your requirements. It is indeed unfortunate just as we had hoped that the programmes mapped out for the 'Dumra” and 'Dwarka' and for the three vessels maintaining the Subsidiary Service seemed to meet the present requirements of the Gulf, that the schedule has had to be interrupted as soon arter its inauguration by the requirements of this mass migration between the two Dominions, and now by this delay of 4 days in the Basrah'River due to quarantine restrictions. In addition the entire work of discharging and loading vessels in Bombay has since the 15th instant been brought to a standstill due to the Port Labour having gone on strike. It is hoped that this strike will be speedily settled but we fear fresh delays to shipping must be expected on this account. We sincerely hope, hov/ever, that these restrictions will be withdrawn in the near future when it will be possible for vessels once again to maintain their programme. •LB’ 'iours faithfully, Mackinnon Maeken 7 ie &amp; Co.

Dear Sir, lour letter no. 1889-o dated Srd iMOvember is just to hand and has crossed ours l*o. (i/707 dated the 17th of nove«iber. iivery effort was made by us to include Muscat m the ij’ast iiuail service maintained oy the ’-uwarka' ana 'uuxura’ but ujifortunately the light of experience showed that this was not possible. As you are no doubt aware port facilities at Muscat are practically non-existent, and m spite of frequent representations to the authorities for an extension to the wharf or the building of a godown at that port to facilitate the quick turn-round of cargo barges, no action has been taken and from all accounts, it appears unlikely that any action will be taken. Delays at Muscat are there fore unavoidable, and these, with the present shortage of passenger vessels, we cannot afford unless the entire ^ulf programme be disrupted, which would be to nobody’s advantage. We have therefore reluctantly had to withdraw muscat from the schedule of the ’Dumra’ and ’Dwarka* • We co ns ider,however, that with the curtailed resources at our disposal, the connect ions between Muscat and Rahrain, and vice-versa as/jn ouri- letter of 17th instant are, m the circumstances, reasonable. At the present moment unfortunately programmes have been still further disorganised, due firstly to the four days enforced quarantine m the Rasrah River, and secondly to the strike of all labour at this port, out once conditions return to normal we hope the ’Dumra' and 'Dwarka’ will main tain tneir present J?ast oervice programme with regularity. As you are aware, the u.i. Company lost over bQ/&lt;» of its ships during the war and, although delivery of new vessels has now commenced, it is still short of tonnage, particularly passenger tonnage. ihe position has been further aggravated, as explained in our letter of the 17th instant, by the fact that we have to employ four passenger vessels between Romoay and Karachi to cover the movement of troops, Government employees and evacuees between the two Dominions. The urgency of this movement is so great that in order to secure the greatest number bf round voyages in the shortest possible time no cargo whatsoever is carried m any of tnese ships in either direction. in case it should be thougnt that the Company has not fairly apportioned its available passenger ships amongst its various eastern Services and that the Persian Gulf Services have been denuded to trie advantage of otner services, we would mention that prior to the war tne Company operated eight passenger vessels in the Persian Gull’ as against the four/five now available. on the other hand m the Ray of Rengai the Company, prewar, operated twenty-one passenger vessels as against nine at the present time. m the lignt of this you will, we think, agree that the Persian Gulf has not been unfairly treated. /We attach for your information copies of the various programmes 'which it is our intention will be maintained by the Company’s vessels on the Persian Gulf .Service in the immediate future. lours faithfully, mackinnon Mackenzies Co., Agents. wo.

Sotao months ago, In Juno to bo exact, tho Captain of tho 'Dumra w eomplainod to ao about delays in unloading of cargo at Niisoat duo to tho fact that tho cargo barges cannot go alongside tho Customs ^&gt;arf at loo tide. Ro said that Ifecklnnon Ifcckensle had oomplainod about this for some time, but that no attention had been paid to their complaints. I me somewhat surprised as I hare not hitherto cons across any correspondence on my files on this subject. 1 agreed, however, to look into the matter. On ey return I made enquiries, as a result of which it transpires that there had Indeed been correspondence on this subject exchanged between Mackinnon ftteokensie and the Agent of Gray ffeekensl# in Muscat. Ths Agent olalms that hs had made representations to tho State without success) hs had not, however, et any time asked for the assistance of the Consulate in this matter. 3* It is clear that an expensive extension to the Customs wharf could not bo made without the sanction of the Sultan. Ihile agreeing therefore to raise the matter with the Muscat Government at the earliest possible opportunity, I told tho Agent of Gray Jfcekensls and tha Captain of tho 'Dumra' on his return voyage, that nothing could be done until the Sultan's return .from Etxofkr. Aa an alternative to the extension of ths Customs wharf, tha Captain of tho *Dumra M was of tho ©pinion that tho difficulty might be overcome if cargo was discharged at Ifctrah instead of Muscat. This, while creating no special difficulty or expense would / entail The Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I J5., C.S.I., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.•ntail the transfer of a large part of the Customs Staff from Muscat to Matrah, a step which the Director Oeneral of Customs while agreeing may be a practical proposition, feels he cannot take until he has referred the matter to the Sultan on his return from Dhofar. Thus the matter stands. In point of actual fact however whether the wharf la extended or not, or whether the Customs are transferred from Muscat to M&amp;trah or not, I sincerely believe that due to the fact that in Muscat, the Doctor and barges are invariably waiting for the ship, the B.I. mail steamers experience less delay in Muscat than in any other port in the Persian Gulf. Indeed, during the course of conversation with different Captains of the mail steamers, they have admitted this. The exception is the Captain of the *Du■ra ,, , Captain Rainer. While socially a pleasant and delightful person, I believe this Captain to be extremely difficult to work with. He is, as is natural? invariably anxious to get away from Port at the appointed time, whether or not he has completed the loading or discharging. Owing to circumstances which are no doubt beyond his control he is unfortunately not always able to arrive on time. If, therefore, he arrives an hour or two hours late and insists on leaving according to his original programme, it is not altogether surprising that the shore people are not always able to make up this lost time. From the point of view of the shore, it is held that the fault lies with the Captain, who has given less time than was scheduled in the programme for the organisation of the loading and discharging. The Captain, however does not invariably appreciate the difficulties of our organising the barge turn over so as to fit the programme into a lesser number of hours, and in consequence if the discharge has not been completed, is Inclined to blame the shore people. I wish In no way to make a complaint about the Captain, whose sole purpose I am sure is to perform his duties in the best interest of his Company. I do feel, however, that Captain Rainer not infrequently / showsshows a lack of sympathy and understanding of the Agent's difficulties which mislead him into the belief that delays In the handling of cargo are solely and entirely the fault of the shore people* I believe that this feeling is shared by others in other Persian Gulf ports* 4« Almost as important as a regular call to lift cargo is a regular delivery of malls, and passenger service end I would earnestly request that it may be Impressed on Nbcklnnon and i&amp;ckensie that even though the 'Ds* are not able to spare time to ship heavy and large cargoes they should stop at Jlusoat for the hour or hour and a half which would he sufficient to pick up and land passengers and mall*12/3 &amp; IV14 Nlj'i Telegrafii From To No « iiin clair Political Fcsidont, Bahrain# Political Agent, Muscat. 91 Dated 22nd received 23rd January, 1948# Following from MafckKRxisx Mackinnon Mackenzie Bombay begins Hegret Barsova 1 * compelled omit Muscat due shortage coal.

Station Superintendent, Bahrain, from Lee, the Manager of the Southern A&amp;ia area. 2. I have discussed the question with Parker. It would appear that the only service which would have any chance of success would be one between Bahrain and Karachi using a small type of aircraft e.g. a Dove, and calling at Sharjah, Muscat and Gwadur en route. Before this could be established it would be necessary to do a good deal of work on the landing grounds at Muscat and Gwadur and to inst- al some kind of ground organisation at both these places. 3. I should be grateful if you could make such enquiries as are possible and ie t me have a rough estimate of the traffic, e.g. passengers, freight and mails, that would be likely to offer for such a ser vice at the landing grounds in your Agency. 4. Iraqi Airways are already operating between Kuwait and Baghdad and I understand their planes are usually half empty. Some time ago there was talk of an Indian line operating a service up the Gulf but nothing has been heard 6f this recently. Major A.C. Stewart, O.B.F Political Agent, M U S C A T 'LB' //?

As instructed, I am now writing to you officially on this matter and iffeel that I can do no better than enclose a copy of the relative letter from the Manager of our Southern Asia Area. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your obedient servant, Sd/- G.F.W. Parker Station Superintendent. 'LB*/ ^ BRITISH OVERSEAS AIRWAYS CORPORATION v MEMORANDUM From: Manager Southern Asia Area, To: Station Superintendent, Karachi. Bahrain. MSA.373/A.1238 22nd December, 1947. Air Services in the Persian Gulf. From a copy of the letter the Divisional Manager has written following his talk with you, I understand that you will shortly be contacting Sir Rupert Hay in order to obtain his views on the subject of Gulf Services. The Divisional Manager in his memorandum makes the following comment 'The only way in which we could really secure a dhare of local traffic would be to establish a local Company in Bahrain to run essentially M Dhow Traffic” Services. I believe that this has been suggested before and it might well be worth while considering in more detail. It would have to be a special type of 'third class” operation and would obviously have to keep its fares at the lowest possible level. When I hear from the Station Superintendent, Bahrain, I think it would be worth while having a discussion in order to examine these possibilities of such an organisation.” 2. As you are aware, now that steamer traffic has commenced the public have shown a disinclination to travel by air at the present rates, and when you write to the Divisional Manager you should certainly go into this aspect of the matter and indicate if lower fares are likely to re-influence this traffic on to the air route. If^ you are of the opinion that this might be so, then you should also indicate what you think the fares would have to be and give your reasons. 3. When considering the foregoing you should take into account that Iraqi Airways, and possibly Orient Airways, will be operating up the Gulf. If aircraft were based on Bahrain then it would appear that the main revenue might arise from the carriage of passengers to such places as Kuw&amp;it, Abadan, etc. and you should therefore review carefully the present traffic trend over these sectors and comment on the likely future growth in importance of these places and the resulting effect on the traffic potential.

In reply we would inform you that these vessels were primaraly designed to ot^i rate on the Company's Fast-Persian Gulf Mail service which, as you are aware, did not include calls at Muscat in pre-war days. However, in view of the shortage of tonnage, we endeavoured to include calls at Gwadur and Muscat in these vessels' itinerara-ries but found that the inclusion of these two ports did not permit these vessels to maintain a fortnightly passenger and cargo service from India to the maim Persian Gulf' ports, especially in view of the very poor port facilities availabl* at Muscat and the slow rate of loading and discharge. The Persian Gulf itineraries, however, are still under review a; d you may rest assured that we shall bear in mind extra calls at Muscat arid endeavour to arrange the programme -of the j-’cj.st and Subsidiary Mails to suit the requirements cf 8-11 concerned in the Persian Gulf area as far as possible.

Working on the assumption that we shall now get a regular fortnightly B.I. mail service, I estimate that Muscat would offer to air services an average of one passenger per eex throughout the year from Muscat to Karachi ai\d return from Karachi to Muscat. During the greater part of the year it is unlikely that there would be any applications for passages from Muscat to Bahrain or Basra, or from these places to Muscat except during the time of pilgrimage and Muharram. As regards nails - there should an average of 500/600 per week from Muscat to India and Pakistan and 200/300 per week from Muscat to Bahrain and Basra. As regards freight - I am afraid I have been unable to form apy estimate at all though most of the merchants assure me that they v/oula take periodical advantage of an air service to despatch small parcels to India and Pakistan. 3* I am afraid this is not a very satisfactory result to ray enquiries. It does seem, however, that while there may be a certain amount of traffic from Muscat to India and back, there is practically no traffic for Bahrain and Basra from and to Muscat. Any planes picking up or dropping passengers at Muscat therefore would have to be prepared to arrive and take off with empty seats. 4 representative of the British Petroleum Air Service which apparently has its headquarters at Basra, visited Muscat the other da} in the A.I.O.C. tanker ^Khuzistan* with a view to examining the stocks of aviation petrol, etc. and considering the points at / which The Honourable Sir Rupert Hay, K.C.I.E., I Political Resident, Persian Gulf Bahrain. »- 2 - which special stocks should be maintained, ks he appeared to have had sonie experience and knowledge of landing grounds, I asked him to look at the Muscat landing ground and give me his report. He told me that in his view the aerodrome was fit for landings by Dakota or Anson and even by small single-engine planes, provided the pilot flew low over the aerodrome to make a preliminary survey before landing. He specifically stated however that it would not be fit for landings by the Dove class aeroplane which have a tricycle undercarriage, the forewheel of which may become bogged in soft patches of sand which occur in the middle of the landing strip. /OONFICEWIAL JkO. Ho. C.106 - 2/21 -f '/fO Political Agency, Muscat# 17th February 1948# sin I mentioned in ray D.O# letter No# C. 107 - 12/3 oatad the 17th February 1948, that Mr# Berne, a representative of what he called 'The British Petroleum Air Service' had visited fAisoat in the A#I#0.G. tanker Khuzistan. He arrived without notice and landed without the usual visa, presumably as a member of the A#I.0#C# petroleum staff. He, however, called to see me and explained that what he referred to as 'The British Petroleum Air Service' was undertaking to stock supplies of aviation petrol at all aerodromes throughout the world, which could be paid for by pilots on a chit system. I gathered that he was touring the Gulf to see at which aerodromes it may be worth while maintaining stocks for this purpose. I could not make out whether Mr. Berne's trip was officially sponsored by his service, or whether he was merely taking the opportunity of a trip in the Khuzistan to improve hia local knowledge. I pointed out to him, however, that private f.uj 3n r t long the Arab coast was not normally welcomed, and in any case landings in the Sultan's territories could not be madd without authorisation.

The upshot of it was that v/e were to have calls from the slow nail steamers ( ships ) in both directions, i*e*, a service in each direction about once in two or three weeks• ^Things were ’ etter for a tine but now seems to be goinr frem bad to worse. The Barpeta has been taken off altogether, ihe other w© ships still call, but their visits are spaced so badly that they usually' almost coincide ; we get two together and then none for three weeks* Last month, owing to a cyclone, the up nail arrived four days after the down, so that we were able to answer promptly the nail received from you by bag. But this time the reverse is the case ; we are sending you a bag tomorrow, and receiving one from you on Wednesday, which we shall not be able to answer until the Barjora returns from Bombay. Of course we all realise the shortage of ships, but in view of ihe special conditions at ;?uscat I feel that these two ships do not really provide even a minimum emergency service. At best they can only do so on condition that their visits are spaced His Excellency Sir Rupert Hay, KCIK., CSX., Political Resident, Persian Gulf, Bahrain.spaced cut so that r:e get one or the oilier every ten days or so. Urgent letters can always be sent to Bahrain via Karachi and vice versa. But at present half the value of the? ships for nail purposes is being lost. A weekly service in one or the other direction ought surely not to be impossible. I hope you will see your way to pressing for an improvement•The P.R is doing &amp;11 he can to press this on which we all agreed. I hear runours that an extra P.I. ship is to touch here from January. ltd. R.L.E 6/12 —The Sub-Postmaster states that the present scales of emoluments f - u . fee. ^ - /‘57 ^4^ 't-u-ki ^ of postal clerks in India are Pay .. .. Rs.45-3-90 Dearness allowance .. Rs.18/- Good conduct allowance .. Rs.5/- and that at Muscat he is drawing the following emoluments: Grade pay .. .. Rs. 72 Charge allowance .. .. Rs. 37 House rent allowance .. Rs. 15 Allowance for Customs work .. Rs. 20 Dollar Exchange Compensation allowance Rs. 63 Total 207 p.m. In view of the poor emoluments no one is willing to come out to the Gulf to suffer exile and rrigors of Gulf climate without compensa- tion. Those who are forced to come cannot maintain a decent standard of living and remain discontented. The present Sub-Postmaster is finding it difficult to obtain living accommodation for himself for Rs.15/- p.m. and cooks himself as he cannot pay the high wages of servants. An Agency clerk at Muscat at present draws approximately Rs.300/- Lo% p.m including allowances and I suggest that Sub-Postmaster's emolu ments should be the same as those of a Residenty clerk. As regards defects and delays, Gwadur is a case in instance where, although steamers are now calling, mails are not accepted for despatch by steamers. l' •C'J UL-t, It-* , /to u i'‘ L ' ^ *10?- . &lt;f£.
