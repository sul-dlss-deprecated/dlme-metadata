The principal correspondents in the file are the Political Agent in Bahrain, the Political Resident, and the Adviser to the Government of Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave. Among the issues discussed in the correspondence are: obtaining permission from the Shaikh for ground surveys to be carried out at Manama, comments on the viability of laying a new runway that would be 3500 yards long, and the rejection of offers from the USATC [United States Army Transportation Corps] to build the new aerodrome.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000099#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000099#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
