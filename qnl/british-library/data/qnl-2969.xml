                           Elizacountry ship, Mr Woodhead, and his conduct towards a member of his crew, an African named Bilall. William Bruce, Resident at Bushire, states that Mr Woodhead has admitted to having the man beaten after he tried to swim away from the ship while at Bahrain. Bruce reports that the man has received treatment at Bushire, but is in such a state that Doctor James Dow, Assistant Surgeon at the Residency, expects him hourly to die. Bruce explains that he has brought this case to the notice of the Honourable Board so that it may be reported to the Register Office at Calcutta. Bruce encloses an extract from the
                           Eliza'slog book, dated 18 April 1820, which states that the man received six dozen lashes after deserting the ship at Bahrain on 5 March 1820.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024054291.0x000046#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
