As I was a member of the staff of the Kuwait Agency at the time and this was an official journey, I see no reason why the transaction should not figure in the Kuwait account, and every reason, on the score of practical convenience, why it should. I wonder if you would care to suggest to Kuwait that as a Grade VI post they are within their powers in shouldering responsibilities of this order,and even of paying the twelve rupees for coolie hire.
