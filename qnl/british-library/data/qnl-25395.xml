Much information has been added since, as a result of (a) fresh territory being brought under His Majesty 1 s Government 1 s tutelage (b), Mr.Watkin^^d transfer to 4°**^ and appointment to the post of Secretary for Commerce. The following points are noteworthy in the report:- l). T Value of Trade 1 figures on p.13, showing large increase of imports over pre-war figures. These figures however are in lakhs of Rupees, and the increased prices of commodities have to be ta.&amp;en into account. Reasons are given in explanationexplanation of the increase which show it to he probable that the increase will not be maintained unless production is increased and the transit trade eased by a reduction in freights etc. 2). One half to two thirds of the imports by sea find their way to Persia. The chief imports are in fact the chief exports - piece goods, tea and sugar, and the export is largely to Persia. (Coffee for some reason or other is not mentioned in the report. 'But there is a large importation of coffee, and it may be worth while ashing for figures. It is a vital necessity to Mesopotamia itself.) 3). As regards capability of expansion in imports and exports, the following are important a) Imports (i) Metals : the country can absorb a consider able quantity, and needs particularly copper, yellow metal, and tin. There should be a market for aluminium vessels. (ii) Timber : Figures for 1919 are low owing to large quantities of surplus timber sold by fax* Military. But there is a permanent demand which will increase as the country develops. Mach in e ry : -agricultural and otherwise. b) Exports ^ ^ (and if) the quality is improved and the quantity increased by bringing vast new areas under cultivation. (But it is doubtful how far improvement can take place under an Arab Government, or sufficient security be maintained). (ii) Wool; Extension of agriculture will fend to decrease grazing-grounds for sheep. Until then, increase in production of wool seem certain. War-time figures /-A V A Up— ^ ^Minute Paper. Department 7 (• (C-j |v^ figures are low probably because of the vast numbers of sheep taken by the army. (Much could be done in improving the quality of the wool). (iii) Gum : On N. and H.E. frontiers and hills of South Persia. Collecting areas Mosul and Sulaimaniyah. Requires cheap means of transport. (iv) Tobacco : in Sulaimaniyah and Arbil divisions. An e:xpert who toured the tobacco growing districts stated that radical improvements in methods of growing, curing and baling are necessary before the tobacco can become suitable for export. (v) Oil; Speculative(?) (To these may be added, though not mentioned in the report, (vi) Reeds for pulp, all ready for use^ Fruits of various kinds, besides dates, if exploited.) Attention is drawn also to p.Sl paragraph (viii) °n cotton . The Government experimental farms have shown excellent results, and the British Cotton Growing Association has reported favourably. Notes are contained in the report as (ix) ((xi) Hides are not mentioned but may be considered.) 4). Important factors in the trade situation are .ed to and discussed in the report, such as Currency difficulties, the exchange, the lack of enterprise and improved business methods in tine Sulphur and (x) Gyps^um.

Labour (v«Mr•Watkins 1 report of December 1919)• (Shipping and freights are discussed in Mr. Watkins 1 letter of 1919). The points most striking in the situation would seem to be the close trade connection bet?/een Mesopotamia and Persia, the considerable resources of the country if only methods could be improved, and the scarcity of labour. As regards Persia, Mesopotamia being the channel through which so much is imported to Persia, British Trade would probably be interested to see a trade situation report for Persia alongside the report for Mesopotamia. There is one field readti for immediate enterprise, i.e. the exploiting of the wealth of Reeds in Lower Mesopotamia. A firm has applied for a concession. But the Foreign Office are against concessions 'being given until the peace treaty is ratified for fear of incurring unfriendly representations from the United States Government, etc.:yet the world shortage of paper is acute.

RETURNS FOR JANUARY'JUNE, 1920. i^^-eturns. relating to passenger traffic between the United Kingdom and places outside Europe, and not within the Mediterranean Sea, show that the number of persons of British nationality who left the United Kingdom as passengers for such countries during? the six \nonths ended June, 1920, exceeded the nuinber who'^rrived as passengers from such countries by 69,639. In the corresponding period of 1919 an inward balance of 5,810 was recorded. • The movement of British subjects during the first half of the year 1920 shows a balance outward of 40,909 passengers to British North America, 13,848 passengers to Australia and New Zealand, and 16,188 passengers to the United States, while inward balances are shown from British South Africa and India. As regards the movement of aliens between this country and non-European countries during the first half of 1920, an inward balance of '30,734 is shown, as against 4,026 in the corresponding period of 1919. In the traffic between the United Kingdom and the Con tinent of Europe there was an excess outward of 12,912, as compared with 100,080 in the corresponding period of 1919, and 13,130 in 1918. Theie figures relate to alien passengers as well as to British. Separate par ticulars as to the number of alie A passengers from and to the Continent are not furnished to the Board of Trade. A return issued by the Home Office, under the Aliens’ Order, 1920, shows tha| the number of aliens who landed at ports in the Uhited Kingdom from all countries during the first haff of 1920 exceeded the number that embarked at thole ports by 18,291. The following table gives particulars of the numbers of passengers, including emigrants and immigrants, who travelled between the United Kingdom and places outside Europe during th| first two quarters of the years 1919 and 1920. Particulars for each quarter of 1919 were published in tbfe issue of the “ Journal ” of 15th April last (Yol. Civ., No. 1220). MOVEMENT, SIX MONTHsJeNDED JUNE, 1919 AND 1920. OutwaiA. Inward.

THE COUNTRY AND ITS TRADE. At the present moment in Mesopotamia trade con ditions are necessarily affected by the political situa tion ; but so much has been done to place the trade of the country upon a comparatively stable basis and to make a beginning with internal development, that the Report upon the. conditions of trade during last year prepared in the Civil Commissioner’s Office at Baghdad, cannot fail to excite interest. Thei great alluvial plain of Mesopotamia, with its 120,000 square miles of area, and its scattered popu lation numbering now some 2,800,000, had before the war no properly equipped seaport, and few means of internal communication except by the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. Even river navigation, especially of the Euphrates, was greatly restricted by narrows and shallows. Ocean steamers which passed from the Persian Gulf up the Shatt-el-Arab depended entirely on their own gear and on native river craft for the landing and shipping of cargo. Now there are at Basra adequate wharves, capable of accommodating deep steamers, fitted up With cranes and laid out with railway sidings.398 THE board of trade j ournal. September 30, 1920. SPECIAL ARTICLES-continued. 'The Port was constructed in order that militaiy °I &gt; 0^ ions mlghT be carried on effectively, and now rema- ior the purpose of commerce. There ^ ^7oml ■railway lines, (chiefly of metre gauge). Shargat towards the north, the Persian frontier to the in the south are all now connected with Bagh _ y rail. Roads have been improved until many of them can carry light motor traffic and some few will bear motor lorries. So far, at least, as communications are concerned, the war has wrought a very great and bene ficial change in Mesopotamia. Customs Administration. Duty is collected on imports and exports at Basra and at Baghdad, the dutiable importations at Baghdad being restricted to goods on a through bill of lading. The principal land Customs frontier stations are near Khanigin on the Persian frontier, Mosul and Sulai- maniyah. Sea Customs are levied in accordance with^ the Indian Sea Customs Act, as applied by adaptation to Mesopotamia, and the land Customs under the Land Customs Proclamation. There is ample provision of public bonded warehouses and free shipment from vessel to vessel is permitted at Basra free^ of duty. Goods manifested for transhipment to foreign ports are allowed to be landed in the course of transhipment without payment of duty or transit fees. The regulations governing the admission into Meso potamia of samples and patterns brought by commercial travellers are practically the same as those in force in India. Weights and Measures. Two weights are widely known, though there is great diversity in the use of weights. The people are most familiar with the Constantinople oke (2-8282 lb.) and the kilogram, the oke being more nearly universal for the higher weights. Steps have been taken with a view to the ultimate standardisation of the oke, though the reform will take a long time to effect. The scales used are crude: there is a considerable opening for a simple and cheap weighing apparatus. The steelyards of the wholesale merchants are calibrated in okes. The difficulty of standardising terms of weight may be seen from the diversity in use of the “ Maund. ” A maund of dates in one part of Basra is 54 okes, in other parts of Basra 60 okes, a maund of coffee is 50 okes, of soap 6 okes, of sugar 10 okes, of tobacco 70 okes, and of pepper 11 okes. Here we have the oke constant at 2-82821b., but the maund with seven different usages. Both the metre and the English yard are well known in Basra, Baghdad and Mosul; but there are many other “ yards ” in use, and for the present no attempt is being made to lay down a universal standard of length. Currency. The complex pre-war currency of Irak (Lower Meso potamia) has been simplified by the introduction dur ing the war of rupees (silver and notes). The rupee has now become established as the principal medium of exchange, the only other currency in the field being the gold lira. No statutory legal tender exists, but the rupee has already the sanction of usage. The gold lira is not as a rule accepted by the Government or the banks, except as bullion, and its value has fluctu- ated violently. Some uncertainty no doubt exists as to the future position of the lira (both paper and gold), but there is a sufficient quantity of rupees and small change (in the shape of half and quarter rupees, and • nickel and copper subdivisions of the rupee) in circula tion to meet ordinary trade requirements, and the only practical disadvantage to business arising from the un certainty as to the lira is in connection with the valua tion of existing stocks. Foreign Exchange. The principal foreign rates of exchange quoted in the Baghdad and Basra markets are:— (a) Rates for Rs. 100 for Kran bills on Kirmanshah, ' Hamadan, etc. ,;V : ; ’(b) Rates per £100 for Sterling bills on London. SPECIAL ARTICLES— continued. The rates for Kran bills are directly influenced from day to day by the activity of the Imperial Bank of Persia in its Kran-Sterling transactions between Teheran and London, although the larger changes are partly seasonal, depending upon the requirement for financing the crops in Persia, and partly attnhgable to causes ranging over long periods, dependingFV ately upon the sterling price of silver; the rate has varied from less than 200 to more than 400. The Sterling exchange is mainly influenced by the current Bombay- London rates and the freedom with which the Irak Government is able to sell rupee telegraphic transfers on India. During the military operations imports were natur ally much in excess of exports by sea. The banks have been assisted to find “ cover” for the difference by Government sales of telegraphic transfers on Bom bay, Karachi and Calcutta, at par, up to the limit of the requirements of funds for military purposes. Until near the close of the financial year 1918-19 Govern- ment was able to meet trade needs in full, owing to the heavy local military demands for funds. In April, 1919, however, when military requirements showed some diminution, it became necessary to “ ration ” the sale of transfers for a few months; and this occurred again in the spring of 1920, when the banks were obliged to export notes in considerable quantities to India, though for a short time the opposite was the case, when the banks refrained almost entirely from tendering for transfers, thus compelling the Govern ment to meet military demands for funds by drawing from the Currency Chest, and, on occasion, importing specie from India. During the financial year ended 31st March, 1920, the monthly sales of transfers on India totalled Rs. 9,82,06,000, varying from Es. 40,50,000 in June, 1919, to Rs. 1,24,48,000 in December, 1919, with Rs. 94,48,000 as the total for the final month of the official year, compared with Rs. 79,50,000 in February. Financing Trade. Importers and exporters finance themselves in two ways:— (a) Those who have their own firms abroad (or have the requisite credit) who ship to them or to whom they ship sending the documents direct and making or receiving remittances as separate trans actions through the banks or by adjustments in the current accounts. (b) Those who do business by sending their documents through the bank or a financial house for collection. Goods are purchased in Mesopotamia by means of promissory notes (compialas), giving at most three or four months credit—formerly the period was from four to six months. The practice of renewing compialas at the due date is said to have deased, and only such compialas as can be discounted are acceptable. Branches in Mesopotamia have been established by the Eastern Bank of London, the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the Imperial Ottoman Bank. FOREIGN TRADE. During the last two years there has been a marked increase in the imports into Mesopotamia. In 1919 the goods coming through Basra w r ere valued at 1,399 lakhs of rupees (100,000) against 1,110 lakhs in 1919, and 398 lakhs in 1912. The total import trade for 1919, including land imports into Baghdad, was valued at 1,840 lakhs. The increased importation of foreign goods into the country has been due partly to the presence of troops and the depletion of stocks under war conditions, and largely to the almost complete cessation of imports into Persia via the Caucasus. It is estimated that from one-half to three-quarters of the goods imported by sea eventually find their way kd 0 Persia, and it cannot therefore be emphasised too much that the trade of Mesopotamia is closely allied with that of Persia, or with that portion of Persia which can be reached easily by way of Baghdad.

Piece-goods to* the value of 529 lakhs of rupees, and almost all the sugar and tea exported in 1919 were destined for Persia. Wool exports were only 15,150 bales in 1919 as against 27,500 bales in 1918. In 1916 and 1917 there were 13,063 bales and 16,343 bales respectively as compared with 43,290 bales in 1912. The reduction in exports, during and since the war is probably temporary, and due to the reduction in the flocks caused by the military demands for mutton. AGRICULTURE. Barley and dates form the bulk of the export trade in agricultural produce. The land under cultivation is capable of enormous extension. The methods of the Arab farmer are primitive though his skill is consider able. All agricultural implements in present use are hand made. There are openings for the simplest as well as for the most complicated agricultural machinery. The Agricultural Directorate offers facilities for trials of new machinery on its central station at Baghdad, and machines which pass the trials can be demonstrated on the five district stations. The results of the trials are awaited with great interest. Agricultural labourers trained in the use of Western machinery are now available. Openings exist for dairying appliances, grass and wool presses, flour mills and oil mills, and also for arti ficial manures. Trustworthy vegetable seeds are in demand, and improved varieties of fruit trees com mand attention. River conservancy and flood protection are at present more important than irrigation. The Arab will co-operate with the Irrigation Department to bring water to his land, but he is not eager to do hard work on flood banks, of which he does not appreciate the benefit. The bulk of the heavy work on flood protec tion has now been done, and the task of the future will be chiefly that of maintenance. The Irrigation Depart ment is at present confining itself to small and imme diately remunerative schemes. 5 b® k * ni» is &amp; Notes on Trade. [While\every care is exercised to ensure the accuracy of any explcoqfiatory articles or notes relating to Acts, Hegvla- tions, Orders, etc., published in the “Journal,” it must be understood that such explanations are necessarily in the nature of summaries, and cannot be quoted as authoritative legal interpretations of the text of the documents them selves.] LICENCES TO EXPORT GOODS FROM GERMANY. The attention of II.M. Government was recently called to a case in which one of the local organisations which have' been set up in Germany for the purpose of deciding on applications for licences to e&amp;port goods from that country refused to issue a licence/to a British firm domiciled at Cologne on the express ground that the applicants were not of German nationality. H.M. Government took the view that, having regard to Article 276 (d) of the Peace Treaty, the German licence issuing authorities are not entitled to dis criminate against the nationals of the r Allied and Asso ciated Powers domiciled in Germany in favour of German nationals. Representations on the subject were accordingly made to the German Government by H.M. Representative in Berlin; and the German Government‘have now intimated that the various ex port control offices in Germany have been instructed that the refusal of an export licence on the ground of the foreign nationality of the applicant is inadmissible, and that in dealing with applications for export licences the question of the nationality of the applicant is not to be taken into account. In view of this decision, it is anticipated that British firms domiciled in Germany who desire to export goods from that country will in future be under no disability on account of their nationality. In cases, however, where firms in the United Kingdom place orders for goods in Germany, with firms of German or other nationality, it is, generally speaking, advisable that the application for an export licence, where such is necessary, should not be/made by the purchasing firm in this country, but should be left to the prospective supplier of the goods in Germany, as this procedure, as the German Government have pointed out, greatly facilitates the practical administration of the system of export control by the feerman authorities.

The “ Journal Officiel ” (Paris) of 15th September published two Decrees, dated 11th September, dealing with the special charges for the registration of trade marks, established by the Law of 26th June. To one of the Decrees is annexed a classified list of the articles for which a trade mark may be employed. The text of the Decrees, together with the classified list referred to, may be consulted, at the Enquiry Office- of the Department of Overseas Trade, 35, Old Queen Street, Westminster, S.W. 1.

The representatives of 200 firms from B^ingtam and the surrounding districts visited t ^ mules Exhibition that was held m the othces of | nnm'ham Chamber of Commerce f;rom Monday, 20th September, to Thursday, 23rd September. The samples-which were of German, Swedish, Swiss French Argentine, and United States manu ac- tuTe-were collected by H.M. Trade Commissioners and Commercial Secretaries in India, Holland, Finland Switzerland and South America, and comprised Aluminium' ware, Enamel ware, Tools, Electrical Goods, and Brushes and Brooms. The samples which excited mosl interest were the Aluminium ware and Enamel ware of recent German manufacture ; the general opinions expressed being that the former were priced considerably above better class ^oods of British manufacture, and that from such com- pedition home firms had nothing to fear. The Enamel ware also was considered of low grade and high price. The Brushes.—mainly of Argentine manufacture-—• were an indication of the extent to which that country had developed her home industries in this particular line during the war, and although crude in finish and construction, were made of good quality material, and illustrated a form of competition that could not lightly be disregarded. Most of the domestic electrical goods were of Swiss and United States manufacture, and local firms engaged in producing similar articles found a good deal to inter est them in the methods of manufacture, particularly in respect of minor devices that suggested ideas for im provement m their own products. About 200 samples were loaned to firms at the close of the Exhibition for further examination. MOTOR SHOW IN NEW ZEALAND.

It is bounded on the N. and N.E. by Kurdistan where the plain rises into foothills and mountains; on the S. by the Persian Gulf and the Arabian desert, on the E. by Persia, and on the W. by the Arabian and Syrian deserts. Its area is about 120,000 square miles; its popu lation being about 2,800,000 composed of Transhipment in Bombay ex B.I.S.N. and P. &amp; (). Steamers. Strict Line from the U.K. India Office steamers. Basrah Agents : Messrs. Strict, Scott &amp; Co., Ltd. Andrew Weir &amp; Co.’s steamers from the U.K. Basrah Agents : Messrs^. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. Arab Steamers, Ltd. N Mogul Line. Persian Gulf S.N. Co., from Bombay. Basrah Agent: Abdul Jabar Khedairy. A large volume of trade is carried on by native craft plying- between Basrali, Gulf ports, India, East Africa and Aden. Duty is collected on imports and exports by sea at Basrah and at Baghdad, the dutiable importations at the latter place being restricted to goods on a through bill of lading: this provision is necessary to enable the volume of trade dealt with in Baghdad to be limited to the quantity for which Customs accommodation is obtainable. There is a Collector of Customs at each of these places, their decisions are subject to appeal to the Chief Collector of Customs, who is Chief Customs authority and whose office is in Baghdad. The Collector of Customs, Baghdad, has charge of the land Customs frontier stations of which the principal are at Tirauq (near Khaniqin on the Persian frontier), Mosul and Sulaimaniyah, at each of which places there is a Deputy Collector. Sea Customs are levied in accordance with the Indian Sea Customs Act (VIII of 1878 as amended) which applies mvtatis mutandis to Mesopotamia. Land Customs are collected under the Land Customs Proclamation (Appendix I). The following notes indicate some of the provisions -of the Sea Customs Act; the full text of the Act may be purchased at Government book depots in England or India : — (a) Vessels^ are not allowed to discharge any cargo until the Captain or his Agent has obtained written permission from the Collector of Customs to do so (Sections 57, 59 and 81).

Vessels, other than Ocean-going- steamers, arriving from places south of Fao are required to stop for examination at the Customs House at tao (Sections 17, 5d). (d) No goods shall be landed at or shipped from any place not duly appointed as a wharf except with the written permission of the Customs Collector or under general permission of the Chief C us- toms authority (Sections 73 and 74).

(e) Except with the written permission of the Customs Collector no goods other than passengers’ baggage shall be discharged* shipped or water borne to be shipped on Sundays, holidays or between sunset and sunrise (Section 72). (/) No goods may be shipped or water borne to be shipped without a duly passed shipping-bill signed by the Collector of Customs (Sections 136 and 137) and no goods may be discharged into a lighter to be landed without a boat note (Section 76). (ff) No vessel may leave the port without a port clearance signed by the Collector of Customs (Section 63 to Section 66). In the case of steamers this port clearance must be applied for by the master or his Agent, 24 hours before departure, the application must be accompanied by the manifest or Agents’ guarantee to produce it within 5 days and also by Ihe Agents’ declaration that lie will be liable for any penalty imposed in respect of short landed cargo and will discharge all claims for damage or short delivery which may be established by the owper of any goods comprised in the import cargo in respect of such goods. (Note. —In the case of sailing vessels applicatien 24 hours before leaving Basrah is not insisted upon). (h) The owner of goods landed must enter the goods for clearance by delivering a bill of entry in the prescribed form (Section 86) containing inter alia, the particulars contained in Section 29 which is as follows : — (29) On the importation into, or exportation from, any Customs Port of any goods, whether liable to duty or not; the owner of such goods shall, in his bill-of-entry or shipping-bill, as the case may be, state the real value, quantity and description of such goods to the best of his knowledge and belief, and shall subscribe a declaration of the truth of such statement at the foot of such bill. “ In case of doubt, the Customs Collector may require any such owner or .any other person in possession of any invoice, broker’s note, policy of insurance or other document, whereby the real value, quantity or description of any such goods can be ascertained, to produce the same^ and to furnish any information relating to such value, quantity or description which it is in his power to furnish. And thereupon such person shall produce such docu ment and furnish such information. “ Provided that if the owner makes and subscribes a declaration before the Customs Collector, to the effect that he is unable, from want of full information, to state the real value or contents of any case, package, or parcel of goods, then the Customs Collector shall permit him, previous to the entry thereof, (1) to open such case, package or parcel, and examine the contents in oresence of an Officer of Customs, or (2) to deposit such case, package or parcel in a public warehouse appointed under Section 15 without ware housing the same, pending the production of such information.” (i) The “ real value ” referred to in Section 29 is defined by Section 30 which is printed hereafter. “ (30) For the purpose of this Act the real value shall be deemed to be— “ ( a ) the wholesale cash price, less trade discount, for which goods of the like kind and quality are sold, or are capable of being'sold, at the time and place of importation or exportation, as the case may be, without any abatement or deduction whatever, except (in the case of goods imported) of the amount of the duties* par able on the importation thereof; or “ (b) Where such price is not ascertainable, the cost at which ooods of the like kind and quality could be delivered at such place without any abatement or deduction except as aforesaid.” (?) Unties or charges short levied by the Customs are recoverable within thiee months and similarly no refunds of excess payments are payable unless claimed within three months (Sections 39 and 40).(k) When goods capable of being easily identified are re-exported from Basrah by sea (this is at present interpreted as including river transport to Muhammarah) a drawback of 7 / 8 of the import duty paid on importation is payable provided that-— (i) the goods are identified to the satisfaction of the Collector of Customs * (it) the re-export is made within two years of the date of importation (in) the claim is for more than 5 rupees (iv) the goods are worth more than the drawback claimed (r) the claim to receive such drawback is made and established at the time of re-export (Sections 42, 49, 50 and 51). (l) The penalties for contravening the Act or rules are detailed in Section 167 (1) to (80); confiscation of any goods includes any package in which they are found and all the other contents there of. Every vessel, cart or other means of conveyance used in the removal of goods liable to confiscation is also liable to confisca tion (Section 168). (m) An appeal against any order by an officer subordinate to the Chief Collector of Customs, lies to the latter officer. Similarly the Civil Commissioner has power to reverse or modify any decision or order passed by the Chief Collector of Customs (Sections 188, 190 and 191). The following is a list of the principal articles the importation of which into Mesopotamia is prohibited : — (а) Counterfeit coin. (б) Obscene books, drawings or articles.

This privilege is subiect to the goods being conveyed to the frontier within 90 days and to the packages and seals being intact; the period in the case of imports by land and export by sea is extended to 180 days when necessary. Free shipment from vessel to vessel is permitted in Basrah free of duty and goods manifested for transhipment to foreign ports are permitted to be landed in the course of transhipment without payment of duty or transit fees. * Vide Schedule C of Appendix VIII. t COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS. The regulations governing the admission into Mesopotamia of samples and patterns brought by commercial travellers are practically the same as those in force in India; they are printed as Appendix II. Travellers proceeding to Persia by rail after having visited Basrah and Baghdad should call at the office of the Collector of Customs _ at the latter place in order that suitable arrangements may be made for their convenience at the frontier. BASRAH PORT FACILITIES. One of the benefits, and perhaps not the least which the inhabitants of Mesopotamia reap as a result of the war and the taking over by Great Britain of Mandatory powers for the country, is the provision of a ready made and well found Port. Prior to the war, no facilities existed and ships depended entirely on their own gear and native craft for the landing and shipping of cargo. The very large quantities of war material however which were poured into the countrv made it necessarv to provide adequate wharves, capable of accom modating deep steamers, and fitted with up-to-date cranes and laid out with/ ? During the first four months of the current year (January to April inclu sive) 112 steamers with general cargoes entered and left the Port. The average figures per steamer (tonnage and Dues paid) work out as follows : — Gross Regstd. Tonnage. 3428 Tons. Schedule “ A ”. Rs. 705 Sch. “ G ”. Sch. “ I ”. Sch. “ L ”. Sch. “ N ” Rs. 281 Rs. 594 Rs. 60 Rs. 270 # Note. —All Steamers did not incur charges for use of wharves and cranes (Schedule “ G ’ and “ T ”) figures shewn represent actual average amount paid by steamers which did incur these charges :— • On goods the ordinary charges incurred are : — Schedule “B” Port Dues. Rs. 0/8/0 per ton. “C” Landing charges, if discharg ed over a wharf. Various according to commodity, roughly Rs. 2/4/- per ton. Landing charges, if discharg ed overside steamer but alongside a wharf. One third of full landing charge. If discharged in stream. Nil. Schedule 'C” Removal charge, which inclu des removal from ships slings on wharf, checking, convey ance to storage shed or Dump sorting and stacking in readiness for delivery, and storage for four days after ship has completed discharge, or ten days from date of arrival of the steamer. Rs. 4/- per ton. If required to re-ship cargo for removal from wharves by water, a further handling charge of Rs. 4 per ton is made which includes cranage, etc., and use of the wharves by removing craft. As a matter of fact practically all cargo is again removed by water so that local Merchants pay the Port approximately Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 per ton. Baghdad Transhipment Cargo if landed and re-shipped incurs the same charges, but as facilities for storing this cargo do not yet exist at Margil, the bulk of it is discharged by steamers overside into Barges. If no labour has been provided by the Port and barges proceed direct up country the Port charges which would then have been incurred would amount to only from Re. 1-12 to Rs. 2 per ton. In practice it is seldom possible to despatch these barges direct and failing shed accommodation in the Port Area the cargo is removed by Ships’ Agents for storage elsewhere (Siefs, Customs, Ho. 2 Sm etc.). Government consignments are as a rule loaded fifom Ocean steamers into Railway waggon for direct despatch to Military Department concerned. For the first four months of the current year the comparative quantities of the cargo landed were: — Government Commercial Local. Commercial Baghdad (Through) 1,21,229 ton, 54,085 9,175 During the same period Sea-going Native Sailing Craft paid port dues at the rate of -/2/- per ton on vessels and -/8/- per ton on goods on 42,968 tons. The Port equipment includes a powerful floating crane capable of lifting BO tons. The Schedule of Port Charges is printed as Appendix VIII. COMMUNICATIONS. The main communications in Mesopotamia are by river and rail whilst roads capable of carrying light motor traffic and in a few instances motor lorries have been made in many directions. Communications existing at the present date are shown in the map (Appendix IN). The river communications are the Tigris and Euphrates, the former being navigable by river steamers and barges to Baghdad, and to a lesser •degree to Tikrit. Vessels and rafts of inflated skins bring merchandise and country produce down the upper reaches of Hie Tigris and the Greater and Lesser Zab rivers. A {$r (£&gt; el^lie Euphrates is navigable by shallow draft stern wheel steamers from Basrah to Samawah in the flood season, and above that by country craft and rafts. The conveyance of goods by river steamers is almost entirely in the hands of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company whose present rates of freight for Basrah-Baghdad are Rs. 65 to Rs. 75 per ton. In 1918 they were Rs. 60 to Rs. 100 whilst prior to the war they were Rs. -30 to Rs. 40. Corresponding rates for the downward journey are Rs. 30, Rs. 10—Rs. 30 and Rs. 10—Rs. 20. Cargo is still conveyed from Basrah to Baghdad by large country craft but the rates are much higher than formerly and the journey is very slow. A usual rate of freight for a Mahailah carrying 25-30 tons from Basrah to Baghdad is Rs. 500. Steamer traffic on the rivers being practically entirely in the hands of a single Company, it is of the utmost importance that the Railways should remain in complete and effective Government control. There are 875 miles of railway (usually metre gauged) of which the principal lines are: — Basrah—Baghdad 354 miles. Baghdad—Rut 104 miles. Baghdad—Shargat (broad gauge) 186 miles. Baghdad—Quraitu (Persian frontier) 130 miles. ihe last named runs to the Persian frontier whence arrangements are being made to continue into Persia along the probable line Kirmanshah- Hamadan-Teheran. A branch line runs from Qaraghan to Kingarbah. The railway freights for cargo are : — Basrah to Baghdad Rs. 416 per 10 ton truck. ✓ Ivut to Baghdad Rs. 131 per 10 ton truck. Kut to Tirauq (via Baghdad) Rs. 277 per 10 ton-truck. Rates for portions of a truck are slightly higher per ton. A ten ton truck can only be loaded with the full 10 tons if the nature of the cargo is favourable to close stowage. Roads in Mesopotamia vary in quality, few of them are metalled and consequently many of them are rendered impassable for considerable periods y ram.

The reform must however take long sinco the grea,t bulk of merchants use crude scales jyid lumps of iron or stone with the additions of bits of wire. There is a considerable opening for the introduction of simple weighing apparatus which however must be cheap.

There is greater diversity of practice in the adoption of a standard of length; both the metre and English yard are well known in Basrah, Baghdad and Mosul, but there are many other “ yards ’’ in use. It has been decided for the^ present not to attempt to enforce a universal standard of length. An example of the diversity of practice in weights may be gathered from the following examples taken from Basrah: — . i J aJfi* ' : - ' sbfi 1'-' * ' l Mauud of dates in parts of Basrah = 51 okes..j. r; ... a ] 1( ,, other parts of Basrah = 60 okes. f t ; coffee = 50 okes. . ; \ ; ;l [ . •; u, •; 1 soap sugar = 6 „ j i - 10 „ .

The somewhat complex Currency system prevailing in ‘Iraq before the war was considerably simplified by the introduction of rupees (silver and notes) as the regular medium by which the Expeditionary. Force paid for its local purchases, and in which, as far as possible, the Civil Administration received payment of its dues. The change was effected in the ordinary course of administration, without recourse to official Proclamation or other special machinery, except in the single instance of a “ Proclamation of December, 1916,” by which traffic was forbidden in Turkish Government' paper. The rupee currency is now established as the principal medium of exchange, rupee paper standing not infrequently at a premium, the only other currency m the field being the gold lira, which is used chiefly in local purchases such as live-stock, wool, houses and land, and in inter-tribal transactions. No- statutory legal tender exists, but the claim of the rupee to this status has the sanction of usage, while the gold lira is not being accepted, except in a few special cases, in payment of Government dues nor dealt in by the Banks, otherwise than as bullion. In the latter capacity, the lira has been the object of considerable speculation, and its value has fluctuated violently during the last twelve months. Apart from the special influence of speculation, the local exchange rale between liras and rupees fluctuates from day to day, according to the supply and demand. The chief determining factors are: — (а) Rupee sterling rate (б) Sterling gold rate (c) Availability of gold bullion in London and elsewhere. (d) Cost and availability of freight, and cost of insurance. In April 1919, when the rupee sterling rate was Is. 6cL, the lira-rupee rate- in Baghdad waSi about Rs. 18; while in May, 1920, the rates were respectively about 2s. Id. and Rs. 13-12. For the special purpose of the repayment of debts, a Proclamation of 1917 fixed the exchange value of the lira at Rs. 14-4, and the rate was adopted also in the few cases m which the lira was accepted m payment of Government dues. The recent alteration in the rupee conversion rate of the sovereign has ed to a corresponding reduction in the official rate for the lira, which now stands, for the purpose of payment of revenue, at Rs. 9.03125. In the interest of debtors the 1916 Proclamation against the use of Turkish Government paper currency has been cancelled and re-payment of debts m paper permitted m certain cases. . . • . Some uncertainty no doubt exists-as to the future position of the liia (both paffer and and gold), butithere is a sufficient quantity of rupees and small change (in the shape of , half and quarter rupees, and nickel and copper subdivisions of the rupee) in circulation to meet ordinary trade requirements, and the only practical disadvantage to business arising irom the uncertainty as to the lira is in connection with the valuation of existing stocks. I . h. /, II. Foreign Exchange. j The principal foreign rates of exchange quoted in the Baghdad and Basrah markets are: — (q) Rates per Rs. 10,0 for Kran bills on Kirmanshah, Hamadan, &amp;c. (6) Rates per £100 for Sterling bills on London. 1 The former is directly influenced from day to day by the activity of the Imperial Bank of Persia in its Kran Sterling transactions between TeheranI ! ’ hy 10 and London, although the larger changes are partly seasonal, depending upon the requirements for financing the crops in Persia, and partly attributable to causes ranging over long periods, depending ultimately upon the sterling price of silver; it has varied from less than 200 to more than 400. The latter is mainly influenced by the current Bombay-London rates and the freedom with which the ‘Iraq Government is able to sell rupee telegraphic transfers on India. III. Government Assistance in Financing the Import Trade. During the occupation imports were naturally much in excess of exports sea. The banks have been assisted to find “ cover ” for the difference by Government sales of telegraphic transfers on Bombay, Karachi and Calcutta, at par, up to the limit of the requirements of funds for military purposes. Until nearly the end of the financial year 1918-19 Government was able to meet trade requirements in full, owing to the heavy local military demands for funds. In April, 1919, however, when military requirements showed some diminution, it became necessary to “ ration ” the sale of transfers for a few months; and this state of affairs re-appeared in the Spring of 1920, during which period the Banks found themselves obliged to export notes in considerable quantities to India, though for a short time the opposite pheno menon displayed itself, when the Banks refrained almost entirely from tendering for transfers, thus compelling the Government to meet military •demands for funds by drawing from the Currency Chest and on occasion importing specie from India. The following table shows the monthly sales of transfers on India dnrirm the financial vear 1919-20: — 1919. April May June J uly August September October November December 1920.

The following notice published in June, 1919, sets forth the position resultant on the publication of the Companies’ Proclamation {vide Appendix IV) : — The recently published Companies’ Proclamation of the 2nd June, 1919, makes provision for the formation of limited liability companies within the Occupied Territories. Under Turkish Law (Ottoman Code of Commerce, Section 28) every limited liability company was incorporated by a special decree of the Central Govern ment, authorising its formation and approving its conditions of association. Similarly in accordance with Section 2 of the Proclamation, for the formation of a limited company an order by the Civil Commissioner sanctioning its Memo randum and Articles of Association and authorising its formation will now be necessary. Section 4 of the Proclamation enacts that the Indian Enactments entitled the Indian Companies Act, 1913, and 1914, subject to some amendments to suit the conditions of the administration of this country, shall be applicable within the Occupied Territories. The practical effect of the Proclamation therefore is that the formation of limited liability companies is subject to the same regulations as are in force in India, with the additional requirement that before a company can be registered an order of the Civil Commissioner sanctioning the formation of the company and approving the Memorandum and Articles of Association, if any, must be obtained. Alterations in the Memorandum and Articles of Association will also require the sanction of the Civil Commissioner. In order to safeguard the credit of companies carrying on legitimate business in this country and to afford some protection to the public who are without experience in the formation and flotation of companies, it is necessary that the Government should exercise control over the formation of Companies, and restrictions will for the present be placed on the raising of the capital of companies by public subscription. The office of the Registrar of Companies will for the present be located in the Judicial Secretary’s Office, and all applications relating to the forma tion of companies should be addressed to the Judicial Secretary. TRADE NAMES PROCLAMATION. The Trade Names Proclamation of April 28th, 1919, is printed as Appen dix V, it provides for the observance of the following rules: — An abstract of all partnerships must be registered in the Court of First Instance, recording: (1) the names in full, descriptions -and residences and nationality of the partners other than shareholders with limited liability or com mandite partners; (2) the trade name of the partnership; (3) names of those of the partners authorised to conduct or manage the business or to sign for the partnership; (4) the total capital contributed or to be contributed in shares or loans on commandite; (5) the date fixed for the commencement and termination of the partner ship. The rules do not apply to limited liability companies. MERCHANDISE MARKS AND INFRINGEMENT OF PATENTS. The Indian Merchandise Marks Act (IV of 1889) as amended by the Indian Merchandise Marks and Sea Customs Act (IX of 1891) ha\e been applied to Mesopotamia. The infringement of a patent is punishable by Section 293 of the Baghdad Penal Code of which the following is a copy: 293. (i) Every person who prints, or causes to be printed, any book in disregard of the laws and regulations as to the copyright of the authors or who manufactures, or causes to be manufactured, any article m regaid to which an exclusive right has been granted to an individual or to a body of persons, is guilty of the misdemeanour of infringement of an exclusive light. (H) Any book or article constituting an infringement of an exclusive right shall be confiscated in favour of the owner of the right, and the person guilty of the infringement shall be punished with fine not exceeding L. I .10 .Look or article which constitutes an infringement as aforesaid shall be a fine not exceeding- L.T 25. (0241). The principal provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act and connected Acts are printed as Appendix VI. .‘Offence's may conveniently be classified as follows: — 1. Counterfeit trade marks. I;: 2.i : Trade descriptions conveying- a false indication of the country of , y j • -origin. 3. Trade descriptions false in other respects. L; ■ lengths not properly stamped on piece-goods. - i a .! hu- Cl:;I.w 1. CoiXTKRFEJT ILRADK MaKJvs. TheIprovisions are intended to protect botli the public and the mapufae- turerf fhe. fkuiper against inferior imitations and the latter against unfair competition. Ordinarily action is only taken at the request of the aggrieved party. The registration of marks by the Customs Officers is not permitted thotigdi bbha fide applications for a watch to be kept for infringements are usually acceded to for a period of three months in cases in whidh definite information is hot obtainable. Should a Customs Officer in the course of his work notice an infringement he'would send intimation to the Agent (if known) of the person whose mark is infringed' but would not detain the goods for more than four days in the absence Of action being taken by that agent within four days to indemnify the Collector qf Customs against the result of detaining the goods : legal action must be instituted within a month. 2. False Indications of Origin. Offences under this category are usually those in which the article bears ^ Acription in a language which^ is uof the language of the country of manufacture and deos not hear any counter indication thus : —C LA knife hearing the inscription “ best cast steel ’’- if made in Japan would have to bear an indication that it was made in -Japan. Spirits made in Holland or Germany and described as “ Scotch Whisky ” or “ Jamaica Rum ” would »aye fi&gt; he accompanied by an indication of origin. Llie use of the English language on foreign^ made goods is admissildems ]tarts of the goods themselves, as for instance—English verses or texts on XTnas cards^ such words as “Photographs” or “ stamps ” on albums, “ Blood- iea &lt;I i .° r ‘ freezing ” on thermometers which are allowed, but such a remark as 'ff mve the giver ' onui niu^ niade in Italy would not be all(rtml witliout a counter indication of origin. * - . - - :L'L ■- . •• ^ .... . r , . . . : } 3.

MARKETS. The principal market towns are Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, ‘Amarah and Nasiriyah. From an overseas trade point of view the two towns of note are Baghdad and Basrah whence all other distributing centres derive their supplies with the exception of Mosul which has some direct trade with Syria. The following table gives the distances from Basrah and Baghdad to various market centres : — Basrah to Zobeir for Arabian towns (road) 9 miles Mahommerah river 20 it Nasiriyah train 140 11 river 132 11 Samarra river 209 11 Samawah train 200 11 Amarah river 143 11 Kut river 285 11 Baghdad/ river 499 11 train 354 11 Baghdad to Kut, train 104 11 Mosul, 300 11 Tirauq /tor Persia) train 12 7 miles. VALUE OF TRADE. The following* table indicates the total value of imports and exports to and from Basrah for the years 1910, 1911, 1912, 1917, 1918 and 1919: Imports (00,000 omitted) - Exports (00,000 omitted) 1910 ...

It is estimated that from one-half to three-fourths of the imports by sea eventually find their way to Persia and it cannot t^^ much that the trade of Mesopotamia is closely allied with that of Persia or that portion which can be reached with ease vta Baghdad. The marked increase in imports during the last two years has been due: (1) Very largely to the almost complete cessation of imports into Persia via the Caucasus, (2) the largely increased spending power of Mesopotamia owing to the presence of troops, . the depletion of stocks in Mesopotamia and Persia due to inability to obtain freight and supplies—m fact due to war conditions. t ion T a°ndTSafe\“ S “a. po^ibleTndTo^manufacturers to pay “V*' ‘ 0 PerSlaD requirements as to those of the population of Mesopotamia.wmwibm 15 METALS. Metals imported consist principally of iron, copper, yellow metal sheets and tin. Iron is required principally for small constructional purposes ; more especially bars for windows, rolled iron beams are coming into use m the larger towns but as a general rule the size of rooms is confined to the span of tbe°cbandals (poles about 14 feet long and an average diameter of 3 to 3£ inches). All Arab houses are fitted with barred windows necessitating a supply of bar iron or of some substitute. Copper and yellow metal are used for domestic utensils and the tin for tinning them; there wpuld appear to be a considerable market for aluminium vessels, more especially those which can be packed inside each other with a view to diminution of freight charges, both sea and land. Figures for value (in lacs of rupees) of imports are: — 1910 1911 1912 1915 Lacs of Rupees. ... 14 1916 ... 17 mr ... 11 1918 0 1919 Lacs of Rupees. 1 2 6 ... 19 It is certain that the country is short of supplies and can absorb a con siderable quantity (when it can obtain delivery) m spite of the fact that large quantities of iron have been purchased from the military authorities m the form of scrap. TIMBER. Mesopotamia being a country in which there is little or no timber other than date palms, there is a considerable market for planks and beams, a market which will increase with the development of the country and the desire of the population to live in better and larger houses, bova'nment requirements for building purposes and railways will be large, the annual value of date boxes imported is about 18 lacs of rupees. Excluding these boxes the value has been : 1910 1911 1912 1915 Lacs of Rupees. 3 1916 5 1917 ... 11 1918 5 1919 Lacs of Rupees. ... 27 ... 29 ... 26 6 The years 1916-1918 were abnormally high owing to importations by merchants with a view to selling to the Army. The figures for 1919 are low as timber has been purchased in various forms from the military authorities. TEA. The importations of tea during the years indicated were, m rupees: — h of 1910 1911 1912 1915 Lacs of Rupees. 3 1916 4 1917 4 1918 7 1919 Lacs of Rupees. 11 10 66 60 The main outlet for this tea is Persia which is a tea drinking country whereas, writing generally, Mesopotamia is a coffee drinking country. Tt would be safe to say that more than 50 per cent, of the tea imported is re-exported to Persia. . 1 , ,,, , The Baghdad figures for exports to Persia during 1919 show that tea i Pc 39 00 000 was exported whilst the Persian figures for imports at Ermfnlah for’tl« Perlian^ar 1918-1919 amount to about Rs. 50,00.000. The tea imported is almost invariably packed in chests containing from 80 lb to 160 lb., and is principally Indian of the better qualities. The new Persian Customs tariff in addition to prescribing a lower rate of duty on tea no longer contains the differentiation against packet tea (r.e., tea, in small tin boxes or lead packets) winch used to be assessed on its gross weight and consequently a trade in packet tea may be expected to develop. The inadequacy of the packing of tea for this market has frequently been noticed. \ a \r&gt;' Iti SUGAR. The value of imports of this commodity (in lacs of rupees) have been Lacs of Rupees. Lacs of Rupees. 1910 ... 6T 1916 40 1911 ... 80 1917 57 1912 ... 44 1918 141 1915 ... 12 1919 218 The exports to Persia in 1919 were valued at about ^0 lacs. The bulk of the supplies used to be obtained from France, Germany and Belgium, but in recent years supplies have been mainly Egyptian and China loaf sugar and China, Java, and Japanese crystals. During 1920 a large consignment of Belgian loaf sugar has arrived. Loaf sugar in cones weighing 1| kilos is the most popular form (it is infinitely more popular in Persia). Of crystal sugar that imported as large white crystals is regarded with much greater favour than the smaller crystals or those which are not absolutely white. Loaf sugar is now imported in bags, the cases which were becoming rare in 1913 have ceased to exist—probably due to ease in handling bags on pack transport and also doubtless to some small extent due to the greater difficulty of getting case wood. Attempts have been made to render the familiar cubes of sugar popular but apparently without success. MACHINERY. Types of agricultural machinery required have been mentioned under the heading ' c Agriculture ”. It should be observed that agricultural machinery is exempt from import duty and it is recorded that with a view to encouraging the installation of pumping plants land owners are protected against increaseu taxation on account of land revenue in respect of three crops improved by the agency of a new pump. Electric lighting sets are likely to be popular in many towns. Apart from the Power Stations at Baghdad and Basrah, the Diwaniyah Municipality owns a plant. Qurnah owns 25 per cent, of the plant supplying that town. Kirkuk is concluding negotiations with a view to purchasing an installation. Schemes for water-supplies are under consideration. Baghdad is con sidering a scheme costing about £60,000 (£10,000 annual maintenance), asrali, Gurnah, Najaf and Arbil are all considering projects for water-supply. Engineering-shops apart from those of the Railway and Civil and Militarv Governments are being erected with a view to maintenance of mechanical transport, agricultural : and other machinery. There will be a demand for lathes, drills and machine tools and to a very limited extent for more massive machines tor heavy repairs to pumping engines and presses. . With a shortage of labour it is certain that developments in the mech anieal line may be looked to as assured. *1 DATES. qwTol K i T i p Pal dat 1 e .£I owin ? areas are around Basrah on both sides of the Shatt-al-Arab from a little north of Basrah to the mouth of the river at Fao the belt, of date palms vanes m depth from, a few score yards to two or three Karbala^ m ^ around Ba g h dad, Mandali (on the Persian frontier) and The exportable surplus of dates is derived almost entirelv from Basrah area and from the lower reaches of the river on the Persian side ^ in basils ^S$Xri6 e 0li n b TW n ^ral“±ni Sb0U t t 68 'S an ^ tbr 868 ’ and 0cca8I0nalI y for lhe In dian martet they are packed in skSeand marS “ ptAl!AT about 50,000 tons in cases afd 30,000 ton“ n baskete! etc 7 estlmated at In 1919 the percentage shares of various countries of destination were:— (1) India (2) ti. k. ... ;;; (3) Arabia (4) America and other countries Cases.

What seems a large potential market appears to have been left unexploited viz., the Ear East. The cases are imported about April or May from Sweden through the London houses of the principal European exporting firms and are nailed together in and around Basrah from August onwards. The baskets are made locally. The exporters make cash advances to packers and growers and also to those who collect labour which is largely recruited from the Euphrates marsh areas. These advances are issued against compialas which usually bear a very high rate of interest a fact which is said to provide very largely against possible losses on the actual exports. The bulk of the exports to Europe are effected and financed by the three principal European firms, though local firms are taking an increasing share m direct exports; when the local firms do not ship themselves they ship on con signment through the exporters or enter into a partnership with them. Exports to America are in the hands of an American firm. Before the beginning of each season it is customary to have a meeting of growers, packers and exporters, at which the starting prices of the 3 principal exported qualities (Hallawis, Kadrawis and Sayers) are fixed, these though nominally for a considerable portion of the season are usually subject to sub sequent fluctuations due to considerations of supply and demand. WOOL. Wool dealers and exporters of Baghdad and Basrah recognize three distinct varieties of Mesopotamian wool. These are Arabi , Awassi and ££ Karradi ”. - Arabi. Arabi is the name given to wool from the sheep owned by the Arabs of the nlains of ‘Iraq. It is superior to Awarfsi and Karradi and compares very favourably with the best wools of India, China, and the north coast of Africa, including Egypt. As regards colour, it ranges from so-called black to white, the various colours occurring in the following proportions:-48 per cent, browns 28 per cent, fawns and greys, 15 per cent. M^ksa^d 9 p er cent, whites 5 The best qualities—strength, fineness, softness and flexibility, wav ' ness or cur Less, feTgth and uniformity of staple, lustre etc., are found the teowns and blacks. The whites are poorest m quality and approximate to the Awassi wools. Awassi. Awassi wool comes from a breed of sheep chiefly owned by the Arabs whose habitat is in the reo-ion between Mosul and Alleppo. This breed of sheep is safd to be 1 cross between the Arabi and Kurdish, or Karradi. The woo pro duced is while in colour, is long stapled, coarser and less wavy than Arabi, but superior in all respects to Karradi.

(i) The leading factors governing production are: — The extent of ,umm f ^ing o^water^ possibly, to a lesser extent the numbers of^.P^ ^ rov ; de extra summer summer irrigation will natuially, ioi \grazing grounds. Extension of summer irrigation, however, pre-supposes extension of agriculture which tends to decrease grazing grounds for sheep. As, however, intensive agriculture is not, and will not for a long time be, practised in Mesopotamia, it may be assumed that increase in production of wool for the next ten or fifteen years or more, is a certainty. (ii) In comparing the characteristics of Arabi, Awassi and Karradi wools, it appears that the two latter named are white wools of inferior quality. The possibility of producing good white wools to the North of Mosul is soiyewhat greater than in ‘Iraq on account of a more favourable climate. In these regions, however, the possibility of increased production is doubtful. Sug gestions have come from some quarters for the improvement of local breeds by the introduction of Merino blood from Australia. Before such an experiment is tried, it seems much more reasonable to attempt the improvement by selection of the indigenous breeds. It is very unlikely that a better type of wool producing sheep than Arabi can be found in any part of the world where the climatic conditions are such as prevail in ‘Iraq. s™™ improbable that it will be possible, generally, to produce a white wool without losing more important qualities such as fineness, tensile strength wavmess and lustre. It must be remembered that with the absence of pro- tective colouring the stamina of the breed is likely to suffer. ,1 : ‘V are severa l wo °l presses which pack the wool in bales weio-hing- rnree cwt. ■ e The number of bales exported in recent years have been : — 19.10 1911 1912 1916 1917 1918 1919 •36,228 •35,207 43,290 16,343 13,063 27,500 15,150 the reduction in exports during and since the w mutton 0 ^ th6 reductlon 111 the flocks caused by the ar is probably temporary ‘ military demands for BARLEY. «hipMtoThe h SKl&amp;iXn^ri° l h 0,0 °f of which was as “ Persian ” barley .

The tree produces edible fruits from which oil is extracted in Mosul and Baghdad. This »um is known as ££ Elch ” and is principally sent by caravan to Alleppo where it is used for sizeing cloth. The gum trade like most others is dependent on cheap means of transport. TOBACCO. The quantity of tobacco grown annually in Mesopotamia amounts to some 1,000—1,200 tons, and is capable of expansion. Tobacco is grown in the Sulaimaniyah and Arbil divisions in the north east and to a lesser extent in the Hillah and Mosul divisions. The quality is somewhat inferior, a fact which may be due to some extent to the degree of protection afforded by the Turkish Regime system. The local tobacco is largely used for making these indigenous cigarettes. It is only exported to a very limited extent. The Divisional Officer, Sulaimaniyah, has taken up with great energy the •task of increasing the area under tobacco cultivation this year. Government loans have been given as in the case of cultivation of other produce, but the greatest impetus has been given to the industry by the introduction of a system of control of the contracts between merchants and growers. Formerly the growers, entangled in contracts so arranged as to conceal the ruinous rates of interest payable and to necessitate the carrying over of advances year after year, had no encouragement to extend the cultivation or to improve the quality of their tobacco. Indeed the ordinary form of contract, which provided for the transfer of the whole of a crop to a merchant at a price fixed long before hand, was a direct inducement to the cultivation of common tobacco by careless methods. It is hoped that the terms on which advances are now made, viz., the sale of the borrower’s crop to the lender at the rate current at harvest time will not only prevent the enslavement of the grower but will encourage him to plant the best tobacco and to adopt improved methods of cultivation. At the request of the Civil Administration, an expert was sent to Meso potamia. He toured in all the tobacco growing districts and studied the growing and marketing of local tobacco in all its aspects; he stated as his considered opinion that unless radical improvements were made in the methods of growdng, curing and baling at present in use, Mesopotamian tobacco would never be bought for export. MOTOR TRANSPORT. In addition to the large number of motor vehicles purchased locally and to the vehicles imported by or on behalf of Government, there have been 330 cars imported by firms anil private individuals during tlm last two years. With few exceptions these have been American. It is considered that there is a large market for more cars, vans and light lorries and accessories. • Motor cycles are readily saleable and have been purchased by the inhabit ants of Baghdad and Basrah. Several firms have erected workshops and are endeavouring to arrange an adequate service of spares—a most important point. The type of vehicle required is one with plenty of ground clearance and of moderate weight. It is unfortunate that owing to inability to give delivery the commercial possibilities of European cars have not seriously been tested; with rates of exchange favourable it wmuld have been easier to give the higher class cars a * trial than it will be when exchange is less favourable. L MINERAL RESOURCES. Oil in considerable quantities exists and it is probable that the operations of the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy. in the Naft Khana area will result in an abundant supplv of cheap fuel in Baghdad which is the most essential fac or in the development of the country. An adequate supply largely depends on a reduction in River, railway and mechanical transport charges, whilst m many places cheap oil is the most promising agency for burning bricks and it will be invaluable for effecting agricultural and industrial development by driving Dumping machinery and for use as fuel in cement manufacture, electric lighting schemes, etc., probably also for such domestic purposes as cooking and house warming. j &lt;. i • Sulphur in the form of sulphuretted hydrogen is discharged freely m places; it lias been known in the same place for a large portion of a century and it is therefore probable that the source of supply is a large one it might be affected by changed conditions or by borings for oil at comparatively lav distances, and it is therefore difficult to speculate on its commercial value. /“Nn — ■ • • - 11 20 Coal exists and was utilised by the Turks; it is of a poor quality and until the present time has only been worth working at the outcrop, the dip is steep and consequently the pit soon ceases to be profitable to work. The following is an extract of a report hy Mr. E. H. Pascoe of the Government of India, Survey Department. PETROLEUM. In the area under consideration, and probably throughout Mesopotamia, the mineral of unique and outstanding importance is petroleum It is perhaps unnecessary to point out that its occurrence, on account of the extreme mobility of the mineral, is a subject of considerable complexity and of many limita tions. Bearing in mind, therefore, the uncertainty of prognostication on such a subject my opinion, based on evidence collected over a fairly extended tour, is that the country will probably take a not unimportant place among the world’s sources of petroleum. It should rival the Persian fields, and collect ively outclass those of Burma. ***** * Pitch and Bitumen. —The only locality seen in which pitch and bitumen occur in any appreciable quantity is Qaiyarah (Rep. No. 4). The quantity is not large. This and the Hit deposits do not make a good fuel, and moreover would probably be of considerably greater value for other purposes such as : — (i) Caulking and ship-building 6n the Arab plan. (ii) Use on roads. (Hi) Low grade varnishes for iron-work, and japanning. (iv) Use on the iron-plates of ship-bottoms to prevent electrolytic action. (v) Coating masonry. (vi) Acid-proof linings for chemical tanks. (vii) Roofing. (viii) Insulating electric wires. (ix) Substitute for rubber in garden hose. (x) Binding for coal briquettes. Sulphur. —-Attention has been drawn in my reports to the supplies of sulphuretted hydrogen which are available in this country. Most of the occurrences are, of course, of no economic importance, but two have been named as probably remunerative, viz. (i) The junction of the Greater Zab with the Tigris (Report No. 7) and (ii) N. of Kirkuk (Report No. 9). In addition to these supplies, this gas will, in all probability, be given off in large quantities, from the oil of shallow oil horizons, when these are tapped by boring. Any simple device to collect it from the well-heads and oxidize it to free sulphur, either by incomplete combustion—H tS + 0= HO + S-or by mixture with sulphur dioxide 2H 2 S + SOo = 2H„0 + 3S-would prevent the waste of a valuable product. The device would have to be more or less portable and must not threaten the oil-fields with fire or explosion. Gypsum. The quantity of gypsum in the country is, from a practical point of view, unlimited. It is used by the Arabs for making “ jus ” an interior plaster for their houses, and as an ornamental building-stone. The only place during my tour, in which I have seen it used extensively for the latter purpose is Mosul. I wonder it is not more employed in this wav by villagers. It is better than mud, even as a flooring for which it is somewhat spit—-and. would be much cleaner. It makes serviceable and not unattractive window-plinths. Gypsum is, of course, the source of Plaster of Paris, for which unfortunateiy there is a very limited market. No other extensive use* lor it has been found so far as I know. Sulphuric Acid can be manufactured rom i y ne simple application of heat, but the temperature requisite is comparatively high This method of Sulphuric Acid manufacture was, I ly i 6 In 11 R c T me -, rC1 . al S , Cale in Germ any, but was apparentlv i able to compete with supplies derived from Iron Pyrites.

The latter is not very thick—- a feet or two at the most—but its upper and lower boundaries are parallel plane surfaces, which would simplify quarrying. Road Metal .—Attention has been drawn in (Eeports Nos. 1 and 5) to the eminent suitability of the larger pebbles of the conglomerates and gravels, when broken up, for road metal. AGRICULTURE. Agriculture for a variety of reasons remains in many of its phases in ’Iraq in a simple state. The Arab Farmer has the ability for better things as witness his excellent cultivation of early summer vegetables near towns. All Agricultural Implements used at present are hand-made. They consist of a wooden plough with iron point, a spade, a hoe and a sickle. Cheaper and more efficient implements could be made by machinery. Sample machine-made spades have already found favour. There are openings not only for the simplest but also for the most complicated Agricultural machines. Before the War a Mosul farmer imported reapers and a local company has now been formed in Mosul which contemplates the introduction of the latest power machinery. The Agricultural Directorate offers facilities for trials of new machinery on its Central Station at Baghdad. Machines which pass the trials can be demonstrated on the five District Stations. Purchasers and vendors are awaiting the result of the trials with great interest. Until recently the only complicated Agricultural machines have been pumping sets. The great popularity of the types introduced was due to the provision of skilled personnel to erect and maintain the pumping sets coupled with a plentiful supply of spare parts. These are the crucial conditions for opening new business. Locally trained mechanics have proved efficient m the past and are quick to learn. Agricultural labourers trained in the use of western machinery are available now. Openings exist for Dairying appliances, Grass and Wool presses. Flour mills and Oil mills as also for artificial manures. There was and is a demand for reliable vegetable seeds. Improved varieties of fruit trees com man attention. Enquiries have been received for imported stallions. Ayrshire bulls ha\e done well. The size and general stamp of the progeny is most encouraging. Barley and Dates form the bulk of the export trade in Agricultural produce. They have been dealt with elsewhere in this report. I he aiea under cultivation is capable of enormous extension. Cotton of high qua.! has been successfully grown on Experimental Farms and there is eveiv expectation that a considerable area will shortly be placed under cultivation. COTTON. Mr. Philby’s preliminary note on cultivation of cotton is printed as- Appendix VII. Since it was written Messrs. Crapper and Hodgkinson on behalf of the British Cotton Growing Association have visited Mesopotamia and haA^e expressed an opinion which is extremely favourable as regards the prospects for the development of cotton cultivation. They are satisfied that Meso potamia possesses both a soil and a climate to grow excellent cotton m large weights per acre, and that we may hope for a large production during the next few years The limiting factors at the moment are : (1) Comparatively small population—3,000,000 people; (2) irrigation and drainage requirements; (3) cheaper and more direct transport facilities required; (4) instruction and scientific methods and machinery to be employed. The Government experi mental farms have shown surprising and delightful results. IRRIGATION. The functions of the Irrigation Department are twofold— (1) Irrigation. (2) River conservancy and flood protection. Paradoxical as it may seem at present the second is more important than i the first The reason is that any Arab will co-operate with the Department ta bring water to his land, but there is not nearly the same eagerness to do hard work on flood banks, the direct benefit of which to the worker may not be annarent to him However the bulk of the heavy work on flood protection has been done, and the task of the future will be chiefly one of maintenance. The Department of Irrigation was formed as a Military Department in February, 1918, and so continued until March 1919, lyhen it came under the control of the Civil Commissioner, exercised through the Revenue Secretary. In the period while it was a Military Department its expenditure amounted to88 lacs of rupees, but ibis does uot iuclude the cost pf a great deal of labour and material. The sanctioned budget for the year 1919-20 was Rs. 52 lakhs. The allotment for 1919-20 was exceeded by IT lacs chiefly on account of labour charges not admitted into previous reckonings. Apart from silt clearance and the extension of existing canals, mainly in the region watered by the Hindiyah Barrage system, ihe following are the chief works to the credit of the Department: — Flood protection and river conservancy — Earthwork on Tigris ... ... ... 815,000 M 3 ,, ,, Euphrates ... ... ... 2,892,000 M 3 Tigris Irrigation River Diyalah Euphrates Special Works. ♦ Tanniyah Escape Machariyah \ Majar Kabir &gt; Regulator Chahalah / New Major Works Canal New Khalis Saqlawiyah Yusufiyah B.

The programme for 1920-21 includes river training works near the 11 mdiyah Barrage, a regulator for the Butairah (above Amarah), a new canal opposite Raraadi; considerable extensions of existing Canals in the Hillah and Diwamyah Divisions improvements to B. Hasan and Georgiyah and the Naiyah Canal m the Nasmyah Division. The policy is a conservative one-only to undertake small and imme diately remunerative schemes and to keep down expenditure until the Contour oXnL7ontLr 08 lT? s h n o d w e a0CU Ti *w 0f Mrographioal data warrant ennanced outlay.

A P a Ster of f-t ^ Un agam . st the St matter ot tact, the possession of TariUHauB 2 a title-deeds for landed property other than urban property was rather the rule than the exception in Turkish times. Numerous reasons which will appear later account for this. The right of Sirf mulk corresponds with the English freehold. It denotes the fullest measure of ownership which a private person can have over a portion of the earth’s surface. With some considerable exceptions, chiefly near Basrah, this class of ownership only extends to building sites in towns and gardens in suburban regions. There is very little agricultural mulk land. Until very shortly before the British occupation trees grown and houses built on Tapu land became mulk property and were recognised as such. The incon venience of this will be realised, when it is understood that ownership of the second class (Haqq Tapu) descends by a different law of inheritance from the ShaUah Law, which applies to mulk property. A more unsuitable rule of inheritance for immoveable property than the Shar‘ah Law with its multi tudinous functions'cannot be imagined. The rule of descent according to the Shar‘ah Law is one reason why the Turkish Land registration system failed to wmrk. Haqq Tapu, or tasarruf, is a right of occupancy not ownership. Owner ship remains with the State. The Sahib Tapu can do pretty well what he likes with th.6 land, but on failnr© of hoirs within a certain degiee 01 ^ failure to cultivate for three successive years without valid excuse his right lapses, though he may be permitted to re-purchase in preference to a stranger. This salutary provision of escheat, devised to protect the interests of the fisc was seldom and capriciously applied by the Turks. ‘Iraq is full of people who can produce Tapu Sanads—often mutually contradictory—for enormous areas of land which they have never cultivated, and perhaps not even visited lor years. There is also a curious right in land known as ‘Uqr. The ‘Uqr holder represents the pre-Turkish owner. He has no\v no interest m the land beyond the right to take a fraction, usually one-twentieth, of the produce. He has no right of management whatever. A good account of l qr will be found m the Revenue Administration Report for the period ending December, 1J17. When all is said and done the bulk of the land in ‘Iraq remains the property of the State either as (1) Sanmyah or Mudawwarah (i.e., Lrown property), or (2) simply as unappropriated State land. In land of these classes no private rignts at all exist, m theory, but as a matter of tac Turks allowed the same tribal tenants to occupy the same lands indefinitely and these tenants do, as a matter of fact, sell, buy bequeath or mortgage such lands, or build or plant upon them, .]ust as if they had a legal title. We shall in course of time and subject to certain safeguards recognise these prescriptive rights, but even when this has been done, there remain enormous areas to which no one has any claim. Given a reasonable land revenue policy, such as we are introducing, the prospective agricultuial de\e- lopment of the country is only limited by the factor of population. Under Turkish Law, still unaltered, the holding of land by a Corporation is generally forbidden. But shortly before the war an exception was made in favour of certain Corporate Associations of Ottoman subjects, especiallv agricultural Societies and Charitable Associations. Foreigners can hold land on the same terms as Ottoman subjects. In other words m all that relates to Teal estate they are amenable to local Tribunals and do not enjoy the bench of the Capitulations.t APPENDIX I. NOTIFICATION. WHEKEAS it is expedient to make better provision for tbe collection and management of Land-Customs on certain Frontier ; of the Occupied Territories of ‘Iraq : — NOW, therefore, I, William Kaine Marshall, Knight Commander of the Bath, Knight Commander of the Star of India, by virtue of the authority- vested in me as General Officer Commanding His Britannic Majesty’s Forces in Mesopotamia, do hereby direct as follows: — 1. For the levy of duties of Customs on goods exported or imported by- land, Customs stations may be established at such places as may be determined by the Civil Commissioner, Baghdad. 2. The Civil Commissioner may appoint such persons as he may deem fit for carrying out the purposes of this Regulation. 3. The Civil Commissioner may prescribe, by public notice, by what roads, routes and passes goods may be exported from or imported into the Occupied Territories of ‘Iraq or any part of such territories. All goods in course of export or import by land must be brought to a Customs station by a prescribed route without deviation. In the event of any contravention of the provisions of this section or of the notice issued as aforesaid, the goods may be seized; and they shall be liable to be confiscated, unless the person in charge of such goods is able to satisfy the adjudicating Officer that such contravention was due to ignorance or accident. 4. Goods passed, or attempted to be passed, without a special permission from a Customs Authority, across any frontier guarded by stations, between sunset and sunrise, shall be seized and confiscated. 5. When goods are brought to be passed at any station established for the levy of duties and passing of goods, a written application, according to a form prescribed by the Collector of Customs, shall be made by the owner or person m charge for permission to pass such goods; and such application shall contain a true description of the goods, with the marks, numbers and descrip tion of the packages containing the same, and a declaration of their value. If any goods shall be passed or attempted to be passed without such an application in writing as is above described, they shall be liable to be seized and confiscated. . . hi ought to be passed at any such station shall be liable to confis cation if the packages in which the same may be contained shall on examina tion be found not to correspond with the description of them given in the application, of if the contents thereof be found not to have been correctly described m regard to sort, quality or quantity, or if, in or among the packages, any goods not stated in the application be found concealed or mixed up with the specified goods. 7. The Civil Commissioner from time to time, may notify a fixed value or any article or number of articles liable to duty under this Regulation upon their value; and the value so fixed for such articles shall, till altered by a similar notice, be taken to be the value of such articles for the purpose of levying duty on the same under this Regulation. * ^ ^ 8. When goods liable to duty, for which a value has not been fixed bv such a notice as is above directed, or for which a fixed duty has not been eclaied, are brought to any such station as aforesaid, the duty leviable on such goods shall be levied according to the market value of such goods.

Whoever intentionally obstructs any Officer in the exercise of any powers given by this Regulation to such Officer, or whoever offers a bribe to any Officer appointed under this Regulation in order to induce such Officer to act in a manner inconsistent with his duty, shall be liable, on conviction before a Magistrate, to a fine not exceeding one thousand rupees, or to imprisonment for any term not exceeding six months, or both. 14. Powers of confiscation may be exercised - (а) by Political Officers and Collectors of Customs without limit; (б) by Assistant Political Officers up to the limit which they are empowered in a Magisterial capacity to impose with regard to fines; (c) by Deputy Collector of Customs and Assistant Collector of Customs up to the limit of value of rupees two hundred and fifty. Provided that the Civil Commissioner may in case of any Officer increase the powers of confiscation hereby granted to him, and may grant to any Officers power of confiscation either without limit or subject to limit. 15. Wherever confiscation is authorised by this Regulation, the Officer adjudging it shall give the owner of the goods an option to pay, in lieu of confiscation, such fine as tHe Officer thinks fit. 16. The confiscation of any goods under this Regulation includes any package in which they are found and all other contents thereof. Every vessel, cart or other means of conveyance and every horse or other animal used in the removal of any goods liable to confiscation under this Regulation shall, in like manner, be liable to confiscation.

REGULATIONS GOVERNING THE ADMISSION INTO MESO POTAMIA OF SAMPLES AND PATTERNS BROUGHT BY COMMERCIAL TRAVELLERS. * Importation. 1 Qn the production by a commercial traveller of a list or declaration containing a full description of every sample brought by him, officially attested by the Customs authorities in the country of origin, examination of the samples may be limited to ascertaining that they are fully enumerated on the list produced. 2. The list referred to in the preceding paragraph is to be utilized in assessing the duty chargeable on the samples. A deposit of the duty_ is required before delivery of the samples, or alternatively a bond (with sufficient security) for the amount thereof may be accepted instead of a cash deposit. 3. If the commercial traveller is unprovided with the list referred to in paragraph 1, he may be required to produce to the Collector of Customs a certificate or letter of identity from his principals or otherwise satisfy the Collector of his eligibility for the concession. If the Collector is satisfied on this point, a list will be compiled by the commercial traveller, giving a full description of every sample sufficient for identification and assessment of the duty chargeable thereon. The duty will be deposited or security given as set out in the preceding paragraph. 4. Should the samples bear the marks, stamps or seals of the country of exportation no additional marks or seals for purposes of identification need, as a rule, be affixed by officers of the Customs Department. Contrariwise, if the samples on importation bear no seals they are to be marked or sealed for future identification, should such a course be deemed necessary, by the Customs officers at the port of arrival. 5 The list of the samples, whether that produced by the commercial traveller or that compiled at the port of arrival, will be signed and dated byi ,iS !: . * 26 the officer at the port or place of importation, who will affix to the list a state ment bearing' the official seal or stamp, and .showing: (a) the name of the port at which the samples are imported, and the amount of duty chargeable on the patterns or sampdes; also whether it was deposited in money or whether security was given: (b) the marks, if any, that have been applied to the patterns samples; (c) the date upon which the amount of duty deposited will be carried to the public account or the amount recovered under the security given, unless it is proved that the patterns or samples have been previously re-exported or placed in bond. This date is to be not later than twelve months from that upon which the samples were brought into the country. No charge is to be made for the document issued or certified by Customs officers or for marking for identification. 6. The production of the list referred to in paragraph 1 will not be required in the case of patterns or samples not liable to duty, and the exami nation of packages containing such patterns or samples will be restricted to ascertaining that no dutiable articles are contained therein, and that the goods produced are bona fide samples. All samples of no commercial value are entitled to free entry. Exportation. 7. Patterns and samples of dutiable articles mav be produced to the Customs officers at any port or frontier station in Mesopotamia for examination prior to exportation. 0 (Non-dutiable samples are not required to be produced on export.) 8. lo obtain the return of the deposit made on entry of the patterns or samples, or the cancellation of the bond entered Into, the commercial traveller is required to produce with his samples the list thereof, signed by the officers at the port of arrival: provided that the time allowed tor production (see paragraph 5c) has not been exceeded,'and the Customs officers are satisfied that the goods as produced are identical with those enumerated on the list, the amount of duty originally deposited will be refunded. The list is to be noted as to the exportation of the samples, the statement referred to in para graph 5 being retained. ^ 9 - rj . 1Jie statement is to be transmitted, with a certificate of exportation of the samples, to the Collector at the port of importation with the obiect of Juicing an adjustment of accounts effected, where a deposit has been made or the bond cancelled, as the case may be. 1 d e ’ or APPENDIX III.

Section 11. A collective partnership is a partnership concluded by two or more persons for commercial purposes and given a trade name. Section 12. Such trade name must include at least the name of one or two partners. Section 14. Commandite partnerships are partnerships concluded by one or more persons jointly and severally responsible with one or more persons who subscribe a part of the capital and are called “ Commanditaire or sleeping partners ”. The trade name of such partnership must include the name of one or more of the responsible partners. Section 32. An abstract of the partnership agreement of both Collective and Commandite partnerships must be registered with the Chamber of Com merce, to contain the following particulars, and published. (1) The name, description, condition and address of the partners other than sleeping partners. (2) The trade name of the partnership. (3) The names of the partners authorised to manage the affairs and sign on behalf of the partnership. (4) The amount of paid-up capital and the amount remaining in shares or in the name of sleeping partners. (5) The dates of beginning and termination of the partnership. The name of sleeping partners may not be registered. Section 36. Apart from the three classes of partnerships (Collective, Com mandite and anonymous) abovementioned, the law recognizes temporary transactionary partnerships. Section 37. Such partnerships are usually formed for the purpose of carrying out one or more commercial transactions and the nature of their busi ness and the capital of each partner depends on the contract made between the partners. Section 38. Such partnerships may be proved by their books and corres pondence. Section 39. Such partnerships are exempted from the legal formalities and obligations to which other partnerships are subject. P APPENDIX VI. MERCHANDISE MARKS 'LAW. Part I.—Principal Provisions of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889, and Connected Acts Relating to Merchandise Marks. Sea Customs Act, 1878, Section 18.—No goods specified in the following Indian Merchandise Marks clauses shall be brought, whether by laud or sea. Let, i889, Section 10. ... ‘inhibitions on importation, into British India : within within the the (dj) Goods having applied thereto a counterfeit trade mark meaning of the Indian Penal Code, or a false trade description meaning of the Indian Merchandise Marks Act, 1889. (e) Goods made or produced beyond the limits of the United Kingdom and British India, and having applied thereto any name or trade mark being, or Durporting to be, the name or trade mark of any person who is a manufacturer, dealer or trader in the United Kingdom or m British India, unless— (i) the name or trade mark is, as to every application thereof, accom panied by a definite indication of the goods having been made or produced in a place beyond the limits of 'the United Kingdom and British India, and . . .... n , • j- a.- • j,- (ii) the country in which that place is situated is m that indication indi cated in'letters as large and conspicuous as any letter m the name or trade mark, and in the same language and character as the name or trade mark. (/) Piece-goods, such as are ordinarily sold by length or by the piece, which— (i) have not conspicuously stamped in English numerals on each piece the length thereof in standard yards, or m standard yards and a fraction of such yard, according to the real length of the piece, and (ii) have been manufactured beyond the limits of India or, \for the development of the cotton growing* potentialities of the country. More over cotton has actually been grown in various parts of the country ; for instance, Egyptian varieties have been grown at Basrah and ‘Amarah; Egyptian seed was found in store at QaEat Salih on our occupation of that town; the Turks imported a quantity of similar seed to Baghdad with unknown results; and finally an indigenous variety akin to a plant indigenous in India is grown on the Biyalah river. That cotton has already been and is being grown spontaneously by the agriculturists in Mesopotamia is not altogether a favourable factor in the situation; it is true that we shall start without the handicap of local prejudice against trying an unknown crop, but other and more serious handicaps will have to be overcome. It may be assumed that everything that has been done in the direction of cotton growing by local initiative will have to be undone before the problem can be tackled seriously on scientific lines : pests will have to be eliminated and their recurrence obviated; varieties of no commercial value will have to be eradicated; inferior methods of cultivation will have to be suppressed. If Mesopotamia is to be in the future a great cotton growing country, varieties most suitable for cultivation under the conditions obtaining or likely to obtain must be selected at once by experiment or otherwise and introduced into or, if necessary, forced upon the country to the exclusion of all others and the most drastic action must be taken to safeguard them against contamination in any way whatsoever. 3. Experimental Work. Something has already been done in the direction indicated. In 1917 an officer (Captain K. Thomas) was deputed by the Government of India to act in the capacity of Cotton Expert to the administrative authorities in Mesopo tamia. ' In the following year the Cotton Expert was able to arrange for and carry through a series of interesting crop experiments, the results of which are now to hand. In the meantime, owing to an unauthorised application by a subordinate officer of the Agricultural Department of the Mesopotamia Expeditionary Force for the supply of Egyptian cotton seed for experimental cultivation, the problem of cotton cultivation in Mesopotamia had aroused the interest of the Egyptian authorities, who advanced the contention that, if Egyptian cotton were to be grown at all in Mesopotamia, it should be grown to the exclusion of all other varieties. It is unnecessary to follow in detail the controversy which arose out of this correspondence; suffice it to say that the Egyptian authorities eventually disclaimed the suggestion that they had advocated the cultivation of “ Egyptian cotton in mass without adequate previous trials of its suitability ” : that they had in advancing their original yiew, ignored the fac'f that it had not been decided to reserve Mesopotamia as a field for the exploitation of Egyptian cotton, but that seed had been applied for to enable the local authorities to arrive at a decision on this point; and, last but not least, that they failed to supply the seed asked for in time for the experimental sow ings of 1918, with the result that we must await the outcome of the 1919 crop experiments before deciding whether conditions in Mesopotamia are suitable for the growth of Egyptian cotton. The problem must still be regarded as being in the experimental stage, but the 1918 tests have established beyond* a doubt that, under favourable conditions of situation and irrigation, the climatic conditions are suitable to the cultivation of cotton of superior quality, while the acreage yields of all varieties tested in some twenty-six experiments compare very favourably indeed with those of other countries including Egypt itself. The most successful variety (tested only in one plot owing to shortage of seed) was a Punjab- American type, Webber 49, which yielded at the rate of no less than 2,420 lbs. of seed cotton per acre compared with an average Egyptian yield of 1,200 lbs. Yields of over 2,000 lbs. per acre resulted from two other Punjab-American types, Punjab 4F. and Punjab 285F. (each tested on four plots). All these three varieties produced cotton of pure type, whose lint outturn has, however, yet to be ascertained, while other varieties experimented with (including an Egyptian presumably from seed imported by the Turks) produced mixed lots with acreage yields higher than the Egyptian average though lower than the three varieties abovenamed. It is extremely unfortunate that no properly vouched Egyptian seed was available for experimental cultivation side by side with these three varieties and all that can be said at present is^— 1 2 (1) that the conditions are decidedly favourable for the cultivation of the three Punjab-American types named and tha.t Webber 49, in view of its very successful preliminary canter, is worthy of further careful attention; (2) that the prospects of Egyptian cotton are very promising though by no means assured in the absence of actual tests; and(8) that, cotton conditions being- generally good, it is quite possible that some other high grade type may prove on further experiment to be more suitable for acclimatisation in Mesopotamia than either Egyptian or Indo-American. In these circumstances it is clearly the duty of the local agricultural authorities to leave no stone unturned to discover the variety or varieties most suitable to the various parts of Mesopotamia before committing themselves to any final and binding decision on the subject. The climate and other condi- tions of Mosul, Baghdad, Basrah, Khaniqin and the Euphrates valley are dissimilar and different varieties may be found suitable for each tract. We need therefore be bound by no consideration other than the genuine desire to discover and introduce into eacli zone of the country that variety of liigli giade and commercially valuable cotton which proves on investigation to be most suited to it and if a pure Sea Islands type can be successfully acclimatised m Mesopotamia there can belittle question that it should be introduced m pre ference to other varieties; if on the other hand, Pun jab-American types or even some indigenous variety promises better results all round than Egyptian cotton there is no reason why the latter should be encouraged to the exclusion of other kinds. We may assume that the agricultural authorities in Mesopotamia are alive to their responsibilities and aware of the necessity of segregating all varieties of cotton introduced into the country for experimental purposes and of exter minating unsuccessful or unsatisfactory types. Subject to these considerations the wider the range of their experiments the better; the first years of our occupation of the country must be years of experiment and we are responsi hie to provide the people at the end of the experimental period with the most superior quality of cotton capable of being cultivated on a large commercial scale on their lands. 4. Preliminary Measures. Experience in other countries, where cotton cultivation has extended gradually and spontaneously from small beginning has taught us that the Absence of a clearly defined control in the early stages inevitably produces, lifficulties in the end. It is more difficult to place restrictions on an advanced industry when they become necessary in its own interest and m the interest if the people concerned and of the world m general than to develop an industry for the common advantage under definite restrictions well understood from the beginning. If then, Mesopotamia is to be developed as an important cotton growing country, nothing can be more fatal to its prospects m this direction than the encouragement of the promiscuous cultivation of cotton by its people. A rigid control must be exercised from the beginning and that control must be in the hands of Government. Action has already been taken on these lines in that the importation of cotton seed into the country is prohibited except under Government licence.. That is a step in the right direction, but a great deal more is required if even tual success is to be assured. The prohibition (except under Government licence, which would in Prac tice only be granted in cases approved under expert advice) should be extended (1) to the ginning and baling of cotton and the erection and use of machinery and factories intended for such purposes; (2) to the buymg and selhng of^ any commercial dealings in cotton m the local markets; and (3) to the export of cotton overseas or overland and to its transport by lan oi vva er mi m limits of Mesopotamia from one place to another. • These prohibitions, drastic as they are, are nevertheless f ully justified &gt;y the extreme importance of the subject at any rate during the initial stapes of scientific cottoncultivation in the country ; they would m practice be mitigated by the issue of licences to approved applicants on their with varieties of cotton approved by Government. Their general result 1 A fhpMimination of the cultivation of undesirable and objectionable would be the eBnmiat 1 . j sca]e and we 8 p 011 ld be free to deal piece- r;™ the land revenue payable on objectionable varieties of cotton. , ■ T Z in Ih—t'wnfcUr is important tha^the .oHc, 9* ' 01 ^'“ Situation, interference with which would (five rise to widespread and legitimate dlsprvntent.3d 5. Encouragement of Legitimate Cotton Growing. The war being at an end and the main avenues of commerce once more open, we may assume that the enterprising commercial element in Meso potamia is already alive to the cotton growing possibilities of their country and are concerting schemes with the agricultural portion of the community for the extension of the area under cotton. Under the scheme outlined in the preceding paragraph we propose to meet them with an injunction against proceeding further in this direction and the result will be widespread dissatis faction unless Government is prepared to take the initiative in fostering the cultivation of cotton. This is exactly what Government must do—without delay but on scientifically sound lines. The experiments of the current year taken in conjunction with those of 1918 will enable the experts to form an opinion regarding the varieties of cotton apparently most suitable for cultivation in Mesopotamia. The experi ments will of course continue over a series of years and there is no reason why they should even stop, but provisional decisions musl be arrived at at intervals and the cotton policy of Government must be based thereon and communicated to the public in official memoranda stating— (1) the varieties selected for cultivation to the exclusion of all others for the time being and tl^ main data on which the selection has been made; and (2) the measures adopted by Government for the provision of suitable seed and for the elimination of objectionable varieties. All necessary preventive measures must of course be and remain per manently in the hands of Government acting through the intermediary of its agricultural experts and for a long time to come it will be necessary,and indeed advantageous that Government should retain a monopoly of the 'seed supply involving the buying up of all seed produced locally from year to year in order to prevent the spreading of undesirable types and the production by cultivation or import (but preferably by cultivation) of sufficient quantities of sound seed to meet all reasonable demands in the interests of the rapid extension of cotton cultivation throughout the country. v The task of providing seed will tax the resources of Government to the utmost and will necessitate the creation of large plantations without delay. It must be realised however that in the early stages of the administration of the country Government will be beset by urgent demands on its attention by a variety of problems, each of which will be pressed by those concerned as being of primary and vital importance; financial consideration must necessari ly weigh heavily in the consideration of these problems and we must be prepared to see a promising scheme of cotton cultivation shelved owing to the urgency of providing suoli funds as are immediately available for a life and •death scheme of river conservancy or police administration. Government’s financial policy m Mesopotamia must be bold but sound, while no policy, however bold will provide sufficient money for the tackling of every sound scheme that is put forward. A further consideration is that the necessary •expert stafi for the administration of large and rapidly increasing plantations may not be available when wanted unless the terms offered by Government are such as to create legitimate discontent among its agricultural employees in other countries. Everything points to the necessity of interesting private enterprise in the development of cotton cultivation in Mesopotamia. Future Punjab and • P riv ft e mdrvntoals and companies have been entrusted successfully with important development schemes and there is no reason why similar or greater success should not attend such an experiment in the development of Mesopotamia as a cotton growing country. 6. Ihe British Cotton Growing Association. , , T K e kf 8 * poiicy for Government to adopt in this matter would seem to be to decide definitely ±fom the outest that, while the experimental cultivation of •cotton varieties m the interests of agricultural science may and must be regarded as part of the legitimate and essential duties of the agricultural experts of Government, the latter should not be required to undertake the production of cotton seed on a commercial scale, a task which should be left to private enterprise under adequate supervision and proper safeguards. 4 -- i n ®g‘ c, f 1 ations of the Punjab Government with the Inter national Cotton Federation before the war suggest the direction in which we should seek the assistance of private enterprise and Colonel Wilson who is •entrusting me with the task of making arrangements on his behalf specificallv mentioned the British Cotton Growing Association as a suitable instrument for the furtherance of the cotton growing policy of the Mesopotamian Government tool to i f lm - Ury haS n i? to understand that his Association would be T1 ! W ^Pff^tn/ally.any _ suggestion that it should shoulder the ® &gt;f pioheer work m this direction and it remains to consider on what es negotiations with it may be carried to a mutually satisfactory issue I have considered the possibility of the B.C.G.A., being asked to act as le agents of Government m all matters relating to the development of the ^•otton growing potentialities of Mesopotamia. This would involve the removal of cotton from the purview of the local agricultural department and the con- stitutmg of a cotton department pure and simple in the shape of the B C G A • the decisions and policy of the latter would after approval by the administra- 0 %39 tive authority be the decisions and policy of Government; in a word the B.C.G.A. would be a Government Department and Government Policy would be shaped by it. This solution does not commend itself to me for reasons which it is unnecessary to discuss in detail: Government cannot place itself unreservedly in the hands of any private body, however excellent that body ' may be, and must retain both the right and the ability to criticise, direct and, if necessary, interfere with the operations of anybody constituting the central cotton producing element in the country. In my opinion the greatest mutual advantages will be found to accrue from the establishment of a contractual relation between Government and the most favoured cotton growing agency in the country, the latter undertaking to grow cotton on a large scale under certain specified conditions and to provide the local population with food and facilities for the ginning, baling and commercial handling of cotton, while the former provides the necessary land, water for its irrigation and facilities for river transport and for the import and export overseas of machinery and baled cotton respectively. I would therefore tentatively suggest the adoption of a scheme on the following lines: — (1) that the Government should grant to the B.C.G.A. an area of land in Mesopotamia not less than 5,000 and not exceeding 10,000 acres in extent for the development of the cultivation of cotton; (2) that such area should preferably comprise not a single continuous block but three or more lots situated in localities considered-^ representative of the various zones into which the country falls naturally from the agricultural point of view ; (3) that the lots should consist of soil of good to fair average quality and be so situated as to be capable of immediate irrigation by mechanical lift from the rivers or existing canals and eventually of irrigation by flow’ as the canalisation of the country proceeds; (4) that the grant should in the first instance take the form of a lease for five years free of land revenue and all other Government charges (except wmter rates if the land is irrigated from existing prospective canals); such lease to be terminable at the end of the said period, % (a) by the B.C.G.A. without reason assigned and without any claim for compensation from Government for expenditure incurred, or (bj by Government only for failure on the part of the B.C.G.A. to carry out its part in the contract and on payment of com pensation for expenditure incurred by the B.C.G.A. in so far as such expenditure represents a permanent increase in : the value of the land as may be assessed by arbitrators: (5) that in the event of both parties being desirous of maintaining the arrangement at the end of the period in question the lease should be converted into a grant of the whole area to the B.C.G.A. in full and perpetual proprietary right, subject— (a) to the maintenance of a fixed annual percentage of cotton cultivation in the area of the grant; and .(b) to the payment of land revenue, cesses and other charges as assessed from time to time by Government; (6) that, in view of the importance of an early start being made in the wholesale cultivation of cotton and of the unlikelihood of the immediate creation of facilities for flow irrigationj the B.C.G.A. should undertake to enter into immediate possession of the area granted to it and to develop it by means of mechanical pumping installations: . . „ (7) that the B.C.G.A. should bind itself to cultivate no variety of cotton other than types approved by Government and should undertake to supply Government with seed in such quantities as may be required for distribution to private cultivators. (8) that as regards ginninp*. baling and commercial handling of cotton, Government should recognise the special position of the B.C.G.A. and, while specifically refraining from offering to it anything in the shape of a monopoly in these directions, should grant it special facilities; to be more precise .the facilities con templated would he somewhat as follows: — (a) the B.C.G.A. wmuld be granted a general licence to erect o’innino* and baling factories throughout the country and^ a similar licence would be granted to it for the commercial handling of cotton—its transport, sale or purchase, export, (b) permission to erect factories within comoeting distance of the B.C.G.A. factories would be withheld from other appli cants, while licences would possibly be granted to such appli cants for the erection of factories outside the competitive radius only after the B.C.G.A. had been invited to step m and had declined to do so;(c) Licences for the commercial handling of cotton would similar ly be granted to other applicants only on the clearest proof of their bona fides and of a tendency on the part of the B.C.G.A. to keep prices depressed to the discouragement of the general cultivator; (9) that the B.C.G.A. should undertake to act as occasion requires as the agents of Government in such experimental work as may be delegated to it or in any other direction in which it may seem good to Government to avail itself of'its services and experience; an d . (10) that the B.C.G.A. should undertake to bring the whole area of its grant under cultivation within a period of five years from its first entry upon the land, on pain of forfeiting its claim to eventual proprietary' rights over such part of it as it has proved unable to develop. The above is only a rough sketch of the terms which seem to me to be generally suitable for incorporation in an agreement to lie entered into by the Mesopotamian Government on the one side and the B.C.G.A. on the other. 'The complete terms of such an agreement would have to be properly drafted by experts after full discussion on points of detail between the contracting' parties. 7. Mis cel i.aneoijs Matter s . I have not considered it necessary in a preliminary note of this kind to enter into the questions of local labour supply and of the prospect of the early consummation of some comprehensive scheme of irrigation for Mesopotamia. For the latter we have Sir William Wilcocks’ plans which will presumably be re-examined in detail and carried out with such modifications as may be considered necessary in proportion as the financial resources of the country admit. We may safely assume that in due course Mesopotamia will be covered with a network of canals and that any area now set apart for development as a cotton plantation will duly benefit by them, but it is clear that in the first instance what we want is to attract private enterprise and capital to the de velopment of the country before we are within measurable distance of achieving the complete canalisation of the country. It is on the attraction of such enter prise that we must concentrate our attention for the present and it must be made clear to any would-be speculator in this direction that he is not being asked to enter upon an allotment in which he will find all the conveniences of irrigation, etc., ready to his hand. We are particularly anxious to encourage the introduction of mechanical means of pumping from the rivers and it is solely on this understanding that we are prepared to offer a substantial grant of potentially valuable land on terms which cannot but be considered attractive. The question of labour is on a somewhat different footing and is one for wliose exhaustive discussion we have up to date extremely meagre information. Canals, railways and buildings will absorb much if not all the local labour on which we indented for war work; the existing agricultural population will certainly be found under the incentive of gain to be capable of dealing with a far greater area than it has ever in the past dreamed of cultivating, but when all is said and done we are faced with the fact that the existing population of Mesopotamia even if extended to the utmost of its powers will not be able to cope without assistance with the whole area wTiich the development of the canals will open up for cultivation. On the other hand, we may count with the greatest confidence on a large influx of agricultural population from the hill country and deserts which encircle Mesopotamia from Persia and Arabia on the growth of a healthier attitude than exists at present towards agricultural labour on the part of the nomad pastoral tribes both within and without Meso potamia. The prospective labour supply of the country may therefore be reckoned much larger than it seems, but there is one point on which one cannot insist too strongly—the supply must be used as economically as possible for two reasons: — Firstly it will be expensive : Secondly, it will not be capable of expansion by artificial means or in other words cheap Indian labour will not be admitted to the country on any account at any rate for agricultural purposes. While therefore there need be no reason to despair of finding' sufficient labour at reasonable rates for the rapid development of the country, it is clear that competition to secure it will inevitably force up the rates to an inordinate level unless the situation is firmly grappled with from the beginning and serious efforts are made all round to employ, machinery wherever it can be usefully resorted to. In this connexion it may be useful to point out that the oil resources of Mesopotamia are so enormous and so capable of almost infinite development that the employment of machinery has the great advantage of combined economy and efficiency to recommend it seriously to those who would have a hand in the agricultural development of the country./ APPENDIX VIII.

I regret that pressure of work, owing to recent events on the Upper Euphrates, and the time limit imposed by the Foreign Office telegram in question, prevent^ me from recasting this report and submitting further information in amplification thereof. 3. Broadly speaking the situation may be summarized as follow (a) The economic position of this country is fairly satis factory. (b) Import trade with the United Kingdom has grown greatly since the war and will still further improve provided improved transport facilities by sea and by land are forthcoming* s r(a) For the first this country is dependent upon the P.&amp; 0. 6c 3.1. Oompnnies under Lord Inohoape who also virtually oontrcls river traffic. For the second we depend at present upon the willingness and ability of H.M.Gr. to develop the Railway system in this country on the lines already recommend ed and to negotiate a satisfactory extension into Persia from Lhaniqin. (d) Phe labour position is most unsatisfactory, skilled laoour of every sort is exceedingly scarce and exceedingly dear. This applies not merely to technical trades but to almost all branches of industry including the clerical estab- lishments. 4. I agree with Mr. Watkins in considering' that the British firms who have been operating in Mesopotamia during the past year have shown little tendency to improve upon their pre War methods to make the best of the situation in which they find themselves, a situation which is in many ways most hopeful for British frade. My own experience of them, as potential contractors and as tenderers for the supply of commodities for the use of the Civil Administration has been unsatisfactory, fheir methods are amateurish and their dealings unbusiness like. This may be due pertly to current trade conditions, out it is not encouraging. There are numerous competent and well rim netive firms in the country with whom it is very desirable that firms in G-reat Britain should get into touch, and this office is giving facilities to the oest of its ability to this end. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient servant, Lieut.-col., I.A*♦ Ag.

The CIVIL COMMISSIONER, BAG HD AD MEMORANDUM - - o - ~ I have made guarded enquiries from a number of mer- ciiants with a view to getting information on the suojects unaer enquiry but have had out little success, prooably for these reasons;-*— a certain amount of apathy aoout tacjcling tiie ject; urgent pre-engagements in connection with the aate season v.-hich has been the source of much anxiety; and finally in certair. cases an extraordinary degree of ignorance as to the firms future policy, combined with a reluctance to impart any informa tion on the subject. So far as the general question of trade between this country and the U.K. is concerned it can I thinx be safely said that the volume of imports is on the increase steadily and is above the prewar level, This is of course due to the absence of the enemy* countries as competitors, exhaustion of stocks both here and in Persia at the beginning of the war when imports were at a standstill and prooaoly very largely to the closing of the northern route into Persia which had therefore to derive supplies through Mesopotamia. I have no means of checking the statement, but am informed that goods were actually.reaching Russia through Mesopotamia and Persia. It may be found that the country is in a very much overbought position in the matter of piece goods, due to the fact that on ‘ising market anyone who could get credit could make money a r• —&gt;c—T -r V - 2 - money and consequently did so, only to stale the proceeds in nore piece goods (merchandise) which are still on order. few months v -i o 4 -V 1 p ras* 3 or not &lt;is merchnnts h.o.ve will show whether such is the cu^e o^ u , , v, a on-f- icient time to finish their previous commitments nearly haa suii icio^b u - LliC and to stop imports if -there is no market for them. It is not possiole to he'definite on the subject, as the figures tor prewar imports are ohose furnished by the Consuls who probably had difficulty in getting accurate figures, and, if dependant on the Turkish Customs,they must have oeen understated for obvious rea sons, The under- statement is probaoly fur greater than present). Again, the figures now shown in the Customs sta-U.mies Ire values at very much enhanced prices due to the war. The u- with the U.K. can only ce appro- actual proportion of our trade with the xiraated bemuse the numoer of direct shipments are still com paratively small and so much is consigned from India which is really of English manufacture, just as .practically all the ports of piece goods shown as imported from Persia oy sea are . . . v, other foreign manufacture recon- rsally of Indian or British and otner b signed from manommeiail• The total values of the import trade by sea for several years both before and during the war are as follows:- Rs 3,93,10,000 « 94,30,758 « 4,06,56,000 « 6,10,17,860 '11,10,26,854 . '15,37,52,552 of which fTom *20 to 30;^ are pro bably consigned direct from England. The. present high rate of the rupee is of course an incentive to merchants to make purchases in England, certainly of those commodities that have not risen in price in the u.h. in the same proportion as has the value of the rupee. Tie fnct will almost certainly tend to make merchants purchase U.K. in preference to Inuia.where prices are also high which case there is not the exchange advantage to oe rea P ea /‘ The same argument may of course oe used in respect oi the 1912 . . 1915 . • • • 1916 * . • • 1917 •• •• 1918 . • • • 1919 .. ) . • (eleven months)-3- the attraction of purchasing goods in Russia and Germany where the exchange value of the currency is at a very low ebb^ as there must be many things that have not risen in price nearly as much as the currency has fallen in value in silver, be it rupees or Krazis*«»»» Tt has been indicated above that encourage ment of trade 'betvveen Northern Persia and the continent by the northern land route will reflect on our trade here. As a result of over four years in this country^ I have formed the opinion that the British Merchants in this fcountry are too conservative ana too wedded to old conditions and channels of Dusinesstand for this reason thinx that much J A useful work might be done by commercial travellers who would » come out with samples and mahe personal enquiries^ ana then at the same time arrange with one of the loca^ firms or banxs to import and finance the transaction. There inust oe many aen in the bazar who w r ould be willing to buy a fair consignment of goods if they were introduced to the man who would show them the goods ana then arrange for the importing of them. My feel ing is that there is too much of a tendency for Messrs. A. B. Smith &amp; Go. of Basrah to say.-.’Tf you want a consignment of blank from England we will get them through our Messrs. 0. D. Smith &amp; Co.'j ana then to charge a commission for themselves and another for their London House. Commercial travellers are not unknown in Mesopotamia, out those who come are usually of the type who content themselves with seeing their particular, agents and then going off to some other part of the East, These agents are not in my opinion lively to do much more than sit in their offices and oe prepared to supply the particular com modity in which the traveller was interested if called upon and asked to do so. f I was much struck by the representative of •one of the large typewriter firms who was discussing various firms as possible agents for Mesopotamia^and who^ in referring to one of the principal firms here who had tried to get themmr - 4- the agency^ said tiiat iie thought that they would be much too big to -push the sale^ and that he v/as looking for some small concern which would oe likely to tai^e active steps to sell his machines. Were it possible for a group of manufacturers at home to appoint one man who should spend most of his time out here learning the language^ unhintiorod with tms’ office,ana visiting tne snap-keep ers ni:selfj1 am sure that considerable expansion is possiule, Wu ch assistance could be given by a Commercial Intelligence Officer who might even take in hand the supply of a number of interpreters who would assist those Travellers who were unable to speak Arabic, ana who would also assist in the preparation of price lists written in Arabic. The people here have begun to get used to being without German goods and are only slowly beginning to make enquiries as go v/nether they may re-open old connections, I think that if we cater for their tastes (instead of expecting the tastes to change) there is no reason why we should not retain much of the trade that we gained owing to the absence of Geman competxtion. l/uch of what is written in this connection in VT Lloyds report is as true now as when it v r as written. The figures for the total exports for recent years are as follows/here again^as in the case of imports, it is no g possible to place overmuch reliance on the figures): — 1912 Rs4,87,05,000 £l/-/- r Rs15/-) 1917 ' 1,23,00,000 1918 ” 1,71,00,000 1919 (11 months) 3,62,00,000. . v It is on tire stimulation of the exports that we must depend largely for an increased•capacity to import, and that brings us to the question of transport and labour as an assistance to production. Until recently, and even now, the rival claims of other parts of the world for tonnage have made exports of many things an impossibility, fortunately for the country the ArmyAsas 1 has been able to relieve it of its exportable surplus of foodstuffs and it has not therefore been necessary to find J tonnage for it. Wool has been able to pay the high rates of freight now ruling^as the world prices have been high; dates have also been able to find a market at the high prices ren dered necessary by shortage of tonnage. They' have however been much handicapped,in spite of the 40000 or 50000 tons that are ■carried away in sailing vessels annually/.That tonnage was a. material factor is indicated by the fact that some of the food Controller's purchases of dates last year were not shipped -t all, whilst the condition of some of those shipped must nave caused anxiety owing to the lateness of their arrival in ling- land. It seems probable that the present rate of exchange is lively to oe a more serious handicap in the case of ship ments to the United ningdom than the shortage of tonnage. There are now in sight a number of ships which will loan ior England direct and thus the expensive and unsatisfactory pro cess of transhipment in India or Egypt will be avoided. One of the great handicaps to trade at the present moment is the scarcity and cost of labour. Tt is a handicap in two ways; it limits production and therefore the capacity to import,and it increases the cost of goods from the moment that discharge from, the steamer begins till the time that they reach the consumer either up-country or in-Persia. It m ts about ten times as much to move goous from the wharf to the merchants godown in Basrah as it does in Calcutta. The Arab is not I should say industrious and he is certainly oi an independant nature; but were he the former and not the latter, he only exists in Mesopotamia in limited numbers, and it there fore follows that immigrant labour from the hills or else where must be encouraged before any very vast schemes of agricultural production can be carried thro.ugh, i^ith good- 6 - -Y©' XT') ($y good government, security of tenure and a settled political atmosphere^ it is probable that it will be found that many Arabs who at present live in the Desert will lose their contempt for the settler and will tahe up land ana cultivate it^to the financial advantage of tuemselves and those who manufacture and handle the increased imports that t&amp;ey will require. The s necessities of war condition^have raised the mtes of wages ■ all roundjWith the result that clerics who would not be able to earn a living (as clerics) in ordinary times are at present earning the equivalent of fifteen pounds a month or more, Indian clerics^ content with thirty or forty rupees in India^ are able to command here practically a minimum of one hundred and fifty, with rations and quarters or an equivalent, The capacity for woric of these men is not up to that of Europeans^, the level of whose wages they are approaching^and it therefore seems to .me that they must either increase their capacity by education and application (a goal at which the Educational Department is aiming) or they must revert to a lower level. T't is hoped | that the former result will be attained; out meanwhile^ there is at least one firm here considering the advisability, of relying almost entirely on European subordinates. As already stated^one of the principal factors in the restriction of trade developments is tnat of finance. In tne first place, there are certainly large stocks of goods in tiie country which were purchased with a 1/6: rupee. The rupee ■* ^ at the time of writing is worth 2/2 with the result that there is a tendency for merchants taking up documents at the current rate to undersell those who imported a few months ago. The local ercnants are very inclined to retain their stocks ins- A tead of selling and cutting their losses^ with the result that the Banhs are reluctant to deal with the paper of those mer chants known to hold large stocks purchased at the old rate of exchange.-7- T~li ' Fluctuations in exchange have a very disturbing effect- on trade (merchants cannot undertake business the profit on I which may be converted into a loss by a fall in exchange) and it will mateTially assist matters when stabilisation is efiected # This matter is now the subject of a Commission in England, and any suggestions on the suoject are therefore superfluous, Xt is however suggested by banxers that^if it is intended to maxe the. rupee the currency of trie country^ steps should oe taken to with draw' the lira from circulation^ as it cannot oe used as currency owing to its fluctuations in value. It is suggested that it would oe oi material assistance to India t-o puicnase liras here and to ship them to India for sale (as gold) against silver, The price in -Baghdad is about Rs 13-8-0^ and the gold value in India is said to oe auout F 3 14-8-0^ ■which would leave a handsome profit (this subject is outside my domain and I therefore only pass on the suggestion for what it is worth}) Consideration of alterations of exchange carry us again to the value of the mark and the possible^ effect of the re-open ing of the northern land route into Persia, ‘Before •the war a \ Persian merchant had to pay ’about 100 xrans for 06 marks worth I of goods, whereas the position now is tnat he has only to pay [ about 28 krans for 100 ' marks worth of goods. The Russian exchange position is said to oe still more formidable. The effect on the ; re-opening of the route under reference must therefore be watched i most carefully and meanwhile anytning that we can do to reduce the cost of transit by routes that pass through kesopotamia,or which necessitate carriage in our shipping^is advantageous^This carries the subject to that of transport to Mesopotamia and through it by river and or land to and into lersia. The following figures show approximately the rates of steamer freights to and from the United iiingdom^and also to and'sacs- 6 - and from India^for the years 1913-1919:- Basraii to United kingdom S D 1913 .. 30/- 1914 .. 37/6 - 50/- 1915 .. 80/- 1916 .. 160/- - 200/- ... 1917 .. 2&lt;10/- - 220/- ... 1918 .. -do- 1919 .. 172/- united Kingdom to Basrah.

The greater rise in the case of export freights to U.K.^and their greater tendency to remain at so high a level is due doubtless to the fact that steamers discharging here are required ordinarily to load foodstuffs and other essentials in India # There is however a general impression amongst merchants that high freights between India and Basrah at least are due to the practical monopoly.qf the B.I.S.b.Go.| Whether such an accusation is justified^! am unable to judgejbut I have no doubt that the local merchants dislixe the B.l. for its inde pendant attitude, and because they believe that they are being exploited. The same feeling is abroad in respect of what is regarded as approaching an Ixichcape monopoly oi the river traffic|* In regard to the sea transport, I 'thinx that remedy by Government action is almost hopeless^ and I am not sure that a monopoly could not be turned to advantage to British trade as a whole in the matter of booxing goods on a through bill oi lading from the manufacturing centres in^say, England to Baghdad or Persia^provided that the. goods were carried in British jDiiprovements are possible ixi the handling oi cargo on the Gulf run_j and this can only be effected by more supervision by the ships* agents &amp; officers and greater determination on the part of shippers and insurance agents not to accept claused dills of lading, ana to press their claims ior damage and**70 j -9- i und pilferage.

More is to oe gained Oy a general comoina- tion of-steamer interests to fight foreign shipping. In the matter of river transport the case is not so easy to determine, as we haveTbeing a Government fleet that can to some extent iind its own freight for the present in the stores required for the Army &amp; Civil Administrations,and we also have the require ments of the Anglo Persian Oil Company for river freight for their oil. It might therefore be possible to fight the Inchcape ^ it ponsiciered necsss&amp;ry. group with some degree of success,were it consia. oy running a Government line or oy leasing steamers to the | a.P.O.C. Here again I am doubtful whether interference is 'i as I have little faith in the ability of Govern- axiK ahvisaole ab i nave xxu me nt to run a commercial concern as efficiently and cheaply as a business firm could; and on the other hand,were one group allowed to absorb all the river traffic in the ordinary course of competition (if able to do so), subject to Government con- trol as to maximum freights, it would render it far easier to discriminate,in the matter of through rates to Baghdad or Persia - t in ritish bottoms and those of undesir- between tonnage orougnt in -ritisn ed competitors.

In consequence there is very little nuiual trans port from Baghdad ana many animals have seen taken to Tirauq and Q,asr-i-Shirin. At the latter place there is delay, as a transporter will contract to carry 100 loads and,as he has perhaps only 2b animals,ne consequently -as to u_ neys. This is naturally a disadvantage but some merchants state that it happened also in Turkish times.

It however urges that at the exis ting rail-head there are none of the many necessary facili ties for storage and handling of cargo and transport; thesec 12 - these facilities should be furnished so soon as possible,unless the completion of the railway to Kermanshah is a prospect of the immediate future. Hoads in Persia are reported to have been improved by military forces passing through and are now suit able in many cases for mechanical transport^which will cheapen freight and shorten the period occupied in transport, Steps have already been taken to import lorries^ and there is no doubt that their introduction on the central roads will be in favour of the Mesopotamia route and consequently of Mesopotamia trade. The effect^ of rates of transport in Persia on the trade of this country is indicated to some extent by the facts that a short time ago the rates of freight from Ahwaz to Isphahan were reduced from thirty krans to seven krans per Shah maund^ a no. the value of the exports from masrah to Kahomerah has risen from two lacs of rupees in August to nine lacs in November (of course to a large extent a probable cause which reduced the rate also increased the exports , i.e. greater security oi the roads).

This expurgated edition seems, so far as can be judged from a cursory inspection, to have been prepared with care and to be suitable for confidential circulation to British Prims. There are some passages that would have been better omitted if the report had been intended for . s*&lt;. widespread publication (hn passages marked on pages 9, 27, 28, 29), - also a reference, on page 39 r to an Appendix that has been omitted. Incidentally, the names of the authors do not appear,which might possibly lead to the quoting of passages as if they were official statements and not personal opinions. But these minor criticisms can hardly constitute objection to a limited confidential circulation of the expurgated version. It is however clear that this report will not meet the desires of the Department of Overseas Trade. The report, besides being somewhat limited in its geographical scope (the Commissioners havingvisi^ed the Basra vilayet only) and rather out of date, is of value rather as a mine of general information covering a wide field than as a detailed guide to commercial enterprise.

Sir, Y«* / I an directed to inform you that this Department has recently given renewed consideration to the question of the manner in which use might he made of the valuable report on the Prospects of British Trade in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf prepared in 1917 by Mr. R. E. Holland and Mr. J. H. ilson. It will be in Mr. Montagu’s recollection that at the time at which the report was received it was decided in joint consultation i im our Department and with the Foreign Oixice that it could not suitably be made public or even be circulated confidentially to firms interested. The question was considered afresh at a later stage, but it was still u... ought undesirable that any circulation should be given to the‘report pending the Peace negotiations in relation to turkey. 2. In view of the unavoidable delay which has occurred, much, of the report is now somewhat out of date. It must be remembered aL so that the report was prepared largely from the point of view of supplying data and The Under Secretary' of State, INDIA. OFFICE, cn cm cn cC. jd S. . 1 •- information, to His Majesty’s Government, and it contains consequently much political matter and recommendations for Government action which are unsuitable for publication In these circumstances it appears to this Department that it can scarcely be utilised in the ordinary manner by publication or circulation to selected firms, at any rate until so long an interval has elapsed that its commercial value would have been seriously impaired. 3 . Sir Hamar Greenwood is, however, of opinion that reliable and detailed information about the openings for British trade and enterprise in Mesopotamia in the conditions which now exist in that country would be of very great importance to British commercial interests, am it has occurred to him that it mght be possible for the : s|J Commerce and Industry Department of the Local Government . J to prepare a report in which this aim would be specifically ■ j i kept in view. The volume prepared by Mr. Holland alH Mr. Wilson would no doubt be of great assistance as a basis for the new compilation and I am accordingly to suggest tha copies of it might be sent to the Civil Commissioner at Baghdad, and that he might be asked whether arrangements could not be made for the preparation of a report dealing with commercial prospects in Mesopotamia which will be thoroughly up-to-date, and suitable in all respects for -j -3- &gt;5 publication. If this could be arranged it would ! appear to be preferable to the despatch of a Commissioner from this country specially for the purpose of pre- 3. paring/ further report on these lines. 4. Should this proposal be accepted it may be convenient for the compilers of the report to have before them copies of reports recently prepared for this Department in respect of Ouher counurles as indicating the type of information which is especially of value, and I am accordingly to enclose copies of reports upon British trade in Greece and horocco. I am, however, tc explain that these reports, and dspecially that relating to Greece, are considerably fuller than would presumably be necessary in the case of Mesopotamia or than would probably be practicable with the staff at the disposal of the Civil Commissioner. 5. Should Mr. Montagu concur in this proposal, I am to suggest that copies of this letter and enclosure should be sent to the Civil Commissioner. 6.

The first British commercial mission to the Persian Gulf was despatched British trade with bv the factors at Surat in November, 1616, in the hope of finding a market for the i emau Gulf, broadcloth. British factories were soon established at Shiraz and Ispahan and the prosperity of the rival Portuguese settlement at Hormuz was seriously- affected. The fall of Hormuz in 1622 and the defeat of the Portuguese fleet in 1625 by the combined British and Dutch fleets marked the end of the Portuguese supremacy, but the Ducth then became the most formidable rivals of the English and they maintained their commerce until the middle of the eighteenth century when they were expelled from their last settlement at Kharao* and left the Gulf for good. In 1759 a Drench naval expedition captured and destroyed the British factory at Bandar Abbas and forty years later, the despatch of political missions by Bonaparte to the East aroused apprehensions as to French designs upon Persia and the Gulf. British predominance was, however, not seriously assailed until the time of the South African war, when the pressure exercised by foreign powers impelled the British Government to realise and exert the strength which had accrued to them from long years of political and commercial ascendency m the Persian Gulf. As a result the British position in the Gulf became stronger than ever. The political tension relaxed in 1903 and the declaration made by Lansdowne in the House of Lords in that year warned all nations that Great Britain would not consent to the establishment of a nav al base or of a fortitjed oort in the Persian Gulf by any other power. On the occasion of the Convention with the Bussian Government in 1907, emphasis was again laid on the special interests of Great Britain m the Persian Gulf and the existence of those interests was explicitly recognised by the Russian Government. A survey of British enterprise in the Gulf indicates— (i) that the assumption of political responsibilities in that area vas the inevitable consequence of commercial success and (ii) that British political predominance achieved through commerce could only be undermined through commerce. 2 British officials, realising that tlie political edifice stood upon the shifting E „ ss ;»„ sands ’ of trade, anxiously watched for evidence of foreign encroachment. '™- Kussia was the focus of apprehension in the first place Lord Curzon m 18 JO had estimated the total foreign trade of Persia at about 7 millions sterling, of which the British share was about 3 millions or 43 per cent, and the Russia i share not much more than 2 millions or about 29 per cent. In the matter of imports, the Bussian share was only 22 per cent, as against the .Bntish sharebf 51 percent.' The first report of the Belgian Customs AtomistmLon for the year 1901-1902 put the foreign trade of Persia at £J.°W)00 of J™. ® tll A Br iti 8 h share was £2,700,000 and the Bussian share £3,642,000. Bntisn imports^had increased during the decade by 37 per cent., but Bussian imports had been more than trebled and Persian exports to Russia had also expand.! iu a remarkable manner. In response to representations, Messrs. H ‘W. Maclean and^ A. . Newcomen were deputed in 1903 and 1901 respectively to study the situation. Briefly speaking, they attributed the development of Bussian trade to (1) Lie improvement in communications between the manufacturing centres of Bussia and the border provinces of Persia, which happened to be the most cultivated, populous and prosperous portions of the Kingdom, and (^) tbe _ ac u&lt; Bussia had taken special measures to encourage the export of Bussian goons to Persia by granting favourable through rates, drawback of duties, and refund of excise, and banking facilities.2 German cjmpetition. German political aims. British shipping companies. The recommendations which were made by these two Commissioners for the improvement of British trade will be discussed later. 3. Anxiety was next aroused by the growing success of German trade in V,d, Appendix i. Mesopotamia and Mr. George Lloyd was despatched to report on the situation in 1907. At the moment when war broke out, German trade was rapidly forging ahead and their shipping was a thorn in the flesh to the British companies. The total value of the Persian Gulf sea-borne trade, excluding coasting and local trade, was, in 1906, £3,205,000 and of this the British and Indian share was £6,467,000 or 79 per cent. The German share was about £371,000 only, but it had increased from about 2 per cent, in 1895 to 4J per cent! in 1906. The figures for the year 1913-14 show that the total sea-borne trade of the Gulf, excluding coasting and local trade, was about £12,482,000, the British and Indian share being approximately £9,600,000 or about 76 per cent. The German share was £1,154,000 or 9 per cent, of the total Gulf trade. It must be remembered, however, that the figures for India included a con siderable quantity of continental as well as British goods transhipped for the Gulf at Indian ports. Further the trade statistics are not the sole index of German competition and attention must also be paid to shipping. In 1906 most of the steam vessels, which comprised 91 per cent, of the tonnage eno-ao-ed in the Gulf steamer trade, were under the British flag. The total entrances of shipping at Persian Gulf ports in 1906 amounted to 1,964,000 tons of which British and British Indian accounted for 1,685,000 tons or 85 per cent The German share had risen from about '8 per cent, in 1895 to about 4 per cent, in 1906. In 1913-14, the total entrances amounted to 2,125,200 tons of which the British and British Indian share was 1,719,000 tons or 80 per cent. In clearances the percentage was about the same. The German share m 1913-14 in entrances and clearances rose to 14 per cent, and 9 per cent, respectively. The cargoes ^of German ships consisted largely of goods carried for other European countries. 4. It will be seen that the pecuniary value of the Gulf trade was no great matter and British commerce would not have been very seriously affected if the Gulf and its trade had been swept out of existence. Any sustained commercial competition in the Gulf, however, inevitably reacted upon the British political position, and it was abundantly clear that the real object of the German operations was not primarily to extend commerce but to secure a political status in the Gulf with an eye to future developments German commercial enterprise in the Gulf was, and would have been for some years to come, backed by the German Government to whatever extent might be requisite to insure success for the grandiose political designs that w^ere afoot. German ambition contemplated a huge economic domain stretching from the North Sea to the Indian Ocean and the Nile, which would exert pressure upon the British Empire at its most sensitive points, namely Egypt and the Persian Gulf. The railway from Berlin to Baghdad and the Persian Gulf was to become the vital nerve in German economic life and policy, and money spent in financing commercial attacks upon British supremacy in the Gulf was, therefore, a politically remunerative investment. It is unnecessary here to recapitulate the story of German intrigue and its highly successful result. Suffice it to say that just before the°war the Germans had accomplished their object of maintaining German control over the section of the Turkish Railway which essentially affected British interests viz., that between Baghdad and Basrah, and they had also managed to secure representation on, and a share of the capital in, the new Anglo-Ottoman con cern which was formed for the navigation of the Tigris. In addition serious competition against Messrs. Lynch Brothers was started on the Karun river between Mohammerah and Ahwaz, and on the Lynch road to Ispahan. . .*■*■ Such special measures as may seem desirable for the development of British commerce on both shores of the Gulf and in Mesopotamia will be dealt with later, but attention should be directed in the first place to the essential importance of securing advantages for British shipping. r T? r £3 With a view to consolidate British commercial interests against attack, the shipping companies concerned should be organised so as to render the best and most economical service possible as public carriers. Before the war, the British steamer services between Europe and the Gulf, were carried on by vessels belonging to the following Companies :— (1) Ellerman and Bucknall Lines. (2) Messrs. Strick &amp; Co. (3) Messrs. Marcus Samuel &amp; Co. (4) Messrs. Andrew Weir &amp; Co. (5) The British India Steam Navigation Company (with transhipment in India for Europe). At the time when competition commenced from the Hamburg-America Line, the rates demanded by British steamers could not be called excessive, having regard to canal dues, the price of coal in Basrah and the delay and expense involved in lightering cargo over the Eao bar. On other hand, it was argued^ that the practical monopoly which the British Lines enjoyed had had a prejudicial effect on their service before the Hamburg-America Line commenced operations. The Vice-Consul at Bushire spoke of the British combine as not paying sufficient attention to the wishes and needs of the local traders and prophesied that if a new line, whether British, Russian or German, came into the trade, it would receive strong support because of the dissatisfaction of the trading community with the existing services. The British steamer sailings were reported to be very irregular and infor mation regarding them very difficult to obtain. Complaints were made of their neglect to cater for the trade to and from Europe at the smaller Gulf and Arab Coast Ports and of their failure to provide space for grain from Bushire when grain was available there for shipment. 6. The shipowners’ contentions were briefly as follows: — (a) that the Mesopotamian and Gulf trade was very limited and by no means easy to handle ; (6) that from a business point of view the trade did not warrant any thing beyond the services rendered ; (&lt;?) that the amount of cargo offering at small Gulf and Arab Coast Ports was not sufficient to justify the extra steaming and delay involved in a call; (d) that Bushire, as a grain shipping port, had an unenviable notoriety, owing to the habit of the Persian authorities of suddenly placing an embargo against shipments ; and (e) that, if it was in British interests to nurse the Persian Gulf, it should be done at the expense of the nation and not out of the shipowners’ pockets. • The success of the German Line was no doubt largely due to the subsidy received from the German Government, and to profits on carriage of the material for the construction of the Baghdad railway. The German tactics in securing practically the whole of the shipments from Antwerp to the Gulf and Mesopotamia for their own steamers was a further victory and a heavy blow for the British Lines. The service supplied by the Hamburg- America Line was, owing to the subsidy, of necessity an improvement on the British services. The regularity of sailings and the facilities afforded for granting through bills of lading to ports other than those actually called at by the steamer itself were much appreciated. It may be taken for granted that the subsidy paid to the Hamburg- America Line for the first few years was very considerable, but at the time when the firm of Wonckhaus and Company, were securing practically all the grain in the Mesopotamian and the Persian markets, it is possible that this w r as done at the cost of the Baghdad railway interest and not from the pockets of the German tax-payer.4 The shipping between India and the Gulfi 7. On pre-war data, as far as exports from Europe are concerned, two steamers of 5,000 tons capacity per month were more than sufficient to meet the demands of the trade, taking into consideration the European cargo, transhipped for the Gulf in Bombay. It is impossible to gauge what the actual shipping requirements between Europe, the Persian Gulf and Mesopotamia and vice versa will be until the war is over and the new conditions dependent on its result are known. All that can be said at the present is, that, if Mesopotamia is to be British or under British protection and if our predominance in the Gulf is to be maintained, a regular steamship service to and from Europe should be inaugurated, not working rigidly on a fixed time-table but with as great regularity as’can be arranged. Such a service -would be in addition to, and would not supersede, the shipping facilities normally enjoyed by merchants before the war. The service should include London, Manchester and Antwerp, at any rate on the way out, and the ships should call at Bushire regularly, and also at any other Gulf Port, if inducement on business lines may offer. On the homeward voyage, after leaving Basrah, Mohammerah, and Bushire, the ships might in the same way be sent in to Bahrein and Bunder Abbas. Marseilles and London should be fixed ports of call in Europe on the way home and facilities should be provided for the grant ing of through bills of lading for Hamburg, Kotterdam and American ports and others, if necessary. His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul in Bushire has suggested the desirability of a fortnightly service, but, under present conditions, no Company of standing is likely to pledge itself to such an undertaking without some actual experience, and, therefore, at any rate as a commencement, a monthly service would seem appropriate. Such a service would assure the shippers from Baghdad that their cargo would be moved to Europe once a month and thus put an end to the complaints that Baghdad goods were often detained two or three months in Basrah to suit the convenience of the British Lines. It would cater for the requirements of the small grain shipper, who is not in a position to deal in thousands of tons at a time and it would help the Persian Gulf Ports. It is suggested that the steamers on this service should be provided with accommodation for some 20 passengers, all of one class, and with passage rates at a moderate figure. This is intended to meet the requirements of the officials and merchants residing in, or visiting, Mesopotamia, and would probably not appeal to globe-trotters, most of whom might prefer to travel via India. 8. It would seem advisable that the powerful shipping interests in these waters should combine with a view to arrange shipping facilities at the end of the war, on the lines here laid down and in order to be prepared to meet the great expansion which is bound to come, owing to the anticipated exten sion of cultivation and development of trade in Mesopotamia and Southern Persia. Careful attention should also be drawn to the necessity of the British companies securing the sugar trade from Antwerp to the Gulf, if Belgian loaf sugar is again to supply Gulf markets after the war. 9. The services between India, the Persian Gulf and Basrah are provided by:- (1) The British India Steam Navigation Company. (2) The Arab Steamers, Limited. (3) The Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company, Limited. (4) Haji Sultan Ali Shushteri and Company. (5) The Abad Company (Japanese Steamers under nominal charter to * Mirza Muhammad Shirazi). Complaints are not uncommon among shippers and consignees in regard to the high freights and the failure of the shipping companies to pay sufficient attention to the wishes and needs of local traders. The following are the main heads of complaint:— (1) That freights are unduly high especially in regard to the transport of * a- endix n ^ ea ’ ^ ea 9 ucs ^ on dealt with in i pen 1X ’ a separate note * and the charge does not appear to be proved.5 / In response to similar complaints regarding high freights in the past, the Company have on various occasions declared that their Gulf Lines were unre- munerative and that they could not afford to lower their rates. It must be remembered that except in the date season, cargo from the Gulf is very scarce and therefore the upward rates have to bear the expense of running the steam ers. As trade expands after the war, the rates will probably tend to fall and, in any case, the surest remedy for high rates is to he found in healthy com petition between the shipping companies. So long as foreign shipping com petition between India and the Gulf need not he feared, there is no reason to favour a monopoly. There should be plenty of room for more ships and the investment of Persian and Arab capital in Muhammadan steamship lines is deserving of every encouragement, since it will do much to consolidate political as well as commercial relations between the Gulf and India. (2) That owing to want of proper supervision and unsatisfactory arrange ments for storing ca^go on board ship, a great deal of pilfering takes place on board all the vessels to India. The Company’s answer to this charge is:— (a) that goods are pilfered not only on the ship but (1) in the port of shipment, (2) between the ship and the shore at the port of con signment, nnd (3) in the Customs : (b) that losses are due largely to imperfect packing. Cases and pack ages are often only held together by means of outside wrappings, and gunnies used for grain, etc., are far too light to stand ordinary handling. It must be admitted that the systematic pilfering and breaching of cargo which is carried on is a serious blot on the shipping trade between India and the Gulf. The shipping companies cannot, however, be regarded as solely responsible in the matter, since the packing of local Indian goods and produce is notoriously bad. The Indian, Persian and Arab coolies who handle the cargo have a well-developed propensity for thieving, and before the war the customs arrangements at most of the ports were such as to favour dishonesty. It may be possible after the war, at some ports at least, to improve the conditions under which cargo is landed and stored but, so far as pilfering on the ship is concerned, the best remedy would seem to he the placing of a responsible European officer in each ship as super-cargo, the policing of the holds when in harbour, and better supervision of cargo, coolies and passengers as they leave the ship. This would be an advantage from the shipping company’s point of view, as it would ensure that cargo in bad condition would not escape notice. It is difficult, how ever, to suggest any means of remedying the bad packing which is responsible for a very great deal of the loss of cargo and there is not likely to be much improvement in this respect until both the shipper and the consignee view the matter ip a new light, and realise that no shipping company can be expected to safeguard their property, unless it starts on its journey in a reasonably secure condition. At the same time loss is not confined at present to frail articles, hut is experienced in the case of well packed bales, and the merchants complain that it is the more valuable bales in particular which are especially liable to be opened. The shipping companies might conceivably be able, in combination to quote a lower rate of freight on goods, if in strong cases, and grain shipped in double gunnies. When the fine steamers newly constructed for the Gulf last and slow mails before the war, are again employed on the run, it should be easier for the British India Company to take measures against pilfering of cargo in their ships in the future. There is nothing which causes so much resentment against a shipping company as the receipt of goods or parcels in a condition which suggest that they have been badly treated or wilfully broken open while on board the steamer. (3) The third charge is procrastination and reluctance in giving and paying certificates of shortage of goods undelivered. The British India Company, and other lines also, disclaim in their bills of lading responsibility for loss, damage, etc., due to theft on board, and wdiether by persons in the service of the Company or not, or by any act or neglect of the officers or other agents of the Company on board or elsewhere. In fact, the6 /r~' exemption clauses of the bill of lading, if literally interpreted, would free the Company from any sort of liability for the condition in which the cargo is to he handed over on delivery. No one would expect the Company to accept full liability for damage caused to goods while on the ship or in process of unloading, but where such damage is caused, either through neglect or wilfully, by one of the Company’s employes, it would seem only reasonable that they should be prepared to pay compensation. It would seem desirable that the exemption clauses of the bill of lading should be altered in favour of the shipper and consignee. The Report of the French Chamber of Commerce also makes a similar recommendation in regard to the shipping trade of China with a view to define clearly the responsibilities of the transporting company. The British India Company’s Agents say that no justifiable claim is allowed to be passed over and that no other Company that has ever plied in the G-ulf has met the merchants in such a liberal manner as the British India Company. As regards the printed clauses in the bill of lading, they say that, in practice, no reasonable claim is refused although the Company may be protected under the exemption clauses. It is undoubtedly true that merchants find it much easier to obtain payment of claims from the British India Company than from any other line engaged in the Gulf trade, and honest investigation can be counted on; but it is understood that this Company’s Agents in the Gulf are also Lloyd’s Agents, to whom the claims have to be submitted, and it would be fairer if Lloyd were independently represented. On the other hand, if the exemption clauses in the bill of lading do not exactly represent the limits of the legal liabilities of the shipping companies, it would seem desirable that they should be altered so as to correspond with facts, since otherwise they are bound to create a mis leading impression especially in the case of native merchants and shippers of the type found in the Persian Gulf and Basrah. It might be suggested for the Company’s 'consideration that if the time occupied in the enquiry into complaints could be lessened and if local agents could be given a freer hand by their head offices in India in settling disputes with clients, much advantage would ensure. (4) Other complaints relate to the fact that higher rates to the Gulf were charged by the British India Company from Karachi than from Bombay, that preferential treatment was accorded to certain shippers, that cargo is frequently shut out of the Company’s steamers, although permission to ship has been granted, that clean “ mate’s receipts ” are unjustifiably refused after the cargo has been tallied on board, that cargo at Bushire and Mohammerah is sometimes shut out of the steamer, causing loss and inconvenience to exporters, etc. It is sufficient to say that the complaints, generally speaking, are not of a serious nature, nor are they peculiar to the Persian Gulf. It would be a remarkable thing if there were no complaints against the British India Com pany or any other shipping company, and differences of opinion between the steamship lines and the merchants and consignees are hound to arise. The British India Company have been labouring under great difficulties caused by the loan of many of their steamers to Government, but when the war is over they will be in a position to afford vastly improved facilities both to shippers and passengers. (5) Lastly, before the war it was impossible in the case of merchandise intended for certain ports to get through rates quoted for goods which had to be transhipped in India. After the war, improved arrangements should be made by the issue of through bills of lading, to cater for cargo to ports which are not served by direct steamers. Delays at the port of transhipment should be curtailed as much as possible. The Hamburg-America line gained much popularity by the attention which they paid to the transhipment trade. - MESOPOTAMIA. British trade and commerce in Mesopotamia; 10. As mentioned in paragraph 3 above, the Board of Trade published in 1908 an exhaustive treatise by Mr. George Lloyd on the conditions and prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia. Mr. Lloyd’s General Report isdivided into nine heads dealing respectively with geography, agriculture, mills and factories, native industries, currency and exchange, trade methods, customs administration, foreign competition and communications. The British occu pation of Mesopotamia has enabled a great deal of fresh information to be collected in regard to its geographical characteristics. But this will doubtless be made available in other publications, and it is unnecessary to add anything in this report to the general description given by Mr. Lloyd. There is nothing new to be said under the heads of “ mills and factories ” or “ native industries' and the problems connected with the Turkish customs administration and Turkish currency have, of course, entirely disappeared from ^ view in conse quence of the British occupation. Agriculture will be dealt with separately. Mr. Lloyd’s conclusions under the remaining heads of trade methods, foreign competition and communications, so far as they have a bearing on the conditions and prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia after the war, have been analysed for convenient reference in an Appendix to this report. Briefly speaking, his conclusions were as follows. The total foreign trade of Basrah in the year 1906 was &lt;£3,155,000. Of See Appendix I. the imports, which were £1,511,000, eSfofmcefs about three-quarters went to Baghdad, achieved. British imports into Basrah and Baghdad were chiefly cotton goods and twist and hardware. Of the exports, which were £1,641,000, the most important were dates, grain, horses, liquorice, opium and wool. A very large proportion of the exports went to England and India. Germany was the chief competitor and German trade was being rapidly built up in a great variety of articles, especially hardware, while German ships were beginning to secure the transport of Austrian, Belgian and French sugar which had previously been in British hands. Mr. Lloyd attributed the German success to the fact that they studied and supplied the demand for cheap, low quality goods and were able to offer- lower rates of freight by German ships than British merchants could by British lines. German merchants studied the natives, their language, habits, etc., more closely than British merchants did and made a point of acquiring personal acquaintance with their customers which enabled them to offer with safety longer credits than their rivals could do with safety and profit. British merchants were satisfied with the snug businesses which they possessed and had fallen into the habit of basing their trading on Manchester goods alone. Mr. Lloyd advised British merchants to aim at more general trading and he also offered suggestions as to improvement in methods and for extension of British enterprise in particular directions. British merchants did not by any means endorse all Mr. Lloyd’s conclusions and, anyhow, little or nothing was done. 11. Mr. Lloyd visited Mesopotamia again in 1916 and his later inquiries led him to the belief that British trade had suffered rapid delay in the interval. Inroads had been made, in his opinion, not only into the subsidiary ^ trades in which British energies were occupied but also into the staple industries, especially Manchester goods, iron and steel, etc., which were regarded as the impregnable fortresses of the British trade position. Mr. Lloyd pointed out that in the short space of ten years, the Germans had succeeded in wresting practically the whole of the sugar traffic, formerly exclusively in British hands, from the British lines, and were making serious attacks upon much of the general traffic formerly emanating from Great Britain. Mr. Lloyd described in detail the “through rate system” which worked in conjunc tion with rate agreements, was the chief weapon of German competitive policy, and he summed up his argument by saying that the activities at Lie Germans in the past few years had had the result of ruining and jeopardis ing the British position in Mesopotamia and on the river waterways which carried the British Central Persian trade. Mr Lloyd’s conclusions in regard to Mesopotamia are mainly based upon the fact that the German tonnage entering Basrah in 1913 amounted to 55 140 as against 30,948 in 1912, while German returns showed imports as valued at £1,957,489 in 1913 as compared with £528,415 m i912. There is no means of checking the German figures of imports, but a consi derable fraction of the total probably represented material tor the Baghdadrailway and it is doubtful whether Mr. Lloyd is correct in surmising that the sugar trade, which was carried in German ships and represented an import value of £450,000, together with the general trade of the Germans, would show a total import not greatly inferior to the total of British imports exclusive of India. In any case, it is somewhat misleading to exclude India. The Manchester cotton trade represented £1,200,000 out of a total import of £3,099,273. British import trade on the whole held a very strong position in Mesopotamia right up to the beginning of the war, though it is no doubt true that the Germans had developed many branches of imports, which, if Conditions had been different, might easily have been worked by British merchants. As regards exports, Mr. Lloyd states that the Basrah Trade Beport of 1912 shows that 80,000 tons of grain w r ere shipped by the Germans to Ham burg and Antwerp as against 90,000 tons to London. Mr. Lloyd has, however, apparently taken the figures of 1911 instead of those for 1912 and the actual statistics for the latter year show that 67,300 tons w r ere exported to Hamburg and Antwerp as against 92,700 tons to London. In 1913, w r hich was a bad year, 20,350 tons w r ent to London as against 4,800 tons to Hamburg and Antwerp. So that the situation w r as not as bad as he imagined. Briefly stated, the position seems to have been that, while German com merce owing to special assistance given by the Government, was able to cause a great deal of inconvenience and even loss to British merchants, yet British trade and shipping were easily able to maintain the great advantage which centuries of commercial supremacy in the Gulf had conferred upon them. 12. A report by the French Chamber of Commerce in China indicates that a close parallel to the Mesopotamian situation existed in that country also. German imports and exports, which were respectively 14 million Taels and 7 million Taels in 1908, had increased to 28 million Taels and 17 million Taels in 1913, while although French exports stood at the satisfactory figure of nearly 41 million Taels in 1913, their imports had risen only from 2 J million Taels to 5 J million Taels. German progress is ascribed by the French Chamber to the fact that German merchants suited their manufactures to the demands of the local population for inferior goods and took steps to produce the exact article required by their customers. German firms, also, realising that clients were disinclined to order goods on the strength of catalogues, attracted orders by arranging for the exhibition of samples of wares marketed by groups of firms in a 'common ? depot, the expense, which was beyond the means of ordinary traders, being shared among the firms and assistance feeing given, if necessary, by the German Government. German trade was also pushed by expert advertisement, by the creation of training schools, and by the grant of liberal terms for the develop ment of industrial schemes, subject to the condition that the materials should be bought from German firms. German efforts were also materially aided by ! the fact that their local representatives had a good working knowledge of the vernacular. French methods are stigmatised as unsuitable and attention is drawn to the faulty organisation of the firms, their lack of initiative, their in adequate acquaintance with the conditions of the market, and their insufficient _ knowledge of the vernacular. The export of grain and seed produce was practically a German monopoly which was gained and held by the secret system of rebates to German shippers, as in Mesopotamia. The French Chamber I complains bitterly of the irregular itineraries of the French merchant marine and points out that direct transport is bound to replace transport by tranship ment everywhere in the future. Great stress is laid on the necessity for regular sailings and direct transport by French merchant marine after the war °as a means of regaining lost trade. 13. The parallel between China and Mesopotamia in respect of German enterprise will end, however, with the conclusion of the war. It is true that, even if the Besolutions of the Paris Conference are brought into effect and German trade and shipping is excluded from the Gulf for a period of years, yet Germany will in the long run get back her trade and will become again a great industrial country. Commercial currents will sweep away and level down tem porary artificial barriers raised by sentiment, just as the sentiment itself, bitter and uncompromising as it may be to start with, will fade and becomeineffective in the light of a new generation’s need and aspirations. Ex pediency and self-interest will weave afresh the old economical and industrial ties. Our position in Mesopotamia will, however, be absolutely differentiated from the sphere of trade competition in China owing to the administrative hold which we shall have upon the country. The policy now being worked out for ( the protection of British trade in India will presumably be applied in Mesopotamia and will form a stout protection. At the same time, the political danger will not have been entirely eliminated, and it is, therefore, incumbent upon us to realise and profit by the lessons of the past while preparing ourselves at the same time to take full advantage of the great commercial possibilities of the country. 14. It is probable that the disparity between British and German com’ British and German mercial methods to which attention was drawn by Mr. Lloyd and the existence metilod8 of which in a greater or less degree cannot be gainsaid, must be ascribed partly at least to deep-seated racial causes. Every German was drilled by his Gov ernment to fill his appointed place in the vast machine which evolved and controlled the political and commercial destinies of his country. He was willing, nay fanatically ready, to dedicate his whole being to the great enterprise which he hoped would win world dominion for his country and rich rewards for him self. Merchant, official and ship-owner all played their,part in the trade struggle through which Germany hoped to secure political paramountcy. In England, on the other hand, the individual is always slow to adapt himself to any kind of organisation and he is generally unmoved by the idea or conception underlying the particular function which he is performing. He does not seek to correlate his own activities with the manifestations of his country’s commercial or political development and in the conduct of his trade he obeys the promptings of his own interest or predilections. While quite willing to sacrifice his comfort for his duty’s sake, he retains a firm hold on his leisure and his amusements, and he has strongly marked 'ideas as to his private rights vis-a-vis his employer or his Government. In the Gulf, in particular, German employes were content to live for their work and to find in it their recreation and hobby as well as their business, while the Englishman, whether merchant or official, had learned from experience that recreation in the form of sport was essential for the mainten ance of his health and the efficient performance of his duties. The Germans wnuld perhaps have realised this also, had the test extended over a longer period. 15. It cannot be denied that the German inspiration created a high standard of business efficiency and, if we wish to rival German trade enterprise in the future, we must hope that our business men will be inoculated with Some of those qualities which built tip the marvellous structure of German commerce all over the world. Their educational system doubtless had a good deal to do with it and great changes are, it is believed, about to be introduced in England in this respect. Enough has been said, however, to indicate that the shortcomings pointed out by Mr. Lloyd were not pecu liar to the individuals and firms engaged in British trade in Mesopotamia and the Persian Gulf. The Beport of the French Chamber claims precisely similar failings for French merchants and the explanation is that German business methods were more thorough and efficient before the war than those of any other nation. The whole question will doubtless come under general review in England, and it is to be confidently anticipated that the new spirit of earnestness which will animate the Empire generally and British manu facture and trade in particular after the war will result in greater efficiency of production and distribution, and a more scientific and practical system of commercial intelligence. So far as Mesopotamian trade is concerned, recriminations, whether justified or not, would serve no useful purpose. A new era will set in after the war and many robust and enterprising firms both English and Indian will invade the markets keen to grasp a share of the rewards that await properly directed enterprise. 16. For the guidance of intending British competitors, stress may, Suggestions for however, be laid on a few special maxims. In the first place, strong, com- petent and well paid staffs must be provided, and all Europeans sent to v rk IK1 * ILe ° a3 “ in the Gulf, as a preliminary, must have a sound business training in England10 and also a grounding, it possible, in colloquial knowledge of the Arabic and Persian languages. The attainment of a reasonable standard of colloquial efficiency after arrival in the country should be the first step to increase of pay above the minimum. The locally recruited clerk is of very little use for anything but purely routine work and every important firm should have one or two young assistants in training in addition to the staff normally required to run the business. Messrs. Wonckhaus had a constant supply of young men living at headquarters who received a thorough training by passing through the various departments of the business and were then available for despatch to newly opened centres. Again, in the case of British, firms controlled from England, it is of the greatest importance that the responsible heads should periodically visit the Gulf in person and ascertain for themselves the changing possibilities of the situation. Local representatives should also be invested with the fullest possible powers of initiative, and it should be realized that liberal salaries are a sound investment in view of the conditions of life in Mesopotamia and of the possibilities of the trade. Next, it must be remembered that the best means of creating a demand for British goods is by letting the public see them and choose what they want; in other words, by imitating the German system remarked on by the Prench Chamber of Commerce. The experiment of sample rooms in British Consulates has been tried and has failed miserably. It is bound to fail unless under very exceptional conditions because no Consul or commercial intelligence officer can successfully combine the functions of a commercial traveller with his official duties, and because Persian merchants of any position regard it as beneath their dignity to go to a foreign Consulate to look at samples. With a view to the influx of British merchants, hotels will be required at Basrah and Baghdad and it would seem desirable that, when the right moment arrives, Government should afford assistance by arranging for convenient sites. In smaller centres, dak bungalows will suffice for the present. 17. Catalogues and price lists in English are useless in a foreign market unless they are explained personally by an agent. British firms would do well to insist on their representatives travelling regularly up-country in order to make themselves better acquainted with trade possibilities, to get in touch with produce centres and to gain ideas for the manufacture of new articles to suit local tastes and as improved substitutes for articles locally made. No purely British firm has hitherto successfully carried on the piece-goods trade in Meso potamia and nearly all orders are executed by firms established in Manchester or elsewhere who, having a strong element of Baghdad Jew in their composi tion, are in a position to acquire an excellent knowledge of local conditions and requirements. Such firms do not manufacture but simply buy finished pro ducts on account of orders received. In order to compete for business in Mesopotamia, it is essential for home firms to supply the class of goods needed in the country and to avoid the error of consistently trying to force goods which meet with little or no demand. An important factor is that goods must be made up in an attractive finish although of poor quality. The wearing qualities of an article are of minor importance to the purchaser. The Arab, like all other orientals, is anxious to buy the cheapest article which will serye his purpose and will not prefer more expensive English articles though they may be of superior quality. If German and Austrian or other foreign cheap goods are permitted to enter Mesopotamia after the war, they will undoubtedly continue to be preferred by the Arab who has no sentimental motive for buy ing finer English goods. The manufacture of cheap goods need not neces sarily imply any lowering of business honesty but connotes an adaptability and readiness to study the market which has hitherto been discouraged by the con servative attitude of British manufacturers. They continue in long-established ways and are slow to appreciate the fact that rapid changes which are a feature of modern demand necessitate constant study of markets especially in countries which are being newly developed. Birmingham has the reputation of being a centre for the production of cheap goods and there is no reason why it should not grasp the market which has hitherto been monopolised by the Continent in this direction. Continental manufacturers no doubt had an advantage owing to the comparative cheapness of their labour but an advant ageous milky for the production of cheap goods might be found in India where11 labour is cheap, provided that the industries could be started and invariably controlled by competent managers from firms of high standing in England. Without European supervision such experiments would probably fail. 18. In the piece-goods market, attention must be given to samples, trade marks, etc. Samples sent to this market must be neatly packed, with full information regarding prices, size of material, weight, range of patterns and colours, together with information as to terms of sale and delivery, all quoted in the language of the country. Trade marks must be those which appeal to the populace and preferably of eastern design and origin. Home firms must be prepared to give facilities in the way of credit, and be able to correspond in Arabic. In packing goods for the Gulf market, attention should be directed to the probable final destination of the goods and the facility existing for handling the goods on arrival there. Eor instance, in certain classes of goods for, say, distant parts of A rabia and Persia, they must not exceed a certain gross weight, as the packages have to be carried by camels or mules, etc. More detailed information under special heads of import and export is given later. 19. Eor the provision of commercial intelligence, it is desirable that an Commercial officer should be appointed at the earliest possible date to act as Commercial Iutdli s ence - Adviser in the occupied territories. The function of such an Adviser would be to provide information regarding labour, rates of wages, hours of work, movements of trade, fluctuations in demand for particular kinds of goods, changes in the tastes, or in the habits of the people as affecting the demand for imported articles, information relating to communications and transport, the opening of new trade routes, returns of the names of British and native merchants and firms engaged in business, and the nature of their business, the state and prospects of agriculture, including improvement in methods, changes in culti vation and character of seasons, and, lastly, competition from foreign goods. It appears particularly important that such an expert should be appointed as soon as possible and that he should collect detailed information under particular heads with a view to the preparation of a series of monographs on the principal items of import and export. He should also make a special study of the best method of preparing trade statistics for the country. 20. It is notorious that the figures given in the Basrah and Baghdad Trade Reports in the past were unreliable, and they could hardly be otherwise since no statistics worthy of the name were maintained by the Turkish Customs authorities. Data for the annual Trade Report had to be gathered laboriously by examination of the manifests of ships and by despatching a commission agent into the bazar to ascertain by inquiry from the merchants the extent of trade passing through their hands. In regard to imports by the Hamburg- America Line, entire dependence had to be placed upon figures furnished by the Germans. The periodical returns now compiled by the Basrah Customs provide information as to the aggregate value of consignments from each foreign country concerned but they do not show details as to the quantities and trade descriptions of the goods. In regard to the improvement of data and statistical information, it is recommended:— ( 1 ) that the trade statistics should be compiled in conformity with the Persian method in use at other Gulf Ports, i.e.y from March 21st to March the 21st which corresponds roughly to the Indian official year, and ( 2 ) that the statistics should be based on tonnage as well as on value, since tonnage can be traced inland easily, while values are elusive when the goods have once passed the port of entry. In order to produce monthly or annual returns of trade at Basrah on a simplified model of the Indian statistical returns, the Collector of Customs would need extra staff, and the appointment of an appraiser would be essential in order to check the details of description of goods and or weights and units of quantity as well as particulars of country of consignment. Eoreign goods exported to the Gulf from an Indian port under drawback should be carefully /12 &gt;r shewn as “ foreign ” and not under the head of “Indian” as frequently in the past. It would he difficult for any Customs Department to collect statistics of all small shipments of foreign goods re-exported, for example, between Bombay and Basrah, since it must often happen that orders for miscellaneous assortments of goods comprise both foreign and British goods, but it is of great importance that, so far as possible, merchandise emanating from any particular country, other than British, which is re-exported from Indian ports to the Persian Gulf should not be described as “ Indian.” 21 . Statistical evidence should be systematically collected in regard to the position and distribution of trade in the interior. Such information is of great value as enabling the permeation of British trade into the interior markets to be gauged and compared, either with foreign trade from other directions or with its own volume and dispersion in previous years. The maintenance of a record of total weights of goods and numbers of packages forwarded up-country would provide an approximate estimate of the proportion of each class of imports travelling inland and would indicate the direction of the flow of trade. In up-country centres the simplest method of obtaining such a record would be by employing enumerators of transport animals entering and leavine the principal centres by the main routes. 22 . ^ The Indian Chamber of Commerce at Bombay have made an interesting suggestion that an Indian assistant, or attache, should be appointed to the stafl: or the Cominercial Adviser for Mesopotamia with a view to representing the point of view of Indian mercantile opinion and to maintain touch in particular with the Indian Chambers of Commerce. This suggestion appears to have much to recommend it and it is understood that it is already under the consideration of the Government of India. Tnv v 1 ' ^ iS - h - a r d1 ?. necessa , r y to emphasise the fact that the inefficiency of the tra* bctorf tte Turkish administration was largely to blame for the undeveloped state of the country The administrative system was bad in principle, apart from the incompetence of the personnel. Land taxes which were farmed, were mostly levied m kind and opportunities were afforded for exaction and bribery J ustice was hardly obtainable and there was little security for life or property.' ihe first and most essential condition for the commercial development of the country is the enforcement of order and the establishment of a settled adminis- tration This condition has already to a large extent been fulfilled in the Basrah Vilayat and there is every hope that it will also be fulfilled in the Baghdad Vi lay at at no distant date. The maladministration was, however, not the only reason for trade stagnation. Before the war, Mesopotamia was in a com- mercial backwater. Its trade was of no more than local importance and the requirements of the Khamqm route to Persia governed the situation. Imports except of the essential piece-goods, were small and there was no immediate likelihood of an increased demand, since exports were not available to pay for it. Manufactures were insignificant and agriculture was in a very backward condition, owing to the deterioration of the rivers, coupled witi scarcity of labour and insecurity of life and property. cnltlrrT ° f trade Mesopotamia must depend primarily upon agri cultural development ana the resources and possibilities of the country 8 in CMef pThtLi a f!ffll 0r rT^t exa .miuation. _ The Army Commander and^the A-il', Tohtical Officer did not consider it advisable, in the conditions obtaining Vilavnt n, ‘he Commission should extend their tour into the Baghdad Si “Ab%“h w s J r.s‘:' a “ 1 w “ ““ 24.

Much damage is caused to cultivation by the breaking of the dykes at high hood. The tribes are divided into cultivators of wheat, barley and millet, and cultivators of nee. The date plantations, which require regular irrigation, are located along the banks of the Shatt-al-Arab and along the Euphrates from Nasiriya to Qurna. The accompanying map indicates roughly the extent of the gram producing areas. 25. The main products of the Vilayat are dates, rice, wheat, barley, millet, melons, vegetables and fruit. Dates have hitherto formed the most valuable item of export and may he considered to be ^Y^Lteareas under in the country. The annual revenue actually collected on date areas, under present conditions, approximates roughly about 12 lakhs, and another 3 la should he collected in the Suk-esh-Sheyukh district under more settled con ditions. A revision of the existing settlement would probably enable the date revenue to be raised to 20 lakhs, and, assuming this to represent one-fitth of the total average annual value of the date crop, tota J sellino . pric e may be estimated at rupees one crore per annum If the average sellmg piice of dates is taken at Rs. 5 per Basrah maund, the total weight of dates would be about two million maunds, of which output about halt ke wgaicltd available for foreign markets, the remainder c ^sumec _ y countries bordering on Lower Mesopotamia Or, taking to represent roughly the annual tax on five trees, t he f no sh n °' ld trees in existence in Lower Mesopotamia and about 100,000 acres oi more under dates, which, on an average of one quarter maund per tr^, won d produce 2,500,000 mannds. The export of dates was valued at £582,074 in 1913 and this should represent, at Rs. 5 a maund, 1,740,000 maunds, vhich, assuming that half the produce is exported, would give a to ^ ” | ^ million maunds. The normal output is, however, adversely affected by floods and draughts and it is probably rfot safe to assume a larger average annual crop than 2,500,000 maunds, but there is ample room for further expansion the P area under dates to meet any prospective increase in the world s demand for such food. The foreign market for dates is at present catered for mainly in the Basrah and Qurna area which sends its Khadrawis and Halawis and Sairs to England and America, other European countries and Austiaiia, an its Sairs and other inferior descriptions to India, Africa and tne Red nea14 ports. The Lower Euphrates basin appears to cater largely for the local Arab market, that is to say, the nomads of the desert and the inhabitants of the grain area on the Gharraf and Tipper Euphrates, but also sends down con siderable supplies to Easrah for export. The other date producing areas such as Amarah, Qalat Saleh, etc., barely suffice for local supply. Sir William Will- cocks has pointed out that the fortune of Mesopotamia would be made if dates could be popularised as an article of diet among Chinese, and enterprise might well be directed to fostering a taste for dates in the Chinese market. If the Australian and New Zealand duty on dates which, it is believed, amounts to as much as Id. and a lb., respectively, could be reduced, a greatly increased sale might result. Mr. Lloyd remarked that a new market for dates appeared to be forming in Tunis and Oran and it is possible that considerable development might occur in the Levant if conditions were favourable for the import of dates. - 26. After dates, rice is the most important crop in Lower Mesopotamia. The main rice growing centres are the southern portion of the Amarah district at the tails of the large canals issuing from the Tigris on both sides and the Sukesh-Sheyukh district at the point where the Euphrates empties itself into the Hammar and Sannaf Lakes. Though primarily grown for home con sumption rice is increasingly exported and 67,000 tons were loaded at Basrah in 1912, but fluctuations in the water-supply affect the crops seriously. It is difficult to form any accurate estimate of the area under rice until a regular survey is undertaken. The Turkish system of large lump sum revenue demands on tracts producing both barley and rice renders it difficult to apportion the amount of revenue derived from each crop. Again, the outturn of an acre of rice or barley is unknown and the people themselves have the vaguest ideas of units and measurements and crop yields, estimates given by them showing yields of as much as 4 tons of rice per acre and 2 tons of barley. In any case the yield of rice is very heavy, and the rice tribes are by far the wealthiest. At a very rough estimate based on assessment under Turkish rule, the area under rice might be put at 100,000 acres in the Basrah Yilayat, the total yield being about 195,000 tons. The estimate must, however, be accepted with the greatest caution. The demand for rice and paddy is likely to increase and the export should form an increasingly valuable item in the trade of Basrah. 27. The total area under wheat, and millet within the Basrah Vilayat may be put down roughly at 50,000 acres, of which at least three-fifths would be under millet, the latter being grown mostly on the open lands on the banks of the river where the floods reach far enough to moisten the earth and recede early enough to allow of sowing, wffiile wheat is grown both on open lands which are dry enough to admit of sowing before the advent of rain and which remain clear of floods sufficiently long to admit of harvesting, and under the shade of the date palms along the Euphrates and the Shatt-al-Arab. The greater part of the wheat exported from Basrah came from beyond the borders of the Vilayat and the wheat trade may be said to have been mainly in the hands of the Baghdad firms. The rival claims of rice and dates and the un- cel tainty of canal irrigation and the scanty rainfall militated against the growing of wheat to any great extent in the Basrah Yilayat, though if the Tib and Dawairij areas were once more brought under irrigation as proposed below, a great increase in produce would result. It may be assumed that about 20,000 acres were under wheat cultivation in the Basrah Vilayat before the war. Bar ey probabiy accounted for 70,000 acres, millet for 30,0o0 and vegetables tor - 0 ) 000 , the total cultivation being about 349,000 acres. The wheat was no , generally speaking, of first class quality and was used mainly for mixing with sorter wheat. The barley was of better quality, but its reputation in the market sutrered badly from the high percentage of dirt which it contained and w, :Ch was deliberately added by the growers. The export of grain was handi capped by the iaet that, ow ing to the lowness of water in the Tigris and Hai ii\ ers m summer and autumn, much of the newly harvested crop could not be brought down to Basrah in native boats until the following spring. Careless storage during the autumn months was responsible for deterioration of the grain which gave it a bad name in European markets. The grain growing capabilities of Upper Mesopotamia are described in Mr. Lloyd’s report, and / IA V 15 the Commissioners have not, in the circumstances, been able to obtain any fresh information on the subject. 28. Eruit and vegetables, except in the immediate neighbourhood of large towns such as Basrah and Amarah, etc., were, before the war, cultivated only to the extent of the needs of tenants and owners and were treated as an entirely negligible quantity, being neither assessed to revenue by Government nor to rent by owners who were usually content to accept in lieu of rent such presents in kind as their tenants were able or willing to make them. A vegeta ble tax was collected by Government on all vegetables brought to market in the big towns and owners insisted on the payment of a share of vegetables and fruit grown in gardens within easy reach of markets, but elsewhere fruit and vegeta bles were not taken seriously as agricultural assets of the country. Things changed rapidly with the British occupation and every effort was, and is still being made with very satisfactory results to stimulate vegetable production in all parts of Mesopotamia for the benefit of our troops, considerable areas now being under vegetable cultivation throughout the occupied territories, though it is impossible to hazard an estimate of the total area so affected. There will doubtless be in the future still further extension of areas under fruit trees, and vegetable cultivation on a large scale has come to stay, but the former, mostly grown in the shade of the date trees, will not affect other agricultural operations, while the areas under vegetables will never seriously curtail the extent of lands under grain and other crops. 29. The method of cultivation of the spring crops, barley and wheat, is capable of considerable improvement. There is only one very light ploughing, the ground is never properly broken up and the upturned soil is never exposed to the sun and air for any length of time, although such exposure is a most important factor in the fertility of the soil. Moreover, the practice of waiting for the first fall of rain before sowing must often result in the seed being put into the ground much later than is proper thus missing a great part of the effects of the first rain. Wheat and barley are often sown as late as the 1 st of March. If the ploughing and sowing could take place without fail say, in the third week of October, the seed would begin to germinate immediately the first rain fell. The reason why this is not done in many places seems to be that the population is not sufficient to look after both the rice crops and the spring crops. The wheat and barley tribes migrate to the rice tracts at harvest,, with their cattle and do the w r ork of reaping and threshing and go on after* wards with their cattle to plough their spring crop. Thus, until reaping and threshing of the rice is concluded about the end of December, there are no means of preparing the wheat and barley lands. If motor ploughs could be utilized, the soil would be much more thoroughly turned up quite early in the season, its fertility being much increased thereby. It would be ready for sowing at the very first shower of rain and the seed would probably gain /two or three weeks of cool weather. With a view to the improvement of existing methods generally, there is urgent need for the institution of an Agricultural Department. The rice grown is of a coarse quality and only one crop is raised each year. Experimentation might produce valuable results in regard to this and many other crops which are suitable to Mesopotamia. One of the first requirements of the country is to devise a system for getting rid of the salt which occurs in many places and which renders otherwise arable land uncul- tivable, and the Agricultural Department should devote careful study to this point. • 30. In the second place, agriculture has suffered heavily hitherto from the uncertainty of the cultivators’ tenure. Under former conditions the Sheikhs themselves held most of the land from the Crown on leases for not more than five years while those beneath them were usually tenants-at-will and w T ere ruthlessly exploited, so that all concerned with the land took what they could out of it and put nothing into it. There was a chain of excessive and purely nominal values and rents, arrears and extortion, from the Sheikh down to the lowest cultivator. When tenants do not remain more than a year in one place there is no proper system of fallowing, the ground is badly cultivated, no trees are planted and wild trees are not even permitted to grow This general state ment does not, however, apply to the narrow strips of palm groves and gardens near the towns. / T716 Irrigation yoss-bilities. SI. The handling and financing of the grain crops might be greatly improved. The bulk of the purchases of grain destined for shipment are made in Basrah, but after the war conditions should be such as to permit British firms to purchase at the centres of growing and to carry out the processes of cleaning packing, etc., near such centres. Efforts should be directed to the improvement of the quality of crops raised and to the prohibition of adulteration of the grain with dirt. 32. But our greatest hopes for the future of Mesopotamia are founded upon its possibilities as a cotton producing country. Hitherto cotton has been culti vated chiefly in the plains irrigated by several small streams forming the river Eyala in the Khorasan Sanjaq and the Baghdad Vilayat. The approximate area was estimated at from 500 to 1,000 acres in small patches. Cotton was also grown at Anah on the Euphrates. Mr. Lloyd stated that Mesopotamian cotton had short staple but good strength and results showed the absence of proper cultivation. An attempt was made by a Jew near Baghdad to introduce a different quality of cotton from Egypt and India, but the experiment was not a success owing to the fact that the local cultivators were unable or unwilling to tend the plants in the manner required to grow on an extensive scale. The soils in the valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates fall within what may be called the “cotton belt” and examination of the climatic conditions indicates that, so far as the temperature is concerned, the region possesses the conditions necessary for the production of cotton. March is the most suitable month in which the planting should take place and it seems likely that the crop would come to speedy maturity. The finest cottons are grown in places where the temperature does not run so high as in Mesopotamia and where humidity is greater, but recent experiments have shown that good cotton can be grown in high temperatures and in dry atmosphere. There is reason to believe that by a system of selection, varieties eminently suitable to such districts could be secured which would produce high yield of excellent quality. Analyses of samples of soils from Mesopotamia indicate that from a chemical point of view they are suitable for cotton. The conclusion is that there is no reason why Egyptian cotton should not be produced in Mesopotamia. The Commissioners suggested that, in view of the prospective importance of Meso potamia as a cotton growing area, an expert from India should be deputed at once to conduct tests by sowing experimental plots in different localities with varieties of Egyptian, American and Indian seed. Unfortunately it was not found possible to arrange for the despatch of the expert from India in time for operations to be commenced this year, but it is understood that the tests will be made next year. 33. The Agricultural future of Mesopotamia is entirely dependent upon three conditions:— ( 1 ) the possibility of enormously extending the area under cultivation by creating irrigation systems on a scale analogous to those which in ancient times made the land so productive ; ( 2 ) the capacity of the inhabitants to undertake the heavy burden of work which the development of the country will involve; and ( 3 ) the improvement of means of communication. 34. The question of irrigation will be dealt with first. Sir William 'Willcocks in his report on the subject describes the Tigris-Enphrates delta as an arid region of some 12,500,000 acres, the only adequately irrigated portions of the area being— ( 1 ) the Delta of the Diyala; (2) the Lower Euphrates from N asiriyah to Suk-esh-Sheyukh; and (3) The Shatt-al-Arab. Sir William Willcocks’ investigations led him to believe that if the water- supply available can be properly utilised it will permit of the irrigation \•V \ 17 j i Y X * (a) Between Feluja and Baghdad, Babylon and Bajhaila. (b) The Hai Branch of the Tigris. (c) The country between Basrah and Jubair, (d) The country round the Hindia Branch of the Euphrates. (e) The country between Beled and Baghdad on the right bank of the Tigris. (/) The Nahrwan Canal. Vide Appendix VI. of 7,150,000 acres of winter crops, and of summer crops 1,000,000 acres of rice or 3,125,000 of millet, sesame, cotton, etc. Sir W illiam selects six * tracts as specially favourable for irrigation schemes. But as both the rivers are liable to heavy and sudden floods which inundate the country, he considers that special and very expensive works will also be necessary to provide escapes for the surplus waters. He estimates the total cost of the irrigation and agricultural works at £T.29,105,020 and he anticipates that the net annual return to Govern ment after deducting maintenance charges will be £T.l,371,000, repre senting a return of 9 per cent, on the outlay on the irrigation works only. Sir William’s estimates of cost are necessarily somewhat rough and ready, since he has arrived at them by first adding to the probable cost of each project, one-third for contingencies and then doubling the figure to allow for interest on the money spent and subsequent development. Further, it is very doubtful whether his anticipations as to the probable returns from the newly irrigated country will prove to be adequate in the light of the fuller information now in process of collection as to the outturn of the land and the conditions of tenure. If cultivators were available in unlimited numbers to take up and work all newly irrigated land, his expectations would probably prove to be much below the mark. But the population question, to which we shall refer later, will necessarily have an important bearing on the problem of the resto ration of Mesopotamia. 35. But it is by no means certain that if the expedients suggested by Sir Reasons for the William Willcocks were adopted, they could be relied upon to restore the lost ^f® r B lordtion of the regime of the rivers on sound and permanent lines. In the case of the Tigris and Euphrates, whatever may have been the cause, we know that the streams have changed their original beds, have discharged their flood waters into low r -lying areas which were converted into great swamps to the detriment of cultivation and then, after laying waste the country, have return to their original beds or have carved out new ones. The marshes originally caused by the obstructed drainage have, however, been perpetuated with the result that the rivers have been disintegrated and agriculture has been ruined. In the case of the Euphrates, the most note~ worthy examples of the deterioration of the river’s course are seen in tho case of the Hindia Branch and in the formation of the network of channels round about the Hammar Lake. So long as existing conditions continue, there appears to be no hope of the Euphrates ever establishing itself in a definite channel because as soo n as it starts to carve out a bed, the Arab attacks, it with his shovel and breaks it up. An instance of this can be seen in the case of the Umn-el-Nakla. Further instances of the process of disintegration are, as regards the Tigris, the Chahala, the Major Kabir and the Micheriya escapes, down any of which the Tigris, is likely to flow if uncontrolled. 36. The restoration of the regime of the rivers appears to involve a three- The problem of fold problem. Firstly, the successful but economical application of their waters re8toratlon ' for irrigation purposes; secondly, their preservation for navigation, which is and will be for a long time to come essential, and, thirdly, the drainage of the swamps now in existence. In the case of the larger Indian rivers which are canalised, we see that the irrigation, drainage and the maintenance of the river are in harmonious relationship. The river is not permitted to flow along the line of the canals and no vast marshes spelling widespread disaster, are created, the reason being that irrigation, drainage and the regime of the river are considered as mutually dependent and not as independent problems. In Mesopotamia, the phenomena suggest that irrigation has been permitted to exploit the river and drainage has been left to look after itself. 37. The Trade Commissioners do not presume to offer any opinion as to Immediate the lines on which it may eventually be considered desirable to find a solution of the difficulties which has to be faced and they merely venture at present to offer a warning as to the dangers involved in the hasty adoption of any large schemes of irrigation before a body of information has been measures.collected which may enable sound conclusions to be drawn. Irrigation projects only too^ often suffer from narrowness in the first conception and when once a scheme is decided on, it is extremely difficult to pass beyond its limits or to modify its character in order that it may harmonise with later conceptions. At the present stage, the Commissioners would strongly advise that at the earliest possible moment an Irrigation Board, comprising at least two highly qualified irrigation engineers should be constituted, for the collection of detailed infor mation in regard to the rivers and the existing canal systems, with a view to frame recommendations for the restoration of the regime of the rivers. Great stress must be laid upon the importance of devising irrigation schemes, in the first place so as to avoid, as far as possible, interference with existing rice culti vation, and in the second place so as to make extensive areas available for affor estation and for the pasturage of flocks and herds which should be one of the great assets of the country. 38. ^ The ^ Irrigation Board might also be empowered to sanction after proper investigation, any minor irrigation schemes which are not likely to prejudice solution of the main problem of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. The area between the rivers commanded by the Akhdhar Channel which took off from the Dujaila and watered the desert between the present southern hinterland of the Tigris and the Hai might easily again be brought under culti vation and would yield large harvests of wheat. The remains of great cities along the line of the Akhdhar testify to the ancient fertility of this tract. Again, it is believed, that there are several schemes capable of being undertaken in connection with streams which debouch from the Pusht-i-Kuh Hills, e.g., Mendeli, Tib, Dawairij, and which would not in any case prejudice larger undertakings. Some of such minor schemes could be financed out of local revenues and carried out by local unskilled labour under direction of competent engineers. They would pay their way within a few years and would enable valuable experience to be gained in the matter of settling tribes on the irri gated lands and in arranging for cultivation experiments. It may be mentioned that the Sheikh Ghadhban attempted to carry out the Hawairij scheme himself before the British occupation and very nearly succeeded. 39. It must be remembered, however, that all schemes for the agricultural development of Mesopotamia and the commercial exploitation of the country are conditioned and limited by the capacity, character and temperament Oo. the inhabitants. Agricultural regeneration can only be effected if labour is available, not only for the construction of huge irrigation works and for the excavation of canal systems but for the constant and exacting work upon the land, year in and year out, which the extension of cultivation will involve. Statistics as to the population of the Yilayats of Baghdad and Basrah are very unreliable in the absence of anything like a census but at a rough estimate there were before the war not more than a million and a half persons in these two Yilayats and the correct figure may be as low as 900,000. Taking the area of the two Yilayats at 108,000 square miles, this gives an average of nine inhabitants per square mile at the highest computation, a very scanty population for agricultural development. Moreover, the population is of a motley type including peoples of diverse races and religions, namely, Arabs, Kurds, Turkomans, Persians, Christians, Armenians, Jews, and others. Arabs are in the vast majority but they are unfortunately divided by intersecting lines of cleavage which greatly hinder combination and progress. The town dweller and the nomad or semi-nomad are hardly akin to one another whether in character or in interests, and locality again produces a strongly marked effect upon ^ different groups, such as, for instance, the marsh dwellers. The Kurds who inhabit the hills and the lower slopes possess even less capacity for combination than the Arabs since they have little tribal cohesion and are addicted to blood feuds. Christians and the Jews who are outnumbered by the Muhammadans in the ratio of ten to one are of small account politically but form a very important commercial element in the population. 40. The difficulty of generalising or dogmatising as to the capacity of such a people for rapid adaptation to changing environment is obvious. The inadequacy of numbers is, however, incontestable and the man power of the country will remain at a low ebb for some time to come.19 4 There does not, however, appear to be any urgent reason for haste in pouring colonists into Mesopotamia. It will not be possible to embark on large comprehensive schemes of irrigation for some years to come and the existing population supplemented by Lurs, numbers of whom are already settled round Baghdad and who are accepted by the Arab tribes without opposition, will be sufficient, to begin with, for the minor works which it may be decided to undertake. The Chaldaean inhabitants of Tal Kaif, for instance, used before the war, to travel as far afield as Adana in a dry year, in search of work. The child mortality is at present very heavy and under more enlightened condi tions with better sanitation it is to be expected that the population will increase by leaps and bounds. The pastoral population must be treated with special consideration, since apart from the great increase of wealth which their flocks and herds will bring to the country, it is they who, under prosperous conditions, will provide the healthy and rapidly multiplying stock which will once more repopulate the country. Irrigation schemes in Mesopotamia must be conceived so as to conserve for afforestation and pasturage large areas in addition to those under cultivation. As irrigation schemes develope, cultivators will also no doubt be attracted from outside and the marsh Arabs, who now largely subsist on fish which they catch and rice which they cultivate in small reclaimed areas, will tend to settle down and take to agriculture. Einally, recent developments in Europe have made it clear that manual labour will not have to undertake the sole responsibility for the development of cultivation in Mesopotamia. Success will depend greatly upon the extent to which earth-working and agricultural machinery can be introduced from the very start and worked under competent supervision by skilled labour. 41. The experience of the first few years after the conclusion of peace will afford valuable data for the elucidation of the population question, and it is therefore all the more important that no hasty and perhaps ill-advised action should be taken at the outset. When the tale of the wealth and peace of Mesopotamia goes abroad among the border peoples, there may be a steady infiltration from outside of useful and absorbable labour, and the Indian small merchant and shopkeeper pushing his way in fearlessly and unobtrusively, as he has done in many wild and fanatical spots in the Gulf, will give valuable aid in solving che problem. Eertility of soil, settled administration, facility of communications and, last but not least, the possession of pilgrim centres of great sanctity are all magnets to attract immigration, and nature may safely be trusted to find means of filling the vacuum if it is proved to exist. History shows many examples of the peaceful fusion of peoples set in a common envi ronment and the process will doubtless repeat itself in Mesopotamia, provided only that ill-feeling is not aroused at the outset by the expropriation of the Arab from his land. 42. Great stress should here be laid upon the organic connection which already exists between India and Mesopotamia. Bombay is felt, throughout Iraq, to be the nearest important centre of commerce and civilisation, and before the war the inhabitants of Basrah used to regard Bombay and Baghdad as equidistant. Indian interests are, however, chiefly engaged on account of the pilgrimage of British subjects and protected persons to the holy places. Besides the well-known Shiah shrines of Kadhimein, Kerbela and Nejef, there are Sunni places of pilgrimage such as the tombs of Abdul Qadir Gilani and the Imam Muazzam (Abu Hanifa), at Baghdad besides others near Basrah which exert a strong attraction. The inhabitants of Afghanistan are mostly Shiahs and will expect special facilities for their journeys to Iraq, Bohras have built a fine pilgrim hostel at Basrah, the “ Pir of Baghdad ” used to pay periodic visits to Delhi, and, lastly, the administration of the well-known Oudh Bequest has fostered the Indian attachment. Before the war, there were about 3,000 Indians resident in the Baghdad Vilayat alone, and the fact that they did not form a compact community but generally married Persian or Arab wives and rapidly assimilated themselves to their surroundings affords a happy omen for the future. 43. But the destinies of a nation depend not only upon the density of the population to the square mile but upon those qualities of intelligence, honesty' of purpose, constructive ability and capacity for sustained effort which governthe outturn of work The difficulty of generalising upon so complex a subiect as the character of the Arab has been referred to above, but competent observers before the war were on the whole inclined to doubt bis abilitv to Arab'as 0 * f fi hlS COun ^ ^elopment.

To take a characteristic instance, when the inhabitants of a fi e 000 mp Vlllage were , re 1 ceafcl y out in a search for spies, no fewer than G,( 00 men were counted of whom not more than 30 were of the fellah class ffiffiS i f T G t ct ? d with the trad e of the place and the remainder were d fficult to account for but were certainly not engaged in any active occupa- tion.

It can ^ d { ^ e f l ' V0Gder l ed at that commercial and agricultural development was stifled and that the Arab earned a reputation for apathy and conservatTsm WaSStlfled 44. The employment of Arab labour for military purposes on a laro-p onnip fo/wrk h O dThTfdloT dit ' 0n ? llas t . throw . n further U S ht °n the Arab’s capacity 101 work and the following instructive points have emerged ^ ^ (1) A considerable surplus of labour over and above that required at present for the tilling of the soil has been found to exist ( 2 ) This labour is of excellent quality and improves steadily under organization and control. • ^ uaaer If the demand for labour-is made with reasonable consideration for asrimnure 0 a ^iff P ° P e t and f ° r the fluctuatill g requirements of agriculture at different seasons, no unwillingness is shown in compiyingwflhit.

They say that the Arab cheeiful, uncomplaining and willing, and possesses a sense of humour. His (3)V V 21 v v outturn of work under proper supervision is superior to that of the average Indian cooly, especially when he is fired by a spirit of competition. Arabs are easy to handle if properly treated and so long as they have some authority over them to whom they can explain their grievances in their own language, and provided that scrupulous attention is paid to their tribal distinctions. 45. On the whole, the Arab must be regarded as an efficient workman commanding a high wage, but well worth it, ready to adopt and easily taught modern process. As regards his probable attitude towards work in peace time, there is much ground for hope in the fact that the Arab has a keen appreciation of money not merely for money’s sake, but in order to surround himself with the comforts which he appreciates. His standard of living is even novF high and is capable of being raised to a considerable extent. The sales in the bazars prove that the Arab appreciates luxuries which now for the first time have come within his reach, such as tea, biscuits, tinned fruit, European cigarettes and more expensive qualities of piece goods. As regards agricultural methods, the Arab although conservative, would be quick to perceive the labour-saving advantages of agricultural machinery and would welcome instruction in improved methods which might be likely to increase his outturn and expand his profits. The rapid reconstruction of river bunds which had long been out of repair and the very large extension of wheat cultivation round Qurna as the direct result of settled conditions in that neighbourhood, afford a good augury for the future. 46. The evolution of the Arab will depend largely upon the facilities for Education, education which may be provided by the new administration. The only regular schools maintained by the Turkish Education Department were a normal school for teachers at Basrah, a secondary school at Basrah, and three primary schools at Basrah, Ashar, and Abul Khasib. The maktahs or mosque schools were a negligible quantity so far as education was concerned. After the occupation, Arab parents were greatly desirous of English education for their children mainly for commercial purposes. Primary schools manned by teachers from the American Mission are now in existence in Zubair, in Basrah City and Abul Khasib, and between them they have a roll of not less than 220 pupils. The complete scheme of training in the Mission School at present embraces a ten years’ course, three years in the primary school, three in the middle, and four in the high school. In the high school, training has hitherto been given only on the lines of a normal school, that is to say, for the prepara tion of teachers but a beginning has also been made with commercial training, steps have been taken to introduce a department of pharmacy and it is inter ded also to add eventually a department of agriculture and possibly one for manual training. Stress may be laid upon the great importance of developing the existing commercial class and also of starting an experimental farm in connection with the agricultural department as soon as it is instituted. 47. We now turn to the third condition upon which the future agri- communications, cultural, and also the commercial, development of Mesopotamia depends, namely, the improvement of communications. The chief inlets for British trade into Mesopotamia and Eastern Asiatic Turkey are Basrah, Alexandretta and Trebizond. The Trebizond route will in the future presumably be controlled by Bussia and it cannot be expected that great advantages will be offered to British trade by this route. It is impossible to speculate at present as to the future of trade by the Alexandretta route. It is probable, how r ever, that for very many years to come British commercial interests in Mesopotamia at all events will be principally concerned with the Basrah inlet. The main current of British Imports draws through Basrah and Baghdad via Khanikin to the country round Kermanshah. The other main trade routes were (1) from Baghdad northwards to Mosul, which it does not fall within the province of the present report to discuss, ( 2 ) Baghdad to Kerbela and Hilla and (3) along the line of the Euphrates from the Shatt-al-Arab. The border towns of Zubair, Khamisia, and Samawah were small trade centres for the nomad Arabs.I 22 The development of navigation by the Tigris route to Baghdad will doubtless be the first object of Government’s solicitude, since transport by river over long distances will necessarily be far cheaper than transport by rail for a long time to come. It is unnecessary to describe the difficulties and disadvantages under which steamer traffic was carried on under the Turks, since the whole of the ancient grievances have now been swept away. The object for the future should be to institute, the moment the war comes to an end, a regular and frequent steamer service between Basrah and Baghdad affording reasonable freights and entirely in British hands. It would seem advisable that, in the first instance and for a considerable period of time to come, the main business of transport, both of passengers and goods, on the Tigris should be carried on by one company to be exclusively British in constitution and which should represent, so far as possible, the interests of the main British firms trading in Mesopotamia. The Company would have the opportunity of taking over at a valuation the whole of the plant and material of the existing Inland Water Transport which supplies the Army’s needs, and they would thus enter into possession of a going concern adapted to deal with a much greater volume of traffic than would probably be, in the first instance, available. The Company would have every inducement to carry out a forward policy and serve the needs of the public, but with a view to obviate the dangers inherent in a monopoly, it would seem desirable that Government, either by representation on the Board or by other means, should retain power to fix maximum freights and passenger rates to be charged by the Company. 13. Eventually, no doubt, the navigation of the Tigris will be prejudiced by the development of large irrigation systems, and it will be necessary to have in view measures which will prevent the serious interruption of water transport for some months each year. In every river utilised for the purpose of irrigation, navigation must necessarily be impeded, over certain stages of the river and during particular seasons of the year, owing to the development of sand banks and shoals, the only means of negotiating which is by expensive river training, Navigation canals afford a simple and effective means of overcoming this disadvantage, since there is a point on every river where it becomes cheaper to abandon the struggle against the encroaching sand bank and shoal and divert navigation into an artificial channel. Practical experience in India has demonstrated infallibly that irrigation canals cannot be used also for navigation since:— (1) The inevitable interruptions incidental to the maintenance of irrigation canals must always be very prejudicial to navigation. ( 2 ) The course of irrigation channels cannot be determined by transport requirements and, unless navigation by canal or river enables goods to be transported over a long distance and to some terminal emporium, the transhipment charges will act as a severe handicap in comparison with railway freights. (3) Irrigation canals must be run at a higher velocity than navigation canals in order to carry off the silt held in suspension and to pass the necessary supply. Navigation canals require to be as free from current as possible. Having regard to the tortuous nature of the river, the strength of the current, the probability of the formation of sand banks, etc., as irrigation requirements are met, and, lastly, the favourable nature of the soil for rapid excavation, it would seem desirable that plans should be taken in hand for canalising the river as far as possible along the worst stretches with a view to ensure the permanence of water transport, in spite of any deterioration that may be caused in consequence of irrigation. Navigation canals could, it is believed,^ be excavated at a high rate of speed by powerful suction dredgers v orkmg in closed channels, and in some cases existing channels might be made use of, such as, for instance, the Chahala Escape which is already navigable, it is believed, from Amara to Qalat Saleh and, when controlled with regulators and a l° c k, could probably be made navigable as far as Ezra’s Tomb, parallel with the Tigris.23 i»il . ortij ^raiJ sand H Tie 10 at i jiidatl» seea ae(o i tie all in sts of kre and inj’s r id to first out iate - int, trer ced iY0 ort m, nd &gt;* its lis s d a # 11 of rt ,68 ue re on iSS ee he on lid :or 3W ist is ;rs de !e, rs ,et 49. The alignment of the railways in the country will depend upon con ditions which cannot he foreseen at present. Tim paramount importance of constructing a railway between Baghdad and Khanikin at the earliest possible moment is indisputable. The distance is only 95 miles and a large accession both of passenger traffic and of export trade into Persia would result. Sir William Willcocks conceived of the following lines to secure the first 3,000,000 acres of land to be reclaimed:— (1) from Basrah to Amara along the Tigris, (2) from Amara to Hai, (3) crossing the Hai and along the old Nahr Melcha Canal to Baghdad via Ctesiphon, (4) by the desert route on the right bank of the Euphrates through Najef and Kerbela to Baghdad, (5) across the Euphrates Valley via Nasiriyah and Shatra to Hai. Bail way construction hitherto has been governed purely by military considera tions, but post-war developments will require most cautious consideration. It would seem desirable that before anything is done, a Communications Board should be constituted to work out schemes of communication for the country as a corporate whole, with a view to the co-ordination of traffic ^ by river, canal, rail and road so as to ensure that while reasonable competition^ exists there shall be no loss of power by duplication of facilities. Irrigation interests should also be represented on the Board since the direction of canal embank ments will be an important factor in the selection of alignments. The obiect to be kept in view is that carriage of produce of the country shall be facilitated and that each productive area shall be tapped by whatever system is best adapted to the nature of the country. Bailways, in the first instance, will doubtless be through the best populated areas of the country, that is to say, along the river banks, but the through route between important towns will eventually be shortened by means of chord lines which will be^ made through areas where development proceeds most rapidly. Eeeder lines will be con structed as circumstances may dictate. When once a comprehensive scheme of communications has been worked out and sanctioned, the carrying out of each form of enterprise by rail, road or water should be left to its natural development, since it would not be possible for any Board to reconcile and control the conflicting interests of the Companies to which the exploitation of each form of enterprise is committed. 50. Boads will not play a great part in the opening up of Mesopotamia, partly because in Iraq land routes are subordinate to the waterways owing to the difficulties of movement in a country covered with marshes, lagoons, nliga tion cuts and areas liable to inundation, partly because road metal is at present procurable only with the greatest difficulty and partly because of the simplicity and ease with which railways can be constructed across the flat plains. Boads, however, will be useful in some areas to connect grain producing tracts with railway or canal, for the export of produce and for the transit of the post. Tribal responsibility for the up-keep and protection of such roads could easily be enforced. 51. The most important of the wild or natural products of the country are gallnuts, liquorice and gum tragacanth. Mr. Lloyd dealt fully these m his report. The liquorice business was almost entirely in the hands ot an American firm and the trade seems to have been subject to great fluctuations owing to manipulation of the American market. It is believed that liquorice is not produced in large quantities anywhere else than in Mesopotamia and there is no reason why British merchants should not at least have a share m the business. There seems to be special promise of the development of a dried fruit industry, since the excellent figs, apricots and plums which are already grown would with a little care in drying probably command far higher prices than they at present fetch. Superior varieties could probably be introduced by agricultural experts. The oranges grown in Upper Mesopotamia are of a fine and sound quality and there should be a ready market for the fruit whic Economic possibilities of Mesopotamia.is ripe by December and could be steadily exported for at least two months. Ihe grapes grown are excellent and it is advised that investigation should be made by experts in regard to the possibility of the production of a wine grape. Similarly it is of importance that the possibility of sugar manufacture from a locally grown beet or sugarcane should be ascertained. Tobacco, which is grown^ in certain localities only, might be widely extended under expert supervision. r Tree planting on river banks, if only for the production of firewood, should be taken m hand at the earliest possible moment and a forest officer should be deputed to discover suitable species by experiment and to select localities for irrigated plantations. 52. Wool forms the^ most considerable non-agricultural product of the country Mr Lloyd has, in his report, described the various kinds of wool and the methods of dealing in this article. Sheep find permanent pasturage in the coiUi and seasonal grazing all over the steppes. A reference has been made above to the extreme importance of conserving large areas for pasture, since sheep rearing is the principal occupation of the semi-nomad and nomad tribes. Ihe nomad keeps sheep, firstly to supply himself with milk, butter milk, etc., and to a lesser extent with meat and, secondly, in order that by selling the wool ^ and hides he may purchase in exchange, piece-goods, rice, flour, tea” etc. it is impossible to make any reliable estimate of the number of sheep in the ag dad Vilayat, and in the Basrah Vilayat a very rough computation puts the total at two millions. It may safely be said that the possibilities of sheep arming m Mesopotamia are prodigious, since not only the wool but also the skips are known and approved in European markets and the quality could doubtless be raised considerably, if expert knowledge were available. The cattle ot the country are not numerous and are mostly of stunted growth milch cattle giving very little milk. Cattle will not be a valuable item in Mesopo- tammn assets until proper breeding operations are taken in hand The buftaloes which are found in the marshy tracts are of good class, their milk and flesh being highly appreciated and their hides being also valuable.

This trade, which m India was formerly in the hands of the Germans is now the subject of investigation in that country, and the conclusions which are arnved at will have special application to Mesopotamia. The recent discovery that India s natural resources can be utilised for the production of tannin m very large quantities will have important results. 53. Other economical assets of the country are salt, g?/psum -fish coal nil and cower. A considerable portion of the alluvial plain of Lower Mesopotamia is of a more or less saline character. The inhabitants are now permftted to codect as much salt as they require for their own use and ttunGove-nment monopoly is restricted to the working of the salt beds for the supply of the ^hilP t^ W p There are Salt wells at Khami sia and Suk-esh-Skeyukh ^ hile the Persian hills appear to contain strata of rock salt which may renav working later on. The gypsum which is found in the Shamiya S along one line of the Basrah-Nasinah Bailway is apparently of poor quality but is capable of utilisation for cement for building. Expert examination's neces- _aiy, however, before any decision can be reached regarding the value of the deposits As regards fish, the rivers appear to contain”inexhaustible supplies and the catch is doubtless, capable of 1 indefinite expansi^ if better r^!n°i ds Q f saltin ,£ and preserving can be devised and if fresh markets can be ft S® ams (M eoal are re p or t e( t at various places in Northern Mesonotamia and Mr. Lloyd has given a full description of the wellinZlfoZlr tTne at Arghana.

In developing tbe fields it would be desirable to aim primarily at providing oil for consumption of tbe country at a reasonable price, so that the resources of the country may be developed for the country s advantage and not exploited for the benefit of existing oil companies.^ , , , 54 . As regards industries, there is little _ to be said. Mr. Lloyd noted that the silk industry, formerly one of the most important in Iraq, was showing sio-ns of revival. Systematic cultivation of mulburry trees should be possible over a large extent o*f Mesopotamia and the deputation of a qualified silk expert would seem desirable at an early date in order to decide on the best metnod o . reviving the cultivation of the silk worm. Tanning and working the leather were among the most solid industries in the country though the finish was generally poor and skins badly handled. The institution of up-to-date an- neries under experts might be expected to be a profitable venture. The unique art practised bv the Sabaean metal workers of inlaying silver with antimony should be capable of exploitation, if sufficient workers could be collected to enable the manufacture to be carried on a large scale. , „ Small development is, however, to be looked for under the head ot « industries ” since Mesopotamia is and will remain for a long time essentia y an agricultural country. . . . -j. 55 . The great bulk of the import trade was before the war the tiansit business with Western Persia through Baghdad, the real centre of cominercia interest. Basrah was primarily the seaport of Baghdad though its trade m dates and grain gave it an importance of its own and the local market piece-goods, suglr, etc., wal showing signs of expansion. The Persian trade through Khanikin will continue to be of great importance in the future, but if the agricultural regeneration of Mesopotamia takes place on the lines anUci- pated,°the purchasing power of the people will be very largely increased am the demand for imports of all kinds will expand. 56. The principal articles of import at Basrah m addition to piece-good* were gunnies, coffee, machinery, sugar and wood. Mr. Lloyd m his report ot 1908 laid stress upon the following points ( 1 ) The demand for mechanical pumps for irrigation, for agricultural machinery, high speed handlooms, silk weaving plants, etc. As regards mechanical pumps, there was a large sale in Baghdad before the war, perhaps as many as 100 a year, varying from 5 to 40 horse power Arabs eagerly take advantage of the assistance of these pumps and t should be a very large sale for them especially in Upper Mesopotamia where at present flow irrigation is more difficult. ^ It is understood that the Bevenue Department have already opened a branch in Baghdad for the repairing o machines and for the provision of oil and it is rendering much assistance to small cultivators in the neighbourhood. a ^ , _ r , Having regard to the anticipated abundance of oil fuel, Mesopotamia should offer a wonderful field for engineering enterprise and engineering firms would do well to send out accredited agents to demonstrate the possibilities ot mechanical power as applied to agriculture. There should be a great opening for the sale of modern ploughs and other agricultural machinery. The country is ideal for the use of machinery as the plains are perfectly level, ffiere is not a stone in the soil and the general character of the soil is not so heavy as to hamper tractors; Where the country is flat or undulating with a soil homoge neous over large areas, it is possible to employ a comparatively cumbrous engine which would be almost useless in confined fields with heavy gradients and changes in the nature and consistency of the soil. Leep ploughing is not necessary and the conditions resemble those in the United States oi* the w est o Canada/ With a view to popularise agricultural machinery m Mesopotamia it might he as well that Government should make advances to assist intending purchasers and should also provide instructions in the use of the machines. Commercial companies should construct and popularise the models best suited to the country. mi • ^ ^ (21 The tendency in the towns towards greater luxury. The introduc tion of European furniture, English and French dresses in the harems and uou cl ^ ^ articles of personal adornment. Deference has been made previously* * See paragraph 45.to the fact that the Arab has a keen appreciation of comfort and that his standard^ of living is already rising. There should be a very good trade after the war in domestic furniture and in articles of personal apparel both for men and women.^ Tailors’ shops and drapery stores might expect to do excellent business if they catered for native taste. (3) The importance of British merchants strengthening their position by more general trading, that is to say, by setting aside for a few years a portion of their profits on piece-goods in order to develope the trade in Hardware and fancy goods in which the Germans were gaining so much success. Reference has already been made above to the importance of supplying the class of goods which the country needs and not a more expensive article of higher quality. It is necessary, however, to remember that it is almost impossible for any one State or even Empire to endeavour to supply the whole demand of a particular area for manufactured goods. Great Britain ought at all hazards to retain the lead in supplying articles which are the special product of British factories and should in return derive full advantage from the resources of the country in which she trades in the shape of grain,°oil, etc. iso State, however, can be a microcosm of industry and if British manufacturers endeavour to outdistance their competitors in every single branch of supply, they are likely to dissipate their energies and imperil their supremacy in more unportant spheres. Eoreign goods will no doubt always find a market in the rersian Gulf and it does not appear necessary to try and exclude them, lercantile initiative may be trusted to decide what industries can properly be monopolised and to take full advantage of natural resources and oppor tunities so long as the foreign competing trade is not backed for political ends by the unlimited resources of a powerful Government. No amount of admoni tion by 1 rade Commissions or by Governments will induce merchants to embark ypon enterprises which, however desirable from the political point of view, uo not promise adequate returns for money invested, and that is why many o le recommendations of the various Trade Commissions in Persia and the . ln re g arc i to new lines of enterprise have produced no result whatever, xjiitish manufacturers have in the past found it more to their profit to con- centrate their energies on more expensive articles, but under changed conditions after the war they may deem it advisable to alter their methods. ie cart ful and systematic collection of information over a long period by a Commercial Bureau in regard to subjects in which British trade is likely to be interested will be of great assistance to local merchants. ihe conditions obtaining during the Commissioners’ tour were not such as to render it easy to gather any fresh information regarding the commercial outlook before the war, and the course of trade since the war does not afford much indication as to the probable openings when peace is restored. Cheap goods will no doubt hold the field for some time, especially as regards China, glassware, ironware, enamelware, paper and matches. There should be a very large market for spades of the native pattern (mizhas) and cheap lanterns and lamps are also in great demand. But when the purchasing power of the people has been increased, the character of the demand is likelv to change and a taste may be created for better quality articles in spite of the higher price. The small shopkeeper is the best barometer of local demand and his purchases should be carefully watched and, if possible, guided. (4) The question of sugar. The Belgian sugar from Antwerp which rapidly supplemented other competing varieties in the Persian Gulf, supplied the German traders with one of their most effective weapons of competition. It is unnecessary here to refer at length to the history of the sugar trade in the Gulf, which has been dealt with in many consular reports. If the Belgian refinery regains its position after the war, the sugar will doubtless be carried in British or French ships and certainly not in German vessels. Ihe sugar question will therefore lose much of its importance. Egyptian and Hongkong sugars, the latter imported by Japan, at present hold the market, but there is no reason why British refined sugar should not possess at least a half share in the Gulf sugar market if British firms could, see their way to put down a small plant for canes. It is believed that the sugar refined in Hong- * kong is by origin from Java or Mauritius and it is a matter for considerationk ti.ll for i do ilir ioa and of lost ole rlit ial )D1 tc, ?rs re gg i T t r ( l°£ 27 whether refineries could not be instituted in India in order to deal with such sugar. (5) The timber market.—The main Umber demand before the war was for date box wood and the amount taken was approximately one million boxes made of white wood coming chiefly from Fiume and Galatz. Wood for building came from the Malabar Coast and Singapore but white wood from. Odessa and Fiume was also competing. Mr. Lloyd thought that American competition was likely to commence before long and suggested that the impor tation of Canadian or Swedish timber should be taken up by British merchants. Attempts were made before the war to obtain date boxes from India, but a sample consignment was found to be inferior in quality to the Norwegian and Swedish boxes and probably also inferior to the boxes from Fiume. A ^ special* note is attached on the subject Appen 1X ' and attention is invited to the great importance of supplying from India the Mesopotamia demand not only for date boxes but also for oil cases and for building timber. In the very distant future, Mesopotamia may conceivably be able to grow' its own timber, but in the meanwhile it should provide a large and important market comparatively close at hand for many c f the less valuable Indian timbers. ( 6 ) Drugs —Lloyd pointed out that British drugs would find a large sale at reasonable prices if some important firm would give their agency to a reliable druggist in Baghdad. There is undoubtedly a great field for the chemist and druggist in Mesopotamia, as well as in Persia, and important British firms would do well to send representatives immediately after the war to travel over the principal towns, and stock shops. Leaflets should be printed in Arabic describing the drugs, the methods of taking them and their results. Finally, attention may be especially directed to the openings for trade which may be expected in connection with town development, that is to say, building materials and plant for sanitation, water supply, electric light, etc. 57. Special facilities might be arranged for British shipping and merchants port in connection with the management of the port administration, the customs’ ^.aministration, warehouses and inland transport. A strip of foreshore with deep water close to the bank at Magil, five wharfage, miles above the existing Customs House, has been selected for the wharves and warehouses, of the future port. One permanent wharf has already been con structed and the complete scheme contemjfiates two miles of continuous deep water wharves equipped with cranes and warehouses and having direct connec tion wuth the railway. When the new wharves are ready, it might be possible to arrange that British steamers should have preference over foreign steamers in the matter of berths or loading facilities. Arrangements could be made for the Port Officer to receive information of the coming of foreign ships before they entered the Gulf and the master of the ship could then be informed whether there was any likelihood of accommodation being available for him within a reasonable period. Before the Port is opened to trade, British ship-owners and merchants will Business sites and doubtless be given facilities for securing the most favourable sites available for warehouses, mercantile purposes. Each steamship company regularly visiting the port should be provided with one or more warehouses according to the volume of its trade, so that all cargo arriving by the Company’s steamers can be landed and delivered direct to the consignee against a Customs House pass, thus elimi nating the inconvenience of an intermediary between the shipping company and the consignee. A charge covering lighterage, cranage and cooly hire into the warehouses would either be collected from the consignee or added to the freight at the port of shipment. Cargo arriving by occasional steamefs might either be handled by arrangement with the agent of one of the regular lines or be accommodated in the warehouse which will be provided by the Customs to deal with goods coming into the port by native craft. All cargo ly ng in the steamship company’s warehouse after a fixed period might be transferred to a King s warehouse. A bonded warehouse or warehouses will be required at no distant date and, later on, the larger companies and firms might be28 Customs. o permitted to have their own bonded warehouses under Customs’ control. ^ ^rehouses for goods in transit will be required, especially in Baghdad, for the re-export of goods to Persia and Armenia. The site of export warehouses must depend largely on the position of the grain market. In all probability it would be more convenient at first to the trade for steamers, after discharge to drop down the river and load in the stream. Should the grain industry assume large dimensions, elevators will be required and loading will then take place alongside.^ Sites for oil and petrol bonded godowns might be placed on the bank of the river opposite Magil, a short distance down stream. 58. Tim Turks levied an import duty of 11 per cent, ad valorem (raised to 4o per cent, .just before the occupation) and an export duty of 1 per cent, ad valorem on all goods. After the occupation the import duty was reduced to 10 per eent. ad valorem and the ex} 3 ort duty was provisionally abolished The export tax of 1 per cent, was reimposed in March 1916. The Mesopotamia Administration is by no means committed to maintaining the present customs system and changes will ^ doubtless have to be made with reference to the arr . lved 1 at P? H 1 is Majesty’s Government to the effect that each part ol the Empire, haying due regard to the interests of our Allies, shall -ive specially favourable terms and facilities to the produce and manufacture of other parts of the Empire. Until the issue of the report of the Committee on Commercial and Industrial Policy after the war, it is useless to offer sugoes- 10 ns for framing the tariff in ^Mesopotamia. Mesopotamia could probably lace with equanimity for some time to come any hostile tariff that might be imposed by foreign nations by way of retaliation against Imperial preference. fc r °t UC S T 6 SU - Ch a§ Can ? nd a ready market within the Empire, except dates which America cannot get elsewhere, and her requirements can be urnished by the Empire. Mesopotamia will presumably have a revenue pro ducing tariff on the lines of those prescribed for Crown colonies such as Ceylon the Straits Settlements or East Africa. Assuming that the tariff will be on an ad valorem basis, it should be collected on the actual cost of the goods delivered m the Basrah Customs House, that is to say, duty should be payable on the price at which the importer can sell the goods without profit and without loss rnnff ir ar / 1Va ? . 1U f 16 .

The Customs Collector has reported the occurrence of some bad cases of fraudulently incorrect invoices! The export duty on cotton, when any is produced, will no doubt be care fully arranged so as to guide the crop in the direction required. i&gt;9. The conditions of trade are at present too abnormal to warrant anv recommendations on the following points : ^ }V' list °- f ^ ticies to ke included in the schedule. (-) I he possibility of increasing the export duty on dates, which are competition from other countries. ( ; Special rebates to be given to goods passing in transit to Persia by the Baghdad-Kermanshah route, in view of the possibility that the Russians will encourage trade from the North into Persia by giving a refund of customs duty on goods entering via Trebizond n\ ti Eat ^.? n order to dlvert 4116 trade from the South. (I) Ih® Possibility ^ of introducing into the tariff special discrimination a gamst Persia m order to compel her to modify her tariff in certain items, e.g., tea and coffee, which bear heavily upon British29 /1 oA-j (5) Special measures that may be necessary in order to offer inducements to merchants to land goods destined for Persia at Basrah rather than at Mohammerah. It is desirable that, so far as possible, all trade should be concentrated in Basrah since otherwise Persian trade might be diverted permanently to Mohammerah. Moham merah offers special facilities for the despatch of goods to Basrah since it is understood that no customs duty is charged^ there on goods landed for re-shipment. In this connection it is doubtful whether the drawback on re-export, amounting to | of the duty levied on import, is sufficient attraction and it might be advisable, even before the end of the war, to start a bonded warehouse on a small scale for piece-goods destined for Persia. ( 6 ) The danger of smuggling from Kuwait into Mesopotamia.^ The customs duty on imports into Kuwait is I per cent, except in the case of a few articles of luxury on which 10 per cent, is levied and the tariff on articles of import works out at considerably less than 4 per cent. Before any conclusions are arrived at on these points the opinion of the local Chamber of Commerce would doubtless be ascertained. 60. If, as proposed above, the main business of _ the transport both of transport, passengers and goods upon the river is carried on by a single company to be exclusively British in constitution, the expansion of the trade of fore'g'a firms would he subject to control. To begin with, it would seem desirable that no | navigation of the inland waters above the port of Basrah by mechanically propelled craft for the transport of goods or conveyance of passengers for hire should be permitted, except under license from the Administration. 61. Before the war, the usual method of settling accounts washy campiala. Banking, a promissory note payable at date and perfectly negotiable when backed by a good name. In the foreign trade, orders for goods were sent direct to Europe bv the larger firms only. Other orders were dealt with by commission houses, which ordered goods subject to payment of a small initial deposit, the Balance being paid on arrival of the goods. English hanks are said to have failed to finance the exporter in the same way as German hanks did, but the charge is strongly rebutted by English bankers. _ The banks were in the habit of financing exports, such as, few instance, piece goods, against hills of lading and other documents, which, however, had to be sent to the overseas agent fo collection. It was frequently incumbent upon the bank to grant loans before the goods were shipped and such loans had to be made on the character and standing of the bank’s customers. Foreign trade was subject to peculiar difficulties and dangers and its finance required much care and foresight. It is understood that in pursuance of the recommendations of Lord Farinzdon’s Committee, a British Trade Corporation is to be established with the object of establishing and facilitating a large credit bank or banks for developing British trade abroad. This corporation will presumably not interfere with the operations of the British Joint Stock Banks B^i ish or Colonial hanks but it should he in a position to assist industry and trade especially abroad more effectively than the present banking institutions are capable of doing. If such a corporation is formed, it will probably be supported largely by manufacturers with their own money. The alliance _ between organised finance and organised industry was marvellously adT “°f d ,^ erm n an / cr ^“® the war, and it is not to he expected that those responsible for the management of purely banking concerns will abandon in the conduct of their businesses the oldand clear distinction between legitimate lending and adventurous banking. The prospects of Mesopotamia are so bright that they should attract large amountsof capital after the war, as soon as there is any capital to spare for commercial enterprise, and the situation will doubtless be eagerly studied by financiers. , . -n i, 62. At the present time the following hanks are represented in Basrah . ( 1 ) The Eastern Bank, which has in its charge the funds of the civil adminstration. /( 2 ) The Imperial Bank of Persia. (3) The Imperial Ottoman Bank. All these banks have offices in London and the Eastern Bank has branches in Bombay and other Indian towns. Branches of the Eastern Bank are in existence at Amara and Baghdad. The Imperial Ottoman Bank have a branch at Baghdad and Messrs. Lynch represent the Bank of Persia at Amara. The ^Alliance Bank of Simla, which is a concern of growing importance in India, have it under contemplation to establish branches in Mesopotamia, and they propose to despatch a representative to Basrah in the coming cold weather to examine the situation. The question of Banking in South Persia and the Gulf Ports is discussed separately later. 63. Finally, agriculture will require careful financial nursing. It has hitherto been an established practice for the cultivator to borrow money on the security of a crop before it has matured, giving a campiala in consideration for the loan, which bears interest at relatively high rates. The present exchange banks or any others that open branches in Mesopotamia may pro bably not consider that the financing of agriculture is within their scope and it would seem desirable that Government should at an early date inaugurate a co-operative banking system on the lines of the movement which in India has made such rapid progress and attained such a sound position. It is understood that the agricultural bank system in Egypt has not been an entire success, but before any decision is arrived at, it would seem desirable that the features both of the social structure and of the administration &gt;n Mesopotamia should be carefully compared with those obtaining in India and Egypt. It is essential that some system 0 f agricultural credit should be created. 61. Before the war the currency at Basrah was a very complicated matter, but for present purposes it is sufficient to say that the Turkish gold lira was the standard for trade payments and the silver mejidi for the payment of Government dues and for date purchases. The deficiency in local silver coinage was made up by foreign coinage, chiefly Persian, which was tolerated since it was indispensable to business, in spite of the fact that the free circulation of foreign coin was restricted by regulations. Indian silver was also current though occasionally impounded under the regulations. Certain fictitious coins were also used as units of computation in particular classes of transactions with a view to lessen the inconvenience caused by othe fluctuations of the actual coins. After the British occupation, the exchange value of the lira was provision ally fixed at Rs. 13-8 and it was decided to accept for the time all Turkish coins offered in payment of revenue. All liras received were kept in deposit, as there were obvious objections against permitting them to circulate. The accumulation of Turkish coins in the Treasury was, however, less than was expected and Indian currency was established in the country without any difficulty. 65. The circulation of Indian coin and notes is now on much the same footing in Mesopotamia as in India. Quantities of Indian notes have been absorbed. The rate of exchange is maintained at a regular level and merchants are thereby enabled to work on a narrower margin of profit. The level is maintained by the grant to merchants of supply bills or telegraphic transfers on Bombay or Calcutta at par, both from Basrah and from the larger towns in Mesopotamia where treasuries have been established. New notes are put v into circulation as frequently as possible and every effort is made to meet promptly a demand for notes or cash wherever it arises. Merchants are in the habit of sending their remittances to Bombay or Amara or vice verm by means of notes and the popularity of the notes is illustrated by the fact that at one time they were at 1 per cent, premium at Amara. Every effort is made to provide sufficient quantities of small change by issuing packets of mixed change as part of rupee payments made by the Eastern Bank. The kran continued for a time to be current in Basrah and was accepted as equivalent to a four anna piece. During the period when the kran wasdepreciated in value in 1915, it paid to import krans into 33asrali wlieie they were accepted at four to the rupee although the rate was 425, 435 and even on one occasion 475 krans to 100 rupees. Some profit was made by exporting to Mohammerah rupees purchased with the krans. Measures were taken, however, to prevent the importation of krans and to provide a sufficiency of the lesser Indian coins. The import of krans ceased early in 1916, when owing to a variety of reasons the kran commenced to rise rapidly in value. » 66. The remarkable appreciation in the Persian kran which has taken place during the past year heavily increased Government's liabilities in the matter of kran payments on account of the. Expeditionary Force and other expenditure. The reasons which contributed to the rise have been hotly debated. Before the war a very large quantity of Persian silver was dealt with in Baghdad, owing to the fact that Persian pilgrims to the Mesopotamian Holy Places preferred to carry coin, and merchants also made it a custom to send down specie when rates were unfavourable for drafts. _ Baghdad was also a financial centre for the collection of krans owing to its situation near the frontier and the comparative safety of the trade route into Persia. It is to be hoped that after the war some means will be found for steadying the Persian kran exchange, but it is difficult to see how it can he done, unless the Persian Government decide to establish a reserve with the profits of coinage in some such central market as London or Bombay. Owing to Mesopotamia’s proximity to India and the intimate business connections between the two countries, there can be little doubt that the Indian rupee should continue to be current in the occupied territories, it not permanently, at all events for a long while to come, if the Government of India are willing to permit this arrangement. PEBSIA. 67. We how turn to a consideration of the trade wLich, entering Persia Bntish at the Gulf ports, makes its way inland to the important markets on the central Persian plateau. The official trade statistics for the year ending March 1904 showed that the total trade of Persia was about ten and a hair millions, Bussia’s share being five and a half millions and the British and Indian share only two and a half millions. During the succeeding decade the value ol the trade continued to increase rapidly and the customs figures for 191 3-ld show a total of over 20 million sterling of which Eussia’s share w r as nearly 12 millions and the British and Indian share about 4| millions. The German share of the trade was £440,000 in the year 1912-13 and about £600,000 in the following year:— The following are the main routes by which British trade entered Persia. Main (1) From Trebizond into the north-west corner of Persia near Bayazid. (2) Via Baghdad and Khanikin to Kermanshah and Hamadan. (3) By Mohammerah to Ahwaz for Dizful and Khorramabad on the one hand and Ispahan on the other. (4) Through Bushire to Shiraz and Ispahan and Yezd. (5) Through Bandar Abbas to Kerman and other smaller centres, (6) Through Lingah for Lar. (7) From Baluchistan by the Nushki route.32 Yeab 1913-14. Geimau competition.

J Including a rough estimate for exports, which are not recorded by countries. § Exclusive of Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s plant and material. (1 Trade via the Nashki route only. Figure for Afghanistan is not recorded. The marginally noted table shows roughly the proportion of the total British trade which passed by each of these avenues. Eussian trade entered Persia mainly from the north, and the subsidised steamship line from Odessa to the Persian Gulf hardly affected British seaborne trade. German competition was mainly felt by British mer chants at the ports, although less than half German trade entered Persia through the Gulf. The progress of German commerce and shipping in the Gulf has been already des cribed, and it is sufficient to say that the main danger lay in the fact that the German line, by means of its sugar carrying contracts, was working itself into a powerful position at the expense of British shipping. German rivalry was severely felt at Mohammerah and on the Karun river, and this aspect of the matter is dealt with separately below. At other Gulf ports a variety of articles of haberdashery and hardware as well as synthetic indigo, woollens and velvets and, to a lesser degree, cottons and yarns were imported direct from the continent, while in the matter of exports the Germans were showing considerable ingenuity and enterprise. Still, on the whole, they were not regarded as serious antagonists and German competi tion was only to be feared as a sympton of the subtle attack which was being made upon British interests in other more vital quarters. Eussian trade has been, and still is, the real complement of British trade in Persia and a compara tive study of British and Eussian methods and spheres of interest is an essential preliminary to an understanding of the situation. 68. Mention was made in paragraph 2 above of the fact that Messrs. Maclean and Newcomen were deputed in 1903 and 1904 respectively to study the trade situation. The conclusions at which they arrived in their respective reports on the subject of Eussian and British trade rivalry have been analysed in Appendix IV and may be summarised briefly as follows. The development of Eussian trade during the decade 1892-1902 seemed attributable to the following reasons (1) Eussia enjoyed special advantages from her superior geographical position, since the most cultivated, populous and prosperous provinces of Persia were adjacent to the Eussian border. (2) The Persian customs tariff of 1903 had been devised by Eussian diplomacy with the express object of favouring Eussian and discriminating against British trade. (3) Eussia had taken special measures to encourage the export of Eussian goods to Persia by granting favourable through rates and drawback of duty, and by providing banking facilities, while imports to Eussia from Persia were carefully fostered; raw cotton in particular being charged a very much lower rate of duty than cotton imported across the European and Black Sea frontiers. The result of this was that in 1904 Eussia was attracting practi cally the whole of the raw cotton exported by Persia, that is to say, 237,000 out of 240,000 cwt. (4) Eussian manufactures had made great progress. (5) British trade was handicapped owing to (a) the insecurity and inadequacy of communications, {b) the illegal imposts such as rahdari and dalali, (&lt;?) the ill-devised customs regulations and the obstructiveness and irrational methods of Belgian officials, (d) thes views. indolence and conservatism of Indian manufacturers and traders, (e) the unreadiness of the Imperial Bank of Persia to accommo date merchants in the matter of dealing with bills, all papers being penalised as compared with bank paper when offered in payment against drafts, (/) the inability of the British consular system to perform the functions of an up-to-date commercial intelligence bureau, and (g) the insufficiency of exports. 69. The continuous and rapid growth of Russian trade during the succeed ing decade vindicated the more important of the conclusions formed by Messrs. Maclean and Newcomen and directed attention, in particular, to the problem o the extent to which Russia’s gain meant Britain’s loss. Mr. George Lloyd writing in July 1916 averred that in the central Persian Mr. Lio y d ! markets British trade had suffered in the last few years severe checks m consequence of energetic Russian competition. He said that the comparative decline vis-a-vis Russia of British trade had been going on for a long period and was indicative of the deep-rooted nature of the disease. He pointed out that in six years Russian imports of yarn had increased by ooO tons while t total imports of the United Kingdom and India together had only increased by 300 tons. In piece-goods, again, Russian imports had mcr . ea ^^/ 7 ^ 0 / o ° n n s S while the United Kingdom and India imports had increased only 2,7o0 tons. Iron and steel wire showed a British increase of 800 tons against a Russian increase of 1,800 tons. He held that the obsolete methods of ransport which formed the only vehicle for British trade into Persia were rapidly kilim British commerce and that it was necessary for something to be done imme diately ” process of decay were' to be arrested and the British position restored. As regards exports, he drew attention to the fact that of the mam raw materials emanating from Persia, namely, wool, gum, hides, rice and cotton, the British were taking comparatively less year by year, while Russia took more and more. 70. In 1899 Great Britain Eeld the Kermanshah and Hamadan markets to pw- the exclusion of all European competitors and, m fact, British trade was m lull 1914&lt; nossession of the country up to and including a line drawn from Khamqm by TCprin'mshah Ispahan Yezd and Kerman to Seistan. Beyond that line it had hecun to give ground both in the noth-west and in Tehran and m Rhorasan. b| 1901 Russian trade, energetically pressed, had f'. ussl “ “““as the to romnete with British in Hamadan, Ispahan and Yezd. As re^aids t^ transport of haled goods from the Persian frontier, Russia had an advantage in the Hamadan market but was still at a disadvantage in the Ispahan market. In 1007 the British Consul at Kermanshah reported that the year s import Manchester goods had been greater than ever and that they were again carituriii' thiflabriz market in the north, notwithstanding Russian bounties. Again, in 1911, it was reported that nothing competed with Manchester goods irb Hamadan except a white material coming from looms in India. Ine ■RVrmanshah report for 1911-12 says that Manchester cotton goods more than held their own, and British importers in spite of the insecurity of the Bagffida - Kermanshah route were able to supply a much better quality stuff at less cost than the importers of Russian goods brought into the country over pracUcally protected roads. Woollens of British manufacture were m increasing demand. In the succeeding report it was also stated that under normal conditions ther was Mttle clpektionkith the imports mainly of British -gm Horn B hdad. The report for 1911 mentioned that Russian cotton goods had increased o p. Lt Tn the Kermanshah bazars but Russian sugar could not compete with water-borne goods as long as freight from Baghdad was normal. British tiade in Ispahan undoubtedly suffered,, severely in 1910-11 from the closure of the Bushrre Shiraz route owing to insecurity but the trade reports for Ispahan for 1911-14 do not indicate thlt Russian piece-goods were competing very seriously wUh the British article, and the trade figures for 1913-14 value the British interest at £608,753 and the Russian at £261,608. _ ^ As regards exports, Russia reaps advantage from her propinquity to the rich producing areas. There is no cotton available for British and Indianmerchants to export and they have done their best with cereals and opium and minor products. There are no indications that Eussian merchants have made appreciable inroads into British exports. ^British^trade° Wer • ^ Commissioners are not of opinion that the trade situation in Persia Before the war was such as to justify the gloomy conclu sions which Mr. Lloyd drew from the import and export tables submitted with his Note. British trade, owing no doubt largely to cause’s beyond the control of British merchants, remained stagnant and failed to develope fresh markets or increased consumption, but in the main it held its own, in spite of very grave disadvantages, in the area which it had previously exploited against Eussian trade. There are no symptoms of “deep-rooted disease” and given a return of favourable conditions a robust recovery may be anticipated enabling fulfilment of the main commercial requirements within the former snhcrp bounded by the Khaniqin-Seistan line. Again, British trade has not really suffered from the methods adopted for fostering Eussian trade, and even the Persian tariff, which taxes Eussian imports so much more lightly than British, cannot be said, during the past six years at least, to have produced much prejudicial effect. The selling prices of Eussian and British goods of the same class at inland markets where tiiey meet are governed by the violent fluctuations and enormous increases of rates of inland transport, and differential tariff treatment for the moment is of small importance. The customs duty on exported wheat and barley in the south was reduced in 1910 without any objection from Eussia and a drawback of duty was also granted on imported sacks when used for the exportation of cereals. The Persian tariff cannot, therefore, be considered to have handicapped the cereal export which depends, first and last, on good harvests and facility of communications. Similarly, the value of opium has risen so much since 1901 that the export duty has probably had very little effect on shipments. The tariff presses very heavily on a few articles such as tea, spices, coffee and liquor and this point is dealt with separately later. The Persian tariff, although complicated, does not afford much ground for complaint by British merchants except in so far as it encourages the smuggling of particular articles in preference to payment of unfairly heavy duty. The old system of taxation by value m Persia permitted much greater opportunity for bribery and corruption than the existing tariff. 1 Russia’s natural advantages. On the other hand, the progress of Eussian trade was natural and uniform and there is good reason for supposing that its volume must always, or at all events for a very long time to come, be far greater than that of British trade. Ihe preponderating advantages which Eussia possesses in the matter of physical situation renders it almost inevitable that future increases should be shared between the two countries, not equally but in the proportions observed in the increases of past years, that is to say, roughly 2 to 1 in favour of Eussia. We cannot, however, grudge this superiority to Eussia, and Eussian merchants would, on the other hand, have valid cause for complaint if we made a determined bid for the trade of the rich northern markets which are Eussia’s by ngnt of contiguity. There is plenty of room for both British and Eussian trade in Persia and so long as British merchants can retain their grasp upon the markets in which they have hitherto held sway they have no rio-ht to grumble if Eussian trade, more advantageously situated, expands in the north more rapidly than their own in the south. SSh“aTupon f F ° r ma .?y y eavs P ast , 14 h ? s been realised that the development of communications. .Drillsn traue with rersia is dependent primarily on the improvement of com- mumcations. All other measures which have been proposed from time to time ior the encouragement of commerce are of quite subsidiary importance. Of the seven avenues * by which British Irade enters Persia Nos, 1, 6 and * vide margin paragraph 67 . require but brief notice. The route via . . Trebizond is likely to concern us less and ess as time goes on, since it will presumably be controlled by Eussia. Juord Lurzon estimated the British trade by this route at about £610,000 in 1889. ien years later the estimate was about £302,000 and for the year 1913-14 themain British share was put at £176,698 out of a total of £2,325,000. The sixth route via Lingah need not be taken into ^ vide Note on the Port of Lingab, Appendix ser i 0 us consideration since, although a No. xvi (n). promising little trade is done at the port, while the climate is tolerable, and the roadstead has some advantages over Bushire and Bandar Abbas, yet communication with the interior is never likely to develope, in consequence of the arid and mountainous nature of the hinterland. Trade via the Nushki route (No. 7) will be helped by the extension of the rail to Dalbandin, but the value of the trade is at present comparatively insignificant and the development of this route has not much bearing upon the main problem now under discussion. 73. Each of the four remaining routes has a special claim to consideration The four both on commercial and political grounds and each may therefore be described l0u es&gt; briefly. (2) Kermanshah via Khaniqin. As mentioned in paragraph 23 above, &lt;6 ^ermanshah. the requirements of the Baghdad- Khaniqin-Kermanshah route to Persia governed the commercial situation in Mesopotamia before the war. Three- quarters of the imports at Basrah went to Baghdad and the greater part were destined for Persia. In normal times transport was fairly easy and sate as compared with other routes in Persia. The distance by river from Basrah ^o Baghdad is about 500 miles and from Baghdad to Kermanshah 2-0 As far as Khaniqin, 95 miles, the road is quite passable for wheeled tramc and not long ago a postal cart was running from Kermanshah to Ciasr-i-8mrin. The population of Kermanshah has been estimated at about 60,000 persons an the town is of considerable importance both strategically and commercia y, since it is nearly equidistant from Tabriz, Enzeli, Teheran and Baghda wit which places it has good communications, besides being thedistnbuting centre for the districts of Kurdistan and Hamadan. The town of Hamadan, which in the past has been described as the &lt;t ambar’ , {storehouse) of Persia, used to receive about three-quarters of the imports coming via Kermanshah and is the source of supply for the markets of many towns. Another estimate states that only one-fifth of the imports remains in Kermanshah, the remainder being distributed from Hamadan and Sultanabad and Burujird. As regards exports, Kermanshah is one of the great grain producing dis tricts of Persia and formerly used to have a large yearly surplus. e 1 wl f ^r ! , snows and the spring rains among the mountains of Kurdistan as to render irrigation unnecessary, and the valleys are broad, ev . in°dy fertile. The carpet trade of Hamadan is considerably on the increase, while opium, gums, skins, almonds and other native products are o ““I 10 q It is said that many years ago about one million pounds weight of wool used to be exported annually to Baghdad. The wool export 'A^i ted in about £2,100 and much wool which formerly went out of the country 'Hamadan carpet factories, but the splendid pasturage should mamtam ve y large flocks if a settled administration were introduced and e p . , available The traffic on the road is swelled by the numbers of pilgrims and by the transport of corpses to Kerbela, and the pilgrims, returning, carry uith them quantities of merchandise. The value of British f f ^ Kermanshah route just before the war was estimated at more than a millio pounds and the exports were probably worth at least £120,uu. It is obvious that if British superiority is to be maintained n • t of the north-west and the centre of Persia, very special attentonmustbe paid will be given to this route and British interests should p markets which it supplies. 74 (2) Mohanmerah via Ahwaz to Bizful and Shustar on the one hand ^ obvious from its geographical position standing, as it does, about midwaybetween the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, on the main trade route from Enzeli in the north to Bushire in the south, while numerous other routes radiate in almost every direction. Ispahan up till recent times served as a distributing centre as far as Kum on the north, Abadeh on the south, the Yezd- Kerman road on the east and the Bakhtiari country on the west. For many years it drew most of its supplies from Bushire, but the opening of the Lynch road from Ahwaz and the increasing insecurity of the Bushire-Shiraz sector, together with the disappearance of many of the transport mules, has resulted at the present moment in the diversion of by far the greater portion of the trade to Mohammerah and it is unlikely in the opinion of the Commissioners, that Bushire will ever regain the ascendency which it once enjoyed. The special advantages of the Ahwaz route may be summed up as follows :— (tit) Bushire- Ispahan. (to) Bandar Abbas to Kerman. Importance of im* proving the Ahwaz- Ispahan route, (1) The fact that the distance from Ispahan to Mohammerah is only 380 miles as against 460 to Bushire. If the problem of supplies and accommodation were systematically attacked on the Lynch road, the popularity of the route would grow rapidly. (2) The superior facilities which Mohammerah possesses as a port. (3) The prospects which Arabistan holds out as% field for the investment of British capital. This point is dealt with later. 75. (3) Bushire-Shiraz-Ispahan.—In the opinion of the Commissioners, there are grounds for a firm belief in the future of Bushire as a collecting and distributing centre both for the hinterland up to Shiraz and for an extensive littoral * area, but it is improbable that No.xv/(i). epara ‘ e °° te 0 ° B '“ hire ' Aw,endk the connection between Shiraz and Ispahan will afford the best route for the transit of merchandise to central Persia in view of the easier route via Ahwaz, and of the- permanent disabilities * of Bushire as a harbour. 76. {4) Through Bandar Abbas to Kerman and Yezd and other smaller centres. —The importance of the route from Bandar Abbas to Kerman has bfcen insisted upon by many authorities. Kerman is a distributing centre for western Afghanistan, Khorasan and south-west and central Persia. British trade there is open to attack since Bussian trade advancing from Tehran has an ideally easy route to follow through Kum, Kashan and Yezd, and protective measures are therefore required. The harbour at Bandar Abbas possesses advantages not met with elsewhere on the Persian coast and a route is available over a comparatively easy country via Minab and Began to the interior. Trade at present follows the Tang-i-Zindan route for reasons of safety but in the absence of raiders the route via the Tang-i-Zagh is preferred. On the other hand, it is by no means certain that outlay on the Bandar* Abbas-Kerman route would be commercially remunerative. The principal imports are tea, sugar, oil, piece-goods and general merchandise in sufficient t Valued at about £ 145,000 in 1913 - 14 . quantities f to supply a community num bering about one and a half million, while t valued at about £ 150,000 in 191344 . the only valuable exports are carpets.:[ But for the carpet industry, which occupies directly or indirectly almost the entire population, Kerman would probably sink to insignificance since it is situated in the midst of a waterless and almost desert tract. There are said to be coal, manganese and asbestos fields in the neighbourhood of Kerman but nothing definite has hitherto been ascertained in regard to them. 77. Three at least of the four trade routes might be expected to develope a considerably greater trade, if cart or rail transport could be substituted for pack animals, but the construction of railways in Persia involves very difficult problems. If financial or political considerations preclude for the present the building of railways by any one of the three main routes then, assuming that every thing possible will, in any case, be done to develop the Baghdad-Khaniqin route, the Commissioners would invite special attention to the importance of improving the Ahwaz-Ispahan and the Bushire-Shiraz routes by any alternative means available.V rf 37 78. After improvement, of communications, the next most important condition for the improvement of trade prospects is the introduction of a settled nature necessary administration in South Persia. It is needless to enlarge upon the paralysing development, effect of frequent robberies of caravans and the collection of heavy illegal (») The establish- imposts under the name of rahdari and dalali, etc., and it does not fall within “ e d n e t r ot a ' van the scone of the Commissioners’ duties to make suggestions for the better (n) The amehm-a- control of the tribes. Secondly, merchants may legitimately expect that the ^ the cus 0U1 British Government will make energetic representations to the Persian and Russian Governments after the war with a view to some amelioration of the customs tariff. This matter has been dealt with at length in official communi cations, and the Commissioners need only endorse what has already been said. The duties on tea, spices, indigo, rice and coffee are certainly too high and the Persian customs will never be in a position to prevent smuggling of over taxed articles along the hundreds of miles of coast which the launches are supposed to guard. Reductions of duty on spirits, wines, and certain articles of European consumption and clothing, though less urgent and necessary, might also be asked for. Kerosine, matches, metals and machinery are in a position to stand an increased duty. As regards exports, wheat, barley and tambaku pay excessive rates in comparison with those imposed m other countries, while the duty on opium might be increased. After the war, the Persian Government will doubtless ask for our consent to increased rates ox dutv and the special incidence of duty will then require more detailed exami nation. But any changes that may be agreed to should be made conditional on reductions in the case of articles which are undoubtedly heavily over-taxed at present. 79 Thirdly, improved arrangements are necessary for the collection of for commercial intelligence, for the compilation of statistical data and for the co^ectjo^ot representation of trade interests generally. intelligence. In regard to the record of statistics showing the volume and distribution of trade in the interior, attention is invited to paragraph 21 above. It is understood that His Majesty’s Government have had under their special consi deration the whole question of trade representation abroad, and any changes that may be made in the previously existing system will be of _ universal application. Emphasis may, however, be laid upon the following points : (a) that the Consular officer in South Persia and the Gulf owing to the conditions of his recruitment has little knowledge of trade except in rare cases, and his energies and interests are absorbed in political work. So long as the service is manned from the Political Department of the Government of India, there will be no change in this respect and there is therefore need for the appointment of at least two commercial experts over and above the existing political establishment. One of these officers should have his headquarters at Bushire but until the political atmos phere clears, it would be futile to try and estimate where the second might most profitably be located ; (b) that Persian trade is a special line and is not attractive to the ordinary exporter or importer in the United Kingdom and India, in view of the fluctuations of the exchange, the ignorance and disregard of European business methods by Persian chants, the unsatisfactory result of the local credit system, the difficulty of obtaining redress in case of default, the limited ran^e of requirements for the Persian market, and the paucity o exports. Having regard to the political importance of the Persian trade, it would seem advisable for the Board of Trade on receiving information as to demands for particular^ articles, to brin 0 * direct pressure to bear upon special firms in order to induce them to manufacture and despatch experimental consign ments ; for instance, endeavours might be made to interest some firm of iron manufactures in the production of spadeheads and ploughshares, which are now made locally and extensively used in Southern Persia for irrigation works and ploughing.

Moreover, the intervention of a third party, in the shape of a lightering and landing company, between the steamship company and the consignee might lead to complications. The shipping company is the best custodian of the cargo until its delivery to the consignee. In all probablity, it will be best that the British India Company should continue to provide their own lighterage plant which they will doubtless make available, when convenient, to other British com panies on payment, unless and until such companies decide to combine in providing their own lighterage arrangements. The important thing is that British shipping should have the use of an organised fleet of lighters and, where necessary, of a launch tug, and that foreign shipping should so far as possible be denied this advantage. 82. The special features of British trade at the ports of Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas have been described Vide Appendix No. v. se p arate n0 t es to which reference is invited. British commercial interests at the remaining port of Mohammerah are to a great extent dependent on the political situation. 83. Arabistan is a fertile country producing a considerable variety ^ of crops, wdieat and barley being most general in their distribution. The foreign Arabistan. trade is carried on almost exclusively through the port of Mohammerah. The trade has grown rapidly, the imports having increased from £168,200 in 1902-03 to £812,100 in 1913-14, and the exports similarly from £81,000 to £307,000. The United Kingdom and India possessed 75 per cent, of the imports and 33 per cent, of the exports in the year 1913-14. Boreign interests in Arabistan were for a long time almost entirely British and were principally represented by the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, the Aims of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, Strick, Scott and Company, agents for the Anglo- Persian Oil Company and the Persian Bailway Syndicate, and Gray Mackenzie and Company. The Navigation Company ran a steamer service on the Korun between Mohammerah and Ahwaz and also maintained on behalf of the Persian Government a steamer plying on the Upper Karun from Ahwaz to the neighbourhood of Shustar. Messrs. Lynch constructed the Ahwaz-Ispahan road as agents for the Bakhtiari Khans, and the Persian Bailway Syndicate held a concession for a road from Ahwaz via Bizful, Khorremabad and Burujird to Kum with a branch from Burujird to Ispahan. The Anglo- Persian Oil Company, of which the commercial importance is well known, obtained, in 1909, a concession for the lease of land and other facilities required in connection with the transaction of their business and the Imperial Bank of Persia opened a branch in 1910. 84. The Germans realised at an early stage of their adventure in the Gulf German that the peculiar political and commercial conditions obtaining in Arabistan p^Ap^dix afforded a favourable opening for attack upon British interests. In 1907 thejxo. xvii. firm of Wonckhaus leased from the Sheikh for a period of eight years a plot of ground for use as a store and wharf at Mohammerah, where they opened a ^, grain purchasing agency. In 1913 they placed a steamer with barges on the Karun and commenced a regular service. , They hired a warehouse and whar at Ahwaz and clearly intended to build up a large business on the Karun as ^ // theT had done in Basrah. There seemed to be very little doubt that the hrm meant to open agencies at Shustar and Bizful, and rumour had it that they contemplated competing with Messrs. Lynch as transport agents on the Ahwaz-Ispahan road. The German Minister at Tehran intimated to the Persian Government that his Government reserved to themselves the right ot participating in the navigation in the Upper Karun in the event of the Persian Government according such rights to other nations. German imports at Mohammerah rose from £3,5000 in 1906-07 to £79,800 in 1913-14 and their exports from nil to a maximum of £22,000 in 1911-12. German success in Mohammerah, as in other places, has been explained on various grounds, viz., their subsidised shipping, their superior business acumen, their systematic evasion of customs dues, the supineness ot BritishV w L 40 firms, etc- But the rapidity of German developm3nt in this instance was particularly disconcerting in view of the solidity of British commercial interests and of the fact that the Sheikh of Mohammerah was under special obligations to the British Government. The Sheikh was, however, to some extent powerless in the matter in consequence of the constitutional limitations on his freedom of action as a ruler. If political conditions in Arabistan develope favourably, there should be a very promising future for British trade on the Karun.

The Imperial Bank of Persia, which is the only British banking banking. concern in Persia, has in the past rendered valuable service both politically and commercially. The British mercantile community in South Persia seem on the whole fairly satisfied with the treatment which they have received from the Bank, though complaints are made at Bushire of the Bank’s refusal to accept damaged coins. The intimate and growing connection between the Persian ports and India might be benefited by the establishment of branches of one of the great banks of India at trade centres in southern Persia. In 1911, however, when the matter was under consideration, the representatives of the principal British banks at Bombay and Karachi were of opinion that there was no room for an Indian bank at the Gulf ports. Conditions have altered a good deal during the last six years and the Eastern bank in particular might now be willing to open branches at the Persian ports, in view of the fact that they have several agencies in Mesopotamia and have already contemplated opening at Bahrain.

Separate notesj have been prepared in regard to the prospects of + Tr ., . ,. „ T7TTr British trade at the ports of Kuwait, t Fi* Appendix No. VIII. ^ ^ ^ ^ much of a general nature to be said. The Commissioners would lay stress on the importance of a proper examination of the pearl beds within territorial waters on the Arab Coast by an expert as proposed in 1910. It is also very desirable that the measures suggested in the note on Bahrain should be taken in order to preserve the mother-of-pearl and shell trade in British hands. Bahrain is by far the most important of the Arab Coast ports and having regard to the extent of our influence with the Sheikh, it should be possible to ensure most favourable opportunities for British trade. When feasible, opportunity should be taken to investigate the potentialities of trade with the interior of Arabia. Summary. Mesopotamia. paragraphs i-4. 87. Just before the war the total sea-borne trade of the Gulf, excluding S S tke a Guir petltl ° n coasting and local trade, was valued at above 12\ millions sterling of which the British share was 76 per cent. The pecuniary value of the trade was no great matter and its loss would not have seriously affected British commerce. Commercial success in the Gulf has, however, involved the assumption of political responsibilities and these cannot be lightly surrendered. The Germans realising that British political predominance achieved through commerce was vulnerable through commerce set themselves to win as large a share of the trade as possible. Their commercial competition was the cutting edge of a vast political intrigue which was organised with the object of obtaining control over the railway route to the East and by this means exerting pressure upon the British Empire at a sensitive point.41 8S. If the war ends favourably for the Allies, British shipping and Commerce will recommence operations in the Gulf under conditions which, politically, could hardly be more advantageous. 89. With a view to consolidate British commercial interests against attack, 5-8. the shipping companies concerned should be organised so as to render the aXh^Mppif.. most emeient and economical service possible as public carriers. The interests of the British community trading between the United Kingdom and the Persian Gulf would probably best be served by a combination between the main British shipping authorities. At the outset, a line or a combination of lines affording direct com munication between the United Kingdom and the Gulf should provide sailings, on as regular a schedule as possible, at such frequent intervals as the trade may warrant. A direct mail between England and the Gulf, with appropriate subsidy, may conceivably be justified at a later date, and better facilities than m the past for the carriage of passengers will probably be required. As regards shipping communications with India, so long as foreign com- P petition can be excluded on this route, there would seem to be no ground for aiagrap favouring a monopoly. It is desirable that competition from India should nave free play in order that Indian trade may reap all possible benefit from the competition. Measures have been suggested with a view to meetino’ complaints, from shippers and consignees. ° ^ 89. The subsidiary measures required for developing and safe^uardin 0, Paragraphs 10 - 13 .

On the whole, Butish merchants seem to have retained the great advantage which thev denyed from their long start. German trade has now dropped to the bottom ^ dd or and, if the Resolutions of the Paris Conference are brought into effect, it will be unable to start climbing again for a period of years after the conclusion of peace. W hen this period comes to an end, however, it must be expected that German competition will re-appear in Mesopotamia as in other places. 90. The contrast between the methods of the British and German merchants must be ascribed very largely to deep-seated causes and was not peculiar to Basrah. The German political organisation and their system of education be held responsible for the high standard of business efficiency maintained by ^ the merchants;' A few suggestions of a general nature are ofiered tor the information of British firms who contemplate opening business ^ ® Gulf.

Scanty exports were due to the back ward condition of agriculture, which, in itself, is attributable mainly to the uncontrolled vagaries of the rivers, coupled with scarcity of labour and insecurity of life and property.

The main agricultural products of the Basrah Vilayat before the war Agriculture, were dates, rice, wdieat, barley, millet, melons, vegetables, fruit. It is estimated that the total area cultivated was about 350,000 acres, of which42 Paragraphs 34-38. Irrigation and river control. Paragraphs 39-42. Laboui and the Arab character. Paragraphs 43-45. 100 000 were under rice, 70,000 under barley, 30,000 under millet, 20,000 under wheat and 20,000 under vegetables. Date groves accounted for about 100 000 acres. These estimates must, however, be accepted vith great caution, since the data on which they are based are by no means reliable. The rice crop is of great value and capable of much expansion. The wheat exported came mostly from outside the Vilayat and the trade was subjec _ o remarkable fluctuations, owing to the uncertainty of the water-supply an e inadequate transport. Suggestions are offered with a view to improvement of the existing system of cultivation and handling of the crop. In some areas, agriculture has suffered severely from the insecurity of the cultivators tenure, and the matter needs careful consideration. The institution of an Agricultural Department at an early date is recommended. There is every reason, however, to hope that Mesopotamia has a future not only for wheat but for cotton. The soil and climate appear to be suitable for the cultivation of fine cottons and it is recommended that tests be made at an early opportunity with a view to ascertaining the suitable varieties tor adoption. 92. Next, with a view to the development of the agricultural possibilities of Mesopotamia, plans must be devised for the scientific control of the rivers, so as to prevent the damage now caused by inundation and to provide irriga tion for the redemption of the deserts. The problem involved is three-fold. Firstly, the successful, but economi cal, application of the water for irrigation purposes; secondly, the preser vation of the rivers as long as possible for navigation; and, thirdly, .he drainage of the swamps now in existence. It is recommended that no far-reaching measures be decided upon until a body of information has been collected which may enable sound conclusions to be drawn. It would advisable that an Irrigation Board, comprising at least two highly-qualified irrigation engineers, should now be constituted for the collection of detailed information in regard to the rivers and the existing canal systems with a view to frame recommendations for a restoration of the regime of the rivers. In the meanwhile, there would probably be no objection to proceeding under the Irrigation Board’s advice, with certain minor irrigation schemes which are not likely to prejudice the solution of the main problem of the two rivers, e.g&gt;, the Akhdhar channel and the Mendeli, Duwairij and Tib streams. 93. All schemes for the agricultural development and commercial exploita tion of the country are, however, conditioned and limited by the capacity, temperament and character of the inhabitants. The two Vilayats of Baghdad and Basrah are thinly populated, possessing an average of 9 inhabitants per square mile, which is inadequate for agricultural developments. Moreover,, the population is of a motley type, including peoples of diverse races and religions. There does not appear to be, however, any need for haste in adding to the population of Mesopotamia. Large irrigation schemes cannot be commenced for some years to come and the existing population, supplemented from neighbouring sources, will be sufficient, to begin with, for minor works- which it may be decided to undertake. The pastoral population, which is the backbone of the country, must be treated with special consideration, and irrigation schemes must be conceived so as to conserve for afforestation and pasturage large areas in addition to those under cultivation. Finally, the introduction of modern types of earth-working and agricultural machinery, worked under competent supervision by skilled labour, will deprive the labour question of a good deal of its urgency and importance. Canadians and Australians might find in Mesopotamia a field peculiarly suited to their talents and experience. Stress must be laid upon the organic connection which already exists between Mesopotamia and India. 94. The employment of Arab labour for military purposes on a large scale and under organised conditions has thrown a good deal of new r light on the Arab’s character and capacity for work. It seems likely that^ the indolence which has hitherto been one of his recognised characteristics was largely ascribable to environment.The development of the Arab will depend largely on the nature of the Paragraph 46. education provided in the Government schools, of which several have been instituted with the valuable assistance of the American Mission. In the High School, courses of vocational instruction are provided and in regard to this it is recommended that special efforts should be made to develope the commer cial and agricultural classes. 95. The disadvantages under which trade laboured before the war in the Paragraps 47-so. matter of communications are well-known. It is recommended that a tten- Commuaicatlons ‘ tion be concentrated, in the first place, on the institution of a regular and frequent steamer service between Basrah and Baghdad affording reasonable freights and entirely in British hands. In order to guard against the dangers inherent in a monopoly, it would seem desirable that Government should either be represented on the Board of the Company, or by some other means should exercise control over the maximum freights and passenger rates to be charged by the Company. Secondly, in view of the paramount importance of the Baghdad-Kermanshah trade, a railway should be constructed between Baghdad and Khaniqin at the earliest possible moment. Such railway construction as has taken place in the occupied territories has been governed purely by military considerations, but post-war developments will require cautious con sideration. It is therefore recommended in the third place that a Communi cations Board be constituted to work out schemes for the country as a corporate whole with a view to the co-ordination of traffic by river, canal, rail and road. Fourthly, special attention should be paid to the possibility of canalising the river Tigris for navigation as far as possible along the stretches which are at present difficult to negotiate (e.c)., the Narrows) and which may be expected to deteriorate further, as irrigation developes. 96. There were no industries of importance in Mesopotamia before the Paragraphs 51 - 53 . war, but the cultivation of the silk worm, formely very successful ne ar ^ e c 8 ouomic P° sslbili ‘ Baghdad, is capable of revival. The deputation of a qualified silk expert is recommended. The preparation of hides and skins for export with the aid of tanning products from India should be profitable. There appears to be good promise of a dried fruit industry and the oranges grown in Upper Mesopotamia should be welcome in India. Expert investigation is recommended in regard to the possibility of producing a wine grape and of cultivating beetroot on a large scale for the manufacture of sugar. The possiblities of sheep farming in Mesopotamia are prodigious, since not only the wool but the skins are known and approved in European Markets. There should be a large export of hides and skins. The oil “shows” in Northern Mesopotamia are very promising. It is recommended that the fields should be developed primarily for providing oil for consumption in the country at a reasonable price, since otherwise the wells may be exploited for the benefit of existing oil companies. Tree-planting on the banks of rivers and canals should be taken in hand at once and an experienced officer should be deputed to report on the question of afforesta tion. 97. Having regard to the anticipated opening for oil fuel, Mesopotamia paragraphs 55-56. should offer a wonderful field for engineering enterprise, and especilly for the sale of modern ploughs and other agricultural machinery for the use of which the country is ideally suited. The Arab’s standard of living is already rising, and after the war there will be a large demand for domestic furniture and articles of personal apparel both for men and women. Cheap goods will no doubt hold the field for some time to come, especially as regards china, glass ware, ironware, enamel vvare, paper and matches. Spades of the native pattern are in great demand and also cheap lanterns and lamps. As the purchasing power of the people increases, a demand for better quality articles will develope. The sugar trade needs careful watching in view of the uses to which it was put by the Germans. The Mesopotamian demand for timber, not only for date boxes but for oil cases and for building, should be supplied from India. Important openings for trade may be expected in connection with town development—building materials, plant for sanitation, water-supply, electric lighting, etc.44 Paragraphs 57-60. Foreign competition. Paragraphs 61-63. Banking. Paragraphs 64-66. Currency. Paragraphs 67-71. Total trade and Russian competition. Paragraphs 72-77. Communications. Paragraph 77. The importance o£ the Ahwaz-lspahan route. Paragraphs 78-81. Other conditions necessary for development of trade. 98. Special facilities might be arranged for British shipping and merchants in connection with the management of the port administration, the customs’ warehouses and inland transport. British ship-owners and merchants will doubtless be given facilities for securing the most favourable sites available for mercantile purposes and British steamers might have preference over foreign steamers in the matter of berths or loading facilities. 99. At present, three banks are represented in Basrah and another Indian bank proposes to enter the field. It was alleged in the past that English banks had failed to finance the exporter in the same way that German banks did, and it is understood that a British Trade Corporation is to be established with the object of developing British trade abroad. Agriculture in Mesopotamia will require careful financial nursing, but, before any system of agricultural credit is created, it would seem desirable that the features both of the social structure and of the administration in Mesopotamia should be carefully compared with those obtaining in India and Egypt. 100. Indian coin and notes now circulate on the same footing as in India. Great quantities of Indian notes have been absorbed. Inconvenience has been caused owing to the temporary appreciation in the value of the Persian kran. Owing to Mesopotamia’s proximity to India and the intimate business connec tions between the two countries, the Indian rupee should continue to be current. Persia. 101. The customs figures for 1913-14 show that the total trade of Persia was over twenty million sterling of which Russia’s share was nearly twelve millions and the British and Indian share four and a quarter millions. German competi tion was negligible except in Arabistan. Mr. George Lloyd, writing in July 1916, took a gloomy view of the situation and thought that British trade was being steadily ousted by Russian. This opinion does not seem entirely well- founded. The progress of Russian trade has been natural and uniform and, owing to Russia’s natural advantages her trade is bound to increase in the north more than twice as fast as British trade in the south. 102. British trade is dependent, in the first place, upon communications. The four main routes are :— (1) Baghdad to Kermanshah. (2) Mohammerah to Ahwaz and Ispahan. (3) Bushire to Ispahan. (4) Bandar Abbas to Kerman. Three at least of these routes might be expected to develope a considerably greater trade if cart or rail transport could be substituted for pack animals. The construction of railways in Persia is, however, complicated by political considerations. It is of high importance that measures should be taken to facilitate the transport of goods by route No. (2) and by route No. (3) between Bushire and Shiraz. If the construction of railways is out of the question, endeavours should be made to provide other means of transport than pack animals which are becoming very scarce. 103. Other essential conditions for the improvement of trade are :— (а) The introduction of a settled administration. (б) Amelioration of the customs tariff. The duties on tea, spices, indigo, rice and coffee are certainly too high and reductions of duties on spirits, wines and certain articles of European consumption might also be asked for. (c) Improved arrangements for the collection of commercial intelligence and the representation of trade interests. It is recommended that, so long as the consular service in south and west Persia is manned from the Political Department of the Government of India, there should be at least two additional appointments to beI I.. I' . ■ S f 1 r i 45 held by commercial experts for the representation of trade interests and the collection of commercial intelligence. It is also recommended that Persian experience should be regarded as an essential qualification for appointment to the office of the Director of the Persian section of the London Commercial Bureau, if such an appointment is created. (d) The encouragement of education by the institution of schools. (e) Improvement of business methods. ( /) Recommendations have been made in the past for the creation of a separate lighterage company to work at the various ports m e Gulf. The British India Company have largely solved their own difficulties in respect of lighterage and, as they would be unwilling to join in any combination, it would not seem advisable to pursue the idea. n t» t,* Paragraph 82. 104. Special notes have been prepared regarding the ports ot Dushire, Busire Lingah and Lingah and Bandar Abbas. As regards Lingah, it is recommended EaDdar (a) That agreements be made with Sheikhs on the Persian Coast for the reservation of the supply of pearl shells for British firms. (5) That the landing arrangements be improved by enlisting Persian capital for extension of the two boat basins. (c) That the question of opening a branch bank be considered. As regards Bandar Abbas, it is recommended: (a) That encouragement be given for the formation of a company for the extension and improvement of the pier and the Customs House arrangements. (b) That a branch bank be opened. British commercial interests at the remaining port of Mohammerah are Arabistan. dependent on the political situation in Arabistan. The Commissioners have a firm belief in the economic possibilities of Arabistan under favourable political conditions. . , „ , 105. The Imperial Bank of Persia will doubtless after the war, take into and - consideration the question of opening branches at Bandar a ^ d y iztul Nuking, and possibly Lingah. Trade would probably benefit if an Indian bank of good standing decided to open branches at the Gulf ports. Po?'ts on the Arabian coast. 106. Separate notes have been prepared regarding trade at the ports of Kuwait, Bahrain and Maskat. Stress is laid on the importance of a pioper examination of the pearl beds within territorial waters on the Arab coast, ilie potentialities of trade with the interior of Arabia should also be investi D ated.APPENDICES.49 APPENDIX No. I. ANALYSIS OF MR. G. LLOYD'S REPORT, DATED 1908. The following is an analysis of those portions of Mr. George Lloyd’s Report, dated 1908, which have a bearing on the conditions and prospects of British trade in Mesopotamia after the war. The inlets for British trade into Mesopotamia and Eastern Asiatic Turkey are Basrah, Inlets f or British Alexandretta and Trebizond. The parts of Mesopotamia, with which British commercial trade, interests are most concerned, are those that are served by the Basrah trade inlet, that is to say by the Persian Gulf route. No proper Turkish customs statistics were maintained and the following figures, which foreign were compiled from manifests and bills of lading, must not be regarded as exhaustively trade at accurate. The total foreign trade at Basrah in the year 1906, imports and exports, was Basrah. £3 155,000. Of the imports, which were £1,511,000, the local trade of Basrah accounted for only about one quarter, as the bulk of the import business done in Basrah is in the agency and forwarding line. Most Baghdad, Persian and Indian firms trading in Baghdad have agents in Basrah, who consign their goods to Baghdad and take charge of outward shipments when necessary. Of the exports, which were £1,644,000, thus exceeding imports, dates from Basrah represented £436,500, barley £192,700, ghee £25,300, horses £43,500, liquorice £27,400, opium £110,71)0, seeds £116,500, wheat £106,600 and wool £250,200. The requirements of the inhabitants of Baghdad have hitherto been comparatively limited, but its importance lies in the fact that it is a large collecting and distributing centre for a very large area, which includes central and even northern Persia, Turkish Arabia, and a vast tract of country undeveloped up to now but which already carries a large roving popula tion, who have wants to be supplied and money wherewith to satisfy them. The main trade routes from Baghdad are (1) Baghdad to Mosul vid (ci) Kerkouk and Erbil and ($) Samarra and Tekrit, with an Branch routes from extension to Sairt, Bitlis and Erzeroum. The greater part of the import trade Baghdad, with Mosul and the whole of the export trade is done vid Baghdad. Mosul is a large and important centre for the collection and sale of natural produce fiom the rich country in the hills to the north of it. It is destined to increase in importance and to make further demands on the resources of the country round Bitlis, Van and Sairt. The best oil springs of Mesopotamia are within reach of the Baghdad-Mosul route, which should also tap the grain produce from the valleys and rich slopes of the Persian hills.

The marginal table shows the imports to Kermanshah for 1916, vid Khani kin. (3) Baghdad to Aleppo—the most direct trade route between Baghdad and the Mediterranean and for Kerbala and Hillab. From 80,000 to 100,000 pilgrims pass over this route every year. In 1906, the total trade of Baghdad, including transit trade with Persia, amounted to £2 705 000 of which exports were only £837,000. The main items of import to Baghdad from Europe were cotton piece-goods and twist £874,700, sugar £347,100, hardware £66,500; and from India, the Persian Gulf and China, gunnies £20,300, pepper £24,100, piece-goods £46 200 silk £29,500, tea £24,100 and twist £42,100. The chief America were wool £356,300, skins and hides £126,500, gum £84,700, £32,500, wheat £29,600; and to India and China, dates £17,400, wheat £23,600. exports to Europe and carpets £30,800, gall* opium £67,600, and Total trade of Baghdad.50 British imports and exports. 'British imports into Basrah and Baghdad were chiefly cotton goods and twist and hard ware. In piece-goods^ prints, muslins, chintz, etc., England and India had long had the monopoly. Copper and tin were imported from England and India only. India also imported indigo, tea, pepper, jute, drugs, soap, coffee and wood. British exports, other than dates, were chiefly cereals, and, at first, practically all the shippers of grain were British, the only exceptions being two native firms, who did business on a large scale. The marginal table shows the average value of grain exported from Basrah during the years 1900-1905. Exports to India were also horses, galls, millet, ghee, sheep skins, opium, maize, dates and gnm. Barley Bice and paddy Wheat Sesame Seeds Total 234.281 15,622 36,997 3.377 87,829 378,106 British shipping. Foreign competition. Effective German trade methods. Competition from goods of other foreign counties. The dominant influences affecting Baghdad trade are to be found in Basrah, namely, in the ocean freights to that place, in the facilities for, or obstructions to, the import or export of merchandise of the port, and in the river freights obtainable from Basrah to Baghdad. England’s victory in the struggles with the Dutch and the Portuguese during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for the Persian Gulf trade gave her an all-powerful position at Basrah. That position was still further strength ened by the fact that British merchant vessels secured by treaty, usage, and early grants the right to navigate the Mesopo tamian rivers. In 1906, five out of the seven regular lines of steamers calling at the port of Basrah were British, and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Com pany was the only foreign company which had the right to run steamers between Basrah and Baghdad. The marginally noted table shows the shipping at the port of Basrah during the year 1906. The only rivals of England as regards transport to Basrah were Russia and Germanv. Russian ships traded only between Odessa and the Gulf, but German ships called at various continental ports and threatened to call at British ports also. Russian competition was not formidable, but Germany was building up a steadily increasing trade in a great varietv of articles, and especially hardware. The larger portion of German trade was in the cheapest quality of goods, such as china, mirrors, hosiery, etc .; but she was also taking a rapidly incieasing share in the hardware, iron and steel trades. The tastes and fashions of people at aghdad followed the continent and not England. Further, German ships were beginning to secure the transport of Austrian, German and Belgian sugar which had previousiy been in British hands. v j German manufacturers secured the trade for the following reasons:— (1) They realised the fact that there existed in the East a market for cheap, low- quality, as well as for expensive, high quality, goods and that the main demand was for the cheap, low quality. (2) German merchants studied the natives their language, habits, etc., more closely than the British merchants did, and made a point of acquiring a personal acquaintance with their coustomers which enabled them to offer with safety longer credit than their rivals. (3) German merchants were willing to deal in any every article, to take small orders and to have new patterns made to please customers. (4) German merchants obtained more elaborate show cases and ranges of samples than the English. (5) German merchents quoted in local currency, written in Arabic, and made full use of the aptitude for commercial transactions found in the Armenian and the Jew. (6j German merchants were able, whatever the reason, to offer lower rates of freight by German ships than British merchants could offer by British lines. Other instances of Successful foreign competition were the following;— (1) Italian cotton goods competed with Manchester and Bombay products at Mosul. Nationality. Sailing. Steam. Total.

(3) Pottery imports were chiefly of Russian or Austrian origin. A large trade in coffee cups was done by Russia via Basrah. (4) British biscuits were being imitated by a biscuit of Hambourg make. (5) Paper of all sorts came from Germany and Austria; none from England. (6) Italian grey textiles were increasing in favour, being said to be better in quality than those from Manchester, though slightly higher in price. (7) Cotton blankets imported were of Dutch origin. (8) Gauze tissues were mainly imported from France. (9) Italian cotton yarns were sold in the Mosul market. (10) Austrian linen was preferred to English in Baghdad, as its quality was superior and it was said to stand washing much better. (11) Cotton handkerchiefs and muslins were imported from Switzerland. (12) Japanese cotton was gaining a footing. (13) Foreign silk tissues were coming more and more from eastern ports at the expense of Basrah, on account of the continental fashions set in Constantinople and the importance of continental firms in the Constantinople market. (14) Date-box wood came chiefly from Fiume and Galatz, and Russian white wood seemed likely to gain a firm footing. American competition in timber was expected to commence before long. England had hitherto held here own in the “ Manchester ” trade, but there were signs that, in the near future, severe competition would be encountered from Italy and Japan. The following are some of the reasons suggested for the failure of British firms to cope Reasons for deteri- with foreign competition oration of British trade. (1) The British traders refused to look for new lines of business. They were satisfied with the profits which they were making in the cotton trade and in the export of native products and would not take up small lines or experiment in the intro duction of cheap goods at a small margin of profit. (2) British merchandise was imitated shamelessly and openly. (3) The British shipper and importer, whose dealings were mainly with Baghdad, appeared not to recognise fully that the volume of trade in Baghdad was largely at the mercy of the prevailing influences in Basrah. Latterly, however, there had been a tendency on the part of the consignors to despatch wares to Basrah for sale there in the event of a favourable market, or for despatch to Baghdad if expedient. (4) British firms ignored the fact that, if cheaper continental manufactures, especially German, acquired a footing in Mesopotamia, it would be difficult to dislodge them, and the inflow of continental wares into Persia would, in time, foster a taste for them to the detriment of British manufactures there also. (5) Dealers in the Baghdad market complained that English manufacturers would not send samples of cotton clothing, even when asked to do so, because they were too busy to care about the market, or to attend to the question of the gaudy designs and colouring required. Mr. Lloyd recommended that British merchants should strengthen their position by Recommendations more general trading, that is to say, that, while maintaining their close watch and attention for improvement in on Manchester goods, the more important firms should set aside for a few years proportion of metho(1&gt; their profits for the purpose of the trade in hardware, fancy goods and quineaillerie. They should insist upon cheap, low class goods being manufactured for them, and, wherever possible, should co-operate in keeping the supply of country produce for export in British hands. Baghdad might be made an almost exclusively British Market, if the trading were all round trading and not based, as formerly, on Manchester goods alone. The British Manufacturer and merchant should study the needs of the market by sending out travellers to report on local requirements, by the circulation of catalogues printed in Arabic, and by supplying the people with what they want. The experience which firms could gain in selling small quantities of cheap goods in this market, would be very valuable and would enable them to obtain extensive knowledge of the methods, currency, demands, etc., of the market as well as to get in touch with the small traders, who, beginning in a small way of bussiness, often developed their connection very rapidly. Fraudulent imitation might be prevented by some system of standard trade mark. Advertising, properly conducted, would be of great service to trade. Advertisements and posters to be printed in Arabic, in bright colours, with sketches of eastern subjects in illustration of articles on sale. Ingenious advertisement, if properly done, should produce very remunerative results. Every business communication should be in a language suitable to the country dealt with. Attention should be paid to the Constantinople market, to which the native buyer from provincial towns makes an annual prilgrimage to buy his year's stock. The buyer was apt to deal with large, general, wholesale supply establishments52 maintained by Germans because he did not know his way about while in the Capital and because he could thus buy all his supplies under one roof. Facilities should be given to buyers to see samples before they place their orders. Finally British transport communications with the Persian Gulf should be maintained in an effective and satisfactory condition. High rates for ocean and river freight had handicaped British trade in the past. Given good government and reasonable security for life and property^ Mesopotamia should immediately attract foreign capital for irrigation, and road and rail construction, as '&lt; well as for minerals and oil, and the potentialities of the country for agricultural development, specially in the matter of wheat and cotton should then be magnificent. .Such development might be expected to induce a change in the character of the Arab inhabitants, who are intelli gent, adaptable, and desirous of progress and also to increase largely their purchasing power, especially in the neighbourhood of the towns. Agricultural machines and labour saving appliances would be in demand. Baghdad and Basrah are destined to be increasingly important^ both as distributing centres and as intrinsic markets.APPENDIX No. II* * THE INDIAN TEA TRADE WITH PERSIA. 1. Under the Commercial Convention of 1903 between the United Kingdom and Persia, the duty imposed on tea was [a) on yellow or pale tea, 18 krans per batman, and {b) on ah other teas, 12 krans per batman. The Persian Government was empowered to reduce these rates 6 krans per batman. Teas falling within category (a) are principally of foreign origin, all Indian tea coming under the second specification. The reduction of duty on Indian teas to 6 krans per 0^ lbs. appeared to have followed close after the introduction of the tariff: of 1903. 2. In 1909 and 1912, it was reported that the prices of the different Calcutta teas import ed into Southern Persia ranged from 4^ to 6^ and 7 annas per lb. and that the duty on Indian teas varied from 64 per cent, to 100 per cent, according to the prevailing rate of exchange between the British and Persian currencies. After cotton goods and sugar, the most important article of import to Persia was tea. 3. The Anglo-Persian tariff of 1903 had always been regarded as unfavourable to Britain, while benefiting 0 Russia, but Indian tea was particularly hard hit. The Persian Customs returns showed a steady decrease in the imports of Indian teas into Persia, and the heavy tariff was, doubtless, largely accountable for the decline in this trade. Statistics showed that considerable quantities of tea were exported from India to the Arab ports of Bahrein, Koweit, Dibai and Shargah (where the import duty ranged from 4 to 10 per cent.), and they were, no doubt, thence smuggled across in native craft to the Persian Coast. I here is reason to sup pose that the smuggling of tea from Koweit and the Basrah Vilayat is now very prevalent. It seemed probable that of the total imports of tea via the Gulf into Persia during 1910- 1911 not less than l-3rd was smuggled, while about 2-3rds was legitimately passed through the Customs. 4. It is clearly in the interests not only of the Indian tea trade but also of Persia's foreign trade and her revenues that smuggling should be stopped. The Persian measures for the suppression of smuggling, viz., the service of preventive launches and the posting of Customs officials along the coast, have proved ineffective. The solution recommended by the Resident at Bushire was the reduction of the duty on tea 10 to 15 per cent, ad valorem. It was believed that this reduction, while putting an end to smuggling, would not adversely affect the Persian Customs receipts, since it ought to result in increased receipts by direct imports. Further statistics, compiled in 1912, showed a continued diminution in the supply of Indian tea to Bushire. The most striking feature in the figures was the complete reversal of the position of two years ago, when Indian tea held a practical monopoly of the impoit to the Gulf From 79 per cent, of the imports of tea through Bandar Abbas, Bushire and Moham- merah, Indian tea had shrunk to 40 per cent, in the year 1911-1912, its place having been largely taken by Java (Lamseh) tea. 5. The reasons adduced for the greatly increased import of Lamseh tea were (1) the rise in the price of the Calcutta tea; (2) a growing preference for Lamseh tea ; (3) the tea smuggled to the Persian Coast was all Calcutta and China tea not Lamseh (Batavian) tea; (1) the packing of Lamseh tea chests in skins for transport to the interior had to be done on arrival at the port, whereas Indian and China tea chests were wrapped in skins before despatchsto Persia. Imports of Java tea were, therefore, necessarily recorded by theUustoms, while this was not the case with other smuggled teas; (5) the increasing demand for tea in Persia. Representations on the subject of a reduction of the duty were made to the Persian Government, but while efforts were being made to free India’s tea trade from the excessive tariff in Southern Persia, Russian officials were endeavouring to strangle it in the north by officially discouraging merchants from trading with India. The matter was brought to the knowledge of the Russian Government through the British Ambassador at Petrograd. 6. In September 1913, the Resident at Bushire furnished the following figures to _ show the expensiveness of steamer freight charged on the transit of tea from India to Persia, as compared with the rates from India to Batoum (1) From Calcutta to Bushire . . • Rs. 35 per ton of 50 cubic feet. (2) From Calcutta to Baghdad [i.e., for Kerman- „ 45 ditto ditto. shah import). (3) From Calcutta to Bushire (with transhipment Rs. 43£ to Rs. 47 per ton of 40 cubic at Bombay). feet - * Compiled from Government of India records.54 (4) From Calcutta to Batoum by Austrian Lloyd Rs. 31 per ton. line. (5) By French Messageries line . . • » 28 4o. (6) By Peninsular and Oriental and City lines „ 40 do. ' and Conference steamers. Further fio-ures showed that the exports of tea from India to Persia via the Persian Gulf which rose from £75,131 in 1911-1'2 to £99,816 in 1912-13, bad fallen to £73,222 during ^ 1913-14 The decrease seemed due to the diversion of Indian, Batavian and Chinese teas to Persia via the Batoum route. This diversion had recently been encouraged by the opening of the Batoum-Baku, Batoum-Tabriz and Batoum-Mashad routes to this trade, and it appeared likely that the high shipping freights from India to the Gulf, as compared with those from India to Batoum, had something to do with it. 7. In May 1914, Sir Edward Grey expressed doubt whether the Persian Government would, or could, reduce the duty on Indian tea without the consent of the Russian Govern ment. who were a party to the agreement of 1903, and he feared that in the event of its being lowered, the Russian Government might demand reductions of the duty on goods in which they were specially interested. Tea was the only British import into Persia which the Russian Government had treated favourably in allowing entry via the Black Sea and the north of Persia, and it seemed probable that the return, which Russia would probably demand for the proposed concession on this article might be in the end more prejudicial to British interests than the maintenance of the existing rate of duty on tea. 8. In reply to communications addressed to them by the Government of India in June 1914, Messrs. Mackinnon, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Managing Agents in India of the British India Steam Navigation Company, and the India Tea Association expressed the view that the difference between the cost of tea transported into the interior of Persia via the Persian Gulf and Black Sea routes was chiefly due to the higher overland rates in the case of consignments via the Gulf, the discrepancy between the sea rates being negligible by comparison. In August 1914, the Government of India invited the views of the Resident in the Persian Gulf in the matter in the light of the remarks made by Messrs. Mackinnon, and Mackenzie &amp; Co., but, owing to the outbreak of war, nothing further was done. 9. Competition with the Batoum route was handicapped by the fact that the principal tea consuming districts in Persia are in the north and are, therefore, more easily accessible via Batoum. Russian merchants also got cheap rates of freight by the Batoum-Baku railway and were allowed to transport the tea in bond and keep it in bond till it was sold. At the same time, they could pay the Indian shipper before they sold the tea, whereas tea going by the Gulf has to be transported a long way inland before it can be sold, which is expensive in itself and complicates the finance. Since the closure of the Batoum route, owing to the war, the import of tea through the Gulf Ports has very greatly increased, 1,670 tons having been imported at Bushire in 1915-1916, as against 170 tons in 1913-1914,APPENDIX No. III. THE SALE OF TIMBER IN MESOPOTAMIA. 1. Before the war, a considerable trade was done in Austrian timber from Bukovina by the Russian subsidised line. The freight was only 14 francs a ton from Odessa to Basrah, and the railway freight from Czernovitz to Bukovina was comparatively light. The commercial section of the Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company were anxious to arrange that Russian, and not Austrain, timber should be exported from Odessa, but, although timber of suitable kinds was actually available, the industry in Russia was not sufficiently developed to enable the trade to provide the sizes and kinds of timber required. The only timber from the East which could compete against Austrian timber, i.e., the so-colled Russian pine shipped from Odessa, is timber from the Straits Settlements, known in Basrah as Javi. 2. The freight charged by the British India Steam Navigation Company on timber exported from Singapore to Basrah was Rs. 35 a ton as compared with 14 francs a ton from Odessa. The British India line’s ton was 40 cubic feet as against 33 cubic feet by the Russian line. Endeavours were made by a Basrah merchant to charter a steamer from the British India Company specially for the conveyance of timber from Singapore to Basrah at the rate of Rs. 25 a ton, but the negotiations came to nothing. The Singapore wood was used for construction work only. In India, deal wood can be obtained only in small quantities and in districts where no saw-mills exist. 3. The requirements of the date trade were supplied exclusively from Sweden and Fiume and, in former years, from Galatz. The Odessa wood was found to be unsuitable for date boxes. Malabar wood has not hitherto been employed for date boxes, but only imported by Arabs for building boats and it is brought, roughly sawn into the shapes and sizes required, in their own craft, uninsured. Negotiations, which have been undertaken for the supply of construction timber from Malabar to Basrah have hitherto failed, because of the lack of shipping facilities and also in consequence of the difficulty experienced in arranging for the insurance of cargoes of native boats. 4. In 1911, the Resident in the Persian Gulf asked the Government of India to move the British India Steam Navigation Company to accord for date-box wood the lowest possible freights between the Malabar coast and Basrah, but the Government of India at that time considered that any intervention on their part would be impolitic. In 1913, Sir Percy Cox again addressed Government on the subject, in connection with the rapid development of German competition in the Gulf. German vessels, in 1912, imported 173,000 date boxes, and the value of date-box wood imported to Basrah was stated, in 1911, to be £120,500 for Basrah alone. Mr. Strickland, Agent to the Government of Mysore, Forest Department, with the approval and support of the Mysore Durbar, made efforts to develope the export of timber from the Mysore forest and he sent a trial shipment of 1,000 date boxes in 1912 to Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., Basrah. The shipment was unfavourably reported on by the firm as the boxes were inferior in quality to the Swedish boxes and probably also inferior to those from Fiume. The wood was not quite white, and it shrank and split more than the European woods. The Indian wood had the further disadvantage of being somewhat heavier, resulting in the merchant having to pay slightly higher freight both on its import into Basrah and on its export again in the shape of boxes full of dates. Again, there was not the perfection of workmanship, and the tongueing and grooving was not so accurately done as in the European-made box. Each side of the box should be of one piece of wood, or, in the alternative, the pieces of plank composing the box should be joined together in the most perfect manner possible. A trader in Karachi recently sent to Basrah a sample box, constructed of excellent Indian pine wood, but the planks used were sawn in such a way as to make it clear that the object of the manufac turer was, regardless of the waste of timber, to form each side of the box with one piece of wood so as to avoid the necessity of having to join pieces. As regards the Mysore wood, if appeared further that the State Forest Department were unable to turn out large quantities of the cases and, thus, were not in a position to arrange a special charter of freight from India to cheapen the cost of transit. Nor could they supply the accessories with the boxes, but it was suggested that the accessories could be made in Great Britain and imported separately. 5. Mr. Strickland was inclined to believe that experience would overcome these difficulties, and said that he could see his way to start sawing with water power with river carriage to the coast, and he had also arranged for sufficient funds to erect a considerable sawing plant, pro vided that success appeared likely. He was very anxious to continue the experiment, but he received no encouragement. In 1914, the Resident in the Persian Gulf again addressed the Government of India on the subject, and asked that the Mysore Durbar might be invited to give special attention to the matter. He also suggested that a qualified agent might be deputed to study the Gulf markets for wood. He gave figures to show that timber of the value of £210,000 was imported at various ports in the Gulf during the year 1911-12. He pointed out that date boxes were the biggest ^ item in the wood trade in* the Gulf at the moment, but that there were other large items beginning to develope, such as the Baghdad56 railway demand; the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s demand at Abadan; and the ordinary demand for timber for house and boat building at all places in the Gulf from Maskat up to Baghdad. A Baghdad merchant suggested that; if the Mysore Forest Department really wished to open up the market; they might start by establishing small depots at the various ports in the Gulf which seemed to promise well. 6. The Indian timber trade should be in a position to supply boxes in large quantities suitable for date packing; if the necessary machinery were installed. The imports of timber into Basrah have very greatly increased since the war began, owing to a heavy demand in connection with construction work. This demand is likely to persist to a large extent after the war; and it seems important, particularly in view of further possible competition from Japan and America, that India should, if possible, be in a position to capture the greater part of the trade.APPENDIX No. IV. BRITISH AND RUSSIAN TRADE IN PERSIA (1904-05). The following is a brief analysis of the reports of Mr. H. W. Maclean and Mr. A. H. Gleadowe-Newcomen, dated 1903 and 1906 respectively, on British and Russian trade in Persia. The foreign commerce of Persia, both import and export, had steadily increased during the decade 1892-1902 to the extent of, perhaps, 20 per cent- The value of the total °trade for 1903-04 was 10£ million sterling. Russia had acquired a large share of this increase in trade her total being 54 millions whilst British trade, 2£ millions, had made little or no progress. The development of Russian trade seemed attributable to the following facts:— (1) The most cultivated, populous and prosperous provinces of Persia lay nearer to th e Caspian than to the Persian Gulf. The opening of the Trans-Caspian Railway provided an outlet for the produce of the fertile province of Khorasan, which could not afford the long and costly transport to the Gulf. (2) The manufacturing centres of Russia had been brought gradually nearer to the Persian markets by improved steamer and rail communications. Russian merchandise arrived in the markets of Northern Persia, perhaps, three months or less from date of order, whilst British goods could seldom reach the same destinations within five, or even six months of order. * (3) (a) The new Customs Tariff, to which India had had to submit, had been very carefully drawn up by Russia to ensure practically free entry for her own goods and the imposition of unfairly high duties on goods imported from the British Empire. It was equivalent to an ad valorem scale of nearly 3J per cent, on Russian trade, but on British trade of a little over 94 per cent., and on trade with all other countries together of over 10 per cent. Some of the chief items of Persian produce taken by the British Empire were wheat, grain, linseed, seasame and opium. On all of these the new tariff increased taxation from o| to 20 per cent., whilst, at the same time, exports taken almost entirely by Russia, such as, rice and cotton, were freed from all taxation or had the taxation reduced to a nominal amount. It was the same with imports, since Indian tea, which was formerly taxed at 5 per cent, ad valorem, was . burdened with a taxation of 6 krans per batman, the incidence of taxation varying from 50 to 90 per cent. Under the old svstem of taxation by value, British goods, which were less costly at the ports of entry than Russian goods, as a rule, got in more cheaply than Russian, Under the new system, a ton of cheap British piece goods ^ paid the same duty as a ton of dear Russian goods of the same kind. The new tariff was based on an extremely complicated system, as opposed to the old and simple method of taxation by value. (£) Persia was protected by the 5 per cent, ad valorem f duties of the^ Turkomanchai Treaty against the formidable customs tariff, imposed by Russia on the import of many foreign commodities. Fruits exported info Russia paid duty at the rate of 25 marks per poud when coming from Persia, and rouble PSO per • pound when coming from other countries. Raw cotton from Persia had a similar advantage, paying 40 kopecks per pound as against 4T6 per poud from other countries. (c) The RZglement Legal was in some ways prejudicial to the trade of the ports in V the ^Persian Gulf. Unnecessary stamp fees were collected and vexatious restrictions were imposed. Notifications were seldom circulated, but were merely posted in the Customs House, being, as a rule, printed or written in French only, instead of in Persian, English and French. Correspondence also had to be in French, and exchange in the case of British money was calculated through the medium of the franc, instead of direct, as in the case of Russian coinage, by taking so many krans as equal to a rouble. (i) Illegal imports on trade, such as, rahdari and dalali, which were supposed to have been abolished, continued to exist. (4) Russia with a full realisation of the fact that an increase in exports causes an v ‘ increase in imports, had further taken special measures to encourage the import into Persia of her manufactures. (a') Special through rsEtes were granted for goods going to Persia. A steamship line 1 from the Persian Gulf to Odessa had a subsidy of about £20,000 a year, which meant that the Russian shipper had an advantage over the British shipper of 12 to 15 shillings per ton weight on cotton goods to Bushire. Canal dues were also refunded.58 m The operations of the Banque dePre'ts de Perse * had a marked effect in increasing v ; r Russian trade with Tersia. The * Now Banque d'Bscomptes. Bank was to some extent indepen dent of current profits, since it was connected with the Russian ^ State Bank. It devoted particular attention to the import of Russian cotton textiles and came to the assistance of merchants, who could not afford to pay customs duties and dues immediately. It made a practice of taking up the invoices and clearing and warehousing the goods, charging only 2 per cent, commission. _ Mr. Maclean noted that, if a certain Russian firm, which had been established m Ispahan for two years 9 past, succeeded in establishing a business in cotton prints and tissues dependent on ordinary mercantile profits, then there was no reason why Russian manufacturers should not be able to compete with Manchester in all parts of Persia, and even in Mesopotamia and India, since the cost of transport from Moscow to Ispahan, via Enzeli or via Bushire (with State-aided freight), was about the same. (c) (d) (5) drawback of duties previously imposed was granted in Russia on certain com- Cotton linen tetiles, gr.in, froit, eugar, modifies sported toPersia Sagar matches, petroleum, tea and tobacco passed in transit which formed quite one-halt OJ the and obtained refund of excise. total imports into Persia from Russia, got a refund of rouble 1*75 per pound. Cotton tissues, which formed one-fourth of such imports, got a refund of excise. The Russian manufacturer catered for a large population in Russia, with require ments similar to those of a large section of the Persian population, and, there fore, did not need to manufacture expressly to suit the Persian market. Russia's manufacturing skill had also made great progress of recent years. The disappearance of grain exports from the southern provinces, owing to prolonged agricultural depression and hampering restrictions on the cultivators, had affected British trade prejudicially, because these regions with good harvests would have brought manufactured articles from Britain with their surplus agri cultural wealth. Much of the southern and eastern regions had but scant irrigation and little rainfall, and the turbulent nature of the inhabitants prevented agricultural or industrial progress. The following suggestions were made for the improvement of British trade (1) That bonded warehouses, private or Government, should be erected at Bandar Abbas, Bushire and Mohammerah, in order to enable stocks to be kept at these ports at small cost. This would mean an enormous saving in interest and in money locked up, involving, in the case of certain grades of tea, as much as 100 per cent. The erection of private bonded warehouses was provided for in the Replement Legal. (2) That Indian traders and manufacturers, who had hitherto, to all intents and purposes, neglected to investigate and cater for the wants of Persia, or to enquire into its productive possibilities, should set themselves to study the market and to supply exactly the Persians' requirements. Goods to be marked plainly in the Persian character, and catalogues and price lists to be printed in the Persian language. Prices to be in rupees at the factory, and c. i. f. Bandar Abbas and Bushire. All correspondence to be conducted in Persian. It was suggested that Persian and Persee youths, studying in India, should be taken on tour to the great modern manufacturing oentres and interested in the products of India. (3) That special attention should be directed to the following items l— (a) Sugar, which comprised one-half of the Russian exports to Persia.. Indian sugar, both crystal and loaf, might compete on favourable terms with and rescue the market from the French, Egyptian, Austrian and Belgian sugars, which flooded the whole of Southern Persia, even as far north as Hamadan, Ispahan and Yezd. {b) Tea. The Persian taste had been educated to appreciate light liquored teas only, and Indian trade might be largely developed by shipping a moderately priced and light liquored article. (e) Yarns and twists. India might improve her already firm position, if she could manufacture some finer grades. (d) Cotton goods and prints and woollens. The trade might be largely developed by careful study of requirements. [e) Persian exports, comprising dry fruit, raw cotton, opium, rice, gums and dyeing materials, were capable of great improvement, especially the last two.(4) That special rates for freight subsidies and rebates should be given, if necessary^in order to oust Rusian goods, where they came into competition with British goods: that shipping companies and railways should do their share by granting special and reduced through rates for goods intended for Bandar Abbas and Bushire. (5) That the Imperial Bank of Persia should open more branches, for instance, at Bandar Abbas and Bam. The bank might well follow the example of the Russian Bank and assist the Persian trader in the matter of customs dues; also by keeping price lists and samples, by accepting and filling orders, and by clearing and warehousing goods. (6) That the British consular system should be improved— (a) That all consular officers should have an intimate acquaintance with customs methods, should understand business transactions, and should be acquainted with Persian and French. (S) That newly joined officers should be attached to the headquarters of a Consul General for at least one year, in order to learn their work, (e) That consular reports should contain clear information as to what classes of goods were required in the various markets, showing the qualities and ruling freights, together with particulars of competition likely to be encountered. {d) That a Commercial Attach^ should be appointed at Tehran, and it should be his business to carefully study and record all foreign trade competi tion, routes, etc. (e) That sample exhibition bureaus should be maintained at the Commercial Attaches office and at the local Consulates, prices and full details of Indian goods in these bureaus being clearly marked in Persian, together with the place of origin and firm from whom obtainable. (/) A portion of the Consulate Toshakhana presentation articles should consist of typical Indian products, such as, cotton and half chests of tea done up in fancy boxes, etc. (7) That commercial houses, desiring to start trade with Persia, should make a combine, as far as Southern Persia was concerned, and send out a representative, whose headquarters in winter and spring might be at Bushire and in the summer and autumn at Kerman, depots being opened under native management at Yezd, Bahramabad, Kerman and Bam. (8) That communications between the coast ports and towns on the plateau should be improved— (a) A road, avoiding the Kutals, to be made between Bushire and Shiraz. (b) A road to take wheeled traffic to be opened from Bandar Abbas, via Minab and Rigan, to Bam and on to Kerman. This would open up a large tract of country for the exportation of raw cotton, gum, etc. It would also permit of the possible exploitation of the mineral resources of the country, and the erection of mills and factories. Later on, the road might be extended to Seistan, and a railway might follow the lame route at least as far as Bam. (c) From Mohammerah to the interior. Note, Mr. MacLean thought that an improvement in the conditions, under which merchandise was landed and forwarded to inland destinations through Gulf ports, would be one of the greatest benefits which could be conferred on British trade. He was of opinion, however, that it was better to devote attention to the organisation of transport to inland markets, in order to reduce the time and cost of carriage of merchandise, rather than to incur heavy expenditure on roads. (9) That improvement should be made in posts and telegraphs. (a) That postal communication should be established between Bam and Seistan, (5) That a foreign parcel post from the Gulf ports to the interior should be initiated. (c) That the postage rates for local parcels should be reduced. (d) That Kerman should be linked with Bandar Abbas by telegraph. (10) That the possibilities of irrigation undertakings should be examined by a qualified engineer. An important irrigation scheme appeared to be possible on the60 upper ridges of the Halil Rud, watering the Jiruft valley. If a good water supply were available, great quantities of first class cotton could be raised for the Indian market, from American, Egyptian, or even Bombay seed. The production and export of wool could also be increased considerably. The very profitable trade in henna, a crop needing large quantities of water, could also be expanded. The trade in dates would increase; the rich grass lands might be turned to good account, and the increased cultivation would cause an increase in population with a consequent demand for more imports. (11) That a mining engineer should be deputed to examine particular areas. The whole of the range lying south of Kerman was reported to be rich in minerals, and in various localities lead, zinc, coal, borax and copper had been found. (12) That the harbours of Bandar Abbas and Bushire should be improved. Mr. Maclean's conclusion was that British trade, which had survived without very serious detriment the competition, to some extent artificially stimulated, of foreign trade, might expect to share in any extension of markets arising _ from increase of wealth and population, or from the greater consumption of foreign commodities in Persia. iAPPENDIX No. V. (i) BUSHIRE. The trade of the port of Bushire has been exhaustively described in the excellent annual reports by His Majesty ; s Vice-Consul, but for couvenience of reference emphasis may be laid upon the following points. (1) Distribution of trade .—Bushire serves, firstly, the towns and districts along the mam caravan route up to and including Ispahan, and, secondly, the coast littoral, south of the mountains, for a distance of more than 150 miles in length. The inland markets have hitherto been of greater importance but the insecurity of communications which is dealt with separately has seriously affected this branch of the trade, and the consuming and productive power ot the littoral has become increasingly relevant. Bushire is 325 miles from Lingah on the east and 210 from Mohammerah on the west, so that, quite apart from possibilities of inland trade, it is very favourably situated as a distributing and collecting centre. In }911-12 the imports, under the main heads were shared almost in equal proportions between the littoial and the inland routes. The consumption of merchandise is not confined to the small ports adjacent to Bushire but the nomad tribes during their stay in the south now make a practice of sending caravans to the nearest coast port, rather than to Shiraz as before, m order to provide themselves with sugar and other commodities. The trade in necessaries such as sugar, rice, kerosme is specially valuable. The town of Behbehan (two days journey from Bandar Dilam) provides an important side market for cotton goods since it is the capital of the Kuhgelu tribe. A still more promising feature of the trade is found in the fact that there is a very fertile plain of ffrain producing country for 100 miles or so both south and north of Bushire, so that the export of agricultural produce is capable of development, though the crops depend entirely upon the rainfall. . . Imports —The largest item is cotton piece goods of which about one-half goes in normal times to Shiraz and a percentage, very small of recent years, proceeds to Ispahan and even Yezd About one-quarter to one-third of the import is distributed by transhipment along the coast* The future of inland trade from Bushire depends on the decisions which may be arrived at in regard to the important question of communications as a whole in south PersTa but it seems probable that reliance will have to be placed more and more on the littoral market which demands cotton textiles of a rather simpler nature than those in vogue in the towns. The piece-goods trade which has been carried on by British firms on a running of business; involving long credits and heavy outstandings, may not find it smaller° Persian ^^chan ts sho w a n in ceasing tendency to^deal direct with firms in Manchester smaller Persian mercna , q Special attention is invited to the demand which is ^TnTamoL the younger generation of Persians in the Gulf ports for ready-made cotton and arising among t 7 g hit hi t E the noma d tribes are reported to be thyrs ItTimpXnt to note that the peoples of the coast districts rrefer* crystal to loaf sugar on account of its cheapness. Further, the use of crystal su^ar has become generally more popular, even up-country, since the war m consequence of the d.fficulty of obtaining loaf. Nearly half the total import of sugar goes to the littoral.

The 7 unerase question “ports ^ 'y^mliT^o mmark dealt with in a general note regarding lighterage at Gulf Ports, it here that a secoud launch tug is needed at the port. . Foreign compeUtion.-G^ and Russian Gerran'^rchants Bushire, though German exports rose to £ 67,000 in 1911-12 ana some weidevoted considerable study to the 'natural products of the hinterland. Russian competition affected British merchants chiefly at the inland markets. Harbour facilities .—The harbour was carefully surveyed in 1904. There are two ancho rages of which the outer accommodating ships of deep draft, at a distance of 4 to 4^ miles from the shore, affords little shelter from storms, while the inner (Khor Deira) which is about If miles from the landing place, is safe in all winds but is approached by a channel negoti able at present only by vessels drawing 17 feet or less at suitable tides. The deepening of the approach to the inner anchorage would be a costly operation and would not be justified unless there was likely to be a very large development of trade. Further, the inner anchorage would be somewhat rough during a shamal and it would probably be necessary to diedge a canal from it to the Customs Creek (Khor Sultani) but the streams are said to be very strong there. It was under contemplation to make preliminary borings in order to ascertain the nature of the material to be dredged in making this canal but owing to the war no action has since been taken. It is a question for consideration whether a long breakwater could profitably be constructed out from the western front of the port. But it seems unlikely in any case that Bushire could be converted into a convenient port unless at very disproportionate cost. The wharfage accommodation along the Customs Creek needs to be increased. (ii) LINGAH. The main centres supplied by Lingah are inland, Lar, Jahrum, Bastak and the surround ing districts, and by sea the Arab coast ports, to which goods are shipped by sailing boat, or steamer when available. Owing, however, to difficulties re transhipment of goods, cargo for these ports is now shipped direct to Dibai, whenever possible. In consequence of the high Customs tariff fixed by the Persian Government large quan tities of goods brought to Lingah for transhipment to the Arab coast, are eventually smuggled back into Lingah, and other places on the Persian side. German competition in the past was particularly successful in the following goods. Cotton piece-goods, such as prints, loin-cloths, turbans, white twills, towels, cheap vests and calicoes. Their piece-goods usually had a ready sale owing to the fact that they were cheap, and also had bright colours and gaudy patterns which were specially to appeal to the Oriental taste. Gold and Silver Lace and Thread.—Sold in very large quantities for women's dress. Alcoholic Drinks and Wines.—These, though not imported in large quantities, neverthe less had a ready sale owing to their cheapness, even with less strict Mohammedans. Matches.—At one time German matches were sold throughout the bazars, and few other makes were obtainable. The quality of the matches imported by the late firm of Robert W onckhaus and Company, was very fair indeed. At the present time the market is being flooded with Japanese matches, which as a rule are of very poor qualitv. Porcelain, Glass, and Chinaware.—German porcelain, glass, and china was largely sold in the past, and there are still small stocks on the market. The chief demand is for cheap glasses of gaudy designs and colours, very small sized glasses holding about a couple of fluid ounces; for tea, porcelain, and china bowls, and flat pans ol varying diameter. Glasses with stems are much sought after. Enamel ware.—This was largely imported by the Germans, though it was chiefly of Austrian manufacture. The most popular articles are bowls of various diameters, flat pans about 12 inches to 36 inches and even 48 inches in diameter and about 2 to 4 inches in depth, kettles, tea-pots, mugs, and round flat bottomed dishes with covers. . ^oft and Loaf Sugar—German sugar, in which is included Austrian and Belgian, which the Germans imported in large quantities, invariably sold better than English owing to the price being slightly lower. The quality was undoubtedly inferior to Messrs. 1 ate s sugars. A very popular form of loaf sugar was that sold in cones, of Austrian make, and the French, in small cubes, of the St. Louis type. British sugar should be pushed, as the consumption is large both in Lingah district and up-country. The import of loaf sugar from the United Kingdom in 19*13-14 only amounted to £322. If India and Aden are included the total value only amounted to £2 407 whereas Germany alone imported £9,017 worth. German imports also included loaf suo-ar of Austrian manufacture. As regards soft sugar imported during 1913-14 India led with £14,744 Germany came next with £7,280 worth. Japanese sugar is now being largely imported through India. &amp; o j Cutlery, and Aluminium Ware.—Cheap knives and aluminium spoons of the ordinary sizes have a sale. German pocket-knives have been largely sold, but there is still a tendency to ^ mves manufactured by Rodgers and Sons. The name Rodgers still seems to be accepted as a guarantee of quality, and it is to be feared that German goods bearing this oouTd 6 brmaS;tfeduced7ri^ Srea% ^ “ this directi ° n ' “ Bn S lish S» odsN 68 nt large (pn- illysmoggld the folm» towels, cksf that they ir to appeal ti joantities ii ies, Dererthe 19. ,d( 1 few oli irm of Kota! •hot is tain! largely »! lisforciai uple of tt iter.

The Germans had their own bonded warehouses outside the Customs and thus were enabled to smuggle in goods without payment of duty and also goods the entrance of which was prohibited, such as arms and ammunition. The sudden increase in the German imports into Lingah from £6,000 in 1912 to £18,000 in 1913 illustrates the great efforts which they were making to gain control of the market. Perfumes.—There is a ready sale for cheap perfumes of the musk variety. Some perfumes of Japanese manufacture are now procurable, in small quantities. Soaps,—The Japanese are importing various cheap brands which are a poor imitation of good soaps such as “ Erasmic ” and Leer Bros. “ Velvet.” Some German and Austrian soaps are still obtainable. There are signs of increasing activity on the part of the Japanese. Excluding sugar from Japan the bazaars are being flooded with Japanese matches, and in a lesser degree with other articles such as combs, pocket-knives, cotton vests, Turkish towels, socks and other email and cheap articles. Uxjjoris. —About 4,000 to 5,000 carpets are annually brought down from the Jahrum district. The quality is steadily deteriorating, and it is rarely possible to find any which do not contain aniline dyes. These are shipped chiefly to Aden, Jeddah, Constantinople and India. Latterly dealers have been shipping carpets to Basrah owing to the high prices obtainable there. Among the other exports from the interior, are gum arabic, gum tragacanth, cotton, dried fruits, almonds, raisins, assafoetida. Bastak district supplies assafcetida while in the western districts, tobacco, flax-seed, wheat, barley, onions are extensively grown. A large quantity of cotton sail cloth is also manufactured in the Lingah district on handlooms. It is a species of fine canvas made in pieces up to about 70 yards in length, and about 18 inches in width. The cloth is made in three grades, coarse, medium and fine, and is largely used in the Persian Gulf, and is also exported to Aden and Jeddah. Business might be done in export of pearls, pearl shells, tobacco, gum arabic, gum tragacanth, assafcetida, carpets, dried fruits, dried rose-buds, sail cloth, the latter in small quantities. The pearl trade at Lingah is a business, which if taken up by experts, should pay. There is, however, a great element of gamble about it, and fortunes can be both mada and lost in a season, if not in a single day. If the market for pearl shells is likely to be good in Europe after the war, this would seem to be a good time for British firms to corner the available output for the future by entering into agreements now with the various Sheikhs or chief who can supply them. The Sheikhs on the Persian Coast could probably be induced to enter into agreements to reserve the whole supply of pearl shells for British firms. In the shell trade very careful study of the market is necessary as when the market is low it is no use buying. There is still a large quantity of German shells lying in Lingah which it apparently did not pay them to ship. Sulphur occurs in the Bostaneh Range about 14 miles west of Lingah, and also at Khamir about 56 miles east of Lingah. Judging from outward appearances, there would appear to be large quantities, which could be mined. But it would be necessary for these places to be thoroughly examined by expert mineralogists in order to ascertain whether it would pay to work the mines or not, and whether the supply would be lasting. Russian Russian trade with this port was more or less insignificant in pre-war days. A certain amount of porcelain bowls, small glasses for tea and other chinaware, such as tea-pots, cups, saucers, etc., were imported, and there are still small stocks on the market. Shipping .—There was no lack of sufficient direct steamers to and from the United Kingdom in pre-war days. As a consequence, cargo, even for B ritish merchants was carried by German steamers of the Hamburg-America Line. Landing difficulties .—The quay at the Customs premises is small and very liable to become congested at times. This necessarily delayed discharge of cargo when large quantities arrive. It is estimated that it would cost from Rs. 35,000 to Rs. 45,000 to improve the quay. Capital could probably be raised locally if the work were done under British guarantee. Great advantage would be derived by extending the two boat basins, which at present exist, with a view to enable boats’to discharge cargo irrespective of weather. At present when weather is moderately bad great delay is experienced in landing cargo, owing to boats being unable to enter the basins. At low tide, and in the winter months, ships are liable to be held up for several days or compelled to overcarry cargo. Communications. —Inland routes to Lar, Bastak, and Jahrum are B good and usually quite safe. Merchandise for Shiraz and other places can also be forwarded Jby the Lingah-Bastak- Lar route, but this is much more expensive than the Bushire-Shiraz routes, owing to the increased distance 291 miles as against 185. At present the prices are extremely high, but as an alternative route it is undoubtedly useful since as far as Lar, it is much safer than the Bandar Abbas-Lar route and supplies and grazing are more plentiful. Lack of telegraphic communi cation with the outside world is a great handicap both politically and commercially. It is understood that a wireless installation is now about to be erected.64 64 3.

In ISIS British and Indian trade combined amounted V £46t,000 ont of a total o £ ^ 50 / 0 , 0 ’. whlle ® e v T n the hands only £35,000 and this mainly represented sugar imports. The trade is mostly n of the British Indian colony composed of Hindus and Khojas from bind. 2. Imports .—The chief imports are cotton piece-goods, yarn and twist sugar, tea and dyes. The greater portion of the goods sent to the interior go to Kerman and some on o \ezd ^he weak point of British trade has hitherto been sugar. But as the trade m this article is entirely in the hands of British Indian merchants who order through British firms in Karachi, an opportunity is afforded by the war for the introduction of British or Egyptian sugars as soon as they can be placed on the market m sufficient quantities. Although the bulk of the imports,^ 75 per cent., we shown ^ coming from the Lnited Kingdom and India, there is little doubt that some of the goods credited to the British Empire are not produced in it, but are re-imported from the continent. The sugar, tor instance, shown as of Indian origin appears to be Java sugar transhipped at Bombay. Con tinental piece-goods, china, glassware, enamelware, etc., imported through Bombay appear in the customs statistics as “ from India.” It is of importance that so far as possible the county of origin of goods should in every case be correctly given. Indian piece-goods have gained a stronghold over the market and also Indian yarn and twist. Cheap and gaudy prints and chintzes appeal to the poorer inhabitants of the interior and India has now the oppor- tunitv of capturing the whole market for these classes of goods. Attention has several times been' invited in trade reports to the possibility of introducing a cheap brand of cigarettes but the business would have to be taken up by some firm of cigarette manufacturers. 3. Exports .—With improved communications there should be considerable development of exports. The Kerman carpet industry, which was controlled by European firms established at Kerman, was of great value, the exports having increased in three years from £15,000 to £76 000. There are large quantities of local products such as almonds, raisins and currants, dates, assafcetida, opium, rose buds and glim available for export. The establishment of one or more British firms in Bandar Abbas, in touch with the leading houses in India and Europe, and having agents in the interior, for instance, at Yezd, Kerman, Sirjan, Bafsinjan, Lar, etc., would soon develope a large and profitable export business. It is remark able that the export of wool, which includes also goat hair, to India increased from £17,000 in 1907 to £36,000 in 1915. 4. Shipping. —Bandar Abbas may he said to be fairly well served from the point of tonnage but freights have been high owing to insufficient competition with the British India Company who handled the greater portion of the trade and the lack of direct services to Europe. For this reason most of the goods for London and New York had to be sent via Bombay. 5. landing difficulties .—The great drawback to the Bandar Abbas harbour is the very flat slope of the shore. The four fathom anchorage is two miles out and that for larger ships about four miles. Although the pier is 110 yards long it has only a depth of 10 feet of water at the sea end at high tide and at low tide there is 70 yards of dry land beyond it. Not more than four lighters can discharge at one time in calm weather and work is possible only during five or six hours out of the twenty-four as the tide serves. In rough weajherno work can be done. It can easily be understood what a handicap this is to the landing and handling of cargo. In order to enable the pier to be used both at low and high tide by ordinary country boats, which require a depth of nine feet of water when fully loaded and four feet when empty, the pier should be extended for at least another 210 yards. The present pier is located at the steepest part of the shore slope, so that no alteration of locality is required. The unloading of ships could also be greatly accelerated if a steam launch were maintained and, with the increased trade after the war, it would probably pay the British India Company to maintain such a launch. The laying down of a line of rails on the pier with trollies would also expedite the removal of goods to the Customs House. If a company were inaugurated for the extension and improvement of the pier, local capital would pro bably be enlisted and a good return should be secured by levying fees on goods imported. The Persian merchants are anxious that the pier should be roofed in, since much damage is done at present to cargo stacked in the open upon it. With proper arrangements for rapid removal of the cargo this, however, would probably be unnecessary. Very much damage is caused to sugar and other perishable goods lying on the pier at high tide owing to the con gestion caused by the present utterly inadequate arrangements. 6. In the second place, the Customs House arrangements are such as to entangle and hinder goods in transit to the merchants' warehouses. The approach from the pier to the customs godown is through a narrow passage lined with shops and great inconvenience is caused, especially when some goods are being taken into the customs premises and some brought out. An outline plan of the premises is under preparation with a view to obtain suggestions for improvement from an expert authority. The Customs House is located in the ground floor of the old Dutch Factory called, kulah frangi, the upper portion being the residence of the Deputy Governor. Conditions would be improved if the Deputy Governor could be provided with a separate house, at operations could then more easily be undertaken for organising the customs on proper scientific lines. Inspection of the yards showed very many bales of piece goods badly damaged by rain water. Many bales had been lying in puddles of water until the contents had become completely rotten. lew of the godowns, possessed rain proof roofs. The building itself is strongly constructed and spacious, though in sad disrepair, and with proper alterations could be converted into good customs offices. It is essential, however, that there should be a wide and properly designed inlet for goods from the pier and a correspond ing outlet to the north, so that caravans from up-country can have ready and direct access when bringing goods for export or taking away imports. 7 An agency of the Imperial Bank of Persia or of any other bank should pay its way 6-7 in Bandar Abbas from the start. The Hindu and Banking. Persian merchants would continue to sell hundis, but the bank would get its share of the business. Besides it would have the handling of all revenue and customs receipts and the hnancing of the South Persia Rifles and other British Government institutions.66 appendix NO. VI. OPENINGS FOR TRADE WITH THE BAKHTIARI TRIBES. 1 Catalogues are useless as an incentive to purchase. When _ orders 8 lve ? J Tom a catalogue the result frequently is disappointment and even suspicion that the description was misleading. The institution of a depot in Ahwaz, which would cater for the needs of the S bes in fouth-west Persia, Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kugelu might result m a great expansion of business The personal equipment of officers travelling in these tribal areas frequently attracts an envious eye and Khans often ask that saddles, binoculars etc. may be ordered for them. Travelling agents, properly equipped with samples and with lists of fnms prices should be able to do good business, but it would be most difficult to find the right type of agent. For instance, the Khans have hitherto bought only Russian saddles. Captain Noel has this year procured on order a consignment of 50 saddles from the Cawnpore Leather Factory. . A 2. The following is a list of goods, which might find a ready sale in the depotLeather goods, saddles, bridles, boots, sporting guns_ and cartridges, telescopes and field glasses, rifles, and revolvers, stationery, lamps, agricultural implements, spades, pick-axes, shovels. Gramophones, glass and chinaware, especially tea pots and tea glasses, cutlery, carpenters tools, watches and jewellery, oleographs, tinned provisions, ready-made clothes, overcoats, soap, looking glasses, window glass (especially coloured), locks, door hinges and door locks, matches, nails and screws, camp furniture, paints, distemper, silks and velvets used by women. 3 The Khans in the month of February, sent agents to make purchases in Bombay to the extent of not less than Rs. 1,00,000, but this method of doing business is both expensive and unsatisfactory for them. If some firm of general merchants, working on the same nnes as Evans Fraser, for instance, were to open a branch at Ahwaz during the wi^er months, that is to say from December to May, they might expect to do a steady business. There would doubtless be some local trade during the remaining period of the year. If the Ahwaz branch were found to pay, it might be profitable to have depots also at outlying places, such as Dizful, Shushtar, Behbehan, and Ramuz. If it were politically feasible for British officials to undertake the management of Khans J estates at their request, it would help to create openings for British trade and increase the spending power of the Khans. 4. There are indications that Arabistan was an important sugar growing country many years ago, and it would seem desirable that expert investigation should be arranged in order to ascertain its present capabilities in this direction and also for cotton. The Khans would eagerly accept any offers of assistance in the way of deputation of agricultural experts to advise on the increase of production or the use of modern agricultural machinery. The establishment of an agricultural experimental model farm might be expected to produce valuable results. Foot and mouth disease and sheep rot are periodically responsible for a very large mortal ity among the animals, and the deputation of a veterinary expert would be useful aud would be warmly welcomed by the Khans. 5. The Khans, though handicapped by their tribal jealousies and swayed by elementary passions, are, in some cases, good men of business with a keen eye to the main chance, and are ready to take advantage of any scheme which appears likely to increase their material prosperity or their general comfort. The Khans are anxious to adopt European standards in furnishing their houses, and, as some 25 members of the younger generation have been educated in Europe, it is probable that this tendency will become accentuated.* See page 156 of Memoirs of the Geological Survey of India, Volume XXIV, Part 4. APPENDIX NO VII. SPECIAL OPENINGS FOR BRITISH TRADE. The establishment of a fish-curring or tinning company in the neighbourhood of Jashk, Chahbar or Guadur. The sea on the Persian coast at the entrance of the Gulf teems with fish of various kinds the whole year round : vast quantities of small fish are cast up on the beach. Sir F. A. Nicholson's monograph on fish curing from a Madras point of view suggests that there is an even better opening on the Biyaban-Mekran coast. The market to be supplied is two-fold : (a) simple curing for the taste of the poorer classes in India, (#) curing and tinning, if possible, for European and wealthier class consumption. A scientific method seems essential, and British management a sine qua non. Red Oxide of Iron. —The history of this trade is well known. After the war, the demand for Red Oxide is sure to revive : and the question arises whether the export of Red Oxide from these or any other islands in the Gulf shall be left open to competition or whether Government support shall be confined to a single co*mpany. In any case, it is desir able to exclude foreign interests, and to give one or more British institutions definite rights for a period of years. A British shipping company has a better chance of developing this business than any other, on account of the lower cost of freight: but, from the Government point of view, a European representative of the exploiting firm should be stationed in the Gulf. Nothing is less likely to assist the development than to leave the mining to the hands of Persians, such as the Muin-ut-Tujjar's men as at present. Iron Ryrites. —This metal is found in the islands off the Arab coast, and samples have been sent to the United Kingdom : the question whether export is possible, or not, on com mercial grounds, might be determined at an early date. Mr. Pilgrim thought not. * Sulphur. —In the early part of the past decade, the extensive deposits at Bustaneh on the coast near Lingah were being worked to a, very small extent by the Muin-ut-Tujjar (whose concession subsequently lapsed) and the ore was roughly smelted by very unscientific methods : but, even then, the small shipments to the United Kingdom were pronounced almost pure sulphur. Attempts were made to interest the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Limited, in this particular deposit, for they require sulphur for their refining at Abadan : and the Burma Oil Company also made enquiries on the subject. There is little doubt that the deposit could be worked commercially for use in eastern markets : possibly also it would repay shipment to Europe, if properly smelted under European management. There is another deposit at Khir, on the coast of the mainland in the Clarence Strait, which might offer itself for exploitation jointly with Bustaneh. Gypsum. —The whole of the Persian coast range is prolific in gypsum deposits there is one of exceptional note and size at Birkat Sifleh near Lingah. Samples have been sent to India, but it is understood that there is more than sufficient in India for its own needs. Extensive enquiries have not been made in the United Kingdom, or elsewhere in the British dominions, or Egypt, to ascertain whether this mineral would have a commercial market. It is largely a question of freight: and, at times, freights between the Gulf and the United Kingdom have been very reasonably low. The first thing to do is to obtain further samples, and to enlist the interest of some large firm or organisation in England, through the Board of Trade. Oil Deposits. —Surveys and experimental borings are now being made by the geologists of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company on Qishm Island and in other places. Stone. —Though not an article for trade outside the Gulf, the recent commencement oi the working of stone for paving, ballast and building purposes by the military authorities on Kharg Island is worthy of remark from the point of view of building and engineering development in the Gulf and river ports, and their immediate neighbourhood. The export of Cuttle-fish and of Tortoise (turtle-shell), though relatively small, is worth mention. The Russian shipping agents have paid special attention to the former at Busire ; it apparently finds a market at Odessa, but they have never sought to obtain large quantities. Tortoise-shell goes to Bombay at present, but in small quantities, and the catching and collection of turtles is not systematically undertaken. IMPORTS. Sugar, loaf. —The principal brand has been Belgian for some years, a harder refined article than the French cone. There has been a vast increase in consumption. The French article ia hardly eaten south of Shiraz, and chiefly goes to Ispahan. The Hungarian product comes third.- The popular taste insists on cones, and attempts to introduce cubes have failed, to overcome this. English refiners have hitherto declined to erect the special machinery involved for drying, etc., and the whole import is limited to 4 or 5 refineries at the outside. Egyptiancones have only reappeared since the war, and are not liked. India cannot, of course, produce sue-ar for Export for many years, chiefly owing to lack of up-to-date plant, the demand m the country 1 and the difficulty of securing large and continuous supplies of raw material. There would seem to be a larger opening in this trade for Britain than almost any other in Persia With Mesopotamia open for great extension of trade after the war, the the Gulf, will mount rapidly above 50,000 tons. It is no use trying to convert the Persian taste to cubes • and British manufacturers, e.g., Messrs. Tate should be urged to put down a smaU plant for cones, if possible before the end of the war, so that the trade formerly held by Belgian and Hungarian cones can be taken over directly the war is finished. British sugar refineries should have a British controlled agency for all the Gulf region, which could tour and develope central markets in Peisia. ^ Rnnar crustal. E. A. R. G. crystals can be competed with, on fairly level terms, by Messrs.^Tate's Britannia crystals. Two facts, which should be capable of adjustment, militated against the import not being heavier in 1912-1913: (a) Messrs. Tate could not allot a large quantity for this market; {b) their refinery had no agent working specially lor orders. Hongkong crystals have come to the front a great deal since the war, and Mauritius can supply smaller grain qualities, which will command a sale against thetsmaller grain Continental brands. The expensiveness oE Mauritius sugar, which was noted m 1904), is of less importance than the yellowness of its colouring, and the small size of its crystals as compared with t e acid-drop whiteness and large crystals of the Austrian and English refined article Probably Indian refined cane sugar would have the same blemish in local eyes. British refined sugar ought from these three sources manage to gain at least a half share, possibly more, m the Gulf and Southern and Western Persia trade. Matches— chief want is a British-made sulphur match. The Persian peasant, and a large proportion of town people will not use safety matches. The Residency have made stray attempts to obtain samples of cheap British matches, but, without personal enquiry and pressure in England, it is in possible to say to what extent, if any British-made matches could be got to compete with Swedish in this market. It is a question that needs thorough, investigation and report, before any recommendation is possible. Earthenware and china. Glassware and windowglass. Hardware, cutlery, enamelware’ Scissors. Aluminium and copper cooking and other vessels. Metal manufactures, including spade heads, ploughshares, pails, Persian weights and measures and scales.. Haberdashery, needles, sewing machines and many other small articles. There is a possibility of development in all these lines. Medicines. —Messrs. Burroughs and Wellcome have interested themselves to no small extent, but they need a direct representative to travel all over the towns of Ears and stock shops/ They have already begun to print the descriptions and methods of taking their drugs, and the extension of distribution of such medicines is in the interest of Southern Persia. There are also numerous household remedies, which command a sale, e.g., fruitsalts, c astor oil, etc. Velvets and plushes .—Efforts should be made to substitute British articles for the German-made cotton-silks, which have been imported, even by British firms, like Ziegler &amp; Co. Bradford is apparently the manufacturing centre for these goods in the United Kingdom. Some arrangement could probably be made in the associations in Bradford by Manchester firms interested in Persia to get British-made velvets and plushes on to the Persian market (Central Persia is of the greatest importance) before the war ends. Boots and shoes, patent-leather, and plain black and brown .—The firm oi Bostock at Northampton has a great name in this part of Persia: and with organisation, the sale could be increased, especially in Shiraz and other towns of Ears. The nomad tribes in particular, are very fond of coming into market far booiweax. At present, stocks are very short, and cheap Indian shoes are supplying the want to some extent. Price is not a. great consideration ', high prices are paid as a rule. The women in Bushire, at least, are discarding the Baghdad boot, for European-shaped shoes. Fancy suitings .—There has been an increasing demand for these goods of recent years the youth of the town, in particular, wearing European-cut trouserings. Germany supplied a considerable portion of these goods, known locally as “ Fast uni/' The same remarks- as to organisation of sales in up-country centres apply as in the case of boots and underwear. Not only the well-to-do as formerly, but even the coolies and servants buy all sorts of European articles and affect a semi-European style. The standard of luxury and, living has risen much in the past eight years throughout the country and more particularly in the towns. Paper .—There is an opening for some firm or firms to- organise sales of cheap writing paper, especially for merchants, and for printing and wrapping paper, Italy and Austria have been competitors, through India to some extent. The consumption in Bushire itself is not very extensive, but, worked together with Shiraz, Ispahan, Kerman, Arabistan and provincial centres, there should be an opportunity for considerable sales.Soaps. — An opening for the extension of Sunlight, Gossages and other makes of British soaps exists, provided the necessary organisation can be arranged by these firms, or others. Generally speaking, the best method would be for the Board of Trade to interview likely firms concerned in each case with a view to getting them to combine, in different groups, to establish British managed agencies in Persia, the essential point, after such agents have sent home samples of goods in demand, being that these men should travel for part of each year round the inland centres. The work of such enterprise would be considerably assisted, if a system of Government Trade Agents in the various provinces were introduced. EXPORTS. Almonds. —If Government Trade Agents in the provinces could, by touring and personal inspection, ascertain quantities likely to be available and districts where purchase could be systematically carried out, there is a great opening for some British firm to establish a British agency, or agencies inland. Ghm Tragacanth. —A large part of the export from the Ears region has of recent years, gone to the United States, where a German specialist, living at Shiraz, had established a good trading connection. This applies to exports of Gum Arabic or Insoluble also. Gum Arabic or Insoluble. —For the most important market for southern Persia is in India whence it finds way to Europe to some extent. Cotton. —The most important cotton centre in Persia is Khorasan, but cotton is grown also, in Central and Southern Persia. Large quantities are consumed in the country for the manufacture of eirpets and numerous native textiles. Nearly all the exported cotton is despatched to Russia, a trifling percentage being sent to the British Empire and Turkey. The reason for this is, firstly, that Russia admits Persian cotton at favoured rates and, secondly, because Persian cotton is too weak and too short in staple to be of much use to Emglish or Indian mills, though a certain amount finds a sale in Bombay for mixing purposes. The acreage devoted to cotton growing, or the outturn, is not known. Mr. Maclean gave it as his opinion that cotton could hardly be grown in the Southern Provinces at remunerative prices for export. Mr. Gleadowe-Newcomen differed. He held that, while in the northern uplands it was impossible, owing to the shortness of the summers aud the rigour of the winters, to grow cotton suitable to meet British and Indian require ments, there were considerable tracts in the Karun district and the warm southern zone, Bam-Narmashahr, Jiruft and Rudbar, where cotton of good length and staple could be grown from good Egyptian, American and Bombay seed to considerable advantage, if the country were irrigated, as it was capable of being, and if methods of cultivation were improved. Given the possession of certain assurances and concessions with a certainty of tenure, which, with the support of their Governments, might be secured by English or Indian manufacturers interested in increasing the growth of cotton, British-Indian capital might give a very great impetus to its cultivation and to the development of agriculture generally in the south. The export has fallen off on the whole during the past decade, and no one has tried to develope an export for the Indian market. l&amp;Yii a propos of Mr. Newcomen’s remarks, a proposal was made a year or two back by a firm of Parsi (Persian) bankers and estate owners than an Englishman should be put in to manage their properties in the Kirman province, but the project did not mature. One way to develope the export of cotton and other produce from the interior might, however, be to encourage British “ estate-agents/' in the same way as the Russians (and Germans) have done in the Ispahan province. Many Persian notables would be glad of the opportunity. Raisins and Sultanas. —Though to a much smaller extent than for almonds, the same, remarks apply. Rosewater and Otto of Roses, Essential oils. —A small sale to the United Kingdom could be worked up if some British firm would get into personal touch with Maimand in Ears, the chief centre for production. Bulgaria is one of the chief sources of supply of Otto. Kullhung and Bannak berries has been experimentally exported, and no doubt other substances growing wild and hitherto not recognised as of value might be possible items for export. Seeds, Roppy, Linseed, Sesame, Blackseed, Cummin, Aniseed and Assaf xtida.' —All these articles of produce are entirely undeveloped by British firms, and expert and personal incentive is necessary. Fibres. —Samples of the fibres on stems of date-palms, which can be removed from the trees each year, have been sent to Manchester, and offer an opening for examination and trial. As it is a new suggestion for trade to the Persian date-tree owner, the ordinary firm or agency in the coast region could hardly undertake the work. When it is certain that this fibre can be utilized for manufacturing purposes, some special organisation would be requisite to secure a sufficient sale from the date-producing regions.70 TamlaJcu .—The duty on export, and the Tambaku Regie (Constantinople preference) require adjustment. Tambaku (nicetiana Persica—a different plant from the ordinary tobacco of European consumption) could possibly be used for blending purposes, if sufficient pursuasion could be applied to some of the great manufacturers in the United Kingdom to induce them to make the necessary experiments. There is extensive cultivation all over Southern and Central Persia, which is capable of great increase, were a demand outside eastern countries promoted. Skins ,—This trade chiefly concerns India : it is almost entirely left to Persian traders at present, and it might be profitable to interest Indian houses to take a more active part in increasing the area of supply and the demand. Opium no longer goes to America or Belgium. The United Kingdom has the first place in importance, and the Persian drug is the most important for home consumption after that of the Smyrna region. The export to China direct has been knocked out by the Opium Convention, but there is still a quantity sent early to the Ear East, though the market varies. It goes sometimes to Singapore, sometimes to the Dutch Indies, at others to Hongkong or Formosa. The export to the United Kingdom alone from Bushire was valued at over £300,000 in 1914-15: the total export being worth nearljt half a million pounds. The population are taking to the opium habit.APPENDIX No. VIII. BAHRAIN. Bahrain is agriculturally and commercially the most valuable district on the western side of the Persian Gulf. It is the principal pearl market in the Gulf and it is also an emporium for general trade with the mainland, about one-third of the total goods imported leaving the island again for the minor ports which serve the cases of Hasa and Qatif and part of Nejd. Imports .—The most important item of import are piece-goods, woollen goods, coffee rice, sugar and tea. England and India kept the piece-goods trade almost entirely in their own hands, but before the war American sheeting had gained a considerable place in popular favour, and cloth of similar quality manufactured in India was unable to compete with tiie American article. ^ At the present moment, Japan has taken the lead in supplying this particular line of piece-goods and the Indian trade will suffer unless Indian mills can manage to produce sheeting which will compete favourably with the Japanese article. Coffee .—Before the war the greater part of the coffee in the years 1909-11 was Brazilian imported in German ships, but Indian coffee was gaining ground in 1912-13. It now monopolises the market. Sugar.—'Hh.Q statistics appear to indicate a large rise of imports of sugar in German ships in the year 1913, but owing to the fact that the figures were procured from the manifests for the first time that year, it cannot be stated with certainty that the imports in German ships before 1913 were not much greater than the figures in the trade reports appear to indicate At the same time it is believed that the Germans made a special effort to import large quantities of sugar in 1913 in view of the newly realised possibility of making large profits on sugar smuggled from Bahrain to Persia. i^.-Kice mostly comes from Calcutta; Rangoon rice being of inferior quality is not so much in demand. The imports of 1914) were double those for 1913-14, but this is explained by the fact that rice importation generally takes place in March or April and if the steamers happen to arrive in April one year, and in March the following year, the imports by both steamers would be included in one year's returns. Tea .—The tea imported into Bahrain mostly finds its way to the Persian Coast and it is only brought to Bahrain in order to evade payment of Persian customs duty. Tea is drunk locally only by Persians and there is no indication that it has begun to come into general favour among the Arabs here, as in Mesopotamia. The total value of imports into the Bahrain Islands in 1913-14, excluding specie and pearls, amounted to £989,378. Exports .—Pearls are by far the most valuable item of export, the aggregate value for the ten years ending 1909 being given as £6,827,009. It is, however, extremely difficult to estimate the value of any given year’s export, since the merchants frequently export pearls in their personal baggage and the figures are therefore deceiving. A member of a Paris firm used regularly to visit ^ Bahrain for purchase of pearls and his profits in one year were estimated at about six lakhs of rupees. The purchase of pearls is a highly specialised branch of commerce requiring really expert knowledge and plenty of capital. Having regard to the very great value of the pearl trade in the Gulf and to our special political advantages at Bahrain, it is somewhat remarkable that no examination has ever been made of the pearl beds by an expert trained in pearl oyster culture. The Commissioners desire to recommend very strongly that a survey of the pearl banks should be made as soon as circumstances permit. The export of mother of pearl and oyster shells 'requires special notice, since shell export formed the foundation of AVonckhaus' business originally in Liugah and afterwards in Bahrain. Bahrain was the principal centre of the trade, though Lingah or Pars shells were also exported to some extent. The Germans exported nearly £39,909 worth of sells to Europe in one year. Messrs. Wonckhaus used to purchase shell at much higher rates than the British firms, Gray Paul and Company could afford and they were doubtless enabled to do so owing to the favour able shipping rates by the Hamburg-America line. Another point in their favour was the fact that Hamburg was the market for shells used for buttons. It is important that the trade should be kept in British hands in future and committees responsible for re-organising trade in England after the war might keep in view the possibility of marketing the shell in England instead of in Hamburg. Secondly, it seems probable that it would pay a British firm to introduce disc cutting machines at Bahrain, since the export of discs would obviate the necessity of shipping much useless shell. The Board of Trade inquiry in 1908 showed that the necessary machinary could be obtained in Birmingham. Thirdly, if expert examination of the pearling grounds could be made, some important light might be shed on the pearl shell industry, since it is still uncertain whether, as believed by the Arabs, the fertility of the banks is influenced adversely by the non-return of the empty shells to the sea.72 It must, however, be remembered that the United Kingdom does not work on a low quality shell and therefore buyers must have shipping facilities for reaching foreign ports where there is a demand for these low qualities. Shipping.—It is unlikely that it would pay to arrange for a regular call by direct steamers to Europe at Bahrain. The actual deviation from the direct course to or from Basrah does not involve much delay but owing to the unfavourable character of the harbour expensive delays might be involved in case of bad weather. In a strong shamal it is impossible to unload into lighters and work may be hung up for several days. Messrs. Wonekhaus undoubtedly profited in the past by the frequency with which the Hamburg-America line called at Bahrain. The question o^ more regular calls by steamers of a British line has been referred to in paragraph 11 of the Report. A monthly steamer from London direct with piece-goods, coffee and sugar might pay but it would probably j^e difficult to fix regular sailings for some time to come. Lighterage .—The British India Company have solved their lighterage difficulties at Bahrain, since they now possess ten boats of their own. If the Company could see their w’ay to maintain a tug for towing the lighters, it would greatly accelerate the despatch of steamers and the firm would also gain advantage over foreign steamers which would still be dependent on the slower system. It is quite likely that the maintenance of a tug would not show immediate returns as a business proposition, but the Commissioners think that in the long run it would be to the advantage of the Cpmpany. Landing facilities .—The landing pier at present consists of a jetty of coral rock 550 feet long by 80 feet broad at the sea end. A loan of 1100,000 has just been raised by a number of local merchants with a view to lengthening and broadening the pier slightly. It is calculated that the pier should be about 1,700 feet long to enable boats to get alongside at all states of the tide. If the new project, which has been initiated by the local merchants themselves, is successful, further developments may be encouraged. Customs .—The customs used to be farmed out by the Sheikh to Arab merchants who were corrupt and unbusiness like and the Sheikh got very little profit. The Government of India were anxious to lend the Sheikh a trained officer to supervise the administration but he was unwilling to agree to this. There was also a suggestion that the customs should be farmed by the Government of India for about three lakhs a year which would have meant a large profit for the Sheikh. It was clear, however, that this proposal would not have commended itself to him and it is doubtful whether it was actually made. About eight years ago the Sheikh entrusted his customs to a paid official and this system is still in force. The Director of Customs is now a Hindu bunia and the management is fairly satisfactory. The Commissioners would suggest for consideration the desirability of inducing the Sheikh to accept the loan of a trained officer from India to work his customs, The suppression of the office of Lamalbashi is also desirable and it would be convenient if customs godowns could be allocated to each shipping company for the storage of all cargo arriving on their steamers. At present no data are acquired by the Customs in regard to the weights or quantities of the goods imported so that the statistics are lacking in one important element. Endeavours were by enquiry made to ascertain the average number of bales imported but the futility of this soon became apparent. The existing staff of the Customs would not be adequate for the maintenance of statistics regarding weights and quantities and the Sheikh would doubtless be unwilling to entertain the additional staff required unless the British Government paid for it. Large quantities of woollen-goods were being imported from Germany, and possibly from Austria, before the war. They could not, however, be traced in the Customs because they were misdescribed as piece-goods in order to evade payment of the higher rate of duty on woollen-goods. Banking .— A representative of the Eastern Bank visited Bahrain in February 1917. The Sheikh after consulting his principal merchants informed the Political Agent that he was not anxious for the foundation of a bank at Bahrain, mainly because the taking of interest was contrary to the Islamic law. The advantage of opening a bank have been explained to the Sheikh and some local opposition which formerly existed is in process of calming down. An opportunity may present itself a little later for bringing up the question again. It is by no means certain, however, that the volume of business would be sufficient to justify the opening of a bank. Further investigation will possibly be necessary. The rupee is freely current in Bahrain but the real will be in use so long as trade with the mainland continues. The Political Agent at Bahrain has already addressed firms in India with a view to the import of glasses used by Arabs and Persians for drinking sherbet and tea; also in regard to padlocks for shop doors. He was also written to the Director-General, Commercial Intel ligence, with reference to the possibility of importing cheap lamps, enamelware, earthenware, coffee cups, matches, stationery, and to the Secretary, Colombo Chamber of Commerce, in regard to cheap toys. Special openings for trade .—It is understood that there is a possibility of the discovery of oil in Bahrain and the bitumen deposits should be investigated. It is likely that trade with Hasa and Nejd may increase considerably in consequence of the establishment of Bin Saudis position as ruler. 't * VKUWAIT. Kuwait is not at present %n important place commercially. The total trade of the port for the year 1913-14 amounted to about £500,000 f the imports being heavily in excess of the exports. The reason for this is that a large part of the trade of Kuwait is transit trade serving Nejd and, in former years, Irak. Imports .—The largest items of import are rice, barley, coffee, sugar, wheat and piece-goods, especially “ American ” sheeting. Rice is becoming the staple food of the Arabs, and people who formerly lived on dates, dried fish and coarse bread, now eat rice twice a day. Sugar is also largely used, since Arabs are acquiring the taste of drinking sweet tea after 'bitter coffee. The Japanese have now an imitation of American sheeting on the market which is very popular. Indian sheeting of the same class is cheaper than Japanese but it does not sell so well owing to defects of quality. If the Bombay mills were to turn attention to this they might be able to under-sell the Japanese. Shipping. Exports .—The exports are chiefly specie and pearls. Before the war steamers used to call sufficiently often at Kuwait, but having regard to the class of cargo no direct line to Europe is required at present. But possibly after the war it might be worth while for a direct steamer from Europe to call occasionally at Kuwait on the way to Basrah. Lightering and landing cargo .—The arrangements at Kuwait are superior to those at any other port in the Gulf and no improvements are immediately required. The godown accommodation is ample, but if trade developes later on, it may be desirable to ask the Sheikh to allot special godowns to the British India Company or other shipping companies for the storage of their own goods. ' Customs .—The administratio 11 is superintended by an Arab and the system seems to work satisfactorily. The duty has lately been reduced to 4 per cent, ad valorem, and a considerable proportion oc the dues is paid in kind. There is at present no export duty except on trade to the interior. The low rate of dues at Kuwait may have the effect of encouraging smuggling into Mesopotamia and the course of trade will have to be carefully watched. . Openings for trade. — Stress has been laid in the annual Trade Reports on the opportuni ties which exist for British Indian traders in Kuwait, since at present the whole trade of the port is in the hands at Arabs and Persians, who are ignorant and have little knowledge of conducting commercial transactions in a business like way. Indian merchants knowing Arabic might do good business, but the possibilities of commercial developments are not very great unless Kuwait becomes the distributing centre of goods for Nejd and the more important towns of Central Arabia, in which case the trade of Bahrain would probably suffer. Currency.—In 1911 the Sheikh ordered that the Indian rupee should be the official local currency in place of the Maria Theresa Dollar. The latter is'still used largely and of necessitv in transactions with Arabs from the interior, but accounts are kept and prices are quoted in rupees'to the great convenience of merchants. Banting .—No need for a bank is experienced at present because purchases are made in Bombay against the value of pearls shipped there from time to time. Merchants greatly appreciate the convenience of being able to remit rupees through the Post Office. In February 1917 nearly lakhs were so remitted. ... ... MASKAT. No main trade routes emanate from Maskat and at the present moment trade with the interior is almost defunct. As a distributing centre for coast trade the importance of Maskat is affected by the development of Sur and Debai respectively. The future of Oman depends entirely on the manner in which the present political situation developes, and it would be of small advantage at the moment to endeavour to anticipate events. ‘ A few points are worthy of remark. (1) That the agency of the British India Company should, if possible, be entrusted once more to a European representative. Since the death of Mr. Gumming, Messrs. Towell have been represented by a young Khoja agent of the firm of Messrs. To well. (2) In any revised treaty arrangements which may be made with the Sultan of Maskat, special importance should be attached to the placing of the Customs under British manage ment and to the grant of permission to British firms to make their own arrangements for landing cargo. (3) The currency question which has already been dealt with at length in official com munications should be taken up seriously. Definite arrangements were under consideration in 1905 for the demonetization of the Maria Theresa dollar by the Sultan with special assistance from the Government of India. (4) The improvement of landing arrangements by the construction of a small inner boat harbour in the north-west corner of the port would be of advantage.Supplement containing Miscellaneous Notes on various subjects.83 NOTES ON CERTAIN FIRMS IN BASRAH .—Haji Abdul Uasool Bebhani. —Deals in Crystal Sugar from Tate^s and Loaf Sugar from Antwerp and Marseilles; his cargo came by Strick' , s boats, Hamburg-Ameriea steamers and with transhipment at Bombay. All the Antwerp Sugar came in German steamers. He ordered his sugar either through Gray Mackenzie or Strick Scott and the price was a c.i.f. one, and, therefore, he had nothing to do with how the cargo was sent. His sugar from Marseilles came either by Strick’s or BucknalFs boats and this also refers to Tate's sugar. His Tea, which comes from Calcutta, is brought entirely by B. I. boats, and the Tea that is purchased from Bombay comes either by B. 1. Bombay and Persia or the Arab Line of steamers. His Coffee came from London, bought through Basrah firms and arrived by Strick s or BucknaiPs boats. Haji Mohammed Ali Behda&amp;hty .—Does practically the same business as the former gentleman and he confirms all that he has said. Eaji Abdul Basool Cochigani .—Deals mostly in enamel ware, earthenware, glassware and haberdashery; he bought all these from Germany or Austria, seeing samples at Wonckhaus and Company's office and placed all his orders through this firm. When he first commenced business with the German firm, he used to place orders with them and they never required him to deposit any money or give a f- campiala ; he would pay them by instalments after receipt of the goods and only after their sale later on, the German firm started the system of taking “compialas'” and he used to give them these documents—payment at 6 months date; the ‘' campialas ” being dated on the receipt of the goods by him. The Germans did not press for payment when a u campiala ' became due. He (H. A. Rasool Cochingani) used to pay something to account and sign a further a cam piala }&gt; for the balance. Before the Germans started in the Gulf and Basrah, he used to buy his requirements in India. The goods were sometimes British, and sometimes German or Austrian. The British goods, as a rule, were of better quality, but, being more expensive, he had no profit in selling, and, once the Germans came into the Gulf, there was no chance for British goods to compete with what he could buy through Wonckhaus. He had no trouble with the German Steamer Line over shortage, etc., as this did not concern him : _ Wonckhaus and Company handed him the goods and, if there was any shortage in a package it concerned W oncknaus and Company, not himself. The goods purchased by him from Wonckhaus cost, delivered to his godown, Basrah, about the same price for similar articles bought in Bombay, y-o.6. Bombay. Bah jet Fkmye.—Imports Sugar, Coffee (American) and Wines and Spirits, Hardware and Haberdashery. The Sugar was Tate's Crystal sugar and this was bought in London and came by Strick or Bucknall Line. He also bought Sugar from Austria and Germany, placing is orders through British firms. This sugar used to reach him from Hamburg by German Line. He bought c.i.f. and had no interest in what steamer the cargo came by. Me presumes this was because the freight was cheaper by German than by British steamers. He also bought Belgian sugar through British firms in Basrah This came from Antwerp always by German Line, presumably owing to the fact that the firms, with whom e placed his orders, found it cheaper to ship by German than by English boats. His business in Tate's Crystals was very small, as their price always compared very unfavourably with that of Austria and Germany. His clients in Basrah and Mesopotamia, always wanted the cheapest article. In his opinion, the quality of Tate s Crystal is equal to but not better than, what he bought from Austria or Germany ; when he says equal no anaWsis was made, but all his buyers look to is the shape of the Crystal and the colour, which must be a good white. If Tate's Crystals could be sold at the same price as those from Austria and Germany, he considers that it would have an equal chance in the trade. His reason for trading in American Coffee, instead of in Indian Coffee, is that the price was generally lower and^he preferred to pay less and wait a little longer for the completion of his orders. _ For good Whiskies he went to England, but, as a large proportion of the P oore ' “ here, such as Arab boatmen, lightermen, fellahs, etc., wuld not pay hjh pr^ place his orders in Germany for cheap brands at a price which enabled him to sell here Irom 5s 9 to Ks lil per case/against Rs. 17 to Rs. *0 per ease, which he had to ask for bcotch Whiskies. He used to bring a quantity of cane furniture, glassware, enamelware, and hardware from Austria and Germany always by German steamers, and coul se ere a a p 0 something like Rs. 15 to Rs. 20 per cent., while, if he brought similar goods from England, he 3 not have sold them at a profit. The quality of these German and Austrian goods is not equal to similar goods from England, but out here buyers want cheapness and do not caie anything about quality.In his opinion, if, after the war, the Germans are allowed to open offices^ here as before the war this trade will revert to Germany and Austria again, if British piices do not come down to’the level of German and Austrian. In his opinion, should a preferential tariff be introduced between all British Dominions and Possessions, this will largely assist in keeping the German cheap goods out of this market. He exports both Dates and Wool; his Dates go to India, England, Australia and South Africa, and his wool to France and England. He also did a certain amount of business in suits of clothes, mostly with the Turkish officials, and, on asking for prices from Germany, he had been sent samples ranging from 8 francs a suit to 80 francs; the cheapest quality was so well made that you could hardly tell the difference from the more expensive, but naturally the life of the cheap suits was very short. S. M. Garibian.—His chief imports are in timber, tea, coffee, sugar, and piece-goods. His timber came from Odessa by the Russian Subsidised line; it was white pine; the freight was 14 fanes per 33 c. ft. Owing to this cheap freight, he was able to sell Russian Pine 25 per cent, cheaper than the Indian Serair wood, which comes from Singapore. Previous to the Russian Subsidised line being on the berth, practically all the timber— except date-boxes—-imported into Basrah came from Singapore. Of course, this does not cover teak, which is used for building lighters and which comes from the Malabar Coast. In saying that he has been importing Russian wood from Odessa, he wishes to explain that the wood is not really Russian, but it comes from Austria, and is railed to Odessa. He mentioned that practically the whole trade in Basrah in Singapore wood was in his hands 'while, dealing with wood from Odessa, the profits had to be divided between his firm and another firm. Therefore, it was to his real interest to continue to make his purchases from Singapore, and he had approached the British India, showing them that, against 14 francs from Odessa per 33 c. ft., he could not afford to pay Rs. 35 per ton of 40 c. ft., from Singapore. They, however, did not see their way to make any reduction, though, later, he tried to charter a whole steamer from them. He quite admitted that a freight of 14 francs per 33 c. ft. from Odessa to Basrah was absurd, but, on the other hand, he considered that the B. I. charge of Rs. 35 per 40 c. ft. was too high. He brought a certain number of date-boxes from Odessa, with a view to competing with the Swedish wood which is entirely used for the date trade. The experiment was not a success. The Odessa wood was not as good as the Swedish wood and tne price was so little less that date packers preferred to use the Swedish wood. Should prices in Sweden, after the war, rise and prices from Odessa remain, as they are, in his opinion, it is only a question of time that the wood necessary for the date trade will come from Russia. His tea comes from Calcutta by B. I. Steamers and he is quite satisfied with his treat ment. Of course, at the present moment, owing to war conditions and the Army of Occupation the trade has fallen off, but he really hopes, when times become normal, this trade will not only regain its volume, but increase. In his opinion, Tate’s Crystal sugar is the best quality on the market and, if the price was only a little higher than that asked for Austrian and German qualities, Tate’s would have the preference. Tate’s sugar had come on this market about 3 or 4 years before the war and the demand for it was continually increasing, and prices sometimes compared very favourably with the German sugar seeing that the quality was superior. Morad Meer. —(E. S. David and Company, and Abdulla Elias and Sons, Manchester) cloth merchant; his entire business is in Manchester piece-goods, which he brings out in English ships, either direct or with transhipment in Bombay or Karachi; he prefers shipping by direct boat, as the freight is cheaper and also his goods are less demaged. Menashi -(Isaac Yahooda and Sons, Manchester) piece-goods merchant; he agrees with everything that Morad Meer has stated. Penhas Bekhore .— (Abdulla Elias and Sons, Manchester); he deals mostly in piece-goods from Manchester and Bombay, and from Bombay in sugar, tea and coffee. The sugar really comes from Hong-Kong; owing to the war, he cannot get Belgian sugar, but before the war Belgian sugar was better than the sugar from Hong-Kong. His Bombay people used to make contracts with Belgium for sugar and the sugar would arrive in Basrah on German and Russian boats. His contract with the sugar people was on a c. f. 8f i. basis, and, therefore he had nothing to do with what nationality of steamer brought the cargo, and he has no know ledge of the rate of freight paid. The sugar he now buys from Hong-Kong, he believes, comes from Hong-Kong—does not come from China. They all consider though, without certain knowledge, that, as the sugar always came in German boats, the freight must have been cheaper by those steamers than by British steamers. Ike sugar brought by Russian steamers are small Crystals, while that which came from Belgium are large Crystals. There is no demand for Tate’s cube sugar; all that is wanted in Basrah or Baghdad are Crystal and loaf-sugar.OIL MARKET.—Previous to 1906, the market was controlled by Russian oil, both here and at Gulf ports only very small quantities of American oil being imported. In 1906, the Standard Oil Compapy decided to participate in the trade and sent out direct steamers from New York. The first consignment, however, was of a very poor quality and the brand got into ill repute and little progress was made. Meanwhile, the Germans commenced to import Galician oil from Fiume and made considerable progress until the Standard Oil Company decided to change the brand of their oil, when they ultimately drove the Germans out of the market and secured the lion's share for themselves, only small quantities of Russian oil being imP °About 1910 to 191-2, the trade considerably increased, owing to the importation of oil engines from Europe for irrigation purposes. On the entry of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company into the trade, keen competition took place between them and the Standard Oil Company, with the result that the trade for some time was divided equally between them, but the posi tion to-day, owing to the war and consequent high freights and particularly the close proximity of the Anglo-Persian oil fields to the Persian Gulf, most of the trade is now in then k^BAHRAIN SHELLS.—It is hoped that the sale of shells after the war will be entirely in British hands. It must, however, be remembered that the United Kingdom does not work on a low quality shell and, therefore, buyers must have shipping facilities for reaching foreign ports, where there is a demand for these low qualities. , . , T i In the sevenths and eighties, all the shells from Liugah and Bahrein went to London and, it has been stated that none of the low qualities were ever manipulate 1 in Great Britain. They were sold in London to foreigners and found their way to Germany and Austria, •through Hamburg, etc. Later on, it became unremunerative to consign these shells to London and British merchants had to work through German merchants and consign direct to Hamburg. Later again, when the Hamburg-America Line put m its appearance, owing o special rates of freight granted to Wonckhaus and Company, British merchants, though dealing direct with Hamburg, found the trade impossible, also the native consignment tiade pa8sed g out of their hands, due to reductions in freight granted to the natives m consideration for their placing the sale of the shells in the German firm's hands. With the subsidy of this trade by means of rates of freight, there is no reason to doubt that Wonckhaus and Company s shell business would have been a paying one (perhaps it still was) had they no v i themselves by accepting payment for imports in the form of shells. . i i.. PEARlf SHELLS.—The Sheikhs on the Persian coast could undoubtedly be induced to enter into agreements to reserve the whole supply of pearl shells for B ^ ls ^ 0 ! h g h g U events, to undertake not to permit foreigners to have any share in thetrade In theshell trade very careful study of the market is necessary, as, when the market is low, it i o buying. There is still a large quantity of German shells lying in Lingah, whic i app r n y did increase in the German imports into Lingah from £6,000 in 1912 to £13,000 in 1913 illustrates the great efforts, which they were making to gain control of the market German exports of shells fluctuated a great deal according to the market. !n 1912-13 their totaLexpor^ was only £247. The piece-goods shown in the statistics - ia £5 W Q e 0 r 0 e mostly Manchester by origin. The trade in asafcetida is valuable. In 1912-13 £o,uuu worth was exported to the United Kingdom. . nna l?60 000 is nrobablv The value given of the export of pearls, ranging from £8 000 to £^ , , P 7 much below the mark, since many pearls are taken away by merchants peisonal y sent bv steamers are greatly under-valued in order to reduce the freight. URUGS.—The trade in drugs was developing largely before the war, a great deal of coming from Germany. . i * 4 . SYNTHETIC INDIGO of German origin never gamed real popularity. GUM TRAGACANTH.— British merchants could have secured the whole of thl s trade, which was, as a matter of fact, in the hands of Germans. There is no reason Brit merchants should not secure it now. But the Japanese are alrea ^ bstep in subject, and unless some energy and foresight are shown, it is probable t y P and PERSIAN LAMB W sklNS.-A very big trade in these |kin9 is done and tbe Tmnerial Bank of Persia finance the trade to the extent of £70,000 to , , Z season V The whole of the trade went to Russia, apparently for the reason that English de considered no skin to be genuine unless it bore either the N.jm or ‘^ 0 L 0 el P“ C s stamp. As an experimental measure, a consignment of lamb skins worth ^ 0,1 ‘ f 3 - 0 ® 0 ; ™ ■•e,,,. tched to England from Shiraz shortly before the commencement of the war. It is not known 3 what the fesuit was. There is absolutely no reason why the whole “^^f skins in Enel md should not be supplied direct from Shiraz, instead of tbiough the medi to ROssianfactory. The same Applies to any other skins, which may be available m tbe neig DATE 0&lt;&gt; BOXEs!-The only timber from the East, which could compete against Russian nine is timber from the Straits Settlements, known in Basrah as Javi. In India, deal woo £f „ obtained only in small quantities and in districts where no saw-mills exist. The M an date wood boxes, were inferior in quality to the Norwegian and Swedish boxes and probably also inferior to the boxes from Fiume. The wood was not quite white. There was not the nerfeSion of workmanship. The work of tongueing and grooving was not so accurate as m the European-made box. Each plank of which the box is composed shou d be of one piece ofwood, if possible. If that is not possible the pieces of which each plank is composed should be joined together in the most perfect manner possible. The work of joining is done much more efficiently and neatly in Europe than in India. The Indian wood is a trifle heavier also, with the result that the merchant using it has to pay slightly higher freight, both on the import of the wood into Basrah and on its export again in the shape of boxes full of dates. A priori there would seem to be no reason why the Indian timber traders should not be able to supply boxes suitable for date packing in large quantities, if the necessary machinery were installed. A trader in Karachi has recently sent a sample box constructed of excellent Indian pine wood, but the planks of which it is composed are sawn in such a way, as to make it clear that the object of the manufacturer was in spite of waste of timber, to form each side of the box with a special piece of wood so as to avoid the necessity of having to join together separate pieces. GOLD AND SILVER LA.CE.—The Austrians had this trade before the war, but it is now coming from India, and there is no reason why this trade should not be retained by India after the war. WOOL. —3,380 cwts. of wool were exported la?t year, which was a very large increase on previous exports. It is possible that the wool would have gone to Basrah, but for the lack of steamer facilities there and, in any case, it is unlikely that it would pay to start a baling press in Kuwait, as the wool can easily be diverted to Basrah. ENA MEL WARE.—The trade was done entirely by Austria before the war to the value of about £5,000 or £6,000. It might, perhaps, be captured by India. ASTRAKANS.—A considerable trade might be done in astrakans, which were formerly exported to Russia. CARPETS.—The quality of the manufacture has deteriorated considerably. The use of aniline dye has contributed to this and the weaving is not so carefully done as it used to be. A properly supervised carpet-weaving industry might succeed either at Lar or Jahrum or. better still, at Shiraz. GLASSES.—Glasses with stems for sherbet, have a ready sale. Small glasses for tea, a trifle smaller than the sample produced, would have a good sale. SUGAR.—The statistics appear to indicate a large rise of imports of sugar in German ships in the year 1913, but, owing to the fact that the figures were procured from the mani fests for the first time that year, it cannot be stated with certainty that the imports in German ships befoieT913 were much greater than the figures in the trade reports appear to indicate. At the same time, it is believed that the Germans made a special effort to import large quantities of sugar in 1913, in view of the newly realized possibilities for making large profits on sugar smuggled from Bahrain to Persia. Before the war, Austrian and German sugar was mostly imported. The majority of the Austrian sugar was transhipped either at Karachi or Bombay, but German sugar used to go direct from Bushire. Most of the crystal sugar was Austrian and practically all the loaf sugar was Austrian and German. The local merchants went for the cheapest kind of sugar. Tate's sugar, though better in quality, had only a small sale. At present, the market is supplied with Java and Hongkong sugar, the latter being imported with Japanese brands. AU over the Gulf, in the past, it was inevitable to import German sugar, in order to do business, because it was the cheapest. Sugar must also be in packages, not exceeding cwts. each, with a view to carriage by caravan. RICE.—Rice mostly comes from Calcutta,* Rangoon rice, being of inferior quality, is not so much in demand. The imports of 1914 were double those for 1913-14, but this is explained by the fact that rice importation generally takes place in March or April and, if the steamers happen to arrive in April one year and in March the following year, the imports by both steamers would be included in one year's returns. COFFEE.—Before the war, the greater part of the coffee in the years 1909—1911 was Brazilian imported in German ships, but Indian coffee was.gaining ground in 1912-13. It now monopolizes the market. TEA.—Arabs in Basrah are getting into the habit of drinking tea, and an increasing quantity is now drunk in the districts also. In Basrah, coffee is still preferred, and most of the tea, which is imported into Baghdad, is in transit for the Persian trade and is ordinarily smuggled across the frontier in order to avoid payment of the high tariff. PIECE-GOODS.—Among the biggest items of import are piece-goods, and especially sheet’ng, known as “ American,' which is imported from Aden. A certain amount of the A.merican sheeting was made in Bombay, but it was of inferior quality and dirty in appear ance. Its popularity depended upon its cheapness. It is remarkable that Manchester has not endeavoured to cut into this trade which is of great importance. Aden is a great distributing centre. The Japanese have now an imitation of American sheeting on the market, which is quite equal to “ A ' quality of the American product. The American goods are very slightly superior in quality to the Japanese, and possibly the Americans might regain the market, if they could sell more cheaply after the war. The Arabs will buy the cheaper quality, unless there is any marked difference. The Indian sheeting is cheaper than Japanese, but does not sell so well, owing to defects of quality. If the Bombay mills were to turn their attention to this, they might be able to under-sell the Japanese in an article of similar quality. BANKING.—If any bank prepared to lend money were willing to open a branch at Lingah from the month of April to October, they could do considerable business. In April, they would finance pearl ventures and would reap their return before the end of October. The pearl business is extremely speculative, and it would be necessary to exercise much caution in making advances. During the rest of the year, there would be a small exchange business and possibly the merchants might be induced to bank their funds.S7 PACK TRANSPORT.—If a company could be formed, which could secure the concession for pack transport between Bushire and Shiraz, there would seem no reason why it should not be commercially successful. It would be necessary for the company either to own their own mules or to enter into contracts with muleteers in such a manner as to ensure invariably a constant supply of animals. But there can be no doubt that the effect on trade, as a whole, would be highly beneficial. It is probable that in Shiraz itself a great deal of capital would be available for the inauguration of such a company, provided that British support were given to the scheme. One condition essential to the existence of any such company would be the proper policing of the road, which could presumably only be done under Government auspices. Three or four years ago, an attempt was made to control the mule supply under an arrangement called the Naqlieh, by which all the available mule transport was to be appor tioned out among the merchants, who desired to forward goods between Bushire and Shiraz. The idea was that mule transport should be shared among the merchants equitably, so that no single merchant should gain an advantage at the expense of others. The object of the scheme was largely to benefit the smaller traders and introduce a larger number of merchants to a share in the direct trade with Manchester. This measure met with strong opposition, because many merchants, who were doing business in a large way were unable to get sufficient transport to bring up whole consignments at once, and the fulfilment of their obligations was, in consequence, delayed. They were unable to obtain the transport that they required within a reasonable time, in spite of the fact that they were willing to pay largely increased rates in order to ensure their goods being transported rapidly so as to avoid losing a favourable market. The actual importers of the goods, who in the majority of cases lived in Shiraz, objected strongly to the arrangement, because they had no share in the control of the mules and the Bushire agents were able to favour some Shiraz merchants at the expense of others. The muleteers also objected, because it restricted their freedom of contract and prevented them taking advantage of good rates, which they might otherwise have secured. So far as the object of the measure was to encourage small traders to deal direct with Manchester, it was of very questionable efficacy as a means of extending and encouraging British trade. Man chester firms, who dealt with small traders, often had serious reason afterwards to repent having done so, and, in many instances, after disastrous experiences, they abandoned the market. The small trader was often seriously hampered in his efforts by the fact that he was only able to secure a small quantity of his goods at a time. He was thus unable to meet his obligations and, having no credit and very little capital, he speedily succumbed. The measure thus defeated its own object. BASRAH-BAGHDAD RIVER NAVIGATION.—Steamers should not exceed in length 230 feet and a beam measurement, with two barges, of not more than 120 feet. River is in flood in April and navigation commences to get difficult about the middle of July and does not improve until December. During that period, it is not advisable to load steamers of barges to a bigger draft than 3' O'. Nahibeh Steamer. Note. A railway to Baghdad will no doubt lessen considerably the passenger traffic (Basrah to Baghdad, and vice versa) as far as natives are concerned, should the 3rd class fare demanded by the railway not exceed the deck fare on steamers the cost of food necessitated by the water journey. This means that to a certain extent the water transport to Baghdad and back could be served by tugs towing barges. IRRIGATION.—Irrigation, in the Baghdad Vilayet in particular, should have good prospects, as it has been found in the past that, wherever water can be made easily available, settlers increase under the muquataa system. The cultivator in the Baghdad Vilayet has to work much harder for his living than in the Basrah Vilayet, owing to the scarcity of water and he readily takes advantage of improved facilities for irrigation. In the Mosul District, for instance, the Chaldeans of Talkaif, in a year when water is scarce locally, travel as far as Adana, where a great deal of cotton is grown, and, after earning good wages, return to their own country. There is annually great difficulty in bringing grain from the Garraf District along the Hai River, which is one of the principal grain-producing areas, in consequence of88 t u s the fact that the water disappears from the Hai at the end of ^ June at the latest. Some of the new season’s giain can be collected on the banks of the Hai in time to be shipped before the Hai runs dry but a great deal is necessarily locked up until the following year. Lighters crowd into the Hai from Kut as soon as the river is high enough to permit of a passage, but they are never able to finish the transport work before the river runs dry. AGRICULTURE.—The staple crop of the country is wheat, but the cultivators would be prepared to put down whatever crop might pay them best. A large irrigated area could be made available for cotton. Much rice is grown in the eastern area and also sesame. Dizful used to be famous for its indigo and the industry would, no doubt, repay encourage ment. The output would have to be increased by modern methods. The quality of the indigo is said to be verv good. Cotton is an important local crop and the climate appears suitable. It is noteworthy that dates cannot be grown in Dizful. Oranges do very well. If a model farm were started, irrigated by centrifugal pumps and tilled by agricultural machinery, local methods would probably be revolutionised, since the people are eager to learn and' would readily adopt improved methods.. Pump irrigation would be much the cheapest, as the Diz river carries* down large quantities of silt which chokes up the channels and has to be cleared out every year at a heavy cost. The silt of the Diz has very little value as a fertiliser. If an agricultural expert, perhaps from Egypt, could be deputed for a couple of years, it would probably suffice to teach the cultivators how to do things for themselves. Dizful has much greater possibilities than Shushtar, which is a dead town and which has no market behind it, except for the Bakhtiaris in the winter. Shushtar is in a blind alley, because the Luristan and Kirman trade must go through Dizful, while the Ispahan trade must go through Ahwaz. The cultivable lands are not so rich in Shushtar as round Dizful and the population is slender. Given security and irrigation in the Dizful plain, there is every likeli hood that the mountain people will come down and settle in groups. There is any amount of water power available at Dizful. Electric light and power for mills and other industries could be delivered all over the town. THE FUTURE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT OF MESOPOTAMIA.— 1 J shall confine my remarks to Lower Mesopotamia as the prospects of Upper Mesopotamia have been briefly discussed by Sir William Willcocks in connection with his irrigation proposals, while we have had no opportunity during the war of supplementing the information collected by him or of examining the present agricultural conditions of the country. Recent developments have brought within the scope of practical politics unity of controP over all the waters of Mesopotamia, and we may assume that the whole of Sir William Willcocks' programme will materialise in due course under the guidance, if not under the direct direction of a power, which will not overlook the requirements of Lower Mesopotamia, while promoting the developments of the resources of Upper Mesopotamia. We may therefore assume that water at any rate will be available in plenty for the exploitation of the agricultural possibilities of the Basrah Vilayat. 2. On the basis of somewhat scanty revenue statistics I have arrived with some diffidence at the conclusion that the cultivated area of Lower Mesopotamia does not exceed 500,000 acres. If this figure is somewhat below the mark it may be assumed that my estimates of acreage yields are correspondingly exaggerated and for this reason my estimate of area may, perhaps, be taken as the measure of the resources of the country on the basis of the acreage yields assumed for the various classes of crops. The whole area of the Basrah Vilayat including the lands to the east of the Hai river, deserts and marshes appears to be about 17,000 square miles or roughly 11,000,000 acres, of which some 3,500 square miles or million acres may be assigned to the unknown country between the Hai and Tigris, in respect of which it is impossible to estimate the area under cultivation, while a further 7,500 square miles or approximately 4f millions of acres may be allowed for the main desert and marsh areas. The remaining 4,000,000 acres represent the inhabited area of Lower Meso potamia, a medley of marsh, desert, rivers, canals and cultivation, the last named category apparently counting for one-eighth of the {f inhabited ” area and less than one- twentieth of the whole area of the Vilayat, though doubtless a considerable portion of the Hai area will have to be added to the total cultivated area as soon as it becomes possible to investigate conditions there. 3. As in the case of acreage we have the most scanty information to work on as regards population and more particularly as regards the proportion thereof which may be considered effective from the point of view of agricultural development. Three million souls would be perhaps as high a figure as it would be safe to assume as the population of the whole country including Nomads and Marsh Arabs. This would give a density of about 174 per square mile for the whole area and 480 per square mile for the inhabited area’'. Nomads and marshmen have in the past shown a tendency to settle down when a favourable agricultural opening offered and may be considered available for any further agricultural extension which may take place in the future, but, on the other hand, we must remember that under present conditions a considerable section of the tribal community, namely, the yeomen or armed retainer class and the women, not only is not accustomed to work on the fields but considers it a disgrace to do so. Under the unsettled conditions of the past, long' life has not unnaturally not been an attribute of the Arabs and the number of Arabs incapacitated for work by age is negligible. 'We need, therefore, only exclude from the total prospective working population, that section which consists of young children, yeomen, and in tribal areas, women perhaps rone-half of the whole population, though it is to be hoped and may safely be anticipated that necessity and the fear of invasion by foreign elements will before long induce the lazy yeomen and even women to a large extent to lend a helping hand in agricultural operations. If, therefore, we are right in assuming a total population of three millions for the Basrah Vilayat, we may take the effective population available for one kind of work or another under present conditions as being about one and a half million, with a prospective access of another 500,000 in the not distant future. This estimate of some 2 millions of persons available for work may prove to be somewhat exaggerated, but it would be reasonably safe to assume for present purposes that the available native working population will not be less than one and a half millions. This gives us an estimate of rather more than seven acres per head of effective population over the entire area of the Vilayat, that is to say, that every working member of the population will have to till and cultivate about 7 acres by his own unaided efforts, while a family (of, say, five persons) will be responsible, for the development of about 30 acres, of which under existing conditions only about 2 acres, at the most, are under cultivation, while another ten may be ruled out as unsusceptible of development. It is difficult without statistics to say how this compares with the conditions obtaining, for instance, in India, but my impression is that ten acres in all per family would be a generous estimate. There would, therefore, seem to be ample room for any influx of prospective cultivators from the Arabian deserts and Persian hills which is likely to be attracted by the hope of settled prosperity. At the same time it does not look as if, so far as lower Mesopotamia alone is concerned, the requirements of agriculture will necessitate the importation of settlers from further afield. The chief weakness of the people of Iraq is that they are bad and lazy cultiva tors, but this shortcoming is more likely to be redressed by the introduction of some sound system of agricultural education than by the competition of more experienced foreign culti vators, whose interests would not be compatible with those of the local element and whose advent would delay rather than facilitate the pacification of the tribes and might well in the long run result in their extermination. 4). A third and very important consideration to be borne in mind—one indeed that to a large extent accounts for the inborn laziness of the cultivating elements of Bower Mesopota mia, is the nature of the soil, water and crops of the country. The most important crops are dates and rice which yield abundantly in response to but little labour ; the water of the Tigris and the Euphrates defy all efforts at control unless the latest developments of modern science be brought into play, while at the same time by reason of the high proportion of silt contained in it, it fertilises where it flows and renders the labour of ploughing superfluous; while the soil of the country is but river silt deposited through the ages and continually renewed by further deposits and is thul of an unrivalled fertility, wanting only water and seed for its development. 5. The material we have to work on in Lower Mesopotamia is thus, firstly, an immense area of land, which,though fertile, is to a large extent owing to excess or want of water incapable of cultivation under existing conditions; secondly, a volume of silt laden water capable of watering and fertilising the whole of the avilable area ; and, thirdly, lazy and turbulent population perhaps just sufficient in point of numbers to till the lands ready to their hand if only they can be induced to forego their turbulence and sensual comforts to take part in the race for wealth and prosperity with nations which have had a long start though not more richly endowed with some of the most essential initial advantages. There can, however, be no question that the initiative in the development of the country must come ^rom outside, seeing that by far the most urgent need is for the application of the lessons of modern science to the solution of local problems^ which, though attacked piecemeal and more or less successfully solved for a time by the great nations of the distant past, have resolutely defied all human efforts under the segis of the Ottoman Empire, which has as it were lived on its capital and never taken steps to lay out any portion thereof on the improvement of its permanent resources. The future Govern ment of Lower Mesopotamia will, therefore, have to begin from the beginning, carrying on existing arrangements as a temporary makeshift while working out the programme of the future on well considered scientific lines, from which, wffien once approved and put in train, no deviation should be possible or necessary. The first step in the desired direction must, therefore, be study, a study of the country itself resulting in the preparation of a complete and comprehensive survey map and statistics—so far as possible —relating to existing resources, on which estimates of future assets may be based, themselves to form the basis of constructive development proposals on the sound financial lines; study of the irrigation prospects of the country following the survey and resulting in concrete pro posals as to the works to be taken in hand for the extension of irrigation and the improve ments of communications and the order in which they should be put into operation ; and finally study of the people and their ways and methods of agiculture on which to base the creation of an instructional organisation whose aim would be to get the best possible results out of the material found on the spot or placed at its disposal by modern science and at the same time to form a link between local agriculture and the markets of the world. I he study period would occupy some time, during which progress need not be delayed but would proceed on tentative and experimental lines, which would have an important bearing on future policy. Then would follow the period of action and construction on lines indicated by enquiry and experiment, progress in the development programme being accompanied by ever increasing exports of the products of the land to pay for the expenses incurred in develop ment until in due course the whole area would attain its maximum limit of development and Lower Mesopotamia would become a creditor in the worhTs markets.X V 90 6. Before proceeding to the consideration of the details of the work before us it will not be out of place to summarise and review the results of such action as has been taken in the desired direction during the past 2^ years of the British occupation. In the first place a more or less complete topographical survey has been made of the whole area of Lower Mesopotamia during the war and since September, 1916, tentative attempts have been made to carry out a more detailed survey for revenue purposes, but this has not made very much progress up to date. We have, however, acquired a fairly useful knowledge of the o-eneral lie of the land and in isolated tracts we have gathered more detailed information regarding areas under various kinds of crops. With regard to the control of the rivers little has been done from the agricultural point of view though it is to be hoped that the River Conservancy Department has collected a mass of information regarding levels and discharges and river action generally which will be of inestimable value to the irrigation experts who will take up the work of Sir William Willcocks where he left it. finally as regards crops and cultivators a good deal of material has been collected bv the officers engaged in the task of civil administration ; a good many reports have been written on a variety of subjects; the Agricultural Department, which has worked under the diiection of the Supply and_Transport Corps mainly with a view to encouraging the cultivation of vegetables to meet the military demand, has done no little good by introducing machine pumps and other improved implements of agriculture, while directing into useful channels the ergies of a considerable number of owners and cultivators not unready to profit by the abnoi mal situation ; the new Local Produce Department of the same corps is in process of collecting information about crop prospects and yields; while the Political and Revenue f aV %“ U n h /^ f0rm &gt; ati0n - at their d!s l )osal regarding: miscellaneous matters of of , Bnt ’ lar .S e 1 l . v °'' m g t0 a paucity of officers in the various departments ol the civil administration, it has been possible to do but little in the direction of collectino- am abulating- the vast mass of available information scattered about in the files of a number of offices and the mam shortcoming of the local civil administration is that it has been amble the mason above stated to keep pace with its current obligations let alone to prenare the way for the administration of the future, which will doubtless efpect to be placed to posse^Ln , , y 6 . ana nged library of all necessary information at its inception but will in fact have to begin its work with the process of digesting the meal, which its preZe^r s swallow^ in haste and under considerable pressure. It is to be regretted that just at the momlnt whe! , a ministiation showed signs of being almost adequately staffed, the demands of the channed mibtary situation have suddenly thrown it out of gear and have left it a? before strunS 1 its daily task and unable to perform its no less important duty of paving a wav for fSturc con ohdation and development.

So much by way of preliminary discussion of general considerations. We may now turn to matters of detail and attempt to give some indication of the lines along which the existing resources of the country may be developed and the extent to which the requirements of the world s markets may be met by the exploitation of Mesopotamia in directions hitherto not dreamed of by its inhabitants. 9. One of the first problems to be tackled before the Government of the country commits itself to a wholesale surrender of the length and breadth of the land to the irrigation engineer must be that of the rival merits of pastoral and agricultural development. We have already seen ^ that the uncultivated areas of Lower Mesopotamia and the bordering hills of Persia provide grazing for sheep in their millions and that these sheep move from pasture to pasture according to the season and, in addition to meat, milk, butter, and other articles of local diet, meet a small fraction of the demands of foreign markets for wool and hides— articles which already constitute an important commercial asset of the country. It will obviously be impolitic in the extreme to sacrifice this asset entirely to the prospect of possibly greater profits from agriculture or even to abandon the whole of the wool and hide trade to Persia, whose hills are permanently of a pastoral nature ; while at the same time the abandon ment of the immense areas necessitated by the present nomadic character of the sheep of Mesopotamia to grazing at the expense of agriculture is too extravagant a policy to be embarked on without reservations. I have, however, pointed out that the extension of irriga tion throughout the plains of Lower Mesopotamia and the expansion of agriculture are likely to result in the abandonment of nomadic life by the Arab generally or at any rate to a considerable extent.^ It is obvious, therefore, that the flocks of the Arabs will follow suit and that, in due course, in place of the immense congregations of sheep, which may be seen under existing conditions for instance in the Bani Lam plain between the Tigris and the Persian hills, we shall find smaller flocks more or less permanently attached to the scattered habita tions, which will spring up wherever irrigation creates opportunities for settled cultivation, provided that grazing grounds are available. The question of providing such grazing grounds by statute orjother form of compulsion will, therefore, have to be very carefully considered in connection with every irrigation scheme taken in hand. Extensive common lands will have to be left vacant permanenlty or in rotation and the natural pastural habits of the people will have to be encouraged by the provision of facilities for the marketing of the produce of their flocks. In such circumstances there is no reason why there should not be a steady increase in the numbers of sheep in the country from year to year and a corresponding increase in the quantity of wool and hides—to say nothing of other products—sent to foreign markets. It is foi this reason that I would advocate the early formation of a strong veterinary department, whose main function would be to safeguard on scientific lines the pastoral resources of the country pari passu with the extension of irrigation and cultivation and in such way as to take full advantage of the former without interfering with the legitimate claims of the latter. An incidental part of its functions would, indeed, be to improve both in point of numbers and quality at the present negligible resources of the country in the matter of ploughmen and other beasts of burden, while it would also take in hand the conservation of buffaloes, poultry breeding and other spheres of activity tending to the general prosperity of the country,^ which as a prospective seller of produce should aim at producing rather than importing all things likely to be required for its own consumption, for the production of which facilities already exist. Finally it would be the function of this department to work in close co-operation with the commercial department with a view to educating its own proteges as to the most profitable channels into which to direct their energies and to keep those responsible for the development for commercial openings au fait with the capabilities of the pastoral elements of the country. It is difficult to form an estimate of the proportion of the whole area of the country which would eventually be reserved for a pastoral programme on the lines above^ indicated, but, what with the reclamations of the marshes and areas inaccessible to irrigation and specially reserved common lands taken out of the cultivable area, it would not seem unreasonable to assume that not less than 2,000,000 acres out of the total area of 11,000,000 acres will or should eventually be earmarked for pastoral develop ment and will, therefore, not be available for agriculture. 10. We may now consider collectively the resources of the marsh and saline areas and the result of development in other directions on them. It may be assumed that every effort will be made to reduce these areas to a minimum, such reduction being compensated lor by more scientific treatment of irredeemable tracts with a view to keeping up the supply of reeds, mats, rushes, salt^ and such necessities of life at least up to the standard set by local demand. In this connection it must be borne in mind that, prior to the war, the marshes constituted little but an enduring encumbrance on the country, the whole of whose needs in the matter of reeds, etc., were easily satisfied by sporadic operations on the fringes of tho marsh area, and that the great areas under salt were a hindrance to the working of what might have been an important source of revenue rather than a centre of supply to outlying parts of the Turkish Empire, It was in these circumstances that these areas were never fuDy ©xploitcdj but duiing* the war greater demands have been made on their resources in connection with military operations and the exploitation of the marsh has only been limited by the supply of labour, while in the case of salt, it has been found more expedient to import the bulk of our requirements from India rather than to introduce up to date plant for theproper working of local supplies. We may, therefore, safely assume that a substantial curtail ment of area will have no marked effect on the capacity of the country to support itself m salt, reeds, etc., if proper arrangements are made for the working of such areas a,s defy all efforts at development in other directions, and all we are here concerned tc^ consider is the proportion of the whole area of marsh and saline soil which must of necessity be left as it is simply because it is irredeemable. Here we are necessarily in the realm of conjecture and he would be a bold man who would deny the possibility of reclaiming, for instance, the whole of the Hawiza marsh on the Hor Sannaf. It would, however, seem tolerably safe to assume that an area of at least 3,000,000 acres will be permanently left for the development of salt deposits and marsh products. The former should be made over to a small expert department which should also be generally charged with the gradual prevention of illicit salt manufacture, while the irrigation department would take in hand the heroic task of cleansing of salt such areas as are not reserved for its production as an article of food supply. _ It would scarcely be necessary to establish scientific control over marsh areas, whose exploitation would naturally come within the ken of the Public Works Department of the future, while the possibilities of using them as storage reservoirs for the replenishment of canals in the low water season would fall within the purview of the irrigation department. II. In the preceding paragraphs I have assumed that some 5,000,000 acres out of the conjectural total of 11,000,000 acres taken as the area of Lower Mesopotamia will be aban doned to the development of the non-agricultural resources of the country. 1 he balance of 6,000,000 acres should, therefore, be available for agricultural purposes with two small reservations, which may be briefly disposed of. Anyone who is familiar with the general aspect of the country will at once admit the necessity of some kind of attempt at scientific afforestation, whether with a view to creating a local supply of woodfuel and timber or of increasing the rainfall or of providing shade for.man and beast and crops. Afforestat’On should rot be a difficult problem to provide for in connection with irrigation schemes, experimental reserves being created on the lines suggested in connection with pastoral development and handed over to an expert forest department for development. _ Such a department could without difficulty account for some 300,000 acres without making too large demands on the available water supply and by doing so wuuld relieve the date producer of the obligation to provide timber in large quantities which the necessities of w*ar have imposed on him temporarily, while another 200,000 acres might be made over for the exploitation of gypsum resources, this area being handed over to an expert branch of the Public Works Department for experimental work. It is practically impossible to forecast the lines on which these two departments would develop the areas entursted to their care, but the fertility of the soil of Mesopotamia affords hope of considerable success in the creation of avenues of shade-giving trees almost anywhere, while the necessity of finding some local substitute for road metal will doubtless result in the invention of a practical method of developing the problematic gypsum resources of the country. 12. Of the remaining area of 5| millions of acres some 500,000 acres may be set apart for habitations, canals, rivers, railways, etc., and a clear 5,000,000 acres remain open to agi’icultural development, of which only about half a million acres are already^ productive of crops roughly in the proportions given at paragraph 21 of Section B of this note. It now remains to consider the extent to which the areas under the crops there mentioned may be expanded and other crops introduced to give variety to the scheme. 13. As has already been pointed out, the greatest agricultural asset of Lower Mesopo tamia is its date crop and I shall assume that foreign markets are capable of absorbing any increase in that crop which can be effected by development of the area under palms and of ihe quality of dates. Under Turkish rule the cultivation of datepalms was in practice restricted to what are known as Tapu lands and to the vague hinterland of such holdings on which enterprising owners encroached under the authority of certain provisions of the Tapu law, which it is unnecessary to specify. At the same time date cultivators were limited by the lack of irrigation facilities to areas situated along the banks of rivers, creeks and ca: als, while date groves were liable to destructive inundations on a large scale, which defied the efforts of all but the most energetic and resourceful owners to protect their properties from sudden annihilation. The result of these influences has been that long thin belts of palms, interrupted at intervals by extensive bare or almost bare patches, have established themselves along the Shatt-el-Arab and Euphrates river, i.e., the region of Tapu owned lands, while the Tigris, with unimportant exceptions in the immediate neighbourhood of Q,alat Salih and Amarah, is destitute of date grovesowing to the fact that the lands irrigated by its waters is the property not of private individuals with permanent rights and interests therein but of a Government, which was not only content to leave the cultivation of its lands to farmers but, being obsessed with an unreasonable fear lest anything like permanency of occupation should encourage those farmers to claim proprietary rights and bid for political independence, dis couraged the planting of date groves and the building of permanent habitations by ringing the changes upon its lessees with amazing and suicidal frequency. M ith Government unwi ing in tracts like the Shatt-el-Arab area to undertake extensive operations for the protection o exposed gardens, unable generally to undertake large irrigation schemes like the propose ao canal for instance, wdiich would have resulted in an immense extension of the area under dates into the desert between Basrah and Zubair, and equally unwilling to guarantee l®'^ ar | security of tenure in the Crown lauds of the Amarah district, it is scarcely surprising tiia on y partial advantage has been taken of the natural aptitude of the soil and climatic conditions o93 Mesopotamia for date cultivation. It is at the same time instructive to observe that one of the most promising date producing areas of Lower Mesopotamia at the present time is the Suq-al-Shuyukh district^ whose people have during the past twenty years learned to despise the Turkish Government and have evinced their confidence in their ability to parry official inter ference by steadily extending the area under dates with the result that, with the exception of some of the best groves on the Shatt-el-Arab, no part of Mesopotamia can beast of so large a proportion of comparatively recently planted gardens as the Lower Euphrates basin. It will be clear from the aboye that the first condition of successful date cultivation is absolute security of tenure as it takes a grove on the average from to 15 years to attain its full productive capacity ; One of the first duties of the Government of Lower Mesopotamia must, therefore, be the institution of a comprehensive enquiry into the question of proprietary rights generally followed by the adoption of a generons policy in the matter of the conferring of such rights in all areas susceptible of immediate development, that is to say, in practically all lands situated on the banks of rivers and canals to a distance of, say, one mile therefrom. It would at the same time probably be sound to make the conferment of proprietary rights in such areas conditional on the proper prosecution of date cultivation in a specified proportion of the area granted in each case with the double object of increasing the total output of dates and of providing shade for fruit trees, vegetables and other crops. Security of tenure being thus established and every inducement being given to owners to invest their money and labour in the profitable business of palmraising, the irrigation department must take in hand the task of protecting exposed areas from sudden inundations in flood time and of assuring a steady supply of water to present and prospective plantations. At the same time the prosecution of new irrigation schemes and especially of the Fao canal project would open up large areas of new barren land to the date grower and tbe agricultural department would take in hand the task of educating him up to a more careful selection of varieties with a view to its being able to place on the market some of the more valuable classes of dates in sufficieut quantities to gain the appreciation of foreign consumers. It is, of course, impossible to hazard an opinion as to the extent to which date cultivation might be pushed under really favourable conditions as to tenure, irrigation and protection, the whole of the Basrah Zubair desert, for instance, might be converted into a palm forest by the excavation of the projected Fao carnal and its distributaries, while the banks of the Amarah canals might be clothed with a fringe of palms of considerable depth throughout their length, to say nothing of the Tigris itself from Kut-al-Amara to Qurna. One million acres would, tuerefore, not seem to be an unduly exaggerated estimate of the possibilities of the country in this direction, while such an area would contain some 100 millions of palms, yielding 25 millions of maunds of dates worth 12£ crores per annum to the producer and about £100,000 of revenue to the State. These figures are amazing enough and, if reliable, from an instruc tive commentary on the negligence and blighting influence of the Turkish Government; yet it would seem that, under a more reasonable regime, the only factor likely to curtail the exten sion of palm cultivation to the extent indicated here is the demand for dates by foreign markets, which can perhaps scarcely be expected to rival the supply, at any rate for some time to come. The above estimate of the extension of date cultivation may, therefore, be accepted provisionally as the measure of the capacity of the country itself.
