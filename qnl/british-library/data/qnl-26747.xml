Sir, I have the honour to be, etc.,etc., S.M.Nai m Afghan MinisterExt 6983/46 The memorandum drawn up by the Foreign Office in 1929 covers the case of an application by the Afghan Minister for permission to export arms to the King of Afghanistan personally (Appendix No. 2A(ivJ) # It will be observed that the procedure there suggested is that H.M. Minister, Kabul, should be asked to make confidential, enquiries. It does not appear that this procedure has ever been required before, and perhaps we might have regard to the altered circumstances. On the other hand, I am not certain what regulations are in force in India regarding the transit of ammunition over their territories; it will be observed that in previous cases it has been necessary to ask the Government of India to issue a temporary licence. Presumably, we should refer the matter to Political Department for information on this point before asking the (.&amp; 0. Department if they can help in expediting the shipment of this consignment.

Minute Paper. Department. rs The Government of India have asked the ^ T I Kabul Legation to obtain from the Afghan Government a detailed list of certain sporting guns end accessories which have arrived at Karachi from London, and refer to the provisions of letter II attached to the Afghan Treaty of 1921. It seems rather strange that they should have done so, since it has all along been agreed that arms of this kind do not come under the treaty, and in fact - see papers . 4091/31 (copy sent to Foreign Office, 2nd July, 1) - the Government of India approved the ister’s proposal that consignments of this sort uld be sent to Afghanistan under customs seal without payment of duty, on the Afghan Government givirg particulars of the arms and the name of the consignee. This formality seems already to have been complied with by the Afghan Consul at Karachi, and the further reference to Kabul appears to have been totally unnecessary. Fort h ern Departme nt , 'w—| ,, n,- r ,, ~ IffiMOa&amp;XIXlUK o f Appl loation s for the Export of Arms and Hunitions to Afghanistan. !• 'fhe provisions of the Anglo-.Afghan Treaty of 1931 relating to the importation of anas and munitions into Afghanistan are contained in the latter part of article 6 and in letters I and II attached to the Treaty. The relevant texts are given in appendix Bo.l. The meaning of 'arms and munitions' 1 is considered in paragraph 12 . 2. Although these provisions allow His lidajesty’s Governxaent in certain circumstances to detain arms passing through India or through British ports on their way to Afghanistan, His Majesty's Government are for all practical purposes under a treaty obligation to let the Afghan Government import without hindrance or restriction whatever arms it desires. 3. tfith regard to the supply of arms from this country, the effect of the Treaty is not equally clear, but His Majesty's Government are in any case under no obligation to sell arms and they can always bring pressure to bear in order to top private firms from doing so. It is, however, desirable on military and commercial grounds that if the Afghan Government purchase arms at all they shall purchase them in this Country or in India, and essential on political grounds that His Majesty's Government shall in practice do nothing to give the impression that they desire to prevent the Afghan Government from acquiring arms in any quantity it pleases. Here again, therefore, with the possible exception of arms which cannot be acquired from any other source, His Majesty's Government have for all practical purposes no alternative but to let the Afghan GovermaentGovernment purchase in this country and export to Afghanistan whatever arras they desire. 4. fhese conditions are unliely to change except as the result of major developments in our relations with Afghanistan ana form the background to the problem of ensuring that arms imported into Afghanistan through Indian territory are really intended for, and reach, the Afghan Government. 5. r fhat measures to ensure this are necessary is apparent from past incidents suggesting that Afghan officials both at home ana abroad have been in the habit of purohasin service rifles on their own account and with the object of selling them to private persons in -Afghanistan or in tribal territory on the Korta-./est frontier. These purchases have sometimes, but not always, been maae in the name of the Afghan Government. 6. As a result of these incidents His Majesty*s Government have decided, after consultation with the Government of India and His Majesty*s Minister at Kabul, that permission to export arms from this country will not be given unless or until the Afghan Government have formally notified His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul of their intention to import such arms for their own use. This procedure must apparently be regarded as a slight advance upon that provided for by the actual wording of letter II attached to the treaty, by which the Afghan Government undertake to furnish to His Majesty’s Minister details of all arms to be imported into Afghan t rrilbry from the ports of Great Britain and British India before their importation at British ports (an expression #iich, in the case of goods originating in Great Britain, can, it appear , only mean British Indian ports). In demanding,therefore, that the notificationnotification required by letter II shall take place before exportation from British, ports (i.e, ports of Great Britain), His Majesty’s Government cannot perhaps claim to be acting on the strict letter of their treaty rights; but the demand is a logical extension of the principle involved in letter II, and insofar as it reduces the chance of arms exported from Great Britain being subsequently detained in India, it is as much in the interests of the Afghan Government as of His ivlajesty's Government (see paragraphs 8 and 12). Applications by the Afghan Government for t le importation of arms not by themselves, but by private traders, will be resisted to the utmost. 7. As additional precautions His Majesty’s Government have decided that all arms (except those exported under sections viii, ix, x and xi of appendix Ho.2) must be consigned to, and their cases labelled for, the Afghan Government (or the King of Afghanistan) o/o the Afghan Consul at Karachi (or Bombay), and that when rifles are exported the manufacturer’s numbers shall whenever possible be ascertained and communicated to the Government of India. The first of these lessens to some e extent the risk of misdirection after the arms reach India, while the second facilitates enormously the task of tracing the origin of rifles found in tribal territory. The names of vessels by which arms are shipped and the port of destination in India must also be furnished by the Afghan Government or their representatives abroad, or by the agents to whom the licences are issued, in order that they may be communicated in advance to the Government of India (see appendix 2, section C). 8. Prior notification to His Majesty's Minister is, however, the important point, as the only means by which His Majesty’s Government and the Government of India can ohec-; the leakage of arms and ammunitionammunition into tribal territory is by being able to bring home to the ^ifghan Government themselves the ultimate responsibility for all arms and ammunition found there* Inoiuentally it is in the interest of the Afghan Government, whatever they may do on their own account, to prevent leakage through the negligence or dishonesty of their officials and they have in the past welcomed, and even suggested, strict adherence to the procedure of letter II* 9. Although this procedure is well known to the Afghan Government and should bo well known to their representatives abroad, applications for export licences may still be received from time to time without the necessary notification having already been made by the Afghan Government. It is therefore desirable that working rules should be adopted for dealing with them. The details of these as agreed upon between the Departments concerned are given in appendix Ho*2. 10* These rules must, however, be interpreted in the light of the following considerations; firstly, in communicating their decisions to the Government of India and His fciajesty’s Minister at Kabul His Majesty* s Government have reserved the right to waive prior notification at Kabul \hen Afghan diplomatists desire to send or take arms to Afghanistan for their personal use. For tills there are special reasons. The difficulties of interfering with diplomatic privilege are considerable and His Majesty’s Government cannot ordinarily prevent a departing foreign diplomatist from tailing with him his private property, whether this consists of rifles or anytuing else* The same principle applies strictly speaking to his passage through India, especially if he is returning every from his post. Accordingly, while/effort will be made to reduce to a minimum the moveraent of arms under the Ipiise of diplomatic privilege and while the working rulesIndicate a certain line to be followed with this object in view, there may be ooc sions when it will be necessary to acquiesce in the transit of arms not actually destined for the Afghan Government. As to what constitutes a reasonable quantity of arms for the personal use of a diplomatist, no final ruling can be given. Even a single service rifle might be considered too many, but on occasions it may be Judicious to allow a larger number. 11. Secondly, these measures are adopted purely on grounds of expediency and if a case occjirs in which the expediency of immediate compliance with some application outweighs the expediency of taking the usual precautions, His Majesty’s Government will have no hesitation in over-riding their own working rules. Such a case occurred during the King Amanulla’s visit in 1928, when, in order not to mar by any argument of unpleasantness the excellent effect which the visit was producing, permission was given for the delivery at the Afghan Legation of a quantity of rifles, supposedly ordered by the Xing, but suspected of being a private purchase by some of his suite. 12* There is no definition in Ihe Anglo-Afghsn Treaty of 1921 of what is meant by 'arms and munitions', now is Afghanistan a party to any international instrument containing such a definition. In general, the object of the measures set forth in this menorandum is to regulate the entry into Afghanistan of any arms and ammunition which might form the equipment of an organised force or of materiel for making such arms and ammunition. These include revolvers and any rifles wuioh, though professedly imported for sporting purposes, are of bores which approximate to those of service rifles and are capable of effective use in military or quasi-military operations. It is in this sense that the words 'arms and munitions' have been interpreted in the past and in practicepractice no difficulties have arisen, but it is scarcely possible to lay down a hard and fact definition ana each application must in the last resort be treated on its Merits. The treaty procedure has never been applied to sporting shot-guns and air rifles. 13. The working rules treat as a single operation what is technically two distinct operations'! (a) the issue of a license for the export of arms from this country and (b) the granting of permission for their transit across Indian territory. In dealing with the Afghan Government it is necessary that Eis Majesty’s Government and the Government of India act together, not only in fact but in appearance. Although, therefore the distinction between the two operations should be borne in mind, they should be regarded as mutually dependent. For His Majesty’s Government to issue an export licence when the Government of India might clearly have grounds for detaining the arms would be disingenuous; equally it is desirable that the Government of India should not, save for very grave reasons or in the circumstances foreseen in the working rules, detain arms for which His Majesty’s Government have once issued a licence (the detention of arms as a sanction under the Treaty is not of course being consiuered here). In the majority of cases i.e. those in which a formal notification has been made to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul, there is little likelihood of this happening, although subsequent information may at times render detention necessary. In ’diplomatic' 1 oases, the India Office will explain to the Government of India the circumstances in which the licence has been issued and will state whether or not His Majesty’s Government consider the case to be one in which transit should be allowed irrespective of a notification by the Afghan Government.NO. 1. xUi^Q^f^han Treaty of 1921 • Article 6 , With regard to arms and munitions, the British Government agrees that as long as it is assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importation in Afghanistan, permission shall be given without let or hindrance for such importation. If, hov/ever, the Arms Traffic Convention is hereafter ratified by the Great Powers of the world and comes into force, the right of importation of arms and munitions by the Afghan Government shall be subject to the proviso that the Afghan Government shall first have signed the Arms Traffic Convention, and that such importa tion shall only be made in accordance with the provisions of that Convention, Jhould the Arms Traffic Convention not be ratified or lapse, the Government of Afghanistan, subject to the foregoing assurance, oan from time to time import into its own territory the arms and munitions mentioned above through the ports of the British Isles and British India.

It would only he in the event of the Government of .Afghanistan showing plainly by its attitude that it had determined on an unfriendly and provocative course of policy towards Great Britain contrary to the neighbourly treaty above mentioned that the latter State would exerciwe the right of stoppage.

(Usual ending). Dated, 29th Aqrab A.H.1300KPPMDIX HO. 2 (’The word f *rms rf as used hereunder means all arms, ammunition and material capable of use for military purposes, - of. paragraph 12 of the covering memorandum - and the word 'agent' means arms dealer or agent'). a. 1; Applications will be dealt with as follows:- (l) By the Af g han Minister in London to export arms to the Afghan Government . The Foreign Office will ask the Minister to arrange that his Government shall make a formal notification to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul in accordance with letter II attached to the Anglo-itfghan Treaty of 1921. If and when the notification is made, His Majesty’s Minister will report the fact (if necessary by telegraph) and if he offers no comment it will be assumed that he has no doubts as to its bona fides and has cleared up any uncertain points. The Foreign Office will then ask the Board of Trade (Imports and Exports Licensing Section) to send the necessary licence to the Afghan Minister or his agent, His Majesty’s Minister at . Kabul and the Government of India being informed when thi has been done. (The ccmpletion of the usual 'Application for export licence' form by the ^fghan Minister, or his agent, will in all oases be a necessary preliminary to the actual issue of the licence). (ii ) bjl -■■■■&gt;- dealers, to export arms to the Af ghan Government . These will usually be addressed to the Board of Trade (Imports and Exports licensing Section). The Foreign Office will, special oonsiderationaapart, advise that a reply be made in the sense of that to be made to the Afghan Minister in (i), but omitting the reference to letter II; the procedure of (i) will then follow. This will apply whether the agent has received(vi) received his instructions from the Afghan Minister in London or not, the onus of arranging a notification resting, so far as His Majesty's Government are concerned, on the agent, irrespective of who it was that instructed him. (iii) As in (i) and (ii), the Afghan Minister tor arms dealer), adding that the necessary notification has already been made at labul . The Foreign Office will address a telegraphic inquiry to His IdaJesty's Minister at Kabul and, if the answer is satisfactory, will ask the Board of Trade to issue a licence, His Majesty's Minister and the Government of India being informed when this has been done. (iv) By the Afghan Minister (or arms dealer), to export arms to the King of Afghanistan personally. The Foreign Office will instruct His Majesty’s Minister to male© private inquiries of the King or the Afghan Government and, if the answer is satisfactory, will ask the Board of Trade to issue a licence. His Majesty’s Minister ana the Government of India being informed when this has been done. (v) the Afghan Minister (or arms dealer) to export arms to private persons in Afghanistan (or to the Afghan Consuls at Karachi or Bombay without specifying that the arms are for the Afghan Government ). The reply will be as in (i) or (ii) but the Foreign Office will also telegraph to His Majesty’s 1 inister at Kabul in order that he may, in the event of a notification being made, obtain from the Afghan Government an assurance either that the arms are for their own use or, if not, that they will take responsibility for their proper disposal.(vi) By the l In i wster for arms to b e deliverea the Afghan Legation . If the arms are in small quantities say over two or three, the Foreign Office will take their stand upon the provisions of the Firearms Act 1921 and the restrictions enforced by the Police, If the arms are in small quantities and if the Minister persists that they are for his personal use th e Foreign Office will ask the Home Office to allow any facilities which may be necessary. At the same time the Foreign Office will explain to the Minister that if it is proposed to export the arms to Afghanistan at a future date, a licence to be issued after the usual notifications at Kabul will be required. The Inuia Office will inform the Government of India of the quantities of arms delivered in this manner, and, when rifles are concerned, of the manufacturer’s numbers. (vii) By arms dealers to deliver arms at the Jfghan Legation . The Department to which the application is made will inform the Foreign Office who will take the question up direct with the Afghan Minister on the lines of (vi). (viii) B y the Af ghan Minister for arms to be taken by himself or a member of t he Legation to Afghanistan . Ifthe arms are in very small quantities the Foreign Office will ask the Board of Trade to issue a licence but will explain to the Minister, unless they consider that special considerations render it injudicious to do so, that this licence is issued as a matter of personal convenience to himself or the official concerned and that the arms are liable to detention in India unless the Afghan Government have in the meantime notified His Majesty’s minister at Kabul that it approves of the proposed importation. His Majesty’s Minister, who will be warned by telegraph, will upon receiving such a notification communicate direct with the Governmeiit of India. The India Office will also inform the Government of India of the circumstances in which the licencehas been Issued and of the view of His Majesty’s Government as to the desirability of allowing the arms to pass freely through Indian territory; they will also inform the Government of India of the route and date of arrival of the official taking the arms and will furnish the usual particulars of the arms, including, when rifles are concerned, the manufacturers numbers.

If this is Afghanistan, the procedure in (i) will be followed. If the reply is that they are required for use at the post in question (e.g.Paris) the Minister will then be asked to arrangethat the Government concerned (e.g. the French Government) shall si nify their approval to His sty’s Hepresentative. If they do so, the Foreign Office will ask the Board of Trade to issue a licence, but it will be explained to the Minister that if at any time the arms are sent or taken to Afghanistan across Indian territory, they will be .Mile to detention unless a previous notification has been made by the Afghan Government to His Majesty’s Minister at Kabul. In some oases the question may be affected by special considerations (e.g. in the oase of applications for export to Germany by the Treaty of Versailles or the German War Material Law). The India Office will inform the Government of India of the circumstances in which the licence has been granted and will furnish the usual information respeotin the arms. (It is eviuent that in suoh oases His Majesty’s Government run the risk of the arms being sent to Afghanistan overland, but the routes across Soviet territory at any rate are understood to be expensive and arms sent by them liable to theft and loss).

It may not always be possible, however, to iisLst on this. Hor will it be possible to insist that the Afghan Governinent shall furnish the name of the vessel conveying the arms and other particulars of vshipment, for such details cannot ordinarily be arranged until the agent is certain that export will be allowed and are in any case ^ableto sudden alteration. Information on these points will therefore ordi arily be furnished by the Afghan Mini ter or the agent, when the arms are exported from this country, or by the Afghan iiinister inn the country concerned, through His Majesty*s Representative, when the arms are acquired abroad. information indicated in the preceding section and the enforcement of the precautions indicated in paragraph 7 of the memorandum export licences will, so far as to possible, be sent, not/the Afghan Minister, even when hfe arms dealer or shipping agent acting on his behalf.
