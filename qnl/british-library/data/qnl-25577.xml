Por some time the,arrival of the new Governor is not likely to come off. It is reported that the enemy is collecting and has been seen moving towards Ckaghadhak. Owing to casualties the garrison has been greatly reduced and there are more than 80 sick. The guns which were promised have not arrived and there is no news of them. To run the telephone and search light I have got more men from H. M. S. “Juno” than she can spare and she has supplied landing parties in addition. As I do not consider garrison adequate during the present unsettled state, will the Army Commander kindly consider whether he can spare another regiment or at least 4 companies.” No more troops can he spared by me for Bushire. Hitherto the present garrison has been sufficient. Please hasten the despatch of the seven-pounder guns which were promised some time ago. Eeference my telegram of the 21st instant, No. 317—164-0.

Your telegram No. 984S., dated September 23rd. Captain Dy(er?). Marling has telegraphed under date September 26th that a claim has been put forward and pressed but Persian Government refuse to recognize respons ibility. In the circumstances I would still suggest this case at all events (in amour propre ? ) should be deducted from Bushire receipt whether Persian Government recognize liability or not, the claim for (a ? ) 10,700 pounds being left for a later settlement. 160 Telegram P., No. 372 F., dated the 30th September (received 1st October) 1915. From—His Britannic Majesty's Minister, Tehran, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, Simla. Shiraz ex-Governor has at last left for Tehran. I think it would be politic to allow Persian flag to be replaced at Bushire now, as more irritation has been caused by its removal than by occupation. German agitation particularly at Shiraz would lose some of its sting if it were to be re-hoisted. This was not to be done until arrival of new acting Governor for Bushire, but candidates of Kawam have so far refused or are so unsatisfactory that they have not been approved by Persian Government. Persian Government would much appreciate a spontaneous concession of this kind and it would make things easier for them here. I should be glad if you would authorise flying of flag as it would not materially affect our position at Bushire.

He has, as was mentioned in my last note, already cut the British telegraph lines running through his territory. This individual has a fixed deposit with us for Krs. 150,000 and the Civil Administrator has attached this sum and has instructed us not to pay it over without his sanction. wiartial law was declared here on the 25th instant.

It is to be hoped that the British Government will reverse their decision that only defensive operations should be undertaken; a gross breach of neutrality is caused by the fact that a German should be actively operating against us on Persian soil, this is surely a sufficient reason for an advance into fangistani territory and that requisite punishment be meted out to hostile tribes. .L&amp;ifiX. News just received states that the 3arya Begi has arrived at Borasjoon; he came from •jxiiraz and is, 1 understand, an emissary of the Persian Government appointed to settle up matters here between ourselves and the Tangistanis. In this connection I know nothing further at the time of writing. The 3krya Begi's name is doubtless known to you as a previous Governor of Bushire,. in which capacity xie acted for many years.

Heverting to ray laet note, although the situation has in no way improved, the Tanglstanis have had a very severe lesson. Two small raiding parties C5 ' n6 ln ° n the second and third instant but were dealt vlth by the outposts; in the latter attach the enemy was accompanied by one of their leading Chiefs, Hals Ali ° f Dllwar * wil ° *°r years been a thorn in our Bide; he was shot in the head and died shortly after- wards. In revenge for this the Tangistanis made a general attack on our positions at dawn on the 9th instant; their numbers were reckoned to be about 600 rnon. The General coamanding our troops personally directed the operations from the commencement of the action which was in every way a complete success. In the first instance the tribesmen occupied a deep nullah from which they were expelled by rifle fire and afterwards by the bayonet. . a squadron of cavalry scattered them driving them in the direction of the machine guns, of which latter there were eight; finally the enemy retreated across the Mashilah (a belt of marshy ground connecting Bushire Island with Gae mainland) where our heavy guns played havoc amongst them with shrapnel. The British losses were 35 killed and 40 wounded - the former Includes three officers, two of whom belonged to the Cavalry. in audition to the two Indian Regiments engaged we had a small force of Ghurkas and Bluejackets.

Ihe British Authorities are not permitting any goods to leave Bushlre for the North; the advisability of this policy is open to doubt and can only reflect itself on British trade and Institutions. As the goods belong to l-'ersian merchants, they would certainly be allowed to go through without hindrance by the petty Chiefs en route and presumably the Gendarmerie could assist, although the latter as a force nowadays can hardly be taken seriously. 1 A lot of goods mostly tea are being sent by the Anwaz route to Isfahan but owing to news just received of the situation there, this should cease forthwith. The hope that the JJarya Begi (vide last report) would make some settlement seems to be futile - in fact the latest intelligence points in the direction of his intriguing with the tribes. Unless the Persian Cabinet or we ourselves take some drastic steps, this deplorabledeplorable state of affairs is likely to continue indefinitely. It appears probable that we shall not be able to occupy our houses, which are two miles from the to.'n, during the coming winter and Europeans are looking out for houses in Town.

I fully appreciate fact that military considerations must be paramount in considering question of punitive expedi tions on Gulf littoral but^I venture to again invite attention to fact that over 70 Germans and Austrians have left Ispahan for South and that their inten tion is undoubtedly to stir up trouble in these parts. If we content ourselves merely with such measures as increasing our garrison at Bushire or shelling villages from sea, we leave whole of the inland tracks open for operations of our enemies who will probably proceed to orga nise powerful combination against us at their leisure. Rapid punitive expedition undertaken at this moment against some of tion of their towers and villages together with subsidising of doubtful o: friendly Khans should result in checkmating of German plans and would have very serious disturbances and combinations against us.

I have had a consultation with Officer Commanding Troops and Senior Naval Officer, and we have decided to attack Dilwar and occupy Bushire simultaneously on Tuesday, August 10th, at daylight. Our reasons for this postponement till then are because H. M.

No. % 3:fl10 that there is an alleged agreement between Bahhtian and Kushgai winch amounts to a plot for the overthrow of Government finances and fin* Persia to he partitioned between Kashgai and Bakhtian who are to be armed from German sources. Idea of such a combination in normal times would be amusing but in actual circumstances it must not be forgotten that moral elfect on Bakhtiari and Soulet and Kawam, respectively, likely to be increased by f ^ presence of large numbers of well equipped Germans in open defiance of Persian Government, of Eussians and of ourselves at Ispahan and Shiraz, must be serious and with inducements offered to them for the time tribea may sink their differences and such a combination even if only of a temporary nature, under German guidance, might well give .enemy the chance they are waiting for. At present Bakhtiaris are at loggerheads with each other over various duties and I propose to paralyse tribe as a whole by keeping them so, but it is quite within the bounds of possibility that influences of Germans at Ispahan, where most Khans are collected, may help to prevent their differences from coming to a head. It seems to me in any case that more than this is required of us. As far as its local effect goes, our occupation of Bushire seems to be falling flat and unless something (?) is done by us in way of a punitive expedb tion against those Khans who are responsible for the Bushire outrage, which will strike at the heart of Persian imagination and disillusion them as to sup posed impotence of His Majesty’s Government, I apprehend a very dangerous situation may arise in the Province of Pars and south-west of Persia generally. It is absolutely necessary at the same time that impression which will be produced by probable fall of Warsaw to German forces should be counteracted by appearance at Kazvin, at earliest possible moment, of promised Russian troops. Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik is using his efforts to form a Cabinet Council, but even were he to succeed in filling the various appointments, combination would be too much under democratic influence and too weak to be of any use (to us ?) in counteracting machipations of Germans.

This morning, I had a long conversation with the Governor with regard to his future. He states that he would greatly prefer to go to England (where ?) he has stayed for long periods and where he would he able to recover his health which has suffered from the Gulf. He would also, in England, be able to avoid meeting Persians which in India he would not he able to do, and, under present conditions, he has no desire to meet his countrymen. Should he, however, go to England, he would require the whole or a portion of his salary in order to be able to live. Here, the Governor draws, I understand, a monthly salary of 1,100 tomans and his brother 500. His brother is Karguzar and would accompany the Governor to England or India. I consider that it would be only fair to pay these officials the whole or portion of their salaries, so long as they might he considered, but for our occupation, to be holding their appointments, that is, until the two posts are filled in by other officials. Government will, it is possible, not agree to pay full salary to the Governor and his brother, but, if not, I would suggest that they might each receive half pay on analogy of our own leave rules: that is, Governor to receive 550 and Karguzar 250 tomans per mensem, or, in sterling, in round figures, Governor 1,200 and Karguzar 500 £ per annum. I would further suggest, should this recommendation meet with approval, that the Governor and his brother might, at an early date, be allowed to go to England. Addressed Tehran and repeated to Basrah,T h IP 3247j From Viceroy, 6th September 1915. (Repeated to Tehran and Basra as No. 912 S.) Foreign Secret. Persia. Reference Minister, Tehran’s telegrams 114, 314 F., and 316 F to Foreign Olhce. We most emphatically deprecate ultimatum proposed by Minister, which would simply be playing Germany’s game. In improbable event of Persian Government deciding to enter war on side of Great Britain she would, unless supported by considerable military force from Russia and ourselves, be powerless to stamp out German intrigues, which would continue to inflame populace and create state of anarchy if not actual revolution. Our Consuls and British community would be in greater danger than at present, while to secure this result British Government would certainly have to incur heavy financial obligations besides possibly other embarrassing guarantees. If, on the other hand, as is much more probable, Persian Government when forced to the issue decided to enter war against us, we should be confronted with lollowing difficulties : (1) Our Consuls and communities would be in more precarious position * than now. f (2) We should be compelled either to abandon Anglo-Persian Oil Com pany’s pipe line or to defend it at expense of operations in Mesopotamia. (3) Fnormous political capital would be made by I urkey and Germany out of entry into war of second Muslem state against us. Ihis would react inevitably on Afghanistan, where there is pre ponderating Shiah community, arid on Muslem opinion in India, particularlv Shiah. Amir’s position would be rendered difficult, if not untenable—and Muslem hostility, now evidenced in spoiadic attacks on North-West frontier, would consolidate in possibly formidable dimensions. These are weighty considerations to which sufficient consideration does not appear to have been paid. For these reasons we infinitely ])refer for the present polic\ of diiiting. Persian Government is probably too invertebrate to take definite line against us unless compelled—and certainly shows no inclination to do so. Much as we deplore precarious position of our Consulates, communities, and possibl} Legation, we consider risk involved in ultimatum at piesent moment is infinitely more serious. After all, success in Dardanelles will altei whole position, and we should tide over present situation in hope that this may occur soon rather than either precipitate rupture with 1 eisia oi secuie hei partnership at a cost of money 7 and embarrassing guarantees writhout compensating advantages of crushing German intrigues. It must not be forgotten that we have no troops to spare from eithei India or Mesopotamia, and that presentation of an ultimatum to Persia may result in intensifying Mohammedan hostility towards Allies, rendering the situation in India very critical and increasing our difficulties both on and outside oui frontieis. i.land should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with qnless required for official use.] Russian Minister’s conversation with Shah yesterday was unsatisfactoryr His Majesty' appears to he very much under enemy influencer Aft dr long and careful consideration Russian Min ister and- I think that attempt at Ispahan following no (sic ?on) other attacks on our Consuls reveals a state of things that necessitates strong action on the part of the Powers without delay. It is clear that object of enemy is by (group undecypherable)s of this kind to bring abouu a rupture of relations between Persia an! the two Powers so as to enable them to announce union of two Islamic peoples. Persian Government do nothing whatever to restrain ^e.- man proceedings or even to influence Persian opinion against them; on the contrary Government’p one idea is to some kind and substantial inducements also are trough u pressure applied by the occupation of another por PERSIA . POLITICAL . use Germans as a lever to squeeze us, unless pressu. e of to bear on them., would defeat it’s own object because, as in the case oiaugmented, say up to Id,000 men; there is no tine for this even if the men were available. Only course open to us would be to give Persia, choice of declaring herself for or against us. It would be (?akin to asking) her to break off relations with enemy Powers; distinction is too subtle for aver age Persian and step would be so signal as to leave no room for half measures or doubt. If Persia wishes to join us she must declare war on those Powers and in that case we would agree to moratorium from now until say three years after the end of the war. In the contrary case two Legations would at once leave the country hold ing Persian Ministers responsible for the safety of our Consuls and Colonies on their journey, of any of out nationals who may remain behind and of all British and Russian property r . Persian Government would have say 48 hours in which to decider There is, we believe, a chance that Persian Govern ment would accept these terms though they would very likely stipulate for military assistance, for a sum of money down, for a guarantee of territorial integrity at the end of the war and for eventual removal of all foreign_troojo.§^from peraia, or some or all of these points. It is for the allied Governments to decide whether their interests at stake make some arrangement such as that outlined above necessary or desirable but Russian Minister and I are agreed that unless some very drastic measure is taken or a decisive military success occurs to shake Persia's belief in German invincibleness we shall not be able to remain at Teheran very much longerT and it (’group omitted ?would) at least be leas damaging S5 to our prestige to depart by our own doing than to be driven outr French and Belgian Ministers are in accord with these views and iomer has/ telegraphed to his Govern ment that situation is becoming critical,, Russian Minister is sending a message to Petro.grad identical with foregoingr It Persian Government join us enemy missions will probably make for Ispahan and, if they succeed, grave disorder may ensue, though I do not think that it would .be of long duration provided that Persian Government had plenty of money to use amongst the tribesr There would be some danger for Consuls and Colonies at Shiraz and Ispahan and former would have to rely on Kawarn and latter on Bakhtiari - elsewhere, I think there would not be much danger,. In the event of the Persian Government (?declining) our proposals I presume policy laid down in Government of India’s telegram No. 483 of May 15th would hold good while, as regards our troops in Ea r t Persia, Governments of two Powers would decide whether operations should be continued ornate Addressed to Foreign Office; sent to India, Petro- grad and Basrah.fThis Document is the Property of Hts Britannic Majesty's Govern ment, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when done with nnless required for official use,] Cypn er telegr nr a 't o I /Ir • Mar 1 i ng (Tcheraji)..

As regards troops he said that they must be withdrawn to appease public opinion. At about t.hs point I received news of attempt on Consul General -'-t Ispahan which 1 at one communicated to His Excellency and pointed out that public opinion he wishes to placate was that which (? agreed) about/ these occurrences. It VMS opinionopinion aroused and paid for by German gold and I could not consent to his making any concession to it. British troops must remain until all danger was passed. Lis Excellency said he would send gendarmes to which I replied that he was setting wolves to .guard sheep and suggestion would not he entertained. I considered his Excellency's objections especially in view of attack on Consul General as tantamount to a refusal to give us satisfaction and as an indication that Persian Government had no intention of carrying out policy of neutrality so often proclaimed and ± regretted to be obliged to telegraph to you to this effect. I warned His Excellency that attempt at Ispahan was fourth of series of attempts on Consuls of the two powers for which no adequate satisfaction had been given. It revealed a serious situation and Persian Government had now to choose whether or no they were going to allow Germans to achieve their object of making our position here impossible. If His Excellency decided now not oo give us very moderate satisfaction we required we should draw our own conclusions viz that Persian Goveriirnent contemplated without serious misgiving possibility oi relations being broken off between Persia and her two neighbours.

Khan of Borasjun has now started stopping all caravans and has cut all wires between here and Borasjun after announcing his intention of doing so. He is supported by Khan of Daliki and Sheikh Hussein who have taken ■opportunity of similar action. This seems rather to forestall our intended action in regard to not allowing caravans to go into country. These petty Khans are entirely out of hand and are suffering from (swelled head) and until they are severely punished we shall have no peace in South. Borasjun is the cleverest and most rascally of them. Unless gendarmerie send escorts with telegraph repair men, it does not appear desirable to send them out, as the wires have been purposely cut out of spite to us. In any case, Khans having announced their intention of cutting the wires before they did it, would probably cut them again at once when mended. Unless the gendarmerie can punish these rascals winch seems unlikely in view of fact that native officers of Corps are strongly in their favour,* it looks as if we should have to do it ourselves.

In consequence of outrage at Bushire measures contemplated already fall short in mv opinion of those which are required not merely to obtain satisfac tion from Persian Government but also for more essential purpose of counter acting enemy influences with her. Already 14 days have elapsed since outrage occurred and if we are to delay further to take any action, this delay on our part will be attributed to our inability to send few troops which are requisite for this purpose, and conviction will gain ground that we are no longer a Power to be counted with for the present and German influences therefore will be strengthened very much. The immediate despatch of Russian troops is therefore more required very urgently and is very necessary and if possible it should be in greater stiength than was recommended in my telegram No. 247.

It is obvious that their object is to create trouble in South. I venture to suggest, in view of these open hostile preparations, it i 9 advisable that we should take some steps in good time to preserve our interests in these parts. As regards inland of Pars only proposal I can make is as before, namely, dismissal of present Governor-General and his replacement ?) by Kawam and perhaps subsidizing of Soulet &amp;c. In any case I shall continue to do my best to maintain calm by such means as lie in my power. But I venture to think that time has come for strong action on littoral where hostile elements should be crushed or bribed and where employment of com paratively small force at this moment should render our position quite secure and checkmate German plans. Unless early action is taken, these new agents will probably succeed in creating serious troubles - with help of Khans on littoral. Strong action on our part would, in my opinion, have best possible effect inland where our patience is misunderstood.

Urgent, Please refer to Foreign and Political Department’s telegram 714 S., dated July 24th. We have already on two occasions assumed control over Busliire Customs. In the year 1898, the Imperial Bank of Persia for some months ran them successfully. In the year 1909, the Belgian staff did the same. Perhaps His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, could get Director-General Customs Administra tion, when occupation is a fait accompli to order Bushire staff to carry on under British supervision. In any case I expect some of present staff will be willing to remain if we give them a guarantee against reprisals. Failing to secure their services, I hope British firms or British subjects will come forward to carry on. In connection with Trevor’s position after occupation, Army Commander authorises me to say that he fully approves of Trevor acting as civil adminis trator. For work in connection with maintenance of order on island Officer Commanding Troops would associate with Trevor one or more military officers. Question now remains to be considered as to how Governor of Bushire is to he disposed of. For several years past he has been on the whole a satisfac tory and friendly element and deserves well at our hands. By same token heis in bad books of Central Government, Governor-General and disaffected Persian community. As be is hampered by family ties, he could not at this juncture proceed up the country either with complete comfort or safety. Trevor and I are of opinion that he and his brother as also family circle should be allowed or compelled to leave Bushire by first mail steamer which will leave for India, after our occupation; if he were allowed to remain on there he would be a centre of intrigue. On bis arrival in India, be should be treated with consideration which bis position requires and to which his friendly attitude to us in the past entitles him.

Your telegram, No. 23d, I have repeatedly expressed the opinion to Ilia Majesty’s Government and to Government of India that measures adopted in consequence of outrage at Bushire are inadequate not only from local point of view but also as affecting general political situation here. To judge from India telegrams it is clear that Government of India is most unwilling to spare troops from more important operations elsewhere and altliough I am quite as anxious as yourself that we should make a display of force such as will bring Persians generally to their senses, I do not feel justified in again urging such a course on His Majesty’s Government. Meanwhile Russia has agreed to increase her force at Kasvin and I hope this will give me the necessary leverage to get rid of your Governor-General.

In this letter he complains of pressure of w r ork, illness, &amp;c.,. and hopes that he will be able shortly to pay L. a long visit. He asks whether L. is in communication with his Government,-and if so, kindly to telegraph and earn his gratitude “ bien entendu ” by procuring some information about his family in Belgium. Says that previous night a lot of packages were unloaded and a good deal of grain was being sent to London. Says he will not be able to (dissipate ?) any more and asks lor L.’s pardon and concluding with remark “a thousand good things and let us hope that, as I have always said, I shall be local Customs Director at Danzig some day This is probably intended for a witticism. No subsequent correspondence has yet been found. It would seem as if B. wanted to keep on the right side of L., firstly, in order to get news regarding his family, and secondly, because he thought Germans in Belgium had come to stay.

(2) I propose that question as to what he would like to do should be put to Governor, it being suggested that he should either transfer lo Bunder Abbas or Lingaii and look after tnose places or proceed to India on leave.

You should hoist the British flag. 2. I think that as suggested Governor can be given his choice. 3. Consul can have no confidential cyphers being a Persian and unless you expect to get from Consulate records really valuable information I think that it would be better merely to have them sealed up. Seizure of records would probably provoke reprisals against our Consulates at Shiraz or Ispahan or elsewhere which might be avoided if Governor and also Turkish Consul were (?) or induced to despatch telegrams en clair to Ministry of the Interior and to Embassies, respectively, reporting what had occurred. 4. While leaving you entirely free hand it would be more correct vis-a* vis Government of Persia that for your actions as Consul-General I assumed the responsibility. Addressed to Sir P.

Now Cabinet has boon in office a week buu has done little or nothing partly owing to vacillation of prime Ministar. At Shiraz campaign carried on against us oy G-ermns with the assistance of Governor General has resulted within last few days in insults and threats being levied against British subjects, and their position one of considerable peril while volunteer lorces are being collected to renew attack on Bushire. Both prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs have given me most categorical assurances even before I -asked for them that Governor General who is directly responsible lor existing situation shall be recalled without is lav but Cabinet hesitates to act and Governor-Geueraa and his German friends redouble their activity. At Ispahan situation is not immediately dangerous but His Majesty's Consul reports that he and j~as Russian colleague propose warning mieir con.mni o Ji,..t it nay become so shortly so that preparation- - c u to remove women and children to Ah-waz. Mr. ^iiocoul has arrived at Ispahan and reports show that Bukhtian Khans have yielded to inducer,icnts offered to tjiem am can be depended on to protect us, one.v r v., j,had time to bring in their retainers. Khan in Teheran appears to be pqualry friendly to us. At Kermansah Germ/m Consul has openly threatened to prevent return of British and Russian Consuls to their posts and actually attacked them while at Kangavar awaiting Gendarmerie escort promised by Persian Government Two Consuls are now returning to Ramadan. About 30 miles from Kasvin force of Gendarmerie 41 have been badly cut up by tribe and near Burujfcrd 300 of them have been completely smashed by Lurs with loss of two guns. In fact general stale of the Country somewhat resembles that which used to exist a century ago. In Teheran itself situation is unstable. According to Chief of the Police enemy have enrolled at least 300 men while gendarmerie officers and men ate openly pro-German and part of police is untrustworthy. Cabinet quite recognizes that the enemy they nave to fight is Germany and they have no force at their disposal except cossack brigade and Bakhtiari whom I am endeavourin to bring. Government is aware of and approves coming of latter force and is even making pretence of finding funds to pay Sowars but it muon go very much ageinst ihe grain for prime Minismer to be relying on Cossacks with their Russian officers. Knowing their helplessness Cabinet is appealing to the XiVio legations for support but tney are conscious that by doing so they will alienate democrats who have already attacked them in press lor inclusion oi los^uk-ed- Dowleh and Sipahdar.Y/e have replied uo these advances that we have no desire to embarrass them but we cannot yet hope to persuade our Governments to give support promised to late Cabinet to a Cabinet formed by efforts of parry that brought about and prolonged recent crisis, but that Cabinet may hope for support when they have proved that they merit it. It appears to us to our interests to see present Cabinet retain office as long as possible and get out of it what we can. It is not likely to stand long and it is better for us that its fall should be y compassed by its late friends than by us. It is impossible to say whether Germans will risk a coup here or whether moral effect of Kasvin will deter them, but on the whole I think they feel that they are not strong enough yet end arrival of Bakhtiari in the meantime should alleviate situation.

I shall be glad if the Political Secretary will favour me with his views as to whether this extra garrison as well as the Consular guard and «ird Indian Infantry Regiment previously at shouM Bushire/now be chargeable, as regards ordinary cost, wholly to Indian revenues, similarly to the Expeditionary Forces, or whether a moiety of the whole cost of the reinforcements, being apparently due to unrest in Persia, should together with that of the former .garrison be debited to the Imperial Government. In the latter case perhaps the Political Secretary will make a representation on the subject to the Foreign Office in his department. As stated in the Minute below I was of opinion that the cost should be divided equally with the Imperial Government and I still regard the contrary opinion as being formed on a misapprehension oi the facts. Alternatively, if it be the fact that the garrison of Bushire has been incorporated in force 'D', I am strongly of opinion that, for political and military reasons* it should be detached from that force.

As however garrison is now included in Force “ B,” we presume that Indian revenues will have to bear ordinary cost of entire garrison which would have fallen on them but for war, namely ( 1 ) full ordinary cost under foreign service conditions in Persia of original garrison of 06 , rank and file ; half of total ordinary cost under foreign service conditions in Persia of 244 officers and men specially added in 1911 to 1913; (3) ordinary cost under peace conditions of rest of garrison.

Your presumption is correct.Persian and Oman Operations. 1. Telegram from Viceroy to Secretary of State, dated 27 th October 1915. In connection with European War we have sent additional troops to Muscat and to various parts of Persia not included within sphere of the operation of Force “ D.” Expenses of these troops have been hitherto met from Indian revenues, but our Comptroller-General doubts whether this arrange ment is permissible in view of provision of Section 22 of new Government of India Act. Having regard to view recently taken by you in connection with incidence of charges of regulars transferred to Home establishment, we think that incidence of cost of above-mentioned troops should be governed by Houses of Parliament Resolutions of 20th November last. Usual arrangement in case of Persia in recent years has been that entire expendi ture on Indian troops employed in connection with local disturbances, and apart from arms traffic operations has been shared in moieties between Imperial Government and Government of India (see your telegram dated 21st November 1912 regarding troops in Persia). It would seem, however, that this arrangement, which is in accordance with the Wei by Commission’s recommendations, and which would be more favourable to India than that now proposed by us, has been superseded for the period of war by resolution cited above. We should be glad to receive early instructions in the matter. 2 . India Office to Treasury. F. 5722/15. India Office, Sir, 20th January 1916.. I am directed by the Secretary of State for India in Council to forward, for the consideration of the Lords (Commissioners of the Treasury, * Dated 27th October M5. il CO f ? f . a telegram® from tlte Govern- ment ot India regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. With reference to the concluding portion of the telegram Mr. Chamberlain is inclined to think that it is impossible to forecast with accuracy at the present s^age whether a division of the charges on the basis of the Resolution of 26th November 1914| would or Cojry endobui.+ would not be less favourable to the revenues of India (and more favourable to Imperial revenues) than a division in accordance with the pre-war arrangements, under which India bore the full cost of the troops employed in Oman, and was normally liable for half of the cost of any troops employed in Persia otherwise than in the suppression of the arms traffic. The effect from this point of view of the alteration of system would depend on the realised proportion of “ordinary ’’ to “ extraordinary” expenditure, the latter increasing with the expensiveness of the operations in which the troops are engaged. The troops at Pushire (one battalion of infantry and details), for example, and those at Chahbar (about 100 strong), Jask (about 200 strong), and Muscat (about 760 strong), are, and are likely to remain immobile, so that the extraordinary expenditure on them will probably be small, whereas the troops in Seistan (about 600 infantry and 350 cavalry) are intended to be highly mobile. Mr. Chamberlain is of opinion, however, that a division of the charges in accordance with the Resolution of 26th November 1911, is appropriate in itself. This method of division has now been applied to the Indian troops operating in France, Egypt, Gallipoli, and East Africa; to the additional Indian regiment sent since the commencement of the war to lyaso.—23. X See File 2. (2) July issue. JJ9 2 Mauritius; and to the large body of regular British troops sent to Europe from India in exchange for Territorials, in a war extending to three continents which has called up the military resources of every part of the Empire, the presumption must be that any Indian troops engaged in operations beyond the external frontiers of India, or stationed in regions where such operations are in progress, come under the Resolution. Mr Chamberlain assumes, therefore, that the Lords ( omimssioners of the Ir.

I have laid before the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury your letter of the 20th January last (L. 5722/15) regarding the incidence of cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. I am to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copy of correspondence between this Department and the War Office on the subject; and 1 am to express the hope that Mr. Secretary Chamberlain will accede to the suggestion of the Army Council that the Government of India should bear the whole charges of these troops for the time being, until the question of the ultimate incidence of the expenditure can be dealt with. If, however, the Secretary of State feels unable to accept this proposal, My Lords are of opinion that, as an alternative, the same basis should be adopted for dealing with troops in Persia as has been suggested in the case of Aden by Treasury letDr of the 17th ultimo (507/16), the whole cost of troops in Oman remaining as a charge upon Indian Funds.

I ami directed by the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury to request you to invite the attention of the Army Council to a letter dated the 20th ultimo which they have received from the India Office and of which they understand a copy has been sent to your Department, respecting the incidence of the cost of troops from the Indian establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. My Lords would be glad to learn the views of the Army Council upon the proposal of the Secretary of State for India in Council, seeing that Army Funds will piesumablv bear any charge accepted by the Imperial Exchequer. * o ^ ^ M\ Lords would have thougnt that, the interest of India in Persia and Oman being substantial, it would have been reasonable that a larger pioportion of the extraordinary expenses should fall upon Indian revenues than ialls in the case ol Indian troops serving in Flanders or Gallipoli, e.g-, a pioposal that India should bear the ordinary charges of Indian troops in3 Persia plus lialf tho extraordinarv cliarges would have marked the special character of the Indian interest. Moreover, as India paid the whole cost of Indian troops in Oman before the war, it might be held that there is no reason why any less proportion should be paid after the war. The Council are aware that the extra cost of certain Indian troops which were sent to Persia early in 1907 was divided in equal moieties between Indian and Imperial Funds (vide correspondence ending with the letter from this Department of the 12th April 1908, 7096/08), but their Lordships’ predecessors agreed on a subsequent occasion to accept [is a charge upon Imperial Funds a moiety of the whole cost of Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 1911 and thereafter. My Lords assume that Army Funds are not already bearing charges in respect of operations in Persia which should be set against the Indian expenditure. I am, Ac., The Secretary, War Office.

I am commanded by the Army Council to acknowledge receipt of your letter, No. 1909 16 of the 19th ultimo, regarding the incidence of cost of the troops from the Indian Establishment employed in Oman and Persia during the war. The Council agree with Their Lordships that, having regard to the substantial interest of India in Persia and Oman, there is no reason why the Imperial Government should bear the same.share of the expenditure as in the case of the operations in France, and while the Council are unaware of the grounds on which the Treasury agreed to share equally between Imperial and Indian revenues the whole cost of the Indian troops employed in Southern Persia in 1911 and thereafter, they do not think that those grounds should necessardy determine the incidence of cost undei the total!} different circumstances now prevailing. The Council consider that the case is one which should be dealt with by the transfer of a round sum based on estimate only, as suggested in the case of Aden in War Office letter 0164/3340 A. (F. 1) of 6th January 1916, and approved in Treasury letter 507 of 17th February 1916. Holding this view, they consider that efforts should be made to dispense with detailed accounting between the Indian Government and the Mat Office at a time of pressure like the present; and, as the whole sum involved is not large in proportion to other military expenditure, they consider that the Government of India might reasonably be expected to bear the c\hole chaigcs of tin sc troops, currentlv, until such time as the question of the' ultimate nuidence of the expenditure can be dea Itwith.

If the Persian Government carry out these terms we should presumably withdraw from occupation of Bushire and restore Governor. For this purpose it is desirable that he should not be further off than India.

He quite appreciates the grave inmortance of the isrues in Europe but if Indian regiments are to be retained for service out of India for a prolonged period hethinlcs it is all the more essential that they should have the advantage of the services of experienced Indian Army Officers acquainted with their ways and languages. He therefore suggests the advisability of recalling for duty with their own regiments to the extent necessary such officers as may be now employed by the 7&lt; T ar Office in duties unconnected with Indian troops. He is strongly of opinion that from the na ture of the case Indian regiments have the first claim on these officers and that though they may be lent for a tins to serve some specific purpose or im mediate want, their continued absence from their pro per duties must be destructive of regimental efiici- ency, while the constant depletion of regimental ca dres in India for drafts to regiments on service must be highly detrimental to the training of the units in India which are now largely composed of recruits.

His Majesty’s Consul General at Ispahan has reported that he has reason to helieve that there .will shortly Pe some 300 Germans and Austrians (latter being prisoners of war escaped from Transcaspia) assembled in that town. They are camped a short distance outside the town and possessed of large quantities of rules and ammuni tion besides machine guns, bombs and a wireless telegraphy apparatus, and allow no one to approach their camp. They have also considerable number of Mutahid in their pay. Small parties of Germans are continually coming via Kerrnanshah and amongst them probably Oppcnhcim, Attitude of Bakhtiari at Ispahan is exceedingly dubious and I have proof that Sirdar Assad here is play ing a double game, and probably Samsan-es-Sultanet also, Germans have more than once interrupted Indo- European Department wires south of Ispahan and uerman Consul there has even written to Departments ofiicors threatening to do so. ActsActs of this kind and this considerable concentra tion at Ispahan obviously implies more than a mere attack on our Consulates, and popular rumour here asserts that German design urged by democrats is to carry off the Shah, and Government to Ispahan,. This is far-fetched, but it is not improbable that hostile Legations contem plate flight to Ispahan should Russian troops arrive at Kasvin and threaten the capital, Ideaftwas currently talked of three months ago. Prom this centre with communications open to Turkey via Kermanshah they would hope to throw all Persia into disorder, and paralyse the Persian Government’s action by destruction of telegraph lines, and tiUot uo a chapter of accidents to involve her in war with us.

Referring to the Bushire hinterland and the case of Haidar Khan, it was suggested that if Bunder Hig were seriously attacked we might offer to remove him and his family to an^ asylum in India or Basrah. Situated here as I am without permanent records, it is difficult for me to realise quite what informa tion the Foreign Department have regarding such a \ matter as the history of Haidar Khan and the details of the political position in the immediate neighbour hood of Bushire Island. I fear that in this case Haidar Khan's case may have not been fully understood from my telegrams. I therefore asked Chick who has always been of the greatestgreatest help In keeping up our influence round Bushire, to put me up a note ad hoc. This I now forward and T would add one fact which he has not mentioned, namely, the following Nearly all the Arad Pilots for the Entrance to the Shatt-al-Arab, taken from Bushire by every ship that comes up, are dependents of Haidar Khan - though living in Bushire. At the beginning of the war, there was a persistent attempt on the part of the ill- disposed Bushiris, to engineer a boycott of our ships by the pilots, and it was only the frank and fearless attitude of Haidar Khan in our favour that prevented what would have been a very serious difficulty, viz. / the absence of pilots for our numerous transports. Please, if you see no objection, submit the attach ed note and this letter for His Excellency's informa tion. Whatever may be the decision of the Government of India, on the longer view, as to what our line of conduct may be, he and you will I know appreciate, when you read these notes, my earnest wish both personal and official, that we may not have to leave this staunch and fearless adherent in the lurchvicarious- The fair copy of this will he signed xigaiEnax* iy, as I an just leaving for Gurnah vhence I hope you will have received satisfactory news before this reaches you* With best regards. Yours sincerely, Sd. P. 2. Cox* To The Hon'ble Mr. A* H. Grant, C.S*I., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department,Minute on our relations with Haidar Khan of Hayat Baud. Haidar Khan first came into close touch with the Residency in December 1907, when with his own hands at considerable personal risk he arrested two of the notorious Humaidi pirates, and handed over to the Stonier Naval Officer and Sir Percy Cox» It '.ill be seen from the telogra\.aHo .S-148 of March 7th 1908, and S-&amp;12 of April 10th 1908 that His Majesty’s Government expressed their appreciation of Haidar Khan's services in this connection, and he was so informed. He then stated that he has taken his action in order to ren- JL der us a service, and that he hopea tnat he could count on our good offices in case he should need them in the future. In 1909, after the revolution of Saiyid Murteza Ahrami ap Itj t ^he Persian Government and the seizure of Busnire by the Tangistani tribesmen, which rendered necessary the landing of a considerable naval force from II .M.S. M ?ox\ Haidar Khan rendered great service to all at Bushire by sending a force of 400 riflemen to guard the island for a month. At the end of 1909, and again in 1910 and 1911 Haidar Khan and his relatives and the districts under their ruj.e were visited by His Majesty's Vice-Consul* Lost cordial relations ensued; many small matters were settled with the Residency to mutual satisfaction; and constant and intiru te correspondence has been me.inta.ined frora then onwards * Ht idar Khan early made it clear th. t he despaired of the Persian Government being able to restore order in Southern Persia, and to support those few chiefs like 1 ,iiiabelx v so kept their districts in hand; and therefore, being the ruler of purely maritime districts himself, he looked wo the British Government authorities, as those most interest ed, to give him their support in ell his difficulties with thedS) CL sau the Central Government and Bekhtiari creed, and to tre him as they treated, the Shaikh of I.'uhammareh. On hie part he showed himself prepared to meet our wishes In every respect, and to consult us regarding all his actions. In 1910 end 1911 he did oil he could to give British merchants &amp; preference in the purchase of grain in his districts as against the Germans, end thie assistance! was very valuable. In 1913 and 1914 he invoked British assistance for the protection of his district of Lirawi against Bakhtieri rspacity: and both the Hevident and Mis Majesty's Legation recognising the importance of the issue gave him their utmost and effective help. In 1913 Haidar Khan again co-operated in the British operations against the Tangistan coast by allowing the island of Kharg, which is his fief, to be used for beaching captured Tangistani dhows, and by giving hospitality ■ nc. assistance to the British troops sent there. For this, by their No.2762-E.A. of December 16th 1913, he was informed of the appreciation of the Governme* of India. V On tiie outbreak of the European war in 1914 he hastened to express his hopes for British victory, in the face of general pro-German sentiment in Persi , and he has continu ed to promote the British cause, and circulate British news in his districts. He has in fact from the first been considered by Southern Persia as the strongest British partisan after Shaikh Sir Khazal Khan of Luhamareh. On March 4th 1515 Sir Percy Cox telegraphed from Basrah to Haidar Khan asking him to arrest Viassmuss and his German* companion; assuring him that'our appreciation vould be even greater than for the capture of the Humaidi pirates', that Haidar Khan need fear nothing from the Persian Government as a result, and accepting personal responsibility*!? for tie arrest. Haider Khan complied without the slightest neslta- tionhesitation and, though through no fault of his, Wassmuss subsequently escaped, important documents revealing German plans fell into our hands. Although universally blamed and violently abused outside his own districts for his action, and in consider able danger of attack from the pro-German Khans, Haidar Khan as can be seen from the translation of more than 30 letters which he has written to the Residency since, has only striven the harder to support British interests. He gives us sound advice, and has negotiated and is negotiat ing with neighbouring Khans, thus making a solid pro- British faction which we hope will keep the hostile Khans in check. When asked by Sir Percy Cox to send a force from Lirawi to the assistance of the Shaikh of Muhammareh*s representative in Southern Arabistan, he at once got a force ready,though it was then too late. Haidar Khan has in fact been a valuable ally for several years past, and now, realising that absolute Persian neutrality is impossible under the local condi tions, he has definitely thrown in his lot with us and is playing a most active and important part in steadying the situation in the Bushire hinterland in our support. There is no one in Southern Persia, apart from the Shaikh of Muhammareh and Haji Rais, to whom we snaxl neve more cause to be grateful at the end of the war, tnan to Haidar Khan* II* Haidar Khan of Hayat Daud is about 45 years of age, and has been head of his family for some 18 years. His pedi gree is given in letter No.1785 of August Utn 1912 from Sir Percy Cox to Foreign Department. Tne districts controlled by him are shown in the 'f- accompanying sketch map* They are Hayat Daud (chief village and port Bandar Pis). The Island of Kharag. RudhillehRudhilleh, under a brother. Lirawi, under a cousin and brother-in-law. Bandar Dilam, under a cousin. Angali, under a near connection by marriage. It will be seen that they extend from the southern borders of Arabistan to the outskirts of Bushire itself, a distance of some 30 miles, and cover all the ground between ' the (;oast range and the sea, with the exception of the Shahbankareh district,which is in alliance with Haidar Khan The districts represent therefore a solid block of the coast plain between Arabistan and Bushire,under one family control, and as a link with British interests in Arabistan their support of and from the British is visibly of great utility. Our interests in the Persian Coastal region, parti cularly in the northern part of the Gulf, lie in the maintenance of order by and security of tenure of the local magnates, who are well disposed towards His Majesty*s Government. In the event of war, or of the disintegration of Persia, it would oe the only logical sequence of the autonomy of Arabistan and British possession of Bushire to encourage the greatest territorial magnate of the intervening region, and our staunch friend, Haidar Khan, to keep the region under his influence in order and quiet, and as well disposed towards ourselves as possible. The position and value of Haidar Khan uay not be fully understood. He and his relatives from Liiavi to Rudhilleh and Angali could muster some 2500 armed men probably, and. with his friend of Shabankareh more tnan 3000 . There is little probability cn nis being so scattered and. driven in on Bandar Rig by the hostile Khans, who are numerically less strong and bound together with flimsy tiesties of friendship, that Haidar Khan would he forced to fly from his district. Long before Bandar Rig, which is a good many miles from the frontier of his districts, was attacked Haidar Khan's forces would he fighting hard against any invasion of their borders; and we hope with considerable success. He himself has never taken so desperate a view of the situation; and in point of fact his correspondence has been directed just as much as to how far he could help the British in Bushire, if attacked, as it has been to ask for co-operation if fighting took place on his borders in the immediate vicinity of Bushire, and for the moral effect of z a man of war cruising off his coast. The point is that his enemies locally are our enemies, and vice-versa: namely, the Khans on and to the south of the Shiraz road. Both the British authorities at Bushire and Haidar Khan are agreed that all hostility in the Bushire hinterland, and danger to Bushire could, be crushed easily and speedily by a British force marching to Ahmadi and Borasjun, and blowing down the towers of those hostile chiefs, while Haidar Khan's force co-operated by occupying the two districts subsequently and putting in Khans friendly to them. Finally it might be added that Haidar Khan is a very different type of man from the ordinary swash-buckling Persian chief, as can be seen from his letters; he has risen to his strong semi -independent position by shrewd diplomacy, and without fightin^while his districts have been a model for the law and o&amp;pv maintained. SdA H. Cr . Cnick. Bushire, 18 th May 1915.Confidential . Foreign and Political Department, Simla, the 24th June 1915. My dear Cox, I am desired to thank you for your demi-official letter of the 30th May, with which you forwarded Mr. Chick 1 s most interest ing note on our relations with Haidar Khan of Hayat Baud. These papers have been submitted, as desired, to His Excellency the Viceroy, who asks me to say that although the Government of India were not aware of the full extent of Haidar Khan f s services and of our obligations to him when their telegram of the 15th May was despatched to the Secretary of State, yet even had they been in full possession of the facts, this would not in any way have altered the policy which they advocated. As you will have SM gathered from our telegrams to the Secretary of I State on the subject of the Persian situation generally, it is the firm intention of the Government of India not to allow themselves to be drawn into military diversions of any kind in the Persian Gulf beyond what is recommended in our telegram of j the 29th May. While, therefore, fully appreciating the services of Haidar Khan as detailed in Mr. Chick T s note, the Government of India adhere to their opinion that whatever may happen it is undesirable for us to support him with troops. The most that could be done in the event of Bandar Rig being definitely threatened, would be to send a ship of war there, if one were I available. The issues at stake in these days are so large that we cannot afford to support individuals, however deserving, at the risk of jeopardising more important interests elsewhere. Yours sincerely, S4. A.

My dear Hirtzel, I am directed to enclose, for information, a' copy of an intercepted telegram No. 519, dated the 20th n &gt; To June 1915, from the Persian Foreign Minister, Tehran, to the Persian Minister in London, concerning the relations of Persia with the British and Russian Governments. Yours sincerely, Sir Arthur Kirtzel, K.C.3., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, London.Telegram From - The Foreign Minister, Tehran, To - 'The Persian Minister, London. Ho. 519, dated the 20th June 1915. Secret. Two weeks ago I sent you a telegram concerning the pourparlers with the Legations of the two great PoT/ers; you are fully acquainted with the facts and have, I feel sure, entered into the pourparlers with the Foreign Office and now again I repeat myself, that you may know my object, which is shortly this. First you are well aware that these last three or four years, since I entered into politics, I have introduced friendly relations with the British Legation so that I had every hope and assurance, that in this crisis the Legation would work harmoniously with me in the same manner, but I regret to say that, from what I now see, my hopes have not o«en fulfilled. I wish to make you properly acquainted with my chief object, that you may make a clear and deemed explanation to the British Foreign Office. If I persist in demanding the withdrawal of the troops, it is because it is my one aim to endeavour to change public opinion from its past attitude, that feelings of friendship may spring up between the Persian people and the two Powers, and I must impress on you that if the poncy Ox Germany and Turkey has progressed in Persia, it has been solely on account of the presence of Russian troops, not to mention the increase in their numbers. On the they (i.e. the Germans) shook public opinion in Kasvin by rousing suspicions and threw it into a panic and turned''tie situation to tkeir *. advontaeo, it must to .cknoudedged, if justice i&gt;. dene, that bo® the former and the present Governments, in spit, of th. alliance “f Islam and the commands of the religious leaders, did their best to stop these intrigues. But their action hao a purelypurely temporary effect and left public opinion unchanged and the CrOYemnent does not gain its desired end as it should. Today the whole aim of the present Government is to change this adverse opinion (?) by a good plan and to incline the mind of the public to friendship and a favourable attitude towards the Russian and British Governments. It is not necessary for me to say that with these latter harsh actions of the British the killing and destruction of lives will take place and will make the matter more complicated, will increase the trouble and make the hatred (of the public) greater than before, and will add to the means of success of the others (i.e. Germans etc.) Under these circumstances the best means for attaining our object is the withdrawal of the troops from Kazvin, Rasht, Mazandaran, Astrabad and Khorasan (?}: this would at once alter public opinion, strengthen the Govern ment and might p ossibly be the means of stopping certain measures (German intrigues?) and of turning public opinion gradually against the others. Today, although ohe Persian Government has decided to remain neutral, it nevertheless fully realises that it must strengthen more than ever the friendly relations existing since centuries witn svecxt Britain and Russia and that from tnese relations good results will accrue from these two Powers, intention will not materialise except by a change of public opinion and the creation of a sincere friendship, w — same as the putting an end to the excited state and iear of the people and preventing the spread of suspicions. But it is evident that this will not be effected merely by the withdrawal of the troops: it is highly necessary that the other requests made to the two Powers should oe complied with e.g. the settling of the moratorium and all the points mentioned in the note and similarly the import* tion of arms and the organisation of a j-Oice eoc. whicn mustmust j^ter come into being with the assistance of thetwo Powers. You must particularly dravv' the attention of the Foreign Office to this point, that if (Persia?) is agree able to the troops being withdrawn from Azarb^pjfan after the withdrawal from the other places mentioned, it is because the Government feels certain that owing to the consequences of the withdrawal of the troops from th^se last places, their request for the withdrawal of the troops i rorn Azaroaijan will also be fully complied with. The present Government attaches no importance whatever/ to the Turkish troops. You have doubtless heard of the steps taken by the Government and the people to stop these and they (the British?) knew well and I myself am certain that although some on the strength of the withdrawal of the troops from the places mentioned might be excited over the question of the alliance of Islam, they will be ready to oppose the Turks. Unfortunately the state of this country is such that this question of an army under arms has fallen into the hands of opposing factions: one party seeks for power and place, one its own personal advantage and a third 14 anxious for disorder. From this the two Powers draw advantage and for the same reason the power and authority of the Government is weakened and it cannot carry out its plans. For instance, for the sake of prospective advantage, some issue articles and publications every day and some spreaUu suspicions in the two Legations, saying w if the troops go there will be disorders and your lives will be in danger: the Germans and the Turks will obtain complete control'. They say this because they know that the present Government, as soon as the troops have gone and public opinion has changed, will acquire fresh authority and 'these other gentlemen' will not be so successful in certain quarters for when things begin to work smoothly, owing to complete harmony having been established between the two Powers and Persia, and the desired•desired results have been attained, they will certainly not he able to gain any advantage for themselves, the hand of o^cord and intrigue will be powerless and they will be left out in the cold by every one; it is for this reason that the Legations have been perturbed and suspicious and have not worked harmoniously with the Government. I can assure you that the withdrawal of the troops will be very fruitful of advantage to both parties and will have important results. Enter into pourparlers with complete confidence, draw the attention of the Foreign Office to these matters and show what is the best policy for the two Powers and Persia.

' CONFIDENTIAL. ro 763 [June 4.] Section 1 %• '• 9;; as [71884] Mr. Marling to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received June 4.) j? 0 ' ^ Tehran, May 5, 1915. ’ THE march of events has been so rapid since my arrival at Tehran that I have only been able to keep yon informed of the salient features, and I propose now to recount as briefly as may be the circumstances of the accession of Prince Am-ed-Dowleh fa, office. Precisely what reasons led Mushir-ed-Dowleh to resign is not of much moment but one determining cause was certainly consciousness on the part of his Hiahness and his devoted Majlis that the irresolution and pusillanimity m defence ot Persian neutrality might result in allowing Persia to drift into war. In two long convCTsations I had fith him on the 21st and 22nd I gathered that the national mistrust of Russia and the resultant sympathy with Germany, and but momentarily and the partially successful incitements to a union between the two Moslem nations to a Jihad had so worked on Musbir-ed-Dowleh’s timorous mind that he could not n the courane to make a stand against the numerous and palpable violations of Pereian neutrality^of which Germany and Turkey had been guilty, and he even admitted that he had not attempted, to controvert the ridiculous arguments by which M. Kardof and Assim Bey endeavoured to justify them. His Highness s own account as given to a member of the legation was that he felt compelled to resign as he did not recen e sufficient support from the British and Russian Legations and this Wy a ^w h °urs after a long conversation with me, the general purport of whuffi 7 *. “ ^ British rather than Russian assistance.

Copy to India 1 ^^JUL1915^ 23 JUL1915 1 Iprovided that the Kussian Legation agreed to arrange a personal matter, an und taking which was at once given, while Farman. Farma whom I saw myself if ^ enthusiastic, seemed to fie chiefly concerned as to the capacity in which he should ^ his services. Indeed’, so general was the acquiescence that by the evening a Saad^I Dowleh Cabinet seemed already to exist on paper. Accordingly, next day I raised no objections to our adopting Saad-ed-Dow] V whose personal capacity for vigorous action cannot be doubted. He himself was alw^’ full of confidence, though he did not minimise the difficulties to be faced. He said t/! the stoppage of silver payments by the Imperial Bank of Persia must be expected to cause intense excitement, and pointed out that the only force that could be relied ° was the police. Our own enquiries showed that this is probably correct* the gendarmerie is of very doubtful loyalty, being commanded by Swedish officers ol avowed German sympathies ; and is for that very reason on bad terms with the Cossack brigade, while the brigade, reduced to some 400 men in Tehran, is unpoDuia and is asserted to be of little military value unless supported by Russian troops and Saad-ed-Dowleh told us plainly that unless he could count oa the Kasvin garrison the situation would be difficult to control. It was probable that they need Hever enter Tehran ; - the news that they had started would have the necessary effect, but it was essential that we should be in a position to call them up if necessary. Ain-ed-Dowleh also hinted at impending trouble, and Colonel Merrill represented the situation as far more dangerous than did Saad-ed-Dowleh. It is always difficult to tell what will produce a sense of panic in a Persian town, but it is certain that at this moment and for some days Tehran was the prey of the most fantastic terrors. The Armenians were arming to massacre the Moslems, the Turks were already in Kermanshah and ready to advance on the capital, Russia was building forts at Enzeli and 30,000 Russian troops were on their way to Tehran, the Cossack brigade was going to attack the gendarmerie, &amp;c., and so real was the alarm that on Thursday night Colonel Prozukwitch telephoned to M. de Bach saying that he heard the Russian Legation was to be attacked and inviting him to spend the night at the quarters of the brigade, while the same night some half-a-dozen German subjects knocked the American Minister up at a late hour and remained in his house till morning. With the nerves of Tehran m yp s condition it was clear that any excitement, such as the announcement of the position of the Imperial Bank of Persia, might have resulted in serious disorders and that it behoved us to take every measure to ensure the maintenance of tranquillity, and we therefore telegraphed to our respective Governments urging that in case of need the ussian troops at Kasvin might be authorised to move to Tehran, and that reinforce ments might be held in readiness. . The following morning Moin-el-Vizareh called on me and I told him that, as for ’\aiious reasons we had come to the conclusion that'Saad-ed-Dowleh was the most fitted +1 1 c&lt; f ) P e w lfl 1 the situation, M. de Bach and I intended to recommend him to ie , a 1 as l^ 16 new Premier. Moin-el-Vizareh said that Saad’s unpopularity made sa Y &lt;in ail ^ n goment impossible, and declared that we could never carry it out, and as an mur an a half later I received a telephone message from him at Farahabad to say at . ie . ^ ia o desired to receive us the following day instead of at four o’clock as pre\ lous y airanged, it is safe to conclude that he had gone to the palace to work a^ains aa -e -Dowleh s appointment.

In return the Shah ^promised to induce Ain-ed-Powleh to take office. The latter, however, though he 'advised a deputation of the members of the Medjliss not to oppose Saad-ed-Dowleh, still declined to join the Cabinet, while Samsam-es-Sultaneh, whose presence was desirable to secure Bakhtiari support, also hung back. Had time been available, I j think we could have had our way, but with the pressing necessity of regulating the bank question, and the imminent arrival of the German Minister and his train of agitators ready to take advantage of any disorders, there was no time to be lost. The j nervousness in the town, moreover, was worse than ever, and Saad-ed-Dowleh himself admitted that it would scarcely be possible for him to assume office without the support of Russian bayonets, and although M. deBach had received information from Petrograd which showed we could count on the Kasvin force, the news from Tiflis implied that reinforcements could hardly be expected. There could be no question of course of using material force or even an unmistakable threat of it to instal Saad-ed-Dowleh. It was tj^o risky with the bare 900 men available at Kasvin to support it; if successful, we should have had a Cabinet, it is true, headed by the most resolute Persian statesman, but otherwise composed of very doubtful elements; and finally it would have been consonant with the views either of London or Petrograd. We therefore agreed that, if we could not induce the Shah to give his honest support to Saad-ed-Dowleh, we would agree to the nomination of Ain-ed-Dowleh. To the outside world, however, we gave no sign of yielding, and when on Monday morning (the 26th of April) M. de Bach and I started for Farahabad, no one knew what action we were going to take. The Shah who had not been warned of our visit received us alone and without delay. I reminded the Shah of his promise to nominate Saad-ed-Dowleh, and that we had every right to expect that His Majesty would give him the Royal support; this, however, had not been the case ; His Majesty had prevented Farman Farma from entering the Cabinet and his promise to induce Ain-ed-Dowleh to join had not been fulfilled; in fact what His Majesty had given with one hand had been taken away with the other. Saad-ed-Dowleh had not been treated fairly and we still considered that his talents made him the most suitable man for the post of premier in the present difficulties of the Government. We could only hope that His Majesty would him proper support and fulfil/ his promise to us in the spirit as well as m tie letter. As for Ain-ed-Dowdeh whom His Majesty preferred, what confidence cou c we, and what was still more important, could our Governments have in a man w io a just gone back on his word to us? I need not trouble you with the Shah s rep )’ 3U I may mention that he showed not merely readiness in retort and talent or eva mg . difficult points, but also a surprisingly just appreciation of the genera si ua ion, an ^ also, Mr. Churchill tells me, a considerable power of expression. o ma e a ong story short we made the “ graceful concession ” and before we reache m-e ow e is house on our way home his Highness had received his summons to t le a ’ ^ 5 o’clock he was back in Tehran with the firman of appointment as presi en Council of Ministers in his pocket. „ , QT ._- j Prince Reuss with his staff of agitators and cohvoy of arms an mo y about the same time. „ ,. fnr nflfW Saad-ed-Dowleh out of the way^ all difficulties m fin ing can i 0 J 4 - ec j vanished. Farman Farma, the Shah’s personal objections to w 0I J\ 0 f accepted the Ministry of the Interior and Ain-ed-Dowleh, now t a e J his Government ivas merely a question so far as Persians were concern bank’s personal interests,proceeded to take in hand the vitally urgen ques re quest to affairs A draft J &amp;11, which Mr. Maclean had very ^ndly prepared^ provide for the temporary suspension of silver payments y m mittee of the to the president oftheMedj'liss and by h™ deputies and others, who gave it the shape m which it &lt;. three months alteration being that the period of the Bill’s operatKm was reduced from to sixty days. Motemin-ul-Mulk, however, intimated to guarantee, that of of getting the Bill tbrongh the Medjliss unless I could g&gt; ve 80 8 ab;lity to the legation or preferably of His Matty’s Government^ adm iLd, lesume silver payments; the guarantee of the Persia r t i le case , and with quite worthless in the eyes of the deputies. In if ui } .j o, y 0U as to the- the assurance of Mr. Wood that his board m London would satisfy y ^ ^ [2428 d—1] [measures that would be taken to ensure the resumption of silver payment I took on myself to give the desired guarantee in the form of a letter to Ain-ed-Dowleh the only Minister actually holding office. . , , , ,, wj.,, For once Motemin-ul-Mulk showed real determination, and rushed the Bill through at a single short sitting, and the law appeared in the papers the next morning (29th ^ April- ^By some oversight, however, no copy was sent to the .&gt;ank and Mr. Wood, * acting on 'the advice of the Government Commissioner appointed to supervise the working of the bank under the new law, continued to meet small demands for silver, but refused those for considerable sums. I regret to .say that one of the latter was presented by the British firm of Zeigler, without any cause that could justify such want of consideration for BritiaE' interests. The bank’s notes were, however, already being looked at askance, and the mischief was further increased by a rumour spread abroad that the amount to be guaranteed under the terms of my letter by the Persian Govern- . ment included not merely the advances made to it by the bank in current account, now amounting to something over 200,0001, but also the Persian loan of 1,250,000Z. floated by the bank in London in 1911. To remove this misinterpretation I addressed at his request a second letter to Ain _ ed-Dowleh, the substance of which was published the following day. Copies of this letter, of my earlier letter, of the bank law, and of Mr. Wood’s letter above referred to, are enclosed. It was, of course, to be expected that the revelation of the bank situation would cause some flutter in the Bazaars, but I confess that I had hoped, with some confidence, that even the Democrats would have shown some zeal to further the success of a measure for which they had themselves voted in the Medjliss. But they did nothing of the kind, and with every petty native banker and money changer—and also some of the bigger men—keen to depreciate the notes with the certainty of its complete recovery within a couple of months, the bank's paper currency was for some days at a considerable discount. Energetic pressure on the Government, however, resulted in the adoption of strong measures against these gentlemen, and by the 5th instant notes were accepted fairly freely at a discount of 5 per cent., as compared with 15 per cent, two days earlier, a result due also in part to the sympathetic, if tardily adopted, attitude ot the Russian Bank. So far it must be conceded that Ain-ed-DowdelTs Government has acted well up to its professions to co-operate with us, but in the matter of maintaining Persian neutrality against German and Turkish violations it has proved itself less, far less satisfactory. After a much advertised arrival, which, however, in spite of the imposing escort of gendarmerie arranged for him by* Major de Mare. w*ho has accompanied him all the w*ay from Constantinople, was not the occasion of the demonstrations he expected. Prince Reuss for a few* day*s showed few* signs of activity, but it is abundantly clear that he has not been idle. Our telegraphic reports have informed me that he was accompanied by a numerous staff, and bringing an enormous amount of baggage, for the safety of which he took extraordinary precautions, and which has always been represented as containing arms and ammunition. The last few stages of the journey would appear to have been performed too hastily* for him to carry the more weighty part of his impedimenta with him, for yesterday I received news that animals said to be carrying cash and ammunition were to arrive under the escort of German and Turkish officers in Tehran in the course of the dav. They were safely delivered, the Germans in charge of them having successfully refused, thanks to the good services of the gendarmerie escort arranged for them by Major de Mare, to pay the road tolls of the Persian Transport Company at Kum or Tehran. With money, arms, and a competent band of agents—Turkish and German—at his disposal, the German Minister has had very 7 little difficulty in creating a very strong position for himself at Tehran. The inbred distrust of Russia also was all in his favour and has been worked upon to the fullest extent, and it is not surprising that, with a Medjliss only momentarily favourable to the present government as a “pis aller” from the Saad-ed-Dowleh cabinet, Prince Reuss has been able to create an atmosphere unfavourable to Ain-ed- Dowleh, whose accession to power is represented as the work of the two legations, that his Highness and his colleagues are showing unmistakable signs that though they well know the danger to which they are allowing the country to drift, they cannot find heart for the moment to take any steps m opposition to German activity and intrigue.

Reference to Minister at Tehran’s letter to Foreign Office, ^o. 247, dated 14th duly. We agree with Marling that time lor strong action has arrived. We entirely support proposal for increase of Russian garrison m North, but we do not agree with Marling that seizure of Mohammera, Lingah, Bunder Abbas and Hormuz is desirable. To occupy Mohammera forcibly would be to estrange a valuable friend who has deserved well of us and possibly again to excite tribes astride the pipe-line. To occupy Bunder Abbas. Lingah and Hormuz, which presents no difficulty in taking, would be to dissipate our strength and to expose small garrison to tribal attack such as has recently occurred at Buslnre ; nor would such action be very effective. We consider that the most suitable action would be at once to assume administration of Bushire, take over control of customs house, hold revenue and disallow despatch of merchandise inland. This should be done without intimation to Persian Government, who should be left to question our action themselves. We should in this way give proof of seriousness of our intentions and at the same time place onus of discussion on Persian Government. When questioned our Minister might inform Persian Government that the action taken at Bushire is due to conviction unwillingly forced upon His Majesty’s Government that the Persnn Government are no longer able to maintain order in Bushire and its neighbourhood, of which fresh confirmation is found in the regrettable attack made by 300 tribesmen, in which two British officers were killed and several sepoys killed and wounded. Further, that it is clear to His Majesty’s Government from the fact that the Persian Government are permitting various armed parties of Austrians and Germans to recruit Persian sowars, and to leave Ispahan and Kerman with supplies of arms and ammunition, that the Persian Government are either unwilling or unable to prevent Southern Persia being made a base of hostile operations against England and her Allies. His Majesty’s Government cannot tolerate a situation of this kind, and are reluctantly compelled to take such measures as she may consider necessary for the protection of her own interests. But if the Persian Government are n &gt;w prepared to deal seriously and effectively with matters constantly brought to their notice, he is prepared to state terms of the British Government, but not otherwise. These terms should be that within a week Persian Government must: (1) Take definite steps to punish Khans concerned in Bushire outrage; (2) pay compensation at the rate of 5 000L for each British officer killed in the outrage, 5001. for each sepoy killed and 100L for each sepoy wounded ; (3) take definite action in regart to Germans now in Persia by having them dls 5 me ;i^ or handed over to us for deportation ; (4) recall piesent Go\e Persian Government fail to comply with terms within time specified dictate. .

For their pro tection we have to rely on Persian Government and that Government has to be convinced that two Governments are in earnest and ready, if necessary to force it to end German activities. I d(p not believe Persia desires to Vecpme embroiled m war with two Powers, but it is undeniable that recent retirement of Russia in Poland and Galicia, slow progress oi Allies at the Dardanelles and Flanders and small apparent result of entrance of Italy into the war have given Germans great prestige, and have made idea, of a rupture of relations on the part of Persia wilth us less unthinkable than before and if at present juncture we fail to snow strength possibility of Persia being dragged into war is brought nearer. In view of these circumstances and Government of India’s manifestation of uneasiness I would urge that despatch of Russian troops is urgent necessity. Meanwhile we ourselves should occupy Bushire at once. As for actual demands we should make on Persia we 'omulate them better when we know in what position , i- -i i . ^ j - • .7 _ I ' -0 • _ can we are to enforce them but if they include any specific measures against German emissaries i submit that to that extent they should be made jointly.

In these circumstances I reconrnend that, provided two governments have requisite forces at their disposal, I be autnorised to present our demands and to add that failing acceptance we shall take our own measures. Our demands might be: 1. Written official apology for the outrage. 2. Dismissal of Governor of Shiraz, and nomination of a successor approved by us-. 3. Punishment of tribes concerned and deposition and outlawing of their chiefs. 4. Selection by us of Gendarmerie officers in Kerman, Bushire and Pars. 5. Arrest and expulsion of Jassmuss, disarmament and recall of all unrecognized German agents and emissaries and their followers throughout Persia. 6. Internment of escaped Austrian prisoners of war. 7. Indemnity of £20,000 for murder of officers. Acceptance of Nos. 5 and 6 will, of course, entirely depend on immediate reinforcement of Russian troops as suggested in my telegram above mentioned. Demand No. 2 will probably be complied with and oi others, which are intended to cover desiderata put forward by Lieutenant Colonel Sir P.
