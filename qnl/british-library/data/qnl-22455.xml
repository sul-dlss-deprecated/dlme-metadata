My reasons for asking are that I should then be near my Regiment at Dehra Dun, and also I know the Commissioner in Ambala* I believe Guerltz is training in Ambala but, as I am staying on here till October, hie time would very nearly be up, and perhaps it might be possible for me to be posted thei^e also. I notice I was not included in the Quarterly list of January, 1938. I presume that when the next list is published I shall rank as the next in seniority to Allah Dad Khan because, although I did not Join in Bahrain till the 6th February, my date of first appointment was the same as that of Neale, Allah Dad Khan, Magor and Hall* It was no fault of mine that I was not allowed to join before February as in the first place I was told thart I could not leave until the Waziristan operations were over . (i.e* December 1937), and then I wasted a considerable time trying to get a visa for Iran, as you probably remember, and which eventually I did not use at all. A Yo urs s in c e: -e ly, 4 d.

Sir, • I have thje^ honour to invite a reference to your letter No.1504-1/3 dated the 28th September 1938 regarding transfer of charge of Captain J.B. Howes from the post of the Political Agent, Bahrain to the post of Assistant Political Agent, Bahrain, and to state that 3.R. 293 does 1 not contemplate the grant of joining time in the case of transfer of charges not involving the change of an office. In the circumstances the joining time for one day viz. 27th September 1938 taKen by the officer is not admissible as the transfer is only from one post to another in the same office. It is suggested that sanction for the grant of leave on average pay for one day may kindly be obtained.

Supplementary Rule 293 makes no reservation in regard to changing or not changing offices nor has any instruction by the Government of India to this effect been received. On the other hand the Kule refers to a change of residence, and Captain J.B. Ho jes certainly had to change his residence, though within the sane station. It seems evident that the underlying object of the Rule is to enable a govemm nt servant to move his belongings from the house attached to one post to the house attached to the f other.

Sir, I have the honour to rewind you that in TTovember of last year I ^as sent on special duty to the Arabian hinterland with a geological exploration r&gt;arty of Petroleum Conceaelons Limited. Aa you know, for vsrioue reasons the expedition ended after only six weeks 1 duration; but at the time when I received my orders to accora any the party, it seemed probable that I might be away froni 1 Bahrain for four to five months. I -jrlsh also to remind you that ray orders to accompany the party were received telegraphically from the Honourable the Political Hesldnnt only about e fortnight before the expedition aae due to set out. 2. In theae circmastances, I had to make arrange ments to leave my family behind me for a considerable period of time at very short notice; and decided that it was beat for me to send thera to Australia, where ay wife has relaxdons, until I should return to Bahrain. 3* As soon as I had made this decision, I wrote to the Controller of military Accounts and Pensiona f Lahore, asking him to send me the necessary forma to enable me to have the cost of the passage put down to the Lea Comlasion/Comaission Passage Account m&amp;intalnad by him in favour of my wife. The forma did not, however, reach me until several v *eeke later, by which time I \ma in Qaraimi oasis, »nd my wife on the high seas (as 1 had not been able further to delay making arrangements for her. The Controller of Military Accounts and Pensions has since informed me tbat the delay was caused by his writing, in error, to n^y regimental address instead o.' to TBahrain* 4. Tae Controller of Military Accounts and Pensions has now raised an objection to my drawing on ray wife's Lee Conauission account for the passage in question, as my application to him was not received \mtil after my family had left Tfchrain. He infoms me that in such casesi the sanction of the Government of India is ret uired. 5, The circuiastances set out in my first three paragraphs sufficiently explain, I think, the reasons for which I am now obliged to ask that this sanction be accorded; &amp;nd it is, 1 am sure, nobody's intention that I should suffer financially by having been sent xpc on special duty. I recuest, therefore, that you may forward copies of this letter to the Honourable the Political Resident, requesting him to recommend to the Government of India that sanction be adcorded, and the Controller of Military Accounts end Pensions informed accordingly* I have the honour to be, 'Jir, Your nost obedient servant, (!) ~ P 1 - Assistant Political /^gent, Bahrain.Prom v Captain J-B.

Political Agency, Bahrain, l^th April 1943. As you know, 6 tyres and tubes have arrived here for you. The question of payment for them has been com plicated by the fact that the original five tyres and tubes ordered from Naraindes, Karachi, were overcarried to Bushire, where they were kept. Arrangements were made for five more tyres and tubes, in their place, to be sent from Kuwait. But whereas Naraindas 1 bill is for Rs 393/12/- the cost of the Kuwait tyres and tubes amounts to Rs 456/6/- all told, as follows :- (a) Cost of 5 tyres (@ Rs 76 each) and 5 tubes ((® Rs 10 each), as intimated by the Political Agent, Kuwait Rs (b) Bill from the Political Agent, Kuwait, for packing, cooly hire etc Rs (c) Gray Mackenzie*! 1 bill for freight charges etc^ Rs Total Rs Mr. Wakefield spoke to Colonel Prior when he was here about the payment of these bills and Colonel Prior agreed that the difference between N^raindas 1 bill and the cost of the Kuwait tyres would be paid by Bushire. I am accordingly settling the three bills detailed in the last paragraph and debiting R^ 456/6/0 to Bushire. As regards Naraindas 1 bill. Hallows in paragraph 3 of his demi-official letter No.^1334-13/219, dated the 14th November 1942, said that arrangements for its payment were being made from Bushire so I have not paid it from here. (We received a reminder from the firm dated the 21st January 1943, but have had none since). Your cheque dated 23rfl May 194PJ for Rs 393/12/0 which you left here to pay Naraindas on receipt of the tyres is returned herewith. ^ Yours sincerely, _ ^ ^ ^P 1 * N.
