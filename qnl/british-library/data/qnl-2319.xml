U. agents.2 (b) Soviet Affairs. 5. Soviet Consulate General. —Batman- ofE the late Soviet Consul General left Meshed for Moscow on the 26th Decem ber. It was originally intended, so M. Skaloff said, that he should be accom panied by the Vice-Consul only as far as Askhabad, but it has since been ascertained that the latter has also gone to Moscow. M.

Karim Khan Baluch (referred to in my Summary No. 35, paragraph 8 “ i ”) is now in Herat tvith S of his followers. They are said to be under surveillance of the Herat authorities. Ill— Central Astatic Republics. 7. The information given below has been obtained from a recent arrival from Kerki which he left on the 25th Decem ber 1930. (i) G. P. U. Frontier Guard troops stationed in Kerki area belong to the 46th G. P. U. “ Otryad ” The following details are reported regarding their dispositions :— (а) Their total strength is estimated at 30‘J men of whom about 50 are located in Kerki itself while the remainder are dis tributed in 8 forward posts “ towards the Andkhui fron tier (б) Among these are : Busaka (on the Oxus), Daulatabad (not on map) Tashkuduk, Zaid and Karrakum. The G. P. U. Troops in this sector (roughly 45 miles) are under Kerki (presumably the Staff of a “ Komendatura ” is located there). (c) Previous to the spring of 1930 there were only 4 posts in this Sector, but as a result of the increasing tendency among Turkomans residing in this area to migrate into [ Afghanistan the authorities both doubled the number of their posts and increased the garrison strength of each. (d) The Headquarters of the 46th G. P. U. Frontier Guard ' Otryad ” are at Charjui. Note The details given above in paragraphs (a) and (6) should be accepted with reserve. (ii) “ Kolhozy ”.—The native popula tion around Kerki continues to remain hostile towards “ collectivisation ” and is refusing to join the “ Kolhozy ”. Except for a small area which is being cultivated by a “ Sovhoz ” (State Farm) the lands between Kerki and the Afghan frontier are lying waste. Some 30 Turkoman farmers residing in this area have been arrested and are now in prison. (hi) Migrcttion of Turkomans into Afganistan. —Owing to the determination on the part of the Turkomans not to submit to collectivisation ”, their migration from the Kerki district into Afghanistan has been extremely heavy during 1930. It is generally believed in Kerki that between May and the end of December of the past year, about 12,000 Turkoman families have left the Kerki and Kelif districts and crossed | over into Afghanistan where they have settled around Andkhui. Note :—Reference paragraph (ii) and (iii) above please see my Summary No. 29 (paragraph 8&gt; dated 16th August 1930. (iv) Turkoman raids in the Kerki area. —The informant states that it was reported in Kerki that several raids had “ recently ” (presumably just previous to his departure) been made by the above mentioned Turkomans from Afghanistan into Soviet territory. The object of these raids appears to be primarily to drive cattle from Soviet territory into Afghan istan. These Turkoman raiders claim that they are the lawful owners of this cattle. (v) Soviet Propaganda in Afghanistan^ \ —The G. P. U. Department in Kerki are despatching a large number of their agents and agitators to the districts of Andkhui and Maimana, with the object, it is believed, of raising the frontier tribes against the present Kabul Govern ment, which is generally regarded with considerable disfavour in official Soviet circles. 8 . The information given below which is dated the 20th December 1930, hasbeen received from a special source in Tajikistan. (i) Bushambe — (а) An Enquiry Commisson has re cently arrived in Dushambe from Moscow, as a result of which several members of the Central Executive Committee of Tajikistan have been arrested. (б) Maksumoff, the President of the Central Committee of Tajikis tan has left for Moscow. (ii) Termez — Activities of the G. P. U. in Afghan istan .—The G. P. U. Depart ment is at present paying particular attention to Afghanistan. Several Afghan notables both from Northern and Southern Afghanistan who are hostile to Nadir Shah are now in Termez. It is re ported that they are receiving large sums of money and every possible assistance from the G. P. U. Department.

(ii) The new prison in Meshed has now been completed. All the prisoners that were confined in the old Nazmieh building have been removed to the new prison. (iii) It is reported that the Meshed police authorities have posted special plain clothes detect ives to watch the Soviet Con sulate and the offices of the Soviet “ Sharq ” Company. It is stated that this step has been taken by the police so as to enable the latter to keep an eye on those Persians who make a habit of frequenting these two Soviet institutions. Note .—If this report ia correct, it would seem quite conceivable that the detective, who ia alleged to have been posted to “ watch ” the Soviet “ Sharq ” Company, is in actual fact “ watching ” the British Consulate-General, since the “ Sharq ” Company’s offices are located in a building adjoining the British Consulate compound.

Nil 3, Prohibition of the entry of Russian refugees into Persia. —The Governor General has stated that he has received order from Tehran to prohibit the entry of Russian refugees into Persian territory and that 111 future all refugees from the U. S. S. R. who should attempt to enter Persia without pioperly visaed passports are to be arrested by the Amnieh (Road Guards) or the police and escorted back to Soviet territory. These instructions have been communicated to the military and Amnieh authorities along the Perso- Soviet border. Note .—Similar instructions were issued by the Teheran authorities in the autumn of 1929, but nevertheless between 200—250 Russian refugees were allowed to enter Meshed during 1930. 4. Settlement in Persian territory of Turkoman ref ugees from Turkmenistan .— From reports received during the past nine months regarding the migration of 1 Turkomans from Soviet into Persian! territory, particularly North of Bujnurd j in the Goklan district, it was at one time believed that this migration was being made on a c msiderable scale. Accord ing to the information which has now been received from Divisional Head quarters in Meshed, it is found that the actual number of Turkomans who es caped from Turkmenistan and definitely settled in Persia since the 21st March 1930 (i.e., during 1308—the current Persian year) falls far short of previousestimates. The official figures given are :— {a) 30 families of Yamut Turkomans now settled North of Buj- nurd. (b) 20 families of Tekki Turkomans, 15 of which are now settled near Intfabad, and the other five families near Persian Sarakhsv (6) Soviet Affairs. 5.

Soviet i( Intelligence ” Office attach ed to the “ Khlopkom ” Department. — (i) It is alleged that under the cloak of the “ Khlopkom ” Department, the Bolshe viks have opened a new “ Intelligence ” branch in Meshed which works directly under Moscow. It is also reported that among the duties of this office is to watch and to report to Mo cow on the activities of the Soviet employees in their Consul ate and in the “ Sharq ” Company. (ii) Among the agents employed by the “ Intelligence Office —which must be regarded as an unofficial branch of the G. P. U.— are said to be : (а) Mir Mehdi, brother of Mir Murtaza, Proprietor of the “ Toos ” Printing Press in Meshed—a notorious pro- Bolshevik ; and (б) Syed Ahmed Hamadani, who until May 1930 had been working on behalf of the Bolsheviks in Kuchan when he was arrested and impri soned by the late G. O. C. He was released at the time of the visit of the Shah and has since com^ to Meshed. (hi) It is alleged that this “Intelli gence ” Office is endeavouring to obtain the services of persons, who can speak Urdu with the object of despatching them to India via Herat. (iv) The individual reported to be in charge of the above mentioned “ Intelli gence ” Office is Shatkovski, whose official appointment in the “ Khlopkom ” Department is that of Assistant Account ant. 7. Asatoroffi the Soviet Consul in Seistan, has arrived in Meshed. It is not known whether he will be returning to his former post. II. —Herat. 8.

Jam, the Governor General is dis pleased at the arrival in Meshed of a Turkish Consul and he is alleged to have stated that he feared that the latter would indulge in intrigues with the Kurds of the Kuchan district and en courage the Caucasian Turks, many of whom reside in Meshed, to interest themselves unduly in local political affairs.

The latter during the past four or five years had acted as a building contractor to certain departments in * .47 1133!i 2 K.hora;an, namely those of the Customs and the Military. Agabekoff aUeged that during 1928 and 1929 while Samoil- off was at Duzdap, where he was super intending the building of a new Customs House, he also acted as a secret agent of the 0. 0. P. U. and that he had sub mitted, through Agabekoff, a report on the Karachi-Quetta-Duzdap railway. It should be mentioned that Samoil- off accompanied by M. Graux, the Belgian Director of Customs at Duzdap, visited both Quetta and Karachi in 1929 when he was apparently given a special permit to do so by H. B. M.’s Vice- Consul at Duzdap. Samoiloff who is now in Meshed, emphatically denies ever having had any connection With the O. G. P. U. In local Russian emigre circles he is nevertheless regarded with considerable suspicion, though M. Graux believes him to be quite innocent. 4. Junkers Air Service—Owing to the fall in the Kran exchange this Company has raised the fares between M* shed and Teheran which from the 1st March will be Tomans 80 per passenger. It is understood that the • faros have been similarly increased on all other aii loutes of this Company in Persia. 5. Commercial.-— Please refer to para graph ^of my Summary No. 4. During the past month the all absorbing topic in the local bazaar has been centred around the present extremely precarious economic situation. All normal business has come to a standstill, even the carpet trade, and the only commercial activity shown in the b tzaar appears to be con fined to the illegal purchase and sale of foreign currency. Pounds sterling have been sold at Tomans 14 and Rupees have been bought at prices ranging from ! Tomans 85—100 per Rs. 100. Ihc 1 German controlled National Bank re- I fuses to sell Pound Seeding at the official rate, namely at Tomans 9 per Pound. In the me* n ime the leading merchants in Meshed have protested to Teheran against the imposition of a new scale of customs duty—namely an increase of 80 per cent, on merchandise, chiefly sugar, which arrived at the Dazdap Customs before the introduction of this new Customs Law. Their protests have of course gone unheeded, with the result that the majority of merchants have refused to take delivery of their goods and have tried to re-export them to India. It is reliably reported by a recent arrival from Duzdap that M. Graux the Director of Customs has staled that his Customs House is crowded out with merchandise but that he is unable to remit a single Kran to Teheran. Such was ihe general situation when suddenly on the 26th February Jacmain, the Director of Customs it^ Meshed, received telegraphic instructions from Teheran to the effect that all goods received from that date in the Customs Offices should be detained till further | orders. It was then reported that the Persian Government had passed a new Law monopolising both the import and export trades with Foreign countries. The Governor General has confirmed this report and stated that this move was primarily directed against the Soviet Government whose external trade mono poly law had resulted in heavy losses to Persian merchants. He added that the local Soviet Trading concerns had ap parently received previous intimation of the impending introduction by the Persian Government of this Monopoly Liw and only a few days previously had paid Tomans 115,000 to the Meshed Customs in order to release their goods and to redespatch them to the U. S. S. R. Merchandise of Soviet origin which was on sale in a local shop known as the “ Mosel Prom ”, which sells Soviet goods on commission, has been sealed up by the local authorities. The Governor General is stated to have expressed an opinion that as a result of this new Foreign Trade Monopoly Law the Soviet commercial agencies would gradually close their branches throughout Persia 6. Refugees from the U. S. S. R. —T1 e Officer Commanding the troops at Sarakhs has reported to Divisional Head quarters at Meshed that two Russians had crossed the frontier and had “ escaped ” in the direction of Meshed. It is reported that at the present moment there are still seven Russian refugees in the local Nazmieh, three of these had entered Persi i from Afghanis tan. Their cases are under investigation by the Adlieh Department. (b) Soviet Affairs. 7. The Shark Company .—It has been reported that this Soviet Company in tended openirg two new shops in the Khayaban-i-Pahlevi with the object of underselling the other shopkeepers. It was also reported that this same Com pany had made plans to open a branch in the Meshed bazaar on the 1st March. Note .—It is doubtful if these plans will now be realised.

This individual who arrived in Meshed from the Caucasus on the 7th October 1930 and who has since been to Teheran and Kuchan returned to Meshed in the 24th February. It is reported that he will endeavour to obtain a visa to proceed on a pilgrimage to Mecca via India. he latter is believed to be his real destination- (c) Turkish Affairs. 10.

Commercial. —Please refer to para graph 5 of my Summary No. 5. Following the passing by the Persian Government of the new foreign trade monopoly law, the leading merchants of Khorasan, at theinstigation of Asadi, the Mutawali Bashi, have formed a Trading Syndicate, the capital of which is said to be Ts. 500,000. It would appear that this action on the part of the Khorasan merchants has been approved of in the highest quarters in Teheran, since it is reliably reported that Taimur Tash, the Minister of Court, has sent a congratulatory telegram to the Meshed merchants express ing his satisfaction with the formation of this Syndicate. 5. Yunis Wahabzadeh { formerly Wahaboff), who is one of the 4 Mejliss members for Meshed, has surrendred his parliamentary pay of Ts. 300 a month for the next 2 years and has arranged that it should be paid to the Governor General of Khorasan to be used by the latter for local charities.

It has now been ascertained that this alleged Bolshevik agent will not be going to India and that he is returning to Baku. He left Meshed for Nishapur and Sabzawar on the 9th March. 10. Perso-Soviet Frontier. —Sultan BA l 1 K KHAN, the frontier commissioner at Mohamedabad, who had recently been on a visit to Meshed has complained to Sarhang Iraj Khan Matbui against a series of “ excesses ,y w T hich were now being committed in the frontier zone and within Persian territory by Soviet subjects. Iraj Khan had already lodged several protests to the Soviet authorities, but states that nowadays he cannot obtain from the Soviet officials even acknowledgments to his pro tests. He recently informed the Militar^k Attache that he (Sarhang Iraj Khan) har^ been compelled to report personally to H. I. M. the Shah to the effect that the Soviet authorities in the frontier zone were now conducting themselves in a manner contrary to all recognised international customs. 11. Arrests of Persian Subjects in Soviet territory. —It is reported from Darahgaz that three Persian traders who went to Artyk on the 3rd March to take delivery of 10 wagon loads of rice were arrested by the Soviet authorities on the pretext that the rouble notes in their possession had been brought by them from Persia. The impor tation of Soviet currency notes into the U. S. S. R. is of course prohibited by the Soviet Government. These three Persians are now in Kaakha undergoing interrogation of the O. G. P. U. Department. Note 1.—The above report has been confirmed by Sarhang Iraj Khan, who stated that these men were un doubtedly guilty, but that the Persian authorities were nevertheless endeavouring to secure their early release. Note 2.—Soviet “ Chervonetz ” Notes, which the Soviet customs authorities exchange at their frontiers for g)reign currency at par, are now freely sold in Meshed at 10 per cent, of their official valuation. 12. Possibility of early relief of Soviet officials in Meshed. —It is reported that the authorities in Moscow intend shortly to recall all the heads of Soviet commercial agencies in Meshed and to appoint in their places younger men taken from “ Komso mol organisations. It is also rumoured that the present Soviet Consul General and the whole of his staff may also be recalled to Moscow. In this same connection it is reported that the heads of the Meshed branches of the “ Shark ” and the Bureau Perse Companies have persuaded certain influential Persian merchants to submit a request to Moscow in which it has been pointed out that the present moment was inopportune to recall the present commercial officials in Meshed, particularly so when all trade with abroad had been monopolised by the Persian Government. II.— Herat. 13. Military — (i) Kandak Mashar Khuda Baksh, O. C. 2nd Kandak of the 1st Ghund has been posted to Karra Tappe on the Soviet border. {ii) Reliefs have recently taken place at the various military posts on the frontiers. These frontier posts-are now held by all 3 Kandaks of the 1st Ghund consisting of Tajiks of Logar, Kohistan and Hazara- jat. The present dispositions of this Ghund are as follows :— One Kandak (300 men) at Islam Kala. One Kandak (300 men) in the vici nity of Kushk. One Kandak (300 men) at Murghab. (in) Gemral Nur Ahmed Khan .—It is reported from Maimana that this Officer has been sent to Kabul by order of the War Minister. (iv) Farm,an from Kabul. —It is re' ported that on the 7th February the Naib Salar assembled the Herat garrison at Shahr-i-Nau to acquaint the troops with a farman recently received by him from Kabul. It is stated that in this farman Nadir Shah, after express ing his satisfaction with the loyalty of the Herat troops, nevertheless advised them in the future to apply more zeal to their military duties. 14. Hazara Settlers from, Soviet territory .— About 400 Berberis (Hazaras) accompanied by their families have arrived in Herat from the area of Kushk in Soviet territory. They have stated to the Herat authorities that they were permitted by the Soviet Govern ment to migrate from Soviet territory and that shortly about 2.000 Berberis would be emigrating from the area of Kushk into Herat. The Naib Salar has been ap proached by these same Berberis with a request that a grant of land and also em ployment should be given them, but the Naib Salar is reported to have informed them that they should send their representatives to Kabul and to apply there. Xote.-—I t is not improbable that these Hazaras, unlike' the anti-Soviet Turkoman emigres, having been carefully propagated with Soviet sentiments are now emigrating to Herat province at the express wish of the Soviet autho- rities. • 15. The y/nces of foodyrainS have risen considerably in the Maimana district and even in Herat. This is due, it is said, to the influx of Turkoman refugees from Soviet territory. If). War Minister's Tour .— (i) Information has reached Herat from Mazar-i-Sharif that the \far Minister will this year perform the “ flag hoisting ” ceremony in Mazar-i-Sharif on Nauroz day and that he will leave Mazar-i-Sharif for Maimana and Herat on the 4th day of Nauroz (26th March). Kote.— There is a custom in Mazar-i-Sharif whereby on the first day of every new' year (t'.e., Nauroz day) the Shrine flag is taken out and hoisted on the Shrine. This flag which is known as the “ Bairagh-i-Hazrat Sakhi ” flies over the Shrine for 40 days after which it is lowered and put away in a special box. (ii) About 40 men (Wardaks and Wazirs) who accompanied the W ar Minister from Kabul have arrived in Herat. They are regarded with considerable suspicion by the Naib Salar and their movements in Herat are being carefully watched. III.— Central Asiatic Republics. Nil L.

Military. —(a) Conscription .— (i) This was commenced in the Sabza- war district in February 1931 and is reported to have yielded 1,000 conscripts of whom 750 have al ready been sent to Tehran and the remainder will shortly follow them to the capital. It is stated that these Sabzawari conscripts will serve in the Artillery. (ii) Another batch of about 450 men conscripted in Nishapur are short ly due to arrive in Meshed for ser vice in the local garrison. (in) The Officer Commanding the Buj- nurd Composite Kegiment reports that 150 men have been conscripted in the Bujnurd district and that they will be sent to Meshed on the Z5th April.

It is however still possible that the Persian Government may yet provide the necessary inducement to this Company to continue this service. 4. Refugees from the I T . S. S. R. Six liussian refugees including one woman, who recently entered Persian territory near Lutfabad and who were returned to Soviet territory by the Amnieh Department have since re-entered Persia through Kalat-i- Nadiri. The Persian authorities, after in stituting enquiries about these refugees have permitted three men and the women of this party to proceed to Meshed under an Amnieh escort. (B) Soviet Affairs. 5. Soviet Commercial activities. — (i) ft is reported that a number of Meshed mer chants who had entered into business transactions with the Soviet Shark C om- pany in Meshed before the introduction of the Trade Monopoly Law now find them selves considerably embarrassed owing to the partial non-delivery of goods sold to them by this Soviet Trading Company. These Persian merchants are reported to have petitioned the Governor General and also complained to Tehran against the business methods of this Soviet agency. (ii) The local Persian authorities are becoming apprehensive of the considerable number of Soviet subjects who have recent ly been arriving in Meshed in the guise of employees of the Shark Company. They suspect that a large proportion of these men are in reality agents of the O. G. P. U. Department. (Hi) The Bureau-Perse—a Soviet Trans port Company—has circulated a nctice to the effect that from the 22nd March. 1931 the Soviet Mercantile Fleet will maintain a regular service of freight and passenger steamers plying between the Black Sea Ports, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf. The ports of call by these Soviet steamers in the Persian Gulf will be Bushire, Bandar-i- Abbad and Basra. Tickets for this Soviet steamship Company can be obtained in Meshed. 6. Alleged Soviet propaganda activities in Persia .—It is reported that certain pam phlets printed in Persian and addressed to the Communists of Persia have recently been discovered in Tehran. It is stated that the Persian Government after institut ing enquiries has come to the con clusion that the pamphlets were printed in the U. S. S. R. The Persian Ministry of Education has sent a circular telegram to the heads of the provincial Education De partments instructing the latter to take steps to suppress all similar pamphlets propagating communism and ridiculing religion of the country. 7. Doctor Dumree alias Fridunee .— (Please see No. 18 in “ Black List for warded to the General Staff under my No. 580, dated 3rd January 1931). It is reported that this individual who had been acting as Shahinian’s local representative during the latter’s absence in America had mis appropriated Tomans 7,200 Shahianian is said to have succeeded in recov ering Tomans 2,000 of this sum. Dumre. has now left Meshed and is reported to be making for Kerman where he hopes to find employment as a doctor in the Parsec hospital in that town. II.— Herat. 8. Ahdur Rahim, and the Kabul Govern ment. — (i) It is reported that the Naib Salar regards the coming visit of Mahmud Shah, the War Minister, to Herat with con siderable misapprehension and is very alarmed as to his future. He is now fre quently away from Herat on the pretext of shooting trips. While away on these shooting trips he is said to be endeavouring to win over to his side the inhabitants of the Ghurian and Islam Kala districts. (ii) It is reported that Abdur Rahim had recently paid a visit to Karim Khan Baluch, who with his followers has now settled at Shabash, with the object of enlisting the support of the latter in the event of trouble with the War Minister. (Hi) It is reported that Firqa Mashar Mohammed Ghaus Khan, who was formerly G. O. C. in Herat is to accompany the War Minister to Herat. (iv) It is stated that the Nurzais who form the majority of the population in Herat district, although in the .past they have repeatedly promised to stand by the Naib Salar, when recently called upon by him to re-affirm their promise on oath, have refused to do so. (v) The Naib Salar is reported to have obtained a considerable numbers of signa tures from among the civil and military officers and notables of Herat to a petition which has been despatched to Nadir Shah to the effect that the population of Herat was extremely satisfied with the Naib Salar as an administrator and they therefore humbly request His Majesty to allow him to remain premanently in Herat. (vi) It is reported that the Naib Salar, presumably in order to re-establish himselfin the eyes o{ the Kabul authorities, had recently remitted 3 lacs of rupees to the Jvabul Treasury. * 9 Ibrahim ^.—Information has reached Herat to the effect that Ibrahim Beu' has fled from Kataghan with a handful of followers and that he is now in the area of Andkhui where the intends to collect a force of Turkomans with the object, it is said, of moving on Herat. ^ OTE/ This latter report requires confirmation before acceptance. 10. Raids from Soviet territory into Afghanistan.—A- party of Jamshedi tribes men who originally resided m the Herat Province, but who now live in Soviet terri tory in the vicinity of Kushk. recently crossed into Afghanistan in the area of Kala Nau, where they are reported to have killed a number of Afghans and also to ha\ e seized and driven a large quantity of Afghan cattle into Soviet territory. The Mamur-i-Kharjia of Herat who has visited the area of this recent raid is said to have expressed the opinion that this Jam shedi raid has been perpetrated at the instigation of the Bolsheviks who supply the former with arms and give them every encouragement. He also ascertained that these Jamshedi raiders were in possession of q mnrJune eun. HI Central Asiatic Republics. 11 The following information has been obtained from an individual who left Guzar on the 16th March 19ol . U) Kolhozy. —Generally speaking these have proved to be a failure through out Tajikistan. During the past 14 months approximately 1,500 Tajik and Uzbek families have migrated into Afghanistan as a protest against the introduction of this unpopular agrarian reform. It is reported that a number of Tajik families who last February were caught by the G. P. U. in the act of escaping into Afghanistan were arrested and have since been deported from Turkestan. Hi) Food Shortage. Owing to the Gov ernment degree to the effect that no cereals are to be cultivated in Tajikistan the shortage of food grains is becoming more and more acute. The prices of food sold privately are soaring, while the State supply shops are unable to cope with the demands ol the population. 12. The information given below has been obtained from an individual who left Katta Kurghan on the 19th March 1931.— (i) Basmachi gangs have re-appeared in the area of Katta Kurghan since the commencement of March. In the opinion of the informant the strength of these Basmachi gangs will increase in the future as the people of Uzbekistan have now become desperate as a result of poverty and hunger. (ii) Kolhozy—redistribution of native farmers. —The native peasantry in the Kutta Kurghan district have so far showed little desire to be “ collectivized 11 . The autho rities have therefore deported some 300 families to Kirghizistan and have brought an equal number of Kirghiz farmers to Katta Kur ghan. The latter who have agreed to the collective farming policy are nevertheless showing little enthu siasm in this work. The Soviet authorities insist on the cultivation of cotton in this area to exclusion of all cereals. (Hi) Scale of Rations issued to workmen on jiayment :— Bread .. 2 Pounds a day. Meat .. 3 Pounds a month. Kerosine Oil .. 5 Pounds a month. Sugar .. 1 Round a month. Cotton material 6 Yards a month. Tea • • a limited quantity per month. 13. The information given below has been obtained from an individual who left Merv on the 3rd April 1931. (i) Red Army Identifications. —Units of the 2nd and 3rd Rifle Regiments. y OTE —The 2nd Turkestan Rifle Regiment was pre viously reported in Kushk. If the above statement is correct this would indicate that the 1st Turkestan Rifle Division may have been reorganised. (ii) Frontier G. P. U. “ Otryad'—ls No. 45. Note.—C onfirms previous information. (iii) Introduction of travelling permits in the U. S. S. i?.—Notices were posted throughout the U. S. S. R. on the 15th March 1931 to the effect that all persons desiring to travel from their place of residence must be in possession of a travel ling permit obtainable from the local O. G. P. U. department. The public were duly warned that those4 persons not in possession of these permits when travelling by rail or road would be arrested and im prisoned. (iv) Arrest of would-be emigrants to Afghanistan. —36 Baluch families who formerly lived in the area of 1 ulatan were recently arrested by the G. P. U. while trying to escape into Afghanistan. They have been brought to Merv and are now in prison. {v) Merv-Kushk Railway Service.—X passenger train runs daily between Merv and Kushk and vice versa. 14. The following information which is dated 14th March 1931 has been received from Dushambe :— (?) Some 500 Uzbek families have re cently arrived in Dushambe from Andijan and Marghelan areas and have since been despatched to the Pamirs to work on State farms ( i£ Sovhozy ”). The Tajiks are displeased at the arrival of these Uzbek cultivators. (h) Serious trouble is taking place it^ the Pamirs, due to the introduc^ tion of “collectivism” in that area.. The local native inhabitants who are reported to be partially armed refuse to be “ collectivised ” and are offering considerable resist ance against the introduction of this system in their midst. {iii) A large electric power station and also workshops for repairing aero planes are now in the process of being erected in Dushambe.

(b) Naib Arsalan Mirza of the Behrami Cavalry Regiment has also pro ceeded to Teheran. This Officer, who is the son of Asadullah Mirza Shahab Dowlen, the Governor of Kermanshah, and cousin of Amir-i-Lashkar Amanullah Mirza, is unlikely to return to Meshed. (c) The Shahpur Regiment. —The Shah- pur Regiment celebrated its Regi mental “ Birthday ” on the 26th April. A concert was given on that night by Sarhang Qadiri, the Officer Commanding the Regi ment. The Governor General, heads of departments, notables and all officers of the garrison were invited.

Proposed to cultivation of tobacco in Khorasan. —The Tobbacco Monopoly De partment has submitted a report to the Ministry of Economics to the effect that conditions are favourable for the production of good tobacco throughout the whole of Khorasan, with the exception of the dis tricts of Kalat-i-Naderi and Sarakhs. It is stated that the Ministry of Economics is considering the question of appointing an Italian Specialist with a view to sending him to Meshed to superintend the growing of tobacco in Khorasan. 5. Deportation of refugees from the U. S. \ S. R .—It is reported that 11 Russians who escaped into Persia and who had been brought to Meshed were sent back to the U. S. S. R. under Amnieh escort on the 22nd April. It is said that the local police authorities de cided on this step owing to their belief that these 11 refugees were in reality agents of the G. P. U. Department. Three other Russian refugees who had recently escaped via Afghanistan have been arrested in Keriz and have been returned by the Amnieh to Afghanistan, y (b) Turkish Affairs. 6. Turkish Consulate Staff. —It has been ascertained that the Vice-Consul is named Bahauddin Effendi, while the Interpreter is an individual named Hashim Agha, who is a Persian subject. (c) Afghan Affairs. 7. Abdur Razaq Khan (W. V*\ 113), the Afghan Consul General held a reception on the 29th April on the occasion of the Id-i-Qurban festival. The Governor Gene ral, heads of departments and all foreign representatives were invited. The Soviet Consulate staff were, however, prevented from attending owing to the severe “ cloud burst ” which visited Meshed on that day and which cut off the Soviet Consulate from the rest of Meshed. Abdur Razaq is very corpulent, pleasant and friendly, though he is said to possess a very hot temper. (u) It is reported that Abdur Razaq Khan tried to persuade local Afghan subjects to attend prayers on the occasion of this festival at the Shrine of Imam Reza and to pray with the Shias. This the Afghans refused to do. Note.— From the above it would appear that Abdur Bazaq is endeavouring to bring about a better under standing between the Sunni and Shia communities. (d) Soviet Affairs. 8. Soviet Officials. —Basil Karableff, Soviet Vice-Consul in Darahgaz, has been on a short visit to Meshed. He left lg| card on the members of II. B. M.’s CdF sulate General. 9. The “ Shark ” Company — (?) This Soviet Concern is displaying very considerable commercial activities in Meshed. Invitations have been issued to all leading Persian officials and merchants as well as to foreign representatives to attend a demonstration, to be arranged next week, of Soviet manufactured agricultural impli- ments. [ii) It is reported that two Persians named Ali Asghar and Mussayeb have been sent to Herat as agents of the Meshed branch of this “ Shark ” Company. (Hi) It is alleged that this Company employs a Tabrezi chauffeur named Mahmud Rezai (known to the Russians as Rezaeff) who drives a lorry (Khorasan No. 10G4) between Meshed and Duzdap. Rezaeff is reported to be specially employed for the carriage of letters and of the Shark Company’s agents between Meshed and Duzdap. The des cription given of Rezaeff is as follows :—Tall, dark complexion, mole on right cheek, between 25 and 27 years of age. It is diffcult to believe that the activi- : ties of the “ Shark ” Company are j confined exclusively to commerce , and trade. II.— Seistan. 10. Distribution of the Helmend river water supply. —Reference to paragraph 8 of Summary No. 4. The Persian Govern ment has appointed Dr. Behram as their representative on the Perso-Afghan Com mission which is to determine this question. He left Meshed for Seistan on the 4th May. III.— Herat. 11. A report was spread in Islam Kala on the 2nd May that a party of GO armed l - men headed by ex- K ing Amanuliah had entered Afghan territory via Russia and were moving southwards towards Islam Kala. The Sarhaddar at Islam Kala, re ported this to Herat. The Naib Salar issued prompt orders that this party should be prevented from moving further into j Afghan territory, adding that he was send ing troops from Herat to the Sarhaddar’s ,*4 c * 3 assistance. Much to the relief of Abdur Rahim’s mind it was subsequently ascer tained that this armed party consisted of 40 Amir Rasul’s bandits which after being Bhgaged by the Herat troops was complete ly defeated and dispersed. The Sarhaddar lias since been summoned to Herat to give an explanation to the Naib Salar for issuing this false report. Note.— This incident is only inportant in tha4; it shows Abdur Rahim’s attitude towards the possibility of Amanullah Khan’s return to Afghanistan. IV—Central Asiatic Republics. 12. The following information has been obtained from a resident of Sarai Kamar who left there on the 18th April and who has since arrived in Meshed :— (i) Red troops .—About 100 men be longing to the 81st Cavalry Regi ment arrived in Sarai Kamar from Termez on the 4th April. (ii) G. P. U. Troops. —These belong to the 48th G. V. U. Frontier Guard “ Otryad ”. There are 14 posts held by G. P. U. troops between Sarai Kamar and Termez. These are as follows : Faizabad, Imam Sahib (presumably a post so named in Soviet territory opposite Imam Sahib which is within Afghan territory, Jarkeshkin (not on map), Pyanj, Kurra Jaid (not on map), Jallil Kul, Takhta Kuval, Aivaj, Turn Guzar (not on map), Turn Tukolai (not on map) Khatin Robat, Khowaja Gul Sowar (not on map), Irwatan and Hazara Tughai (near Termez). (in) Navigation on the Amy Darya.— There is a weekly steamer service for passengers and freight between Termez and Sarai Kumar, mer chandise arriving in Sarai Kamar from Termez is exported to Afghanistan where it is sold at very low prices. 13. Deportation of Caucasians to Tur kestan .—A recent arrival from Charjui who travelled to Meshed via Askhabad states that he observed 2 train loads of Caucasian &lt;£ prisoners ” in all about 1,500 elderly men, women and children, at Askhabad. These people who comprised Tartars, Georgians Armenians and Lezgins were being deported from the Caucasus for opposing the “ Collec tivisation ” campaign. The informant add ed that these prisoners are detrained for 24 hours at all the large stations and are marched through the towns as an object lesson to Turkomans, who threaten to refuse to be “ collectivised ”. The absence of young men among these prisoners was explained by the fact that those capable of doing hard manual work had already been deported to Northern Russia. L.

The Soviet Consul General, M. Skaloff, accompanied by Lutvak, Head of the Meshed Branch of the “ Shark ” Com pany, left for Tehran on the 17th May. It is stated he will be absent from Meshed for only ten days. 5. Demonstration of Soviet Agricultural Machinery .—As reported in paragraph 9 (?•) of Summary No. 9, this demonstration, which was arranged by the Soviet Trade Agency (“ Torgpredstvo ”) under the pat ronage of the Governor General, duly took place on the 11th May in the village of Bojmahan near Meshed before a large gathering of local Persian officials and notables and foreign representatives. No tractors were shown, as, according to M. Tomarinsen, the local Soviet “ Torgpred ”, these could not be brought to Meshed in time for this demonstration owing to the bad state of the roads between here and the Soviet frontier. He mentioned in his speech that he hoped it would be possible2 A, X to arrange to hold another demonstration of Soviet agricultural machinery in the autumn when he promised that the latest Soviet tractors would also be shown. Following this demonstration M. Skaloff held an “ At Home ” at the Soviet Consulate. At this entertainment, which lasted from 4-30 to 8-30 P.M., the guests were treated to a “ stand up ” supper and a cinema performance. • The band of the Shah pur Regiment was in attendance. 6. Turkomans and the League of Nations. —An individual named Sakhi Ishan, who states he is a delegate specially sent by a council of 20 Turkoman elders claim ing to represent 175,000 Turkoman families; has arrived in Meshed... This individual is in possession of a letter addressed to the League of Nations and signed by these 20 Turkoman elders appealing to the League for assistance and deliverance of the Turkoman nation from Soviet oppression. As this delegate is without a ‘passport he is likely to meet with considerable difficul ties in carrying out his mission, namely of proceeding from Meshed to Geneva and delivering his letter in person to the Council of the League of Nations.- 7. Expulsion of Samoiloff .—Please refer to my Summary No. 5, paragraph 3. Samoiloff who has been living in Meshed has now been notified by the local authori ties that in accordance with instructions received from Tehran he is to leave Persian territory within seven days. No reason has been given him for this sudden decision arrived at by the Persian Government to expel Samoiloff from Persia, but it is believed that Agabekoff’s disclosures are mainly responsible for this drastic step. It is probable that Samoiloff will now proceed to Tehran where he will apply to His Britannic Majesty’s Legation for permission for himself and his wife to proceed to Baghdad. (c) French Affairs. 8 . The Citroen Expedition, referred to in paragraph 7 of Summary No. 9 of Military Attache, Tehran, arrived in Meshed from Tehran on the 12th .May and left for Herat on the 17th May.

He is reported to have ex pressed his dissatisfaction with the conduct of affairs there. 2. The Muharram. —Ashura day passed off very quietly this year, thanks to the special precautions taken by the police and the military authorities. No body was permitted to cut his head except in a certain area of the Shrine compound spe cially allotted for this purpose.

A party of 15 men and women accompanied by two parentless children succeeded in escaping from AsklJJ bad and getting to Meshed during the past fortnight. It is stated that these children, whose ages were 6 and 4 and whose parents were intercepted by the Soviet frontier guards, were not unduly dismayed at losing their parents and that on their way between the frontier and Meshed their enquiries were almost entirely confined to the ques tion of food, namely as to whether bread was obtainable in the new town that they were travelling to, and if so, how long one had to stand in a bread queue (in Meshed). 5. Sarai Turkoman. —The following has been elicited from a Persian Officer serving in the Bujnurd garrison who recently arrived in Meshed :— (i) Settlement of the Lurs. —275 Lur fami lies have been settled near KHARAQI on the Atrak river (48 miles N.-W. of Bujnurd —please see map of India and Adjacent Countries).

I.—Khorasan. (a) Persian Affairs. 1. Military. —Sarhang Iraj Khan, G. 0. C., Eastern Division, is leaving for a ten days’ tour as far as Gumbaz-i-Kabus to inspect the Bujnurd garrison and posts on the Soviet frontier. He also is charged with the organisation of the Amnieh De partment in Turkoman territory and the repair of the road to Sehra. 2. Conscription. —Thirty-five conscripted recruits from the Nishapur district arrived in Meshed on the 5th July. 3. Economic. —The wheat and opium ( crops this year in Khorasan have been excellent. Sufficient excess is reported to form a substantial reserve for next year. The reduction of the tax on opium has led to sales increasing from 200 to 3,000 miscals daily. It no longer pays to smuggle this commodity on account of \ its present low price. ' MC376FD 4. The Quetta-Zahidan Railway. —The suspension of the service of the Quetta- Zahidan Railway has produced consider able consternation among the merchants of Meshed. The Governor General called a meeting of merchants to discuss the situa tion and report fully to Tehran. In spite of the fact that the trade mono poly has greatly decreased trade with India through Zahidan, the chief import ing merchants have always looked forward to brighter prospects. Some merchants, however, who hold stocks, are making hay while the sun shines, and have turned the shortage of imports from India to advantage by putt ing up their prices. Soviet trading concerns are naturally pleased since it throws trade more into their hands and definitely directs econo mic orientation towards Russia. 5. Exports .—The embargo on the export of wool from Persia to Soviet Russia has now been raised. 3(6) Afghan Affairs. 6. Hardar Sher Mohammed Khan, Af ghan Minister in Tehran, has been recalled 10 Kabul—whether permanently or not is unknown. (c) Soviet Affairs. 7. Soviet Activities in Persia .—The fabri cation of passports by the local Soviet Consulate is shown by the following inci dent. The First Secretary to the Soviet Consul General, Degtyarik, came to the Rais-i-Nazmieh asking for a visa for a woman Soviet subject. He showed a pass which was not approved by the authori ties who requested the passport to be pro duced. It was stated that the passport had been left in the Consulate and would be brought to the Nazmieh next day. On inspsqtion of the passport produced the next day it was seen that the date of issue was the same as the day on which it was presented. The suspicions of. . the Rais-i-Nazmieh were aroused and on insti gating enquiries it was found that the woman in question was a paid Bolshevik spy. She was arrested and imprisoned. The Soviet Consul General has register ed a complaint with the Governor General. 8. Russian Refugees.—In consequence of the repatriation of refugees by the Persian authorities, Russian bogus refugees who are really employed by the Soviet are reported to have been assisted to enter Persia by means of false passports shewing them to be members of various Soviet trade offices in Khorasan. On this becoming known the Governor General requested the Soviet Consulate to furnish a list of all Soviet employees. The Consul General has so far refused—it is stated, owing to the fact that many employees are well known spies whom the police have long wished to deport. 9. Deportation of Russian undesirables.— The local Persian authorities have recently deported several undesirables, it is said that Jaialbegoff, Proprietor of the Mosel Prom (Summary XIB “ 4 ” of 1926) who has long been suspected of being an agent is to be removed. It will be interesting to see if the local Soviet authorities can pre vent this. 10. Samoilov .—(See Summaries Nos. ^ ‘ 3 ’ and 19 ‘ 7 ’ of 1931) who was undK orders for deportation from Persia has persuaded the Afghan Minister in Tehran to assist him to proceed to Afghanistan as an engineer. He arrived in Meshed ostensibly en route for Kabul on the 27th of June, with a letter for the Governor General requesting him to render assistance on the way via Kariz. He left on the 2nd of July for Afghanis tan. (He was mentioned in Agabekov’s book). II. —Herat— Nil. III. —Central Asiatic Republics. 11. Basmachi. —An individual who has resided many years in Charjui who arrived in Meshed from there on the 2nd of July reports that in view of the increased Yanut Basmachi activity in the vicinity of Khiva and along the Oxus, the guard on the Charjui bridge has been strengthened and search-lights have been installed on the banks of the river. 12. River Flotilla at Charjui. —The same source gives the following details regarding the. river flotilla at Charjui— Steamers .. • • 7 Barges .. •• ..18 Armoured motor launches .. 4 These are manned by a Naval detach ment. Note.—T his statement requires confirmation. 13. It is reported that fighting has oc curred between the Basmachi and the Rod . forces at Khiva and other posts along the Oxus north of Charjui. It is rumoured that the Bolsheviks have been forced to evacuate Khiva and fall back | on Petro Alexanderovsk. Further enquiries are being made. G. W.

Military — (i) Sarhang Iraj Khan, Com manding the Eastern Division returned to Meshed on the 15th instant from a tour through the Turkoman districts in the neighbourhood of Bujnurd and Kuchan. He was pleased with his inspection and reported the state of the Bujnurd garrison to be satisfactory. The principal object of this tour was to establish further frontier posts to control the influx of refugees especially along the Gifan frontier up to the limits of the Yamut Turkoman district. The control of frontier and Amnieh posts in this area was handed back to the local Turkomans again. (Control had been taken away from them after the trouble in this area in 1926-27.) Five new posts were established. To ensure the satisfactory working of this system detachments of troops from Bujnurd and Astrabad will patrol the frontier at intervals to see the new posts are carrying out their duties properly. (ii) The Bahrami Artillery and some ifantry of the Shahpur Regiment pro- [C426FD enclosure in foreign SECRE t * rv s , P no H2Q *■ ceeded from Meshed to Shandiz and Turk- beh respectively on the 23rd July for summer training This will last about a month. 2. Refugees. —The situation regarding the influx of refugees is causing considerable trouble to the Persian authorities through out Khorasan. The numbers coming across the border are more than the Amnieh and troops can deal with. Refugees include large numbers of Turkoman and Baluch residents from Soviet territory as we 1 as Russians. It is not possible to get accurate figures of the numbers coming over such an extensive frontier but the following details give an indication that the numbers are very considerable. Baluchis, 60 families via Afghan terri tory from the Penjdeh district ente ed Persia in the neighbourhood of Zorabad in the first week of July. Turkomans, three lots each of about 1000 have crossed the frontier between Moham- medabad and Bajgiran during the last three weeks. Russians, 50 families of Molakan (a non conform st sect) crossed near Kalat-i-Nadiri about three weeks ago. They have been permitted to come to Meshed where they are at present. They have brought all their stock and have requested the local authorities to permit them to settle in the immediate vicinity of Meshed. It is doubt ful if this request will, be approved. In addition to the above several Russians have been sent back across the frontier from Kuchan and other places. 3. Economic. —The Persian Monopoly Laws came into action on the 27th of July. The Soviet, who have bought all the cotton -crop in this part of Persia, have been making desperate efforts to get all they had pur chased and stored in Nishapur and else where out of the country before that date. They have hired 80 lorries at any price for which they could be obtained for the purpose, and have also, it appears, bribed M. Jackmain, the local Customs Official to send two or three subordinates to Nisha pur, who are employed in issuing export permits and sealing the bales after the expiry of the date fixed. 4. The Pers az Neft has run out of petrol in Meshed. The stock of the A. P. 0. C. is being rationed to postal and bona fide transport lorries. The shortage is tempo rarily acute. It is said that 20,000 poods of petrol and 7 wagon loads of sugar are held up in the frontier near Bajgiran, awaiting permission to import. • 5. Soviet activity. —The Soviet Consulate in Meshed has been bribing the Assistant Governor General, Aun Jazar to assist in the release of Soviet employees from prison. This official is on good terms with Bolshe viks and may always be expected to give them assistance whenever possible. 6. Soviet propaganda. —It is reported that Soviet propaganda is being carried on in recruiting area in the Bajgiran dis trict. Two Persian Kurds Alio and Mamao have been arrested in this connection. 7. Communications .— (i) A new road has been constructed between Lutfabad and Kuchan which is fit for motor traffic. (ii) The road between Meshed and Shahrud which had been badly damaged by rain is being repaired. (Hi) A metalled road has been opened between Daragaz and Kuchan. Travellers have been instructed to use this via Dudanlu and Chihilmir. 8. Indian Ghadr Party Activ ties —Amrik Singh has been sent to Teheran by the • Persian authorities. A Sikh driver, one Doctor Nasib Singh (a compounder), who gave security in^ Birjand to appear before the Nazmieh in Meshed in 4 days, arrived here on the 25th July 1931. He has since disappeared. He is further involved in a case of run ning over a woman. His case is now be fore the Adlieh (Department of Justice). Both of the above men are under orders for deportation. 9. It is reported that local Sikhs are lending their British Indian passports to unauthorised persons. Enquiries are being made. 10. Personalia. —Mehr Dad, Governor of Zahidan has been appointed Governor of Bujnurd. It is not known here who will ne nominated to Zahidan. 11. Haji Mahmud Herati, a leading Af ghan merchant and sometime Afghan Consul in Meshed, was killed in a motor accident on 11th July. • 12. First Naib Ali Quli Mirza, who was a “ Mamur ” on the Bujnurd frontier, has been relieved by Yawar .Daulat Shahi (See Summary No. 12 “ ii ”). 13. Mirza Mohd Sarwar Khan, Wali of Kabul, from Mecca passed through Me shed en route for Kabul via Herat and Kandahar on the 26th July. He stayed in Meshed a week. II.— Central Asia Republics. 14. There appears to be little doubt that more or less serious disorder prevails in many widely separated parts of Turkes tan. The chief centre of trouble at the moment appears to be along the Central Asian Railway between Krasnovodsk and Char- jui. An unconfirmed report states that Basmachi bands under Mullah Jaijik operate between Kizil Arvat and Kara Burghaz and have succeeded in holding up the train service on several occasions, killing the Bolshevik guards. Trains run without lights at night on this account. Skirmishes between Basmachi bands and the troops sent out from Krasnovodsk occur frequently and on the 19th of July an aeroplane w T as shot down by the Bas machi near Bournakh (near the Southern shore of the gulf of Kara Bourghaz).Daily reconnaissance flights along the rail way are carried out between Jebel and Krasnovodsk where three machines are stationed for the purpose. It is further stated that considerable numbers of the troops sent against the Basmachi have gone over to the enemy. Stations are now strongly guarded and train escorts have been increased. Bombs were discovered on the railway line near Askhabad recently. A month ago the Basmachi attacked Osh inflicting heavy casualties on the garrison. Of troops sent to relieve the situation, a party of Orenburg Kazaks (Uzbeks) numbering, it is said, 550 deserted en masse to the Basmachi. Another source reports that advanced Headquarters of the forces in Tajikistan has moved back to Hissar, and that Dush- ambe which is wired in, is held by detach ment. A party under 1 Shaltai, a friend of Junaid Khan, is stated to have raided the Government stud farm at Askhabad and stolen 31 Australian mares after having killed the guard and taken their rifles. Another raid on the Government shops at Kaakha was made by the Turkomans of Merve who also damaged the railway line. It is stated that on the 15th of June a band of 1500 Basmachi carried out a night attack on Kurghan Tube, drove out the garrison and looted ammunition and sup plies which were conveyed to Kulyab. This band moved further on and attacked Kabadian and Jali Kul looting further stores. The above reports which are mostly from travellers, Turkomans, Uzbeks and Persians are naturally not capable of con firmation at short notice, but coming as they do from varied sources, probably contain a certain amount of truth, and convey the impression that only lack of organisation and shortage of ammunition' prevents a serious rising throughout most of Turkistan. III. —Herat. 15. Nothing of interest to report. It is stated that 23 rifles were smuggled across the border on the 24th of June. 16. Jangal, a notorious robber of Baid- ghaz (near Kushk) succeeded in driving 60 flocks of sheep from Russian territory inta Afghanistan. L. G. W. HAMBER, Major, Secy, to H. B.

I.—KHORASAN. 1. Military. —Nothing of interest to re port. Many units are out of Meshed for summer training (vide Summary No. 14, paragraph 1 “ ii”.) 2. Conscription. —Thirty-five recruits arriv ed at Kuchan from Firuze and were sent to Meshed on the 9th of August. 3. Economic. — (i) A company is being formed in Meshed under the auspices of the Governor General in Khorasan for the manufacture of cotton thread. The follow ing are reported to have taken shares in this enterprise. H. M. the Shah 50,000 tomans ; The National Bank of Meshed 100,000 to mans ; Robert Wonkhaus (a German firm) Tomans 200,000. The merchants of Meshed were offered 200,000 tomans worth of shares but have up-to-date only purchased 86,000 tomans. The chief private holders amongst them are the Mutawalli Bashi and Haji Qaim Muqam, who have bought tomans 10.000 each. (ii) It is reported that another company has been formed in Seistan under the direc torship of Sarhang Murtaza Khan the Frontier Commissioner, with a capital of 50.000 tomans for developing the land round Kila Rustam by modern agricultural means. Mechanically operated wells are to be installed. (Hi) The petrol shortage in Meshed has been eased by the arrival of 2,000 poods of Russian petrol from Bajgiran. ENCLOSURE IN lND,A FOREIGN SECRfTARY'g No ft 3| A. (iv) The shortage of white wool required by the carpet industry has led to the imposi tion of an export duty of Krans 2 on every white sheep. Sheep of other colours may be exported free. (v) Trade with Russia is distinctly on the increase in Meshed. This is not only due to the efforts of the Soviet trading concerns but a natural consequence of the uncer tainty attending the future of the Quetta- Zahidan Railway. (vi) Dobrovski (? “ Torgpred ” Trade re presentative) in Tehran together with an other Russian Motikov arrived by air from Tehran in a special aeroplane (Junkers) on the 2nd August. They returned by air on the 4th. Probably their visit was in connection with the monopoly law and its effect on the export of goods to Russia. (vii) Persian officials in Khorasan as well as the chief merchants are reported to be favourable to increased trade with Soviet Russia. They are certainly all doing well out of it directly and indirectly. (viii) Cotton which has been transported across the frontier is lying at Goudan. It appears that the Russians have not enough transport to take it on to Askhabad. They tried to arrange for this through the Persian postal contractor but failed to do so. The contract has been accepted by an Armenian garage proprietor in Meshed by the name of Philip Chiechmanian. He has further agreed to carry the Soviet postal courier to Askahabad while this contract is being fulfilled.2 (iv) The “ Shark ” Company has arranged weekly trade discussions with representa tives of the Meshed merchants. 4. Refugees. — (i) 20 families of Turkomen- arrived in Meshed from Daragaz on the 26th July. {ii) The Molakan families (Summary No. 14, paragraph 2) who have been in Meshed for the past month are being permitted to settle at Timurabad, 9 farsakhs from Meshed on the Sarakhs road. (in) 15 Russians arrived from Persian Sarakhs on the 30th July. 9 of these who call themselves engineers (the favourite title adopted by a refugee) may perhaps be employed by the Persian Government. 5. Pulri-Khatun Barrage. —Nasr, the Head of the Revenue Department, together with an engineer from Shiraz left Meshed on the 6th August for Sarakhs to discuss with two Russian engineers and two officials the question of the Pul-i-Khatun water sup- ply- This problem is a hardy annual, which has been going on for many years and up to the present has not been solved. The distribution of water along the fron tier has been the subject of continual quar rels. It is proposed to irrigate Kalat-i-Nadiri, Shamshi, Lutfabad and Bajgiran. 6. Officials. —Abdul Faiz Khan left Meshed on the 1st August to take up the post of Director of Customs at Zahidan. 7. General. —Earthquake shocks were felt in Kuchan and Shirwan on the 7th and 8th of August. No damage is reported. II.-HERAT. 8. (i) It is reported that Afzal Ahmed Khan, Assistant Minister of Justice at Kabul has been deputed to visit Herat on inspection duty to enquiie into complaints against Naib Salar Abdur Rahim Khan, Governor of Herat. (ii) It is stated that all Afghan military posts have been withdrawn from the Afghan- Persian frontier. This action which is reported officially may indicate internal disorder in Afghanistan. (Enquiries are being made). III.—CENTRAL ASIATIC REPUBLICS. 9. An individual who left Kelif on the 20th July reports as follows :— (i) G. P. U. —The Headquarters of the 47th Otryad G. P. U. is at Termez. Kelif Detachme^U .— Commander . SUCHKOV. Strength.—120 men. Of these 40 are stationed at Kelif and the remainder at the frontier posts of Kara Kamar and Baldar. (ii) Conscription. —Conscription has been^ stopped in the Kelif area. Formerly all™ conscripts used to be sent to Termez. They are now sent to Tashkent. (in) Morale of troops. —The morale of the Mahomedan troops is reported to be un satisfactory. They are gradually being relieved by Russians, Georgians and Armenians and are transferred from Tajikistan to the Tashkent area. (iv) Air Accident. —At the beginning of July all Government institutions were closed for a day to commemorate the death in an aeroplane accident of the Chief of the General Staff, three other military offi cers and two pilots. The informant is un able to give names or further particulars. The bodies are reported to have been taken to Moscow. It is rumoured that the machine crashed in the vicinity of Dushambe. (v) Emigration. —During the period 1st June to 20th July about 400 Uzbek, Tajik. Turkoman and Kara Kalpak families crossed the Afghan frontier in the vicinity of Kelif with all their property. They are said to have been permitted to settle in Afghanis tan. 0 On the 25th June 25 Mahomedan soldiers of the Frontier Guard at Kara Kamar de serted across the Afghan frontier with their arms. (vi) Many of the Turkoman refugees in Afghan territory have become brigands and smugglers. They frequently attack the frontier guard posts. (vii) Basmachi— r Wv following particu- 1 rs of the defeat of the Basmachi in the vicinity of Dushambe on or about the 20th June are given. It is stated that the Soviet forces surprised the Ba; m xhi by leaving a small force in the town and concealing the remaining troops in the hills around. The Basmachi attacked i the town and were surrounded. They suffered heavy casualties, the brother, nep hew and uncle of Ibrahim Beg being killed. It was given out that Ibrah-m Beg had been captured and sent to Tashkent. This, however, was not a fact. After their defeat the Basmachi retired to Baljiwan. It w r as reported that on the 15th of July more bands had collected having received assistance from Afghanistan, and w r ere again troubling the Soviet forces in the neigh bourhood of Kulyab and Baljiwan. 1{viii) The Termez-Dushambe Railway which had not been running for some time has now recommenced regular service. About 150 labourers are employed between Kelif and Dushambe. {ix) Russo-Afyhan trade. —Trade which, for a long time had been at a standstill, re opened about the beginning of July. A considerable quantity of merchandise such as cloth, matches, kerosine oil and sugar has been brought to Kelif and is exported to Afghanistan, where it is ex changed for cotton, wool, live stock, raisins and almonds and other articles. The sys tem is more one of barter than sale. The Soviet are stated to have announced that a Soviet-Afghan trade agreement has been signed in June. This agreement is similar to the one concluded with Aman- ullah. Mahomed Afzal Khan, the Afghan frontier guard Superintendent, pa d a 24-hour visit to Kelif, where he was given an enthusiastic welcome by the G. P. IL, with whom he stayed as a guest. (x) Three trains a week run through Kelif in each direction, one passenger and two goods. Military tra’ns run at unstated intervals. (xi) Two patrol tugs run between Kelif and Termez to check smugglers. {xii) Four ferry boa J s (two Russian and two Afghan) work on the river at Kelif. 10. An individual who left Kizil Arvat on the 1st August gives the following informa tion:— (i) Garrison. —The garrison of Kizil Arvat which was formerly very small has been reinforced during the last month and now consists of about 1,200 infantry and 800 cavalry and artillery. (ii) G. P. U. —There are located there about 25 men of the 46th Otryad G. P. U., which has its headquarters in Askhabad. 35 more form the frontier guard at Kara Kala near the Persian frontier. Comman der’s name is SOMLINSKI. This post is connected with Kizil Arvat by a metalled read fit for wheeled traffic which extends for a distance of 90 kilome tres to the Persian frontier at the post of Duzlu Tepe. (in) Conscription. —Conscription has been closed in Turkmenistan. All 1931 recruits have been drafted into the local (t National) Turkoman Units. (iv) It is reported J .hat Ihe Government had considered the transfor of Turkomen troops to the Tashkent district. This ru mour became known and the Turkomen refused to be moved out of their home area. The Government has changed its policy in consequence and is treating the Turkomen troops generously in order to avoid possible trouble. (v) Air Force. —Since the 29th July three aeroplanes have been stationed at Kizil Arvat. They are said to have come from Askhabad. They made daily reconnais sance flights over the Kum (Desert). A large aerodrome is being construced near the railway station. (vi) Workshops. —This year has seen the development of a large workshop for the repair of rolling stock and locomotives at Kizil Arvat. It is stated that gun limbers are construct ed in a section of these works and also re pairs to guns and rifles are undertaken. This repair shop is said to be the largest in Turkistan employing 2,000 men. Note.— This is confirmed by another intelligent and reliable source, who adds that barracks are being construct ed and that Kizil Arvat is being developed into a considera ble military station. The open terrain on both sides of the railway and the existence of water in quantity have been decided factors in this connection. (vii) Murder of the Director of the Asiokh- leb (Asiatic Wheat Trust). —The local mana ger of the Asiokhleb and his wife were mur dered on the 30th June. A notice was found affixed to the door of his house stating that a similar fate awaited those who ex ported the countries’ good supplies while the inhabitants were starving. The Assistant of the G. P. U. was shot on the 1st August and seriously wounded. (viii) Change of policy towards the Tur komen. —The failure of the Kolhoz and the hostile attitude of the Turkomen who have been assisting the Basmachi, has led to a propitiatory attitude bemg adopted on the part of Government. It is hoped that this will prevent any immediate trouble until the activities of the Basmachi have grown less threatening. It is stated that a severe engagement took place between the Basmachi and the Gov ernment forces in the neighbourhood of Bala Hashim. The Government lost about 100 men in deserters alone. (ix) Peace negotiations with rebels. —The Askhabad Government sent two envoys to Ar Chaman to negotiate with the Turko man rebels. The rebels sent six delegates to meet them.4 The Government are stated to have offered to fulfil all the demands of the Turkomen provided they surrendered their arms. The rebels refused to have any dealings with the Government under these conditions. To The D. D. M. L, A. H. Q., Simla. Distribution .— As usual. It is stated that considerable.numbers of Soviet troops have been moved to Kizil Arvat, Ar Chaman and Bala Hashim in order to undertake operations as soon as the weather is cooler. L. G. W.

I.—Khorasan, Persian Affairs. 1. Military .—(i) The Bahrami Artillery which went for summer training to Turka- beh has returned to Meshed. [See Sum mary No. 14, paragraph l (m).] (ii) Sultan Mirza Ali Khan Izidi has been appointed commander of the Military de tachment at Turbat-i-Haideri. He left Meshed on the 22nd August. 2. Coriscription. — (i) 150 recruits from Nishapur left for Tehran on the 11th August. (ii) Sultan Sahib-ud-Din, Commander of the Conscription Department in Bajgiran, who arrived on leave in Meshed on the 27th August reports that the Soviet agents have been busy among the young men of con- scriptable age. Three agents have been already arrested in this connection. Only 42 recruits have so far been taken from this district, from which it appears that Bol shevik propaganda has met with some success. INnu ' * VOUftt IN D,A FOREIGN SECR r TAR Y ’g U ' e '' No uss ^ : '2ocr. m 3. Economic. — (i) There seems to be little doubt that trade throughout Nor- ! them Khorasan is rapidly becoming a Soviet monopoly. This situation has been brought about by the Persian Monopoly Law, which, as far as this province is con cerned, has led to a complete standstill in trade other than with or through the medium of the various Soviet trade or ganizations. The Soviet by liberal bribery and in fluence in Tehran, especially in the Trade Permit Department, where they have many agents, has succeeded in maid ig a corner in export and import certificate. Persian traders, who are not in a position to oil the wheels of the Adminetration, are thus entirely cut off from any means of disposing of their goods other than through Soviet trade agencies. The Soviet thus control prices and the movement of stocks. The local Customs Authorities and influential merchants, as well as the approachable members of the Administration, are bribed to assist and maintain this state of affairs,2 Persian merchants dispose of their goods, cotton, wool, dried fruits, etc., to the Russians for certificates showing advance purchase of Soviet goods, such as sugar, cloth, etc., before these have been im ported into Persia. These certificates of purchase are also used as a medium of trade between Persiarl merchants. The goods shown on the cer tificates are often delayed for months in Russia, and sometimes not received at all. On the other hand, goods bought from the Persians are always transferred across the border with as much expedition as possible. Bv juggling with prices the Soviet can cause a crisis in almost any commodity ; and also flood the market in a similar manner should it suit their purpose. Small merchants are going bankrupt in all directions. It seems probable that the Soviet trade policy aims at concentrating all trade into the hands of a few rich mer chants, who in their turn will be entirely under their influence. (ii) It is reported that a telegram was recently received in the Meshed Customs Office from the Persian Minister of Econo mics in Tehran authorising Russian firms in Khorasan to export goods to the extent of 400,000 gold Rials (£20,000). 4. Customs. — (a) The following instruc tions have been sent to all Persian Customs authorities :— (1) All prohibited articles under the Monopoly Law must be sent back from the Customs houses by the 23rd October. Otherwise they will be confiscated. Import of prohibited articles will not be allowed in any circumstances. (2) Prohibited articles brought into Persia will be considered as smug gled and the offender will be punish ed. (b) Krans 140.000 have been authorised for the construction of Customs posts at Jargakhan and Mafaveh Tepe on the Turkis- tan frontier. 5. It is reported the Persian Soviet Trade Agn ement has been signed. This requires confirmation. 6. Persian Officials and Personalia. — (i) Habib Ullah Khan Taimuri has been ap pointed Governor of Turbat-i-Shaikh Jam. He lit on the 29th August to take up his appointment. (ii) M. Righana, Manager of the Meshed bianch of ti e Pehlevi Bank, left for Tehran on 15th August to take up the appoint ment of Manager of the Bazaar branch there. (Hi) Salman Khan Asadi, a member of the Mejliss, son of the Mutawalli Bashi the Meshed shrine, visited Meshed on thev' 28th July returning to Tehran on the 31st. He stated that the Persian Crown Prince and the Court Minister will leave Tehran for Europe on the 5th instant. It is said Salman Khan will accompany them. The Prince will undergo his primary education in Switzerfand and finish at Paris. Taimur Tash will visit London during the period of the journey. (w) Mirza Ibrahim Khari, Governor of Sarakhs, is in Meshed on a month’s leave. (v) M. Graux, ex-Director of Customs at Zahidan, passed through Meshed en route for Tehran on the 19th/20th August. 7. Refugees. — (i) 42 Turkoman families which came in through the Lutfabad fron- 1 tier have requested the Persian Govern ment to permit them to settle in the Buj- nurd district. It appears their request has been granted. (ii) 26 Molakan families, which came over into the Bujnurd District, have been settled at Kuli Bagh in the Goklan Turko man district. (Hi) Refugees (Turkoman) continue to enter Persia via Sarakhs in considerable numbers. 36 families have been settled in Tiniurabad and 65 more are awaiting Government orders for their future in Yas Teppe and Gundikli. 8. Communications.—It has been decided to construct a new alignment of the Bir- jand-Zahidan Road to pass through Zabul. It is hoped to increase the population of the Zabul area by this means. (Zabul is the new name for Seistan.) 9. General—(i) An earthquake caused considerable damage to the villages of Bar- zalabad and Faizabad in the Kuehan dis trict on the 18th August. (ii) The antique treasures of the Meshed Shrine, which had been sent to London for the I ersian Art exhibition, were returned to Meshed on the 20th August. 10. Soviet Activities in Khorasan. (?) On the 9th August a dinner party was given in the Soviet Consulate to wl i ;h all local Communists were invited. At this dinner the Soviet Cons'll! General read out some instructions he had received from Moscow requesting the G. P. U. agents in Meshed to submit a report on their work for the period 1st May to 31st July 1931 together with an account of their expenditure sothat the results of their work might be assessed. (ii) The Soviet Consul General together with the members of the Consulate staff and the Soviet trade organisations in Meshed met on the evening of the 14th August in the garden of the Itbar-us-Saltaneh. The Consul General read out instructions he had received from Moscow to the effect that from the 1st August the following percentage of the pay of all Soviet em ployees serving outside the Soviet Union was to be cut and kept under deposit in Russia to be given to the employee when he leaves the service :— Per cent. Soviet Subjects (Russians) . * 25 ‘ Others, Non-Russians .. .. 45 The following evening there was a protest meeting of communist employees at the Office of the Shark Company. It was de cided to send a representation to Moscow requesting the remission of the proposed pay cut on account of the expense of living in Persia. It was suggested that this action would lead underpaid officials to search other pockets. Lebedev* the Head of the Intelligence Branch of the Shark, who has in the past been actively engaged in revolutionary propaganda, is reported to have more or less “ downed tools ” in connection with his propagandist duties as a protest against the pay cut, pending a reply to the general petition to Moscow. j*f 0XE . The “ pay cut ” has been corifirmed personally by the Soviet Consul General. (Hi) Pavilikh, a Russian lady, has been sent from Moscow to Meshed, nominally as a typist to the Soviet Con; ulate. She is reported to have instructions to get on intimate relations with Persian Officers and Officials. She has been frequently seen in the offices of the local Persian Adminis tration. (iv) A motor load of 80 boxes of perrian silver, each containing 2,000 tomans, has recently been sent from Tehran to the Soviet Bank in Meshed. It is stated this money originally came from Resht. (v) The Soviet Vice-Consul at Darajaz, Karablov, with his interpreter has gone to Teheran. The object of his visit is stated to be to find out if the Persians are sup plying arms to the Yamut Turkomen across the frontier in the Astrabad district. (vi) It is reported that the Soviet Consul G moral and the Soviet Military Attache (1st Secretary Dektarig) are on bad terms with each other. The heads of the Sharq are said to be with the Con ul General and the remainder with the 1 ,t Secretary. Bot h are writing reports about one another to Moscow. II.—Central Asian Republics. 11. Basmachi Activities. — (i) Kazan] ik Station has been burnt by the Basmachi and the railway so thoroughly destroyed that a diversion of several versts has been made to pass the break in the line. This attack took place at the end of July or early August. Note.—T he above information is known to be true. At the time the line was destroyed two passenger trains were wrecked,, one from the direction of Krasnovodsk and the other from Askhabad, whether this was due to enemy action or simply to their running off the destroyed track is not known,. (ii) A report from the frontier, dated 17th August, states that a very serious* en gagement took place at Kaakha between the rebel Turkmen and the Soviet forces. It is stated that 80 Turkmen and 130 Bolshevik troops were killed. Reinforce ments sent from Askhabad succeeded in driving off the raiders to the East after hard fighting. (Hi) The Turkomen attacked an am munition* store at Tarangan (West of Kaakha). 100 Turkomen and 200 Rus sians are reported to have been killed. The rebels captured several machine guns and a large quantity of ammunition. This has given the rebels considerable strength. (iv) A convoy of 8 lorries were burnt by the rebels about 30 miles from Askha bad on the 15th August, The exact place is not known. (v) All horses and wheeled transport were commandeered in Askhabad on the 7th of August and all the police sent out against the rebels. Women took over police duties. (vi) On the 28th July 300 Turkomen raid ed Bairam Ah, looted the Co-operative* and beheaded a number of Communist students. ♦Note. —The above reports have been received from more than one source. They are probably exaggerated with regard to the number of casualties, but at the same time it is certain the situation between Charjui and Krasnovodsk is critical. (vii) 80 Turkomen soldiers are reported to have de .erted in the course of one month and joined the Basmachi with their arms. (viii) Between the 5th and 7th August, four troop trains arrived in Merv from the direction of Charjui. One went on to Khushk, two to Askhabad and the fourth remained at Merv. Troop trains are report ed to be running frequently.4 (ix) When trains cross Charjui bridge all windows are closed and shuttered. Passengers are not allowed to look out of window. In a similar manner no one is allowed to remain on the deck of any vessel passing under the bridge. ' [x) It is reported that a new aerodrome is being constructed at Merv near the river. A reconnaissance machine is now stationed there in connection with the Basmachi activity. {xi) Anti-revolutionary Russians burnt down the railway stores at Kizil Arvat on the 14th August, 42 arrests are said to have been made. {xii) It is reported that on account of drought the wheat harvest in Orenburg this year has been an entire failure. Flour in the open market costs from Roubles 40 to 45 per pood. III.— Herat. 12. {i) It is reported that Junaid Khan and Karim Khan Baluch have both been called to Kabul. They have been given Rupees 5,000 (Kabuli) for the journey. The reason for their move seems to be the desire to get them further away from the Soviet frontier, where they are considered undesirable elements. Note.—T his information was confirmed by the Afghan Consul General. (ii) Large consignments of trade goods destined for Afghanistan have been des patched from Merv to Khushk. So far nothing has come from Afghanistan in exchange. L. G. W. HAMBER, Major, Secy, to H. B. M.’s Consul General, Meshed, To The D. D. M. I., A. H. Q., Simla. Distribution:— As usual.

His successor has not vet been nominated Degtyarig, the first Sec retary is acting Consul General pending the arrival of a permanent incumbent. It is stated that the reason for his recall is due to quarrels with the other members of the Consulate. He is reported to have fallen out with the local members of the vr. P. U. His wife is also reported to have made several tactless comments on their work. (u) Degtyarig was summoned to Askha- bad for a flying visit before M. Skaloff’s relief where he received certain instructions presumably m connection with the recent unpleasantness. This individual is report ed to have two other aliases, Ivanoff and Shvapaloff. Phis is apparently common practice with Soviet Officials who in their manner are able to conceal their connection with various Institutions to which Soviet support is not openly accorded. [Hi) Reference Summary No. 16 para graph 10 (ii). p An answer to the appeal for the remis sion of the pay cut of Soviet officials serving er-Kussia has been received. It confirms the decision to continue this policy, but as a concession certain allowances in connection with lodging expenses are sanctioned in approved c ircumstances.

Military .—There are rumours of a mutiny among the troops in the Burj- nurd area. The authorities are main taining the greatest secrecy about it and information up to date has been only fragmentary. However there seems little doubt that trouble is taking place. The story as heard up to date is as follows:— The Military Commander of Burjnurd Yawar Ali Reza Khan is reported to have kicked a Vakil Ba&lt;?hi, Ali Reza Khan (Sergeant Major) and to have in other ways caused considerable discon tent in his command. The Vakil Bashi and another Moham mad Husein persuaded the men of his company to desert and take to the hills between Burjnuid and Shirvan. He is stated to have joint'd up with disaffected Kurds in that neighbourhood and to have organized a sort of brigand force. Tr oops including a Section of Artillery have been sent out asainst him from Meshed, the exact number is not known, the C. R. A. of the Eastern Division Sarlang Sheklinski and other Staff Officers have also left Meshed for an un known designation which can be assumed to be in connection with the above affair. I personally met about a troop of cavalry with transport on the road to Kuchan on the 23rd instant. It is known that the trouble started abovit ten days ago, so they are assumed to have been en route to the scene of the disturb ance. Great interest is being displayed by the “ Sharq ” and other Soviet Institu tions in Meshed. To what extent, if any they are in touch with the situation is not known. 2. Soviet intrigue. —On the 17th Sep tember the Nazmieh arrested a Persian by the name of Hasan at the gate of the Soviet Consulate. He was found to have papers in his possession written in Persian and Turkoman calling on the workers to rise and over-throw their Government and break the power Of’thm ~ Capitalists, etc. ' ‘ : WMA FOREIGN SEC’ Letter No i 3. Revolutionary Organization. —On the 19th September the Meshed Nazmieh discovered a revolutionary organization called the “ Committee of Suroor ”. The members were all young Persains and the object of the society was stated to be to assist the working and depressed classes against the oppression of the Government. Forty-six members were arrested, but it is heard that all but four have since been released. It seems probable that this organization was under Soviet auspices, and that consequently sufficient money was forthcoming to open the prison doors. 4. Persian Officials. —Rukn-i-Azam Governor of Tmshiz has been dismissed from his post and Abdul Hussein Khan Ardalani sent to replace him. 5. Soviet Officials. —The Soviet Vice- Consul Kablunov at Daragaz, the Soviet H 'ad of the Wool Trust, two other Russians and two women were robbed by five bandits near Inchaha on the new j Kuchan-Lntfabad road on the 21st instant. Their goods and, their clothes were taken from them. The Soviet Consul General protested strongly to the acting Governor Asadi, who replied that they should not have been using this new road which was; not yet policed or open to the public. Action is being taken to capture the robbers. 6. Refugees.- (i) On the 15th instant 25 armed and mounted Turkomen came across the frontier at Hissar. They had been chased across by the Red troops. They were disarmed by the Military Commander at Lutfabad.* They stated that a large number of Turkomen had been killed or captured in the recent fighting and about 500 more refugees might be expected to cross the frontier in the Lutfabad area in the course of the next few days. (ii) A large number of Turkomen refu gees are reported to be coming in across the Jirgilan frontier. They are mostly armed. (iii) Six Russians crossing the frontier at Shapas Khan near Darajaz were fol lowed two miles into Persian territory by Oated 5 NOV 1331 j Received 23 NOV. 1931the Soviet frontier guard who succeeded in killing two of them. The remainder i escaped. (iv) Sixty Turkomen refugees arrived in Burj nurd town, they are being de tained pending a decision regarding their disposal. (v) At the end of July 500 Turkomen families c ossed the Afghan frontier from Kelif and Termez. The cause is said to have been an effort to aviod impress ment into the Kolboz farms. II.—CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS. 7. An individual who left Baisun (Tajikistan) on the 8th irstant reports as follows:— Garrison. —(i) Military. —Strength about 2,000 men, he can give no parti culars.

(iii) Landing ground. —A small landing ground for aircraft has been recently constructed to the north-east of Baisun. Buildings are under construction on this site. (iv) Barracks. —During the last three years considerable barracks have been constructed. The number of buildings is about 20. (v) Military Training. —It was an nounced on the 25th of September that man oeuvres would be held between Baisun and Dehnau. Supplies had been collected for this purpose and an advanc ed party had arrived from Termez before the informant left. (vi) Basmachi. —There were parties of Basmachi operating in August in the mountains round Baisun, especially near Darband, and Chashman Hafizan. Troops sent against them had not succeeded in rounding them up. 8 .

(ii) G. P. £7.—Com mander Bankovski. Strength 60. (iii) Conscription .—This has been re opened from the 1st September. About 25 recruits have been sent to Samar kand. (iv) Landing grounds.—There is a small landing ground near the railway station which is used by aeroplanes from Samarkand. There are no aeroplanes located at Jizak. (v) Volunteers .—A Battalion of Volun teers was raised nominally for despatch to the Chinese frontier, after formation it was sent to Samarkand. The person nel of this Battalion consists of various nationalities, Russians, Armenians, Per sians, etc. They served for food only, no pay is admissible. They were issued with uniforms only in Jizak. They J Were armed in Samarkand and sent off to an unknown destination. It is thought they were not sent to China but to the Persian frontier. (vi) Morale .—The morale of the troops is reported to be poor, most of them are discontented with their conditions of service. On the loth of September 12 men of the Cavalry Detachment de serted with their arms and horses and joined the Basmachi. (vii) Basmachi .—About six weeks ago the Basmachi raided Jizak killing the i Commandant of Militia and looting the Military clothing and ration stores. They succeeded in getting away with out being caught by the Military. There are other bands operating in the moun tains of Daldaltash and Timorlang and throughout the mountainous regions of Bokhara. The troops are not able to catch them since their spy system is very good. The informant reports that in conse quence of the Basmachi activity starva tion exists in Jizak. Skulls and remains of 16 humans beings were discovered in the prison at Jizak where unfortunate people had been allowed to starve to death. (viii) Gas training .—Training in Gas protection has been started by order from Moscow. All troops are required to carry out Gas drill twice a week. The regular garrison at Jizak go to Bagh-i- Shamal by train to carry out these parades. The civil inhabitants are also being instructed in this duty.

(i) Conscription .—It is reported that the quota of recruits required from Khorasan ii 8,700. The town of Meshed is to find 800. The announcement of conscription has caused considerable excitement and despondency, the town not having been called on to furnish recruits for the last five years. Many are making strenuous efforts to avoid being conscripted. There was a public ceremony held on the 8th to celebrate the opening of conscription at which various Military and Civil officials made suitable patriotic speeches. (ii) Military Schools .—A ceremony was held in the Military school of vakils of the Shahpur Regiment in Meshed to celebrate the results of the examination for vakils which was recently held. 67 students passed. They will con tinue their Military studies another year and those who qualify will subsequently be sent to Tehran and entered in the school for Naibs. (lii) Turlcomen in surrection .—Some trouble has been going on recently in the Turkoman district north west of Burjnurd and in northern Astarabad. The initial cause seems to have been treachery on the part of Some of the Persian Military Commanders, though it is officially given out to have been due to the resistance shown on the part of the Turkomen (Yamut) to the collection of taxes. It is probable that parties of Turkomen who have been driven across the frontier in the recent fighting with the Soviet forces in the Kizil Arvat district may have had something to do with it. One of the incidents was as follows, an influential and wealthy Turkoman Ana Gueldi migrated across from Soviet territory a considerable time ago and settled with his followers in the vicinity of Gumush Tepe north west of Astara bad. He and his followers possessed a certain quantity of arms which he was requested to surrender. This man refused to do, but through judicious presents and quiet behaviour soon got on good terms with the Persian Military authorities who dropped the matter. He frequently entertained the Persian officers, and was in turn entertained by them at Gumush Tepe. About three weeks ago he, together with some twenty of his followers, was invited to an entertainment by the Military Com- mandar of Gumush Tepe. On the • return journey his party was am bushel and practically exterminated by Persian troops who had been sent out for the purpose. This is reported to have been arranged by Sartip Akhmad Khan, Military Commander of Astarabad. The result has been an insurrection of the Yamut Turkomen of this neigh bourhood necessitating the despatch of troops from Meshed and Astarabad. Fighting is reported to have lasted for four days during which time the Turkomen are stated to have lost 15 killed and the Persian 8. The situation is reported to be now restored and tne Turkomen rebels have retreated across the border. (iv) Mutiny .—No further particulars have been received regarding the rumour, d trouble reported m Summary No. 18, paragraph 1 Military. It would seem the mutiny has been suppressed. A party of soldiers was 1 brought to Meshed under escort last ! week. It is thought that possibly they were arrested in this connection. (v) Soviet aeroplane over Persian j territory .—On the 3rd of October a i Soviet aeroplane flew over Persian terri tory for a distance of forty miles in the vicinity of Lutfabad. The Persian Government has registered a protest with the Soviet Government. 2 .—Persian officials. (i) Yavar Lutf Ali Khan Shuja Nizam, the Reis Nazmieh of Siestan has been appointed Governor in place of Samsun-ud-Dowlah who has been dis missed. (ii) Sarhang Iraj Khan who has been touring in the Burjnurd district for the last fortnight returned to Meshed on the 4th of October.(iii) Mahmud Jan, Governor General of Kborasan who recently left Meshed to accompany his son who was being sent to school in Europe returned to Tehran a few days ago. He may be expected back in a week’s time. 3 .—Soviet Central Asian Republics. (i) Heavy fighting between Soviet forces and Turkomen was reported in the neighbourhood of Askhabad on the 3rd instant by Persian frontier officials. It was stated that additional aircraft had been brought from Tashkent to assist in these operations. (ii) The trans-frontier road via Lutfa- bad w r as closed to all traffic between the 1st and 3rd October by orders of the Soviet frontier control posts. (iii) It is reported that the Turkomen suffered heavy casualties and many refugees are coming across into Persia. 25 arrived in Lutfabad on the 3rd. (iv) Four Turkoman leaders have been shot in Askhabad. (\) Turkoman villages 40 miles from Askhabad on the Merv road have been burnt by the Soviet forces. (vi) The body of an Officer killed in the fighting near Merv was brought to Askhabad at the beginning of the month and buried with Military honours. (vii) The following information was supplied by an individual who left Kelif on the 7th of October. He was resident there for eight years. (a) On the 25th of September an announcement was posted that all in dividuals between the age of 21 and 32 J must present themselves for registration at Military Headquarters with a view to selection for conscription on the 10th of October. Non compliance would be punished. (b) It seems that some scheme for the preparation of a bridge or large landing^ stage on the Oxus at Kelif is being con templated. The river here is narrower than at other points. During the last two months considerable quantities of timber, tin sheets, boards, etc., have been brought down the river and dumped on the bank. When the river was at its lowest about a month ago 300 artizans and earth- workers were employed in filling in holes in the river bed with stone, etc., as though to prepare the foundations for piers in places which were normally covered by the river. (c) At the beginning of September an Afghan frontier Commission carried out an inspection of the Afghan frontier guards in the Kelif vicinity. They sub sequently proceeded to Badakshan. (d) The informant confirms the sink ing of a Soviet river patrol boat by the Afghans three months ago, which had been reported from another source. The affair was referred to the Kabul Government. (e) A considerable quantity of merchandise for despatch to Afghanistan has collected in Kelif. It is held up there since the Afghans will not permit it to be imported notwithstanding the recently signed Soviet Afghan treaty. {f) Six weeks ago a band of Basmachi destroyed a G. P. U. Supply Depot at Jarkurgan, Killing^six of the staff. The raiders crossed into Afghanistan. HERAT. Nothing of interest to report. To L. G. W. HAMBER, Major, Secretary to H. B.

Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 20 for the period ending 29th October 1931. I.—Persian Affairs. 1. Military. 1. The situation in the Bujnurd area still remains obscure. It is confirmed that the mutiny of a part of the garrison has not been suppressed, and that about 100 mutineers are still opposing the Per sian forces in the mountains north of Bash Kala on the Soviet frontier. They have received assistance from across the border. The Yamut Turkomen are still in rebellion, their numbers are not accu rately known, though one source from that district estimates them at 1,200 armed men. Troops numbering it is said 700 from Tehran have been already despatched to the scene of the disturbance, in addition to another 300 from Meshed and others from Astarabad. Aeroplanes have also been sent to Gumbad-i-Kabus. There is little doubt that the rebel lion is receiving Soviet support. Its future success and the period of its dura tion appear to be a matter of the extent to which the Soviet are prepared to con tinue their help, since without this it could not last long. The whole Persian-Soviet frontier is now strongly patrolled by Soviet regular troops in addition to the G. P. U. Fron tier guards. This cordon however has probably been established in connection with the operations undertaken in Turkistan for the suppress ; on of the Turkoman revolt, with a view to stopping rebels seeking refuge in Persia. 2. 30,000 rounds of S. A. A. were sent from Meshed to Bujnurd on the 22nd of October and two additional machine guns on the 27th. 3. Sultan Mahmud Khan has been appointed Commander of the Infantry in Bujnurd in ’place of Sultan Abdulla Khan. He was educated in England. 4. The Finance and Accounts Section of the Persian Eastern Army has been abolished by order of the Ministry of War.

Economic. Ten tractors and ploughs were pur chased for the Birjand area from the “ Sharq ” Company, it U said by the Shaukut ul-Mulk. It is said that the Soviet are trying to make an arrangement with the Persian Government for the exchange of the entire wheat and barley crop of the State owned lands in Khorasan for agricultural machinery. A special representatives from Moscow has left Meshed for Tehran this connection. The Persian Gov- m ernment are said proposal. to be con idering the 3. Persian Officials. Mahmud Jam, Governor General of Khorasan returned to Meshed from Tehran on the 20th of October. He has received sanction for the following public works during his visit to the capital:— (i) The reconstruction of the tomb of Omar Khayam at Nisha- pur. (ii) The completion of the scheme for new lavenues in the town of Meshed. (iii) The construction of a motor road from Lutfabad to Kuchan via Ima Quli. (iv) The repair of the following roads, Meshed to Kariz (Herat road) and Meshed- Zahidan- Ansari, Persian Consul in Herat, arrived in Meshed on the 27th instant for medical treatment.4. Refugees. II. Soviet Central Asian Republics. (i) 13 Turkoman families crossed the frontier at Khaaka on the 15th of Octo ber. {ii) 39 families who arrived via Lutf- abad are to be settled in the Meshed area. (Hi) 18 families tried to cross the frontier near Khaaka on the 18th Octo ber but were captured by the Soviet frontier guards and taken them under escort to Askhabad. 25 more tried to cross near the same place on the 19th and after a fight on the frontier 9 of them succeeded in crossing, the remain der scattered in the desert. (iv) Four Russians crossed near Shams Khan on the loth October, they are under airest in Kuchan. 5. Soviet activity. It is reported that the Russian Bank has instructed its brokers to purchase 15,000 rupees in the bazaar. They have up to date only been able to get Rs. 3,000 at a very unfavourable rate. It is said this money is to be sent to India through various Sikh firms, a most probable con tingency. 6. Contraband. (i) The Customs Officer at Kaltar Chinar confiscated 15 camel loads of loaf sugar which was being smuggled from Russia into Persia. (ii) A large quantity of opium is being smuggled into Persia from Afghanistan, chiefly into the Birjand district. (in) Sheep in numbers are smuggled into Russia especially in the Gifan area. (iv) 18 Kurds were brought under military escort from Mana in the Buj- nurd area on the 15th instant. They were all smugglers. 7. General. Two Soviet aeroplanes flew along the Persian frontier in the vicinity of Sarakhs on the morning of IGth Octo ber. 8. Frontier posts. 1. The G. P. U. frontier posts have been supplemented by regular troops and intermediate piquets have been placed on all tracks and roads practically from Sarakhs to the Caspian. The following is the official Persian estimate of the present strength of some of the posts, which are confirmed in cer tain instances by other sources :— Sarakhs (Russian) . Khaaka .... Lutfabad frontier . Bajgiran frontier Gifan .... Turkoman district frontier Jargilan). . 100 men. . 500 „ . 100 „ . 150 „ . 100 „ 350 (East of 2. The following particulars are from Turkoman sources regarding the Sarakhs frontier. They may be accepted as fairly accurate. At Chacha (on the frontier due south of Tejend) 250 men Ak Kala 210 men. A new post is established at Kel li ous between Chacha and Yas Tepe. Telephone lines have been constructed to connect up these posts. The soldiers are said to be of the 3rd Regiment which is now at Tejend (Presumbly the 3rd Turkistan Mountain Rifle Regiment). 9. Turkoman Rebellion. 1. Persian Military sources report that they are of the opinion that the Turko man rising in Turkistan has been practi cally quelled. It certainly appears that to have died down in many parts of Turkistan. 2. It is reported that the Soviet aero planes have been dropping leaflets on Turkoman villages inviting them to come to terms. 10. Krasnovodsk. An individual who left Krasnovodsk on the 5th of October reports as follows :— (i) Garrison .—About 300 men, half mountnd and half dismounted. (No identifications).(ii) G. P. U. Strength 150. They are distributed in posts astriae the Khiva Krasnovodsk desert road to prevent incursions on the part of the Yamut Tuikomen. (iii) Conscription .—This has been started from the 10th of October in the Krasnovodsk district. All men between the ages of 21 and 31 are liable for service. (iv) Armament .—There are reported to be four guns located in Krasnovodsk, one of large calibre and three field guns. There is an artillery detachment. There is also an armoured launch which controls smuggling along the coast as far as Gumush Tepe. (v) Water supply .— The distilling station was set on fire by incendiaries at the beginning of September. The cul prits have not been caught. The result is great shortage of water which is brought from Jabal by train. 11.— Dchnau. An individual who left Djhnau on the II th of October reports as follows :— (i) Garrison — 2 Companies of Infantry, from the 9th Regiment.* (About 250 men). 100 cavalry from Regiment No. 81. (ii) G. P. 13. strength 80, 50 mounted remainder dismounted. Distributed in the post in the Dehnau area. (iii) Conscription .—This has been started from the 10th of October, men between 21 and 31 are enlisted and sent to Dushambe, and later on to Tashkent. Mohammadans are avoiding conscription by joining the Basmachi or crossing into Afghanistan. (iv) Wireless .—This is at the G. P. U. Headquarters. (vi) Troop movement .—On the 15th of September four boats towing barges full of troops arrived from Baku and after a day’s halt were sent up the line in the direction of Askabad. There were about 1,000 infantry and 500 cavalry. They occupied three troop trains each of about 30 wagons. It was stated that these troops had come from Caucasus where there had been some rising which had now been put down, leaving them free for employ ment in Turkistan. (vii) At the beginning of September two boat loads of prisoner! from the Caucasus arrived in Krasnovodsk. They were sent up to A.-kabad, before this load of women and children, d( pendents of the rebels arrived. They were also sent up country. (viii) Strikes .—The workers at the oil wells of Cheleken and Mulla Kara have been on strike four times durmg Septem ber on account of lack of payment and shortage of food and clothing. (ix) Basmachi .—Fighting continues in the vicinity of Bala Ishem and Achman between Soviet troops and the Basmachi. On the 28th of September an aeroplane was shot down by the rebels. (This is ( mentioned by another independant source). (v) Collectivization .—This has been en* forced universally throughout Tajikistan from the 1st of October. It is extremely unpopular. Collectivized inhabitants are not permitted to store food of any kind or even cook in their own houses. Searches are carried out to enforce this. Rations are entirely to be supplied by the Government. (vi) Basmachi .—Basmachi have been active in Baljiwan. At the beginning of September they occupied Kulyab but were severely defeated on the 10th of September and retired towards Afghanis tan. ( vii) Troop movements .—Since the beginning of October two troop trains a week have been passing through Dehuau in the direction of Dushambe. These troops are better equipped and have newer uniforms than other units in Turkistan. They were mostly mounted Units and are said to have come from Russia. (viii) Trains run fiom Tarmez to Dushambe three times a week. Troop trains at any time. The informant saw a troop train leave Samsonovo for Tarmez as he was leaving the country, another at Kagan and another at Tejend. *( Possibly detachments of the 9th Turkistan Mountain Rifle Regiment.)4 (It seems possible that the practice of HI. —Herat. quartering troops in railway trains when operating along the railway might Nothing of interest to report, account for some of these!.

A further 350 troops arrived from Tehran since the time of writing the last Summary, also another aeroplane. The mutineers have leceived considerable reinforcements from Soviet territory. Persian sources reported them to reach a total of about 750 men, not including the original mutineers. The Yamut Turkomans are stated to have more or less given up opposition to the Persian forces, instructions have been issued to treat those who surrender with clemency after they have been disarmed. A four days operation was undertaken against the mutineers on the 30oh/31st of October till the 2nd of Now mbor. The Persians are reported to have diiven back the mutineers into the hills, though they suffered casualties to the extent of 20 killed and many wounded in the process. The rebels who were armed with two machine guns by the Soviet, are stated to have suffered heavy casualties. Vakil Bashi Ali Reza Khan their leader being wounded. A Naib Sarhang (Lt.-Colonel) Ali Reza Khan was also wounded and arrived in Meshed on the 3rd of Nov ember. After the action Persian sources re ported that the numbers of the muti neers appeared to have decreased, and that it was rumoured that the Soviet had decided not to afford them any further assistance. It was therefore anticipated that the trouble would be cleared up in a week. Information however, has been receiv ed on the 10th of November that the rebels who are now stated to number about 450 have entrenched themselves in the Ihills (presumably to the north of Gumbad-i Kabus), and are being rationed from Soviet territory, their morale has improved and it would seem that they expect reinforcements. Information from an independent source from Askhabad dated the 4th November states that it has been decided to render further assistance to the rebel lion, and that a detachment numbering 2,000 Persians, Armenians and Ca ucasians has been despatched for this purpose. They are dressed in Turkoman costume. Events during the next few days will confirm whether this information is true or false. 2. Lulfabad .—Another flagrant inst ance of Soviet invasion of Peisian terri tory occurred on the 31st of October and the 1st of November at the village of Gaukhandan, 8 miles in Persian terri tory between Lutfabad and Mohammad- abad. Considerable numbers of Turkoman refugees have been crossing into Persia on this part of the frontier. 25 families which had come across some dayi before were quartered in the sarai of this village under Persian Military guard, when suddenly on the 31st a party of about 200 regular soldiers of the Red army entered the village killing many of the Turkomans and carrying off others into Soviet territory. An engagement took pi ice between the Persian guard and the Russians resulting in 5 Soviet and 7 Persian soldiers being killed. Duiing the raid the village of Kila Mir was also looted. It is established the Soviet came from Artik via Zarrin Kuh. troops At 8 a.m. the next morning the village was again raided by 18 Turkomans of the G. P. U and another two refugees were killed and two more taken off to^the frontier where they wer 3 shot. The Persian Government has protested to Moscow, and a full enquiry has been ordered. This is being carried out by Sultan Bayuk Khan, Commander of the troops at Lutfabad. There is little doubt that many Persian frontier officials and even Military officers are in the payment of the G. P. U. and the raid had consider able assistance from the Persian side of the border. 3. The Commander of troops at Khaf and Burjnurd who came to Meshed for the Race meeting of the Eastern Army on the 2nd of November have returned &lt; ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SF' ' ^’S ’''V 2 Sarhang Akhmad Khan, Persian Military Attache at Kabul has come to Meshed on leave. 4. The following suggestions put up by the Officer Commanding troops Burjnurd (Yavar Ali Keza Khan) to the Shah have been approved :— (i) To increase the garrison along the Soviet frontier in the Tarkoman country. (ii) To maintain Military detach ments in the Goklan and Yamut areas. (iii) To purchase three lorries for cases of military emergency. (iv*) That the Burjnurd Regiment should be composed of recruits from all districts of Khorasan and not only of local inhabitants. 5. Econotnic.—Thz Soviet-Persian Commercnd treaty has at last been signed on the 27th of October. It is stated that the Trade Monopoly Laws of both contracting parties are to be recognised. Lists of goods sanctioned by this agreement together with the annual maximum value authorised in each case have been prepared. Sugar and Matches however have been reserved as a monopoly of the Persian Government. This would appear to be a serious blow to Russian exports which comprised a very large quantity of both these articles,’* It is perfectly certain that the Persian Government is not in a position to meet the requirements of their country in either of these commodities, however it is an ill vind that blow r s nobody any good and the Frontier Customs Officials will reap a rich harvest from authorised smugglers of these goods. The fact that the inhabitants of Persia will suffer from shortage and increased prices of these necessities is the last factor to receive official consideration. A circular has been issed to Gover nors of Provinces to effect that m rchants are forbidden to trade in any articles prohibited by the Monopoly Law. This order will no doubt be turned to profitable account by the officials con cerned by pe: mitting certain privileged merchants to carry on trading in a small way in forbidden merchandise. 6. Cotton crop. —The cotton crop has not been good in Khorasan this year. 7. Persian Officials. —Asadi, the Head of the Shrine of Imam Reza, has left for Gumbad-i Kabus in the Astarabad area. It is rumoured that this journey is in 0 connection with a proposed visit by the Shah to this area, where presumably he will obtain first hand knowledge of the trouble in the Burjnurd, Astarabad districts. The Shah is at present tour ing in Mazanderan. 8. Soviet activities .—The Head of the Khlopkom (Soviet Cotton Industries), together with five Russians has left Meshed for Sabzewar. The Mesheh Rajs-i-Nazmieh suspects they have really gone to organize propaganda, and has telegraphed to the local police to keep a close watch on their movements. 9. Soviet Officials .—New Secretary to the Soviet Consulate, Meshed, has arriv- / ed. His name is Lazarchenko, a Ukrainian. He takes up the post of first Secretary which has now been vacated by Degtyarig, who has been appointed “ Director ” (Upravlyauschi). It seems probable that no Consul General will be appointed in place of Skaloff, and the existing arrangement will remain in action for an indefinite period. Conversation with D gtyarig on the occasion of the celebration of the 14th anniversary of the Revolution elicited the information that it is not Soviet policy to retain a regular Consular service, and that any official may be sent to hold an} 7 suitable post either inside or outside the frontiers of the U. S. S. R. (ii) Danilov, the Head of the Sharq, was at the above entertainment. He is the chief of the local G. P. U. and evil looking pock marked Ciimmal with, it is said, several murders to his credit. An Armenian, speaks French and a little English stated to me he was in England for eight months in 1912. He is the shepherd of the political conduct of Soviet officials in Meshed, and one gathers the impression he is hated and feared by them. 10. Refugees. —(i) Report from Daragaz, dated the 27th of October 30 Turkomans from Tejend fought an action with Soviet frontier guards near Artik, and having incurred some casual ties entered Persian territory via S&amp;fa Kula and Zarrin Kuh. They were disarmed by the Penian Military Commander of Liitfabad Sultan3 [ Bayuk Khan who took from them 14 carpets and a precious stone which they had brought with them. (ii) One hundred and eighty Persian subjects resident in Soviet Russia were sent across the frontier at Daragaz on the 9th of November. They were said to have refused to work in the Kolhoz farms. They were practically naked and half starved. II.—SOVIET CENTRAL ASIAN REPUBLICS. 11. Baswachi. —(i) There is little doubt that the rebellion in Turkistan has been more or less suppressed. This does not mean that further incidents will not occur, but at the moment the Soviet forces have scattered the greater part of the rebel groups into the desert. The movement, however, is likely to continue in the more inacessible and mountainous districts. (ii) The following information is from an individual resident in Andijan who left that place on the 18th of October:— Garrison. Commander—Somanski. Infantry—800. Cavalry—220. Artillery—One Battery. Note.—S ome attempts at identifications were given which are obviously wrong. G. P. U. 180 men. Commandant Yousof (A Jew). 12. Co?iscription. —Men from 21 to 31 years of age have been called up from the 10th of October. (Confirms pre vious information). It is stated that men enrolled in the year 1921-22 have been called up from the 1st of Novem ber ? (For reservist training). 13. Aerodrome. —This is located near the station. Two buildings have recent ly been erected on it. Postal aeroplanes run regularly between Andijan and Tashkent. 14. Supply Depot. —There is a supply Depot in Andijan. Commandant Ver- deef. 15. Vzgend. —This town is being transformed into a large Military station. About 5,000 troops of all arms are located there. 16. Communications. —Shortly before the departure of the informant a large number of labourers were taken from Andijan to Uzgend for the construction of a metalled road between Uzgend and Yangi Hissar in Chinese Turkistan. Note ,.—This seems an improbable destination though it may indicate further road construction up to the Chinese frontier, perhaps towards Irkistam. 17. Persian Refugees. —20 Persian Military refugees including 8 Persian conscripts in the Red army were sent to Askhabad at the beginning of October. Note. —These probably were mobilized in connection with the Soviet assistance to the re bellion in the Burjnurd district of Eastern Persia. 1$. Basmac i. —These still operate in small parties in the mountains. 12 Mohammadan soldiers deserted and joined them during October. The en forcement of Conscription has also led to an increase in their numbers. III.—HERAT. 19. The Persian Military Attache from Kabul who arrived in Meshed ten days ago reported this province to be very quiet. It seems that Salar Jang Abdul Rahim has lost much of his independ ence and obeys the instructions of Kabul more readily than formerly. 20. Some' Trade. —In Herat city Soviet trade is paramount. L.

Burjnurd Rebellion. —The situation in this district seems now to be settled. It is very improbable that there will be any further trouble at any rate durirg the winter. A reinforcement of about 100 men dressed in Turkoman custume joined the rebels about the 12th or 14th of November. It seems that the reported detachment of 2,000 Volunteers raised in Askhabad has not materialized other than as above mentioned. Two or three small skirmishes took place during the first ten days of Novem ber and on the 16th and 17th major operations were undertaken by the Persian troops against the rebels. In a two days’ battle in which both sides are stated to have suffered heavy casualties the rebels were driven back across the Soviet frontier and the band seems to have been finally broken up. The troops from Tehran and Astarabad have been withdrawn, but the detach ment from Meshed is remaining for the present in the Burjnurd District. 2. Trouble in Arabistan. —Unconfirm ed information dated the 2nd December reports a rising among Arabs who are Persian subjects. The locality is not known but thought to be in Arabistan. It is said that the detachment from Tehran which was withdrawn from Gumbad-i-Kabus has been moved to south-west Persia and that a wire has been received in Meshed demanding the despatch of a contingent from there also. Further particulars are awaited. 3. Troop movements. —The Lutfabad garrison was reinforced by 20 Cavalry sowars on the 22nd November, and the Bajgiran garrison by 15 on the 30th. 50 Infantry were sent from Meshed to Kuchan in lorries on the 24th November to strengthen the garrison there. 4. Conscription. —Conscription has been started in Sabzewar from the 20th November. Many complaints have been received against the Conscription Officers in Turbat-i-Haidari.

He has also protested to the Governor General. Sultan Mahmud Khan, Commanding the Infantry at Bnrjnurd has come to Meshod to complain against Sarhang Ali Reza Khan, the Officer Commanding troops. Yavar Akhmad Khan Tahir Nia has been appointed Adjutant of the troops in Meshed. 6. Communications. —The road from Neshapore to Sabzewar which was damaged for a distance of 80 Kilometers b y recent heavy rains and is being repaired. 7. Persian Officials. —Asadi, the head of the Meshed Shrine returned from Tehran on the 28th November. Aun Jazari-ul-Sultaneh, Assistant Governor of Meshed died suddenly on the 23rd of November. The Bolsheviks lost a good worker. ^ 8. Foreigners. —The Turkish Minister in Kabul left for Meshed on the 2nd of November via Kandahar and Herat. It is not known if he has arrived yet. He is said to be returning to Kabul via India. Professor Masse, a French Archaeologist is at present staying in Meshed. 9. Soviet Activities. —(i) Four Russians of the Khlopkom (Cotton Industries) who recently went to Subzewar ostensibly to buy cotton have been engaging in pro paganda. The Police have ordered three of them to return to Meshed forth with. (ii) In connection with the 14th anni versary of the revolution the Soviet Government informed the Persian Gov ernment that all prisoners in the Soviet Jails who are Persian subjects were to be released the number is about 1,000 some of them have already reached Persia. (Hi) On the night of the 25th/26th of November the Sharq Company burnt down their premises, one of the largest buildings in Meshed the property of Nasirbegcff (A wealthy Persian mer chant who deserved a better V a te sincehe had always worked well for the Bolsheviks). The loss is estimated ab Tomans 20,000. All their documents and accounts were unfortunately destroyed, they saved however their furniture including a grand piano. Their goods had been very fortunately moved to some new premises across the road two days previously. The fact that an Audit Commission was due to arrive from Askhabad has, one must assume no connection with this affair. 10. Economic .—Owing to incomplete information only being available regard ing the conditions of the Persian-Soviet trade agreement incorrect particulars were given in the last Summary No. 21, paragraph 5, where it was stated that the Persian Government had reserved for themselves the monopoly of the supply of Sugar and Matches. They have only reserved the selling monopoly of these articles in Persia. The Soviet Government has obtained the absolute monopoly for the import of these articles. 11. Refugees .—Twenty Turkoman re fugees crossed the frontier at Lutfabad on the 15th of November and another 9 reached Kuchan on the 26th. 12. General .—Compulsory vaccination is being instituted in Meshed. 16 Vacci nators are at work amongst the poor children in the town. II.— Soviet Central Asian Republics. 13. Basmachi—Tte rebellion in Turkistan has been put down with the greatest severity. Intensive Air action against the families of the Turkomans considered to have taken part in the rebellion, has finally crushed the rising. The casualties sustained among the women and children are very heavy. In the Merv-Tejend district alone these exceed 1,000 killed. The open nature of the terrain facilitated air action and the Auls were subjected to concen trated machine gun fire from low flying aircraft, groups which scattered were persued and shot down. An eye witness states that the planes flew so low that the buttons of the avaitors could be dis tinguished. At the present time wholesale deporta tions of the families of Turkomans from the neighbourhood of M^rv, Charjui and elsewhere are being undertaken. Motor convoys remove the entire population of the Auls and take them to the towns. The sarais at Merv are packed with Turkomans and their families under guard. These are sent off by train to unknown destinations. It is said to th|^ Solevetski camp or Siberia. It seems to be the determination of the So viet Authorities to make a no man’s land of the territory between the railway and the Persian and Afghan frontiers. 14.

(iii) Conscription .—This is being carried on in Kushk. Conscripts from the country round are brought to Kushk and Takhta Bazaar and subsequently sent to Charjui. (iv) Communications .—There are two wireless sets, one Military and the other for the G. P. U. There is in addition a large wireless station which dates from the Czarist times. The informant reports that there are several sets of wireless telephones which are used by the Military during manoeuvres and for communicadon with aircraft. One military areoplane arrived in Kushk from Tashkent shortly before the informant left. It carried out daily reconnaissance flights. (v) Fortifications. —Kushk is well fortified. It is surrounded by walls on three sides whilst the forth is closed by a perimeter consisting of six fortified post connected by a continuous barbed wire entanglement. These strong points are joined up by an underground passage and telephones. At intervals in the passages are raised emplacements for machine guns. These six posts have names of which the informant can only remember three ; Baluch post, Poltaratsk post and Alexander post. These posts and thedefences have recently been put into a good state of repair. There are also outlaying earthworks. A gun emplacement is also being re pared on the hills above Kushk. (vi) Water supply .—Water is brought into the town and fort by karezes from the hills. There is a large reservoir inside the perimeter from which a piped supply distributes water to all the barracks etc. (vi) Lighting .—The fort, town and perimeter are lit by electricity. (vii) Aerodrome .—This is located near Balasar fort. A building is being erected on this site. (viii) Station .—One verst from the fort. A siding runs into the town. It is said that there is an underground assage to the station from the fort uilt in Czarist times. Three fresh sidings are being made at .the station, 2,000 men are at present employed on earthwork. (ix) Stores .—Large stores are main tained, these include wheat, barley and lucerne. III. —Herat. The following information was supplied by an individual who left Herat on the 8th November. 15. Garrison. — (i) Infantry. —Two units the strength of which are 600 and 800 respectively. They are called the “ Khaka ” and the “ Kandhar ” Regi ments. (ii) Cavalry. —Pour (?) squadrons, strength 100 each located as follows :— Herat 2 Squadrons, Opposite Kariz on the Persian frontier 1 squadron. Opposite Kushk 1 squadron. There are also two troops of reserve cavalry. (iii) Artillery. —Two Batteries. (iv) Armament. —The troops are armed with various types of rifles. One unit with British, one with Russian, one with German and one with Afghan made rifles, etc. 16. Aerodrome. —This is located 2 miles from the town. There is a store building on the site and guard is main tained. Occasionally aeroplanes land from Kabul. 17. Sale of Arms. —There is no restric tion on the sale of arms or ammunition. Rifles are sold openly in the bazaars. Nearly all the inhabitants are armed. The following is the price of rifles :— tomans. Rs. English Magazine Rifle with 100 rounds . . . 200 (400) Russian Magazine Rifle with 100 rounds . . . 150 (300) 18. Junaid'.Khan. —Junaid Khan and his followers are living in Herat. They have not been disarmed and are behav ing themselves peaceably. 19. Soviet Consulate. —This is located outside the town. The Soviet is regard ed with extreme suspicion. Afghan merchants wishing to purchase Russian goods have to obtain official permission to visit the Soviet Consulate, which is guarded by Afghan troops. An individual who disobeyed these orders recently was nailed by the ear to the wall of the market place for four days as a punishment. 20. Soviet Trade. —Russian merchan dise fills the bazaars in Herat. British goods are not able to compete in this market on account of the cost of trans port. Russian goods are brought by motor to Kara Teppe on the frontier and thence by camel caravan to Herat. The Soviet Consul is reported to arrange for the sale of foreign currency, pounds, dollars and rupees at very cheap rates. The town is said to be full of foreign paper money. I am informed that pound notes can be bought for Krans 25 (Rs. 4*8-0) if obtained in a quiet manner. There seems little doubt that this currency is Soviet forged and disposed of in [this mariner. It is said these notes are sent through to India via Chaman. 21. Naib Salar Abdnr Bahim. —The present ruler of the Herat province is popular 'and respected. He does not seem to have lost local prestige by sub mission to the Kabul Government. Politically he is a good Afghan ex tremely suspicious of foreigners regardless of nation. He definitely dislikes the Russians and gives them very little freedom of movement. L. G. W. HAMBER, Major, Secretary to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed.

This is the final number of accepted recruits from Meshed of this number 220 have been retained and the remainder sent back to their homes with instructions that they are liable for service if re quired. It seems donbtful if there is • sufficient equipment for more than'ffieT*” number now retained. 3. Soviet activities. —(i) The Cqptrol Commission whose impending arrival, might possibly have been connected with the recent burning of the local premises . of the Sharq Company (Summary 22/9, iii) duly arrived in Meshed and after an enquiry proceeded to Tehran. (ii) The new Soviet Consul General arrived in Meshed a few days ago. He called on H. B. M.’s Consul General on the 28th instant. His name is Solomon Lazarevitch Borisov. A portly Hebrew who has already been employed in Persia a year or two ago in the Soviet Department of Commerce. He has travelled extensively in Persia also in China. He speaks some Engl sh. He has brought with him an official, it is believed a Vice-Consul, to reheve Degtyarig who will leave shortly. His name has not yet been ascertained. He is by appearance also a Jew. (iii) Hussein Aga Kashanski, a Per sian formerly an Attache at the Soviet Consulate General, Meshed has returned after a'long absence. He is reported to be seeking re-employment. (iv) A persistent bazaar rumour pre vails that the Soviet intends to import a large number of motors in the near future which will sell at dumping price. It is said they are Pords. Further en quiries are being ma&lt;jle, 4. Communications. —Considerable re cent construction has taken place on the Meshed-Tehran road via Sabzewar and Damgan. Russian Engineers have been incharge of the work which has been really well done in several places.

Infantry . . . 1,000 - G. P. V. about 60. Commandant Speen. 6. Conscription.—This is in force throughout Kazakistan. Recruits are sent to Alma Ata. 7. Administrative —Perovsk was the capital of Kazakistan until 1927 when the seat of Government was moved to Alma Ata. One of the chief causes was the extreme dampness of Perovsk which has caused great damage to all the Gov ernment buildings and barracks. 8. General. —Christmas day was to be celebrated by the blowing up of all churches which were not being used as public buildings in order to prevent any celebrations on that day. Electoral Reform. —The new franchise scheme in which peasants are only to be represented in the Republic and Central Soviets on a basis of village represen f a- tion as opposed to actual population has caused widespread discontent. It is argued that the workers in the towns who are assessed on a population basis will have quite disproportionate representation in camparison with the peasants who will not have more than one member per 50,000. The Kolkhoz workers are threatening to strike if this reforms is put into effect.i - 2 . i ’ ^ t/ !. 10 Aerodromes —l\) There is an ex- 12.

U. is collecting a sum of money from all workers for the con struction of a gigantic statue of Lenin to be erected on the sea shore at Kronstadt. (iv) There have been extensive changes in the staff of the G. P. U. throughout Turkistan. (This is confirmed from other sources). It seems that the action of many officials of the G. P. U. during the recent Turkistan rebellion was not consi dered satisfactory. 11. Military. —An informant who left Kerki on the 27th of November reports as follows:— Garrison .— Infantry .. 1,200.

All the Agents are orientals with a thorough knowledge of the Afghan language. 19 Collectivization— Is in for ce throughout the Kerki district. Cotton is grown. 20. General.—Tbo Oxus has been very low recently. Steamers cannot reach Kerki from Charjui, in places the river can even be forded.

There is also a considerable civilian population. 12 schools and 2 hospitals.

Aerodrome — is extensive and located 2 versts from Yangi Bizaar. There are two buildings on the aerodrome and a wireless and searchlight. 16. Railway Station. — I his is located near the village of Khwaja Mansur 4 versts from Dushmnbe. There is an iron bridge o ver the ri ver between Dushambe and Yangi Bazaar and another one over the Kafirnigan river. L. ^^ stianc!e between Dushambe and •Yangi.-Bazaar is 21 versts. 17.

Work was abandoned on the 20th of December for the winter but the line should be working throughout its length in the spring. 18.

The inform ation given therein is confirmed. 3. Soviet activity. —There has been increased activity on the part of the Persian authorities in Khorasan in round- ing up individuals suspected of espionage and pro-Soviet leanings during the last month. It seems possible that the increasing feeling of dissatisfaction at the terms of Soviet Persian trade agreement which is openly voiced in most Persian circles may have acted as a spur in this connec tion. The following incidents, in themselves small, give an indication of present conditions :— (i) Two Kurds, Mamao and Shah Verdi have been arrested in Lutfabad on the charge of being G. P. U. spies. They have been sent under escort to Meshed. (ii) Hasan Ali and Iskandar, Per sian subject who arrived from - Adkbarbad recently have been *. iHsr Delta 17 MAK.1932 Received 4 APR. 195^ arrested for visiting the Soviet Consulate.

The remain der will probably be released. (iv) Several Caucasian Turks re sident for varying periods in Meshed have received orders to leave Persia on account of their Soviet connections. (Caucasian Turks are most frequently employed in this country by the Komintern for their propaganda work since they easily pass as Persians). (v) Ali Mohammedov, a notorious G. P. U. Agent was recently arrested, orders have been received from Tehran that he should be imprisoned for life. (He was frequently employed by the Sharq Company). (vi) Said Abdul Hussein, formerly editor of the newspaper “ Raushan ” of Meshed who was arrested leaving the Soviet Consulate two months ago, and was found to be in prossession cf Bolshevik literature, was sent to Tehran under arrest where it is re ported he has been murdered. 4.

Trenches and dugouts have been dug. Training is carried out once a week. Troops divide into two parties, one side putting down the gas cloud and the other renelliiig the attack. After the attack the troops are practised in clearing the gas infected area with pumps and spra)s. The informant has witnessed this train ing on several occasions. He states that the gas clearing apparatus consists of port able cylinders with pump attachments. 13. Uzkend .—The informant states that the 'arrison of this town has recentl) been increased and that there have been troop movements towards the Chinese frontier of Sinkiang. One or two troop trams a week have been passing through Kokand from Chernayev in the direction of Andijan. 14. Requisitions. —G. P. TT. troops ha\e recently been engaged in confiscating horses, carts and bicycles for Military purposes. 15. Rations .—In the bakery (where the informant worked), reserves of Army biscuits are being prepared. There is a scarcity of bread in Uzbegis- tan Government servants who formerly received fixed rations have had them re duced by about 25%. This also applies the troops. L6. Railway Communication.—The^ line bween Chernayev and Kokand is being 3 aired, considerable labour is being em- wed on this work. Passenger trains run ilv. Postal trains twice a week, Iroop d* goods trains at irregular intervals. 17. Samarkand .—An individual resident metime in Samarkand who left that town the 22nd of February reports as [lows : 18. Garrison .—The principle garrison Samarkand is located at Pyanjkent out 50 versts from Samarkand and con- cted to it by rail. A mission to Pyanj- nt is only permissible on a pass issued the Military Authorities. According to the informant Pyanjkent central Military Station of Uzbegistan. The strength of the garrison at Pyanj kent is given as 8,000 of all arms. That of Samarkand as : 2 Companies of Infantry of Regimei^ No. 9 (? 9th T. M. R. Regimenv a possibility). 1 Squadron of Cavalry l No iderltifica . 1 Battery / tion3 - These troops are located in the fort which is situated between the Old and New cities. 19. Conscription. —This has been finish ed for the year. It will start again from the beginning of 1932. The informant also states that women have been enrolled in numbers and sent to Tashkent under their own officers. He gives the number as 500 (probably an exaggeration). These women are said to include Armenians, Mohammedans and others. 20. G. P. About 300 all ranks. 21. Inspection. —On the 20th of Febru ary 3 senior officers from Moscow carried out an inspection of the Samarkand gar rison and on the 25th of the Pyanjkent garrison. In the latter place manoeuvres were arranged. They afterwards left in the direction of Termez. 22. Clothing and hoot factories.—WL&amp;ny factories exist in Samarkand for the pro duction of these articles. They are said to be working overtime to supply troops in Uzbegistan awaiting orders. {Comment. This sentence is not quite clear, it might mean that they are under orders to move at short notice.) 23. General. —This informant confirms the enforced requisition of wheeled trans port, bicycles, and animals reported by the other source in paragraph 14 above. A large number of horses have been collected in the vicinity of Samarkand. 24. Aerodrome. —This is extensive and lo 3 ated on the side of Samarkand towards Zarafshan. There are a few buildings on it. Postal planes alight there regularly. 25. Aerial Manoeuvres. —It was an nounced on the 20th February that there would be aerial manoeuvres on the 28th when the release of gas from aeroplanes was to be tested. All inhabitants were warned to close their doors and windows and remain in their houses during the manoeuvres. 26. Morale. —The soldiers are stated to be discontented with the Government but afraid of the political control and do not express their opinions openly. The conditions of the troops have been improved this last year with regard to rations and clothing. 27. Basmachi .—These raided the G. P. U. »nd State institutions at Balghar (4 versts ®rom Pyanjkent) early in February, burnt the offices and removed a lot of stores. In other respects Basmachi activity has subsided during the winter. 28. Comment .—Though it may be en tirely a false conclusion reading between the lines of these reports which are both by Persians, it seems that events in the Far East have disturbed the equanimity of the Bolsheviks and frightened them to the extent of putting certain units into a state of readiness to move at short notice, and caused them to collect transport and in tensify production of certain Military requirements, such as clothing, boots, bis cuits, etc., against future eventualities.

Communications .—Heavy rain during the past month has caused extensive da mage to the roads in many parts of Kho rasan and Kain. The British Consul, Zabul, reported that the road from Zabul to Bir- jand is impassable for wheeled traffic and has requested the British Consul-General, Meshed, to approach the local authorities with an urgent request for repairs. Repairs have been undertaken on road Meshed, Kuchan, Shirvan, but in view of the fact that only four days ago a spate ■overturned a car drowning one of the pas sengers, on this section it seems improbable that any work can be put in hand until the weather improves. 2. Soviet Activity. —Three Kurds have been arrested as spies in the Daragaz dist rict. They had been supplying the G. P. U. Kommendatura in Artik with informa tion concerning the Persian frontier guards and institutions near Daragaz. The Soviet Consul-General has been com plaining to the Governor General and the Amir Lashkar about the conduct of some of the frontier Commanders, notably Sultan Bayuk Khan of Lutfabad, The Amir Lashkar has taken offence at this and reported the action of the Soviet Consul- General to the Shah. IT. Central Asian Soviet Republics. Charjui .—An individual who left Charjui on the 12th March reports as follows :— 3. Garrison .— Infantry Cavalry Artillery River floatilla .. 600') .. 200 f No identifi .. 200 [ cations. .. 500J armed steamers, 4 with guns and machine guns the remainder with machine guns only.

Communication between Charjui and Petro- Alexandrovsk was resumed in March. 5. Postal Air Service. —This is maintained twice a week between Charjui and Kerki and three times a week between Charjui and Petro-Alexandrovsk. An extensive aerodrome exists at Charjui with accommodation, wireless and a search light. There is a Military guard. 6. Protection of Bridge. —From a des cription given by the informant it seems that the bridge may have possibly been electrified for protection at night. An en gine and presumably dynamo is located on the river bank beneath the bridge and a line has been laid along the bridge from this plant. He states that this is for the protection of the bridge and for working alarm signals. 7. Refugees. —Since the beginning of the year about 1,000 Turkoman families have crossed the frontier into Afghanistan from the Charjui district. In many instances parties of Turkomans who have already crossed the frontier return to guide their familes across and in this manner avoid the frontier guards and special detachments who are sent out to intercept them. It is stated that some of the military Units in Charjui are due to be relieved in March by others from Samarkand, and that Mohammedan troops are being sent out of Turkistan towards the Sinkiang frontier being replaced by Russians. Note. —This may be the case as a precautionary measure against a recurrence of trouble in Turkistan in the coming summer. A large amount of labour is being employ ed in the repair of the road Charjui-Askha- bad. Andijan. —An individual who left Andijan on the 3rd of March reports as follows :— 8.

K, Division) in the neighbourhood of Yangi Arq between Kokand and Margilan and that all Units from Andijan, Kokand, Margilan and Kho- jent should take part. 13. Communications. —All unemployed labour is now concentrated on constructing a metalled road from Uzgend to Karakol on the Sinkiang frontier. Uzgend is being turned into a Military station of some importance. About 1,000 troops are stationed there at present. 14. Railway repairs.—Worn out rails and Sleepers are being replaced on the section Andijan-Chernayeva. Jizak An individual who left Jizak on the 15th of March reports as follows : 15.

Collectivization. —This is universally applied throughout' the Jizak district oupplies.'are very’ short on‘account of the umversal cultivation of cotton. 19. Troop movements. —There seems to be considerable movement of troops in prog ress, this may be reliefs or perhaps in con nection with manoeuvres. 2 troops tra^'X passed through Jirak from Samarkand in/ j direction of Chernayeva during one week shortly before the departure of the infor mant and another two in the opposite direction. 20. Control of Railway Passengers .— From the 1st of March the railway authori ties have been instructed to refuse booking seats for passengers not in possession of G. P. U. permits to travel. 21. Basmachi. The Basmachi rising which has been an annual feature for the past three summers throughout Turkistan seems to be recurring again this year. Anti revolutionary posters are frequently found affixed to buildings, and two considerable parties of Basmachi numbering, it is said, about 800 under the leadership of one Shah Nazar of Ura Tube have put in an appear ance in the mountains of Duldultash and Ailanyuti. On the 5th of March they damaged one ver^t of railway line near Taimurlan. 1 raffic was held up for 2 days. A company of Infantry and a Squadron of Cavalry were sent from Samarkand to pursue the Bas machi but up to date have had no success. I he informant when passing through Ask ha bad saw 60 Turkomans brought in under escort and was informed that they had been captured near Kizil Arvat where considerable numbers of the Yamuts had already collected and joined with bands from Khiva. Heavy fighting is said to have taken place m this neighbourhood. Escaped refugees from the rebellion in the Caucasus are said to have joined the Basmachi. Note.—T h's is quite probable since a number have- managed to cross the Caspian, several having entered Persia, and renched Meshed. HI. Herat. Nothing of interest to report.

(b) There has been an increase of con traband activities in certain areas of the frontier ; as a result, the Officer Command ing the Garrison at Gifan has been in structed to increase his vigilance as regards refugees and smugglers. (c) A Soviet attempt to tamper with the integrity of the Persian Post and Tele graph service has been discovered by the local authorities and has created a consi derable stir. The Governor and the Chief of Police have made exhaustive investiga tions which revealed the fact that all mes sages received in or sent from Meshed along the main Persian telegraph lines have been immediately relayed to Askhabad. The officials chiefly responsible have been arrested. During their investigations, the Governor and the Chief of Police visited Bajgiran ; this vist was watched with consi derable anxiety and interest by G. P. U. agents in the vicinity of the frontier.

Basmachi. —The Basmachi activities i have caused considerable tension between the Afghan and the Soviet Governments. I The latter has protested strongly and has demanded that the Afghan Government take immediate action to prevent these raids. 8. Smuggling of Arms. —The Russians are said to have smuggled into Afghanistan via Kerki a large number of Japanese rifles which they are selling very cheaply. 9. Kolhoz. —Strenuous endeavours are being made to populan^b/the Kolhoz move ment in TJzbegistan and Turkmenistan. Aeroplai^s have dropped leaflets, signed by Stallin, to the effect that another eight months would see the successful termina tion of the five year plan : leaflet pointed out the great advantages and benefits which this success would bring to the people and urged every one to a final effort of co-opera tion. In contrast to the general lack of all com modities the Kolhoz workers have been liberally fed and clothed ; those resist the movement are being prosecuted and im-^ - prisoned. Karshi prison at present has 3,000 such prisoners and is full; more are being sent to Salfalka, and some are being shot. The authorities in the Tejend area have started a compaign of forced labour. 10. General. —There appears to be consi derable general political uneasiness ; a large number of officials, all holding more or less responsible positions were arrested early in April (Askhabad 46, Tejend 12, Sarakhs 6)-. Among these are the Presi dent of Turkoman Society Askhabad, the Editor of the Askhabad paper Tokmak. the President of the District Political Com mittee Tejend, the President of the Tejend Kolhoz Committee (a leading G. P. U. Offi cial, who had a distinguished career as such, since 1920) and some legal officials in Sarakhs. One Ashir Netsoff, president of the Su preme court, has arrived at Tejend for the purpose of conducting the trials, The accus ed were tried summarily and in camera and all sentenced to 5 to 10 years’ imprisonment. At the same time as these arrests, simul taneous large s°ale arrests (amounting to several hundreds) of agricultural labourers were carried out. The precise reason for these arrests is not known, but the general opinion in the towns concerned is that all the principals were accused of anti-Soviet sympathy or activity. III. —Herat.

Soviet Activities. —D wring the month there have been a series of small incidents which have somewhat aggravated the rela tions between the Soviet representatives and the local authorities.- (а) At the end of April, one, Ghanioff, a Soviet commercial representative at Kuchan, was summoned to Meshed by order of the Persian Government and was order ed, on account of his subversive propaganda activities, to leave Persia within four days. He proceeded to Tehran to protest. (б) The Soviet Consul General held a reception on May 1st to which, in addition to local Bolsheviks, he had invited a certain number of Persian merchants. 1 he Chief of Police posted a posse of his men at the Consulate gates with orders to prevent all Persian subjects from entering. The Consul General telephoned to the Chief of Police and complained that the latter had no right to interfere with friends visiting the Soviet Consulate on an official occasion ; to which the Chief of Police replied that the day was not recognised by the Persian Government as an official oc casion, that no Persian Officials had either been invited or had called, and that the Persian subjects in question, having no official status, had no business to do so. Subsequently the Soviet Consul General called a meeting of local Bolsheviks at the offices of the TORGPRED, at which it was decided to address a protest to the Persian Government regarding the anti-Soviet attitude of the Chief of Police. The Soviet Consul General’s opinion regarding the views of the Chief of Police is a correct one ; there is reason to believe, however, that his protest has met with scant sympathy. The Chief of Police is loyal and efficient and is held in considerable esteem by the Persian Government and by the Governor General. (c) In the middle of the month a promi nent member of the Russian emigre society died and the Soviet Consul General objected to his being buried in the Christian Cemetry. He was, however, informed officially that his intervention in the matter was unwarrant able. The Soviet Consul General proceeded to Russia on a visit, as a result of discussions of a nature undisclosed between himself and j,he GoYernor General^ in which their MC2lfoFD ENCLOSURE IN t INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S j Letter No 91 M. | Dated 30JU. M 1932 | Received 18JUL .j32 respective views had proved irreconcilable. He returned after a stay of a few days in Askhabad. {d) There are indications that the G. P. P • are trying to establish communication be tween Soviet Russia and India via Meshed- Zahidan through the medium of apparent ly privately owned commercial lorries. The following men, residents of Bajgiran, received financial assistance from the Soviet to purchase lorries in Tehran : Mulla Kam- bar, Hassan-Qurbanov, Ghulam Hussain Haji Rahim. These gentlemen run a profitable smuggling business, and operate chiefly between the Soviet border and Tehran. Their lorries, however, have done one or two trips to Zahidan and they are said to intend setting up a permanent service between Meshed and Zahidan. The Central Bureau of the G. P. U. has called upon its agents along the frontier to furnish detailed up-to-date intelligence re ports regarding local resources, grain dumps, road, telegraph and phone communication, frontier posts etc. These reports are to be submitted by June 1st. The Persian au thorities became aware of the receipt of these instructions early in May and have been actively engaged in the matter. II. Central Asian Soviet Republics. 2.

M. Division from Termez to Baisun is contem plated. Various facts support this state ment. Baisun is a very pleasant hill station, and there has been considerable building activity in progress. Ten new buildings have just been completed and in addition a two-block building is under construction as a hospital. The road from Baisun to Denau has been reconstructed and metalled and work on the Denau-Dushambe railway sector is nearly completed. There is also great railway construction activity at Dushambe, where all available labour has been concentrated for the work on the Dushambe-Kulab line, which the Soviet Government wish to complete by the end of the current year. 3.

The building of this town which has been given the name TOOS, has pro gressed considerably and it now consists of several hundred houses of village type, and is inhabited by the labourers employed on an extensive cotton growing project. Pipe lines supply the town with water from the river, and an adequate irrigation scheme, which is being gradually improved, has been constructed. The last crop of cotton is said to have been a big one, though no figures are available. (/) Conscription. —Conscription is due to commence on 15th June ; reservists training will commence on the same date. (g) Aerodrome. —A good landing ground equipped with searchlight is situated between Kamar Sarai and Faizabad ; it has one hangar.

These boats (barges) take three days on the up stream journey and 6 hours on the down stream. 8. Press Comments. —The following precis of two articles published in the Soviet Newspaper PRAYDA BOCTOKA are of interest:— {a) Two engineers who had bolted from Soviet Russia came to Meshed in search of work ; after some time, finding that the work was too hard and the pay was too small, and encouraged by the Persian authorities to whom they had given a certain amount of trouble, they threw them selves on the mercy of the Soviet Consul General, who sent them back to Russia where they were tried for desertion. In their statement, the prisoners said that “ Mirbidalev, a disgustingly drunken and licentious old reprobate ”, who poses as the head of the Russian refugee colony, pro posed that we should meet his friends. We were taken to the Secretary of a certain foreign Consulate. Our first interview with the Secretary, who speaks excellent Russian, was on general subjects. At our second meeting, after expressing his personal sympathy with the refugee Russians, the Secretary told us that he was not really a Secretary, but a Military agent. “ This, gentlemen,” he said “ is the window through which I keep w^atch on Soviet activities He then asked us for certain information, but we gave none. The rest of the article was a diatribe against the unnamed consulate and against the Persian Government for harbouring such people. The statement is entirely untrue. The M. Mirbidalev referred to is a delightful old gentleman, the doyen of the Russian colony and emigres, for whose assistance he receives money from time to time from the League of Nations. A report of the arrival of these engineers was received, together with the information that they were un reliable and their information was of little or no value. A subsequent tentative offer on their part to supply “ reports ”, was refused with the remark that we were not interested. The whole thing may have been a “ plant”. {b) An article headed British Intrigue in Afghanistan. The article states that early in May a commission of British Officers had ai rived in Kabul, for the purpose of “ con cluding a treaty of friendship and squeezing concessions out of the Afghan Government ”, and that the British had commenced build ing a railway line through Afghanistan and metalling the main Afghan roads. “ A large number of Motor lorries and trucks have been sent to Kabul ”. The article professes to see in the above an unfriendly gesture on the part of the Afghan Government and a threat at Soviet Russia on the part of the British, and demands the strengthening of the Russo-Afghan frontier forces. 9. Basmachi. —The Basmachi movement continues with unabated activity and many raids in various parts' of the country are re ported. The Soviet authorities seem un able to anticipate and cope with these raids, but it is evident that they are deter mined to stamp out the movement. Almost all the stories follow the same general line—a successful raid, followed by swift action on the part of considerable Soviet forces, including artillery and an extensive use of aeroplane bombing. At the end of March a party of some 300 Basmachi carried out a raid in Baisun area ; the party did a certain amount of damage and finally succeeded in withdrawing after an indecisive fight. Early in April a large party estimated at between 1,500 and 2,000, under the leader ship of Polad attacked the oil field and coal mines at Kauna Badam in the Fergana area. This party succeeded in capturing a considerable number of rifles from tho guard, setting fire to an oil tank, blocking the shaft of a mine and collecting a large amount of loot. At the same time, two small raiding par ties were operating successfully in the vicinities of Sher Khan and Kokand. Mobile columns from Kokand and Fergana succeeded in bringing the main party to action and in dispersing it with heavy losses. Up to the middle of May, however, the area had by no means been cleared and undiscriminate fighting continues. In the Kizil Arvat area a large party of Basmachi carried out a raid against the railway line which they damaged consider ably. The party was caught by a mobile column, supported by an otryad of aero planes, and all but annihilated. The planes used gas bombs. A number of prisoners, primarily women and children, were taken by the Russians and sent to Ashkabad. A party estimated at 1,200 appeared in the Dushambe area early in March and carried out several successful raids without being caught. Early in May this party carried out a serious attack against the rail-5 way construction parties on the Dushambo- Kulab line. A large amount of material was destroyed and construction was stopped for over a fortnight. In the meanwhile ^troops from Termez and Dushambe (again supported by aeroplanes) defeated and dis persed the party in a pitched battle in the vicinity of Baljuan. Several other small raids, mostly directed with the two fold object of damaging a railway line and looting particularly food, are also reported. 1 10. General .—The general impression conveyed by information from various inde pendent sources is that the Soviet authori ties are making strenuous efforts (and succeeding to a certain extent) to im prove conditions and communications parti cularly in Uzbegistan and Tajikistan. Road, railway and bridge construction is being undertaken, reports as to the amelio ration of rations, equipment and conditions of the army are constantly being received, and, except for the Basmachi movement, the labouring classes appear to be either more contented or any way resigned to their fate.

Persian Affairs, permission of the Persian authorities, by Russian agents in Azerbaijan and Khora san. 1. Some two months ago, the Persian Government, which was dissatisfied with the general state of affairs in various public departments, and in particular with the conduct of certain officials on the Russian frontier, called for a report and recommen dations from the Governor-General of Khorasan; the latter requested that a Commission of enquiry be appointed and this was done. The principal members of the commission were the Governor- General, the General Officer Commanding, Khorasan, and the Chief of Police. The Commission has now completed its enquiries and submitted its report, as a result of which a number of Persian officials, including the Governor of Bujnurd, the Commandants of the frontier posts of Gifan, Bujnurd, some Customs Officials and some officers of the frontier police have been suspended. In almost all cases, the charge is* one of accepting bribes and engaging in contra band activities. Recently, according to Persian official statistics the Russians have purchased 4,000 head of cattle, 40,000 sheep and “ many thousands of poods of grain ”; as a result the prices of these commodities have risen in Azerbaijan and Khorasan, much to the satisfaction of the inhabi tants. 4. Kizil Arvat. —Informant, a ten year resident of the town, arrived in Meshed on 18th June; he gives the following infor mation :— (а) Garrison. Infantry .. 250 One Battery .. 120 One Squadron .. 120 (2nd Tur kmen Cav. Regiment. Commandant .. Vedeniski. (б) G. P. U. Frontier No. 45 .. 150 Town .. ..110 2. Refugees .—There has been a marked decrease in the number of refugees from Soviet Russia ; the Russians have latterly increased the strengths of their frontier posts and at the same time explained to the Persian Government that their reason for doing so was solely a desire to check the ’Crossing of the frontier by unauthorised persons. The Persian authorities, who, although they treat ’refugees with much considera tion, find them a source of considerable trouble, are for once in cordial agreement with the Soviet authorities, and have also strengthened their frontier posts with the same object. II.—Central Asian Soviet Republics. 3. Supplies .—The shortage of grain and meat in the Central Asian Republics has been accentuated by the decision of the Soviet Government that no grain, etc. from southern Russia can be spared for those Republics. The difficulty is being met, however, by extensive purchases, with the ( if ENCLOSURE IN FOREIGN SECRETARY'S | I ■-fittar .\i 0 ij /I ( \| t | I4JULJ1932 i Ai) £ .532 Commandant .. Tapelski.

(/) Morale .—The recent increase in pay and rations, and the issue of new clothing have had a favour able effect, and troops are said to be much more contented than before.2 (g) Railway Workshop. —The main railway workshop of the Central Asian Republics is situated at Kizil Arvat. It employs Some 2.000 men and undertakes repairs of all sorts to locomotives and roll ing stock, but does not undertake any new construction. As a side issue, aeroplanes are repaired there and guns and rifles are recondi tioned. The workers struck on the 25th May, but were induced to resume work on being promised an increase in rations and wages. These promises were fulfilled. It is hoped to get further details of this workshop. (h) Railway Communication. To Askhabad-Taza Sher. Combined goods and passen ger train .. Daily. Mail Train .. -• Every other day. 5 . Kokand. —Informant left Kokand on 4th June ; he is an ex-soldier, who was wounded, discharged from the army and then joined the Militia. He confirms generally the information given in Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 6, paragraphs 4 (a), (6), (c), (e), (g), and gives the following further information :— (a) Garrison Identifications. 8th Turkoman Infantry Regiment. Three Squadrons 2 Uzbegistan Cavalry Regiment. Another Infantry Regiment has just arrived in Kokand—he thinks the 82nd Infantry Regiment. (/&gt;) Gas training. —Gas training is be ing regularly carried out and all troops have been issued with gas masks. A gas training centr&lt;{ under the supervision of two offi cers sent from Moscow, has been established. (c) Basmachi. —As a result of the re cent Basmachi activities in the Tergana area (vide paragraph 9, Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 6) the oilfields and coal-mines at Kauna Badam (between Kokand and Marghilan) have been idle for some two months. A large amount of labour is now being employed in repairing the damage, and a guard of Cavalry and Infantry has been stationed there. (d) Air Mail. —There is an air mail and passenger service between Ko kand and Tashkent, and Ko kand and Jalalabad. Service is not regular. (e) Crops. —The cotton and rice crops have been seriously damaged by locusts. III. —Herat. 6. The Commandant of the Persian Road Guards states that he has received a report to the effect that work on the metalled road from Herat to Fakhta Bazaar has been completed, and the road has been opened to motor traffic.

Persian Affairs. —(a) The Persian Min ister of Justice has returned to Tehran after a tour of inspection, during which he visited Birjand and Meshed. His tour was a fairly comprehensive one, and in addition to examining outstanding legal problems, he also went in the question of the administra tive and financial systems obtaining in Municipal and other Government offices. As a result, a certain number of officials have been suspended, arrested or transferr ed, including the Head of the Excise De partment at Birjand, the Head of the Meshed Municipality (who has been ap pointed Governor of Seistan) and the Trea surer of the Meshed Municipality. This tour is part of the general clean up of affairs mentioned in Meshed Intelli gence Summary No. 7, paragraph 1(1). (6) Supplies. — (a) Beference Meshed In telligence Summary No. 7, paragraph 3. 150,000 poods of wheat and the same amount of barley have been sold to the Russians at Sarakhs (Persian) and have been exported to Russia. (b) The harvest in Sarakhs has been exceptionally good, in spite of locusts, which did considerable damage to the cot ton, but did not touch the grain crops. (c) The Torgpred, which up till now has yearly purchased considerable quantities of cotton for export to Russia, is not buying any this year. (This is probably the result of the increased production of cotton in Central Asian Republics). 2. Soviet Activities. —(a) Two “refugees” from the Caucasus, by name Hussain and Rajab have been arrested by the Per sian Police at Shirwan, where they had opened a coffee shop. Certain documents in their possession proved that these men were postal links in the Bolshevik Intelli gence system. (20th June 1932). (5) Three Kurdish Soviet Agents—Ali- Husain Quli and Mamu have been arrested by the police at Muhammadabad (24th June 1932). (c) Two Persians, Sulaiman and Akbar Khan were captured at Sarakhs in the act of entering Persia with propaganda and other documents (4th July 1932). MC326FD (d) The Persian Commandant at Sarakhs reports that one Istrokov, considered to be ' 1 one of the ablest of Soviet officers in the C. A. M. D., has recently been appointed Commandant at Russian Sarakhs. II.— Central Asian Soviet Repub lics. 3. Dushambe. —Informant, a Berberi chauffeur left Dushambe at the end of May. (a) Construction .—He confirms general ly the information given in Meshed Intelli gence Summary No. 1, paragraph 14, re garding new constructions in Dushambe. (b) Railway Construction .—(Meshed In telligence Summary No. 1, paragraph 17.) Work on the Yangi Bazaar-Kurgan Tube line has been restarted and tunnelling ope rations are progressing, but very slowly. Some 300 men are employed thereon. The Yangi Bazaar-Kulab line is now working. (c) Armaments .—Informant could give no information regarding Garrison, but states that there are 3 Light Tanks at Dushambe, two of which have just recently arrived, and gives the following parti culars :— Make .. .. Ford. Crew .. .. 1 driver and 3 crew. Armament .. 2 Machine Guns. He thinks, but is not sure, that one is equip ped with a light wireless set. Performance .. Speed unknown. Informant saw the machines travelling across country over hills and says they appeared to be very satisfactory. (d) M. T. School .—Early in May a Staff Officer from Tashkent arrived in Dushambe, with a small staff and opened an M. T. School. Volunteers were called for from all garages in Dushambe. Twenty- five were selected to undergo the course (of 4 months duration) and are then to be sent to Tashkent. 4. Guzar. —Informant left Guzar on June 18th.

(e) Supplies.—A supply depot was- opened on 15th May ; the following mode rate prices prevail:— Sugar .. .. 25 Kopeks per pound. Brown Bread .. 6 Kopeks per pound. Meat and white bread unobtainable. Cloth .. , * 20 Kopeks per yard. Paper money is not accepted. (/) Loans. —Early in May the Govern ment floated a 5% loan, redeemable in 5 years’ time, energetic steps to popularise the loan are being taken; badges, bearing patriotic devices, are issued to all subscrib ers of 500 roubles and over, while the pur chase of 2,000 roubles’ worth of shares entitles the buyer to buy goods at the Sup ply Depot above mentioned for paper mo ney. Conversely, repressive measures (compulsory “ donations ”, confiscation of property) are enforced against those who are known to have the money but refuse to subscribe. (g) Railway workshop. —The railway workshop mentioned in Meshed Intelli gence Summary No. 2, paragraph 14 has recently been enlarged and reorganised. It now employs some 1,500 men, and engines and rolling stock from Kagan, Kerki, Termez, Dushambe and Shersabz have been collected there for repair; like the Kizil Arvat workshop, this workshop has a section for the reconditioning of guns, rifles and machine guns. (h) Roads. —Informant states that there is great activity on the Samarkand-Termez road, which is being improved and metalled throughout its length. (Reports as to worW on various sections have been received fron^^ time to time, the information is probably correct.) Samarkand Kara Teppe Kitab Sharshabz Chirakchi Yak Sarai Tal Guzar Darband (South branch) .. (East branch) Chilyanzur .. Baisun Lialikan .. .. Deh Nau Shirabad .. Termez .. (i) Railway Communication. —Guzar to Karshi and Guzar to Shersabz combined goods and passenger train : 3 per week. Informant states that for several days, a daily goods train was sent from Karshi to Termez, laden with timber and iron. (If this is correct, it may be in connection with the reported bridge building at Termez.) 5. Comment on period January-June 1932 .—The information received during the last six months from a large number of refugees of varying reliability from all over the Central Asian Republics gives the im pression that the Russians are making methodical endeavours to bring about general improvements from a military point of view, throughout these Republics, and. particularly as regards such parts of them as lead to, or are contiguous with the Afghan or Persian frontiers. Some of the information is admittedly vague ; (e.g., a favourite tit-bit of news is “ all the Russians are preparing for war ; the people hate the Moscow Government and await the revolution ”). But a com prehensive view of the whole reveals, I think, a methodical plan behind it all. The main branches of activity appear to be :— 1. Communications. —Generally speaking, activities seem to be confined to the improve ment and repair of existing lines of com munication ; a certain amount is however being done in the way of new construction.Improvements. {a) Roads — Ref. Meshed Intelligence Summary. No. 4, paragraph 7 Charjui-Askhahad Road. No. 6, paragraph 2(c) Baisun-Denau Road. No. 6, paragraph 4(i) Samarkand-Termez Road. New constructions. No. 4, paragraph 13 Uzgend-Karakol-Sin- kiang frontier. (6) Railways — Repairs and Improvements. * No. 3 (16) .. Chernay ev-Kokand line. No. 4 (14) .. Chernay ev-Andijan line. No. 6, paragraph 4(^r) Kokand-Fergana-An dijan line. New constructions. No. 1 (17) No. 6, 2(c) J Dushamb.e-Kulab. In addition, rumours from time to time have come in regarding the construction of the line from Dushambe to the Pamirs. From this, it would appear that a large junction is contemplated at Dushambe, with lines radiating (a) to the main Kokand- \ Samarkand line, (b) towards Kirghistan, (c) to Kulab, (d) to Termez. No. 7, 4:(g) .. ) The two main work- No. 2 (14) .. ) shops are at Kizil Arvat and at Karshi. Both these work shops have recently been enlarged, and in formation just received states that the Karshi workshop which serves the Bokhara- Samarkand-Dushambe-T e r m e z systems, now employs 2,000 men, with, as at Kizil Arvat, a side line for the reconditioning of arms. (c) Telegraphs. —The information for warded in report No. 964, dated the 6th June 1932, regarding anxiety caused by the in efficiency of existing systems, as revealed by the recent affairs in the Far East, has been confirmed. I have no details yet, beyond a statement that a new system of periodical inspection of the main lines by a kind of engineer-linesman accompanied by gangs has recently been instituted. (d) Bridges — No. 1, 17 (u) .. New wooden railway bridge over Kizil Su river (in connection with Dushambe-Ku - lab Railway). No. 5, 6 (d) No. 6, 7 {d) No. 6, 6 (d) 1 .. *) Two new bridges under construction at Termez. One bridge under con struction at Kamar Sarai. It will be seen that most of the above activity is directed in improving com nuni- cations towards the Afghan frontier, and that when all the work is completed, a considerable improvement in communica tions will have been achieved. 2. New Barracks and Buildings .— No. 1, paragraph 14 The reported new con structions at Dush ambe tend to con firm the idea that Dushambe is being developed into a big military and railway centre. No. 2, paragraph (12) 8 new buildings at Karshi. No. 6, paragraph 2(e) 10 new buildings at Baisun. Although, according to an engineer who worked for some time on the Turksib railway, engineering difficulties render highly improbable the linking of Guzar and Baisun by railway, the recent improve ments in road communication have un doubtedly enhanced the importance of both Baisun and Karshi. 3. Supplies.—No. 7, paragraph 3 {a). The recent Russo-Persian agreement regarding purchases of supplies which probably be of considerable assistance to the Russians in solving their central Asian food problems. {b) Further information regarding these purchases states that large quantities of supplies are being transported from Bajgi- ran to Ashkabad, whence they are bein 0, distributed by train. Supply dumps are being formed at Ashkabad, Samarkand and Tashkent. (c) Rumours, too vague to be of them selves of any value, have from time to time been received regarding the purchase of horses by the Russians in Persia and on the Afghan border. A Persian Staff Officer, engaged in buying horses for the Persian Army, recently com firmed this and stated that his mission had been rendered considerably more difficult as a result. He further stated that the Russians had started remount depots at Merv and Dushambe. (As these two towns are the Headquarters of 8th and 7th Cavalry Brigades, respectively, the statement is probably true.)4 4. Training. —The outstanding feature of the information received regarding training is the general attention which is being paid to gas training. It is safe to assume that the great majority of troops in the C. A. M. D. have already been put through a gas course and that periodical gas training is everywhere general. It would appear, also, that new gas masks are gradually being issued. 5. Morale. — (a) Although the statement “ all Russians hate the Moscow Government ” cannot be accepted in toto, the efforts of the authorities to make troops and work men more contented seem to reveal the fact that certain misgivings on the subject of morale exist. Up to the beginning of the spring of this year reports regarding the discontent among troops on the subject of pay, clothing and rations were fairly general. Latterly, how ever, in spite of the very common inclina tion of informers to say what they think will please, evidence of efforts to improve conditions has been plentiful. No. 6, paragraph 3(/) and(^). j (6) The No. 6, paragraph 4(/). \ troops have received an increase of pay and rations, and clothing is apparently being issued as it becomes available. (c) Minor strikes which have been very prevalent in workshops, factories, etc., have been settled by the granting of small in creases of amenities. (d) As regards collectivisation and kolhoz, the scheme followed is apparently to better the lot of the kolhoz workers by means of the issue of rations and clothing and the granting of certain civic privileges (preferen tial treatment in shops, travelling facilities, etc.), and, in contrast, to increase the severity of the measures taken against those who refuse to co-operate. (e) An interesting statement, for whose accuracy I cannot vouch, but which was made by an individual of sound judgment and au fait with current conditions, is that the question of reservist training in the C. A. M. D. is causing a lot of anxiety. It was originally intended that reservist training should be simultaneous throughout the C. A. M. D.; this plan, however, has been abandoned, not on account of equipment and supply difficulties (the ostensible reason given) but because the authorities gravely doubted the loyalty of the reservists in question, and would not risk the possible consequences of maxing a large number of disaffected armed men with troops whose morale is already, any way, somewhat sus pect. 6. Military Intelligence.'- —The Persian authorities appear to have a very smooth working contre espionage system on their Russian frontier, and are generally well informed as regards Bolshevik activities. Propaganda of the accepted Soviet brand has been general and consistent. But the infor mation contained in the latter half of para graph 1 (d) of Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 6 breaks new ground ; the Bolsheviks have either recently established a system for the collection of normal military intelli gence, or, if such a system existed before, it was either passive or very well concealed. A Persian Staff Officer, who was educated in Russia speaks fluent Russian and deals in such matters, is inclined to the former view. He says that the Persian Staff have been kept busy with political, economic and subversive propaganda, but have not previously received any evidence of the col lection of ordinary military intelligence. 7. Conclusion. —To sum up, the Soviet authorities seem to be engaged on an effici ent effort to bring about improvements— material, means of communication and morale, and are meeting with a certain amount of success.

MC326FD—13—26-7-32—Girsy \\ File copy SECRET. m y Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 9 for the period ending 14th ' July 1932. The principal exports from Persia to Russia are grain, dried fruit and cotton. The year’s total exports of grain up to July 9th (according to the figure of the Persian Director of Customs at Bajgiran) to Russia via j;B ajgiran; ; -Lutfabad and Sarakhs amounts to 34 million poods. The average price paid for grain has been 7 yiials (krans) per pood. The Russians themselves have onlv three Ford lorries, and the recent extensive grain purchases have caused agreat boom in local transport. The Bajgiran Director of Customs stated that about 170 lorries of all kinds, 4,000 camels and 150 carts had been busily employed in collecting grain, trans porting it to the frontier, whence they pro ceed under escort to Askhabad. I. Khorasan. 1. The following notes are the result of a visit to. Bajgiran :— (a) Meshed-Chinaran-Bajgiran Road — 1st Stage. —Meshed-Chinaran. 42 miles. Good metalled surface, no gradients worth men tioning average speed 30 miles per hour. No bridges; Small nullah 1 mile on Me shed side of Chinaran is liable to spate in rainy weather ; a bridge capable of taking heavy lorries is in course of construction. 2nd Stage. —Chinaran-Kuchan. 49 miles. Runs for the most part at the foot of hills. Is metalled. First 24 miles are bad. 400 coolies are engaged on making a new road on this stretch, some 600 yards West of the existing road. The new sector will then join the existing road, whose remaining 25 miles are good. No gradients, no bridges. Average speed 25 miles per hour. 3rd Stage. —Kuchan-Bajgiran. 48 miles. Very good metalled road. Constructed by Russian Engineers two years ago. Excel lent order. First five miles road rises gradually and then goes for the rest of the way through mountainous country. Be tween 20 and 25 miles from Kuchan, the road crosses and recrosses a small river; these crossings are liable to spate in spring. At 25th mile there is a well constructed stone bridge. Twenty-eight miles, from Kuchan the road crosses the Tar§h Arasi, a high mountain ; some 13 spirals. General. —This road, particularly the third stage, is sometimes closed for 3 or 4 days at a time in winter by snow. Tele phone service follows the road, with offices at Chinaran, Kuchan, Aman Ghuli, Baj giran and thence on to Askhabad. At Aman Ghuli a semi-metalled road, constructed some two years ago, branches off to Muhammadabad. This road is not in a good state ; as the Russians took ex ception to its construction and the Persian Government has not maintained it. ^ (b) Trade statistics on Bajgiran Fron tier. —The Russians have a Bureau Perse (Transport Department) at Bajgiran under the direction of one, Yuli, who is also a G. P. U. Agent. This firm, up till a month ago had a wireless station, but it has now been dismantled by order of the Persian authorities. There is at the moment great ^ “ trade activity on this frontier. ENCLOSURE IN WOIA FOREIGN SECRETAR''o l Lotter No 1 12, .VI. ; Latec PTf AUG. 1932 Rw '' i ' 29 AUG. .^3? The grain is being distributed among the Central Asian Republics. (This confirms paragraph 3 of Meshed Intelligence Sum mary No. 7.) Imports from Russia consist chiefly of (hina, Glass, Cloth, Hardware and toilet preparations. Very large quan tities of these commodities are lying, un cle-.red, in the Bajgiran Customs. (e) Frontier Control—The organisation of Police and Custom control at the Persian frontier gives the impression of smooth working efficiency. The unwanted trans- frontier traffic has attracted contrabandists of all sorts, who hope to profit by the confusion and by the extra strain put on the frontier guards. The latter, however, have been increased, and the smugglers are said to have had but little success! 0 The Soviet authorities also are attempt ing to take advantage of the situation for the passing to and fro of agents. Control is very rigid, and though it is safe to as sume that some get thiough, there have been many arrests. The Telegraph Master Bajgiran is said to be in the pay of the Bolsheviks. (/) Kvdcm.—Kudan, the Russian post opposite Bajgiran*, has a garrison of 60 rifles and IS^sabres. It also has telephone connection with Askhabad and^ wireless The road from Kudan to Askhabad is in a very bad state ; it is being repaired by female labour. {g) Current Rurmmrs .—The following rumours are current in Bajgiran :— (1) Serious famine and trouble among the troops in Moscow, of whom F &amp; ' f&gt;v12 large numbers have died of hunger and many more are under arrest. (2) Food is everywhere scarce, expen sive and bad. (3) The grain imported from Persia is being distributed throughout the Central Asian Republics from Krasnovodsk to Tashkent. (4) The General Officer Commanding C. A. M. D. visited Askhabad on 4th July in connection with dis tribution of supplies and returned to Tashkent on 6th. 2. Persian Affairs .—The Persian Officers mentioned in Meshed Intelligence Sum mary No. 8 “ Comments ” paragraph 3 has succeeded in purchasing, in the Meshed and Kuchan areas, only 15 horses. He has returned to Tehran. 3. Soviet Activities. —(a) A much ad vertised demonstration of Soviet mecha nised agricultural machines at Meshed end ed in a fiasco. One machine was bought by the Meshed Shrine, one by a merchant in Bajgiran, and no orders at all were obtained. The machines were said to be of very poor performance. {b) The Persian Consul at Askhabad is said to have reported that the Soviet'au thorities have been much exercised over the large number of Russian agents recently arrested in Khorasan and have decided in future to try and employ more Persian agents. The Meshed Police has been re inforced by three specialist detectives from Tehran, to assist in coping with this new development. Orders have been issued to the various frontier posts to refuse admittance into Persia to all Persian “ refugees ” returning without passports from Russia. II. Central Asian Soviet Republics. 4.

In the Fergana district a large number of horses and carts is being compulsorily taken over by the Military authorities, who issue Government loan certificates in lieu. (e) Troop movements .—Informant states that recently a considerable number of troops have been sent to the Kashgar frontier and that Uzgend is being develop ed into a big Cantonment. (/) Basmachi. —Basmachists, who have been very active in the Andijan, Marghilan, Kokand and Namangan areas since the beginning of May, are gradually being dealt with. There was a big engagement on May 15th near Marghilan and another on June 20th near Andijan ; in both of which the Bas- machi were defeated and dispersed. There remains one party only in the neighbourhood of Fergana ; troops and planes with gas bombs are operating against this party, and its destruction is imminent.

MC382FD—13—10-8-32—GIPSMeshed Intelligence Summary No. 10 for the period ending 28th July 1932. I.—Khorasan. Persian Affairs. .i&gt;' 1. Perso-Afghan Relations. —Events on the Perso-Afghan frontier have led to somewhat strained relations between the two Governments. The Afghans are said to have moved the boundary pillars in the Bakharz, with the assistance of two high Persian officials of that district (Saulat- es-Saltaneh and his brother Muntasir-ul- Mulk), who have been impiisoned inconse quence. The boundary pillars have now been replaced by the Persian Military authorities. Both Governments have strengthened their frontier posts. A Persian Commission, which has been surveying the Khorasan-Herat frontier, has completed its task and submitted its report to Tehran. Details of happenings on the frontier a-e not yet available, but the General Officer Commanding, Khora- san, has personally proceeded to the Bakharz area. 2. Trade with Soviet firms. —Local Bol shevik firms which have recently been making extensive purchases—particularly of grain and wool—are now making difficul ties as regards payments. Two big mer chants in Meshed, Wahabzadeh and Haji Kazim Kuza Kanani, when presenting their bills, were told that there was no money ; their debtors made the counter proposal that they should pay for the pur chases in goods instead of in cash. The camel men mentioned ia Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 9, paragraph 1 (b), penultimate sub-paragraph, have sent a petition to the Governor General, com plaining that the Soviet Agents still owe them 1,300 Tomans and refuse to pay. Further extensive purchases of grain are reported ; Soviet agents have recently been purchasing barley in the Sarakhs area—total purchases up to date 100,000 Kharwars (812,500 Maunds) : the price of barley has risen from 6 Tomans to 10 Tomans per Kharwar. These large recent purchases of food stuffs have been the subject of negotiation between the Persian and Soviet Govern ments. Information is not very precise, but the Persian Government are said to / have placed a credit of three million Tomans at the disposal of the Russians (i.e., pre sumably have made a loan of that amount), with the stipulation that the money be spent in Persia on the purchase of food stuffs. The Meshed branch of the Persian Na tional Bank (Bank-i-Milli) has received 100,000 Tomans from Tehran. This sum has been handed over to the local Soviet bank ; of this sum 53,000 Tomans has been paid to Haji Kasim in part payment of the 100.000 Tomans spent by him on the purchase of wheat for the Russians, and 47.000 Tomans has been paid to various brokers who have purchased wool. Although nothing has yet been published officially, the above information was received from two independent sources—one official, one commercial. The three million Tomans are to be spent in Persia, and repayment will be made to the Persian Government in kind—chiefly in sugar and matches. There is an idea that the Persian Government intend to create a monopoly in these articles. 3. Soviet activities. — (a) Employment of Persian agents. —The information contained in Meshed Intelligence Summiry No. 9, paragraph 3 (5), is confirmed ; very precise and strict orders have been issued to the Police and frontier guards. A social club of sock and carpet weavers was reported as being engaged in the pro pagation of Bolshevik ideas and literature. As a result the leaders Abdullah Hussain Zadeh, Taqi Baba Zadeh, Shukrullah, Mahmud and Azlzullah, and 45 members have been arrested. {b) A Russian report which is being assiduously spread in Meshed states that Nadir Shah has recently been operated upon and is now on the point of death. II. —Central Asian Soviet Republics. 4. Troop Movements. —Ten days ago a rumour was in current to the effect that the Russians had moved a brigade from Merv to Sarakhs. This information has been confirmed by a refugee from Sarakhs who arrived in Meshed yesterday. hNCLOSURfc iN | INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter No 116 vi.

Soviet Intrigue in Afghanistan. —Russo- Afghan relations have become considerably strained on account of the Soviet propa ganda on behalf of Amanullah. Early in June an Afghan named Mohammad Akbar Khan a prominent pro-Amanullah Com munist whose headquarters are at Tashkent, toured round Uzbegistan lecturing on behalf of Amanullah and enlisting Berberis and Afghans to act as agents, iHe received constant support from the G. P. U. The Russians are said to be arming pro- Amanullah Afghans in Uzbegistan and Tajikistan and to be smuggling rifles for the same purpose into Afghanistan, where they being sold, for Rs. 30 (Kabuli) each, with TOO rounds. The Russian Consuls at Sherkhan and Maimana are also said to be actively en gaged in anti-Nadir Shah intrigue. R. H. STEVENS, Mijor, Secretary to II. B.

The suggestion contained in D. 0. 945, paragraph 2, of 21st July 1932, however, is substantiated. LAC ( Bridging material for the construction of an iron and mfesonry bridge has been collected, foundations on the Russian side have been constructed and a single branch line of the railway has been run from Termez fort down to the river bank. Pres sure is being brought to bear on the Afghan Government with a view to obtaining its agreement to the construction of the bridge. In the meanwdiile two new pantoon bridges arrived in Termez in June. One is destined for the Oxus, the other for the Sur khan, should necessity arise. Each float of these bridges consists of three large “life belts” of cork, super imposed one on the other, the whole float being encased in some strong, rubber- impregnated material casing. The Oxus bridge has 8 such floats; that over the Surkhan has 4. (xV. B .—These bridges have definitely no connection with the normal equipment of the Sappers at Termez.) A test w’as carried out early in July with the Surkhan bridge ; the results were satis factory. The bridge was speedily put into position and w^as found to be adequate for infantry and cavalry. Guns and mechani cal transport cannot use these bridges. There is, however, another pantoon bridge stored at Termez which is capable of taking artillery.2 (n) Kvmar Sarai. —With a view to im proving cc mimirications between Termez and Kuwar Barai, the following construc tions are in.contemplation (1) Wooden bridge over the Surkhan (material already collected). (2) Wooden bridge at Aivanj over the Kafarnahang. (3) Wooden bridge at Waksh Post over the Waksh. At both (2) and (3) communication has been hitherto maintained by means of a raft ferry. A start however has not yet been made in either case, nor as far as is known have any steps been yet taken to collect the requisite material. (A metalled road from Waksh Post to Aivanj to join the Aivanj-Termez Road has also been planned.) (d) Survey Parties.—X comprehensive inspection of the Central Asian Republics has recently been initiated and is being carried out by a series of expert committees appointed from Moscow. The following, work is beir g undertaken (i) Land Survey for new maps. (it) Survey of river Oxus. (Hi) Mineralogical Survey. (ir) Inspection of roads and bridges. (r) Inspection of railways. (ri) Agricultural research. (lii) Census. C&lt; mmittees on the above lines are work ing ^multaneously in each Republic, and it is hoped that the majority will complete their business before winter. (c) Supplies.—(i) The Russians have purchased recently large quantities of grain and cattle, with the sanction of the Afghan authorities, from the Maimana and Mazar- i-SLarif districts. (Comment: This has been confirmed by Penian sources of information.) These supplies have been concentrated at Termez, whence they are being sent to Tashkent by rail. (it) The large supply shop in Termez recently reduced the prices of its commodi ties, but made the stipulation that only gold and silver money would be accepted. Such of the public as took advantage of the offer were arrested in the hope of making them disgorge further gold and silver. (/) Sikhs in Terrmz. —Three Sikhs re cently arrived in Termez ; the chief of these, one Sher Singh gave a series of anthBrithdr^ lectures. He spoke in Russian and statu v that he had been in Kerki, Bokhara and Tashkent for a long time. He subsequently left for Tashkent and Moscow. The other two Sikhs were new arrivals. — Informant visited Guzar. He confirms generally the information given in Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 8, para graph 4, and particularly 4 (a) and (b) Garri son and Armament. (y) Workshops.—He states that the work shop is busily engaged at present in repairs to locomotives and rolling stock.

Persian Affairs. — Finance. —The dis covery of a deficiency of some £80,000 in the Treasury of the National Bank at Tehran has led to the arrest of the Assistant Mana ger, Klrwaja Nuri and other senior officials. An investigation is being held. Among Persian officials the belief is prevalent that the deficiency is due to the illegal exchange . manipulations on the part of the German employees of the Bank. There have for some time past been Tumours that the Persian Government in tended to dispense with the services of all Oerman employees. In the meanwhile Herr Linden Blatt, the Director of the Bank has resigned, and Herr Volger, his assistant has absconded to Baghdad. 2. Political Changes ,—Rumours of cer tain changes are current in well informed local circles ; it is said that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is to be superseded by the present Persian Ambassador in Paris and that the Governor General of Khorasan is to be nominated as Director General of the National Bank. While the identity of his successor is a matter of speculation, it is confidentially asserted that the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be relieved of his duties. Whe ther this devotes any change of policy on the part of the Persian Government cannot be judged until the identity and views of the successor are known. The present incumbent, is a man of strong nationalist anti-foreign inclination, with a slight bias in favour of Soviet Russia. The rumour regarding the Governor General is probably untrue. II.— Central Asian Soviet Republics. 3. Ashkabad — Conditions. —A five-year resident of Ashkabad, who left the town two years ago and returned there recently on a brief visit, states that the development of the town during the last two years has been matked. vA wholev quarter has been cleared of the i huts and slums that covered it and has been rebuilt. Conditions appear to have improved; food is more plentiful and easier to obtain ■{except bread, which is very scarce and of very poor quality, and sugar which is practically unobtainable). Prices on the other hand, are very high. This apparent contradiction is due firstly to the sharp difference in the treatment of : privileged individuals in receipt of rations and special concessional rates at the “ Co-operative ’’ Store and ordinary people, and secondly to the initiation of private trading, ^ The rations and concessions of soldiers, Komsomoltsi, Members of Sovhoz, Kolhoz, etc., have been increased at the expense, apparently, of the rest of the people. A certain amount of private trading has been officially sanctioned; this concession had been received with the greatest satisfaction, as had also the announcement of an exten sion of the scope of the concession in the near future. In anticipation of future concessions a considerable number of people have ten tatively started in engaging in, as yet, un authorised trading ; as this breach of the law is either wunked at or at the worst only nominally punished, the numbers of people so engaged is steadily increasing. The general impression, therefore, is one of a return to normal economic conditions. In actual fact, the man in the street has been hard hit. His rations have been decreased, and his complaints are countered by it being- pointed out that he now has increased privileges in the way of private enterprise instead ; but profiteering in the private shops is general and prices are pro hibitive. It is possible that the somewhat tortuous reasoning of Soviet economics has deliberate ly devised thi^ plan and allowed private enterprise with the object of discrediting the system and proving now much better off r every body is under a system of complete nationalization. In spite of hardships, people seem con tented and regard the present conditions as very temporary and rather as a joke. (Some wit wrote to the press advocating the daily diminution of rations, to train people for the time when they would be compelled to live without any food at all). As at Tashkent, there is, however, a great deil of sickness—the result of a general lowering of the powers of resistance—and the hos pitals are overflowing. The oaise of the sick man is a hard one, for as soon as he is admitted to hospital he comes off the ration strength, and is de pendent on meagre hospital k fare (chiefly tea, bad black bread and a little fruit) and the kindness of his friends. - 4. Frontier Guards.—r{a) The general tightening up of measures for the preven tion of illicit frontier traffic continues;Q the easiest, and lience\the most popular, places for crossing the frontier have hither to been from Ashkabad and district through the mountains, and through Lutfabad. The principal frontier posts in the Ashk abad district have now a considerable num ber of trained dogs of the German wolf hound type. “ Dog-picquets ” are put out between posts at night, and the venue of these picquets is changed constantly. (b) Confirmation .—45th Frontier Guard Detachment is definitely at Merv, as shown in Order of Battle in the C. A. M. D. April ‘ 1932. 5.

The railway has not yet been constructed as far as Maruchak ; no work is in progress, except at Tash Kupri, where materials are being collected for a new line ; inform ant does not know, but thinks that the mtention is to build another line to Kushk, and not to Maruchak. (c) Frontier situation. —The situation in the Takhta Bazaar-Kushk area has been one of continual unrest; large numbers of Turkomans are continually crossing into Afghanistan. The depletion of local popu lation has seriously affected harvests and considerable loss has ensued. There has also been guerilla warfare in this district; a favourable practice of refugee Turkomans is, to get into Afghanistan, obtain arms and then raid and carry off, cattle, etc. (d) Railway Communication. —Merve- Kushk : Combined passenger-goods every other day. c • i tk. j v- ■ j-i * MC5f&gt; 1FD —13—6-10-32—GIPS (e) Construction at Sarakhs. —Informant, who was only a few days in Sarakhs, con firms generally the information given in summary No. 12 paragraph 1 (a); he gives the strength of the Pul-i-Khatun detach ment as 200 infantry and 60 cavalry. 6.

The chain of frontier posts between Kelif and Termez has been strengthened b y the inauguration of a scheme of picquets between posts. The posts them selves are connected by telephone with each other, and with Kelif and Termez. ( б ) Ferry Service. —A ferry service of four large boats, jointly owned by Afghans and Russians, operates for the conveyance of passengers and merchan dise. The ferry has hitherto been' extensively used for the transportation of large purchases of sheep and cattle, by Russian contractors, in the Akcha, Shibarghan and Daulatabad districts. This live stock has usually been sent by rail to Bokhara. . CLOSURE !N On 15th September, the Afghan autho rities intimated that no further sales of live stock could be permitted. Though no official contracts exist, the contractors had an understanding with Afghan pro ducers for the supply of definite quotas per month. This arbitrary stopping of supplies has incensed the Russian autho rities, who are taking the line that the continuance of supplies is a moral obliga tion and that the Afghan authorities should bt least have given formal notice —say two months, of their intention to prohibit such purchases in the future. The situation has given rise to a certain amount of local feeling; the Russians are blustering, and the Afghans are retaliat ing by raising difficulties, to the passage of Russian imports through the Afghan Customs. (E.g., Petrol and oil tins are all examined one by one, shaken, and sometimes opened. (c) Russian Intrigue in Afghanistan .— [Vide Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 10, para. 7, and Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 12 , para. 2(i).] Information from various sources seem to indicate that there is very little doubt that the G. P. U. run a fairly extensive pro-Amanullah propaganda branch. Details of the organisation are difficult to obtain, but it seems probable that the Termez branch mentioned in Meshed Intelligence Summary No. 12 , para. 2 (i), is the administrative headquarters, with various branches dotted conveniently along the frontier. Such a branch exists at Kelif; its strength is approximately 30, mostly Afghans, and the director Is' one / Mohammad Sarwar Khan, formerly of Mazar-i-Sharif. The principal forms of activity are :— ( 1 ) Assistance and encouragement to ro-Amanullah Afghans in oviet Territory. (2) Propaganda in Afghanistan. (The Kelif branch deals with the Akcha, Shibarghan, Daulatabid and S«ar-i-Pul Districts). (3) A smuggling branch, for passing rifles and ammunition into Afghanistan and selling them cheaply to suitable persons.(a) Garrison and Armament — Infantry Detachment 13th Regiment 300 Rifles.

It is joined to the town by a good road, and has two hangars and a supply dump. Aeroplanes between Tashkent iermez Dushambe frequently use Karshi as a place of call. (&lt;?) Workshop .—The Karshi railw’&amp;y workshop (vide Summary No. 8 , 4(gr) is some 8 miles outside the town with which it is connected by a metalled road and telephone, and has a military guard. Up to the beginning of September there were some 1,500 men employed therein, and the workshop was very busy, chiefly with the reconditioning^ of engines and the repainting and repairing of rolling stock. 120 engines were said to have been reconditioned. Early in September, the majority of these men were transferred to Kizil Arvat and Tashkent and the present strength of the Karshi work shop is about 400. New sidings and temporary sheds have been erected, and a depot of reconditioned rolling stock is kept there, ready for issue as required. (d) Emigration. —Informant states that more than 1,000 families have emigrated into Afghanistan during the spring and summer of 1932 from the Karshi, Kerki, Kelif areas, and that this has had a con siderable effect on the available labour. 6 .

There is a postal service between Tashkent, Marghilan and Andijan. (c) Gas Training. —Gas training is regularly carried out; all troops have been equipped with the new pattern gas mask. (d) Manoeuvres. —Large scale manoe uvres are due to start on October 20th and will last 10 days. (Comment. informant’s further statement, the w T hole of the 2nd Division will take part in these manoeuvres). (e) Troop Movements. —A considerable number of troops have been sent from Kokand to Uzgent; informant states the total garrison of Uzgent now exceeds 2,000. A metalled road is to be con structed from Uzgent up to the valley of the Kara Darya and thence to Tash Robat, aid preliminary work on a railway line from Uzgent to Osh has started. Note .—The Osh-Kara Su extentionis known to be completed; if any line is contemplated to link up with Uzgent, it would more likely ne Not as suggested by informant, but from Kara Su ? (f) Basmaohi. —There has been con siderable Basmachi activity during the month of September. Large forces were employed against the Basmachi who have been dispersed with severe casual ties. (g) Strike. —The railway men of Andijan, Fergana, Kokand and Kojent came out on strike on September 15th ; traffic was at a complete standstill for several days. The men returned to work on being promised an increase of wages and rations and the foundation of a railway men’s Co-operative store. The promises are being fulfilled. Informant passed through Tashkent on his way to Meshed. In Tashkent he heard that large scale strikes and dis orders had recently occurred in Moscow, in the course of which many supply depots were looted and burnt down, and a great deal of damage caused to factories and public buildings. For several days Moscow was described as being in a state of war. The troubles were even tually stamped out by rigorous military measures.4 Comment. —Strong rumours to the same effect were current in Meshed at the time. (/?) Railway Construction. —There is considerable activity at Jalalabad, where a large number of workmen have be n concentrated for an extension of the railway lino “ towards the frontier Comment. —This may be in connection with the line mentioned in (e) above. 7. Charjui. —^Informant, a railway gangman, left Charjui on October 2nd. He served for three years in the railways, and, before that, for four years in the Inland ^\ater Transport.

Strength 200, of whom 150 are disiributed on posts between Charjui and Kerki. 6' Guns ... 2 3’ Guns ... 6 Armoured Car . 1 Wireless ... 4 (б) Air Mail. —There is weekly air service between Charjoi and Petro- Alexandrovsk and Charjui-Kerki. The aerodrome, which has two hangars, fuel dump and searchlight, and wireless is situated between Old Charjui and New Charjui. (c) Road—There is a good unmetalled road from Charjui to Tashaus, fit for motor traffic; there is lot of traffic at the moment on this road. Note. —This is confirmed from other sources. It is said that a fleet of 45 lorries are operating on this road. The surface is naturally good, but certain stretches are to be metalled. (d) Strike. —Railway men and supply depot porters struck in the middle of September for a revision of pay and rations. The strike lasted for 8 days. The men’s demands were granted. Note .—It may be coincidence, but it is interesting to note that this strike and the Fergana area strike occurred at the same time, and that in both cases theO strikers gained their point. There is no chance of collusion between the two informants, and it may be that some e ffort was made to organise a. more or less general strike of railway men. Further information is being sought. (e) Evacuation of Foreign Subjects .— The information given in Summary No. 12, paragraph 2 (;) is confirmed. Foreign subjects have been given till Marches 1 st, 1933 to make up their minds. (/) Reservists .—Reservists between the age of 35 and 45 were called up for training on September 15th. Arms were not issued to them “ because they are not considered reliable ”. [Fide summary No. 8 , paragraph 5 (e) and General Staff Comment thereon. This repetition is interesting, even if it only portrays public opinion] ({?) Inland Water Transport .—The Oxus flotilla consists of 6 steamers and 18 barges with a total complement of approximately 6 C 0 officers and men. There is one further steamer at present out of commission. Of these seven steamers, three are fairly new and are equipped with wireless; the other four are old but serviceable. All steamers carry a small gun and a machine gun. In addition there are 4 motor patrol launches, with a crew of 2 officers and 8 armed men each, and one machine gun. This flotilla works between Charjui and Petro-Alexandrovsk. The down stream journey takes 2 to 3 days, the upstream journey anything from 10 days to a fortnight, .

Persian Affairs .—Simultaneous petitions from the merchants of Tehran, Resht, Tabriz, Meshed and other big Persian cities have been submitted to the Persian Government, complaining against trade regulations as a whole, and against the conditions which are being forced upon them as regards trade with Soviet Russia. The Minister of Commerce has telegraphed that a Com mission will be appointed to review the whole trade policy of the country. 2. A further 400 tons of wheat was exported to Russia during October from the Darajez district. 3. The Soviet Consul-General ap proached the Governor-General of Khorasan on the subject of the founda tion of a Soviet Library in Meshed. The suggestion was not accepted. II. Central Asian Soviet Republics. 4. Krasnovodsk .—[ Vide also Summary No. 6 (5)j. {a) Informant arrived in Meshed on 27th October. He had been employed for a year on the railway, and previously for 8 years on the Cheleken oil fields. He confirms paragraph 5 (a), ( 6 ) of Summary No. 6 . {b) Cheleken Oil Fields .—Informant states that about 3,000 men are em ployed on the oil fields; the results, generally speaking, must be considered satisfactory, but there is great dis content among the workmen. Condi tions of living are extremely bad, and the work is, to all intents and purposes, forced labour. About a year ago a serious strike took place. It was suppressed by force and more than 500 workmen were killed. Jn September of this year, there was another strike. The strikers sent 100 men to Krasnovodsk to put their case before the authorities and to plead for more and better quality rations, clothing and an increase of pay. Repressive measures were this time not taken. The men were persuaded to return to their work by the promise that the matter would be referred to Askhabad correspon- between Summary a railway for sympathetic hearing. This promise Was fulfilled. (c) Enrolment of -Some 300 women have been enrolled and are being trained as an Ambulance Corps. id) Propaganda .—is a school in Krasnovodsk for the training of pro paganda agents. This curriculum includes Persian and other languages. I he school is in charge of propaganda branches, opened in the guise of hotels in Resht, Enzeli and Meshed. (e) Supplies .—Both in Krasnovodsk and Askhabad, food is very scarce ; the gravity of supply question is said to be the subject of considerable dence, at the moment, Askhabad and Moscow. 5. Khojent.—\Vide also No. 9 (4)].—(a) Informant, _ employee, reached Meshed on October 20th. He confirms paragraph (a), ( 6 ) of Summary No. 9, but states that there is no aerodrome in Khojent. {b) Troop Movements .—Large number of troops are being sent to Uzgend where a large garrison of 20,000 troops is being collected. A T o&lt;e. (Rumours of the establishment of a large garrison at Uzgend are fairly general, “s of numbers vary from ' 10,000 to (c) Airship. Subscriptions arc being collected in Khojent for the construc tion of an Airship, in memory of Maxim Gorki. {d) Pailway Construction .—A con siderable amount of labour has been collected for railway construction in the Jalalabad and Shorshu districts. (c) Supplies .—The food situation is bad, and the prospect of the coming winter causes the greatest uneasiness. J he development of cotton growing at the expense of cereals has greatly added to the hardship of the peasants and there is a great deal of discontent on the subject. (/) Pasmachi.—PaTly in October, the Basmachi, who had been quiet for the last two months, again started opera tions A party of 750 attacked Jisak on October 2 nd, by night. The attack was2 successful. Jisak garrison suffered severe casualties, the supply depot was looted and burnt and a considerable quantity of stores, rifles and machine guns was captured. The party then retired in the direction of Chernayevo, damaging the line as they went. A further party operating from Lyakan in the hills south of Kokand and numbering some 5,000, Under the leadership of Khuda Bakol caused serious damage to the railway line near Kokand, and actually raised the city itself. Troops from Kokand and Margilan have been sent out in pursuit of the raiders. 6 . (a) Takhta Bazaar. —Informant, a mason, reached Meshed on October 15th. He confirms paragraphs 5 (a), (c), (d), (e) of Summary No. 13, but gives name of Officer Commanding Troops as Babkin. As regards railway construc tion, he states that preliminary work for the line to Maruchak is in progress and sidings are being erected at that place. ( 6 ) Troop movements .—Early in Sep tember, some half dozen troop trains were seen enroute for Kushk. Zs (c) Treatment of Foreigners .—Takhta Bazaar has a large foreign population, chiefly Persians and Afghans; these foreigners have recently been very severely treated.. House searches have been instituted, and where found, any stores of food, however small, has been confiscated and the owners imprisoned. Some 400 arrests have been made. {d) Supplies .— The food situation is causing anxiety ; the increased vigilance on the frontier has greatly diminished smuggling, and no supplies are reaching Takhta Bazaar in this way. Food stuffs—particularly meat—are in con- quence at a premium. R. H. STEVENS, Major, Secretary to H. B. M’s. Consul-General, Meshed* To The Deputy Director of Military Intelligence, A* H.

Persian Jffairs. — Financial.—The Persian authorities are viewing with anxiety the gradual disappearance from circulation of the new currency notes issued a few months ago. Notes to the value of one million tomans were put into circulation by the Meshed branch of the Persian National Bank ; a very large number of them has now found its way into the Central Asian Soviet Republics, particularly to the more important towns in the vicinity of the frontier, where Persian currency is not only accepted, but much sought after. 2. Receptions .—To celebrate the 15th anniversary of the foundation of the U. S. S. R., the Soviet Consul General held receptions on 7th and 8 th Novem ber. Except for the officials and foreign representatives, very few people Tehran—Damgan .... Damgan—Sabzawar .... Sabzawar—Meshed .... stated to jingoistic availed themselves of'the invitations.

The figures quoted are the official figures of the Persian Roads Department. (1) Tehran—Kazvin —145 Kilometres, all metalled ; a good broad road with no gradients of any note. At Kilometre 36 (from Tehran) the road crosses the Karuj river by an iron bridge 25 metres long. (2) Kazvin — Manzil—IM Kilometres, all metalled. The first 24 Kilometres are through a flat arid desert; the road then enters the mountains, where it is well graded and well con structed. Villages are scarce and produce of any kind difficult to obtain. At Kilometre 62 (from Kazvin) the road crosses a stream (a Tributary of the Sharud river) by a well con structed masonry bridge, and then turns northwords. At Kilometre 80, the Sharlid is crossed by a masonry bridge. (3) Manjil—Resht —GO Kilometres. At Manjil the road crosses the Safid Rud river by an iron bridge 45 metres long, and follows the course of the river thro-ugh forest country. Total distance Tehran—Resht 338 Kilometres (212 miles). (c) Resht—Ferozlcuh (and thence to Meshed by Tehran-Meshed road). ( 1 ) Resht — Lahijan —41 Kilometres through jungle. Metalled throughout. At Kilometre 18 the masonry bridge across the Safid Rud has collapsed. Cars, etc., are ferried across. (2) Lahijan — Rud-i-Sar —32 Kilo metres. Metalled. (3) Rud-i-Sar — Abbasabad —87 Kilo metres. The road is metalled and runs along the foot of the hills ; there are innumerable streams, crossed by wooden bridges. These bridges are in a bad state of repair. (4) Abba^abad—M e s h e d-i-Sar —134 Kilometres. Metalled. The first 40 Kilometres are averagely good road; the next 80 Kilometres are extremely bad; there are a number of wooden bridges either collapsed or on the point of collapsing. (5) Meshed-i-Sar—Barfarush —20 Kilo metres. Good metalled road. (G) Barfarush—All Abai —26 Kilo metres. Good metalled road. (7) All Abaci — Ferozkuh —112 Kilo metres. Good metalled road. Between Resht and Meshed-i-Sar the road crosses innumerable small rivers and streams, some by bridge, some by ford. The majority of these bridges are wooden and are in a very delapi- dated state. His Majesty the Shah recently per formed the journey and special efforts were made to make the road passable for him. Within a few days of his going through, however, several bridges broke down and parts of the road were again washed away. The road cannot be regarded as fit for motor traffic. II. Central Asian Soviet Republics. 4. Baimn .—( Vide also Summary No. 6 II 2 ). Informant arrived on November 3rd. {a) Garrison and Armaments — 14th Infantry Regiment. Two Squadrons 81 Cavalry Regiment. A Battery. A Pioneer Detachment Commandant G. P. U. 3' Guns 6' Gun Machine Guns Radio . 100 men. Poznitski. 200 men. 6 1 16 3 Note .— In Summary No. 6, it was stated that the Cavalry detachment in Baisun was of the 79th Regiment. Present informant states that the detachment belongs definitely to 81st. In the same way, Summary No. 10 (5) stated that the 79th Regiment provided the detachment at Denau. The next para, of this current Summary states that the detachment at Denau is also 31st Regiment. Presumably, then, the duty of finding these detachments passes from one Regiment of the 7th Brigade to another. ( 6 ) Reservist Training .—Reservists of the Baisun area were called up for training on October 1 st. (c) Air S'm^ce.—Informant confirms para. 2 ( 6 ) of Summary No. 6 . (d) Constructions .—Informant con firms para. 2 (c) Summary No. 6 . He gives the number of new buildings completed date as 18, and states that, with effect from the summer of 1933, it is hoped to make Baisun the hill station for the Termez garrison.(e) Railway Construction. —Informant confirms statement in Summary No. 10 , paragraph fi ( 6 ), that the Dushambe- Kulab line is completed. He also states that inspections with a view to f instructing a line Guzar, Derbent, aisun, Dushambe are being carried out. A T o£e.—This latter information has been received before, but a railway engineer at present in Meshed, who knows the country, said that the scheme had been definitely rejected as too difficult and too expensive. The repairing and metalling of the road between these places seems to confirm that, for the present any way, no active steps are contemplated. (/) Basmachi. —A band of some 300 mounted Basmachi established them selves some three months ago in the hills to the North of Berbent and have been raiding the Guzar-Baisun road. In the middle of October they attacked and destroyed a small military M. T. colu'mn, taking treasure from G'uzar to Baisun. Three lorries were destroyed, the escort was killed and a considerable sum of money looted. Troops from Baisun and Guzar failed to bring the band to action, but the band has broken up and scattered. 5. Benau. —( Vide also Summary No. 10 , paragraph 5). Informant arrived on November 10th. He is a deserter from the Militia. (a) Garrison — Two Companies 14th Infantry Regiment. One Squadron 81st Cavalry Regiment. One Artillery Division. Commandant Garinov. Note. —Infantry identification is consi lered more reliable than that given in Summary No. 10. Whether the 14th Regiment is at Termez itself or, as stated in paragraph 4 above, at Baisun, it is more likely that the Denau detachment would be found from either of these places than from Charjui, which is the Headquarter of the 9th Regiment. Also, this informant is a soldier of sorts and should be able to give more accurate information. ( 6 ) • Conscription —Informant has heard rumours of the formation, next spring, of a new national formation, to be known as the Tajikistan Infantry Regiment. It is to be composed mostly of recruits trained this year. {c) Bailway Supplies. —A large oil tank for railway supplies has been constructed a mile from Denau station ; it is not yet in use, but is at present being painted. (d) Strikes .—Large number of lab ourers and cultivators came out on strike on October 20th, demanding higher wages and better conditions. The G. P. U. were unable to cope with the strikers, and the troops, who were called out, refused to open fire. The matter was reported by wire to Moscow, and a reply was received that the stri kers ’ requests were to be granted. In the meanwhile the town was in a state of complete disorder, and considerable damage and looting occurred. (e) Basmachi .—Basmachi have been carrying out a series of raids on the railway line between Denau and Dushambe and against the new construc tions on the Dushambe-Kulab line, where two new wooden bridges were destroyed. These activities are interfering very seriously with railway communication. Considerable damage has been done, and men and material for repairs are difficult to find. (/) Cotton .—The cotton crop, though attacked by locusts, with which, aero planes only partially succeeded in coping, has given a fairly good yield. 6 . Ah Rabat .—Information from a reliable Turkoman source states that a fortnight ago the small Russian post of Ak Robat (40 miles west North-West of Kushk post) was attacked and totally destroyed by a band of Turkomans and Afghans. The small garrison put up a spirited resistance and the attack- ^ ers, who, among other things got away with two machine guns, suffered over 50 casualties. 7. Troop Movements .—The following information has been received from a very reliable source :— The 1 st Turkmenski Cavalry Regi ment and the 2 nd Turkmenski Cavalry Regiment, which were stationed at Kerki and Askhabad, respectively, were transferred to Kushk at the beginning of June for manoeuvres. The 2nd was relieved by a regular Infantry regiment; who rebeved the 1 st is not known. Early in July the Merv Brigade was transferred to Sarakhs, and at the beginning of September the 1 st and 2 nd Turkmenski Cavalry Regiments were transferred from Kuhsk to Merv. A new Turkmehski Cavalry Regiment ( 4 th) is in process of being raised in Askhabad. 8 . Armoured Units .—The source from which (7) above was obtained states that up till now no armoured units4 have been attached to national forma tions, but that 20 officers, Turkomans, are at present under training at Tashkent, with a view to the formation of such units. It is hoped to get further details. 9. General Conditions in Central Asia. —Recent emigres are unanimous in say ing that conditions in Central Asia are extremely bad and that the coming winter will be one of the greatest possi ble hardship. It must be accepted that the Soviet authorities are both aware of and are doing their utmost to grapple with the problem of lack of food, clothing, etc.; their efforts, however, are only partially successful. For this, the lack of any efficient distribution service is as much to blame as the lack of supplies them selves. The army, the labourers of certain more important industrial and agricul tural undertakings have received cloth ing and are receiving more and better rations. Rut the remainder of the population will be faced with almost starvation conditions in the immediate future. The danger of famine is apparent to all and has given birth to fear and grave discontent among the population. Strikes, such as that described in para graph 5 (d) above, are common occur rences and though they are suppressed* they increase the tension and discontent among the people. In these circumstances, it is easy to understand that there is a considerable amount of food hoarding, and the severe counter measures being taken by the authorities are another cause of bitter resentment. In some places, actually, cannibalism has been reported ; even if this cannot be accepted, the general impression obtained from a considerable number of emigres of all sorts is that the Soviet authorities will be faced, during the winter of 1932-33, with a supply crisis of the first magnitude.

Central Asian Soviet Republics. Persian Affairs. —1. Communications. —It is reported that the Persian Government has sanctioned the sum of Tomans 5,00*000 for the construction of a road from Khwash via Iran Shchr and Dawar Paneh to Chahbahr of the Persian Gulf. Labour has been sent from Tehran for this purpose. 2 . The road Zahidan-Meshed is at present in an unusually good state of repair. The decrease of motor traffic on this route is most noticeable since the withdrawal of the railway to Nok Kundi. The good state of the road is partially due to this cause. 3. General .—Public meetings were held by order from Tehran to celebrate the cancellation of the Anglo-Persian Oil agreement. The Bolsheviks have naturally been making much capital out of this incident as possible, and were much in evidence at the official celebra tions. It appears extremely doubtful that there is any real public sentiment in this matter at least as far as this town is concerned. The remark of a local Persian shopkeeper, a retail oil merchant, is significant. When asked why he was flying flags and had decorated his shop replied, “ I put these up by order of the Nazmieh, it seems that some oil treaty has been cancelled, but whether it is British or Russian I am sure I don’t know ! ” 4. Afghan Affairs. —The Afghan Consul-General at Meshed returned a week ago from Herat whence he had proceeded to meet Shah Mahmud Khan. Recent events in Kabul have given rise to wild rumours in Meshed, no doubt spread by ill wishers of Nadir Shah, regarding disorders in* many parts of Afghanistan. The Herat Province appears to be quiet at the moment. The Soviet Consul at Herat with some members of Staff arrived in Meshed three days ago. It is said en-route for Russia, why they had not taken the shortest route to Kushk is not apparent. 5.

Note.—N o Diaries have been issued since the 30th of March 1933. I.—Khorasan. 1 . Persian Affairs. —The most noticeable characteristic in local Persian affairs during the past 2 months has been the complete suppression of all dealings with the Soviet Government. Many of the local Soviet trade representatives have returned to Russia. It was stated that the total takings of the Customs post at Bajgiran for the month of May amounted to Rials 53. Previously this post used to take many thousands of Rials per month. The condition of trade and the monopoly law between them have greatly increased the amount of smuggling which goes on in prohibited articles across the Soviet fron tier. Famine conditions which prevail in Soviet Turkistan render the smuggling of foodstuffs a very profitable concern, the unfortunate inhabitants often selling car pets and other valuables worth perhaps 100 tomans for a pood (40 lbs.) of flour. 2 . Refugees .—The stream of Refugees, Russian and Turkoman, continues unabated. The problem is a serious one from the Persian point of view, since there is no work for the numbers that keeps on arriving. A fair percentage of Russians are sent back to Russia, many of them escape and cross the frontier again elsewhere. A certain refugee was sent back over the fron tier four times before he finally succeeded in evading the Frontier Guard and reaching Kuchan. It is certain that certain undesir able characters come over with the refugees, and the action of the Authorities is in some cases justified. Refugees are normally not permitted to remain in Meshed but are sent into the interior of Persia to certain towns allotted to them, in order to get them away from the frontier districts. Turkomans are fre quently taken on by local landowners as labourers on their estates.

Persian Affairs .—The boycott of Soviet trade continues in Khorasan. Both sides are doing nothing. 2. Refugees .—During the latter half of June and the first fortnight of July the number of Russian Refugees entering Khorasan appreciably diminished ; this appears to have been due to increased activity on the part of the Persian Frontier Guards in turning them back into Russia. Certain additional troops have been detach ed from Tehran for reinforcing the frontier cordon which may account for this; however, during the past fortnight the number arriv ing in Meshed has again increased. Turko mans keep crossing all the time, since, being inhabitants of the frontier districts, they know the most suitable places to cross with out opposition. Probably the food situation in Turkistan has improved owing to the harvest, which is reported to be good; the waterless condi tion of the frontier tends to make the influx of refugees seasonal, the maximum number coming over in the Spring before the springs have all dried up and when the food shortage is likely to be acute. 3. Soviet Affairs in Khorasan .—The vigilance of the Persian authorities in deal ing with any individuals suspected of pro- Soviet tendencies continues unabated. Sus pected Agents and others who formerly enjoyed considerable licence are keeping quiet. Quite a large percentage of refugees who succeed in reaching Meshed are returned to Russia as undesirable.

Two or three times columns have been sent out after them from Karshi, Guzar and Shehr Sabz. A favourable practice of the Basmachi was looting postal and other lorries on the Guzar-Baisun road in the vicinity of Chashma Hafizan. This road is now piquetted.

They frequently come into conflict with the Frontier Guards. (d) Morale of Troops .—On the 1st of June 50 Mohammedan soldiers were sent to Tashkent under orders for transfer. The policy of gradually removing Mohammedan troops has been going on for some time, since they are considered unreliable near the frontier. It is reported that they have been sent to the Far East.

About 2,000 cavalry returned via Kara Kala to Kizil Arvat between the 13th to 15th of June where they entrained for Askha bad. Note. From other reports it appears that normally thers is no Military garrison in Kizil Arvat, the presence of troope would seem to be due to manoeuvres.(e) Basmachi. —On the 29th of May a party of Yamut Turkomans located in the Balkhan mountains damaged 2 versts of railway line at a point, 25 versts east of Mulla Kara; traffic was held up for 6 days.

It seems probab'lle that more are turned back at the frontier since the Persian Frontier Guards have recently been reinforced by addition al troops specially engaged for the pur pose. This new frontier guard is recruit ed partly from ex-conscripts who volunteer for further service, and partly from locally recruited men from the frontier districts. Refugees are being sent from Meshed frequently under escort into the interior of Persia in considerable numbers, it is true that among them are many undesir ables who take to stealing and crime. The majority are being sent to Isphahan, the journey being performed on foot, a dis tance of 1,000 miles. A certain number manage to get lifts on lorries, but it is certain that considerable hardship is suf- ferred by the majority, particularly those with families. The Amir Lashkar recently stated that \ including Turkomans and others the total 1 number of refugees which had crossed into 1 Khorasan and Asterabad this year 1 amounted to about 17,000. This is pro- l bably no exaggeration. II.—-Central Asian Soviet Republics. 4 . Military, General .—Information is now being received of considerable troop movements in connection with the collec tive training season in the Central Asian Military District. Manoeuvres have been held in each of the three Divisional areas near Samarkand, Kerki and Andijan res pectively, and there is evidence that there LC597FD has been an interchange of Units both for internal security and training purposes. The majority of Units have now return ed to their original Stations though certain of those considered politically reliable which were sent further afield have not yet done so. There is reason to believe that the number of Mechanized Units has been in creased, especially in Turkmenistan, where modem caterpillar tracked and six wheel ed lorries in combination with light and medium tanks are being more extensively employed against the Turkoman Basmachi bands, which seek shelter in the relatively waterless desert of the Kara Kum. Merv in particular is being used as a base for operations in South Eastern Turkistan, being strategically situated to deal with trouble between the Central Asian Railway and the Perso-Afghan frontiers as well as to the North. Its garrison has been considerably augmented. The mechanization of the Cavalry Units, including, to a limited extent National For mations, and the reported presence of G. P. U. Cavalry Units also partly mech anized, gives the impression that more attention is being paid to the maintenance of internal security in Central Asia than heretofore. (n) The Soviet press “ Turkmenskaya Iskra ” of the 26th and 28th August, des cribes the journey of a special reconnais- ance motor column from Moscow to the Kara Kum via Tuar, a group of fresh water wells 100 Kilometre East of the Gulf of Kara Burgaz near Oglamuish. This may well be in connection with pro jected operations against the bands of Yamut Turkomans who have been located in the Northern area of the Kara Kum between Khiva and the Caspian, and have long held out against all efforts to bring them under control. (Hi) Morale of the Troops .—The severe famine conditions which have prevailed during the winter and spring of the present year have not been without their effect on the morale of the troops. The actual rations of the army in Central Asia have not been very materially decreased. A proposal to cut down the bread ration in the spring counterbalanced by an increase of pay met with such serious opposition that it had to be dropped. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter . t8* Ji -Cat. 'If ^.1934 \2 In spite of strict censorship of letters received by the troops the sufferings of their families are well known. The result has been shown in an increased number of desertions, suicides and finally in more active discontent of a mutinous character. The policy of calling ont Units of the Red Army for the suppression of strikes and communal trouble has been greatly modified. There are reported to have been several instances of mass refusal to participate in punitive police duties, in consequence of which the Gr. P. U. Special Duty Troops are almost exclusively em ployed on such tasks, these being composed entirely of Communists of proved relia bility. A serious plot to mutiny was discovered in Termez in June leading to the arrest of 85 Commanding personnel and men comprising individuals from all the Units of the garrison and the G. P. U. A similar plot on a smaller scale was dis covered in Khojent on the 20th of Septem ber. An unconfirmed report states that since the 1st of August the pay of the soldiers has been increased by 2 roubles per month and their clothing and rations have been improved. Discipline is said to be better in consequence. 5. Miscellaneous information from re fugee sources during the month. Location of troops and G. P. U. Units. Strength.

(In this respect, however, reliable information regarding the move of the 11 th Regiment from Shehr Sabz to Uzgend for manoeuvres shows that such temporary transfers occasionally take place, for which reason such a move is not an impossibility). {ii) The 84th Cavalry Regiment is possibly correct.

Reservists .—150 Mohammedan troops have been transfer red from Karshi to Tashkent in pursuance of the policy of removing them from their native homes. No relief has yet been sent. Reservists of the years 1921 to 23 be tween the ages of 35 and 45 have been ordered to report at their mobilization centres on the 25th of September. Nor mally those of 40 and over are registered only and dismissed. 9. Manoeuvres .—Troops from Khojent, Kokand and Margilan and other^ Stations in the Fergana area took part in mano euvres on the 10th of September held be tween Kokand and Margilan lasting 8 days. Aircraft co-operated. The exer cises included gas attack by aircraft throw ing smoke bombs. Other manoeuvres were held on the 10th of August near Jalalabad. 10. Internal Political Situation. Food shortage and Strikes .— A. Strikes have taken place during August at Tashkent, Samarquand, Charjui, Andijan and Kokand. i. At Tashkent on the 8 th of August a great demonstration of workers from all the factories took place demanding in crease of bread ration. Women took a prominent part some of them carrying old Imperial Russian tricolour flag, shouting “ Down with Communism Disorders ensued in which the demonstrators suffer ed many casualties. The G. P. U. applied to the Military for assistance. The troops, however, refused to act, stating that their duties were limited to the protection of the country from foreign enemies, not internal police work. The strikers were still out when the in formant left on the 11th of August. - 11. On the 10th of August a similar dis turbance occurred at Samarquand. A crowd collected before the offices of the G. P. U. and demonstrated. The situation was restored within 24 hours. iii. On the 25th of August a strike of labourers, Kolkhoz workers and railway gangmen occurred at Charjui. It lasted 6 days. The military* again refused to act. The G. P. U. finally dispersed the strikers after 10 had been killed and many wounded. Fifty arrests were made. The day following the strike the rations of the workers were increased slightly and the Supply Depots were authorised to sell bread at 14 roubles per pound to register ed workers as a temporary measure. iv. A similar strike is reported from Andijan on the 15th of August as a result of which the G. P. U. were finally forced to increase the workers’ bread ration. v. On the 20 th of August there was a strike of labourers and cultivators at Kokand followed by a strike of the coal miners at Shor Su—it lasted a week. The strikers returned to work after their bread ration was increased. Bread was subse quently issued to cultivators at 3 roubles per Kilo and to others at 12 Roubles. The above reports are all from separate and unconnected sources and there is every reason to believe they are perfectly true. B. i. An extract from the Central Asian press in connection with the food situation is of interest in this connection. “ Turkmenskaya Iskra ” 28th August 1933. “ Sale of Bread at Commercial Prices From the 5th of September will com mence the sale of bread at Commercial prices in Turkistan. In Askhabad the “ Turkmensauda ” (Turkoman Trade Organization) will open 30 selling centres, in Charjui 13 and in Krasnovodsk 10. For sale will be issued “ halfwhite ” bread baked from the so called 85 per cent, flour, which will sell at 3 roubles 50 kopeks per Kilogramme. In Askhabad 50,000 Kilogrammes will be put on the market daily, in Charjui 23,000 and in Krasno vodsk 20 , 000 . Bread will be sold to all but not more than 1 Kilo per person. Contraband bread on the so called “ open market ”4 has up to date been obtainable in Asklia- bad in limited quantities at about 7 or 8 roubles per Kilo. ii. Another individual who has arrived from Kelif since the publication of these instructions g^ves confirmatory informa tion regarding the revised facilities for the sale of bread, but adds that these con ditions only apply to workers in register ed employment, and that other individuals have to pay 3 roubles 50 kopeks per pound (two and a half times the price), which is no improvement on the former state of affairs. This source adds that these facilities are limited to the cotton growing or industrial districts from which the State derives direct benefit, being in no way a philan thropic measure, but the forced outcome of the strikes and disturbances during the past year caused by the food shortage. It is the general opinion that these are tem porary measures adopted to calm the atmosphere until the G. P. U. has further consolidated its position to deal with the situation. 11. Railway Accident. —On the 28th of August a mixed train composed of 8 coaches and 16 goods wagons was derailed between Karshi and Shehr Sabz. 6 were killed and several injured. It is said that the accident was caused by the collapse of a wooden bridge which had been damaged by the Basmachi. The authorities gave out that it was due to the drunkenness of the driver. 12. Karshi Railway Workshops. —There have been considerable fluctuations in the numbers employed in the Karshi railway repair shops. Formerly up to 7,000 workers of all classes were employed. Owing to various reasons this number fell to about 2,000 early in the year. Fresh labour has been .drafted in and the total number is now about 4,000. 13. Flag Marches hy the Troops.—Since the 25th of August weekly demonstration marches have been organised in various towns where political tension has been evident. 14. State Subscriptions. —Recently all officials and workers were called upon to subscribe to an obligatory fund for the construction of a new Icebreaker, the “ Stalin Those without money had their contributions cut from their pay. 15. Osh. Sugar Industry, Road and Rail way Developments. —In May the construc tion of a sugar factory consisting of three sections was started at Osh. It is said that the conditions favour beetroot cultiva tion which is being developed with import ed labour. A metalled road has been constructed between Osh and Kara Su, which is the site of the cultivation, and it is proposed to construct a branch railway line joining these two places. 16. Kelif. Executive Propaganda (J^- tre. —The propaganda centre under the orders of the G. P. U. located at Kelif has a staff of about 20 members. 8 of these are Afghans, 2 Indians and the remainder mostly Tatars and Caucasian Turks. Their agents are sent into Afghanistan normally via Sar-i-Pul, Sherkhan or Daulatabad. The Frontier G. P. U. has a considerable number of Afghan smug glers attached to its staff. Their duties are in connection with the sale of Soviet rifles at moderate prices to Anti Nadir elements. No effort is spared to foster anti Nadir activity either by money or arms. 17. Soviet Trade with Afghanistan .— The Afghans have enlarged the Customs post opposite Kelif which was opened on the 1 st of September. Trade has recently increased and Soviet imports are lying in Kelif in large quantities awaiting despatch. The Afghans have recently prohibited the export of livestock to Russia. 18. Rasmachi. —The Basmachi are active in various areas favourable to their tactics and cause the authorities considerable trouble. Their bases are limited to certain areas where they can evade pursuit such as the desert areas of the Kara Kum, the mountains of Tajikistan, and in certain cases the frontiers of Afghanistan or Sinkiang provide refuge. During the past month news has been received of their activities in the following areas :— i. Tajikistan. —Between Baljuan and Kulyab. These groups are reinforced occasionally from Afghanistan by Tajik and Uzbeg refugees wdio return across the frontier for motives of revenge, or to collect their families or property. There have been several engagements reported in which the success has not_ al ways attended the troops sent against them. They have succeeded in stopping the railway service between Yangi Bazaar and Kulyab. There is another party be tween Shehr Sabz and Baisun. ii. Ferghana Valley. —Parties are re ported in the vicinity of Namangan and also near Jizak. iii. Khiva. —The Yamuts in the Northern Kara Kum constitute perhaps the largest rebel group which has not been dispersed. They raid Khiva and the vicinity several times a year. In May they suffered a reverse but have appeared again m Sep tember when they are reported to have captured Old Khiva.5 iv. Southern Kara Teke Turko man bands have recently attached Soviet detachments m the vicinity of Send Zavod ^ and also m the Tejend district. The x. u. at Askhabad has recently been S VP PW1 ^ —6 wheeled lorries to en able them to cope with the situation. 1$. Emigration to Afghanistan.—It is reported that about 5,000 Turkoman fami lies have migrated into Afghanistan this year from the Charjui district. The dis appearance of the local population in this and other cotton growing districts has seriously hindered the development of the cotton sowing plan. L. G. W.

Tne yamuts, tne largest or tne Turkoman tribes, owing to tneir reinote position, nave long nela out against all efforts to bring tnem into subjection, miring tne rising oi 1931, tne TekKes and otner tribes were crusned. by soviet troops, tne yamuts, nowever, were very little affected. for tne past two years Kdiva and otner towns in tne oxus delta have constantly been raided by bands of Yamuts, as also was tne central Asian Railway between Kizil Arvat and ± 5 ala isnem. Apparently it was decided that operations on a large scale should be undertaken in tne autumn or 1935. ruil particulars are not yet available. i»ne 2nd mountain Rifle Division was moved from tne ferghana district to tne oxus valley, and units from this Division and cavalry from the 1st Divisional area, were sent up to Khiva. fart oi tne 1st Division (Askhabadj together witn cavalry and Tanks was posted to rorm a cordon along tne Persian frontier between Kizil Arvat and tne Caspian, it may ue assumed that tne railway line was reinforced at tne same time between jahal and Kizii Arvat. Altnougn direct evidence has not yet been received, it is thougnt probable that troops from Orenburg and Ak Tyubinsk were employed in driving tne Yamuts soutn off tne usyurt plateau. Tne result or this drive is now becoming apparent. 4500 Yamuts witn very considerable numbers or sneep, horses and camels, recently passed tne Atrak river into Asterabad and Western Khoras&amp;n.3 Kiiorasan.

Heavy and continued rain has washed away the roads in many places and held up traffic for days at a time, oars and lorries have been overturned Py spates and travelling in general has Peen very difficult. British officials. major o. D. ybus, Military Attache, Tehran, paid a visit to Meshed between the 24th and 29th of April, on his return Journey to Tehran his car vas nearly lost in a spate near Damghan, the water coming over the roof of the car (A Baloon). soviet Activities in North Persia . M* lakisbefcoff, soviet consul general, Meshed, paid a flying visit to z&amp;Bul and sahidan during the MOharrum holidays. The object of this journey is not known. He called on the British vice Consul at z&amp;Pul, where he stated that he Intended to repair and sell the soviet consulate buildings. It is not yet known what he did in ri&amp;hidan. The Persian Authorities have been interested in his movements' concerning which they are very suspicious. A Revolutionary committee is said to have been discovered among the Tamut Turkomans (}ersian subjects) of Turkmen r&gt;arai. Extensive arrests have taken place. The headquarters of this movement is stated to be at the village of Ament near Chakma. Refugees .\ f . &lt;3,0 5* Refugeea . As has already been mentioned in the last nummary, refugees are all turned hack into Russia. Those who succeed in crossing a few miles into -~S Persia are arrested fcy the AJanieh or Frontier Guards and taken hack to Lutfabad or other similar points close to the frontier from whence they are put hack into Russia. That a large number i are shot on the Russian side of the frontier is certain. An individual passed four recently shot corpses in the hills between Askhahad and the ersian frontier during the course of a single Journey* 6* The return of Turkoman refugees to Russia under the auspices of the Soviet consulate General meshed continues, pour large parties with families were observed on the Kuchan road in one day. They stated that the Soviet consul gave them thirty tomans per family for expenses on their return journey. II. Soviet c entral /islan Bepublics. | Military. iart of the Askhahad garrison consisting of apparently one Regiment of infantry with pack Artillery carried out four days manoevres in the mountains opposite the Persian frontier in the vicinity of Bajgiran. They approached to within three miles of the frontier and then withdrew , This took place during the last week of April, a. Further evidence has been obtained in confirmation of the prmsence of the 2nd Turkistan Mountain Rifle revision with its Headquarters and that of the 8th Mountain cavalry Division at Ferghana. There seems to he an increase of G.r.TT. forces in this district,(cavalry a infantry). It seems possible this may he in connection with the recentrecent disturbances in °&gt;inkiang. The enrolment of women for Military service referred to in the last summary is confirmed. All women oommunists and Komsomol members are now liable for Military service on equal terms with men. a C adre of qualified women instructors has recently been drafted into central Asia from Russia. The members of this cadre have passed the Military School for Junior commanding Personnel and wear uniform and badges of rank exactly the same as regular soldiers, it seems that these will officer the large number of women’s units which are apparently being raised for various purposes in Central Asia. All women are liable for service if required, but normally only Communists are actually called upon. The ranks being filled by volunteers, women are trained for Militaiy Police, Anti Aircraft Defence, Anti cas duties, communications and Red cross work. in December 1933 and January 1934 Reservists of the years 1904 to 1908 inclusive were called up for Military service. This mobilization was not publicly announced. Reservists were served with notices to report at their concentration centres, and were collected, equipped and sent off in small batches to the Rar Rast. special troop trains were not employed for this purpose, batches being despatched by ordinary trains to avoid publicity. It seems that this procedure is still being continued. Economic. The improvement in the food situation mentioned in para 5 of summary wo: 2 is maintained, though not at the same level as when the issue of bread at Ccanraercial xxtsx prices was first introduced in the Autumn of 1933.Broad distributing centres wnicn formerly were opened eyery day are now only opened twice a eelc. in January in Tashkent an incident occurred when no bread was available for three days. Tne price rose to 15 roubles per Kilo on the Sopen Market 0 and the inhabitants were i terrified that there would be repetition of the famine of the winter of 1932-33. On the fourth day the centres again opened and bread queues, thousands strong waited for 48 hours to purchase their kilo of bread. It cannot be said that the people are confident in the food supply* Many try to collect stocks of bread , which they toast in order to preserve, in order to ensure themselves against a food crisis of an unexpected nature. ootton production in the Ferghana district has been very successful last year, the plan having been fulfilled in many cases by over 100 The fTultivators are treated well and given special privileges and it is intended to make this district t a model one, for the purpose of propaganda for collective cultivization. in other less favoured districts the treatment of the cultivators is very different. Afghanistan. Herat Province. The following miscellaneous information has been given by a recent arrival from Herat. Its reliability cannot be assessed Military. in Herat there are 3 infantry Hegiments called the -Khaki 0 , -randahari 0 , 'Herati 0 . Bach Regiment is about 450 strong. There are 4 Squadrons of Oavalry, each about 300 strong and 4 Batteries of Artillery. On the 15th of April manoevres took place about 12 miles from Herat in thw vininitv nr t.hoiii. iv. T. yi. ▼ii. ▼lii. the shrine of iiulla ^ami. The Naih 3alar was present, manoevres were intended to last a fortnight. In Herat there are said to he 6 heavy guns of obsolete pattern and 12 yield guns of a modern pattern. The troops are armed with rifles of the follovdng patterns : British, German, and Russian and in addition two country made types called , •?en&amp;pur ,, and ,r t7ovapur rt . 150 German rifles were received on the 1st of April. Miooellaneoua . One Abdur Rahman Khan Bergid recently escaped from Herat prison where he had been confined for a considerable time. He collected a band of 60 men and raided several villages in the Herat district. He was pursued by troops and eventually fled via nekhansur into rersia. Five Russian refugees from Kushk, three of whom were soldiers, were brought to Herat under escort early in April. All the Soviet Trade organisations have been sent away from Herat and are now located at Kushk. Only the Soviet consulate remains. This is two miles from the town, ho flag is flown, only a notice is on the door, in the Consulate there are 7 personnel including 2 women, ho one is permitted to visit the Soviet consulate without written permission of the Afghan Auth orities. in connection with State monopoly of external trade, a 'coarpany* of local merchants had been formed in Herat to cooperate with the Government, This committee arranges the despatch and receipt of goods via Kushk, it has at its disposal 7 lorries specially employed for the purpose. A good metalled road exists between Herat and Kushk and the Herat Kandahar road is being improved. ix.6 ix The town Electric station tniilt by the BolshevlfcB during the reign of xmoml Ananulla has been takai over by the ‘•Baladleh^ (Town oounoil). 4 storied buildings in Herat Bazaar and construct new ones of more modern design.

The road between Turkoman laral and Biprlnurd__ is being hastily improved. This road is gaining in strategic importance. At present it is only passable for wheels beyond mir,1 nur d in summer* but it seems probable that it will be eventually made into a permanent all weather road. The security of the Y&amp;mut and aoklan Turkoman country largely depends on the possibility of keeping this road open. 4.

There is a motor road from y 'WAvirnMi,\n to the station of A^TIK on the railway.

The Chauffeurs are a Russian WZMIKOT? and a Turk BlfJIQOFif both v erslan subjects* There is not the slightest doubt they are also workers for the soviet otherwise they would not have been granted visas.

On account of strict watch being kept on all persons visiting the Soviet Consulate General by the Secret police it has been discovered that instructions to Persians with soviet connections visiting Persia on leave, and others who would find it inconvenient# to have their activities noticed, are issued through the soviet Bank. recently the local office of the jersazneft (Soviet Oil Trust) moved into the same building.
