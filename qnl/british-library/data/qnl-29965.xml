As your Directors are oerhans aware, there ore diplomatic reasons which place the Vilayet of Mosul, under existing conditions, in 5^ \ j jin a different category from those of Basra and Baghdad. These reasons make it most desirable, and indeed essential, that British enterprise at hosul should be confined for the present to measures necessary to meet the actual requirements of the military administration; and that no steps should be taken having the appearance of an attempt to extend British commercial interests or influence in the Vilayet.

I am to point out that The Eastern Bank has, by its activity and enterprise, rendered considerable service to the Government of India in Mesopotamia during a period in which the difficulties of conducting Banking operations have been greatly increased, especially in connection with arrangements for securing the services of a trained staff. :ly Directors venture to believe that the arrangements made have been to the satisfaction of the Government of India, and it is their earnest desire to promote in every practical manner the development of Mesopotamia and the adjacent Territories. In pursuance of this policy, it is considered essential that the development of trade between Mesopotamia and be encouraged, as, apart from material benefit to allthe greater tranquillity of the country should result therefrom. I may be permitted to remark that the Imperial Bank of Persia has recently and presumably with the sanction of the Gov ernment of India, established a branch office at Bagdad and by so doing will obtain special advantages in the trade between that City and Persia unless The Eastern Bank is permitted to open a branch at Kermanshah. will conflict with the views of the Government of India, they urge that at a later date reconsideration may be given to the opinion expressed in your letter under acknowledgment, particularly as in the circumstances above indicated any delay in the establishment of a branch office of this Bank in Persia must tend to increase the disadvantages under which The Eastern Bank will conduct its business. office of this Bank will be opened immediately at Mosul, and my Directors trust that the account of the Government of India will be kept with that office as is done at other points.
