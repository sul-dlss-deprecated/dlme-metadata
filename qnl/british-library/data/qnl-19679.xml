C. RO SS t POLITICAL REST TENT,PERSI AN GULF &amp; H. M* S. CONSUL-GENERAL FOR FARS THE SECRETARY TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA FOREIGN DEPARTMENT, CALCUTTA. BRITISH RESIDENCY &amp; CONSULATE-GENERAL I2t BUSH I RE ^'-DECEMBER lb79. SIR, I HAVE THE HONOUR TO SUBMIT FOR THE INFORMATION OF HIE EXCELLENCY THE VICEROY AND GO VERNO R-G EN ERAL IN COUNCIL, THE FOLLOWING REPORT ON THE POINTS TO WHICH MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED IN YOUR LETTER NO. P57I E.P. ,DATED I5TH ULTIMO. IS 2. IN THE FIRST PLACE BEG RESPECT FULLY TO ASSURE HIS EXCELLENCY IN COUN CIL THAT BEFORE TAKING THE STEPS REPORTED / IN MY LETTER NO. 366»DATED I4TH OCTOBER, I HAD FULLY CONSIDERED THE SIDE OF THE QUESTION DESCRIBED IN PARAS 3^4 OF YOUR LETTER UNDER REPLY,AND THE OBJECTIONS WERE WHICH IN FORMER TIMES A RAISED TO AN AR RANGEMENTARRAK G EM EN T OF THE SORT LIKELT AGREED UPON BY THE TREATY CHIEFS OF OMAN WITH REGARr TO ABSCONDING DEBTORS. I WILrl^ NEXT EXPLAIN THE GROUNDS FOR MY CONFI DENCE THAT,UNDER EXISTING CONDITIONS / THE FORMER OBJECTIONS MAY BE SAFELY SET ASIDE, AND THAT,WHILST THE IMMEDIATE AND OBVIOUS /• DV AN T AG E S OF THE ARRANGEMENT ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE FOLLOWED BY F V7 tl/fZ) * DETRIMENT TO THE POPULATIONS ANY A / SUCH TENDENCY WOULD UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT BE EASILY CHECKED BY THE PARAMOUNT AUTHORITY. 3- I WOULD HERE MENTION. THAT THF 77c/ ' RErFMT J5RRANGEWEMT SHOULD BE REGARDED AS NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME DEvyATING FROM A POLICY OF TOTAL NON-INTERFERENCE y ^ t:/ci l/' AS REGARDS THE HARBOURAGE OF fU^J 1 1' 1 V L DEBTORS. THE RESIDENT BEING CAI&lt;LED ON UNDER THE TERMS OF THE MARITIME TRUCE TO^PUNISH ATTEMPTS TO RECQVEa THE ADO x Uyo/lt i/H /Xl J'tU. / CGMD1HC—DEB TOn£ AT OCA, fJ i P U RL LL IT WILL EASILY BE UNDERSTOOD HOW IMPRACTICABLE IT PROVED TO CONTINUE FOR LONG TO IG- - //fZ NORE 'TP^ ORIGIN THE SOURCE OF SUSR IR- O * J J tAsidsj REGULARITIES,AND HOW UNFAIR IT WOULD APPEAR TO THE ARAB SHAIKHS TO RESTRAIN XHF' FROM OBTAINING JUSTICE IN THEIR OWM WflY ANn AT THE SA*' 1 - TI'fE TO rFT.T-'F / / ^ TO INTERFERE TO OBTAIN THEM REDRESS IN ANYV V—^ any OTHER manner. ACCORDINGLY IN 1866 colonel SIR LEWIS PELLY FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ISSUE a NOTIFICATION on the SUBJECT,A COPY of which IS ATTACHED* of late cases of sailors absconding with advances multiplied. and it appear- ed that -eerre shaikhs not ONLY J4L J (A.-t/yy ui/ii s / -i ^4/ * ^ a ^ ¥- // .-t ■jfit L C 'IsU S ' 'Id harboured TJSJi defaulters but made a profit out of them, both BY TAKING A portion of their dishonestly ACQUIRED property,and by employing their labour at the fisheries. the native f' b ' ki t re^orter his i?ia.bily to fully co^e with ffcc t/cc 5 I f the growing evil and predicted extensive /f disturbances unless it were checked, the plan of inviting the chiefs to mutually co-operate under BRITISH SUPER vision was therefore resorted to, AND this system,whilst likely SE«MS in WIMT to be more EFFECTUAL, SEEMS IN point OF FACT A LESS DIRECT INTERFERENCE IN THE MATTER THAN THE PREVIOUS PRACTICE. IT WILL BE SEEN THEREFOBF. THAT THE NEW ARRANGEMENT IS NOT A RADICAL INNOVATION, 4. IN THE ACCOUNT OF BRITISH POLICY in the persian gulf GIVEN AT page 73 OF BOMBAY GOVERNMENT SELECT I ON S, NO. 24. IT seems ABI'ITTED TO BE ADVlSAFLE THAT the chiefs should enter INTO A MUTUAL agreement A,AGREEMBMT AMONGST THEMSEL-VES OM THE SUB- OlUy ' fO JECTtAHD THE OBJECTION OCCMO TCTSC A 310! BRITISH GUARANTEE BEING ACCORDED THERETO, UNDER THE EXISTING RELATIONS HOWEVER f&lt; (( •' SANCTION AND GUARANTEE SEEM^f ALMOST / £? ?97 (y' 1 / JiAs CONVERTIBLE TERMS,AMD HAD THE ATTEPTS TO OBTAIN THE MUTUAL AGREEMENT AT- THA^P- BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE WORKING OF IT WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN SUPERVISED /%r /ii/Uufk ujtu/- BY feGHNyS. I THINK MOREOVER THAT SUCH AN AGREEMENT IF ENTERED INTO AT ALL OUGHT TO BE UNDER BRITISH SANCTION t//cw sfycET AND SUPERVISION IN aRDETr^TO^ if A V S THS MEAW-S- OF CHECK THE ABUSES WH^eU 3EEW A UiSC^ lOlTt&amp;VM BEEN APPREHENDED. / v - ■ f j /7 i c 0/ /Tcm ^ &amp; (/ or / ' ' t cc/ /( 5. KW DEAVOU\ C C&amp;&gt; .JBIEN^ THAT T^5 pftKp&amp;ti LQ&amp; CONSEQUENCES '^Cl CO f ay/ FROM THE PRESENT AGREEMENT PREJUDICIAL TO THE INTERESTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE syiClAr- POPULATIONS, I RELY MUCH ON THE RELATIONS SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE CHIEFS AND THEIR PEOPLE , WIT I CH ARE SI M I LAR TO WHAT ARE A FOUND AMONG NEARLY ALL SIMPLE ARAB COM MUNITIES IN THEIR OWN LAND. THE RULE OF THE CHIEFS IS MORE THAT OF THE HEAD OF A FAMILY THAN OF A DESPOTIC GOVERNOR f AND THE GENERAL SENTIMENT All D OPINION OF THE PEOPLE EXERCISE MUCH CONTROL OVER HIS PROCEEDINGS. TYRANNY AND OPPRESSION ARE RARE,AND THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES WOULD NOTjf MOT bOMO TOLERATE ANY SYSTEMATIC DEPArl- ^ TURE FROM THE CJSTOMARY MODERATION OF THE CHIEFS. IT IS TRUE,AS I POINTED OUT IN PARA 4 OF YOUR LETTER,INSTANCES HAVE OCCURRED ON THE COAST IN QUESTION OF •VMlCli* BRANCH^ OF A TRIBE SECEDINO FROM THE MAIN BODY,BUT THESE CASES HAVE USUALLY ORIGINATED FROM SSTVECXAL CAUSES TH.WH O Y 8 TEH AT I C QPPaCDSlSiN. FOR INSTANCE,A NUMBER OF THE BEN I YAS REMOVED A ovy &lt;yy£ f- ^ FROM ABU ZHAB I , TO ESCAPE PUN I BNT « AN UNUSUAL LEVY OF MONEY, THE CAUSE OF WHICH IMPOSITION WAS THAT THEIR CHIEF HAD BEEN HEAVILY FINED BY THE RESIDENT, FOR UNDER TAKING HOSTILITIES AT OUTTUR,AND WAS FORCED TO APPLY TO HIS TRIBESMEN TO CON- 77il Oont^ /{c^UU^L^. ( s TRIBUTE TO THE ^AYMENT, EVENTUALLY RE TURNED TO ABU ZHABI. TO SUCH SECESSIONS THE PRESENT ARRANGEMENT IS NOT CALCULATED TO APPLY, STILL WHEN INDIVIDUALS FLY SINGLY FROM ONE TOWNSHIP TO ANOTHER ON THAT COAST, IT IS USUALLY WITH DISHONEST INTENT AN D / PERSONS REALLY DESIROUS OF LEAVING FOR OTHER MOTIVES,CAN ALWAYS FIND OPPORTUNI TIES OF GOING TO PARTS OF THE COAST BEYOND THE OPERATION OF THE MUTUAL AGREE MENT. 6, WITH REGARD TO YOUR INQUIRY WHETHERi# &amp; a i 2Vo WHETHER PERSONS WlbL HAVE any REMEDY AGAINST INJUSTICE OR AGAINST abuse of THE POWER DEMANDING THEIR surrender on THE PRETEXT OF debt, I THINK THAT THE PROVISION MADE IN THE AGREEMENT for THE DISCUSSION OF DOUBTFUL, CASES by a COURT OF ARBITRATION SUPERVISED BY THE govern MENT AGErJT AM D FOR ULTIMATE REFERENCE TO THE RESIDENT WILL ACT AS THE safe GUARD CONTEMPLATED AGAINST IMPROPER or OPPRESSIVE APPLICATION OF THE SYSTEM. THE GOVERNMENT AGENT COULD AT ONCE detect ANY SUCH TENDENCY AND WILL BE INSTRUCTED TO EXERCISE VIGILANCE. IN CONCLUSION, &lt; r OF AFTER DUE OBSERVATI ON,THERE SHOULD BE ANY REASON TO SUSPECT ABUSE OF THE GOVERNMENT SANCTION,THE ARRANGEMENT COULD AT ANY TIME BE TERMINATED.
