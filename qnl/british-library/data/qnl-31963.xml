The first is letters between the British Political Agent in Muscat, Lieutenant Colonel Edward Charles Ross and the British Political Resident in the Persian Gulf at Bushire. The file also contains correspondence between the British Political Agent in Muscat and various Omani political and tribal authorities. The subject matter of the letters includes administration report and trade returns from 1877-1878, and the marriage of the Sultan's eldest son. However, the first half of the papers pertains to the attempt by the Sultan's brother, Sayyid Abdul Aziz, to organise a rebellion against his brother in Muscat among the tribes of the interior of Oman.All the letters received from Omani figures are included as both transcriptions made by Political Agency officials in Muscat and translations from the original Arabic.
