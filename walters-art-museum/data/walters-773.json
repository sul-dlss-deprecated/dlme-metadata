Combining the muscular body of a reclining lion with the head of a royal human, the sphinx was a powerful symbol of the ancient Egyptian concept of divine kingship. Although now headless, this sphinx retains part of its striped nemes head cloth, worn only by Egypt's monarchs and meant to represent a hooded cobra, a royal symbol. Originally created for another king, the sphinx's first inscription was replaced by one naming King Psamtik II.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters, 1909", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/33156", "Keywords": null, "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, New York and Paris, [date and mode of acquisition unknown] [said to be from Lower Egypt]; Henry Walters, Baltimore, 1909, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest. \r\n", "Dynasty": "26th Dynasty", "Reign": "re-inscribed for Psamtik II", "OnView": 1, "PublicAccessDate": "2008-09-25T17:13:39.017", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544563", "ExhibIDs": "", "Images": "PL7_22.104_Back_BW_T98.jpg, PL7_22.104_Fnt_BW_T98.jpg, PL7_22.104_Lft_BW_T98.jpg, PL7_22.104_Rt_BW_T98.jpg, PL9_22.104_3Qtr_SL_T.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Centre Street: Second Floor: Egyptian Art"}
