To Foreign Office, \ London. No.155. Repeated for info to Political Resident, Bahrain, No,19. Bated 17th, received 19th April 194S, - Confidential, Your telegram No.170 not repeated to Bahrain: SALE OF X.E.F.C. QUOTA WHEAT BY KUWAIT TO SAUDI ARABIAN MERCHANTS. I can see no objection to such a communication to Ibn Saud but I doubt whether it will have any appreciable effect. Saudi Arabian Uovernment has always played fast and loose with their quota allocations and no doubt regard Kuwait as a convenient centre for unauthorised transactions. In addition there Is at present a marked shortage of cereals in the country. Price of bread in Jedda has recently risen by one-eleventh. An interesting side-light is that when a member of ny staff recently took an opportunity of raising this matter indirectly with Yusuf Yasin, Yusuf Yasin said with some bitterness that Britain always dealt more generously with smaller than v/ith larger ( ? om i ssion ) and went on to say that bazaars of Bahrain and Amman were over-flowing in contrast with Saudi Arabia. It was pointed out to him that it was I.S.F.C. which allocated wheat and no longer Middle Fast Supply Centre But this of course does not affect his general point especially as it is true at least of Bahrain that bazaar is better supplied with United Kingdom goods than those of Saudi Arabia, from which no doubt he mistakenly deduces that they have ample stocks of everything.
