It is largely comprised of copies of various kinds of financial statements, produced by the Government of Muscat and Oman and forwarded to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf by the Political Agent and Consul at Muscat.The statements include the following details: budget estimates, estimated revenue and expenditure, and actual revenue and expenditure. Also included are brief statements which provide summaries of the Sultanate's financial position. The volume also features a significant amount of related correspondence, mostly between the Political Agent and the Political Resident but also between the Political Agent and representatives of the Government of Muscat and Oman, namely the Government's Finance Officer and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd]. Other notable correspondents include officials of the Government of India's Finance and Foreign Departments.The correspondence discusses the contents of the statements, as well as other related matters, such as the Sultan of Muscat and Oman's own personal finances, and whether certain items that are currently omitted from the state budget (e.g. the accounts of the Muscat and Dhofar oil concessions) should be included. Also discussed is the possibility of the Sultan investing some of his government's money in Government of India bonds, as proposed by the Political Resident.The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman (English translations are included).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Finance Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author; correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Financial statements</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman Sa'īd ibn Taymūr Āl Bū Sa'īd</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sultanate of Muscat and Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Finance</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038b#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038b#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00038b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
