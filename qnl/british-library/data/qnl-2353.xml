To The British Consul Baghdad Sir I respectfully and humbly beg to lay the following lines for your kind consideration and favourable action. A Butler by profession named Baghwan son of Jai Ram (Indian) was living in my shop since 1st February, 1934 to 25th November, 1934. During this period as he hod no work, I provided him with food, tea and other necessities, when he left my shop account against him was I.D.12/187 which gave me a compiala and told me that he is going to Mosul in a service of one officer and promisied to pay me 1.0.3/= every month. But I have heard by a reliable source that he instead of going Mosul, has gone to Behrain. If I had been aware of this deciet, I should have put the matter to court and thus delayed his departure. As he is out of ^raq, therefore respected Sir, I beg to request you to be sc kind as to take necessary action in the matter and have the mercy of writing a letter to Behrain to deduct three dinars from his pay and send me through your honour.

To: - His Britannic Majesty’s Counsel, Baghdad, ’Iraq. Sir, One Khan Sahib Malli Khan, who is now in employ of Bahrain Oil Coy. Ltd., Bahrain is debtor to me for a sum of I.D.22/500 (’Iraq Dinars twenty two and fils five hundred). For that amount I hold a '’Compiala’' or promissary-note signed by him and bearing signature of two respectable witnesses who are I now resident in Baghdad. The amount was lent to him in cash on the 16th August, 1935, when he was out of employment and in a indigent state.His six children and his wife were in a state of starvation ill and seamthy clad when he had approached to me for the loan of the amount. The money was lent to him with no object of gain; but beerely as a matter of humanity; and I most honestly state, sir, that the state ol starvation of his wife and children would have rendered any oburate heart compassionate and relenting. His title of Khan Sahib impressed upon me that he was a person of self respect and honour, and that he would willingly discharge himself when he would be in /^position to do so, of the debt contracted by him when he most needed. The man does not seem to have an intention of repaying the amount, although he is in a position to do so, for, he is drawing a handsome salary of approximately £ 23 per month from Bahrain Oil Coy. Ltd., in capacity of labour supervisor. vVith much regret, and great reluctance I am encroaching upon your valuable time, sir, and have approached with a view to my being helped in this matter. I impqltre that you be so kind as to have amount realised by the use of your good office, I have no alternative except to invoke British justice and law, because the Khan Sahib is out of jurisdictionjurisdiction of 'Iraq Government Law. I am prefectly assured that my case will receive your consideration and compassion, and that Khan Sahih will not escape your justice, who with the use and influence of that noble title ought to creat good faith in and gain confidence of the loyal subjects of British Government, but not swindle them and lering them to total ruinition.

As you protect Iraqi interests in Bahrain, you should presumably take v/hatever action an Iraqi Consul would have to take should such an official exist, i.e. you should (we think) try to persuade Dr. Reizner either to pay the sum claimed or to explain to the Iraqi Ministry of Finance why he does not consider himself liable. (in the absence of any agreement between Iraq and Bahrain bearing on this subject, there would seemingly be no question of compelling Dr. Reizner to pay). If you have no objection, we should be grateful if you would therefore approach Dr. Reizner on the lines suggested and let us know the result in aue course.

Most of the requests are for legal documents (some of which are judicial summons) to be issued to Iraqi employees in Bahrain so that they may be signed, countersigned, and returned.The file also includes translated copies of letters, addressed to the British Consuls at Baghdad and Basra respectively, from Iraqi residents requesting assistance in the recovery of debts and maintenance payments from relatives and acquaintances who are now residing in Bahrain. In response to these requests the Political Agent advises that those seeking remittance should be instructed to file a regular suit in the Bahrain Agency Court, either in person or through an accredited agent.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy in Iraq, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Basra</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Consul, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Foreigners</topic></subject><subject><topic>Legal documents</topic></subject><subject><topic>Claims</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x000272#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
