The correspondence is primarily between the Political Agent in Kuwait, Herbert George Jakins and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel William Rupert Hay. In this correspondence, Jakins attempts to convince Hay that an office is required in Mina al Ahmadi, but a definitive decision is not reached in the file.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Mina Al Ahmadi</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0000e9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
