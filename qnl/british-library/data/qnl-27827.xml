Committee Under Secretary Secretary of State / Perusal (9414) Wt.47262/P81 3,000(2sorts) 3/39 A.&amp;E.W.Ltd. Gp.685 FOR USE BY DEPARTMENT ONLY. A pact was signed on the 24th June, 1944, between the Rulers of Bahrein and Qatar agreeing to the restoration of friendly relations between themselves, the Sheitfi of Qatar on his part undertaking 'that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which had not existed in the past.' The agreement ^ concluded with such acclamation^has done little to restore 'friendly relations'. In fact, relations are as bad as ever and-the vexed problem of Zubarah remains unsolved. Within three months of the signing of the pact, fundamental differences arose on the interpretation to be put on the clause inset above and in particular on the words 'in the past'. h Sheik Salaman maintained that everything^ should be restored as it was before the disturbances of 1936/7. Sheik Abdullah, on the other hand, interpreted the phrase as meaning that/that he would not disturb the position as it existed at the time of signing the agreement, an interpretation which had the support of the authorities on the spot. Sheik Salaman complained, inter alia , that under the agreement (a) the tower built at Zubarah prior to the agreement should be destroyed; and (b) arms taken from Bahrein subjects should be restored. The Pblitical Resident's letter, placed below, traces the course of events leading to ttye rapidly deteriorating relations between the two Rulers. The Sheilc of Bahrein continues to harp on his rights in Zubarah and in a letter to the SheikKof Qatar he once referred to Zubarah as 'ny country”, which produced angry retorts from SheikK Abdullah. The chief thing which appears to rankle in Sheik Salaraan's mind is the tower erected by the Sheik* of Qatar. Its mere presence is galling to Sheik Salaman and he would no doubt like to see it razed to the ground. But even were it to disappear overnight, it is open to question whether the Sheik of Bahrein's feelings would thereby be assuaged. The Sheik of Bahrein's real object is to obtain recognition of his claims to Zubarah as Bahrein territory, but the Political Resident has made it abundantly clear that the itesidency has never supported his claims to this area. Sheik DalaiiliMta feelings in this matter are deep and, in the words of the Political Resident, amount u &lt;x£«*s.oS^ to mental derangement.'* These conditions then form the background to the Political Agent's latest task of exploring and tzying to discover a modus vivendi, a task which will demand not only a deep insight into Arab character but the highest political skill. j£?ast experience inspires little hope of a successful outcome.wm'-rSBtBJtP FILE COPY.

Unly three months had passed since the signing of the agreement vdien shaikh bahnan complained that the bhaikh of Qatar was not observing the agreement in that the tower built by the latter at Zubarah prior to the agree ment was still standing and that he had not returned the arms taken from Bahrain subjects during the disturbances 19 36-37. it appeared at once that there was a fundamental difference of opinion between the two shaikhs regarding the meaning of the phrase 'the Ruler of Qatar undertakes that Zubarah will remain without anything being done in it which had not existed in the past'. Shaikh Hainan maintained that this meant that everything should be restored as i t was before 1936 i.e. that the tower should be destroyed and all property taken should be returned, bhaikh Abdullah on the other hand read it as meaning that he would not dis turb the position as it existed at the time of the signing of the agreement. Major Hickinbotham who was responsible for the framing and execution of the agreement supported and informed bhaikh balman balman had twice told be perfectly satisfied if were withdrawn efforts bhaikh Abdullah’s interpretation accordingly. As however bhaikh Major Hick inbp than that he would the guard in the fort at bubarah were made to persuade bhaikh Abdullah to take this step. He eventually agreed to do so and the guard was withdrawn except for a few watchmen in January 194C, m the mean while in December 1944 a representative from Bahrain had visited ^atar and held discussions with bhaikh Abdullah in a most friendly atmosphere. On the 24th oanuary 1945 bhaikh oalman wrote a letter to bhaikh Abdullah asking for the return of the arms taken from his subjects and the restoration of the situation to what it was in the past, m this letter he referred to Zubarah as 'my country', in his reply bhaikh Abdullah used the following words: / M Wei 2 'Ve have been surprised to see iour Highness referring to Zuharah as your country. Zubarah as everybody knows is an inseparable part of '^atar. it is my country and no yours. 1 ' i\s a result of this ohai-^h caiman sent a s rong protest to the Political Agent Tflho replied on instructions from this Residency that the Political Resident had never supported His Highness 1 claims to the Zuharah area. About this time Shaikh oalman sent some of his subjects to Q.atur to graze their camels and flocks there as they used to do in the past. On their landing they were met by one of Hhaikh Abdullah’s men who told them that they could not leave for Bahrain without his permission. Phis led to another protest from Ohaikh oalman and ever si::ce ne has been addressing the Political Resident and the Political Agent about his 'rights 1 ' in Zubarah. in July 1945 he even tried to make the favourable settlement of his claim to Zubarah a condition precedent to lease of some land to the P.C.h. According to my latest information the ohaikh’s subjects are now travelling to and from ^atar without any interference and the chiei thing that raiki.es m ohaikh Salman’s mind is the existence, of ohaikh Abdullah’s fort- in the Zubarah area. The past history of the case however shows that the A1 Khalif&amp;h’s real object is to get Zubarah recognised as nahrain territory. / Bhaikh Salman’s obsession with the subject amounts almost to mental derangement, and I am to id that the same was the case with his father zhaikh Hamad ^ 4. kor the present i have instructed the Political Agent Bahrain to do his best to find some modus vivendi between Bahrain aud ^atar so as to avoic. if possible a return to the blockade and boycott which existed from to 1944. 1 am afraid that there is little or no prospect that Shaikh Salman will ever cease from troubling us on the subject of Zubarah however definitely ne may be told that his claims to territory on the mainland cannot be suppo rted. 5. i am sending a copy of this letter to the Government of India. i have the honour to be, s ir, lour most obedient servant, Political Resident, Persian Gulf.

Apparently the reconciliation arranged by Major Hickinbotham lasted only a very short time and relations %re now as bad as ever. Hardly a week passes -without the Sheikh mentioning the subject to Mr. Belgrave. There is nothing so far as we can see that we can do aoout it. No doubt the Political authorities on the spot are perfectly well av/are of the Sheikh of Bahrein*s feelings, but according to Mr. Belgrave the subject is one on which the Sheikh feels more deeply than one might have been led to suppose from the papers on this file. 17. /•I -w p tr T r 4 . few.

Fe have not heard of any suggestion that the decision to allot these Islands to Bahrein should he reconsidered, and we have no reason at all to suppose that the Sheikh of Bahrein would he likely to agree to their incorporation in Qatar, It is true that an Agreement for the restoration of friendly relations was signed between the Sheikhs of Qatar and Bahrein last June, hut this did not go into any details, and as far as I know there is no question at the moment of any boundary settlement. The only place specifically moationed was Zubarah. which has long been a bone of contention between them. The question of the dividing line between the territories and territorial waters of Bahrein and Qatar therefore still remain; one for settlement, as we informed Mr, Wheatley when he last enquired in March 1940, I suggest that an answer should be given' to Mr, '.The at ley accordingly, For your own information, it strikes us as very strange that a Bapco representative should express the opinions ascribed to him and we should be interested to know if you have any theories to explain it.

' For some time pase there have been rumours of smuggling of arms, quota goods and slaves throtigh the Qatar Peninsula.

The Ruler of Qatar'v/as oh several' occasions'warned of these reports by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and asked to ta-ke immediate steps to prevent a'position which was illegal and contrary to the interests of his people. From, further reports received in October and also from investigations by the Residency Agent, Shariah, who was deputed to visit Qatar, it became clear that far from co-operating in the prevention of smuggling, the Ruler (or rather his eldest son and heir, Shaikh Hamad, in whose hands power is now nanly centred) and his relatives were both directly and indirectly encouraging it to their profit. Quota cereals, sugar and piecegdods were being re-exported to Persia and to other ports on the Arab side of the Gulf, and goods imported from /IndiaIndia were never landed but sent under fresh manifests to other ports in the Gulf, while the population of Qatar went short. ■ -r ^ ^ ,7 he Ruler °f Qatar has therefore been informed tnat in order to ensure a fair distribution ol quota goods to his people a system of rationing ,JJ1C the control of trie Political Agency, Bahr'iS would be introduced in Qatar, that it is propose.^ tnat a representative of the'Agency should take up , . 1 ■ ''ipeacf; in Qauar and supervise the distri bution of goods through a reliable merchant appointed from Bahrain, and finally that no allotment of quota goods would be made to him or' relatives and their families; it being clear from their previous activities that they were amply supplied with foodstuffs and other commodities. + . /f' ^,.-1 +? ^t-icipated that it will be possible ^• 1 &lt; vKi'? t -+ )aU 'P e s y s . t ' era o;f; ’ rationing shortly. wide publicity nas been given to the action _ taken in order that it may have the greatest deterrent effect.

Reference paragraph 113 of Intelligence Summary No. 12 of 1944. During the Ramadhan it is the present Ruler’s custom to pay and receive calls after sunset. On the 15th His Highness ■signified his desire to call on the Political Agent at 20 minutes past 9 p.m. and during the course of his visit of 3^ hours he touched lightly on the-question of the Shaikh of Qatar's fort at Zubarah. The presence of this fort built a few years ago and garrisoned by Qatari bedouins is some-what galling to the A1 Khalifah. The hunting season is rapidly approaching and His Highness would like to go to Zubarah but he does not like the idea of doing so under the eyes of the representatives of the Shaikh of Qatar. At the same time some of the younger members of the A1 Khalifah are again asking what they will get out of the present agreement and pointing out that His Highness has treated Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah al Thani with the greatest cordiality and more than fulfilled his part of the bargain. His Highness /wouldwould undoubtedly like the fort razed to the ground but it is of course most improbable that the Shaikh of Qatar would ever agree to such a course. The Political Agent has informed His Highness that he will do his best to persuade the Shaikh of Qatar to withdraw the garrison from the fort and possibly to restore some of the arms which he acquired during the troub3 *-=\of 1936. This could be done without'' ue honour of the Bin Thani family being in any way affected and would satisfy His Highness giving him something concrete to show to his hot headed relatives. No reasonable man could object to this course of action but as the Political Agent so well knows neither the Shaikh of Qatar nor his son are reasonable men so it is anticipated that there will be some difficulty in persuading him to agree to the arrangement./ v u,s.s. /7*K HLease see submission at Jxt. 3107/^ regarding the restoration of friendly relations between tne oiieimctis oj. regarding the j 7/ he SlieiMis of //^ Bahrein and Qatar* A letter has now been received from the Political Resident in the Persian G-ulf enclosing attested copies of uie agreement and letters exchanged Detween the Political Agon c. ?

Like all negotiations v^hether in the .Vest or in che Hast there have been times when a solution seemed most improbable but with the exercise of patience nnd with the goodwill of the parties them selves a formula was at last evolved by His Highness Shaikh Sir German bin Hamad Al Khallfah, which restored the status quo ante 1936 without referring to any of the issues between the two Houses. His excellency shaikh Abdullah bin casim Al Ttu-ni, r was eventually persuaded to accept the Al Khnlifah proposition with only n minor alteration. The revised draft was accepted by His Highness Shaikh &gt;alman after consultation with his uncle Shaikh Abdullah bin lea Al Khalifah, r.I.i;., and his Adviser. uhat the futur e will hold it is difficult indeed to foretell but with care and goodwill on both sides it is possible that there will be no further rupture between the two parties for many years.

The Shaikh^of . u atar has a house of his own at Doha but It has not been inha bitted for some years and it was for this reason that he made his temporary headqi arters in a house belonging to a merchant. 2. During my first interview with the Shaikh at about 10.a.m. on the 16th I discussed with him various outstanding problems, in particular the endeavours which were being made to re establish friendly relations between Bahrain and hatar, the question of the children of the : anunitted slave Faraj bin Uadi, and’reports which had been received with regard to the smuggling of cereals, sugar, and piecegoods, from o-atar to Persia. I found the Shaikh inclined to be cooperative and it was not long before the misunderstandings which had occurred over the question of the children of Faraj bin Uadi had been cleared up. A separate communication has been made to the Residency with regard to this case as also has a separate communication been made v/ith regard to the question of reducing the piecegoods, sugar, and cereal quotas for the Qatar peninsula. Our conversation on the subject of Zubarah moved on the usual lihes with much protesting that the Shaikh himself was most anxious to restore relations and more protesting that the aggressors have always been the Al Khalifah. I showed the Shaikh a letter which I had received from the Shaikh of Bahrain making certain new suggestions for the solving of their various differences which was no better received than any of the previous ones had ’'been. In feet it was not at all acceptable. Je therefore deferred any further * reference to this subject until later in t' e day when it was decided tint I shoqld go to Riyan, the Shaikh’s ' eadquarters, before the time for the evening meal and we would then ha ve a full and free discussion .of this difficult subject. Shaikh Hamad the second son and the heir-presumptive was not well and was unable to be present at any of the interviews which I had with the Shaikh himself. Shaikh Hamad'‘ as had trouble with his teeth for some time past and I was given to under stand that he was seriously ill and had been living on a milk I diet for the last seven days, The Shaikh alluded to the unfortunate condition of his son and said that he would like him to come to Bahrain for treatment. I pointed out to the Sh&amp;ikh that the most efficacious way of achieving his object- would be for him, the Shaikh, to write a personal letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain who I felt would be likely to give it reasonable consideration and Shaikh Abd 1 llah said that he‘ would do so, but I am happy to be able to record that up to the present no such communication has been ade and Bahrain has been' spared the difficulties of a visit in the immediate future of such a troublesome person as Shaikh Hamad. lifter conversing for the matter -of an hour and a half the Shaikh said that he would prefer to return to Riyan, the day being Friday, for his -rayers and that he looked forward to seeing me later in the afternoon. 3. At the Shaikh’s request J lunched with Abdullah bin Darwish who is now the right-hand man and co-partner with Shaikh Hamad in practically every' underhand dealing of any — —- 2 - magnitude wh ch takes place in )atar. He and his two v ^‘ r* o^otners assim and ^.bdur Rahrian are atar subjects b 3 r birth 0 V't ^ &gt;e hy origin and all three of them have been/''- gifted with more than average intelligence, khan Bahadur Baiyid^ xibdur Razzaak who accompanied me from Bahrain and Baleh bin iiana the confidant 1 and man-of-affairs of the Shaikh of Qatar were present at lunch. After lunch I returned to the house of Saleh bin ..[ana and there discussed - with irn and Khan Bahadur Saiyid abdur Razzaakfhshe ways and . -^ans of settling the Zubarah question a question of which k I, like .many dozens of others, was heartily sick and my only desire was to either achieve a formula i ediately agreeable to Doth parties or to receive an answer sufficiently J'-' * negative to make it clear to me that any further efforts on my part were pure waste of time. It was fortunate that saieh bin . :ana, who it should be stated is disliked by Shaikh Hamad, came out in quite a different .way to what I mad been med to expect and I hound him most hel ful during mie whole oi my visit, v/e decided that the only reasonable • c y b o_ reaching a decision was to endeavour to get the Shaiij-/,j.

I left by car for Riyan accompanied by Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin mana.

The copy was completed of the draft agreement and at the moment the Shaikh stated quite correctly, for^the call to pra^ e ' could be distinctly hear, that he wished to go and say the evening pxayei . j_eit, but had gone scarce!’ swc mnutes ' en he sent for Saleh bin kana.' -3- 5. The events now to be detailed did not cc .e to light iranediately but 1 have no doubt that tliey are correct. On oaleh bin mna leaving the audience room he was instructed iraed show him the Shaikh by the Shaikh of Qatar to go to shaikh proposed agreement, and instruct him to affix the of Qatar's seal to the document. It is interesting to note that Shaikh Hamad should have succeeded in so far gaining control as to have the custody of that most precious of all the Arab emblems of sovereignty, the signet ring. It appears that Saleh bin ana went, to shaikh Hamad who read the document through, flew into a temper, it .ust be remembered he had severe tooth-ache and has had for some days previously, said that his father had sold the country to the a 1 hhalifah, that me would have no hand in such a proceeding and would not affix the seal. Saleh bin ana having no al ter native re tunned to tj^e mhailih of. ^atar and told him what had occurred with tie result that the old mand was most upset, became querulous and tore the document into pieces which he cast from him. Saleh bin liana returned to Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak and myself and stated briefly what had occurred. Naturally we were both disgusted and disappointed and when the Shaikh returned immediately . prior to the evening : seal I asked him. whether the document had been completed. He became incoherent and it was with difficulty that he lade out that he had decided that he must make various changes in the form and words of the agreement. I protested that he as the Shaikh of Qatar had.given his word, that it was impossible to do business when he changed his mind every half an hour, and that as far as i was concerned the matter m/as ended. Je sat down to dinner, a dismal meal withehost cursing the servants, his son Shaikh Ali behaving more like an elderly ewe than ever, Saleh bin liana and Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak not eating at all, and myself trying to think of sene way out of the impasse. ho further mention was made that evening of the subject but I decided to spend the night in Saleh bin 'ana's house in Doha and to send the launch round to Zubarah to eet me there at about.mid-day on the I7th June. I informed the Shaikh that I proposed to return via Zubarah and that I would call in the next day in the morning on my way to Zubarah in order to say goodbye. 6. That evening I dealt with certain minor business re corded elsewhere and took coffee at the house of Mohammed al hana where I et one arzook bin Shamlan a Kuwaiti who was undoubtedly in Qatar in connection with piecegoods. No mention was made that night to Saleh bin hana of the incident which had occurred at Riyan and silence was maintained the next morning until he himself reopened the subject. We made it^ clear to him .hat we had no intention of. reopening the subject ourselves but in case the Shaikh of afar had thought better of matters I was giving him a last opportunity by calling at Riyan on . y wa; to Zubarah. At approximately half past eight on the morning of the 17th I left for Zubarah via Riyan. On our arrival at Riyan we were again mos cordially received by the old Shaikh and after the inter change of compliments appropriate to the occasion one of thos secret whispered conversations which a?e always a feature of such discussions took pl; Ce between oaleh bin Liana and our host the outcome of which was that our host turned to me and siad that he wanted to speak about the Zubarah agreement. We started all over again and eventually he agreed to the formula of the evening before with an exception and that area*exception was the deleting of the word M *?.fUI'JTAQAB ,r . This was moderately satisfactory although not as pleasant as had been the prospect of the night before, but I felt that the deletion of that particular word night be cci sidered as advantageous to the a 1 khalifah rather than the reverse a d to accept. .Once again the ceremony of copying was gone-4- through, once again caHe the time for signature, an'd at the suggestion of Khan Bahadur Saiyid nbdur Razzaak the Shaikh of atar signed the document in the present of his son Ali, oaleii bin ana, Khan ,ahadur baiyic. iibdur l§.zzaa a d myself. He then said to Shaikh Ali M Talze this paper, show it to Hamad, and tell him to seal it'. Shaikh Ali took’ the paper and there was some swift thinking. I turned to the Shaikh and said n It is really unnecessary. Ycvr Excellency has signed which is better t ian any seal.” Here was an irmiediate chorus from Khan Bahadur ^aiyici Abdur Razzaak and Saleh bin liana of approval and Shaikh Ali stood in the _ doorway uncertain which v/ay to go until to the relief of ail of us the Shaikh of datar said ' It matters not'hand the document passed into my keeping. Just before I left I asked the Shaikh v/hejher there was any chance of his going back on what had, nov/ been agreed and he assured me that there was no chance whatever. 7. he left Riyan at a quarter to ten and arrived at Zubarah at approximately 1 o’clock to find the launch waiting and four and a half hours later we were back here in Bahrain, ^t is v/orthy of record that although the return trip was most The launch rolled in a really incredible manner to the music of break! g china and cf moving furniture with the result':, that with the exception of khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, our pilot, and muself every person in the vessel including the crew were overcome by the movement which was certainly remark ably unpleasant until we rounded Ras Rukn at 12-30 a.m. on the morning of June 16th. comfortable the outward trip to Doha was quite the reverse Sd.

He had apparently recently had a visit from a well informed (atari who had been describing conditions there ano mentioned that they were somehow able to export cereals ana sugar on a considerable scale.

Shaikh Said bin Maktum of Dubai recently passed through Bahrain on his way to visit Ibn Saud. Ibn Saud evidently spoke to him about the distressful quarrel that continues to divide Bahrain and Qatar and, according to a letter from Shaikh Said to His Highness the Shaikh of Bahrain, he invited Shaikh Said to try his hand at a reconciliation between the two States. A less promising arbitrator could scarcely have been chosen. The Bahrain Shaikhs regard Said as a poor fish and the Shaikh of Qatar has an equally low opinion of him. Said went to Qatar and wrote to the Shaikh of Bahrain that he would address him again after talking over the matter with the Shaikh of Qatar. No letter has arrived and the episode can now be written off. Ibn Saud has for a long time been anxious to see Bahrain and Qatar on better terms but seems to have no constructive ideas about how to fix it. A good many people on both sides will have to pass on to another world before Bahrain and Qatar are really friendly again. Fortunately it is a matter of little practical importance.COPY. / JO*- (E 7593/7593/91). No. 2607/1177/10. British Legation Jedda, Saudi Arabia October 28th, 1939 My dear Baxter, You will remember the friendly interest that Ibn Saud takes in the Zubara dispute between Bahrain and Qatar, This is mentioned in my despatch No. 18 (222/469/3) dated February 1st, 1938. There is also a reference which I cannot now trace, in a despatch about a later conversation with Ibn Saud himself on that and other subjects. Shaikh Yusuf referred to the subject just before I left Riyadh. He said that Ibn Saud had spoken about it, not officially, of course, but personally, to the Political Agent at Bahrain when he was there in May, and he now wished to give me a personal message, reminding me of the interest which he as ?n Arab ruler takes in the matter and expressing the hope that His Majesty’s G-overnment would be able to bring about a settlement. I accepted this communication as a personal message and thanked Shaikh Yusuf for it, and added that the King could hardly suppose that His Majesty’s Government viewed with anything but regret the continuation of a dispute between two of the Arab rulers in the Persian Gulf. A copy of this letter is being sent to the political Resident in the Gulf, and a copy to the Political Agent at Bahrain. Yours ever, (Signed) R.W.Bullard. G.W.

U' vr« „\v, 1 ji D&gt; lolitical Agent, Kuwait, reports that in the news broadcast from Home on the night on 13th October, the Arabic Announcer gave the following as his last item of news: 11 Ahmad al Jabir as Subah, the Bmir of Kuwait has been praised by the Egyptian and other newspapers on his attempt to settle the dispute between Bahraiii and ^atar in the Persian Gulf' 1 . 2. This announcement no doubt refers to either of two attempts made by the Shaikh of Kuwait to mediate between the Shaikhs of Bahrain and ^atar; (a) a letter written to the Shaikhs of Bahrain and gatar last Tune to the effect that they should arrive at an amicable settle ments and (b) a more recent letter to the Shaikh of Bahrain suggesting that he souid visit Bahrain in order to irrediate between the 'ttulers of Bahrain and ^atar. The Shaikh of Bahrain does not welcome a visit from his brother Shaikh at the present time and certainly would not go to him for mediation. He has sent a polite re^ly putting off the Shaikh of Kuwait. (Signature) „ , isnovmisK I IN.J; J A S. 44. MFP—1374 S&amp;P—(M-2043)—15-1-36—10,000.

With reference to paragra ; h 3 of the May Intellrrence Report, at the end of June negotiations finally broke dov/n. The Sheikh of Qatar, alleging that the Haim had broken the peace, attacked them with 7000 of his armed followers. The Haim put up a very poor fight and after a small number of casualties had been sustained by both sides, they surrendered. The Sheikh of Qatar has ordered them to surrender their arms and told them that they are free to remain in Qatar under his rule or evacuate to Bahrain. At present there are no signs of them wishing to leave Qatar. H.M.S.DEPTFORD went to Doha with orders to ensure the safety of British subjects. There, however, turned out to be only one, a Baluchi barber, who stated that even in the event of trouble his wife would not allow him to leave. Actually there was no trouble though at first the visit of DEPTFORD was viewed with suspicion by the notables as they would not oelieve that a sloop would be sent merely to protect one barber and they thought H.M.Government w re not remaining entirely neutral. The Sheikh and notables in Bahrain think that H.M. Government let them down by preventing them sending armed forces to the assistance of the Naim, though in point of fact the/(S.fl.O.f.G. i the Sheikh of Qatar outwitted them hyjbhe speed with which he defeated the Nairn. They are also very incensed that the Haim should have put up such a poor fight and now show no inclination to emigrate to Bahrain. Though Zuoarah is a poor place in itself having only a ruined mud fort and some indifferent wells, it is of considerable sentimental value to the Khalifah fanily as it was from there that they came over and took Bahrain Island. From that point of view^Lt may be regarded as their native heath. All the Bahrain pearling dhows were recalled in case of trouble, but now all is quiet they will be sent back to the banks. They have utilised this period to refit and restore, which is normally carried out once during the diving season. No further trouble is anticipated and there were no disturbances in Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. No. 54 6 0 f IS 37. 7 The Hon’ble the Political Kesident' in the Persian Gulf presents his compliments to 1.

Beckett takes the view that the dispute is one between two British protected states - two entities which from the international point of view are really inside the British Empire. It is analogous to a dispute between tv/o Malay States and clearly it is the very essence of the position which we maintain with regard to them under which we stand between them and foreign powers, that His Majesty*s Government must when necessary decide disputes between them and can permit no recourse to any outside authority at all. 3./ M.

In it Sir Trenchard Fowle reports a farther communication from • the Sheikh of Bahrein and suggests a revised reply to His Highness. The Sheikh's question when, and by whom, his claim to Zubarah will be adjudicated is a difficult one to answer. Sir Trenchard Fowle suggests that we should reply to the effect that H.T.G. will consider his claim Zubarah. The other Departments concur in the actionIn point of fact, we do not want to intervene at Zubarah, and we are of opinion that it is undoubtedly within the Sheikh of Qatar’s dominions.

Under orders of His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council I have the honour to again call your attention to the correspondence on the subject of your interference with affairs of the Mainland of Guttur and in particular the town of Zobarah viz. my letter dated 12th December 1874 and 12th March 1875. From your letter dated 23rd March 1875 last I apprehended that you had failed to realise the full meaning of the ccmmunications I had addressed to you on this subject and the importance to yourself of entirely dissevering yourself from the affairs of the Mainland, - interference in which might any day lead you into complications. I therefore addressed you a further communication dated 31st March 1875. I cannot doubt that you must have fully comprehended now the view r s and advice which I have tendered you by order of the Government of India. But notwithstanding this it appears that you still take proceedings with regard to Zobarah which obviously entangle you in the affairs of the Mainland. As then the advice you received through me must have been quite understood by you, and as you do not as yet appear to have fully abided by it, it becomes necessary under orders of the Government of India to explain to you as clearly as possible that if you should decide to persist in a course opposed to the advice of the Government of India and are thereby involved in complications on the Mainland, the consequences will be upon yourself, and the British \ Government/f Government will hold themselves free to take such measures with respect to you as they may think necessary. My feeling of friendship and wish for your welfare and good, prompts me to desire that so important a communication as this should reach you as early as possible, and also that you should have every facility for fully comprehending it. I am therefore sending Captain Fraser, my Assistant, in a Government vessel to visit you and am trusting to him this letter which he will deliver to you with my earnest and friendly recommendation that you will give its contents the consideration their importance deserves. Trusting you are in good health and prosperity, (Signed) E.C.Ross, Lieut.Colonel, H.B.M.’s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. True Copy. (Sgd.) E.A.Fraser, Lt. Assistant Resident.From Sheikh Esau 'bin All A1 Khalifah, Chief of Bahrain, To Lieut .Colonel E.C.Boss, ' H.B.M.'s Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Dated 14th June 1875. After greetings, Let it be known to you that your esteemed letter of the 31st May 1875, favoured by Captain Fraser, your Assistant, has reached us and its contents have been understood. Your expressions of friendship and goodwill render us deeply grateful, as also your counsels which are replete with benefit. After receiving your letter we called on Captain Fraser, who made clear to us the meaning and purport of your letter which we understand to be that Government, having in view our good and advantage,had deemed it advisable to prohibit interference in affairs on the Mainland and especially at Zobarah. We have obeyed and followed the order, and will not endeavour except in subjection; and our purpose is, in conformity with your order, to abandon the affairs of Zobarah and interference therein completely. God willing we will not, so long as we live, engage in any matter disapproved of by Government, nor will we do anything for (?) that may involve us in trouble. But/the British Government we have neither asylum nor protection. The reason of our not interfering in the affairs of Zobarah at this time is simply obedience to the orders of Government, not that our rights have become invalid or extinct. We trust that the British Government will be propitious to us and permit us to possess it (Zobarah) again for it has been ours fran ancient times and we have now yielded of necessity. That/That these matters may he made manifest to you we have sent our brother, Sheikh Ahmed bin Ali to you on s visit. We consider him as ourself in all things and he will explain to you certain of our wants and wishes for the information of Government. We trust you will always continue to be favourably disposed towards us. Translated from the Arabic. (Sgd.) E.A.Fraser, Lieut. Assistant Resident. Bahrain, June 14th 1875. True Copy. (Sgd.)

Prima facie these terms, which, generally speaking, would preserve the status quo of about six men ths ago, before the present dispute arose, seem to me to be reasonable and unobjectionable from the point of view of His Majesty’s Government, and I imagine that His Majesty’s Government would much prefer a friendly compromise of this nature between the two Rulers, rather than that they (His Majesty’s Government) should have to give a definite decision in favour of either party. /- 2 - party* v 4 0 I will report in due course further developments. 5.

I explained the situation to the Shaikh of Qatar in the same way. Should, as a result of these conversations, an agreement between the on parties be come to on the above terms, or^aby other which are unobjectionable to His Majesty’s Government, then this agreement will presumably require the formal approval of His Majesty’s Government.

'T Before the arise of the present situation the Political Agent, Bahrain, received a letter from the Shaikh of Bahrain, dated the 14th April 1937, a copy of which I enclose* 3* Prom an informal conversation which I had with Mr. Belgrave previous to the present situation arising the Bahrain claim to Zubarah appears to be as follows, though of course this cannot be taken as either final or comprehensive until we get an official letter on the subject from the Bahrain Government. Briefly, the Bahrain. Govemment state (1) that fer many years past the Naim tribe of Bahrain origin, and members of whom live in Bahrain, are practically the sole inhabitants of Zubarah (2) that the Naim at Zubarah pay no taxes, including customs. {Signature) to / {Designation)to the Shaikh of Qatar., Nor does the Shaikh of Qatar insist on travel papers for Bahrain subjects visiting Zubarah (3) that the Naim tribe obey the orders of the Shaikh of Bahrain, in support of which statement the Bahrain Government quote that many years ago the tribe obeyed the orders of Shaikh •Isa, then Ruler of Bahrain, not to occupy the Zubarah fort, which they wished to do. Further, that the Naim tribe generally obey the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain. The Bahrain Government, however, admit that they do not administer or take taxes at Zubarah. 4. MT. Belgrave informed me, unofficially of course, that the Shaikh would be quite willing to give us an assurance that his claim to Zubarah would not in any way interfere with the rights of the Qatar Oil Company nor their operations. This is of course a point of some practical importance. 5. I instructed Colonel Loch to approach Mr. Packer, Chief Local Representative, Qatar Oil Company, and ascertain whether the Company had in fact any intention of making Zubarah into a port (see copy of Shaikh’s letter referred to in paragraph 2 above). Mr. Packer informed Colonel Loch that the Company had no present intention of doing this. I therefore instructed Colonel Loch to inform the Shaikh accordingly and to add that in these circumstances the question raised by His Highness did not appear to arise. 6. I had hoped that by this line of action the thorny question of the ownership of Zubarah would remain quiescent, and that His Majesty’s Government would be able to avoid giving / \-3- giving a definite awaxd either in favour of the Ruler of Bahrain or the Ruler of Qatar* Present developments have made this more difficult but it may be still possible to arrange a compromise between the two Rulers on lines which Captain Hickinbotham has suggested, and on which I will report later® In the meantime the following summary of the dispute may be of use to His Mhjeety’s Goverrment and the Government of India* 7* With regard to the connection of the Ruling Family of Bahrain with zubarah, see Lorimer’s M Gazetteer of the Persian and Gulf H , Volume 1, Part 1, pages 798-818,^the correspondence connected with Government of India letter No® 1145-E.A*,dated the 5th May 1920 to Shaikh ’Abdullah bin ’Isa* Briefly, the Al Khalifah family first invaded Zubarah from Uejd in 1766, and thence captured Bahrain in 1782 from the Persians. Subsequently a member of the family. Shaikh Muhammad, tfio was expelled from Bahrain by his grand uncle. Shaikh ’Abdullah, the Ruler, re-built the town in 1842 (Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 799), Early in 1843 he returned to Bahrain, defeated and expelled Shaikh ’Abdullah (ibid page 869) and seized the Sheikhdom of Bahrain which at that time included Qatar. MUhammad ruled in Bahrain until 1868,when he was expelled consequent on an ultimatum from the British Govern ment, and was succeeded by his brother Ali,grandfather of the present Ruler /Ruler of Bahrain (ibid page 895). In about 1868 the A1 Thani family, who had gradually been rising to power, attained predominant influence over the other Qatar Shaikhs ( ibid page 802)* The Al Thani, however, apparently still acknowledged ins ome sort the suzerainty of Bahrain since in the same year there is mention that the tribute, if any, payable by the Chiefs of Qatar to Bahrain should be determined before the Resident. This state of affairs continued until 1871 (ibid page 802) • 8* As fax back as 1873 (Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 815) the Government of India expressed their concurrence in the view that the Shaikh of Bahrain had no clear or important rights in Qatar, and this was conveyed to Shaikh •Isa, then Ruler of Bahrain, in 1875, vide the last sentence of paragraph 2 of page 816 of Lorimer^s Gazetteer, Volume 1, Part 1. » In 1895 (vide Lorimer, Volume 1, Part 1, page 923) the Turks, in combination with Shaikh Jasim ath Thani, Ruler of Qatar, concentrated a force at Zubarah for the invasion of Bahrain. With them were a section of the Al Bin Ali, a Bahrain tribe who had migrated to Qatar and were hostile to the Ruler of Bahrain. His Majesty's Government came to the assistance of the Ruler and prevented the threatened invasion by the bombardment and destruction by Sloops of the fleet of dhows which had been collected for the descent on Bahrain. 10. It will probably be useful for His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to have my views as to the merits of the rival claims. (a) It can be conceded (vide paragraph 7 above) that until 1868 Bahrain held part of Qatar , including Zubarah, and from then until 1871 the Qatar Shaikhs headed by the Al Thani, acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahrain by being prepared to pay tribute. (t) /5 ►* (b) Since about that date i*e. 1871 the A1 Than! (the present ruling family of Qatar) have held Qatar, including Zubarah, and in 1875 the important announcement mentioned in paragraph 9 above was made to the Shaikh of Bahrain* (c) The action which His Majesty’s Government had to take in 1895 on behalf of the Bahrain Goverrment shows clearly that at that date the Bahrain Govern ment, far from having any control over Zubarah, were actually threatened by invasion from that place* (d) With regard to the Bahrain case, see paragraph 3 (1), (2) and (3) above* The fact that on a single occasion the Naim tribe obeyed the orders of the Ru}.er of Bahrain seems to me to prove little or nothing. Prima facie the further argument that in addition to this specific case, the Naim, generally speaking, obey the orders of the Ruler of Bahrain, would seem to carry some weight* Where, however, certain sections of an Arab tribe have migrated from the territory of one Shaikh to that of another, they still consider themselves as owing some vague allegiance to their original Shaikh and are generally subject to his influence. The Bahrain Dowas ir tribe, for instance, some years ago being on bad terms with the Ruler of Bahrain, emigrated to Hasa* While there they doubtless received messages from the Ruler of Bahrain and evidently considered themselves as owing some allegiance to him, since finally they asked /6 - *MfP asked his permiseion to return to Bahrain. But this sort of allegiance on the part of the Dowasir naturally gives no claim to the Shaikh of Bahrain to the part of Hasa occupied by them. The fact that the Shaikh of Qatar takes no taxes from the inhabitants of Zubarah and does not insist on travel papers perhaps carries more weight, but appears to me far from conclusive, and probably merely indicates a desire on his part to avoid trouble with the Naim tribe and complications with the Bahrain Government. This attitude, induced by considerations of practical convenience, does not appear to me materially to weaken in principle his juridical ownership of Zubarda. Lastly, the Bahrain Government admit that they do not administer or take taxes at zubarah. In this respect, therefore, their claim is considerably weaker than that in the somewhat analogous case of Hawar. 11. Personally, therefore, I am of the opinion that juridically the Bahrain claim to Zubarah must fail. IS. Prcm another and practical point of view His Majesty’s Government, by their endorsement of the Q^tar Oil Concession, would seem to be committed both to the Shaikh of Qatar and to Petroleum Development (Qatar) Limited, to the recognition of the ownership of zubarah by the Shaikh of Qatar. It may be possible to surmount this difficulty in view of the Shaikh of Bahrain’s readiness to give the assurance referred to in para graph 4 above. IS. A political consideration on the Bahrain side is as follows. /-Y- followB. Colonel Loch informs me that there is considerable feeling, both on the part of the Shaikh and of his family, on the subject of Zubarah, and is of opinion that if a decision were given in favour of Qatar they (the Shaikh and his family/ will have a lasting grievance against us. Colonel Loch further points out that the Al Khalifah are our best friends on the Arab Coast and that it would be most unfortunate if this sense of grievance came into being. It is true that if His Majesty's Covernnent gave a decision in favour of Bahrain, the Shaikh of Qatar and his family would likewise have a sense of grievance, but from the political point of view Bahrain is of considerably more importance to us than Qatar. 14&lt;» I agree generally with Colonel Loch's views but this consideration does not alter my personal opinion that if the compromise mentioned in paragraph 6 fails, and His Majesty's Government have to make an award, it should be in favour of Qatar subject to any further arguments which Bahrain can adduce, vide my paragraph 3 above. sd.

A rough scale map of Qatar, showing the position of Zubarah, is attached. The Sheikh of Bahrein appears to have taken up a strictly correct attitude in the matter, and for present purposes it is unnecessary to go into the merits of the long-standing Bahrain claim to Zubarah. It will perhaps suffice at this stage to mention that * * ■ in 1919 certain claims to Zubarah were put forward on behalf of the Sheikh of Bahrain, and that it was then decided that the Bahrain claim could not be sustained, and that the area in question belonged to the Sheikh of Qatar. We can, it is suggested, approve the measures taken by the Resident to meet the situation which has arisen, and at this stage there seems no reason to dissent from the views expressed in paragraph 3 of his telegram of the 28th April. The attitude to be adopted by His Majesty*s Government in the event of (a) the Naim offering armed resistance to the Sheikh of Qatar; or (b) wholesale migration of the tribe to Hasa; may require further consideration. Pending a further report from the Resident all that seems required at this stage is a general endorsement of the measures taken to meet the situation, and if the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Air Ministry concur we might reply to the Resident on the lines of the attached telegram.DRAFT TELEGRAM.

Naim tribe living at Zubarah, to state his loyalty to him {the Shaikh) or be punished* (b) Attitude of Naim is reported to be that, if they do not receive support from the Shaikh of Bahrein against the Shaikh of Qatar, they will ’‘adhere to Ibn Saud'* They are stated to have complained to Saud Bin Jiluwi, Governor of Has a, against the Shaikh of Qatar* This seems not unlikely, but a further rumour that the Shaikh of Qatar has similarly complained to Jiluwi against Naim seems to me doubtful* {cr) Naim, numbering about 1,000 (the men being (? armed)) with camels and flocks have concentrated at Zu'barah 0 This appears to me to indicate a possible migration cf Naim to Hasa* Alternatively Naim may be collecting to resist thethe Shaikh of Qatar, in which case there may be a fight at Zubarah. (d.) Individual from HO.ffuf states that about 24th April Jiluwi sent party of 70 armed oamel^men to Q ; a.tar ft object unknown but, since it is also rumoured that there is some trouble near Dohah between the Shaikh of Qatar and a. tribe who claim adherence to Ibn Saud, party may have been sent in this connection. I do not think it likely, however, that party will actually enter Qatar territory. r. ' . ' (e) Political Agent, Bahrein, has sent letter to the Shaikh of Qatar saying that he is reporting the situation to me and that, in the meantime. Sheikh should keep his people quiet. (f) Political Agent, Bahrein, with my approval is also sending a further letter to the Sheikh of Qatar advising him not to send his people to the Zubarah area and is addressing a letter to the Sheikh of Bahrein asking him to recall certain servants of his who have juat gone to Zubarah, and I to stop repairing the fort there, pending the result of investigation of the matter. 3. I ‘do not feel we should interfere if Nairn emigrates to Saudi Arabia. Bor am I of the opinion that we should take any forcible measure against either side in the event of a clash between Naim and Shaikh of Qatar (see paragraph (c) above). Political Agent, Bahrein, however „ should of course continue his efforts at persuading all parties concerned to keep peace. In particular Shaikh of Bahrein should be prevented from sending reinforcements to the Bairn at Zubarah, which, apart from other considerations, would be against his treaty of 1861 as it would involve a breach of (7 maritime) peace. li fighting bj.es 4 .es ouc in Qatar and members ofof Qatar Oil.

Zubarah was said to have 'considerable sentimental value' (folio 68) to the Al Khalifah family, as they originally came from there to take over Bahrain; however, in both 1875 and 1919 it had been decided by the British Government that the Shaikh of Bahrain's claims to Zubarah could not be substantiated (folios 136 and 128). The file contains India Office minutes on the subject, and correspondence and reports from, in particular, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Political Agent, Bahrain.The papers include: tensions caused by unrest at Zubarah among the Naim [Āl Na‘īm] tribe, who acknowledged the sovereignty of Bahrain; a letter from the Political Resident (Lieutenant-Colonel Trenchard Craven William Fowle) summarising the history of Bahrain's claim (folios 125-131); reports of negotiations between the two sides concerning the claim, and British opinion on the matter; the need to avoid weakening the British case for the integrity of the Qatar peninsula against Ibn Saud [Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd] (folio 83); reports that the Naim had submitted to the Ruler of Qatar, July 1937; the implications of the dispute for the Qatar and Bahrain Unallotted Area oil concessions; reports of an attempted mediation in the dispute by the Shaikh of Kuwait, October-November 1937; the risk of a linkage between the dispute and Qatar's claim to the Hawar Islands (folio 41); an account of negotiations conducted by the Political Agent, Bahrain (Major Tom Hickinbotham), which led to the signing of an agreement by the rulers of Bahrain and Qatar [Salmān bin Ḥamad Āl Khalīfah and ‘Abdullāh bin Jāsim Āl Thānī, respectively] to restore friendly relations, June 1944 (letter and text of agreement, folios 24-28, and folio 16); and the statements that relations between the two rulers were now 'as bad as ever' (folio 6) and that the Zubarah question was 'by no means settled' (folio 4), 1945-46.The Arabic language content of the file consists of a single letter from the Political Agent, Bahrain (folio 17).The file also contains copies of correspondence dated 1875 (folios 91-94).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year.
