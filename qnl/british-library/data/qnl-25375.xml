The increased charges were continued up to the end of the iinancial year 1918-19, but it is regretted that, through an oversight, this was not at the time reported for the information of the Secretary of State. 3. The Political fiesident in the Persian Gulf has represented that on account of further rises in the prices of foodstuffs, gram ana -odder, an' q the adverse exchange, the present sanction-: od expenditure under fiscorts is insufficient and has asked that the grants may he increased to the extent indicated in the following statement Original Increased Actual Actual sanctipned expenditure expenditure exrendi- expenditure, sanctioned in 1918—19. tube in r, i an rr ^ it: expe Bs. 9000 13000 7200 3800 33000 in 1917.

Bs. 12000 20450 11880 4000 48330 The excess expenditure in 1918-19 and 1919-20 was met by r r appropriation and was occasioned by the ’ugh cost of commoditiesi m commodities and salarias and the adverse exchange. The AX proportionate increase in the case of Kerman is due to the j strength of the escort.which is normally 1 non-commissioned office- and 5 sowars, having been increased to 2 non-commission- Oxficers and 10 sowars. It does not appear possible to reduce the no-man escort again as yet, hut this will be done as so n as the situation in Persia permits. 4. It will be seen that the proposed grants show a considerable reduction on the actual expenditure in the last two years. The amount of the grants has been arrived at after careful consideration in consultation with the Resident in the Persian Gulf, and it is not possible to effect any further economy until prices.drop or until the political situation permits of a reductionin the strength of the Xerman Kseort. A proposal is, hpwever, under consideration for replacing the Indian Cavalry Escort at Ahwaz by locally recruited sowars; should this mature, it would be possible to effect's considerable ) further saving*. 5.

The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has represented that in consequence of the rise in the prices of foodstuffs, grain and fodder, and of the abnormal fall in the exchange value of the rupee, the expenditure on account of ration money paid to the sowars and the feed and keep of horses, has increased to such an extent that the present grants for escort charges are Bushire, from Rs. 9,000 to Es. io.sso. quite inadequate. He has accordingly Ahw az , from r 8 . 7 ,200 to Es. 8,300. asked that they may he increased as Bimder Abbas, from Rs. 3,800 to Rs. 4,550. • i • l i • n ^ as indicated m the margin. . 3. After giving our careful consideration to the matter we agree with the Political Resident that the cost of the escorts at Bushire, Ahwaz and Bunder Abbas cannot be kept within the sanctioned allotments. The increases have been proposed with all possible regard to economy, and we recommend that they may he sanctioned with effect from the 1st April 1917, subject to reconsideration at the end of the current financial year, or at the termination of the war if peace is declared before April 1918. 1. 2 . s.SIMLA.

Bering* Since the outbreak of the war, the work of this consulate has greatly increased. After careful consideration, I feel justified in stating that it h&amp;» very nearly trebled in volume. Since 1913, shortage of staff has rendered it impossible for a vice consul or assistant to be stationed at Chiengmai, and though the situation has to some extent been relieved by the engagement of an assistant Burmese clerk in 1916, nevertheless the duties of Kong Ba Thwln are now not only more onerous, but also more important, than they were in former times. Their increased importance is due to the fact that I have been compelled, owing to pressure of work, to entrust Mong Ba Thwin with many duties which are usually performed by a Consular Officer. For instance, the Foreign Office and Office of Vforks accounts are now entirely in his hands*1 o n q o v i o u o b ..

Part of the extra ir/ork has been net by the appointment of an assistant clerk, but even allowing for this, more extra work than would, before the war, have fallen to the lot of a consular assistant has been divided between the consul and the head clerk# In those six years, a sum of not less than £2400 (at least) would have been paid to an assistant, load one been available for Chlengmai • This sum has been saved, but the work for which It would normally have been paid has been duly perfonned-and half at the least, of that work has been performed by Hong Ba Thwin, £1200, if invested at 5 y &lt;* would produce £60 a year, which even at the present rate (fcs.10 to the £) means Ticals 50 a month#*• U I D.C «Lo. -1055-a.

The sum of four thousand two hundred pounds has been transferred to the account of the Secretary of State for India in Council at the Bank of England. The basic contribution for the subsequent years is also reduced £2,687.10*0.to two thousand, six hundred and eighty seven pounds, ten shillings per annum. 2. For the year 1914-1915 it is considered that no refund of the contribution should be made as the expenditure at Basrah during that year did not cease immediately on the £1,672.0*0. outbreak of war with Turkey, and amounted to one thousand, six hundred and seventy two pounds. 3. In regard to the annual contribution of three £320*0.0* hundred and twenty pounds per annum made towards the extra cost of consular representation at Chiengmai, I am to state that the work for which this contribution is intended to provide has actually been performed, if not by a vice-consul stationed at Chiengmai then by the consul himself. Equivalent Ihe Under-Secretary of State,Equivalent expenditure has actually 'been incurred in other directions, for not only has it been necessary to arrange that a vice consul from Bangkok should proceed to Chiengmai to take charge during the absences of the consul on tour, but it has also been necessary to engage additional clerical assistance at that consulate and the wages bill has been almost doubled. Further, the consul was obliged to postpone his leave owing to the impossibility of making suitable arrangements to relieve him and as a result this department was obliged to grant him substantial concessions in.the matter of leave pay. It is therefore considered that this contribution should continue to be paid and I am to express the hope that, in view of the explanations given, Lord Peel will agree. 4. In the claim for expenditure incurred by the Government of India during the year 1915-1916, put forward in your letter No. P.2314 of September 16th, last, a charge appears for the pay and allowances of a special officer to replace Mr. Knox at Bushire; I am however to point out that Mr. Knox’s salary appears to have been charged as well, although it should presumably have been paid from Basrah revenues. A refund is therefore apparently due to this department in respect of this item and I am to request that the necessary transfer may be made separately, in order to avoid an alteration of the figures of the annual adjustment. I am, Sir, Your obedient ServantINDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL. S.W.l. 27th March, 1923. Tear hr.
