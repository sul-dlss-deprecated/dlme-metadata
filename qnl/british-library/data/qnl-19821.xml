In spite of this Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah with a few followers proceeded to Kalba. From what I knew of him I felt that if he were given enough rope he would sooner or later hang himself which he proceeded to do by getting into such difficulties with the local inhabitants that finally he had to appeal to me for a sloop to aid him \ Officer a sloop was sent which under my instructions has brought the Shaikh to Bahrain where he is being kept suitably housed but not permitted to receive any visitors. the last two years he has been of definite assistance to the Roy^l Air Force and Imperial Airways, and as the only drastic action open to us would be to depose him which would be more than his deserts and would be undesirable for various reasons, I propose allowing him to return to Ras al Khaimah after he has given an explanation of his conduct to the Political Agent Bahrain and received a severe warning from the latter.

Political Resident, Bushire From To No. 230 Dated and received 25th June 1937. Your telegram of June d . 620. I Interviewed Shaikh of Has al Khaimah this morning June 25th. He appeared chastened. He said that while I was at Ras al Khaimah he received intimation of a kidnapping at Wadi Alghur. After I left he went to deal with Kidnappers of the Beni Chab. There are two roads to this V.adi and he chose the one through Kalba as he wished to mourn for his brother-in-law Shaikh Said. He admitted receiving instructions from you not to interfere in Kalba affairs. He found Kalba in a disturbed state. He dis cussed family affairs with the daughter of Shaikh Said who is the wife of Khalid ex-Shaikh of Sharjah. Barut overhearing and misconstruing this conversation fled. Owing to the people's fear of Bedouin attack and the disturbed state of the country he asked for a sloop. He said he had no intention of becoming Ruler of Kalba and would not even do so if he were asked. When confronted with a letter in his own handwriting addressed to an agent of his and intercepted by Residency Agent after the Shaikh had embarked in H.M.S. Shoreham asking for signatures to be collected from people to the effect that they wished for him as their guardian he said lie had told the Kalba people that they should choose either himself as guardian for minor or an individual who should/be under his orders. He claimed ii/adi Alghur as partly his property and partly that of Kalba. *&gt;• He asid that at the request of wife of Khalid he had made a list of household effects of late Shaikh as he claimed a share in them and also to safe guard interest of minqr. ^ He gave me letter said to have been sent pre- • viously asking him to be Shaikh of Kalba. I am having it translated. 5. He asked permission to visit Shaikh of Bahrain and other persons and I have refused pending instructions from you.

(b;0n arrival at halba Shaikh Jultan bin ^alim wrote representations on which he, by means of bribery, propaganda and indirect threat and pressure, obtamea signatures fron some oi tne local people and Persian residents ol Kalba to the efiect that they wished Shaikh -ultan to take charge ol the stale until the boy attains puberty. He was assistea by one Muhammad Ya T qub , a relative of the late IQian Bahadur Isa bin Abdul la til'. Shaikh Sultan tried to get the signatures ol iarut, but he refused to do so ana ran away from Kalba. lie was accompanied by:- v lj Ahmad bin Ma tar of Za'ab, Shaikh Khaur ilalba.

Shaikh Sultan sent ^alman the uncle oi the boy Hamad with one of his followers by name Khali an bin ^ani T in order to get Dack Barut and his companions. 8. After making the above eqnuiries, I returned to H.Ll.S.Shoreham ana informed the S.N.O. The latter then asked the Shaikh to sena for the rest of his personal followers to come on board. The S.N.O. also asked me to go dov/n and bring them. The ShaiKh sent Bilal bin Barut witn a verbal message to his men and a chit to Ainin bin aII of the Customs. On the way i noticed tne chit in the belt ol Bilal ana after talking nicely to him 1 took it away from him and did not return it to him. The following4. is the translation ot tne note:- ''Amin, write letters to Abaur imzzaq irom all tne Arabs and Persians to the el feet that they do not want be governed (it means also protected) by any person other tnan by Sultan bin Galim- C/et their thumb impressions ana seals.

They are ten. x'wo were grazing the camels ana were lelt behind to take the camels to Ras-al-I^iiaiaah. 10, Tne Fort is in charge of the Na^biym.The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah informed that during vay visit to Ras al Khaimah a certain individual by name Ma'dhad bin Din came and informed him that a case of kidnapping had occurred in the Wadi al Ghur, that in view of my presence he was unable to attend to it immediately but did so after I had left. The Wadi al Ghur is Jointly owned by himself and the Shaikh of Kalba. The tribe concerned in the kidnapping were the Bani Cha^b. In order to reach Wadi al Ghur there were two ways but he chose the Kalba way as he wished to mourn the death of his brother-in-law the late Shaikh of Kalba • As he arrived in Kalba he found Kalba in a disturbed condition. He discussed matters with the daughter of the late Shaikh who is the wife of Khalid, fhe ex-Shaikh of Shar jah, and asked her why she did not go to her husband as they had been estranged for some time, and that as her father was now dead she should go to her husband. Baroot the Head Slave of the late Shaikh of Kalba heard this conversation and immediately ran away as he thought that the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah had come with a view to making Khalid Shaikh of Kalba. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah informed me that he had no intention of becoming Shaikh of Kalba and would not do so even if he had been asked. The Shaikh handed me some letters which he stated would show that the people had asked him previously to become their ruler. I made it quite clear with the Shaikh that this statement was correct and asked him once or twice. I then showed him a letter which had been written by himself to Andn and which had been intercepted by Abdur Rezzaq and he stated that he had written it and that in view of the state of the/--2 the family and that the boy Hamad was a minor he had suggested to the people that they should ask for him as their guardian. He stated that he had told the Jamath that if they wished him to be their Ruler they should inform Saiyid Abdur Razzaq. He said that he in formed them on these lines when he left Kalba by warship. He said that he did not tell the people of Kalba that he wished to be their Ruler but that they should choose some one as the guardian for the minor boy and that this individual should be under the orders of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah so that if anything happens they will refer to the Ruler of Ras al Khaimah. He stated that he went to Kalba merely to see his relations and that the people thought that he had come there because he was going to be their Ruler and then he wrote a letter to Saiyid Abdur Razzaq asking for a warship. At the request of the daughter of Shaikh Said, Khalid t s wife, he said he made a list of the household effects as he had a share on it on behalf of his sifeter and for the purpose of protecting the interests of the minor.

From Captain T .Hickinbotham, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain. &lt;$&gt; To The Honourable tlie Political Resident in the Persian Gujl, Bus hi re. 3* Sir, Subject; Kalba Succession. F I have the honour to refer to your telegram dated the 28th June 1937 l!fo.64:l and to enclose a report by the Residency Agent regarding the Kalba Succession, r 4°* 2. In my telegram of the 14th June No.'P/59, paragraph 3, I did not mean to indicate that we have greviousljr entered into Treaty relations with a slave as head of the State, but I was desirous of pointing out that it was not an unknown thing for a slave successfully^rule one of the Trucial States or tribes during the minority of the elected Shaikh. I quoted the case of the Naim as an instance of this for I understand that a slave successtully controlled this tribe during the minority of Sagar bin Sultan and Muhammad bin Sultan the two Naim orothers who now exercise control over the tribe. These two gentlemen rewarded the slave for his care of the tribe during their minority by murdering him as soon as they were old enougii to do so. Thus although it would be a precedent for His Majesty's G -ovemment to enter into relations witn a man who was a slave, it is not precedent for a slave or an ex-slave to supervise a tribe. 3. Prom my own experience of Barut I know him to be/-2. be a man of considerable character and as you know, I would like to see him the guardia n of the boy Hamad for I know he was devoted to Shaikh Said and would probably do all that is possible to manage at'fairs to the advantage of the boy and himself. I intentionally say the boy and himself because I think he would put tne minor Shaikh's interests first. If, however, you decide to adhere to your previous decision that we cannot have relations with one of Baru^s social standing, then the alternative suggested by the Residency - - [r | thiabga&amp;te.f&amp;l' • Agent seens just as unsatisfactory as it would be interference with the internal affairs of one of the Trucial Shaikhdoms. It would mean our insisting on the adoption of Ml—-' 1 itiilwwiaaiBlft, our nominee, for such Shaikh Khalid would become, against . , ,, iinirwwirt*- the wishes of the people of the State and this does not seem to me desirable as long as we maintain our policy of non-inteference in the internal affairs of the Trucial Shaikhdoms* 4. I am at a loss to suggest a third course and cannot see that we can do anything except either accept the nominee of the State or force the State to accept our nominee. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. Political Agent, Bahrain.I Copy of memorandum No.629-9/5 dated 3rd July 1937 from the Beside ncy Agent, Sharjah, to the Political Agent,Bahrain. L- | f' Reference your telegram No.239 dated the 29th June 1937. | 2. I beg to report that we arrived at Kalba on Thursady the 1st July 1937 at 0 6.00 hours. On arrival I landed and summoned all the notables of Kalba and conveyed to them the message contained in your above telegram. I repeated the message to them several times until they fully understood the same. There was a large gathering of about 100 men who sat round me to hear the message. The notables then met in private and after conferring with each other for four hours came back to me and said that they could not choose a suitable person from the people of Kalba who will be agreable to all parties. Taai to avoid trouble among the various parties they have chosen BARUT who is a capable, experienced and well acquainted with affairs of the State. After hearing what they had to say I again explained the message to them and asked them ii they understood tue same. Ihey confirmed that they have understood the message and that their decision about Barut was iinal. I, thereiore, asked them to confirm in writing what they had said to m^. 3. I enclose a letter dated the 2aid Rabi ! atiwThani 13b6(i.e., 1st July 1937) from the notables of Kalba to your address in confirmation of the above. 4. Barut returned from Muscat on 24tn June 1^3/. As soon as he arrived, he took hold ot tne fort anu arrangec all outside posts. He also declared HaiiLad bin Sa T iQ as the Ruler of Kalba. The fort is in the charge of Khamis bin f Ali of the Naqbiyin and six others all of wnom are unaer/ L2 Z. the direct command ol Barut. Kiianus is ine head of the guards from the lifetime of the late Shaikh Sa f id bin Hamad. The town and its surroundings upto Muscat teritory enjoy perfect peace and is well protected. 5. gilim bin Abdullah, Qhi&lt; f of th e Naqbiyin has been living in his village LULA.IIAH near Khaur Fakkan and did not go to Kalba since the removal of Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, beir afraid lest he may be killed by the people of Kalba or Barut. He sent word to Barut that as he went and complained to the British Goveriment without consulting him and has given accesj and chance to the British Government over Kalba, he did not think that he was bound by any arrangement made by Barut. mm ii^ii -hi ! He also sent word that the slaves of Shaikh Sa T id should not visit Khaur Eakkan. Barut, however, wrote him letters to the effect that in the interest of the state they should al combine and that Salim still retained the same position he had at the time of the late Shaikh Sa f id. On the evening of 30th June the messenger of Barut was given replies for Barut but before leaving, a special messenger by name Khalfan al Grhafali who is one of Shaikh Sultan's own men, arrived with special message to Salim, as a result of which Sa.lim took away the replies and told the messenger of Barut to go away. The messenger heard on his way to Kalba that Khaltan spent the night in the house of a Persian merchant, Jasim Ba,iraq &gt; and left the town before day light and went to Khaur Fak^an and met Salim. 6. I venture to suggest that Barut can arrange matters with the bedouins in the same manner as any other Shaikh on the Trucial Coast if outside interference is stopped, ^ould, however, a de facto guardian be necessary and Barut is not whwiuij considered as suitable for the appointment, the best person will be Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, whose appointment will3. undoubtedly be in the interest of peace and order in that vicinity. Siaikh Khalid was in fact invited by Barut, and the Naqbi^i n were going to send a deputation to bring him but due to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim T s intrigues they changed their mind.I aA f K [ Translation* To: Gap^ain T.Hickinbotham, Political Agent, Bahrain.

That Barut is not suitable as he could not be termed a notable.

British Agency, SharJ ah. 2nd October 1937. Sir, Following fot your information. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Hiler of Has al Khaimah left for iYadi al Qaur on 25th September 1937 and has not yet returned. Since Shaikh K-halid bin Ahmad took charge of the affairs of Kaloa he established peace, not only in Kalba territory but even at '^adi al Qaur v /hich is under Has al Khaimah. Shaikh Khalid sent a message to Ma T adhad bin Dain, a notorious high way robber, who took about Rs.400/- from the inhabitants of rtadi al Qaur as Zakat while Shaikh Sultan was noi, able to prevent him all these years long, and he left Wadi al ^aur immediately and without hesitation. 3. After arranging things at Kalba Shaikh Khalid went GO.9.37 to Has al Khaimah to visit his family who have been spending the summer in their gardens. He left balmaai uncle of the minor Shaikh Hamad bin Sa' id, who is now on very good terms with ahaikh Khalid, to act as ■■■■ali, while Barut accompanied him to Has al Khaimah. i understand that Shaikh Khalid is request ing ohaikh lUihammad bin Salim, brother of the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah to go to Kalba and divide the private property of the late Shaikh Sa'id bin Hamad among his legal heirs after paying [ all his debts. Shaikh Khalid does not want to mix himself in the private affairs of the.family hence he is asking Shaikh HSihammad to do it so as to avoid suspicions by his apponents. 4 * Nev/S from Kalba tllat everything is well and that peace and order have been established all over the country. ^•ttickinbotham, i.A., Political Agent, Bahrain, ^d- A.Razza^, Hesidency Agent, bharjah.1 f T / COHFIDENTIAL.

Political Agent, Bahrain. To The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian. Gulf, Bushire. Sir, jiqo I have '.l e honour to refer to paragraph 3 of you:- elegram No. ^7245 dated the 29th September 1937 a:n - 0 enclo se a copy of a note made by Khan Sahib Saiyid ^ezi -c -.q t~,y . &gt;,0 l^th of Iv r arch 1936 of a meetirjg which ook place between the Honourable the Political Resident Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E., C.B.E., and Shaikh Sultan bir 3aqr, Shaikh of Sharjah, on board H.I.'.S. Fowey on the 12th of March 1936. 2. The Shaikh of Sharjah had been requested by us to aj-range for air ^^cilities at Kalba end various letters had been addressed to him. It appears that he was unable to persuade the Shaikh of Kalba to listen to what should have been his orders, but was in practice his advice. The endeavour to approach Kalba through Sharjah was not continued after the interview between Sir Trenchard Fowle and the Shaikh of Sharjah on the 12th of March 1936. It appears that from then onwards it was decided to deal with the Shaikh of Kalba either directly or through Ahmad bin Hasan of Rams. Ahmad bin Hasan was despatched to Kalba to use his influence to persuade the Shaikh to negotiate with the Politics] authorities. These negotiations of Ahmad bin Hasan were successful anc as a result, of a favourable/--2- J favourable reply from the Shaikh of Kalba I myself when acting as Political Agent in 1936 went to Kalba and opened direct negotiations. 3• During the course of the negotiations His T r ajes- ty r s Government appeared doubtful regarding the possible infringement of paragraph 2 of Lieutenant-Colonel Dick- sorte letter of July 22nd, 1932 j to the Shaikh of Sharjah; and His Majesty's Secretary of State for India addressed a telegram No. 1853 to the Honourable the Political Resi dent. who was then at Kuwait, on the 19th of June 1936. In his telegram No. T/66 of the 22nd June Sir Trenchard Fowle replied to the Secretary of State for India and I invite $rour attention to paragraph 2 of this telegram. Sir Trenchard Fowle gave his views on the situation quite clearly when he said that he considered as a general prin ciple that the Shaikh who had ceased to exercise control or accept responsibility for an area under the de facto rule of another Shaikh forfeited any claims that he may once have had to the area in question. 4. With regard to the Shaikh of Sharjah f s probable' reaction to the approval of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Regent of Kalba by His rajesty's Government. The Shaikh of Sha'jah f s reaction to the acceptance of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Regent of Kalba by His lajesty* s '-rovernmert will be influenced firstly by financial considerations / and secondly by family considerations. . £*) With regard to the financial considerations which with the Shaikh of SharJ ah rank first. I invite your attention to the Agreement vfliich was c oncluc.eo on of June 1927 between Shaikh Sultan bir: oaqrj iv o_ Shariah, his brother Shaikh luhammad bin Saqr, a 'ld the notables/- ;-3- notebles the town of Sharjahj e.nd Shaikh IQialid bin Ahmed, his brother Abdullah bin Ahmed, Abdur Rahman bin Saif, Chief of Hemriyeh, and Hamad bin Ibrahim, Chief of Tjmm a!I Oaivsin, anc 5 endorsed by the Residency Agent. Khan - t .; -n-n .3^ bin Abdul La.tif, You will see from paragraph 4 that Shaikh Sultan bin Saqr and his subjects are bound to pay at the beginning o^ each diving season an allowance of p s. P600/- to Shaikh Khalid» I have no doubt that the Shaikh of Sharjah v/ill make every endeavour to come to some arrangement with Shaikh Khalid with regard to the dis continuation of the payment of this sum of money and I feel that the Shaikh of Sharjah* s reaction to the appoint ment of Shaikh Khalid as Regent will be very much influenced by Khalid* s personal attitude with regard to this annual subsidy- Personally I think that Shaikh Khalid will be prepared to forego the annual allowance if the Shaikh of Sharjah agrees to make no protest against the appointment of Shaikh Khalid as Regent• V /ith regard to the second consideration, i.e. the' of family- If the Shaikh of Has al Khainah had succeeded in his endeavour to have himself appointed as Itagest of Kalba the Shaikh of Sharjah would have heen considerably alarmed and would have protested strongly. At the same time the Maim Shaikh^ashid of Ajman and the Shaikh of ISnm al Qaiwain would have viewed this extension of autho rity and territory hy the Shaikh of al Khai-rah 1 great concern and would have intrigued,,as would Sharjah/ with the Beni Kitab and other tribes + o make the :heiT--h of Eas al Khaimah's position in ''alba ir^oleraKlc . ■ r ~ the Shaikh of Sharjah had made any endeavour to consoV- date his old territory and rejoin Kalba to Sharjah, then the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah would have been in opposition as/-! I r - f *■*- A V v ' ; -4- as he himself has claims to Kalba. The only individual '• r ho was in any way suitable for the appointment and likely to be acceptabl e to both the Shaikhs was Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed who was ir the unenviable position o being an ex-monarch without money. He is a Jar/as aim himself and therefore acceptable on tribal grounds: he is of good family and is intimately connected with both the Jawassim Shaikhs, i.e. of Sharjab and Ras al Fhai- mah. He was not on friendly terms vlth the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah, nor was he on friendly terms with the Shaikh of Sharjah, and both the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah and the Shaikh of Sharjah . if they cannot have Kalba for themselves., would prefer to see Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmed as Regent than any one else, as they know he is unlikely to ally himself with either of them. 5. The Shaikh of Sharjah is quite well aware that Kalba has passed outside his control and he has no at heart to regain control . He knows that he will have considerable trouble to contend with when and if he is called upon by us to fulfil the concdtions of the Cil Ag reement with Petroleurr Concessions Limited which he has just concluded. He is not anxious to commit hirr.seIf any further than is absolutely necessary and prefers to keep his money and live quietly on the Coast to endeavouring to prevent the Shaikhdom. He may possibly make a formal protest but - . » K h think even this unlikely as I do not recollect any protest ae when we ori £ i-ally ; i- 1936 /g r - j to Kalba by the first Treaty Yvith Shaikh Saic ir arra , the details of which must have been known to 'he Shaikh of Sharjah. I have the honour to be, Sir, obedient servantlot Landinp: Ground at Kalba &gt; On 12 th March 1936 the Honourable the Politic si ves ! ' ^• n :i? Persian lulf asked, ohaikh Sultan bin Saqrj Ruler of Sharjah, v/hen he called on board H.H.S.Fowey, if he had received any reply from Shaikh Sa^id bin Hamad of T/ al'a. Shaikh Sialtaji replied that he had recently received a reply from the Shaikh of Kalba in which he refused to allow a landing ground at Kalba on the ground that he was afrc.id '^o allow one at I''alba lest others might create trou ble ' or him# The P.?., asked the Shaikh of Sharjah why the Shaikh of Kalba was afraid. The Shaikh replied that he was always on bad terns with the Sharqiyin and that it was possible that when there is a landing ground at Kalba, they, in order to put him into trouble, would do some mischief for which he would be held responsible. The Shaikh said that he had tried his best to induce the Shaikh of Kalba but v/as not successful. The P .P.. said to the Shaikh of Sharjah that as he claimed Kalba to be under him, could he not make the Shaikh of Kalba obey his orders. The Shaikh of Sharjah replied&gt;that Shaikh Sa 'id bin Hamad of Kalba was an old man and that he respected him like his father and, therefore, did not like to hurt his feelings. The Shaikh added that even if he intended to take action against Shaikh Sa f id bin Hamad of Kalba, he had to use force which he could not do for want of men and money and because of the difficulty of finding his way to Kalba which is sur rounded by mountains, which na.-e access o Kalba. '• i-fi- cult♦ But that supposing he could collect force + . o fight against the Shaikh of Kalba such force would have to pass through Wadi al Ghuar, which is under the rTnai..- of - v as al Khaimah. The P .H. said to the Shaikh of Sharjah that supposing he was sent on a sloop, would c '.e r - - - to make the Shaikh of Kalba listen to him- The Shaikh made/-2*1' msce some erasive and aifibiguous Replies and finally said thai, he would advise the Shaikh of Kalba and that if he did no- listen to his advice, the Government could then T - hat ever action they considered fit for the purpose of achieving their ends. The P.H. said to the Shaikh that if he could not arrange this matter he had to find some c or person, end. asked the Shaikh if the Shaikh of Kalba would listen to the Shaikh of Has al Khaimah. The Shaikh oi oharjah replied that he was not certain, but said that the Shaikh, of .-.as al Khaimah was on better terms than him self with the Shaikh of Kalba- After the Shaikh of Sharjah had landed, Khan Sahib Ksam sazz 4 o the P.P.. that before his death Shaikh Sultan bin a%r, the grandfather of the present Shaikh of Shariah, w / dihis country among his sons in accordance with the genealogical table attached, and that the Shaikh of Sharjah since then ceased to exercise any authority over Falba. ^^'-he Shaikh of oharjsh- did not v/ant to admit this fa.ct in order that he may not show any weakness on his part. He added tha* the Shaikh of Kalba had an intimate frierd by name Ahmad bin Hasan who is resident of Sharjah and asked the P.P.. if he could send him to sound the Shaikh oi Kalba. The P.H. agreed that Khan Sahib Fusain should send Ahmad bin Hasan to Kalba, provided he did so in his private capacity and not as a messenger from the Government Sd/- Abdur Rezzaq. 12-3-36.'

Reference your telegrajn No. 184 dated the 9tn .jay 1^37. 2. Accoraing to two letters received bj Shai&amp;i Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaunan (a) from Hamad bin 3a T ia and (b) from Salim bin T Abdullah and the rest ol tne people of Kalba, Khaur Palacan, Za'ab and others, dated tne 23ra Safar 1356(i.e., b.b .193?) respectively and also reports, tne people of Kalba ol their own will have elected Shailm Hamad bin Ga T id as successor to his father. The Policy adopted by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah, who writes to them that he only wants to nelp the boy so that no outsider can encroach on the property of the late Shailch Sa T id bin Hamad, might change tniags in future, namely, he might be able to convince the Na^biym that it would be in their interests to act as Amirs on his behalf ana look after Khaur Pakkan and Kalba, and tnus deceive them to admit his sovereignty over that country. He iaas been very polite in his trrwimini i win letters to tnem and also lenient. Although the Naqbiym wrote to Shaikh Sultan to extend his help to them against outsiders, the last letter dated .the 24tn Safar 13bb{i.e.,6.b.3?) received by Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, from Salim bin T Abdullaii, ol which i enclose a true copy, shows clearly that they ao not want any ■* — of the Qawasim Snaikhs besides Hamad whom they support. The letter is ended by a warning to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim that he should prevent the rest of the Qawasim from encroaching agaisnt Kalba and at the same time says that he should not also send any people on his behalf until matters are quiet. Shaikh Sultan bin Salim is trying his best to annex Kalba with Ras al Khaimah and is doing his utmost to convince tne people of Kalba that it would be in tneir interests that he should be their protector. He says tnat because the Naqbiyin need his help and as the boy Hamad is a minor and has no one to look after his interests or7^ the interests ot his tamily, it is necessary that he should do so. The Shaikii ol Sharjah says in his letter about the message conveyed to him that he should not interfere in the question ol successor which should be left to Kalba people to decide, that Kalba is part of nis dominion and as the people want help owing to tne pressure of the son of Ahmad, Khalid and T Abdullah, it is his duty to answer tneir call. 040m ii it**** ^tT ff In fact tne Shaikh ol Sharjaii dia not get a letter that they want him to go and help them but is relying on the letters which tne Shaikh of Has al Khaimah had received. The letter to the Shaikh of Sharjah says that Shaikh Sa'id died and that they(people of Kalba)expect his help. This is a matter of courtesy which tiiey always say even to outsiders 3• I expect to get a report from Ealba any moment and will report to you whatever may nappen.

Mohamiaed Ibn Sallm the elder brother of the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah who was himself at one time the Shaikh and is a reasonable man is now at Ras al Khaimah. 2. The Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah has gone to Kalba in defiance of my telegram No.180 of 4th May and my telegram No.184 of 9th May which contained instructions from you not to interfere and in opposition to the people of Kalba it we are to believe the letter forwarded under my Printed Letter No.192, dated 21st May and the statement of Mohammed Ibn Sultan (my telegram No. ^48)'. 3- Paragraph 5 of my telegram under reference. I think it should be decided what line is to be taken before Kalba is visited in case the Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah remains there.

I agree that 0 heikh of Pas al Fhaimah has disregarded my instructions. Before, however, I give him a di^rect order to evacuate Kalha I should have t o he in a position to apply force should he not ohey. This force couldi/most conveniently take the form of seizing his pearling dhows hut I am reluctant to suggest this to His Majesty's Grovernmeit too often. But if he does something outrageous such as adding Kalha to his territory then 1 will take the ahove course. 3. Another consideration is that if at the present juncture we either threaten or use force against him we may render much more difficult the obtaining of the oil concession from him. 4. All things considered therefore I propose to take no action for the moment. 5. Paregr^h S of your telegram No. T59 of June 14th. T think it would 'be impossible for us to accept Barut who is a slave as the official regent for Kalha.

Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah is in difficulties at Kalba and has sent a letter to the Residency Agent asking him to telegraph to you and himself go to Kalba in a sloop. The Shaikh says that he is afraid of harm coming to hig and British subjects. As far as the Residency Agent knows there are no British subjects at Kalba. 3* The ShaiKh of Sharjah has also received a letter which seems to have amused him.

Shaikh of Ras al Khaimah against my instructions has interfered in Kalba affairs and is there in person. He has now sent a message that he is in difficulties and asks for a sloop to assist him. 3. My first inclination would be to let him stew in his own Juice but on the whole I think best political impression would be made by sloop rescuing him from his position, after which I can consider how to deal with him for disobedience of my orders. 4. I would be grateful if you would detail a sloop to proceed to Kalba with the following objects (a) ensure safety of British subjects if in any danger (which I doubt). To the best of my knowledge there are only one or two at Kalba. (b) take the Shaikh and his personal attendants on board and report to me for further instructions regarding him. (c) to report on the local situation. 5. No action is called for on behalf of any party at Kalba. 6* If you can provide sloop Residency Agent should be informed to proceed with it to Kalba.

Letters report that in 1937 Shaikh Said of Kalba died and the people of Kalba elected his son Hamad, a boy of twelve, but the right of succession by the firstborn child was not recognized by other rulers. The succession was contested by the Shaikh of Dibba and also Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad, ex-Shaikh of Sharjah. The file contains translations of letters between the Arab rulers of the coast relating to this issue. A letter from Hamad bin Sai'd bin Hamad to Shaikh Sultan bin Salim, Ruler of Ras al Khaimah informs of his election and requests his protection. The Wali of Kalba writes to Sir Trenchard Fowle, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, that Shaikh Sultan bin Salim was attempting to influence the merchants of Kalba to gain the succession.The Residency Agent, Sharjah was dispatched to assess the situation; the file includes a family tree of Sharjah. In a letter to the Government of India, External Affairs Department, the Political Resident Persian Gulf noted the policy of the Government of India is one of non-interference and finally recognition as Shaikh of whoever can seize and hold the Shaikhship provided that they recognise the Treaties with His Majesty's Government entered into by their predecessor. The correspondence also notes that whilst uncertainty remained no Imperial Airways aircraft used the landing strip at Kalba.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Shaikh of Kalba, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sheikh of Dibba, Āl Qāsimī dynasty</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Kalba</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Kings and rulers--Succession</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x000104#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
