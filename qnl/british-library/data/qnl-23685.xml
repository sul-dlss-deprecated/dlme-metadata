DLG.D.O.No* - ( Political Agency, Bahrain, The 3rd February, 1946. . My dear Sir Geoffrey, Thank you for your D,0. No«126-S dated the 26th January, &gt;1945, and the examination papers therewith. I enclose a corrected exercise. I regret that it is unfinished and that it tails off badly but yesterday when the mail sneaked upon us unawares, I had fever as the result ♦ of a T.A.B. inoculation. I hope to work through one or two . more in Sharjah and to do a few in India, but doubt my ability . to finish all the nine in a fortnight. Although, as you say, the exercises are by no mer^as difficult they take time to complete. You probably noted the paucity of vocabulary of the author of the English. He uses 'assisted' and 'principal' twice each in the first three lines and 'entrusted' twice later on, but I have endeavoured not to follow him but to translate these by different Arabic words. Yours sincerely, The Hon'ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.B., Political Resident in tne Persian Gulf, Bushire.Telegram From To No. Dated sy — 'O G.T.C.

We hope shortly to let you know the complete procedure agreed .by the Commission. Meanwhile we have agreed that the test in each cf the languages concerned will include an oral examination to be conducted by an examiner unconnected with any Foreign Service post, whose native language is the particular language concerned, and who is preferably a member of the teaching staff of an University or equivalent institution. He would have to be prepared to take the oral examination on lines prescribed by the Civil Service Commission. To avoid delay we would ask all posts in countries where a language allowance is payable to let us know whether such an examiner would be available wheti we are in a position to start holding examinations in, we hope, about three months' time. We should be grateful for a few particulars about the examiner you would propose. There is no reason why examinations should necessarily be held in a single centre, or why that centre should be the capital city.

Andrew, Persian Gulf Residency, Bahrain, to Mr. R.E. Barclay, Personnel Department, Foreign Office, London. ____________ I understand from Sir Rupert Hay that you wished Stobart and myself to let you know the details of the Arabic course proposed for us here, and of its probable cost, so that the payment of tuition fees may be sanctioned. I believe Sir Rupert will shortly be sending you a fuller report on our training, but as far as Arabic^is concerned we have been advised that we must aim at 3^ hours study a day at least. Of this one hour consists of individual tuition by a Munshi, who takes me in the morning and Stobart in the afternoon and the remaining 2£ hours a day are devoted to private study. The cost of the 'Munshi' for individual tuition is Es.lOO per month each, or Es.200 in all for both of us 5 as we were advised by Sir Rupert that it would be preferable for us to begin learning Arabic at the earliest opportunity we have been employing the Munshi since January 4th. I hope there are no objections to this anticipation of sanction, and that the costs incurred may be sanctioned from that date. It has also been suggested that after the first 3 months study, consisting mainly grammar and elementary Arabic, it would be advisable for us to employ one of the clerks for half an hour's conversation practice daily, for which we weuld have to pay aboutRs.25 each per month; If you could let us know whether this further expense would be sanctioned we could inform you later of the date when such additional tuition begins. Letter No. (XS082(9/48)) dated the 11th May, 1948, from Mr. Barclay, Foreign Office, London, to Mr. Andrew, Residency, Bahrain. I am sorry that we have been so long in answering your letter of the 29th January (D.O 282-S) about Arabic tuition fees. We have only Just agreed details of practice with the Treasury. We agree to your charging the cost of your lessons with the 'Mlnshi' and eventually of your conversation practice with the clerk to public funds, as from the 4th January. We would expect you to take the next test for the £100 Arabic allowance about next October and would not agree to continuing payment of fees beyond that time until we have seen the results of the test. The conversation practice with one of the clerks is a good idea, but you may find that after a few months you get enough practice in your daily routine, talking to servants shopping in the bazzar, official coffee drinking etc., to dispense with it. We will send you a copyof the papers used for the Arabic tests as soon as the first examination has been held.[ XS 082 (22/48) ] CIRCHT AR Mo mc IV F oreign O ffice, 20th December, 1948. ition Fees for Consulate-General, Dear ^ Consulate, To remove a possible deterrent to part-time language study, we have been able to secure authority to pay for reasonable tuition fees for members of Branch B, for all languages including those for which an allowance is payable. 2. This concession is contingent on prior submission to us of an outline of the course proposed and a statement of its cost. Claims for the refund of tuition fees can be admitted in respect of lessons taken since 1st September, 1948. 3. Regulation No. 8 of Chapter III is being revised accordingly; meanwhile comment (3) of that regulation should be disregarded and the conditions of this circular applied as regards language tuition for members of Branch B at public expense. 4. The maximum number of lessons which may be charged to public funds varies with different languages, as follows:— French, Spanish Italian, Portuguese—30 hrs. Norwegian, Dutch, German, Swedish, Danish, Roumanian —45 hrs. Russian and other Slavonic languages, Albanian, Hebrew, Finnish, Turkish, Hungarian and Greek—65 hrs. Arabic, Persian, Siamese, Burmese—75 hrs. Amharic, Chinese and Japanese—100 hrs. Tuition fees can only be claimed once in respect of one language. His Majesty's Consular Officers. 15148 36211—172 5. These maxima cannot of themselves provide an advanced knowledge of all branches of a language. They have been fixed with the limited object of enabling members of Branch B to reach or approach the standard of the tests on which language allowances are granted. Anyone who takes tuition at public expense will ordinarily be expected to sit the appropriate test when the course of lessons is finished. 6. It is intended that emphasis in the tests and in language study undertaken at public expense should be laid primarily upon the spoken language, and teachers should be asked to concentrate on the colloquial language. 7. While it is not desired to discourage any Branch B officer from learning any foreign language it should be explained that tuition fees will normally be met from public funds only in cases where an officer is studying the language of the country in which he is for the time being employed or for which he has been selected. It will be necessary to re-qualify for any language allowance after an absence of two years or more from a post where the allowance • is payable. 8. The conditions laid down in this circular apply to part-time study only; they specifically do not relate to members of Branch B who may be directed to learn a language as their primary duty. 9.

We shall in future send in nominations to them as follows;— (i) Branch A: For all language tests: quarter; (ii) Branch B: {a) For tests in Arabic, Amhanc, Bulgarian, Burmese, Chinese, Czech, Finnish, Greek, Hungarian, Icelandic, Japanese, Korean, Persian, Polish, Russian, Serbo-Croat, Siamese, Turkish: at the end of each quarter; {b) for tests in languages other than those listed under {a): 19th November and 1st July of each year. 3. This change does not affect the dates or frequency of the tests themselves. Tests under (i) and (ii) {a) above can still be held on any date not less than six months after the previous test in the language. The tests under (ii) {b) will still be held about the second Tuesday in February and the third Tuesday in September of each year. 4. The only indirect changes involved in the new practice are that we shall no longer invite, e.g., all other Arabic-speaking posts to send in nominations as soon as we receive an application to sit an Arabic test, as has been our habit; and that anyone intending to take a test under (i) or (ii) {d) will have to think far enough ahead to send in an application by the end of the calendar quarter before he or she will be ready to sit (e.g., applications must reach us by 30th September for tests to take place in October, November or December). 5.

It has been found necessary to modify these arrangements in some respects and a copy of the rules governing the 1950 examination is attached. , 2. In future, the examinations will be ' Limited' in the sense that a proportion of the vacancies each year in the Senior Branch will be reserved for Branch B candidates, but vacancies will only be allotted up to the number reserved if there are sufficient candidates who reach the required standard. Although the standard will be the same as that required for candidates entering Branch A by the Normal Open competitions, the advantage of the Limited examination lies in the fact that Branch B candidates will be competing among themselves for the vacancies allotted. 3. Until further notice, one Normal Limited Competition will be held each year, and there will be no other avenue of promotion to the Senior Branch for members of Branch B who are within the age limits for the Limited Competition, But as mentioned in paragraph 6 of circular No. 04, older candidates will still have the chance of transfer or promotion into Branch A without examination by the application of the procedure based on Regulation 9 (paragraphs 3 and 4) of Chapter II of the Foreign Service Regulations. 4. The first Normal Limited Competition will be held in January 1950, and any member of Branch B, either male or female, who satisfies the conditions of age and service laid down in the attached Rules may be considered. A nomination is required, however, and only those officers who appear to be well up to the standard of the Senior Branch will be nominated. 5. Officers who satisfy the required conditions and who wish to be considered for the 1950 Competition should notify His Majesty's Consular Officers. 15719 37615—16Personnel Department as soon as possible. Applications should be submitted through the Heads of Posts or of Departments in the Foreign Office, and must reach Personnel Department before 10th November, 1949. No request received after this date can be entertained and if there is danger of delay in mails, recom mendations should be sent by telegram. 6. Candidates who are nominated will be summoned to the written examination, which will be held on 5th and 6th January, 1950, and shortly afterwards to the tests of personal qualities and the Final Selection Board. In general, candidates will be required to take the written examination in London, but, in exceptional circumstances, the Civil Service Commissioners may consider arranging a centre or centres abroad for candidates serving in distant stations if travel to London should prove impracticable. The tests of personal qualities and the Final Selection Board cannot, in any case, be held abroad. 7. Successful candidates will enter Branch A on the followine terms:— (i) Under 28 years of ^.—Candidates will enter the A9 scale at their present pay plus £40, subject to the normal rules governing starting pay on promotion. (ii) 28 years of age and over. —Minimum of the A8 scale, or existing pay plus £60, subject to the normal rules governing starting pay on promotion, if this is higher. 8. You are requested to bring the contents of this despatch to the attention of all Branch B members of your staff, in particular, to those officers eligible by reason of age and service for the first Competition. 9.
