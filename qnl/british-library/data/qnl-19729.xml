Following for Lean of M.E.A.L.U. !• Muscat State authorities agree to party visiting Raiiolat Mugshin but not repeat not Daqaqa. As regards Mugshin please note following points: (a) State accept no responsibility for security and members of party should therefore carry arms. (b) Muscat authorities at Salalah will assist in transport arrangements and settlement of terms with local Sheikhs who will probably ask you to supply ammunition to tribesmen accompanying caravan. (c) If party exceeds 12 persons they should bring their own rations and in any case at least 1 dozen bags rice will be required. (d) Presumably not less than 40 half 80 camels will be required. Cost will approximate M.T. Dollars 5 half 10 each daily. Riding saddles if required should be brouglit. (e) All payment to be made in M.T. dollars procurable locally. (f) Because of the monsoon party must return via Sedeh east of Marbat. (g) While at Salalah party must live at the Aerodrome and observe local rules.. 3.

The correspondence is between Arnold Crawshaw Galloway, the Political Resident in Bushire, Ralph Ingham Hallows, the Political Agenct in Muscat, Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador in Cairo, the MESC in Cairo, and O. B. Lean, the chief anti-locust officer of the Middle East Anti-Locust Unit, based in Aden.The first part of the correspondence (folios 2-5) is concerned with the appointment of Wilfred Thesiger as leader of the expedition, obtaining permission from the authorities in Muscat and Salalah to venture into the areas to be surveyed, conditions set by those authorities for granting it, and details of how Thesiger wishes to carry out his task.The second part (folios 6-7) consists of summaries of political developments in Oman at the time, namely talks between the Ghafiri (Ġāfiri) sheikhs, Suliman Bin Hamiyar of Jabal Akhdhar and Ali Bin Abdullah of the Beni Bu Ali, and the Sultan of Muscat, Sa'id bin Taimur, regarding the election of a new Imam following the expected death of the incumbent, Muhammad bin Abdullah al-Khalili. Folio 6 relays the Sultan's desire to postpone a proposed trip into the north of Oman until the following year due to the delicate political situation. Folio 7, a letter from Bushire to the External Affairs Department of the Government of India in New Delhi, emphasises the importance of these developments for the chances of a proposed geological survey by Petroleum Concessions Limited in the Jabal Akhdhar area during the winter of 1945/6.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><name type="personal"><namePart>Sir Knight Wilfred Patrick Thesiger</namePart></name></subject><name type="personal"><namePart>James Orton</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Francis Warden</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="personal"><namePart>Hugh Weightman</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Būshehr</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Locusts</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0000d3#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
