Your favours dated 28th June and 6 th July in hand and have had my careful attention. I understood that the British Legation do not like us making contract with any other firm except they are persuading their intention, so T - fain ' it would he rather difficult for me to charter a boat for Oxide shipment, because it is possible that the British Government find for us some objects direct or through the officials of Persian Government so ao orevent our shipnierft, then I have to face some trouble and losses, therefore at present time I nave given up the idea of any shipment and am waiting j.oj. a definite decision of affairs.

Dear Sirt- 7Je have received your letter of August 6 th ? from which we see that you understand the British H Legation v/ill not like you making contracts with any other firm except Messrs. ?rank C. Stride .and Company. The Foreign Office have for a long time 'been j desirous that this business should pass wholly or partly through Messrs. F. 0. Stride and Company, but there is no reason to anticipate that the British Government will insist on your confining your business to this firm at lower prices than can be obtained from other British subjects of good standing. If when business again becomes possible you desire to entrust your interests to us we shall make the best possible bargain for you as heretofore, and you can rely upon it that at the same dme we snail satisfy all the Foreign Office requirements here. We are convinced an arrangement-of this kind would be much more to your advantage than direct negotiations between Messrs. F. C. Strick and Company and yourself.

Moin-ut—Tujjar has applied to Persian Government for a contract and Persian Government have communicated terms of offer to Messrs Strick's -agent thereby de facto recognising Messrs Strick’s claim based, on Article 10 of their expired contract to an option for new contract, not merely to pre-emption, as explained in Sir.n.Townley's despatch No.141 of 1914. Persian Government appear doubtful of Moin-ut-Tujjar's capacity to carry out this offer, and as they are much pressed for money, they prefer to deal with Messrs Stride, Who will pay on the nail, and have invited their agent to negotiate new agreement. Agent has sent me copy of letter dated April 1st last, which can be construed as recognition of Messrs Strick's claim to option of contract and in view of re cent action of Persian Government in communicating Moin- ut-Tuj jar's offer to agent Messrs Strick's position seems ao strong that they are scarcely likely to consent to allow Ellinger and Weir to participate. Agent tells me that weir now takes little interest in the matter. As you are aware, Moin-ut-Tujjar possesses certain claims in virtue of law of Medjliss and it seems possible that he is now acting in his own interest on his own account and not as Ellinger's representative.uopy 8159U/1S Uuae 29til, 1919 Gentlemen: with reference to ray letter of 16th June, regarding the sale of hormuz oxide, i am directed by secretary air adaard Grey to infona you tiiat walie His majesty's Government would be willing to afford their active support to a scheme in which they learnt that your firm, tiessrs. vseir and : essrs. stride were all amicably interested, yet they cannot at tills stage ©larantee any support until they learn definite ly tiiat the three firms are so united in a eoutaon interest.

February transmit ting copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Teheran in which he suggests possible means for arriv ing at a .settlement between Messrs. St, rick and Messrs. Ellinger in regard to Hormuz oxide question. The Board note that the basis of the settlement is to be a payment to Messrs. Ellinger of £3,000 in view of the provisions of Article 12 of the Contract between Messrs. Strick and the Persian Government. The Board venture, however, to remind Sir E. Grey that the claim put forward by Messrs. Kllinger on June 26th. 1912 sub sequent to the sale of the Norwegian Oxide (see en- clostre to Foreign Office letter No. 27392 of July 9th. 1912) amounted to £4,912. 19. 1. on their own behalf and £9,185. 2. 0. on behalf of Messrs, 'eir; that Messrs. Weir and Messrs. Ellinger entered into this trade with the full encouragement and approval of His Majesty’s Government, whose support has subsequently been withheld from them; and that Messrs. StricK, both by their action and by the attitude subsequently taken The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.taken up by them have caused grave embarrassment to His Majesty’s Government in the matter. Whilst the Board are desirous of doing nothing which would impede a satisfactory settlement of this vexatious question, they are aware of no ground for supposing that Messrs, Strick are likely to modify the attitude they have hitherto adopted of refusing to recognise any claim for compensation, and they would, moreover, feel con siderable hesitation in conveying to Messrs, Ellinger the proposal contained in Sir W.

After carefully going into this complicated case I venture to suggest (1) That Weir ana Ellinger he informea that His Majesty’s Government can no longer press their claim on Persian Government ana that their only recourse is to ap peal to the Courts. (2) That Messrs.

I am of opinion that Persian Government acted within their rights in putting an end to firman unuer which Bio in- ut-Tujjar made the Weir Contract of 1908 and Messrs.. Ctrick’s contention that in face of supplementary Agree ment of 1908 (see Print Vol. No. 23 page 121) no legal claim on them can exist appears to me well founded. If the course suggested meets with your approval I should ask for authority to inform Persian Government accordingly. This will enable Messrs.

Yours sincerely. Sd. S. G. Knox. The Hon T ble Lieut.-Colonel Sir P.Z.Cox, K.G.I.L., C.S.I., Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. 14N0V1S14j India, Fokeigh Szcr.Di No A3 A1, datscl 23 uCT 1314 RMinute . Mr. Stanley* Mr. Martin Ellinger came to see me on July 23rd at his request, and gave me his views of the litigation with Mr.Strick over the Hormuz Oxide question. c He said that Messrs Stricks 1 contract with the Persian G-overnment for the supply of oxide expires in 1915, and he intended to apply for it. He thought that time was nearly ripe for negotiating the new contract. He would like, he said to have the support of His Majesty f s Government to enable him to obtain the new contract, or concession for himself, on the understanding that he should admit Mr. Strick to a share in it. I pointed out that Mr. Strickbad powerful and important interests in developments in the Persian Gulf, and his past attitude hardly indicated that he would be ready to accept a subordinate share or status in a new contract, or concession. As far as I understood the difficulty, it seemed necessary to find a common ground, on which his interests and those of Mr. Strick would converge and allow participation of both. It was also difficult for me, with little besides local knowledge, to understand how far Messrs Ellinger &amp; Co were acting in conjunction with Moin-ut-Tujjar in their desire to obtain a share in the business; also, to what extent the monetary claim of Messrs Ellinger was standing in the way of an arrangement between themselves and Messrs Strick &amp; Co in regard to a new contract. One of the chief difficulties, which appealed to me personally, in regard to future business with the Moin and his concessionary rights if Messrs Ellinger contemplated obtaining a new contract through the Moin, was that the latter was already an old man for a Persian merchant (about 65, I thought), and his several heirs, who were not people of the same standing, mignt do anything with the interests inherited by them. The law of inheritance usually caused extreme difficulty in Persia. Mr. lllinger then said that all that his firm aimed at was a share min future business; their present claim could probably be merged in any agreement with Messrs Strick for shares in future business. As for Messrs Weir &amp; 00*8 interest in the claim he (Mr.Ellinger) had told Mr. Weir that it might be necessary or expedient to leave Messrs Weir &amp; Co out of account in a settlement. This he told me confidentially, he said. Mr. W. Weir had told me a few days before that they would not, he thought, make any difficulties about doing so, Messrs Weir are really I gather only concerned in supporting Messrs Ellinger inasmuch as they work on joint account in other quarters, e.g. Manchuria. Mr. Ellinger remarked that Mr. Strick always regarded any move by their firm towards personal discussion as a sign of weakness : and was extremely difficult to deal with over this matter. They had no mutual friend likely to adjust their difference. Mr. Ellinger thought that perhaps His Majesty’s Government might be dubious of giving him full support for his application for a contract from 1915 onwards, because of his connection with the Muin, and his idea of working for it through the Moin, or as the latter’s agent. He said that he would (1) . Make it clear to the Foreign Office that he was quite ready to go into the business solely as Messrs Ellinger &amp; Co, and have nothing to do with the Moin, and (2) . Provided that His Majesty’s Government would notify Messrs Strick that no support would be given them in obtaining a new contract in 1915, he thought that he (Mr. Ellinger) could get Mr. Strick to make terms with him. To a question of mine Mr. Ellinger replied that : (3) . He was ready to let the contract be obtained in Messrs Stricks’ name, provided that Messrs Ellingers’ share in the future business was agreed upon beforehand with the approval of His Majesty’s Government. If Mr. Strick did not come to terms with them, there would be competitioncompetition over the new contract in Tehran, and prices so inflated by the Persian Government as to make the business unprofitable for both. Mr. Ellinger also talked considerably about the Sulphur deposits, and fcaid that these had been mentioned to him by Mr. Stanley some time ago. He was willing for a concession for the development of these to be included in any xgx arrangement with Mr. Strick. In the past their firm had sent out several engineers to Bostaneh, on behalf of the Moin : one Mr.McCormick, was ready to go out again. He had formerly stated, so Mr. Ellinger rather thought, that the deposits at Bostaneh were hardly large enough in themselves to make much business profit able, but perhaps if Khamir or other deposits were also worked, the two together might pay. Pie would look into the Sulphur papers again. Mr. Ellinger f s desire for official action in the sense of ( 2 ) seems a point for consideration : it is clear that development in the mining of Red Oxide, possibly also the working of Sulphur, would be promoted, if the two firms could compose their differences and work together. Mr. Strick in conversation recently seemed however to consider Hr • Ellinger beneath his notice. July 29th 1914. (Signed) H. G. ChiekoCONFIDENTIAL. •&lt; IKA Sir W.

The Tiight rir : o Sir, With reference to your Desp&amp;twh of the ord ultimo upon the subject of the Manaus Oxide Trade,I have the honour to report that,in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram No.09 of the 7th February last,I handed to the minister xor Foreign Affairs a Persian rendering of the first para - graph of y-.'Ur above—quoted tele^i’&amp;m demanding the can — cellation of the moin’s new concession down to the word H withdrawal”. I have subsequently drawn the attention of the minister for Foreign Affairs to this question and,on the 8th ultimo,wrote privately to Mis Excellency an ftnfiwfer was awaited. In the course of an interview soce days later Voseugli-ud-Iowlab returned to a euggeetion which I had put forward,at a purely p-roonai one.eoine time previously .namely that this question slight poaaibly ce settled by the sale or lease to hit ..ajesty’e (iovern - nent of the islands of riehn.harak and hen jar..

Grey, P-art. ,li. G. , L. P. , etc etc etcthat the kinister for Foreign Affairs has pressed me to ascertain when further information upon the subject may fcs expected. I have not deemed it ex — pedient to prese further for the definite with - draw&amp;l of the hoin's ooncession,pending a decision upon this question,ae our protest against it,and desiand for its cancel 1 at ion, have been placed on record,and loin has not teen put in possession of the document. As to the action which it nay be de - sirable to take upon the expiration of Messrs .f.trick* s contract with the Persian Government in April next, I would beg to state that their Agent in Tehran con tends that,under Art:10 of their contract dated November 17th 1910,which terminates on the 20th karch 1915, hessrs.Ftrick have an option over any sales of oxide after the expiration of the present contract. The article in question runs ac follows:- M The sellers (i.e. the Persian Government) undertake that during the period of this contract no oxide mined on the island of Hormuz other than the oxide bought and sold shall be offered for sale,sold,shipped,de - livered or transferred to any person or persons what soever. Put the sellers shall have the right to sell oxide at any time for delivery after the expiration of this contract,provided the buyers (kessrs.rtrick) have preemption”. It is clear that the Persian Govern- mentyn making the contract can have had no intention of conferring upon keesrs.Strick the perpetual prs- emptory rights that are claimed for them by their Agenti * Ag©nt in Tehran. It was doubtlerr intended to re - serve the right -do continue to nine Oxide during the tern of Kessre.Striak*&amp; contract,for delivery to other parties after its expiratio&gt;n,but as a favour iiesBre .T.triok were to have the right to a preference of the purchase of the mineral extracted during the course of tneir contract. It 1b evident that no such interpretation of Art.10 ae that put upon it by hoBBi-B.rtrick’s Agent was contemplated by the Yarious pax j ties interested who have doubtlesE stud “* ied it carefully,tut in view of tixe ambiguous phras eology employed 1 should, be glad to be favoured with your opinion upon its rendering before making any suggestion as to how kesers.keii dc Fllinger’s int - the r trick contract.

In accordance with the request contained in the last paragraph of your despatch I have to infom you that I consider that the Interpretation put fcy •'■ou upon Article 10 of Ifesors. Stride's contract of 17th. Noverabar 1910, is clearly what was Intended by the parties to the contract. Moreover, I an of opinion that it is the interpretation that would be put upon it by any competent Court which had to construe the contract. The construction advanced by 'essrs. Stride's agent cannot, in my opinion, be wrung out of the words in any clrcinstances and is, further, quite inconsistent with the Article in which the words appear and the rest of the contract.

V. Biscoe, Assistant Resident and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, I have the honour to solicit a reference to my &amp; letter No. 19^ of the 27th March 1914, forwarding certain correspondence which had passed between the local agent of Messrs. F. C. Strick and Co. and myself on the subject of the sale of certain oxide excavated several years ago and now deteriorated. 2. The Director of Customs had not then received Monsieur Mornard's telegram of the 19th March. It will be evident however now that the Customs are endeavouring to dispose of the bad quality oxide; doubtless the protest made by His Majesty’s Minister will prevent this, but I may mention that it seems to me unlikely that any offers will be made locally for this oxide. The only Persian merchant in the place who might conceivably consider business of this nature is Shaikh Ahmad Gelladary, and he is the agent of the Mu*in-ut-Tujjar, so is not likely to do so. No British subjects are likely to make an of p er, and in an y case would not, I think, do so without consultingme first, 3, The Director of Customs discussed the Question of tne outout of oxide with me again yesterday. He said that he had been over to Hormuz the orevious day, and had inspected the mines; he had found the situation even worse than he anticipated. It seems that the oxide is covered with a stratum of earth about 20 feet thick; before the oxide is dug out of the hillside this year of earth has to he removed, as otherwise it would fall ir n on the miners. When the management of the minas was in thsxxiiMxx. Xhxnxths the hands of the Customs, they used to emoloy a. small number of men during the summer months in clearing away this earth, so that when the full number of miners returned at the beginning of winter they could at once start working on the oxide. Last summer, however, the working of the mines bet ig in the hands o r the agent of the Mu 1 in-ut-Tuj jar no men were kept on during the summer months and work was altogether discontinued. The result is that it is now impossible to extract any more oxide until the stratum of earth has been removed; a ^sw hundred tons mlght perhaps be mined without any great risk but certainly not more. There KBMtae (l There are at present about loo miners employed at ifc the mines, including about 30 women and children. Owing to harvesting operations being now in progress labour is scarce, and the local coolies are never anxious to work for the Mu*in-ut-TuIjar when work is obtainable elsewhere. With the present number miners it will take till June merely to uncover tbe oxide, and after that work is discontinued till about the middle or end of Sentember. Hence it will be almost impossible for the Persian Government to deliver more than \ about 2000 tons to Messrs. F. C. Strick L Co. until the middle of next winter, 4, Monsieur Fourman tells me that he has telegraphed to the above effect to the Treasurer General, and has further nointed out that the result of being ordered to work in co-operation with the agent of the Mu*in-ut-Tujjar is that his hands are absolutely tied; he is given some measure of responsibility without any real executive authority. Re has warned the Government that &gt; £ unless promt measure^ are taken to meet the situationsituation it will be impossible for the latter to fulfil their contract. If the Customs are gl^en full control of the mines they will probably succeed in getting a larger number of co&amp;lies, as they feed them a good deal better than the Mu*in’s agent does, and by an of^er of higher wages they may be able to continue the work during a portion of the summer, and, unless Messrs. 7. 0. Strick &lt;B, Co make large shipments during the summer, they will probably succeed in meeting their demands* It seems very improbable, however, that the Persian Government will be able to furnish more theh 2000 tons to Messrs.

Letter from His Majesty’s Consul of same date p t Strick and Company, to Mr. Dorabjee. ’ * r / * Monsieur Fourman in conversation told me that about two months ago he had brought to the notice of the Central Administration the small output of oxide from the mines, and had asked for instructions : in reply he had received a tele gram about 3 weeks ago to the effect that the mining operations were in the hands of the Mu’in-ut-Tujjar. Since then he has received no further instruc tions, but the telegram which Monsieur Mornard, I understand, sent him via, Bushire on the 19th March, will presumably reach him on the 29th of this month. Monsieur Fourman stated there were at most 1,500 tons now available, and that the Persian Government would certainly have great difficulty in furnishing oxide to Messrs. Strick, should the latter ask for shipments in May and June, as they almost invariably do. The situation appears to be thoroughly unsatisfactory and unless the Director of Customs is promptly given full powers to take the matter in hand, it seems improbable that the Persian Government will be able to fulfil the contract. Locally it matters but little whether the Mu’in acts as concessionaire or agent of the Persian Government: the mining and shipping operations are in either case in his hands and are performed with equal inefficiency. Dated 27th March 1914. From— Mr. S. DORABJEE, Bandar Abbas, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Bandar Abbas. Mr. Maclean is Messrs. Strick’s Agent at Tehran. The good stock at Hormuz is at present 1,200 tons near the fort and 150 tons near the mines. It seems that only recently the Mu’in has sanctioned to increase the number of labourers, but I do not think they will succeed in getting many. Mirza Khalil is now dismissed and in his place one ’Abdullah ’Awazi is working at Hormuz. This morning I have received wire from London inquiring whether the Gov ernment offered old stock of oxide to others. Of course I do not know anything of the sort but shall be much obliged and grateful to you if you kindly inquire2 and let me know for the private information of Messrs. Strick, whether there is any such movement. No. 222, dated the 27th March 1914. From— CAPTAIN H. V. Biscoe, Assistant Resident and His Majesty's Consul Bandar Abbas, ' To— Mr. S.

Sir We have still to acknowledge receipt of your letter No.7243/14 of the 25th ultimo, relative to the Mouln-ut-Tujjar’s Oxide Concession, from which we note that a reply to our recent enquiry must he deferred, as the question of the Mouintudjar's Concession is at present the subject of discussion with the Persian Government. We have acted as the Agents of the Mouintudjar in this country for many years, and all contracts for the sale of his Oxide have passed through our hands as his agents. We have always loyally endeavoured to meet your wishes in the conduct of this business and successfully maintained the export of Oxide from Hormuz in British hands, in accordance with your desire, and devoted a very considerable amount of time and energy to the task of organising the business on lines agreeable to , yourself, Secretary of State, Foreign Office.yourself, relying on your assurances that you would not support an application for the concession by anyone else as long as the business continued to flow through British channels. The existing contract between the Persian Government and Messrs F.C.Strick and Company, which has been con cluded without our intermediary, expires in April 1915, and we now fear that if the present discussion with the Persian Government relative to the concession be pro- tracted we may again find our interests set aside by a new contract between either the Persian Government or the Mouln-ut-Tujjar and Messrs F.C.Strick and Company, Limited, or others. The Mouin-ut-Tujjar has agreed to give you in writing an undertaking only to sell his Oxide and other minerals through us as Agents if you withdraw your ob jections to his concession, in which event we hope you will secure this undertaicing for us. We trust that you will in any case endeavour to protect us in your discussion with the Persian Govern ment, either by an arrangement that we should continue toto be employed as Agents in the matter or otherwise, and that you will seize any opportunity that may pre sent itself in the course of your negotiations to pro cure for Messrs Andrew Weir and Company and ourselves some indemnification for losses incurred through the breach of the Mouin-ut-Tujjar's last contract with them and us.

Biscob, I.A., Acsistant Resident and His Majesty's Consul, Bandar Abbas, To Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K C.i.E., C.S.I., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. I have the honour to solicit a reference to the correspondence ending with my telegram, No 100, dated 24th October 1913, on the subject of the shipment of oxide from Hormuz by the S. S. ' Tangistan ” and the attitude of the Moin-ut- Tujjar’s agents relative to it. Monsieur Fourman, the Director of Customs, on his arrival here adopted a very firm attitude on this question, and informed the Moin’s agent that, in the event of his refusing to deliver oxide, the Customs would assume direct charge of the operations; as a result of this Mirza Khalil, the Moin’s agent at Hormuz, waived his objections regarding the receipts and undertook to deliver oxide on arrival of the ship. The S. S. “ Tangistan ” arrived on the 23rd, and work was begun. On the 26th November Messrs Strick’s agent wrote to the Director of Customs to the effect that the Moin’s agent was delivering only slightly over 200 tons a day, whereas formerly from 350 to 400 tons a day used to be delivered; on the 26th only 191 tons were delivered and a further complaint was addressed by Messrs. Strick’s agents to the Director of Customs. They also pointed out that the steamer was due to ship 300 tons of cargo at Maskat on the 3rd November, and that, if delayed beyond that date, this freight might be lost. Monsieur Fourrnan therefore, on the evening of the 27th, engaged a large number of additional coolies, and sent them over to Hormuz and had Mirza Khalil arrested and brought to Bandar Abbas. As a result of this prompt action on his part the work of loading proceeded more rapidly than before and the steamer was enabled to leave Hormuz at 1 p.m. on the 3rd November. On the 4th November, Mirza Khalil was released and permitted to return to Hormuz. On the 5th, however, the acting Deputy-Governor received a telegram from the Minister of the Interior to the effect that the latter was surprised to learn that the Moin’s agent had been forcibly deported from Hormuz, and directing his immediate release. A reply was sent that he had already been released. Monsieur Fourman informs me that enquiries have also been made from him by the Treasurer-General as to what occurred. Mirza Khalil has since received telegraphic instructions from the Moin not to return for the present to Hormuz as the matter was under discussion at Tehran. Monsieur Fourman recently discussed the whole question with me; he stated that there were at present about 4,000 tons of oxide lying at Hormuz, which hadbeen mined before the restoration of the concession to the Moin j that the Moin's agents were not working at the mines at the present time, and that if Messrs. Strick and Company made several shipments this winter the supply would run short unless work on the mines was recommenced. Further, that there were formerly 9 lighters,at. Hormuz, but &lt; were .now out of repair, and nothing was being done to repair them, and that with 4 lighters it was impossible to deliver oxide at. the rate it used to be delivered. I may mention that in the case of the •“ Tangistan ” shipment, even with the additional labour sent over from Bandar . Abbas, the maximum amount delivered in a day was 275 tons, a$ against an average of 350 tons formerly. As a result Monsieur Fourmah anticipated con- T siderable dithculty in loading steamers in the future. I n - I trust therefore that it may be possible to bring to the notice of Bis ; ^Majesty’s Minister the extremely unsatisfactory state of affairs at Hormuz, the only solution of which seems to be for authority to be obtained for the Director • of. Customs to take such steps as may be necessary for the reorganisation of the .mines, shipping arrangements, etc., since the instructionswhichtheMoin-ut- Tujjar professes to have issued have been entirely without effect. It would, I think, be difficult to obtain a better example of the evil effect of the Moin-ut- 1 ujjar’s influence in the Gulf than the difficulties which have at once arisen at Hormuz on the restoration of the concession to him, and should'the latter emerge victorious from the discussion which is apparently now going on at Tehran over the incident, it will probably lead to serious delays in the fulfilment of Messrs. Strick’s contract, and subsequent claims by the latter firm against the Persian Government. P .X—Since writing the above I have heard that the acting Deputy-Governor has received a telegram from the.Governor of the^Gulf Ports severely censuring him for interfering in the Moin-ut-Tujjar’s affairs and stating that he will be held personally responsible for any loss incurred by the Moin. ’* , ,7 / , f • H.

Moin is a very influential and powerful man and has, it is more than probable, given bribes to many Cabinet Ministers which they do not want to disgorge. It is stated in India Office letter dated the 19th ultimo that the main if not Sole interest of the Government of India in this question lies in strategical and political importance of islands situated at the mouth of the Persian Gulf. The above being the case would it not still be possible to arrive at some arrangement under which Larak, Ken jam and the more important part of I 'ism, from a military and naval point of view should be reserved for British interests and excluded from Koin’s Concession ?

Such being the case, would it not still be possible to make an arrangement under which Henjam, Larak, and the more important part of Kishm from a naval and military standpoint should be excluded from Muin’s concession, and reserved for British interests ?

Sir W. Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—{Received November 17.) (No. 239.) Sir, Tehran, October 29, 1913. WITH reference to my despatch No. 134 of the 20th June last and to my telegram No. 339 of the 27th September, I have the honour to transmit herewith a translation of the document obtained by the Muin-ut-Tujjar on the 9th September from the Persian Government confirming his Firman of 1904 and extending his rights to the mines of red oxide, salt, and sulphur on the “ islands of Hormuz, Kishm, Larek Henjam, and the ports of Bostaneh and Bandar Khamir ” for a period of fifty years. I addressed a “personal” letter to His Highness Ala-es-Sultaneh, the Prime Minister, on the 27th September strongly protesting against this proceeding. I stated that I had personally brought the matter to the notice of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on the 25th June when I explained to him that His Majesty’s Government were much interested in this question, and hoped that no further steps would be taken without their knowledge. I said that Mushaver-ul-Mamalek on that occasion took note of what I said and gave me to understand that the wishes of my Government as expressed by me would be borne in mind. I added that I was informing you, Sir, by telegraph of what had occurred, and upon receipt of your instructions I should have the honour to communicate the same to His Highness. In the meantime, as a mark of my displeasure, I have ceased to have official ! relations with the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, and conduct affairs direct with ; the Prime Minister or Minister of the Interior. It will be observed that the document now obtained by Muin-ut-Tujjar has only j been signed by four Cabinet Ministers, viz, Ala-es-Sultaneh, Momtaz-ed-Dowleh, | Kavam-es-Sultaneh, and Mustashar-ed-Dowleh. There is no doubt whatever that a good deal of money was paid by the Muin to one or more of these gentlemen for their [ signatures. Muin-ut-Tujjar is fully aware of the attitude I have taken up in the matter, and called on me lately to discuss it. He expressed his entire readiness to sign a document undertaking to take no foreigners into partnership, excepting British subjects, without the sanction of the British Minister. I have told him that I am still awaiting the instructions of His Majesty’s Government on the subject. As a result of my representations to Ala-es-Sultaneh, the original document which was in the Ministry of Public Works, has been withdrawn and in now in charge of the Prime Minister’s “ chef de cabinet.” I have, &amp;c., WALTER TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Document confirming Muin-ut-Tujjar’s Firman of 1904. (Translation.) # . . IN accordance with the Imperial firman issued in Rejeb 1322 (September—October 1904),* the concession for the mines of red oxide, salt, and sulphur in the islands of Hormuz, Kishm, Larek, Henjam, and the ports of Bostaneh and Bandar Khamir was given to Hajji Agha Mohammed Muin-ut-Tujjar Dehdashty. As the firman had no period and did not contain the necessary stipulations, a special agreement was made with regard to the red oxide in the island of Hormuz in accordance with the project put before t e National Assembly by the Government. Regarding the mines in the islands and at the ports above-mentioned, the Persian Government, through the intermediary oi^ the Ministry of Public Works, lays down the following limitations and desirable conditions, in order that the stipulations of the above-mentioned firman should be observed an * See Sir G. Barclay’s despatch No. 317 , December 19 , 1908 . [1933 r—10] W 5 DEC 1913 [Co Cory te i 5 DEC 19132 carried out in accordance with these conditions, and that Hajji Muin-ut-Tujjar should cease to consider his firman to be perpetual:— Article 1. The duration of this concession is for fifty solar years, and will date from the day of signature of this agreement. Art. 2. The concessionnaire must begin operations within one year from the datfl| of signature of this concession ; should he not do so and have no valid excuse this concession will become void. Art. 3. The concessionnaire may not institute any form of partnership unless the Government previously approves the conditions of such partnership and countersigns the same ; nor may he make any transfer without the Government’s permission. Art. 4. The concessionnaire may employ as many foreign engineers as are necessary for working the mines and smelting (?) the minerals; but all the workmen in the mines must be Persian subjects. Art. 5. The concessionnaire must keep regular accounts of all expenditure and receipts so that whenever the Ministry of Public Works sends a representative to investigate the accounts and ascertain the Government dues he may be able to carry out his mission easily. J t Art. 6. The concessionnaire must present to the Ministry of Public Works at the beginning of each month of Hamal yearly (22nd March) the accounts for the previous year, and ^ must pay 16 per cent, of the net profits to the Government. The interpretation of “net profits” includes the total receipts after the deduction of administrative expenses and the cost of mining and working the mines. Art. 7. The concessionnaire must sell salt at prices current in other parts of the Persian Gulf. If at any time the Government were to tax the mining and sale of salt in the whole of Persia the difference over and above 16 per cent, will be payable to the Government. Art. 8.^ Plant and material, and all installations necessary for mining and the transformation of minerals, for facilitating transport, such as carts, iron rails for a tramway, hauling cables which are necessary from the mine to the coast, will be free fiom taxes and customs duty, and the concessionnaire will only be subject to the legal customs regulations and will submit to that administration’s right to investigate the quantity, kind, and destination of the materials being imported or exported. Ait. 9. Mining products, whether transformed or not, when transported either abroad or into the interior will be free from customs duty or taxation. u r ^^ ie ma ^ n ^ enailce °f security in the places above mentioned will, of course, be under the responsibility of the Government. But, should the Government consider i necessaiy, t e concessionnaire may maintain the requisite number of guards, under the command of officers appointed by the Government at the expense of the conces sionnaire, until such time as the Government informs the concessionnaire that they are no longer necessary. • J Ait. 11.

The Moin stated that he would tell his Agent to be guided in this matter by the advice of the British Consul. The Moln’s intention was that his visit should serve the dual purpose of (1) making a pretence of being friendly and (2) of warning us that in the event of our thwarting him elsewhere he could make himself disagreeable to us by helping fchi on German enterprise on the Karun River. I should be tempted to suggest coming to terms with Moin but that the Indian Government are so strongly opposed to Mengeneh. We have the Moin on his knees now and could dictate our own ownership terms and if we desired that certain islands should be excluded from the concession, we could make a point of insisting on that stipulation. We can hardly demand that concessions shall not be given to Persians vide suggestion contained in Govern* ment of India telegram No.452 which was addressed to India Office and repeated to me, more especially if British subjects are not prepared to come forward as concessionaires.

Foreign Office November l5th. 1913. Sir: - I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to state, lor the information of the Marquess of Crewe, that upon receipt ol your letter of the 31st. ultimo, P.4451 regard ing Moin-ut-Tujjar's mining concession, he telegraphed to His Majesty's Minister at Teheran that His Majesty's uovernment considered tuat tne concession should be cancell ed and at the sane time instructed Sir ?/. Townley to inform the Persian Minister for foreign Affairs accordingly. Sir E. Grey has since had under consideration your letter under reference and the letter from the Admiralty of tne 6tn. instant - of which a copy was sent direct to your Department - as regards tne next step to be taken when once the concession has been cancelled. The question was also mentioned semiofficially by the Hoard of Trade - to which Department copies of the papers nave been sent -(51575 A3) and a possible solution of the difficulty has been suggested by them as follows: Assuming that the hoin* s new concession is cancelled, it will be necessary for His Majesty's Government to put forward some one or some body as a prospective concession aire on whom they can rely and over whom they can exercise some kind of control. To meet this end the Government of India have suggest ed the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as a suitable body but certain objections to tnis nomination are, it appears, entertained oy Lord Crewe, who has proposed instead the Persian Railways Syndicate. There is, however, no direct P £f‘X/ evidence that this Syndicate has had experience in mining. f fa t ;v, ^ /L hnAvyni k On the other hand both Messrs. Ellinger and Messrs M Strick have been interested in the mining question and their claims have in fact formed the subject of consideration by His Majesty's Government for some considerable time past. It is, therefore, submitted that the requirements 01 His Majesty' s Government might be met and their position(51575/13) 'I-—\ ' be satisfactorily maintained if the two firms of Ellinser and Strick could be induced to unite forces and on forming a Company for tne purpose under conditions satisfactory to His Majesty’s Government, be put forward as the Government nominees. The advantage of this aorrangement would be that it would ensure the business falling into the hands of parties with previous experience of it and that it would facilitate a settlement of the conflict regarding the claims and complaints of the two firms by compelling them in their own interest to come to an arrangement with one another. The Company might have only the oxide concession or a concession giving general mining rights but it would of course be desirable that oil should be reserved. Should His Lordship concur in the proposal as set forth above, Sir E. Grey would invite the Board of Trade to endeavour to secure such an arrangement between Messrs. El linger - who, there is some reason to believe, would accept it - and Messrs. Strick whose views on the subject are at present unknown. As(51575/13) As it is desirable that no time should be lost in arriving at a decision, Sir E. Grey would be glad to receive His Lordsnip's reply as soon as may be convenient. 1 am, Si r, Your most obedient, humble Servant,In any further communica tion on this subject, please quote UUAO OUUJVTtJt, JJICi M-01812. and address letter to— The Secretary, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W.

Sir, Your obedient Servant, 'he Under Secretary of State, India Office, S.W YN0V1Su-oimt. 6 th November 15 ^Qoret and Immediate :- Sir, Adverting to Admiralty letters of the 9th July last and 2nd ultimo,on the subject of the Muiiwit-Tujjar's concession, I an comnanded by my Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty to offer the following observations on the question raised in Sir ^.Cox’s telegram of the 23rd October as to the bearing on this matter of the Admiralty scheme of oil development in Persia. 2. - dy Lords concur generally in Sir P.Cox’s remarks as to the necessity of excluding arc/ other general mining concessions from the area of the d’Arcy concession, and the desirability of obtaining tor some British nominee an extension of that concession which would cover all the islands now in question. It appears that the cancellation of the Main’s concession is a necessary preliminary to securing these objects, and My Lords are glad to learn that there is now a general consensus of opinion that it must be cancelled, and that this can be effected without serious difficulty. 3 . - It would in any case be essential to prevent any attempt to encroach upon the existing d’Arcy concession, and consequently, if the Muin’s concession is not simply cancelled, it would require close examination to what extent, if any, his claims overlap the B’Arcy concession. 4 . - As regards the Anglo Persian Oil Co., at the present stage of the negotiations between the Admiralty [Jnder Secretary of State, and Foreign Of fice.•f and the Company it, would not, he correct, t,o say that, His Majesty's Govemraent can 'dominate' it, nor is it, practicable to insist upon the maintenance of its independent, British status until some actual agreement, with the Admiralty is arrived at. ^ith reference however to the opinions expressed in paragraph 3 of India Office lot,ter of 31st f ^ ! ultimo, My Lords do not think that such uncertainty as ma 1 ’ | U M I ©xist as to the fiitur# status of the Conpany need he regarded as nakioig it an 'undesirable concessionaire' in respect of the comparatively small additions to its existing large concession now in question,-subject to the condition named below. It would bo difficult to work oil concessions on that side of the Gulf except through the Company and the introduction of some other concessionaire would cause inconvenience at a later stage if an Admiralty agreement with the Anglo Persian Oil Co. is ultimately carried through, and !*/ Lords would therefore advocate the Cck being asked as to their desire to obtain an extension of their concess'on, such extension not to be alienated without the consent of His Majesty's Government and to be transferable to other nominees of His Majesty’s Government if an agreement between the Anglo Persism Oil Co. and the Admiralty is not ultimately effected. This might be of advantage to the Admiralty in the negotiations now proceeding and might strengthen their position in insisting upon the Company's retaining an independent British status. 5.- If the Anglo Persian Co. do not desire these concessions or are unable to accept the specified conditions, thon the question of some other suitable concessionaire coulcybe J , considered■/y r # _ A copy of this letter has been sent to the India Office.

Muin-ut-Tujjar to Messrs. Ellinger and Co. [Printed literally.] Dear Sirs, October 8, 1913. IT is now a long time that I have not received any letter from you, although I was expecting to learn from you what arrangement was arrived at between you and Messrs. Strick and Co. regarding your claims. There was seven months that Messrs. Strick had not despatched any steamer for the loading of oxide, but some days ago information was received that would send steamship “ Tanguestan ” for shipping of 2,500 tons for America. I thought that perhaps some arrangement had been arrived at with your good selves, and I made enquiries about same from British Legation at Tehran, but was informed that they had no news about it. I then applied to Mr. Maclean, the agent for Messrs. Strick, and I was told that Messrs. Strick and Co. had replied to you, but I could not understand what reply had been given to you. Few months ago the Persian Foreign Office informed the British Legation at Tehran that, unless Messrs. Strick settle Messrs. Ellinger and Co.’s claims in a month, no oxide would be shipped until such time that Messrs. Ellinger’s claims were settled according to laws. The British Legation informed London of same, and is waiting for the reply, which has not arrived as yet. Please let me know if you have had any arrangement with Messrs Strick. With reference to the other mines which were in my concession, I was for some time negotiating with the Government, and the matter was settled about a month ago, and a decision was taken by the Government. The British Legation got from me the assurance that I would let no any other but British subjects to participate in my concession, which I promised. They are now discussing the matter with London and Indian Government. The British Legation is somewhat angry that the matter was concluded without the information of the legation. I was under the impression that, owing to the assurances that Sir Edward Grey gave to me both through you and through the British Legation at Tehran that he would protect my rights, he would be now glad that I succeeded, and would help me. But, misfortunately, I see the contrary. I gave the assurance to the legation not to give any share in the concession to non-English subjects, and to serve to their aims in the measure if possible. I think that the Britith Minister has got the assurance, as I see that he is inclined to make an arrangement to give me the assurance that he will help me in future.

We have, &amp;c., For Frank C.Strick and Company, Limited. (Signed) J. W. Holmes. Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.TRANSLATION OF CONCESSION GRANTED BY THE PERSIAN GOVERNMENT TO HAJI AGHA MOHAMMED MOIN UT-TOJAR. Dated September 9th, 1918. In accordance with the Imperial Firman issued in Rejeb, 1822 (Sept.-Oct., 1904), the concession for the mines of red oxide, salt and sulphur in the islands of Hormuz, Kishm, Larak, Henjam and the ports of Bostaneh and Bander Khamir was given to Haji Agha Mohammed Moin-ut-Tojar Dehdashty. As the Firman had no period and did not contain the necessary stipulations, a special Agreement was made with regard to the red oxide in the island of Hormuz in accordance with the project put before the National Assembly by the Government. Regarding the mines in the islands and at the ports above mentioned the Persian Government, through the intermediary of the Minister of Public Works, lays down the following limitations and desirable conditions in order that the stipulations of the above-mentioned Firman should be observed and carried out in accordance with these conditions and that Haji Moin-ut-Tojar should cease to consider his Firman to be perpetual. Aeticle I. The duration of this concession is for fifty solar years, and will date from the day of signature of this Agreement. Aetiole II. The Concessionaire must begin operations within one year from the date of signature of this concession ; should he not do so, and have no valid excuse, this concession will be void.Article III. The Concessionaire may not institute any form of partnership unless the Government previously approves the conditions of such partnership and countersigns the same, nor may he make any transfer without the Government permission, Article IY. The Concessionaire may employ as many foreign engineers as are necessary for working the mines and smelting (?) the minerals ; but all the workmen in the mines must be Persian subjects. Article Y. The Concessionaire must keep regular accounts of all expenditure and receipts, so that whenever the Ministry of Public Works sends a representative to investigate the accounts and ascertain the Government dues he may be able to carry out his mission easily. Article YI. The Concessionaire must present to the Ministry of Public Works at the beginning of each month of “ Hamar’ yearly (March 22) the accounts for the previous year, and must pay 16 per cent, of the net profits to the Government. The interpretation of “ net profits ” includes the total receipts after the deduction of adminis trative expenses and the cost of mining and working the mines. Article YII. The Concessionaire must sell salt at prices current in other parts of the Persian Gulf. If at any time the Government were to tax the mining and sale of salt in the whole of Persia, the difference over and above 16 per cent, will be payable to the Government. Article YIII. Plant and materials and all installations necessary for mining and the transformation of minerals, for facilitating transport, such as carts, iron rails for a tramway, hauling cables wdiich are neces sary from the mine to the coast, will be free from taxes and Customs duty, and the Concessionaire will only be subject to the legal Customs regulations and will submit to that Administration’s right to investigate the quantity, kind and destination of the materials being imported or exported. Article IX. Mining products, whether transformed or not, when transported either abroad or into the interior will be free from Customs duty or taxation.mmm 3 Article X. The maintenance of security in the places above mentioned will, of course, be under the responsibility of the Government. But should the Government consider it necessary, the Concessionaire may maintain the requisite number of guards under the command of officers appointed by the Government at the expense of the Concessionaire, until such time as the Government informs the Concessionaire that they are no longer necessary. Article XI. At the termination of the period of this concession, all the mines and necessary installations for the working of the same will revert to the Government without payment or compensation, but extracted products ready at the mines, will belong to the Concessionaire. After the expiration of the period should the Government desire to grant a concession for the said mines, the Concessionaire shall have priority on equal terms. Article XII. Should a difference arise between the Government and the Concessionaire regarding the terms of this concession, it will be re ferred to two arbiters, one appointed by the Government and the other by the Concessionaire. In the case of difference between the two arbiters, a third arbiter previously named by these two arbiters shall finally decide the point at issue. It was approved at the Meeting of Tuesday, the 7th of Shavval (133l) (September 9th, 1913) and the Ministry of Public Works is authorized to see to the carrying out of the Firman (and) concession in accordance with the above stipulations.

Moreover, the circumstances mentioned in Sir W. Townley' s telegram No. 339 of 27th September seem to make it imperative that the concession should be cancelled, for the reason which he himself gave in his telegram No. 363 of 17th October. As regards the next step after cancellation Lord Crewe in common with the Government of India concurs generally in the v 1 ewsBut the uncertainty as to the future of the Anglc-Persian Oil Company seems to make that Company at present an undesirable con cessionaire, and it is for consid\^ in'bn-h.'hAr' the.

Foreign Secret. Your telegram of 18th October. Moin-ut-Tujjar. We concur generally in views expressed by Cox’s telegram of 23rd October which was repeated to yon. If Anglo-Persian Oil Company became concessionaire of mining rights, it should be possible for them to come to some arrangement which will satisfy conflicting claims of Messrs. Strick and Ellinger. We presume that our support of Anglo-Persian Oil Company will depend on permanency of British character of that Company. Consul at Mohammerah reports that Germans are forming at Ahwaz transport companies on Ahwaz Ispahan road in opposition to Messrs. Lynch. :/ j/ From Sir P. Cox to Government of India, Foreign Department, 23rd October 1913. (Repeated to Minister at Tehran and India Office). Yorir telegram No. 463 S and previous correspondence. On return from tour 1 have seen Minister’s telegram No. 365 to Foreign Office regarding lease of wharf to Germans and have also learnt from Sir Edmund Slade details ohscope of oil scheme contemplated by Admiralty. As regards first question. In view of conciliatory attitude of Germany during currency of negotiations it would seem impolitic to obstruct a transaction which though inconvenient cannot be ultimately prevented without .appearance of hostility. As regards Admiralty scheme ; its operations may extend to islands and hinterland of Persian coast, both of which are covered by Article 1 of D’Arcy concession. Consequently the importance of securing general mining con cession for Pritish nominee or retention of control by Persian Goverment becomes greatly accentuated. Moreover, apart from other objections already mooted, it might justly be contended that grant of concession to Muin would be incompatible with D’Arcy concessions so far as mining of oil is concerned, and that it would be highly inconvenient to have two concessions overlapping in same tract. Both practically and internationally our position in Gulf is very much stronger now than it was in time of Muin’s former concession, and in my judgment we can afford to defy his hostility so far as Gulf sphere is concerned ; and in view of his threat quoted in Minister’s telegram above mentioned and of fresh and cogent considerations imported into problem by Admiralty scheme I agree that we should certainly do so. I would urge that breach of assurances by Persian Government affords us ample grounds for giving warning on lines suggested in conclusion of my telegram No. 80/1020, but in more formal terms. After demanding cancellation of lease, I suggest that we should exact formal undertaking either that scope of D’Arcy concessions should be extended so as to cover general mining rights in the islands and immediate hinterlands of Gulf coast; or, failing that, that Persian Government should be required to undertake to retain such general rights in their own hands and, give no concession for them except to Anglo- Persian Oil Company in extension of D’Arcy concession; or to some other approved British nominee. They might be finally informed that failing compliance with one of the above alternatives, or in the event of any attempt to violate undertakings now given, British Government would have to take immediate steps to place their interests in the island ports and the immediate hinterland, as covered by the D’Arcy concession, out of further danger. I gather that some action on these lines was contemplated by Minister in his telegram No. 339 to Foreign Office. The above observations presuppose that Admiralty would have to work their scheme through Oil Company, and that British Government can dominate latter, financially or otherwise.in any further comamn.ra ti on on this subject, please quote No. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

MY telegram No. 363 Muin called yestei da} T to show a telegram from Ham burg—America Line applying for lease of a wharf at Mengeneh. He said that he would instruct his agent to follow advice of the British consul in this matter. His visit was intended to serve two purposes : to make a show of friendship, and to warn jis thathe can make himself disagreeable by encouraging German enterprise 0n the Kashga^ if we thwart him elsewhere. Were~GOvernment of India not so strongly opposed to Muin, I should be tempted to suggest coming to terms with him. We have him on his knees now and could make our own conditions, and if we desired to exclude certain islands from the concessions we could insist on that. We can hardly demand, as is suggested in the Viceroy’s telegram No. 452 to Secretary of State for India, repeated to me, that concessions should not be given to Persians, more especially if there are no British subjects to take them up.

Following sent to Foreign Office August 29th No.297 and repeated to you by instructions Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. 'I had conversation with jtfoin-ut-Tujjar yesterday during which I explained to him that Government of India consider that he has proved himself consistently hostile to British interests and that no undertaking he could give that he would behave better in future would suffice as a safeguard. He begs that he may be informed in what parti cular he had shown himself hostile to British interests. He owns that in trade questions on Karun he has had many differences with Messrs Lyneh but argues that he has always obeyed the Injunction of the legation not to interest himself in any but British Firms in his enterprises. Moin-ut-Tujjar is a tricky old gentleman who has anan iron in most Persian fires but I think he could be made to run straight if he realised it is in his own interest to do so. He declares he is prepared to make an w ' arrangement that we may wish about participation in his concessions. At the present moment question is at stand still and is unlikely to make much progress as long as it is known that it meets with oui? opposition but Moin-ut-Tujjar may make himself objectionable in many ways if he sees that his schemes are thwarted by us. Under existing circumstances it would not be easy to secure concessions for British subjects but something might be done were a definite request for a concession made. I am inclined to think that we could reach more satisfactory arrangement in conjunction with Moin-ut- Tuj jar than by endeavouring to oust him in favour of British subjects. Repeated Bushire*’(1081).

By this act Persian Government have not only wilfully ignored the communica tion dated the 24th January 1911 addressed to this Legation stating that the concession had terminated but they have paid no heed to the assurance given to me by the acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, whilst it is very doubtful whether a decision of the Mojlis can be legally reversed by the Cabinet, which only consists of four members all of whom signed the declaration. Prime Minister maintains that the representation made by me on behalf of His Majesty’s Government was not brought to the notice of the Cabinet. It is most desirable in my opinion that we should show extreme displeasure at this unfriendly act by demand ing the cancellation of the declaration and the immediate dismissal of tbe Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs.

In spite of the assurances given me by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs on 25th June last that no further action would be taken respecting Muin’s concessions without reference to me, idle Persian Government has signed a declaration stating that the duration of the concessions is for fifty years from 9th September. By so doing they have not only wilfully ignored the communication addressed to this legation on 24th January, 1911, declaring the concessions terminated, but no heed has been paid to the assurance given to me by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, whilst it is extremely doubtful whether the Cabinet can legally reverse a decision of the Medjliss. The Cabinet only^consists of four members, all of whom signed the declaration. The Prime Minister asserts that the Cabinet were not made aware of the representation made by me on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. I would venture to express an opinion that it is most desirable that this unfriendly act should be visited by some mark of extreme displeasure, such as a demand for the instant dismissal of the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and the cancellation of the declaration. In the event of a refusal to comply with such demand, the islands or part of the same might be occupied. Unless some strong action is taken it will be found impossible to control Muin, who has of course bribed on a large scale and who is inclined to be defiant, although he has agreed under pressure to sign a document undertaking to enter into partnership with no one but British subjects in the exploration of the concessions.

If by any device Henjam could be eliminated, it would of course be better, but I do not quite see how that could be done. Above arrangement will not eliminate though it may mitigate the baleful influence of M(oin) on the administration of Gulf ports, but it would seem to safeguard us so far as lower islands are concerned and give us a definite check on M(oin). If it were possible that the nationality of the syndicate should be British it would be greatly preferable and Moin might be conceivably tempted by consideration that he would thus become entitled to a measure of British protection. (Addressed to Foreign ; repeated to Minister).” We adhere to opinions expressed in my telegram of 16th July, but if it is impossible to eliminate Moin then we agree that if conditions proposed b} Bushire are insisted on our interests will be sufficiently safeguarded and our support might be accorded to Moin.If10874. 1.1033. 2000 — 5/1911. !■ tfo^L MWtTVrm TO, 3 lining Oonoesstons (for red oxide, etc. ) in the Islands and Goast of t?i6 Persian Gulf; the IMn- ut-T ujjar f s position.

It may he noted that the Ifutn inter preted this as covering all the islands in the Gulf, and went so far as to try to mine on Sirri and Tomb Island. In 1909 the Gontral Government declared this finnan to be expired. The Main claimed it to be 'in perpetuity' and started a campaign of agitation to get it revived. The result of his efforts was that he obtained in 1910 a concession for 10 years for mining rights on Hormuz , which loas confirmed by a decree of the Mejjiss passed in November 1911. He is still agitating, with some prospects of success, for the, recovery of the rest of his original concession. Tne islands which the Ifuin claims are the strategical hey to the Gulfi and His Lajesty 1 s Government desires to have control over them, either by means of a friendly understanding with the Persian Government as to our rights there, or by obtaining a concession over them for a reliable British fine.

The latter had employed Messrs. El linger as his Agents in Europe j and Messrs.

That, instead of his old concessions being renewed, a fresh concession should he obtained to include Persian littoral and Persian islands of the Gulf, which the Foreign Office letter of 4th December, 1912, to Greenway reserved for ‘ separate and later negotiation,’ and that this concession should be obtained jointly by Muin and either the Ellinger group or the Greenway group, or both combined. “ 2. That no non-British elements should be introduced, and no enterprise undertaken on Kishm, Larak, or Henjam without the previous concurrence of the British and Persian Governments. If by any device Henjam could be eliminated, it would of course be better, but I do not quite see how that could be done. Above arrangement will not eliminate though it may mitigate the baleful influence of Muin on the administration of the Gulf ports, but it would seem safe for us as far as the lower islands are concerned, and give us a definite check on Muin. If it were possible that the native syndicate should be British it would be greatly preferable, and Muin might be conceivably tempted by consideration that he would thus become entitled to a measure of British protection. ^ “ (Addressed to Foreign Department, India ; repeated to Tehran.) I should be glad to learn as soon as convenient if I am authorised to discuss situation with Muin on these lines, and if a British group is likely to be forthcoming to work with Muin on the proposed or any other conditions.In any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 40937/13. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Ofhce, London.

Sir: - I ar? directed ty tie Board of Trade to advert to your letter of June 26th (No. 28272) and subs6ouent communications, respecting the proposed grant to the Muin-ut-Tujjar of fresh concessions in the Persian Gulf and to offer the following observations with refer ence thereto:- The Board agree with what they understand to he the views entertained by the Lords of the Admiralty and the India Office that it is of first importance that no influence antagonistic to British interests should be exercised over aryv portion of the entrance to the Gulf. They further entertain grave doubts wh e t h e r any arrangements solely w i t h t h e u in, how - ever recorded, would constitute an adeouate safeguard for the effectual protection of those interests in the event The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.evsnt of a new concession 'being granted to bin of j mining rights over Kishm, Hormuz and Henjam. The Board note from the Foreign Office telegram of August llth to His Majesty's Minister at Tehran that Sir W. Townley has been asked for his opinion as to whether the objections entertained by the India office and the Admiralty could be removed by any arrangement with the Muin or whether the p ersian Government could be induced to give the concessions in question to British subjects. If the latter of these two courses could be arranged it would naturally be the more satis factory to His Majesty's Government; but if the former should have to be adopted, the Board are disposed to think that some safeguard might be found by arranging with the Persian Government for the Muin to be de finitely bound to a certain line of action by the terms of his concession which should be explicitly defined in a manner satisfactory to His Majesty's Government. It would be an additional security if the Persian Gov ernment could be induced to make a Declaration, also in terms satisfactory to His Majesty's Government, as to the intent of the concession. The Board gather that for the moment the political and strategic considerations advanced by the India Of ficeOffice end the Admiralty outweigh any merely commercial ones, and they have some doubt whether in the circum stances it is requisite to discuss the commercial as pects of the matter at this stage. From a purely commercial point of view, however, the Board would welcome any arrangement by which the red oxide and other minerals produced under any concession affecting the areas in question should be sold to, or handed over for sale on commission by, British firms. They doubt ( as a consequence of a communication which they have recently had with • 'r. hart in Ellinger whether it would be practicable for a satisfactory understanding to be arranged between essrs. Ellinger and Messrs. Strick as to their respective claims to tion under a prospective concession, and, if no ar rangement of the sort could in fact be effected, they would prefer to find that Messrs. Ellinger had regained their position as agents for the Muin, by which means some compensation might be afforded them for the losses they have already sustained. On the other receive any of the products resulting from exploita hand they note that Messrs. Strick have a contract with the Persian Government up to March, 1915. eventi T\r * event therefore of t J ^e letter firm desiring to renew that contract or to enter into a contract with the uin for the maintenance of their existing position, the Board do not think that His Majesty’s Government could properly advocate the claims of Messrs. El- linger as against those of Messrs. Strick, or vice - versa . Should it eventually he decided to support the M uin’s application, subject to compliance on his part with certain conditions to he imposed upon him hy the P ersian Government, in agreement with His Majes ty's Government, it occurs to the Board that a set tlement might possibly he arrived at hy the conces sion being given for a period of say 20 years from the date of expiry in 1920 of the Main's present con cession, with a prospect of renewal for successive periods of ten years, and covering all the privileges enjoyed hy him under the firman of 1904; the uin on his part engaging to sell oxide only to a British firm or firms nominated hy His Majesty's Government. If His Majesty's Government are in a position to block the concession to the lain, it would seem to he not impossible to impose some such terms upon him as the priceprice of the withdrawal of their opposition. I am to add that it might he desirable to suggest to the Persian Government that in any concession of the nature in question which may he granted to any person or company, some clause might he included which will secure that the royalty to he paid to that Gov ernment hy the concessionnaire shall he proportionate to the profit realised and shall not he such as to preclude the profitable working of the concession or any part of it. In particular the Board understand that it is only with a safeguard of this character that a concessionnaire might he enabled to exploit the sulphur deposits at Bostaneh, which it would appear cannot he profitably developed except hy native enter prise .

Sir With reference to your letter of July 30th. rela tive to the attempt of Muin-ut-Tujjar to recover the concessions which he formerly held for the exploitation of mineral deposits on the coast and islands of the Persian Gulf, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward Grey to transmit to you herewith copy of a telegram from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran reporting, with comments, a conversation which he has recently had with ruin on the subject. I am to state that Sir E. Grey would be glad, to receive any observations which the arquess of Crewe may wish to offer on Sir W.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received August 29, 6 p.m.) A') Tehran, August 29, 1913 (August 29, 2 p.m.) (No. 297.) (f YOUR telegram No. 347 I had conversation with Muin yesterday, during which I explained to him that the Government of India consider that he has proved himself consistently hostile to British interests and that no undertaking which he could give that he would behave better in the future would suffice as a safeguard. He begs that he may be informed in what particular he has shown himself hostile to British interests. He owns that in trade questions on the Karun he has had many differences with Messrs. Lynch, but argues that he has always obeyed the injunction of the legation not to interest any but British firms in his enterprises. Muin is a tricky old gentleman who has an iron in most Persian fires, but 1 think he could be made to run straight if he realised that it is in his own interests to do so. He declares that he is prepared to make any arrangement that we may wish about participation in his concession. At the present moment question is at a standstill, and is unlikely to make much progress as long as it is known that it meets with our opposition, but Muin may make himself objectionable in many ways if he sees that his schemes are thwarted by us. Under existing circumstances, it would not be easy to secure concessions for British subjects, but something might be done were a definite request for a concession made. I am inclined to think that we could reach more satisfactory arrangement in conjunction with Muin than by endeavouring to oust him in favour of British subjects. 4. j [ 1019 - 5611[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] PERSIA. .j .

WITH reference to my telegram No. 243 of to-day’s date, on tlie subject of tbe negotiations now in progress between Muin-ut-Tujjar and the Persian Government, whereby the former desires to regain possession of the islands in the Persian Gulf, and other places mentioned in the firman of 1904, I have the honour to enclose^ herewith, copy of a memorandum of an interview, between myself and the conces sionaire, on the 18th instant, at which I requested him to explain how the matter of his concessions in the Gulf actually stood. Mr. Churchill had, by my instructions, spoken to the Minister of the Interior previously on the subject, and had pointed out to His Highness that the sole rights possessed by the Muin were those conferred by the Act passed by the Medjliss in November 1911, which related to the island of Hormuz alone. Mr. Churchill went fully into the circumstances under which the firman of 1904, dealing with various other islands and places, had been terminated. Ain-ed-Dowleh appeared to think that Muin had still an interest in these other islands and places under the firman in question, but admitted that he was not very familiar with the case, which, he said, was being studied by a committee. Subsequently Mr. Churchill was told that the whole question is now being considered by a committee of members of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, and that the grant of a new concession, on the lines of concessions granted to foreign subjects, is under contemplation. Mr. Churchill expressed the hope that this legation would be consulted as His Majesty’s Government were interested in the matter. I have, &amp;c. W. TOWNLEY. Enclosure in No. 1. Memorandum. MUIN-UT-TUJJAR called on His Majesty’s Minister yesterday, and was asked how the matter of his concessions in the Persian Gulf now stood. He maintained that his 1904 firman was perpetual, and that his rights to the islands and places (other than Hormuz), according to that document, remained unshaken. He stated that all the Ministers of the last Cabinet, and all the members of the present Cabinet (including Vossuk-ed-Dowleh), had given him separate signed declarations stating that they considered his firman to be perpetual. His Majesty’s Minister told him that the Persian Government had officially informed His Majesty’s legation that his firman had lapsed. His Majesty’s Government were of opinion that the Persian Government had every right to terminate the firman, and had so written to certain third parties. According to our view the Muin’s only mining interests in the Gulf now were those dealt with in the Medjliss Decree of November, 1911, relating to Hormuz. Having thus cleared the ground, His Majesty’s Minister proceeded to speak very plainly to the Muin. He was told that he must realise that conditions had much altered in the Gulf of late, and he should try to conform to the altered circumstances. His Majesty’s Government had very important political interests at stake there. The Muin’s influence in the past had been harmful, and had made for corruption and bad government. From this state of affairs the Gulf was now slowly emerging, and unless he could assure us that he would loyally co-operate in the work in hand, His Majesty s legation would have to use all the influence it possessed to prevent him from regaining his old position in respect to the islands in question. . [2987 ee—6] /wh* L 15 AUG 1913,3 - IE2 Muin-nt-Tujjar declared that he was fully alive to the altered circumstances, and said that he was quite prepared to give the legation a written undertaking that he would, in all matters concerning his interests in the islands of the Gulf, take into consideration the desires and interests of the British Government, and follow the advice given to him by the British Representative. His object had been, and would , continue to be, solely the furtherance of his own commercial interests, and, if in the past, the pursuance of those interests had sometimes brought him into conflict with ours he was very sorry for it, but he would see that this did not occur in the future. His Majesty’s Minister reminded Muin that in the past his connection with the Gulf had been a regime of bribery and corruption. If he had been in the past the strong man of the Gulf, with the local Governors under his influence, he must understand that such a state of affairs would no longer be tolerated by His Majesty’s Government, who were now the real masters in that region. His Majesty’s Minister made a strong appeal to the Muin to try to work in unison and co-operation with the British Legation and the British Resident at Bushire. Otherwise the legation would undoubtedly be obliged to block his present attempt to regain control over the islands .and places, other than Hormuz, over which only, as at present advised, did we consider him to have any control whatever. The Muin reiterated his willingness to fall in with the wishes of His Majesty’s Minister, and it was arranged that, at a subsequent meeting, a detailed agreement on the subject should be arrived at.

This rumour was afterwards denied and the Muin promised that he would give us information if at any time he proposed to part with his r3&amp;-&amp;/ rights, hut it was so circumstantial and on such good authority that there is some reason to think that it was as a matter of fact founded on fact.

The xawBit disturbance^ of June 1912 at Bandar Abbas, when sea rral hundred men tooj^ refuge at the British Consulate, was directly due to the Muin's intrigues.

No. 229, dated loth June 1913. ~ Telegram P., No. 268/957, dated 28th May 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty's Minister, Tehran. I am informed by the Governor that he has received telegrams from Moin- ut-Tujjar, Mushir-es-Sultaneh and Ain-ed-Dowleh with the object of persuading him to countenance the appointment, as his assistant here, of Vaqar-ul-Mulk, who has recently retired from Dizful, Such an assistant is not wanted by the Governor who suspects, and probably justifiably, that the three officials mentioned above have some ulterior motive in wishing to foist their protege upon him. His relations with the Moin have not for some time past been cordial and he is particularly suspicious of the latter’s appeal. Firstly, I beg that Your Excellency will endeavour to find out the object with which the proposal has been made, and secondly, is it possible for Your Excellency to deprecate the proposal on the grounds that we must see that no expenditure of an unnecessary nature is incurred in the Gulf Ports ? Telegram P., No. 280/1020, dated 6th June 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Foreign, No. 1020.) With reference to my telegram No. 268/957 in which I reported that the Minister of the Interior and Moin were attempting to induce the Governor of Gulf Ports to accept, as his personal assistant, a protege of theirs. It has now become apparent what the motive of this scheme is. The Minister of the Interior has just telegraphed to the Governor stating that seeing that the quarrel between the Moin and the Treasurer General has been patched up, and that the Moin has recovered the position that he formerly held in respect to Hormuz, it has therefore become very necessary that he should also be given back all the districts farmed to him by the firman of I 9 p 4 &gt; in order that the working of the other mines may be facilitated. In conclusion the Minister of the Interior says betakes for granted that the Governor will do all he can in assisting to bring this about. No doubt the Minister of the Interior has been bribed to lend his assistance in the matter. From the point of view of the Gulf administration and our general interests here, to allow the Moin to get back his farm would, as far as I can see, be an everlasting pity. By it, a reversion to the former corrupt state of affairs which the Gulf is by degrees growing out of, would be involved, and incidentally it would render impossible the framing of a satisfactory Gulf Budget, and the Budget already drawn up would be greatly interfered with. You are aware that the Moin gives us infinite trouble whenever we have any dealings with him in respect to our general interests in the Gulf region.It is plain from the Foreign Office letter to Ellinger dated January 6th, what the attitude of the Persian Government and the Foreign Office was then, and I trust that Your Excellency will find it possible, unless you have received other instructions in the meanwhile, to think of some plan for defeating the intrigue which the Minister of the Interior and the Moin are now carrying on. In respect to current questions, will you please refer^ to the correspondence relating to Bostana and other sulphur deposits embodied in the telegram address ed by you to the Foreign Office No. 49 2 September 1912 ? Are we not justified in saying that we object to this farm on financial grounds, in view of the lien we have on the revenues of the Gulf? and with reference to the islands forming the strategic position ’at the entrance to the Gulf, viz*, Henjam, Kishm and Larak, could we not give them a verbal hint to the effect that conditions have altered and that unless the Central Administration continues to exercise direct control over the islands in the Gulf which belong to Persia, it will be incumbent on us, for the protection of our interests, to adopt such measures as may seem called for ? Telegram P., No. 229, dated (and received) 10th June 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. With reference to your telegram No. 268. Yesterday I mentioned the matter of Vaqar-ul-Mulk’s proposed appointment to Bushire to the Minister of the Interior. He stated that such an intention had never existed. lam inclined to think, however, that when it was realised that the appointment would meet with: opposition, the idea was abandoned. The Moin*ut-Tujjar who, it would appear, has recovered all the rights he; formerly enjoyed, will be the subject of a further communication from me.

We are consulting all three Departments. In the meanwhile, pressure by Persian Government on Strict may make him more disposed to come to terms with Ellinger, which is what we want.

Tehran, June 20, 1913. {June 20, 3 p.m.) FOLLOWING from consul-general at Bushire, 6th June :— “ Please see my telegram reporting an attempt on the part of the Minister of the Interior and Muin-ut-Tujjar to get the Governor to appoint protege of theirs as his personal assistant. Motive is now apparent. Governor has now received a telegram from the Minister of the Interior saying that, Muin-ut-Tujjar having made up his differences with Treasurer-General and having recovered his former position as regards Hormuz, it has become very necessary, in order to facilitate working of other mines, that all the districts farmed to him under the firman of 1904 should be restored to him. Minister of the Interior concludes by saying that he has no doubt that Governor will afford all co-operation to that end. Minister of the Interior has no doubt been squared. “ As far as I can see it would be an everlasting pity from the point of view of the Gulf administration and our general interests to let Muin-ut-Tujjar get back his farm. It would mean reversion to old corrupt order of things, which the Gulf is gradually growing out of, and incidentally it would make the framing of satisfactory Gulf budget impossible, and would upset that already made. As regards our general interests, you are aware that wherever we come into contact with Muin-ut-Tujjar in the Gulf region he gives us infinite trouble. “ From Foreign Office letter of 6th January to Ellinger it is plain what the attitude of the Foreign Office and the Persian Government was then, and unless you have received other instructions I trust that you will find it possible to devise some means of defeating the present intrigue on the part of Muin-ut-Tujjar and Minister of the Interior. “ As regards current questions, please see correspondence regarding sulphur not our lien in revenues of the Gulf warrant us in saying that we object to this f on financial grounds ? And as regards islands of Kishm and Larak and Henjam, w comprise strategical position at the entrance to the Gulf, could we not hint verbally tc Persian Government that times have changed, and that unless the Persian island the Persian Gulf are retained under the direct control of the Central Admmistrs we shall have to take such steps as may seem called for to safeguard our interests r I find that Muin-ut-Tujjar is endeavouring to regain possession of the islands and other places mentioned in the firman of 1904. The Minister of the Interior is supporting him, and he savs that he has declarations from all the Ministers giving it as their opinion that his fimian is perpetual. I have spoken very seriously to Mum-ut- Tuiiar and have told him that His Majesty’s Government consider that the Persian Government were justified in terminating his firman, notice of which was com municated officially to the British Legation. He is now endeavouring to negotiate new concession which will include the islands as well as Hormuz. This I can by exerting pressure endeavour to block, and have told Muin-ut-Tujjar I would do so unless he is prepared to give me a written undertaking that he will m future take into con sideration the desires and interests of His Majesty’s Government m the Gulf and take their advice. This he said he was prepared to do. If I am able to come to a satisfactory arrangement with Muin-ut-Tujjar I see no reason why he should not be allowed to proceed with his negotiations. If opposed he may prove a tiresome enemy, against whom we shall stumble continually, as he has great influence.
