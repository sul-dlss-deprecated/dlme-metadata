The 18th century was a very disturbed period of Persian General, history. The Safavi dynasty, which had lasted for more than 200 years and reached its zenith in the reign of Shah Abbas from 1587 to 1629, was overthrown by the Afghans in 1/22 and in 1736 superseded by Nadir, a brilliant soldier of fortune of the Afshar tribe, who extended his empire from the Caucasus to India. After his assassination in 1747 a period of anarchy and civil war ensued until Karim Khan Zand triumphed over2 / his rivjiis and fought his way to the throne. His death in 17/9 was followed by another period of fierce and bloody strife during winch Igha Muhammad Khan, chief of the Kaj5r tribe o Astarabad, which had been prominent throughout these civil J?5f’ established his position until he was crowned baah ot Persia at Tehran in 1796. This establishment of the Kajar dynasty marks the ment of a new epoch in persian history. Its salient point are :— commence- L The ® hi _ ftin S of t^e capital of Persia from Isfahan or bmraz to Tehran, which increased the importance ot this North Western area. 2. The loss of the Caucasian provinces of Persia and her envelopment by Russia along the whole length of her Northern frontier, the Russianization ot the Caspian, and gradual Russian penetration mto these Northern provinces and consequent conflict of Russian with British influence, which resulted in the baneful rivalry of these 2 powers antl tlle distraction of Persia between them. 1116 gradual transition through the 19th century 'from a medieval Oriental monarchy, surrounded by other Oriental states, and depending on the power oi the sword and survival of the fittest, to a weak monarchy with peaceful hereditary succession main tained by powerful European ‘ neighbours, and finally m the 20th century shorn of its powers by a Constitutional movement inspired by European influence. Attendant on the diminution of the force and vigour of the ruler has been the decay and disintegration of the Persian State. These points are described in paragraphs 1 to 3 viz. :■ 1. The growth of Russian influence in Northern Persia 2 . The decline of British influence in Northern Persia, and the Anglo-Russian rivalry in Tehran. 3. The Constitutional movement.

IVlazandaran and Astarabad to the Tsar in return for his assistance against the Afghans. The Russians, however, did not enter IVlazandaran or Astaiabad and in 1734 they evacuated Gilan. No further conflict occurred with Russia until the end of the 18th century when Russian armies invaded Georgia, then a dependency of Persia, and Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar was murdered while marching to meet them in 1797. Fighting 1 co ntinued during the early years of the reign of Fath AH Shah, who succeeded him, and was ended by the peace of Gulistan in 1813 by which Persia ceded Georgia, Darbend, Baku, Shirwan, Shaki, Ganja (Elisavetopol), Karabagh, Mughan, Lenkoran, and ail naval rights on the Caspian, and in return Russia under took to secure the succession of Abbas Mirza, the. heii- apparent. This last clause is significant as the first sign of Russian interference in the internal concerns of Persia. The exasperation of the Persians against the over-bearing attitude *of the Russians, against their interpretation of doubtful clauses in the treaty of Gulistan and their ill-treatment of the Muhammadan population of the provinces ceded to them, forced the Shah into a 2nd war with Russia in 1826. After some initial successes it proved disastrous to him and after the capture of Erivan and Tabriz by the Russians it was terminated in 1828 by the treaty of Turkomanchai which superseded the treaty of Gulistan. The Khanates/ o Erivan and Nakhichivan were ceded to Russia and the new Russo-Persian frontier was defined. The Shah was also to pay an indemnity of 5,000,000 2 tumans. The conditions o • e peace of Gulistan allowing no ships of war on the Caspian except those flying the Russian flag, and safeguarding e succession of the Heir-Apparent to the throne of Persia were re-iterated. In addition the treaty of Turkomanchai contained an important commercial compact. 1 In 1804 the Russians made a descent in Gilan. They landed at Enzali.but when attempting to advance through the jungle to Rasht, were ambushed by the Gilakis, retreated to Enzali and gave up the enterprise. a The equivalent at that time to rather more than £3,000,000.4 1 R. G. Watson’s “/History of Persia, ” page 242. J838-81, 1 '* It was fixed that Russian traders should enjoy in Persia all the privileges accorded to the subjects of the most favoured nation. Goods passing from one country to the other were to be subjected to one sole duty of 5 per cent, levied at the frontier. Russian subjects were to have the right to acquire en tovte propriete habitable houses and magazines into which the em- ployes of the Persian Government should not have the right of penetrating by force, except by the sanction of the Russian Minister or Consul. The representatives of Russia, with the gentlemen attached to them, and the consuls of the same nation, were to have the privilege of being allowed to import free from duty all kinds of articles which should be intended solely for their own use, and Persian officials were to enjoy Russian protection in the same manner as Russian subjects. The settlement of all disputes between Russian subjects in Persia was to be entirely confided to the Minister or Consul of his Imperial Majesty; the treatment of them to be according to the laws of Russia. Disputes between subjects of the two Governments were to be settled by the two courts of religious law and equity, but a Russian employe was to be present during the hearing of each case.” This treaty of Turkomanchal is very important as accord' ing special rights to Russian subjects in Persia and so to some extent infringing on the Independent Sovereignty of the Shah, and as the basis of all subsequent treaties made with Persia by other European powers who have been content to stipulate that its provisions should apply to their nationals. The lesson of 1828 was not forgotten. Persia was chastened, and the rapid growth of Russia rendered her too formidable for the Persians to venture on further opposition. From 1838 to 1881 Russia turned her attention to Central Asia, and to the eastern coast of the Caspian, where she subdued the Turkomans who had nominally been under Persian suzerainty. Russian control of the Southern Casnian had •been facilitated by the occupation in 1840 of the'island of Ashuradeh, at the entrance to the Gulf of Astarabad, as a naval base against the Turkoman pirates, and her advance m the regions East of the Caspian had made Russia con terminous with Persia along the whole length of the Persian Northern frontier. During the period she sought to increase her influence at lehran, at the expense of Great Britain.

The year 1879-80 marks the initiation of a forward policy 1879-1907. inside the frontiers of Persia with the formation of the Persian Cossack force in Tehran under Russian officers, while after 1890 Russia commenced the development of communications and trade in North Western Persia by the .construction of the metalled roads vid Kazvin to Tehran and Hamadan, and of the port of Enzall, and started penetration into Persian Azarbaijan. Following on the development of trade Russian consuls and agents were established in all towns of any size. This encroachment was facilitated by the accession of the weak and incompetent Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah in 1896 and the consequent spread of administrative paralysis. The Shah’s extravagance was facilitated by the readiness with which Russia advanced loans for him to squander on journeys to Europe and so acquired financial control over the Persian Government, which no longer possessed sufficient revenue io meet its cunent expenditure. The Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907 defined Northern ^nglo-Busiian^ Persia as the Russian zone of influence and while Russia bene- 1907 fited by the withdrawal of British competition from these regions she acted in contravention of the spirit of this conven tion by interfering to an increasing extent in the internal concerns of the country. The effect of this convention on the Briti h position in Persia is described in para. 2, pages 11 -13. During the Persian revolution of 1909 on the pretext of Kiissiangarrt. protecting Russian subjects and property she introduced Russian Persia, garrisons into 2 Tabriz, at first of 2,000 men, but this number was afterwards increased, and via 2 Enzali and 2 Rasht to Kazvin of one battalion infantry, 500 Cossacks, 4 guns and some sappers. These garrisons were reduced after November 1909, but not withdrawn, and in 1911 were reinforced to support the Russian ^ultimatum to Persia to dismiss Mr. Shuster, the American engaged by the Persian Government as treasurer timatnm of General to organize the finances, whose independent attitude MU- in the Russian zone had evoked Russian hostility, to engage no foreigner in Persia without the consent of Russia and Great 1 See paragraph 2, page 9 below. » In Enzall, Rasht and Tabriz melees ensued after the arrival oi the Russians, in which several Persians were killed and wounded. For an account of these events see pages 28-31.6 Britain, and to pay an indemnity to defray the expense of despatch of Russian troops to Persia. These terms were rejected by the Majlis, and to stave off the consequences of further resistance to Russia, which could only prove disastrous, the Regent, Nasr-ul-Mulk, dissolved the Majlis on 24th December 1911. By January 1912 Russia had increased her garrisons in North Persia to a total of 17,000, including 200 at Rnzali, 4,000 at Rasht and Kazvin, 100 at Hamadan, 2,000 at Ardabil and 6,000 at Tabriz, and about 500 in Mazandaran at Mashad-i-Sar and Barfarush. _ The presence of Russian troops in Persian territory was seized on by their opponents in 1914-15 as a violation of Persian neutrality and a justification for the entry of the Turks into Persia. Russian influence in Persia was reactionary in the extreme. The Russians were opposed to any schemes for material or industrial amelioration and reform and desired to hasten Persian decadence in order that they might turp the disorganized state of the country to their own ends, and justify and augment their interference in its internal concerns. The province of Persian Azarbaijan, which is remote from the Tehran Govern ment and contiguous with Russian territory, affords the best instance of these methods of penetration. From 1906 to 1909 Tabiiz had been a most active centre of the 4 Constitutional ’ movement. After the Russian occupation of the city in 1909 this progressive spirit was crushed and by 1913 'it had become the home of reactionaries. On the principle of ‘ divide et impera ’ the Russians took advantage of tribal dissensions and were cautiously working for the subjugation of the whole province and absorbing the civil and military administration. Russian customs were spread ing and the population was resigned to acquiescence in Russian domination. Prior to the Persian revolution of 1906 the Russian 8 encouraged the extravagance of the Shah and refused to co operate with the British with a view to averting a financial crash. While seeking in these ways to embarrass the tottering monarchy they would not countenance its fall, and seem to have desired to reduce the Kajars to a state of dependence on Russia and then maintain them as a puppet dynasty. Their policy 1 regarding the Persian Cossack Division, their introduction of garrisons in 1909, their connivance and benevolent neutrality 1 See Chapter VI, pages 238 and 243.towards the rebellion of Muhammad All, the ex-Shah, and their demand for the dismissal of Mr. Shuster in 1911, are striking 1 instances of this Russian attitude which contributed to the stifling of the embryo Constitutional 2 3 Government, and further submerged the country in bankruptcy and chaos. The high-handed behaviour of Russian consuls, their humiliation of and interference with Persian officials, and more especially the license enjoyed and abused by their Persian agents and Persians under Russian protection, many of whom were notorious scoundrels, were a source of constant irritation to Persians in the provinces. By playing the part of a big bully Russia earned the intense dislike of the Persians, but when they enlarge on these political grievances it should not be forgotten that the great expansion of the export trade to Russia was due to Russian enterprise and development of communications, and that the stimulus to increased production given by the demand for Persian products, such as rice, cotton and dried fruits in Russian markets, was a solid source of material prosperity to Northern Persia. i 1 Gf. also Russian reluctance to take action in Persia in 1915 against Turko- Gennan intrigue. The Russians would seem to have wished to let their enemies have their fling with the idea that they might afterwards retaliate by conquer ing the country. 3 Russian hostility to the Constitution was inspired by their prejudice against a liberal movement, and also because they regarded the Persian revolution as a British machination to overthrow the Russian position in Persia. Russian treatment of Persia during the period is described below in para. 3.8 British relations With Persia prior to 1890. Persian aggres* ■ion against Her&amp;t. PARA. 2.—The decline oi British Influence in Northern Persia and the Anglo-Russian Rivalry in Tehran. At the commencement of the 1 19th century Persia became a factor in world politics owing to her geographical position, which was thought to afford a possible route to India. Path Ali Shah’s alliance was courted by Napoleon and General Gardanne with 70 French officers came to organize a military force for the Shah. England was alarmed at this spread of French influence and in 1809 Sir H. Jones negotiated a preli minary 2 treaty with the Shah, securing the dismissal of this French mission and promising him an annual subsidy of 200,000 tumans or the loan of British troops whilst England should be at war with Russia. In 1810 Sir J. Malcolm and British officers arrived in Tehran from India. After the termination of the Russo-Persian war by the peace of Gulistan in 1813 Abbas MIrza, the Heir-Apparent, lost interest in military reform, while the defeat of Napoleon made Great Britain indifferent to Persia. In 1815 a dispute arose about the continuance of the subsidy, the British non-Commis- sioned officers were withdrawn and only a few officers remained, among them being a Major Hart who possessed considerable influence in Persia until his death in 1830. In 1828 after the Russo-Persian treaty of Turkomanchai Great Britain took advantage of the Shah’s desperate need of money for payment of his indemnity to Russia to make thp definite abrogation of the clauses, whereby she guaranteed the assistance of troops or a subsidy in the event of a European power invading Persia, a condition of an immediate subsidy of 200,000 tumans. In 1834 a large and well equipped detachment of officers and non-Commissioned officers arrived at Tehran from India, and 6 months later they secured the peaceful accession of Muhammad Shah on the death of Fath Ali. Muhammad Shah, however, secure on his thronfe and threatened by no national danger, was prompted by Russia to 1 Before the 19th century no European power was regularly represented at the Shah’s Court. In the 17th century Russia and Poland had been occasion ally represented by ambassadors at the Court of the Safaris. In the early part of the reign of Peter the Great Russia was represented by two ambassadors, one for each of the two Russian Tsars. Louis XIV of France sent at least one mission composed of ecclesiastics. The head of the East India Company’s Factory at Isfahan was dignified by the title of English agent at the Shah’s Court. William Bell, who held this office, died at Isfahan in 1625. The head of the Dutch East India Company’s Factory similarly represented his nation. » Definitive treaties amplifying the terms were concluded in 1812 and 1814.B 9 Persia )ecame usition, Path leneral Mary ead of preli- f this ;00,000 should British e peace t, lost i made arose mmis- ainod, erable ,nchai ed of rethp id the cope® sidy of officers ! Imliei ssion of ■ont and Russia t° turn a deaf ear to British remonstrances and in 1837 laid siege to Herat, the population of which was largely Persian, and which was the ancient capital of the Persian province of Khorasan. The independence of Herat in order to prevent it from falling under Russian influence, was already a principle of British policy and a rupture resulted. Kharij island near Bushire was occupied by a small force from India, all British officers were recalled from Persia, and the Shah was induced to give up the seige of Herat. This incident marks the beginning of Anglo-Russian rivalry in Tehran and was a setback to British influence, which had been ascendant since the dismissal of the French mission from Persia in 1809. British policy had prevailed for the moment, but -Herat continued to he a source of contention. In 1853 it Was occupied by troops sent by Nasir-ud-Din Shah, who had succeeded Muhammad Shah in 1848, and again relinquished in compliance with the demand of Great Britain. In 1855 for the third time Persia resumed her aggression and Herat was captured after a seige of some months. On this occasion the Shah was more obdurate. The British Envoy was insulted and left issef 1 * * Tehran and on 1st November 1856 the Governor General of India declared war on Persia. The British occupation of Kharij island and the capture of Bushire, 1 induced the Shah to sue for peace and the war was concluded in March 1857 by the treaty of Paris. “ The con ditions of peace were—the Shah to withdraw his troops from Herat, relinquishing every claim to sovereignty over it, and to refrain from all interference in Afghanistan ; to recognize the indepeudenc of Herat; prisoners taken at Herat to he released without ransom. The British mission to he received at Tehran with apologies ; the slave trade to be suppressed in the Persian Gulf, and apologies to be made to Mr. Murray for the insolent conduct of the Shah and his Minister ”. Great Britain and Persia also promised to each other “ most favoured nation ” treatment 2 in the appointment of Consular officers and in the treatment of their subjects and trade. As soon as Persia had fulfilled her obl gations, the occupied Persian territory was evacuated by British troops. Great Britain’s conduct of this war thus forced upon her, in which she studiously avoided dealing any serious blow to Persia, and the generosity of the peace terms, are a striking 1 Muhammarab and Ahwaz were also captured before news of the treaty of Paris had reached the British commander. * i. e., the terms of the treaty of Turkomanchai, see para. 1 above page 3; were made applicable to England.10 Qonflict of British oersHg Russian ia- , finance after 1890. contrast to the treaties of Gulistan and Turkomanchai imposed by Russia on Persia in 1813 and 1828 respectively, when Russia annexed large shoes of Persian territory, and are proof of the British policy to promote the independence and integrity of Persia. These three successive campaigns against Herat in 1837, 1853 and 1856 were the outward and visible results of Russian intrigue and influence at the Shah’s Court. As yet, however, Russia was still occupied with expanding and consolidating her influence up to the frontier of Persia, and 1890 marks the beginning of the active Russian commercial and political penetratfon within Northern Persia, extending further into the country and entering into acute and provocative rivalry 1 with Great Britain. The accession of the weak Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah in 1896 and the resulting weakening of the Government and disintegration of the country facilitated the progress of this Russian policy, and by 1905 Russian influence had become predominant in Tehran and throughout Northern Persia, and every effort was being made to extend it southwards to the Persian 2 Gulf and to SIstan. 3 The first serious shock to the moral prestige of Great Britain had been the tobacco 4 regie episode of 1890, which aroused 1 Allusions to this rivalry are also made in Chapter VII, para, (a) ‘ trade generally, pages 257-260, and para. 4 below. The Belgians in the Customs administration, who realized their dependence on the goodwill of Russia, were • also in many cases regarded as Russian agents to hinder British trade: a e u. In 1902 Russia proposed to construct an oil pipe line from Baku to the Persian Gulf. In 1905 she declared that lighthouses and buoys were neces sary in the Persian Gulf and offered to survey the coast and undertake the work, although Russian shipping and trade in those regions were practically nil. In the same year she established consuls at Lingah and Bandar Abbas and a Russian trade mission visited Southern Persia. . A long dispute also was waged about the phrase all the Customs of Persia except those of Fdrs and the Persian Gulf ” which were assigned as security for the Russian loans. Great Britain interpreted the exception in a broad sense as equivalent to the “ Customs of Southern Persia In case of default the Customs, houses might be seized and placed under Russian yontrol, so the_ question was of considerable importance, and it became the subject of much discussion with the Persian Government, who eventually accepted the British interpretation as a condition of the 1904 loan of £100,000 by the Imperial Bank. See also p. 16, note *. 3 In Sistan owing to its proximity to India she displayed particular interest. She viewed with disfavour the opening of the Quetta-Nushki-Sistan trade route, and by the operations of a cholera cordon, which she instituted, she succeeded ir practically nullifying its value. Control of a Meshed-Sistan telegraph line was one of her coveted schemes. As a condition of the 1902 loan to Persia she had first demanded that a Russian line should be constructed as a counterconcession to the Telegraph convention of 1901 for the construction by the British Govern ment of the Central Persia line (see page 457). This demand was modified and the line was to be constructed by the Persian Government, but a verbal promise was obtained that Russian signallers should be employed. In 1905 these signal lers were introduced and in 1906 Russia seized the Sistan end of the line.

Her material prestige had consistently declined since 1890 owing to her remoteness from Tehran and Northern Persia and her inability successfully to compete in these regions with Russia, who in addition to enjoying all the geographical advantages was employing such aggressive methods that opposition to them involved danger of armed conflict. The financial hold established by Russia over the Persian G-overnment in 1900 by her loan of £2,250,000 to the Shah followed by a Customs convention secretly concluded with Russia and published in 1903, 1 which imposed a new tariff scale favourable to her and prejudicial to Great Britain, dealt it a virtual cowp de grace. The situation was viewed by Great Britain with apprehen sion. *The Persians had proved only too ready to play off the two powers against each other, to barter away concessions 2 to each in turn and adopt a suicidal spendthrift policy of taking loans, mostly from Russia, to which political 2 conditions of in creasing stringency were attached, designed to increase Russian hold over the Persian Government and to be prejudicial to Great Britain, until the existence of Persia as an independent State was endangered. In 1906, however, a sudden turn of Eventg of 1900 fortune greatly increased British and diminished Russian influ ence in Tehran. Russia’s greatest successes in Persia had been achieved while Great Britain had been handicapped by the South African war, but it was now the turn of Russian prestige to be shaken by the Russo-Japanese war and by the internal condition of Russia bordering on revolution. Great Britain on the other hand had fostered, almost guided the “ Constitutional movement ” of 1906 in Persia, the success of which made the English as popular as the Russians were detested. Russia accordingly became more conciliatory and in 1907 a Convention was concluded between the two powers with 4 n „ lo _;R Usg i an a view to checking - their menacing antagonism in Asia. Convention of Afghanistan, Persia and Tibet were included in its scope. In 1907, Persia, without reference, however, to the Persian Government, Russian, British and Neutral spheres of influence were defined. The Russian zone was bounded by a line drawn from Qasr- i-Shirin through Yazd and Khakh to a point on the Persian frontier, adjoining the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers. The British zone was bounded by a line from 1 For this Customs’ convention see page 260. An untoward incident which occurred at Bushire, when Lord Curzon as Viceroy of India was making a tour in *the Persian Gulf in 1903, is generally attributed to Russian intrigue. * See para. 3 below, pages 15-17.Bandar-i-Abbas through Kirman, Birjand and Gazik to the Afghan frontier near Gazik. The boundary towns mentioned were included in the Russian and British zones respectively and the Neutral zone lay between them. Russia and Great Britain each undertook not to seek con cessions, or to support their nationals seeking concessions within the zone of the other power and to consult each other concerning concessions in the intermediate “ neutral ” zone. In order to allay the suspicion and apprehension aroused in Persia, that this Convention amounted to a partition of the country, in September 19 )7 the British Minister in Tehran con veyed an assurance to the Persian Government concerning British and Russian intentions, including a clause :—“ Not only do they not wish to have at hand any excuse for intervention, but their object in these friendly negotiations was not to .allow one another to interfere on the pretext of safe-guarding their interests.” The Convention from the British point of view contained more ‘give’ 1 than ‘take’. Russian sincerity was doubtful, and a considerable party 2 at any rate in Russia was aiming at the “ absorption of the whole of Persia without participation under her exclusive control.” This was the policy engrained in the consuls and other Russian employes in the country. Frequent ly they disobeyed the Russian Legation in actions which were inconsistent with the Convention. The Russian official policy however, underwent a modification and a truce was imposed on the diplomatic struggle. The Convention was partially successful in curtailing Russian activities in Central and Southern Persia, and checking Anglo-Russian rivalry, but Russia conti nued to exert pressure on the 'Tehran Government, and to 3 interfere to an increasing extent in Northern Persia. The most flagrant violations of the spirit of the Convention were the Shuster Bpisode Russian ultimatums of 1911 and the dismissal of Mr. Shuster, damaging an American engaged by the Persian Government as financial influence* 1 adviser who had gained the support of the Majlis and was striv ing to evolve order out of chaos in the financial administra tion, a deplorable highhanded action which stamped out the only really promising move 4 towards reform initiated since 1 e.

She had stated that the object of the Convention was that Russia and Great Britain were not “to allow one another to interfere” in the internal concerns of Persia, and she had thus to some extent become sponsor for Russia’s non-interference. She made repeated diplomatic pro tests to Russia, but for which that power might have actually annexed Northern Persia, but in conjunction with France she required Russian friendship in Europe and was not prepared to ’go to the length of alienating it for the sake of Persia. The Persians on the other hand were not concerned with the world policy side of the question and when they appealed in vain to Great Britain against the Russian ultimatums they were embit tered against her as a friend who had left them in the lurch, who was at best too pusillanimous to stand up for them, or at worst the guilty conniver at Russian tyranny. The Convention had come as an unpleasant surprise, but the _ events of 1911 irreparably damaged the prestige and popularity which Great Britain had won from her support to the consti tutional movement and they are still a potent source of Persian mistrust.PARA. 3.—The Constitutional Movement. Eventejleading The envelopment of Persia between Russia and Great Britain tS&amp;md move- tU ' opined in the two preceding paragraphs is the most salient meat., feature of Persian history during the 19 th century. The internal history of the country during the reign of Path • Ali Shah from 1799 to 1834, once he had disposed of numerous pretenders to the throne and established his position, was peace ful and uneventful compared with the upheavals of the 18th century. His successor Muhammad Shah, who reigned from 1834 to 1848, allowed the government to pass into the hands of his Grand Vizir Haj~ Mirza Aghasi. The state of Persia under this Minister is described by Sir H. Rawlinson. “ He was utterly ignorant of statesmanship or of military science, yet too vain to receive instruction and too jealous to admit of a coadjutor; brutal in his language, insolent in his demeanour, ■ indolent in his habits, he brought the country to the brink of revolution. The pay of the army was generally from 3 to 5 years in arrears. The cavalry of the tribes was almost an nihilated.” The long reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah followed from 1848 to 1896. His personality secured the smooth working of the old despotic system of administration, 1 security and tranquillity were maintained throughout Persia and, judged by the standard and traditions 1 of Government prevalent in the country, Nasir-ud-Din was a strong ruler and the most able of the Kajar dynasty. Persia was brought more into contact with the outside world by the construction of telegraph lines, of a line from Baghdad via Kirmanshah, Hamadan and Tehran to Bushire by the British Government in 1864, and of a through line from London via Julfa and Tabriz to Tehran by Messrs. Siemens of Berlin in 1870 and by the institution of a postal service in 1877. The Shah’s power became to some extent limited by his sensitiveness to European opinion, but European ideas 2 or education 2 spread very little among his subjects and the internal condition of the country underwent small change. 1 For a description of this system see Chapter V, Administration, r pages 193-5. . * A Persian newspaper entitled the ‘ Qanun,’ (‘ order ’) which was published in London, began to advocate a fixed code of laws and National Assembly for Persia, and exercised considerable influence. Its editors were Malkom Khan and Saiyid Jamal-ud-DIn. The former was the son of an Armenian convert to Islam and gained notoriety at Tehran as a conjurer until he was ordered to leave Persia. On his return he founded a Masonic- Certain innovations, however, which originated during the latter half of his reign and were carried further by his suc cessor, started the popular discontent, which developed into the ‘constitutional’ movement. These innovations were:— 1 The Shah's journeys 1 to Europe in 1873, 1878 and 1889, which [were a novel drain on the financial resources of the kingdom. 2. The granting of concessions to foreigners.—In 1872 the Shah promised a concession to Baron de Reuter for a 70 years’ monopoly for railways, tramways, roads, telegraphs and all public works, mines except for precious metals, the farming of the 'Customs for 25 years and the foundation of a national bank. Owing, however, to the opposition aroused to a concession of such magnitude, among the Persians, owing to the power it conferred on foreigners, and among Russians from jea lousy, it was rescinded and the scramble for concessions was postponed until 1888. The most noteworthy were a concession in 1888 to Messrs- Lynch for opening the Karun to navigation, a lottery 2 concession in 1889, a concession in 1889 to Baron de Reuter for foundation of the Imperial Bank of Persia and for mineral rights m Persia, a concession to Russia in 1889 for a road from Gilan to Tehran and an undertaking to give her the refusal of any railway construction in Persia for 10 years, a concession in 1890 ioi a “Tobacco regie” with “full control over the production, sale and export of all tobacco in Persia ”. This “ Tobacco regie aroused intense opposition in which the clergy partic ipated, an lodge, which caused his second expulsion but £1872 he heca^ in London.

The concession was quashed owing to the opposition of the Muhammadan clergy to it as a tom of gambling and so contrary to the Quran. Its cancellation caused acrimony 1 between tfuf Grand Vizir Amin-us-Sultan and Malkom Khan, and led to the latter’s hostility of the Shah.16 Eeign of Muzaffar-ud- Shah. interdict by Haji Mirza Hasan ShirazI, a Mujtahid residing at . Samarra in Mesopotamia, against smoking was obeyed through out Persia and all smoking ceased, until the Shah was com pelled to cancel the obnoxious concession. These events were very damaging to British prestige in Persia. 3. The Foundation of a National Debt in 1892 by a loan of £500,000 from the Imperial Bank of Persia, at 6 per cent, interest on the security of the Persian Gulf Customs, to pay to the Im perial Tobacco Corporation of Persia as compensation for the cancellation of their monopoly. The Tobacco Regie episode eventually caused the death of Nasir-ud-DIn as he was assassi nated in 1896 in revenge by a man who had suffered im prisonment in connection with the disturbances. itj j B He was succeeded by his son Muzaffar-ud-Din, a well meaning invalid, lacking in initiative and vigour, and the first of the Kajar sovereigns who was conspicuously unfitted to direct the autocratic government. Like his grandfather, Muhammad Shah, he permitted the administration to pass into the hands of his Grand Vizir the Amln-us-Sultan, 1 AH Asghar Khan, who had been the servant of Nasir-ud-Din, but became very much his own master under Muzaffar-ud-Din and he was surrounded by a cortege of greedy Turld courtiers who accom panied him from Tabriz on his accession to the throne, and indulged their extravagant tastes at the expense of the State. The extravagance of the Court produced an annual deficit and the baneful innovations, which had made their appearance during his father’s reign, were rapidly accentuated and threat ened Persia with bankruptcy, ignominy, and loss of her independence, while the Shah’s weakness permitted the ex pression of universal discontent. The National Debt was inflated by a loan of £2,250,000 borrowed from Russia in 1900 at 5 per cent, interest repayable in 75 years and guaranteed by all the Customs of Persia except those of “ Pars 2 and the Persian Gulf.” It was stipulated that out of it the 1892 loan of £500,000 must be repaid to the Imperial Bank, and that Persia must contract no loan from any other foreign power for 10 years. 1 He was out of favour in 1896 and retired to Qum when his rival Amln-ud- I)auleh became Grand Vizir. He failed however, to raise funds and Amin-us- Sultan returned to power in 1898 and remained in office until 1903, when he was dismissed and superseded by Ain-ud-Dauleh (see below). He was assassinated on his return from Europe to Persia in 1907. His rival Amin-ud-Dauleh was more honest and patriotic, but a weaker and less astute politician, and after 1898 did not again hold office. 2 This phrase subsequently became the subject of much discussion between the British Legation and the Persian Government, the former maintaining that it must be interpreted to mean all the Customs of Southern Persia. The British interpretation was eventually conceded as the condition of a loan for £100,000 from the Imperial Bank in 1904.Russia, consequently, became the sole creditor of the Persian state and riveted her control over the Government. The under taking of Nasir-ud-DIn Shah in 1889 prohibiting the construc tion for 10 years of railways in Persia without Russian consent was also prolonged for a further 1 period. So far from being devoted to any reproductive purposes the greater part of the loan was squandered in the Shah’s journey to Europe a few months later. In 1902 he borrowed £200,000 from the Imperial 2 Bank of Persia, and a second loan from Russia of 10,000,000 roubles, just over £1,000,000, granting in return a concession for a road from Julfa to Tabriz and Tehran and for some coal and petroleum mining rights. Modifications also Avere to be introduced in the Persian Customs tariff in con junction with Russia. This second loan enabled the Shah to make a second journey to Europe. In 1903 the Treasury was again empty. The conditions 3 on which Russia was prepared to advance loans were un acceptable, and eventually £200,000 were borrowed from the Imperial Bank on the security of the Posts and Telegraphs and of the Customs of Ears and the Persian Gulf. A further £500,000 were offered, and it was suggested that the Shah might be paid a subsidy provided he Avould grant no road, railway or other political or commercial concession in Sistan or South Persia to foreigners, other than British. As the Shah’s financial embarrassments increased he thus took advantage of the rivalry between Great Britain and Russia, which had become extremely acute, to barter 4 away concessions to each power in turn. Popular agitation and disorders in the provinces caused the fall of the Grand Vizir Amin-us-Sultan, 5 who found himself in the uncomfortable position of being execrated by the 1 The agreement was secret and the number of years was not ascertained by the British Legation. STo written record existed in Persia, as the only note on the subject, which had been minuted by the Shah, was in the possession of the Russian Government. 2 Owing to the Bank’s position as State Bank of Persia this loan was not regarded as an infringement of the Shah’s obligation to contract no foreign loan without the consent of the Russian Government. 3 Russia offered a loan of £1,000,000 on condition that she should be given a concession for Construction of a railway from Trans-caspia across Persia to the Indian Ocein near the British frontier. Subsequently she was prepared to offer £100,000 in return for control of the Persian mint, which Avould have enabled her to crush the Imperial Bank. These conditions of course were, directed against England. * At the beginning of 1906 in secret negotiations with the Shah, which did not however mature, Russia demanded as a condition of a loan that the conduct of Persian foreign relations should be placed under Russian guidance and no con cessions or treaties should be made without Russian consent. ‘ In 1902 he was given the higher title of Atabak-i-a’zam for his presence of mind when an attempt was made to assassinate the Shah in Paris.18 people, and ex-communicated by tbe religious leaders in Najaf for borrowing 1 money to provide for the Shah’s extravagances, and being blamed by the Shah for not providing sufficients He was succeeded by ’Ain-ud-Dauleh who adopted the specious- programme of financial reform in lieu of foreign loans. In 1904, however, he borrowed a further loan of £100,000 from the Imperial 2 Bank, and in 1905 the Shah made his third journey to Europe and an advance of £100,000 was obtained from Russia. The only measure of financial reform instituted during Muzaffar-ud-Din’s reign was in connection with the Customs. In his desire for money in 1898 he had made the experiment of placing the Customs houses of Kirmanshah and Tabriz under Belgian officials. Encouraged by the results, and to afford a security for foreign loans, in 1902 he obtained the services of Belgian officials for.the administration of all the Customs of Persia. M. Naus, who was appointed Director, acquired great influence, secretly negotiated a Customs treaty with Russia, which came into force in 1903 and w r as designed to promote Russian and be detrimental to British trade, and in 1905, he was also appointed Minister of Posts and Tele graphs. The administration of ’Ain-ud-Dauleh proved even worse than that of his predecessor and the state of affairs is described in a report by Sir W. Townley, the British Minister in Tehran, as follows :— “ The condition of Persia had been for some time growing more and more intolerable. The Shah was entirely in the hands of a corrupt ring of courtiers who were living on the spoils of the Government and country. He had parted with the treasures inherited from his father, and with most of the Imperial and national domain. He had thus been obliged to have recourse to foreign loans the proceeds of which he had. spent in foreign travel or had lavished on his courtiers. There was a yearly deficit, and the debt of the country was growing, daily. Anew 3 * Grand Vizir had been appointed, whose moving principle was believ ed to be independence of foreign control. His first act was-to attempt some sort of financial reform, the object of which was to render the country independent of foreign financial assistance. But as soon as he had obtained control of the Government, it was apparent that his main and principal object was to make money. He made an alliance with the Shah’s chief adviser for a division of the spoil. Governments were put up for sale, grain w 7 as hoarded and sold at extor tionate prices, the Government domains were stolen or sold for the benefit of the two conspirators, rich men were summoned to Tehran and forced to dis gorge large sums of money, oppression of every sort was countenanced for a consideration; the property and even the lives of all Persian subjects were at their mercy. Finally, there was every reason to believe that a conspiracy was on foot to dethrone the foolish and impotent Shah and to oust, the VaJiahd. 1 The unpopularity of the loans caused the destruction of the Russian bank in Tehran by a mob in 1905. 2 The Russians offered £400,000 on condition that they should be entrusted with the reorganization of the Persian army. * ’Ain-ud-Dauleh.In their place was to he put the Shua’-us-Sultaneh,. the Shah’s younger son, who was a by word even in Persia for extortion and injustice. The policy of the Atabak and his friends had thus aroused the opposition St all classes in Persia ; of the few more or less patriotic statesmen, who knew to what a goal the country was being led ; of the priests, who felt that their old power and independence would perish with that of their country ; and of the great mass of the population and the mercantile classes, who were the daily victims of the tyranny of their oppressors.” Events, which led to the granting of a Constitution, com menced in December 1905, when some malcontents 1 took ‘ bast ’ at Shah Abdul Azim. They refused to be bribed or inti midated to leave the shrine until in January 1906 the Shah wrote a promise to concede their demand for the dismissal of ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, who, as Grand Vizir, incurred the brunt of the popular discontent, and promised reforms in the administration of Justice, and changes in the new Customs administration, which was the object of anti-foreign agitation directed especially against M. Naus. Grandees, including Muhammad All, the Heir Apparent at Tabriz, who were enemies of the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, supported the movement and no mention was made of a Constitution. The ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, however, endeavoured to bribe the clergy to withdraw their support from the popular leaders, and the Shah failed to give effect to his promises, until in July popular agitation led to some disturbances, resulting in a second taking of ‘ bast ’ in a masjid in Tehran. Soldiers were picketed to prevent supplies reaching the ‘ bastis ’, until in the middle of July, the Mujtahids, who were their leaders, were permitted to withdraw to Qum. A few days later on July 19th a party of some 50 priests TaWngof ‘bast’ and merchants took ‘ bast ’ in the British 2 Legation in Tehran ; tion in 1906 and by the beginning of August the number of ‘ bastis ’ had ^‘^l^ftion increased to nearly 14,000. This concourse had spontaneously c assembled without any organization or programme, as a protest against the Government with whom they refused to parley except through the medium of the British Legation. The Court yielded, the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh resigned and left Tehran, and on 6th August a rescript from the Shah was read out to the crowd in the Legation promising a Representative National Assembly, Courts of Justice, reforms, and an amnesty. On the 9th of August the Mujtahids agreed to return from Qum and on the 10th the Legation Grounds were vacated. The reactionaries however, attempted to nullify these concessions, the ’Ain-ud- Dauleh suddenly returned to Tehran and the Shah was dis- 1 Their chief leaders were all Mujtahids, viz., Saiyid Abdullah, Saiyid Muham mad and Shaikh Fazlullah. 2 In reply to an inquiry made by their representatives to the Minister, who was at the summer residence of Qualahak, they had received his reply that force would not be used to expel them.20 suaded from signing the regulations for the assembly. The people declared their intention of again taking ‘ bast , but the Shah accepted the advice of the British and Russian Legation^, and gave way. The popular leaders at Tabriz, Meshed and Rasht likewise threatened to take ‘ bast ’ in the British Con sulates as a protest against reactionary Governors, who refused to publish the regulations and hold elections, but in the end the provincial elections passed off quietly. Meanwhile after the election of the 64 members for Tehran the Assembly was opened by the Shah on 7th October 1906. A joint Committee appointed by Assembly and Gov ernment drew up a 1 Constitution which was read to the Assembly and signed by the Shah and Muhammad Ali the Heir Apparent. Throughout this period Muzaffar-ud-DIn Shah had been ill, and died in January 1907 soon after the signing of the Consti tution. His death completes the first or 1906 phase of the Persian revolution. It had begun in popular demonstrations directed against an oppressive Grand Vizir, against the extra vagance of the Court, the deplorable state of administration and country, the foreign loans and concessions which were leading to national bankruptcy and subjugation to European 2 control, and had fortuitously ended in a Constitution and National Assembly. This change had been effected .practically without bloodshed, chiefly by a peaceful taking of t bast ’ in the grounds of the British Legation, through whom the negotiations with the Government had been conducted, and which was cons equently regarded as the champion of liberty and justice in Persia. Accession of The second phase of the ‘ Constitutional ’ movement SMh commenced with the coronation of Muhammad Ali Shah on 19th January 1907. When Heir Apparent in Tabriz he had been well disposed to the original agitation against the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, 1 For the Persian Constitution see Chapter V Administration. ' 2 It was this aspect of the situation which turned the reactionary Slu’ah clergy into protagonists of the reform movement. Under the autocracy they had been powerful as the sole authority to which appeal could be made against the absolutist provincial governors, but they now feared that the growth of European control would be fatal to their position. This clerical support is a unique feature of the Persian revolution. Subsequently their relations with the popular leaders became strained as they were uneasy at the threatened encroach ment on their own power and privileges, e,.g., the administration of justice,while the latter accused them of subordinating the interests of the State to religion and were inclined to tell them to go bach to their masjids and not intrude in politics. In 1910 Taqizadeh, the ultra democrat leader, was excommunicated and forced to leave Persia.but had refused to publish the Shah’s rescript promising a, National Assembly, until menaced by popular resentment he complied with their demands. After his arrival at Tehran be wrote to the Assembly accepting the Constitution and signed it with his father. His acquiescence however, was constrained and not voluntary. The year 1907 was not creditable either to ‘ Constitutional ists ’ or ‘Reactionaries’. The former were in an extremely difficult position ; the Assembly was sitting bat neither Assembly nor Ministers had any experience of Constitutional Government; the treasury was empty ; they were opposed to any foreign loans and to the Belgian 1 administration of the Customs, which were the most reliable source of revenue. The Shah meanwhile, while repeatedly swearing allegiance to the Constitution, was intriguing against it, and actually fostered disturbances in order to bring it into discredit, in the provinces local “Anjuman” or assemblies, which had been formed to cooperate with or control the provincial Governors, only succeeded in impairing their authority. 2 The Government lacked money and force and was thwarted by the Shah’s intrigues throughout the country. The revenue receipts dwindled, as people failed to realize that the establishment of Constitutional Government did not release them from their obligation of paying taxes. In Giian a ovarian troubles broke out and landlords were unaole to obtain their rents from the peasantry, and disorders occurred at all the large provincial centres. This disruption of the provincia administration, already enfeebled during the reign of Muzaffar- ud-Din Shah, leading to diminution in the revenues and disorders 3 and brigandage, has been one of the most marked and enduring results- of the Persian revolution. In November 1907 the Shah visited the Assembly and for the fourth time swore loyalty to the Constitution, which he was plotting to overthrow. In December he attempted a coup Stab d’etat and arrested N sr-ul-Mulk, the Premier, and his Mims- ters. The Shah was temporarily master of the situation, but 1 M. Naas was dismissed. a It found itself entrapped in a vicious circle, being unable to assert its authority without moneyf which it was too feeble to collect, a state of affaxrs which has continued until 1920. a See sketch of historv of Mazandaran in para. 5 below. Disorganiza tion hL been most marked in Azarbaijan and also in Southern Persia, where the tribes with anltural predilection for lawlessness, have got quite out of hand.22 Shah’s second coup d’fetat, June 1908, and abolition of eonstitution. Popular opposi' tion in the provinces. failed to consolidate his advantage, and the guilds and political clubs gained time to rally to the defence of the Assembly. The bazaars were closed, and the people flocked to the Baharis- tan, the Assembly’s meeting place. Expressions of indig nation received from the provinces against the Shah’s perfidy encouraged the Constitutionalists to discuss his deposition. The Shah found himself deserted and was frightened into submission. He promised to exile the leading 1 reactionaries and sent a sealed Quran to the Assembly with an oath to obey the Constitution. The Shah was temporarily worsted, but after his perfidy no reliance could be placed in his promises and in February an attempt was made to assassinate him. The disorganization of the Government and tension increased. The Assembly demanded the expulsion of reactionaries, and the Shah the cessation of attacks upon himself by newspapers and orators. On 4th June the Shah suddenly left the city and went to Bagh-i-Shah, where he collected Cossacks and irregulars, while the ‘ Constitutionalists ’ rallied round the Baharistan and the masjid of Sipah Salar adjacent to it. On the 23rd of June they were attacked by Colonel Liakhoff, the Russian officer in command of the Persian Cossack Division, and after a shrapnel bombardment both buildings were cleared. The casualties totalled about 600. The city was for a few days placed under martial law administered by Colonel Liakhoff, and the principal opponents of the Shah were arrested 2 and their houses looted. On the 27th June the Shah proclaimed a general amnesty and dissolution of the Assembly. The Shah’s triumph in Tehran was complete. Simul taneously, however, with this coup d’etat fighting broke out in Tabriz, which had become the principal centre of the popu lar cause, and the “Royalists” were expelled. The Shah despatched the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh and Sipahdar (Valx Khan, afterwards Sipah Salar) against Tabriz, where they arrived in August. They were opposed by Sattar Khan and other '‘Constitutionalists’ with the assistance of Messrs. Moore, an English newspaper Correspondent, and Baskerville, an American Missionary. Tabriz set an example of resistance to the Shah to the rest 3 of Persia, and its defence lasted until April 1909, 1 The most' conspicuous reactionary throughout this period was the late Amir Bahadur Jang. 2 . Taqizadeh and about 50 others took ‘ bast ’ afthe British Legation. 3 e.g., Anti-Royalist disturbances occurred at Meshed and Astarabad in De cember 1908.when the siege was raised by the entry of 2,000 Russian 1 troops to protect foreign life and property. The position in December 1908 consequently was that the jShah was supreme in Tehran, where he ended by declaring the abolition of the Constitution as contrary to Muhammadan law. He, however, equally with the ‘ Constitutionalists ’ failed to show any constructive ability; he took no action and he was destitute of money ; there was rebellion in the provinces and the situation was clearly transitory. Further developments in the provinces occurred early in 1909. In January 1909 ^^y| e r ^ f an(J Isfahan revolted and the Bakhtiaris took a leading part. In of CHian' cons* February the Sipahdar, who had quarrelled with his colleague titutionalfets on ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, and quitted the Royalist force besieging Tabriz, ie ircU1 ’ in disgust, went to Enzali and was accepted as their leader by the revolutionaries of Rasht, who attacked Government House, killed the Governor General, and took over the provincial Government of Gilan. This movement was stiffened by the presence of Caucasian revolutionaries, chief of whom was Yeprim, a remarkable man destined to play a great part in subsequent Persian events, which was rendered all the more conspicuous by comparison with the vacillation and inertia of his Persian contemporaries, both allies and opponents* By mid-March the Gilan revolutionaries had advanced an outpost as far as Yuzbashxchai, on the road between Manjil and Kazvin, and on 4th May Yeprim, with an advance party* 250 strong, surprised the Royalist Governor and garrison of Kazvin, and occupied the town. The Shah, who had continued to vacillate in Tehran, was at length frightened, and, acting on the joint advice of the British and Russian legations, he promised a restoration of the Constitution. His promises, however, failed to gain credence and his opponents continued their activities. Sipahdar remained at Kazvin, awaiting the cooperation of the Bakhtiaris, who started from Isfahan on 17th June under Sardar Asad, and on 23rd June their advance guard reached Qum. On the 4th of July Sardar Asad was at Robat 2 Karim and Sipahdar at Karaj, where they were visited by British 2 and Russian representatives, who urged 1 The number was afterwards increased to 4,000. The position of the city was becoming desperate and this episode, the first intrusion of Russian troops into Persian territory, appears to be the single instance when Russian inter ference, temporarily at any rate, benefited the popular party, who would have fallen victims to ’Ain-ud-Dauleh’s reprisals. In Tehran Russian sympathies were all with the Shah and Cossacks were placed around the British Legation to prevent the entry of •bastls’. The attitude of the Russians eventually contributed to the Shah’s downfall as it led him to expect active Russian support, which was not forthcoming. a Mr, Churchill found about 1,200 Bakhtiaris with Sardar Asad at Robat Karim.24 Deposition of Mahammad Ali Shah, 1909. Attitude of Russia towards the constitu tional move ment. them to desist, and guaranteed the Constitutional behaviour of the Shah in future. Their attempts at mediation were a failure, and Sipahdar and the Bakhtiaris united 16 miles West of Tehran. After 2 days’ indecisive fighting with Royalist troops on 10th and 11th July Sipahdar and Yeprim with 300 men slipped through a gap in the Royalist line between Shahabad and Yaftabad, and suddenly appeared in Tehran, where they rallied round the Baharistan. Three days’ street fighting, with a desultory bombardment of the city from the Qasr-i-Kajar, resulted, until on 16th July the Shah and his favourites left his summer palace of Sultanatabad and took c bast ’ at the Russian Legation in the village of Zargandeh. Colonel Liakhoff went to the Baharistan and placed- the services of the Cossack Division at the disposal of Sardar Asad and the Sipahdar. A council was held and voted the deposition of Muhammad Ali Shah and the succession of Sultan Ahmad his son, who was still a minor. After a period of negotiations 1 between the ex-Shah and the popular leaders, conducted throu-gh the Legations, he finally left Tehran on 9th September for Kieff. After the capture of the city Yeprim organized an able police administration and no disorders resulted. It is note worthy that although the origin of the revolution was to a considerable extent anti-foreign, in order to check the growth of foreign control in Persia, the lives and property of foreigners had been in no 2 way molested. On the pretext of their pro tection, however, Russia had introduced troops into Northern Persia. Their entry into Tabriz in April was riot inop portune, but in July a Russian force of one battalion infantry, 500 Cossacks, 4 guns and some sappers landed at Enzali-and advanced to Kazvin to watch the Tehran situation. Having seized this pretext, however, for a professedly temporary occu pation, Russia never withdrew her troops despite the remons trances of Great Britain, who advocated a policy of non intervention in Persia in accordance with the spirit gf the 1907 Convention. The anti-Russian feeling engendered among the Persian constitutionalists and the attitude they conse quently assumed towards Russia, were productive of friction and of the estrangement which led to the disastrous events of 1911, and the crushing by Russian ultimatums of the only hopeful reform tendency evolved during the period. 1 It was settled that he should relinquish his estates to the Persian Govern ment, who in return took over his debts to the Russian Bank and promised him an annual pension of 100,000 tumans. 2 It is impossible to judge to what extent this immunity was due, to fear of the consequences owing to the peculiar position in which Persia found herself between her two powerful neighbours, England and Russia.The deposition of Muhammad Ali marks the end of the second phase of the c Constitutional movement.* The following extracts, from pages 35, 36, and 37 of the Military Report on Persia, convey a realistic impression of events in 1909-10. “ An eye-witness of the whole gives in the ‘ National Review* most interesting details and sidelights on the series of events eVen “ which resulted in the present regime in Persia, and on the first year of popular government. Comparing the Turkish Nationalist movement with that of the Persians, it is justly remavked that the Young Turk party had in their hands a fairly efficient army ; the Persians had nothing but a crowd of unpaid ragamuffins not worth consideration, and in addition it was doubtful if even a national or popular spirit existed. To the very last it seemed uncertain if the Nationalists would succeed in entering Tehran, and deposing the Shah. Two principal causes brought about the result. Firstly, as in India, Egypt, and to a minor extent China, the ferment of European education and ideas of liberty and justice (equal ity and iraternity play a small part in Oriental revolutions) ; secondly, the co-operation of the Bakhtiaris, without which the Sipahdar would never have dared to advance. What their motive was in joining is a mystery ; they had no sentimental feeling about emanci|ating the Persians from the Kajar des- p otism, on the contrary they dislike and despise the Persians. The first Cabinet of July 1909, included the Sipahdar and Sardar Asad merely as figure heads, till the Young Persians should find it advisable to take up the reins of Government. Meantime the actual power was retained in the hands of about 25 Young Persians, who hoped to control the Ministers without sharing their responsibilities. Their insolence and underground machinations, however, soon caused them to dissolve, and metamorphose themselves into an advisory committee of 40 members, which included some of the chief personalities of the Cabinet. Finally, the Sipah Salar and Sardar Asad resigned, and took their seats in the Majlis as simple deputies ; the new Cabinet contained some of the most progressive of the Young Persians. Many members of the National Assembly were violent, unreasonable extremists, devoid of practical experience and education, whose one idea was to declaim against the two Powers, who alone held the country from complete disintegration, and hurl themselves at Responsible Ministers. It is not surprising that Ministers resigned again and again, and there were perpetual Cabinet26 1010 . prices As a natural result the administration of the provinces was in absolute chaos. Not one of the Young Persians having executive experience, character or authority necessary to govern a province, they had to fall back on officials of the old regime as Governors and Governors-General. The powers of these were nevertheless curbed by the appointment _ of voung inexperienced men of the new order in the remaining offices, who checked and thwarted them at every turn, khus the old order and the new were intermingled m bewildering confusion. The young men suddenly elevated from absolute nobodies, became inflated with preposterous ideas of their own importance; and the old officials, regarding them contemptuously, would end the new order on the spot if they could. The popular assemblies elected at each provincial centre displayed neither initiative nor energy, and, beyond worrying the executive a nf.hnrities in absurd trivialities, did absolutely nothing. Public opiniofi as directed towards the administration of a country, even with popularly elected deputies, cannot be evoked in an instant in a nation like the Persians, accustomed for centuries to autocratic rule. The deputies, many of them Mullas, meet, chat and smoke, but have not the vaguest idea of how to conduct public business. The conclusion is that the period of preparation here was too short, and the national spirit too supine, for evolving men of the right stamp, and except for reactionary and greedy Shi’ah Mullas on the one hand, and violent 1 Turkish and Caucasian revolutionaries on the other, no men of character and natural gifts appear to exist in Persia of to-day.'

The ultra-democratic party quarrelled with the clergy and Saiyid Abdullah, a Muj tabid who had played a leading part during the early days of the movement in Tehran in 1906-1907 as a constitutionalist, was assassinated in July. A counter assassination Of the nephew- of the ultra-democrat Taqlzadeh followed, and Taqlzadeh himself, who had been excommunicated by a *‘ fatvah ’ from Najaf, left Tehran. The Government took vigorous action and ordered the immediate surrender of arms by all except regular authorized forces. Some 300 Mujahidin assembled in the garden of Sattar Khan, the defender of Tabriz, and refused compliance, but the Govern ment was supported by Yeprim and Sardar Asad Bakhtiari, the garden was rushed by Bakhtiaris, and the ‘ Fida’is, 5 as they are called, were forcibly disarmed. In February 1910 Great Britain and Russia offered a joint loan to Persia, but their conditions that its expenditure must he approved by the Legations, that Persia should engage French financial advisers, that provision must be made for security of the trade routes!, that Great Britain and Russia should have the refusal of any railway concession except in the case of a Persian undertaking, that the Julfa-Tabrlz route Company should receive a concession for navigation on the Urumieh lake, aroused suspicion and apprehension, and caused the rejection of the offer as incompatible with Persian independence. This year marks the increase of tension with Russia; the revolutionary Committee was hoping that the deposition of the Shah would end Russian influence in Persia, and Russia was not disposed to he conciliatory owing to resentment at the actions of the Committee. It is also noteworthy as the year when proposals were made for the engagement of foreign advisers to organize the adminis trative departments. Great Britain and Russia were appre hensive lest Germans might be invited, and suggested to the Persian Government that nationals of small powers should be engaged, failing which they would demand employment of their own nationals. Some excitement and anti-British feeling was aroused during the year owing to a peremptory British note to the Persian Govejnment that unless order were restored within ■3 months on the Bushire-Isfahan road, where insecurity was paralysing British trade, Great Britain would be obliged to make her own arrangements for its policing and recovery of the expense from the revenues of Fars.28 A rebellion was also started by the chiefs of Mazandaran and is described in paragraph 5 below. In fact with the excep tion of the districts in the immediate vicinity of Tehran almost the whole of Persia was disordered. The Persians maintained that the causes of these troubles* were:— 1. The presence of foreign troops in Persia. 2. The abuse of the privilege of ‘ bast ’ in the Legations* whereby reactionaries secured Russian protection and kept alive hopes of restoration of the ex-Shah. 3. Lack of money. 1911. Engagement of Mr. Shuster by Persian Gov ernment as) financial adviser. 1 The Russians parleyed about the withdrawal of their troops, and in return demanded concessions for free import without duties of motor cars to run from Julfa to Kazvin and an extension of copper mining rights in Karadagh. The troops however, were reduced, but not withdrawn. In 1911 negotiations were continued for engagement of foreign advisers and eventually Americans we*e engaged for the finances, and Swedes for police and Gendarmerie. A pro posal to engage Swedes also to organize a Persian military force was frustrated by representations made at Stockholm by Russia, who was jealous for the Persian Cossack division officered by Russians. Some Prench professors were also engaged. Russia was from the outset displeased at the Persian invi tation to Americans to organize the finances, and at their failing to consult Russian wishes before taking this step. In May 1911 Mr. Shuster, an American citizen, engaged on a private contract with Persia and not sent by the American Government, arrived at Tehran, with a small staff, with the designation of Treasurer General to organize the financial administration. He at once adopted an attitude of independ ence of foreign control and paid no deference to the diplomatic representatives of Russia and Great Britain, thereby gaining the c nfidence and support of the Persians, who were very restive at the control being imposed upon them. On 13th June the Assembly passed a law. drafted by Mr- Shuster which gave him very wide 1 financial ptowers. All revenues were to be collected by him, and his signature was required for all payments. 1 The full scope of these powers was probably hardly realized at the time. Their effective exercise would render official peculation impossible, and it is - likely that the cabinet and official classes would have acquiesced in the surrender this time honoured'and nrecious privilege without a struggle.29 [azandaran itheexcep ran almost se trouto Legations, protection ie ex-Shi heir troops, )r t irithont in and an Fhe troops gement ol gaged for ipro- ary force holm by officered ged. ian at their &gt;?• igaged on American ) -sith the l financial ' independ’ diploma* ;hy ga* were ^ peers' gnatm® 0 On the 17th June the ex-Shah with a few followers suddenly RebeMon of ex, and unexpectedly landed at Ghumish Tappeh, in an attempt galar-ud- to recover the throne, and Salar-ud-Dauleh, his brother, also Dauleh, 1911, raised the standard of rebellion on his behalf at Senneh in Kurdistan. Muhammad All’s adventure was thwarted by the incapacity and indecision which distinguished all his undertakings, and its history is narrated in para. 5 below under the heading of Mazandaran. The menace from Mazandaran was ended by the defeat of Arshad-ud-Dauleh in Varamin on 5th September. Simultaneously operations were in progress against Salar-ud- Dauleh, who had seized Kirmanshah and was rumoured to have collected a force of 10,000 men. ^y 23 rd of August he had advanced from Kirmanshah to the South of Hamadan, had driven or frightened away all oppo sition and himself appeared as a Pretender to the throne. No force remained to bar his progress to Tehran. A mixed body of 1,200 Bakhtiaris and Armenians, however, was hurriedly raised, a d joined a loyalist detachment which had retired from Sultanabad in ‘Iraq’ to Qum, and met and defeated 4,000 rebels at Bagh-i-Shah near Saveh. Salar-ud-Dauleh, who was awaiting the result of the fray at Nubaran, fled by Hamadan to Burujird in Luristan and his following of tribesmen dispersed. The tide of rebellion was consequently checked, largely owing to the efforts of Mr. Shuster to provide money, and to the personality of Yeprim, who was the heart and soul of the opposi tion. It had, however, grievously embarrassed the struggling constitutional Government, and accentuated its hatred and mistrust of Russia. The ex-Shah had been exiled to an asylum in European Russia and the Russian Government was conse quently blamed 1 for his return. The Russian and British Legations had protected the ex- Shah on his deposition and conducted negotiations with the revolutionaries to settle his pension and remove him to Russia, but made no energetic pronouncement against his rebellion and * The question whether the Russian Government did or did not connive at his return to Persia is very obscure. It appears that they must have been aware that it was impending, but the fact thatdn June 1911 they had sold arms and ammunition to the Persian Government, without which they could never have put downlthe rebellion, points to the fact that at any rate they had not long foreknowledge. Probably the Russian Government was aware that Muhammad All was plotting and remained benevolently neutral by not discouraging him or warning the frontier authorities to he on the alert. Russian subordinate officials must have assisted him, as otherwise he could never have travelled across Russia taking munitions and stores to Baku. In Persia the Russian Lega tion remained neutral, hut Russian Consuls aided him and Russian opinion in. Tehran unanimously hoped he would succeed.

Bumian opposi tion to Mr. Shuster. Stokes episode. Before the rebellion had been crushed friction had started concerning Mr. Shuster’s programme. Apart from his independ ent attitude and refusal to consult Russian wishes, he had given offence to that power by the appointment of 3 2 British Subjects to posts in his administration Mr. Shuster also had at once realized the necessity of a force at his disposal for collection of the revenues, and decided to organize a Treasury gendarmerie. For this work he required the services of Major Stokes, whose appointment, as British Military Attache at Tehran, was on the point of expiry. Mr. Shuster did not consult the Russian or British Legations. The appointment of a British subject to raise an armed force which might be employed in the Russian sphere of influence, was bound to be distasteful to that power and the appointment of Major Stokes particularly so, owing to his ardent pro-Constitu- tionalism. Russian opposition was at once aroused and became increasingly vehement. The British Government who had at first rebuked Major Stokes for not consulting them before accepting the appointment and informed him that he would be obliged to resign his Indian Army commission, gave way to Russian pressure, refused to accept his resignation and finally peremptorily ordered him out of Persia. Russia had become more and more incensed at Mr. Shuster’s presumption in working wholeheartedly for Persian reform without consulting her wishes or interests, and finally seized on an incident arising from the confiscation of the estates of Shu’a- Btussian ultima- us-Sultaneh, the younger brother of Muhammad Ali, as a punish- tnms to Persia. men ^ f or the part he had taken in the latter’s rebellion, to demand an apology from the Persian Government followed on 25th November by a 48 hours’ ultimatum :— (1) to dismiss Messrs. Shuster and Lecoffre from Persian Government service, (2) in future to engage no foreigners without the consent of Russia and Great Britain, (3) to defray the cost of a military expedition which Russia had sent to Enzali to enforce this ultimatum. 1 Russia refused to go further. The only concession Russia subsequently made to Great Britain was a declaration that the Russian military preparations had no connection with the aspirations of Muhammad All. s Messrs. Haycock, Schindler and Lecoffre. They were selected by Mr. Shuster irrespective of their nationality as the only suitable persons present in Tehran for his work. The appointment of Mr. Lecoflre, who held pronounced ‘ Constitutionalist’ views, to Tabriz, in the Russian sphere of influence, gave especial umbrage.31 ,y and that lad statei r also laii lisposal to ■ a Treasiut seirices of ,ry Attache ter did not ppointment liicli might i bound to of Major i-Constitu- used and lent Trio big them a that he on, Agnation Shuster’s i reform seked on oiSto’a- 3 a punish- to demand on 2oth om dby»5i Srfi In the event of non-cornpliance Persia was threatened with an advance of the Russian troops from Rasht, and an increase in the indemnity. British diplomatic protests at Saint Reters- burgh were overriden and Russia persisted in her demands. An ti-Russian feeling ran high in Tehran, Russian goods were boycotted, and a run was started on the Imperial Bank of Persia, which, as a British institution, incurred unpopularity for the British Government’s failure to support Persia against this tyranny. The Persian Assembly refused to comply with the Russian ultimatum, and 3,000 to 4,000 Russian troops advanced to Kazvin and were expected to move on Tehran on December 21st. The position was desperate, melees with the Russian troops at Rasht, Enzali and Tabriz resulted in the killing of several Persians, and finally on 24th 1 December the Regent of Persia, Nasr-ul-Mulk, the Cabinet and Yeprim forcibly dissolved the obdurate Assembly to avoid worse disasters by further impo tent opposition to Russia. On Christmas day Mr. Shuster was dismissed. Such was the dismal ending to Mr. Shustei s valiant attempt to evolve order out of chaos in the Persian financial administration, the only promising work of organi zation yet undertaken in Persia. It had already achieved a considerable measure of initial success, and might, if carried to its conclusion, have gone far to set on its feet the embryo Constitutional Government. For a while Belgian Treasurers General endeavoured to carry on Mr. Shuster s work, and Belgians in the provinces combined the duties of Customs officials and revenue officers, but his successors did not put the same heart into the work, and his dismissal had disheartened the ‘ young ’ Persians and made them feel that Russian hostility made the realization of their hopes and aspirations impossible. As a result of the Russian ultimatums the chaos in th® provinces had increased and Azarbaljan and Pars were withou Governors. Insecurity in Pars became so menacing that a regiment of Indian cavalry were dispatched to restore order, 2 squadrons being stationed at Shiraz, one at Bushire and one at Isfahan. Although the rebellions of Muhammad Ali and of Salar-ud- Dauleh had been broken they had not been entirely_ crushed. The latter had revived his cause, defeated Sardar Muhi, reoccu- 1 The Assembly had already sat for more than the period of 2 years prescribed in the ‘ Constitution.'32 pied Astarabad and again entered Mazandaran. On February 6th the British and Russians Legations suggested to the Persian Government that as Muhammad All’s cause was hopeless and he would never gain their support, he should be warned to quit Persia on condition of an amnesty and continuance 1 * * of his pension. He was still counting on Russian assistance and demanded orders from the Czar, but finally consented to quit Persia and retired via Ashuradeh to Baku on 12th March 1912. The Russians still further increased their unpopularity by intervening in civil disturbances in Meshed, connected with Muhammad All’s rebellion, and bombarding the masjid of Imam Riza, the most sacred shrine in Persia, on 30th March. Meanwhile the Salar-ud-Dauleh was still a rebel and claimed the Government of Western Persia. Kirmanshah repeatedly changed hands between the Salar and the Government troops. On 19th May Yeprim took command and routed a rebel force in Kurdistan, but was himself killed in the engagement. Yeprim was the only strong personality inspiring confidence, who had ' come into prominence during the revolution, and his death was a great loss to Persia. Salar-ud-Dauleh prolonged his activities in the territory of Kirmanshah and Kurdistan until, in October 1912, he suddenly was reported to have reached the Sauj Bulagh district about 30 miles from Tehran. He did not, however, make any attempt on the capital. Bakhtiaris went in pursuit, and he was next heard of near Astarabad. His following had melted away and he gained the protection of the Russian Consul and started negotiations with the Tehran Government, through the Russian Legation, to appoint him Governor General of Gilan. Without awaiting their decision he vanished from Astarabad, reappeared at Sabzavar on the Tehran-Meshed road with a small force, returned to Astarabad and took ship for Rasht. His followers took the land route along the Caspian coast, fired on some of Sipahdar’s (i.e., Vali Khan afterwards Sipah Salar) men in Tunakabun, and came off worse in the encounter. Salar from Gilan made his way back via Talish to Garrus and Kurdistan, where he surrendered to some Cossacks in pursuit of him, was released on parole and absconded, but on failing to raise a force from among the Turko-Persian frontier tribes took 4 bast ’ in the Russian Consulate at Kirmanshah, whence he again utilized the good offices of the Russians. He went to Switzer- 1 Despite the fact that his rebellion, which could never have occurred had Kussia fulfilled her moral obligation to Persia and prevented him from leaving ms asylum, had involved the Persian Government in the difficulties and expense of civil war.33 land with a pension from the Persian Government, and Persia was relieved of his presence until 1918. 1 The illstarred attempt at financial reorganization in 1911 formation has been described. The invitation, however, of Swedish officers merie g we . for the formation of a gendarmerie was temporarily more dish Officers; successful. They started to raise a force in 1911, with which 1 000 Treasury gendarmes raised by Mr. Shuster were amalga mated. By the end of 1912 they numbered 3,000 Persians with 21 Swedish officers, and in 1913 between 5,000 and 6,000 Persians with 36 Swedish officers. The force . was fairly satisfactory and was always supported by the British Legation as a counterforce to the Persian Cossack division, under Russian officers. The function of the gendarmerie was to provide garrisons for road posts, and mobile columns at provincial headquarters. They controlled the districts around Tehran, 2 and placed posts along the Tehran-GIlan, Tehran-Kazvln-Hamadan, _ Tehran- Samnan, Tehran-Qum-Sultanabad, and Kazvin-Zinjan roads. In 1913 a thousand gendermerie were sent to Shiraz,. convoyed consignments of arms from Bushire and fought with tribes men between Shiraz and Bushire. They also made a raid into Luristan. These dispositions were followed by a decrease in brigandage and highway robbery, which had become very prevalent. The break up of this gendarmerie force in 1915 is described ■ m para. 4 below (pages 38, 39). With the year 1911 the 3rd phase of the ‘ Constitutional ’ events movement closes. In the spring the Persians had invited se q U ent Persian foreign advisers to undertake the task of reorganization for history, which they themselves had proved incapable. The rebellion of the ex-Shah and of S alar - u d- D auleh had been crushed, and a gendarmerie instituted, but the Russian ultimatums had -caused the expulsion of the American financial advisers, and had precipitated the country deeper into the slough of despond. Until the end of 1913 the revenues were collected by Belgians and showed some increase, but little effort was made at reform, and Persia drifted along on the brink of bankruptcy, which she 1 See para. 4, page 60. - . 1 , 2 In Tehran they nearly came into conflict with the Bakhtiarls.

Other conditions related to Muhammad All, the ex-Shah. Great Britain also lent £15,000 to be expended in Pars. In 1913 a joint’loan was made of £400,000. Concessions in return were granted for— (a) a railway along the Julfa-Tabriz road to he continued to Kazviri. # (b) a survey for a railway from Muhammarah to Khurramabad in Luristan after which the Persian Government should decide either itself to construct the railway or to give a concession.

The Turks lost no time in entering Persian Azarbaijan and on 6th January 1915 the Russian Consul and troops retired from Tabriz, which was occupied by 1,200 Turks and Kurds. Ardabil was also evacuated by the Russians, but soon_ after reoccupied. Active Turko-German intrigue and pan-Islamic propaganda began to fan the flame of hatred of the Russians to draw Persia into the war against the Allies, and culminated in the period April to November 1915. In Tehran a run on the Imperial Rim organized Bank was started by the drawing of 60,000 tumans in cash by Persi* the German Minister. Consignments of specie were delayed April 1915. owing to difficulties of transport and the Bank was unable to meet the demands made on it. On 27th April a bill was hurried through the Majlis for the suspension of cash payments of more than 10,000 tumans daily for 60 days, and a guarantee was given by the British Government that it would make good any cash deficit. Speculators sought to depreciate _ the Bank’s paper currency and buy it up at a discount, knowing that they would be able to obtain cash after 60 days, but the rate of dis count soon fell from 15% to 5% and the danger 2 of a Bank crash was averted. _ Tehran was in a very nervous condition. The Grendarmene were undermined by German intrigue and the police were the only force that could be relied on in the event of an anti-Ally outbreak. In the provinces there was an influx of enemy agents; the Turks had become aggressive on the frontier and at the beginning of April advanced to Qasr-i-Shlrln and Karind ; Prince Reuss, a German M inister with an Austrian co lleague. 1 Persians often blame the presence of the Russian troops as the provoca tion for the subsequent operations of the belligerents in Persia. Technically the Russians we re in the wrong, but had they withdrawn there is not the least justi fication for supposing that the Turks would have refrained from entering the country, at any rate the province of Azarbaijan. 2 during this crisis the Russian Bank adopted a sympathetic attitude towards the officers had been recalled to Sweden in 1914._ Their successors were of an inferior type, soon threw off all semblance of neutrality and worked for the Germans.36 came from Baghdad to Tehran escorted with great eclat by the Gendarmerie with a large cortege and a plentiful supply of money and munitions, and, to avoid a conflict wuth the Turks, the Persian Cossack detachment had been ordered to leave Kirmanshah 1 and the British and Russian colonies had decided to accompany them. Conditions in Hamadan, Sultanabad, Isfahan, were also menacing, while Wassmuss, the German Consul at Shiraz, was creating trouble in Shiraz and Pars and had gained the support of the Democrats. The Majlis had become thoroughly pro-Turk and German and was dominated by the ‘ Democrats,’ who, at any rate until the Russian ultimatums 2 of 1911, had been friendly disposed towards Great Britain, but now became anti-ally ‘ Nationalists ’ with the cry of “ Persia for the Persians.” The Cabinet was too weak to take any action, and Persians generally, while as yet having no idea of severing relations with Great Britain and Russia, which would involve an imme diate stoppage of trade and probability of ultimate retribution from those powers, delighted at seeing the Russians flouted with impunity and would not countenance any attempt to check German activity. After the arrival of some Russian reinforcements at Kazvin, not, however, in sufficient force to control the situtation, the centre of German activity shifted in June to Isfahan, where 30 Austrians, who had escaped from Transcaspia, were the nucleus for an irregular force. The Germans were busy in other places also in raising Persian levies. The number of Germans and Austrians near Isfahan increased to 300 with a plentiful supply of arms and a wireless installation. The Russian Bank Manager at Isfahan had been murdered in May ; the British Residency at Bushire was attacked and in August Bushire was occupied by a British force ; an attempt was made on the life of the British Consul-General at Isfahan and in September the British and Russian colonies evacuated the town; the British and Russian Consuls attempting to return to Kirmanshah were attacked en route by the German Consul at Kangavar and obliged to go back to Hamadan; the Gendar merie practically became an enemy force and were assisting the Germans in the importation of arms ; numerous parties of Germans arrived in Tehran from Baghdad and popular orators were declaiming against the allies. 1 The Turks, however, delayed their advance beyond Karind, as their irregulars toy pillaging m that neighbourhood had aroused anti-Turkish feeling.

The Gendarmerie began to requisition trans port on 11 th November and on the 15th, deputies of the Majlis, the Gendarmerie, Prince Reuss, the Austrian Minister, Turkish ambassador and all their sympathizers left the city and assembled at Shah Abdul Azim, 6 miles to the South, to await the arriya! of the Shah. Meanwhile in an eleventh hour interview with the Shah when he was on the point of departing, the Russian and British Ministers had prevailed on him to change his mind and remain in Tehran, on condition that the Russian troops should not advance beyond Karaj, on the Kazvin road, 26 miles from Tehran. The plot was baulked by the secession of the Shah and of the Cabinet who stayed with him,'but the exodus of Muhajirin 2 continued on the 16th and 17th from Tehran to Qum, where a 4C Committee 3 of National Defence was formed. The Tehran situation was mow under allied control, danger' to the Legations was at an end and Colonel Edwall, the Swedish Commander of the Gendarmerie, who had been most energetic in urging the Shah to go to Isfahan, took bast in the American Legation. The tide of pro-Germanism in the provinces, however, had not yet turned. The Gendarmerie, with the approval of their Swedish officers, came out in open rebellion and seized the telegraph offices at Isfahan, Shiraz, Sultanabad, Kirmanshah, Ramadan, and Qum. At Ramadan a detachment of Persian Cossacks had, surrendered to the 1 Since mid-October Tehran had been dominated by the Germans. 200 escaped Austrian prisoners were in bar racks outside, the town, ami were allied with 600 to 700 Gendarmerie under Colonel Bewail, and some hundreds of Mujahids. 500 Persian Cossacks and 1,000 police were powerless to resist them in the prevailing state of popular feeling.

At Sultanabad the Bank was looted and the British colony sought refuge at the American Consulate. At Shiraz also, the centre of Wassmuss’ activities, the Bank- met the same fate and the British community were arrested under threat of bombardment. The doubtful attitude of the Bakhtiaris was also alarming. The Russians, however, were following up the retreating pro-Germans. By the 25th of November in view of the improved situation in Tehran they had withdrawn from Karaj, but two columns were sent in pursuit without entering the capital. A column from Karaj went to Robat Karim, where they drove off a party of Gendarmes and others under Amir Hashmat, who had come from Zarand. A second column proceeded from Kazvin via Zahrah and Zarand to.Lalehkan on the road to Saveh, and encountered a force Of Gendarmerie and Shahsavans holding the defile of Vardeh. The Persians were defeated and evacuated Saveh, which was occupied by the Russians. From Saveh they advanced to Qum by the direct route and also via Manzariyeh, where they fought with some Gendarmes. At Qum the Russian force was again divided, part for Isfahan and part for 1 ’Iraq. The Persians broke up into several parties, which afterwards united at Burujird 1 or Kirmanshah, where they joined the Turkish army and retreated with it to Qasr-i-Shirin, whence some 400 or 500 returned to Persia and about 1,600 went to Mesopotamia. 2 ‘ Within 4 months of their exodus from Tehran the Muha- jirln were disillusioned and realized it had ended in a fiasco and that they had been the dupes of foreign intrigues.

Gendarmerie detachments from Isfahan and elsewhere had joined up with them, and the Gendarmerie passed out of existence. 1 Nizam-us-Sultaneh, Governor of Luristan, had received large sums of money from the Germans to raise levies and openly joined the Turks when informed of the Shah’s decision to leave Tehran. He left Burujird before most of thesejjparties arrived there. ' From Mesopotamia they made their way back to P ersia after the Russian revolution or went to Constantinople.39 European intervention had thus inflicted another disaster on Persia. As the Russian ultimatums demanding the dismissal of Mr. Shuster had been fatal to the financial reforms initiated in 1911 so Turko-German intrigue and misrepresentations were responsible for the destruction of the Gendarmerie the creation of which force, also in 1911, had been the only other constructive work undertaken during the Constitutional regime. In December 1915 the Russian troops at Kazvin mustered Operations of 12 000 but the situation was adversely affected by General Russian force*. 5, Nixon’s reverses in Mesopotamia, and the possibility of the Turks at Kirmanshah, who numbered about 10,000, being reinforced. By January 1916 General Baratoff had driven off hostile lements beyond the line Tehran-Varamin-Qum-Sultanabad- Hamadan-Kangavar (on the Hamadan-Rirmanshah road) and the enemy forces were concentrated at Buruprd and Kir manshah, whence their line of communications to Baghdad was unimpeded. The Russian advance was continued, they placed garrisons at Isfahan, Kashan, Qum, Karaj, Sultanabad, Ramadan and Burujird and in the early summer of 1916 drove the Turks down to their Mesopotamian frontier beyond^Qasr-i- Shirin Thev suffered severely, however, from heat, fatigue, a uss ; ail re tre a t sickness, dearth of rations and of reinforcements, and in August jjm Kh^ln when attacked by superior Turkish forces, General Baratott situation of beat a precipitate retreat from Khaniqin through Kirmanshah summer 1916. back to the Sultan Bulagh pass near Aveh (or Avaj) 50 miles North of Ramadan along the road to Kazvin.

By the end of September 1916 the situation was sufficiently stabilized to admit of the return of the European colony from Enzali to Tehran, but the Turkish menace was not entirely removed until the British capture of Baghdad in March 1917. The effects in Persia of the capture of Baghdad were, however, immediately counteracted by the Russian revolution, which had a great effect on the British position in Persia, and is a turning 1 * point in Anglo-Persian relations. It caused the disappearance for the time being of Russia as a political factor in Persia, and left Great Britain without a rival in the whole country, North as well as South. The Persian Democrats began to hope for assistance from a regenerated Russian democ racy, and Great Britain from being regarded by the Persians as helpful and progressive, as compared with Russia, now found herself in the position of the reactionary. For the moment the military situation was weak. Opera tions in Northern Persia had been undertaken by the Russian forces, whose advent had saved the situation at the end of 1915, and this task must now devolve on Great Britain,whose nearest troops -were far away in Mesopotamia, Tehran politics had been most sensitive to the mili tary position of the movement. When this was adverse to allied prestige and the Turks and Germans appeared ascendant, the combined Anglo-Russian influence in Tehran was not able to maintain their friends in power. It was, however, strong enough to prevent the formation of a pronouncedly anti-ally Govern ment, and weak and colourless Cabinets with democratic leanings resulted, which were either quite ineffective or mildly obstruc tive to the Allies, and so afforded license to the intrigues of their enemies.

In April 1915 Russia and Great Britain were able to impose ’Ain-ud-Dauleh as Premier. During bis Premiership the Government was as usual involved in financial difficulties and was faced with a deficit of £400,000. The powers agreed in June upon a ‘moratorium’ scheme, whereby Russia released a monthly sum of £20,000 from the Northern Customs receipts, and Great Britain a monthly sum of £10,500 from the Southern Customs receipts, which were assigned for interest on their respective loans, and also consented not to press for payment of arrears. ’Ain-ud-Dauleh strove to lead the ‘Democrats’ and bend them to his will, but found them his master, and they brought about his fall 1 on 9th July. The retirement of the Russians in Poland and Galicia, the small result of Italy’s entrance into the war, the failure of the allies to achieve success in Flanders and Gallipolia had lowered their prestige in Persia, and Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, a moderate Democrat leader, was appointed Premier. The formation of his Cabinet was protracted from 9th July to 18th August, and during this interregnum, without'even a nominal Government, the country fell an easy prey to German intrigue. His weak ness, timidity or connivance at German activities were disas trous and produced the crisis necessitating the Russian military action of November 1915, by which was restored the situation, Russian prestige, however, was low owing to the belated arrival of these reinforcements, and to their ill success in Europe, while the British advance in Mesopotamia with the threat to the Turkish Line of Communication through Mesopotamia to Persia, and the occupation of Bushire, tended to direct atten tion to the British. The re-assertion of allied influence, in Tehran, consequent on the arrival of Russian troops, caused the fall of Mustaufi-ul- Mamalik’s Cabinet and the appointment of the pro-British Farman Farma in December 1915. In March 1916 Russian prestige had risen after General Baratoff had cleared the Turks out of Northern Persia and advanced to the frontier of Meso potamia, and intrigues of the pro-Russian party brought about the appointment of the Russophil Sipah Salar in supersession of Farman Farma. The allies during the period of their weakness had been pre pared to give some concessions in return for Persia’s alliance, 1 The fall of the Cabinet was due to Democratic outcry against Farman Farma who had made some slight anti-German efforts.42 Sip&amp;h Silar agreement with Great Britain and Russia, 1916.

These consessions were whittled away, how ever, after General Baratoff’s successes and in August. Sipah Salar as Premier signed an agreement with Great Britain and Russia authorizing the formation of forces under conti ol of each power in South and North Persia respectively, and of the exercise of financial control over the Persian Government in return for a monthly subsidy of 200,000 tumans to be continued during the war. This agreement was not signed until August, when the Russian retreat from Khaniqin again rendered the situation precarious. 5 days later Sipah Salar was dismissed by the Shah, took fright at the outcry which such a sale of Persia would raise, and, fearing lest he might fall into the hands of the Turks, fled to Kazvln on the road to the Caspian. \ usiiq-ud- Dauleh succeeded him as Premier at the end of August and was more friendly with the British as being more moderate than the Russians. The Sipah Salar agreement was not put into execution, but was not cancelled. Sir Percy Sykes, however, commenced the formation of the South Persia Rifles at Kirman and took over a small body of Gendarmerie. Vusuq-ud-Dauleh temporized and was afraid to recognize him as chief of a corps of instructors under the agreement, but subsequently, when the question of financial control over the Persian Government was shelved, the.South Persia Rifles were officially recognized as a Governmental force. The Russian revolution followed by the disorganization of the Russian forces in Persia, and the weak ness of Great Britain’s military position in the country promoted increase in democratic intrigue, and a Committee 1 of Punish ment ” came into existence and started political assassinations to intimidate her supporters. The Shah refused to countenance energetic measures against this terrorism and Vusuq-ud-Dau.eh resigned on 5th June 1917. His resignation was due to the Russian revolution, and was a victory for the Anglophobe democrats who were supreme during the Cabinet of his succes sor ’Ala-us-Sultaneh. On the fall of his Cabinet, in November 1917 ’Ain-ud- Dauleh was called to office, but was unable to form a ministry, and resigned. The internal troubles of the country were grave. The treasury, as usual, was empty, and the ordinary sources of revenue were unproductive by reason of unrest in many pro vinces, and of the restriction of trade due to chaos in Russia 1 Anjuman-i-mujaz&amp;tpjoffloted ,{puni^ l ssinati 0 ' 15 )®tenan“ .ud-D^ lue to * his succe* 1 43 rsians Bnic away, te .ugnstSi^ Britain aii itiolofead and of tls ■ernment ii ie continiei atil Augast s dismissal deofPersii Vusuq-ai .ugust anl The harvest in most parts of the country had failed, and it was plainly evident that severest famine conditions must prevail unless the Government should step in to regulate supplies and prices with a strong hand. The last Government had knowledge of the approaching calamity, and had failed to take measures to meet it; they had even sold the government stores of grain throughout the country. The populous regions within reach of the lines of communi cation of the Russian armies on the Hamadan and Azar- baijan fronts were exposed to plunder by these troops, which were rapidly losing all semblance of discipline. Tabriz and Azarbaijan were threatened by Turkish forces following hard on the Russian armies in retreat from Erzerum. The Jangall sedition in Gilan had removed that province from control of the Shah’s Government. put int« iowever, t KinnaB d-Daufei a corps y, when ernment raized as jwed The outlook abroad was equally disquieting. Russia was in a state of civil war. Germany was concluding a peace with Ukrainia, and was marshalling the forces of the Central Powers for their supreme attack on the Western front of the Allies in France. Persia was veering to the opinion that the war would end favourably for the Central Powers, and that it would be wise to conciliate them. In these difficult circumstances the Shah decided again to Cabinet of entrust the government of the country to Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik. Wusnufl-ul- He accepted office, and by January 18th 1918 completed his Januaty-Aprfl Cabinet, in which moderate statesmen, such as Mushir-ud- 191 8 * Dauleh and his brother, were associated with Mukhbir-us- Sultaneh and other leaders of the advanced democrats. It was soon evident that the new Government were as little willing as their predecessors to arrange difficulties with the Allied representatives. They refused to give recognition to the South Persia Rifles, and maintained the demand for annulment of the convention of 1907 between Great Britain and Russia, as a measure which had been aimed against the integrity and independence of Persia. The British reply on these matters is very clearly expressed in a speech by Earl Curzon of Kedleston, in the House of Lords at that time The South Persia Rifles had been created with the consent of the Persian Government, to restore order other means.

A further decree appointed a committee to take the measures necessary to abolish the Foreign Office Tribunal in Tehran, |nnityo“; an d the Karguzar Courts in the provinces, in which suits ditoi ' between foreign and Persian subjects had hitherto been tried. The allied representatives promptly lodged notes declining v 1 Lit; CtlllCUL \ VXJ v^v/vzxxxxxxx^ th eX ' to recognise the legality of these decrees. It is well to take up, at this point, the trend of the many ment, under the guidance of these feeble Cabinets, had been little more than an unwilling spectator. The war exposed the Armenian communities of the Van Events in Van region, and the Assyrian, Chaldean or Nestorian, Christians of and Uriim 6 * 1 This involved also the cancellation of treaties with other foreign powers as the basis of them is the treaty of Turkomanchal of 1828, see para. 1 above, page 3.46 Turkish Kurdistan, to great peril. From 1916 onward, some of the Armenians and many of the Assyrians sought the comparative safety of the Urumieh and Salmas districts where the Christian communities were protected by the Persian Gov ernment. Earlier in the war the Russians had made use of some of these Assyrian mountaineers in irregular formations, called Jelus battalions, the Jelus being one of the four main clans of the race. After the Russians debacle, the Caucasian authorities, amongst other expedients for stemming the Turkish advance, raised in the Urumieh region, in the end of 1917 and beginning of 1918, from amongst these exiles, four or five thousand men, of whom about one fourth were Armenians and formed them into battalions under Russian and native officers. ’The move ment was watched and encouraged by Colonel Chardignes of the French military Mission in the Caucasus, and by Captain Gracey, a British political officer. These brave but undisciplined troops were undoubtedly the only visible protection of the Christian population from spolia tion and massacre, but their presence was offensive to the Muhammadans of the province, and the Persian Government was induced to take steps to disarm them in the spring of 1918. They fiercely resisted this ill-timed measure, which must be held responsible, in some degree, for the excesses committed by them at that time. During these troubles the Nestorian Patri arch, Marshimum, was murdered in the house, near Salmas, of Simko, a prominent Kurdish chief. Exodnsof These Jelus irregulars successfully defended the Urumieh triamieE July region against the Turks, till the end of the month of July. 1918. ’ gut their resources were failing, and their ammunition was nearly spent, and there seemed no prospect that help from the British army in Mesopotamia, for which they had long hoped, could reach them in time • to enable them to withstand the attack of the Turkish forces gathering to overwhelm them. At last, in response to a message delivered by British aeroplane the main body of their forces marched to Sain Kaleh,where arms and British officers were to be supplied to them. Their departure caused a panic amongst the now defenceless masses, who decided to seek the help that could not come to them; and the exodus of the Christian community took place on July 30th. The majority, no doubt, were already exiles who had abandoned in despair the Kurdistan villages which their ancestors had guarded down the centuries, but the Urumieh plain dwellers had now to make their decision between theXilfc?

The most important of these depredators were the Qashqai tribes. Their IlkhanI, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, had been in the forefront of the anti-British outbreaks of the two previous years, and had cause to dread the development of all force able to overawe his tribal levies, and possibly disposed, being under British guidance, to bring him to book for his past misdeeds. The petty chiefs of the Bushire hinterland were in a similar position, and they had amongst them, in the person of Wassrnuss,. who had taken refuge with the Tangistani chief, Zair Khiddar, at Ahram, a very capable German emissary to instil hopes of defeat of the allies and of immunity from British reprisals. The Cabinet of the day was dominated by the ultra-radical party, known to be strongly opposed to all British interests in Persia. The Government had protested against the drastic punishments meted out to civil offenders by the South ' ersia Rifles, and against the summai’y execution of deserters from the force, convicted of absconding with their arms. The fact that the British and the Persian forces were alike under the command of one officer gave colour to the accusation that they were in reality a British force. Thus there was a good field for the intrigues carried on during the spring months to undermine the loyalty of the South Persia Rifles to their British officers, to foment discontent in the province of Pars. A grave situation developed suddenly in May out of a petty incident. The South Persia Rifles’ detachment at Khaneh-Zinian recovered some stolen property from the Darashuranl tribe of Qashqais, who retaliated by attacking the post. A force sent out under Colonel Williams dispersed the insurgents on May 12th. It was quickly put about that women and children had been ruthlessly killed in the course of these operations, and the cry was taken up by Saulat-ud-Dauleh, who raised his tribesmen and telegraphed to the Persian Government that, unless he received direct orders to remain quiet, he would defend Southern Persia against the South Persia Rifles. Either he did not receive, or affected that he did not receive, orders to desist, and by May22nd he had a’force of 3,000 to 4,000 tribesmen encamped within a few miles of Shiraz, and w r as making every effort to induce Quvvam-ul-Mulk, head of the Khamseh Arab tribes, to join him in revolt. There were about 2,300 British-Indian troops, at that time&gt; i^iian'xroopso in Shiraz, but their mobility was impeded by apprehension of sedition in the city and amongst the South Persia Rifles, neces sitating the retention of a strong garrison. However, about 1,600 Indian troops moved out on May 24th, and drove Saulat-ud- Dauleh out of his camp with much loss. Meantime the post at Khaneh-Zinian had yielded, and the garrison came into Shiraz without their British officers—Captain Wills and Sergeant Coomber—who had been murdered before the post was surrendered. An inquiry was instituted and three Persian officers and eleven men were shot. The Indian troops could not follow up their victory to a distance from their base, nor entangle themselves in difficult mountain country in face of an enemy who might possibly be able to bring much superior forces into the field, especially if he should succeed in inducing Quvvam-ul-Mulk to join him. Conse quently Saulat-ud-Dauleh was only repulsed not defeated, and quickly rallied his men, and reappeared before Shiraz with a following of 6,000 men, although Quvvam-ul-Mulk remained loyal to Farman Farma, Governor General of Fars. During the next six weeks the garrison confined its operations to sallies against the enemy, and awaited development of counter measures in course of preparation by the Indian Govern ment, who early sent reinforcements to Bandar Abbas, and despatched two battalions to Bushire, as the nucleus of a force destined to march on Shiraz through the heart of the enemy country. « The insurgents, disquieted by the news of these measures, , and worsted in their encounters with the Indian troops, gradually lost heart, and the garrison was able, on July 10th, to send a small column to the relief of their posts at Dehbid and Abadeh. The latter post, which was relieved on July 17th, had been in some danger and efforts had been made from Tehran, to get the Governor of Isfahan to send a Bakhtiari force, or the Cossack detachment stationed in that city, to attack the besiegers. Meantime the Governor General had been employing other methods to improve the situation. He obtained, after long delay, official sanction from the Cabinet to depose Saulat-ud-Dauleh from the post of Ilkhani of the Qashqai tribes, and to appoint his brother Sardar Ihtisham, in his place. He also detached50 Muhammad Ali Khan, chief of the Qashquli tribe, from the rebels, and induced Quvvam-ul-Mulk to muster his Arabs against Saulat-ud-Dauleh. On July 26th Saulat-ud-Dauleh was signally defeated, at Chinar-Rahdar, and fled South, pursued by a force under the leadership of the new Ilkhanl. The subsequent operations in the Qashqal country were protracted into the winter, but order was rapidly restored in the rest of Ears. The disaffection in Pars did not spread to the province of Kirman, and the loyalty of the Kirman brigade of South Persia Rifles was never doubted. Events in East Persia, Slst&amp;n cordon. Khor&amp;s&amp;n and fiist&amp;n Levy Corps. On account of the constant efforts of Germany and Turkey to get emissaries through Persia into Afghanistan and India— efforts which the Persian Government were unable or unwilling to frustrate—the Indian Government established a military cordon from Sistan to Birjand, and the Russian Government carried on the cordon to their, own frontier. When the Russian troops were withdrawn in the spring of 1918, the Indian Govern ment decided to prolong the Indian cordon to Sarakhs. The headquarters of this force were established at Meshed on March 20th. Corps of Persian irregulars were raised in Khorasan and Sistan chiefly to stop the passage of Germans into Afghanistan and also to suppress brigandage and guard the frontier against Afghan marauders. The Quetta-Nushki railway was gradually extended to the Persian border, and ultimately to Duzdab, in order to facilitate these operations. The Persian Government protested against these various activities in East Persia, and tried, for a time, to deter men from enlisting in the levy corps, but the people 'of Khorasan and Sistan found distinct benefit in the presence of the Indian troops, and no local difficulties arose at any time in connection with this military occupation. In the end of June General Malleson was placed in command of the military mission in Khorasan, and also took charge of the operations undertaken in support of the provisional government in Transcaspia. But the destinies of Persia are much more closely dependent on European, than on Asiatic politics, and the main difficulties and anxieties of the Persian Government lay in the North Western provinces, which stood in the path of the outer turmoil of the great war.It was becoming evident, toward the end of 1917, that the Russian barrier between East and West created by the contact of the British Expeditionary force in Mesopotamia, with the Kussian Expeditionary force under General Baratoff (holding t e Enzall-Kirmanshah line in Persia) would soon give way by reason of the dispersion of General Baratoff s army under stress of the debacle in Russia. Thus a door would be opened to Central Persia, and the East, for enemy emissaries and enemy propa ganda—and even for the Turkish forces which were already pressing forward on the heels of the Russians m full retreat everywhere from Van to the Black Sea—just at the moment when allied influence in Tehran, which since the autumn of 1915 had been fairly well maintained through the presence of Russian troops in Northern Persia, was waning. Further, the allies wished to support the provisional Govern ment which had been formed in the Caucasus, and the most ready means of communication with the Caucasus was by, Baghdad, Kirmanshah and Enzali, to Baku. It had been decided to send General Dunsterville from India, by this route, to assist in organizing the national finances and army of tms new government of a united Caucasus. In January 1918 the army of General Baratofi was rapidly breaking up. ^ The Board of Control appointed in the previous autumn to control the expenditure of the sums advanced by Great Britain for maintenance of this army was now engage in providing funds for its gradual evacuation via Enzali, an operation not completed till mid-April. Persia has not recog nized how great and costly a service was rendered by Bntem in securing its withdrawal in a fairly orderly manner The much smaller force on the Urumieh front, under General Vad- bolski, freely pillaged the villages on the line of its precipitate and riotous retreat to Julfa early in January. It was hoped for a time that a Russian volunteer force of 10,000 men, to be maintained at British expense, could be raised by Colonel Bicherakoff, and that it would suffice for the purpose of holding the line of communications in Persia, between Meso potamia and the Caucasus. Only 3,000 men enrolled in January, and even that number could not be maintained ; but the force, served useful purposes during, and for some time after, the evacuation of General Baratoff s army. General Dunsterville, and his mission of about 60 officers and non- Commissioned officers, travelling in armoured cars, were delayed by bad weather on the journey to Rasht, and did not arrive until February 18th at Enzali, where he found himself52 in a difficult position. There was some uncertainty as to the reception he would receive in Baku, where the Bolshevik party had gained ground ; and Kuchik Khan, the leader of the Jangali movement in Gilan, was distinctly hostile and refused to allow him to embark at Enzali. He was forced to abandon, for the time being the object of his mission, and returned to Kazvln. Jangcih's Kuchik 1 Khan,—an adventurer of peasant origin, who had their origin, fought for the Constitution and been implicated in less creditable growth and disturbances—had headed the Jangali movement in 1915 at attitude in 1918 . instigation of the Turks. His earlier efforts were directed against the Russian line of communications in Gilan, and caused so much annoyance to the Russians that, after the failure of Persian expeditions, they attacked the band with Russian troops and succeeded in temporarily scattering them. Their leader, however, escaped and gradually collected a larger fol lowing, and since the debacle of his old enemies, the Russians, after the revolution, had become a formidable power. He now directed the affairs of the Jangali movement from his head quarters at Kasma, some 18 miles west of Rasht; had a firm hold over Gilan ; was extending his influence into Mazandaran, Kazvin, Zinjan and Ardabil; was in touch with the revolutionary party in Azarbaijan ; and was becoming a real menace to the Shah’s Government. His fundamental objects were opposition to the Russians and redress of the wrongs endured by the peasantry at the hands of unjust landlords and an oppressive government. Latterly he had inclined, under the influence of German and Turkish emissaries, toward the pan-Islamic policy of a great Muham madan State embracing Caucasus and Transcaspia. Under the same influence he now became anti-British, and in the beginning of March imprisoned the British Vice-Consul and the Manager of the Rasht branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia. He defended this action on the ground that Sulaiman- Mirza, a noted ultra democrat, had been arrested by the British in Persian territory; and he demanded the release of this man before giving up his prisoners. This demand was ignored as Sulaiman Mirza had been detected in plotting with the Turks, and had been seized, on February 8th, in enemy ground on the Turkish frontier near Khaniqin. The Rasht prisoners were soon allowed to return to their houses, and were fairly well treated, under surveillance, until they secured freedom, in June, on the entry into Rasht of Bicherakoff’s men, but Captain Noel, a 1 For an account of the origin, growth and subsequent history of the Jan- gali movement see the sketch of Gilan history in para. 5 below, pages 76-85.British political officer, who had been arrested a few days after them, was very harshly treated, and rigorously imprisoned in the jungle until mid-August. The Jangalls, however, did not interfere with the evacua tion of General Baratoff’s army, but, as soon as it had passed Rasht, occupied the road as far as Manjil, where they were held up by a detachment of the volunteer force of Colonel Bicherakoff who 'was now stationed at Kazvin, in command of 1,200 men— the-only troops at that time available to oppose their advance on that place. The stability of the Shah’s Government might have been seriously endangered by a Jangali occupation of Kazvin; for their propaganda had spread through the central provinces and in the capital, where famine and misgovernment had created a large discontented element, ready for any social upheaval. Meantime General Dunsterville, on his return to Kazvin* being thwarted in his effort to reach Baku, had been entrusted with”the task of filling the gap between the Mesopotamian and Russian armies—by means of Bicherakoff’s volunteers, and such bodies of Persian irregulars from the neighbouring tribes as he could raise, and control, with the handful of British officers and non-commissioned officers at his disposal— until arrange ments should be completed for a military occupation, which now sebmed to the British Government to be necessitated by the political situation in Persia, and by the menace of Turkey in Azarbaijan. A small body of troops had been stationed at Qasr-i-Shirin in early January ; the line was extended to Kirmanshah in March, when the General Officer in Command at Baghdad issued a proclamation announcing that the British occupation was in no way directed against the Persian people, and was only a tem porary measure necessary to frustrate enemy operations and intrigues, which the Persian Government had proved itself unable to stop. It was not till June that General Dunster ville received enough troops to keep a watch on the Tabriz road and at the same time provide for an extension of his line to Enzali. The occupation was not opposed ; only one tribe, the Sinjabi, gave trouble and was severely handled by the neighbouring Kalhur tribe, whose attack was helped by one or two aeroplanes. Inde d the occupied region had been so pillaged by Turks and Russians, and had suffered so much from the famine, that the people welcomed the British for sake of the great help they gave in re-settling villages, in supplying food and seed corn, and in providing relief works.

It has been stated that the Russian army in Azarbaljan had retreated hurriedly in the beginning of January, leaving the pro vince defenceless against the advancing Turks—save for the small Jelus force in Urumieh. But it was not till toward the end of April that a body of about 4,000 men, under Zaki Bey, was reported to be operating against the Urumieh region from Ushnu and Kotur. The Jelus battalions repulsed several attacks and held their ground till late in July, when the Christian exodus, already* described, took place. Many Armenian and Nestorian families had fled during these months to the Caucasus ; but this route was barred to them, in the middle of May, by Turkish forces closing in on Tabriz through Khoi and Nakhichivan. On June 10th, the consuls and subjects of the Allies left Tabriz to avoid the consequences to them of the Turkish occupa tion of that place. The Valiahd and Persian officials remained and were treated with consideration by the Turks during the occupation, and the lives and property of the inhabitants, both Moslem and Christian, were respected, although heavy requisi tions were levied on the city. The Christian population in the Urumieh region suffered a worse fate. Some six thousand of these unfortunate people had not joined in the exodus; it was estimated, after the Turkish evacuation, that only two thousand survived ; and the atrocities and crimes committed by the Turks had reduced these survivors to the direst poverty and misery. The Turks and Kurds entered Urumieh on July 31st, and the horrors committed by them are described in moving terms by the French and American mis- sonaries, who tried in vain to shelter the terror stricken Chris tians. Monseigneur Sontag and another priest of the French Catho’ic Mission were murdered that day. During July and August the Turks prepared for a further advance,'and extended their outposts from Urumieh towards Sauj Bulagh and Sakkiz, and from Tabriz to Ardabil andMIaneh where they came into contact with 1 British outposts. On the British side, General Dunsterville had been preparing since the middle of May, for an advance to Enzall in order to be able to help Baku when wanted, and also to release Colonel Bicherakoff, who was becoming impatient to move his volunteer force into the Caucasus. Bicherakoff’s command moved forward in June, supported by British nd Indian troops. It was expected that the Jang lis, estimated at 3000, would offer resistance; but the positions they had prepared at Manjil were * See pages 46“'7. 1 See Sketch of history of Khamseh in para. 5 below, pages 8o-88.carried without difficulty and little further opposition was encoun tered ; and Rasht was occupied on 'June 14th. Kuchik Khan withdrew to Kasnra, whilst Bicherakoif and his volunteers embarked at Enzali, and Dunsterville arranged transport for a small force to help our friends in Baku. But the Jangalis had only been waiting their opportunity ; on July 20th they made a sudden attack on Rasht, and it needed several weeks of severe punitive operations before Kuchik Khan was willing to seek terms. An agreement was drawn up by which the Jangalis undertook to furnish supplies to the British troops, not to have armed bands on the Enzall- Kazvin road, and to send away all enemy officers ; whilst the British commander agreed not to interfere in Persian affairs so long as Persia gave no assistance to the enemies of Britain, nor to interfere in the politics of the Jangalis so long as these should not forward the interests of the enemies of Great Britain. • Some days before the agreement was signed, General Dunster- ville and his expeditionary force had embarked at Enzali, on August 14th, for Baku. To round off this description of the position of affairs in state of Persis, Persia at the time of the fall of the Cabinet of Samsam-us-Sul- July 1918 * taneh, it may be noted that the main trade routes in the central • provinces of Isfahan and Yazd were infested by robber bands, so strong that they defied the Government; that Luristan and other border provinces were in an unruly state; that tbe prices of all cotomodities were everywhere abnormally high, despite the excellent harvest in all parts of the country; and that the outgoing Cabinet according to Persian custom, had left the treasury in debt, and the finances of the country in disorder.' Also the aspect of foreign affairs had altered. Great Britain had accepted the military responsibilities in Persia of her former ally, Russia, in opposing the Turks. The allies had not only held on the western front in Europe, they were now taking the offensive. British influence was consequently predominant in Tehran, and Sir P. Z Cox vas appointed Bri ish Minister with the object of utilising this favoura le occasion to effect a rapprochement bet veen the two roun ries. Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, who had always been pro-ally, readily Cabinet of accepted office on August 5th, and in ten days’ time formed a Seh^Augurt Cabinet, of which the more important members were Mushavir- 1918 . improved ul-Mamklik, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Prince Nusrat-ud- ^£j a ® rs,an Dauleh (eldest son of Farman Farma), Minister of Justice. In the end of the year the Cabinet was strengthened by the intro*56 duction of Sipahdar-i-A’zam, as Minister of War, and of Akbar MIrza, Sarim-ud-Dauleh (a son of the Zil-us-Sultan) as Minister of Finance. The most pressing question was that of finance, but necessary funds were readily advanced by Great Britain on receiving assurances that the new Government would adopt a friendly policy. Friendly relations were soon tested by the kidnapping of Obeidullah Effendi, who had been for a time an active Turkish emissary in East Persia, but had latterly resided at Tehran He was whisked off to Kazvin, and far on the way to Baghdad before he was missed in Tehran. The affront to neutral Persia was smoothed by his acceptance of facilities to c ontinue his journey to Constantinople. The stability of the Cabinet was more seriously tried in September, when it was reported that the Turks had commenced an advance from Tabriz through Sa kiz and Mlaneh, 1 and that they had taken Baku. It was known that the British line from Hamadan to Rasht was only lightly held, and much anxiety was felt in Tehran lest they should have to concentrate in Hamadan and leave the road to the capital open to the Turks. But as previously in the summer of 1916 after General Baratoff’s retreat from Khaniqxn to Aveh, the Turks did not advance, and a little later it was known that their power had been definitely shattered in Palestine. The further victorious progress of the Allies, ending in the armistice, assured the position of the Persian Cabinet. Indeed there was no other policy possible than that of friendly dependence on Great Britain, the only Pow-er to whom the Government could turn, at that time, for the help necessary to restore order in the distracted country. Before describing the various measures taken by the Cabinet to restore order in the provinces, it may be noted that a very severe epidemic of influenza swept over the country in October and November. It is said to have decimated the population; in many villages there were not survivors enough to work the usual area of cultivation. The Government were put more at ease in regard to finance by an arrangement made in October, whereby Persia was assured of a monthly advance of tumans 350,000 from Great Britain, for as long as the two governments should mutually consider this assistance necessary. See Sketch of history of Khamseh in para. 5 below.The revolt in the South required the early attention of the Brents in the '* new Cabinet. The Indian Government had collected a force at P r ^ , X.| nc ®® dTirlEg Bushire for relief of the Shiraz garrison. The Cabinet now DauleVs ' accepted the friendly co-operation of this British column in the Cabilie t&lt; work of opening up the Bushire-Shiraz trade route, and of restoring order in Bars, with a view to terminating, as soon as possible, the need to retain Indian troops there in support of the South Persia Rifles. The command of the South Persia Rifles had already been In Bars, separated, in the end of June, from that of the Indian troops in Pars, and the officers and men of the Pars brigade, suspected of disaffection had been gradually weeded out, and it was now recognised as a Persian force, working under the instructions of the Governor General. The British and Indian Governments, however, continued to pay the cost of maintaining this force. General Douglas was in command of the Bushire column. A light railway was constructed to Borasjun, and operations commenced in the end of October. The column advanced slowly, as the object gimed at was to restore order with as little use of violence as possible. One or two chiefs of the Bushire • hinterland joined with Zair Khiddar in refusing to make submis sion, and had to be driven out of their strongholds, but by the time the column had established communication with Shiraz the revolt was broken; and, on May 3rd, Saulat-ud-Dauleh, who had held out against the attacks of the new Ilkhanl and the South Persia Rifles, surrendered to the Persian Government, and gave security for his future good behaviour. Wassmuss and his companion, Oertel, had fled from Ahram during these operations, and were arrested at Qum, handed over to the British military authorities at Kazvin whence they escaped back to Tehran, but were finally evacuated via Baku to Germany in the end of May. The British Indian troops were gradually withdrawn during the summer and autumn. But two truculent chiefs of the Bushire hinterland, Zair Khiddar and Shaikh Husain, were still recalcitrant, and it was decided that complete evacuation must be deferrred until the South Persia Rifles should be strong enough to maintain order on the Bushire-Shiraz route. The British Indian troops were ultimately withdrawn from Shiraz on March 21st, 1920. Another pressing question was suppression of brigandage in the central provinces of Isfahan and Yazd. The robber bands of Riza Juzdani and Ja’far Quli levied blackmail on the trade58 In Kah&amp;n. In Cffl&amp;n. , 1,0 outskirts of Isfahan.

It was also considered that the agreement was a local arrangement between the parties in course of the war, and could not be indefinitely continued by His Majesty’s Government with a Persian subject in open rebellion against his Government. The Jangalls were notified on March 24th of the abrogation of the agreement, and were informed that unless they returned to their allegiance they would lose the sympathy of the British Government Kuchik Khan was offered, as an alternative, asylum, under British pro tection, in Mesopotamia. These conditions were accepted by HajI Ahmad, a Jangali Leader, who surrendered with 500 rifles, but not by Kuchik Khan, and the town of Rasht was occupied by British troops on March 29th. In the course of the next few weeks the Jangalis were broken up by the Cossacks into scattered bands of fugitives. Doctor Hashmat, a noted leader, was captured and executed. But Kuchik Khan escaped, and remained in hiding for some months, when he was able gradually to collect a new band and regain much of his former influence in the province—for the Persian Government failed to grant fair relief to the down trodden peasantry, who were saddled not only with the old exactions but also with an ill-disciplined and rapacious Cossack garrison. East Persia enjoyed a period of comparative tranquillity Ia Easfc Persia ' during the autumn of 1918, as the forces of General Malleson protected the frontiers, whilst operating in Transcaspia in support of the provisional government formed at Ashkabad. Merv was occupied by British troops on November 9th; but toward the end of the year the enemy pressure became much stronger, and they were gradually withdrawn to the Persian frontier to guard Khorasan against the constantly increasing Bolshevik menace. During the first half of 1919 there was some anxiety least the presence of General Malleson’s force should involve Persia in the Afghan war with British India; but nothing more serious occurred than more frequent tribal raids than usual into Kainat and Sistan, where the Sistan levies did well against the marauders. The Persian Government had been warned, from time to time, that General Malleson could not be retained indefinitely in Khorasan, and, in the spring of 1920 they were informed that the force would be withdrawn in the early* autumn. * The withdrawal was postponed until the spring of 1921.60 In Azarbaljan. Passing mention may be made here of the latest of the many Escapades of Salar-ud-Dauleh, uncle of the Shah, who, towards the end of the war, had formed a project to enter Persia through Transcaspia, and raise a revolt in the Astarabad district. He tried to put this belated plan into execution late in December 1918, but was caught by a British detachment^ before crossing the Persian frontier, and was sent via Kazvin to Baghdad where he was interned till the following autumn, when he was allowed to retire to Switzerland. Lastly, the affairs of Azarbaijan required the careful atten tion of the Government. Military evacuation of that province by the Turks was completed by the end of November 1918, and the Acting Governor worked hard to restore order with the slender means at his disposal; but it was felt that an official of high rank was needed to cope with the difficult situation. Sipah Salar-i-A’zam was selected for the post of Governor Genera.-, toward the end of the year, but he accepted with reluctance, and so delayed his journey that he did not reach Tabriz until the end of April 1919. He resigned in September, and was succeeded, after another long delay, by 2 ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, who was equally unsuccessful and retired from the province. The situation was, indeed, very difficult. The alternate Russian and Turkish occupations during the war had . thoroughly disorganized the civil administration of the province, which had suffered severely, moreover, from the famine in the previous spring. There were still many Turkish emissaries in the dis trict, working amongst a population—although mostly of the 3 Shi’ite sect—more nearly related, by race and tongue, to the Turk than to the Persian; and Tabriz had long been a centre of agitation for reform, And the security of the frontiers was endangered by the quarrels of undisciplined races striving to carve independent states out of the wreck of the Turkish Empire. It is nor surprising, therefore, that there was a strong separatist party in Tabriz, at the end of the war, inclined to pan- Islamism, but uncertain whether it wanted autonomy oi union with the new Republican Government of Azarbaijan at Baku. The majority, however, remained loyal to Persia, and 4 resistance 1 See para. 3 above, pages 29-33. , 2 Recollections of the siege of their city by the Royalist army under Aumm H iuleh in 1908-9 were not likely to render him a persona grata vnm the iaprizis.

A side issue, which excited some interest for a time, was the case of Herr Wustrow the German Consul, who had refused to leave with his Turkish colleague after the Turkish military evac uation. He barricaded himself in his Consulate (containing a store of munitions), to avoid removal by force, and threatened when a couple of British platoons were brought, in April, from Tiflis, to blow up his consulate rather than be taken. He was permitted to remain under surveillance, which saved, possibly, the surrounding properties, as he committed suicide a year later. It was certainly difficult to rule such a province without an adequate force at disposal of the Governor General; and he had no disciphned troops save a detachment of Persian Cossacks —barely enough to keep the city of Tabriz in order. The most troublesome insurgents were the Shahsavan tribes, who have raided far and wide, unchecked up to the present time. The Kurds, headed by Simko (Isma’il Agha of Chari), sought to make themselves masters of the Urumieh region. In May 1919 an attempt on the life of Simko led to a fray, in which the Kurds were driven from the town of Urumieh by the local governor, whose Muhammadan followers then got out of hand, attacked the premises of the American Presbyterian Mission and massacred two hundred Christian refugees. A month later 600 people, the remnant of the once flourishing Christian com munity of that region, were transferred to Tabriz. Towards the end of the year a force of Cossacks under Colonel Philipoff was sent to check renewed aggression on the part of Simko. The long struggle between Tartars and Armenians for dominance in the Erivan and Nakhichivan plains was also a danger to Persia. At one time, indeed, the Persian Govern ment was tempted to intervene in order to annex the Nakhi- chivan district. ‘ The more recent arrival of Bolshevik forces in these regions has created a new menace on the Azarbaijan borders. Whilst pressing forward these executive measures for the better control of the provinces, the Ministry was also engaged In important political and social questions. The most urgent question in foreign politics, at the end of the war, was to secure direct representation at the Peace Con ference on the ground that the war had been carried into Persian territory. These pretensions, however, to a seat at the Confer ence were not admitted, and the Government thereon decided Persian repre sentative ex cluded from Peace Confer* ence.62 Events leading up to Anglo- Persian Agree ment, 1919. to send a Mission, composed of Mushavir-ul-Mamalik and tlire® other delegates, to Europe, to attend on the Conference. In the autumn of 1919, Mushavir-ul-Mamalik was replaced by Nusrat- ud-Dauleh as head of this Mission and as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The main contentions of Persia were that reparation is due for losses sustained by the State, and by individuals, through violation of Persian territory by Russia, and other neighbouring States, in the course of the war; and that rectification of her Russian and Turkish frontiers—in Transcaspia, Caucasus and Kurdistan-should be granted. Persia has not obtained any satisfaction from the Peace Conference in these matters, but she has been admitted to- membership of the League of Nations. In the sphere of domestic politics the Ministry had to prepare for election of delegates to the new Majlis which it had promised' to call. An intrigue to secure the appointment of a Royal Prince as Governor General of Khorasan in place of Quvvam-us-Sultaneh brought the Ministry into collision with the Shah and the Court party, in the end of 1918. Under the old regime, the Shah was the real and responsible head of the Government, and the ultimate decision regarding appointment of governors and other high functionaries rightly lay with him ; but, under the Consti tution, the Cabinet became directly responsible for affairs, and had need to select its own servants. The Shah was most unwill ing to abandon so important—and lucrative—a patronage, but ultimately conceded the principle involved. The war had produced a marked change in Persia’s foreign relations. The Russian menace was at an end, or was relegated to an uncertain future. Turkey and Germany were crippled, and Great Britain was the only Power in a position to give the immediate material help—military, financial, economic—so urgently needed to restore the authority of the Government, the stability of the finances, and the commercial and industrial life of the country. The country was in a chastened mood, a little nervous, perhaps, of British resentment of its conduct during the war, but on the whole confident and hopeful of efficient help in reform of abuses and in development of the national resources. And the leaders of the previous Cabinets were still somewhat dis credited with the people and were known to have forfeited the confidence of the British Government. Thus the Cabinet of Yusuq-ud-Dauleh was in a favourable situation to undertake the measures to reform needed by thecountry and which Great Britain considered she had a right to ask the’country to make in order to become a possible neig - hour to live with, and to be helped. The Ministry willingly entered into discussion of such matters with tie S Minister, but showed no dispositron to c^nnt itself to definite action. Nor was it m any hurry assembly of the new Majlis; on the contrary the elections were dragged out indefinitely, under one pretext or another. Bv the summer of 1919. however, outcry against the corrupt administration of publio revenues had criticism of the action of the Government m contracting larg foreign debts, for which it could show no permanent resm , had become so persistent that the Cabinet became a^arm^, and hastened to conclude an agreement with Great B the introduction of important refoims. The agreement was signed on August 9th, 1919. Its provi- ^ r f e 0 m ^® r t ® iRm sions were— August 1919, 1. An undertaking by Great Britain to respect the inde pendence and integrity of Persia. 2. Great Britain will supply expert advisers for the several departments of the Persian administration; and these advisers will be endowed with adequate powers, to be agreed between them and the Persian Government. 3 The British Government will supply, at cost of the Persian Government, such officers, munitions and equipment as a military commission of Persian and British experts, to be assembled forthwith, may juc ge necessary for the needs of a uniform force, which Persia proposes to create. 4 Great Britain undertakes to provide, or arrange, a substantial loan for the purpose of financing the reforms indicated in clauses 1 and 2. 5 Great Britain will co-operate with Persia in encouraging Anglo-Persian enterprises for improvement of com munications in Persia by railways, etc. 6. The two Governments agree to appoint a joint committee to revise the Customs tariff of Persia. In connection with the fourth clause a supplementary a^ee- ment provided for a British loan to Persia of £2,000 000 at 7 per cent., repayable in 20 years by equal monthly instalments,64 and secured on the Southern Customs revenues, and all other Customs receipts in so far as these are, or shall be, at disposal of the Persian Government—the loan to be available to the Persian Government as required, after the British Financial Adviser shall have taken up his duties at Tehran. On the same date assurance was given, by letter, of the will ingness of the British Government to co-operate with the Persian Government for realization, when practicable, of — 1. Revision of treaties actually in force. 2. Persia’s claims for compensation for material damage suffered at the hands of other belligerants. 3. Justifiable rectifications of Persian frontiers. The second of these desiderata was rendered more explicit by a further letter establishing that Britain will not claim from Persia the cost of maintenance of the British troops which had been sent to Persia, nor will the Persian Government claim any idemnity for damage caused by these troops—but these stipula tions do not affect claims of individuals and private institutions. Within a few days of the conclusion of these important ne gotiations, the Shah hastened his departure for a visit to Europe, on which he had long been bent, in order to be able to pass through the Caucasus before the British evacuation of Baku. All arrangements had been made for the journey, and the Valiahd had been called from Tabriz to represent His Majesty in the interval. The Shah, who was attended by his uncle, Nusrat- us-Sultaneh, and by his cousin, Nusrat-ud-Dauleh (then Minister for Foreign Affairs), and by a small retinue, left Enzali on August 15th, and proceeded via Baku and Batum to Constanti nople ; where he met his father, the ex-Shah Muhammad Ali, who had retired to that city, in July, when Odessa was threatened by the Bolsheviks. His Majesty then proceeded to France, where he spent the greater part of his leisure. He spent a few days in England, after an official visit to the King, in October. Meantime the Anglo-Persian agreement of August 9th had been published, and had met with much criticism* abroad, but with a fair reception in Persia. The Ministry, however, received information, early in September, of a plot to agitate against it, and promptly seized the leaders of the movement—Muhtashim- us-Sultaneh, Mustashar-ud-Dauleh, Munltaz-ud-Dauleh, Mumtaz- ul-Mulk, and Mu’in-ut-Tujjar—and incarcerated them at _ Kashan. There was no further overt opposition in the country to the agreement. * in America and France. The French Minister in Tehran did not hesitate to intrigue against it.The Military Commission to be assembled in terms of clause ^g^-.^ erai * a three of the Agreement began its labours in January, and after commission, three months’ work presented its report—on which the Persian 1920, Government failed to take any action. British officers were afterwards appointed to the Central Brigade, but a few weeks subsequently in July their withdrawal was demanded by Mushir- ud-Dauleh, as a condition of his forming a Cabinet after the fall of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, pending ratification of the Anglo-Persian Agreement by the Majlis to render it valid according to the constitution. A little later the joint commission for revision of the Customs Anglo-Persian tariff was appointed, as provided in the sixth clause of the agreement. Two Customs conventions, of identical tenor, had hitherto prevailed in Persia—-the Russo-Persian Convention of 1903, and the Anglo-Persian Convention of 1904. The former is within the scope of the decree of 4th Asad (July 27th, 1918) issued by the Cabinet of Samsam-us-Sultaneh. The Commission revised the convention of 1904, and its recommendations were adopted by the British and Persian Governments. The revised tariff came into operation on April 2nd, 1920. This revision increased the duties on most articles ; reduced the duty on tea ; levelled up the duty on articles of special interest to Russian trade which had been too lightly taxed under the old tariff; imposed an exceptionally heavy duty on sugar ; and was designed, to produce, in a normal year, a revenue more than double the highest revenue obtained before the war. The Government also appointed Mr. S. A. Armitage Smith, Financial C.B., as their Financial Adviser,with powers to reorganize the Adviser, financial services. He arrived in Tehran, with a small number , of assistants, in May. They, however, like the officers in the Central Brigade, retired in July. After the British military evacuation of Baku in August p ers ian Mission 1919, a number of Armenians and others took refuge in Enzall. j° e p®^ ai ^ an Several matters of difference between the Governments of Persia and (Caucasian) Azarbaijan—rectifications of frontier, trade and transit regulations, etc.—proved difficult of adjustment. The Persian Government, who had recognised the Republic and received its representative, sent Saiyid Zia-ud-Din on a mission to Baku, in December, to negotiate on these matters, but he did not meet with much success. The failure of Denikin’s effort in South Russia raised the Caspian fleet, question of disposal of the volunteer fleet on the Caspian. The Persian Government would willingly have bought some of these vessels, but the suggestion was not carried out. In the month of February 1920, the fleet appeared off Enzall, seeking refuge.66 Bolshevik occu pation of Gilafl Fall of Yusuq ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet.

(Numbers in brackets after names refer to that chapter.)68 1909i 1910 . The year 1909 was more eventful. On the adoption of Sipah Salar as their leader by the Rasht revolutionaries, and their threat against Muhammad Ali Shah, Amir Mu’aiyid and his sons, who were in Tehran, received 300 rifles and ammunition from the Shah and left for Mazandaran in order to organize their “ fauj ” to threaten Sipah Salar’s estates in Tunakabun in the hope of distracting his attention from Tehran. They collected a following of about 500 Savad Kuhis and went as far as Amol, where, however, Amir Mukarram refused to join them and persuaded them to abandon the enterprise. A counter move ment on the part of the landowners of Nur, at the inspiration of Sipah Salar, to go to the assistance of his eldest son Amir Asad (No. 56) in Tunakabun was similarly abandoned. No disorders had resulted from these intrigues and prepara tions, but the influx of arms and the spirit of unrest engendered in the province gave birth to future troubles. After the capture of Tehran by the Constitutionalists and the abdication of Muhammad Ali Shah in 1909, Amir Mukarram and a party of 80 sowars hastened to Tehran to join the Cons titutionalist leader Sipah Salar, who had become Prime Minister. They were followed some months later by Amir Mu’aiyid, who now posed as a “ Constitutionalist,” in obedience to a sum mons to hand over the rifles which he had received from the ex-Shah. Sipah Salar, howeve, rbore him a grudge on account of his preparations to invade Tunakabun a few months previously, the Government pressed their demands too far for Amir Mu’aiyid’s liking with the result that he quitted Tehran in disgust and returned to Mazandaran, where, soon after, he received news oi the abolition by the Majlis of “tuyul,” or feudal tenure of land in return for military service, and was ordered to give up the crown lands (khaliseh) which he held as commander of the “ fauj ” of Savad Kuh. He was joined by Rashid-us-Sultan, Chief of the Usanlu of Khar and Varamin, who had retired with 200 men before the Bakhtiaris, and by Amir Mukarram, whose creditors had been making things unpleasant for him in Tehran, These three leaders become rebels, occupied the Imamzadeh Hashim pass on the principal route from Tehran to Mazandaran (see Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz Routes No. 2) and raided as far as Damavand and Khar. Amir Mu’aiyid meanwhile went to Barfarush, and parleyed with the Governor of Mazandaran, 1 Nizam-us-Sultan, finally kidnapped him to Savad Kuh and ignominiously expelled him from Mazandaran. 1 Subsequent title Nizam-ud-Dauleh (No. 50).Meanwhile the Government had despatched 1 Amir A’zam with a force of about 4,000 men against the rebels. He defeated and drove Am ir Mukarram down the Haraz valley towards Amol, but stopped to loot his property at Ask and gave time to Am ir Mu’aiyid to come to his rescue from Savad Kuh, where he had been disposing of Nizam-us-Sultan. They fortified a defile near Aliabad, about 35 miles South of Amol on the Larijan road, and surprised Amir A’zam who retired back up the valley where he was followed and again attacked. The result was indecisive and the rebel force began to scatter over the Larijan hills, but Amir A’zam failed to realize their discomfiture, his force broke up in disorder and he returned to Tehran (Sept. Sept. 1910. 1910). After the retreat of Amir A’zam, Amir Mu’aiyid formed an assembly of Mazandaran notables and Ulama at Barfarusfi, of which Amir Mukarram was the figure head, but Amir Mu’aiyid the leading spirit. They opened negotiations with Sipah Salar, then Minister of War, through the medium of his eldest son Amir Asad, but the negotiations proved abortive and Zahir- ud-Dauleh, who was sent from Tehran as Governor of Mazan daran, was obliged soon after his arrival to leave the province. A quarrel followed between Amir Mu’aiyid and 2 Sardar Jalil, and the former with his sons brought a force as far as Takht-i-Rustam 8 miles East of Sari, while the latter occupied a position at Naranji Bagh, where the Sari-Ashraf road crosses the river Nikah. The Tehran Government were opposed to Amir Mu’aiyid as a rebel and ordered Zafar-us-Sultaneh (No. 35) Governor of Astarabad to assist the Sardar. Zafar-us-Sultaneh 1911. complied but was suborned by Amir Mu’aiyid to go over to his side, reconciled the Amir with the Government and secured his own appointment as Governor of Mazandaran, whereupon Sardar Jalil retired to Tehran in disgust and obtained Zafar-us- Sultaneh’s recall. Such was the disturbed estate of affairs in Mazandaran when Muhammad Ali, the ex-Shah, who was supposed to be in Russia, arrived from Ghumish Tappeh at Astarabad on 26th July 1911 in his attempt to regain the throne and was invited by Amir Mu’aiyid and Amir Mukarram to Mazandaran. A plan of campaign was drawn up at Barfarush for a triple advance on Tehran. Amir Mukarram with the “ fauj ” of Larijan (about 800), of Bandipe (about 800), I’zam-ul-Mulk with the sowars of the Abdul Maliki tribe (about 100) and Turkomans proceeded to Larijan, (i.e., Elburz route No. 2 of Chaptei X para, (c)), 1 Amir A’zam is a nephew of ’Ain-ud-Dauleh (No. 6). 2 Sardar Jalll’s title at that time was Salar Mukarram.70 the ex-Shah with Amir Mu’aiyid, Rashid-us-Sultan and Turko mans, amounting to about 2,500 men in all, went to Savad Kuk (i.e., Elburz route No. 1 of Chapter X para, (c) ), while Arshad- ud-Dauleh had already started from Astarabad with a force of 2,000 Turkomans for Shahrud on the Meshed-Tehran road. The menace to Tehran was a serious one as these 3 forces greatly outnumbered any force available for its defence and had the Royalists shown more initiative and vigour they would have reached their objective. *Sipah Salar, the Premier, had become alienated from the Constitutionalists and took no action, and the heart and soul of the opposition to Muhammad Ali was Yeprim who despatched about 1,200 men under Sardar Muhi (No. 76) to check the Royalists’ advance from Larijan and Savad Kuh. Sardar Muhi placed a small guard on the Imam- zadeh Hashim ridge between Damavand and Larijan (route No. 2 above) and went on with the greater part of his force to occupy the Dalichai ravine between Saiyidabad and Aminabad (stage 4 of Elburz route No. 1), where he was attacked by Rashid-us-Sultan and the Royalist advance guard from Savad Kuh. Rashid-us-Sultan was defeated and killed on 11th August and Sardar Muhi advanced to Firuzkuh where he kept up sporadic hostilities with the Royalists on the Firuzkuh pass. Yeprim meanwhile got together a force of 1,200, which, with Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari, he led to the Varamin district where they outmanoeuvred and defeated the numerically stronger Royalist force from Shahrud at Imamzadeh Ja’far, 40 miles from Tehran. Arshad-ud-Dauleh, its leader was captured and executed. The Royalists in Larijan and Savad Kuh turned and fled back to Mazandaran without waiting to be attacked and the ex-Shah decamped to Astarabad and Ghumish Tappeh. The first party of Government troops to arrive in Mazanda ran in pursuit of them has been nicknamed the 4 Urdu-i-Barg 5 (the “lightning force”) and consisted of a motley collection of about 4,000 “ Mujahidin,” Armenians and others, under the leadership of Zohrab, an Ar menian, with Salar Fatih (No. 61) as second in command. They travelled via Nur and Kujur to Am5l, Barfarush and Sari and the name of the 4 Urdu-i- Barg ' is still a by-word in those regions for rapacity. At Sari it was joined and dismissed by Sardar Muhi who had advanced from Firuzkuh via Savad Kuh (route No. I). Sardar Muhi dallied in Mazandaran, whence some Bakhtiaris were diverted from his force to go against Salar-ud-Dauleh in c T1 ! e government was dependent on Bathtiarl support. Samsam-us Sultanen, Bakhtiari succeeded Sipah Salar as Premier and 3,000 Bakhtiaris were summoned to Tehran.&gt;Ir»a and Muhammad AK had time to return and reorganize his rabble at Astarabad. When Sardar Muhi advanced he was completely defeated ^ea^Bamiajvi-G^^o^October^lOth^fled Muhtiyid and hastened to Damavand being escorted by the sons f SrMu’aivid who collected on the way as many arms as possible from the refugees. By his agreement with Sardar Muhi, bv which the latter was permitted to leave Mazandaran, Amir Mu’aiyid appeared as a self seeking opportunist and not as_ a_ i f u “-Rova,list ” The ex-Shah rejoined him at San Lt St'aiyl s y otwithdrcwto Saved Kuh The Mazanda- ra^ were disgusted at the looting perpetrated by the ex-Shah s Turkoman auxiliaries, and seem to have regarded his cause as lost Muhammad AH shortly afterwards retired to Russia. The Mazandaran leaders alarmed at the course of events and fearing retribution went to Tehran, where Sardar Jahl and Amir Mu’aiyid were reconciled. Samsam-us-Sultaneh Bakhtian wS Premier and to spite Sipah Salar, an inveterate enemy of Imir M^aiyid since 1909, gave Isma’il Khan (whose previous title was Amur Tuman) the title of Amir Mu’aiyid, a present of 3oi r fles ^d command of the “ Army of Mazandaran (Qushun- i Mazandaran), and at Amir Mu’aiyid’s instigation re-appomted Zafar-us-Sultaneh as Governor. During disturbances which followed the Russians intervened and sent Cossacks from A^ aiyi - bad as far as Sari against Amir Mu aiyid who retired to the fastnesseSiPf ^vadKidi. ^ R^-ud-Dauleh was 1913-4.

Bukn-ud-Dauleh had been succeeded as Governor by the weak and incompetent Itizad-us- Sultaneh elder half-brother of the Shah, who was the corrupt and unpopularhly of Sardar Jalil, and Amir Mu’aiyid in defiance of the small Russian garrison still left at Barfarush, occupied72 the district of Shlrgah, where the Talar leaves the foothills South of that town. In 1917, 3 Governors, Mu’tamad-ud-Dauleh, Zahir-ud-Dauleh and AzId-us-Sultan, followed each other in quick succession, all equally useless and inacceptable either to Amir Mu’aiyid or to Sardar Jalil, both of whom were busy the while in consolidat ing their position in their respective spheres of Mazandaran. At this time the Jangall Ittihad-i-Islam was becoming pro minent in Gilan. The link between the Mazandaranis and the Jangalis was Salar Fatih (No. 61) of Kujur, who in February 1918 looted Sipah Salar s properties around Khurramabad. Sahm-ul-Mamalik, eldest son of Amir Mu’aiyid, with a party of Savad Ivuhls participated in the foray and its success kindled Amir Mu’aiyid’s restless ambition. He went' to Sari and conciliated Sardar Jail], and they jointly warned Azid-us- Sultan, the Governor of Mazandaran, who was at Mashad-i-Sar, that he must leave the province. An Ittihad-i-^abhristan was formed of all the chiefs of Mazandaran, which informed the Tehran Government that it intended to nominate its own officials for Mazandaran, and proceeded to appoint Sardar Jalil as Governor. Money was raised by forced subscriptions from the merchants of Barfarush in return for receipts signed by Amir Mu’aiyid, Sardar Jalil and Sardar Rafi and they began to prepare assistance for the Jangalis. Their preparations however were cut short by news of the Jangali defeat at Manjxl by Bicherakofi and Dunsterforce in June 1918, and by internal dissensions within the Ittihad-i-Tabaristan, which was in fact a ‘‘one man” organization improvised and dominated by Amir Mu’aiyid. Unlike the Ittihad-i-Islam of the Jangal, where Kuchik Khan robbed the landlord to pay the peasant, it was in no sense a socialistic society but an unholy alliance of the great landlords to rivet their power on the province in defiance of the Persian Government. To the peasantry, ground down under their exactions, it could only bring additional misfortune. It was, moreover, weak and divided and, after the summer exodus from the plain of Mazandaran to the hills, Sardar Jain, who had never entered into the spirit of it, and had again quarrelled with Amir Mu’aiyid, invited the Tehran Govern ment to send a Governor, and his former partisan Itizad-us- Sultaneh arrived in Mazandaran in the autumn. He ineffec tually professed impartiality between the opposing parties until the Amir and Sardar threw off the mask, commenced hostile preparations and divided the province into 2 armed camps. 1 1 Tabaristan is the ancient name for Mazandaran.73 foothills §®: iMr-ud-Dailf: succession, il : Mu’aiyilc in consolt Mazandai ecoming p&gt; ranis and ft in Feta® [hurramatt th a party s’ ccess kinlfi to Sari an: led izid-if fashad-i-Sat ^Tabarisi ifonned th te its on inf Sards bscriptiow its signed iiey began epaiatioivs iatManjil )y internal h was ft Bimated hy ihe Janga 1 ’ he peas^ r alliance d eindefia®' round dofl 1 l misfortii® the sun® f ; SardarJaR 1 had af an Go** n Itizad-fr He ii#; aarties need ied Sardar Jalll collected about 1 900 men from Eastern Mazandaran and remained on the defensive in the neighbourhood of Sari, while Amir Mu’aiyid brought about 2 500 men to Shirgah, Aliabad, and Gatab within about 8 miles of Barfarush, until the spring of J919 when he moved East to Sari. Zahir-ul-Mulk was then sent by the Premier, Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, on a special mission to mediate between them and restore order in Ma^anda- ran and soon superseded I’tizad-us-Sultaneh as Governor. A period of negotiation' followed until on the approach of a detachment of Cossacks from Gilan via Tunakabun and Kujur, Zahir-ul-Mulk was strong enough to arrest in Ambl the Amir Mukarram, who had defied his authority, and send him to Tehran. Amir Mu’aiyid remonstrated, but alarmed at the approach of the Cossacks he returned to Savad Kuh and after wards agreed to go to Tehran, whence he was banished to Kirman- shah. Sardar Jalii and the other chiefs were soon afterwards disarmed in Sari and expelled to Tehran. The province of Mazandaran was thus after several years of turbulence brought under the authority of the Government. Saifullah Khan and Asadullah Khan, the two younger sons of Amir Mu’aiyid, however, with a small band of outlaws, took to the hills of Savad Kuh, where their local knowledge and the support of the inhabi tants enabled them to frustrate attempts made by the Gendar merie to capture them. The financial policy initiated by the Government in Mazan daran aroused great opposition, this band became the focus for malcontents, and by the summer of 1920 the movement had developed into a formidable rebellion. Mahal-i-Salas (TunaJcdbun, Kalaristaq and Kujur.) Tunakabun formed part of Gilan until the latter part of the 18th Century when Agha Muhammad Khan, Kajar made a grant of lands and of the Governorship of Tunakabun to Mehdi Khan, the ancestor of the present Vali Khan, Sipah Salar. The descendants of Mehdi Khan retained the Governor ship and acquired land and power. Kalaristaq, and more recently Kujur, were joined to Tunakabun and formed a small province * • 1 His own Kulbadls were in the majority. Sardar Rafi, Maaud-nl-Mulk and Salar Afkhain, the landowners of Hazar Jarib and Isma’il Khan Isfandinr of the Kurd-u-Turk tribe also supported him. 2 Mostly Savad Kuhis, also Hujabr-ud-Dauleh of the Abdul Maliki tribe with 100 sowars and It’imad-i-Nizam and Iqtidar-i-Nizam of the Kurd-u-Turk. Amir Mukarram remained neutral. • S’74 called * 1 Malial-i-Salas, “ the triple canton,” furnishing a nominal account of the revenue to Mazandaran but otherwise indepen dent. The history of this province during recent years is a story of the feuds and jealousies within the ruling family of Sipah Salar who has himself long been absent from it and appointed a Governor from among his sons or other relations, and of rebellion caused by their intrigues and rapacity. The Governorship has usually been held by his eldest son Amir Asad, who thereby incurred the bitter jealousy of his brother Sardar Iqtidar. Some disturbances occurred during the Persian revolution in 1907, when Sardar Iqtidar posed as a “ Constitutionalist ” and with the aid of the inhabitants expelled the Amir. The Governorship changed hands several times until 1909, when Sipah Salar, who by becoming “Constitutionalist” leader had enhanced his prestige and strengthened his hold over his estates, re-instated Amir Asad. In 1912 a skirmish occurred between the Tunakabunis and a party of followers of the rebel prince 2 Salar-ud-Dauleh on their route from Astarabad to Gilan in which the latter were worsted. In 1914 a petition was made to Sipah Salar in Tehran against the misgovernment and the misdeeds of his sons, especially of Amir Asad. The petitioners, mostly people of Kujur and Kalaristaq and several of them ex-employes of Sipah Salar, were dissatisfied with his reply and on their return to Mahal-i- Salas they began to work against him and frightened Amir Asad out of the province. A party of 100 Russian Cossacks, sent at Sipah Salar’s request from Rasht to Tunakabun with Sardar Iqtidar, were drawn into a quarrel between Sardar Iqtidar and Akram-ul-Mulk, son of Amir Asad, and passed on to Mazandaran without setting the province in order. In 1916 Sipah Salar used his position as Prime Minister to send a Persian force from Tehran. The malcontents were dispersed, some surrendered and others including Salar Fatih, and the brothers Shuja’-i-Nizam (Karim Khan), Rabi Khan (alias Ghahraman), Ja’far Khan and Taqi Khan, who had made themselves chiefs of the Kujur section of the Khwajahvand tribe (see Chapter VIII) went to Tehran. These brothers took “ bast ” in the house of Sipah Salar but he retaliated by arresting and imprisoning them, and Ja’far Khan was executed. 1 It is, however, frequently called “ Tunakabun.” 1 See para. 3 ahoye, page 32.After the fall of Sipah Salar’s Cabinet they were released and returned to their country, where they took revenge by expelling Sipah Salar’s agents from Kujur, Kalardasht and Kalaristaq. Amir Asad was Governor of Tunakabun and Sardar Iqtidar, out of jealousy, joined the rebel Kujuris. In February 1918, after some skirmishing with Akram-ul-Mulk at the mouth of the Chalus river, they advanced to Khurrama- bad, the seat of Government of Tunakabun, did a good deal of looting, and made Sardar Iqtidar nominal Governor. Meanwhile Amir Asad had taken refuge with the Jangalis, then at the height of their power, and as a result of their inter vention the Kujuris withdrew from Tunakabun, and a Jangall Governor was sent with deputies in Kalaristaq and Kujur with 100 men to support them. The advent of the Jangalis into these districts brought them into contact with the rebel chiefs of Mazandaran, especially with Amir Mu’aiyid of Savad Kuh, whose son Sahm-ul-Mamalik was allied with the Kujuris in their foray into Tunakabun, and the spread of Jangali power to Mazandaran seemed imminent. This was however, frustrated by their defeat at Manjil bridge by Bicherakoff’s column in June, which caused them to curtail the field of their activities and withdraw back to Gilan. In the autumn of 1918 Sipah Salar himself went to Tunaka bun. Owing to the peace concluded in August between the British and the Jangalis, the latter, having no other opponent, were too powerful for him, his grandson Akram-ul-Mulk had been routed by them in Siyahristaq near Rudisar, and his estates were in a very vulnerable position between Jangalis and Kujuris. He accordingly came to terms with the former that he would not oppose them in Gilan on condition that they would not interfere with him in Tunakabun, and was conciliatory to the latter, who agreed to recognize Sipah Salar’s brother Sardar Kabir, as Governor. Soon after Sipah Salar’s departure his youngest son Sa’id-ud-Dauleh suddenly appeared in Tunakabun from Kazvin. He overruled his notoriously incompetent uncle, the Sardar Kabir, appropriated the revenues, raised 400 men and advanced to Abbasabad against Salar Fatih and the Kujuris, until, in April 1919, he was threatened in the rear by the approach of the Jangalis, who had been driven out of Gilan by the Persian Government troops, and retired to the ridge bounding the Tunakabun plain South of Khurramabad. His retirement was followed by the entry of the Kujiiris into Tunakabun, where they did much looting, nominally of Sipah Salar’s property, but actually of the whole countryside, until at the command of the76 Prime Minister, Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, supported by the advance of the Cossacks in pursuit of the Jangalis, they returned to Kujur. Dr. Hashmat and 200 Jangalis surrendered at Khurramabad and Kuchik Khan was himself at Kashku about 4 miles distant, Sa’id-ud-Dauleh was aware of his hiding place but kept it secret. His obstruction to the Cossacks would have led to his arrest,, but he forestalled them by taking flight, joined his father Sipah Salar, who was Governor General in Azarbaijan, and became Governor of Sarab. A detachment of Cossacks went on from Khurramabad to Kujur and Salar Fatih, the leader of the rebels, on receipt of a “tammnameh” from the Persian Government countersigned by the British Minister, went to Tehran. A Governor of Tunak§,bun with deputies in Kalaristaq and Kujur was appointed by the Government independently of Sipah Salar, and supported after the withdrawal of the Cossacks by posts of Gendarmerie of the Mazandaran 1 2 battalion, which were, however, bluffed out of the province by local gossip after the Bolshevik inroad into Gilan. Bolshevik ships touched at Shahsavar, the trading station of Tunakabun, but no Bolshevik or Jangall force entered the province, and the return of the Gendarmerie a few weeks after wards was unopposed. On the appointment of Nizam-ud-Dauleh (No. 50) as Governor General of Mazandaran, the Mahal-i-Salas ceased to be an independent Governorship and was attached, temporarily at any rate, to that province. Glldn. The Jqngall Movement. Mirza Kuchik Khan, the leader of the Jangalis, was the son of Haji Mirza Buzurg, a clerk in Rasht, and was born about 1878. As a young .man he received religious instruction at Rasht and became an -Akhund. In 1909 he Abandoned his religious calling, took service with Sardar Muhi (No. 76), and joined the ‘ Mujahidin,’ the revolutionary force led by Sipah Salar (No. 31a), to Tehran for the deposition of Muhammad Ali Shah. He was again with Sardar Muhi in 1911 in the latter’s 3 ill-fated adven ture to Astarabad against the Ex-Shah, was wounded and went to Baku, whence he returned to Rasht and Tehran, and remained with Sardar Muhi and others until after the outbreak of the European war. In the spring of 1915 he determined to go to 1 Headquarters at Sari. 2 i.e., By laying aside the Akhund’s turban (Imameh) and donning the ordi nary cap (Kulah), of the layman. * See history of Mazandaran.77 the advance med to Ktijc t Khurraml: 4 miles disk tkeptitsecif. 1 to his arre. is father Sift i, and betas went on f® rofthereW n Gorenaitt hran. in Ealaristi: lependenfljt f the Cossad Mon, ffto ! gossip afe ling stetioi entered tk reeks after- io. 50) as is ceased h tempoiaii’j ) was the w n about IS® his rehp ;I1( 1 joined f' lalai(NO' 31il m 5 .I 1 . He^ Gilan, probably at 1 Turkish instigation with the idea of stirring up trouble against the Russians, and went with Salar Fatih (No. 61) to Kujur, and thence via Tunakabun to Rasht. He gained a nucleus of adherents, including Haji Ahmad (No. 70), a well-to-do merchant who provided funds, with his brother Kerbelax Ibrahim, and Dr. Hashmat. In August the band repaired to the 2 Jangal, West of Kasma, the centre of the district of Fumen, 18 miles West of Rasht, accompanied by a number of riff raff, started an anti-Russian agitation in the name of the Ittihad-i-Islam (Alliance of Islam) and declared their intention of expelling the Russians from Gilan. These activities attracted the attention of the Russians who urged Hashmat-ud-Dauleh (No. 12), the Governor General of Gilan to put a stop to them. A party of Shaftls stationed by him to guard the ford at Passikhan on the Rasht-Kasma road were attacked by the Jangalls in October and fled to Rasht, whereupon Zargham-us-Sultaneh (former title of Sardar Muqtadir, see No. 78), despatched his brother Shuja'-i-DIvan with 200 Talish sowars against the band. The Jangalls re tired to Masuleh and after a little desultory skirmishing and very thorough looting of the district of Fumen, which served to embitter the people against the Government and make them pro-Jangall, Shuja’-i-DIvan returned to Talish. In view of the ill success of these steps undertaken by Persian officialdom against the Jangalls, in December the Russians sent a force of 150 Russian and 50 Persian Cossacks from Rasht to Fumen, and, prepared to send 300 more from Enzall. The Russians, however, fared worse than the _ preceding Persian expedition. They were surprised and cut up at Makalvan, and lost all their ammunition and equipment. The survivors fled back to Passikhan and Rasht. The Jangalls, anticipating trouble, retired to Masuleh, and when threatened by a Russian punitive expedition on a 1 It is uncertain to what extent the Turks were concerned in the inception ot the enterprise. The fact however, that Kuchik Khan’s hand seem to have started well provided with arms and money is suggestive of Turkish assistance, and as early as January 1916 a Turkish officer was taken prisoner from among the Jangalls. In 1917-8 they were actively co-operating with Turks and Germans, took part in the organization for assisting ex-prisoners to escape from C entral Asia to Persia and employed German and Turkish officers as military instructors. Five letters were obtained by the British Legation in 1919 which had been written in 1917-18 to Kuchik Khan from General von Kress, head of the German Military Mission to the Caucasus, M. Wustrow, German agent at Tabriz, General Khalil Pasha who commanded the Turkish army in Mesopotamia, and an unidentified Turkish agent, which prove him to have been a paid agent of the enemy in his 'hostilities”against the British. * Whence they came to be known as ‘Jangall,’ plural ‘Jangaliha,' le.; people &gt;of the forest.78 large scale they dispersed into the Jangal. The Russians went to Masuleh, but, being unable to close with their elusive enemy and suffering greatly from severe weather, they looted Fumen and returned to Rasht. After their withdrawal the Jangalls re-assembled and, except for ,an abortive expedition in April by Hashmat-ud-Dauleh, the Governor General, who poc keted the money he should have spent on troops, they enjoyed a respite until the autumn. In September, Mufakhar-ul-Mulk, the Persian agent of the Russian Consulate at Rasht, a notoriously bad character whose extreme unpopularity had largelv contri buted to the success of Jangali propaganda, started out with 250 of the scum of Rasht with the intention of looting Fumen. On arrival at Kasma he found the place deserted and billetted his men in the bazaar. The Jangalis surprised them at night., the bazaar was fired and to escape death by burning the whole party surrendered. They were disarmed and permitted to disperse with the exception of Mufakhar-ul-Mulk, who was seized and shot. So great was the detestation entertained against this creature that the Governor General was obliged to take precautions to prevent Rasht from being illuminated in honour of the event. In January 1917 the Jangalis arrested Zargham-us-Sultaneh’s deputy Governor of the two Talish districts of Masai and Shandarmin, and appointed their own nominees, the-subsequent opposition of the Zargham aided by Russians proving futile. By August 1917 the Jangal band of the Ittihad-i-Islam numbered nearly 1,000 men. All efforts, Persian and Russian alike, to crush them had failed, and they had developed into a powerful Pan-Islamic and anti-Russian movement under Turko-German influence, and become the (Ip. 'facto power in Gilan; their leaders frequently went to Rasht and the Govern ment officials executed their orders. Such is the history of their origin and early growth. Meanwhile their activities were not merely .anti-Russian but were a 1 revolt against the oppression of the landlords and the corruption and incompetence of the provincial administra tion. The complaints of the peasantry were investigated and extortionate landlords were Compelled to disgorge or pay 1 The remarks are based on despatches written at the time by the British Vice-Consul at Basht to the British Legation at Tehran, so there is no reason to suppose them biassed in favour of the Jangalis. t ’The most striking is that of Amln-ud-Dauleh (No. 68). His peasantry at Lashtmishah, Bast of Rasht, begged assistance of the Jangalis, who suddenly appeared and kidnapped him to Fumen, before troops sent from Rasht to protect him arrived on the scene. He was detained for several months and eventually released for a ransom of 75,000 tumans.79 The Eds» h their eli® sr, they tote dthdrawal I eipelttot sraJ, who po: hey enjoyedi r-ul-JIulk, th a notorious!; ugely contri’ ted out witl ding Fumeu md bihetted m at night, g the whole umtted to who was ntertmed obliged to imted in siiltanetis iasal and iuteq^nent zing futile. had-i-Islau a d Russian eloped into lent undei !o power ii the Gove® toryoftheh jn ti.Russia» adlords and adminis^' money to save their estates from confiscation and m some cases kidnanned and held up to ransom, while small owners were Haxed P 10 krans per “ Kuti ” of rice. Control of the water for the irrigation of Gilan was assumed by the Jangalis and water had never before been so equitably distributed and well adm “^- tered. A judicial court was instituted at Fumen, and, dictn, attained a reputation for incorruptibility so that people preferred to go from Rasht out to Fumen and have therr cases dealt with in the Jangall court rather ^J 111 ^ lawcourts in Rasht, which were a hy-word for c ° U { _ Schools also were established in Fumen which were much better than any under the Persian Government administration. On the outbreak of the Russian revolution, Kuchik Khan was quick to seize the opportunity to collect arm ^ t * tion from the revolutionary Russian army, which began to stream down the road to Enzah to evacuate ^ elf ^ ^ and gladly co-operated with a Bolshevik Committee at Enzalr to facihtate the evacuation. Recruits rapidly came to the Jangal and about 20 German Austrian and Turkish officers ex -P rlsoners f ° n f whom had come from Petrovsk and some ^m Central Asia vid Meshed, set to work to tram and organize them. While Kuchik Khan was Officer Commanding troops in traming Gurab Zarmakh, HajI Ahmad was m charge of the Treas y and War Office at Kasma. The position of a Governor General, bereft of ^s s ian sup- nort had become untenable and was vacant. The P ^ Governor was ordered to leave Rasht and the - anga^s ega +o take over the Government departments and police, in December 1917 »Amir AeMyir (No. f) f Chanter VIII) of Khalkhal came at their invitation and was 2Sed l Governor General without the -neton the Tehran Government, and the Jangahs m turn senta Governor to Khalkhal. On the departure of the Russians from K Persia the Jangalis directed their hostility against the ent y of the British from Mesopotamia, and violent attacks on re Britain were published in the Jangali newspaper. i Bv these methods the Jangalis were reckoned to have amassed an income °' »ev,r entered until r .i Mamalik his brother had come to mediate with the Jangalis on jgfsgssppu sssr.yiss JSffii oCS? beenme strained and he returned to Khalkhal in March.80 In February 1918 General Dunsterville’s party of officers and non-commissioned officers arrived from Baghdad with a convoy of some 40 Ford vans at Enzali in the hope of being able to embark for Baku. They met with a hostile reception from the Bolshevik Committee, who opposed any project calculated to prolong the European-war and were piqued by the British refusal to acknowledge the Bolshevik Government. The Mission were refused permission to proceed and were fortunate to obtain petrol and be permitted to return unmolested to Kazvin. Kuchik Khan’s emissaries and German agents urged the arrest of the whole party, and Kuchik is believed to have been deterred from ambushing them in the forest only by apprehension that parties of Russian soldiers on the way down the road might come to their assistance. After his return to Kazvin General Dunsterville was warned by Kuchik Khan that any further British attempt to enter Gilan would, be resisted. In the beginning of March Mr. Oakshott, the Manager of the branch of the Imperial Bank of Persia, and Mr. Maclaren, the British Vice-Consul, were forcibly removed from 1 Rasht to the Jangal, and the Belgian Customs officials at Enzali were arrested but escaped to Mashad-i-Sar. The power of the Jangalis had now reached its zenith. They mustered more than 2,000 men and controlled the whole of Gilan, the Tarum district of Khamseh, and had penetrated East into the Mahal-i- Salas whither, subsequent to the raid of the Kujuris into Tuna- kabun in February, they sent 100 men to support a Jangali Governor in Tunakabun with deputies in Kalaristaq and Kujur, whence they were communicating with the chiefs of Mazanda- ran. Amir Ashayir and the Khalkhalis were their allies and they were in close touch with the revolutionary party in Azar- baijan. They were actively intriguing in Zinjan, Kazvin and Tehran and even so far afield as Hamadan and Luristan, and the discontent created by famine and misgovernment and the consequent readiness for any social upheaval contributed to the success of their propaganda. Originally an anti-Russian society opposed to the injustice of the landlords and oppression and misgovernment in the province of Gilan, the aims of the Ittihad- i-Islam had now expanded under Turko-German influence to the i ^ le ^' '^? 1 re 80011 allowed to return to their houses, and were fairly well treated, ;!f n utn“ V i el « anCe ’ untl * they secured freedom, in June, on the entry into Rasht o ucherakoff s men.

Kuchik Khan defended his arrest of these Englishmen on the ground that the noted ultra democrat and Turkish partisan Sulaiman Mirza (No. 32) had been arrested by the British : and he demanded the release of this man before giving up his prisoners.81 fcy of olfa Mad will i of being att ception fm ct calculates r the Brifeli unent, Is st only bj i way down s return te M Khan would, be s Manager Madam, i ‘Rasht ; Email ower of ed more e Tatum laKal-i- .to Tuna- a Jangali ndKujur, Jlazanda- allies an! y in Azar- .azvifl an^ dstaDi jt and ^ jtedto* lian cession ana jjjelttihad- ie nceto* conception of a Pan-Islamic policy of a great Muhammadan State embracing Caucasus and Transcaspia. The anti-ally Cabinet of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, which came into office on 17th January 1918, was intriguing with them, and had they seized their opportunity in January or February they could possibly have occupied Tehran. They waited however, for the advent of spring and in March, when it was reported that they were contemplating an advance, Bicherakott s Cossacks arrived at Kazvin from Hamadan in time to check mate the scheme. The Jangalis were consequently prevented from making a forward movement beyond the Caspian provinces, and entrenched themselves at Manjil bridge. By June rem forcements for General Dunsterville were on theii way 10 ^' Baghdad and Bicherakoff with about 1,000 Cossacks with artillery, cavalry and infantry, assisted by 1 squadron of the 14th Hussars, 2 armoured cars, and 2 aeroplanes, was able to advance from Kazvin. On the 11th June he reache a a Bala, 8 miles from Manjil, and on the 12th ensued the „ a e of Manjil bridge.” The Jangalis under the command oi Von Paschen, a German, occupied entrenched positions on botn sides of the bridge with machine guns, but no artillery. In their previous encounters, with the Russians, they had prove elusive and formidable at guerilla warfare m their own Jangal country, but despite the training of their German and Austrian instructors and the natural strength of their posi tions they were useless for a stand up fight m e open, and turned and ran leaving Bicherakofi s column o ci oss the bridge and traverse the Safid Rud gorges o u ar without opposition. From Rudbar he went on down the road to Enzali leaving posts at Rudbar, Rustama a ant Rasht which were soon relieved by British detachmen s un er Lieut.-Colonel Matthews of the 1/4 Hampshire Regiment, who commanded a small mobile column of 800 rifles ant mountain artillery guns to keep open 50 miles of road hroug the forest between Manjil and Rasht. After their de ac e a~ Manjil the Jangalis kept up intermittent sniping and ambus mg of convoys until 20th July when they made a determined a racK on the British in Rasht/ The defending force concentrated on its Southern outskirts, where they beat off their assailants. Disheartened by this resistance the Jangalis gave up the attack and after two days of street fighting were cleared out of the town, which was entirely under British control by the end of Juiy. In August the 39th Brigade was concentrating at Enzali en route for Baku and on obtaining proof of the complicity of the Bolshevik Committee at Enzali with the Jangahs, General82 Dunsterville was able to arrest and remove them. After his failures at Manj II and Rasht, and British aeroplane raids o\er the Jangal, Kuchik Khan despairing of assistance from Turks or Germans perforce became reconciled to the presence of t e British in Gilan and on 25th August 1918 Colonel Matthews signed a treaty with him, by which the Jangalls guaranteed unimpeded use of the Manjll-Enzall road to the British as their L. of C. from Baghdad to Baku, and were themselves debarred from sending armed men along it. The Jangalis also undertook to discharge all enemy officers. In return Colonel Matthews undertook that representatives of the British forces would 1 abstain from interference in the internal concerns of Persia so long as Persia did not assist our enemies, or with the political aims of the Jarigalis with the same proviso, and that the British would 2 purchase their requirements in rice from the Jangalls. A mutual exchange of prisoners was agreed upon, and the people of Rasht were to select a temporary Governor pending resump tion of Persian Government control. The prestige of the Ittihad-i-Islamw as severely shaken. After the re-occupation of Baku by a British force under General Thomson, which sailed from Enzall on 8th November, they were deprived of their source of foreign support. Their nominees in Mahal-i-Salas had withdrawn after the “battle of Manjil bridge ” and they were consequently no longer in touch with the Mazandaran chiefs. An attack on Siyahristaq, the Eastern part of the province, by Akram-ul-Mulk, grandson of Sipah Salar, the lord of Tunakabun, who also owned large estates in Gilan, was, however, repulsed and they remained the cle facto power within the limits of Gilan. They are said to have rejected over tures to co-operate with 1,000 Turks, who rvent to Khalkhal in September, and they showed no overt hostility towards the British, but their negotiations with the Persian Government, i.e., the Cabinet of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, which offered very lenient terms, were protracted throughout the autumn and winter, until the insincerity and procrastination of the Jangalls became apparent, and their activity and defiance increased. Their strength was estimated at about 2,000, they were sending recruit ing parties to within a few miles of Kazvln, and armed parties of Jangalls had used the main road near Manjil in contraven tion of the treaty of August 1918. 1 In August 1918 this clause had no particular significance as the British troops were only passing through Persia with Baku and the Caucasus as their objective. Subsequently, however, on the adoption of the policy leading to the Anglo-Persian convention of August 1919 it became very inconvenient. 8 The contract for rice was most advantageous to the Jangalis as it provided a good-market for rice which they had confiscated from landowners.The existence of this independent power in Gilan was directly- opposed to British policy in Persia, which encouraged the endeav our of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, the Premier, to consolidate the power of the Central Government in the provinces, and in March 1919, when he prepared a force of Persian Cossacks under Colonel Starosselsky and requested British help, a British ultimatum was given to the Jangalis that if they persisted in their opposition to the Government they would incur our hostility. Kuchik Khan was offered, as an alternative, asylum under British protection in Mesopotamia. HajI Ahmad accepted the ultimatum and surrendered with 500 rifles, Dr. Hashmat, who controlled Lahijan and the East of Gilan, was negotiating when Kuchik Khan, who refused to come to terms, crossed to the East of the 1 2 Safid Bud and forced his hand. They retired South East with the intention of joining Salar Fatih and the Kujuris, hut on leaving Gilan their forces dwindled rapidly and in Tunakabun Kuchik Khan realized the hopelessness of attempting to go further. 3 Dr. Hashmat with 200 men surrendered to the Persian Cossack detachment which followed them to the vicinity oi- Khurramabad, and the remaining Jangali forces broke up into small and scattered bands of outlaws. Sardar Mu’azzam had been sent from Tehran as Governor General of Gilan and Govern ment authority was reasserted, only to alienate the .sympathy of the province by mismanagement and the misbehaviour of the Cossacks until Kuchik Khan, who had made his way back to the West of Gilan, gradually revived his cause and was regarded by the peasantry as a hero. In October 1919 he was reported to have about 600 men opposing the Persian Government troops, who had been sent to suppress them, and he was maintaining fairly regular communication with Baku via, Astara and Len koran, whence he obtained assistance of recruits, ammunition and money. During the winter 1919-20 combined operations were under taken against the Jangalis by Cossacks and Amir Muqtadir of Talish (formerly Zargham-us-Sultaneh) and Kuchik Khan, again in difficulties, began to parley with the Government. An armistice was concluded and protracted negotiations tided over the winter, the most difficult period for the Jangalis, until the arrival from Baku of Bolshevik ships with a force which occupied 1 In the event of their non-submission the Cossacks were to undertake active operations against them while the British undertook to hold the towns of Basht and Enzali, keep open the road, and co-operate with aeroplanes. In accordance with this plan Basht was occupied by British troops on 29th March. 2 They were attacked by our aeroplanes at the Basht a bad ferry and along the Lahijan road. 8 Dr. Hashmat was afterwards hanged in Bashf.84 Enzali on May 18th. The British garrison withdrew under armistice to Rasht which they evacuated on June 2nd and retired 'to Manjil. Kuchik Khan, who had been professing neutrality, thereupon made a triumphal entry into Rasht on the 4th accom panied by 200 Russian Bolsheviks, and proclaimed the deposi tion of the Shah and the formation of a Republican Soviet Government with himself as Chief Commissar and Commissar for War, the cancellation of all treaties and agreements between the Persian and other Governments, and the equality of mankind. The Government officials in Rasht were imprisoned, the detach ment of Cossacks were soon after surprised and surrendered, and the Gendarmerie voluntarily went over to the Bolsheviks. On the 26th of July a force estimated at 1,400 attacked the British position at Manjil, keeping, however, at a respectful distance, while parties worked their way round to the hills commanding Loshan bridge. On July 30th Manjil was evacuated but re-occupied on 9th August. A Cossack column passed on down the road and on 23rd August entered Rasht, where they captured 500 prisoners and quantities of arms and ammunition. They continued their advance in the direction of Enzali as far as Hasanrud where they encountered shell fire from boats on the Murdab, retired in some disorder and evacuated Rasht on 26th August. They retreated towards Manjil, but re-formed and entered Rasht a second time on 22nd September. They then kept up sporadic hostilities with the Bolsheviks between Rasht and Enzali until 22nd October, when they suddenly again eva cuated Rasht and retreated to Manjil passing through the British lines at Jubin. Their precipitate retreat appears to have been due not to the military situation but to the machinations of Sardar Starosselsky, the Russian Commander of the Persian Cossack division, who had been informed by his friends in Tehran that his dismissal was contemplated. The retreat, however, facilitated this step and the Russian officers were dismissed from the Division on 1st November. Following on the withdrawal of the Cossacks the Bolsheviks advanced into contact with the British troops, who cleared their front by advancing as far as Imamzadeh Hashim, where the Safld Rud enters the plain of Gllan, and bombed Enzali by aeroplane, but for political reasons did not advance to Rasht or commit themselves to serious operations against the Bol sheviks. The town of Rasht has undergone various vicissitudes. The first period of Bolshevik occupation lasted from 4th June to 22nd August, the second from 26th August to 22ndSeptember, the third, which began on 22nd October, seems likely to continue. During the first occupation a split occurred between Kuchik Khan and the more moderate Bolsheviks on the one side and Ihsanullah Khan, Khalu Qurban and the Communists on the other, leading to Kuchik Khan’s withdrawal to the Jangal followed by the expulsion of his Commissars from Rasht on 31st July. A Communist regime was instituted with Ihsanullah Khan as Chief Commissar, and Khalu Qurban as Commissar for War. A large part of the bazaar was deliberately fired by the Russians on the 5th August and a reign of terror ensued. After the second occupation Ihsanullah Khan and Khalu Qurban resumed their offices and formed a fresh Government under the name of the Persian Revolutionary Committee, in which Persians were substituted for Caucasian Communists, and Sardar Muni, although holding no office, played the leading part. The sufferings of the people of Rasht are attested by their wholesale ffioht from the town. After the first evacuation by the Cossacks on 25th August only some 6,000 out of a previous population of about 30,000 remained, and after the second evacuation on 22nd October 7,800 refugees arrived at Kazvin, while a much greater number were scattered over Gilan. Sketch of History of Plateau Provinces, Khalkhdl. Since the beginning of the 20th century Khalkhal has be come more and more disturbed and has been overrun by the Shatranlu tribe (see Chapter VIII). The district has suffered heavily from the famine of 1917-18 and from the prevailing insecurity and the resulting decrease in population is more marked even than in Khamseh (See below). In the summer of 1918, 1,000 Turks were reported at Hirabad, but they disappeared with the Turkish withdrawal from Azarbaijan. Khamseh. The province of Khamseh was little affected by the Persian revolution. Zulfiqar Khan, Husain Quli Khan, father of86 Sardar Asad-ud-Dauleh, was a &lt;c Constitutionalist ” and Amir Afshar, was a “ Royalist.” Zinjan, the capital, was a “ Royal- list ” stronghold owing to the principal Mujtahid, Mulla Qurban Ali, whose reactionary influence prevailed in the town until he was arrested by Yeprim and Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari on their way to Azarbaijan in 1910, and exiled to Mesopotamia. The recent history of the province is bound up with the Amir Afshar. In 1907 Amir Afshar was taken to Tehran and detained by the Constitutionalists until the coup d’etat and bombardment of the Majlis in June 1908 by Muhammad Ali Shah, when he was treated with distinction by the Shah and returned to Khamseh. In 1909 after the occupation of Tehran by Sipah Salar and Sardar Asad Bakhtiari and the deposition of Muhammad Ali Shah he turned his coat and professed “ Constitutionalism,” but took no effective steps against Mulla Qurban AH in Zinjan, who expelled a party of 50 ‘‘ Constitutionalists ” sent by Sipah Salar from Kazvin to Zinjan and killed their leader. In the autumn of 1915 the Turks were in Hamadan and in Kurdistan. General Baratoff and the Russian reinforcements advanced against them from Enzali and Kazvin along the Hamadan road, and also sent a detachment 600 strong via Zinjan and Khamseh to Kurdistan. The Amir consequently found himself sandwiched between the Russians and the Turks, became the ally of the Russians as they appeared to be in the ascendant, and in the summer of 1916 through their good offices became Governor of Khamseh. After the Russian retreat from Khaniqin to Hamadan in the autumn he promised to maintain 500 men to keep the Turks out of Garrus, but, when the Russians continued the retirement from Hamadan to Aveh, on the principle of having a foot in each camp, he began to negotiate with the Turks in Hamadan who urged him to turn against the Russians. General Baratoff heard of this intrigue and increased the Russian 1 garrison at Zinjan and posted detach ments at 2 Abhar, near 3 Karasf, the residence of the Amir, and on the 3 Tauzlu pass, the boundary of Khamseh and Hamadan. Amir Afshar, thereupon 4 slipped out of Khamseh 4 to Garrust where he joined the Turks, waited for a month until he saw that 1 It averaged about 1,000 men. 2 Said to have been 400 strong. 3 Each said to have been 200 strong. * He is reported to have been afraid to make his peace with the Russians and co-operate with theny owing to a telegram from him intended for the Turkish Commander in Hamadan, having miscarried in Garrus and fallen into the hands of the Russians.87 ti” andli as a“Eoyi!- Mulla Quit town until k Bakitiaii oi feopotaB up with ft Tekifl e d’etat sni lammad I ie Stall at! it Salar aai bmmsd $ latW tai ^injafl, wlo Jipat Salai an and in weaents dong tie teong igwuentlj fte Tuib, i be in tts their good tan retreat romised t« , but, wtea intoM ie began t« limtotoD iis in bi S® .steddetri' e Aini r i a ® j Hamada 11 ( to G 511 ® 1 he saw * 1 their advance was spent and then went to Kirmanshah and subsequently to Baghdad. His villages in Khamseh were confiscated by the Persian Government and declared btate property (khaliseh) as a punishment for his treachery to the. Russians. In 1917 the Russians evacuated Khamseh and in March 1918, the Amir was permitted to return from Baghdad, where he had established friendly relations with the British authorities after their entry into the town. Durum 1917 the Jangalis were in occupation of the upper Tarum district of Khamseh in the Kizil Uzun valley and carried on an active propaganda in the town of Zinjan, which they would probablv have occupied but for their defeat at Manjil bridge by Bicherakoff’s column and Dunsterforce m June 1918. In July 1918 Major Wagstaffe with sixty British officers and non-commissioned officers with one armoured car and a small advance party chiefly composed of Persian levies passed through Khamseh to Azarbaijan, whence the Russian army had retreated hurriedly in the beginning of January leaving the province defenceless against the Turks, save for a small Jelu force at Urumieh. The Jelus repulsed several Turkish attacks unti the end of July, when the Christians took flight. Tabriz had been evacuated by the consuls and subjects of the allies on 10th June, but the Turks had not entered the city and Dunsterforce hoped to forestall them. The Turks, however,_ arrived first and drove back the British outposts, occupied Mianeh, captured the Qaplan Kuh position, and threatened to cut the British L of Communication from Hamadan to Kazvm. The situati was critical, when the Turks turned back from Sarcham, on the Mianeh-Zinjan road, and no further operations ensued m Khamseh. Amir Afshar meanwhile had. been bidding his m and his promises of assistance to the British were no ma c le by his performances. An Indian battalion was stationed at Zinjan until ike spiing of 1919, and again in 1920 to prevent the Jangah-Bolshevik combination, which had penetrated into Tarum, from occupy ing the town. The population of Khamseh is Turki, fanatical and inclined to turbulence, and Government authority is weak. Political parties of Democrats, Social Democrats, etc., are noisy in the town of Zinjan, but no active opposition was ever offere to the Russian or afterwards to the British garrison. In 19 , during the Governor Generalship of Sipah Salar, Khamse was attached to Azarbaijan, but after, the recall of his successor ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, in 1920, it again became an independent Pro vince.88 During 1917-18 it suffered frightfully from famine and sick ness. Ruined houses in every village attest the decrease of population, and the province is much less prosperous than for merly. Kazvln. Kazvin is strategically and commercially important owing to its geographical position as the meeting place of the main roads of Northern Persia and the gate of Tehran, but it has experienced few vicissitudes. With the exception of Amir Nusrat, of the Inanlu tribe in the South, it does not contain a powerful personality and the rest of the province, except for occasional agrarian troubles in Alamut, is peaceful and law abiding, and obedient to the Tehran Government. The town of Kazvin is apathetic and welcomes all comers. In 1909 Yeprim with 250 ‘ Mujahidin,’ the advance party of the revolutionary army from Rasht, made a surprise attack on Government house, killed the Governor and occupied the town. By July 1,200 Russian troops had arrived from Enzali to watch events and if expedient to move on to Tehran. The strength of the Russian 1 garrison varied from time to time but it was never withdrawn until the Russian evacua tion of Northern Persia in 1917-18 subsequent to the Russian revolution, when after a short interval British troops took their place. During this interval the Jangalis conducted active propaganda, and had they advanced from Gilan in January or February Kazvin and Tehran might perhaps have fallen into their hands. General Dunsterville’s party from Baghdad passed through Kazvin in their attempt to reach Baku in February 1918, but were prevented by the Bolsheviks and Jangalis from going beyond Enzali, and a few days later returned to Hamadan. The Jangali opportunity of occupying Kazvin -was terminated by the arrival of Bicherakofi’s column from Hamadan in March, and in June the headquarters of Dunsterforce also moved from Hamadan to Kazvin. 1 It was reduced in 1009, increased in 1911 at the time of the Russian ulti matum to Persia, and in 1915, when Russian troops arrived to operate against the Turks along the Kirmanshah-Baghdad road.89 ,mine and i k decrease! bious ftanfe .portant on; e of tie me in, but it Is ; Inanlu trit irsonality as arian tronfe 'edient to ti s all comers party of tif i attack oi j the town. !

This area comprises two mountain systems both starting General from mount Ararat and running from North West to South o/lrea. East. The Easterly and most important system traverses Northern Elburz Azarbaljan in an Easterly direction by Karadagh (11,050') Savalan Dagh (15,800'), to the Talish country on the Caspian, whence the Talish and Masuleh hills form the barrier between the lowland coast strip and the Kizil Uzun* valley, which pierces them by the pass of the Safid Rud below Manjil. East of this river stretches the unbroken barrier of the Elburz cul minating in Damavand (18,600') and throwing off parallel spurs and buttresses clad with dense forests towards the Caspian. The Western system, which is the central system of the Western Persian plateau, passes Sahand Dagh (11,680') South of Tabriz, KhamselTand and continues South East through Khamseh and Kharagan Kharagan. and Khalaj'stan towards Kashan. The highlands of Khamseh, with the exception of the steep hills bordering the Kizil Uzun, are undulating and fertile and the slopes gradual. Their elevation averages 6,000' to 7,500'. In the vicinity of the Kazvin—Hamadan road, and South East of it in Kharagan and Khalajistan, the hills become more broken and are barren. Pronounced locally as Uzen.90 t The rivers are mentioned below pages 97-99. Stiver system. Elburz Watershed. I Watershed cf western hills of Plateau. The Western hill system in Kharagan and to a lesser degree in Khamseh presents the ordinary features of the Persian plateau. The hills are barren and stony, run from North West to South East and, in contrast to the Elburz, diminish in height to the South East. The Elburz give rise to countless perennial streams; those draining South on to the plateau, though vitally important for cultivation, are small owing to the scantier rainfall on the Southern slopes, and are not of note geographically. The only streams bringing down any volume of water through the summer are the Hablehrud, Jajarud and Karaj. In winter their overflow reaches the ‘ Kavir ’ or the Qum lake, but in summer they are absorbed in irrigating the plains at the foot of the hills. The majority of Elburz streams flow North down narrow tortuous ravines to the Caspian, where they have formed fertile deltas, of which the plains of Mazandaran and Gilan are the largest. The longest! river is the rlaraz with a course of 120 miles. These hills being lower do not give source to any considerable streams, and in summer the watercourses hold little water or become dry. The principal of them is the Kharrud formed by the junction of the stream from Abhar (on the Kazvin-Zinjan Road) with the stream from Ab-i-garm (on the Kazvln-Hama- dan Road), which flows in a South Easterly direction passing 20 miles South of Kazvin. Intermediate plains. The Kizil Uzun, which pierces these hills and after them the Elburz, rises in the mountains of Kurdistan and drains an area of 25,000 to 30,000 square miles. It follows a tortuous course of nearly 500 miles from its sources to the sea, but the distance in a straight line is only 210 miles. Near Mlaneh it receives the river Karangu, fed from the snows of Sahand, but its affluents which rise in this area are few and small until it reaches the Elburz at Manjil. The effect of the systems of the Elburz river gorges and the Kizil Uzun in regulating and limiting the lines of approach from North East and North, will be described in the Strategical Notes after the description of the Elburz-Caspian and Persian plateau sections of this area. In the centre of this area lie the plains of Zinjan (average elevation 5,000'), Abhar 5,000', Kazvin (average elevationof the Peis ran from ftt burz, dim®!: eally.

These plains are wide and level between parallel ranges. Their soil is fertile, but cultivable only where perennial streams or “ qanats ” from the hills supply water for irrigation. Else where, at a distance from the hill streams, they are arid wastes, except during the latter half of April and May, when hills and plains become green with a thin covering of grass and flowers. The Kavir, into which they merge, and which absorbs any Kavir. surplus flood water left in the rivers and not utilized for irriga tion, consists of salt impregnated desert with a whitish saline efflorescence on the surface. Its nature varies according to the amount of water in the soil; in some parts it is fairly firm, in others it has a very soft yielding surface which makes extremely heavy going, and in others it is a salt quagmire traversed by narrow paths known to the local “ charvadars ” (muleteers). The salt lake of Qum is the largest sheet of water in it, but “ small pools of brackish water are not uncommon. Sometimes there are a few tamarisk bushes, but the general aspect of the Kavir is utter barrenness unbroken by stone or weed.” The area may accordingly be divided roughly into two most dissimilar sections, each of which will be described separately :— Firstly the Elburz mountains which terminate the Persian plateau and slope down to the Caspian littoral, i.e., the pro vinces of Mazandaran, Mahal-i-Salas, Gilan, part of Tehran and Kazvin. Secondly a portion of the Persian plateau l(’Iraq) forming a rough triangle with its apex at Hamadan and its base from Mianeh through Manjil and Kazvin to Tehran. The deep valleys of the Kizil Uzun and Shahrud also run near this line. The provinces included are part of Tehran and Kazvin, Saveh, Kharagan, Khamseh, part of Hamadan, Garmarud, and Khalkhal of Azarbaijan.

Faasabilltr in winter. of the Safid Rud between Manjll and Rasht. This is the only valley from Talish to Khorasan which pierces right through the chain, and it affords the easiest natural line of approach from the Caspian to the Persian plateau. South East of the Safid Rud the continuous ridge of the x Elburz winds without a break to the Firuzkuh Pass, North East of Tehran, whence it continues East to the province of Astarabad. The best view of the range showing its formation as a uni form barrier dominated by Mount Damavand is obtained from the Mazandaran plain between Sari and Amol. North West of the Safid Rud the Masuleh and Talish hills form a single unbroken range and afford no open line of approach. The main ridge is terminated South East of the Safid Rud by the peak of Dalfak (8,500'), which rises precipitously above the valley. East of this peak through Dailiman, it is wide and undulating, 7,000' to 8,000' in height; it narrows and increases to about 10,000' at Gavanehkul (Kazvin-PuI-i-Rud-Rudisar route, North East of Kazvin), to 11,000' at Salambar (Kazvin-Tunaka- bun route) to 14,500' at Takht-i-Sulaiman behind Kalardasht, between the Seh Hazar and Chalus rivers near longitude 51°, the biggest mass in the range, whence it maintains an elevation of 10,000' to 12,000' to Damavand 18,600', which towers like a pyramid above it. It decreases to 7,000' at the Firuzkuh Pass (Tehran-Barfarush-Meshed-i-Sar route), and averages 9,000' to 10,000' further East. While rising precipitously from the valleys the summit forms a remarkably uniform ridge. It has no depressions worthy of the name of a “ Pass except at Manjil and Firuzkuh, and on the other hand has no very prominent peaks except Dalfak, Takht-i-Sulaiman, 3 Shahzadeh Kiili and Damavand. The winter cold on all the ridges is intense, and sudden terrific storms of wind and snow render the crossing of them 1 1 The Persians have no special names for the great ranges. Every prominent ridge or peak is known by a local name and mountain groups or sections of a range are collectively termed the “ mountains ” (kuhha) or “ highlands ” (yallaqat) of such and such a district. The name “ Elburz ” is applied by European geographers to the whole moun tain system stretching from Azarbaijan to Khorasan, by educated Persians it is restricted roughly to the section from the Safid Ttud to Dam. vand, and by the local villagers, to a single ridge between Alamut and Talagh.in North East of Kazvln. . Similarly with the rivers, some of the larger rivers, such as the Kizil TJzun and Haraz, retain one name for a considerable part of their courses, but the smaller streams are called after districts or villages on their banks as the water (Ab) of such and such a place, and such names change every few miles. * Most routes cross it at a^i elevation of 9,000' to 11,000'. * Between the sources of the Nur and Karaj rivers midway between Longi tudes 51° and 52°, some 20 miles North of Latitude 36°.93 dangerous and often fatal. Local village to village tracks over them are almost all blocked by snow from November or Decem ber to March, April, or May. Out of 8 ‘ through ’ routes, see Chapter X paragraph (c), crossing the highest section of the Elburz, which lies between Longitude 53° and a few miles East of Longitude 50°, 5 are closed every winter for periods varying from 3 to 6 months, and 3 normally remain open except for 10 to 20 days during the severest weather. The intense cold and storms of wind and snow, how ever, make all winter travelling arduous and often dangerous. The passability or impassability of a ridge appears to depend on the lie of the land and the action, of the wind in forming snow drifts as well as on its elevation. South East of the Safid Rud the width of the Elburz shows width oi tt» little variation and the distance along most Routes, from where range* they first enter the mountains from the plateau to where they finally emerge through the foothills on to the Caspian lowlands is approximately 100 miles. North West of the Safid Rud the width of the Masuleh and Talish bills is less and continues to decrease further North. The valleys of the Karaj and Chalus run North to South, and South to North at right angles to the Elburz and are divided by the single ridge of Kandavan. To the West of Kandavan and to the East as far as the Haraz valley, owing to the formation of lateral valleys within the range running parallel to it before they turn North to the Caspian, two or 2 more ranges must be crossed. The chief of these lateral valleys are 1. Nur which runs for some 60 miles from West to East vo its j unction with the Haraz. The Nur valley varies from 100 yards to J mile in width with strips of cultivation along the river and.is a fairly easy line of communication for pack mules. The mountains on both sides are precipitous, rocky and bare. The Nur is fordable except in April atid May, and being narrow is crossed by several pole bridges. Lateral Valley*. * The Kazvln-Langarud route, however, traverses the hills In 80 miles, the Tehran -Fir rizkuh-Mashad-i-Sar route in 130 miles owing to its devious course to the * NOTtti of the Shahrud the valley of Chakarud runs for 25 miles from West to East to Pulam, necessitating the passage of 3 ranges between Eazvin an Lansarud.94 2. Shdhrud which runs for some 100 miles from East to West to its junction with the Safid Rud at Manjil. It is formed by the junction of two streams from Alamut and Talaghan at Shireh Kuh. The Shahrud valley is a wide sloping basin, through the bottom of which the river has cut a broad stony watercourse, but from below Anbuh bridge to within a few miles of Loshati bridge it contracts into a gorge. It is consequently an indiffer ent line of communication. The mule tracks in many parts cannot follow the river bank and wind along the hillsides with numerous ascents and descents aross side valleys. It affords very little cultiveable land and, like the Kizil Uzun in Tarum, its level is too low for irrigation, and the villages are mostly situated up the side valleys in the hills. The Shahrud is liable to destructive floods, and is unford- . able from March to mid-June. In the upper reaches the Alamut and Talaghan resemble the Nur and are bridged near the tillages. Below their junction the Shahrud in flood is a formidable torrent 70 to 100 yards wide, constantly shifting its channel and divid ing into branches in its wide stony watercourse, and difficult to bridge except at a few narrow points and too swift for boats. The bridges are Siyahdasht (pole), Dehdushab (pole), Anbuh (brick), Parudbar (pole), Loshan (brick), which are all men tioned in Chapter X, paragraph (c), route No. 17. The Shahrud falls rapidly in July and by November has dwindled to 35' in width and 1|' in depth. 3, Kizil Uzun which runs for some 50 miles from North West to South East to Manjil. A description of this river will be given below under the heading “ Persian Plateau section,” pages 102-8. Watershed*. There are therefore through the loftiest part of the Elburz two watersheds:— 1. A main watershed between streams flowing to the Caspian, directly or circuitously, and streams flowing to the plateau. This watershed is situated nearer to the plateau than to the Caspian, and may be termed “ the Southern watershed.” 2. A secondary watershed to the North of the “ main ” or “ Southern watershed ” between streams flowing directly North to the sea, and those flowing South to join the lateral valleys. This may be termed the “ Northern watershed.” In the area drained by the Kizil TJzun system, i.e. North West of the Manjil-Rasht road, between the Kizil Uzun and theNo. 3. Valley of Nur in the Elburz. (Below Takor, route No. 17 stage 1, page 449.) to face page 95.Caspian, and South East as far as the sources of the Shahrud, the main ridge forms the “ Secondary ” or “ Northern ”, thence to the East, the “ main ” or “ Southern watershed.” On the Caspian side-of the “ Northern watershed ” the spurs running down from the range between the river gorges, although sinuous, keep a fairly regular general direction from South to North, the ridge resembling the spine and these offshoots the ribs. From some points, e.g., theTakht-i-Sulaiman, Damavand the Nur ridge, a clear view is obtained down to the Caspian, but elsewhere the country is usually too broken. On the plateau side, owing to the existence of these lateral valleys, the mountains are much more tangled and irregular, On the Southern face towards the plateau the Elburz present a more or less abrupt scarp rising above immense gravel slopes extending for several miles from the foot of the mountains, the Shimran slopes North of Tehran being the most extensive and best known. Ascents of the “ Southern watershed ” are very steep from both sides. The ascents of the “ Northern watershed ” are for the most part steeper and shorter from the South than from the North, where the valleys afford longer and more gradual approaches. From East to West luxuriant vegetation extends throughout Vegetation the Caspian provinces, the only variation being that the forest trees in Mazandaran and Tunakabun are much bigger than in Gilan.' To the South it is limited to the slopes nearest to the sea which catch and intercept the fertilizing moisture from the Caspian and consequently follows the line of the “ Northern watershed.” South of this watershed the valleys of Nur Shahrud and Kizil Uzun are utterly barren. The vivid contrasts of widely divergent natural features in close juxtaposition which may be viewed from this ridge are thus described by Lovett. “ North of the principal watershed forest trees and general verdure refresh the eye. Gurgling water, strips of sward and tall forest trees, backed by green hills, make a scene com pletely unlike the usual monotony of Persian landscape. The forest scenery much resembles that of England, with fine oaks and green-sward. South of the watershed the whole aspect of the landscape is as hideous and disappointing as scenery in Afghanistan. Ridge after ridge of bare hill and curtain behind curtain of serrated mountain, certainly sometimes of charming greys and blues, but still all bare and naked, rugged and arid.” (Lovett, proc. R. G. S. Feb. 1883.)/ 96 natural features of the Caspian provinces. Division Into 4 zones. Mountain zone from the watershed to 8,000 “ Kuh ' or ‘ YailSq.* Forest zone from 8,000' to the Lowlands. *' MIyanband ” below 4,000'. The width of the belt of vegetation varies considerably, e.g. t the l Chalus river flows almost due North, and it extends for 55 miles up to its sources, whereas in Nur, owing to the proximity of the ridge North of the Nur river to the coast, it is reduced to 30 miles. Its minimum width may be reckoned at 30 miles and its maximum at 60. This area constitutes the Caspian provinces geographically, as distinct from the political division into administrative pro vinces which in some districts extends further South. The scenery along the shores of the Caspian is usually of the same character and soon becomes monotonous. A narrow strip of sand is bordered on one side by the sea, on the other by a level belt of varying width, sometimes wooded and sometimes cleared, backed by forest clad hills ascending to the bare ridges of the Elburz mountains. There are therefore 2 4 separate .zones :— From the watershed to 9,000' or 8,000' consists of rock and shale with Alpine plants and grass in summer. This zone is called ‘ Kuh ’ (mountain). It contains no villages but from June to September affords grazing for large flocks of sheep. Small isolated oaktrees begin between 9,000' and 8,000' and woods at about 7,000.' The trees become bigger and the undergrowth more luxuriant as lower levels are reached, and the foothills and valleys between 2,000' and the lowlands are covered with thick forest usually with a dense undergrowth of box, thorns, and ferns. The whole, forms a most impenetrable forest and mountain region practically impassable except along the deep defiles of rivers running from South to North. Small villages are found in the valleys between 7,500' and 4,000' with wheat and barley cultivation, but these highlands are richest in summer pastures for sheep and cattle ; the sheep go beyond to the £ Kuh,” but the cattle remain in the upper forest levels. The intermediate sections of the valleys below 4,000' except those of the Nikah, Tejen, and Talar, in which rice is cultivated up to 4,000', are ravines devoid of cultivable land. The Persian name for these sections is “ Miyanband ” (midfile hills), and they are the spring and autumn pastures. 1 c./. the Talar valley. If or a list of trees see Chapter VII, para, (d), p. 279. 2 Vide Curzon’s Persia, Chapter XIII.Through the “Miyanband” the 1 rivers are narrow, deep, rocky, and impetuous torrents, difficult to ford at any season, and quite unfordable during the spring floods from March to the end of June. An exception to the narrow valleys of the “ Miyanband is also found in the case of 3 small highland alluvial plains between longitudes 51° and 52°, of Kujur, Pul, and Kalardasht. The plain of Kujur, 5100/ 17 miles North North-West of Baladeh in Nur, is 6 miles long from North-west to South-East and averages 2 miles in breadth. A small stream from it reaches the coast at Allabad. The plain of Pul, 4,270', 8 miles West of Kujur, is 3 miles long from East to West, and I mile broad. At the South-West ■corner it also branches for 2 miles up the valley of a stream from Mikhsaz, which flows down to join the Ohalus at Pul-i-Zughal. The plain of Kaldrdasht, 3,500', 8 miles West of the Pul-i- Zughal, beautifully situated under the Takht-i-Sulaiman moun tains and surrounded by wooded hills, is a pearshaped basin with the stem to the East, about 7 miles long from East to West and 5 miles at its greatest width. It has a considerable rainfall and also is irrigated throughout by the Sardabrud, and tributary brooks, which traverse it from South-West to North-East. These 3 little upland plateaus are a formation 2 peculiar to this district. They are important, especially Kalardasht, as they produce large crops of wheat, barley, and millet for export to villages in the rice growing lowlands, and to Elburz villages where the crops are insufficient to maintain the popula tion. In Mazandaran the ravines of the larger rive? s on nearing the plain open out into spacious grassy dales set among wdoded hills. In spring, when every bank is gay with primroses and violets, these meadows delight the traveller who has toiled over the Elburz, whose snowy ridges glisten in the background and complete a scene of surpassing natural, beauty. The lowlands near the Caspian are ca’led “ Qishlaq ” Caspian Low* (winter quarters). The sea originally washed the base of the hills, but silt carried down by the rivers and banked up by the waves has gradually formed an alluvial strip, called “ Dasht ” or 1 These rivers in order of size are Safid P»ud, Haraz, Pul-i-Rud, Talar, Tejen, Babul, Nikah, Seh Hazar, Chains. The Sardabrud, Izarud, and Chalkarud are smaller streams. 2 The plateau of Lar, to the South of Damavand, resembles them, but owing to its elevated and exposed position it is uncultivated and deserted except in summer when its meadows afford pasture for large flocks. The Lar stream on leaving this plateau above Pal Or rushes down rocky ravines and becomes the Haraz.98 “ Julgeh,” of extreme fertility bordering the Caspian, every where presenting uniform features but varying from 2 to miles in width, the width being greatest m the deltas formed by the largest rivers. These deltas from East to West are: 1. The plain of Mazandaran, which is the combined deltas of the Nikah, Tejen, Talar, Babul, and Haraz, and measures some 80 miles in length from East to West, from Ashrat to the West of Am5l, and 15 to 20 miles in breadth from South to North. Further West the Nur ridge nears the sea and gives rise to no streams of consequence with the result that the coas strip narrows to 2 miles or less. 2. The Chalus and Sardabrud form the district of Kalaris- taq, where this strip widens to about 4 miles. 3. Adjacent are the Izarud (near Nishta), Seh Hazar (a large stream) and Chalkarud rivers which have formed tne high y cultivated Tunakabun plain around Khurramabad, some 16 miles in length, and 6 to 8 miles in breadth. To the West of Tunakabun by Daryapushteh village the forest clad spur of Safid Tamisheh, the boundary of Tunakabun and Gilan, extends to within f mile of the sea. 4. The strip again widens at the mouth of the Pul-i Bud, expanding beyond Rudisar into the plain of Gilan, formed by the Safid Rud a triangle measuring some 70 miles in length to the North West to Shafa Rud, and 35 miles at its greatest breadth up the Safid Rud. Water is distributed over it for irrigation by canals from the river,, and most of it is highly cultivated. At Karganrud the lowlands contract to If miles. The small plains have a very definite slope from the hills down to the sea, but in Mazandaran and Gilan the slope is imperceptible and they appear dead flat. These lowlands were originally covered with dense jungle* which for the most part still remains untouched in the narrow sections between the river deltas. The smaller plains, where the rivers are sufficient for the irrigation of the whole area, have been entirely cleared for cultivation. On the large plain of Mazandaran, and, to a much lesser degree, in Gilan, many jungle thickets (‘Kharabeh’) still remain and are quite impassable.eA '&gt;V 99 On emerging from the “ Miyanband the rivers expand and have formed wide stony courses, some of them exceeding -?• mile in width, but their water is diverted for irrigation and with 1 few exceptions they become unfordable only during abnorma: floods. After May, when their volume diminishes, water left to flov down the natural channel is considered water wasted, and the torrents of the “Miyanband” are reduced to mere trickles before reaching the sea. In addition to these rivers, with their, source in the mountains (Kuh), innumerable streams rise in the foothills of the “Miyan band ” within a few miles of the coast. These are sluggish , marsh streams, with narrow channels, deep from bank to bank.. Snow water does not drain into them, their level varies com paratively little at different seasons and they do not possess sufficient force to cut through the sandbars washed up by the surf and prevailing North-Westerly winds. They are dammed up for a considerable distance from their mouths and turned in an Easterly direction parallel to the sea before they can find an outlet through the sandbanks, often overflowing into small * Murdabs ’ or deadwaters. The lagoons of Astarabad and Enzali have been formed in this way. Of these ‘ Murdab ’ streams the principal are the Larim in Mazandaran, between Teien and Talar, the Gazafrud, 12 nu es East of Pul-i-rud, and the Langarud in Gilan. Owing to their depth these streams are only fordable at certain places. The naturally swampy nature of these lowlands has been intensified artificially by the rice cultivation and the constiuc- tion, chiefly in Mazandaran, of large tanks of stagnant water and reeds (Abbandan) 3' to 6' deep, dammed up during winter to serve as reservoirs in summer for rice fields not irrigated from the rivers. The soil contains no stone or gravel, on the large plains it has no surface drainage, and when flooded becomes a morass, 1. Along the Mdzandardn -plain the beach is 40 to 60 yardsSeastore^ wide and hard with a gradual slope and is backed by a belt of sandhills, 20' to 30' high, and from | to J mile in width. 1 Safid Riid, Pul-i-rud (brings down a very big spate of snow water in spring) Haraz, Tejcn, and occasionally Babul, Chains and Talar.100 2. Further Weat sandiiiils give place to turf and bushes border ing the beach, which in many places, usually where the hills approach the coast, is narrower, steeper and very soft. 3. West of Pul-i-rud, bordering the plain of Gilan, the characteristics of 1 reappear. The hardness or softness of the beach surface seem to depend on the width and slope, the wider and more level sections prob ably being submerged during storms and beaten hard by the surf. In the soft sections animals sometimes sink knee deep, crossing some of the brooks, but there are no quicksands. The coast line stretches in a series of shallow indentations without a break and is devoid of natural harbours. With the exception of the Enzali lagoon, the “ Murdabs ” are shallow marshes, and the mouths of the rivers are obstructed by sandbars. The entrance to the artificial harbour of Enzali requires constant dredging to keep it open. Architecture. The towns are described by Lord Curzon as follows :— “ Thatched or red tiled houses with roof of high pitch and wide projecting eaves, the tiles being laid on reeds supported on rafters, present a spectacle in singular contrast to the cubical parallelograms of mud with which Persian urban architecture has familiarized us.” The houses in the lowlands (Dasht) are lofty with steep roofs of thatch running up to a point; in the ‘ Miyanband ’ they are usually 2 storeyed and roofed with wooden tiles. Along the sea shore (Lab-i-Darya) in summer platforms under a roof of thatch are constructed on poles 20' to 30' above the ground to catch the breeze and be free from mosquitoes. Strategical notes on Elburz Moun tains and Caspian provinces. Difficulty of lines of approach to Persian plateau. These geographical features give rise to special military conditions. The first salient feature of these provinces is their isolation from the rest of Persia behind the formidable barrier' of the Elburz. The Manjll-Rasht road is the 'easiest and natural line of approach, the only one passable for wheeled traffic, and is well known. The trade routes to South-East and North-West of it, which are enumerated in Chapter X paragraph (c) Land Routes, are rough mule tracks of varying degrees of badness with few exceptions rendered impassable by snow for 3 to 6 months inwinter. They climb over the Elburz at a height of 1 9,000' to 12,000' by the most breakneck gradients and zigzags and drop down ravines running parallel to each other from South to North to the coast, and their extreme difficulty renders them of little military importance as strategical lines of approach. Briefly they embody all the features of the Kazvln-Manjil- Rasht road on a far grander scale, the mountains are loftier and more precipitous, the valleys narrower and deeper, the trees bigger and the undergrowth denser. Added to these are the further obstacles of severe gradients and boulder strewn forest tracks, and deep snow in the highlands which closes many of them from December to March. The defiles are dominated by cliffs of 2,000' to 4,000' in height and afford a series of positions where a single well placed machine gun could hold the road, which is frequently built up along rock ledges through gorges and could be so destroyed by blasting that several days’ repairs would be required to make it passable for pack animals. Above the cliffs of the defiles rise steep mountain sides and lateral communications from valley to valley are limited to pre cipitous sheep paths, which can be used by small “guerilla ” bands of Persians living on the country independent of com munications, but are practically inaccessible to any organized force. Small bodies of troops could hold positions dominating the defiles above obstacles such as a destroyed path or bridge. Their flanks would rest secure and the enemy be limited to a single narrow line of approach. The dense forest and undergrowth in the “Miyanband’ sections of most valleys limit the field of vision on either side of the tracks to less than 10 yards. They are impassable except to natives and afford effective cover to snipers. South of the “Northern watershed” the valleys of Nur, Shahrud, and Kizil Uzun afford lateral lines of communication from East to West so that in summer intercommunication between parties occupying these routes in the highlands South of the “ Secondary or Northern watershed ” is less impossible than between parties attempting to ascend them from the coast. Within these provinces the position is reversed and they are most vulnerable from the sea. Rudisar-Langarud-Lahijan-Rasht-Kasma is the only lateral road from East to West ever passable for wheeled transport in these provinces and inland lateral communications for pack 1 The Fi-iizkuh rente from Tehran to Mashad-i-Sar is the only one of these tracks, which cresses a low and well defined pass. Strategical conditions } within these provincea and command of them from the Sea.See Chapter III, paragraph (c) page 152. 102 transport through the plains, except between Khurramabad and Ab-i-garm in Tunakabun, are abominable. They are paths through forest, thorns, mud, and 1 malarial rice swamps rendered almost intolerable to Europeans by mosquitoes in summer, and they make the manoeuvring of a force of any size impossible. The beach route, which is free from obstacles except the rivers mentioned above, is therefore the only lateral line of communication of any consequence. This would be rendered impassable for a defending force on land by an enemy with command of the sea, who himself enjoy ing unimpeded lateral communication by sea, would be able to land anywhere along the coast and strike quickly at any centre, such as Barfarush or Sari. The possession, however, of the country districts, as distinct from particular centres, depends largely on the goodwill of the inhabitants. The history of the Jangali movement in Gllan, a less inaccessible country than Mazandaran, has demonstrated the extreme difficulty of subjugation of such districts and oper ations against the local inhabitants, and that they could be carried out successfully only by numerous, well trained, mobile, detached forces at the expense of much time and labour. Description of Persian Plateau Section. The hills of this section are more rounded and less acute, as though formed by a uniform upward pressure in contrast to the lateral pressure which forced up the precipitous Elburz, Masuleh, and Talish mountains, the change between the two formations being very noticeable where the Kizil Uzun bends from East to South-East on leaving Khalkhal. Khalkhal and Khamseh constitute a wide expanse of high land plateaus traversed by the Kizil Uzun and a detailed des cription of this river area will include the chief geographical features. The districts traversed by the Tehran-Saveh- Hamadan road are very similar, but the hills although less elevated, are rather more broken and hills and valleys alike are very sterile and barren. The w«t.» u«un The Kizil Uzun valley can be divided #into 6 distinct sec- Area - tions :— Section I.—Yangikand to Yangijeh {Province of Khamseh). Erpm Yangikand, where the Kizil Uzun bends South on ..entering this area from Garrus, to Yangijeh, near the pointwhere it changes direction from slightly West to slightly East of South by the Takht-i-Balqis, the Kizil Uzun hows down a deep valley and mountains rise on both sides 3,000' to 4,000 above it. On the left, i.e.. West of the river, the uplands above these steep slopes are undulating and mostly arid, but owing to the proximity of the Afshar range, 10,000' to 11,000 , they are traversed by numerous side valleys with streams and villages along their banks in the districts of Uriad and Augur an. These side valleys are open in the highlands but contract into ravines on nearing the Kizil Uzun. The principal of them is the Anguran valley meeting the Kizil Uzun at Bihistan. On the East side of the river the mountains are very barren but between them and the hills above the Zinjan Bud South of a line drawn from Takht-i-Balqis to Zinjan, is a fertile plateau with shallow valleys. The valley of the Kizil Uzun varies from | to 2 miles in width, is level and produces crops of rice, wheat and barley, the most productive portion being near Mamshan, 12 miles above Yangijeh. Communication up and down the valley and across it by the Khamseh-Kurdistan routes is easy. Section to vicinity of Zinjan Bud, thence District of Garmarud, Fro vince Azarbdijdn.

Except in early spring |: ] wMer has been diverted tor 'jftL Sw 8 j n+mvi-tr Borl On the West side about lo mnes oeiow NauXzababUhe tangled hills are succeeded by the Qaplan Kuh,104 dividing the Kizil Uzun from the ^-Aqdughmish. It is a wide undulating ridge with a fiat or rounded summit, average height 6,200' above sea level and 2 1,500' above the valleys, with gradual slopes of earth and gravel. It is crossed by many easy paths. Water is very scarce and Bulanluq, 18 miles South of Mlaneh, is the only village visible on the Kizil Uzim side, but small springs on the Aqdughmish side maintain a few villages. The large expanse of country within view from this ridge is singularly dreary and uninteresting. During the spring floods from February to mid-June, the river is unfordable in both these sections. Yangikand is the only bridge, there are no boats and it can be crossed only on camels or rafts of inflated hides, which are available at the prin- * cipal crossings, e.g., Qalajuq (?) 12 miles below Yangikand, Ibrahimabad (?) 6 miles below Qalajuq, and Manishan. Crossing by these rafts is very slow, each journey to and fro takes about 20 minutes, and the hides require inflating each time. A raft carries a load of about 200 lbs. When these floods sub side in June it becomes a succession of pools and rapids with a gravel bottom, but said to contain quicksands in places, not very swift, 1J' to 2' deep in the shallows and easily fordable- In many parts it splits up into several channels. The only tributaries of note are the Anguran, Qalehchai and Zinjan Rud, and these dwindle to brooks during the low water season owing to diversion of their water for irrigation. The volume of the Kizil Uzun accordingly increases little between Yangikand and Qaplan Kuh bridge except during the melting of the Afshar snows. By the end of June the water becomes fairly clear, but it is brackish from salt springs in Garrus above Yangikand and from several other salt brooks, especially in Section II, where fresh water is very scarce. Section III.—Qaplan Kuh Bridge—-Eastern Extremity of Aqdagh, at Junction of 3 Shdhrud with Kizil Uzun. District of Garmarud for 20 miles, thence of Khalhhal, Province Azar- hdijdn. Above the bridge the Qaplan Kuh has narrowed and is steeper. On the East bank are the hills which form the Northern boundary of the Zinjan Rud basin. I Spelt Aidughmish and Aidghumash in the Gazetteer but pronounced locally as Aqdughmish. * The crest crossed by the Qaolm Kfih road is 1,520' above the bridge. At this point it is much more narrow and acute than it is further South. s The Shahrud of Khalkhal distinct from the Shahrud of Manjfl in the next section.to face page 104.Below the bridge these hills close in on both banks and the river runs for a couple of miles through an impassable gorge as far as the wide, open and fertile Mianeh basin, where it is joined by the river Karangu. The hills South and South-East of the river maintain their precipitous nature, but to the North the basin is almost flat, very little higher than the river bed and backed by low sloping hills. On leaving the Mianeh basin below Chaliyan the Kizil Uzun cuts a deep winding ravine, 3 to 4 miles in width, and 2,500 / to 3,000' deep, for some 50 miles through Khalkhal. It appears to end near Miyansarah, where the Shahrud joins the Kizil Uzun. Villages in this ravine are few and far between, and it admits of no track as the river runs against numerous precipitous spurs of cliff thrown down from the plateaus above. It can only be crossed from North to South at a few points by stony tracks with gradients of 1 in 5, and 1 in 6. To North and South above the brink of the gorge, and in striking contrast to its desolation, stretch fertile rolling uplands, 6,000' to 7,500' in height, the finest unirrigated land for wheat and barley in this area. On the North they extend Eastwards to the Aqdagh, a prominent horse-shoe mountain, about 10,000', forming the Western boundary of the Shahrud. East of the Shahrud commence the precipitous Talish-Masuleh range and the country is very broken. Above the right bank, South- East, they extend a little further, and to the South they reach the Zinjan Rud basin. From the junction of the Karangu the Kizil Uzun becomes a big turbid river, of aft average width of 50 yards, very swift and unfordable from February to June, when it is crossed on rafts of inflated hides. At other seasons local horsemen cross by recognized fords. The Pardalis bridge on the Zinjan- Ardabil road has been breached. The QivI Chai and Shahrud are small tributaries affording lines of approach from Ardabil and Hirabad. Both, however, contract into ravines before joining the Kizil Uzun causing the trade routes to make detours. Section IV.—Shahrud of Khalkhdl—Junction of Shahrud and Kizil Uzun at Manjil. Districts of Upper Tdrum {Khamseh), Lower Tdrum (Kazvin). The Kizil Uzun leaves the ravine and flows through the broad open valley of Tarum bounded by hills 3,500' to 4,500' above it, separating it from the plains of Zinjan and Sultanieh, and from Gilan. The distance from the Kizil Uzun across the106 Bridges. watershed to the vegetation on the Caspian slopes is 20 to 30 miles. These hills are jagged and difficult to cross exc p y the Zinjan-Gilan routes. Below Gilavan, 17 miles above Manjfl, the valley begms to contract and at the ruined fort of Imamzadeh Qasnn, 10 miles above Manjil, spurs of low hills run down to the river bank. The Kizil Uzun is considerably below the level of the land on either side and not utilised for irrigation. Tributary streams from the hills, especially on the left bank, are few and small and the aspect of the country most desolate, the villages appearing as small oases in the wilderness. The Kizil Uzun is wider and less turbid than in section 3 and ferry boats are used, but fording can only be easy in very low water during autumn. The Russian bridge a few miles above Manjil has been entirely swept away. Ferry boats will be enumerated below. Section V. — Manjil-Imamzadeh Hashim. The name of the Kizil Uzun on leaving the Tlurki country now changes to Safid Rud. On the right bank it is j oined by the Shahrud, which brings down big floods from the snows melting in the Elburz, but diminishes to a small and easily fordable stream in July. .• The Safid Rud valley contracts below Manjil bridge into winding ravines for 6 miles to Rudbar village, where it becomes The^forest commences abruptly at a bend below Nuqlabar, 12 miles downstream of Rudbar. The hills recede 18 miles below Nuqlabar, at Imamzadeh Hashim, where a large canal is diverted for the irrigation of the Gilan plain, and the river becomes less rapid. Section VI.—Imamzadeh Hdshim to Hasan Kidde. From Imamzadeh Hashim to its mouth at Hasan Kiade the Safid Rud flows through the fertile Gilan plain, the c ai teristics of which have already been described. The course of the river will be described in Chapter X, para graph (b) ‘ Inland Waterways.’ The only bridges in use are Yangikapd.

It is built of stone and brick with 6 arches and is 70 paces long. The 2 central spans, which are the largest and one of which, except during big floods, takes the whole river which is here very narrow and deep, have been destroyed by the Khalkhalis and one support damaged. The breach could be repaired by building up the support and throwing across a pole bridge.

On the itforth and North-West of this area the Kizil Uzun valley and the Afshar mountains are considerable obstacles. The movement of troops in the undulating highlands of Khalkhal and Khamseh is fairly easy except in winter and early spring, but the crossing of the Kizil Uzun valley in Khalkhal is- so difficult that the Ardabil-Zinjan and Hirabad-Zinjan routes are of little military importance, and the strategical line of approach into this area from the North lies along the Tabriz- Mianeh-Zinjan road crossing the Qaplan Kuh between the Aqdughmish and Kizil Uzun rivers. The chief asset of defensive positions near the road over this ridge are :— 1. The impracticability of crossing the ridge at any other point with wheeled transport. 2. A o-ood field of fire, 1 to 2 miles in width but narrowing 'to the South-West, where hills approach nearer to the river, can be commanded over the Aqdughmish valley by posts at the foot of the range on the Mianeh 3. The impassability of the Kizil Uzun gorge below Qaplan Kuh bridge. Their weaknesses are :— 1.

Below the junction of the rivers the Kizil Uzun is unfordable when in flood, at other seasons the fords would require watching as far as 1 * Maman.

Tehran. Population about 250,000. General. It is situated 51° 25' 2 , 8' E. 35° 41' 6’83 y N. at an elevation of 3,810' above sea level on the plain to the South of the Elburz range which is some 10 miles distant. The town is near the Southern end of the great gravel beds extending down from the base of the range, and is itself on a slope of some 282' from North to South. To the North along the foot of the moun tains, which rise very steeply, and where streams come down from them, numerous villages are situated, ■ which are collect ively termed Shimran and are used as summer resorts. Mention is made of Tehran as early as 1179-80, but its importance dates from 1788 when Agha Muhammad Khan, tbe founder of the Kajar dynasty, selected it to supersede Isfahan or Shiraz as the capital of Persia owing to its proxi mity to Mazandaran, the starting point from which he had conquered the country and whither he would retire if hard pressed. His choice was made on grounds of policy and strategy, and not with the object of selecting a site well suited for the foundation of a large city. Apart from the question of food supplies, a more uninviting, site than the dreary waterless gravel slopes on the North can hardly be imagined. South of the city they give place to earth and a more productive region begins. At that time Tehran was a typical small Eastern town within mud walls, with a circuit of some 2 miles and a population of 15,000. By becoming the capital it gradually gained impor tance so that by 1807 its population had risen to 50,000 and by 1870 to 120,000. The present Tehran started in 1869-70 when Nasir-ud-Din Shah decided to enlarge his capital and give it a more imposing appearance. The old mud walls were nearly all pulled down and replaced by a moat and earthen rampart 12 miles in circumference, which was completed in 1874. At the present time it is being gradually destroyed, as in the North of the city earth is being taken away for building, and to the South the clay is dug out for making bricks. The only purpose served by the rampart is to oblige all animals and goods to enter the town by one of the gates (see “ Communications below) and 1 1 Its advantages were :— Proximity to Mazandaran, central position between Meshed, Tabriz and Isfahan, conveniently situated for keeping a watch on Russia being 500 the frontier at Julfa and only accessible from the North vid Kazym cl s Caspian but easily defensible against attack from it, and well situated in case ox an attack vid Isfahan.,112 Supplies. pay octroi duties. In April 1920 the moat served a novel pur pose as a receptacle for flood water due to a cloud burst which would otherwise have flooded the city. In some places it was filled to overflowing and the gates had to be closed and banked up to stop the water. A large area of waste land was originally included within the ramparts, but this is being rapidly built over and quite a considerable “ new town ” now exists on the West outside the Kazvin gate, and large tracts of land have been, and are being, cultivated into gardens to the North and North-East. The climate is described in Chapter III. In summer there is a considerable exodus of the inhabi* tants from the city to the Shimran villages, situated at a dis' tance of 5 to 10 miles, and 500' to 900' above it. The heat and dust of the town are trying, and the relief afforded by the purer and cooler air of these villages is greater than the com paratively slight difference in elevation would suggest. A census taken by the police in 1919 gave 250,000 as the population, which is supposed to be a decrease of 100,000 from the population of 1917-18 due to the famine, influenza and typhus. The birth rate is computed at 780 per month and the death rate at 580. Within the enceinte there are 23,428 houses. The great proportion of the population are fFarsi speaking Persians and Shi’ah Muhammadans. Baha’is also are numerous. There are a fair number of Armenians, (5,000 is a mininum estimate) mostly shopkeepers, also some Jews and Chaldaeans. The Tehranis compared with the population of other towns of Persia are comparatively ‘ advanced.’ Clerical influence has much diminished during the present century, and many schools have been opened. The growth of Tehran since 1870 has increased its demand for food beyond the productive capacity of its dependencies, and rendered its supplies precarious and expensive, owing to the heavy cost of transport from distant centres. In 1917-18 the failure of the crops due to drought and to mortality of ploughing oxen from rinderpest, caused a famine, with frightful sickness and mortality. In 1918 the cabinet of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh estab lished a 1 1 Supply service and grain control for the accumulation of adequate stores of grain in the Government 2 granaries for t Turk! is spoken in villages very close to Tehran. 1 Edareh ArzSq. 2 Anb&amp;r. filled sale asted to 1 iifflit mea Ant a sk 112,000 He graii Bulagh iiarandfa la a non Meat, tl taV Iraq Is afield as 10 khan Mhark i?4d be im 'atased ceregulated sale to bakers and individuals. The organization was entrusted to M. Molitor and owing to his vigorous efforts and stringent measures of control the period 1918-19 was tided over without a shortage. He estimates the total annual requirements of Tehran at approximately— 112,000 kharvars (72,800,000 lbs) of wheat, 70,000 kharvars (42,500,0001bs) of barley. The grain producing dependencies of Tehran areVaramm, Sauj Bulagh, Khar, Shahriyar and to a much lesser extent Ghar and Fashafuyeh. In a normal year these can supply about 90,000 kharvars of wheat, the remaining 22,000 kharvars being obtained from Saveh,’ Iraq (Sultanabad), Kazvin, and in lean years from as far afield as Damghan, Hamadan and Malayir, and the whole 70,000 kharvars of barley. In addition they have a small sur plus of barley for export to Qum, and the production of barley could be increased in some areas, particularly Save , o mee increased consumption. The import of grain to Tehran commences immediately after the harvest, of barley in July and of wheat a month later, and the bulk is brought in to store by the end of December before the bad weather. The import, however, continues, but with diminishing intensity, until the spring. Grain brought into the Government Granaries is collected : 1. From the extensive State lands in the Dependencies of Tehran. 2. From the landtax. 3. By purchase from landlords. The amount collected under the Srst 2 headings, especially from the State lands, is capable of great increase by pro^r honest management and control, and y repair q and conservation of the water supply for irnga ion. Owing to this scarcity of wheat and barley no additional military force could be maintained in Tehran, unless previous arrangements had been made, without interfering with the food supply of the civil population. Wood also is scarce and coal and charcoal very expensive owing to cost of transport. Sheep, vegetables, fruit, etc., are fairly plentiful and available from the surrounding districts. Bice, as m the other plateau towns, is brought from Mazandaran.114 Trunjport. Communica tions, Gatss.] See Chapter VII, para, (c), p. 308-310, The chief camel transport owning district in the vicinity of Tehran is Saveh, where the Inanlu and Baghdadi Shahsavan tribes (see Chapter VIII) own many thousands of camels. The tribes of Varamin and Khar, who spend the summer in the “ Yailaq ” of Lar and Kruzkuh, also own a considerable number. After the harvest, and to a lesser extent in winter camels find local employment in carrying grain from Varamin, Khar, Saveh, Sauj Bulagh, Shahriyar, etc., into Tehran. On entering Tehran camels go to caravansarais in the Pa-i-Ghapu quarter. Mules are owned by all the villages of the mountain valleys- East, North and North-West of Tehran and the carrying trade between Mazandaran and Tehran is one of their chief sources of livelihood. Of the Shimran villages close to Tehran the vicinity of Kand owns the greatest number, about 400, and Lavas an, beyond the Jajarud, about 300. Quite half the mule convoys coming to Tehran are natives of Larijan. Mules on entering Tehran go to caravansarais in the Ghesariyeh quarter. For the principal roads from Tehran to the provinces seo Chapter X, para, (c) Land routes. The rampart surrounding the city is pierced by 12 gates. From the North, clockwise they are— 1. Daulat . 2.

The town possesses some fine avenues but no properly Roads and made roads. No attempt is made at drainage and only loose 8 ree • earth and water worn stones are used to form a surface with the result that the streets become full of stagnant mud during rain and snow, and inches deep in dust during the dry season. Many of the principal thoroughfares have underground “ qanats,” which are apt to burst or overflow during rain storms, and the municipal steam roller is often seen to sink to the axle in a water hole while attempting to do its duty. A Persian owned electric light plant provides lighting from Lighting, sunset till 11, p.m. after which the current is cut off. In 1898-1900 the German firm of Koppel sent two experts to frame a scheme for supply of electricity by water powe r obtained from the Kand, Haft-Hauz, Paskaleh streams and from the Jaiarud. The scheme proposed by them would have pro vided sufficient power for an electric tramway and railway to Shimran, and for the lighting of the entire town without requii- ing any coal fuel, the cost of which is excessive, but, like other schemes in Persia, this never matured. There is no general lighting of the streets at night. The “ municipality ” provides a few small one wick oil lamps i few of the main thoroughfares, but lighting, such as there is, is mostly done by the shopkeepers to display their wares. A single track of tramway of about 9 kiffimetres was laid IIiamway . about 1885 and traverses the town from near the Shah Abdu Azim gate to near the Kazvin gate, East to West ahd from the bazaars (South) to the North. It carries about 1,500,000 pas sengers per annum. A single line, 9 kilometres long was laid in 1888 from Tehran Railway, to Shah Abdul Azlm. The rolling stock has never been renewed v since its construction and is very antiquated. It carries ner y half a million passengers annually and also transports stones to the town from quarries. Tramway and Railway are run by a Belgian concern. See Chapter X, para. (i). The service in the town and to Telethon-, the principal summer resorts is maintained by a Persian 3 and is quite good. The number of subscribers is about 900.The only rivers near Tehran are the Jajarud, 11 miles from Tehran at Lashkarak, and the Karaj, 26 miles West, where it is crossed by the Kazvin road, and again about the same distance South of the city. In addition there are a few streams, e.g., Paskaleh, Haft Hauz and Kand, which have a fair volume in spring, when they run to waste, but during summer are diverted into “ Qanats.” (See Chapter III, page 148.) With the excep tion of a small 1 2 canal from the Karaj, the Tehran water supply is 2 wholly from ‘ qanats 5 bringing water from the Shimran slopes, nearly 40 in number, some fed from the mountain streams, the majority from underground sources. They vary in length from about 5 to 8 miles and some have a maximum depth of 130 to 150 “ zars ” (metres). They are entirely dependent upon the snow and rainfall. During some years the abovenamed streams overflow, burst the ‘ qanats’ and flood the lower lying plains to the North of the city, while in others the ‘ qanats ’ become almost 3 dry. The supply is uncertain and insufficient. Water is an extremely precious commodity and in summer very costly. Tor drinking it is stored in tanks 4 (Ab Anbars) as in other Persian towns. The British Legation both in town and at Qulahak, has a private “Qanat” with a supply of excellent drinking water. The water is worst in quality South of the town towards Shah Abdul Azim, which depends on shallow ‘ qanats’, fed from percolation of the water which has been supplied. by the * qanats ’ from Shimran and used and polluted in the city. Ownership of the “ qanats ” varies, a few are religious endowments or State property, but the majority are private, some being the property of a single individual, but more com monly being shared by several participants. The water dis tributors are called ‘‘ Mirab.” Their unit of measurement is the “ Sang,” the amount of water flowing at about 3 miles an 1 The water from this canal is used in the part of the town near the Kazvin gate. _ Owing to evaporation and absorption by the porous soil more than half of its original volume is lost before it reaches Tehran. 2 About 1890 Nasir-ud-DIn Shah granted a concession for supplying water to Tehran. Plans of dams and barrages to catch and utilise all the waters running South from the hills were drawn up ; the supply was to be brought in by pipes and the capital required was £2,000,000. This scheme also came to nothing owing to the objection of a certain class of the inhabitants who liked their water to come to town undeflled by “ Faranghis ” (foreigners) and their pipes. 3 e.g., in 1917 when the drought caused several streams, as well as ‘ qanats, ’ to fail and the shortage of water destroyed all cultivation and many gardens around the city. * See Chapter III, page 149. l i.e.. the amount required to turn a millstone.

The largest ‘ qanats’ contain as much as 7 or 8 “ sangs of water but the average is from 1 to 4 “ sangs. Water is usually sold at the New Year (March 21st) for a year in advance, purchasers taking a certain volume for a cer tain number of hours every week. The price of course varies according to the abundance or scarcity of the year s supply aud to the locality, but on an average 1 ‘‘sang of water for 1 hour daily throughout the year is worth about 300 tumans. The value of water varies at the different seasons. In winter it is practically valueless whereas in summer it becomes very costly and difficult to obtain unless hired m advance. _ There is unlimited space on the gravel slopes outside the Campmg rampart on the North side of the town, but water rs only obtainable in the vicinity of a qanat.

The position of the banks and the de facto monopoly enjoyed by the I. B. P. are described in Chapter VII.

It is the residential “ county town’* of ^ distinct from Barfarush which is the ^T^^Xd p romie a sleepy old fashioned place with houses of the ^nded propne tors and is usually the administrative capital of Mazandaran^ a relic of its former importance at the end idence of beginning of the 19th century when it was the Xhd-Shah bt^y AgMMuhallSd Khan Kajar, with two 2 storeyed th^di°? 8 ^e^an^^eOsecor^insi^^a^large^swidl^d °park, oonted^Tome Bne cypress trees. The Bagh-.-Shah was formerly the residence of the Governor, but it has been120 to fall into disrepair during recent years, until in 1920 the Gendarmerie had taken it over for use as their barracks and parade ground. The town is situated near the exit of the Tejen valley from the hills. The ground slopes slightly up to a low spur about 2 miles South West of it and the surrounding country is fairly open and free from stagnant water, and the area of rice cultivation is not very large. The summer climate is consequ ently less bad than at Barfarush or Amol and the town is consi dered comparatively salubrious and the “ yailaq ” of the Mazan- daran plain. Only about 10 per cent, of the inhabitants leave it in summer and migrate to the hills of the Hazar Jarib district. Inhabitants .-—-They are all Mazandaranis except the officials,, speaking a dialect among themselves but understanding Farsi. About 20 per cent, are believed to be literate. They have had little intercourse with foreigners and are less developed and progressive than the Gilakis. Their characteristics are described in Chapter IV, para.(c). As the administrative capital the town has been considerably disturbed by the intrigues and troubles in Mazandaran since 1909. Sardar Jalil is the biggest landowner and most influential personality of the district. Supplies .—In winter sheep and cattle come down in great numbers to graze in the plain and along the coast, and every kind of dairy produce is abundant until they begin to move towards the hills in April, after which very few animals remain. Vegetables are excellent and grown in considerable quan tities. Fruit, with the exception of oranges, is less plentiful than on the plateau but more plentiful than in Gilan (See also Chapter VII (d) under Agriculture, p. 289). Rice is the staple diet of the natives, men and animals, and is obtainable in unlimited quantities ; the bazaar has always a stock of wheat and barley for immediate consumption but a garrison would require to import its requirements from the Hazar Jarib, a large and productive mountain district up the Tejen valley between Sari and Samnan. A little barley is grown on the plain near Sari but is of inferior quality, the ears being dark in colour and poorly filled. The plain grown wheat is unwholesome and should be avoided. * Fish can also be fetched in winter from the coast. The supply of wood and charcoal is unlimited.121 I 500 B. 0. R. 1,5001. O. R. and 600 animals could certainly be supplied without difficulty throughout the year and probably many more. Transport .—Any estimate of transport is impossible. A fair number of animals are engaged in carrying trade between Sari and Samnan. All villages have a considerable number of pack ponies (yabu) for local use and sufficient transport would be available to keep any force supplied with wheat and barley from Hazar Jarib. Impressment, however, for military transport would be very difficult. The owners are “ ra’ayat,” (agricultural peasantry) not professional “ charvadars,” (mule teers), timid and unwilling to leave their homes, and would probably conceal their animals in the jungle, where it would be almost impossible to find them. Communications .—The badness of communications through the Mazandaran plain is described in Chapter X, para, (c) and in Chapter II under the heading of Strategical notes, p. 101/2. The road from Sari to Barfarush is accounted the worst in the province and becomes practically impassable in wet weather. The road to Ashraf, on the other hand, is paved with “sang- farsh ” over the softest sections, keeps on or near the slope of the edge of the hills, and is the easiest route in Mazandaran. It crosses the Tejen, which flows down a wide gravelly bed and is easily fordable except in flood, by a good bridge of 17 arches. A route to Samnan goes South up the Tejen valley, and Tehran is reached by Elburz routes No. 1 or No. 2 (Chapter X, para- (c) ). Telegraph. —Mazandaran—Astarabad—Shahrud to Meshed or Tehran. (Persian telegraph administration fine). Water. Water for drinking is stored in Ab Anbars filled by canals from the river Tejen, and is consequently particularly liable to surface pollution. The only good supply is_a fine spring, giving source to a considerable stream, at All Bagh, 3 miles North of Sari. , , . 1 Camping Crowds.—The Bagh-i-Shah is a good camping ground with plenty of room, but, owing to the excellence of its water, All Bagh is probably the best camping ground in the vicinity. There is much open grass and meadow land. Administration.—The Governor of Mazandaran usually resides at Sari and the Deputy Governor only functions during his absence. There are the usual officials for finance, C endar- merie (headquarter® of the Mazandaran battalion), justice and education. Police were started about 1914, but they only number 20 men and work in conjunction with the Gendarmerie. There are 2 schools with about 220 pupils.122 4. Barfarush. Present population about 30,000. General .—Situated on tbe plain of Mazandaran,on the right bank of the river Babul 12 miles above its mouth at the port of Meshed-i-Sar, 26 miles West of Sari and 20 miles East of Amok Barfarush is the commercial capital of Mazandaran and before the stagnation of Russian trade was a busy centre, especially for the export of cotton. For short periods it has been the administrative capital, but usually the Governor of Mazan daran resides at Sari. The streets are narrow, but stone paved and kept in fair repair. It is situated midway between the hills and the sea, about 15 miles from each, shut in by trees and rice and other cultivation and the summer climate and mosquitoes are very bad, worse than at Sari, but not quite as bad as at Amol. Many of the inhabitants migrate to the “yailaq” of Savad Kuh. For a general description See Gazetteer Vol. II, page 89. Inhabitants .—The inhabitants are a peaceful mercantile population and kept aloof as far as possible from the politics which have disturbed Mazandaran since 1909. Traders from Isfahan, Tabriz, and elsewhere are settled in the town and one quarter is inhabited by Jews who number about 3,000. It is in a depressed condition owing to the stoppage of trade with Russia. Numerous bankruptcies have occurred and the popula tion is believed to have decreased by about 20 per cent, since 1914. * Clerical influence is strong, and considerable opposition was made to the employment of female labour in a silk factory worked by Messrs. Stevens during 1912 and 1913. Not more than 15 per cent, of the population are believed to be literate. Supplies .—General conditions are as at Sari (q. v.), but being a bigger town and trading centre, larger quantities are obtainable. 2,000 B.O.R., 6000 I. O. R. and 2,000 animals could probably be maintained throughout the year. Transport .—For general remarks see Sari. About 800 ponies and mules are said to be engaged in the carrying trade along the Savadkuh—Fxruzkuh route, see Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz routes No. 1, and many “ charvadars ” come to Barfarush via Amol, route No. 2. Communications .—For general remarks see Sari. The two routes to Tehran are route No. 1, 162 miles and route No, 2, via Amol, 130 miles. The badness of these routes preclude s afossibility o aid an outle ohs goc ks iot beco ate.

From Barfarush do Amol is good going in dry weather and in wet weather does not become impassable like the awful Barfarush-Sari route. The track to Amol crosses the Babul by the Pul-i- Muhammad Hasan Khan, a brick bridge of 8 arches, but a piece of it has recently fallen and unless repaired the budge will soon become impassable. The Babul is slow flowing and deep at this point. Water. Water for drinking is drawn from wells, as the level of the Babul is too low to admit of bringing its water by canals to the town. Camping Ground.-The best camping groundhi the vicinit is at Ahmad Kulah, 4 miles North near the Meshed-i-Sar road a level meadow of turf, about a square mile m extent. Administration. —Barfarush, unless the Governor of Mazan daran happens to have made it his capital is under a Deputy Governor. ^ The Russians formerly had a Consular agent and there is a Karguzar, Foreign Office Representative, who use to deal with cases in which Russians were concerned, but no - days his post has become a sinecure. There are 4 school, for boys and 1 for girls. \ 5. Meshed-i-Sar. Si' plain of Mazandaran at the month of the nry BaW^abont 9 miles North of ^sf B taScS “Snd a the Mazandaran coast.

A Belgian Customs official lives at Meshed-i-Sar and controls the smaller Customs’ offices along the Mazandaran coast. 6. Amol. Population about 8,000 in winter and 5,000 or less in summer. General .—It is situated near the Western end of the plain of Mazandaran, 20 miles West South West of Barfarush on the river Haraz, about 16 miles above its mouth at Mahmudabad. It is in the middle of a big rice producing district and the summer climate and mosquitoes drive away a large proportion of the population to the “ yailaq ” of Larijan. AmSlwas almost destroyed by fire a few years ago, and has been only partly rebuilt, and is more like a large village than a town. The streets are narrow and bad and the bazaars small. Inhabitants. —They resemble those of Sari (q. v.) but the people who spend the summer in the hills are healthier. Amir Mukarram is the most influential man of the district. Supplies. —Wheat can be imported from Larijan, but owing to the large number of local animals, Larijan has little surplus of barley. Wheat and barley can also be fetched from Kujur district. About 200 B. O. R., 500 I. O. R.and 600 animals could be maintained. Transport. —5,000 to 6,000 mules are said to be engaged in carrying trade along Amol—Larijan—-Tehran road (see Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz Routes No. 2), and all villages own ponies for local work in the plain.

West to Khurramabad Tunakabun), Rudisar Langarud, Lahijan, Rasht.125 Water .—From wells. Haraz is bitter. 'Camping Grounds. —Extensive. 1. Ashraf. Population about 3,500. General .—Situated 14 miles West of Galugah, the boundary between Mazandaran and Astarabad, about 5 miles from the Gulf of Astarabad and 12 from the Caspian. It is a place of exquisite natural beauty at the foot of jungle clad hills with a view down to the Gulf and of high mountains to the East. It is described on page 49 of Gazetteer, Vol. II. The climate is mild and relaxing, but there is no rice cultivation m the vicinity and -t is said to be fairly immune from mosquitoes. Supplies.—'For general remarks see Sari. Supplies, especially vegetables and fruit, are scarcer than at Sari, and local stocks •of wheat and barley are very small. Very extensive grazing ground exists between Ashraf and the Caspian and large flocks of sheep come to it in winter from the Hazar Jarib. Transport.—Very little carrying trade passes through Ashraf. A considerable number of ponies are bred m the district oi/ar- •ghamarz (Abdul Maliki tribe), at the Western corner of the Gulf of Astarabad near the Caspian. Water .—The supply is good from springs. Camping Grounds.— -Excellent and extensive on grassland in qhe ruined Safavi Park. Administration.—Ashrai is the seat of a_Deputy Governor subordinate to the Governor of Mazandaran. 8. Rustam Kalah and Gurjlmahalleh. Population about 4,000. Two large Tillages about IJmiles apart, on the Sari—Asluaf road, about S 27 miles from Sari and 7 miles from Ashraf The inhabitants of Gurjlmahalleh are of Georgian origin and came to Mazandaran in 2 parties during the rergns of Shah Abbsa and of Agka Muhammad Khan Kajar, but have lost their ong language and religion and have intermarned «th ‘he nat.T«- These villages were a flourishing centre of cotton produetmn and considerable trade was done, bu y depressed condition. Supplies and Transport as at Ashraf.9. Rasht. *Population in 1919 about 30,000. General .—The capital of Gilan situated 20 miles (by road) inland from the Caspian Coast at Qazian (Enzali), 6| miles from the Enzali “ murdab ” and 247 miles from Tehran. The Siyah Rudbar stream passes the town on the East and the Gauhar Rud on the West. It is hidden among trees and sur rounded by rice fields, and the summer climate is damp, sultry and unhealthy. It is divided into 7 quarters, containing about 6,000 houses, 3,300 shops, 20 caravansarais for merchants and 25 for caravans. Since 1890 Rasht rapidly increased in impor tance owing to the expansion of Russian trade and of rice and silk production and to the development of communications,, and became one of the chief commercial centres of Persia. The firm of Nobel have a pipe line from Enzali and reservoirs for naphtha. Inhabitants .—The native population is Gilaki with some Farsi officials and merchants. Gilaki, Farsi and Turki are all spoken. The percentage of literates is comparatively high. There are a few Russians, some Greeks, Levantines and French men attracted by the silk industry, about 100 families of Armenians, some of Russian, the rest of Persian nationality, and a small number of Jews. Supplies. —Rice, fish, wood and charcoal are obtainable in unlimited quantities but other supplies, e q., wheat, barley and sheep must be fetched from a greater distance than in the case of the Mazandaran towns, or even of Lahijan and Langarud. The plain of Gilan, North West of the Safi id Rud, is backed by only a single and comparatively narrow range of hills separat ing' it from Tarum, fie., the Kizil Uzun valley, which has not much cultivation, and grain must be imported by long and bad mule routes from the plateaus of Khamseh and Zinj an beyond this valley. Supplies are sufficient to maintain without difficulty through out the year 500 British, 1,500 Indian ranks, and 600 animals. When the Baku route is open unlimited numbers of troops can be fed. Transport .—Plentiful in normal times. See Chapter VII, para, (e), pages 308-310. * * The town is described as ■ it existed before the Bolshevik invasion of 1920. Subsequently about 8,000 refugees left the town and a large part or' the bazaar was burned. ACommunications .—Streets through the bazaars are pa\ed but are extremely narrow, winding and bad. Ford vans go through the town with difficulty. Basht is the centre of roads in Gilan. 1. Russian metalled road from Enzali to Tehran skirts the Eastern side of the town. 2. Easht—Pir-i-Bazar metalled road and narrow gauge railway, thence across the Murdab to Enzali (q. v.). 3. Kasma-Rasht-Lahljan-Langarud-Budisar. See Chapter X, para, (c), Carriageable routes, Xo.

K-It'irinoipal trading centre on the Caspian seaboard of Persia and its position and port are described i Chantev X para a), page 410, and its trade statistics are given m Chapter VII,* para. (b). Being on the coast mosquRoes are fewer and the sea breeze makes the summer climate more tolerabl than inland amid the paddy fields of the Gila n plain.Inhabitants. —They are employed in commerce, transport of merchandise over the Murdab and fishing. The population is very mixed, the settlement of Qazlan was purely Russian, and the town of Enzali contains Armenians (about 250), Caucasians, Turkomans and immigrants from other parts of Persia ; The languages are Gilaki, Farsi (Persian) and Turki.

There is also a Karguzar, Foreign Office Representative for dealing with cases in which foreigners are concerned, and a Belgian Customs official. There used to be a Russian Consular agent. 11. Lahijan. Population about 11,000. General. —Situated on the plain of Gilan, 28 miles East of Rasht above the right bank of the Langarud stream.129 It was formerly the principal town in Gilan, but has now been eclipsed by the commercial expansion of Rasht. It remains a quiet old residential country town with well built picturesque red brick houses, and is very prettily situated near the foot of wooded hills. It is on a slope with gravelly soil at some distance from the ricefields and surrounded by open common land. In summer the climate is consequently much drier and healthier than in other Gilan towns. Before the war silk production was the principal industry and in recent years Lahijan has also become the centre of tea cultivation in Gilan. Some 10,000 to 15,000 pounds of cigarette tobacco are grown each year. Rice is the staple crop and is cultivated along the stream North of the town. The town is divided into 7 quarters, containing 2,260 houses, 6 caravans- arais and 3 bazaars with 300 shops. Inhabitants .—With the exception of 10 to 15 Greeks, who were engaged in the silk trade, are Gilaki and said to be more addicted to opium than in any other town in Persia. About 20 per cent, are literate. Supplies .—As in Rasht. The adjacent hill districts of Dailiman and Ranikuh produce a good deal of wheat and barley surplus to their own requirements, and, with Amarlu, possess large herds of sheep. SM Transport .—300 to 400 local ponies might be collected at 5 days’ notice but with difficulty. A few mules come via Siyahkal (Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz Routes No. 10) which also attracts a fair number of mules from hill ^ villages on market day, but most go via Amlish to Langarud (route No. 9).

Population about 5,000. * General .—Situated on the plain of Gilan, 40 miles East of Rasht and 12 miles East of Lahijan, on the East bank of the 11 stream of the same name, about 4 miles from the portlet of Jmistmth Chamkhaleh where it enters the Caspian. The town is sur- H«isari rounded by trees andthe summer climate is abominable owing to ’^ordinate its position in the centre of a large rice producing district. A Deputy I little tea, sugar and tobacco are also grown, and previous to the *®fflent, or war silk cocoons were produced. Some weaving of woollen and cotton cloth is done. A brisk trade with Russia was for merly carried on, the principal imports,being sugar and naphtha _ and exports rice, barley, wheat, silk, onions, potatoes, oranges, Ration ! cucumbers, eggs, etc. ^ at ge villa Inhabitants .—The town contains 8 quarters and about 1,000 |®W ( andi houses, 450 shops and a naphtha reservoir. Nearly i of the ( population is said to have been carried off by typhoid in 1918-19. In 1919, with the exception of about 20 Russians and a few Armenians, it was Gllaki with a very small percentage of Persians from ’Iraq. The clergy have considerable influence and Langarudis have the reputation of being more fanatical than people of Rasht or Lahijan. 30 per c§nt. to 35 per cent.. For^ are reputed to be opium smokers.

Transport. —Ponies are employed for local use and to Lahijan and Rasht. From 300 to 400 could probably be collected at 5 days’ notice. More than 1,500 mules work along the Amlish tainedfe route to Kazvin (Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz route No. 9); jrystaltb Apart from one or two private carriages there are no vehicles. Communications. —1. To Chamkhaleh by river boats ktowils irds by &amp; (karaji) down the Langarud. 2. Langarud-Rasht road. For the rest see Lahijan. Water.—Water is plentiful from the Langarud or from wells* .. , j both sources being considered unwholesome. A small stream IC1 ^ ! of excellent spring water called Lllakuh issues from a guJ y about 2 miles along the Lahijan road. Camping Grounds. —From October to April (inclusive) rice fields all round the town are dry and without a crop, b rom May to September they are flooded and the Sabz-i-maidan :s East of within the town is the only dry spot. Administration .—Langarud is the capital of a district com- portld c prising Rudisar and Ranikuli and the seat of a Depu y ^ vei sn is nor subordinate to the Governor General of Gilan, and sometimes teo^ 1 ; to the Deputy Governor of Lahijan.

General. —Capital of the Garmarud district of Azarbaijan on the main Zinjan-Tabriz road, 76 miles from Zinjan, and 104 from Tabriz. It is situated in the wide open basin of the Karangu a couple of miles above its junction with the Kizil U»un which emerges to meet it from the gorge below the Qaplan Kuh bridge. The rivers provide a plentiful supply of water for irrigation and the valley is highly cultivated with wheat, barley and rice, and being lowlying has a hot sultry summer climate and many mos quitoes. It is a squalid town with old and dirty caravansa- rais and buildings which are infested with the *Argus Persicus, commonly known as the Mianeh bug owing to its especial pre valence in this town. They are hidden in holes and crannies by day and come out at night, but are said to keep away from a light. Their bite brings on a severe relapsing fever and all old buildings in Mianeh should be avoided. The Indo-European Telegraph Company’s office and walled compound on an eminence just outside the gate on the Zinjan road, are free from these pests. Inhabitants ; are all Turki and very little Farsi is under stood. The chief landowner is Farman Farma and his agent lives in the town. Supplies. —Mianeh is the centre of a productive district and the irrigated crops in the Karangu basin never fail. In 1918, when the famine was at its height in Khamseh and Khalkhal, Mianeh had considerable grain stocks and Major Wagstaffe’s mission was able to purchase its requirements. A force of 1,000 British, 1,500 Indian and 2,000 animals could probably be maintained without difficulty in normal years. Transport.—Wheeled, transport is very scarce. Some camel caravans pass along the Zinjan-Tabriz road, but local transport is scanty. hlfaph.-] MianetZ pone, te.-A la 5 ol legioni h little fnrl 8fle Ian otl imping Grt 'm is exten % a shadj i^fte gardi ' ihmtmti fflnor of Ga ^laijan at i t wholesoi sij ikeir raic feral.—E !lW of the IW-Tabriz ' with ] Ned on a' •d and cons See Chapter III, para, (c), page 151.133 ■f indite ills an! i AzarljE Zinjan, it- igiiacof ich erne?

Water.—A large stream of clear good drinking water comes out of the ground about 500 yards from the Telegraph office. It is a little further from the town and less used by the towns people than other springs. Camping Grounds .—Uncultivated gravelly ground near the stream is extensive. In summer, apart from the difficulty o finding a shady camping ground without damage to standing crops, the gardens and cultivated area are full of mosquitoes. Administration.—It is the headquarters of the Deputy Governor of Garmarud subordinate to the Governor General of Azarbaiian at Tabriz.

The production of wheat and barley has fallen off owing to decrease in population and of ploughing oxen, but a good harvest yields a surplus to the needs of the province of about 30,000* kharvars of wheat and 10,000 kharvars of barley, which is exported principally to Gilan, also to Kazvin and, if required, to Tehran. On an average of 3 years out of 10, owing to a poor harvest, no grain is surplus. In 1912 and 1918 the crops failed and grain was imported from Garrus. Rice is fetched from Gilan as required and is not stored. In an avenge year at the present time (1920) supplies are obtainable locally for a force of about 1,000 B. O. R., 1,500 I. O. R. and 2,000 animals. Transport .—Wheeled transport is scarce. In addition to postal carts there are about 50 privately owned carts and carriages. Pack transport is always in transit and little is attracted to Zinjan as a destination, owing to the cessation of the f export of raisins and fruit, but camel convoys pass through on their way to Tabriz. The Afshar and Duvairan areas were estimated formerly to possess about 10,000 camels, reduced since 1917 to about 2,000. The Tarum villages own mules for local use and engaged in the carrying trade between Gilan and Khamseh and for export of fruit. They are said to total about 5,000, but this figure seems an over-estimate. A fait number of mules also work along the Bijar and Sakkiz routes. Communications .—See Chapter X, paragraph (c), Land Routes, and paragraph {d), Posts and Telegraphs. The Zinjan Rud is crossed by 2 large brick bridges on the Zinjan-Bijar and Zinjan-Hamadan routes, but by June they span a dry water course. Water and Camping Grounds.—Water is plentiful, but exposed to surface pollution as in other Persian towns. A good stream emerges by the barracks built by the British at Husaina- bad, about a mile'beyond Zinjan on the Tabriz road, which is the best camping ground. The country all round the town is open. • e Administration .—Zinjan is the capital of the province o Khamseh, and the Governor lives in a large garden in the centre oof the town. There is also a chief of Finance, of Posts, of Justice, who probably takes his orders from the Amir Afshar, * Kharvar«=650 ills. | To Russia. :iioSon (theri St, Ike police pa i 11)10 sit, Inadditi nils a motley ite epportuni untont* on ! *sl mi S’ ® Situated Mb from K if tillage witl Mid 1 situate' ® fflid lar^ ^population ii -tti it exp M of the Nu Loca PI 500 1,0 %ce, hiuin si •—wot Sow &amp; '%oi b135 ^(gp, of Education (there are 6 boys’ and 2 girls’ schools), and of Police.

Local supplies would be available for at least 300 1 t0 Afr B.O.R, 500 I.O.R, and 600 animals without fetching from £zro# a distance. \g. Transport.— So estimate of transport is possible, but the numbers of camels and mules have, like the people, much decreased since 1914 and comparatively few remain. The ^ # Afshar tribe, west of Abhar, are believed to own about 1,500 camels. le^ j Water and camping Grounds.—The water supply is good, from the stream for animals and from springs for men. bhady ^ camping grounds are available, but medical officers consi er l,^ c « the plantations round the villages in this valley, e.g., a 1U1 the t# ramdarreh, a village of 1,500 inhabitants on the roadside 4 miles upstream of Abhar, to be malarial. u Abhar rud forms a Deputy Governorship dependent of his. It possesses 3 schools.136 1 17. Kazvin. Population about 40,000. Elevation 4,400'. General .—A dilapidated and squalid town situated 96 miles by road West North West of Tehran at the junction of the Rasht, Tehran, Hamadan and Tabriz roads, about 5 miles from the hills on the North edge of a wide plain. The town is surrounded by vineyards outside the decayed walls, which are pierced by 9 gates. It is divided into 17 quarters. Inhabitants .—The presence of a Russian garrison from 1909 to 1918 and of the headquarters of the Russian Road Company and the position of the town as the road and trade centre in the Russian sphere of influence in North Persia, attracted a Russian colony and there are also some Armenians. The Persian popula tion includes a considerable Turk! element but Farsi (Persian) is generally spoken. They have a poor reputation even among Persians, and Kazvini is a term of opprobrium. During the Constitutional struggle they were passive or reactionary, and they have since become accustomed to the presence of a foreign garrison. Supplies .—Large crops of wheat and barley are raised, principally in the districts South and West of Kazvin, and in some years the surplus is exported to Tehran. Rice is fetched from Rasht, Langarud and Tunakabun. Large quantities of raisins used to be exported to Russia from vineyards around the town. No difficulty was experienced in obtaining supplies through contractors for the British and Indian garrison in 1919-20, and it is estimated that 2,200 British ranks, 6,000 Indian ranks and 4,000 animals can be rationed locally throughout a normal year (see Chapter VII, para, {e), page 302). Transport .—See Chapter VII, para, (e), pp. 309—10. Communications .—There is one thoroughfare leading through the town connecting the Rasht and Tehran roads.

The town is very dilapidated but has some gardens, chiefly of figs and pome granates, which are noted for their excellence. Inhabitants .—Saveh is the capital of a fertile district and the population is mostly agricultural with a proportion of small traders and is Farsi (Persian), although villages within a few miles of it are Turki. HajI Salar-i-Shuja’ of the tribe of Baghdadi Shahsavans, and Amir Nasir are the most influential personalities of the neighbourhood. Supplies. —With the exception of Kazvin and Barfarush, Saveh has probably more abundant supplies than any town in the area and should be able to maintain without difficulty a force of 1,500 British, 4,500 Indian and 2,000 animals through out the year. The province of Saveh produces large quantities of wheat and barley surplus to its own needs. The barley is mostly sold locally and to Shahsavan tribesmen, but wheat is exported to Tehran and Qum. The area of cultivation, especially of barley, could be increased if a market were assured for an extra crop. Sheep also are very plentiful and fruit, but vege tables with the exception of potatoes, onions and beetroot are rather scarce. Transport .—The Inanlu and Baghdadi Shahsavans own many thousands of camels. See also pages 308-10. Communications. —(1) Tehran-Saveh-Hamadan. See Chapter X, para, (c).

The damp heat and swarms of mosquitoes and horse flies render summer travelling in the former as arduous and difficult as winter travelling through the snow and slush of the latter’. So great is the difference between these two climates that the Persians accustomed to the one cannot keep their health in the other. Within these areas also the climate varies according to the altitude, between “ yailaq ” and “ qishlaq, ” the northern slope of the Elburz, for instance, between the snowy cone of Damavand and the moist warm lowlands of the Caspian coast, presenting every gradation of climate and atmosphere in the closest juxtaposi- tion. . _. Such changes bring out fever in many Persians and Indians. The seasons for pleasant and healthy travelling along routes traversing both “ yailaq ” and “ qishlaq ” are limited to 15th March to 1st May, and 15th September to 30th November. annual ^hcessivel Septem rays, tl intensif on rai ^ st Smarts t] 118 Plain of; ^inpror y' t() P of coti 1.

The climate corresponds with the Persian geographical divisions of lowlands (dasht), foothills (miyanband) and mountains (kuh), the rainfall being heaviest m the iowlands and diminishing through the transitional foothills, to the dry mountains, which exhibit the general characteristics of the plateau climate except that they attract more c ou The climate, of the lowlands especially, is most capricious and not naturally divided into 4 seasons. Sudden changes may occur at any time of the year and, according o oc ^ ^ ^ there are only two seasons, rain in any month being Y ■winter and sun by summer.

If compelled to traverse it in summer it is advisable to halt as close as possible to the beach where mos quitoes are relatively few and a breeze off the sea affords relief. Many of the inhabitants and all the herds migrate to the “ yailaq” and the people who remain in the “ qishlaq ” can be distinguished from them at a glance by their sallow unhealthy appearance. The evil tropical reputation of this climate is, however, due only to these summer months, as from the beginning of November to mid-April it is temperate and healthy resembling the South of England, but slightly milder. Late spring, i.e-, the latter half of April and May, and early autumn, i.e., the latter half of September and October, are cool but enervating. The trees are usually in full leaf by 21st March, and do not become bare until December. In the ‘ miyanband ’ the forest levels below 2,000 / are infested with large horse flies in summer. These regions are then deserted and ‘ charvadars,’ if passing through them, travel at night. Above 3,000' the climate becomes delightful. The summer temperature is much lower than at the same altitude on the plateau, the sun less powerful and the atmosphere, while fresh and bracing, is softer and more pleasant than the intense dry ness of the plateau. The winters on the other hand are milder. This equable climate is found to perfection in Kalardasht and Pul. The highlands of Dailiman, and the ridge to the right, i.e., north of, the Shahrud between Loshan and Manjil are delightful in early summer. The rainfall is most variable and at no season can fine weather be reckoned a certainty, but May, June and July are generally the least rainy, though the most humid, months and autumn and winter the most rainy. The rain falls as in England, either as a steady downpour or in drizzle, and clouds and mist may envelope the hills between 1,000' and 8,000', i.e., up to the limit of the forest, for many days. Looking down from a mountain, fog may be seen creep- ing up a valley to this level and then hanging motionless over it. Some valleys, for instance that of the Do Hazar in Tunakabun, are particularly subject to this fog. At other times it rises beyond the forest and eddies and swirls as high as the ridge of the water shed, but does not pass beyond it, and on the southern side the sky remains cloudless and gives no indication of its presence. It usually, however, causes strong gusty winds in the mountains and valleys to the south. In Gilan cloudy skies prevail, but in Mazandaran in March and April 1920 heavy rain fell at intervals m or ten da; if.® in Tuna sin in the C. ia, while in A Bemls of s lithe Eastern i (Sin, in avi it thaw, He 1 the winter ( an Manjil ai thonaly seve: sp to the or il^hlands are •Hist routes ai aler to Mar i Elburz ran ^tailing wii aH, l W. | i tot dry ^ NXovanbe !tiI J®pleasa: in easterly yiumeriis i where i® iWsrefc the“jal ; distiiigffik; appears, is, howeta beginninjC j resemfc spring, it nn, w, ih i enervatif , and do w ' are inf® lendese* ,t nigM. he sunfflf' de on tM Me fresl ense dry - 'e milto- Lalardaslt ge to th( and Maij 1 - ine weath® re generrf: mdaiitiiir of a week or ten days and was followed by bright sun. Novem ber 1919 in Tunakabun was similar. In August 1919 tue vegetation in the Chalus forests was parched and drooping from drought, Avhile in August 1920 much rain fell and continued with brief intervals of sun throughout the autumn. At the Eastern end of the Caspian snow in the lowlands is Snow, rare. Gllan, in average winters, has falls of a few inches which quickly thaw. Heavy falls, however, do occasionally occur. 'In the winter of 1912-3 there was one fall of 6', and m 1920 at the beginning of February drifts 6' in depth blocked the road between Manjil and Rasht for several days.

The climate of the Persian plateau section of are ^ S Genera1, affected by any peculiar conditions like that of the Casp provinces. &gt; In January 1905 a ^ a severe frost which froze the Murdah sufficiently hard ior from Pir-i-Bazar to Enzali.144 Owing to its situation between latitudes 38° and 35° it comes under the category of subtropical, but actually, owing to the altitude, it is for the most part cooler than this classification would imply. Its general characteristics resemble the climate of Quetta and are:— 1. A small rainfall and intensely dry, clear atmosphere, which is on the whole stimulating and healthy. 2. Regular seasons as in England but with sudden transi tions from spring to summer and frdm summer to autumn. 3. A great range of temperature due to its inland (con tinental) position. 4. A Southern sun powerful at all altitudes. These general characteristics prevail throughout and the cli mate differs only in detail and degree according to the altitude. Tehran occupies a central position at 3,800' and is th eonly place for which meteorological observations are available. It is lower lying than, most of the plateau section but the climate of other places may be judged roughly by reference to it, allowing on an* average a decrease of 5* in temperature per increase of 1,000' in altitude, and vice versa a corresponding increase in temperature down to 2,000'. Below 2,000', i.e., in the Kizil Uzun and Shahrud valleys, there is no further increase. The meteorological observations given in section (/) below show that from May to October, inclusive, the rainfall is practi cally nil. July and August are the hottest months, - but owing to the intense dryness the average maximum temperature of 105° is much less trying than the average maximum of 90° in the Caspian provinces. The average minimum temperature does not exceed 73-4 in July and the cool nights are most refreshing. The dust and glare of the bare sunbaked hills and plains’ and the flies bred in the filth of the towns and villages are the worst features of a summer on the plateau. The proximity of the mountain ranges affords a choice of summer resorts, and the plateau climate at this season may be * Proximity to the Elburz and the cool IV. W. wind blowing across it makes the North East of this area cooler than the North West.

These showers, however, are in some years of frequent occurrence, e.g., in 1920 when there was no settled fine weather after 20th July, and a heavy hailstorm occurred in August. ; A little rain comes in* November before the snow which falls in December, January, and February, but most of it comes in March and April. In Khalkhal and Khamseh during April and May local thunderstorms are of daily occurrence and fertilize these undulating uplands. The scanty rainfall, apart from the snow, is moreover frequently wasted and destructive. The broad dry stony watercourses, which are a familiar sight throughout this area, are worn not by normal rain or floods of melting snow-water, but by sudden deluges which pour down off the bare hillsides. Such floods, due to a cloudburst, did much damage to Kazvin in April 1919 and to Tehran in April 1920. These storms also occasionally visit the Elburz in summer. In August 1919, in the Nur district of Mazandaran, the moun tain sides were literally washed down to the valley every gully bringing down a torrent of flood water which destroyed the mule paths cut along the hillsides, and strewed the strips of cultivation below a foot deep with stone and debris. Except for these occasional tropical deluges, rain is not the factor which determines the height of the rivers and the water supply. More reliable than rain, and of vital importance to wider areas, is the snow, which accumulates on the mountains and by thawing gradually sinks into the ground and feeds perennial springs. It falls at frequent intervals in December, January and February. Tehran itself depends for its water supply on the snows of the Elburz, but, being sheltered and relatively lowlying, in normal years has itself more rain than snow. In 1920 however the first fall in autumn was on 30th November, and a foot of snow fell on 1st February and lay for some days. At Kazvin in 1919 snow from 6' to 16' in depth covered the whole plain for about 6 jyeeks in January and February. It thawed in the sun and became a horrible slush in the town f * In 1919 no rain fell until the end of November.

Above 7,000', except on slopes which face south, it lies throughout these months with a depth varying from 1 ^ to -0 according to the altitude and to the action of the wind in form ing drifts, and many of the passes are blocked. Winter travel ling is most severe, and for large bodies of troops almost im possible, while in early spring during the thaw open undula mg country becomes waterlogged and inches, almost feet, eep in mud, into which animals flounder up to their girths. The melting of the snows in the higher mountain ranges from March to June causes spates of the Kizil Uzun anc o a e Elburz rivers. r „ By the beginning of July, owing to the absence of clouds, tne intense sun has thawed the snow off all the ranges excep patches on the Northern slopes of Damavand and of -LaKnr-i- Sulaiman. The Southern slope of Damavand, despite elevation of 18,600', usually retains no snow. The prevailing winds follow the direction of the mountain system from N. W. to S.

Most springs are admirably pure, wholesome aJ ^ give rise to clear swift brooks. In this connec • 5 ^ 55 vile.

Source of S ly and ty. ' In the Caspian provinces the Northern slopes of the Elburz give rise to innumerable springs and streams. The supply is everywhere abundant, but in the lowlands, especially in summer, its quality is often bad, as springs are scarce and water is drawn from slow flowing and polluted streams and irrigation ditches, or from wells, the quality of which varies in different localities. As already mentioned the water supply depends mainly on the snowfall, and is most abundant where the accumulation of snow on high mountains maintains perennial springs. For irrigation the supply is never surplus, but for drinking purposes in the vicinity of the Elburz it is sufficient. Drinking water is scarce in sections *2 and *4 of the Kizil Uzun valley, i.e., from Yangijeh to Qaplan Kuh bridge, and through Tamm, where springs are very few and in the former brackish. The Kizil Uzun is always brackish, and during the flood season very muddy, but it is drunk at some villages for lack of any other supply. In many parts of Khamseh springs are few and small but of good quality. Districts in the South of the area, e.g.. South of Tehran, Saveh and of the Kharagan hills are lowlying ‘‘ qishlaq ” adjacent to the salt desert, and consequently worst supplied with water. The water of the Hablehrud, Jajarud and Karaj becomes brackish on leaving the hills, and the districts of Khar,Varamin and Shahryar have no good drinking water. The supply is taken from open streams or brought from the hills in “ Qanats,” subterranean aqueducts constructed by sinking vertical shafts and connecting these with one another by underground tunnelling. Some “qanats” are 15 miles long and 400' to 500' deep at their origin, and their course across the plains is marked by circular mounds of earth heaped around the open vertical shafts. They require annual clearing by highly paidf professionals, who work in gangs of 6 to 8 men. If, as is frequently the case especially when left as religious endow ments in charge of Mujtahids, “qanats” are neglected they speedily become choked. The expense of their upkeep is so great that the substitution of metal piping or bricked in channels would probably soon prove an economy. New “ qanats” are nowadays seldom, if ever, constructed, partly no doubt owing to the general inertia and retrograde state of the country, but also owing to the increase in wages which would make the cost prohibitive. * See pages 103-4 and 105-6. t “ Moqanni.” The daily wage per man averages 10 lirans.'t tV'SS «S3Sr without any discomfort. Water may be turned into a “ qanat ” from an open stream, as at Tehran, where some of the streams from the Tochal moun tain are so diverted and water is not left to run down the water courses on to the plain, or an underground source may be dis covered and tapped near the hills and the water gradually con ducted to the surface where required. The waste due to per colation is of course very great, and less than - 4 - of the original volume reaches the surface. “Qanat” water also is frequently polluted by refuse or carcases being thrown down the open shafts. In villages water is usually drawn direct from a spring, stream or “qanat,” but in towns it is stored in underground brick cisterns or “ Ab Anbars.” Big “ Ab Anbars, filled fevi times in a year, exist for public use, and evesy large Persian house has a small private “ Ab Anbar/ All these Ab Anbars are filled from the surface with water turned down the street gutters, so the water drunk in the towns has been exposed to every form of pollution. Ice is stored during the winter for summer use. Shallow lee. exposed ponds of dirty water- are formed behind high walls on the south side which shade them from the sun, and the ice is collected and thrown into adjacent underground vaults it is consequently, if possible, fouler than the water supply and should never be put into drinks. C.—General Medical Conditions. The salient point which forces itself painfully on the notice of Europeans in Persia is the total absence of sanitation, and the filthy heaps of refuse in the towns with their stench and swarms of flies in summer. The country districts vary considerably. The Turk! villages of Khamseh and Khalkhal are foul and verminous beyond description and no European can lodge m em. ie villages of Amarlu are little better. Elsewhere especially m the Caspian provinces, the villages are generally cleaner, thoug few are free from vermin in* spring and summer, and, P r ° V1 ^ carpets and felts are at once removed and the floor ® brushed, quite decent accommodation is obtama e. e g along the Hamadan-Kazvin road suffered during the war, and their dirty and ruinous condition does not afford a fair cnten of the state of the average Persianf village.150 Conditions within the homes of the peasantry, even in the better villages, are however insanitary. The rooms are small and badly ventilated, often devoid of windows, with low narrow doors, and teem with inhabitants who live together, share the same verminous bedding, and eat and drink out of the same utensils. c£ In winter they close all doors and huddle round the “ kursi,’ a brazier placed in a hollow in the floor under a frame supporting quilts. They sit with their feet under the frame close to the brazier, and draw the quilts up to their waists. An y epidemic once started spreads among them like wildfire. The most severe have been in 1830, when the Caspian provinces were ravaged by an awful pestilence, and in 1918. jgjpAn epidemic of typhoid following on the famine of 1918 caused frightful mortality in Khamseh and Khalkhal. In the same year 100,000 persons are computed to have died from famine and * sickness in Tehran, and typhoid and cholera deci mated the population of Mazandaran. An outbreak of influenza in the spring of 1920 in the Caspian lowlands of Kujur and Kalaristaq appeared on an average to have carried off 60 per cent, of the population, and some villages of 30 to 40 families had been practically annihilated. In the towns qualified doctors are few and “quacks” possessing influence are often preferred to young men with European degrees, while in rural areas, with the exception of an occasional physician to a big landowner, they are non-existent, and the people themselves are totally ignorant of medical principles. European travellers are importuned for medicines and should carry a supply in tabloid form. Another source of infection both in towns and villages are the public baths (“Hammam”) to which all Persians resort, the water of many of them being changed only once or twice a year. Infant mortality averages about 65 per cent. Considering these conditions it is surprising not that epide mics occur and cause high mortality, but that sickness generally is not more prevalent. That it is not, is due to the powerful disinfecting agency of the sun and the naturally healthy climate. Diseases prevalent throughout this area due to this lack of sanitation are the waterborne diseases of typhoid, dysentery, occasional cholera, and the diseases of small-pox, typhus, relaps ing fever, scabies and tuberculosis. ?ei esses of i ®matKaz^ arty, hwes ■iffltioisande Chiefly influenza.These are prevalent throughout the area in summer but are Waterborne worse in the Caspian provinces, where the water supply is most Diseases, polluted. They are also spread by the infection of food by flies and dust, especially on the plateau, by butter, by milk which should always be boiled, and by fruit and vegetables which may be soiled by dust, dirty hands or irrigation water. Few cases of typhoid occurred among the British and Indian Typhoid, garrisons at Kazvin, Rasht and Enzali in 1918 and 1919. This immunity, however, was probably due to inoculation, medical precautions and control of the water supply, as typhoid is most prevalent among the Persians, and serious epidemics broke out after the famine of 1918. Cholera is not endemic but is imported at intervals of 5 to 12 Cholera, years from the Volga, to the Caspian provinces. Its germ is quickly killed by the sun, and does not thrive so well on the plateau. Europeans are seldom attacked. Small-pox is very common. Public vaccination has been Small-pox. started in Tehran, and in 1919 in Kazvin also, but very few of the inhabitants would come to be vaccinated. Typhus and relapsing fever are endemic and are most wide- Typhus and spread in Khamseh and Khalkhal, where the dirt is greatest. reiapBing They are caused by the bite of the ordinary body louse which is ubiquitous among the poorer classes. A particularly severe form of relapsing fever, which sometimes proves fatal to Persians with no medical treatment, is also caused by a large tick, Argus Persicus, commonly known as the Mianeh bug, or ‘ Gharibgaz 5 (i.e., biter of strangers). Its bite causes a sore which should be painted with tincture of iodine. This pest is commonest in Mianeh and other villages on the Zinjan-Tabriz road, but is also found in many other localities, e.g., at Firuzkuh on the Tehran-Barfarush route [see Chapter X, para, (c), Elburz Routes No. 11. The inhabitants usually warn travellers of its presence. Like other vermin it hibernates and is troublesome in spring and summer. It only comes out of its crannies after dark and a lighted lamp at night is said to keep xt off. Old buildings and sarais are the favourite haunts of this bug and of lice and should be avoided if possible. It is advisable to fill in all cracks and fissures in walls, ceilings, etc., and parti cular attention should be paid to hollow bamboo canes, cracks in bedsteads and all hollow places which should be frequently cleansed with some disinfectant such as Formalin, crude oil, etc., and fumigated with sulphur. In order to escape the vermin a camp bed or wooden platform should be used when sleeping in sarais or village houses, and will be found to make all the difference between repose and torture.152 Scabies. Dysentery. Tuberculosis. Ophthalmia. Venereal diseases. Tropical Diseases. Plague. Malaria.]*! Salat. Scabies is very prevalent among the poorer classes who, although they wash frequently, do not change their clothes. Sulphur ointment should be carried. Dysentery and diarrhoea are common complaints among Persians owing to their aptitude for gorging themselves with fruits. A good many cases occurred among the British and Indian garrison at Kazvin. Tuberculosis is common despite the dry climate and is due to overcrowding in badly ventilated houses. Ophthalmia, i.e., granular lids, also is fairly common. Syphilis and gonorrhoea are rife among Persians of all ages in the towns, and it is estimated that at least 80 per cent, are affected. Infection is carried into the country by ‘ charvadars ’ (muleteers), discharged soldiers and others, and these diseases are fairly widespread in some villages. The prevalence of these last 4 diseases makes medical exami nation of all Persian servants and followers advisable before employment. These are more prevalent in the Caspian provinces than on the plateau and are cholera (see above), malaria and salak. Plague has not appeared in this area, but rats are fairly numerous and there is always a possibility of its introduction from Russia into Caspian ports. Malaria in the mosquito-infested Caspian provinces is fearfully prevalent, especially in autumn. The inhabitants are anaemic and pot-bellied, and are evidently the subjects of chronic malaria. The “ qishlaq ” of the Kizil Uzun and Shahrud valleys also breed mosquitoes. On the plateau they are bred at least as high as *5,000', chiefly in the cisterns and tanks of Persian houses and gardens, which should be emptied or covered with paraffin, or goldfish be introduced into them to eat the larvae, The mosquitoes are not very numerous, but are mostly of the Anopheles variety and produce an obstinate type of malarial which has been fairly prevalent in summer in the British and Indian garrison at Kazvln. Only a small percentage of the Persian children in Kazvln have enlarged spleens, and the civil population does not appear to be heavily infected with malaria. “ Salak ” is not peculiar to Persia, but occurs in many other places, e.g., the Delhi and Baghdad boils. It is an indolent sore, * The writer never saw any mosquitoes in the Elburz valleys at 6.000'.which generally forms on exposed parts of the body (i.e., the face or back of the wrist), takes a long time to get well, and leaves a disfiguring scar. Infection is carried by flies or mos quitoes. Besides malaria other fevers are prevalent, such as sandfly ^ fever (sandflies are ubiquitous in summer up to 6000', but may Altitude, be avoided to some extent by sleeping away from walls, or in an open space with a current of air, e.g., on a roof,) and chills are easily contracted on the plateau, owing to the diurnal variation of temperature. Pneumonia, tubercle and chest troubles attacked many Indians at Kazvin in the winters of 1918-1919 and 1919-1920. The altitude of the plateau is con ducive to *heart and lung diseases. , The dust and glare in summer cause eye-soreness and con junctivitis, or inflammation of the inner lining of the eyelids, and travellers at this season should wear coloured glasses The snow glare in winter in the highlands is very severe. Rheumatism occurs in the Caspian provinces. Naturally this is a healthy area with the exception of the summary. Caspian provinces from June to September, and that the severity of winter on the plateau causes pneumonia among Indians. The diseases, which are prevalent chiefly in summer, are mostly due to the insanitary habits of the people, and immunity from them may be secured by precautionary measures. These are :— 1. Anti-typhoid inoculation and vaccination. 2. Boil or chlorinate drinking water. 3. Boil milk. 4. Avoid eating uncooked vegetables or fruits. This does not of course apply to those that have remov able outer skin. 5. Strict attention to personal cleanliness and prevention of lice. 6. Avoid sleeping, if possible, in old buildings and sarais, etc., and when compelled to stay in these places use a wooden platform, usually obtainable locally, or a camp bed. 7. Use of mosquito curtains during the summer months. Authorities differ as to the benefit derived from prophy lactic doses of quinine. If taken, 5 grains daily between 16-00 and 17-00 hours is an appropriate dose. 8. Use of insect powder, and of vermijelli as a preventitive against lice. * Several cases have occurred of Europeans dying suddenly of heart disease after long residence in Persia.A small quantity should be rubbed over the surface of the body and into the seams of clothing. 1. Tn the C*»plan provinces. 2. On the plateau. D.—Conditions Affecting Aviation. The (Caspian provinces and Persian plateau present totally differeat aviation conditions. In the Caspian provinces flights have only been made in Gllan, over the Jangali co mtry and along the Kazvln-Rasht- Enzali-Astara-Tabriz routes. Thp conditions are :— 1. Thick clouds of fog frequently hang over the mountains from 1000' to 8000'. 2. Even in fine weather the jungle, especially when in leaf from March to November, screens enemy concentra tions and renders aeroplane reconnaisance difficult or ineffective. 3. Forced landings in such close country inevitably mean a crash. 4. The humidity in summer might affect aeroplanes. Conditions on the plateau, due to its altitude and to the height of the mountain ranges crossing it, are special and dis tinctive. They are :— : 1 1. Owing to the rarefied atmosphere machines require a larger run “ to take off ” and aerodromes must be larger than the orthodox 400 yards square. The affect on landing is less. 2. Snow may cover the aerodromes in winter. The sou is soft, without any covering of grass, and.when wet and sticky clogs a plane and makes starting difficult. , 3. To clear the mountain ranges an average altitude ol 12,000' must be maintained when flying. 4. Under severe winter conditions, flying at this altitude and crossing ranges of 10,000' is difficult and dangerous. 5. Pockets in the air cause “ bumps ” especially in winter. These are often so violent as to produce a sensation of “ mal de mer” in pilots fresh to Persia. The period for comfortable flying is limited to 4 hours daily, 2 hours after sunrise and 2 hours before sunset, when these “ bumps ” are less pronounced.155 In the vicinity of mountains the air currents sometimes cause a rapid and continuous loss of height. A ma chine may drop as much as 2000' and a pilot appro aching a range may discover in the lapse of a few minutes that he has fallen much too low to clear it , and must start to climb. Quite close to the mountains an upward current of air is usually encountered. 8. Difficulty of finding direction in winter if clouds obscure the mountains, which, in a country devoid of rail ways, roads and telegraphs (except the Enzali- Kazvln-Tehran and Kazvin-Hamadan routes) and of big rivers, constitute the only land marks. 7. Forced landings are dangerous and except near the Kazvln-Tehran or Kazvin-Hamadan roads, there is no possibility of salving a machine. Thunderstorms occur in the mountains, especially in spring, but can usually be circumnavigated. The changes of weather encountered in flying from the plateau to the Caspian are very sudden, and a clear sky at Kazvm may be followed by a storm on the Elburz, and the plain of Gilan may be hidden under thick banks of rain clouds. The aerodromes used by the British North Persian force in Aerodromes.' 1919-1921 were : — 1. Kazvln. —Good surface and large. After withdrawal of North Persian 2. Zmjdn .—Good surface but small, f Force these will be J J . ploughed up. 3. Rasht .—Bad surface and small. 4. Enzall .—Large with excellent turf surface. Possible landing grounds further East, near the Caspian, ire : 1. Lahijm (QMn.)-The Satai MaidSn Bast the town. Measures 250 yards North to South by 570 yards East to West. The Western end near the town is, however, uneven and of these 570 yards only 370 are really smooth. ■2 Khurramabad (Tundkabun).—In the autumn of 1919 this would have been a good landing ground, but in spring of 1920 an avenue of saplings had been planted and would require to be pulled out.156 Type of Machines.

Mahmuddbdd {Mouth of Hardz) to Mlydnkdleh penin sula between Gulf of Astardbdd and Caspian. The beach is 40 yards broad and hard and firm. To the West from Mahmudabad to Rudisar it is in most places soft. Owing to the long distances between the aerodromes and the great risk attending forced landings, long air endurance and reliability are essential qualifications for machines to be flown jn this area. “Air cooled” are more suitable than “water cooled ” engines as on the plateau in summer the water boils away before a cooler atmosphere is reached, and in winter it freezes if left in the machine. Air cooled engines have the further advantage of being lighter. The winter gales and snow make well built permanent hangars a necessity. E.—Tables of Meteorogical observations for Tehran. The following statistics for the years 1913-1919 worked out from daily observations made by the Indo-European Tele graph Department have been supplied by the India Meteoro logical Department.Tehran. Lowest Minimum T-emferatufe.The pastoral portion is migratory between “ Qishlaq ” aad “ Yailaq ”, and in the Caspian provinces, the richest stock owning districts, between “Qishlaq,” “ Miyanband ” (inter mediate spring and autumn pastures) and “ Yailaq.” From the Elburz, Masuleh, Talish and Khalkhal highlands, and even from Khamseh and Kazvin, a considerable part of the population migrates to the Caspian lowlands in winter, and vice versa many Mazandaranis and Gilakis migrate to the hills in summer. The distribution of population varies very greatly, its den- Distribution^ sity or sparsity depending on several causes, the most funda mental of which is water. 1 Unirrigated crops dependent on the rainfall are produced in the Caspian provinces, and in certain favoured districts of the plateau, notably Khalkhal and Khamseh, but generally cultivation depends on irrigation, and, with the exception of the barren mountain ranges where it is limited to the narrow valleys, is possible wherever water for irrigation is available. Water is therefore the prime factor determining the size of the cultiveable area and of the population which it can support. The water supply in turn, as has already been described on pages 145-6, depends on the accumulation of snow on the high mountain ranges, and in the Caspian provinces on the rivers maintained by the heavy rainfall on the Northern slopes of the Elburz. The population consequently is thickest on the plains of sufficient altitude themselves to be fertilized by the snow, or adjacent to these ranges, and scantiest on lowlands at a distance from them. The most thickly populated districts in the area, probably Caspian low- in the whole of Persia, with the exception perhaps of Urumieh lands - before 1915, are the deltas formed at the mouth of the Caspian rivers, the water of which is utilized for rice irrigation. In the absence of census statistics it is impossible to estimate the density of the population, but from the meagre data avail able there would appear to be between 70 and 100 inhabitants per square mile. The villages vary in size, e.q., the plain of Mazandaran contains many villages of 200 to 300 houses, whereas Tunakabun is thickly dotted with small villages averaging 20 houses. In Gilan the villages are rather more numerous and smaller, than in Mazandaran. The proximity of the villages to each 1 i.e., of cotton, sugar and vegetables but not of rice, which requires irrigation, in the lowlands, and of wheat and barley in the highlands. Details about these- crops are given in Chapter VII, para. D, Agriculture.166 Hlburz. 5iizil,Uzua area. other depends of course on their size, and the larger the vil lages the greater the distance between them, but throughout the coaststrip, except where the hills impinge close on the shore between the deltas, villages are numerous and close together although frequently hidden away in the jungle. Mr. Rabino calculates the population of Gilan on a basis of 5 inhabitants per house. In 37 of the villages of Tunakabun the average is only 4 per house. The Elburz generally provide little cultiveable land and are sparsely populated, especially in the “ miyanband ” sec tions of the rivers flowing North between the “ Secondary watershed to the North ”, as defined in Chapter II page 94, and the Caspian lowlands. The more open and populous of these districts are Hazar Jarib, (i. e. upper Tejen valley), Larijan (upper Haraz valley), Kujur, Pul, Kalardasht, Dd Hazar (Tunakabun) and Dailiman. South of this “ Secondary watershed to the North ” numer ous villages are found along the narrow strip of cultiveable land in the valleys and side valleys of Nur, Firuzkuh (i. e. Hablehrud), Damavand, Jajarud, Laura, (i.e. Karaj watershed) Shahrud, including Alamut and Talaghan, but, viewed from an altitude, these valleys constitute a mere fraction of the mountain area of desolate uninhabitable wastes. A few of these villages, especially in the Damavand area contain as many as 300 houses, but they do not average more than 15 to 40 houses. In relation to their natural resources these valleys are actually over populated.’ The. crops produced are insufficient in varying degrees for the maintenance of the inhabitants, who eke out a precarious livelihood by carrying rice and charcoal for sale on the plateau, and migrate during the winter months to trade, fetch rice, or work as labourers in the Caspian lowlands, with their equable climate, cheap food and easier conditions. The hills on both sides of Section 4 of the Kizil Uzun river above Manjil through Tarum, being lower than the Elburz south east of the a Safid-Itud, give rise to fewer streams, while the Kizil Uzun is considerably below the level of the land on both sides and is not utilized for irrigation. Tarum consequently is thinly populated and the villages appear as oases in the wilderness. They average 40 to 50 houses each. 1 1 For division of the Kizil Uzun valley into sections according to their natural features see Chapter 2, pages 102-6. n ^ . a i,e., Kizil Uzun below ManjU, where its name is changed to Safid Rud.Section 3 of the Kizil Uzun through Khalkhal up to the Qap’an Kuh bridge has very few villages in the gorge, but the uplands on both sides of it are very fertile and villages numer ous but ruinous (see page 168). Above this section the Mianeh basin in Garmarud supports many prosperous villages. Section 2 of the Kizil Uzun above Qaplan Kuh bridge to Yangijeh is populous in the valley, but the wide stretches of country on both sides of it, being low lying and at a distance from high mountains, are the most arid and deserted in this area. Section 1 of the Kizil Uzun valley from Yangijeh to Yangi- kand bridge, and also the side valleys in Uriad and Anguran draining from the Afshar mountains, have many villages. These do not average more than 30 houses each. The elevated district enclosed between the Kizil Uzun in Section 1 and the hills South-West of Zinjan, is extremely fertile and the villages average 50 to 60 houses. It becomes, barren as it slopes away further to the South-East, but there are many large villages of 200 to 400 houses in the hill district of Kharagan, South-East of the Kazvln-Hamadan road, towards Saveh. The general aspect of the country, however, along the Tehran-Saveh-Hamadan route between Robat-Karim and Zarreh is very desolate except for 15 miles before reaching Nubaran. The Zinjan Rud basin from its junction with the Kizil Uzun up to Zinjan is thinly populated, a line of small villages of 15 to 20 houses being situated along the edge of the hills where the side valleys enter the plain, at intervals of a few miles. There is much cultivation above Zinjan and over the water shed near Sultanleh, and in the basin of the Abhar Rud villages are numerous and large. The Kazvin plain is very fertile, but owing to scarcity of water its villages are comparatively few and far between. The largest are situated in the vicinity of the Kharrud, the over flow of which in winter and spring serves to irrigate the land, and contain 300 to 500 houses. More populous are the grain producing dependenceis of Tehran, namely Sauj Bulagh, Shahriyar, Varamin and Khar, irrigated respectively from the Karaj, Kand, Jajarud, and Hablehrud rivers, but even in these areas much land remains uncultivated and the villages appear as oases between the gravel slopes*of the Elburz and the uninhabited “ kavir ” (salt desert). One of the most cultivated portions, a part of Shahriyar, is traversed by the Tehran-Saveh road between Tehran and Robat Karim. Intermediate plains from North-West to South-East.Bjj Increase and decrease. 168 Such is the general distribution of population as determined by the natural features. It has however recently been modi fied by artificial causes, viz., the operations of the Russians and Turks during the War, the famine and sickness of 1918, and internal disorders. The vicinity of the Kazvln-Hamadan and Kazvin-Mianeh roads and more specially Khalkhal, Khamseh and Garmarud are the districts chiefly affected, but the dependencies of Tehran, Mazandaran, and in fact the whole area, have suffered though not to the same extent. The population of Khamseh was reduced probably by half in 1918 and ruined houses in every village afford ocular evidence of the decrease. The Kaghuzkunan district of Khalkhal, South of the Kizil Uzun, suffered equally with Khamseh from famine and sickness, and in addition was looted by raiders from North of the river. They still continue their raids and these villages are now ruined, and almost deserted. Probably less than one-tenth of the population remains, and the land is left uncultivated. Khalkhal, North of the river, as the home of the raiders, is better off than Kaghuzkunan, but owing to local feuds and turbulent times it also is in a depressed condition. Ruined houses in the villages of Khar and Varamin, the most important of the dependencies of Tehran, testify to the ravages of famine and influenza in 1918, and the population of Mazandaran was decimated by sickness in the same year. Infant mortality and periodical epidemics of sickness, due to insanitary conditions and lack of doctors, militate at all times against any considerable increase of population. f per cent, per annum was suggested by Lord Curzon as the normal annual increase for the whole of Persia. From Mr. Rabino’s figures for the population of Gllan the average annual increase however from 1850 to 1915 was less than |- per cent. Owing to the extraordinary conditions of the last few years the population in this area has without doubt greatly decreased. . The depopulation of some of the country districts has been mentioned above. In the towns of Tehran, Ramadan, Kazvin and Zinjan, the same famine conditions of course prevailed and were aggravated by the influx of starving rustics. In Ramadan in the spring of 1918 from 160 to 200 persons daily were reckoned to be perishing from hunger, and in Tehran the mortality from famine and disease, chiefly influenza, is said to have totalled 100 , 000 . lany districts fc omng tot! inn, or from ftere the wate' •w ‘qanats’ png to preye The district In Kkalkh W% are th lent adminis aside a two «i the unirri In Mazan nnder-popaia dhnate, inert bud coon ffiti Giian, that ’Minroad to ] ban Mazanda ^hion and i ^ Bolshevik ^ iaimpoi .. 1046 tom f^Pted in169 Many districts are incapable of supporting a larger population -either owing to the limited extent of cultiveable land, as in the Elburz, or from lack of water to irrigate more extended culti vation, as in the plains of Zinjan and Abhar, Kazvin and Tehran where the water supply could only be increased by digging more ‘ q anats ’ and by scientific methods such as the use of 'piping to prevent waste and the Construction of reservoirs. The districts naturally capable of supporting a very much larger population are Khalkhal, Khamseh, Mazandaran, and to a lesser extent, Gxlan. In Khalkhal and Khamseh the conditions essential to pros perity are the introduction of law and order and a provi dent administration which would educate the people to set aside a two years’ reserve of grain against a possible failure of the unirrigated crops. In Mazandaran, which is magnificently fertile, and much under-populated, the obstacles are the unhealthy summer climate, inertia and lack of development, the total absence of land communications, and the temporary stagnation of trade with Russia. Gilan, thanks to the port of Enzali and its position on the mainroad to Tehran, is more developed and thickly populated than Mazandaran, but has suffered greatly from the Jangall rebellion and cessation of trade with Russia, and in 1920 from the Bolsheviks. B.—Total Population. In the absence of statistics any accurate estimate of popu lation is impossible. In the towns of Tehran, Barfarush and Sari a census was attempted in 1920 but the census figures at best can only be regarded as approximate. The ignorant population is suspicious and likely to make false declarations of the numbers of inmates of each house, and the closed doors of the Persian “ Andarun ” prevent verification of returns. For the other towns no figures are available except those given by popular report, and it is probable that they are exag gerated. The only mode of estimating the population of the country districts with rough accuracy would be to compile lists of villages * * A difficult task owing to sudden floods due to cloud bursts in the hills. A small reservoir, which had been constructed by Sipah Saiar in a valley north of -K.azvin, was half silted up by a single .flood in 1919.

This was the method adopted by Mr. Rabino in Gxlan, but it has never been attempted for any other provinces and estimates are consequently pure guess-work. Numbers suggested by Persians are in nearly all cases patent exaggerations and have been cut down in the figures hazarded for the population of the different provinces, which are included with other details in the list of provinces in Chapter V, pages 210-25. These, figures make a round total of 1J millions for the whole population of the area. C.—Proportion, description and characteristics of Races. The three main races in this area are :— 1. Persian (Farsi). They inhabit the Elburz between, i. e., South of, the “Secondary or Northern watershed ” (See page 94) and the plateau as far West as the Safid Rud. The greater part of the population of Tehran and f of the town of Kazvin and the officials throughout the area are Farsi. 2. Turki. The entire population of Garmarud, Khalkhal and Khamseh including Upper Tarum, Lower Tarum and other parts of Kazvin province roughly West of a line drawn from Manjil to Siyahdahan, and North West of the Siyahdahan- Hamadan road, South East of this road and South West of a line from Siyahdahan to Robat Karim including Kharagan, there is an admixture of Farsi, but Turki predominates^ The town of Saveh is, however, wholly Farsi although villages within a few miles of it are Turki. About i of the population of Kazvin and a smaller part of the population of Tehran are Turki. In the strip between the base of the Elburz and a line drawn from Siyahdahan to Robat Karim, i. e., intermediate between the Farsi and Turki areas, and in Varamin and Khar South East of Tehran, Turki are found mixed with Farsi in many villages. The Farsi are the more numerous and the original inhabitants, and the Tiuki element is usually descended from tribes which have come and settled among them. 3. Mazandarani and Gilakl. In the Caspian provinces these are separated by the “ Secondary or Northern watershed of the Elburz as far as the Safid Rud from the Farsi population of the Elburz valleys, and West of the Safid Rud from t re Turki people of Tarum in the Kizil Uzun valley. In addition to the above some Armenians and Jews and Chaldacans live in the towns, chiefly in Tehran, Kazvin and' Mrisi,andi areas settlemei itich are ment: He charact moulded and fOYemment an for centimes, under the Mr All are ge dispute any superior, ani and conseqi intriguers ai tat the deg cription of 1 The lane of the gore, these charac Persian arist hare a mission of distinction ca T° an En, of the nppe r ^ ^acteristic system of fen J'oH of oth en 7 1 corneringBarfarush, and within the Farsi and the Gxlakl and Mazandarani areas settlements are found of* * TurkI, Kurdi, and Luri tribes which are mentioned in Chapter VIII. The character of all these races has in varying degrees been moulded and perverted by the corrupt and despotic form of government and landlordism to which they have been subjected for centuries, and by the position and characters of women under the Muhammadan religion. All are generally ignorant, patient, 1 obedient and slow to dispute any exercise of authority, servile and obsequious to a superior, and arrogant to an' inferior, dishonest, self seeking and consequently suspicious of each other’s motives, born intriguers and 2 liars. Courage is an attribute of none of them, but the degree of cowardice varies. In fact Herodotus’ des cription of them is still applicable. The landowning and official classes reproduced the features of the government in theit dealings with the peasantry, and these characteristics permeate every class of the people. The Persian aristocracy itself was never an exclusive body but its ranks have at all periods been constantly swelled by the ad mission of “ noti homines ” of the humblest origin, so that no distinction can be drawn between it and the masses. To an Englishman, next to their corruption, the indolence of the upper classes seems their most striking and hopeless characteristic. They are parasites, enabled by the oppressive system of feudal landlordism still prevailing to batten on the work of others, and callous to the suffering and mortality caused by cornering and hoarding grain in times of famine. The majority of them have no occupation, indulge in no_ manly pursuits, and kill time and amuse themselves by gossip, vice, opium, and gambling. 3 Sexual immorality is freely practised by both sexes in the towns, especially in Tehran, and in Mazan- daran in town and country alike, and the people are emascul- lated by venereal diseases which are said to infect 80 per cent, of them. In other country districts, especially among the Turk! population, it is rare and venereal diseases, although imported from the towns, are less rife. 1 The Persians as Shi’ah Muhammadans uphold the divine right of the Imamate, and formerly were “ Shahparast ”, (Shah worshippers) and upheld ^Th^boy 'disciplined to obedience in his own home, where he will not jit o| smoke in the presence of his father and speaks of him respectfully as Aqa * Only a clumsy lie, 'which can be detected, is considered disgraceful. ’ See also section (d) Religion para, re Marriage, page 186. Description and characteristics of Races.The defects of the Persian character are thus portrayed on page 12 of R. G. Watson’s history of Persia :— “ One cannot live amongst the Persians without becoming nware of the absence from their character of many of the qua lities that make life most pleasant, and of the presence in their stead, of many of the habits and vices that are held elsewhere to disgrace humanity. If there be any beauty in truth, in honesty in dealings between man and man, in uprightness and independence of character; in wedded love, in family life and affection, in readiness to sacrifice fortune or life, if necessary for the public good, in tolerance-towards others in points relat ing to religion, in fair play towards others, in gratitude for pas* kindness, in modesty in a consistent endeavour to provide for the well-being of posterity—such beauty it would be vain to expect to meet with in Persia.” The Persians were originally an Aryan race but wave after wave of invaders has submerged the country and mingled with the inhabitants. The upper classes and town population are of poor physi que due to their indolent and sedentary habits and addicted ness to opium and vice, of medium height, white skinned, sharp featured with dark hair and eyebrows and lustrous eyes, which, by contrast with a pale complexion, often appear very handsome. The peasantry possess great physical strength and endurance, and are coarser featured. The characteristics of the Farsi correspond to their geo graphical position as Southerners intermediate between East and West. They are styled the Frenchmen of the East and rather resemble the so-called ‘ Dagoes ’ of Southern Europe. Morier’s portrait of Haji Baba of Isfahan, two parts knave and one part good fellow, is true to life. The dry rarefied climate of the high tableland, while conducive to keeness of wits and of the imagination, ‘‘ does not redeem them from the listness pro duced by the Eastern sun ” and they are lacking in moral not intellectual qualities. They are some of the most polite, and hospitable, and at the same time vain, unprincipled, unreliable and unpractical people in the world, lavish in promises which they have no intention or capacity to fulfil, brave in speech, shameless in syc ophanty and intrigue and cowardly in action, quick to pick up new ideas or start a new work, but lacking in perse173 verance and energy to carry it through. The habit of “ laissez f(lire^ is ingrained in them, they are adepts at procrastination and “ far da inshallah ” (to-morrow please God) is a favourite and exasperating retort. They are sharp and quick witted and their mental acumen has made them originators of religions and philosophies. Their keen sense of humour, vivacity and versatility make them good company and they frequently possess consideiahle personal charm. The altitude of the plateau renders them nervous and emo tional, and a Persian crowd is easily swayed by demagogues and agitators. Old fashioned Tories, like the ’Ain-ud-Dauleh, were led by their vanity to consider anything Persian better than anything foreign, but this point of view is dying out. As a rule, how ever, while deploring the corrupt qualities of the Persian character, from which the speaker of course professes himself singularly exempt, members of the landowning and official class secretly would prefer to continue to fish in troubled waters rather than see the administration purged and reformed. Young men with better education and ideals lack the prac tical ability and experience to give effect to them, and it is noteworthy that several of the active leaders of the Persian revolution were Armenians and Caucasians while Persian landowners played the part of figureheads (“natars”). The need, which is generally admitted, of employing Europeans as advisers and administrative organisers affords further evidence of this practical inexperience and inability, and lack of authority over each other. The peasantry resemble the townspeople in mental qualities and intelligence. They are cheerful, friendly and free with their promises, but disappear with no intention of fulfilling them. They have a keen eye to business and are either “ mazlum ”, oppressed, or “ zalim ”, oppressor. They pour out complaints about Persian Cossacks or gendarmerie who requisition supplies at current or low rates, and in turn take advantage of a Euro pean, unless backed by authority, and hold up supplies to extract extortionate prices. In their ignorance they have no idea of fair dealing. They are hardworldng, patient and schooled to obedience, and, provided their crops do not fail and they are well fed and not too ruthlessly fleeced, they crave peace and quiet and of their own initiative desire no innovation.Tnrki, origin of. Characteristics. Their homes are one storeyed, flatroofed, ill-ventilated, huts of mud and stone and their manner of life has remained unchanged from generation to generation. The Turk! population are the result of various bodies of invaders from Central Asia into Persia, but more particularly of the Ghuzz tribes who invaded it during the Seljuk period in the 11th and 12th centuries. After the Seljuks ensued the Mongol invasions and the rule of the Mongol il Khans of Persia who had their capitals at Maragha, Tabriz and 1 Sultanieh (near Zinjan). According to a strong local tradition the ancestors of the Khalaj and Ba’yat Turks in the Saveh district came to these regions with the armies of Timur at the end of the 14th century. Two theories however exist as to the origin of the present Turki population 1. That they are descended from these Turks and Mongols. 2. That they are descendents of the original inhabitants on whom the invaders imposed their language. Apart from the difference in language the great difference in mental and physical characteristics between Turki and Farsi suggests that there must at least be a considerable ad mixture of different blood in the former. These regions were devastated and depopulated by the invasions and probably the surviving remnants of the original population intermarried and were absorbed with their con querors. Turki landowners and peasantry alike are of good physique with broader faces and heavier build than the Farsi, and are sullen, boorish, uncivilized and fanatical, and the filth of their villages is worthy of their Mongol ancestors. They are bad tempered, vain, avaricious and distrustful of strangers. In short they possess the 2 bad without the redeeming qualities of the Farsi, whom they regard with antipathy as a foreigner. This feeling is reciprocated in the Persian slang expression 3 “You’re as big an ass as a Turk”. Farsi agents or servants are out of place in these districts. In districts where there is some admixture of Farsi with Turki, e.g., Kharagan and Khalajistan and the country traversed by the Tehran-Saveh- Hamadan road, the people are more amiable and these remarks are less applicable. 1 The ruins nt Snltameh 're the mausoleum of Khudabanda, the II Khan who founded this city in 1305 AD. 2 They are however comparatively free from the opium habit. 3 ' Tu be qadri Turk khar ye”.1 See page 94. 175 The Turk! origin of the Kajars from the province of Astara- had is one of the causes contributing to the unpopularity of the present djmasty. Muzaffar-ud-Din, when Valiahd, i. e., heir apparent, lived at Tabriz and on his succession to the throne he brought his Turki court to Tehran and Turk! influence was strong during his reign. At the present time some of the Tehran officials are natives of Tabriz, but in the Turki provinces in this area the officials are Tarsi. These Turks of Azarbaijan, being Shi’ah, are kept distinct from the Ottoman Turks by religious differences. They are accustomed to the use of arms, and take to military service more readily than the peaceful Farsi peasantry. The local Khans swagger with rifles and belts of cartridges, but, with their present lack of organisation and training, they are only ready to join a foray for loot and not for a stand up fight. They are treacherous and unreliable, and will only join the winning side and Major Wagstaffe’s mission sent by General Dunsterville along the Tabriz road against the Turks in 1918, found hastily raised local levies totally lacking in courage and quite useless. These are of Persian origin and the differences between Mazandarfini them and the Farsi are due to their geographical position, and GUakL shut away behind the Elburz, and to climatic rather than racial conditions. These differences however are very pronounced as soon as the 1 “ Secondary watershed to the North ” is passed, and the natives of the Caspian provinces are as different from the Farsi as their verdant forest clad country and its climate are different from the arid tawny hills and plains of ’Iraq. They are of medium height, of pale sallow complexion in striking contrast to their dark eyes and long and abundant black hair and beards, rice-eaters, anaemic, heavily infected with malaria, lazy, more religious and duller than the Farsi but less so than the Turki, timid, and as a result of the oppres sion of which they have been victims, afraid of strangers and more ready to disappear into the jungle than to assist them. To each other, however, they are kind. The use of opium is excessive, especially in Tunakabun and Lakijan and on an average 70 per cent, of the landowners and 30 per cent, of the peasantry are reported to be addicted to it.176 Armenians. ShFah Muham madanism. General. On the whole the Mazandaranls, especially the upper classes are more boorish, ignorant and unprogressive than the Gilakis who have been less isolated and brought more into contact with foreigners owing to the development of Enzali and of the Russian road from Gilan to Tehran. They live- in a land of plenty under easy conditions, and the hard work, such as digging and cleaning of irrigation canals and reservoirs, is done by oilmen who go down to the plains in winter. These are of better physique and easily distinguish able from 1 2 plain dwellers who do not migrate to the “ yailaq ” in summer, but are considered lazy by comparison with inhabi tants of the Plateau. Much of the work in rice and cotton cultivation is done by women and polygamy consequently prevails. Their houses are fairly clean and more roomy than the confined mud huts of the plateau and in many villages, espe cially in the lowlands, each house is detached and stands in its own vegetable garden. Armenians are mostly clerks, traders, winesellers, etc. They are better business men than the Persians and many of them are wealthy so that their influence is disproportionate to their numbers. They are niggardly and unpolished and lack the Persian charm of manner. The prominent work of Yeprim and other Armenians during the Persian revolution won the good will of the Persians, and the relations between Armenians and Persians had become friendly before 1914. During the war the Armenians naturally inclined to the Russians whereas the Persians, owing to their hatred of the Russians, forgot their old enmity with the Turks and sided with them, so that tension and suspicion were consequently engend ered between Armenians and Persians. The Persians share the Turkish dislike for Armenians on religious grounds and are jealous of their progress due to hard work. D.—Religion. The religion of Persia was 3 Zoroastrian and changed to Muhammadanism at the point of the sword by the Arab in vasion in the seventh century. Shah Isma’il, the founder of the Safavi dynasty in 1499, made the Shi’ah branch of Muham- 1 ‘ Ktibl ’ or ‘ yailaqi.’ a Qishlaqi. 3 At the present time a few Zoroastrians remain, mostly in Yazd. fisianism th ueaning “ sec conformists ” tlemselyes Si rfMnkmma At the pr lion of Kurc] fc tribes oi half Shi’ah, This scl early days The pr needed by Omar, am of Muhan Imam Hu; fftad’s om The Shi fflad and „ recogm ze l usurpers, a ^ invasion hook 6m, 10 656 by i All s two ® wluptuan Jtuavia to' „ 0tl Muafl in Kuf attenn IS tie 7 ea on th 6 j^'Aezidmadanism the national religion, Shi’ah being an Arabic word; meaning sectary”, i.e., they are Sectaries of Ali or “Non conformists as opposed to the orthodox branch who style* themselves Sunni, a name derived from the Sunnat “directions of Muhammad At the present time Persia is nearly all Shi’ah with the excep tion of Kurdistan, which is Sunni. In this North Western area the tribes of Talish in the North of Gilan, are half Sunni and half Shi’ah, and a few Sunni villages are found in Khalkhal. This schism between Shi’ah and Sunni took place in the early days of the Muhammadan religion. The prophet Muhammad died in 632 A. D. and was suc ceeded by 1 2 Caliphs, the first three of whom where Abu Bakhr,. Omar, and Othman, and the fourth Ali. Ali was the cousin of Muhammad, and married his daughter Fatima, who bore Imam Husain and Abbas, and was adopted as his son, Muham mad’s own sons having died in childhood. The Shi’ites maintain that Ali was nearest of kin to Muham mad and was nominated by him as his successor, and refuse to recognize Abu Bakhr, Omar, Othman whom they regard as usurpers, and Omar they execrate, probably on account cf his invasion of Iran and destruction of its religious and scientific books. Omar and Othman were both murdered and succeeded in 656 by Ali, the fourth Caliph. Ali’s two eldest sons were Hasan and Husain. Hasan was a voluptuary and on Ali’s death in 661 was intimidated by Muavia to relinquish his claim to the succession. Muavia had been appointed by Omar to the governorship of Syria,, and from 656 to 660 he had disputed the Caliphate with Ali. He now become Caliph, retaining Damascus as his capital, and the founder of the Umayyad dynasty. On Muavia’s death in 680 Husain, at the invitation of a party in Kufa, which had been the capital during Ali’s Cali phate, attempted a rebellion against Yezid, the son of Muavia. Husain marched with 70 followers from Medina to the plain of Kufa, the Kufis failed him and he and his party were anni hilated on the 10th Muharram by Shimr, the general sent by the pro-Yezid governor of Kufa to attack them. The city of Kerbela stands on the site where they died and contains the tomb of Husain. 1 Shi’at-ul-AH in Aratnc. 2 Khalifate liasiil-Ullah “ Successor ” or “ Vicar ” of the prophet of God.* Prof. Browne’s introduction to his edition of Nuqtatu-’l-Kaf, page 20- This was the last serious attempt of the house of All to recover the Caliphate. Husain, however, and his descendents were venerated by their adherents as “ Imams ”, or spiritual and temporal rulers and leaders by divine right as the hereditary successors of the Caliph Ali, wrongfully excluded from the Caliphate by the Umayyads and subsequent usurpers. In 873 the twelfth Imam Mahdi disappeared, and the Shi’ites believe that he will reappear on the day of judgment at the temple of Gauhar Shad at Meshed. They call him ‘ Sahib-i- Zaman,’ lord of time. The Safavi dynasty was descended from the house of Ali through the seventh Imam, Musa Qasim, and introduced Shi’ism as the national religion. The Shah was both saint and king. After the overthrow of the Safavis an attempt made by Nadir Shah to unite Shi’ah and Sunni was a failure. More recently Sultan Abdul Hamid of Turkey approached Nasir-ud-Din Shah with a view to the .latter’s recognising him as Caliph, but his overtures were rejected and the breach between Shi’ah and Sunni remained. This schism is not a mere question of names or persons but of principles. *“ That the prophet must have successors and Island a supreme head or pontiff is recognised by both parties, but as to the nature and method of selection of that head they differ widely. According to the Sunni view, any suitable candidate •chosen by the consensus of opinion of the Muslims is competent to become the Caliph. The Shi’ah, on the other hand, hold firmly to the principle that the Imam, or supreme pontiff of the Faith, must be a decen- dant of the prophet (which practically means a descendant of Fatima and Ali), and not only a descendant but a parti cular descendant, nominated explicitly by his predecessor, i.e., by the prophet in the case of the first Imam, and in the other cases by the preceding Imam. Thus the right of the Khalifa to rule depends on the will of the people, the right of the Imam on the will of God. To the Persians imbued as they were with the belief in the Divine Eight of Kings, and accustom ed from Sasanian times to regard their rulers as Divine beings, The Shi’ah theory of the Imamate was naturally the more acceptable, and it is in Persia that it has always had its strong hold.”179 The faithful adherence of the Persians to the house of All ■was probably also due to a belief that Imam Husain married a daughter of Yezdigird, the last of the Sasanian kings of Persia who was overthrown by the invading Arabs, and that conse quently his descendants were connected with the old royal house. The distinguishing tenets of Shiism accordingly are:— 1. Rejection of Abu Bakhr, Omar, and Othman the first three Caliphs, and of all the Caliphs subsequent to All. 2. Veneration of the house of AH, especially of Husain, the Rhird Imam, as a martyr for its cause, and of his descendants, the 9 other Imams, whom they regard as intercessors between man and God, and the heirs by divine right to the Caliphate. The Caliphs subsequent to AH, who are recognized by the Sunnis, they reject as usurpers. 3. The belief that the last, i.e., twelfth, Imam Mahdi will reappear on the day of the Judgment. Pending the reappearance of the 12th Imam his authority Religious is vested in the heads of the Shi’ah religion called 1 2 Mujtahids, jjj^rarehy, who study and interpret the Quran and the complicated reli gious laws to the people. Mujtahids are of 3 grades, and collec tively are termed “ Ulama”, the plural of “ alim ” learned. Different Mujtahids expound divergent views and have groups of “ 3 imitators” varying in numbers according to the eminence of the Mujtahid. The predominant position of a universally recognized expo under is seldom acquired by a Mujtahid in Persia. The 4 great Mujtahids, 4 5 or 6 in number, are Persians but reside in Najaf and Kerbela, and issue 5 epistles and 6 edicts. Their edict of excommunication, makes a man an ^unbeliever and a Mussul man acquires merit by killing him. 1 All is the first, Hasan the second Imam. 2 Mujtahid is the Shi’ah equivalent of “ Doctor of Divinity It denotes the possession of ‘ Ijtihad,’ which by derivation means a “ striving ” “effort ” “ (e./. ‘Jihad’ a ‘ striving for the cause ’ holy war)” and so a “ striving to acquire know ledge By usage it has come to denote the “ power of interpretation ” of the Quran and traditions, and Mujtahid is a man who by his own effort has himself acquired this power and does not need to consult others. 3 Muqalidin. 4 Hujjat-ul-Islam.

These Mujtahids have Religious schools and give Certificates to some of their 3 disciples, who are thereby ordained and may return to Persia as Mujtahids, the place they take there depending on the quality of their certificates and on their own abilities. They in turn collect imitators and pupils and give certificates for smaller Mujtahids and 4 Akhunds. They usually belong to the middle or poorer classes. Unless “ Saiyids ” or “ HajTs ” they are designated “ Shaikh ” (elder) and wear white Hurbans and long robes (caba). In each of the towns there are several Mujtahids and many Akhunds, one of the former generally being nominated Imam Ju’meh by the Government to officiate at the Friday prayers. He need not be, and in fact usually is not, the chief Mujtahid of the town as a Mujtahid’s influence depends on the popular confidence in him and recognition of his learning and sanctity, which are shaken rather than confirmed by association with the Government. In the country there is usually one Mujtabid to a group of 10 to 20 or more 'villages, i.e., he is a sort of bishop, and one or more Akhunds in each village. Another religious title found in most towns is Shaikh-ul- Islam, but in Persia it does not, as in Turkey, carry any special significance. The descendants of the prophet Muhammad form a separate religious class of “ Saiyids ” (lords), as distinct from the “ avam,” or common people, and may be distinguished by their black or green turbans and sashes. Their pedigree should be traceable back on the father's side to an Imam and so to Fatima the daughter of Muhammad and Ali. Bogus Saiyids with no genuine claim to this descent are very numerous. Darvishes are Avandering religious mendicants, who congre gate in winter in the towns of Mazandaran and Gilan, and in summer are scattered over the plateau. Their stock in trade is a leopard skin, a beggar’s bowl, and a show of religious asceticism, and they live by begging and giving recitations and conjuring performances under the stimulating influence of “ hashish 1 Madraseh. 2 Tasdiqnameh. 3 Talabeh. 4 Akhund is the Persian word equivalent to the Arabic “Mullah.” 'Mullah js also used in Persian but carries little religious significance.

Under the guise of “ Rauzehkhani ” meetings are often held for the furtherance of political propaganda, especially against the Anglo-Persian agreement of 1919. Great significance is attached to pilgrimages as a means Pilgrimages. ■of salvation. The places of pilgrimage, in order of sanctity are :— 1. Mecca. 2. *Kerbela, the tomb of Husain, and Najaf, the tomb of Ali. 3. Meshed, the tomb of Riza, the eighth Imam. 4. Qum, the tomb of Fatima-i-Ma’asum, sister of Imam Riza, daughter of Musa the 7th Imam. Pilgrims to the first three earn the titles of Haji, Kerbelal, and Meshedi respectively. Pilgrimage may be made by proxy. The souls of those buried in these sacred precincts are believed to gain the assistance of the saint to prompt them when interrogated by the angles Nakir and Munkir on the night after interment concerning the Imams and the principles of Islam, and to escape the risk of failure to answer these questions which involves chastisement by these angels until the day of resurrection. The Safavi dynasty, established by Shah Isma il in 1499 Relation of and overthrown by Afghan invaders in 1722, claimed descent jfiefarchy to from the Imams and were acknowledged as the religious as well temporal as the temporal leaders of Persia, but subsequent dynasties, government * set up by soldiers of fortune, were theoretically usurping and had no claim to such religious leadership. * Kerbela means “ sorrowful calamity182 Their Adminis trative and Public Func tions. The religious leaders became an independent power in the state looking to Najaf and Kerbela for guidance, and a check to the absolute power of the Shah and his representatives, the provincial governors. In 1892 the popular agitation which compelled Nasir-ud- Dln Shah to rescind the Tobacco Regie Monopoly was raised by a Mujtabid of Najaf. (See page 16.) In the Constitutional movement of 1906-1909 they played a prominent part. Their adhesion to Constitutionalism was due not to progressive ideals, which are inconsistent with the maintenance of their own position and corruption, but to their apprehension at the growth of foreign influence and financial control arising from the loans contracted by MuzafFar-ud-Din Shah from Russia and Great Britain. Shaikh Fazlullah Nuri, an influential Mujtahid of notor iously bad character and a supporter of Muhammad AH Shah, was arraigned before the Majlis and hanged in 1909, an event without parallel during the monarchical regime, and significant that the Constitutionalists would not be priest-ridden. In 1911 also Haji Mirza Abul Qasim, the Imam Ju’meh of Tehran,, was dismissed by the Constitutionalist leaders as a reactionary. Priestly sacrosanctity also did not protect Haji Mirza Muhsin, the most influential Mujtahid in Tehran, who was murdered in 1916 for being pro-British. At the present time the democratic party regards the priest hood as reactionary and has considerably lessened their in fluence in the cities, especially in Tehran, where the opening of schools and spread of education are incompatible with their old position. Persians generally are not fanatical nor prone to introduce religion into political issues, but the cry of religion, if once raised by the Mujtahids, is still a powerful weapon and silencer of opposition in the hands of a political party. The power of the clergy, although less than under the despotism, is still very great, especially in the country districts, and the fact that 40 per cent, of the members of the 3rd Majlis (1914-15) were clerics is testimony both to their influence and to their in terest in politics. The stronghold of the Mujtahids’ influence is their position as interpreters of the religious law “ Shar’ ”, which is the basis of judicial procedure in Persia. Under the despotism the customary or “Secular” law, “ Urf ”, was administered by the governors but all cases falling ritliin ie sc Mnctfrom * by tie govt Actions t si the mair Mutive po ffll adminis fe revoluti ffljoyed by tfgious lav kve becon officials are oases more decided by Tbis ne few large 1 the vilji Thejuo and giy m; ^7 afe M docnm Mran deedi for «gistrat Mature ft ^ additio !re wnsidere, 1J %ce and 1 ^out anv l a dditic J^ons the: Ws are ! a ‘do '''ifcccwithin the scope of the religious law, he., roughly “civil” as distinct from “ criminal” cases, were decided by the Mujtahids or by the governors in conjunction with them, the actual division of functions depending of course on the particular individuals, and the main check on the Mujtahids being their lack of any executive power. The codification of the law, the ministry and administration of justice (“adliyeh”), instituted since the revolution, have to some extent curtailed the' latitude enjoyed by the Mujtahids of adopting their exposition of the religious law to suit their own interests, but many Mujtahids have become officials in this administration and non-clerical officials are influenced by clerical pressure from outside. Many cases moreover are kept out of the law courts and are still decided by the arbitration of a Mujtabid. This new judicial procedure is limited to the towns and very few large tillages. In the country petty cases are still decided ' by the village Akhund. The judicial decisions of the Mujtahids are notoriously venal and given in favour of the higher bidder. They also act as lawyers in drawing up title Meeds and legal documents and dividing inheritances. In the city of Tehran deeds are drawn up by a Mu j tabid, but may be taken for registration at the Adliyeh. Elsewhere the Mujtahid’s signature finishes the transaction. In addition to these functions, which by non-Muhammadans are considered to be secular, the religious duties of marriage, divorce and burial are of course performed by the Mujtahids without any external interference. In addition to the fees and profits obtained from these Means of functions the religious classes prey on public charity and many Livelihood, Mujtahids are in receipt of pension from the Government, often as a ‘ douceur ’ to keep them quiet. The Muhammadan religion enjoins that offerings be made to Shaikhs and tithes of i to Saiyids at the end of Ramazan, and 4 payments for condonment of sins. These are no longer given as freely as formerly but in many villages the Akhund receives a yearly contribution of grain, etc. from each house- 1 2 3 1 i. e., those possessing “ Sulhiyeh the lowest grade of judicial officials who deal with petty cases. 2 Qabalehjat. 3 Taqsim-i-miras, Division of inheritances is made in accordance with the religious law on the proportion of one share for each son, a half share for each daughter, and } share for a wife.

These properties have been bequeathed by religious persons for the upkeep of a masjid, maintenance of religious schools or 4 rauzehkhani,’ or to be administered for the benefit of a town. Of the latter category “ qanats ” afford flagrant cases of peculation, the fees paid for water being pocketed by the Mujtahids while the “ qanats ” for the upkeep of which this money should be devoted, are left to fall into ruin. The ministry of Education and ecclesiastical properties established since the Revolution has failed to deal with these abuses. The religious seasons are Muharram, the first and Ramazan the 9th month of the Hajri, the uncorrected Arabic lunar year, so that these months occur at all seasons in turn. The Muharram celebrations are peculiar to the Shi’ah Sect and commemorate the anniversary of the events culminating in the slaughter of Imam Husain and all his follpwers on the plain of Kerbela on the 10th day. These first 10 days are termed I)aheh ” in Persian and ‘‘Ashra” in Arabic. During them “ taziyehkhanl ’ and “rauzehkhani” performances prevail. The climax is reached at noon of the 10th day, when numerous 3 processions are formed of 4 passion players, Mour ners, followers of Husain bareheaded, clad in white, carry ing swords or chains, with which they cut and beat them selves, and stained with blood, of 7 Arabs with the bier and led horse of Husain, a carrier pigeon, and the lion which protected his corpse, of Saiyids, of merchants, etc. A dummy representation of Omar used to be paraded for public execration and burned, but this practice called The killing of Omar ” was suppressed by the government out of respect for the feelings of the Sunni, who regard Omar as the second Caliph. 1 Auwqaf. 2 Vazarat-i-Mu’arif ve Auwqaf. 3 Dasteh. 1 Dasteh-i-taziyehkhanl. 6 Dasteh-i-smehzanI and dasteh-i-nauhehkhanl. , , 3 Dasteh-i-Shah Husainiha.

On the 10th of Safar also a few processions take place. The fast of Ramazan, the month during which the Quran Bamako was revealed to Muhammad from heaven, is obligatory on all Muhammadans, on boys of over 15 and girls of over 9 years of age, except sick persons and travellers, whose duty it is to fast for 30 days at the earliest subsequent opportunity. 1 2 . No food or water may be taken between sunrise and sunset, and in the towns a gun is usually fired at these times as a signal. Many upper class Persians break the fast in private, or travel to avoid it, and others sleep all day and spend the nights in feasting and gambling. The religious hold prayer meetings at night and read the Quran several times during the month. Among the poorer classes and in the country the fast is strictly observed, especially by the Turk! people, who keep it even when travelling. When the month of Ramazan occurs in summer, it calls for great endurance among the peasantry to work through the heat of the day without eating or drinking. New year’s day, 21st March, of the old Persian solar calender Aid-i-lTaurfiB. is a day of festivity and rejoicing, and receives a Muhammadan sanction by the tradition that it is the anniversary of Muham-, mad’s bestowal of the Caliphate on AIL The Shi’ah pray thrice daily, morning, noon, and sunset with arms and hands straight at their sides. A 1 piece of clay from Kerbela is placed on the prayermat and touched by the forehead at each prostration. The prayers are the same as those used by the Sunni, who however pray 5 times daily with folded arms. Friday is a public holiday, when offices and bazaars close, and gatherings are held in the mosques, but this Friday church going is not practised as much by Shi’ah as by Sunni Muham - madans. 2 Rosaries of beads are much used for counting blessings on Muhammad and his family after prayer, or curses on Abu Bakhr, Omar, Othman, and on Shimr, the slayer of Husain. 1 Mohr. 2 TasbI.Many Persians, chiefly of the lower classes, and in the country, wear a small 1 * 3 4 armlet usually red, blue or black on the upper arm. It contains a a prayer against misfortune. 3 Vows are often made to hold a ‘ rauzehkham ! or to give alms to the poor if a prayer is fulfilled. Superstitious practices, such as the medicinal use of holy water, and of water in which a charm has been dipped and the writing washed off, are common. The symbol of a hand is sometimes seen, for instance on .camel conveys. It represents the broken hand of Abbas, the brother of Husain, who died fighting at Kerbela with his sword between his teeth after both his hands had been hewn off, and invokes his protection against danger. • 4 Wives are limited to four, but there is no limit to the number of 5 concubines who may be married for a fixed period on con tract, a practice which fosters the growth of immorality. Among educated Persians polygamy is becoming the exception but many of the big landowners keep a separate family at each of their estates. The practice of the peasantry varies according to their means and the usefulness of women in different districts. In the Caspian provinces for instance, where most of the work in the rice fields is done by women, polygamy is very common. The 6 7 women’s apartments in the houses of the rich are kept in rigid seclusion and women in the towns, although they are said to have more liberty than formerly, all wear veils, which frequently serve as a disguise and facilitate intrigue. In the country districts women as a rule are not veiled and only turn away or cover their faces from strangers. In some parts, especially in Mazandaran, they do not appear shy and will converse with a traveller. 7 Divorce may be obtained by a husband at any time he pleases provided he has paid up the bride’s 8 money fixed in the wedding Contract. Children remain with the husband, who 1 Bazuband. s Du’a. 3 Nazi. 4 Aqd. 5 Sigha. • Andarun. 7 Talaqnameh. 8 Mehr. 8 Aqdnameh.187 must also pay the expenses of the wife for three months after the divorce. The only course for a woman desirous of divorce is to take refuge from her husband in the house of a Mujtahid and implore his protection. The position of women generally remains one of degrada tion. At worst they are regarded as chattels, at best as only half as good as a man.' The upper classes generally are lax in religious observances i rr eiigi 0n of and .drink alcohol. Upper classes. In the Muhammadan religion the use and abuse of alcohol are equally unlawful, and perhaps on the view that “when the water has gone over the head what matters it whether it be a fathom or a hundred fathom,” Persians, if they drink at all, drink to get drunk. •The townspeople except perhaps in Mazandaran are less religious than formerly, but the country folk, illiterate and isolated, scrupulously observe their religious obligations. All men outside the pale of Muhammadanism “ kharij-az- FeeIing toward|| Mazhab ” are 114 unclean,” and in theory it is lawful and Non-Muham- praise worthy to take the property of an unbeliever. In Foreigners, practice, however, Persians generally appear tolerant and well disposed to foreigners, an attitude due perhaps only to impotence to interfere with them, but, although generally less fanatical than Sunnis in India, they will not, like the Sunnis, permit Europeans to enter their masjids. Prom time to time anti-foreign agitations have been raised Anti-Foreig« by the Mujtahids, instance the agitation raised against the agitatl0ns tobacco regie in 1890, against the introduction of water supply through iron piping for Tehran 1890, against the use of sugar imported from Europe 1907. The first two agitations suc ceeded, and as the result of the third a sugar factory was started at Kahrizak, near Tehran on the Qum road. The sugar produced, however, was of inferior quality and the enter prise failed. As already narrated the adherence of the clerics to the Constitutional movement was inspired by anti-foreign motives, and they fostered opposition to the Anglo-Persian convention of 1919. The All Ilahis are a sect of Muhammadan dissenters who aU uahi. believe in successive incarnatiops of the Deity. They are &lt;$&gt; ISTajas.188 Bah&amp;'Iisra (formerly Known a* Bftbllsm). representatives of the old extreme Shi’ites and hold that All was a divine incarnation while Muhammad was his lawgiver. There are 2 groups {a) the Atish Begi, who are mainly in Dama vand, Tehran, Kazvin add Azarbaijan and (6) the Haft Tavanan of Kirmanshah, Luristan and Mosul. A considerable propor tion of the darvishes in Persia are All Ilahi. The AH Ilahls in this area are most numerous in the villages along the Damavand road, e.g. Bumahind and Rudahind, and among the Khwajahvand tribe of Kalardasht (but not in Pul and Kujur), among the tribes of Kazvin, and in Khalkhal. They do not as a rule make open profession of adhesion to the sect, which is not of any political importance. Various superstitious practices are attributed to them. This is a creed of recent origin which started in Persia. Its founder was Mlrza AH Muhammad, a young Saiyid,-of Shiraz and son of a grocer, born about 1820. m He was a disciple of Saiyid Qasim Rakhti at Kerbela and succeeded him as the leader of a sect of extreme Shi’ites, termed Shaikhis, who held that there must always exist an interme diary, the 4 Bab ’ or 4 gate,’ between the 12th Imam or Mahdi, who disappeared from the world, and the Shi’ites who await his return. After the death of Saiyid Qasim, Mirza AH Muham mad went to Bushire, where on 23rd May 1844 he declared his ‘ Manifestation ’ and claimed miraculous power. He was styled the ‘ Bab ’ in the above sense, and soon afterwards assumed the higher title of the “ Nuqteh ” or ‘ point.’ The * Bab ’ is, however, the name by which he is generally known. He began to preach at Bushire as a religious revivalist against the laxity, corruption, and worldliness of the ortho dox Shi’ah clergy. He attracted many followers, including prominent clergy, his fame spread rapidly and he was arrested at Shiraz in 1845 and remained in captivity during the greater part of his brief career (May 1844 to July 1850), at first at Shiraz, afterwards at Maku, and lastly at Chihriq in Azarbaijan. His disciples however carried on active propaganda through out Persia which resulted in several revolts against the Govern ment, especially after the death of Muhammad Shah and acces sion of Nasir-ud-Din in September 1848. The most serious of them occurred in Mazandaran, Zinjan, and Pars. In Mazan- daran, at the ruined shrine of Shaikh Tabarsi near Barfarush, Babi rebels led by Mulla Muhammad Husain AH of Barfarush and Mulla Husain of Bushravayeh defied the Shah’s troops for 1 montl teresubdue' The revo Bad Ali Ziii biged ur fe were nsings and By the Gou unflinching ■nous Pers' While Bab was in the hoj Bent, whi disastrous the soldie. unscathed, tBe asseznj hk escape i b to with an(! prirati 0 3Df f was lfi]]| .. ^edeat “Efforts of f en h but a f three Bal &lt;?! a fieri bran on tortures, pj. fea,ni ®t andfor 7 months, from December 1848 to July 1849, until tHey were subdued and their leaders put to death. The revolt at Zinjan under the leadership of Mulla Muham mad Ali Zinjani broke out in May 1850 and the town was beseiged until the following December, when the defending Babis were finally all exterminated by house to house fighting. Simultaneously a rising occurred at JSfiriz in Ears. In the risings and during the persecutions subsequently instituted by the Government, the Babis were inspired by a bravery and unflinching readiness to die of which the ordinarily pusillani mous Persian might well be thought incapable. While the Zinjan and Pars revolts were still in progress the Bab was taken from Chihriq to Tabriz for public execution in the hope that his death would end the movement. An acci dent, which occurred at his execution, might well have proved disastrous to the Shah’s Government, for the volley fired by the soldiers cut the ropes which bound the Bab and left him unscathed. Had he seized his opportunity and appealed to the assembled populace they would probably have acclaimed his escape as a miracle and the Government have been power less to withstand him. As it was, weakened by imprisonment and privations, he lost his presence of mind, attempted to escape and was killed. The death of the Bab and suppression of the rebellions ended the efforts of the Babis to offer armed resistance to the Govern ment, but a last attempt against the Government was made by three Babis to assassinate Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1852 and led to a fierce outbreak of persecution, and the execution in Tehran on 31st August of some 30 Babis after terrible tortures. From this time the Babis adopted a policy of con- ■cealment and secret propagandism. The Bab before his death nominated as his successor Mirza Yahya, a young man of Nur in Mazandaran, who escaped to Baghdad, where, under the title of Subh-i-Azal (Dawn of eter nity), he was the leader of the sect. In 1855, at the insti gation of the Persian Government who were alarmed at the successful propaganda of the sect among the Persian pilgrims, passing through Baghdad in great numbers on their way to' the Shi’ah holy places of Najaf and Kerbela, the Sultan of Turkey removed the Babis from Baghdad via Constantinople to Ad- rianople. Meanwhile Subh-i-Azal, although their nominal leader, had been leaving the management of affairs in the hands of hig snore active half brother Mirza Husain Ali entitled Baha’ullah190 (the Splendour of God) who in *1863 or 1866 declared himself to be “He whom God shall manifest,” whose advent had been prophesied by the Bab, and called on all Babis to recognize him. This claim was rejected by Subh-i-Azal and the Babis were divided into opposing factions of Azalis and Baha’is and a period of bitter faction ensued. In 1868, to put an end to dis turbances created by the dissensions between them, the Turkish Government removed the Azalis to Famagusta in Cyprus and. the Baha’is to Acre in Syria. Throughout this period they enduced severe hardships and rough treatment. The more conservative section of the Azalis soon dwindled to insigni ficance, and the majority of the Babis became Baha’is, while the Bab, who had originally been regarded as the author of a new dispensation, gradually fell into oblivion and was relegated to the position of the forerunner or “John the Baptist” to Baha’ullah the “Manifestation” of the Deity. Baha’ullah kindled extraordinary enthusiasm and devotion among his followers and the Bahais continued to proselytize and make many converts. Baha’ullah’s death at Acre on 16th May 1892 was followed by a fresh schism between two of his sons ; Abbas EJendi, or AbduT Baha, “the Servant of God,” and Muhammad Ali. Abdu’l Baha steadily gained ground until he secured universal recognition as the Expounder of the teach ing of Baha’ullah, for whose followers he issues Tablets. He isf now a venerable old man of most striking personality residing at Acre, whence he has made journeys to Europe and America and where during the war he was visited by numerous British 0 fficers. A few converts to Baha’iism have been made in America and other countries, but it is in Persia, the home of the sect, that it has achieved greatest success. For the last 40 years Baha’is have been immune from persecution by the Persian Government, but Shi’ah fanaticism inspired by the clergy resulted in outbreaks against them at various times, especially in 1903, in Yazd and various other towns of Persia. The most recent outbreak was at Sultanabad in 1920. The number of Baha’is in Persia has constantly increased, though not perhaps with the same rapidity as at the end of the 19th century, when it was anticipated that Baha’ism might soon oust Shi’ism as the principal religion of Persia. Owing to^the periodical persecutions at the hands of the Shi’ah Muhammadans, the majority of Baha’is, while having * The date is disputed hut the “ manifestation ” is generally considered to have taken place at Adrianople, and 1866 is the more probable. t Abdul Baha died December 1921. posable to numerous e neat depai Such is with a gui wery rema gaining s of a lew long esk tens.

They are, however, quite numerous and several men holding high positions in Govern ment departments are believed to be Baha’is. Such is the history of Babiism, an extreme sect of Shrah Muhammadanism, and of Baha’ism, which has superseded it with a guise of universality. It is of interest owing to its very remarkable spread in modern times as a new religion gaining some hundreds of thousands of converts in the course of a few years, whereas Christian missions, which have been long established in Persia, can only count their converts by tens. Its tenets, and, despite its recent origin, even the 1 history of their growth and change, are vague, undetermined, and conflicting, but its breadth and freedom from ritual and priestly hierarchy render it attractive. Its success is in part due to a religious revival and reaction against the fanaticism, corruption, and retrograde nature of orthodox Shi’ism and to its adaptation to the Persian mind, and also to the subtle mode of its attack. It makes no distinction of race and creed, but asserts the basic truth of all religions and the Manifestation of Baha’ullah as their consummation. The Divine unity is incomprehensible and can only be revealed to man through its ‘Manifestations.’ “Revelation is regarded as progressive and, as the human race progresses, a fuller measure of truth and ordinances more suitable to the age are vouchsafed.” All the great prophets and religious leaders of the world, in different parts of it and at different ages are all. regarded as “Manifestations,” and the most recent and most perfect “Manifestation,” whose recognition is the supreme duty of the age, is Baha’ullah. Its ethical teaching is compiled from other religions, chiefly Muhammadanism and Christianity, contains no novelties, and is full of vague aspirations towards the adoption of an universal language and universal brotherhood. Monogamy is not enforced, but the attitude of Baha’is towards women and their treatment of them is more enlightened than among the Muhammadans, although their “efforts to improve the social position of women hav£ been much exaggerated. ” Their intelligence and inte grity are above the average in Persia, and European officials employing Persians ceteris paribus usually prefer a Baha’i as more likely to prove reliable. 1 Due in part to deliberate falsification by the partisans of one or other side in the schisms which have occurred.As a community, although friends of reform, they did not identify themselves with the constitutional movement in Persia. Tney are, however, bitterly opposed to the intolerance of the Shl’ah priesthood, and, in contrast to its narrow anti-foreign attitude, they are willing to co-operate with foreigners for the establishment of better government in Persia and may conse quently be considered as pro-British. The free masonry existing between them makes them very useful as intelligence agents. E.—Languages. The three main languages are Farsi, Turki, Mazandarani and GllakI dialects, corresponding to the distribution of races as described in paragraph (c) above, the population of districts where two races meet being bilingual. Farsi is, however, the offi'hal and the only written language throughout the area. The Farsi spoken in different parts of the Farsi area has only very slight local differences, and a European with a know ledge of Persian never experiences any difficulty in understand ing or making himself understood either in town or country. TurM is the only language of the northern Turki districts and no Farsi is spoken or understood except by the upper class and a small proportion of the population of Zinjan. Further south, where the population becomes mixed, some Farsi is also understood, but it is more usual to find a Farsi with a know ledge of Turki than vice versa. The Turki of these parts differs considerably from Ottoman Turkish, and there is also consider able variation between the Turki of Azarbaijan and the Turki of the districts around Saveh. Mazandarani and Gilaki dialects vary considerably in different districts throughout the Caspian provinces. They are akin to Farsi in origin but have now become so distinct from it as to be quite incomprehensible to a man of Fars. Owing to the constant intercourse between people of the Caspian pro vinces and of the plateau, besides the local dialects of these provinces, the language of the adjacent Elburz or plateau districts is also generally understood, i.e. Farsi from Astarabad to the Safid Bud valley in Gilan, but north-west of this valley, where the Gilakis come into contact with the Turki people of Tarum, Turki begins to supersede Farsi, and in Talish verv little Farsi is understood. Besides these 3 main languages of the area the tribes men tioned in chapter VIII, which have been imported into it, retain their original Turki, Kurdi, Kirmanji, Luri or Lakk tongues, but have also learned the language of their neighbours.Administration.

Pre-Revolution. Previous to the revolution of 1906-9, the Shah of Persia, like the Sultan of Turkey, was a mediaeval despot, but in practice the Shah s power was less absolute as he possessed no religious authority and the Mujtahids, religious leaders, under the guid ance of Najaf and Kerbela were independent of him. Public opinion, as distinct from religious opinion, carried no weight, and government, legislative, executive, and judicial was performed by the Shah, the “king of kings”, and his 1 Vizir in Tehran, and by their nominees the governors in the provinces or Satrapies into which the country has been divided from time immemorial. The Government was carried on by “ the arbitrary exercise of authority by a series of units in a descending scale from the sovereign to the village £ kadkhuda,’ the only check on the lower officials being fear of their superiors, on the higher officials fear of the Shah, and on the Shah respect for foreign opinion.” The only democratic element in this regime was that the 2 Vizir was usually a man of 3 humble origin; to obviate danger 1 27 Subordinate Vizirs in Tehran possessed no initiative. 2 He often bore the title of Sadr-a’zam. 3 e.g. Mirza Taqi Khan, Amir-i-Nizam, who was Nasir-ud-Din Shah’s first and greatest Vizir, was the son of a cook.of his becoming too powerful and conspiring to overthrow his Sovereign. High office was not limited to men of noble birth, and newly ennobled men were freely admitted into the Persian aristocracy. The Vizir and provincial governors were individually re sponsible to the Shah, their tenure of office, preferment or de gradation depended on his pleasure, and he held unquestioned power of life and death over them. As recently as 1851 the fall of Amlr-i-Nizam was speedily followed by his execution. Concerning this regime Lord Curzon wrote: ‘ Persia is governed by a huge bureaucracy, in which cupidity, open, shameless and universal seems to have been raised into the guiding principle of human conduct.” Officials received no salaries. The whole administration of the country was farmed and their remuneration consisted in the pickings and stealings, u ‘ Mudakhil”, which they obtained. The provincial governorships were bartered to the Shah’s kinsmen or court favourites and the highest bidders, who would pay presents, “ PIshkash ”, to the Shah and Vizir to secure their appointments and further presents on 2 New Year’s day in the hope of retaining them during the ensuing year. Some governors of high rank remained as absentees in Tehran and sent deputies in their places. The incoming provincial governor was presented with an official statement or 3 tax roll showing the legal taxes and assessments, the military levies, the pays, pensions and grants for public works, and the amount surplus to the expenses of his provincial administration, which he was expected to furnish to the Imperial Treasury, On arrival in his province his ambition was to exploit it and make as much money as possible in the shortest time possible in order to make good his “ Pishkash ” expenses, pay the 4 dues to the Imperial Treasury and make his own “ Mudakhil. He farmed out the subordinate provincial posts on the same principle, and these minor officials squeezed the small men and peasantry on whom the whole burden finally fell. 1 They are called Mudakhil from the standpoint of the recipient, Pishkash (i.e., present to a superior) from the standpoint of the donor. s Aid-i-Nauruz, 21st March. * Kitabcheh. ... „ ^ * These were raised by taxation called “ Asl ” (root) or original revenue, ana the accretions, which were the governor’s perquisites (“ Haq-ul-Hukumen ), were called “ Par ” (off shoots). These varied from 1 to 5 or 6 krans for eacn tum&amp;n of the Asl.195 Sums allotted for the pay of troops and upkeep of public buildings were embezzled, and justice was as venal as the other functions of government. “The governor was tax collector and assessor, treasurer and paymaster, judge and administrator; an autocrat in his province save for appeal to the Capital from those strong enough or sufficiently powerful to make themselves heard there.” Another source of impoverishment of the country was the horde of princes. In Persia every son of a Shah is a * *prince, and every prince’s sons are princes and so on to infinity. Path AH Shah alone had more than 100 sons and the Kajar family generally has shown a “genius for paternity.” These princelings Avere hungry drones nurtured at the public expense. As the princes swarmed around the court and scrambled for official appointments, so each provincial governor was attended by numerous relatives and satellites, whose means of livelihood were the “mudakhil ” obtainable by the great man’s cortege. The criterion of good governorship in the eyes of the Shah was not the amelioration, contentment or prosperity of the province, but the absence of brigandage and the regular trans mission of the revenue to the Imperial Treasury. Similarly the provincials accounted worthy of praise a governor who was strong and maintained public Security. Until the assassination of 2 Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1896 a fair state of law and order existed in the provinces and the revenues were sufficient for the maintenance of the court and the expenses of government conducted on these lines. Such a system, however, could not last indefinitely, and moreover it depended entirely on the personality of the Sove reign and his nominees. The accession of the weak and extra vagant Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah, and the spread of Western ideas in the cities, caused its overthrow, and it is the fetish of “Mudakhil” and “ Pishkash,” the tyranny, injustice and ignorance of this regime that haA r e left such a disfiguring mark on the Persian character, and produced the confusion and incompetence which are prevalent to-day and threaten the existence of Persia as a nation.[-' * Stiahzadeh. * Various Reforms were attempted by Nasir-ud-DIn but all proved more or less abortive and the administration remained substantially unchanged until the revolution of 1906.POST REVOLUTION. f&amp;eory of Goastitation. JTba Shah. Cabinet Central Government (Tehran). The present administration is the outcome of the consti tution evolved during the revolutionary period 1906-1909. The central government in theory consists of the Shah, the cabinet of ministers, a senate and the Majlis or Parliament, and the division of powers and duties between them is defined as follows:— 1 he dynasty is guaranteed by the Constitution to the Kajar amily, and Sultan Ahmad, who succeeded his father Muham mad All on his compulsory abdication on 16th July 1909, is the 7th Shah of this dynasty. The Shah must belong to the Shi’ah faith, and his successor must be his eldest son, or next male heir in succession, whose mother was a Kajar princess. Before accession he must swear an oath of fidelity to the Constitution in presence of the Ministers, Senate, and Majlis, which must be assembled within 10 days of the Shah’s decease! Should the successor be a minor under 18 years of age, a 1 Regent who must take this oath, will be appointed. Decrees of the Majlis require the Shah’s signature. The Shah is not responsible to the Majlis and appoints his Prime Minister, who forms a Cabinet. He has no legis lative power, and his executive orders are not valid until counter-signed by the Minister concerned. Provincial governors are appointed by the Shah on the recommendation of the Cabinet. The Shah is commander in chief of the armed forces, and military rank and honours will be conferred by him in accord ance with the constitution. The declaration of peace and war will be pronounced by him on the authority of a decree of the Majlis. Coinage will be made in the Shah’s name. The Shah’s civil list will be in accordance with the consti tution. The executive power is a Cabinet comprising the following Ministers:— 1. Prime Minister (See below).

He directs the national post and Holograph services, and relations with foreign concessions. 9. Minister of Agriculture and Public Works. —He deals with mines, roads, public buildings and construc tions. 10 and 11. Ministers without portfolio, whose appointment is optional. Ministers must be Muhammadan and Persian born subjects. They need not be members of the Majlis. Near relatives of the reigning Shah are not eligible. Ministers must not be en gaged in trade or any private business during their tenure of office. The Cabinet is selected by the Prime Minister, who is called to office and dismissed by the Shah, but must act in accordance with the constitution and is responsible to the Majlis.

The Cabinet is collectively responsible for the actions of each Minister. The Ministers are executive officials, and have no legisla tive authority. The provincial governors are appointed by the Shah on their recommendation. Proposals for legislation emanating from Shah or Ministers must be made before the Senate. The Senate will consist of 60 members, 30 nominated by the Shah, 15 elected from the city of Tehran and 15 from the provinces. It can frame legislative proposals and submit them to the Majlis. Decrees of the Majlis go to the Senate, which may suggest amendments for the approval of the Majlis, but have no power to enforce amendments or reject a decree passed by the Majlis. The Senate may not originate financial proposals. The Legislative power is the Majlis, which will consist of 136 members, “ Vakils ”. The duration of the Majlis is two years from the date of its assembly and the presence in Tehran of not less than 79 members constitutes a quorum. Members must be Persian male subjects, literate, between 30 and 70 years of age, of good reputation, and Shi’ah Muhammadans with the exception of one representative for the Armenians and Chaldseans of Azarbaijan, one for the Southern Armenians, one for the Zoroastrians, and one for the Jews. Military and police officials, governors, uncles and brothers and sons of the reigning Shah, and notorious enemies of the Constitution are ineligible. Seats are supposed to be allotted to the provinces on a rough estimate of 1 seat for every 100,000 of the population, but actually one seat for every 50,000 would appear nearer the mark. The distribution of them within this area is included in the table of provinces at the end of the paragraphs on Provincial administration, pages 210-225. Vakils are elected by universal suffrage of Persian male citizens of over 20 years of age and 6 months’ residence in the •electoral area and of good reputation. The first Majlis 1906-1908 was composed largely of representatives of trade •guilds and recruited from Tehran. It was elected hurriedly and unsystematically as a rallying centre against royalist reactionaries. A committee appointed by Muhammad All Shah in 1909 drew up an electoral law with a system of election by two degrees. “ The elections are by two degrees, the meaning of which is that in the iparte wuher of pi Srst decree, theisebes t presentative The 2n( (hanged by rersal antfi: of its authc Majlis, the (Sectoral p “pocket 1 The* govemo nomina toitede are op Voting The legislafe the Sha Alls ment ds ensuing Cone Sneli «xecutii plete cc and ah Thi Piaetii °PP0S’ half t Sii all of the C ( *bonit June! by a ( lienee matuni ‘eiodu Bon l M •SJSu 199 in the quarters of a town or in the towns of an electoral district, a particular number of persons is chosen by the electors - then those persons, elected in the first degree, meet at the centre of the electoral district, and elect from among themselves the desired number; those elected in the second degree are the re presentatives ”. A property qualification was also laid down for the electors. The 2nd Mailis 1909-1911 was elected under these regulations. They were changed by the 2nd Majlis and the 3rd Majlis 1914-1915 was appointed by uni versal suffrage and direct election. The actual result baffled the expectations of its authors as the composition of the 3rd was less democratic than of the 2nd Mailis the enfranchisement of all the illiterate peasantry having placed the real electoral power in the hands of the landlords who controlled their estates as “ pocket boroughs The elections are held under arrangements of the provincial governors assisted by docal committees. Candidates are nominated by the political parties, voting papers are distri buted and placed by the voters in sealed ballot boxes, which are opened and the votes counted by the local committee. Voting is secret. The Majlis alone can alter the Constitution. It is the sole °* legislative authority, and the Cabinet, although appointed by the Shah, is responsible to it, and must resign at its direction. All supplies must be voted by the Majlis and each govern ment department must submit its proposed budget for the ensuing year 15 days before New Year’s day (21st March). Concessions must be ratifisd by the Mafjlis. Such is the theory of the Constitution which transferred the executive power from the Shah to the Cabinet, subject to com plete control by the Majlis, which is the source of all authority and alone can enact legislation. TheConstitn- This excellent paper system, however, is mutilated in tioiial Govern- practice. The Senate has never been assembled owing to the ment mPra*. opposition of the democrats, who regarded the nomination of half the Senate’s members by the Shah as anti-Constitutional. Since the revolution there have been three Majlis assembled Majlis, all of which came to a violent end. The first which framed the Constitution, was in session from 7th October 1906 until ♦bombarded out of existence by Muhammad Ah k.hah on 23rd June 1908, the second from 25th November 1909 until dissolved by a coup d'etat on 24th December 1911 to avoid the conse quences of further refusal to comply with the Russian ulti matums, the third from 7th July 1914 until the Turko-German ♦exodus from Tehran to Qum on 15th November 19R. Born of the revolution the Majlis were animated by strong party faction and were divided into numero us hostile groups , 1 1 Arruman-i-Nozzar. * Fofreferences to these events see index under heading of ‘ Majlis.’were lacking in discipline and self restraint and showed a ten dency to arrogate to themselves Executive as well as Legis lative power, which led to constant interpellation of the Cabinet Ministers resulting in friction and the resignation of the Cabinet. The first Majlis was the rallying point of the “ Constitutional ists” (or “Nationalists”) against the despotic and perfidious Muhammad Ali Shah. The second was divided into 3 parties, “Moderates ’ (Itidall), “Extremists” or “Democrats,” and “Neutrals” (Bitaraf). The “Moderates” were the most numerous and the “ Neutrals ” usually inclined to their side. The election of Nasr-ul-Mulk as Regent by 80 votes from these two parties against 40 votes of the “Democrats ” who were in opposition, is an indication of their voting strength. The “ Moderates ” advocated a policy of respect towards Russia and were lead by wealthy land-owning nobles like Sipah Salar and Farman Farma, who, although not a member of the Majlis, was a party leader. The leader of the “Democrats” was Taqizadeh until his excommunication by the Mujtahids of Kerbela and retirement to Europe, when he was succeeded by Sulaiman Mirza. The numerical preponderance of the “Moderates” was to some extent counterbalanced by the greater activity and noisy methods of the “ Democrats”. By its appointment and support of Mr. Shuster and his American staff with wide powers for financial control and organization and by the institution of the Swedish gendar merie, the record of this second Majlis must be reckoned as the most progressive in recent Persian history. The third Majlis on its assembly was divided into the same parties, but, as a result of the enfranchisement of the ignorant peasantry by the system of universal suffrage, the percentage of clergy had risen from less than 15 per cen : to 40 per cent of the deputies. The “ Neutrals ” were reduced to less than 25 per cent. Within a month, however, this Majlis entered on the troublo i as period of the war, the former party distinc tions were effaced and the question at issue was whether to throw in their lot with the allies or with the Turks and Germans. The resentment entertained by Persians against Russia, and against Great Britain as her close ally, was fanned by German intrigue and the “ Democrats ” became anti-ally “ Nationalists ” with the cry of “ Persia for the Persians.” The whole Majlis, with the exception of a few individuals, joined them and when menaced by the advance of Russian troops from Kazvin broke up, and the majority of its members evacuated Tehran with the Turks and Germans and their sympathizers, and left for Qum on 15tb November 1915.Since this date until the end of 1920 no Majlis has been assembled, and the Cabinet has shared the government with the Shah, while after the collapse of Russia and her disappearance as a factor in Persian politics in 1918, the British Minister, on whose financial aid they are dependent, has been the con trolling power behind them. Owing to the youth and inexperience of Sultan Ahmad Shah, Shm. the power has been chiefly vested in the Cabinet, but the Shah has, nevertheless, enjoyed greater latitude and opportunity of interference in the government than is allowed to him by the Constitution. The initiative in legislation lies with the Cabinet, and in the Cabinet, absence of the Majlis to give or refuse assent, the measures are promulgated by royal decree. The Cabinet under the presidency of the Prime Minister decides not only the weighty matters of state, but also a great mass of departmental detail. The Premier, besides guiding the general policy, often reserves to himself the conduct of im portant foreign or domestic questions, and sometimes takes direct charge of a department of state. His patronage extends to the more important official appointments such as envoys, ministers, governors, commissioners, etc. Cabinets have followed each other in quick succession and Break down of found their most stable support in the dominant foreign m- tkfnalregtoe, fluence of the day, and with the exception of the Cabinet of Vusiiq-ud-Dauelh who enjoyed British assistance and held office from August 1918 to June 1920, no Cabinet since 1914 has survived for more than 10 months, and their average tenure of office has been less than 6 months. During the war the Persians as a whole from their hatred of Russia forgot their old enmity with Turkey, and while powerless to prevent Russian troops entering Persia, they were ready to take German bribes and connive at Turkish violations of Persian neutrality. The Cabinet at Tehran, however, was usually dominated by the presence of Russian troops at Kazvln and at most could only be mildly pro-Turk, so its authority was disregarded in the provinces, with the result that the provincial revenues ceased to reach the Treasury, and the Government came to depend to an increasing extent on doles from Russia and Great Britain for its current expenses. Administrative paralysis pervades every branch of the Government. Elaborate rules for the procedure and organi zation of the ministerial departments exist on paper, but fewForeign Inter vention and Foreign Offi cials for assistance in administration. of them function. Each department has its separate staff, but there is no organized civil service and nomination and advancement of departmental officials fall to the minister concerned, who makes advantageous use of his power of pat ronage. Salaries for officials were introduced by the second Mailis, but they are quite inadequate; employment is uncertain and an ex-official awaiting appointment to a fresh post is not paid during the interim. The offices are over-staffed with greedy underworked offi cials and although peculation may not be practiced so openly or on such a grand scale as during the despotism, participants in it are more numerous and the administration remains corrupt and rotten. External conditions have been unfavourable to the success of the constitutional regime, Russia was opposed to it and foreign armies trespassed and fought on Persian territory from 1914 onwards, but in any case confusion was the inevitable result of the sudden transition from an Oriental bureaucratic to a Western democratic form of government for which the country was not ripe. The peasantry, who under the system of universal suffrage, constitute numerically the greater part of the electorate, are illiterate and have no conception of poli tical issues, members of the Majlis were unversed ^parlia mentary procedure and undisciplined, and ministers and officials lack integrity, experience, and practical ability and initiative, and are quite ignorant of principles of government and too vain to study them. The most damnatory testimony, however, of the unfitness of the country for this form of Constitutional Government was afforded by the non-assembly of the Majlis in 1920 at a time of national crisis, and the disinclination of members already elected to proceed- to Tehran m order to form a quorum. \s a result of the increasing disorder and incompetence, and of the financial indebtedness of the Persian Government since 1900 Russia and Great Britain became more engaged m the affairs of Persia, Russia with the deliberate purpose of securing a preponderant position in Northern Persia adjacent to her own Empire, and Great Britain from fear of Russian encroach ments and also because disorder m Southern Persia affected the frontiers of India. After the Anglo-Russian Convention concluded in August 1907 and recognized by the Persian Government as a condition of an advance of £200,000 made by Russia and Great Britain203 in 1912, which defined 1 Russian, British, and Neutral zones of influence in Persia and was intended to check the Anglo-Russian rivalry that was distracting the country, Russian activities were curtailed in Central and Southern Persia, but despite British diplomatic protests, Russia continued to exert pressure on the Tehran Government, and consolidated her influence until Northern Persia became virtually a Russian protectorate. Since the collapse of Russia, the Convention has been abro gated, and Great Britain has been the single predominant power in the whole of Persia, and has maintained a garrison along the Kirmanshah-Hamadan-Kazvin road to keep order in Northern Persia, and has supplied money to carry on the administration. The Persians so far recognize their own weakness, that from time to time they have sought the assistance of foreign advisers, some of whom have made an uphill struggle for reform but not a few have been content to drift with the tide. Since the beginning of the 19th century various Experiments have been made in engaging foreign officers to organize a military force. The most modern are the organization of Persian Cos sacks under Russian officers in 1879, a force which owing to Russian Government support lasted 3 longer than any other Persian force under foreign officers, and of the Gendarmerie under Swedish officers in 1911. This force expanded rapidly from 1911 to 1914, but on the outbreak of the war the regular Swedish officers were recalled to Sweden. Non-regular officers succeeded them, and in 1915 most of the Gendarmerie went over to the Turks and Germans. The present Gendarmerie is a resuscitation of the pre-war Gendarmerie, but has only three Swedish officers. Swedes also are employed in the Police. The South Persia Rifles with British officers and non-commissioned officers were a force raised by the British Government during the war, and not directly controlled by he Persian Government. In the department of Finance, the Customs have been organised and administered by Belgians since 1900. 4 19 * * 1 The RmUan zone was bounded by a line drawn from Qasr-i-Shmn, through Y&amp;zd and Kh&amp;kh to a point on the Persian frontier adjoining the intersection of the Russian and Afghan frontiers. The British zone was bounded by a line from Bandar Abbas through Kirman, Rirjand, and Gaziic to the Afghan frontier near Gazik. The boundary towns mentioned were included within the Russian and British zones respectively, and the neutral zone lay between them. a See Chapter Vf, p iges 23 -9. * The Russian officers and N\ C. Os were dismissed by the Persian Govern ment at the instance of the British in November 1920. * The full complement is 25.Belgians are employed (1920), and the Customs under their management are the principal reliable source of revenue of the Persian Government. M. Molitor is the Director. In 1911 Mr. Shuster, an American, was appointed to reform the Finances of Persia. He brought a small staff of American assistants, and was entrusted with very wide powers by a vote of the Majlis until dismissed after 8 months, in compliance with a Russian ultimatum to Persia. He was succeeded by M. Mornard, a Belgian, and Belgian Customs officials in the provinces were given charge of the Finances in addition to the Customs, until 1916 when the Finan cial administration was finally withdrawn from Belgian control. Frenchmen are employed as instructors in the Dar-ul-Funun. The full complement is 10, comprising 5 for Law, 1 for Medicine, 1 for Surgery, 1 for Physics, 1 for Mathematics, and 1 for Biology. The Dar-ul-Funun (Abode of Learning), or Ecole Polytechnique, was founded in Tehran by AS sir- ud-Din Shah. Faculties of Law and Medicine have been subsequent additions. A graduate of the school has attained a standard of education equivalent to that of an Indian Secondary School. There are some 400 pupils of about 13 to 18 years of age. Admittance is by entrance examination, and no fees are charged except perhaps a ‘ douceur ' for the examiners. The Faculties of Law and Medicine have a 5 years’ course. Each is attended by some 60 students who have graduated from the school. The Medical School is mentioned in para. 69 of the report of the Anglo-Persian Military Commission, 1920. “ Students undergo a five years’ course of purely theoretical instruction, yhere is no dissection, histology, bacteri 1 gy, or regular classes of clinical medicine. In short, at the end of his 5 vears’ study, the student has no practical Knowledge or experience.” Add to this the lectures in Law and Medicine are all id French, and only partly intelligble to the audience. Mr. Hew, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, is employed in the Persian Telegraph Administration, and M. Molitor, a brother cf the Director of Customs, is Director of the Postal Services. The staffs of these departments are all Persian and Arroeman. The relation of foreign advisers and officials in a Persian Department to its Ministerial chief is difficult, as, unless entrusted with wide eve utive powers, their work is thwarted, and they are subjected to various petty annoyances, and on the other hand a Persian Minister, how ever, incompetent, is not resigned to become a figure head, take his salary, and abandon ‘Mudakhil.’ The official classes of Persians have grown so accustomed in the past to obtain money without effort from Great Britain, Russia, and 1 Germany, that puffed up with an exaggerated idea of the importance of their country to these foreign powers they cannot, or will not, realize this source of supply will fail in the future, and a continuation of their darling policy of 1 i. e. By German bribes which were freely administered during the war. The Persian Government never received any loan from Germany,‘ laissez faire ’ become impossible, and they are secretly averse to the appointment of foreign officials who will fight against the peculation on which they have been battening. The better meaning among them are honest cowards who fear popular opinion, and have not the courage to inform the people of the breakdown of Persia’s finances, and the more unscru pulous are audacious thieves. The people generally, while devoid of any lofty ideal of patriotism and self sacrifice, and cowSd by any show of force, have a national feeling and dread of loss of independence and of foreign control which renders them, so long as they are free agents, more disposed to appoint foreign officials who are nationals of a small or distant state than nationals of a power ful neighbour, who they fear will use such officials as agents for promoting foreign political interests in Persia. An example of this attitude is afforded by the changed feeling displayed in 1919-20 by Persians towards their old enemies, the Russians of the old regime ( e. g., Sardar Starosselsky of the Cossack division, who had no longer a country behind them, and were regarded as individuals with no dangerous national ambitions. The most far reaching move in the direction of foreign assistance was the Anglo-Persian Agreement concluded by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet in August 1919. This Agreement, however, aroused considerable national opposition, and not being constitutionally valid until approved by the Majlis, was shelved by Mushir-ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet, which succeeded Vusuq-ud-Dauleh in June 1920, and the British advisers and officers who had commenced work in Tehran were ordered to desist. Bankrupt and dependant on the monetary subsidy from Great Britain, which will cease in the near future, devoid of military forces and threatened by the Bolsheviks, destitute of organizers Avho can reform the administration and place it on a sound basis, the future of Persia is critical, and further procrastination and vacillation point to disaster. Provincial Administration. Under the Constitution, the diminution of the power of the Shah in the central government, has been accompanied by a diminution in the powers of the Governors in the provinces, but to a lesser extent. The “ Anjuman,” locally elected committees, which were formed during the revolutionary period, to advise and control General Ad* ministration 0 { Province*.the Governors, have lapsed, but the Ministerial Departments in Tehran now have branches in the principal provincial towns. The officials of the financial and judicial departments, of gendarmerie, police and education, form a sort of provincial cabinet under the presidency of the Governor, but they also correspond direct with their departments at Tehran, and are responsible to them. The Governor has no right of interference in their work, and his ability to control their policy depends on his individual personality and influence. A powerful Governor may secure the appointment of his own dependants to these posts but in some cases, especially in provinces near to Tehran, the de facto power passes into the hands of the financial and gendarmerie officers, and the Governor becomes a mere figure-head. The greatest blow to the Governors was the establishment between 1911 and 1914 by Mr. Shuster, and Monsieur Mornard his successor as Treasurer General, of an independent and centralized financial administration. , The provincial revenues no longer pass through the hands of the Governor and he is only authorized to draw from the financial official the sums specified in a budget sanctioned for him from Tehran and which includes a fixed salary for himself. Budgets are similarly sanctioned for the other departments, and the officials in charge draw the money allotted to them in the same way. The opportunities of Governors and deputy Governors for “ Mudakhil ” and patronage are consequently diminished, unless they can come to terms with the “ Rais-i- Maliyeh ” (Chief of Finance). The tenure of office of Governors and others remains un certain and is dependent on the pleasure of the Tehran Cabinet. Deputy Governors are appointed by Governors subject to the approval of the Minister of the Interior, and the G overnors, in common with other officials, when possible introduce their own relatives and dependents to subordinate posts. Salaries have been fixed for 1 most officials, but many of them are quite inadequate and require supplementing by “ Mudakhil ” and uncertainty as to the probable duration of his employment is a further incentive to an official to make hay while the sun shines. The appointment of responsible officials for separate branches of the administration is a progressive step, but at present, the officials are too prone to intrigue against each other, especially 1 Many Deputy Governors are still unpaid.207 if they happen to possess influence at Tehran, with the result that lack of co-operation and control ensues. This tendency is fostered by the lack of confidence m their officials exhibited by the Persian Government, who, for instance, require the ‘Chief of Telegraphs’ in each province to wire to Tehran confidential situation reports on the state of the province, behaviour of the Governor, etc. The spread of education and democratic and Western ideas in the towns, the institution of post and telegraph services, which enable provincials to make themselves heard at Tehran and the Government to be kept informed of events m the provinces, the multiplication of officials with fixed salaries and the limitation of their powers have reduced arbitrary misgovernment and official rapacity in the provinces during recent years. The same defects, however, of ignorance, incompetence, inertia, and corruption which pervade the central government extend of course also to the provinces. Energetic measures to develop and improve a province to combat disease and famine are unknown, the absence of disorder and regular transmission of the revenue still con titute the standard of successful provincial administration a standard frequently unattainable at the present time. The country is divided into provinces as under the despotism, Provincial^ the four great provinces of Azarbaijan, Ears, Khoiasan, and indetail . Kirman being called l£ Ayalat,’ under governors General, and tffis smaller provinces being called - Vilayat,’ under governors and divided into three or four classes according to then siz and importance. These provinces vary greatly in extent and grouping. v o or more of them are sometimes grouped together to form a sing e governorship under some powerful personage for instance Ramadan and Kirmanshah, which were united m 1920 under 8arim-ud-Dauleh. Similarly the ‘vilayat’ of Khamseh was temporarily attached to the ‘ayalat’ of Azarbaijan ^ 191 .9 fol the gratification of Sipah Salar, and Am-ud-Dauleh, his successor. Provincial boundaries are ill defined and fiequently i plur Ayalat and Vilayat. Gilan is sometimes given the complimentary “ Farman Farma, Governors o__ » ^.^^1 „ (pi llr . Hukam). “Hukumat” mfans™ Government 'of dther ‘ Ayalat ’ or ‘ Vilayat/ but sometimes is restrict* ed to the letterschanged, and officials are often unaware whether a particular ■village is in their own oi’ in the adjacent province. Provinces are sub-divided into districts under Deputy Governors 2 (Naib-ul-Hukumeh), which consist of Buluks, each Buluk comprising from 6 to 60 or more villages ( 3 Deh or Mahal). In addition to the Deputy Governors, judicial officials of the lowest grade (Sulhiyeh) with power to settle cases involv ing not more than 250 tumans have lately been appointed to some districts, especially in the dependencies of Tehran. . r ^ lc Buffik is usually only a name, the administrative unit being the village with its “ Kadkhuda,” who is appointed by the landlord (Arbab), usually in consultation with the peasantry, and is the former’s agent for the collection of his rent. If ownership is divided between two or more landlords, a separate “Kadkhuda” is appointed for each of the different properties, and in villages divided into small holdings, the “Kadkhuda” is* appointed by the Government as agent for the collection of tne land tax (Maliat). In the former case he is supposed to be paid by the landowner, in the latter by . the Government, but he has besides considerable opportunities of Mudakhil! He is also held responsible for providing supplies, lodging, etc.' required by government troops or officials, and in these respects acts as “ Headman ”. In addition to a “ Kadkhuda, many of the larger villages appoint as their representatives a number of Elders, “ Rlsh Safid,” grey beards, or “ Plr-i-Mardha ”, (old men), who take the side of the villagers in the event of dispute between vil lagers and “ Kadkhuda ” or landlord. In country districts at a distance from towns, from governors and deputy governors, and from the main routes where gen darme posts have recently been established, permanent orga nized government hardly exists. The provincial governor represents government in his capital, and rarely, if ever, leaves it, deputy governors seldom tour through their districts, and out .. n ? name i n p ,7 sian to express these districts, and they are termed the Buluks of so and so , e. g., Bulukat-i-Nur, the district of Nur. In some provinces only the more important areas are grouped into deputy governorshins the remaining areas possessing no representative of government 1 “ The y ar t e ‘.- Naib-ul-Hukumeh ” as deputies of the Governor General or Governor but within their own districts are called “ hakim They used to be t™* -V' 1 ' ’ I 161,8 ? 11 ln ^arge, or plural “ Umal,” but this term is becoming obsolete. Zabit also is occasionally used. s 1 mu largc vi l lage whic ] 1 Just f ills short of being a town is called “ Qasabeh Ihese gendarme posts besides keeping order, dispose of petty judicial cases,209 of the way villages are only visited by 144 Tahsildars,” revenue officials, who may come once or twice a year to collect the Mallat. The nearest approach to permanent officials in such parts are the district Mujtahid and village Akhund, wdio conduct marriage and burial ceremonies, draw up and countersign all (feeds, etc., and settle disputes between the villagers. Only serious cases are taken to the nearest authority'for settlement. The chief power in the country side are the big landlords, who own the greater part of the soil, and the feudal conception of obedient submission to the Seigneur is still very strong among the peasantry (ra’ayat). 1 * * * 5 1 Landowners pay their ‘ inaliat ’ in the towns, and “tahsildars’’ usually only visit villages owned by small holders where they collect the ‘ maliat ’ direct from the “ Kadkhuda.” 1 The landlords are a class of oppressive parasites, putting nothing into the land, and devouring the lion’s share of the produce. They are often absentees, and squander in the towns the money extracted by their agents (mubashir) from the toiling peasantry. In parts of the plateau section, the harvest is divided into 5 shares, for the land, for the water, for the seed, for the oxen which plough, for the labour. The first :i are usually the property of the landlord, the last two of the peasantry. In Khamseh. however, the landlord’s share averages \. In Gilan and Mazan- daran rent is paid in rice, a fixed quantity for every ‘ jarib ’ of land cultivated, which on an average works out at about I of the harvest in Mazandaran, and more in Gilan. (See Chap. VII, para, (d) Agriculture, pp. 285, 287-8.) Landlords frequently obtain more than their legitimate share, and in addition to this rent, take fruit, poultry, cheese, fuel, etc., called “ barkhaneh.” The land lord’s-rent is called maliat-i-arbabi as distinct from the government land tax, maliat-i-divani, which is paid by the landlord. The peasantry, with the excep tion of an annual poll tax of a few krans per head in a few districts, pay no taxes direct to government. The land tax is mentioned on page 280. In some cases at is found out of the rent paid to the landlord, and in others it is set aside on the threshing floor before the division of the harvest between the landlord and peasantry. In both cases it reaches Government through the landlord’s hands.227 The above are secured on all the Customs revenues excepting those of Fars and the Gulf Ports. Since the Russian revolution these debts have been in abeyance and the Persian Government have received from the Soviet Government an expression of views indicating that they consider these debts cancelled. In addition to these debts to Great Britain and Russia con tracted by the Persian Government, there are claims of private firms and individuals for damage and losses sustained which at the present time certainly amount to £1,500,000. To summarise the position briefly, the Persian Government to free itself of its present indebtedness including past due interest would have to raise a sum of about £14,500,000. Prior to 1900 Persia had no foreign debt. From 1900 to 1914 she contracted a foreign debt of about £6,800,000, roughly £500,000 per annum. From 1915 to 1917, taking into account military expenses paid, the help afforded exceeded £500,000 per annum. From 1918 to 1920 the debt increased at the rate of about £2,000,000, per annum in advances from the British Government. No part of this sum has been expended on reproductive work. There is therefore a serious recurring and constantly increasing annual deficit to be made good, and unless reorgan ized and made self-supporting the current administration cannot be carried on without foreign financial assistance. .The advances from Great Britain have ceased and the loan of £2,000,000 specified in the Anglo-Persian agreement has lapsed with the agreement. No other foreign power is likely to advance money to Persia with inadequate security and a certainty that it would be ex pended as prodigally as the sums advanced in the past by Great Britain and Russia. The Persians have proved their incapacity to reform the administration without foreign ad visers and Persia is threatened with bankruptcy and chaos. No statistics of the total yearly revenue and expenditure are available, but it is estimated that under careful and efficient administration Persia could soon expect a yearly revenue of 1 The expenditure has been increasing and receipts decreasing.228 Financial Administration Theory. 1 150,000,000, krans, which might be further increased after 5 or 6 years to 235,000,000 krans.

In the opinion of* Englishmen, who had had access to financial offices during 1920, their arrangements are chaotic and an orgy of peculation prevails. The provincial chiefs of Finance ’ were required by Mr. Revenues. Shuster to transfer to Tehran all revenue immediately on collection and payments for provincial expenses were disbursed subsequently from the Treasury. This system was changed by M. Mornard and provincial budgets were formed to be paid out of the provincial finances without further sanction, and only the excess receipts were forwarded to Tehran. The falling off in receipts and the increase of expenditure have been mentioned above. The most ^Important sources of revenue are : 1. 2 Land tax and 3 erown lands. 2. Customs. 3. Opium and tobacco excise duties. 4. Posts and Telegraphs, leases for concessions, etc. 1. Land Tax and Crown Lands. No statistics ever have been or could be p blished to show the amounts derived from the 2 land tax, which has always been the principal source of revenue in Persia, and from the 3 crown lands. Several minor taxes exist, including an cart or animal entering a town gate. 1 Maliat-i-arazi. * Rhaliseh. octroi charge (navaqil) on every230 L »ndtax. ftown lands. The land tax is paid by the landlord according to an anti quated assessment, which in some districts has not been revised for a century with the result that great inequalities exist, and the State is the loser. Some formerly flourishing villages have fallen on bad times and the tax has been lessened, while other villages, which have become populous since the assessment, continue to pay the original amount. In some districts, notably in Mazandaran, the 1 2 land tax was remitted in return for military service performed by the inhabitants, but although no military contingents have been furnished for many years the landowners still pay no tax. The land tax was assessed at a certain proportion of the produce and, except in pastoral areas where cash payments were fixed per head'of sheep and cattle, it was generally pay able in kind. This payment in kind has in many cases been commuted to cash, and its amount has often been reduced in the process as the official in return for a ‘•plshkash’ 1 from the landlord would defraud the State by commuting it at a rate below the market value of the grain. While the price of grain has risen greatly during recent years the land tax, once commuted into cash, has remained stationary and the proportion which it bears to the total income derived by the landlord from his peasantry, who pay their rent in kind, is consequently less. It is impossible to estimate this proportion accurately, but it probably averages between 3 and do- Apart from holders of land on this feudal tenure, some great landowners, notably Sipah Salar, evade payment of any land tax and are too powerful and influential to be brought to book. Crown lands are found in many parts of this area and are of two kinds :— 1. Khdliseh-i-Daulati .—Crown lands let out to tenants who pay rent to the State as to a private landowner. The revenues of some of these lands also have been ^assigned for the maintenance of soldiers or to individuals. 2 , tliei over at a ink 19(3 aw •hi to * « i ii 1 tl P Tl of loi J G a V ti 1 v c 1 i 1 The peasant with few exceptions is only taxed in villages divided into small holdings. ,, . , s The ‘ mallat ’ of such districts was said to be ‘ tuyul for the maintenance of the soldiers. ,. „ . . - 3 In Mazandaran in 1919 an attempt was made by the chief of finance to make a fresh assessment on the basis of T V (ushr), and his estimate that this assessment would bring a considerable increase of revenue was corroborated by the outcry aroused. “ See also rents,” * i. e. made ‘ tuyul.’2. Khdliseh-i-intiqdll .—These are crown lands which before the revolution were for some l * 3 reason sold or permanently made over to the occupier, who in return pays a yearly tax to the State at a higher rate than the ordinary land tax. The ‘ maliat ’ of both kinds of crown lands is often paid in kind, and a considerable portion of the food supply of Tehran is derived from the ‘ maliat ’ of crown lands in Khar, Varamin, and Shahriyar. 2. Customs. Until 1898 all the Customs of Persia were farmed out to the stem b. highest bidder who made as much as he could out of them to the detriment of trade. Europeans refused to pay more than the 5% ad valorem duty stipulated in the treaty of Turko- manchai, but native traders were frequently mulcted. In 1899 the Customs of Tabriz and Kirmanshah were placed under control of officials lent by the Belgian Government. The experiment proved such a financial success that in 1900 the farm system was finally abolished and all the Customs of Persia were handed over to M. Nans and a staff of Belgians. The Customs became the most lucrative and Reliable source of revenue in the country, and formed the chief security for loans borrowed by the Persian Government from Russia and 3 Great Britain. In 1903 in place of the old 5% ad valorem of Turkomanchai, a new tariff favourable to Russia was established [see Chapter VII, paragraph (a)] which was abolished in April 1920 for the tariff drawn up by the Anglo-Persian Customs Commission, which reduced the excessive duty on tea, levelled up the duty on articles of special interest to Russian trade which had been undertaxed, imposed an exceptionally heavy duty on sugar and increased the duties on most articles. The new duties are designed to produce, in a normal year, a revenue more than double the highest pre-war revenue. In 1912-13 the total Customs statistics for the whole of Persia were :— Krans. Total receipts 43,126,125 „ expenses 4,691,245 Excess of receipts 38,434,879 1 Often the pecuniary advantage of the provincial governor. 1 “ Reliable ” because unlike the land tax the excess receipts were paid direct to the Persian Government and were not frittered away in the provinces 3 Other securities for British loans of 1910 and 1911 were Posts and Tele graphs, Caspian Sea fisheries.232 Poet* and Tele- gapbs. Leases, «*e, Banking, In 1918-19 owing to the cessation of Russian trade the figures had fallen to:— Krans. Total receipts „ expenses Excess of receipts . . 30,075,879 . 5,066,086 . 25,009,793 3. Opium and Tobacco Excise Duties. Opium is taxed at 21 shahis per misqal in areas where the Government is strong enough to levy it, elsewhere at 6 shahis. Tobacco for the kalian is taxed 30% ad valorem, for pipe and cigarettes 20% ad valorem. The administration is being re-organized and it is estimated that the total receipts may perhaps, amount to 20,000,000 krans and expenditure to 5,270,000, i.e. an excess of receipts over expenditure of 14,000,000 to 15,000,000 krans. 4. Posts and Telegraphs, Leases for Concessions, etc. The Postal and Telegraphic administration is described in Chapter 10, paragraph (d), pages 458-466. The statistics for the Posts show a profit of 1,189,294 krans in 1917-18, but debits of 702,483 krans in 1917-18 and of 1,809,678 krans in 1918-19. , , , The Persian Telegraph administration is stated to have yielded a profit of 4,270,171 krans in 1919-20 In_ addition the Persian Government expects about 1 1,500,000 krans as its dues from the Indo-European Telegraph Department under the heading; of the 2 Annual Terminal Account, and also receives from the Department an Annual Jask Royalty of 30,000 krans. Lionosoff Bros, until 1918 were paying 450,000 francs (£18,000) for their Caspian Fishery Concession. Vari ms other rents for concessions are paid to the Persian Government, e.g., concessions for oil, roads, coal mines, tele phones, etc., but it is impossible to estimate their amount. The Anglo-Persian Oil Coy. paid £1,000,000 to the Persian Government in 1920. The Imperial Bank of Persia has established a virtual mono poly of banking in Persia. See Chapter VII, paragraph (c„ page 269. . 1 The amount for 1916-17 was 1,907,892 krans. „ „ 1917-18 „ 1,590,629 „ 1918-19 „ 2,636,485 „ * See page 455. s SeeC wasap to wh suboic Ju religi&lt; and a of fc and bet’ whi to f and direi senti of a; , T inten tbeir pora] gene info 5 sani tbe: % the or and and con Got and execSee Chapter VI. Before the revolution a Vizir of Justice (Vazxr-i-Adliyeh) was appointed in Tehran, but he was merely an individual judge to whom commercial cases were referred and was entirely subordinate to the Grand Vizir (Sadr A’zam). Justice was divided into two branches, the “ Shar”, i.e., religious law based on the Quran, commentaries, and traditions, and administered by the Mujtahids, and the “ Urf,” i.e., secular law based on custom and uncodified, and on the treaty rights of foreign subjects, which was administered by the governors. The “ Shar’ ” in a Muhammadan country has a very wide and elastic scope and no hard and fast division can be made between cases which should fall under the “ Shar’” and cases which should fall under “Urf,” but “ Shar’” may roughly be said to embrace “ Civil ” with the exception of commercial cases and “Urf” “Criminal” cases of assault, robbery, etc., which directly affect the Government (although technically the death sentence could only be inflicted in accordance with the ‘ fatvah * of a mujtahid) and commercial cases. The Mujtahids act as wardens of the temporal and spiritual interests of religion as expressed in the “ Shar and declared their approval or ban of the laws and regulations of the tem poral powers on the standard of their conformity with or diver gence from it. The power of Mujtahids depends on the personal influence they have acquired from the recognition of their sanctity and learning by the populace, who regarded them as their protectors against governmental oppression. The most influential Mujtahids are called “ hakim-i-shar’”. The people voluntarily had recourse to them as judges and their verdicts were taken to the governors for execution. Mujtahids consequently possessed no legal civil power or authority and the judicial procedure rested on practice, and it follows that the division of jurisdiction between Governor and Mujtahids depended on the personality of the individuals concerned and a good deal of overlapping resulted. A strong Governor might decide that doubtful cases belonged to “ Urf ” and deal with them himself and even refer back a Mujtahid’s verdict for reconsideration or amendment, or the positions might be reversed and a very influential Mujtahid would concern himself with most judicial cases and the Governor become his executive agent.

After the revolution it was desired to set up Law Courts on a European pattern and courts were established and a code drawn up by Mushir-ud-JDauleh between 1909 and 1911. The Ministry of Justice is divided into 3 main branches. 1. The Minister’s Cabinet and Personnel, which is concerned with appointments and general administration of the Depart ment. 2. Of Judicial Affairs, concerned with the supervision of the administration of Justice, investigation of complaints, etc. 3. Of Judicial Accounts. The different Law Courts are shown in the following table:— 1. Supreme Court of Appeal (tamiz) in Tehran. 2. Court of Appeal (Istinaf) in Tehran an aijan, Tars, k horasan, and Kirman, in 3. Court of First instance. —(Ibtidai) for Civil and Commercial cases (Huquq Ye Tijarat) beyond the jurisdiction of No. 5. These are instituted in all the principal towns and the judge is the provincial “ Chief of Justice.” (Kais-i-Adiiyeh). the 4 great provinces (Ayalat) of Azarb- Gilan, and in Hamadan for the West. 4. Criminal Court. —(Jazai, punish ment) deals with petty offences, assault, killing (khilaf, Junheh, Janayat) and can pass the death sentence. This court is established in Tehran. In the provinces such cases often still fall within the juris diction of provincial governors and gendarmerie, or they may be referred to Tehran or a special court convened. 5. Petty Court (Sulhlyeh). —It deals with minor civil cases to avoid congestion in Court No. 4, and can inflict a fine up to 250 tumans, and imprisonment up to 1 month. Trivial cases, involving a fine or claim up to 20 tumans, are dealt with in the Police Stations. “ Sulhiyeh ” have recently been instituted, in some rural districts, especially in the dependencies of Tehran—a quite useless increase in expenditure leaving the deputy-Governor, who formerly acted as judge, with less work than ever. The personnel of each of these courts consists of one Judge who tries the case himself and delivers the verdict, with one or more assistants, secretaries, etc. In the Petty Court, No 5, besides the Judge there is also an Akhund to settle cases within the scope of the “ SharV’ In Tehran a ‘ Mudda’i-ul-Umum,’ with the role in some cases of public prosecutor and in others of public pleader or umpire functions in the Supreme Court of Appeal, No. 1, and has re presentatives in other courts. It is his duty to watch the conduct of all cases in which public interests are concerned.•e.g., cases involving public money, religious endowments, or phans, bankruptcies, etc., and to assist unprotected persons to obtain justice. If he disapproves of a verdict he can notify the Minister of Justice who will order the case to be re tried. In Tehran all cases, Civil and Criminal, go through the ’Courts, but in the provinces as a rule only the civil cases go through them, i.e., mainly those which formerly were dealt with by the Mujtahids as belonging to the “ Shar’.” In Tehran also a department has been established for regis tration and copying of documents (sabt-i-asnad) where title deeds, etc., after being drawn up and countersigned by a Muj- tahid are taken to be registered, stamped and copied, so that ■no disputes can arise about them in future. This registration as not compulsory and the deeds are valid without it, but it is usually carried out. Like the post revolution financial administration, the newp rac t; ca i administration of Justice modelled on up to date European working of patterns has been found conspicuously wanting both in Tehran, Administration with the single exception of the Registration Department, and the provinces. It affords salaried employment plus faci lities for Mudakhil to a number of clergy who form the majority of the personnel, and the judicial procedure is considered as 1 corrupt and unjust as ever and, owing to the greater number of persons to be propitiated under the new system, more ruin ously Expensive. The institution of courts has not removed jurisdiction from the clutches of the Mujtahids as besides the clerical element prevailing in the courts many civil cases within the scope of the c ' Shar ” are still referred to them for arbitration. Cases in which foreigners, subjects of a European power, Foreigners are concerned do not enter the Persian Adliyeh. aucl the Law. Cases between foreigners are settled in the Consular or Vice- Foreign -Consular court of the defendant. representatives The procedure in cases between foreigners and Persians is based on a clause in the treaty of Turkomanchai, and such cases in Tehran are referred to a special branch of the Persian Foreign Office, where they are tried by a Persian official in the presence of the foreign vice-consul, whose endorsement is re quired for the verdict to be valid. 1 In 1920 a petition signed by the leading merchants of Tehran was presented to the*Prime Minister condemning the corruption and injustice of the courts.I In the chief provincial towns the Persian Foreign Office has agents called Karguzars, and these cases are similarly disposed of by the Karguzar in the presence of the foreign vice-consul. Business of any kind, not necessarily judicial, involving x foreign nationals or interests is referred to the Karguzars and not to the Governors. In this area Karguzars are appointed to Barfarush, Enzali* Kazvln and Rasht. The Russians, prior to the Russian revo lution, had vice-consuls at Kazvin and Rasht and agents at Barfarush and Enzali. British vice-consuls are at Kazvin and Rasht. Foreign powers represented at Tehran are enumerated on pages 117-8. 1 The Imperial Bank of Persia, however, as a Persian Government institution, deals direct with Governors.( 237 ) CHAPTER VI. Armed forces of the Persian Government. The history of their decline and of European Military Missions to Persia 237-9—Existing armed forces 239, South Persia Rifles 240, Cossack division 241, Central Brigade 243, Nizam in the provinces 247, Levy Corps in East Persia 248, Gendarmerie 249, Amnia 252, Police 252, Military Institutions 254. The History of their Decline, and of European Military Missions to Persia. The genius of Nadir Shah, the Napoleon of Asia, who ruled Persia from 1736 to 1747, made her a great military power. Her army was composed of contingents, mostly horsemen, supplied by tribal chiefs from Kurdistan, Georgia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, and although ill-organized and ill-disciplined from a European point of view, it was regularly paid and its spirit was superior to that of any of the neighbouring Asiatic states with which it came into conflict. This spirit was kept alive by Agha Muhammad Khan who, like Nadir, fought his way to the throne, and founded the Kajar dynasty. Path Ali Shah, however, who succeeded him in 1797 was no soldier and his reign marks the beginning of the decline of Persian military power. Moreover his policy of disintegrating the authority of tribal chiefs, who had been accustomed to furnish military contingents to the Shah and in return to preserve a nominal independence, was fatal to the old irregular army which, with a strong Shah to lead it, was well suited to the primitive condi tion of the country. External circumstances also contributed to this decline, for Persia ceased to be surrounded by Oriental States and by the expansion of Russia was now brought face to face with a great power on her Northern frontier. To meet this menace the assistance of European organizers was invited, and the first foreign military mission to the Shah of Persia was sent from France by Napoleon. The apprehension of England was aroused and in 1809 an Anglo-Persian treaty was signed by which the French mission was dismissed and Fath Ali Shah was promised an annual subsidy of 200,000 tumans and the loan of British officers and personnel at the expense of the British Government. British interest in Persia diminished after the defeat of Napoleon while the Shah, after the termination of the Russo-Persian war by the disastrouspeace of Gulistan in 1813, had less need of British assistance. In 1815 a dispute arose between Britain and Persia about the continuance of the subsidy with the result that most of the British officers and all the non-commissioned officers were with drawn. A few, however, remained and a Major Hart exercised great influence in Persia until his death in 1830. Some French' officers also were employed after 1815. In 1834 a second attempt was made to organize the Persian army by British instructors and a large and well equipped detachment of officers and non-commissioned officers arrived' at Tehran from India a few months before the death of Path All Shah. Their presence secured the peaceful accession oh Muhammad Shah, but his attack on Herat in 1838 caused a rupture between Persia and Great Britain and all the British officers left Persia. Their position had been rendered un comfortable owing to the arrogance of the Shah and to their having no control over the pay or promotion in his army. French,. Italian and Austrian officers followed. All had disappeared' by 1861 when Nasir-ud-Din Shah applied for British aid but without result owing to a dispute about the incidence of expense. A further request made by him in 1870 was refused on the ground that Persia was fighting Afghans and Baluchis who- were allies of Great Britain. Austrians were again employed in 1879 but they quarrelled' among themselves and failed to achieve any result. This year also marked the beginning of the Cossack brigade under Russian officers, which, owing to the pressure Russia has been enabled to exert on Persia, has been the most longlived of all these military experiments made by foreign officers in Persia. Russian policy, however, was to train the Persian Cossacks sufficiently to serve as a useful tool for furthering Russian control over Northern Persia, but not to make them an efficient fighting force, which, should it turn “Nationalist.'' might stand in Russia’s way. In November 1920, at the instance- of the British, the Russian officers and non-commissioned officers were dismissed by the Persian Government. In 1911 Sweden was invited as a neutral power inoffensive- to either Russia or Great Britain to provide officers to form a Persian Gendarmerie. This force expanded rapidly from 1911 to 1914, but on the outbreak of the European war the regular Swedish officers were withdrawn to Sweden. They were succeeded by non-regular officers and in 1915 most of the Gen darmerie went over to Turks and Germans. 1 See Chapter I, p. 37. The resuscitated Gendarmerie is described below-239 Lastly in accordance with the Anglo-Persian convention of 1919 an Anglo-Persian military commission was assembled at Tehran in 1920 and drew up a scheme for the formation of a Persian army. It recommended the gradual formation of an army of 70,000 men, and an abortive start was made in June 1920 when British officers were appointed to the 2 Central Brigade, but were soon afterwards withdrawn owing to the objection of the Cabinet of Mushir-ud-Dauleh to the employment of any British officers or advisers so long as the agreement had not been ratified by the Majlis and was legally invalid. Such is the record of foreign military missions in Persia, none of which have achieved any great measure of success and many of which have been egregious failures owing to “mutual jealousies of the European powers, unstable finances and short comings in the national (i.e., Persian) Character.” No scheme of military organization in Persia which fails to give control over the finances and so secure regular pay for the troops, and a free hand to the foreign officers to make appointments and promotions and check patronage, has any chance of success. Meanwhile since Path All Shah the Persian army has gone from bad to worse. During the reign of Nasir-ud-Din there was still some show of a regular army, of 150,000 men according to the official lists, but in actual fact very much less. In the Anglo-Persian war of 1856-7 a force of some 10,000 Persians ran away from 300 British on the Karun and in 1860 a Persian force gave an exhibition of cowardice before Merv Turkomans. The army was, however, sufficient to maintain order internally throughout the country until its decay was completed by Muzaffar-ud-Din, whose extravagance emptied the treasury and left no money for* pay of troops, and since the constitution it has practically ceased to exist. Existing Armed Forces. Chapter II of the Report of the Anglo-Persian Military Com mission, 1919-20 is entitled “ Review of Persia’s Existing Armed Forces.” It begins :— 19. The existing armed forces in Persia, excluding troops of foreign powers composed of foreigners, consists of a motley collection of variously organized, variously administered and variously trained bodies of men which have grown up partly as * The army had little existence except on paper and the military budget served mainly for provision of salaries and opportunities of peculation for princes and royal favourites.240 General. the result of work of different nationalities and partly due to the direct action of foreign powers which have at various times exercised influence in Persia. For the purposes'of review, these bodies may be divided into three groups, viz.— The military force proper —administered either by the War Office or directly by foreign powers. The gendarmerie, a military force, administered by the ♦Minister of Interior, and whose functions are partly those of an army and partly those of a police force. The police forces proper, under the Ministry of the Interior. Each of the above require to be again sub-divided as follows:— “ Military Forces Proper. (i) The South Persia Rifles. (ii) The Cossack Division. (in) The Central Brigade. (iv) The Nizam in the provinces. (v) The Levy Corps in East Persia. Gendarmerie. (vi) The regular (Swedish) gendarmerie. (vii) The Amnia and similar bodies administered by local governors. Police Proper. (viii) The regular police. (ix) The provincial police.” The principal forces wholly or partly in this area are the Cossack Division (ii) and the Gendarmerie (vi). (1) The South Persia Rifes. By the terms of their enlistment the South Persia Rifles are liable for service in any part of Persia but they have never been sent out of South Persia. 20. “The South Persia Rifles were raised by the British Government during the great war in order to assist the Persian Government in maintaining order and protecting trade routes in South Persia, disorder having been fomented largely by German and other agents. The strength of the force has varied and after the war was considerably reduced, only cadres of the * * The gendarmerie were trnrs'erred to the War Minister in 1921.different regiments being left pending the Persian Government ■wholly 1 taking over the force.

The whole cost of South Persia Rifles is borne by the British Government. (2) The Cossack Division. _ 26. This division has grown from a single regiment of 500 (Jeneral. raised by Russian officers in 1879 to its present size. The force though paid for by the Persian Government was regarded by the Russians as a Russian force with which to maintain their -hold and influence over Persia. Russian officers were appointed without reference to the Persian Government nor were any accounts rendered by the Chief of the force to that Government. The present strength of the force amounts to * * 56 Russian officers, 202 Persian officers, 3,141 horses, *66 Russian Non- Commissioned Officers, *7,866 Persian ranks. ^27. The Division consist of a Headquarters and, at present, Organization 9 Otryads ” or detachments. It is commanded by a *Russian officer with a *Russian general staff officer to assist him. The Headquarter staff is divided into an Executive and an Adminis trative branch, each composed of both *Russian and Persian personnel. The “Otryads” are mixed forces of all arms, called after the localities in which they are stationed. They vary in strength from a battalion, a cavalry regiment and 12 guns to a company, a squadron and machine guns. The strength and location of “ c Otryads” vary from time to time according to the needs of the situation. The present nine “Otryads’ are named after Tehran, Tabriz, Isfahan, Meshed, Hamadan, Gilan, Ardabil, Mazan- daran and Urumieh. The Isfahan “Otryad” is now located at 1 Owing to the failure of the Persian Government to take over the force, and the refusal of the British Government to continue to bear the cost, it was dis banded m the autumn of 1921. * “ See note at end of article.”242 9 ^Equipment. Condition of service. Burujird, the Meshed one at Astarabad and the Mazandaran “Otryad” at Bandar-i-Gaz. In units the “ Otryads ” total 28 infantry companies, 17 squadrons, 20 guns and 28 machine guns. The artillery is formed in 4 gun batteries or 2 gun sections, the machine guns in sections of 2 guns each. 28. The majority of the rifles in the division are of Russian pattern supplied from arms factories in Russia. There are also some charger loading Winchesters. Of the machine gu ns ' 10 are German pattern, 4 Russian and 14 are Colts. The reserves of small arm ammunition are reported to be low. The artillery are partly field and partly mountain, some of Russian pattern and some Schneiders. Gun ammunition reserves are also said to be low. The equipment is either made in the division workshops or bought locally. Formerly it was largely obtained from Russia. The clothing consists of a uniform approximating to that of the Russian Cossacks. It is procured locally, an allowance of 22 tumans per head per annum being provided in the budget for its upkeep. 29. Recruitment is ordinarily by voluntary enlistment but recently a certain number of* “fauj” have been allotted to the division for the enlistment of recruits under the f ‘ bonicheh system. Good material is obtainable under the latter system but the present method of administering that system has teen found to produce difficulties in the way of getting the best men. There is a system of pensions after 15 years’ service. Artillery and transport horses are bought by the division, but those of mounted ranks are their own property. The rates of pay in krans per annum are as follows: Persians. General (regimental Commander) Major (battalion commander) . Captain (company commander). Lieutenant .... Second Lieutenant . Medical officer Sergeant Major Platoon sergeant Section sergeant Corporals .... Drummers, trumpeters Cossacks .... 15,000 12,000 9,000 6,000 4,800 7,000 960 780 720 600 480 480 * See page 247 below, t See page 248 below.The division is housed in Government quarters at a total 1 annual cost for upkeep of 345;,000 krans. A few men still make their own arrangements for accommodation if they are- married. Heating and lighting is provided free at a total, annual cost of 139,000 krans. 12 “ sirs” of bread are issued free to each man, and each man gets in addition a monthly feeding allowance of 30 krans.. Men are provided with a hot meal daily for which they are charged 15 krans a month, the actual cost of the meal being in excess of this. When away from their headquarters for more- than three days the men receive a subsistence allowance based on the actual cost and out of pocket expenses incurred. * Russian officers used to be appointed and were removed by the * Russian Government, at present this is in the hands of the' Chief of the Division. * Russian on-Commissioned Officers were similarly appointed. Persian officers are appointed by the Chief of the Division. Officers mostly rise from ranks. For promotion from the ranks to officer grades a certain service in the ranks is required. There is a cadet school at Tehran, which includes besides military subjects, subjects of general education. On conclusion of the course at this school cadets are appointed second lieutenants. There is also an instructional class for the ranks of the division after going through which the individuals are given pre ferential treatment as regards promotion. 30. The system of drill and training, and also that of adminis- Miscellaneous* tration is Russian. All words of command are, however, given in Persian. 31. The total cost of the division amounts to 19,151,000 Cost, krans per annum. Of this 12,000,000 have been recently paid by the British Government.” Note.—T he'Itussian officers and Non-Commissioned Officers were dismissed in November 1920, and the force is at present under a Persian Commander. The number of Persian ranks was found to be considerably under the estimated strength and was nearer 5,000. The rank and file are fairly hardy, good marchers and better material than in the Gendarmerie, and the undisciplined ill-organized state of the force is due to the Russian officers and Russian policy regarding it as mentioned! above. They are mostly Turk!, recruited from Azerbaijan, and the districts of Kharagan and Khalajistan near Saveh. (3) The Central Brigade. “ 32. The Central Brigade is really part of the ordinary (; enera L army of the country, provided for by the “ bonicheh ” law, J but *See note at end of article, t See page 23.*.244 Organisation. being stationed at the capital, is organized and administered in a special manner. The present strength of the brigade is:— Swedish officer . • • i* Polish officer • . • i* Persian officers . • 126 Persian ranks . 2,142 Horses r L. • • 225 33. The Central Brigade consists of a brigade headquarters, an infantry regiment of three battalions, a cavalry regiment of five squadrons, an artillery regiment of five batteries and a Non-Commissioned Officers’ school. The brigade headquarters consists of 1 *Swedish Com mandant, 12 Persian officers and 10 Persian other ranks. It is located in the Maidan-i-Tupkhaneh. The staff is divided into a general and an Intendance branch. The former deals with questions of personnel, organization and training, the latter with pay, accounts and supplies of all kinds, including arms and clothing. The infantry regiment consists, of three battalions, each of four companies, with a total of 50 officers including 1 aspirant and 1,263 other ranks. No. 9 company is regarded as an engineer company. The 1st battalion is at Rasht attached to the Cossack division, the other two are at Tehran. The Cavalry regiment is divided into two divisions, each of two squadrons. In addition there is a reserve squadron. Total strength 28 officers, including two aspirants, 379 other ranks and 152 horses. The artillery regiment is divided into two divisions, the first of which contains two field and the second three mountain batteries. Total strength 31 officers of which 5 are aspirants, 353 other ranks and 70 horses. The Non-Commissioned Officers’ school is in charge of a ^Polish officer with three Persian instructors to assist him. There are 50 pupils and an inclusive budget of 500 tumans per month is allowed for the school. Entrance to the school is by voluntary enlistment as the conscripts in the brigade have neither the intelligence nor the education to enable them to profit by the course at the school. There is a band consisting of 3 officers and 55 other ranks for the whole brigade, attached to the infantry regiment. *See note at end of article.34. The infantry battalion at Rasht has been provided with Equipment, arms by the Cossack division, the remainder of the brigade is practically without small arms. A few rifles and carbines, of various patterns and mostly unserviceable, have been issued to the brigade for instructional purposes. The artillery regiment is supposed to have the following guns—j 4 Schneider field guns. 4 Euchatius 9cm field guns. 2 Euchatius 8cm field guns. 3 Schneider mountain guns. 2 Euchatius mountain guns. The mountain guns however are non-existent having bee 11 lent to the gendarmerie or returned to the arsenal. Th e Schneider field guns cannot be fired as their buffer spring 8 are missing. A certain amount of harness exists. The regiment can turn out four Euchatius guns mounted. The brigade has practically no small arm ammunition. There are about 100 rounds per gun for the Euchatius guns, but none for the Schneiders. The equipment is bought locally from a contractor. The clothing is obtained in similar manner. An allowance of 20 tumans per head per annum is allowed for in the budget for equipping the men. This is supposed to provide two suits of uniform, one pair of boots and one of shoes. The clothing is the same for all arms, except the colour of the shoulder straps and the background of the badge on the headdress which is green for cavalry, red for infantry and blue for artillery. 35. The men of the Central Brigade are conscripts enlisted conditions of under the “Bonicheh” *law. Thef “fauj” allotted to the Service. Central Brigade are mostly those around Tehran. The men serve for three years and are allowed to stay on beyond the period of their enlistment. Officers are appointed to the brigade by the Ministry of War. There are many who are unfit or past work but are retained in the service for reasons other than the efficiency of their units. The military school maintained by the Ministry of War is supposed to provide young officers for the brigade. Promotions are made by the Ministry of War. Non-Commis sioned Officers are drawn either from suitable? men in the ranks or from the brigade Non-Commissionnd Officers’ school (para. 33). * See page 248 below, t See page 247 below.246 ‘Miscellaneous. Gost. The rates of pay are as follows in krans per mensem.— * Swedish Commandant Rs. 2,330 * Polish Instructor 1,900 Colonel 1,250 Lieutenant-Colonel 1,000 Major 700 'Captain 550 Ist-Lieutenant 400 :2nd-Lieutenant . 300 Aspirant 150 Sergeant-Major 90 Sergeant r * 80 Corporal 50 Private 30 All ranks receive a ration of 16 “ sirs ” of wheat per diem. The bread is supplied by the Government bakeries in the town, the C. O.of each unit receiving daily from Brigade headquarters a demand note on the Government baker according to the strength return of the unit. While on command all ranks receive an allowance equal to ^rd of their pay. The Brigade headquarters are located in convenient quarters in the Maidan-i-Tupkhaneh. The Non-Commissioned Officers’ school is in a house rented for the purpose in the town, small and unsuitable. The three regiments are in Government barracks, located in different parts of the town. The barracks are built in a similar manner, a series of rooms round three sides of a square. In the case of the cavalry and artillery a portion of the rooms has been converted into stables or gun sheds. 36. The system of drill and training is Swedish, but the brigade being as it is at present, unequipped, unarmed, un officered and untrained, it may be said to possess no military value whatever. The office work and administrative arrange ments of the Brigade headquarters are on sound lines. 37. The total cost of the force is about 4,327,000 krans per annum. ’ ’ * Note In 1920 the Swedish and Polish officers were removed and British officers were attached to the Brigade. Arms were supplied from Kazvin, but taken back on their dismissal. It has now no foreign officers. The senior Persian officers were found to be hostile to reform, totally incompetent, and accustomed to batten on the proceeds of their patronage, all promotion being given oa payment.247 (4) The Nizam in the Provinces. 38. “The Persian, army, as is mentioned in the * Chapter General, '■dealing with the recruiting laws, is supposed to consist of a number of “fauj” of conscripts, certain areas of certain villages contributing a “fauj ” of about 1,000 men. Only a percentage of these “fauj” are actually supposed to be called out for service, the remainder staying at their homes but receiving allowances in return for their liability. The total number of men liable to this service amounts, according to the last returns* to over 86,000. As several “fauj ” have been allotted to the Gendarmerie, the Cossack Division and the Central Brigade, this number would not be available in addition to the strength of those formations. The strength of the Nizam to be kept on actual service in the provinces, for which budget provision has been made, is 9,478 of all ranks with 3,009 horses. 39. No regular organization for the provincial Nizam can be Organization, said to exist. There is in each province a “Rais-i-Qushun ” who is supposed to train and adminster these troops. Actually the number of men maintained depends on the local governor. The amount budgetted for is deducted by the governor from the revenues which he has to remit to the central government. 40. The arms are of various kinds and qualities, except in Equipment ■certain localities, such as Khorasan and the Qainat where -303 weapons have been presented to the governors by the British Government. Clothing and equipment is obtained locally and is of different patterns, the green, red and blue distinctions for cavalry, infantry and artillery are, however, generally main tained. f41. The men are enlisted compulsorily under the Conditions of “'Bonlcheh ” system. Certain “ fauj ” are allotted to different Service - provinces. The quota required is taken from the recruits avail able in the “ fauj ” allotted. The rates of pay are supposed to be those laid down in the “ Bonicheh ” flaw but in practice they are dependent on the will of local governors. Rations are similarly dependent on local governors but all men are supposed to receive a ration of bread. Officers and Non-Commissioned Officers are appointed by local governors or Rais-i-Qushun. In most places there are Government ‘ sarbaz khaneh’ where men of the Nizam are housed. * Para. 72 Recruiting laws, see page . t see next page.248 Miscellaneous. Cost. Recruiting laws. General. Cost. 42. The system of training may be said to be nil and the Nizam of no value, except as personal guards to houses. In some provinces the state of inefficiency is less than in others depending on the amount of interest taken in the force by the local governor. 43. The total cost of the provincial Nizam is over 9,000,000 krans per annum.’’ ;,k NOTE. In 1920 contingents from some districts were specially summoned to Tehran and Kazvin a quite useless measure as the men were an untrained rabble and discontented at non-receipt of pay. 72. “ Bonicheh ” law and Law of 23rd Ziqaadeh 1335. The basis of Military service in Persia is the “ Bonicheh ” law, passed by Mirza Taqi Khan, Prime Minister to Nasir-ud-Din Shah in 1260 (A. D. 1842). Under the above law each province and district of Persia was assessed at so many “ Bonicheh ” and for each “ Bonicheh ” unit the Government were authorized to demand one soldier. _ „ ,. , . The provinces are subdivided into districts (Fauj) each of which is supposed to furnish one regiment. , ... , _ The method of calculating men available, is to carry out a survey of the number of ploughs required to keep an area under cultivation, and to take one man per nlou&lt;'h as available for military service. As no re-survey has been made since the law was passed the laid down quotas per district are not fairly distributed at the nresent date. The quotas of infantry, cavalry and artillery which can be demanded under the “ Bonicheh ” law from each province are shown in Appendix 2 of the review.” (5) Levy Corps in East Persia. 44. “ There are two of these corps, the Khorasan and the SIstan Levy Corps. They were raised during the war by the British Government to assist the regular troops in East Persia to keep order there and prevent the action of enemy agents who were trying to create disorder. The present strength of these corps is as follows :— British officers Persian officers Persian ranks Horses Camels Khorasan Corps. Sistan Corps. 1 i 6 13 12 58 580 1.700 140 700 1 1,050 49. The approximate annual cost of the two corps, calcula ting expenditure in rupees at the current rate of exchange amounts to— , . krans per annum. SIstan Corps t’300 000 Khorasan Corps 1,300,000 Total 5,700,000 Note —These corps bear no relation to this North-Western area and paras. 65, 444, 7 giving details about them have been omitted as irrelevant to it.R 249 (6) Gendarmerie. 50. “The present gendarmerie is a resuscitation of the old General. Swedish gendarmerie, which was broken up during the war by the desertion of considerable numbers of its officers and men to the Germans and Turks. The present strength of the Gendarmerie is 3 Swedish officers, 242 Persian officers, 8,158 Persian ranks and 2,340 horses. The estimates provide, however, for a force of 11,342 of all ranks and 4,511 horses. 51. The gendarmerie is organized into a headquarters at Organization. Tehran and a number of regiments and independent battalions. The 1st regiment at Tehran has 4 battalions and is employed in guarding roads. The 2nd regiment, also at Tehran, has 2 battalions, 3 squadrons and an artillery detachment and is kept as a moveable column, the 3rd is an independent battalion also at Tehran, and does police work in the town. The 4th regiment has three battalions at Qum, Sultanabad and Daulata- bad respectively. It has 2 mountain guns attached to it and guards roads and does police work in the towns. The 5th is , an independent battalion at Kazvin guarding roads and doing police work in the towns. The 6th regiment has two battalions at Isfahan and one at Kashan and has 4 guns attached to it. It guards roads and furnishes a moveable column at Isfahan. The 7th to the 11th are all independent battalions with head quarters at Kirmanshah, Mazandaran, Meshed, Samnan and Senneh respectively. The 11th battalion is engaged in opera tions against the Kurds, the others are all guarding roads or doing police work in the towns. The 7th finds a moveable column at Kirmanshah and the intention is to raise this to a a full regiment of 3 battalions, of which one is to be stationed at Hamadan. The battalions are all divided into four companies. Batta lions vary from 700 to 300 men. Except in the second regiment where the mounted men are separately organized, each com pany contains a proportion, about one quarter, of mounted men. The 3rd battalion, doing police duty in Tehran town, has only 50 mounted men. The guarding of roads is done by a system of dotting posts of four to ten men over areas allotted to a section or a company. A number of such section areas constitute a company area. The men are only relieved from such posts at long intervals. arm , ame11 ^ the corps is of various patterns. The Equipment. 1st and 2nd regiments and the 3rd independent battalion have250 Conditions Service. British '303 charger loading rifles. The 9th battalion has British non-charger loading rifles and the 11th has a proportion of British -SOS’s. The remaining units are armed with rifles of various patterns and calibres, the most homogeneous being the 6th regiment which has 700 Turkish mausers. The corps has 8 guns and 15 machine guns, in both cases of various pat- terns. ' There is no fixed scale of ammunition hut about 50 rounds per rifle are maintained in unit charge, of which 10 rounds are usually with the gendarme himself. There is a headquarter reserve of 150,000 rounds in the Bagh-i-Shah Barracks. There are about 250 rounds per gun for the artillery. 20 tumans per head per annum are budgetted for clothing and equipping the men. This includes boots and belts. The clothing and equipment is made up or bought regimentally. In the case of units located in places where clothing, etc., cannot be bought, the articles are sent from the headquarters of the gendarmerie. 53. Recruitment is usually by voluntary enlistment, but in order to make up numbers a certain number of* * “ fauj ” under thef “Bonicheh” system have been allotted to the gendarmerie.’ The normal engagement is for 3 years with permissible re engagement up to 30 or 35 years of age. There is no system of pensions or gratuities, either to the men or to their families. Officers are appointed either (a) from the officers’ school or (6) from the ranks. The officers’ school at Bagh-i-Shah is capable of taking 40 students, admission is by examination, including a medical examination for fitness and the course lasts nine months. The passing out examination is competitive and determines the seniority of the candidates. There are no subsequent examinations and there are no pensions or gratuities. Officers are also promoted from the ranks. Suitable men are appointed aspirants and after a course of probation in that rank become officers. Non-Commissioned Officers are selected from the ranks and usually by seniority. There is a Non-Commissioned Officers’ school at Tehran, capable of taking 200 students, for which men are selected from regiments but special enlistments for the school are also taken. Such must be Persian subjects, Musul- mans, under 18 years of age, able to read and write Persian and be guaranteed by some known person. Promotion is usually by seniority. * See page 247 above. * See page 248 above.The rates of pay are as follows in brans per month.

All other ranks receive 16 sirs of wheat per day plus a money allowance of 1 bran per man per day. On detached duty the latter is paid to the men but at unit headquarters it is paid into a messing fund from which the men are fed. Kitchens and baberres are maintained by these units. Men are housed in government barraebs where these exist, as is the case in most places. Occasionally buildings have- to be hired which are paid for from a supplementary budget.. 54. The system of drill and training is Swedish the wrrd«™ „ of command being translated into Persian. Owing to road 18Cellaneous - guard and similar duties which the force hi s to perform the men get little training after they have done their recruits’ course. There is no regular system of musbetry training nor any ammunition allowed for it. 6 Under its existing organization the force has acquired an appreciable degree of efficiency and is probably the most useful force, controlled solely by the Persian Government, which252 V Cost, General. General. Organization. Equipment. exists in the country. Its organization goes considerably beyond the scope of a road pohce, which is the ordinary accepted func tion of a gendarmerie. As it stands the gendarmerie is a mili tary force but without the training necessary for serious opera tions. 55. “ The annual cost of the gendarmerie, at its present strength, is about 30,400,000 krans.” Noth —During 1920 the Gendarmerie have proved very inferior to the Cossacks’ A detachment in Rasht went over en masse to the Bolsheviks, and detachments in the East of Gxlan, in Tunakabun and in Alamut all retired m some cases quite unnecessarily, at the rumour of the approach of Bolsheviks with out waiting to meet them or ascertain their numbers. The rank and file are ot poor physique, many of them- townspeople and the proportion of undersized hoys among them is striking.

The Amnia. 56. t£ In. many provinces there exists an Amnia or road police, administered by local governors. The numbers and cost of these cannot be ascertained accurately but probably amounts to a million krans per annum.

The regular police extends only to the towns of Tehran, Kazvin, Rasht and Meshed. Its functions are those of ordinary town police, but even at these towns it does not perform all police duties, such as guarding private houses that require protection and considerable numbers of troops are used to supplement it. Its total strength is 6 Swedish officers and 2,250 Persians, including officers. 58. The police consists of a headquarters, under a Swedish Organizer in Chief, with the police of Tehran (1310), Rasht (370), Kazvin (200) and Meshed (370). The other Swedish officers act as instructors both at headquarters and in the towns named. The regular police organization is being extended to Tabriz. 59. Every policeman is armed with a Russian rifle, officers and Non-Commissioned Officers with swords and automatic pistols while a number of policemen carry batons.

First engage ment for three years, with possible extensions to 50 years of age. Intending recruits must be Persian subjects, Musulmans at least 20 years of age, 5' 5' in height, medically sound, able to read and write Persian and have a certificate of character from some reliable person. They take an oath of allegiance to govern ment and country. There is no lack of good recruits. For all ranks pensions are provided (1) after 25 years service, half-rate of pay at time of retirement, same rate in case of dis ablement (2) if death is caused in the performance of duty, compassionate allowance is paid for three years to the children or if none, for one year to the next of kin, (3) in case of ordinary death, a compassionate allowance is paid to the children, or failing such, to the next of kin, (a) after 3 years’ service half rate last pay for one year to the children or 6 months to the next of kin, (b) with less than three years’ service a gratuity of three months’ pay is granted. Officers are obtained (1) from aspirants who serve one year in the rank's and then undergo an examination which embraces reading, writing, French or English and mathematics, (2) from the ranks, selected Non-Commissioned Officers who pass the same examination as aspirants being commissioned. There is no officers’ school. There is no further examination for promo tion, which is by seniority. Inefficients may be compulsorily retired, otherwise officers may continue in the service till 50 years of age. Non-Commissioned Officers are selected after one or two years’ service, go through a three months’ course at the Non-Commissioned Officers school at Tehran and are graded according to their pass out.

The pay of Persian ranks of the police is inclusive and no accommodation or rations are provided. 'iiscellaneous. 61. The system of drill and training is Swedish. Recruits are put through a three months’ course of training before being posted for duty. The force performs the ordinary police duties of maintenance of law and order, traffic regulations and to a certain extent, public health. They control permits to carry arms, licences for public and private vehicles, etc. In addition at Tehran the prison and the asylum are managed by the police. The force appears to be efficient and if the regulations and instructions as issued by the Chief Organizer are strictly fol lowed, the results should be excellent. * Cost. 62. “ The total cost of the regular police force is about 10,000,000 krans per annum. There is also a corps of 500 men doing police duty at the Royal palaces, administered by the War Office and costing 725,000 krans per annum.” Geaeral.

Military Institutions. 65. “According to “General regulations for the Central organization of the War Office ” published in A D 1917 the War Office is organized as follows :—There is an Army Council consisting of the Director and Assistant Director of the following departments: Military- Administration, Stores, Medical Services, and also the Chief Accountant and the Chief of the Central Tribunal. The Army council has two functions, viz .:— (а) Assisting the War Minister. (б) Dealing with offences committed by the Chief or the Staff of any Headquarters. In addition to the above the Army Council is responsible for drafting all rules and regulations appertaining to the ad ministration of .the Army. There are eight departments in the Ministry of War, namely— (1) Department of the Minister of War. (2) Department of the Secretary of the War Office. (3) Department of Military Administration. (4) Department of the Chief Accountant. (5) Department of Military Stores. (6) Department of Military Personnel. (7) Department of Medical Services. (8) The Central Tribunal. The Minister of War, in addition to the normal duties as laid down in European countries, has certain duties to perform such as “ Inspection of the various military formations,” “ Devising means for the moral improvement of the Army,” ■“ Appointing deserving persons to suitable posts.” There are directly attached to him, an assistant Minister, an Inspector- General and two Adjutants. The Department of the Secretary of the War Office is the •clerical office for the distribution of correspondence. The Department of Military Administration is organized in three sections, viz., Infantry, Cavalry and a combined Artillery and Engineering section. The personnel consists of a Director, three Assistant Directors and some assistants. This department carries out the duties of a General Staff in a very modified form, combined with portions of the duties usually carried out in either the Adjutant General’s or Quartermaster General’s branch. The Department of the Chief Accountant in addition to being responsible for the internal financial arrangement of the Army is also charged with keeping a record of all material, structure arms, ammunition etc., on charge of the Army.256 The Department of Military Stores combines the duties of the Ordnance Department, the Army Service Corps, and a Works Directorate. Department of Military Personnel. This department carries out the duties of an Adjutant General’s branch less that portion included in the Department of Military Administration. Department of Medical Services. In addition to Medical Services, this Department deals with the Veterinary Service. The duties of the Central Tribunal include regulations for the punishment of military offences and execution of sentences, composition of courts-martial, and supervision of military tribunals. Educational 66. The following educational establishments exist:— Establishments. The Cossack Division Cadet school. (6) The Gendarmerie Officers’ school. (c) The Military school. (d) The Central Brigade Non-Commissioned Officers^ school. Of these all have been mentioned except the Military Schoo 1 in Chapter 2. Military 67. The Military School has been in existence for about a School. year. It is housed in a small, unsuitable house in Tehran. There are 85 Cadets of whom 20 are boarders and the remainder live out. The school is divided into 5 classes for whom there is an elaborate programme of instruction embracing most subjects. There is, however, little instruction in reality except, as regards fencing and physical training. As a school for the education of the future officer the value is nil. The total cost is about krans 279,000 annually. Arsenal. 68. The arsenal is at Tehran in charge of a French Engineer who has been in Tehran for 38 years. There are 42 employes at the present time. There is a large amount of heavy machinery in store, of mixed types, English, French, and Austrian: only a few hand lathes have been set up. The machinery is, for the most part in good condition but examination by an expert is necessary. The arsenal is not put to practical use at present, except for the manufacture of fireworks.”( 257 ) CHAPTER VH. Economic Resources. (а) Trade Generally. (б) Imports and exports. Statistics.

A.—Trade Generally. The geographical position of this area, which contains some Facilites for of the principal markets of Persia, is so convenient to the Caspian ^ North-Wes^r and so distant from any other sea board, that at all times the Persia, whole of it must be peculiarly dependent on the markets of Russia, while the provinces of Gilan and Mazandaran, open to the Caspian and isolated behind the barrier of the Elburz moun tains from the plateau of Persia, have no other natural outlet for their products. Moreover, the principal raw products of Northern Persia, i.e., rice, cotton, fruits, pelts, skins, fish, timber etc., are all required by Russia, and on the other hand Russian products, especially sugar and textiles, are well adapted to Persian markets.\ Obstacles to British trade and Anglo- Bussian trade rivalry. 258 The Armenian and Persian traders of the Caucasus, ac quainted with both the Persian and Russian languages and usages, are most suitable agents to extend the commerce between the two countries. In about 1890 Russia began to devote special attention to the development of trade with Persia, proceeded to utilize these natural advantages, and started keen rivalry with Great Britain, her only commercial as also her only political rival in Persia. Russia’s first step was to improve communications and facilitate the transport of Russian goods. The completion of the Rostof-Petrovsk line to Baku and the extension of steamer traffic on the Volga and Caspian placed the port of Enzali in ready communication with Russian markets, and the building of the Rasht-Kazvin road to Tehran in 1900 and Hamadan in 1906, and the improvement of the port of Enzali afforded direct and rapid access to the internal commercial centres of Persia. Further to curtail the cost of transport special through rates were granted for Russian goods to Persia. Finally by the construction of the Tiflis-Julfa railway, Russia commenced to develop a direct land-route to North and North-Western Persia. The easy route from Batum to Baku had been closed to British trade by Russia’s repudiation of the treaty of Berlin permitting free transit of goods in bond through Russian terri tory and British goods could only reach these regions of Northern Persia by 5 difficult, devious and costly caravan routes, viz .:— 1. Bandar Abbas—Kirman—Isfahan. 2. Bushirc—Shiraz—Isfahan. 3 Muhammarah—Ahwaz—Isfahan. 4. Baghdad—Kirmanshah. 5. Trebizond—Tabriz. Turkey charged an 1 per cent, ad valorem duty by No. 4 and permitted free transit by No. 5. Russia allowed free transit for tea and for merchandise by parcel post, probably for two reasons :— 1. Russia produces no tea herself and consequently was unable to prevent the entry into Persia of Indian tea for which no substitute was available.* 2. Some 30,000 cases of tea were regularly being imported via Trebizond to Persia and caravan drivers wereprepared to go from Tabriz to Trebizond with light loads or for a low rate of hire, owing to the certainty that tea at any rate would be ready at Trebizond awaiting transport to Tabriz and that they could command a lucrative rate for the return journey. Now Russia was most interested in closing the Trebizond route, the only non-Russian route to Persia from the North and the only route left open for British goods, and as soon as she opened transit for tea through Batum to Persia the result was felt in Trebizond. Tea was no longer sent there and caravan drivers ceased to go unless assured of a return transport, and to effect this, rates had to be raised from krans 200 to as much as krans 500 per package. Further to strike a blow at this route and lessen merchandise available at Trebizond, Russia permitted the transit by Batum of merchandise by parcel post. The period of transit by these routes from London to Tehran varied from 70 to 120 days at a cost in 1913 ranging from £35 to £40 per ton while by the Russian route via Rasht from Moscow to Tehran it varied from 15 to 20 days at a cost of £15 to £20 per ton. These high freights were due to the cost of transport from the port of unloading in Persia to Tehran. Routes from the Persian Gulf ports, moreover, were frequent ly closed owing to the disturbed state of Southern Persia, and were only passable for pack animals, with the result that in the course of a few years charges had more than doubled. The Russian roads on the other hand traversed tranquil districts and were available for wheeled as well as pack trans port, so that charges underwent only very slight increase. In addition to facilitating communications to extend her own and handicap British trade, Russia undertook various commercial and political measures with the same object. To encourage the export to Persia of such of her products as were subject to British competition in Persian markets, e.g., cotton, linen tissues and sugar, Russian exporters were granted very liberal drawback, amounting in some cases to 15 per cent, or to 20 per cent, of the value of the goods, of the duties which had been imposed in Russia on these manufactures. This state aid enabled Russian goods, which originally were more expensive, to undersell British goods. Russia also fostered export trade from Persia to Russia by affording the advantage260 of her own protected markets to certain Persian products, i.e. r raw 1 cotton and rice, by a preferential tariff which admitted these commodities to Russia from Persia, at lower duty than from other countries. In 1903 she secretly concluded a Customs Convention with Persia cancelling the 5 per cent, ad valorem tariff, which had existed since the treaty of Turkomanchai in 1828, and imposing a new tariff by weight, 2 the incidence of which fell three times heavier on the staple articles of British than on the staple articles of Russian trade. The detrimental effect of this tariff to British trade probably fell below Russian expectation, as actually the extra tax was paid by the consumer. Enhanced prices, however, mean reduced consumption and so lessen trade. The Russian 3 “ Banque D’Escompte De Perse ” used its position as the creditor of the Persian state to oust British enterprise. It advanced large loans to the Persian Government at 6 per cent, which it had itself borrowed in Paris at 4 per cent., and also, by virtue of the Russian Government support, was enabled to deal in a way impossible to the Imperial Bank of Persia, a British institution conducted on ordinary business lines. The Russian Bank habitually advanced loans and issued drafts at slightly more favourable rates than the Imperial Bank, and lent money to Persian merchants trading with Russia at abnormally low interest. The result of these natural advantages and of these methods was a great expansion of Russian trade in Persia, while the trade of the British Empire and other countries remained almost stationary. The total foreign trade in Persia increased from some £8,000,000 in 1880 to £17,000,000 in 1913, the increase being most marked after 1900. The total value of Russian trade with Persia in 1889 was £2,189,000 and of British trade £3,697,000. In 1913 the value of imports from the British Empire into Persia 1 The duty on cotton from Persia was 40 kopeks per poud (36 lbs) while cotton from other countries was taxed 4 roubles 16 kopeks per poud, i.e. Persian cotton in Russia had an advantage of 3 roubles 75 kopeks per poud or about 2.\d per pound. 2 The new duties worked out at an average of 9 per cent, ad valorem on the principal articles of import from the British Empire and at 31 per cent, on those from Russia, and 3 per cent, on the principal articles of export to- the British Empire and of 1 per cent, on those to Russia. . The duty on tea, which was nearly all imported from India, was raised to 95 per cent. • See “ Eoreign Interests ” para, (c) below, page 271.261 was roughly | the value of the imports from Russia, and of the exports from Persia to the British Empire -i the value of the exports to Russia. / From its geographical position this North-Western area became the greatest centre of Russo-Persian commerce, and the base for Russian political and commercial penetration into Persia. The trade of Gilan and Mazandaran, with commercial ■centres at Rasht and Barfarush was entirely Russian and these provinces became economically dependent on Russia, of Kazvin and Tehran chiefly Russian, and only in the Hamadan region was Great Britain able to maintain competition. The Russian revolution had by the end of 1917 caused a Effect of the stagnation of this trade which shifted to the 1 Persian Gulf Evolution on routes to the advantage of Great Britain, who was left with no trade, and trade serious competitor. in Imports were all supplied through the Persian Gulf ports and British goods during 1919 were even forwarded on from Enzali to Transcaspia and to the Caucasus. The products of the Caspian provinces, however, rice, cotton, oranges, and timber, especially of Mazandaran owing to the great distance and impracticability of export on a large scale by the difficult mule tracks across the Elburz, can find no outlet and remain unsold so that these provinces are passing through a period of acute depression. The accumulation of unsaleable stock and the depreciation of the rouble caused numerous bankruptcies among merchants. The price of British goods on reaching this area by the Persian Gulf routes is excessive owing to the enormous trans port charges. The increase in the volume of trade through these ports has been accompanied by a decrease in the amount of pack transport available to carry it and the cost of trans port has been hugely inflated. It is also subject to extreme fluctuation, for instance, the rates from Ahwaz to Tehran have recently varied between a minimum of £60 and a maximum of £192 per ton with an average of £93, from Baghdad to Tehran between a minimum of £59 and a maximum of £171 with an average of £101 per ton. 1 Since the British occupation of Baghdad, the Baghdad-Kirmanshah line has become the most important of them. bankruptcies V6ry SCarC6 ^ the depreciation of the rouble has caused many a The decrease is due to idle death of animals during the famine of 1918 and the diversion of transport from its normal work to meet the requirements of the British orces m North, East, and South Persia.262 i 3 The average duration ot transit in each case is 60 days. The result is that a merchant ordering goods from England can have no conception as to what the cost of transport will be by the time his goods arrive. Further obstacles at the present time to British trade in this part of Persia are the irregularity and delays of the postal and telegraph services. Formerly letters from Tehran could reach London in 10 days via the Enzali-Caucasus route. They now take two to three months by the Persian Gulf ports. The excellent overland services of the Indo-European Tele graph Company have been suspended since 1914 and cannot be resumed during the present state of Russia, so that telegraphic traffic is now limited to the Eastern Telegraph Company’s submarine cable, which is congested with British and Indian official telegrams. Non-official telegrams are delayed and an interval of 7 to 14 days elapses between the despatch of a commercial telegram from Tehran to London and receipt of the reply. The detriment to trade of such delays is heightened by the post-war disorganization of European industries and the constant fluctuation of prices. In addition to the uncertainty about the cost of transport in Persia there is an embarassing uncertainty about the current prices of the merchandise in Europe, the chances being that the priced catalogue from a British firm will be out of date and the prices revised by the time a Persian merchant’s'order is received. Owing to such difficulties the supply of foreign manufactured goods does not meet the demand and the markets in Persia are “ starved.” Trade is therefore dislocated, present conditions are only temporary and the supply of foreign commodities to these regions in the near future, not taking into account possible subsequent developments of road and railway communication with the Persian Gulf ports, depends chiefly on :— 1. The reconstruction of Russia and resumption of trade relations. 2. The future of transit via the Caucasus. By transit in bond British goods would enter the area on favour able terms. 3. The advance of the railway from Quraitu and transport facilities via Mesopotamia.263 Local trade is conducted along many mule and camel routes. It consists chiefly in intercharge of commodities between the plateau section and the Caspian provinces, of wheat barlev dried fruits and salt from the former, and rice, charcoal,’ butter’ ghi, cheese oranges and fish from the latter, the towns of Tehran’ Kazvm and Zmjan being the principal centres through which the trade is conducted. The transport charges are very high • the value of a mule-load of rice in Tehran is treble its value in Mazandaran, and the price of charcoal is increased ten-fold srr a Iarge part ° f the ^ In the plains of Gilan and Mazandaran the towns and 1 J^^/m^ekly or biweekly market days, when they are thronged with rustics from the surrounding districts; bringing their produce for sale. g uisrncts Imports and Exports.

Total Exports Total Trade Persia is essentially an undeveloped agricultural and not a manufacturing country, and, as the above statistics indicate, is therefore obliged to import a large quantity of manufactured goods and, with the exception of carpets, exports raw materials and food products. Her imports are in excess of her exports, but from 1900 to 1913 increased production duo to the 'Russia had decreased the disparity, until in . ^ formed M per cent, and exports 43 per cent, of her total com- merce. Tn 1919 however, imports had risen to 64 pe.r cent, and exports fallen to 36 per cent., the cash to pay for this excess of imports being available partly owing to the money subsidy advanced by Great Britain to the Persian Government and to the money spent by the British Force m North Persia. The reduction^)f exports is due chiefly to the closing of the Russian markets, which absorbed more than | of Persian exports, and also in part to the consumption of commodities by this force within the country. The prevailing rate of exchange also tended to increase the disparity between imports and exports. Before 1914 the rate averaged 55 krans per £1, whereas recently it has averaged lees tlian 30 krans per £1. 1“ to the franc the value of the kran has undergone a still greaterrise and a franc whicli' used to be worth 2 krans has fallen to J kran. The purchasing power of the kran in relation to European goods has consequently increased, whereas vice versa Persian products sold abroad, realize a smaller number of krans than formerly and the profit of the Persian exporter is curtailed. It is impossible to estimate the proportion of the imports Imports, passing through the area in transit or their distribution within it. The relative demand for the different articles imported is shown by the above Customs Statistics, viz., sugar, textiles, tea, and various manufactured articles. Owing to its weight and cost of transport from the Persian Sugar. Gulf, the sugar used in this area was of Russian origin, hard loaf sugar being the most popular species and used in great quantities. The tea which entered Enzali was about 90 per cent. Indian Xea - and some 10 per cent. China, conveyed through Russia. Tea passing Kirmanshah was all of Indian origin. The Persians are a nation of tea drinkers and a great quantity is consumed, cheap brands obtaining by far the largest sale. Owing to their lighter weight, the cost of transport of textiles TextlIes *I was less prohibitive of import via the Gulf ports, and English textiles, which were superior in quality to Russian, maintained competition with textiles of Russian manufacture. Exports from this area to the British Empire were very small. Exports.’ The principal exports to Russia were:— Cotton from Kazvin, Mazandaran, and Khorasan. Cotton. The total value of cotton exported from Persia rose from 46,000,000 krans in 1906 to 85,000,000 krans in 1913. The Kazvln supplies were obtained from a wide area including dis tricts as far distant as Isfahan and exported via Enzali. Cotton cultivation has greatly increased, especially in Mazandaran. The export of cotton from Meshed-i-Sar in 1912-13 amounted to 12,742,775 lbs., valued at 20,537,920 krans and in 1914-15 to 17,298,001 lbs., valued at 26,266,250 krans. The export of cotton from Persia to Russia was encouraged by the preferential tariff given to Persian cotton. If this is abolished by Russia it is doubtful whether cotton cultivation in Persia will continue to be profitable except perhaps See paragraph (a) page 260 above.268 Ricf. Carpets. Raisins and dried fruits. Pistachios. Walnuts. Lamb Skins. Pelta. Silk. Fish and Caviane. in Mazandaran, where the cost of production and of export is very low. Rice from Gilan and a small quantity from Mazandaran. The Mazandaran rice was mostly consumed locally or exported to the Elburz villages and Tehran. The total export increased from a yearly average of 26,000,000 krans for the period 1906 to 1910 to an average of 44,000,000 for the period 1911 to 1915. This area contains no important carpet producing district and the carpets exported from Enzali were forwarded through Kazvin from other parts of Persia, e.g., Hamadan. Raisins and Dried Fruits were exported from Kazvin and Khamseh. From Kazvin the annual export amounted to 300,000 1 poudsiof green, and 100,000 pouds of purple raisins. The total export of raisins and dried fruits varied little from year to year. Some 1,500 sacks per annum were sent from the Damghan region and a similar quantity from Kazvin. Some 500 kharvars were exported annually from the Dama vand district. Some 6,000 to 8,000 bales annually used to go to Russia chiefly from Fars, and also a few from Baghdad. Some 100,000 foxes and 10,000 sables were forwarded through Kazvin from Central Persia. Sable, pig, and other skins were also exported from Mazandaran. Silk was exported from Gilan and Mazandaran, most of it to Italy and a little to Marseilles. Owing to the causes described in paragraph (d) p. 296, the amount has decreased greatly of recent years. The total export of fish and caviare through the Customs of Astara, Enzali, Meshed-i-Sar, and Bandar-i-Gaz, i.e., from the South Caspian Fisheries, from March 1913-14 amounted to 17,363,281 lbs. valued at 5,190,186 krans. The total export of fish from Persia has decreased from 50,122,319 lbs. valued at 21,529,165 krans in 1908-9 to&gt; 20,655,622 lbs. valued at 7,886,199 krans in 1913-14. No separate Customs Statistics for these Southern Caspian ports were published before 1912-13 so the figures for 1913-14 cannot be compared with previous years, but as in 1913-14 the 1 1 poud ««= 36export of fish from these ports constituted approximately of the total export from Persia, these 1913-14 figures for them must represent a great falling off from the export of 1908-9. Wool was exported from the large flocks of sheep in Mazan- Wool, daran. A considerable quantity was also used locally. Before 1918 several European firms, principally Russian, Timber, were engaged in cutting and exporting timber and boxwood from Mazandaran, and in 1919, while the Caucasus route was open, orders for boxwood were given by British firms to some Persian landowners. Note.—F urther details about Persian below. products will be given in paragraph (d) C.—British and Foreign Interests. Great Britain and Russia are the only two powers with interests in this area. As described in paragraph (a) above, Russia desired to capture trade in Persia and to control the country for political purposes, the principal Russian interests were financed and assisted by the Russian Government and so held an advantage in competing with British concerns, which were conducted by private enterprise without State support. Since the Russian revolution these Russian institutions have been deprived of State aid and have suffered heavy financial loss owing to the cessation of trade with Russia and the Caucasus and the depreciation of the rouble, so that they have fallen into difficulties and are now unable to maintain any competition. British interests in this area are :— 1. The Imperial Bank of Persia is the most important and flourishing British interest. Its central office is in Tehran and it has branches throughout Persia, those in this area being at Kazvin and Rasht. The Bank’s capital is £650,000 in shares of £6-10-0 and it pays a dividend of 8/- to 10/- per share. It was founded in 1889 as the State Bank of Persia, in virtue •of a Persian concession and a British charter. It has the sole right of issuing bank notes in Persia and may issue them to the extent of its paid up capital guaranteed by a metal reserve of 33 per cent. I *°™--7.5 ur i n S the P eriod of Anglo-Uussian rivalry in Persia the Bank served a useful political purpose. Attached to the Russian loans of 1900 and 1902 was a •condition that for 10 years Persia should contract no further external loan without previous arrangement with the Russian Government. The Imperial Bank, however, by virtue of its position as the State Bank of Persia was able to advance loans to the Persian (rovernment on behalf of Great Britain without violating the letter of the Russian loan contract and so neutralized the danger of Russia acquiring the sole right of granting supplies and securing complete financial control over the Persian Government.To prevent the presentation of a large number of notes at branches, where, owing to transport difficulties, a sufficient quantity of silver might not be forthcoming to meet them, ail notes are stamped with the name of the branch of issue and are not interchangeable. Normally however they will be cashed at other branches on payment of a small discount. In the earliest days of the Bank runs were frequent and they were renewed during the war period when two runs were made on the Tehran Office. In the spring of 1915, owing to the delay in arrival 01 large specie consignments, the Bank was unable to obtain sufficient coin from the Government Mint and the Persian Government passed a decree making the Bank notes inconvertible for about two months. Within less than this period the Bank had, how ever, met all demands. In 1915 the branch of Isfahan, and in 1916 the branches of Hamadan and Kirmanshah were siezed by Turks and Germans- and in 1918 the Jangalis looted the branch at Rasht, but on the whole the Bank prospered exceedingly during the war, and with the disappearance of Russian competition and the development of British trade it has acquired a predominant position. 2. The Indo-European Telegraph Department and Indo- European Telegraph Company, Limited (See under Telegraphs, Chapter X). 3. Persian Transport Company, Limited. —The firm of Lynch Brothers and the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, Limited formed the above Company to take over from the Imperial Bank of Persia the concession obtained by the Bank from the Persian Government for a road from Tehran to Qum-Sultanabad-Khurramabad and Ahwaz. It included also the Lynch interest in the Bakhtiari road and the navigation of the upper Karun. The roads actually completed and in operation are from Tehran to Qum, and from Quin to Sultanabad. At the present time the company is engaged in making a road from Qum to Isfahan. Under the terms of the concession the work of road cons truction must be completed with four years of the present time (1920). The company has the right of levying tolls on all traffic and has the exclusive right of vehicular traffic over its roads. It is- preparing to start a motor service.4. Mesopotamia Persia Corporation Limited. —In 1919 this Corporation took over the long-standing business of Messrs, Lynch Brothers and Stephen Lynch and Company, Baghdad. Its head office is in London with agents in Tehran, Isfahan, Ahwaz and Muhammarah. It is concerned with import and export business to Persia and is agent for the Persian Transport Company and the Euph rates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company. 5. Messrs. Ziegler. —This is the longest established British trading company in Persia with branches at Tehran, Tabriz, Sultanabad, Isfahan, Shiraz, and Bushire. The head office is in Manchester. It is chiefly interested in the import to Persia of Manchester goods. Russian Interests. 1. The Russian Bank called the Banque D’Escompte De Perse.— This institution was founded in 1892 under the name of Banque Des Prets De Perse, under a concession from the Persian Government and was chiefly engaged in pawnhroking business^ After 1900 it very largely increased its business as a bank and started keen competition with the Imperial Bank as described in paragraph (a) above, page 260. It was really a branch of the Russian State Bank, conducted on the same lines as the Russian Bank in China and utilized to further Russian financial control in Persia. During the last 10 years it has been finding its very large advances to Persians difficult of recovery and therefore was obliged to restrict its operations. Since the Russian revolution it has been hard pressed to meet the claims of its depositors. At present it appears only to be endeavouring to realize its assets in order to meet its liabilities in Persia. 2. Russian Road Company. —The company constructed the Rasht-Kazvln-Tehran and some years later in 1907 the Qazian (Enzall)Rasht and the Kazvin-Hamadan roads were opened to traffic. The'road concession was obtained from the Persian Govern ment in 1893. The capital of the company was 3,200,000 roubles, of which 1,700,000 were in shares taken by the public, and 1,500,000 in debentures taken by the Russian Government, which also guaranteed 5 per cent, on the shares. About two-thirds of the272 capital was ' expended on construction. The Company’s in come was derived from tolls levied on vehicles and animals using the road. As in the case of the Russian Bank the Russian Govern ment always afforded the strongest support to the company. Its head office was at Moscow, and its Persian office at Kazvin. In 1918 in consequence of the extension of the British line to Hamadan, Kazvin and Enzali, the G. 0. C. of the British Forces in N. W. Persia found it necessary to exercise a certain control over the traffic, and later to take over the work of cur rent repairs for account of the company. The ordinary manage ment of the road and collection of tolls remained with the company. 3. Enzali Port Trust.—This trust was formed as a subsidiary Company by the Russian Road Company which had obtained a concession for dredging the mouth of the Enzali lagoon and construction of breakwaters and lighthouses. Port dues were to be fixed by a committee with a view to affording the Com pany a net annual profit not exceeding 10 per cent. The concession dates from 1895 for 75 years on condition of maintaining the works in good repair. On expiry of the con cession the works will become the property of the Persian Government. Durmg the British occupation of Baku the port was for a time under British military control and in return certain pay ments were made to the company. The company has latterly been unable to secure a sufficient revenue to meet the expenditure necessary for the upkeep of the port. 4. Caspian Fisheries.—In 1873 the Russian firm of Liono- soff Freres of Moscow obtained a lease of these fisheries from the Persian Government. The lease was renewed at increasing rentals in 1893 and again in 1896 for 20 years until 1925 at an annual rental of 450,000 gold francs. The South Caspian fishing properties included in this lease extended along the whole of the coastline of Persia on the Caspian from Astara to Atreka, the limits of Russian territory, a stretch of about 600 miles. The firm built up a great industry with numerous fishing Stations along the Gilan and Mazandaran 1 1 The fishing centres and operations will be described under para, (d), pp. 293-5.273 .pany’s in- id animals n Govern- company, office at British line ffie Britisk a certain irk of cur- y manage- with the mbsidiary obtained roon and ks were :e Com mon of e con- 'ersian for a ipay- fficienh p of the [ liono- ; es fw® icreastoo p25 at an tbis^ ia on t he t terriW 1 jtind'^ [azandar® coasts and the fishery became one of the most valuable in the world. Fish and caviare were exported via Baku and Astrakhan to Moscow, Petrograd, Ukraine, Poland and other parts of Russia, and to Germany. The 2 Customs Statistics, however, reveal a falling off in the amount of fish exported from the Persian ports during recent years even previous to 1914. The firm claim that their pre-war gross annual income averaged from 4,000,000 to 4,500,000 roubles (£400,000 to £450,000), and expenses from 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 roubles, leaving a profit of 2,000,000 to 2,500,000 roubles. The firm was supported by the Russian Government, and their extensive establishments and operations along the whole Caspian littoral of Persia gained some political significance and furthered the Russian policy of penetration into Northern Persia. This probably accounts for the dislike entertained by Persians towards the firm. In the spring of 1918 after the Russian revolution Lionosoff’s head office was transferred from Moscow to Baku. The fish Exported by the firm from Persia to Baku and Astrakhan was requisitioned by the Bolsheviks who at Astrakhan also forced the firm to grant a great increase of wages to their Russian employes. With the losses of capital in Russia, increased expenses and diminished receipts the firm became embarrassed and remained in debt to the Persian Government for rent of the fishing grounds for 1918-19. Pishing operations were, however, continued in the spring of 1919 until the Persian Government compelled them to desist and seized the stock of fish and caviare at Enzali as a set off to the debts of the firm to the government and to several Persian subjects. A commission was formed of representatives of the firm and the Persian Government, the Russian Vice-Consul of Rasht, •and the British Assistant Political Officer, Enzali, to sell off a portion of the firm’s gear to realize cash for payment of their Persian employes, who, it was feared, if payment were further deferred, might cause a disturbance in Enzali which was under British martial law. As soon as the Persian employes had been paid the British refused to be drawn into participation in ques- 1 1 See para. (6) Exports, p. 268.tions between the firm and the Persian Government, and the British representative was withdrawn. Some British and other financial groups negotiated for the purchase of the Fisheries Concession but without result. The LionosoS Concession was annulled by the Persian Government and a fresh lease was granted to a Russan named Vanitseff who gave a half interest to Tumaniantz Freres. The new concern has taken over the fisheries but is working on a very small scale under disadvantageous circumstances as. the routes for export are closed and it has been unable to arrange installation and gear from Messrs. Lionosoff, who will not acquiesce in the cancellation of their lease. Their employes meanwhile have been dismissed, the stations are falling into ruin and the industry is temporarily suspended. (1920) The markets for the fish and caviare are in Russia and in Central Europe, the machinery and gear required can be con veniently obtained only from Russia and large numbers of Russian employes and fishermen are required to control the industry, so that its revival depends on the state of that country^ 5. Tumaniantz Freres.—They are by far the most important Armenian house of commerce in Persia, which was established some 80 years ago. The principal partners of the firm all resided in Rusgia until a recent date; and the firm in Russia is of Russian and in Persia of Persian nationality. The Russian business was chiefly centred in Baku and Moscow. In Persia their principal offices are at Tehran and Tabriz, and they have smaller branches and numerous agencies throughout the Northern provinces. For some years past the opium revenues of the Persian Government have been farmed out of this firm at an annual rental which would have yielded a large profit, had the distur bed state of the country not rendered it impossible to adminis ter the tax. The chief interests of the firm are the export of Persian produce to Russia and the import of Russian textiles to Persia, and a banking business. They are also estate agents or farmers of their revenues for many Persian landowners. They have some forest and mining properties in Tehran, Gllan, and Mazandaran, and own extensive lands at Enzall and Qazian. They hold half interest with Vanitseff in the Caspian Fisheries Concession. At the present time the firm has very large sums locked up in raw cotton and other Persian products which it is unable to.realize owing to the impossibility of export to Russia, and is consequently unable to meet its current liabilities. 6. Khustaria Concerns. —Mr. Khustaria, a native of Tiflis,. has interested himself in electric lighting and other ventures at Enzali which have not proved successful. The narrow gauge railway from Rasht to Pir-i-Bazar is his Concern, and he main tained a service for passengers and merchandise between Enzali and Rasht by the Murdab route. He also acquired from the Russian Road Company a lease to enable him to start a motor service from Enzali to Tehran, but the enterprise was not taken in hand and the rights are believed to have lapsed. In 1916 he obtained from the Persian Government impor tant concessions for the discovery and exploitation of petroleum deposits and of minerals in the Caspian provinces, and he is at present in Europe seeking capital to develop these concessions. An agent was prospecting on his behalf in the Hazar Jarib district of Mazandaran in the spring of 1920, but no work had been started. 7. Forests.—Some Russian Companies were exporting timber and box wood from Mazandaran but this industry is at present at a standstill owing to the impossibility of export to Europe via, the Caucasus, or to Russia. D.—Products. Mineral deposits abound in the Elburz, and in Khamseh and Minerals. Khalkhal. Some of them have been tentatively surveyed and primitively worked on a small scale by Persian proprietors or foreign lessees, but none scientifically developed. The difficulty of promoting any industry in Persia owing to the apathy, suspicion, and greed of officials and inhabitants, the severe winter, and still more the absence of cheap and easy means of transport, especially in the Elburz, and in Khamseh and Khalkhal the absence of fuel and water, make exploitation costly and difficult. Elburz Area. Mazandardn .—The province of Mazandaran is the richest in minerals. In the Nur district coal and iron are found in close proximity in the foothills and valleys of the Northern slopes of the Nur ridge behind the village of Dar Kalah within 20 miles of the Caspian coast, and about the same distance from the town of Amok276 The iron ore is smelted for local needs in little charcoal furnaces about 3 feet in diameter and 5 feet in height. In the Hazar Jarib district, i.e., upper Tejen valley, south of Sari, coal, iron, and petroleum are found. Mr. *Khustaria holds concessions for the discovery and exploitation of minerals and petroleum deposits and an agent of his was prospecting in this district in the spring of 1920. Petroleum deposits are also said to exist on the Sipah Salar’s estates in Tunakabun and in other parts of the Caspian pro vinces. Some tentative borings were started in Tunakabun by a Russian company but were abandoned. Gildn. Mdsulek iron. Alidbad Copper .—Iron is found near Masuleh and the ore is smelted as in Nur. There is an old copper working near the village of Aliabad in the mountains on the left bank of the Kizil Uzun above Manjll bridge and about 6 miles North West of Manjil village. The working had been abandoned and only very slight traces of copper are visible. Copper is also said to exist in the Kizil Uzun valley above Manjil in Tarum. Elburz Coal Deposits. Localities.—Seams, of coal crop up in the vicinity of latitude 36° from near Damavand, North East of Tehran, to the vicinity of Kazvin, a line exceeding 100 miles in length. The three principal centres whence coal is taken to supply Tehran are :■— Ldr. —North East of Tehran. The annual output in 1890 was estimated at about 4,000 tons. Darbandisar. —Near the sources of the Jajarud, chiefly from the village of Shamshak. ArdahaJc, Fashand, and Abiyak, midway between Tehran and Kazvin situated from 1J to 4 miles North of the road. The annual output in 1890 was estimated at about 11,000 tons. Structure and Quality of Coal. —These seams of coal have been forced up to the surface and exposed by the upheaval which formed the Elburz mountains which are fractures of the earth’s surface along a line of weakness and were piled up by the activity of intense subterranean forces. The strata forced upwards by this convulsion have been rent, contorted, and tilted at steep angles to the horizon, and the coal seams, being softer than the other strata, have been most crushed and broken. See para, (e) above, p. 275.Adjacent strata of harder formations have been forced into them and the coal has been crushed into a fissile slaty structure which allows it to fall to pieces when mined. Seams less damaged are of *good quality. The coal is free from ash and burns with a clear flame and strong heat. The coal near the surface has been further denuded by the effects of weather and the outcrops on the hillsides often show only a few inches of blackened earth, whereas underground the seams thicken and improve in quality, their thickness varying from 6 inches to 4 feet. Method of Mining.—The seams lead into the hillsides verti cally at an average angle of 45° from the surface where the out crop appears. Shafts are run down into the seam until they are swamped by water entering faster than roughly constructed rope rolls with goatskin buckets can bale it out. This generally occurs at a depth of about 10 yards. The shaft is then abandoned and a fresh one commenced, until the hillside becomes riddled with shafts, while the better quality coal at lower levels remains out of reach and untouched by these primitive methods. Possibilities of Development .—The use of scientific appliances would of course increase the output and provide coal of better quality. In the case of the first two above-mentioned coalfields the difficulties of transport and climate would, however, curtail profits. The Lar coal.ield is reached by an easy camel route via Lavasan and a road could be constructed without great difficulty, but it is situated at an average elevation of 7,000' above sea level and is under snow from November to June, when the district is deserted. Darbandisar is equally elevated and can only be reached by pack mules. The track passes up a gorge for 4 miles above Migun which is too rocky and precipitous for camels and would make the construction of a road most difficult. The third coalfield, i.e., around Abiyak, is easy of access from the Tehran-Kazvin road and at an elevation of between 4,000' and 4,400' has not such great extremes of climate . Its output could consequently be increased by proper working. These coal seams in the hills are, however, too contorted and broken to admit of coal mining on a large scale. It is surmised that similar strata and coal seams, undisturbed by the upheaval which raised the mountains, underlie the * It usually, however, reaches Tehran in a pulverised condition after trans- - port on pack animals.278 Forests, alluvial deposit of the Tehran-Kazvln plain which F exceeds 1,000 square miles in area. Should this theory prove correct and the coalfield he capable of exploitation it would become of great value in the event of a railway being constructed from Baghdad to Tehran. Iron. —Near Ardahak, 16 miles East of the Abiyak coalfield, is a deposit of iron, 30 yards deep and 70 to 80 yards thick. The ore is 40| per cent, pure iron. Khamseh and Khalkhdl. Copper, alum, lead, mercury .— Copper is said to exist in Tarum and near Zinjan, and alum in Tarum. Lead is found in many places in these provinces, especially near Anguran, 45 miles West South-West of Zinjan. The Anguran lead mine is now closed. It was situated at an elevation of 8,210' and only worked in summer. Mercury is found in the district of Afshar, west of Anguran. Kharagdn. —In 1910 a survey was made by a'Frenchman in Kharagan-i-Khalaj about 12 miles East of Nubaran. In'an area of 7 square miles near the villages of Azbazan, Turchak, and Bivaran he found loads of copper carbonate, barytine, iron, manganese, chromium, aluminium phosphates and sulphates. The boundaries of thp wooded area of the Caspian provinces have been roughly indicated in Chapter II “Geography” p. 95-6, and are shaded green on the map at the end of the book. The jungle in the lowlands for the most part consists of small trees between the areas cleared for rice cultivation, ^and the main forest is in the foothills and valleys of the ‘ Miyanband ’ and extends to an elevation of between 5,000' and 6,000', above which the trees become stunted. The forests of Nur, Kujur and Tunalcdbun are considered the best, and as the hills approach nearer to the sea in these districts they are more accessible than the forests in the East of Mazandaran. West of Tunakabun in Gxlan the trees are smaller than in Mazandaran. Boxwood grows to rare profusion and perfection in many parts of Mazandaran. It is found close to the sea m the narrow coast strip between Mazandaran and Gilan, but most of the thick stems have been cut, and good boxwood is now found principally in higher levels. There is much box in the Shimarud valley between Siyah- kal, near Lahijan, and Dailiman, but none is seen between Manjll and Rasht.280 Agricnltnre. General. Wheat, barley, and lucerne are successfully cultivated throughout the area except in the Caspian lowlands, where the abundant water supply is utilized for rice, which is exported in great quantities. Rice is also grown in the interior in hot well watered districts, such as Mianeh and the Kizil Uzun valley above the Qaplan Kuh bridge, and in Varamin and Khar. The product of these regions is, however, inferior to the rice of the Caspian lowlands. Millet is also grown in some districts. Peas, melons, beans, lentils, potatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, marrows, etc., are widely cultivated. Every kind of English vegetable will thrive in Persia, but the Persians generally show little appreciation for them. Fruit is abundant and cheap, and, considering the primitive, unscientific methods of cultivation, of remarkably good quality and large quantities principally of dried fruit (khushkibar), e.g., raisins, apricots, plums, almonds, walnuts and pistachios, and of oranges from the Caspian provinces, were formerly exported to Russia. Wine is made chiefly at Kazvin and ‘arak,’ a strong spirit, is distilled from raisins. Of oil yielding plants the castor oil plant and linseed are cultivated in parts of the plateau, and olives flourish at Manjil, Rudbar, and two or three other villages in the Safid Rud valley. Cotton is grown in many 1 places up to 5,000but the chief cotton producing district in this area is Mazandaran, where the crop is of very good quality and until 1914 was increasing enormously. Its staple is not short, though not as long as American cotton. It is cleaned in gins imported from America. The seed, a very valuable article, is generally wasted as, unless the oil is extracted, it is liable to ferment and catch fire. It is used for feeding cattle or burned by the owners of gins for heating their boilers. Cotton grown in other parts is inferior to the Mazandaran product, being coarser and shorter in staple. Tobacco of the ‘ tutun ’ variety was introduced into Gilan in 1875 and tobacco cultivation in Gilan is increasing every year. Tea also is a recent introduction into Gilan and has given good results and there is a prospect of tea gardens becoming popular in Gilan and Mazandaran. A few sugar canes are grown by the peasantry in Gilan and Mazandaran for their own use. The sugar is crudely extracted and very coarse. 1 e.g., in Tamm, i.e., the Kizil Uzun valley above Manjil.Honey bees are kept in most Elburz anH in ™ in quant.ty o£ wool is exported, but the number of sbeep com ' derably decreased during the famine year 1917,18 The eW mdk is turned into cheese.

The good harvests of 1919 and 1920 have, however, reduced prices, and if the harvests continue to be good and the country is not overwhelmed by any political cataclysm, conditions should become more normal and a general decrease in the cost of living may ensue. A list of prices of foodstuffs at some of the principal towns in this area during the spring and summer of 1920 is given on p. 306. In amplification of this summary, a more detailed descrip tion of some of the principal products and the' method of their cultivation is given below. Wheat and barley are the staple products of all the high lands and of the Persian plateau section, and they are grown up to an elevation of nearly 10,000' in some patches of summer cultivation (mazra’eh) belonging to villages in the valleys below. The principal districts in this area which grows large quan tities of wheat and barley for export surplus to their own needs are in order of importance:— 1 Khar, Waramln, and 3 Shahriyar, 3 Sauj Buiagh (supply Tehran). Khamseh (supplies Gilan). Rahmand-Zahrah, South of Kazvin (supplies Kazvin and sends surplus to Tehran). Kujur (supplies the surrounding districts, i.e. the rice pro ducing Caspian lowlands and the mountain valleys of Nur, Laura, Talaghan, and Alamut, which cannot feed their population). Kalardasht. Do Hazar (a valley tributary to th^ Seh Hazar of Tuna- kabun). Dailiman (supplies the East of Gilan). The crops are divided into ‘ unirrigated ’ (daimi) and ‘ irri gated’ (abl). In ‘ yailaq ’ districts of undulating country with a fair rainfall, the ‘ unirrigated ’ crops are more extensive, * 1 Khar is watered by the HablehrM and is very rich soil. * Varamin is watered by the Jajarud. Its supply is less reliable than the Hablehrud. „ . , _ ' , * Shahriyar and Sauj Buiagh are watered by the Kara] and Kharrud and 1 Qanats.’ The soil is more stony and inferior to Khar and Varamin.but all villages also have ‘ irrigated ’ crops on which they depend in case of a failure of the ‘ unirrigated.’ In low lying districts the crops are entirely dependent on irrigation, and the cultiv able area is limited by the water supply. The primitive Persian method of cultivation by which the surface of a wide area is just ‘ scratched ’ is most wasteful and unsuited to the country, which requires ‘ intensive ’ cultiva tion to secure economy in the use of the water and a heavier yield. The soil generally is good and the experiments of deep and thorough ploughing made at the Agricultural school estab lished at Karaj in 1918-19 under M. Schricher, gave excellent results. The “unirrigated” land if very extensive is cultivated once in three years, but most of it is cultivated one year and left fallow the next. The “irrigated” land when possible is left fallow every other year or 1 2 lucerne, beans, cucumbers, etc., alternate with wheat-and barley, but in the confined moun tain valleys with little cultivable land the people are often obliged to grow wheat or barley on it every year, with the result that the soil becomes very impoverished. Irrigated land of this kind receives a small quantity of manure and ash. The finest “ unirrigated ” crops are produced in Khamseh and 3 Khalkhal, which have good spring 4 rains, and the yield is often fifteen fold or more per seed sown. Elsewhere, for instance in Dailiman, 10 fold is considered a good crop. The best “ irrigated ” crops are raised in Khar, Varamin and Shahriyar. Khar is reputed to yield up to 25 fold, and Varamin up to 15 fold in good years, but recently the Varamin crops have been attacked by blight and the yield reduced, Shahriyar from 10 to 12 fold. The Saveh district yields about 10 fold. In Kazvin, Kharagan, and the remaining districts enumerated above 10 fold is a good yield frequently not attained, the average being from 6 to 10 fold. 1 The school closed down for lack of funds in 1920. 2 These crops are called “ saifi ” or summer crops as opposed to wheat and barley, which are called “ shatwi ” or winter crops. The term applied to the whole area cultivated by a village in one year, i.e. embracing both “ saifi ” and “ shatwi ” is “ ayish.” Thus if a village possesses two “ ayish,” one is left fallow each year, and, if it possesses three, two of them are left fallow, and to inquire whether the land of a village is left fallow one asks how many “ ayish” it possesses (chand ayish darad). * The wretched condition of this area has been mentioned in Chapter IV, para. &lt;u&gt;, p. 168. Most of the land is now left uncultivated. * See Chapter III, paragraph (b) rainfall, p. 146.284 Quality. In Kalardasht and other districts in the highlands of the Caspian provinces water is utilized for irrigation if required but the rainfall is often sufficient. In the impoverished strips of land in the Elburz valleys the yield seldom, if ever, exceeds, and frequently is less than, five fold. *Ploughing is done by oxen with primitive little ploughs and steep hillsides are often ploughed with great labour. It is usually only done once in autumn before sowing, but land left fallow sometimes receives a preliminary ploughing in spring. Wheat must be sown in the autumn, barley can also be sown in the spring, but autumn sowing is better. For “ unirrigated ” crops one or two falls of rain are required in autumn, before the frost, to cause the seed to sprout, and several falls in the spring to prevent the blades becoming parched by the hot sun. Irrigated drops require one or two waterings in autumn and usually three in the spring, the first called “ khaki,” to soften the soil, the second “ gulab ” to make the ears sprout, the third “ dahnab ” to make them swell, and sometimes also a fourth, the amount of artificial irrigation required depending of course on the amount of the rainfall. The crops are harvested from June to August according to the elevation, when they are cut with small hand sickles, and after a few days carried to the threshing floor (khurman), and trodden out by oxen to separate the grain from the straw, which is stored as “ bhusa ” for fodder during the winter. Villages in the Caspian lowlands fetch their requirements of wheat and barley from the hills, and the Mazandaranis also imported them from the Turkomans. The Turkoman supplies * * Oxen usually plough from morning to noon, when they go to graze. In ‘qlshiaq ’ districts, e.g. round the town of Saveh, seed is sown thickly in order to produce a thick crop and protect the roots from the sun. In ‘yailaq ’ districts on the other hand seed is sown thinly to give free access to sun and air. The richer the soil the shallower is the ploughing. Apart from the sowing, the depth of ploughing, and the flat or hilly nature of the land, other factors of course are the quality of the oxen and the will of the worker. The amount of seed which can be sown in the area ploughed in a season by one pair of oxen accordingly varies very greatly in different districts, from a minimum of 1 to 2 kharvars to a maxi mum of 8 to 10. In the Kazvin Area the amount of seed sown is i Tabrfzis (13 or.) of millet or 2 Tabrfzis (13 lbs.) of wheat or 21 Tabrfzls (16 1 lb?.) of barlev per 250 square zars (approximately metres) or 300 square zars if the soil is sandv (rfgzar). “ Bazr ” or “ Tukhm Afshan ” is the term applied to the area ^pwn with a particular quantity of seed. The extent of land cultivated each year by a village is expressed by its seed capacity in number of kharvars (e.g. “ Chand kharvar bazr,” or “ tukhm,” '• afshan darad ” ?) or, less commonly, in terms of the number of yoke of ploughing oxen (Chand joft gav darad ?).have fallen off of late owing to disturbed conditions, and wheat and barley have been introduced to the Mazandaran plain, chiefly around Sari, but have not given good results. The ears were poor and undersized and inferior to the hill crops, and the wheat is unwholesome. Bread made from it causes dizzi ness and sickness in strangers, evidently due to some foreign elements being mingled with it as very thorough washing of the grain before grinding lessens its ill-effect. Wheat and barley produced in the highlands of the Caspian provinces within the wooded area are darker in colour than the products of regions with the Persian plateau climate. The grain generally, except of the Caspian lowlands, is of good quality, but owing to indifferent cleaning and rough grinding between soft grindstones the flour is often gritty. The Persians consider the grain from “unirrigated” land to be of better quality than grain from “ irrigated.” Wheat and barley are divided between landowner and Di V j g j on ^ peasant on the theory of 5 shares for the land, water, oxen, Harvest seed and labour. On the 1 average the landlord probably takes landlord and from a third to a half, out of which he must pay the government Peasantry, taxes. Lucerne is cut two or three times between early summer and late autumn. It is dried and given to animals chopped and mixed with bhusa during the winter. There are two varieties grown. Rice is the staple product of the Caspian Rowlands, where the abundant water supply and hot damp summer are favourable R ' to it, and it is cultivated on the “ China ” system of transplantation &lt;see below). It is called “ wet ” (abi) as distinct from the “ dry ” crop (khushkizar) of wheat, barley and cotton, and the malarial * 1 2 1 No hard and fast rule can be made for the mode of division, which varies in different districts, but the following are typical examples. The grain is collected on the threshing floor. Certain local charges, amounting to about 6 per cent, of it, the amount of the government mallat (land tax) and the seed grain for the next year are deducted and the balance is divided as follows:— (1) when the landlord supplies the land, water, oxen and seed and the peas antry the labour, they divide the balance equally between them. (2) when the landlord supplies the land and water, and the peasantry the seed, oxen and labour, the landlord takes one-fifth of the balance and the peasantry four-fifths. The landlord usually comes oft well out of the transaction (see Chapter V. pp. 209-230). Some smaller landlords also farm their own land by hired labour instead of letting it out to the peasantry. * It is also grown up a few of the river valleys to a height of 4,000'.mosquitoes bred in the paddy swamps contribute to the poison- ously unhealthy nature of these regions during summer. Rice has been produced in constantly increasing quantities on the deltas of the Caspian rivers, to the extent to which water is available for their irrigation. The rice for export to Russia was grown principally in Gilan and Tunakabun and in Enzali in December 1919 there were 2 motor driven rice cleaning plants using the regular double mill with one shelling stone and one polishing stone. The financial results achieved were a real success. Mazandaran rice is con sumed locally and by the mountain villagers to the South, and exported to Tehran. The chief rice producing district in Mazan daran is Amol. The rice is of several varieties and qualities, but the principal distinction is between ‘Sadri 5 and ‘ Girdeh.’ ‘ Sadri ’ is the finest quality and when cooked produces the very white, dry rice loved by Persians. ‘ Girdeh ’ is of many kinds but when cooked all become more or less of a pudding. They are eaten by the poorer classes in Persia and were the species exported to Russia. ‘ Sadri ’ is rather more difficult to cultivate than ‘ Girdeh ’ and only certain land and water suit it. ‘ Sadri ’ commands a 1 higher price, but the yield per seed sown is about 20 per cent, less (see below). Land for rice cultivation (shallkarl) if sloping, as in the Talar valley, must be terraced and banks constructed to hold the water (marzbandi). In the plains the slope is so slight that much less banking is necessary. The land is ploughed in April and then flooded until it becomes thoroughly waterlogged, when it is ploughed a second and third time, the oxen, plough and ploughman sinking deep in the morass. Meanwhile the seed is thickly sown in a small enclosure or “nursery” (khazaneh). After a month when the young plants are 5' high they are transplanted to the field, every plant being inserted separately with an interval of 12' between it and the next plant (nisha kardan). The transplanting in the Mazandaran plain is done by men, but in Niir, Kujur, Tunakabun and Gilan usually by women. 1 1 Usually 50 to 80 kriins more per kharvar in Tehran.']A fortnight after transplanting, weeding (vigin) commences. The weeds are not plucked out but trampled down into the mud, a laborious and unhealthy process nearly always done by women. This system of transplanting is called the “ China ” system as opposed to the “ Italian ” 'system where seed is scat tered over the field as in wheat and barley sowing. The fields must be kept permanently under water for 2 to 3 months during which the rice reaches a height of about 5'. It is reaped in September with hand sickles leaving about 1 foot of stubble and is thrashed immediately. After thrashing the grain may be dried in the sun, but more usually is placed in a small closed bam with a slow fire underneath it and parched for 4 or 5 days, after which it is ready for the mill (abdhang). The process of milling is as follows :— The 1 grain is poured into a circular hollow of stone, about 4 |' in diameter inserted in the floor, and pounded by a log fixed to a long beam which is worked by a water wheel and rises and falls like a sledge hammer, breaking the dry husk off the rice. The rice is then taken up and cleaned in a sieve. The millers (Abdhangchi) are handsomely remunerated and it is a popular saying that all the profit of rice cultivation in Mazandaran finds its way into their pockets. They are mostly dwellers in the“ yailaq ” who come down to the plains in autumn and stay until spring. The landlords’ rice is all milled by the Abdhangchi but the peasants’ rice is hand-milled. In districts where the soil is rich, rice may be sown every year on the same land, but the usual practice is to raise a crop for two or three years in succession and then to leave the land fallow for a similar period. In Mazandaran on sloping land which does not become waterlogged, a crop of barley is some times raised every third year. The cultivation of rice is most laborious, but the higher price and much higher yield, averaging from 250 to 350 grains of rice for every seed sown, makes it more profitable than wheat and barley, and consequently^in districts where both will thrive, rice is the more popular crop. The landlords of Gilan andlMazandaran depend on the lice harvest for their income as they take a fixed amount of the cro p as rent. The amount varies greatly in different districts, 1 Before milling the rice is called “shall” or loosely “jau” (barley), when husked it is called “ brinj ” (rice). Barley is called “ jau-i-kuhi ” to distinguishV 288 Bice in the plateau area.

Fruit, and vineyards flourish around the plateau villages up to 6,000'. The soil and climate are extremely favourable and great quantities of fruit are produced, but, except for a few gardens in the towns, no effort is made to improve its quality and the trees are grown quite unscientifically. The fruits of the plateau are :— peaches, apricots, cherries, grapes, plums, quinces, pears, apples, walnuts, almonds, pistachios. The most productive districts are Tarum and Khamseh, but in Khamseh the weather is sometimes too cold and nips the buds in spring, or the summer is too short and the fruit does notripen. The valleys also South of Damavand and Firuzkuh are full of fruit orchards, and walnuts are exported from Damavand. Abhar and Kazvin produce quantities of grapes and export the raisins, and Kazvin wine has a reputation among Persians. Pistachios are grown and exported from Kazvin. In the Caspian provinces in the lowlands many kinds of oranges flourish and the fruit was sent to Russia. In Tunakabun every village has orange gardens, but the oranges of Ashraf are the most esteemed. The best oranges are left on the trees for two years to sweeten. Other fruits of the lowlands are peaches, cherries, apples, pears, figs, and pomegranates. Fruit trees are more plentiful in Mazandaran than in Gilan. Walnut trees grow well, but produce fewer nuts than on the plateau, and vines, although wild vines cling to the forest trees, do not bear. In the Caspian highlands, Kalardasht and the valleys near Pul have splendid walnut, pears, and some apple trees, but olsewhere fruit is scarce. In the gardens of Europeans at Tehran raspberries, currants, strawberries, and all English fruit are grown with excellent results. Olives are cultivated in the Safid Rud valley below Manjil Olives, at Rudbar. Kalishtar Cj p»In Rahmatabad Hirzehvll, J and are the staple products of these villages. A few also are grown at Manjil and some villages of Amarlu and Tarum, he., up the Shahrud and Kizil Uzun, but they are not found in any290 other Mazandaran or Gilan valley. Tradition says that they were imported from Syria by a colony sent by Timur. The number of trees at Rudbar, the principal centre of olive cultivation, is said to be about 200,000. They attain a cir cumference of 4'and are left to grow to a height of 30 to 40 and not kept small by pruning. As in other parts of the world the olive crop is very variable, and it is generally believed to be good in alternate years. The olives are gathered in December and January, usually before they are fully ripe for fear of frost. The percentage of oil extracted is very low, averaging less than 20 per cent. The trees are grown from seeds and not from cuttings as in Europe. The seed is sown in a hot-house about December and in May, when the saplings have reached a height of about 1', they are transplanted and rigorously pruned. The young tree begins to bear about the fourth year. The trees depend on irrigation and are watered in the latter part of May and a second time in August. The crop used to be bought up by a Russian, but is now disposed of locally and the wardens are generally let out for a fixed price or quantity of oil. It is usually stipulated that on expiry of the lease the owner must buy trees at a certain proportion of their value or else that the lease shall be renewable at a slightly higher figure. Some of the olives are preserved in salt for eating, but most are utilised to produce :— 1 . Oil for soap boiling or for lubricating (the large quantity). 2. Comestible oil. For (1). They are first laid out to dry and afterwards heated on a copper tray to evaporate any water remaining in them. They are then put into small pits (chanika) and left to • rot ’ until spring, when the stones are removed and the pulp is placed in bags and beaten to exude the oil, which is then manufactured locally into soap. (2). Forward contracts are made by contractors in Rasht who spread salt on the olives on delivery to prevent fermen tation until sufficient have been accumulated to start work, when they have them ground on a millstone into a pulp which is placed in goats’ hair bags and softened by boiling water. The bags are flattened out, piled up and pressed, so that the oil flows out into a reservoir. Hot water is again poured on to it, the oil comes to the surface, and is drawn off and poured into pots until the dregs are settled, when it is transferred to large jars. If left to stand in them it becomesperfectly clear after two months, or it may be filtered at once, in which case, however, it is supposed to lose some of its flavour. It is then bottled or sold in bulk. Cotton will grow in Persia up to an altitude of 5,000', and is cultivated in various parts of the plateau and in Tar am, hut the most important crops in this area were produced in Mazan- daran for export from Meshed-i-Sar and they had increased enormously between 1 * 1905-1915. The favourable conditions under which Persian cotton was admitted into Russia, the facilities for export from Meshed-i-Sar entailing no long land transport, and the success of the crop, made cotton cultivation the most profitable and popular form of agriculture with the Mazandaran 3 peasantry. Land also was available without interfering with existing crops. The rivers only provide sufficient water for a very limited area of rice, which was the staple crop of the lowlands, and large areas remained jungle clad or were used as pastures. Cotton requires a drier sqil and in Mazandaran needs no artificial irrigation, so that these areas, which were unsuitable for rice, were well adapted for cotton cultivation. It was grown chiefly in the vicinity of Barfarush and in the plain between Barfarush and Ashraf. West of Barfarush and in Tunakabun and 4 Gilan the soil is said to be too moist for cotton to thrive. The land utilized for cotton is usually left fallow every other year, or wheat and barley may alternate with cotton. Trenches are dug round the fields for drainage and the soil is ploughed in autumn and a second time in spring before the seed is sown. It requires to be well turned and softened. The task of weeding to prevent the young cotton being smothered is very laborious and is usually performed by women. The crop is ready in October and must be plucked before the weather becomes too cold. The yield of cotton is said to average from 1,600 lbs to 2,200 lbs. per “jarib.” Owing to the impossibility of export to Russia or via the Caucasus there is now no market for Mazandaran cotton and its cultivation has temporarily ceased. 1 See paragraph (6) above, Exports p. 267-8. * See paragraph (a) above, Trade Generally, p. 260. * The landlord’s share of the recently introduced cotton crop was much less than his share of rice which was fixed by long standing usage. 4 The cotton exported through Enzallcame from Kazvln and other districts and was not grown in GHan. Cotton,292 Stobaeeo. STeo* The cultivation of tobacco in Gilan is of increasing import ance and the crop for 1919 was estimated at 7,000,000 lbs. as compared with 1,800,000 lbs. in 1910. Prior to 1915 tobacco was exported from Rasht to Turkey. The price in 1910 was about 50 krans per poud (36 lbs.). The industry is entirely in the hands of the peasant classes, who are ignorant of all modern methods. In 1919 samples of the different grades of Gilan tobacco ( were sent to London by the British Vice-Consul in Rasht for examination by experts. During recent years several tea gardens have been started in Gilan between Labij an and Imamzadeh Hashim and they are said to contain about 250,000 bushes. Further East in Tunakabun on the Northern slope of a low ridge just South of Khurramabad there are two small gardens : one of them called Manzariyeh belongs to Sipah Salar. It was planted about 12 years ago and contains 2,500 bushes, which appear to flourish with very litfle attention. The leaves are plucked 3 times in the spring and once in the autumn and the total annual yield of tea averages about 105 lbs. Leaves of different sizes are all mixed together and the tea is very crudely prepared. The leaves are spread out on trays for 24 hours to dry and are then hand rolled and rubbed for 2 hours when they are squeezed tightly in a pulp into a basin and left to stand for 4 hours during which its colour changes from green to brown. The pulp is then removed and spread over muslin shelves in a chest over a dull fire for 4 hours and the tea is ready for use. A refined tea cannot be expected from such primitive methods and in the spring when freshly prepared it had a green and bitter taste. Some of the Lahxjan tea, however, has an excellent flavour, but, like China tea, is lacking in colour. The supply is of course very limited and locally it commands a high price, about 130 krans per 6 | lbs. as compared with about 40 krans per 6 J lbs. for imported tea. British officers in Gilan in 1918-19, who claimed a knowledge of Indian and Ceylon tea gardens considered that Gilan has great tea-growing possibilities. The whole of the country from Astara to Astarabad exhibits similar features and if tea bushes thrive at Lahijan and in Tunakabun, they could pre sumably be grown all along the lower slopes facing the Caspian*293 la 1919 it was rumoured that a company had been formed ing imp® to plant gardens, but under the disturbed political conditions ,000 Ife as at present prevailing any development is impossible. Some cane-sugar is produced in Mazandaran. A refining auga*„ factory was opened in Barfarush in 1845 but closed down after a few years, and the sugar is extracted from the canes by primi tive methods and only used for local consumption. Prior to. 1914 the production was falling off but recently, owing to the great increase in the price of imported sugar due to the stoppage of the Russian supply, the area of sugar-cane cultivation has been greatly extended. The cultivation is near the foot of the hills, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Sari and Barfarush, e.g., the buluk of Babul Kinar. Sugar-canes were introduced into Gilan about 1870 but their cultivation never became very popular and decreased, as in Mazandaran, until only a few fields remained in Rumen, Tulim, and Gaskar. The bees are kept in cylindrical clay hives about 1 foot in Honey, diameter from which the honey is taken in September. When fresh from the hive the large round combs of brown or golden colour contain excellent honey, but by the time they reach the towns they have been squashed into an unappetizing looking mess, and the honey must be run out of the wax and for 2 cleaned. sin and Few carpets are woven in this area and the Fisheries and indnatrin. es from Silk production in the Caspian provinces are the only industries ad of importance. No other i n i an a saa is so well stocked with fish as the Caspian. Caspian Fisheries. The principal varieties are :■ Sturgeon (sagmahi). Perch (safidmahi). Carp (kupur). Bream (subulu). Salmon (mahi azad). These fish swarm round the mouths of the rivers which they ascend to spawn, sturgeon and salmon in autumn and spring round the mouths of the rivers from the fountains, and perch. t giian 1)»* carp, etc., in winter round the mouths of the ’Murdab streams. 1 For the distinction between these two types of rivers see Chapter II, Geo graphy, p. 99.V 294 The South Caspian fishing properties held by Messrs . 1 Liono- sofl were divided into 5 groups centred at Astara, Enzali, Hasan Kiade (Safidri group), Meshed-i-Sar, Astarabad. 1. Astdrd group. —The catch was chiefly ‘ Soudak ’ (sandre) up to approximately 120 , 000 2 pouds, carp, kutoum, and bream approximately 15,000 pouds. » Some 25,000 pouds of sturgeon, were caught yielding 3,000 to 3,500 pouds of caviare. The sturgeon were delivered to the Safidri refrigerator. 2. Enzali group. —This group has a refrigerator. The catch resembles that of Astara without the sturgeon. 3. Safidri group. —This group has special refrigerators at Hasan Kiade for sturgeon, which is the principal catch. There are three species of sturgeon and the catch averaged 35,000 pouds yielding 5,000 to 6,000 pouds of caviare. 4. Meshed-i-Sar group. —No details about this group are available, but a fair number of sturgeon were caught. 5 . Astarabdd group. —The catch is chiefly ‘ vobla,’ and averaged 25,000,000 fish weighing 220,000 to 230,000 pouds, carp, bream, and kutoum 40,000 pouds and sturgeon 15,000 pouds yielding about 2,000 pouds of caviare. The ‘ vobla ’ were salted and the sturgeon sent to the ‘ Safidri ’ refrigerator. The total annual yield of the fishery was accordingly stated to be about 600,000 pouds (2,400,000 lbs.) of fish and 11,000 pouds (440,000 lbs.) of caviare. The sturgeon is considered unclean by the Muhammadans and the fishery concession grants the lessee a monopoly of catching them. No monopoly is given for other species of fish and local fishermen can catch them without restriction. These figures show that the most productive river for sturgeon is the Safid Rud which enters the Caspian at Hasan Kiad During the latter half of April and early May, hundreds of them are caught daily. Ropes are stretched from bank to bank near the mouth of the river with cords a few feet long attached at intervals of a couple of feet. At the end of each cord is a large iron barbed hook, which trails downstream and sinks. * * 1 See paragraph (e)'ahove, p. 272. * 1 pond = 36 lbs.295 iSsrs^Liono- The sturgeon on their way up the river swim low and are nzali, Hasai foul hooked.

The Safld Rud is too big a river for fixed traps, but on most streams reed barriers supported by timber are constructed from bank to bank within half a mile of the sea. Small apertures are left in the barrier through which the fish nose their way. A few yards up-stream is a second barrier without any apertures. The fish congregate in this confined space between the two barriers and scores of perch, carp, and bream, etc., are brought up at every cast of a net. The most prolific of the Murdab streams are the Namakab- rud, the boundary of Kalaristaq and Tiinakabun, midway between the Chains and Seh Hazar rivers, and the Larim between 1 The weight of the sturgeon averages between 30 and 40 lbs.v 296 Silk. Sari and Barfarush in Mazandaran. The fish caught in the traps are sold locally or salted and sent to Tehran. Salmon enter all the rivers from the mountains, but the Seh Hazar, Chalus and 1 Babul are by far the most prolific. The season is from March to June, and September to November. A barrier is constructed as in the Murdab streams, but it is single and the fish on entering the aperture find them selves in a small cage from which they cannot discover the exit. Owing to diversion of their water for irrigation, the streams are very small and shallow and no salmon can pass the barriers except when floods from the mountains sweep them away, and enable the fish to run unimpeded to the upper reaches to spawn. In the spring of 1920 the Chalus was open, or only partially closed, for several weeks and many fish must h^ve entered the river, whereas in 1919 the barrier stood for nearly the whole season and fish in the upper reaches seemed very scarce. But for these floods salmon would presumably be unable to spawn and would be exterminated. The annual catch from the mouth of the Seh Hazar at Shahsavar probably averages from 1,500 to 2,500 salmon, from the Chalus it is less as floods are more frequent. The fish average 8 to 10 lbs. each, and seldom exceed 18 lbs. They are sold locally, but a considerable number are taken by “ eharvadars ” who make forced marches to Tehran. The silk products of Gilan and Mazandaran first draw the attention of the adventurous Muscovy Company (British) to these parts of Persia for the development of a silk trade via Russia and of a Route to the East in the 16th and 17th centuries The silk industry has experienced many vicissitudes at different periods. In Gilan the total amount of silk produced in 1861 exceeded 2 , 000,000 lbs. and it was the staple industry of the province. Silk worm diseases however made their appearance and proved so deadly that by 1889 production had almost ceased, and rice and tobacco had been introduced as a substitute. After 1890 a steady revival followed the introduction of seeds (i.e., silk worm’s eggs) imported from Brusa. It had been found that seeds from Brusa and Gimlek in Asia Minor, produced according * * Salmpn are said to rim up the Babul in winter rather than in autumn and spring as m the other rivers.

Prom 1907 to 1911, 230,000 to 300,000 2 * boxes of seeds were imported' each year valued at the Customs at between £45,000 and £50,000, and an annual average of 2,500,000 lbs. of dried silk cocoons were exported principally to Italy (Milan) and also to Prance (Lyon). In addition about 3 30 per cent, of this amount were spun locally. In 1912-13 1,673,023 lbs. of dried cocoons were exported from Enzali valued at 7,635,789 krans, about £138,000 at the rate of exchange then prevailing. The price of 4 fresh cocoons in Rasht ranged from 20 to 30 krans per man shah (13 lbs.). The trade was principally in the hands of Greeks, chief of whom were Messrs. Pascalides, and Tumaniantz Bros. Exaggerated, credits were gradually spoiling the trade and after 1907 practically no margin of profit was left to the exporter. The latter bought cocoons by advancing money at no fixed purchase rate, as the rate was not settled on until after the cocoons had been disposed of in Europe. As an extreme in stance the price of cocoons exported in 1910 was only settled in June 1911 or less than a month before the 1911 crop. Owing to competition between exporters the sums advanced by them to the producers were often in excess of the value of the cocoons and the producer would promise to pay the balance in cocoons the following year. Production during the war fell off owing to the difficulties of importing good quality and the use of inferior seeds, and epidemics of 5 Muscardine, 6 Pimprine, and 7 Flacherie. The latter reappeared annually for 5 or 6 years until in 1919 the silk industry of Gilan had entirely ceased, the peasants prefer ring to cut down the mulberry bushes and cultivate rice and tobacco. In the winter 1919-20 a fresh start was made. Some 16,000 boxes of seeds of fair quality were imported to Rasht, which 1 Monsieur Lafont director of the station Sericicole of Montpellier, made experiments at Rasht during 3 consecutive years, and is of opinion that eggs of good and sound quality could easily be produced In Gilan. gg Ihe majority of boxes are 25 grammes, a few 30 grammes in weight. .

The result would have been known by July 1920, but was presumably a failure owing to the Bolshevik inroad. In Mazandaran silk production had for long been on a much smaller scale than in Gllan. In 1909 it was resuscitated by Messrs. Tumaniantz, followed by Messrs. Stevens, a long estab lished British firm in Persia, trading principally in Tabriz, who two years later started a silk business in Barfarush. These firms imported seeds and distributed them free to the producers who in return paid J of the crop as the price of the seed. The production of silk was limited by the small area of existing mulberry plantations, while fresh plantations take three years to grow. The total weight of cocoons produced in Mazandaran annually during these years 1911-1914 did not exceed 150,000 lbs. The Mazandaranis were less experienced than the Gilakis in rearing the silkworms and the percentage of cocoons from the seeds was little more than half the ordinary percentage in Gilan. It was found that men were careless in sorting the cocoons and the “ mullahs ” raised considerable opposition to the employ ment of female labour. The trouble proved disproportionate to the profit and in 1914 Messrs. Stevens sold their Barfarush business. In 1919-20 no eggs were imported and as in Gilan the indus try has ceased. « So long as the political conditions of these provinces remain uncertain and seeds cannot be imported via the Caucasus, there is no prospect of a revival of the silk industry. Owing, however, to the present slump in rice and cotton landlords and peasants have no incentive to cut down any more mulberry plantations to make room for other crops, so that should stable conditions be restored the prospect would immedi ately improve. Pre-war prices of silk in Europe would presumably fail to make its production remunerative to the Gilaki, as in addition to receiving fewer x krans for his cocoons he would be able to299 t to prate 3t during tli germs of I .920, tat TJi road. en on a m«t suscitated li[ a longest y in Tabrit iriisli.

There is, however, a world shortage of silk and its enhanced price in European markets may counterbalance the effect of the present rate of exchange which is so unfavourable to the Persian producer. The following extract from a Report on Silk in January 1917 b;^ Mr. H. L. Rabino, British Vice-Consul at Rasht, is entitled “ Sericulture as conducted nowadays in Gllan.” “Silk worm eggs are purchased in winter, the terms being settled in writing, hut the purchaser can take delivery at any time up to 20 days, sometimes one month after ‘ Xauruz' (21 March) that is until the mulberry leaves have come out. The boxes containing the eggs which until then were kept in a cool place, are exposed to a moderate heat in some shady corner of the house. (1) They are never exposed to the full heat of the sun which would scorch and destroy them. The young worms are placed in pans made of dried mud and called ‘ kalebi,’ and are fed with mulberry leaves chopped small; if the spring happens to be late, and the worms are hatched before the mulberry is in leaf, lettuce leaves are substituted, but the worms cannot thrive long on this food. Two boxes of 25 grammes of grain fill 15 to 20 kalebi. The worms live for about forty days, during which period they become torpid or go to sleep four times ; each sleep lasts about two days, and the interval between is from 7 to 10 days. When the insects awake from their torpor they are removed from the pans in which they have been kept, and are placed in (the ‘ tilimbar.’ From this period they are fed with mulberry leaves, whole branches being placed on the bed on which the worm is reared ; their voracity is extraordinary, and after each sleep they become more and more ravenous. The “ tilimbar ” is an oblong shed formed of trunks of trees stripped of their branches, and driven into the earth. The posts support a roof composed of the branches of trees thatched with rice straw ; the eaves project several feet from the walls, as a protection against the sun and rain, 6 or 7 feet from the ground, round the shed, a scaffolding about 2 feet wide is erected, on which the proprietor walks to feed the insects ; and, at a little lower level, the whole centre is occupied by a platform which serves as the bed where they remain while they exist as worms. The scaffolding encircling the bed is called the bridge, from which a curtain of rice straw is suspended, joining the platform, to protect the silk-worms from wind. This, with a ladder to ascend the bridge, completes a ‘ tilimbar.’ The walls of the shed are composed of reeds, and have two openings, one of which serves as a door, and the other, on the opposite side, affords the means of ventilation. (2) If the weather happens to be cold, which, however is rarely the case, the place is heated artificially. (1) Holmes mentions that when he visited Gilan the women in general carried the bags in which the eggs are preserved, under their arms as the warmest part of the body. This is no longer the case. (2) Holmes from whom this description is practically textually quoted, with very slight modifications, mentions the ordinary dimensions of a tilimbar as about 20 feet long, 17 or 18 broad, and 13 high ; the bed being some 5 feet from the ground. Mr. A. F. Churchill in 1903 says those he saw generally measured 25 feet by 14 or 15 feet. As a matter of fact tilimbars vary and are measured by the “ alish,’’ i.e., the distance from the point of the elbow to the tip of the middle finger. There are 30, 20,15, and 10 “ alish ” tilimbars made to contain 5, 4, 3, 2 boxes of 30 grammes of grain respectively. Should too many worms have been put into a tilimbar, the tilimbar is immediately enlarged by removing the walls further back and taking in some of the space which is protected by the projecting eav§s. “ A harmless snake, the Coluber Aquations, has its abode in each tilimbar. It seldom seeks to leave the place, but ranges about it at large, most probably destroying the vermin which might injure the worms. In some districts, the proprietor regards this reptile with such reverence that if perchance he finds it300 On being removed to the tilimbar, the sil^ wOTm^^The^asant^lmwever 1 ■when^he^weSher'is^threaterdi^, tiffnaJly endeav- Z^o obtain'a^ood supply^of feaves which have not been exposed to the ram. Great cold and great warmth are both injurious to the worms. At the expiration of about 40 days worms become of a transparent toe, cease to eat, and exhibit a desire to climb the boughs to form their coons^ This is a season of universal jubilee to the peasantry of Gilan, d h t laUmirppaqes Tudeed thev have every reason to rejoice, as in tms aamp auu iiy cmXthfgathering of the y branches is no ordinary toil, and often occasions deadly ■£0Y0j’g &gt; R ’ llt .

In taking into account the tilimbars of various sizes I was informed that 12 mans shah was the average production of cocoons per tilimbar. Mulberry plantations meet the eye at every turn throughout Gilan. The tree is raised from seed in the following manner ; the fruit is allowed to hang on the branches till it falls of itself, when it is crushed into a pulp, and portions put into holes in the earth 4 inches deep. 1,000 saplings are sold for 1 to 11 krans (in January 1907 equals 41&lt;f. to The creation of a mulberry plantation costs- 50 tumans (in January 1907— £9-10-6) by jarib (11- acre) but should the jungle have tp be cleared the cost is 80 tumans (January 1907—£15-4-9) by contract. Should the proprietor be the owner of a populous village the expense is much less. The ground is ploughed by Khalkhal labourers at 15 tumans (January 1907—£2-17-11) per jarib (11 acre). The fences to prevent cattle from straying into the plantation have to be erected by the villagers. A gardener is engaged who receives an advance of 10 kutis (lbs 650) of rice, value 15 tumans (January 1907—£2-17-11). He plants the saplings and sows garden crops the produce of which he shares equally with the proprietor who deducts from the former’s portion the value of the rice which was advanced. The second year the plantation is left to take care of itself. The third year it supplies enough leaves per jarib (II acre) for a 30 “ alish ” tilimbar, and the fourth and the following years the produce of one jarib (11 acre) of mulberry trees is sufficient for two thirty ‘ alish ’ tilimbars. The trees are usually 11 feet apart. Both the black and white mulberry are employed in the plantations, which are only allowed to grow a little above the ordinary height of a man, for the convenience of gathering the leaves ; the stems are stripped of their shoots, but a head is encouraged. The closeness of the trees and the shade which one affords the other render the leaves very tender. The trees are carefully pruned every spring, the shoots of the year alone affording the nutriment on which the worms thrive well; the leaves of the old branches are hard and indigestible, and the inequalities wound the insects. 1 The plantations which are irrigated by river water are said to be superior to those irrigated from reservoirs. The price of the former (Rasht and Lahijan districts) is about 300 tumans per jarib (in January 1907 about £57 per 11 acre), that of the latter (districts of Shaft and Fumen) is only 150 tumans (in January 1907 about £28 per 11 acre). In 1866 the mulberry plantations were said to extend over 17,713 acres of land. At present, according to the data given in the preceding page, it is esti mated that they extend over 25,000 jarib, say 37,500 acres.” 1 The younger the trees are the more prized is the leaf as food for the silk worm, and old trees are usually cut down to make room for new plantations. According to local climatic conditions mulberry tree plantations are renewed every ten or twenty years.302 E.—Tables showing Supplies and Transport available at various centres.

Barley, Lucerne and Bhusa are good. Hay is poor. Rice is scarce but can be fetched as required from the Caspian provinces. 1 i.e., about 400 krans (£10 to £15 according to rate of exchange) per ton.In the Caspian province towns of Rasht, Enzali in Gildn, and Bdrfarush in Mdzandardn. The supply of Wood, Charcoal, Rice and Fish is unlimited. Wheat and Barley are imported from hill districts and are only obtainable in towns or the larger villages. Barley bhitsa is scarce and rice straw is substituted for it. Local animals are rice fed. Supplies are more plentiful and more easily fetched to Mazandaran than to Gilan owing to the greater width of the wheat, barley and flock producing hill districts to the South of the Mazandaran plain. In country districts. The Persian peasantry generally are well fed and their standard of living is much higher than in India. Their stock of foodstuffs, however, except in the more productive districts (see page 282) is as a rule little surplus to their own needs, and while a small party of travellers can always obtain plenty of good and varied food, the provision of supplies for troops is rather difficult at short notice. The figures given by Colonel Stevenson for supplies obtainable at one month’s notice along the j Hamadan- Kazvm-Enzali road are an indication of the quantity obtainable on the Persian Plateau. For remarks about supplies in the Elburz and Caspian Provinces see Chapter 10, pages 424-426. Prices of Supplies. —Prices of food stuffs in Persia have been rising for several years and their increase has been accentuated since 1914 owing to the presence of foreign armies in the country, and culminated in the famine year of 1917-18, when the price of wheat in some'places, e.g., at Sultanabad (’Iraq), exceeded 250 tumans per kharvar (650 lbs). Since 1917, although the area of cultivation is smaller than in pre-war years owing to reduc tion in the population, diminution of the ploughing oxen by rinderpest, and other causes the harvests have been good and prices falling. In the autumn of 1918 the Supply officer at Kazvin purchased wheat and barley at 70 and 50 tumans per kharvar respectively until the grain was requisitioned at 45 and 35 tumans. Prices continued to fall through 1919 and in the autumn of 1920 wheat averaged 18 and barley 10 tumans per kharvar. The cost of living is, however, still extremely high and‘in excess of other countries. Prices of the principal commodities at the chief centres in this area are given on the next page. Prices of Supplies.307 ‘be SSH 2 S'' 2c ‘-I W,H 0*1 *&lt;k ^2. rC Q ^©0 -013^0 iS^gSS 'gp«5 diri; I- 2 0 M 2 S a j&amp;'sSjf J 5 «' = 'S''3 l i2 ir/^| Barfarush rates are lower than Enzall owing to lack of de mand due to stagnation of trade and absence of any British garrison and also to the great fertility and productiveness of Mazandaran. Rates for Tehran and Barfarush are current bazaar prices. Elsewhere they are those of British military contracts which in order to secure certain delivery of large amounts are for some articles slightly in excess of the bazaar rates. The great differences in the prices of the staple articles of rice, wheat and barley in different localities are due to the cost of transport. Labour. Rates for unskilled labour have risen by 1 100 per cent, to 200 per cent, of recent years, and in 1920 varied from 2 to 3 krans per day in the Caspian provinces and 3 to 5 krans on the plateau. Natives of the former, however, are such lazy and had workers that actually they prove the more expensive. In the winter months the majority of the rural population are unemployed and labour is very plentiful. It is scarcer during the autumn ploughing and sowing season and very scarce indeed, especially in the Elburz, in the harvesting and grass cutting season from May to August. Skilled labour is bad and expensive at all times and places. Carpenters are paid 8 to 12 krans per day, masons about 10, smiths and fitters 12 to 15. 1 Largely owing to the increase in price of wheat and harley (see above) and decrease of population. 8 e.g., along the main Kazvln-Itasht road the C. Pi. E. Eorperforce estimated, he could obtain up to 500 men at any spot required.309 Persia depends entirely on animal transport and local General transport is consequently good, plentiful and reliable. Carts and mules are the quickest means of transport. Camels march at night to enable them to feed by day and are slower and inclined to wander and graze. Transport,. excepting camels, which go out into the plains to shed their winter coats and graze during April, May and June until the end of the rutting season, can always be found in the main towns. Camel transport is always on the move and attracted to and employed in different areas at different seasons, wheeled transport also fluctuates but to a less extent, so, apart from lack of statistics, estimates of numbers available are im possible. Transport however can always be attracted where required by the prospect of good pay and fair treatment, through the agency of contractors or of brokers (dallal) and despatch of reliable advertising agents into the country districts. Owners of transport have a wholesome dislike and distrust of Persian officialdom, and Persian soldiers are the worst possible agents for collection of transport, as, apart from their unpopularity, their practice of requisitioning of transport (malgiri) is to seize animals, and then release them on receipt of a present (pishkash) from the owner. In normal times the principal centres on which transport converges are :— (а) Camels }&gt;Tehran. (See also p. 114.) (б) Carts. J — No. of carts. Ro. of camels.

Carts can only be used along a few main routes, see Chapter 3 0, pp. 415-6, 420, and elsewhere pack animals are the sole means of transport. The type of transport employed in different localities is indicated in the table on page 308.V. 310 Total number of camels converging on Tehran is estimated at about 10,000, 2,000 to 3,000 from Isfahan. 1,000 from Yaramin. 2,000 from Saveh. 4,000 from Azarbaijan and Khamseh.

Baghdadi] • • • 329 The great and powerful tribes of Persia are located in Azar- General, baljan, Kurdistan, Luristan, Bakbtiarx land and Pars, at a distance from Tehran, where the Central Government, unless directed by a strong ruler, has been unable to exercise authority over 1 them. In this area of North-West Persia, on the contrary, owing to its proximity to the capital, tribal chiefs have been more amenable to control and influenced by contact with town life. Moreover the tribes are not indigenous to it, but, with the excep tion of some of the Turki tribes in Kharagan and Saveh, have been transplanted into it comparatively recently by Shahs of Persia, especially Shah Abbas, Nadir Shah and Agha Muham mad Khan Kajar, from their homes in Azarbaijan, Kurdistan or Luristan to form a defence against invaders or overawe tur bulent districts, or as a punishment to weaken a rebellious or overpowerful tribe by removal of a part of it to new surround ings, where it could be readily controlled. For defence against the Turkomans several tribes were settled in Astarabad and the east of Mazandaran by Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar at the end of the 18th century. The Shahsavans (he. Shah loving) found in Azarbaijan and scattered through Khamseh and Kharagan to Saveh, are a combination of Azarbaijan Turki tribes united by Shah Abbas in the first quarter of the 17th century against rebellious Kizil Bash tribes residing in those regions. Similarly the Khwajahvand Kurdi 1 Their irregular cavalry used to constitute the strength of the Persian Army and the tribes were chiefly concerned in the dynastic wars of the 18th century The only instance of a tribe playing an Important part in recent Persian history is the Bakhtian advance to Tehran in 1909 and the deposition of Muhammad AH Shah. Prom 1909 to 1911 the constitutional Government was dependant on their support, but after the final defeat of Muhammad All in 1911 they withdrew to Bakhtiari land. As the result of the weakening of the Central Government since the revolution the big tribes, like the Shahsavans have got quite out of hand.tribe in Kujiir, P 8 i and Kalardasht, in the west of Mazandaran, were sent primarily to over-awe the original inhabitants. Turki, Kurd! and Lakk tribes were transplanted by Nadir Shah to the Kasvin province within easy reach of Tehran probably in order to break their power in their own country. The tribes were assigned the role of furnishing military con tingents of “ sarbaz ” (foot soldiers) and “sowars” for the “fauj” (regiment) of the district, which was recruited on a local territorial system, and in return land was allotted to them free and they were exempted from paying the ordinary “ maliat ” (land-tax) to the State. Their profession was soldiering, they were migratory between “ yailaq ” and “qishlaq” and few tribesmen were engaged in agriculture, which was left to the original inhabitants (“ra’ayat,” “ tat,” or “ gil ”) who provided the pay of the soldiers. Frori? the commencement of the reign of Nasir-ud-Dln Shah through the latte'r part of the 19th century Russia became too powerful for the Persian Army any longer to offer armed opposi tion to her advance along the Northern frontiers of Persia, while in the south, after the lesson of 1856-7, the Shah had learned not to provoke Great Britain by further aggression on Afghanis tan. Peace consequently reigned on the frontiers while inter-, nally the country was no longer, as in the 18th century, dis turbed by civil wars, so that few calls were made on the Persian Army. The decline was accelerated in the reign of Muzaffar-ud- I)In Shah, until, since the revolution, the old regular army has entirely passed away. As a result of this decay of the army these tribes ceased to be engaged in military pursuits and, severed from their own country, they have for the most part lost their tribal instincts and organization. The majority are no longer migratory between ‘ summer ’ and ‘ winter ’ quarters and have settled down to agriculture, in several cases inter married with their neighbours and become assimilated to them, especially in Mazandaran, where the change of climate caused a rapid decrease in their numbers and the tribesmen are now for the most part indistinguishable from the Mazandaranis in their physique and unhealthy appearance. In the Turk! districts there is no means of distinguishing the “II” from the “Ra’ayat” as both are Turki, and in other parts their original language, which they still employ among themselves, is often the only indication of the presence of an alien tribe. The land allotted to the tribe has in most cases been appro priated by the chiefs and is now held by them as their own property with right of sale and purchase. The feudal power of these hereditary officers (sahibmansab) or heads (sarkardch) of tribes is perhaps even more excessive than in the case of otherlandowners (arbab) but they have no armed 1 following except in the more turbulent Turk! districts of Khamseh and Khal- khal and Kharagan, where every local khan, whether tribal or non-tribal, maintains ‘ sowars ’ and ‘ tufangchis.’ Most of these Khans, however, are not united with each other by any tribal organization and are individual territorial magnates. The conspicuous figures among them are the Amir Afshar and Amir Ashayir. The Amir Afshar is a self-made man who has acquired power by his own personality and not from the small branch of the Afshar tribe settled in Khamseh. The Amir Ashayir in Khalkhal is chief of the Shatranlu, the only Azarbaijantribeof consequence included in this area, and is connected with the chiefs of the vigorous Fuladlu Shahsa- vans, who live between Khalkhal and Ardabil. Most of these tribes therefore are now only of ethnological interest, and have ceased to be of military importance. Brief details of most of them are given below, province by province, the Shatranlu of Khalkhal, and Inanlu and Baghdadi Shahsavans of Kharagan, Kazvin and Saveh being the most important. Tribes of Mazandaran. From East to West— 1. Abdul Malikx. 2. Kurd-u-Turk. 3. Khwajahvand. These tribes are all sedentary and have become more or less assimilated to the Mazandaranis, and, while retaining their original dialects among themselves, all speak Mazandaran! as well. The Abdul Maliki and Kurd-u-Turk have lost their physique owing to the unhealthy climate of the Mazandaran plain. The Khwajahvand live in the hills and are more virile, but also eat much rice and fall sick if transferred to the plateau climate and diet. The difficult nature of their country, and their local knowledge of tracks through swamps and thickets would enable the Abdul Maliki and Kurd-u-Turk to maintain a guerilla warfare against strangers with very little risk to themselves. Rifles were plentiful in Mazandaran until 1919, when Cossacks and Gendarmerie collected all they could find. 1 Any arms they may possess are contraband and concealed'v 314 1. Abdul Maliki (Turk!).

By origin they are a Qashqai tribe settled by Agha’Muham mad Khan in Shahriyar, near Tehran, about 1790, moved in the following year to Nur and Kujur, and to their present habitat to oppose Turkoman raiders about 1850. According to their tradition they then numbered 4,000 families, and have been diminished to about 600 by the Mazandaran climate. They do not intermarry with the Mazandaranis. They grow rice, cotton and a little wheat and barley and are estimated to possess about 8,000 head of cattle and ponies. Their chief Hujabr-ud- Dauleh has considerable influence, was unfriendly to the Russians, who supported a rival relation against him, and the whole tribe are opposed to Sardar Jalil who has diverted the water of the Nikah to his own property and so lessened their rice cultivation. In 1918-19 Hujabr-ud-Dauleh with 100 sowars took the side of Amir Mu’aiyid against the Sardar.Chief among them are Isma’il Khan, Sartip, of Isfandin and rtimad-i-Nizam, Hasan Khan, of Larim (see Chapter IX No. 47) but none possess much influence. Habitat—They are distributed between Ashraf and Larim North of Sari, and mixed up with Mazandarani villages. The most Easterly are the Afghans at Karatappeh, between Ashraf and Zarghamarz (see Abdul Maliki) near the Gulf of Astarabad, intermediate are the Turk around Nikah, and most Westerly the Kurd in twenty villages North of Sari. No. of houses .—About 2,000. Quota formerly furnished .—Sowars 400. To Mdzandardn Army .—Foot 1,600. These sections are of mixed origin and settled together by Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar to oppose Turkoman raiders, the Kurds from Sauj Bulagh Mukri of Azarbaijan, the Turks from Khorasan and Yaramin, and the Afghans via Khorasan. The Afghans are ‘‘ Sunni.” They are chiefly engaged in cotton and rice cultivation, and own a fair number of cattle and ponies but less than the Abdul Maliki. Little cohesion exists between these different sections. Isma’il Khan Sartip with 25 men joined Sardar Jalil in 1918-19 but the rest of the Kurd-u-Turk leaders, especially the Afghans, were on the side of Amir Mu’aiyid owing to Sardar Jalil’s diversion of the water of the Nikah and Tejen.

The following had come to Tehran by November:— From Kalardasht 125 Sowars under Intizam-us-Sultan. „ Pul 60 Sowars under Pir QuH Khan Sartip. ,, Kujur. 70 Sowars under Muhammad Khan, son of Shuja’-i-Nizam. This tribe was originally brought from Garrus and Kurdis tan by Nadir Shah. A part returned to their native country at the end of the reign of Karim Khan Zand, and were brought back by Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar, to keep down the turbulent inhabitants of these districts. Subsequently the Khwajahvand sowars ” were usually sent for duty at Astarabad against the Turkomans. 1 See Chapter X, para, (c) Elbury routes, Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6.318 The Khwajahvand are on bad terms with Sipah Sa'ar (see Chapter IX, No. 31ct) on account of his land grabbing pro pensities, and when he turned “ Revolutionary ” leader, in 1909, they were “ Royalist,” and a party of Khwajahvand sowars were in Tehran in the Shah’s camp until the capture of the city. Their ‘ sowars ’ were consequently disbanded and the “ Mallat” paid by them for their land to the “Gil,” the original proprietors, was hnoreased. In 1911 some of them joined Muhammad AH Shah at Astarabad. From 1916 to 1919 the Pul and Kujur sections joined Salar Fatih Kujuri, Mirza All Khan (see Chapter IX, No. 61) and accompanied him on his forays' into Tunakabun and looted Sipah Salar’s properties at Khurramabad and else where. The Kalardasht section was divided and changed sides, and in revenge the Kujuris did some looting in Kalardasht in 1918. Yazdan Quli Khan, father of the present Intizam-us-Sultan, and Sobhan Quli Khan, father of the present Intizam-i-Lashkar, were powerful chiefs in the reign of Nasir-ud-Din Shah but no paramount chief succeeded them, and internal cohesion between the different sections has been loose. The Kalardasht and Pul chiefs are interrelated, but weak, and bear some ill-feeling towards the Kujur section, which is at present the most vigorous, as the brothers, who have made themselves its leaders, are men of energy and personality. Many of this tribe are of the Ah Ilahi sect (see Chapter IV, para. (d)),_ pages 187-188). The “ II ” are settled in villages with the “ Gil ” in the pro portion of about 2 to 1, and “II” and Gil ” intermarry. The friction, which exists between them, concerning the tenure of the land, is not serious. The district is one of the most productive in the Elburz and the inhabitants possess considerable stock of sheep and cattle, and also raise large crops of wheat and barley and millet, which supply all the surrounding country. Tribes of Gllan. The only tribes in Gilan are : 4. Amarlu. 5. Talish. The ‘ Jangalls ’ are in no way tribal. 1 1 From to £ of the seed sown, i.e., from about to of the harvest.

They also occupy a few of the Villages North of the Chakarud, adjacent to Dailiman, e.g., DIarjan, Golak. They are semi-nomadic between “qishlaq” villages in side valleys North of Shahrud and the small yailaq ” village of Damash and black tent camps on the ridge, dividing the Shahrud from Siyahrud and Chakarud streams. . « No. of Houses. —About 1,600. Former Military Quota .—70. Language .—Kirmanji (Kurdi) the tribal dialect and Persian and Gilaki. The tribe was brought from Kurdistan in the early 18th cen tury by Nadir Shah, who also settled a part of it at Nishapur in Khorasan. The branch in this area was formerly included among the “ tribes of Kazvin ” and furnished its contingent of ‘ sowars,’but is now a district of Gllan, with a nominal deputy Governor in Basht represented in the district by Salar Nusrat. The Amarlu tribe constitute about two-thirds of the population, and the “ ra’ayat ” one-third. The land belongs to the “ |1 ” but is cultivated by the “ra’ayat” who pay one-half to two- thirds of the produce to the “ II ” as rent. The “ II ” are pastoral and own large flocks of sheep and some cattle. They are peaceful and no arms are in evidence, but they have not intermarried with the “ ra’ayat” and retain their original features and build. They are primitive and very dirty. 5. 1 Khamseh-i-Tavalish. The position of the five Talish districts has been mentioned under Gilan in the list of provinces in Chapter V, pp. 217-218. The population is partly of Turkish origin and tribal. Several of the ‘khavanin’ were ejected at the time of the Persian revolution of 1909. The people of Talish are partly 2 Sunni and partly 2 ShI’ah, but no enmity exists between the two sections. They are on bad terms with the Gilakis to the South, and con sequently kept aloof from the Jangali movement, which was popular with the Gilakis, and 3 Sardar Muqtadir led a rather half hearted Ittihad-i-Tavalish against them. The following is an extract from the 1919 yearly report of the Vice-Consul, Rasht. “ Table showing approximate population and armed men of each of the five “ buluks.” — Population, (for Mr. Rabino’s estimate of population, see Chapter V, p. 218).

Shatranlu. See table at end of chapter, pp. 336-339. 7. Quluqujanlu. Chief. —I’timad-i-Divan, Buyukh Khan, son of Darvisb Khan. Habitat. —Between Shatranlu and Yurtchi. No. of Houses. —About 150. A small tribe, an offshoot of Shatranlu. Tribes of Khamseh. These are all Turki and are of mixed origin but appear to have been brought from Ardabil and other parts of Azarbaijan and mingled with the Kizil Bash tribes, already in Khamseh, into the Shahsavan confederation. Lands in ‘ yailaq ’ and £ qisblaq ’ were allotted to them. The ‘ qishlaq ’ were cultivated by the ‘ ra’ayat ’ or “.tat ” and in summer the “ il ” migrated with their tents to the ‘ yailaq ’ pastures. They have now, however, become sedentary and agricultural, have intermarried with the “ ra’ayat ” and are tribal in little more than name. A few minor tribes, e.g., Dilaqada, Karaborglu, Rashvand, live in Tarum, but the principal tribes of Khamseh were the Duvairan and Afshar, called Afshar Duvairan to distinguish it from the Aishars of Sa’in Kal’ah and of Kharagan. 8. Duvairan. No. of sections. —15. Chiefs — (а) Sardar Asad-ud-Dauleh, Zulfiqarj Khan of Zinjan. (Chapter IX, No. 90.) ( б ) Bahadur-us-Sultan, Abul Qasim Khan, of Zinjan and Anguran. (Chapter IX, No. 91.) (c) Ata’ullah Khan, Sarhang at Ibrahimabad.(d) Rashid-ul-Mamalik, Musliin Khan at Qasimabad. (e) Sa’id Nizam, Safar AH Khan at Incheh. (/) Asad-i-Nizam, Sulaiman Khan at Girajak, etc. With the exception of (a) and ( 6 ) the above are very small local Khans. Sardar Asad-ud-Dauleh obtained the nominal chieftainship of Duvairan from the Persian Government in 1918 during the absence of Amir Afshar at Baghdad. The Amir has, however, bought several villages in the South of the area occupied by Duvairan, adjoining his own sphere, and possesses quite as much influence there as the Sardar. The family of Bahadur-us-Sultan are hereditary chiefs of Duvairan, but Bahadur-us-Sultan himself is a degenerate and though full of intrigue and of grievances has little influence. Habitat. —In the Kizil Uzun valley from Garrus above Yangi- kand, down to Qaplan Kuh bridge. No. of Houses. —Estimates vary from 1,500 to 3,000, and of number of villages from 120 to 300. Former Military Quota. —800 sowars. Duvairan were a strong Shahsavan tribe brought from Mughan and Ardabil by Path AH Shah, and settled in the fertile Kizil Uzun valley for their “Qishlaq ” with “ Yailaq ” in the highlands West of the valley bordering on the Afshar district of Azarbaijan. They maintained their numbers and unity under a powerful chief, Zain-ul-Abidm Khan, ancestor of Bahadur-us-Sultan, but after his death they lost their “ Yailaq ” which were appro priated and cultivated by the Afshar, and owing to oppression and bad times they have melted away to Ardabil and other parts of Azarbaijan, and only a remnant are left. They now have no leader to keep them together and no internal cohesion. 9. Afshat (Duvairan). Sections. —Jahanshahlu, Badirlu, Qurasanlu, Jumelu. Chief. —Amir Afshar, Jahan Shah Khan. Residence Karasf (see Chapter IX, No. 89). • Habitat. —Between Abharrud and Garrus. No. of houses.—About 1,000. ■ Former Miliary Quota. —500 sowars. The Afshar tribe, said to have moved from Azarbaijan simul taneously with the Duvairan, is divided into three independentsections, (a) the Afshar of Sa’in Kal’ah of Azarbaijan, ( 6 ) Afshar (Duvairan) of Kbamseh, (c) Afshar between Khamseh and Saveh, in Kharagan, the Afshar (Duvairan) branch being the weakest of the three. They are said originally to have numbered 5,000 families, used to migrate to yailaq ” above Sultanieh and further North-East in the hills of Tamm, West of the Kizil Uzun, but these “ yailaq ” have been appropriated as private property and the tribe are now sedentary and agricultural. They also own some camels, but fewer than formerly as the result of war and famine. The tribe form part of the tenantry of Amir Afshar, and the Amir has made their name familiar, and not the tribe the name of the Amir . They have no other leaders. Tribes of Kazvln. These tribes are grouped together under a head nominated by the Persian Government called “ Chief of the tribes of Kazvln.” In 1909 the post fell vacant and was conferred on the Chief of Gendarmerie of Kazvln, who regarded it as a sinecure. The combination is made up of seven tribes, viz.: — Chigini, Ghlasvand, Kakavand, Jalilavand, Bahtui, Rashvand and Ma- afl. Except the 6th and 7th, their “ qishlaq ” are situated in Tarum, i.e., the Shahrud and Kizil Uzun valleys, and their “ yailaq ” on the hills South-West of these valleys, i.e v roughly between the Kazvin-Manjil and Kazvin-Siyahdahan-Sultanlch roads. They used formerly to furnish 697 ‘ sowars,’ but these con tingents have lapsed for many years and in 1919, when the Gendarmerie attempted to raise 100 sowars, horses to mount them were not forthcoming. They are still mostly nomads and retain their tribal primitiveness, but have lost their tribal spirit and have all decreased in numbers. The chiefs of several of them live in Kazvin for the greater part of the year. Infor mation about these unimportant tribes is extremely vague and conflicting and difficult to corroborate. 10. Chigin!

They are on bad terms with each other owing to a property dispute. Ahmad Khan was imprisoned by Amir Afshar in 1919, and afterwards joined Gendarmerie in Kazvin for protec tion. Habitat. —The tribe is sedentary in villages near, and North- East of, Qurveh, the boundary of.Khamseh and Kazvin on Siyahdahan-Zinjan road. It also occupies a few “ qishlaq ” villages in Tarum. No. of houses. —About 350, formerly 800. Former Military Quota—IS sowars. The tribe might how raise about 300 foot. Language—-Ovigm&amp;l language is Lakk. They also speak Turki.326 Occupation .—Cultivation of wheat and barley, mostly un irrigated, and they own about 2,000 head of sheep and goats. A considerable proportion go to work in Gllan during the winter. History .—The parent tribe is near Kirmanshah. The num bers of the Kazvin branch of it have greatly diminished during recent years. 13. Rashvand. Chief .—Sardar Sa’id (see Chapter IX), landowner of Rudbar with a house at Razmian near Shahristan village on the North side of the Shahrud valley. He suffered from the depredations of Sa’id-ud-Dauleh (see Chapter IX) in 1918-19 and his house was burned by Bolsheviks in 1920. Habitat .—Mostly sedentary in Rudbar and Alamut, in Dehdushab, Hasanabad, Shahristan, Ma’dabad, Duralhaq, Chirish Darreh and other villages in Rudbar, and in Badasht, Duzdaksar, Mahmudabad, Shutur Khan, Madan, Haranak, Safiddar, Avaj in Alamut. No. of houses .—About 500 to 600 (150 in Alamut, remainder in Rudbar). Language .—Turki in Alamut, Kirmanji in Rudbar. History .—The tribe is said to have migrated from'Balkh and Bukhara at the end of the 17th century. Another branch of it is also settled in Khorasan. 14. Ma’afi. Chief. —Muzaffar-i-Lashkar, Ali Nazar Khan. Habitat .—Vicinity of Kazvln-Tehran road. No. of houses .—About 600. Tribes of Kharagan and Saveh. The Inanlu and Baghdadi nomad Shahsavan are the largest tribes in this area. Both are Turki and were introduced to the regions of Kharagan and Saveh at the end of the 18th century. The Inanlu are said to have been moved from the”Mughan plain by Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar. The Baghdadi are narrated to have migrated from Persia during the Safavi period and settled near Baghdad, whence they returned to Shiraz during the reign of Nadir Shah. During the reign of Karim Khan Zand they had no fixed abode. They joined Agha Muhammad Khan Kajar, who settled them in their present habitat.328 Humayun lived at Ismatabad in Zahrah about 6 farsakbs from Kazvin. Sardar Firuz was both unpopular and incompetent (he is now a confirmed drunkard) and has been Supplanted by Muhammad Hasan Khan, Amir Nusrat (Zafar Nizam), son. of the ‘ kadkhuda ’ of the Aqsaqlu sub-division of the Yangijak section. His history and present position are described in Chapter IX (No. 104). Other chiefs are Khalllullah Khan, Sarhang, of the Guqbar, who was nominated by the Government to supersede Sardar Firuz, but was not recognised by Amir Nusrat, and Haji Mu’in- ul-Mamalik (lives at Buin Khunan in Zahrah). 1 1 He has retired to Tehran-336 Shatranlu. (Tribes of Khalkha No. 6.) tTnti 1 the beginning of 20 th century, the . hatranlh were a a i?t ii J lth an . Ilbe g i appointed by the Deputy Governor Khalkhal, the nominee of the Governor General of Azarbai- jan fcunce 1903 however, they have become increasingly turbulent. In 1910 Yeprim and Sardar Bahadur Bakhtilri led an expedition against the Azarbaijan Shahsavans and arrested Salar-i-Firuz (Isfandiyar Khan) and Amir ’Ashayir of the Shatranlu together with Fuladlu chiefs, and sent them to Tehran, where they were detained for more than a year. Rashid- ul-Mamahk, the younger brother of the Shatranlu chiefs, con tinued his lawless activities unchecked in Khalkhal until their return. They are now (1920) rebel Chiefs, who rule Khalkhal y 7 errU o C 1 0nfiscated the Property of Haji Faraj Sarraf, Zafar-us-Sultane.h and other landowners. The tribe are numerically very inferior to the villagers, but the latter have no leaders and are not united, and few villages have been able to withstand them Kaghuzkunan, on the right bank of the Kizil Uzun has not been occupied by the Shatranlu, but it has been repeatedly pillaged by them, is ruined and semi-deserted and has suffm-ed probably even more severely than the other districts of Khalkhal. The population of Khalkhal is much °T? t0 the mortalit y from f a ^ine and sickness in 191 7 -18 and to emigration to Gilan, Khamseh and elsewhere caused by the Shatranlu s depredations. This rise of the Shatranlu has been largely due to their connection with the warlike and restless Fuladlu Shahsavans between Khalkhal and Ardabil. ,, Azamat Khanum, the daughter of Ahmad Khan Ilbegi of the Shatranlu, was forcibly carried off from her home by Juruq Beg, chief of the Fuladlu, and after two years in captivity became his wife and acquired great influence, which she used to further the interests of her brethern of the Shatranlu. Ahmad Khan had 4 sons, Isfandiyar Khan, Amir ’Ashayir, Rashid-ul- Mamahk and Tapuncheh Khan and 3 cousins, Sa’adat Quli Khan, Shukur Khan and Faizullah Khan? all brothers. Ahmad Khan s death was followed by family quarrels about succession to the position of Ilbegi. It was obtained by Nasir Khan, son ot Sa adat Quli Khan, but he was murdered by Amir ’Ashayir, and the rivalry contmued between the sons of Ahmad Khan t L 1 °^ a i ly .

Isfandiyar Khan, Amir ’Ashayir and Rashid-ul-Mamalik became undisputed chiefs of Shatranlu. Azamat Khanum has subsequently played the role of mediator between these brothers, who have from time to time been divided by jealousies. Since the death in 1918 of Salar-i-Firuz (Isfandiyar Khan), the eldest but least influen tial of the trio, who was on bad terms with Amir -Ashayir, Amir Ashayir and Rashid-ul-Mamalik have been closely allied and their nephews Ghulam Husain Khan and Husain Quli Khan, sons of Isfandiyar Khan, have joined them. Azamat Khanum was bom before 1860, but the alliance between Fuladlu and Shatranlu will probably be maintained by her sons, Sauri Khan, Nauruz, Firuz and 2 others, by her first husband Juruq Beg, who was executed by Shuja’-ud-Dauleh, Governor General of Azarbaijan. Her second husband is ■Juruq’s brother Salar-i-Divan, Husain AH Khan to whom she bore one daughter. - The Fuladlu and consequently the Shatranlu are on bad terms with the Yurtchi Shahsavan tribe to the west.352 He is on bad terms with the Bakhtiaris and fled to Europe in Tthe autumn of 1911 when Samsam-us-Sultaneh Bakhtlari became Premier, and remained in exile until 1914. At the beginning of 1914 ’Ain-ud-Dauleh (No. 6), Minister of the Inte- srior in Ala-us-Sultaneh’s Cabinet, permitted him to return to Persia and in June he was made governor of Luristan, Burujird, •and Arabistan. On the outbreak of war German agents got hold of him, Mustaufl-ul-Mamalik (No. 3), then Premier, and other leading ‘Democrats’ were in constant correspondence with him, and Mustaufi’s circular telegram to all governors in November 1915 that the Shah was leaving Tehran, and that Persia was about to declare war on Russia and England, led him openly to throw in his Jot with the Germans and Turks. He assumed the title of Amir Jang and undertook to raise levies in Luristan, for which die received and pocketed large sums of money paid in advance. He collected a few hundred Lurs and started to march on Hamadan en route for Kazvin, but owing to the advance of Baratofi’s army he turned off to Kirmanshah and joined the Turks and the Persian Gendarmerie, who had left Tehran with the exodus of 15th November and retired via Saveh before the Russians. Nizam-us-Sultaneh advanced from Kirmanshah towards Hamadan against the Russians, was completely routed near Asadabad, fled back to re-join the Turks at Kirmanshah and remained with them in Persia, Baghdad, and other parts of Asia until the armistice. He has been sentenced to ten years exile from Persia and is now (November 1920) in Switzerland. Throughout the war he was essentially a Turkophil and was in constant disagreement with the Germanophil party headed by Sulaiman Mirza. He is active, energetic, and courageous, but inordinate love of money is his besetting sin. For his performances in 1915 he is said to have received £80,000. No. 2. MUKHBIR-US-SULTANEH. Mehdi Quli Khan. Born about 1860. He has spent several years in Europe, principally Germany, and speaks German, French, and a little English. He came to the fore as a Constitutionalist in 1907 and had a good record as Governor General of Azarbaijan in 1908 until dismissed by Muhammad Shah for his espousal of the Constitu- tionahsfc cause, and a second time after the abdication of the Shah from 1909 to 1911, when he was forced to resign owing tothe hostility of the Russians and left for Germany. He returned to Persia in 1912 and being anti-Russian and pro-English he was viewed with favour by the British Legation and in 1913 was appointed Governor of Ears, where after the outbreak of war he came forward as a pronounced Germanophil and aided Wasmuss and others until in 1915 he was summoned to Tehran, and became Minister of Justice in Mustaufl-ul-Mamalik’s Cabinet, an organizer of the Turko-German intrigues and of the exodus of the ‘ Muhajlrxn ’ to Qum. After the Russian revolu tion he became the leader of the Democrats and the most power ful man in Tehran. Witia the post of Minister of the Interior he was the most active ‘ enemy partisan ’ in Mustaufi-ul- Mamalik’s anti-British Cabinet in the beginning of 1918, egged on the Jangalis to oppose Dunsterforce and directed from Tehran the intrigues which were largely responsible for the disaffection of the South Persia Rifles in Ears. At this time he obtained the support of all the Tehran press except the ‘ Ra’ad,’ whose editor Saiyid Zia wrote ^ series of powerful articles disclosing the intentions of the Government until Mustaufi suppressed the publication of all newspapers except one official organ. After the fall of Mustaufi’s Cabinet in April 1918, which was largely caused by Saiyid Zia’s articles, he held no office until appointed Minister of Finance by Mushir-ud-Dauleh in July 1920 and afterwards sent as Governor General to Azarbai- jan. The previous Governor ’Ain-ud-Dauleh (No. 6) had been expelled by the Democrats who were threatening to cut off the province from the Tehran Government, but soon after his arrival at Tabriz, with the assistance of the Cossacks, he succeeded in re-establishing Government authority and Shaikh Muhammad Khlabani, the Democrat leader, was killed in an encounter with the Cossacks. He is learned and well read, fond of blowing his own trumpet, but is one of the few capable governors pro duced by Persia during recent years. He has a reputation for patriotism and honesty and unlike most governors has not become a rich man. He is suspicious of British motives but now seems inclined to be friendly. No. 3. MUSTAUFI-UL-MAMALIK. Hasan Khan. Born about 1860. His father was for a short while Sadr A’zam to Nasir-ud-DIn Shah and left him large estates, most of which he has sold. From 1900 to 1907 he was in Europe and on his return to Persia he joined the Constitutionalist movement. He heldsome Cabinet posts and was Premier from July 1910 to February 1912, when he was a nonentity but closely allied with the Democrats who made use of him, a second time in 1914, and a third time from August to December 1915, when anti-ally intrigue in Tehran and in the provinces was at its height, and the so-called “ neutrality,” which he professed himself and enjoined on provincial governors, permitted it to continue unchecked until the situation became so serious that the Russians were obliged to reinforce their army in Northern Persia. On the ad vance of Russian troops from Kazvin to protect allied nationals in Tehran, Mustaufi ordered the evacuation of Tehran by members of the Majlis and all the Government departments, telegraphed to the provinces that the Shah was leaving the capital and assigned Isfahan as a rendezvous. Owing to the Shah’s eleventh hour decision to remain in Tehran on the pro mise of the Russian Minister that the troops should not advance beyond Karaj, the exit of Muhajirin to Qum fell short of Mustauff# expectations, and, after their defeat at Saveh by 'the pursuing Russians, his Cabinet fell in December 1915, and was succeeded by the pro-British Farman Farma. Mustaufi remained out of office, but his intrigues brought about the fall of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh’s first cabinet in June 1917, and he was the principal member of ’Ala-us-Sultaneh’s cabinet, which then came into power. At that time the “ Committee of Punishment” started assassination of the friends of Great Britain, and the Jangalis and all anti-British organizations were encouraged. Mustaufi’s fourth Premiership from January to May 1918 was most antagonistic to British interests. Mukhblr-us- Sultaneh (No. 2) was his Minister of the Interior, and sent secret orders to provincial governors to be hostile to Great Britain, and a telegram of his to Fars was the cause of the trouble, which broke out between the South Persia Rifles and the Qashqais, and of subsequent mutinies against their British officers of disaffected elements, who had been embodied in the South Persia Rifles from the former gendarmerie of Shiraz. The defection of Cossacks at Rasht with their arms and equipment to the Jangalis was also engineered by these two Ministers, and they endeavoured to bring the Jangalis to Tehran. The fall of Mustaufi’s Cabinet was at length effected by the British Legation in January 1918, but his successor Samsam-us- Sultaneh only proved even more violently anti-British. Mustaufi was “forgiven ” by the Legation and in July 192(&gt; permitted to join Mushir-ud-Dauleh’s cabinet as Minister without portfolio, but the record of this cabinet is not calculated to' have enhanced his prestige with the British. He has a weak character and, like Mushir-ud-Dauleh, possesses a reputation for honesty and the confidence of the people that at any rate he will do nothing bad—a very negative quality and of little avail in the present state of Persia which' requires more heroic measures. He thinks more of hunting than trying to rule the State. No. 4. MUSTASHAR-UD-DAULEH, Mlrzd Sadlq Khan. Born about 1865. A native of Tabriz of comparatively humble origin. He was educated in Constantinople and speaks French. He was a representative of Tabriz in the first Majlis of 1907, a prominent Constitutionalist leader against Muhammad Ali Shah, and was imprisoned by him at Bagh-i-Shah for 6 months after the Royalist coup (Tkat and bombardment of the Majlis in June 1908. He became a member of the ‘ Moderate ’ party formed by tbe regent Nasr-ul-Mulk and in 1909-10 was president of the second Majlis. As a “Constitutionalist” he had been anti-Russian and pro-British, but he now became friendly with the Russians^ and was Minister of the Interior in the Cabinet formed by the pro-Russian Sipah Salar (No. 31a) in 1911, and owing to his friendly relations with the Russians he was one of Mr. Shuster s bitterest enemies. He and Sipah Salar were^ cognisant o Russian designs for the return of Muhammad Ali, the ex- Shah r to Persia and on account of their treason in concealing their information from the Majlis the Cabinet was dimissed, and they and others took ‘ bast ’ in the Russian Legation at Zargandeh. Mustashar-ud-Dauleh remained out of office until 1913 when he was Minister of Rosts and Telegraphs in ’Ala-us-Sultaneh’s Cabinet and used his influence to secure the grant of mining, and other concessions to the Russians. He lost popularity owing to his Russophil tendencies, was not elected member of the third Majlis, and to retrieve his position, at the outbreak of war turned his coat and became an open supporter of the Germans, and through Turko-German aid became Minister of the Interior in Mushir-ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet- Owing to his upbringng in Constantinople he was strongly Turkophil, was assisted by Asim Bey, the Turkish ambassador,. and became the principal opponent of Farman Farma (No. 10),356 the most prominent pro-British leader in Tehran. Owing to the inability of Mushir-ud-Dauleh, the Premier, to check his intrigues, the British Legation requested the Shah to change ■ the Cabinet, which was succeeded by ’Ain-ud-Dauleh. Mustashar-ud-Dauleh was dismissed from office but had acquired great influence. . As the ‘Moderates’ were anti-German he left them and joined the ‘Democrats ’ and continued to work might and main in the Turko-German interest. He was Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in Mustaufl-ul- Mamalik’s Cabinet, which succeeded ’Ain-ud-Dauleh in August 1915, and with Muhtashim-us-Sultaneh dominated that Cabinet, pushed forward Turko-German propaganda and spread reports of an impending alliance between Persia and Turkey and did his utmost to persuade the Shah to leave Tehran for Qum with the Muhajirin in November 1915. He himself started with them, but owing to the non-arrival of the Shah returned to Tehran. After the fall of this anti-Ally Cabinet in December he was out.of office for two and a half years until appointed Minister without portfolio in Samsam-us-Sultaneh’s violently anti-British Cabinet, in 1918. In 1919 on account of his intrigues against the Anglo-Persian convention he was banished by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh to Kashan. He was said to have drawn up an ultimatum and declaration of war against Russia for presentation to the Cabinet, which however was turned out of office in August 1918. He was mixed up with the “ Committee of Punishment ” but never brought to book. He is entirely unscrupulous, willing to join any party or espouse any cause to obtain a Cabinet post with a view to his personal advancement. No. 5. SAMSAM-US-SULTANEH, Najaf Qull Khd?i. Born about 1846. The eldest of the Bakhtiari Khans. He lived with the tribe until 1908 when he seized Isfahan, of which he was appointed Governor by the Constitutionalist Govern ment in 1909. He joined Sardar Asad as joint leader of the 1909 march of the Bakhtiaris to Tehran where they joined Sipah Salar and compelled Muhammad Ali Shah to abdicate. He took subsequently a prominent part in Tehran politics becoming Prime Minister in 1911. In 1913 he became the leader of the anti-British element «mong the Bakhtiaris due to the establishment, with the appro-;r, to eW lahtockf ileh. ice but is anti-Geffli: ill in Aug® Bated 4 and Tuft Tehran i He hin» ,1 the SM ly Cahinf years mt Huitanei'i iccount 6. i he rra* clarati® ■t, which He ^ as ^ party« hew t° ihaffi'S foofffW ist Gov®; .oftheW; lined Sf 357 val of Great Britain, of the Gendarmerie under Swedish officers in the Isfahan district of South Persia, bordering on Bakhtiari land, which they regarded as their own sphere and resented the presence of non-Bakhtiari armed forces in these regions. The hostility between Gendarmerie and Bakhtiaris, grew so strong that in 1914 fighting between them nearly broke out in Tehran, where, since their participation in the expulsion of Muhammad AH Shah in 1909, contingents of Bakhtiari sowars had always been stationed. During the early days of the war Samsam, while taking money from the British Legation, set to work on behalf of our enemies. He did not, like some of the younger Bakhtiari Khans, leave Tehran with the “ Muhajirin ” in November 1915 and of neces sity kept quiet until the Russian revolution and withdrawal of Russian troops from Persia, but after these events he seized his opportunity, by German aid was elected a Tehran deputy for the Majlis by the Democrats in 1918 and started an open and violent anti-British propaganda. Soon after in return for a present of 15,000 tumans the Shah appointed him Governor of Khorasan, but, owing to opposition aroused, the appointment was cancelled, and to avoid refund of the cash, the Shah made him Premier after the acquiescence of the British Legation had been obtained on Samsam’s undertaking to stop his anti-British activities—a promise, however, which he immediately broke and proceeded to select his Ministers from among the notable opponents of Great Britain. The hostility of the Cabinet increased with news of the great German attack on the French front, the advance of the Turks from Tabriz towards Zinjan, and of the Jangalls to Manjil. It declared all treaties made with Russia during the last 100 years abrogated, and cancelled the extra territorial rights, which subjects of European powers enjoy in Persia, on the basis of the treaty of Turkomanchai akin to the rights they have under the “ Capitulations ” in Turkey, e.g. exemption from taxes, and right of trial before their consular representatives. The situa tion was critical, until the arrival of British troops at Kazvln and the withdrawal of the Turks towards Tabriz enabled Sir C. Marling, the British Minister, to demand of the Shah the dismissal of the Cabinet. Samsam at first refused to relinquish office, but finally the Cabinet fell and Vusuq-ud-Dauleh came into power with British support on the 7th August 1918. He is a weak minded old man verging on his dotage, an obstinate, uneducated tribesman, unable to speak or write Persian properly.No. 6. ’AIN-UD-DAULEH, Sultan Abdul Majid Mirzd. Bom about 1847. He is a Kajar, grandson of Fath All Shah and son-in-law of Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. His only son he has disinherited. He held many provincial governorships under the old regime and in 1906 was created Atabak-i-A’zam. The popular agitation which marked the beginning of the Constitu tional movement in Persia was directed against him, and on 29th July 1906 he was dismissed from office and retired to Khorasan until 1908, when Muhammad Ali Shah sent him against the Revolutionaries in Tabriz. Sattar Khan and his confederates with the aid of Messrs. Moore, an English newspaper corre spondent, and Baskerville, an American missionary, defended the town against him until the siege was raised on the arrival of Russian troops. He was Minister of the Interior in 1910, 1913 and 1915, Prime Minister from April to June 1915, and for a short while in 1917. In 1919 he was sent as Governor General to Azarbai- jan, where he was flouted by the Democrats who eventually forced him to leave Tabriz. He is an old man and this episode has presumably ended his public career. He is an old fashioned grandee of theFarman Farma (No. 10) Sipah Salar (No. 31a) school, of fair capacity, very corrupt and full of intrigue. No. 7. AMIN-UL-MULK, Dr. Ismd’il Khan. See No. 69. No. 8.

Owing to their wealth and ability, this family is one of the most influential in Persia. Farman Farma has held many provincial governorships including Kirman, Azarbaijan, and Fars, and several Cabinet offices. During the summer and autumn of 1915 he worked very hard on behalf of Britain and Russia and was the active leader of their partisans against the Turkophil Democrats headed by Mustashar-ud-Dauleh. The fact that the Turks and Germans did not succeed in driving the allied representatives out of Tehran was largely due to his efforts. He was Premier from December 1915 to March 1916, and his Cabinet was very well disposed to Anglo-Russian joint interests. In return for this assistance he was created G.C.M.G. in July 1916. From 1916 to 1920 he has been Governor General of Fars, where he gave us effectual support during the difficulties connec ted with the South Persia Rifles in July 1918. He is now on his way to Tehran (November 1920).360 Farman Farma is ambitious, vain and very avaricious, but is energetic, extremely clever, and not devoid of personal cbarm. He is a ^provincial governor of the old scbool, weakens opposi tion by inciting different parties against each other, keeps bis province in order, and enriches himself. No. 11. HAJI MU IN-UT-TUJJAR of Bushire. A merchant with property and vested interests in South Persia who has had several disagreements with Messrs Lynch Brothers. He was a deputy in the first Majlis of 1907-8, where he worked to further his personal interests, and also took a prominent part in the abortive scheme to form a National Bank.

In 1919 on account of his intrigues against the Anglo-Persian convention he was banished by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh to Kashan.

He speaks some French, but rarely speaks the truth, and his promises, which he never carries out, have became a by-word in Tehran. He is conceited. No. 13. MUHTASHIM-US-SULTANEH, Mlrza Hasan Khan. Born about 1863. He was employed for many years in the Foreign Office and accompanied Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah as Foreign Office representative to Europe in 1905.

He was Minister of Justice in 1910, of Foreign Affairs 1911, of Finance 1912, of Finance 1914, of Foreign Affairs 1915 in the anti-British Cabinet of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik, when in concert with Mustashar-ud-Dauleh (No. 4) he became the chief antially instigator. So open was tie in his attitude that the British and Russian Legations had to show that they regarded him as an enemy. He took money, however, from them as well as from the Germans and even outdoes most Persian officials in corrup tion. His son Nasir-us-Sultaneh in the Foreign Office was head of the Neutral States Department and he also was hostile to us. Muhtashim was Minister of Finance in 1917 and appointed Governor General of Azarbaijan. He did not work for the Turks at Tabriz, but left when they advanced into the province. He was expelled to Kashan by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh in 1919 on the pretence of intriguing against him and the Convention. He is a man of poor personality. No. 14.

It is generally thought that he and Mustashar-ud- Dauleh (No. 4) were principally responsible for the steps taken to repudiate treaties. In 1920 he was appointed Persian Minis ter to Madrid. He is an ultra-Nationalist and advocate of “ Persia for the Persians,” and a very able young man. No. 15. MUMTAZ-UD-DAULEH. Son of Mukarram-us-Sultaneh, and has about 14 brothers and sisters. He started his career as a Foreign Office employe and was appointed Consul at Constantinople about 1900. He became Private Secretary and Interpreter to ’Ain-ud- Dauleh when Grand Vizir in 1903, and accompanied him on Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah’s European tour in 1905. He was elected President of the first Majlis in April 1908, and after the coup d’etat and bombardment of the Majlis by Muhammad Ali Shah on 23rd June 1908 he became a fugitive and took refuge in the French Legation.

He was sent by Vusuq to Paris to the peace Conference to be out of the way, and was then consistently ignored. In 1920 he was appointed Ambassador in Constan tinople, and from there sent on a special mission to Moscow to negotiate with the Soviet Government. He is weak and unreliable. Speaks French. No. 17. MUSHIR-UD-DAULEH, Hasan Khan, C.C.M.G. Born about 1870. Brother of Mu’taman-ul-Mulk.

He also translated from the Russian and French various laws and regulations, which were introduced into the Persian Consti tution, including the regulations for the Ministry of the Interior passed by the Majlis in September 1907, which were translated by him from the Russian. In 1907 he was sent as special Envoy to Saint Petersburg and London to announce the accession of Muhammad Ali Shah and was created G.C.M.G. by King Edward.

He was Prime Minister from March to April 1915, and from July to October 1920, when he resigned owing to his refusal to dismiss the Russian officers from the Persian Cossacks. Mushir-ud-Dauleh is well educated, well meaning and intel ligent, hut extremely timid and unpractical, and his up to date paper constitutions on European patterns for Persian depart ments have not proved a success. Like Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik (No. 3) he has gained considerable influence owing to his career as a Constitutionalist, and has a real reputation for integrity. His weakness and timidity as Premier in 1920 disgusted the British Legation, and the solution of the Persian question was no nearer after bis 4 months’ tenure of office. No. 18.

He was made Governor General of Luristan in 1919 and had a fair measure of success but the central Govern ment starved him of the. troops necessary to pacify the province and in 1920 he gave up the job in disgust. Has always been very friendly. No. 22. QUVVAM-US-STJLTANEH, Ahmad Khan. Younger brother of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh (No. 34). He was Minister of War, 1910, of Interior 1911, of Finance 1914, when he made a good deal of money.

Son of Agha Saiyid AH Agha, Yazdi, Mujtabid, who was a popular leader in 1908-9, but has now retired from politics.

In the spring of 1918 he wrote a series of powerful and brilliant articles in the “ Ra’ad,” disclosing the intrigues of Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik’s Cabinet. The Cabinet retaliated by suppressing all the newspapers of Tehran, but its downfall was largely due to these articles. In 1918-19 he was the trusted confidant of Vusuq-ud-Dauleh and in 1919 was sent by him to negotiate with the Azarbaijan Government at Baku. His mission however was not suc cessful. He is extremely clever, and when he has lived down the un popularity due to his connection with Vusuq-ud-Dauleh may have a big career. No. 24. SALAR LASHKAR, Abbas Mlrzd. Bom in 1890. Second son of Farman Farma. He was educated at Harrow and Sandhurst and speaks English fluently. He is son-in-law of the active pro-German Nizam-us-Sultaneh (No. 1), and in 1915 was his Chief of Staff when Nizam-us- Sultaneh was Governor General of the West under the aegis of the Turks and Germans, and was Governor of Hamadan until it was occupied by the Russians. On the arrival of the Russians at Kirmanshah a safe conduct to Tehran was obtained for him by his father, Farman Farma. It is doubtful whether he was really pro-Turk, but he found himself in the enemy’s camp and was constrained toj oin them. He was Governor of Kirmanshah 1918-19, but left under a cloud, and became Under Secretary for War and President of the Anglo-Persian Military Commission in 1919. He is not so clever as his brothers, but more rapacious. No. 25. SARIM-UD-DAULEH, Akbar Mlrzd. Born about 1885. Eighth and favourite son of the Zill-us- ‘Sultan, the eldest son of Nasir-ud-Din Shah but debarred from accession to the throne because his mother was not a Kajar princess. At his father’s instigation he killed his own mother. V. - t 366 in 1906. The Zill-us-Sultan left him practically all his property to the exclusion of other members of the family, but Sarim-ud* Dauleh made them considerable bequests. He was appointed Minister of Public Works and Commerce in Farman Farma’s (No. 10) Cabinet in 1915, of Foreign Affairs in Sipah Salar’s (No. 31a) Cabinet in 1916, Governor of Isfahan in 1917, Minister of Finance in Vusuq-ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet February 1919. He was second member of the triumvirate in Vusuq-ud- Dauleh’s Cabinet (i.e., Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, Sarim*ud-Dauleh, and Nusrat-ud-Dauleh), but resented the Premier’s dictatorial attitude and assumption of control over departments to the detriment of the Minister’s authority, and was expelled from the Cabinet in April 1920 for intriguing against him. He used the name of the Sipahdar (No. 31), but the latter had little part in the intrigue. He is now (November 1920) Governor of Kirmanshah and Hamadan. Sarim-ud-Dauleh and the sons of the Farman Farma (No. 10) are the prominent young politicians sprung from the Kajar family, and like them he is associated with the British. They are influential but distrusted by the people. He speaks English and French fluently, is extremely pleasant mannered, clever, and ambitious, and if he can succeed in living down the odium of matricide and be less rapacious he might have a big career.

In these operations he showed military capacity and courage. In 1918 he was Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in Mustaufi-ul-Mamalik’s Cabinet and afterwards went to Sultanabad as Governor of ’Iraq. In 1919 he was appointed Governor General of the province of Kirman. He is the most prominent member of the younger generation of Bakhtiari Khans, and is well educated and more enlightened than the last generation in general. He is very capable, though somewhat conceited, and has considerable influence over theelder khans. He is inclined to be friendly to us, albeit a little suspicious at times.

He is uncle of Sardar Muhi (No. 76) and IVlirza Karim Khan (No. 74). He began life as a villager, then entered the Customs as a small employe, married the widow of his uncle Akbar Khan Beglerbegi and so succeeded to part of his property, and finally made his fortune by farming the Customs of Enzali for several years before the establishment of the Belgian administration and acquired large estates in Gilan. In 1903 he was created K.C.M.G. for his services as “ Mlhman- dar ” to Lord Downe’s Mission to Tehran to confer the order of the garter on Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. In 1907 at Tehran he took a prominent part in the Reform movement and in June of that year was arrested by the Shah and expelled to Mazandaran, when the British Legation spoke on his behalf. He returned to Tehran in December 1908, and took refuge at the Russian Legation until July 1909. In 1910 he went to Europe. He has held various Cabinet posts: Justice 1915, Posts and Telegraphs 1916, Interior 1916, and of War from February 1919 until March, when he was compelled to resign on the assumption of his having intrigued against Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, the Prime Minister. The real instigator however was Sarim-ud-Dauleh (No. 25). He is friendly to foreigners; as a Gilan landowner he looked to the Russians for support, but was well disposed to the British. His estates have been confiscated by the Jangalis and Bolsheviks and he is now hard up (November 1920). On the resignation of the Cabinet of Mushir-ud-Dauleh in November 1920 on the question of the dismissal of Russian officers from the Persian Cossacks, he was appointed Premier and his first action was to order their dismissal. He is a pleasant man of the country gentleman type, talks no language except Persian and a few words of French. He has a reputation for integrity and is personally popular with the people. No. 31 f. SIP AH SALAR-I-A’ZAM, Vail Khan. _ Born about 1846. Former titles Nasr-us-Sultaneh, Sipahddr- i-A'zam. Received title of *Sipah Sdldr 1915. Has 3 sons, Amir Asad (No. 56), Sardar Iqtidar (No. 62), Sa’id-ud-Dauleh (No. 59), with the possible exception of the last and youngest, Sipah Salar is a title held by the Commander-in-Chief ex-officio.none of them are of any calibre, and a brother Sardar Kabir, a nonentity. He is head of a family which have been feudal lords of Tunakabun from the end of the 18th century, when Agha Muhammad Khan, Kajar, granted governorship and estates to Mehdi Khan Tunakabuni, the founder of the family. Their influence increased and during the life-time of Habibullah Khan, Sa id-ud-Dauleh, father of Sipah Salar, the districts of Kalaristaq and Kalardasht and subsequently of Kujur were grouped with the governorship of Tunakabun, which remained within this family. Habibullah Khan and more especially Sipah Salar acquired property in these districts. The Khwajahvand tribe and others resented this land grabbing. Disturbances started in 1914 and in 1918-19 the Kujuris under Salar Fatih (No. 61) Shuja’-i-Nizam and his brother (No. 63) twice reached Khurramabad in Tunakabun and looted Sipah Salar’s estates. The sons of Sipah Salar by their intrigues against each other and their father for the management of the estates fostered these troubles. Sipah Salar inherited practically the whole of his father’s property to the exclusion of his relatives. He is possessed with a mania for the acquisition of land and is considered the biggest landowner in Persia. In addition to his Tunakabun estates with parks at Khurramabad and Shahsavar, he owns property in Gilan, most of which has been confiscated by Jangalis and Bolsheviks, in Rudbar and in other parts of Kazvin province, which produce much grain, in Tehran, ’Iraq and elsewhere. Owing to losses sustained at the hands of Kujuris, Jangalis and Bolsheviks, and the slump in rice owing to impossibility of export to Russia, he is said to be short of cash. He commenced his career in military service and then held many offices including the governorship of Talish 1877-78, of Astarabad 1889, of Gilan from 1899 to *1903, of Ardabil in 1904, of Gilan in 1907, of Astarabad in 1907. In August 1908 he was sent by Muhammad Ali Shah to command the Royalist troops beseiging the Revolutionaries in Tabriz but fell into disagreement with ’Ain-ud-Dauleh (No. 6) and with the Shah and abandoned his command, appeared before Enzali in February 1909, when the revolutionaries killed the Governor, and chose him Governor in defiance of the Shah. In April 1909 he proceeded to Kazvin as nominal commander of the revolutionary army of which Yeprim the Armenian is generally supposed to have been the leading spirit, and entered * During this period he constructed the Rudisar-Lahijan-Rasht-Kasma road.370 Tehran simultaneously with the Bakhtiaris on 13th July 1909, when he dictated terms to Muhammad All Shah. After the deposition of Muhammad All he was appointed Prime Minister and held office for almost a year. He was reappointed Premier in March 1911, left Tehran in a fit of temper on June 15th 1911 for Rasht in consequence of a disagreement with the Majlis and Cabinet, but returned to Tehran in July 9th and remained in office until July 24th. By this period his relations with the Nationalists had become strained, he took no steps against the ex-Shah who was threaten- ing Tehran from Mazandaran and was roundly accused of treachery. He was Minister of War in 1915 and Prime Minister for the third time from March to August 1916, when the Russian troops under General Baratoff were in the country, and he did exactly as he was told. On 5th August 1916 he signed a note granting control of Persian finances to a British and Russian Commission and Anglo- Russian control of two forces, each of 11,000 men, for North and South Persia under Russian and British officers respectively. When the Turks occupied Hamadan in August 1916 he deemed it advisable to withdraw from public life and retired to Kazvin. In 1919 he was Governor General of Azarbaijan, where, until recalled to Tehran, he stirred up trouble against Vusuq-ud- Dauleh, the Prime Minister, with whom he was on bad terms. He is an impetuous, flighty, eccentric old grandee, at one time Constitutionalist and at another Reactionary, not lacking in vigour but quite irresponsible. He has the courage of his con victions but owing to his inconstancy of mind is not taken seriously. He is rapacious like the rest of his class. During his Premiership he robbed on a grand scale and for several years his estates have paid no taxes to the Government. His huge pro perty is in the provinces which were the centre of Russian in fluence, so it was to his interest to be pro-Russian. After the fall of Russia his enmity with Vusuq-ud-Dauleh tended to prevent his becoming pro-British, but after the Bolshevik inroad no other alternative was left to him. No. 32. SULAIMAN MIRZA. An obscure descendant of Path Ali Shah he attained pro minence as a Constitutionalist, and after the retirement of Taqizadeh to Europe in 1910 he succeeded him as official demo cratic leader in the 2nd Majlis, a position which he retained in the 3rd Majlis of 1914. He was pro-German and a ringleaderof the exodus of the ‘ Muhajirin ’ from Tehran to Qum in 1915 and went on to Baghdad. After the fall of Baghdad he returned to Persia, intrigued with German agents and tried to oppose the entry of the British into Persia, until on their advance to Kirinan- shah he fled to the Sinjabi tribe. His surrender was refused by the tribe, but after the successful operations undertaken against them by Kalhurs and Sardar Rashid he was eventually captured and exiled to India. His arrest on Persian soil aroused an outcry among anti-British elements, the Jangalis for instance declaring they would only give up Captain Noel, whom they had kidnapped at Enzali, in exchange for Sulaiman Mirza. He is now (December 1920) on his way back from Bombay to Persia. His elder brother Yahya Mirza died of wounds received at the bombardment of the Majlis by Muhammad All Shah. No. 33. TAQIZADEH. He came with the Tabriz Constitutionalists to Tehran where he became a member of the 1st and 2nd Majlis, and in the latter was official leader of the “ Democrats. He lost his popularity, however, owing to his dictatorial manner an aroused the opposition of the priesthood by his objection to their intruding into politics and subordinating the Constitution to religious law. In 1910 he was excommunicated by a “ fatvah ^ from Najaf and after the murder of Saiyid Abdulla, the Muj tabid who had played the prominent part at the inception of the revolu tion in Tehran, which was attributed to Taqlzadeh s ultra democrat and Nationalist party, he was obliged to leave- Persia. Since 1910 he has been living in Europe mostly m Berlin, where he edits the “ kaveh,” a paper printed m Persian with pronounced Radical—Nationalist but not Anglophobe views advocating the Europeanization of Persia. Taqlzadeh is a good orator and was one of the leading Con stitutionalists, but has now lost his influence. He is an Azalr, i.e. follower of Subh-i-Azal, the legitimate successor of the Bab, who was superseded by his half brother Baha’ullah, the founder of the BahaT religion. No. 34. VUSUQ-UD-DAULEH, Mirza Hasan Khan, G.C.B. Born about 1865. Son of the late Mu tamad-us-Sultaneh, an employe of the Tabriz revenue office, and brother of Quvvam- us-Sultaneh (No. 22) he is of comparatively obscure origin, but acquired a reputation as a Constitutionalist and was a deputy of the 1st Majlis in 1907. He was elected a deputy of the 2nd'■ 'w 372 Majlis in 1909, and in October 1909 he became Minister of Justice, his first ministerial post, was Minister of Finance in 1909, of Interior 1911, of Foreign Affairs 1911 and 1913, and went to Europe “ on leave ” in June 1913, Minister of Foreign Affairs 1914, of Finance 1915-16, and became Prime Minister from August 1916 to May 1917. He enjoyed the support of the British Legation, and in August 1918 was appointed Prime Minis ter after the summary dismissal of the anti-British Cabinet of Samsam-us-Sultaneh. Sir Percy Cox signed the Anglo-Persian Agreement with his Cabinet in August 1919 and he enjoyed British support and remained in office until June 1920 when he had a disagree ment with the Shah on bis return from Europe and resigned. He was created G.C.B. in 1919. He is now in England (October 1920). During his first year of office he was the strongest and most progressive Premier whom Persia has yet seen. During the last few months his health and resolution gave way; he became inaccessible and very unpopular and his retention in office caused much anti-British feeling. Since his fall from office popular feeling towards him has changed by reason of the incapacity and vacillation shown by the Cabinet of Mushir-ud-Dauleh (No. 17), as the people generally are beginning to realise that they did not know when they were well off. It may not be wrong to predict that the time is not far off when he will again be Prime Minister of Persia, and he has undoubtedly a brilliant career before him. He is a man of great ability and charm and speaks French. He has made a fortune during his official career. No. 35. ZAFAR-US-SULTANEH&gt; Azlzullah Mlrza. Born about 1855.

Until 1900 he was usually at the Court of the Valiahd in Tabriz or held appointments in Azarbaijan. During this period he accumulated large estates in Khalkhal which are now (1920) appropriated by Amir ’Ashayir and the other Shatranlu Chiefs. He was Governor of Hamadan 1900 to 1903, of Kirman 1903-6, of Tehran 1907, Minister of War 1907-8, Governor of Kirman- shah 1908, of Kurdistan 1908, of Astarabad 1911, whence he went to Mazandaran, of Ardabil 1916-7.

He is an intriguing ecclesiastic, owning property in Khcl which was looted by Kurds and Turks, and he opposes any Government which refuses to o-rant him an indemnity.

He was a prominent Constitutionalist leader in the early days of the movement before the Shah’s bombardment of the Majlis and coup d’etat of June 1908, but is now (1920) a very old man and has retired from politics. He is one of the most influential of Tehran Mujtahids. His son Mirza Sadiq, born about 1880, was Vice-President of the 2nd Majlis and at one time leader of the Itidali (Moderate) party. He went with the Muhajirln from Tehran to Qum in 1915, and to Constantinople, where he became very hostile to the Turks. He returned to Tehran with his former influence greatly diminished. He has been elected a deputy for the Majlis. He does not openly work against the British. No. 41. SAIYID HASAN MUDARRIS. t Born about 1860. He is of doubtful parentage but believed to be the son of a shepherd of Qumisheh near Isfahan. He was appointed a deputy of the 2nd Majlis of 1909-11. He is a great intriguer and adventurer, often believed insane, opposes every Government and is a focus for all malcontents. In 1918 he was one of the leaders of the popular agitation engineered against the anti-British Samsam-us-Sultaneh with the object of bringing in Vusuq-ud-Dauleh as Premier. On that occasion he took “ bast ” at Shah Abdul Azim, and was the last to leave the Sanctuary. He afterwards turned against Vusuq- ud-Dauleh for not keeping him “ au fait” with political events, and by trickery made great capital out of the Anglo-Persian Convention of which he is a vehement opponent. The following ruse accredited to him is at least illustrative of his methods. By pre-arrangement an agent brought a sealed letter and deli vered it to Mudarris ostentatiously before his audience, and, when interrogated, declared the letter was addressed to him from the British Legation. Mudarris thereupon replied in a loud voice that he would accept no letters from the British Legation, who must make any communication they desired withhim, by word of mouth. He assumes the asceticism and sanc tity of a “ darvish,” professing not to spend more than 6 tumans a month on his food, and his house is always thronged. He is a law unto himself, is quite out of control and a very mis chievous person. Other fairly prominent Mujtahidts are :— (cousins). Agha All Najamabadl. J Shaikh Abdul Nabl.

His grandfather Lutf All Beg, of a peasant family of the SurkherobiLt district of £avad Kuh, became a brigand in Savad Kuh until, to avoid capture, he fled to Tabriz where he entered the service of Nasir-ud-Din at that time Valiahd, and was afterwards promoted “jalodar.” On Nasir-ud-Din s accession to the throne Lutf Ali Beg died leaving two sons, Murad Beg in the Shah’s stable, and Ibrahim Khan in his coachhouse.^ Both were promoted, the former to superintendence of the ‘‘ brood mares ” the latter became head of his department and “ Mira- kh5r ” with the title of Shu’a-ul-Mulk. Shu’a-ul-Mulk left 4 sons, among them Isma’il Khan, Amir Mu’aiyid. He is an adventurous soldier of fortune, who entered the military school at Tehran and started his career as a Nail) of the “fauj ” of Savad Kuh, 300 of whom formed a bodyguard to the Shah in Tehran, with few possessions except his own sharp wits by which he rapidly obtained promotion until he became a. commander of the whole ‘ fauj ’ of Savad Kuh (1000 ‘ sarbaz ’ and 500 ‘sowars’), and was given the rank of Amir Tuman by Muzaffar-ud-Din Shah. He was in the entourage of the Shah and during the revolution of 1909 he started as a “ Royalist,” but has since been alternately “ Royalist ” and “ Constitutionalist ” according to his interest of the moment, and the leading figure in the troubles in Mazandaran since the revolution. His cleverness and personal popularity won’ him the support of the Savad Kuhis and he refused to give up the “ khaiiseh ”376 lands which were ‘ tuyul ’ for the ‘fauj ’ of Savad Kuh in accor dance with the decree of the 2nd Majlis in 1909 and gradually appropriated more ‘ khaliseh ’ in the adjacent districts of Shir- gah and Allabad. His initiative and self reliance have made him the most powerful of the potentates of Mazandaran, viz., Amir Mu’aiyid and Sardar Jalll (No. 44) and Amir Mukarram (No. 43), the big hereditary landowner of Western Mazandaran who has been a tool in his hands. Sardar Jalil, the wealthy landowner of Eastern Mazandaran, has twice (in 1911 and 1918) been provoked into armed opposition to him, but the Sardar is a capitalist profiteer and no soldier and his numerically superior following of oppressed peasantry or hirelings, mostly natives of the ‘ qishlaq, are no match in spirit or physique for the Savad Kuhis, the most virile of the Mazandaranis, who are loyal to Amir Mu’aiyid. The minor personalities of Savad Kuh are all connections of his, and give him their united support. ^ with the aid of Amir Mukarram he defeated Amir A’zam in Larljan at the head of a governmental force sent against them from Tehran. In 1911 he assisted the ex-Shah in his attempt to return to Tehran via Mazandaran, but not to the extent of making any sacrifices on his behalf, and obtained many rifles during the flight of Sardar Muhi’s governmental force after their defeat at Astarabad. In 191b he organized an Ittihad-i Tabaristan, set up a provisional Government by the chiefs of Mazandaran, and negotiated with Salar Fatih (No. 61) of Kujur and with the Jangalis. He quarrelled, however, with Sardar Jalil, who was loth to be mulcted and drawn into doubtful political ventures which might jeopardize his huge landed estates, and the chiefs of Mazandaran were divided into two armed camps. Amir Mu’aiyid collected about 500 men and controlled the West of Mazandaran as far East as Sari. In addition to the Savad- kuhis he was supported by Hujabr-ud-Dauleh (No. 45) with 100 sowars of the Abdul Maliki tribe and had the sympathy of the Kurd-u-Turk leaders with the exception of Isma’il Khan Isfan- dini (No. 46). With the other Mazandaran Chiefs he left the province in 1919 and went to Tehran, whence he was banished to Kirman- shah and the Government properties in Shirgah and Aliabad were _ taken away from him. Mushir-ud-Dauleh’s Cabinet permitted him to come from Kirmansbah to Tehran and he has recently (November 1920) quitted Tehran and gone to Savad Kuh without permission.377 IKuhina® ) and graii# listrictsof fc him the * Amir Mu’aiji Uo. 43), theh who has hs r landowner beenprovob is a capW erior foUowh .atives of tt for the Sari o are loyal : Sarad Ki ted support efeated M %l force s® 3 ex-Shah h ^ not to* d obtained vernmen* set up 3 iaraHi d with* 6 JaJil, ^ d politi cal estates, ani »4y o1 [#ian I* ie i and 0 His sons Saifullah Khan and Hujabr-us-Sultan raised a rebellion in Savad Kuh id the early summer of 1920.

He is personally very popular, but his sons have a bad reputation. He has usually been on bad terms with Sipah Salar (No. 31a). He concluded a £ treaty ’ with an Austrian officer in June 1918, who fell into British hands at Baku, and his banishment to Kirman- shah by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh and dislike of ordered government have doubtless confirmed his anti-British sentiments. No. 43. AMIR MUKARRAM, Mlrzd Muhammad Khan. Born about 1870. He has two sons I’zam-ud-Dauleh (Farajullah Khan) and Azim-ul-Mulk (Asadullah Khan). He is the son of Abbas Quli Khan Sardar and comes of an old Mazandaran family owning about 60 villages in Larijan and around Amok He is the hereditary chief of tne ‘ fauj ’ of Lari j an, which formerly numbered 800 ‘ sarbaz ’ and 200 4 sowars ’ and served at Astarabad, and the governorship of these districts until 1918 was held by himself or his eldest son, I’zam-ud-Dauleh. He has held no office outside Mazandaran except the governorship of Astarabad for 1 year. He was more or less independent of governors sent by the Persian Government to Mazandaran after the Persian revolu tion and was used on acdbunt of his family prestige by the active Amir Mu’aiyid (No. 42) as a figure head in the latter’s schemes in Mazandaran. He was allied with Amir Mu’aiyid against Amir A’zam’s governmental force from Tehran which was defeated in Larijan in September 1910, and in assisting the ex-Shah in his attempt to reach Tehran and recover the throne in July 1911. He afterwards continued to play the part of figure head for Amir Mu’aiyid, but took no active part in Mazandaran politics. In 1919 he was expelled with the other leaders to Tehran by Zahir-ud-Mulk, Governor of Mazandaran. Amir Mukarram is considered an aristocratic degenerate with no personality and incurred ignominy by taking refuge with the Russian Consular agent at Barfarush for protection against his creditors until himself arrested by the Russians for non-payment of a debt to the Russian Bank. He is extra vagant, luxorious, and weak. 2 B378 No. 44. SARDAR JALIL, Lutf All Khan, Kulbadl. Former title Sdldr Mukarram. Born about 1860. Son of Haji Murtaza Quli Khan Sultan. His eldest son Shuku-i-Mzam, aged about 20, is a nonentity. Sardar JaM is second of the big “ three ” in Mazandaran, viz. :—Amir Mu’aiyid (No. 42), Sardar Jalil and Amir Mukarram (No. 43). The two Amirs have always been allies and since the revolution have had control of the West of Mazandaran. Amir Mu’aiyid has twice, in 1911 and 1918, been the aggressor against, and come to blows with, Sardar Jalil who controls the East of the province as far West as Sari and is supported by Mas’ud-ul-Mulk, Salar Afkham and Sardar Rafi, the landowners of Hazar Jarib (upper Tejen area). Sardar Jalil is a self made man. He was a petty hereditary officer of the 100 ‘ sowars ’ of the Kulbad district, a few miles East of Ashraf, which before the revolution were usually stationed in Astarabad. He inherited a small property and married a cousin who became heiress to the villages of Kulbad by the convenient death of her brother soon after her marriage. He set to work to acquire land by the usual tricks of the Persian landowner, he., squeezing his peasantry, cutting off the- irriga tion water, and making things so unpleasant for smaller owners that they were obliged to part with their lands on his terms, and he is charged with putting out of the way persons incon venient to him. Authorship is attributed to Sardar Jalil of the system of “ Shahmirzadi,” by which the monopoly of a village shop was granted to a lessee, and the villagers were forbidden to sell their cotton, etc., to any body else and were obliged to buy from him their sugar tea, and other requirements. The shopkeeper consequently was master of the situation, bought cheap and sold dear and paid a high rent to the landlord for the monopoly. These shopkeepers were mostly natives of the district of Shah- mirzad near Samnan, hence the name. By such means Sardar Jalil gradually acquired very large estates, said to amount to 50 villages, between Kulbad and Sari, centred round his residence at Naranji Bagh by the bridge over the Nikah on the Ashraf-Sarl road, and is one of the weal thiest men in Northern Persia. Money making is his pursuit and while averse to paying taxes, he has no taste for politics and still less for soldiering. In 1911 he did not join the ex-Shah, who was welcomed to Mazandaran by Amir Mu’aiyid and Amir Mukarram, and fled to Tehran. Subsequently he joined the Ittihad-i-Tabari-379 KvlMSt stan and was appointed by it Governor of Mazandaran, but he appears to have been pushed into the Ittihad by the adven- ri - qjij, turous Amir Mu’aiyid and to have been a very lukewarm adhe* ' ' . rent of it.

He was unable to keep the Kujuris out of Khurramabad and retired to the ridge of Ghalleh Gardan, South of it, during their second foray in the spring of 1919. He disarmed some Jangalis who came from Gilan to Tuna kabun shortly after, but was suspected by the Persian Cossacks in pursuit of them of secretly ^intriguing with the Jangalis, whereupon he fled from Tunakabun and joined his father m Tabriz, P who made him Governor of Sarab. He formed a con spiracy to assassinate the Prime Minister Vusuq-ud-Dauleh and others, and on his return to Tehran was arrested and sent via Baghdad to Europe.with Sipah Salar, in the house of I gha Kamal, brother of Saiyid Abdulla, the prominent revolutionary Mujtahid killed in 1909 . After the fall of Sipah Salar’s Cabinet in August 1916 he con spired with Mirza Kuchik Khan (No. 75) and Ihsanullah Khan (No. 72), Salar Fatih undertaking to go and foster rebellion in Kujur, Kuchik Khan undertaking to do the same in Gilan, and they agreed subsequently to join forces. Salar Fatih returned with the other refugees to Kujur, expelled Sipah Salar’s agents at once from Kujur, and two months later from Pul. In the summer of 1916 when European children and women were preparing to evacuate Tehran before the Turkish advance from Hamadan, he invited them to go via Kujur. In 1918 and 1919 he was leader of the Kujurls in their forays into Tunakabun and although not a member of the “II” of Khwajahvand its leaders were guided by him as the more skil ful intriguer. In 1918 he went on from Khurramabad in Tunakabun to Kasma to confer with Mirza Kuchik Khan and the Jangall leaders. In the summer of 1919 he was threatened by a Cossack force from Tunakabun, but refused to come to Tehran until he received a guarantee of safety, ‘ tamlnameh,’ countersigned by the British Legation. He is still (November 1920) in Tehran and has been again reconciled with Sipah Salar, His rapacity was not limited to Sipah Salar’s property and he is hated by the people of the lowlands of Kalaristaq and of Tunakabun for the losses they sustained at the hands of the Kujuris under his leadership. His career is of interest as an illustration of how a peasant lad can rise to position and power, of the Persian attributes of intrigue and ingratitude, and as a type of the adventurer to whom the disorganization resulting from the revolution has afforded special facilities and impunity.

This act increased their hostility against him and they were the active leaders of the disturbances of the Mahal-i-Salas which culminated in the 2 raids of the Kujuris into Tunakabun in 1918 and 1919.

He was a farrash for many years in the house of Mukhblr-ud-Dauleh and other Tehran notables, and then became a collector of emm tragacanth m Kazvin and Gilan, until attracted by stories of profitable employment m the Jangal in 1918 he joined Haji Ahmad. In the spring of 1919 he was with Dr. Hashmat (see i hapter I history, Gilan section) at Lahijan and in charge of aparty of Kurds and Lurs. In 1920 he did not surrender with Haji Ahmad, but joined Kuchik Khan and went with him to Lahijan. During the ensuing Jangali debacle he kept together a small party and returned to lumen. His activity and energy during this low ebb of the fortunes of the Jangalis made him one of their most prominent leaders. In July 1920 with Ihsanullah Khan be joined the most violent section of the Bolsheviks, which quarrelled with Kuchik Khan and expelled his commissars from Rasht and in the Communist Government then established he became Commissar for War.

He was Turkophil and joined the Turko-German exodus from Tehran to Qum and afterwards went to Constantinople. He returned to Persia in 1920. In 1920 Starosselski had his house in Rasht pulled down in revenge for Sardar Muhi’s adhesion to the Bolsheviks. He is now (November 1920) in Tehran. No. 75. MIRZA KUCHIK KHAN. Leader of the Jangalls. He was born about 1878, near the village of Kasma in Gilan, studied at a religious school in Rasht and became an Akhund. During his humble days Sardar Muhi (No. 76) who is now his bitter enemy, was his patron. He took a small part in the revolution in 1908 but remained inconspicuous until 1915-16 when he started the anti-Russian Ittihad-i-Islam in the Jangal in the West of Gilan. At the outset he played the role of a benign Robinhood, and achieved local popularity by expelling or kidnapping oppressive' landowners and redressing the griev ances of the peasantry. Two Persian and two Russian ex peditions were sent against the band without any success and by general consent they became the de facto Government of Gilan, which had been burdened with a particularly rotten provincial administration. In 1916 he became an important factor in the politics of Persia, was friendly with the Russian Bolshevik Committee which was evacuating his former enemies, the Russian troops, from Persia, opposed the arrival of the British and ordered General Dunsterville’s party which reached Enzali in January 1918 to quit Gilan. He was only deterred from ambushing them on their way back to Kazvin owing390 to unceitainty about the attitude of Russian, troops along the road, and apprehension that they might rally to Dunsterville,, The Jangalls abandoned their positions at Manjil bridge and failed to hold the road against BicherakoJ’s column in June 1918. They attacked and were defeated by the British troops in Rasht in August 1918 and Kuchik Khan then made terms with us. The treaty was annulled in March 1919 owing to his insincerity towards and persistence in opposing the Persian Government he was unable to withstand the Persian Cossacks and became a fugitive. He profited by the misbehaviour of the Cossacks and maladministration of the Governor sent from Tehran to revive the Jangali movement in the autumn, spent the winter parleying with the Persian Government until May 1920, when he was rejoined by his old friends the Bolsheviks, appeared in his true colours and was escorted by them into Rasht in spite of the assurances of neutrality he had given a few days pre viously prior to the withdrawal of the British garrison. In July however he quarrelled with Khalu Qurban, Ihsanullah Khan and the Communist section and retired to the Jangal, where he has since remained sitting on the fence. In Novem ber a Bolshevik expedition went against him from Rasht, but without result. His secession from the Bolsheviks is probably only a temporary phase due to personal antipathies and jealousies, for instance with Sardar Muhi (No. 76) who has been playing a prominent part among them. So long as Kuchik Khan was only concerned with local Gilan affairs the province benefited by his activities, and he earned a reputation for qualities of leadership and integrity. Subsequently he seems to have over-reached himself, has acquired an evil reputation for duplicity and appeared as a turncoat and self seeking adventurer. His futile opposition to the Government involved Gilan in the miseries of civil war in 1919 followed by the catastrophe of the Bolshevik invasion in 1920.

In 1918 he was Governor of Kurdistan for a few months. In 1920 he joined the Bolsheviks soon after their entry into' Gilan, sided with the Communist element, and after their split with Kuchik Khan he became the leader of the Persian Revolutionary element. Kuchik Khan was for several years- his satellite, but they are now bitter enemies, and the expedi tions sent by the Bolsheviks against Kuchik Khan in November 1920 may possibly be attributed to this enmity.

Am ir ’Ashayir is the chief (Ilbegi) of the tribe of Shatranlu (Chapter VIII) and usually lives at Qivi and Mirisht, North of the Kizil Uzun. He has a house at Havistan in Garmarud near the Buzqush mountains about 25 miles Northf of Mianeh. His tribal connections are mentioned in Chapter* VIII. He served with a part of the “ fauj ” of Khalkhal in Muhammad All Shah’s bodyguard, after a period of rivalry with his rela tions obtained chieftainship of the Shatranlu, and then with the help of the tribe started to appropriate land and loot. In 1912 Sardar Bahadur Bakhtiari (son of Sardar Asad) and Yeprlm defeated the Shahsavan rebels between Sarab and Ardabil, and arrested Amir ’Ashayir and Isfandiyar Khan and took them to Tehran, where they were detained two years. On his release he returned to Khalkhal and renewed his lawless activities. For a short while he was appointed Governor of Gilan by the Jangalis, but quarrelled with them and returned to Khaikhal where he and his relatives have become powerful robber chiefs and have overrun the whole of Ivhalkhal North of the Kizil Uzun, and repeatedly pillaged the district of Kaghuz- kunan south of the river. Since his quarrel with the Jangalis lie has strengthened his former friendship with Sardar Muqtadir of Talish. Amir ’Ashayir’s sister, Azamat Khanuin is the wife of Husain Ali Khan, chief of the warlike Fuladlu Shahsavans between Khalkhal and Ardabil. She is a masterful lady with much influence and has secured the support of the Fuladlu for hei Shatranlu relations. Amir ’Ashayir, his brother and nephews maintain a permanent armed following of about 250 men but could muster some 1,000 or 1,200, exclusive of the Fuladlu who can muster about 500. Amir ’Ashayir became chief of the Shatranlu by Russian assistance, but afterwards became anti- Russian. He quarrelled, however, with the Turks and was friendly to Major Wagstaffe’s mission to Azarbaijan in 1918. He has a reputation for double dealing. No. 83. AMIR TUMAN, Muhammad Taql Khan. Born about 1865. Father-in-law of Salar Majid (No. 87), but on bad terms with him. Lives at Kajal (South of Kizil Uzun gorge near disused Pardalis bridge on Zinj an-Ardabil road). He inherited property from his father who commanded the “ fauj ’ of Khalkhal, and for 15 years served as ‘ sarhang ’ in 1 Pages 336-8.394 that ‘fauj ’ and afterwards for 16 years in the ‘qishlq khaneh' (bodyguard) at*Tehran until the revolution of 1906, when he returned to Khalkhal. He headed opposition to .Amir ’Ashayir’s depredations breached the bridge of Pardalis, and for some years kept bis raiders out of Kaghuzkunan, the district south of the Kizil Uzun. His villages suffered severely from the famine of 1918 and he is now in reduced circumstances. He is the most friendly and enlightened Khan in these parts and very bitter against Amir ’Ashayir and the other rebels. No. 84. GHULAM HUSAIN KHAN, Husain Quid Khan. Sons of Isfandiyar Khan, deceased, the elder brother of Am ir ’Ashayir.

No 89. AMIR AFSHAR, Jahdn Shah Khan. (See also history of Khamseh in Chapter I, p. 85-8.) He claims to have been bom about 1825 but 1845 is more Perso^ probable. Son of Hasan All Khan Afshar. Has one surviving son Sardar Fatih (All Asghar Khan) of no calibre and addicted to opium, son-in-law Muzaiyin-us-Sultan m Tehran with whom he is on bad terms. ; Amir Afshar lives at Karasf, 25 miles South West of Sul- tanieh, and 40 South of Zinjan, owns about 70 villages between Abhar and Garrus, i.e., in Southern Khamseh and surrounding districts and is the most powerful Khan in that province. His only rival is the Sardar Asad-ud-Dauleh (No. 90), the land- owner of Northern Khamseh, who however is no match for him. He is the chief of the branch of the Afshar tribe in Khamseh (see Chapter VIII), but does not control the Afshars of Sa m QaTeh or the Afshars further South in Kharagan. It is Amir Afshar who has made his branch of the Afshar tribe well- known and not vice, versa. Amir Afshar is said to have intrigued with the Turks in 1915 16 sot into trouble with the Russians and fled to Baghdad, where he was at the time of the British occupation. In March 1918 he returned to Zinjan under our auspices and was govern or for a year, but his performances fell short of his promises of assistance to General Dunsterville against the Turks. Since the defeat of the Turks he has professed friendship with us, but in 1919 was believed to be in secret correspondence with the Jangalis. He was summoned to Tehran by Vusuq-ud-Dauleh, with whom he was on bad terms, in the spring of 1920, but afterwards again became Governor of Khamseb, where his feudal power is so strong that the position of any governor is rendered impossible. The Tehran Government is too weak to enforce authority and the Amir’s influence is required to coerce the lawless Turk! population and to prevent an outbreak of anarchy as in Khalkhal.396 Amir Afshar claims to be able to muster 5,000 armed men, but an estimate of about 1,000 ‘ foot ’ and 600 ‘ sowars ’ is pro bably nearer the mark. As chief of the Afshar £ sowars ’ he polices the Kazvln-Tabriz road from Qurveh to Jamalabad. He is an uneducated self made man who has acquired his position by his own ability and personality at the expense of his neighbours. He robs Peter to pay Paul and has a reputation for generosity and also for vindictiveness. Despite his advanced age and opium eating, his faculties and strong will are unimpaired and he is a skilful intriguer with a predilec tion for benevolent neutrality until the time comes to back the winner. He is friendly with Amir ’Ashayir (No. 82). No. 90. SARDAR ASAD-UD-DAULEH, Husain Quli Khan. Born about 1875. Son of Zulfikar Khan Asad-ud-Dauleh, descendant of a Zulfikar Khan who rebelled against Karim Khan Zand. The present Sardar has 6 sons and has spent most of his life at Zinjan. He has inherited about 100 villages in Anguran, Zinjan Rud, Abchehrud, and Tarum, i.e., the Kizil Uzun and Northern area of Khamseh, and Tarum is the centre of his influence. He was Governor of Zinjan during Amir Afshar’s absence at Baghdad and was made chief of the Du- \ahan tribe (see Chapter VIII, p. 322) by the Persian Govern ment, but otherwise has taken little part in politics and is eclipsed by the Amir. Rivalry between their partisans is a disturbing element in Zinjan where Naib Sadr and Haji Vazir, Mushir-ul-Mamalik, two leaders of the Social Democrat party are his most important friends. The majority of landed proprietors in Khamseh are friendly with him “and form an anti-Afshar Combination. He can raise about 300 armed men. The Sardar is a big man, stands over 6 feet, and is broad in proportion. He is well mannered and considered good-natured and agreeable, but tight fisted, of weak character and too much in the hands of his subordinates, some of whom, especially Mu’in Humayun his vakil (No. 97), have a bad reputation.'

The Caspian is divided by a line of submarine hills between Baku and Krasnovodsk into two basins, the Southern being the deeper with a maximum depth of 517 fathoms near the South West corner where the Elburz approach close to the sea. It is shallowest along the desert on the East. Great variations of climate are experienced. In the Northern basin the winter is arctic, and North of a line drawn from Chechan island to Alexandrovsk, i.e., the Northern quarter, the sea is frozen from the latter part of December to mid-April. Thin ice reaches Petrovsk and Krasnovodsk and snow falls at Baku. In the Southern basin the winter is mild, very IPile snow falls on the coast of Gilan and on the coast of Mazandaran any snow at all is abnormal. The prevailing winds in the open sea are North and South and gales are most prevalent in winter and spring, but even in fair weather storms rise and fall with great suddenness, and the sea, from being as calm as a mill pond, within a few hours becomes very rough and as quickly subsides. These sudden winds are probably caused by the heating and cooling of the desert. At Baku in summer a strong wind off the shore blows from 1 or 2 to 5 days at a time and drives clouds of dust which hide the land. There is no tidal rise or fall, but a strong wind makes a dif ference of some inches at Baku and of some feet near the mouths of the Volga, where the sea is very shallow. In the Northern basin, especially, there appears to be a circular anticlockwise current which is lessened or increased by heavy winds. In this basin heavy atmospherics are very prevalent in spring and summer and interfere with wireless. Fogs are very prevalent near Baku and may be due to a current of cold water from the North being forced up to the surface by the submerged ridge between Baku and Krasnovodsk. Similarly during April and May, when the ice is breal ing, the cold water coming South causes thick fogs in the Northern Caspian. . Salinity steadily increases from North to outh Forty miles from the mouths of the Volga ships pump Pesh drinking water and at Chechan Island. 100 miles from the Volga, the wa er is sti 1 s table for washing purposes. In the ‘ outh- em basin ships draw their fresh water from the Kura river. The treaty of Turkomanchai imposed by Russia on Persia in 1828, stipulated that the Persian flag should not be flown by 2 D Natural Features of Caspian Sea.

In 1838 Russia occupied the J ttle isfand ol Ashuradeh, close to the end of the spit of Miyan- kaleh at the entrance to the Gulf of Astarabad, as a naval nase m the .Southern Caspian to check Turkoman piracy. In ,., 6 1 t l deCr f e l .? f , the Russian Imperial Council of State prohi- ited the establishment of companies for the navigation of the aspian y any but Russian subjects and the purchase of any shares m such companies by foreigners. The Caspian consequently became a Russian lake and means of communication across it were developed to further nani ° XpaDS1 ? n °* R usso-Persiani trade. Steamship com- panics were formed and regular services maintained. SouTbern eXP Ti b o aCh borderin g the South Western and Southern shores of the Caspian in this area affords no natural harbours and the mouths of rivers are all silted up with sandbars Shortly before 1900, however the port of Enzali was constructed by a Russian company subsidiary to the Russian Road Company, The port is formed between two spits of sandhills jutting out for several miles from the mainland between the Caspian and a large Murdao or lagoon, which is formed by the united water of several streams banked up behind these sandspits and seeking an outlet to the sea. ® 2n -^ be EaS , te , r T n ®P lt ™ ns due West from the mainland to Qazian, and the Western spit runs East North-East to 3 Enzali ihe entrance between these two spits is about 800 yards wide narrowing further in to 240 yards, and faces North West From each of these spits breakwaters have been built out for 500 yards, the Eastern breakwater in the direction of North North- S- ’ tbe , Weste l rn breakwater in the direction of North S'and wtt Inside the Eastern breakwater there is a large sandbank, ft?

Numerous ferry boats ply between Qazian and Enzali.411 tyuiMaMiiiHittW these quarters impossible. The harbour can be used by ships up to 15 feet. The depth of water at the entrance is 23 to 20 feet decreasing to 15 feet, in the centre and further in to the Eastern side it is 20 to 18 feet decreasing to 12 feet at the Fish Factory. These depths are maintained by constant dredging to remove the sand which silts up very quickly. The Enzali spit is ter minated on the inside towards the 1 Murdab by a creek between the South of the spit and an island. At the entrance to this creek there are “scour” holes of 30 feet, and 17 feet can be obtained for about mile up it. On both sides of it wharves have been built for small craft, and piers where oil steamers pump out. There are a number of oil and petrol tanks, also wood and store houses. Native craft use this creek and Enzali. On the side of the Russian settlement of Qazian are 4 wharves, giving 6 berths, with 15 feet of water alongside. The wharves are narrow and above ground level and are connected by ramps and causeways up to the roads behind them. There are no cranes. Water is obtained from tanks brought alongside. The Port Administration have small 2 workshops and port Adminis dynamos, but there are no docks or repair facilities and the tr ation. port is dependent on Baku. The Administration have a water supply. For the Port Trust see Chapter VII, paragraph (C) Foreign interests page 272. The Murdab is some thirty kilometres at its greatest length Murdab. from East Southeast to West Northwest and 10 kilometres in width from Enzali to Pir-i-Bazar river. Its average depth is from 30 to 90 centimetres and its maximum depth from 1J to If metres so it can be used by small native craft. Flat bottomed sailing boats and some launches ply between Enzali and Pir-i-Bazar at the South East corner of the Murdab, which is connected by a metalled road and narrow gauge railway with Rasht. Prior to the construction of the Enzali- Rasht road by the Russian Road Company this was the regular route from Enzali to Rasht, and it is still considerably used especially for merchandise as the cost of transport is less than by the Russian road. There is no harbour between Enzali and Bandar-i-Gaz, in Ofeer^ading the Murdab of Astarabad, but there are several trading stations 1 For a description of Mur dabs see Chapter II, ^ Geography page 99. s In 1919 these were in poor condition.412 Steamship 1 } Companies, Services.; along the coast. They are unsheltered and the sea is too shallow for steamers to approach. They anchor from a half to one mile out to sea and cargoes are taken to, or fetched from, the open beach by small native boats, which can, however, only work in calm weather. If the sea is too stormy for them the steamer- must either delay or go on to its next point of call. The principal of these stations are :— Ghamkhdleh and Riidisar for the Langarud and Lahiian trade, Shahsavdr in Tunakabun. Meshed-i-Sir for the Barfarush trade. Meshed-i-Sar comes second 1 in importance to Enzali and a concrete wharf for native boats has been built beside the customs houses at the mouth of the river Babul. Other smaller stations exist where steamers call by arrange ment when cargoes are available, e.g., Chunchunchidn 2 Mahmud- abad, at the mouth of the Haraz the station for Amol and Farahdbdd, at the mouth of the Tejen, the station for Sari etc Owing to Bolshevik activities in the Caspian steamship services have been disorganized and suspended. Before the Russian Revolution the principal company was the Caucasus and Mercury and Yostotchnoe Obchestvo Com pany. It used to run a direct service thrice weekly from Baku to Enzali duration of voyage 20 hours, Baku to Astara once weekly, duration of voyage 18 hours, and a weekly coasting service round all the Persian trading stations on the Caspian. The steamers carried passengers and cargo. The rates undergo considerable fluctuation. In 1919-20 they were:— Passengers. MERCHAN DISE. 1st Class. 2nd Class. 3rd Class. per poud ] (36 lbs.)

No Inland waterways of importance exist in this area. A few rivers admit of navigation by small native river craft for the last few miles of their course through the plains of Mazan- daran and Gilan. Their mouths are all very shallow owing to sand bars. Such rivers are the Babul, from Barfarush to Meshed-i-Sar, the Langarud from near Lahijan via Langarud to Chamkhaleh, which has considerable traffic, and the Safid Rud. The Babul and Langarud do not average more than 3 to 4 feet in depth. They are both sluggish. The Safid Bud becomes navigable below Imamzadeh Hashim, but is very swift until a short distance below Kisom ferry on the RashGLahijan road. A mile below Kisom two branches of the river unite andj during the high water season in May the river was 150 yards wide, 10 ' to 12 ' deep in the middle with an average depth from bank to bank of about 3£'. The bed is stone and shingle with a deposit of alluvial mud. There are a few rapids below the junction of these two branches, but the river soon becomes more placid and 8 miles down stream of Kisom at 1 2 Astaneh it has contracted to a width of 80 yards, is 10 ' to 12 ' deep, and flows through woods between high earth banks with a steady current flowing at about 6 miles per hour. These features continue unchanged down to its mouth at Hasan Kiade, where it has widened to* about 120 yards. In these lower reaches the river has frequently changed its course and caused considerable damage. It has recently formed a new channel from three miles below Astaneh and enters the Caspian some 2 miles West of its former mouth by Lionosoff’s fishery station. The volume of the river diminishes greatly in the autumn, but from 3 or 4 miles below Kisom to Hasan Kiade it is probably 5' or 6 ' deep. A 3 few boats with rice and local produce are floated down- and laboriously towed and poled back upstream. 1 The river forks at Konasan, two ‘ faxsakhs ’ upstream of Kisom. 8 A large village of 400 houses. There are no other villages of consequencs- between Kisom and Kasan Kiade, a distance of about 20 miles. 3 Ko statistics of the number of boats is available. Fifty is probably a maxi-- mum estimate.415 C.—Laud Routes.* This area owing to its central position within the Russian ( ^ 1 ^ eable sphere of influence in Persia and the development of commu nications to further the expansion of Russo-Persian trade, is better provided with roads than other parts of Persia, and the main trade route from the North, Tabriz-Kasvin-Tehran, con tinuing East to Meshed and South to Qum, and from East to West, i.c., Enzali-Rasht-Kazvln-Hamadan, are carriageable throughout during the greater part of the year. The carriageable roads are :— 1. Metalled roads passable for all kinds of motor transport at a ll seaso ns. (a) ^nzali-Rasht-Eazvin. (b) 1 KazvIn-Tehran. (e) Kazvin-Hamadan (Snow requires clearing froin the Sultan Bulagh Pass 7,700' between Aveh and Manian in **winter). (d) 2 Tehran-Qum-Sultanabad. (e) Rasht-Pir-i-Bazar. In addition there are a few miles of metalled roads in the immediate vicinity of Tehran, leading from the city to the summer palaces and resorts of Shimian. 2 Partly metalled or unmetalled roads passable for carts at ***certain seasons, and in parts for various types of motor transport.

In the exceptionally severe wfuter of 1920-21 it was, however, closed to motor traffic for 6 weeks from 20th Tnnuarv and for periods of several days to any wheeled traffic. JanU *,*p r0 m December to latter part of February or early March country above 1 100' or 5,000' is liable to be under snow, rendering such routes impassable for w’heels Pack animals tread down a narrow path of hard, snow, but, when the thaw sets in, the plains and valleys become a bog and travelling is difficult e ve n / 0 Q 0 ^ Is ^ ruc ^ e( j by Brssian Boad Company. The cost of construction of this road from Rasht to Kazvin was about £300,000. „ a Constructed by Messrs. Lynch Bros. See Chapter \ II, paragraph (c) British and foreign Interests page 271. T . r ,- This r0 ad is now (1920) being continued to Isfahan from Qum.it into a good dry weather road, usable also except in really wet weather. (g.)— Tehran-Meshed. This road is unmetalled but much used by pilgrims, and carts and carriages travel over it throughout the year. Parts of it however become very heavy when wet, especially near Aivan-i- Kaif, Khar, and for 10 miles West and East of Nishapur, and there is heavy sand between Samnan and Shahrud. In 1915-16 several Russian motor cars performed the journey from Meshed to Tehran and during the dry season from mid- April to September or October it may be regarded as just pass able for Ford vans provided picks and shovels are carried to enable small ramps, etc., to be made where necessary. From October to mid-April except during exceptionally dry winters it becomes impassable for them. The most difficult section is through tbe defile of the Caspian •Gates (Darreh-i-Aivan-i-Kaif) from East of Aivan-i-Kaif to Aliabad (in Khar), where the road is badly cut up by water channels and torrent beds and is narrow and winding. In all cultivated areas the surface' is liable to be cut up by irrigation water allowed to flow across the road. (h.)—Tehr an-Damavand. This road was constructed in 1919 by the Persian Postal Administration with good brick bridges over all streams. The descent to the Jajarud is steep but just passable for all classes of motors at all seasons. The surface as far as Jajarud is gravelly and firm, but liable to be scoured by sudden storms in spring. Between Jajarud and Damavand several sharp turns and short, but steep, ascents and descents make the driving of motors difficult. In this section it crosses elevated country and is liable to be closed for wheeled traffic by snow at intervals between December and end of February and on the Asp Char pass near Damavand some snow remains until the end of March. The road has little metal and the surface becomes too soft and muddy for motors until it dries and hardens in March or April. For transport on this road see Chapter VII, para, (e), p. 310. (i).—Tehr an-Saveh-Hamadan. This road is passable for A. T. carts and Field Guns except in spring, and a fair number of Persian carts including the ipost 1 1 Owing to some dispute about tolls the postal Administration do not use the Lynch road to Qum.418 Section 1. Section 2. Section 3. to Qum, ply over it as far as Saveh. From Saveh to Hamadaa it is only used by pack transport, mostly camels. The road nowhere exceeds an elevation of 7,000 feet but in the section Kargabad-^ubaran-Zarreh it is mostly over 6,000 feet and much snow accumulates, so that in winter ‘ charvadars ’ often prefer the easier routes via Kazvin, or from Saveh through ’Iraq to angavar In dry weather it would be passable for a single f °f c 1 on T°y s -but with difficulty, if some of the ditches were planked over. In wet weather it becomes extre- . fl and soft and ( l uite impassable for any wheeled rS, k 6 Se + C i 10nS Tehran t0 Robat Karim and Zarreh te uirkhlar being the worst. (i) • Kasma-Rasht-Lahij an -Langarud-Rudisar. This road was constructed by Sipah Salar and is the only lateral communication in the Caspian provinces deserving the name of “road The greater part of it traverses a raised causeway tnrough paddy fields with innumerable plank bridges over irrigation canals except in the vicinity of Lahiian where the country is more open and dry. The surface generally is fair in dry weather, but requires requent repairs as much of it is soft and sandy. It would soon be cut up by heavy wheeled traffic. Owing to the obstacle of the Safid Rud (see Section 2 ) very little wheeled traffic uses it East of the river. From Raima to Rasht. The road crosses a deep ford at Pasikhan. Ford vans can usually go from Rasht as far as .rasiknan and. sometimes to Kasma. From Rasht to Rashtdbdd (crossing of the Safid Rud) The road is passable for Ford vans and carts. The surface is sand. Numerous culverts are crossed and are in good condition. From Rashtabad to Langarud. The Safid Rud is crossed in 2 branches between Rashtabad and Kisom with an interval * r 11 ? ka meadow between them. The Western branch is about 50, the Eastern about 70 yards in width. Both branches are a succession of runs and pools with a gravel bottom. The depth m the centre reaches a maximum of 15' during the flood season between December and June and diminishes to 2J in October. Across each branch large wooden ferry boats carry men and animals No ramps or facilities exist for carriages and carts., but light vehicles can be manhandled on to the boats./ The surface of the road is hard, gravelly and good to 2J miles beyond Lahijan, whence for 4 miles it skirts the foot of the hills and in places rough with large protruding stones. On turning North from the hills the surface improves. Once across the Safid Rud Ford vans and carts can pass over this section. From Langarud to Budisar. In parts of this section the road s does not exceed 10' in width. The surface is sandy, many culverts are in bad condition and narrow and a carriage crosses them with difficulty. Timber is plentiful and they could be quickly repaired when this section would be passable for carts. Ford vans would probably be unable to ford three streams . 1. Daryasar, 2J miles from Langarud. A wide creek is crossed by a foot bridge 40' long on 4 trestles. The water is less than 1 deep at tue ford. 2. Shalman, 4 miles from Langarud. A stony watercourse 60 yards wide. Water in November was 10' wide and 1' deep. Foot passengers cross by boat. 3. MIyanpushteh, 6 miles from Langarud. A * Murdab ’ stream 15' wide, l^' deep between high banks, crossed by a foot bridge. ' i and 3 could be bridged without difficulty, but the Shalman becomes a big torrent in the spring. (k).—Zinjan-Hamadan. The condition of this road resembles the Tehran-Saveh- Hamadan road, No. (i) above. 3. O ther roads . With the exception of the roads enumerated above, there are no ‘ made ’ roads and communication is along tracks worn by pack animals, the carriers of the trade o! the East from time immemorial. Even along the ‘ made ’ roads pack animals shll constitute a large, probably the greater, proportion of the traffic and the collection of tolls tends to make ‘ made roads un popular with the conservative ‘ charvadars.420 The geographical characteristics o! the Persian Plateau ' an ^ of the Elburz and Caspian Provinces exercise an effect on communications in each of these areas. In the former they are comparatively good, in the latter extremely bad. Routes. PIate ‘ lU The Plateau is traversed by village tracks in every direction. -n the plains during the dry season many of them are passable for A. T. carts or even Ford vans if irrigation ditches are filled in or bridged, but they are wholly unfit for continuous wheeled traffic. Very few carts are in local use, and camels are the pack animals chiefly employed. In winter such tracks become abominable quagmires. The following are the principal “through” trade routes (l) Zinjan-Ardabxl via Khalkhal. (m) Zinjan-Sakkiz. (n) Zinjan-BIjan via Yangikand. (o) Kazvln-Saveh via Qum. ♦ (1).—Zinjan-Ardabil via Khalkhal. This was formerly an important route crossing the Kizil Uzun by iPardalls bridge, see Chapter II, p. 107, but the bridge is now breached so that the Kizil Uzun can only be crossed by animals with impunity during the low water season m summer and autumn, and the route has been deserted for a decade owing to the disturbed state of Khalkhal. The Kizil Uzun gorge is the only serious physical obstacle and the plateaus South and North of it afford easy communi cations except m mid-winter. The road was passable through out for camels.

This is the most direct route from Kazyln to Isfahan and was formerly much used for transport of merchandise to and from Russia. Since the cessation of Russian trade the Kazvln-Saveh section has been little frequented. In the autumn of 1915 the Russians used motor transport between Kazvin and Lalehkan, the fourth stage where they established a post. Saveh-Qum section is used by the Persian postal carts, from Tehran to *Qum. From Kazvin to Ismatabad mile 30 was traversed by Major Edmonds, Political Officer, Kazvin, in April 1920 and he report ed on it as “ Probably passable for all arms m summer and autumn, for infantry, cavalry and light cars in winter and spring except after rain.” At about mile 8 , a short distance beyond Mashaldar, it enters Kavir or Salt plains and af er ram is liable to become boggy and treacherous, but Ford vans can pass over it during the dry season if planks and spades are carrie . The Rud-i-Shur about mile 14, with 2 or 3 branches and other irrigation cuts are crossed by timber and brushwood bridges. The principal obstacle, the Kharrud^ at about mi e 20 , is spanned by a brick bridge in good repair.” . Beyond Ismatabad, where the road enters the hills, it is reported to be better going and the gradients easy. The natural features and olstacles of these areas and their Elburz ana effect on communications and siraitgy lave been described in Chapter II, p. 1C0-2. Their peculiar climatic conditions, which routes, render summer travelling in the lowlands through the swarms of mosquitoes and horseflies and the sultry heat as arduous as winter travelling through the snows of the Elburz, have also been described in Chapter III, p. 140-2. The Elburz mvle hads have been worn by us-age and are quite unmade except for cuttings aicng clifis or slopes subject to ano their v scouring, and some sections of stone paving (sangfarsh) in the abilit y- forests and lowlands, and they are passable ’only for mules and * 1 * They travel by this read iusteed rf the main Teh ar Qiir read, which is metalled, owing to seme dispvle with tbi pripneUrs.

Horses can only go at a faster pace than a walk over short stretches, where going is better than the average, and it is often necessary to dismount and lead them. With the exception of the Tehran-Firuzkuh-Barfarush route, none of them could be improved and rendered passable for camel, much less for wheeled transport, without prodigious labour and expense. They are of varying degrees of badness, and their character istics are excessively steep gradients and zigzags, loose jagged stones, boulders and large slabs of rock. North of the “ Northern watershed (See p. 94),” in addition to these obstacles, in the upper forest levels the rock slabs become so slippery after rain that only animals of the country can avoid frequent falls. Lower down in the 1 Mly inland; {foot hills) unless stonepaved and kept in repair, they are a tortuous succession of great boulders and mud holes, more suggestive of a torrent bed than of a road, and, where stone gives place to soft earth, the slopes are furrowed into a series of corrugations resembling a stair case. These corrugations, a speciality of Mazandaran and Gilan, are trodden by the feet of generations of pack animals and are the equivalent of the ruts worn by wheels. The hollows are 12 to 15 deep and usually filled with mud and water. The ndeges between them are about 8' wide and rounded and become very slippery after rain. Animals of the country plant their feet m the hollows, but foreign animals endeavour to walk on the ridges and fall. 2 These are the features of all the main routes leading from the plateau to the Caspian and the side tracks, which lead from yi age to village, are of course worse. To leave a main route an favour of a short cut, especially North of the “ Northern water shed, is to court trouble, and if ever a native describes a route as bad his word should be unreservedly accepted. between Taia^Mn^e 1 iS / Zar £ ham (thousand windings) of Talaghan, belo^ Xzaalne for nnn^ (se f 1 No v ; 0 below &gt; wh ere the path is seen from low oing for about 3,000 up the bare mountain side to the ridge. were comtd?telv n 1 ^!

In dry weather during autumn, winter, and early spring when the ripe fields are not artificially flooded, they admit of freer movement across country off the beaten track. Mazandaran tracks often pass between reservoirs (abbandan) along narrow sloping embankments, which after rain become so slippery that animals slide down into the reservoirs. When moving from East to West through the Mazandaran plain, it is advisable as a general principle, when possible, to select the coast in preference to an inland route. Second best is the route closest to the hills, where the sloping ground is drier and in some parts affords large stretches of open pasture land. Local transport in these plains consists of ponies (yabu), which travel better over the soft muddy ground than the mules which excel over the stony hill tracks. Conditions of travel in the Caspian provinces are severe for animals from the plateau of Persia and cause many casualties. They stumble over the rocks and holes which wrench off their ^hoes, and the tenacious mud of Mazandaran causes sores and swellings of the legs, which take a long time to heal. At the end of each stage their legs and feet should be washed in clean water, dried, and oil applied to the heels. The change of fodder from “ bhusa ” to rice straw, not infrequently also from barley to rice, disagrees with them and causes them to lose condition. For camels and of course for wheels the whole of the Caspian provinces, with the exception of the made roads in Gilan, radiat ing from Rasht, and of the beach, which would be passable for camels but too soft and heavy for wheels, are utterly im passable. 1 1 Constant attention must be paid to shoeing. Shoeing smiths capable of putting on a Persian, but not a European, shoe can be found in most villages along routes followed by ‘ charvadars,’ but shoes are frequently wrenched off at a dis tance from any village, and a farrier with a supply of shoes and nails, which are often unobtainable locally, should accompany any party with animals. Local animals are roughly shod with iron plates covering the whole sole of the [foot with the exception of a small aperture near the heel. Their disadvantage is the necessity of cutting away the frog and the tendency to cause thrush from an ■accumulation of dirt between the foot and the shoe. They are consequently un suitable for the soft wet ground of the Caspian provinces, but over the dry stony Elburz tracks there is less risk of thrush, and they have the advantage dt protecting the sole of the foot from injury, whereas animals shod with European shoes often become footsore./ 424 Supplies. Drinking water- The supply is practically unlimited at all stages. In the hi Is when drawn straight from the springs, it is admirably pure r wholesome, but the streams are fouled by the villagers. .

Elsewhere, e.g., in the overpopulated mountain valleys of Alamut, Talaghan, Laura, etc., even a party of 50 men and animals cannot maintain themselves loca ly and avoid fetching supplies from a distance without inflicting hardship on the inhabitants. Prices would be high. Apart from their reluc tance to part with scanty stocks, the peasantry have a keen eye to business and are suspicious, so it is politic to pay them well and conciliate them. Requisitioning as in the case of transport (see below) is very unpopular and, in such an inaccessible coun- try, most difficult if large quantities or a continuous supply are required. In summer the “ Miyanband ’’are almost deserted and even the smallest parties must either carry supplies for one or two stages, or arrange previously for them to be brought down from the villages in the hills. These villages North of the “ Second ary watershed to the North ” (See Caapter II, p. 94) are gene rally larger and better supplied than the villages on the South side of it. Compared with the Elburz the Caspian lowlands are a land of plenty. Rice is obtainable throughout in unlimited quan tities at all seasons. In the Mazandaran plain during the temperate season all the above supplies with the addition of fish are plentiful, and 1,099 men and 690 animals should be supplied 1 2 anywhere at 2 days notice, 3 * wheat, flour, and barley being the only commo dities which might prove scarce and require fetching from the towns, as the inhabitants and animals are rice eaters. In the summer the flocks and herds are driven up- to the mountain pastures and sheep and dairy produce, which are abundant in winter, become scarce. Along the coast strip between the Mazandaran and Gilan plains supplies are less plentiful in summer as the population 1 In July 1920 one troop of Guides Cavalry and 10 Gendarmes were posted at Dastgird above the Shahrud valley in Itudbar, Forth of Kazvin for a month. 100 Cossacks also passed through the district, stopping one nwht and a party of Bolsheviks followed them. Rations for these parties were obtainable as the harvest had been reaped but the Rudbar villagers in October were lamenting that their winter store of grain had been consumed and they were obliged tn go and purchase their requirements from af&amp;r. 8 Supplies obtainable in the towns are mentioned m the description of the vns of over 3,000 inhabitants at the end of Chapter II 11 3 The good wheat all comes from the hills and flour from plain grown wheat .Zft m-L~ See VII&gt; paragraph (d) ’ Agriculture (St and426 {Transport. is largely migratory, and flour, for more than 50 men, and bar ley ? at any season, can only be procured from the hills. In the Gilan plain supplies are available as in Mazandaran, but Gilan has much fewer flocks and the sheep are of poorer quality. Wheat also must be fetched from a greater distance, e.g., from Khamseh beyond the Kizil Uzun, as the hill belt between the lowlands and the Kizil Uzun valley is narrower and less productive than the wider belt of highlands which stretch East of the Safid Rud to Mazandaran. Animal rations throughout the Caspian provinces are in different. No barley is grown. Rice straw is a poor substitute for bhusa ”, and except in the towns, barley is scarce and only procurable by fetching from the ihills. Persian 1 2 mules and some 3 * ponies are employed for carrying rice, charcoal, oranges, etc., from the Caspian lowlands to the towns along all these routes. The transport available is less than the demand and the rates of hire are di igh, varying in 1920 from 200 to 300 krans per mule according to the route- and season. Fewer loads are available for the return journey from the plateau and the hire varies from 50 to 100 krans per mule. In winter the transport works principally in the Caspian province sections of these routes carrying rice and charcoal from the lowlands for store in villages North of the ridges, and in 5 summer works from them on to the towns on the plateau. In spring and autumn “through” journeys are made. A mule load varies from 6 200 to 250 lbs. and the daily stage- averages about 7 5 farsakhs (20 miles). The ‘ charvadars ’ 8 engaged in this carrying trade own 3 to ld mules each and are natives of the villages near the road along which they travel. 1 It is called ‘ Jau-i-Kuhi ’ to distinguish it from the rice, ‘ Shall ’ or ‘ Jau-i- birinj given to local animals. a The Larijan road from Tehran to Amol is the chief trade route and toetweeni 5,000 and 6,000 mules are said to work along it. Mention of amount of transport is made in the table of routes below. 8 Ponies are largely used along the easy Firuzkuh route. * In 1917-18 owing to the high price of grain many animals died or were sold to other parts of Persia. The rates of hire have doubled during recent years, u. , Except for a few weeks during June or July when the mules graze in the- highlands and their owners are busy harvesting. ‘ Mules foreign to the country cannot carry more than 150 lbs. The “ farsakh” is very variable, but averages 4 miles. It is longest in Kujur where it is nearer to 6. Persians frequently “ under ” but never “ over estimate distances. 8 In addition to the professional charvadars many villagers own one mule- which in the autumn they take down to the lowlands loaded with wheat, barley, or salt, and bring back rice. They, however; dislike going more than one stage from their homes, and if required to go further will endeavour to abseond at night.. Man ,y villages possess from 20 to 40 mules but trarsrort rs usually an transit and little remains stationary, and it is advisable to Jure mules at the start for the vhole journey. Only a small party requiring not more than 6 mules can stage J ^ them f ° r 10 kr ^ nS eaCh in rela y s lroin sta g e to Commandeering of mules is very difficult as all ‘ charvadars ’ have a wholesome dread of impressment and hard treatment meted out to them by Persian officials, Cossacks and gendarmerie. -lbere is little or no carrying trade East and West in the Caspian provinces. The peasantry own many ponies which they use for their own local work, but no estimate of their numbers is possible. They are unshod and not fit for mountain work. In t ^ e . Elb y rz villages wood for burning is only obtained from Fuel, the artificial plantations around the villages and is consequently rather scarce. J A lair amount of charcoal also is always obtainable which has been fetched from the charcoal furnaces in the upper forest levels Eorth of the watershed. 11 From the watershed to the sea charcoal is plentiful and the supply of wood unlimited. nart?nf in +L 1 %^ &lt; h 0d ° n aU ? ie m ° re 2 ° pen and le£s Precipitous Grazing, parts of the Elburz m early summer after April, its duration depending on the elevation and the naturally dry or moist nature of the soil, and on the movements of flocks which come up vO graze. -*■ autimm eiMiySnband ’ tllereiS grazing ir ° m to late The lowlands are perennially green, but the pastures are cropped very close in winter, until the spring growth begins m arch.

Prom Tehran to Meshecl-i-Sar. General Direction East to stage 5, thence North. This is the easiest, longest, and least interesting route over the Elburz. It crosses the watershed between the Persian plateau and the Caspian by the low and well defined Firuzkuh pass and presents no very serious obstacles to the construc tion of a cart road. Native 4 charvadars ’ prefer route No. 2 as it is shorter, 139 miles in 8 stages, as compared with 171 in 10 stages. As far as Damavand village in stage 2, a road has already been made by the Postal Administration, which is passable for Fords except in winter from February to March, and for Army Transport carts at most seasons.' (See Route No. (h) above page 417). Several valleys running from North to South are crossed in stages 1 to 5, and the Firuzkuh Pass in stage 6 . Beyond this pass the road descends a ravine which lower down becomes the valley of the Talar. The road is rarely less than 1' wide. The gradients are easy, and the surface better* than the average as far as stage 6 , but deteriorates in stage 7 and be comes abominable through the forest in stage 8 . Vegetation begins immediately North of the Firuzkuh Pass in stage 6 and the transition from “ yailaq ” to “qishlaq” is in stage 7. Facilities for defence and for destroying the road exist Tactical, chiefly in the Dalichai valley in stage 4, and in the defiles of stage 6 . Supplies are scarcer than along most routes as roadside Supplies villages are few and far between. No supplies are obtainable in stage 4, but the fertile districts of Varamin and Khar are accessible by camel tracks in stages 1 to 5 via Damavand and Firuzkuh. At stages 6 and 7 they must be fetched from villages within 4 miles of the road. At 7 days’ notice, 1 day’s supplies for 2000 men and 1000 animals could be collected at these stages from the hill villages of Savad Kuh, provided the inhabitants were friendly. {a) From Damavand, stage 2, to the Tehran-Meshed road Communica- at Aivan-i-Kaif, 3 stages. tions.

It is the most direct route from Tehran to the Mazandaran plain and the most frequen ted except in mid-winter when No. 1 is preferable. It is the same as No. 1 along the Damavand road to Rudahind, whence it branches North up a valley by Ah, stage 2, and crosses the Imamzadhe Hashim ridge in stage 3 to Falur, vlere it enters the district of Larijan. It crosses the Lar stream at Palur, and follows the slopes of Damavand mountain to Rahneh 8000 / , stage 3. From Rahneh it descends to the river and follows it through ravines, sometimes on the right some times on the left bank, to Amol. The road is broad, nowhere narrowing to less than 7'. The Imamzadeh Hashim ridge is steep and rocky on the Northern face, but easier, though rough, on the Southern. From Palur to Rahneh, stage 3, is fairly level hut paved with big stones and full of holes, which make tedious and difficult travelling. It is subject to scouring from the slopes of Damavand and needs frequent repairs. A 3-mile descent beyond Rahneh is steep in parts, but the surface is good to stage 4; stage 5 is again boulder-strewn, and stage* 6 through the forest is no better. “ Qishlaq ” begin in stage 5, and vegetation in stage 6 , a few miles South of Amol.The crorge of the Haraz in stage 4 is a very strong position Tactica • It is about one mile long, 30 yards wide at its narrowest pomt, with an average width of 50 yards between immense precipices. The road is cut into the face of the cliff above the river. There are many populous villages in Larijan in stages 3 Supplies, and 4 above the defile, and this district should be able to main tain a force of 2000 men and 800 animals for some weeks after the harvest. Owing to the large consumption of barley by local animals, rice would have to be mixed with barley for more than about 200 animals. The position of Larijan on the chief trade route, and midway between Khar, Varamm an Mazandaran, facilitates the provision of supplies from without.

From Tehran it crosses the Jajarud at Lashkarak, stage 1, climbs over the Afcheh ridge to Ear in stage 2, the Qau ridge to Baladeh in Nur in stage 4, the Quruq or Kalarzamin to Kujur m stage 5, whence it descends a ravine to Aliabad. The gradients are all severe, the surface, except across the open grassy plateau of Ear and the plain of Kujur, indifferent to bad, and for 5 miles in stage 6 it is very steep and an awful maze of boulders. Scrub on the hills begins on the North side of the Nur ridge in stage 5, but the plain of Kujur is bare. The forest commences a few miles North of Kujur in stage 6 , and the “qishlaq ” in the middle of this stage, sy None are obtainable in Ear, stage 2 . Supplies for 200 men and animals should be obtainable at Baladeh (stage 4 ) and Kujur (stage 5) at 24 hours’ notice. 1500 men and 800 animals; could be supplied at Kujur for some weeks after the harvest. The ‘ charvadars ’ on this road are natives of Nur and Kujur. Baladeh, Yalu, Yush, Kujur villages own 200 or more mules each. (a) From Ear, stage 2 , to Palur, Route No. 2, is 10 miles.

Surface is very good and gradients- easy. Route No. 4. From Tehran to Chalus via Nur and Pul. A fair summer route but like Route No. 3 is laborious, as it intersects valleys running West to East and climbs three ranges. It gives access to the same regions as Route No. 3 and is only used by about 300 mules belonging mostly to the *Pul district, in stage 4. From Tehran it goes down to Lashkarak and follows up the Jajarud byOshan, stage 1, to Pasham, 2J miles above Ushan, where it branches up a side valley to the North West: by Migun and Darbandisar to the Dizin ridge. From the Dizin it descends to the headwaters of the Laura (upper Karaj) flowing West to Gachisar; It goes down this- valley past Valatru (stage 2 ) and branches up the Varingru valley to the foot of the Sutak ridge, which it crosses and descends along a stream rising under Shahzadeh Kuh down to Nisind, stage 3, in the upper Nur valley. From Nisind it crosses the Kurdu ridge to Mikhsaz near Pul and follows the tributary from Mikhsaz down to the Chalus valley at Pul-i-Zughal, where it meets Route No. 5. Gradients are all severe as far as Mikhsaz in stage 4. Surface is average and is worst for 4 miles up a difficult precipitous defile from Migun in stage 2, and best from Mikhsaz to Pul-i-Zughal, stages 4 and 5. Vegetation begins in stage 4 on the North side of Kurdu and “ qishlaq ” in stage 5. Villages are numerous in the Jajarud valley, stages 1 and 2 Supplies (Migun (300 houses) is the largest), and in the Pul plain, stage 4, where supplies should be available for 1000 men and 600 animals at 2 days’ notice, reduced to 200 men and animals just before harvest.

( 1 ) Route No. 5 is the main route and much easier. ( 2 ) From Arsinkirud, in stage 5, a track goes North to the Caspian in 1 long stage. Route No. 5. From Tehran to Chains via Kandavan. This route is slightly longer than Nos. 3 and 4. Like them it is a summer route, but lies along valleys and is much easier. It is the 3rd main trade route from Tehran to Mazandaran. It is the same as Route No. 4 to Ushan, stage 1. It then turns North-West up a side valley by Ahar to the Aharbashm ridge, the watershed between the Jajarud and Laura (i. e., Karaj) basins, and descends to Shahristanak in stage 2. It lies through the Laura valleys to Gachisar, stage 3, traverses Kan davan in stage 4, and strikes the upper valleys which form the 'Chalus. It crosses to the East (right) side of the valley to Valiabad stage 4, and keeps along the slopes above the Chalus gorge until it descends by the Hazar Cham, in stage 5, to the river and follows it down to the sea. Gradients .—Ascent and descent of Aharbashm ridge in stag 2 are easy. Kandavan Ridge is only 1600' on the South, 1000' on North above the valleys ; its zigzags are steep but the climb is shorter and easier than over ridges crossed by other routes. The Hazar Cham descent in stage 5 is very steep. The track averages 10 ' in width and the surface generally is fair, and overKandavan good and free from stones. It is boulderstrewn near Valiabad, stage 4, and the Hazar Cham is very stony. The stone paving in stage 6 makes this forest section less bad than along most routes. Vegetation begins 3 miles North of Kandavan, and big forest below Pul-i-Zughal in stage 6 , which is the beginning of the “ qishlaq ” and swarms with horse flies in summer. Villages in stages 1 to 3 are numerous but, especially in Supplies. Laura are poor. In stage 4 there are no intermediate villages and no villages at all on the road side from stage 4 to stage 6 . To stage 5, Pul-i-Zughal, supplies must be fetched from Sena (30 houses) or Kalanau (70 houses) 3 miles uphill to the West on the road to Kalardasht.

Stage 2 at Sarak (15 houses) 1 mile up bhah- ristanak valley above its Dcab with main Laura valley from Gachisar—15 miles. _ , This route avoids crossing a ridge to reach Laura and ascends the valley gradually to Kandavan, the only obstacle between Karaj and the Caspian, but from Karaj to Dcab it traverses defiles and rock ledges difficult even for Persian animals, and the surface is very bad. Route No. 6. From Joistan in Talaghan to Sardabrud via Kalardasht. A summer track for local use by “ Alamutis and Tala- ghanis” fetching grain from Kalardasht, and not a trade route from plateau to Caspian. After the harvest 30 to 40 mules in each direction pass over it daily. Prom Joistan it goes up a valley by Parachan, stage 1, climbs out of the valley and over some open country to the foot of the Hazar Cham (1000 windings) of Talaghan, by which it zigzags for SjOOO 7 up to ttie Hasarch.al ridgo, close to the pea s of Takht-i-Sulaiman. North of the ridge it drops 600'to the sources of the Sardabrud in the hollow of Hasarchal, and then follows the ravine past Khurramdasht teashop, stage 2, down to Vandarebun, 7,700', 10 miles, where the Barir ravine joins from the South West. The Sardabrud changes direction from North to North East, and the valley becomes wooded. The tragk reaches Rudbarak (80 houses) the most Southerly village of Kalardasht at 20 miles, and Hasan Kif (70 houses) at 22 miles below Hasarchal. * O leaving the Kalardasht plain at its North Eastern corner the Sardabrud again enters a ravine from which it emerges on to the lowlands. Prom Kalaidasht to the coast via this ravine is about 25 miles. The road is, however, very bad and alter native Route 2 (see below) via the Chalus valley is preferable.Gradients and surface. —The Hazar Cham of Talaghan is very steep and shortness of breath caused by the elevation makes the climb severe. Its surface is fair. Down the Sardabrud to Kalardasht the descent is steady and gradual and surface average. The worst gradients and surface are in stage 4 between Kalardasht and the lowlands. Several villages are passed in Talaghan, the largest of 1 hem Supplies, being DIzan (100 houses) and Parachan (80 houses) stage 1. The Sardabrud ravines from Hasar Chal to Kalardasht, and Kalardasht to the lowlands, contain no villages. To Khur-. ramdasht teashop, stage 2 , supplies must be brought from Kalardasht, stage 3, where 1,000 men and 600 animals could be supplied at 48 hours’ notice. Kalardasht should be able to maintain 1,300 men and 800 animals, reduced to 300 men and 200 animals, before the harvest. ‘Charvadars’ met on this route are Talaghanis and Alamutis. Transport. In Kalardasht about 600 ponies (yabu) are used by peasantry for local work.

Alternative Routes. It crosses the hills North of Kazvin to the deep Shahrud valley, ascends the Alamut valley in stages 3 and 4, crosses the Salambar ridge in stage 5 and follows the Seh Hazar ravine to the lowlands. Gradients and zigzags as far as stage 5, especially out of the Alamut gorge are severe, but for an Elburz route the surface is fair throughout. Stage 7 is rocky, but the most difficult sections have good stone-paving (sangfarsh). Climatic variations are excessive in this route, as the Shahrud and Alamut valleys in stages 3 and 4 are “ qishlaq Vegetation begins below Maran in stage 5, and forest below Sar-i-Balan in stage 6 . The ..transition to the “ qishlaq ” of the Caspian provinces is in stage 7. The defiles between Sar-i-Balan and Gavbar in stage 6 make this route one of the easiest to close against an invader from the North. Villages in Alamut to stage 4 are numerous but poor. North of Salambar supplies are scarce, especially in stage 6 , but could be collected from Do Hazar within 3 days or from Kalardasht in 5 days. (a) From Alamut stages 3 and 4 to Talaghan—3 routes.

Most of the tracks ascend narrow valleys from Kazvin, 4,500', with fairly easy gradients up to the water shed with an average elevation between 7,000' and 7,500' and then make a much more abrupt descent to the Shahrud between 3,000' and 2,500'. The last 2 miles are usually very steep. The watershed is snow-covered in w inter, but, with the exceptionof the track via Qustlnlar, these tracks are generally passable for mules. A list, of the principal tracks is attached to the route report. Route No. 8. From Kazvin to Rudisar via Gavanehkul and Pul-i-Rud. This is the shortest summer route from Kazvin to the Caspian, but is considered bad beyond (i.e,-North of) the Shah- rud valley and is less used than Nos. 7 and 9. Convoys of mules from villages of Ishkever district around the sources of the Pul-i-Rud are, however, fairly numerous. From Kazvin this road goes up into the hills along the narrow valley above the reservoir. It is stony in parts, but the ascent is gradual except for the last mile up to Zirishk, stage 1 , which is situated on a plateau on the west of the valley. Beyond the village the road rises over open country to the Zirishk ridge at about 7,500'. Just north of the ridge it forks. The left hand branch via Falar (70 houses), 8 miles from Zirishk, leads down to Dehdushab Pole bridge over the Shahrud, 11 miles, and goes up the right bank to Shahristan 15 miles. This is a detour necessitated when the Shahrud is in flood. The direct road descends a valley to Sapuhin, keeps along the hillside and crosses a low ridge to the west out of the valley, and descends to Fanifin. The surface is very fair, but the last two miles of the descent are steep. From Fanifin it crosses the Shahrud by a ford to Shahristan at 12 miles, where the Naini Rud, a fair sized tri butary, comes down from the north. From Shahristan, about 2,600', the road ascends the Naini Rud ravine by Razmian (house of Sardar Sa’id), Hir, and Viar up to Gavanehkul at about 10,000', descends to the headwaters of the Pul-i-Rud by Laspu in Ishkever, and follows this valley down to the coast in the district of Siyahristaq. From Viar to Gavanehkul, a distance of about 8 miles, the gradients are reported to be severe, the path narrow and in places overhanging a precipice, and the surface very bad, and the Gavanehkul has earned the nickname of the ‘ kafan bekul ’ (don your shroud). The descent on the north side is easier. In stage 5 down the Pul-i-Rud ravine through the £ Miyan- band ’ the surface is described as very bad. From villages at every stage.

Route No. 9. From Kazvin to Rudisar or Langarud via Amlish. This is the easiest mule route from Kazvin to the Caspian, passable without difficulty for foreign horses and mules. It crosses the hills North of Kazvin by the Kamasar Pass about 7,500 / and descends to the Shahrud at Anbuh bridge at about 2,500', climbs over the undulating Turar ridge above Kihshum at 7,100' and descends to the Chakarud valley (a branch of the Pul-i-Rud) between 4,000' and 5,000', whence it crosses the Latakuh ridge at about 7,500' and makes a steep descent to the Shalman ravine which it follows to the Gilan plain past Amlish to the Langarud-Rudisar road. The gradients are easy over undulating hills and the surface much, better than the average and freer from stones. The descent from Latakuh to the Shal man ravine is the worst section. Vegetation begins in stage 5 and the qishlaq in stage 6 . The country is hilly but comparatively open except down the forest clad Shalman ravine in stage 6 . None obtainable at Bulurdukan, stage 5. Umam, stage 4 is in the fertile Dailiman area and supplies for 1,000 men and 600 animals could be collected at 3 days’ notice except in May and June before the harvest. A force of 500 men and 300 animals could probably be maintained locally for some weeks except before the harvest when 100 men and 50 animals would be the maximum which could live on the country. Grazing on the undulating hills in stage 4 is excellent in May and June until the grass withers in July. (1) Route No. 10 from stage 4 to Lahljan. A very bad road.

The highlands of an average height from 6,000' to 7,000' traversed by these routes within the triangle Rahmatabad- Mimtn-Amarlu are undulating, open and not wooded Thev admit of free movement and many paths connect t different villages. They are, however, difficult of access from without and steep forest clad approaches lead up to t^ fro the lowlands, from the Safid Rud on the West via the Siyahrud ravine to D^mash or Dailiman, from the Gilan plain on the North via the Shimarud ravine (Route No 10) or Amhsh and Shalman ravine (Route No. 9), and on the South they end m .scarp above the Shahrud valley.

From Lcshan it goes to Bivarzin (20 houses) 4J miles North East of Lcshan, stage 1. From Bivarzin an indifferent and ill defined track climbs steeply to mile 5 at Shuran, a summer camp of Kurdish nomads of Amarlu. At 6 | miles it reaches the summit of a wide open ridge the watershed between Shahrud and Siyahrud which it follows in an easterly direction to mile 18. There is no definite track but ‘ going ’ is excellent. The ridge is covered with grass which affords splendid grazing in May and June, and several shepherds’ camps are dotted along it. It commands wide views far up the Shahrud valley, and of Dalfak mountain to the North. From mile 18 the track descends easily to Damash (30 houses) on a small plateau at the source of the Siyahrud, the summer residence of the chiefs, of Amarlu, and deserted in winter, at 19J miles, stage 2. From Damash the track crosses a low ridge to Asiabar (100 houses) and Dailiman a distance of 10 miles. Direction North East. Supplies for 20 men, hut no barley, are obtainable at Damasb in summer.

After Sutak is closed charvadars ’ of the Pul district travel by this route (Route No! 5) to Tehran until they are finally snowed up for the winter.450 The track leaves the Nur valley, crosses Balangibu ridge to Kamarbun and a second ridge named Turkubashm to Duna, whence it follows a stream flowing West to join the valley run ning North from Kandavan, and form the headwaters of the Chains. Above the junction it meets Route No. 5 and goes South along it over Kandavan to the Laura valley as far as Shahpul bridge 1 mile South of Gachisar, where it leaves Route No. 5 and turns West up the Azadbar valley along the direct route from Talaghan to Tehran, which is considerably used. The Asalak ridge is closed for two months in winter. The track on leaving Shahpul rises for several hundred feet along the mountain side North of the river until it makes a steep descent down to it and goes through open cultivated land to Azadbar, 8,500',*(60 houses), 6 miles from Shahpul. From Azadbar to Asalak ridge is an easy ascent of 6 miles, and the descent to the Talaghan valley also appears gradual. The first village reached in Talaghan is Garab (20 houses) stage 6 . The surface is good and free from stones. S applies. Duna valley contains 3 or 4 prosperous villages. Laura and Talaghan villages are poor and a force stationed in those villages would require to fetch supplies from Kalardasht or via Tehran. Sheep are plentiful especially at Azadbar, which has very fine grazing from June to August. Section ■ 3. Shahrak Kalarud Hasanabad Stage 7 | Talaghan district. &gt;■ Rudbar district. 8 . Dastgird .

In stage 7 it passes through a ravine for 2 miles to Mir (250 houses), situated on a steep hill above the river. From Mir it descends and crosses a pole bridge. l,n these 2 stages 'the Talaghan river is unfordable from March to May, but it is marrow and crossed by pole bridges near all the principal villages.Stage 9 is difficult. The river enters a gorge and the track goes up into the hills above the left bank. It descends at Shxreh Kuh (pole bridge) and goes down the stony Shahrud water-course, which lower down contracts to \ mile between cliffs. When the river is in flood it becomes impassable, and a difference path along the hills must be taken, which descends near Siyahdasht bridge (see below.) An alternative route is from Shahrak in Talaghan via Shahrak in Alamut (vide Route No. 7 communications) and down the Alamut valley or via Mu’allim Kalayeh and the Rudbar villages (vide Route report Kazvln-Tunakabur alternative route A) in two stages. This route is easier, especially when the rivers are unfordable, and supplies are plentiful. The junction of the Alamut and Talaghan rivers near Shireh Kuh forms the Shahrud, which from March to mid-June .us a formidable torrent, unfordable and too swift for boats, ihe watercourse is wide and stony and the channel constantly shitt ing, so that bridging is impossible except at a few narrow points. There is a pole bridge at Siyahdasht, 1 mile above Hasana- bad (on right bank) and 6 miles below Shireh Kuh. Route No. 7 crosses at Shireh Kuh, Karindeh dial—3 miles below Shireh Kuh—or Siyahdasht according to the route chosen from Kazvin to Shahrud. Stages 10 and 11. The track follows the valleys. There are several villages up the side valleys, and additional supplies can be fetched from the Dikin-Mu’allim Kalayeh area (South East). There is a pole bridge at Dehdushab in stage 10, 4 miles below Shahristan and 10 miles below Siyahdasht, crossed by Route No. 8 when the Shahrud. is in flood and.cannot be crossed by the ford between Fanif.in and. Shahristan. At Anbuh, 12 miles below Dehdushab, is a solid one arch, brick bridge 60' above the water in centre, 50' span and 15 road way. The top is considerably worn and the approaches on both sides are bad. It is crossed by Route No. 9. Stages 12 and 13. Below Anbuh bridge the Shahrud flows through a gorge, reported to be passable for pack animals with great “difficulty for 16 miles as far as Parudbar, where there is a pole bridge, 12 miles upstream of Loshan brick bridge on the Kazvin-Manjil road. The regular mule route follows Route No. 9 up to Kilishum stage II, and from Kilishum runs West South West about 4 miles above the Shahrud over a series of switchbacks between 3 , 000 ' and 6,500' across parallel valleys and spurs running down452 Supplies. to the river. Four miles from Kilishum it passes Naveh (25 houses) and Viyeh (50 houses) in a valley and crosses a low ridge to Yakunim (30 houses) in another valley at 8 miles. There is a steep rocky descent from a ridge to Jarindeh (400 houses) the chief village of Amarlu at 14 miles, see'Route No. 11, in a culti vated valley. Stage 13. Pass Pakideh (40 houses) 1J miles, Sangarud (50 houses) (?) 8 miles, to Loshan (?) 16 miles. Stage 14. Strike down to the Russian road, 1 mile below Loshan bridge, and follow it to Manjil. Section 4. From 1 Man]il to Mianeh 144 miles in 2 9 stages. This is a series of village to village tracks and is not a recognized ‘ charvadar ’ route. From Manjil to Darram, stage 3, it goes up the valley at some places close to the left bank of the Kizil Uzun, at others at a distance of 2 or 3 miles from it. It is an easy route for pack animals including camels, and the surface is good. In stage 4 the route passes out of Tarum and enters 1 section 3 of the Kizil Uzun valley, and climbs into the hills of Khalkhal above the Kizil Uzun gorge, crosses the Shahrud valley and approaches the Aq Dagh in stage 5. The gradients are steep and probably impassable for camels 3 without accidents. From stage 5 to 6 there is a choice of routes keeping to the left, or crossng to the right , 4 of the Kizil Uzun. All routes traverse the plateaus above the gorge Camels travel without difficulty on the right side. In Tarum supplies for 200 men and animals could be collected where required at 24 hours’ notice and a force of 1,300 men and 800 animals could be maintained by fetching additional rice and vegetables from Gilan, and sheep, wheat, and barley from Zinjan. In Khalkhal, North of the river, a force of 200 men and animals could maintain itself locally.

The land route consists of a series of tracks used by local villages, or by ‘ charvadars ’ carrying rice from the productive districts, i.e., the deltas of all the principal rivers, inland to the mountain villages and to the towns of Kazvin and Tehran, and only passable for ponies and mules.

Basht. — Pir-i-Bazdr. A narrow gauge railway about 71 miles long, worked by Mr. Khustaria for traffic between Rasht and Enzali via the Murdab. There is also a line for carrying stone from quarries at Punal, West of Enzali, to the edge of the Murdab, whence it is trans ported by boat to Enzali. Surveys have been made recently by British Concerns interested in Persia with a view to a possible extension of the railway from Quraitu to Ramadan and Tehran. D—TELEGRAPH AND POSTAL. Telegraphs. Owing to her geographical position between India and Europe, Persia is traversed from Julfa in Azarbaijan in the North West to Kuh-i-Malik Siah in Sistan in the Fouth East and Bushire in the South by grand trunk lines under British management and worked by British staffs of the Indo- European Telegraph Company and of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. Awakened to the advantage of tele graphs in a country where absence of roads and difficulty of travelling makes postal correspondence slow and irregular, the Persians also started an internal telegraphic system between the principal towns controlled and worked by the Persian Tele graph Administration. 1 Telegraphic communications are better developed than any other form of communications in Persia. 1 The institution of telegraphs has had considerable political effect, aslhe Persian Government is now able to keep itself informed of events in « he provinces.Trunk Lines. These were constructed as the result of various conventions and concessions since 1863 granted by the Persian Government. By the terms of the present concession, which is in force until 1945, the Persian Government has a claim on | of the receipts of all bond fide terminal messages, and the free use of one wire reserved to them and utilized by the Persian telegraph Ad ministration throughout the system. In return they grant the right of transit for Indo-European telegrams across Persian territory. The Persian Government have no control over the Indo-European lines or administration and they must pay for any 2 wilful damage caused by Persians to the telegraph lines at a fixed rate. The transmission of Persian internal telegrams over the trunk lines, e.g., from Tehran to Tabriz, was discouraged except by the wire made over to the Persian Telegraph Administration,, as it caused local congestion on the lines to the detriment of Indo-European traffic. Until 1914 through non-stop messages were transmitted from London via Tehran to Karachi. Communication was- stopped through Germany in 1914 and cannot at present be restored owing to the disturbed state of Russia.^ Telegrams from Tehran for London are now transmitted via India, and thence by the Eastern Telegraph Company’s cables. Tehran is the meeting place of two systems, which -were worked in conjunction. (а) The Indo-European Telegraph Company’s lines from London to Tehran. (б) The Indo-European Telegraph Department s lines- from Tehran to Karachi. The Department is a British Government institution. Both Company and Department worked with the Eastern Telegraph Company on a Joint Purse Agreement. IThe first direct telegraphic communication between Englana, and India via Persia was effected in 1863, when the British i i This wire is linked up with the Persian telegraph administration’s o%es„ which control traffic over it and transmit telegrams on the same rates and con tions^ important proviso as much damage was at first caused by tribes men especially in Azarhaijan, cutting the lines and shooting at the insulators. Under the svstem of compensation the Persian Government recouped itself from the provincial governors, who in turn exacted a larger amount from the villages- of the culprits.456 lado-Buropean Telegraph Company. Government constructed a *line from the Turkish frontier near Baghdad, where it joined a Turkish line, via Kirmanshah, Hamadan, Tehran, Isfahan, Shiraz to Bushire, where it met a submarine cable running Eastwards laid in the same year. In 1863 also a non-British line from Tehran to Tabriz was continued to Julfa. An alternative route was thus afforded as far as Tehran and for some years telegrams between Europe and India were transmitted via Constantinople, Baghdad to Tehran, or via Russia, Tiflis, Tabriz to Tehran, and thence to Bushire. In 1870 Messrs. Siemens of Berlin opened a two wirehne on iron posts through Germany and Russia to Julfa and Tehran. Owing to the improved through communication established by this line, the British Government no longer required the Bagh- dad-Tehran section of their line and *ceded it to the Persian Government, and forwarded on the messages received at Tehran via Julfa by their line to Bushire.] Messrs. Siemens sold their line to the Indo-jEuropean Tele graph Company, retaining until 1914 a German Director on the board and a few shares. The Company’s head offices are in London, and the Persian section of their line is controlled by a superintendent in Tehran. The Company maintained through communication by its own cables and lines from Lowestoft to Emden and through Germany and Russia to Julfa, whence it traversed Persian terri- torry for 456 miles to Tehran. In 1914 owing to the pressure of traffic a third line was added through Europe and a fourth from Julfa, i.e., 3 wires for international traffic, and 1 wire for the Persian Government. Messrs Siemens had experienced difficulty in the maintenance of the line through Azarbaijan owing to the depredation of the Shahsavan tribes, but the Company overcame the difficulty by the Compensation Arrangement with the Persian Govern ment and by the use of extremely stout wire, which was difficult to cut, and of strong iron standards. The Company have a telegraph office at Tabriz and control stations for the supervision and working of the lines at Mianeh, Zinjaa and Kazvin, with telephones fitted for conversation between adjacent stations. *By the Anglo-Persian Telegraph Convention of 1872 the Indo-European Telegraph Department have the right to resume the working of this line. ‘ See above, page 455. * In 1918-20 these stations were opened as offices for the convenience of the British troops in the area.2 o ire, 1 tie ■an to Tat® ( ' woipireli® 9 Jfa and estt lired tie to the Pe^ irei rector on » the Pe^ t in Tebrtt tioii by D d tiW eisian terri- 457 The British Government lines through Persia South of Tehran are under the control of the Director of the Persian indo- Em opean Section of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in Tehran TeI egrapn t , -I-. j j Department. In 1907 the Department completed a line right through the centre of Persia uniting Tehran with Kub-i-Malik Silh in Sistan, the frontier between Persia and British Baluchistan where it was connected with the Indian system through Balu chistan to Karachi. This “ Central Persia line ’’ runs from Tehran through Qum, Kashan, Khalidabad, Ardistan, Yazd Kirman, Bam to Kuh-i-Malik Slab with connecting lines to the Persian Gulf Ports, where it meets the submarine 1 cables, from Ardistan via Isfahan and Shiraz to Bushire, and from Kirman do Bandar-Abbas. The central office of the Department in Tehran is connected with the summer quarters and office of the Director at Qulahak.

The Arahistan lines, Bushire—Ahwaz—Dizful—Sus, and Ahwaz—Muhammarah, total distance 417 ^ miles with 8 offices have been constructed and are maintained by the Depart ment on behalf of and at the expense of the Persian Government, Persian Telegraph Administration. The lines belonging to the Persian Government are worked bv a Persian Staff under the control of the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs in Tehran, assisted since 1911 by Mr. x New as Adviser, who was seconded by the Indo-European Telegraph Department for service with the Persian Government. A “Chief of Telegraphs” is included among the depart mental officials who form the staff of provincial governors. For all details of internal administration the official is directly responsible to the department in Tehran. The working and materials of these lines under a Persian administration and with a Persian staff naturally compare unfavourably with the Indo-European lines worked by their British staffs. The lines are of single wire on roughly constructed wooden poles and the transit duration of the messages, especially where they change lines, e.g., from Tehran to Khurramabad (Tunaka- bun) via Rasht, or Tehran to Firuzkuh via Samnan sometimes amounts to several days. They are, however, only required to transmit Persian internal messages and, compared witn other branches of Persian administration the organization and development of the telegraphs are good and yield an annual surplus over and above their working expenses. 1 1 Mr. New was engaged as Adviser. On the renewal of his contract a paragraph was added that he would act as Director General with his powers to be Axed by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs. These have never been defined and he has been unable to obtain full powers for the organization of the administration.459 The total length of these lines exceeds 4000 miles.

Wireless Telegraphy. With the exception of the wireless apparatus with. these forces and a receiving apparatus at the French Legation in Tehran* no wireless stations exist in the area. The Russians had a wireless station at Enzali. Postal Services. Nasir-ud-Din Shah, as the result of his visit to Europe in History. 1873, engaged two officials of the Austrian postal department in 1874, who started a local service between Tehran and Shim- ran summer villages in 1875, and in 1876 a regular weekly service between Tehran, Tabriz, Julfa, and Rasht. During ' The Russian Bolshevik Minister set up wireless at the Russian Legation.462 Present organi* sation. the following year the service was extended to connect all the principal towns in the provinces with Tehran, and on the 1st September 1877 Persia became a member of the International Postal Union. Until 1901 the posts were farmed out for £12,000 per annum, but in 1901 the farming system was abolished and the posts were placed under Belgian control. The posts are now managed by the Minister of Posts, and Telegraphs who is a member of the Cabinet. He is assisted by a Belgian, X M. Molitor, with the title of Director General, who is under the orders of the Minister, and is statione m Tehran. He has no Belgian assistants and the StaS are all Persian. Like the Telegraphs the postal revenues exceed expenditure and it is one of the few Persian Government departments show ing an annual profit. In each of the provinces a ‘ Chief of Posts ’ is appointed, who is subordinate to the Director General in Tehran. Post offices and branches in the whole country axe reported in the annual statistics to number 202, and the mileage traversed by the postal services to approximate 12,000 miles. The services are, however, extremely limited and only serve the towns and the larger villages on the. routes between them. With few exceptions there are no posts into the country districts and, as in the Empire of the ancient Medes and Persians, letters can only be sent by special 2 messengers or by 3 mule and camel-men travelling along the trade routes. Along the carriageable roads the mails are despatched in ‘fourgons’, 4 wheeled wagons, which change horses at the post houses and average 80 to 90 miles per diem, elsewhere they are carried on pack animals and in a few cases by courier, with an average rate of transit of 20 to 30 miles a day. ^ 1 Brother of the Director of Customs. a “ Qasid ”. • “ Charvadars &lt;466 The Inland Postal Service is frequently irregular and delayed by snow in winter, and in sections may be suspended owing to local disturbances, but it is fairly reliable. Letters are delivered twice daily in Tehran, Basht, and Kazvin, and in other places after the arrival of a post. Parcels must be fetched from the post office by the addressee on receipt of notification. Passenger tickets are issued to travel in postal fourgons. Foreign Postal Before 1914 the post from Tehran to London via Bussia Service. took 10 or n q a ys under favourable conditions. At present it is very slow and irregular via the Persian Gulf from Tehran to Baghdad taking 18 to 20 days, from Tehran to Karachi 1 month, from Tehran to London 2 months or longer. There is no ‘through’ parcel post service from Persia to foreign countries for parcels exceeding 5 kilogrammes in weight. Larger parcels can only be posted to the Persian port or frontier town, where they must be re-posted. Statistics.

This Cabinet enjoyed British support and it was hoped that its more democratic composition would render it strong and popular. The British point of view was that the Anglo-Persian Agreement was hanging fire and that it would be well to conciliate public opinion and endeavour to obtain its ratification by the Majlis according to the Persian Constitution. And with the recrudescence of Russian activity in North Persia British influence was no longer unchallen 0 - The continuance until October of the monthly subsidy of 350,000 ‘ tumans ’ was guaranteed to the Persian Govern , who were to be subject to no control in their expenditure and in return undertook to convene the Majlis as early as P 088 * with a view to the ratification of the Agreement. Meanwhile pending the decision of the Majlis they insisted that no British advisers should assume duties in the Persian Departments, and General Huddleston and his assistant officers in the Centi Brigade and Mr. Armitage Smith’s financial staff were with- drawn. Mushir-ud-Dauleh, however, failed to assemble Majlis and was frightened by the prospect of financml stnngency In October after the flight of the Persian Cossacks from Easht the dismissal of their Eussian officers was urged by the British Legation at the instance of General Ironside, Gener pain’s successor in command of the British Forces m ^ or Persia ; Mushir-ud-Dauleh refused to take this step and resigne . Sipahdar-i-A’zam was willing to take office and after some SipaMar delav formed a Cabinet on November 13th. His first action Novem ^ er 1920 wa s to dismiss the Eussian officers. A proposal was made-February for the immediate re-organisation of a Persian force by Butish officers, but pending the fate of the Agreement this was not accepted by the British Government. After the failure. of this proposal the Persian Cabinet lapsed into inertia, which was facilitated by the postponement of a financial crisis through Mr. Armitage Smith’s success in establishing a claim for £1,000,000 arrears of royalty due from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Indeed the situation was growing increasingly480 Rnsso-Persian Treaty, February 1921, difficult and dangerous with the Bolsheviks in occupation of Gilan and uncertainty about British policy, at a time when the British Forces appeared to constitute the only obstacle to a Bolshevik advance on Tehran, where Bolshevik agents were already active. Provocation of the Bolsheviks was impolitic and a non-committal attitude in such a situation was in keeping with Persian Cabinet traditions ; members of the Majlis were urged to come to Tehran to form a quorum, but they too were reluctant to assemble and be faced with the awkward necessity of coming to a decision. The only step of importance taken by Sipahdar was the conclusion in 1 February of a Treaty with the Soviet Govern ment of Russia, negotiated through the agency of Mushavir-ul- Mamalik. Mushavir had been Minister of Foreign Affairs in 1.918 and was sent to Paris to represent Persia at the Peace Conference. (See pages 62 and 362.) In 1920 he was ap pointed Persian Ambassador at Constantinople and from there went on a special mission to Moscow. The principal provisions of the Treaty were :— Soviet renunciation of the old Tsarist policy of force towards Persia tending to the diminution of the rights of the Persian people, and guarantee of non-intervention by the Soviet in the internal concerns of Persia; denunciation of all imperialistic treaties affecting Persia concluded by the Tsarist Government with 2 foreign powers ; wilting off of the Russian 3 loans to Persia and renunciation of any claim on the Persian revenues by which these loans were guaranteed ; session of Tsarist under takings giving control over roads and railways in Persia and restoration of all such means of communication to the pos session of the Persian Government, on the understanding that Persia will not concede them to any other foreign power or its citizens ; the Russian roads from Enzali to Kazvin, Kazvin to Hamadan, and Kazvin to Tehran, the Julfa-Tabriz and Sofian-Urumieh railways, the Urumieh steamers, docks, etc., the Port of Enzali, the Russian Bank with all its assets (includ ing 4 buildings, etc.) and liabilities to be surrendered to Persia 1 The treaty was eventually passed by the Majlis, with some minor modi fications, in December, after a Russian protest against the delay in its ratification. 2 The 1907 Convention is indicated. s On the ground that they had been designed to promote not the economic prosperity and development of Persia, but her political enfetterment. * A proviso was added that if a Russian Consul were appointed to a town where Russian Bank buildings existed, one of them should be allotted ^by the Persian Government for his accommodation. 3 accordance iKsiomgr Meyhac f tie Treatyin accordance with this undertaking ; the cancellation of all concessions granted by Persia to Russian citizens on the ground that they had been * 1 extorted by force ; abolition of the clause of the Treaty of TurkomanchaT allowing no ships of war on the Caspian except those flying the Russian flag (see pages 3 and 409) and recognition of the right of free navigation under the Persian flag ; Russia to retain possession of the Russian Lega tion and consulate buildings in Persia ; the appointment of a Russian Minister to Tehran and a Persian Minister to Moscow, and the establishment of consulates “ at points which shall be settled by mutual consentP The Soviet Government had achieved a diplomatic success. The specious generosity of these terms was calculated to appeal to the vanity and greed of the Persians, who in return for sub stantial material benefits were only required to receive a Rus sian Minister and consuls into their country, anc t u' &gt; ova; appeared in a liberal role which by comparison made the British seem reactionary. The apparent discrepancy between &gt;. ovie professions and their descent on Enzali and mi i ary eecu pation of Gilan was explained away by the assertion that these were provoked by the presence of the British and were in no May directed against Persia, and that they won c e imme diately discontinued if the British troops were withdrawn. The obvious drawback was uncertainty about Russia-’s good faith and real intentions and the Persian inability o o er any resistance should these terms prove to be mere y ie nn end of the wedge to resume Russian penetration into Persia. While the Sipahdar’s Cabinet was feebly inactive, and re signing and reforming, the British Government had announced its decision to withdraw the troops from North iisia d 1 e following spring. In apprehension of the consequence so s withdrawal the European colonies prepared to evacuate tneir women and children ; the Imperial Bank sent away its silver coin to Bushire and British concerns generally were being wound up. ; In February the situation underwent a sudden and dia matie change.

After their entry into the city they proceeded to 'arrest all the most prominent oxandees, who had held Cabinet offices and important provm- cial Governorships, including Jarman Farma and Sipah balar. with the object of preventing opposition and of levying forced contributions of money for the needs of the administration. Pro-Bolshevik agitators w'ere also arrested. ^ Sipahdar, tne Prime Minister escaped arrest by taking ‘ bast ’ in the British Legation. No opposition was offered to the revolutionaries, who set up a Government under Saiyid Zia-ud-Din supporte by 1 2 * Riza Khan. Their intention, they declared, was to ter minate the succession of futile and mercenary governments, which made no attempt to take steps to oppose the Bolshevik advance likely to follow the withdrawal of the British troops. The Shah was a terrified nonentity during these events and perforce recognised this self-constituted Government, 'which professed their loyalty to him, while expressing their determination to remove his evil Counsellors. Energetic steps were immediately taken to raise money for payment of the troops, who were kept well in hand and a programme of eco nomy and reform was promulgated and translated into action with promptitude and enthusiasm. The suddenness, decision and secrecy of this surprising coup d’etat were most un-Persian, and British 4 authorship was freely attributed to it both by Europeans and Persians. In fact, however, the British Legation was in complete ignorance until the Cossack entry into Tehran,, and the whole scheme had been planned by Saiyid Zia, who ha gained the support of the Cossack Officers to carry it out. The British can be held indirectly to have contributed to it only b} the presence of their troops at Kazvin, which enabled the Cossack detachment to march to Tehran without apprehen sions of the Bolsheviks in their rear. Saiyid Zia was genuinely anxious for British help, but considered that this would be facilitated by annulment of the lament of 19 iste and an ei it aims and poi Ifed it cancel Sfticn that lie m tke he at ale finance de B le army, ij * fench assi 1*1 Swedish oi f® the mom* fck aggression ^|ian, He Military ** road have 1 k situation hac d along tl penetrated ir ®iebel hands, i ^ Meanwhile '«a and the' ' severec fj^ywhe ' er5 &gt;an Coss 1 The wisdom of such a step is questionable, hut it had more justiflcatiovi than would at first sight appear.

In a proclamation enunciating the aims and policy of the new Government he accordingly declared it cancelled, and he hoped by this step to allay public suspicion that he was acting on behalf of the British. At the same time he at once requested the help of English advisers in the finance department, and wished also to engage officeis for the army. As a matter of policy he proposed to e some French assistance for less important services and add - tional Swedish officers for the gendarmerie. For the moment the Government was protected from Bol shevik aggression by the British barring t re v ay r Caspian.

Detachments of gendarmerie had been posted on the passes on the principal mule routes leading from the Caspian to Kazvin and Tehran, but the rumour of the approach of a Jangali-Bolshevik raiding party was sufficient to frighten them out of Alamut North East of Kazvin and they inspired no con fidence. An offensive was, however, soon undertaken by the Cossacks and their advance and capture of Rasht on 23rd August showed that the enemy were less formidable than had been supposed. With the advent of winter and an early and heavy snowfall the mountain mule tracks were rendered impass able and the Manjll-Kazvin road was the only line of approach from the 1 Caspian, and that was now held by British detach ments between Manjil and Nuqlabar. The enemy forces, including Russians, Azarbaijanis and Persians were estimated at about 5,000. It had been suggested after the dismissal of the Russian officers from the Cossacks that a British offensive should be undertaken with the object of clearing the enemy out of Gilan, but the British Government in view of their decision to withdraw the British Forces in the following spring were averse to any further commitments in this area, and to precipitating a conflict with the Bolsheviks, with whom, despite grave pro vocation, they were not openly at war. British Military The evacuation was delayed by the long and severe winter, IkwtKPereia it was completed without interference from Kazvin by 28th April and from Hamadan by 9 th May. The North Persian Force were followed to railhead at Quraitu on the Mesopotamian border by the Persian Lines of Communication troops (Head quarters Kirmanshah) and no British troops were left in North Persia, Their positions between Manjll and Rasht had been taken over on 14th April by the Persian Cossacks to whom 14 British officers were attached. Much anxiety had been felt as to Bol shevik intentions, but they carried out their undertaking ex pressed in the Rnsso-Persian Treaty to withdraw the Soviet troops after the British evacuation, and they handed over their line in Gilan to the Jangalls. Kuchik Khan, Khalu Qurban and Ihsanullah Khan had temporarily sunk their differences and their united forces amounted to about 4,000 with 60 machine guns and Russian arms and equipment. Hitherto Saiyid Zia-ud-Din’s Government had not encounter ed any active hostility.

At Kirmanshah also Prince Sarim-ud-Dauleh was arrested by the gendarmerie in April and sent to Tehran. In other provinces the Governors had either been arrested or made terms with the new Government. The departure of the British from Kazvin immediately re acted on the Tehran political situation. Saiyid Zia-ud-Dm was unable to maintain his influence over the Cossack leader Riza Khan, who was very jealous of foreign interference, and of the granting of executive powers to the British ofticers with the Cossacks as prejudicial to his own influence.

The unstable and fickle Persian populace too, forgetful of their hatred of Russia and weary of two and a half years of British tutelage, were ready to welcome the Russian and to re turn to the old game of playing off the two powers against each other. • iniQ The internal situation was more critical than in 19 before the British Military occupation. The financial question was unsolved, the British source of supply was drained dry, except for some advances from the Imperial Bank of Persia, and the sympathy of the British Government alienated. The whole country was in confusion with the exception of the South where the South Persia Rifles were still keeping order, but they too were soon to be disbanded unless taken over by the Persian Government. The Bolsheviks had not indeed, as had been feared, followed the British withdrawal by advancing to Kazvin and Tehran, but the Persian revolutionaries in Gilan had the benefit of Russian arms and money, and were increasingly active. They had re-occupied Tunakabun and Amir Mu’aiyld, the most influential chief of Western Mazandaran, was allied with Kuchik Khan. The Caspian Provinces were again (as in 1918) removed from Persian Government control, and the centre of a formidable Communist rebellion, which aimed at the capture of Tehran. In June negotiations were held with Kuchik Khan, but with the ill success that had attended the many previous attempts to come to terms with this rebel. Azarbaijan was in complete disorder. Simko, an insurgent Kurdish chief in the Urumieh region, who had defeated attempts of gendarmerie and Cossacks under the preceding Cabinets to crush him, was becoming more powerful and aggressive. The Shahsavan tribesmen were raiding far and wide. They had looted Sarab (in June) and entered the outskirts of Ardabil and were holding up traffic on the Mianeh-Tabriz road. In the city of Tabriz the authority of the Governor-General, which had been restored in 1920 by Mukhblr-us-Sultaneh and the Cossacks (see footnote to page 260) was weakening. In Khorasan Colonel Muhammad TaqI Khan had usurped authority in Meshed. The challenge from Gilan was the most immediate. On 12th July Ihsanullah Khan and Khalu Qurban had advanced ibex 1921 . fr° m Tunakabun and occupied the Salambar pass on the road ilfim A defe iri retired to I raptured Salami i started the dis at, and the Go 1 ajh Timkaki WeofManjil 1 jj* i 1 the jungle in North ”* as ^ Khan, howev -wsace began 'itbels again cs ®ber lighting ^ and Ru ^win. it ' capture bj 'W487 the Phw lain tiler,» re is si M ^ 1 f^j ld J aro'V to Kazvin. A defending force of Cossacks had been_ driven ofi and retired to Talaghan. At the end of July Riza Khan commenced operations by the despatch of a Cossack force which ■re-captured Salambar. This success discouraged the rebels and started the disintegration of their forces by the secession of the 1 Sa’ad-ud-I)auleh with 800 men to the side of the Govern ment, and the Government troops were enabled to advance through Tunakabun to Rudisar and Langarud. Another Cossack force was successful in completely routing Amir Mu’aiyid in the Savad Kuh district of Mazandaran. The collapse of the rebellion in Mazandaran and the Mahri- i-Salas had thus been effected as suddenly as m 1018 after the “ battle of Manjil Bridge,” and rt had receded back to its birth place in the iumdes in the West of Gilan.

October and promptly executed. Subsequently Persian Cossacks* ■were sent to Mesbed and Government control was re-asserted. Tbe activities of a Russian Consul-General who arrived at Mesbed in October with a large staff of agents and propagandists are, however, a source of disquiet. Tbe difficult problem of Azarbaijan remains unsolved. Simko bas been increasingly active. On 7tb October be made a surprise descent and captured Sauj Bulagb, and only 250 of a garrison of 700 gendarmes escaped death or capture. After this success be withdrew. In November he inflicted a severe defeat on a Government force near Salmas and compelled them to retire to Khoi, though his own heavy losses in this operation appear to have damped the ardour of his Turkish supporters. Simko is estimated to be able to collect 4,000 to 4,500 men armed with rifles, and is also said to have 6 guns and 12 machine guns. Riza Khan is preparing to attack him and much may depend on the result. Riza Khan is certainly the outstanding figure in present Persian politics, and his position created by the coup d’etat of February 1921 has been much strengthened by his successes in Mazandaran and Gilan. As War Minister since the transfer of the gendarmerie from the ministry of the Interior, and the disbandment of the South Persia Rifles (see below), he has controlled all the Armed Forces in Persia; he has recently (in December) brought about the amalgamation of the gendarmerie into one force with the Cossacks and has propounded a scheme for army reform involving the creation of a uniform force of 40,000 men to be organized into 5 divisions with Headquarters at Tehran, Tabriz, Hamadan, Meshed and Isfahan respectively. His own Cossacks have hitherto remained well in hand, and it is to their interest to support him and retain the prominent position into which he has brought them, so long as he can provide funds for their pay. The increased efficiency of the troops under his command and administration has been very marked. He is a native of the Savad Kuh district of Mazandaran, a country-man of no education and very mediocre intelligence endowed with the ordinary Persian attributes of intrigue and cunning, but possessing great ambition and unusual energy and firmness of character, which may yet carry'him far. He is essentially “ Nationalist^ and opposed to foreign interference and intervention in Persia in any form, and he lost no time in ridding himself of the British officers in the Cossacks. The South Persia Rifles under British officers were also obnoxious to him, and hejerheirf id only® itute. ^ tedassr® 11 ] iUrrt up ridW,? lias dismissed the Swedes from their executive commands in the gendarmerie. He has coquetted with the Russian Bolshevik Minister, but Russian officers have not been re-instated in he Cossack division, and his object may have been to endeavour V) raise money and at the same time to conciliate him for fear of a renewal of Russian aggression in Gilan. In North Persia the situation has accordingly improved. South Persia In the South, on the contrary, it has grown worse. During Disbandment the last two or three years the South Persia Rifles had achieved 1&gt;er8i * real success in putting down brigandage and establishing law and order. The British and Indian Governments, however, refused any longer to provide funds for their upkeep and the Persian Government, between sheer inability to find the money and hostility to the force from its British connection, took no steps to take it over. Its disbandment, commenced in September and completed by November, was followed by an immediate recrudescence of brigandage along all the routes to the Persian Gulf, and British and Indian trade in these regions (temporarily at any rate) seems doomed. By the end of 1921 there were no British officers or troops British troop* remaining in Persia with the exception of one Indian battalion in 1&gt;ftrsia ‘ at Bushire providing detachments at Bandar Abbas, Henjam and Qishm Islands, Jask and Chabhar. The total eclipse of British influence in Tehran and indeed - Dec j ine of throughout the whole of Persia to an extent previously unparalle- British and led has been mentioned above. Russian influence, however, has not increased in the same proportion. The Persians were ready fl ue nce. enough to join in the anti-British tirade and to take Russian money, but M. Rotstein’s efforts to foment Bolshevism in Tehran were not equally successful, and by' August this part of his propa ganda had waned. He failed also to save his Jangall friends in Gilan. His comparative ill success may probably be attributed in part to the deep-rooted Persian suspicion of both of their powerful neighbours, which is being fostered by Nationalist and_ pan-Islamic imovements and by the idea of self -determination of small nations, and to the conservative Persian temperament, with its dislike of innovation, and in part to the famine in Russia and a shortage of money. The Russians have, nevertheless, made much progress towards the recovery of their old position in North Persia. They have re-occupied their Legation in Tehran and their Consuls have returned to the principal towns °f North Persia as far South as Isfahan, and a Russian I oreign Trade Representative ” at Tehran with agents at the Caspian 2 r490 Treaty with Afghanistan.

These activities were the outcome of the Russo-Persian Treaty concluded by Sipahdar s Cabinet m Fe - ruary and ratified by the Majlis with slight modifications m December 1921. It is impossible to predict how strong Russian influence will become and how far South it will penetrate, but it has returned to stay, and it is inconceivable that British influence should ever re-attain the ascendency it held in Tehran from 1918 to to 1920 during the absence of the Russians. It is deplora le that the only result of this short-lived ascendency has been an estrangement and embittering of Persian feeling towards Great Britain, and the final disappearance of the popularity she achieved in 1906 (see page 13). A treaty was concluded with Afganistan in November relat ing to diplomatic representatives and the status of each other s nationals, and providing for a commercial pact. The most interesting development in the internal situation illie Standard Oi 1022 . xca-j-x — Khan’s military power with its resemblance to a military dic tatorship. The financial situation has in no way improved, and the Imperial Bank has stopped advances which it was making to the Persian Government on the security of the royal ties payable by the Anglo-Persian Oil Coy. Riza Khan’s recent military expenditure amounts to 700,000 tumans a month. He has established 2 first claim on the treasury, but even if he monopolizes the Persian revenues they will not nearly meet his requirements with the present system of administration, and Mr. Armitage Smith, the financial adviser, whose success in obtaining £1,000,000 from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company might have been expected to ingratiate him with the Persians, retired in September owing to the hostility of the Cabinet and the Majlis. As a means of raising money the Persian Govern ment offered the 3 Khustaria oil concession in North Persia ip* The offen P% and ol powers and aicaiis were sta 'ii and, 1 Recently the Persian Government appear to have taken alarm, and h je issued orders restricting export of foodstuffs, and Belgov, the chief of the •Kusuan organization, was recalled in December to Russia, as the expense ol his opera tions was proving disproportionate to their value. The agencies are at lanriz, Astara, Enzali, Meshed-i-Sar, Bandar-in-Gaz, Damghan and Razyin. . . » e.g. in Azarbaijan the Customs and excise revenues are being paid oireeu into the Military Treasury; provincial postal receipts are similarly taken ove ^ * M.

The Russian Minister at -lehro® also protested to the Persian Government that their action is a breach of me Russian Persian Treaty. notto the Standard Oil Company, and the Premier Quvvam-us- Sultaneh has been secretly negotiating for American financial advisers. The offer of the oil concession is an example of Persian unreliability and of their policy of bartering concessions to foreign powers and stimulating international rivalry. The Americans were stated to be giving an immediate advance of 1,000,000 dollars, but negotiations appear to have met with a hitch, and, faced with complete lack of funds for the pay of troops and officials, the Quwam-us-Sultaneh has just (January 1922) resigned and Mushlr-ud-Dauleh is reported to be forming a Cabinet. The Shah also is on the pomt of going on a second visit to Europe, whence his return to Persia would seem very problematical. The Majlis assembled at the end of June and started the transaction of public business at the end of July* It }ias ac ^ ie , little except interference with the executive Government and has been chiefly noteworthy for its bitterly anti-British attitude. Nusrat-ud-Dauleh, who since his arrest by Saiyid Zia and the turn of the tide against British influence, has made a complete ‘ volte face,’ has squared a majority of the deputies and is a leader in these attacks.INDEX.
