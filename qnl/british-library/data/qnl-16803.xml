To this end it explains that the prisoners taken to Bombay should not be released to Sa‘īd bin Sultān Āl Sa‘īd, the Imam of Muscat, and that any members of the Beni Boo Ali tribe currently in the custody of the Imam should be released to rejoin their tribe.In response to the tribe's complaints against the destruction of their date trees and future means of subsistence, it is insisted that these were the acts of the Imam; the British do not therefore consider themselves the responsible party.Enclosed is a letter from Major-General Lionel Smith to Francis Warden, Chief Secretary to the Bombay Government, dated 15 March 1815. The letter reports the number of prisoners taken by the British Expedition against the Beni Boo Ali tribe, and sent to Bombay aboard the Liverpool.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023711598.0x000003#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
