(Date) inh' Telegram Section. ^Delete when inapplicable.Mr .Donaldson. &lt;5) V This paper came back to me today. &lt;£■ The Secretary of State held a meeting on 11th November regarding the supply of arms to Pakistan and Hyderabad. As regards Pakistan, it was decided, subject to the approval of the Commonwealth Affairs Committee at a meeting to be held this morning, that we should take the line that we are free to supply the legitimate requirements of both Pakistan and India, but that we should inform the Government of India of all supplies to Pakistan, and the Government of Pakistan of all supplies to India, so that everything may be above board. As regards Hyderabad it was decided that we should tell Mr. Krishna Menon, who has been bothering us on the subject, that it is not our intention, as things stand at present, to supply arms on any abnormal scale to Hyderabad, but that Hyderaoad is entitled to limited quantities of arms for the legitimate purposes of their State Forces and Police and that we wuulu like to know whether the Government of India are continuing as in the past, to meet these needs themselves as this would be a material consideration in our consideration^ any applications for export licences we may receive. In the light of this you may care to reconsider the draft telegram. 14 Nov.47SECRET Sir A» Carter Please see the Foreign Office note dated 1 November • ^ do not think this is at all surprising ,(except for the assumption that Dollars are available). In fact, it would be surprising were Pakistan to adopt a passive attitude on the &lt;jjestion of providing herself with arms. It boils down to the fact that until we make a decision to provide at least a quota of arms to Pakistan, she will go outside to meet her requirements# 3. As regards the draft telegram to the Pakistai High Commissioner on this subject, I suggest that para. might be deleted since we know the answer* viz. that unless we do something to help they will have to help themselves. With this para, deleted the telegram would merely become an informative one.= NOTHING TO BE WRITTEN IN THIS MARGIN. Minutes. O h. indexed MR. DONALDSON ( COMMOIT.VEALTH RSLATIOHS OFFI CE) I received a visit this morning from M. Le Roy of the French Embassy who informed me that the Pakistan Trade Commissioner in London had recently gone to Paris and had represented to the French authorities that his government desired to acquire very urgently:- 00,000 rifles, 600,000 revolvers and 300,000 light and heavy machine guns from former German weapons in France.^ The Trade Ccmnissioner had stated that his government could pay in dollars, since the British Treasury would be able to make these available! He also said that if France could not supply these weapons, the Pakistan Government had other offers and would be able to get them from Sweden, Belgium or the Netherlands. 2. The French Ministry of War had been quite ready to sell these weapons to Pakistan but the Quai D’Orsay felt it more prudent to intervene to stop this deal and had asked their iinbassy in London to enquire of us whether we agreed that this was the best course. (MET 3. I informed M. Le Roy that we much appreciated the courtesy of his Government in giving us these particulars and their wisdom in not encouraging this deal. We agreed, however, that the Pakistan Government must obviously not get to know that our two Governments had been in confabulation over the matter since it would obviously be most undesirable that Pakistan should suspect 3 ^** of blocking any initiatives she was choosing to take at the present moment. 4. I strongly suspect that General Messervy knows nothing of all this. He is on his way back to Karachi and I imagine that you will wish to telegraph these particulars to Sir L. Grafftey- Smith so that he can discuss them with Messervy and consider what, if anything, it is possible or appropriate for us to do in the matter. (R.H.S.
