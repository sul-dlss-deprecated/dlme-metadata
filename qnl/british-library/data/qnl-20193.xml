Date. &gt;5 CONFIDENTIAL RECORDS FO-r'IGN OF:-ICE, s. .1. 6th December, 1937. V/ith reference to Foreign Office letter E. 6944/53/93 of the 2nd December, enclosing a copy of a telegram addressed to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Bagdad, regarding the attempts vihich are from time to time made to bring cases in the Iraqi Courts against the title of the Shaikh of Kuwait to his date gardens in Iraq, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to request you to inform the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury that he has recently reviewed, in consultation with the Secretary of State for India, the whole question of the properties in Iraq of the Shaikh of Kuwait and the late Shaikh Khasal of Mohammerah. 2. As Their Lordships are aware, certain proposals for the final liquidation of this question were communicated to the Iraqi Government in a note from His Majesty s Charge d f Affaires at Bagdad on the 8th July, 1936, (see Foreign 1V&amp;C Office letter E.4766/18/93 of the 5th August, 1936) in which the following were the principal paragraphs: ”5. The problems involved concern ’(a) the possession of the actual areas in question; 'fa) taxation. ”6* As regards (b), the proposals of His ftejesty’s Government are the following. They are prepared to make no further claim against the Iraqi Government for the exemption of the properties of the two shaikhs from The Secretary to the Treasury. taxation/IS 11 taxation in Ira i» provided that the Ira^i Government will, 'Tor their part, M (a) give a formal undertaking in writing, to .lake no 'claim for arrears of taxation against either sheikh in 'respect of their properties in Iru^, 'and '(b) provide a formal written ass irance that no 'discriminatory taxation will he imposed upon the 'properties of either in future. '7* as regards (a) the possession asoect of the matter, 'His Majesty’s Government propose, as an integral art of ’comprehensive settlement* that all uncertainties should 'now be removed in regard to the boundaries of the sheikhs* lands in Ira^ and a formal title be awarded to them, 'through the application, to the areas in which the lands 'are situ?;ted, of tue procedure laid down in the Land 'settlement Law of tne 23rd May, lp32'. / St-tK , 3# As a corollary to these proposals, it was intended that as soon as they had been accepted by the Ira 1 Government and put into effect His Majesty*8 Government should compound their obligations to the two sheikhs under trie 1 jl4 pledge by making lump sura payments* either to thera or to their legal representatives, in return for tne final abandonment of all claims in respect of the possession or taxation of the ’e properties* It was also proposed that these payment ; should be e uivalent to: (i) tne losses which the estate of each sheikh ^as estimated to have incurred since 1^32 as a direct result of tuc * ra .i Iptilalan or reduce tax, together with, (ii) the losses which each estate might bv expected to incur in the future from the same cause, calculated at so many yearc (icrha q/(perhaps 23 years) purchase of the present average annual loss* I k» But it hi s unf ox*tunately proved iiapossi'ble, mainly owing to political difficulties between Ira, and Koweit, to nuuce any progress since July, 1936, towards securing the accc tance by the Ira J. aovernment of the proposals sc.t out in aragraph 2. These difficulties centre aro*und the vexed ueetiou of saug ling. The IracJL Government cont nd, not altogether without reason, that a groat deal of sjhu ogling takes place fro i Koweit, where customs duties are low or non-existent, into Ira * where customs duties are higher, and that the Ihcikh of Ko eit could stop this smuggling if he chose. Ihe roeuit is th^t, althoug . the Ira-^i Governiaent a em prepared to consider the 1336 proposals in themselves, they arc unwilling to do so while t;:e . ue Lion of srau piling is unsettled* ho strong in fact is their feeling that His Majesty^ Ambassador regards it as hopeles to {: ress the aestion unless the Ira i Governiaent can be given some degree of satisfaction or assurance on this e object. 5* The Sheikh of Koweit, wno is in his turn incensed over Various frontier incidents, is unwilling for hia art to ^:o further in the direction of satisfying or reassuring the Iraqi Government than to agree th .t, u^on t \c com letion of certain negotiations in wiilch he is now engaged with the Saudi Arabian Government for the termination by Gaud! Arabia of the Koweit blockade, he will be willing to disc .ss tne conclusion of an anti-smuggling agreement between Koweit and Iraq, although not necessarily on the lines of the anti-smuggling a re o merit which is expected to form part of his settlement with Gnudi Arabia. At the same time tiio iaudi rubian &gt;overruaent ma :e the conelueion of a Jaudi-koweit Trade agreement (i.e. the termination of the blockade) dependent u^&gt;on the simultaneous conclusion/conclusion of agrceiaents relating to frontier relations and extradition. j£very effort ia being made to bring the whole of these negotiations to a close as quickly as possible&gt; but a final settlement between Xoweit arid daudi rabia is still far off, while a settlement between Koweit and Iraq is not even in sight. 6. It might see a from this brief description of trie situation that the obstacles in the way of a final solution of the problem of the Sheihh of Kov/eit’s date gardens in Iraq are of the dheikh’a own making. ho to some extent they are. There is, however, another side to the picture. In the first place,although it is true that muen smuggling takes „&lt;lace from Koweit into Iraq, the smugglers themselves are practically all Iraqi subjects and the smuggling is largely financed by Ira A i merchants, while the Ira^i government have hitherto made no real attempt to establish an effective rventive service on the frontier, on the ground that, if the hici'di were a good neighbour, he would save them this expense* The have likewise failed to take certain ste ,s in Iraq itself which would tend to decrease the smuggling. In the second place, although the Sheikh could doubtless t a stop to smugglin if he wished, he could only do so as tilings are at present by greatly impoverishing his itate. This is the reason why he attaches so much importance to the prior conclusion of his agreements with daudi Arabia. Koweit depends for most of its prosperity on the entrepot trade. In normal times tnis trade iollo/s legitimate channels towards the interior of ae Arabian peninsula. At present it follows illegitimate channels towards Iraq. If it followed no channel at all Koweit would starve. The sheikh can therefore assert *ith some reason that, although he would refer on grounds of ethicsand x&gt;rofit alike to divert his trade into legitimate channels across the Saudi Arabian frontiert he cannot afford, while the blockade of that frontiercontinues, to stop it from taking whatever illegitimate channels may be available* 7, The Sheikh does not how ver regard himself as responsible in any way for what he regards as the natural result! of the continuance of the blockade. On the contrary, he considers that His Majesty’s Government are responsible, inasmuch as they undertook to do ti.eir best to secure the termination of the blockade, and have so far failed to doso. Here ag in, the •Sheikh’s own acts have on occasions rendered a settlement more difficult, but, after making all allowances for these acts, the fact remains that His Mnje -ty s vrovernflit nt have failed to make good their undertaking to end tne blockade in the same way as they have, in the Sheikh’s ayes,flailed, i or whatever reason, to secure the exam, tion of uis date gardens in Irac from taxation or from the threat of alienation* 8# In these circumstances the Iccretary of State for India, after consultation with the Political Resident in the lersian Gulf, considers it most desirable from the point of view o± tne Gulf, considers it most desirable from the oini of view oi trie general position and prestige of His Majesty’s Government in the Persian Gulf to make it clear to the 3heikh that His Majesty’s Government are willing to honour their obligations in regard to the date gardens in so far as is at present ossible for them to do so* Mir. :den agrees with Lord Zetland in thinking it desirable that steps sha.l be taaea to remove as far as possible the Sheikh of howeit’s grievance in regard to the 1914 pledge* 9* At the same time Mr. Eden is anxious that the position of the heirs of the late Sheikh Khaaui of Moha iaerah shall be taken into consideration. His Majesty’s Government have already agreed that the heirs shall be treat d collectively for/for the purpose b of the 1914 pledge not less favourably than Sheiich Khazal himself would have been. Neither the Sheikh nor his heirs are responsible for the difficulties which have so greatly complicated a comprehensive settlement with the Irac;i (rovernment, and it would be inequitable and would create an unfortunate impression if any settlement of their claims that was otherwise possible were to be delayed by political dissension between K.oweit and Iracq, all tee more as the heirs are for the most part heavily in debt and in urgent need of any funds that they can obtain. Moreover there are signs that, unless a settlement is soon forthcoming, retv are will be brought to bear on their behalf in Parliament* 10. It is true that a complication has arise i in the case of the heirs through the fact that, according to recent information furnished by the administrator of the estates of the late 3haikh Khazal in Ira, it is not possible for the heirs to fulfil the condition indicated in Lord Cranborne's personal and confidential letter to air Arnold L on of the 17th npril (of . ich a co^v was sent to trie Treasury with Foreign Office letter S 1874/53/93 of the 22nd April) as attaching to the undertaking of His Majesty * s Government to treat them no Leepj favourably than Sheikh Khas&amp;l himself, i.e. that they should form some kind of joint family trust under an administrator with whom His Majesty's government could deal direct. The fact that many of the heirs are in debt for considerable sums to private individuals, some of whom have alread obtained attachments from the lo al courts against the shares of the debtors in the Lovable and immovable property left by their fat .er, alone renders t iis impossibl - On thi other hand the administrator ossesses powers of attorney from all but two of the heirs, empowcring him to ..et generally on their behalf, and there does not seem to be any reason why.2-3 if His i^lajesty’s Oovernment were to negotiate the details of a lump sura settlement ^ith the administrator, the adainisirator should not furnish His Majesty’s Oovemaent &gt;vith valid discluirges from or on hehulf of all the heirs* His iiajesty’s Government might indeed make it a condition that to share in the compensation all the heirs should unite in giving the administrator a special general pov/er of attorney* The fact that the heirs cannot form a f..rally trust n ed not therefore preclude the liquidation of the taxation claims by a lump sun payment. 11. In order, therefore, to implement the 1914 pledges in the largest measure at resent possible Ir. Eden and Lord Zetland consider that His Majesty’s Government should now abandon the attempt to reach a comprehensive settlement of the 'possession” and 'taxation” aspects of the date gardens question, and revert to the earlier suggestion of attempting to settle the 'taxation' aspect separately from, and in advance of, the 'possession’* aspect* This would mean that His Majesty’s Government would agree in principle to maue lump sun payments both to the Shaikh of Koweit and to the heirs of the .heiich of Mobammerah in settlement of losses on their Iraqi estates caused since 1932 by the incidence of t. Iutlhiak tax, and of future losses due to the same cause or (since His mjesty’s Government ought clearly to cover t is possibility) to any other tax imposed (without discrimination) on agricultural lands in Iraq which may later replace or supplement the Istihlak tax. A he somewhat complicated exuestions of detail connected - in both cases - with the calcul tion of t. e amounts of compensation to be ^ald and - in the case of the Hdhammerah heirs - of the procedure for effecting payment can best be left f &gt;r later consideration when His Majesty’s Government have ta :en a deeisim of principle, but a rough indication of the procedure that might be followed for/Xlf [ for asaessing the amount of com, ensatton and of the possible coat of compensation is given in aragra, h 16 below. In any case, in return for receiving lump oum paymentst the Sheik! if Xowe it and the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohammerah would be required to give a written acknowledgment of the fact that this ijayment ^leased His Maje&amp;ty t a Oovemment from their obligations under the Ijlk pledge in respect of the losses suffered since 1932 by the im, osition of the Is tlhla* tax and in respect of all future losses from that tax or any other ordinary Iraqi tax on agricultural production, more or less on the following lines: W I »..••••••• do hereby ac avowledge the reel t of the sum »of £ •••««•••• paid to me on behalf of His Majesty’s f, dovernment in tae United Kingdom and I recognise this payment M as a full discharge, binding on me and my heirs and successors •’equally, of the liability of that Government, under the 'pledge given to dhelto ^ bar ' u : f : ^:AAL- m 1914, to Khazal of Moharameruh ’♦compensate me for the loss I have suffered since 1932, or M may suffer in the future, by reason of the I tlhla^ or any ’’other tax hereafter levied on landed property or agricultural ’♦production, in respect of the lands which I hold in Ira* as M a descendant of Sheikh Khazal. 12. It will be observed that the proposed course of action would not amount to a com lete settlement of tee ’’taxation' aspect, since His Majesty’s Government would not be formally absolved of any liability under the 1914 pledges in respect of pre-1932 arrears of taxation if these should be nr- iii .iifn i»n mw .iml r-i—ntfir.ww i imTin———wWCW^TMi.f Hi i i - '**'*••* *^» claimed by the Iraqi Governraent and of any possible future discriminatory tax^it,.on. Aftef’ full consideration u*. hden nd Lord Zetland iiave arrived at ttie conclusio « t.uit it .aid not be practicable or desirable to try to obtain from either oi the parties a formal discharge of responsibility in respect of these two contingent ris^o. au attempt to do so would introduce into the proposed action a serious complication and cause of delay. The parties mast be aware taut in the absence of any com .rehensive/14./ a y'f | Qoin £ &gt;rehenslve settlement ith the Ira t i Govemaent they run a certain risk of further financial loss in the future on these two grounds* and they //ould certainly not agree to give a discharge in respect of contingent risks covered by the 1914 pledge in return for nothing, or at the most a sim le promise of diplomatic support if the contingencies sab &gt;e % uently arose* If ia iajesty’s Government were resolved to secure a discharge fron further claims on account of these contingencies, it would be necessary to pay additional compensation, and even if agreement could be i reached at all as to the proper additional sum it w uld only be after controversy which would undo much of the good political effect to be hoped for from the payment of compensation for the losses caused by the latlklu : tux. Furtnermore, it would be hard to justify the considerable extra expense which would be caused to His Majesty's Government in the absence of any i mediate risk of either contingency materialising. Finally, the fact that His Majesty's Government were trying to compound financially with the parties in respect of these hypothetical risks for tue future would certainly become known to the Ira^i Government and might well merely have the effect of encouraging that Government to take some action such as reviving the dormant claim for the former land tax on the 3 he itch's estates revious to 1932, which they were prevented fro . levying at the time by t ie British mandatory authorities. 13. It seems clear, therefore, that the best policy would be to aim at present at a limited objective, and t be content with an incomplete settlement only of the 'taxation” aspect, rather than to raise dormant or hypothetical risks. jxny suitable occasion that might aria;, would, however, be taken to try to extract from the Ira^i Govemme it the formal assurances not to claim tax arrears or levy discriminatory taxation w ich were included in the 1936 proposals for a comprehensive settlement (see paragraph 2 abov^).24 14* Nevertheleaet it will be convenient to reach agreement ae to the line of action which should be taken by His Majesty's Governra nt in tne eveiit of any loss falling at any future ti le on the Sheikh of Koweit or the heirs of the Sheikh of Mohaiaraerah on account either of a clain for arrears of taxation or of the levyin ; of a discriminatory tax. Sr. iiiden and Lord Zetland ai*e ;Usposed to think thixtt in trie light of present circumstances, any such development should be met by diplomatic representations, and that his Majesty's Oovernment ought only to contemplate compounding financially for ; ny loss or prospectivefioDs if and when it was entirely clear tuat diplomatic action was not sufficient to obtain redress. In this event it would be open to His Majesty's Oovernment to consider whether t-iCy should endeavour by arbitration to recover from the Ira i Government what they had alread paid to the iheikhs or their heirs. (The Law Officers have advised tnat His Majesty's Government have legally a good ca e)• Account would in any case have to bo taken, before any decision pas reached to pay compensation, of (a) the fact that, as mentioned above, the Sheikh of howeit himself must he considered as partly responsible for the failure to reach a comprehensive settlement with the Ira ,i Government; and (b) the eculiar situation caused b tne multipliedt of heir: to tne ihoi h of Mohammerah, their indebtedness to outside persons, and the impossibility of Hia Ifcijesty 1 ^ Government retaining indefinitely a divided liability under the IfIn pledge or of allowing tne benefits of the pledge to extend to persona outside 3hei ;h Kha/.al's family (see in t is connexion paragra^. 1 j above). Meanwhile, in the event either of the bhelkh of Koweit or of the heirs of the ihei h of Moh,, me rah en .airing as to the attitude His M jeety’s Government would adopt if one or both of/to • • * 7 * of the contingent riaks materialised* :,&amp;*• i£den considerB that the reply should simply be that* while in general His Majesty's Government intend to fulfit to the best of their ability the obligations they assumed in the 1914 pledges* they cannot fore tail the courage they would talce in such a particular eventuality and see no reason to anticipate the risks in cpiesti on# 15# Under the proposed course of action tiie 'possession' aspect would also remain* and the only hope of settling it finally appears at present to lie in keeping up pressure on the Iraqi Government to apply their land settlement procedure# The title to the Iraqi estates of the Sheikh of Johanuaerah has not hitherto been challenged, but* as Their Lordships are aware, attempts are continually being made to dispossess the Sheikh of Koweit. The legal liability of His Majesty's Government towards the Sheikhs (which the Law Officers have recognised) either to ensure that their possession of the date gardens is undisturbed or to compensate them for their elienation must be satisfied sometime, but this point must be left as it is for the moment until negotiations can be renewed with the Iraqi Government. 16• It has already been mentioned that jp. Lden and Lord Zetland consider that the actual assessment of the sums to be offered in compensation and the various questions of detail concerned with the distribution of the money can best be left until His Majesty's Government have taken the required decision of principle# For the general information of Their Lordships it may be convenient* however* to record that according to figures submitted by the Jiheikh of Koweit which a pear reasonably exact the average annual loss suffered by him over the six years 1932-7 through the imposition of the Istihlak tax amounts (excluding certain alleged indirect losses which do not appearto be covered by the scope of the 1914 pledges) to about £lt100* In the course of interdepartmental discussion on this point in the past it has been suggested that a fair procedure would be to refund the actual proved losses since 1932 and to compensate for estimated future losses by paying a lump sum representing so many years 'purchase” of the current annual loss. Alternatively* it may be better and less likely to involve bargaining and disputes to offer a single lump sum representing an increased number of years 'purchase”. Mr. iSden understands that to j^roduce an annuity of £1*000 for 25 years a sum of £ 16 * 00 ) would be required* allowing for interest at ik% on outstanding capital. It seems likely, therefore, that a sum of some £25*000 to £30*000 would be a fair settlement with the Sheikh of Koweit. The position in regard to the losses suffered by the estates of Sheikh Khazal is more obscure* since the figures supplied by the administrator seem prima facie much exaggerated* inasmuch as they exceed those supplied by the Sheikh of Koweit for his estates, although the date gardens owned by Sheikh Khaaal are understood to be regarded by the authorities in Ira^ as having only half the bearing capacity of those owned by the Sheikh of Koweit. Further investigation is therefore likely to be indispensable before any estimate can be made of the amount of fair compensation to the heirs of Sheikh Khazal. 17. Their Lordships will have observed that 24r. isden and Lord Zetland consider that the compensation of the two parties for their tax losses on the lines proposed above should* in vie\* of the evident impossibility of arranging an early comprehensive settlement* now be carried out irrespective ^f the position obtaining between His Majesty's Government and the Iraqi Government. The legal position between the two .rovernnients must* however* be considered. The principal argument hitherto used against the compensation of the Sheikha by His Majesty s Goverument/HOMMMPRm Government in the absence of an anderatanding with the Ira^i Governraent haa been that this would* by constituting an adaission that His .Jajeety’a Government were bound to compensate the Gheikhs or their heirs if the Iraqi Governiaent did not do so, weaken their basis for contending that the Iraqi Government had inherited the 1914 pledges, and so deprive Hia 'ia^e8ty , 8 Government of almost the only s apon available to them for pressing the Iraqi Government to agree to give the desired guarantees (a) against the presentation of pre-193? claims and future discriminatory taxation and (b) for the preservation intact 01 the existing properties* Actually, however, if the fact that His Majesty’s Government have compensated the &gt;heikhs or their heirs, or have embarked upon negotiations to this end, becomes ;aiown to the Iraqi Government before His Majesty’s Government have succeeded in effecting a settlement with the Iraqi Government on the lines indicated in paragraph 2 of this letter, the position will simply be that, instead of offering as a part of that settlement to refrain from marling *any farther claim against the Ira^i Government for the exemption of the properties of the two Gheikhs in Iraq”, His llajeoty’s Government will be offering to refrain from making a claim (which they would ma .e otherwise) for the repayment to themselves of the sums paid or about to be paid by them to the Gheikhs or their heirs. By compensating the Sheikhs or their heirs His Majesty's Governraont would in fact be taking up trie position that there was an obligation on the part of the Ira,1 Government to .v .ras the n which, ii the Iraqi Government failed to make it good of their own accord. His Majesty's Government were entitled and bound to make good and to reclaim from the Ira ,i Government whether the Iraqi Government really believe that His Majesty f 8 Government could in any case force them to recognise the 191 p pledges/■■ —; 2&gt;'/3G /SV- pledges may be open to doubt» but* as the despatch to Hie Majesty* a Representative at Bag ad enclosed in my letter £ 5224/53/93 of the 30th September indicated, His Majesty*s Government must not let the Iraqi Government suppose that they would not if necessary press them strongly to do 00 , even to the extent of arbitration* There is anyhow no reason to suppose that the direct compensation of the heirs would make them any less ready to believe it* On the contrary the formulation of aprecise claim for a definite sum of money might render them more ready to do so, or at any rate more anxious to effect a compromise. For these reasons ;.ir* £den considers that the compensation of the Sheikha or their heirs in respect of tax losses on the lines proposed would not weaken the position of His, Majesty*s Government vls-a-vls the Iraqi Government* 18* Mr* Eden will be grateful to receive at an early date the observations of Their Lordships on this letter and in particular to learn whether they concur in principle in the course of action proposed in paragraphs 11 - 15 above, on the understanding that the detailed points of finance and procedure alluded to in paragraphs 10 and 16 above shall form the subject of subsequent discussion between the three interested departments of His Majesty’s Government* A copy of this letter is being sent to the India Office.

As you will infer, the Iraqi Government have now permitted a case to be brought against the Sheikh which may lead to his being dispossessed of some cf his date-gardens. This f' they have done by issuing new regulations which permit of the service of writs on the Oheikh’s agent in the absence of the ,/ Oheikh himself. ( # 2. As His ajesty's Government are interested in ensuring that the Sheikh shall lose as little ef his ±914 property as possible, (since they would have to compensate him for any part which he lost) it is felt - and was in fact decided in 1926 - that he should be given expert legal assistance. But it may be impossib-Le to find an impartial lawyer in Iraq, and in that case we may have to ask you whether it is possible to obtain the services of a suitable lawyer in -gypt. The lawyer should have a good knovvledge of Arabic, and be acquainted with the tit omen Land Law. Yi/ith these qualifications he ought not to have too much difficulty ixi mastering the statutory additions made to the Ottoman Code by Iraqi Legislation. 4. We understand that the case is to be opened in the Basra courts on the 5th January, and we should accordingly be grateful if you would have a preliminary look round to see whether a suitable lawyer could be found in Egypt in the event cf Clark Kerr reporting that a reliable and impartial man cannot be round in Iraq. 5./5. But although it io desirable that the lawyer from Egypt, if it is decided to engage one, should be in Basra before January 5th, it is not absolutely essential, since the bheikh has already been asited to engage a local lawyer to plead the preliminary point that the regulations allowing vicarious service are invalid. If this preliminary point is over-ruled it -vill be necessary to defend the case on its merits, but the hearing 03? the substantive part of the case might not come oif for some time after January 5th.

In continuation of my telegram No.2 of 7th January, 1938, I have to say that Sheikh’s lawyer is also of the opinion that the Sheikh’s case against the Zuhair heirs is weak in law, unless the Dobbs registration can be held authorized (there are numerous references to this point on files), and therefore, if the Iraq Government contemplate revising their laws to permit the service of documents, on the attorney of the Sheikh he thinks that, arbitration would be preferable. 2 . The Zuhair lawyer, Salman ash Shawwaf, who, it is common knowledge, has improperly acquired rights in debt over his ward, the mad son of the late Abdulla Zuhair, has already indirectly approached the Sheikh - - who will take no action, unless advised - , for a settlement out of court on behalf of the heirs. 3 , There are only three heirs concerned, Najiba and Aida, daughters of Ahmed Pasha, and the son of the X. late Abdulla az Zuhair, who was the son o^ Aisha sister of Ahmed Pasha. Abdulla, a dipsomaniac, every one concerned tells me, signed a bill for about £.5000/-, and his ’’rights' in the ^uhair case, in favour of Salman ash Shawwaf - in return for being kept in funds for the remainder of his life; which soon ended in delirium tremens. The debt and these rights Shawwaf The Hon’ble Lt-Colonel Sir Trenchard Powle,K.C.I.S.,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf-2- S 6 CU holds transferred to him, and anyway Abdulla’s son is mad &lt;A and^his ward, iilncouraged by oalman ash Shawwaf, the Iraq Government may introduce a new law especially designed to permit the legal service of documents on the Sheikh’s lawyer. 4. The Dobbs point is arguable, may even now be coverable by a retrospective authorization, and the Sheikh’s case, I believe, otherwise good. The best course therefore still seems to me to obtain now a distinguished lawyer from BgyP'tf to become au Fait with the case, and to advise the Sheikh’s lawyer in the preparation of it. Incidentally his mere presence may, and probably, will, deter the third-rate Zuhair lawyer. He could then return to Hgypt and await developments. 5. Abdul Jalil Partu seems a good man and, given this backing, should do well in protecting the Sheikh!’s interests in and out of court. 6. Now, in my opinion is the time to show that ?? we mean business’’ by the employment of an outside lawyer, without him, I fear we may see the case aescending into a dark and long drawn out intrigue by Iraqi lawyers. 7. I should and that I believe that this service of -A documents upon the Sheikh’s lawyer is authorized, the writ of execution in the Bashiya case, which it will be remembered went against the Sheikh on appeal (See-my No.tj- cyf ) , could be served, and judgement executed, without further referenceV * Confidential * No.C- n BUS H1RE RESIDENCY.

Abdul Jalil Partu is a close relation of Nuri Pasha as Said, and the latter is even now staying with Partu*s family in Beirut. Nuri, Partu told me, left Iraq hurriedly, not, as the newspapers say, for reasons of health, or/and high politics, but because his very successful reception in Basra recently, frightened the present Cabinet and Nuri thought it healthier to leave. 4 . Abdul Jalil Partu moved to Basra from Bagdad I believe to avoid political complications, ana he is inevitably suspected of being a 'Nuri man', is not likely to fight strongly unless he has outside backing, a case which will inevitably have sane'national' and 'political' side to it. 5# on the other hand Salman Sheikh Daoud and his father have always been in the thick of Bagdad politics and both have been^and may still be, member^*of Parliament. X agree with the Ambassador that one is reluctant to guarantee the integrity of any Iraqi lawyer.

I should be glad to receive your observations on the point raised. The issue of the above has been duly authorised.!f 4 P.Z.443/38. FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.l. (E. 277/28/93). 20th January, 1938. Dear Gibson, \ Will you please refer to Bagdad telegram No.6 of the 13th January about the Sheikh of Koweit 1 s date gardens (see our letter E. 277/28/93 of the 14th January). 2. We are not quite clear what Mr. Drower, the Adviser to the Ministry of Justice, meant when he told the Embassy (of. paragraph 2) that the Sheikh 'is not the only person concerned'. Admittedly, one might, under Ottoman law, have expected the interest in Sheikh Mubarak's properties to be inherited in common after his death by all his heirs, as happened on the death of Sheikh Khazal of Mohammerah. That is what Mr. Drower seems to be getting at, and if this is what indeed happened the part owners of what we usually call the Sheikh of Koweit's date gardens may no doubt by now have become legion. 3. In fact, however, (although we have heard before that other members of the Sheikhly family have property in Iraq and have for instance told them that they cannot claim immunity from service in the s ame way as the Sheikh himself) we have always assumed here that the Sheixh is the sole owner of the properties covered by the 1914 pledge. It is, for instance, as you will remember, proposed, if and when His Majesty's Government give compensation for the amount paid in Istihlak tax since 1932 in respect of the g ardens covered by that pledge, to pay the whole money to the Sheikh and obtain a discharge from him and him alone. At any rate nobody seems ever to have given any thought to any other proceeding. Gibson, Esq. Perhaps/2. Perhaps some special arrangement applies in this particular case, by which the property is handed down intact irom one ruling Sheikh to the next? We should be gratexul for any light you can throw on the matter, 4. The point is of some practical interest, since (1) no privilege in respect of service of documents ^ . can be claimed by any member of the family except the ruling Sheikh, and it would hardly seem that his privilege would be effective to cover properties of which he is only a part owner, (2) it is a question whether our pledge extends to „ gardens owned by persons other than the Ruling © Sheikh for the time being, when there still is a Ruling Sheikh. Yours ever, (Sgd.) Lacy Baggallay.Confidential Political Agency, Kuwait. 1 ! h-/ , f stjii- No.C- M t&gt; I BU» JCY.

I have arranged for all the relevant documents, and Partu’s case notes to be translated. They should be ready in about twenty days, and available for a lawyer from Egypt, if one is employed. 2 . Judge Lloyd informed me that the two judges associated with him are hand in glove with Salman Shawwaf, the Zuhair lawyer. He gave me some lurid details - which were really almost incredible, however hardened one is to such tales. Abdul Jalil Partu, the Sheikh’s lawyer volunteered the same kind of information. Lloyd added the astonishing detail that his two judges had told him that they proposed to visit Kuwait shortly. Lloyd had said to them that if they did they could only stay with the Sheikh and they had replied that this was so, - and why. ( I am warning the Sheikh who will no doubt put.them off.) 4. Shawwaf, the Zuhair lawyer is still angling for settlement, by money payment to him out of court, and as he is hopelessly entangled, will I expect, if settlement cannot be pulled off, try bribing Partu, or any other Iraqi lawyer for the Sheikh, to lose the case. I tried to get some forecast from Lloyd as to the course which the case might take i.e. on and ax ter the 23rd March. The Hon’ble Lt- Colonel Sir Trenchard Eowle, K.C.I.E., C.-b.d*., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.His answer naturally was a guarded one, but he said that he thought that it might be argued for a day or two, and then postponed for a map of the estate to be made by the Tapu Department, at the plaintiff's expense, which would take some six weeks. This would bring resumption of the case very . near the beginning of the Iraqi Long Vacation, in Mid June, - so that the case might in the end drag on for about seven months• 6. On the other hand he thought a good defence might show that the plaintiff's case was very ill-founded and the motive merely 'blackmail'.( I quote his word}, so that it could be dismissed in a few hours. 7 . Considering what I have recorded in these two immediately preceding paragraphs, the nature of the case, and its locale, and the fact that a British or European lawyer, if employed, could not, from a professional relish of pleading, be led into prolonging the case, I feel sure that only such a lawyer can be relied upon as being anxious to terminate it rapidly and successfully for the Sheikh, and for His Britannic Majesty's Government.mam5*s GOVERNMENT OF INDIA. ^Department.

The garden property of Sheikh Mubarak now in question descended to his male heirs - see attached lists and is therefore registered in the Tapu Department records of Iraq as 'to the male heirs of Sheikh Mubarak', 2. In accordance, however, with a custom by no means rare, one member of the family, Sheikh Ahmad in this case, continues to administer the estate. Sheikh .ohmad issues an annual allowance fixed by him (not a distribution up to the limit which the net profit would make possible) to his coheirs in appropriate proportions. He does so without it being; _a recognized private ,/aqf, and without any power of attorney or written permission from his coheirs. By him are paid all expenses, wages .etcetera, and by him are a.n received all increments, and/neither case is previous consent of his coheirs required. They may, and do, for example after the shipping away of the harvest, query the amount they are receiving annually and in fact hold the head of the family responsible to them. 3 . Briefly therefore the coheirs have given one of their member, oheikh Ahmad, the head of their family, full fiscal responsibility, in accordance with a well known custom, in the administration of the late Sheikh Mubarak’s gardens. The attached list gives correctly the names of Sheikh Mubarak’s male heirs and their inheritors living dn 1st February, 1938 The Lt-Colonel, Sir Trenchard Fowle, K.C.I.E.,0.B.E., Political Resident, Persian Gulf.f 2 - (You will notice that the public notice in lieu of service of suromons, which was recently published at the instance of the Zuhair lawyer, and a copy of which I sent to you under Printed Letter No.U-49 of 2nd February, is incorrect in that it omi^s the names of «n.li bin Sheikh Salim AlrSubah, Maryam, Hussah, &lt;«.isha, Subeekah, daughters of Sheikh Salim Subah and Hussah, wife of oheikh Nasir Al- Subah^and Loolwah and oharifa, daughters of Sheikh i^asir Al-Subah.). 5. ^a) Two points should perhaps be made quite clear. Firstly that the Feadaghiya estate, the estate now in question, was registered by Sheikh Mubarak in the names of his male heirs, and to them and to their heirs it has in fact descended. The daughters of Mubarak, and their descendenti s do not receive a share as they might have expected under the Moslem law of inheritance, which share they do receive in the case of other gardens covered by our 1914 promise, for which Sheikh Ahmad is also the administrator. The explanantion according to the surviving male heirs of Mubarak, and their descendents, is that the Feddaghiya garden was itself the Thulth U1 Mait or the third of •property disposable by testament under Moslem Law. (b) A second point is that the duty of acminis-cration M || — ihiwh-b-mm was previously in the hands of two former Rulers of Kuwait, in their order of succession i.e. Sheikh Jabir and then Sheikh Salim, from whom it devolved upon Sheikh iihmad and that neither of these two former administrators had powers of attorney or written authority to administer the estates, given to them by their coheirs. The India Office letter under reference raises three points:- (a) From whom should His Majesty f s Government obtain-3- (b) The question of privilege in respect of service of documents, (c) whether our pledge extends to gardens owned by- persons other than the Buling 5heikh for the time being, when there still is a Buling bheikh. other than the Ruler. d) ’ Our pledge must extend to other persons so long as they are 'descendants' of Sheikh Mubarak, which all the present owners are. that payment can and should be made to the Ruler of Kuwait, administrator of the estate, and a discharge obtained from him. As payments of all kind in connection with the estates have so far been made to him I see nothing against it. If it is considered essential, in order to cover His Majesty’s G-overnment , his general discharge to us could include signed acknowledgements by all the other heirs that the payment to Sheikh Ahmad had discharged the obligation, but I do not think that we should go farther than this, as, for example, attempting a direct settlement with each heir, altering a state of affairs in which the descendants of Mubarak have acquiesced for over twenty years; during the period of Rulership of three Sheikhs of Kuwait. The answer to (b) and (c) seems, subject to your opinion, to be clear. ( 3 &gt; ? XT Privilege cannot be held to extend to anyone With regard to (a) 1 trust that it will be decidedCONFIDENTIAL.

My uear Baggallay, ^&lt;4^ With reference to my telegrai Mo. 12 of January 27th, I am sending you herewith a copy of a note on the case of the service of documents on the agent of the Sha Uch of Kuwait which Brickell obtained privately from Lloyd (the British Judge at Basra). The Shaikh’s telegram seems to have been a most unfortunate blunder. Yours ever, (ogoj James Morgan. H L. BAOG/iLLaY ,application for a date to be fixed for hearing the action againat the Shaikh of Kuwait was made aoae months ago by the attorney for the plaintiff. A date was fixed and the Ministry of Justice replied to the Court’s application to serve the summons on the Shaikh of Kuwait that it was not possible, attorney for the plaintiff then declared in Court that Abdul Jalil farto held a General lower of iittorney from the Shaikh of Kuwait and that he should be served and that if his power aiu not include the right to accept service then the Shaikh of Kuwait should be served either through the British Consul, Basra (as the Shaikh of Kuwait was a British subject) or by notice in the rress. The Court held that neither of these latter alternatives was possible under the law because service through Consul only applied in the case of foreigners resident within the jurisdiction of the Court and that service by proclamation and notice in the fress could only be allowed when the where abouts oi the Shaikh were unknown whereas in fact his place of residence was known. The Court however decided to serve his attorney Abdul Jalil iarto. Th^s did not mean that the Court had decided in advance that they would compel Abdul Jalil to accept service. It was complying with the request of the plaintiff to attempt service on the attorney who could of course refuse to accept such service if not empowered. When the Bailiff attempted to serve Abdul Jalil the latter refused and the Bailiff in accordance with article 28 of the Civil Procedure Code served the summons in the presence of 2 witnesses. This aid not mean that the Ghaikh was effectively served. -bdul ualil could have appeared in Co^rt ana said tat his power of attorney did not permit him to accept service. The Court after confirming this statement by examining the Power of Attorney would in law be obliged to admit that the service was not gooa and the old otalemate would recur. But in this case the Ghaikh sent a telegram direct to the President of the Court stating that he had cancelled the — , , nmr — -— *** power/power of attorney given to Abdul Jalil. Whan the Court T' ***' 1 ' 1 t a ... ■vmat .— re-aeeembled thie wae discussed. Uy Iraqi colleagues held that this telegram was proof of service. But in the end the Court adjourned its decision for a week. During this week I happened to be in Baghdad and privately discussed the point with Drower to see if there was any legal objection to the view that by sending the telegram at that particular moment the Bhaikh had shown that he was aware that an action was being brought against him on a particular date which constitutes service. Mr. Drower agreed with me and I understand informed Captain Holt privately of this. On my return to Basrah the Court re-aeeembled and ■ . ■ .V. •. .. V.-•.• v/e held that the Shaikh had been served and ordered the case to be proceeded with against him in absentio. With regard to his partners in the estate who are co-defendants the Court found that their place of residence wae unknown and that they should be served by notice in the press.

FOREIGNN» (176/3/38) Ain MaIL. 9th March, 1938• My dear dnggallay, ♦ I am writing in haste to tell you of the latest developments in the affair of the properties of the haikh vV of Ko*eit in Iraq. Towards the middle of February, ope of tile senior officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs asked Holt to go to see him to discuss .^attraan^ Note Ho* 347 of July 8th, 1936, in which, as you will remember, it was proposed that Land Settlement procedure should be employed to dispose of disputes concerning the Shaikh of Koweit’a garden in Iraq. Holt’s talks in the Ministry led to the production of a draft repl^ to iatemar/s note, a copy of which enclose herein. Holt was told that this was only a departmental draft and that before they put it up to the Council of Ministers the Ministry would like to know privately whether it was likely to be acceptable to His iajesty’s Government. Holt pointed out that it would not be possible for the Hrabaeay to recommend His Majesty’s Government to agree to paragraph 5 of the draft. This paragraph leaves it in doubt whether the Shaikh would be given deeds for land awarded to him by the Settlement Officer, if such land was not ’muIk* A (freehold). That is to **y if it was ’alienated land or what in Arabic is called ’ mlrl mufawwaz * and in the Settlement ])~j, 4 * | Law ’ mlrl land granted in Tapu ’ (i£nglish version Article 3 - IV). Holt’s view was that the reservHtion contained in the second part of this paragraph might result in title deeds being refused to the Shaikh, on the grounds that he was a foreigner a. . j ALLAY, S8Q.foreigner, for a great deal of his properties even though his claim to them was recognised by the Settlement Officer, and Aston (one of the Settlement Officers who had been consulted closely by iateman when his note was prepared; confirmed this view* rest of the draft looked good, we could not accept paragra h 5, and they were asked to try to redraft it. and the letter sent off to you for comments well in time for a decision to be reached and Settlement declared before the Faddaghiyah case comes before the courts at Basra on kiarch 83rd, but this hope is now fading* holt has been bothering the Ministry, but although a fairly satisfactory new draft of paragraph 5 is now, he thinks, being studied in the Ministry of Justice, the process is slow* Affairs and urged him to get the thing settled in time to stop the case coming on in Basra, and he said he would do his | beat* In the meanwhile, perhaps Fowl©*s effort to obtain ( a postponement n»y succeed. However, it looks as though there may have to be some heavy telegraphing in a few days* time, so i am te nding you the draft now in order that you may know what is being done Apart from paragraph 5, it seems to be good enough, and I am enclosing a short note commending o: i by There is, however, a further difficulty* A new Land Settlement Law which is to supersede Law No. 50 of 1932 is now before Parliament and has already passed its third reading in The Ministry were therefore told that,although the Vie had hoped at first to be able to get this done Yesterday morning, 1 spoke to the Minister for Foreign paragraph.- 3 - the Chamber of Deputies* ho authentic text has yet been published, but *e have an Arabic text published in the press. This shows that, except for Articles 10, 11 and 30, the amendments made are textual, and involve no change in the meaning or purpose of the law* I enclose a translation of Article 10* in the opinion of Aston (the Land Settlement Officer) in its new form this article would, in application, work no less favourably for the Shaikh of Koweit than the old article* article 11 which deals with the grant of Lazraa rights has been extensively redrafted in so far as it concerns the acquisition of title by pump owner© and it contains a new r and essential provision that Lazma rights shall only be granted to Iraqis* It seems, however, that it was never expected that the Shaikh of Koweit could gain any advantages under this article and the restriction of the grant of Lazma rights to Iraqis should not, therefore, react unfavourably on the Shaikh’s position. Article 32 has been recast without change of meaning* I enclose a translation. It seems, therefore, that the new law does not change the basis on which the original proposals contained in the ?*at' man note were drawn up* I am sending a copy of this letterto Fo»le at sushi re and Je Oaury at iioweit.

Batemn* e liote lio,547 of July 8th, 1936, addressed to the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Al dayid hurl A1 Said, have now received the careful consideration of the Irac^i Governmento 2« The Iraqi Government are disposed to accept these proposals, subject to the following:- 3. With regard to sub-paragraph (a) of paragraph 6 of Mr# Bateman’s hote, legislation must be passed before the undertaking can be given. The Iraqi Government are prepared to propose such legislation and, on its coming into force, to give the undertaking requested. 4. With regard to sub-paragraph (b) of paragraph 6, the British Government may rest assured that the Iraqi Government have no intention of imposing discriminatory taxation on trie property of any person in Iraq. Further more, the British Government mast be aware that such taxation would be in conflict with the provisions of the Iraqi Constitution. The Iraqi Government do not, therefore, oonsider it proper or necessary for any further assurance to be given by them in this connection. 6.

Tev/fik Doss Pasha is a Copt, and apparently a most able lawyer. The most recent Personalities Report (of which I send you an extract) talks of his 'tortuous methods' and 'strong suspicions of corruption', but if he gets a fee of the proportions recommended in this telegram it will not be worth his while to attempt to doublecross the Sheikh (and in fact almost impossible for him to do so, as he will only be giving advice out of court), especially as he has been made av/are of the interest taken by His Majesty's Government in the case. In any case, the Embassy must have had good reasons for choosing him and it is too late to question their choice now, unless you think the fee too high. 4 # you may prefer that if possible the question of the Pasha's fees should be settled before he leaves for Kbweit,and I should therefore be glad to learn your views as soon as possible. I do not think the fee can be cut down much. It might be possible to suggest that the £40 per diem commenced only after the first five days. 5 # i a m sending a copy of this letter to Gibson at the India Office. D. J.Wardley Esq.,MC., Treasury.

It has however been necessary to state to Doss Pasha, in order to obtain his service, that it was a matter of considerable importance and interest to His Majesty’s Government.

Brought up as a iresbyterian, but has latterly verted, and plays a reactionary (and allegedly lucrative) role in Coptic Church affairs. Was once a dragoman in the American consular agency at Assiout. 'Well educated (American Mission) ,with an excellent knowledge of English and French; possesses marked ability as a speaker. He made a big reputation for himself defending political prisoners under martial law in the early days of the Independence movement - among others, Abdurrahman Fahmy Bey in the ’’Vengeance Society 1 trial. Left Zaghlul and became a leading member of the Constitutional Liberal party. Minister of agriculture ^n Ziwer Pasha’s Cabinet, March-September 1925, when he fell under nalace influence and made desperate attempts to retain office in September 1925, but could not quite manage it. However, he sent in a conditional resignation from the Liberal party, and for some months he ceased to attend party meetings. Stood for the Beni Korra constituency (Assiout) against Ahmed Khashaba pasha (Wafdist) in the elections of May 1926. Thanks to strong Ittehadist backing and interference of the Ziwer Government on his side, he was elected Deputy, out resigned when about to be unseated by the Chamber on the charge (justifiable) of electoral irregularities. From 1927 on Tewfik Doss’s connexion with the palace has become much closer. He played a prominent part in supporting the candidature of the present corrupt Coptic Patriarch against the reformers, and he was in league with His late Majesty and the Patriarch in certain obscure financial misappropriations of Coptic Waqfs. He/He was much against the appointment of Mohammed Mahmoud Pasha and in favour of Sidky at the time of the coup d ! Etat of 1928, and no one was surprised when, in June 1930,Sidky made him Minister of Communications. He joined the Executive Committee of the Shaabist party in December 1930. He was the Cabinet mouthpiece to foreign press correspondents and the n well-informed' source of their telegrams. His tortuous methods complicated, but fortunately did not prevent, the Aviation and Wireless and Caoles settlements in 1932. Strong suspicions of corruption made him an embarrassing colleague in the Cabinet, but his omission from Sidky Pasha’s second Cabinet in January 1933, for which the late King was responsible, appeared not to have affected his close personal relations with the Prime Minister. He was suggested for the Washington Legation, where he could hardly have been persona grata, but 'preferred to serve his country as a Deputy in the 'Chamber'. After Sidky Pasha’s eclipse he played a somewhat equivocal role, leaving the main parliamentary at-oack on his former crony to his brother Wahib. A third brother, Habib, supported the Government in the Senate. He is no longer persona grata in the palace, but would no doubt like to be so again.

His Highness Shaikh Ahead al Jabir al labah, t ie oresent Ruler of Kuwait and possessor, iuwait is an mdeoendant Emirate under the protection of great Britain acc rdin to a special A.Tee-sent concluded between Great Britain and the Emirate of Kuwait on Uovember 3rd 1914. Under that Agreement Great Britain undertook the protection of Kuwait .mirate as an tndependant : mirate ruled by His Highness Shaikh .Mubarak el Gabah. The reign had been transferred from the latter to his grand son His Highness Ghaikh ihraad el babir el Gabah who is bsirir? one o * 1 t-bs d 6 f 6 n&lt;iant.s* According to the above'lenti®ned Afrree ie&lt; t Great, la . r : i has to safeguard the properties in Basrah of the Ruler of Kuwait # nmerit these nroperties is^ strictly speaking, the badaghiya oroperty. In the circumstances what would be the situation ofthe defendants in tnis litigation from the legal point of view? As is enumerated above^ tne Kuwait Emirate had been placed under the protection of Great Britain by an Agreement executed between the said Government and His Highness the Shaikh ol Kuwait. According to the procedure of hue general International Ruling sucn protection usually ends witn the avoidance ol the enmity of any foreign State against tne Kuwait Emirate. But tnis protection is of a special nature, for tne Agreement concluded between Britain and tne Kuwait Emirate embodies, apart from these general undertakings based on tne principj.es of tne general International Law, special guarantees wnereby Great Britain undertake to safeguard the properties in Basrah of His Highness the Shaikh of Kuwait, especially mentioned therein, and among which is the property of Fadaghiya. Whereas Great Britain stood as guarantor xor the properties in Basrah of the Kuwait Emirate and particularly those of the family of His Highness the Ruler of Kuwait Eubarak el Sabah, his sons and grand-sons the guarantor State has, in accordance witn the principles of the general International Law, tne right to interx’ere when another State, through any oi her judicial body whatsoever, attempts to aliect what has been guaranteed by the State. The validity of such interference is being one of tne most complicated and critical matters in the International Law, particularly when tne enacters did not observe full care when dealing therewith. The discussion, however, of tne acts of tne States is of no use not because the States are adopting differential principles only but it is also due to tne fact that some States act, in certain evenhs as such that it conflicts with their action in other similar event, a matter whicn renders the deduction of any procedure of the numerous historical events impracticable. such occasions it is imperative to refer to the original principles of procedure in respect of the independence and tne protection obligations.y \S^&gt; - 3 - Interference is almost a political method whicn is not free from encroacnment upon Justice. But in exceptional cases, this interference may sometimes become a legal ri a nt althougn tne adoption thereof leads to tue infringement of tne moi'al obligations e.g. the interference for the realization of a rignt embodied in a Treaty and/or in tne International ruling i*e. in tne event of the interference of tne State which had guaranteed the safety of the property of another State or the safety of the ruling family or of other definite shape of Governments therein. There are many events of interference in tne history e.g. the interference of the United States witn Cuba in 1906 which interference had occurred by virtue of tne provisions of tne Treaty of Havana of 1903 wherein America was given tne right to interfere with a view to protecting the independence of Cuba under the control of a regular Government in order to protect life, property and liberty. In tne circumstances, the dispute is now regarded to have tahen place between Great Britain and tne Government of Iraq as the latter being responsible for tne rignts of her subjects who are ner own people. By saying that tne dispute is raised between Great Britain and tne Govex*nment of Iraq we base our indication on the guarantee referred to amove which nas been assumed by the British Government towards tne Emirate of Kuwait for the protection of tnose properties which are now the subject of the suit under review. ♦ Now we have to discuss whether tne relations effected between Great Britain and the Government of Iraq allow tne ordiiiary Courts in Iraq to pass decision in such dispute or the same is being outside tneir province. War was declared against Turkey on 5th November 1914 when Iraq was one of the Turkish Vilayets. The En&amp;lisn Troops occupied the Basrah Vilayet on 6th November 1914, and, by virtue of her Occupation Britain had the same ri^nts as usually•/; — enjoyed by any Governnent in the occupied lands. The Iraqi lands remained under the Occupation of the British Government since that date until 1922 when she made agreement with the Iraqi Nation and had also concluded another fcrree merit t v area ‘ter urr'er ; Ire sty oxe cuter- 1- : . On 30th uune 1930 she had executed further Treaty designed as ’’Treaty of Alliance between Great Britain and Iraq” which Treaty had, in Article (7), covered a convention which reads as follows i- IrVfct ’’This Treaty re place s^the VP* treaties of alliance ’’sispied at Baghdad on the 10th day of October 1922 ” 11 corresponding to 19th Gafar 13&lt;1 and on the 16th oanuary ”1926 corresponding to 23th damadi el Akhar 134^^as well as ”the supplementary conventions thereof which shall be ”re &gt;ealed when this Treaty is put into execution''. Therefore, the Treaty of 1930 became in force instead of the other treaties previously concluded between Great Britain and the Kingdom of Iraq. This Treaty covered a clear definition whereby the Kingdom of Iraq is bound to respect any guarantee given by the British Government to others since such guarantee is not being in contravention with the covenant of the League of Nations and the Treaty for the prevention of &gt;ar. In other word / it has been stipulated that this guarantee, which should be esteemed, became a legitimate one possessed by those who had assumed the same. The following is the text embodied in the Treaty of 1930:- ”Article (9). Nothing in this Treaty which affects gvhatsoever ”or aims at the breach of rights and guarantees attached or ’’being attached to or against any of the high contracting ’’parties in conformity with the Covenant of the j^eap-ue of ’’Nations or the Treaty for the prevention of *ar signed at ”Paris on the 27th day of August 1923”• It will therefore be gathered from the foregoing that Great Britain and the Iraq Kingdom had made an agreement of friendshipwhich provides tnat no one of tue contracting party snoula offend tne otdier or affect his interests, in the interior or outside, or his relationsnip with the other States. This alliance had also provided that the guarantees against Great Britain should he esteemed by tne Iraqi Kingdom. It nas oeen outlined above that England had assumed a guarantee towards the Emirate of Kuwait to safeguard the properties in Basrah of tne said Emirate which specifically involve r'adaghiya Property as well* The matter did not end with this point but tne Treaty of 1930 embodies a definition governing tne solution method to oe adopted wnen any dispute creeps in between both States in connection with tne interpretation or application of this Treaty. Article 10 provides as lollows i — 'When any dispute takes place in connection witn tne application of this Treaty or the interpretation tnereoi and both tne high contracting parties did not come to conclusion by direct negotiation between them the dispute may tnen be treated in conformity with tne provisions of the Covenant of the League of Nations”• This definition itseif renders tuis suit outside tne duty of tne Courts in tne Iraqi Kingdom as the basis of tne present dispute, as stated above, is confined to tne iact tnat certain Iraqi individuals are claiming from a foreign Emirate, i.e. tne Kuwait Emirate, for her certain properties in Iraq whilst this Emirate is protected by Great Britain who ensures her properties in Basrah. The guarantee or covenant or Great Britain could not be affected by toe Alliance Treaty concluded between Great Britain and toe Kingdom of Iraq by virtue of Article 9 of this Treaty. Therefore, tne discussion now permeates tne suoject oi interpretation of tnis Treaty and tne application thereof, ana, it has been agreed that this interpretation and application is beyond the jurisdiction of toe ordinary Courts as, by virtue- 7 - a president of an independant Emirate and wnen acquiring a property in different States dis act could not in any way be regarded as having departed or assigned his personality as tne Ruler of an independant Emirate- As already pointed out, the Government of Great Britain had guaranteed tne properties in Basran of E.H. T^e Shaikh, his sons and O randsons. Great Britain, by giving tnis guarantee, was not an ordinary individual but is a Government enjoying similar concessions as tnose of tne other Governments by virtue of tneir mutual relations. Tnerefore tne internationality oi this suit, if not based on tne personality of H-H-T^e Shaikh of Kuwait, must be considered as based on the guarantee oi Great Britain to the Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of tne property in question, and, on this State we have to base our statement that tne suit, by virtue of this adaption, is outside tne competence of this Court (1) Owing to the position of the defendants from tne general point of view, (2) by virtue of the guarantee of Great Britain, (3) by virtue of tne provisions of tne Alliance Treaty concluded between Great Britain and tne Iraqi Kingdom in 1920, and, particularly by virtue of tne provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of this Alliaiice- DEFENCE BY PRESCRIPTION» Before discussing tne relations of tnis defence with the subject of the present suit, it is considered advisable to lay before the Court tne legal procedures applicable to the defence by prescription. It is interesting to observe that most of the Laws provide the devolution of tne rights in tne event of prescription and particularly tne Muslims Law on which principles the Iraqi Laws were enacted as the Muslims Law, although do not provide for the devolution of rights for tne oldness thereof, disallows tne hearing of tne suit in tne event ox prescription.— 8 - Article 1£&gt;60 of the 'Majalla' provides as follows 'Suits relating to debts, deposits, owned estates, inheritance and claims not relating to tne general public or to tne genuine 'Waqf' of the estates rendered for 'IVaqf' aa^ e.g. claims regarding the or toe disposal of two rents^arid conditional guardiansnip and product should not be heard if abandoned for 15 years”. The late Selim Rustam Baz of Lebanon had commented upon tnis article as hereunder:. M In fact, an^ suit, whatsoever, left for 15 years without justification should not be heard unless it pertains to tne original “A'aqf' and, if heard by a J u dge and a decree is passed by him in this respect, his judgment should not oe executed since it is outside his power. To elucidate the matter more further, it is found advisable to mention certain examples: (1) Should a person claims for an estate in possession of otner person whicn estate has been inherited irom nis father who is dead since 15 years ago, his suit should not De heard if he affirms that the estate has been in possession ox the defendant since the deatn of his father, even ii the same claim is proved by evidence”. This is the comment of the reviewer of tne “Majalla” but this is not being the only opinion in this respect as the Courts in Egypt pitch upon this opinion as well and the Egyptian Court of Cassation have numerous opinions in support of our foregoing statement. On 18th April 1935 tne said court had passed certain Judgment in which they said:. **Th® procedure of the Islamic Law governing thio abandonment which tends to the non-hearing of the suit covers the abandonment of the real suit and tne raisin^ o- the exigency of the suit e.g. the extortion of tne substance others, the latter encroachment thereupon and their denial oi the owner’s right therein. This procedure is governed by Article 375 of the Shara 1 Court Law in force which provides as hereunder-9- tbit- are not allowed to dear a suit on whicn 15 years hadl elapsed if tne plaintiff were in a position to file the game durin^ that period and nas no legitimate excuse for non-raising the sane, unless in the event of inheritance and 'tfaqf' in which case tne hearing of the suit is not disallowed but after thirty three years and provided tnat tne party concerned having been in a position to sue it and has no legitimate excuse for nis failure to do so* This is besides tne denial of the right during that period. The abandonment of tne substance or tne negligence thereof, whatever tne period may be long, without any interference; extortion and/or t^e denial of We owners rignt therein on tne part of any body else, his evidence is not then necessary, neither in We Islamic Laws nor in any other Laws. Also the rights of ownership therein cannot be lapsed arid t^e hearing of the suit in that respect is not disallowed should an encroaches interferes therewith after tne lengthy period oi abandonment• w This i*&gt; not tne onl^ Judgment passed by tne Egyptian ^ourt of Cassation bat latter had passed other judgments in this sense. The^ had passed a judgment on 23rd April 1936 ana another on tne same date as well, and, all tnese judgments were based on one and tue same opinion as indicated above. The most important point aiiuaed to by these judgments in transmission froia tne Islamic Shara* procedure was tnat tne appropriator of tne substance may defend, on prescription, ior the non-hearin fo of the suit even if he nad extorted tne property• Shakir El Handily in page 9? and the subsequent pages of nis Compilation the ’’Review of Judgments governing lands and immoveable property” considers likewise, but ne disagrees with the judgments of tne Egyptian Court of Cassation in regard to tne reason of appropriation, as in para 41 page 102 he said:- »Tne insistence of tne appropriator upon tne prescription in respect of the absolute properties and tne double rent and federal ” :aqf” property without producing a legal evidence and his disposal tnereox does not aeieat the suit of tne plaintiff and neither it precludes tne hearing of tne suit. As regards tne State Domains and w’aqi lands it is not necessary to produce the legal document and the appropriator can insist^ on the oas^s ol tne prescription.' In page 103 of tue same book ne saia as follows- 10 - — “LiKewise, if tne defendant, wno is being trie approp. affirms before tne Courts^ in suits respecting tiie disposal of absolute properties and double rent and federal vaqf estates,tnat be had taken over tne property from tne plaintiff or that tne latter had transferred the Waqf estate to him and tne same were unuer his disposal in the presence of tne plaintiff for a period of 16 years the prescription in question shall not preclude tne hearing of tne suit but tne defendant snouia prove tne sale or transfer alleged by him. As regards the State domains ana Waqf lands such as the allotment lands the matter would then be on tne contrary”. The above is the opinion of Shakir el Hanbili which differs with tne Egyptian Court of Cassation in so far as the reason of appropriation is concerned, for tne Court of Cassation had said tnat 11 tne reason of appropriation might be by extortion, and, snouid it reiaain for 16 years despite tne fact that^ during tnat period, tne plaintiff had been in a position to file tne suit, regarding the substance, but Kept silent, tne said extortion shall preclude tne nearing of tne suit if fifteen years have since passed. But Shakir el Hanoili finds tnat the course of appropriation should be based on legitimate reason,whilst anotner Jurisprudent by name All Haider Sff. prefers the views of tiie Egyptian Court of Cassation in view of tne fundaments of tne Islamic Law on which the sa ie is based in regard to tne aourge of appropriation, as ne does not find any difference between tne owned lanas and the State domains as well as tne ’Vaqf lands as ne says that (the allegation oi tne prescription does not provide the indication of tne reasons of appropriation and disposal whatever tne nature of tne land® may be) (3es endorsement on page 103 of the aoovementioned Book). As regards our point of view, we do not understand any ^rounds for this stxpuiaticn oy the Hanuiii regarding the reasons of appropriation and^for hi* statement tnat tnis reason snouid be legitimate. Ve find that tne reason for defence on tne grounds of prescription is tne negligence and abandonment on the part of the plaintiff in connection with the substance, a matter which necessitates tne devolution of11 - his right therein* It is further considered that should the opinion of Shakir el Hanbili, stipulating that the reason of appropriation should be legitimate, he correct, tnere would be no necessity ior defence on the grounds of prescription as when the reason of appropriation is legitimate it would alone be sufficient enou^n to defeat the claim of the plaintiff for the substance* The Iraqi Court of Cassation ha^chowever a moderate opinion as they had resolved in suit N 0 .251/925 a certain procedure published in rt h;ajallat el Adliya' (tne Magazine of the Ministry of Justice) in its fourth edition of tne second year (page 100) where they said:- 'The nearing of defence regarding the disposal, during the prescription, in connection with a property registered under a valid deed is not admissible unless tne defence for prescription is based on a certain reason of appropria tion by virtue of a written document”• After having laid down tnese opinions and definitions covering the procedure of prescription we now wish to discuss the facts of the present suit to see whether these facts, as enumerated in the statement of tne suit and according to the tacts established in tne documents, allow tne hearing of the suit or the court is disallowed to near tne same by virtue of the prescription of 15 years* In tne statement of the suit tne plaintiff alleges that he owns an inheritence from his paternal aunt Awasha Khanum bint Abdulla A1 Zunair a**#- is being one third of the whole date trees situated at Fadaghiya at Fao Nahia and registered at Tapu in her name under serial No*94, 95, 96 and 97 during January 1324 (permanent) and under N 0 .ll and 12 of August 1915 (permanent) and has based his statement on tne grounds of the legal partition dated 31st December 1931 as well as on the Tapu records abovementioned. He then stated that the defendants had appropriated the same property and are oojecting to his ownership therein. He further indicated that Hamad and Abdulla s/o Shaikh Mubarak el Sabah and Jabir, saiera andN&amp;ssir s/o Shaikh jz-ubara^ ei Saban the legators of the other defendants had obtained tne saiue in an unlawful manner and by illegal deeds given in tneir names under N 0 •13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 13 of August 1915. The statement of tne plaintiff covers two points (1) That the defendants are denying his property ana (2) that this denial took place, in his opinion, since .ugust 1915. ./hen referring to tne date of t^e application of the suit it will be found that ne had only raised his suit before tne Courts, claimin a for this property, on 20th Octooer 1932 and thus it will be revealed that over 15 years have lapsed since the defendants nave appropriated tne property in question - whicn is the specified period on expiry of which tne nearing of the suit becomes disallowed. On referring to tne legal partition dated 31st December 1931 it will be seen that tne death of Aesha bint Abdulla el Zuhair, the legatoress of the plaintiff, two months before the date of t^e partition is evident i.e. she died on 21st October 1931 hence tne period between the date, alleged by the plaintiff's attorney in the application of the suit to be tne date of appropriation of the property by the defendants, and tne date of tae deatn of Aesna el Zuhair, tne iegatoress of tne plaintiff, exceeds 15 years which is the legal period for the non hearing of the suit. Therefore tne ri &amp; nt for tne hearing of the suit having xapsed before the death o f the lego tore ss and tne estate having oeen transferred to the heireps of i.esna el Zunair, among whom is tne plaintiff, hence by a person who have no legal quality to file tne said suit. tfhen considering tne facts of the suit in the light of tiie various views dealing with the reasons of appropriation it will be revealed that tnese facts are involved by all the opinions and preclude the hearing of the suit.mrnmmmmmmmm wmKmmmmmmm ■■ -U- If we attribute tne appropriation by tne defendants to tne extortion this will preclude the hearing of the suit by prescription. The plaintiff has already afx’irmed, in the application of the suit, the appropriation of the defendants and indicated the date thereof to be in August 1915. In mentioning that trie appropriation oy tne defendants must be regarded as reason of a legal acquisition in conformity with tne views of hhakir el Nanbili and the resolution of the Iraqi lourt of Cassation alluded to above, we find that the plaintiff affirms in the application of tne suit that the deiendants had obtained, for this property, Tapu deeds in their names dated August 1915 booked under No.13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 13 (permanent)• Tne plaintiff indicates that these deeds are illegal, we do not acknowledge this statement and, although there being no necessity to deal with this subject, we would like to say that the court of Cassation had in its resolution on suit N 0 .251/1925, ^'u.-vliSiieu in page 100 of the ^Wajallat el Adliy&amp; H -jn its second year edition,said:- 'It is not stipulated that the document of the appropriation should be a legal one i.e. fulfilling all the conditions of the Law (and the only indication contained in tne said resolution) is that, to enable tne appropriator to defend by prescription, the said appropriation should be based on a certain reason for acquisition by virtue of a written instrument H . The documents of tne defendants covering tne appropriation are written deeds as acknowledged by the plaintiff himself in his application and this fact is also corroborated by the papers' -14- accomp&amp;nyin&amp; tills statement and which are all in writing anc confirming the appropriation of the property dy tne defendants since 1909. Moreover, tne stipulation of a reason for the appropriation by a written instrument as provided by the Iraqi Court of Cassation in 1925 had been abandoned by tne said court during 1926 wnen tney resolved that the extortion may be regarded as one of tue reasons for appropriation and on which if 15 years nave elapsed it will preclude the nearing of tne suit as enumerated in tue Judgment publisned in H ajail&amp;t en .adna * 1 in its second year’s editions N 0 .3 and 4 page 426 (file No•597/1936) which reads as follows :- •’If tiie plaintiff raises her suit claiming the preclusion of tue plaintiff from interference in a house owned by her and if sue affirms that he had extorted tne same from her since 13 years and had amalgamated tne same with his house her suit must be rejected as this period is beyond the prescription specified.” Th« Court of Cassation, in elucidation of tnis procedure, had indicated that •’Tne Court of First Instance Sulaimaniya had passed Judgment in presence of the adverse parties on 2nd February 1936, file N 0 •'*5/1926, rejecting the suit of the plaintiff (appellant) regarding tne preclusion of tne defendant (appellee) from his interference in connection witn tne house situated at GoTciza quarters and tne Court had made the said woman liable for payment of tne court fees. The plaintiff had applied appealing tne judgment passed for tne above rejection as she was not satisfied therewith. O n scrutinization of the respective papers of tne suit it has appeared that the house under dispute in this suit is not registered at the Tapu Dept, and tne defendant (appellee) pleaded that the said house was under his disposal without any dispute since a period exceeding tne prescription specified. Tne M f on tne meeting held on 26th January 1936 had affirmed that the defendant had extorted the nouse in question and auiaigamated it witn nis nouse since 13 years ago.Witii this af f i mat ion 4 o f the plaintifi Uie defence of the defendant that ne had tne same under his disposal for a period exceeding tne specified prescription has oeen established. Therefore the appealed judgment rejecting the suit of the plaintiff and making her liable to meet the court fees is being in conformity witn tne Law and that the objection of the appeallant is a* out of the question and her plea is to be rejected and tne appealed judgment is tnerefore confirmed. The appeallant should likewise meet tne appeal fees and judgment is unanimously passed on 8 th Safar 1355 corresponding to 29tn April 1936 H .~ir&gt;. Certain authors consider tnat it is possioie to confina the prescription by evidence but some of them consider taat if the plaintiff’s document is in accordance with the provisions of tne Law no evidence snail be accepted against him* Those who consider that the witness is unacceptable against an official document nave mingled two points together i.e* ( 1 ) that this witness does not intent on txie subject oi the document and tne contents tnereof ( 2 ) it intents on a a aria -l question having no relations with this document whatsoever i.e. tne appropriation by the deiendants^ior 16 jears^ oi the substance claimed for* This mingling is due perhaps to ti^e mixed comprehension of the procedure governing the non admissibility oi evidence against tne agreements. These people might have been confused by hue provisions of para 2 , article 30 of the uivil irocedure which provides as follows:- M 3 ,jit filed against a document relating to these matters must be proved by a document or by tne affirmation oi the defendant or his books though tiie same ^-o not exceed thousand piasters ’ 1 • This definition means tnat tne suit shoulci oe based on a written document ana it also provided that the defendant must not be allowed to defend tne suit by evidence. Our isjslxeurx present suit under review dii^er^ &lt;u great deal from the foregoing as tnere is no agreement between us and tne plaintiff so tnat the latter can asx for the execution thereof against the defendants througn tne Courts and neitner we are tryin t , to exonerate ourselves of tnis agreement by tne evidence of witnesses. But tae situation involving tne matter is tnat ne claims for tne property whilst we say tnat he had ( witiiOut justifiable reason, abandoned the claim for this property, which he pretends to be his own, for such a period which precludes tne hearing of nis claim and denies his allegation. Therefore tae difference, between the provisions of para(L) a:*Lxc^e 80 01 tne procedure and our this defence, is i-ai* reacnin^. v»e.16- 111 do not defend for tne agreement to which tne plaintiff is sticking nor we attempt to prove on the contrary gt£ to tne Contents thereof but we claim for prescription which precludes tne hearing of tne plaintiff*s suit and we also base our claim for prescription on the foregoing evidence. The rule enumerated in para 2, article 80 of the i rocedure has likewise been covered by article 1341 of the Frencn ^ivil Law which article has been by the viewer (Recdalose) at the time. It will appear from tne foregoing that tne defence for the non-hearing of tne plaintiff*s claim due to prescription is a sound defence from all aspects and should, by virtue of tne Law and justice, be adopted and the plaintiif*s claim be rejected for the reasons outlined above. The foregoing is not being our sole defence by prescription but we also defend the suit by virtue of the Indian Limitation procedure as follows 'These properties were registered in the names of the defendants in accordance with the instructions issued by the Chief Finance Inspector (Sir Henry Dobbs) on 14th June 1^15 under :o»604 as Sir Henry Dobbs was at the same time Director-General of Tapu hence tne orders passed by him are regarded as having passed by the competent Govt. Officer by virtue of his duty and the claim for the revoking of such an order should be raised within one year from the date of its issue as provided in para 14, article 1 part I of tne Indian Limitation Act which reads as follows: 14— i* or tne cancellation of any act or resolution not herein specified, issued b, a G 0 vt.Officer by ' virtue of his official capacity”. Whereas tne suits dropped by tne Indian Limitation Act on its application cannot be renewed,after the cancellation of tne said Act, in view of trie provisions of the Regulation of 1920 governing the cancellation of Basrah Laws which regulation provides as follows:.-17- \*7% H Tiie right for t A *e raiain^, of sucn cases whicn were dropped by prescription prior to tne introduction of this Regulation snould not now be renewed subsequent upon the repealing of the Indian Limitation Act”, and as tixis suit was not raised before June 1916 tne rignt for bringing forward of this case has since been dropped since tnat date and its hearing by tne court is inadmissible in view of the foregoing. REPLY REGARDING TEE ORIGIN OF THE CASE. The dispute in this suit is raised in connection v/ith properties situated at Fadaghiya of Fao Nahia and all tnese properties are owned and registered in tne Tapu Dept, at Basrah in tne names of tne five sons of Shaikh iv^barak el babaui i.e. Jabir, Salem, Nasir, Hamad and Abdulla under No.8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 52, 53, 58, 59, 78, 79 80 and 81 (permanent)• Tnese also cover tne Fadaghiya situated on fore snores which are the property of the Shaikh of Kuwait and were detached from the river and on which considerable expense was incurred for the erection of protective bunds, etc. with a view to rendering the said snores suitable for tne plantation of date trees. On detachment of tnis foreshore from the river the Shaikh had the option to buy the same against the usual value of substitution as provided by the Law. The Shaikh of Kuwait had acquired some of these properties by purchase from Ali Beg El Misnry and soiae from Ahmed Pasna el Zuhair as being tne Agent of his wife Aesna K^anim el Zuhair. lie also purcnased certain other property from Shaikha Khanum the wife of Abdul Waiiab Pasna el ^irtass. The dispute is now raised in connection with Fadagniya property in proportion to the property sold by Abdul Vahab Pasna el ^irtass, as being Attorney of Ahmad pasna el Zuhair tne Agent of his wife Kh&amp;num el Zuhair, to the late Shaikh Mubarak el Sabah and is registered in the names of his sonsat tne Tapu Dept, under N 0 .13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 13 in August 1915. The agreement regarding the properties under dispute has been concluded on 21st t u narram 1327 and tne most important points covered by this agreement were as follows (1) The said agreement begins with tne following paragraph:- (I Abdul Wahab el irtass have, by virtue of my power of Attorney indicated above, sold in a lump to H.E. Shaikh i^ubarak iraena el Saban Uie property owned by my client in question which were under her disposal upto the date of this agreement and which covers all the plots planted with trees ana date trees including the i. ahaweel all situated at Fadaghi/a Nahia of Fao Qadha, of Basra Liwa, and the boundaries of which need not be mentioned owing to toe famousness thereof unaer their names and locality abovementioned)« (2) The following has also been indicated in tne text of the agreement:- (The total value of this sale is forty-four thousand jcswxd and two-hundred &amp; seventeen Ottoman Pounds and thirty-taree ana naif piasters only wnich sum has been received by me in casn, nence a 11 the date gardens including the muhaweel shown above became the property of H.E.Shaikh i^barak Pasha el Sabah who may now dispose of the same as his own property without any dispute and, from date, tne name of my said snown against these properties in the official records (Khakani) became null and void as tne genuine owner ana tne lawful disposer of the lands in question is H.b.Sh a ifch g u barak Fasna el Sabah and that my above mentioned nas no further rights whatsoever in these lands, and, am bound and undertake to perform the transfer transaction at the Khakani records with the respective Dept, at Basrah into tne na^e of Shaikh 4ibarak Fasna or in the name of any other persons to be nominated by him at any time) • (3) The said agreement concluded with the following phrase:. (Th« delay in tne completion of tae above transaction does not in any way tend to affect the effectiveness of this agreement). In this agreement 26 persons had signed as witnesses and are from trie notables and prominent men of Basrah and most of them are from el &amp;uhair family and among wnom is Issa bin Abdulla el Zuhair tne fatner of the present plaintiff and tne brother of tne seller Aesha Khanum ex iuhair the legator of tne plaintiff.I t t 19&lt; On 20th Habie el Awwai 1323 Abdul Wahab pasha el Qirtass wrote a letter to K.H* Shaikh Mubarak Pasha al Sabah and it is interesting to reproduce the same in this statement as follows Shaikh &gt;aibarak Pasha el habah. ’‘Greetings &amp; Respects. “I have witn great pleasure received your letter dated 15th lust, the contents of which are noted and hope that all your undertakings shall be successful.

WALI OF THE WILAYA (SEAL) 4th Jamaa el Thuni 1328. ,,, — -- 21 - Sub sequent upon these ccrrespfendence great Britain had occupied Basrah on 6th November 1916, and, pursuant upon the agreement entered into between Great Britain and H.K. T^e Shaikh or Kuwait whereby tne former undertook to safeguard at Basrah all his properties and those of his successors and exempt hla from the usual tax payable thereon Mr•Henry Dobbs, t£e Director o: Finance then, had passed orders for tne grant of a Tapu record to H.H. The Shaikh of Kuwait in respect of these properties and the said properties were accordingly registered in the names of his sons at tne Tapu Dept. Basrah under a deed which reads as follows No. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 and IB dated August 1916. Ahmed Pasha el Zuhair, on behalf of his wife Aesna bint Abdulla Chaliabi el Zuhair, has appointed Abdul ahab pasha el ,/irtass as his agent under &amp; legal Power of Attorney given by the Basrah Court on 26th Dhil ida 1326 to sell tne plot of date trees owned by her. The Agent has accordingly sold tne same to Shaikh y^baral Pasna el Sabah a nd prepared t^e necessary notification of the people of tne area in respect of the transfer of the property. On completion thereof, under a letter from tne Tapu Dept, on 9th February 1324 given on the application of the Agent Abdul Wahab Pasha, the Ottoman Govt, passed orders for tne postponement of t^e transaction pending further advice. T^e Agent .ibdul Wahab pasha and shaikh M u barak had both called at the British Consulate where they acknowledged the transaction and tne Consul had Qii /1909 countersigned tne agreement covering the sale dated 21st i,! 0 harram 1327 after confirmation tne re of by the Agent. The memo N 0 .504 of 14th J n ne 1916 given by the Finance Inspector confirms the sale and in view of the a pplicatlon submitted by Abdul Aziz el Salem the Agent of Shaikh Mubarak and according to the letter from tneShaikh sealed by his seal tae issue of tue Tapu deed in tne name of tne sons is in order as shown in the agreement. Therefore, and, in view of these instruments the Tapu Deed in respect of the land was given in tae name of tne sons who also have another deed covering tne trees which are included in tne sale and so tne property has been registered in the names of Jabir, Salem, Nasir, Ahmad and Abdullah s/o Shaikh Mubarak Pasha el Sabah. These were tne stages and circumstances of the saj.e in question but it has been indicated in tne application of tne plaintiff’s suit that these deeds were illegal without pointing out the reasons of tneir invalidity. It is believed that he attempts to say that tue same were not concluded in conformity with tne Tapu Regulation or, in the other word, the agreement is not an official one i.e. the offer and acceptance of tne sale has not been made before an Officer duly authorized to perform this transaction. This what we believe our litigant (tne plaintiff) may wish to say as he did not mention in his application the reason for the invalidity of the deeds of ownership in possession of the defendants and that he must have based this opinion on tne fact that the offer and acceptance in respect of the agreement of sale should have been made before an authorized officer, a aiatter which has never been stipulated by most of tne laws of many nations. The sale in Egypt, for instance, is to be carried out by mutual agreement which does not provide any other action and similarly in France and also in tne Islamic Laws as the sale and purchase of absolute property is within the special rights granted to individuals with entire liberty and is being one of the transactions which, made liable to special formalities under the Laws, would be handicapped iff -23- uiid tills centlicts with the economical requirements which call i or all desj^atch^order to safeguard against the interests so much required by the economic Rule, p here are some transactions which are subject to formal actions ss provided by many of tne Laws, such as tne mortgage in ^d rranee and the sale of Govt, properties and the properties rendered as H Waqf w in an incorrect manner in Iraq and txie carriage as well. The factors involving the liability of tiiese transactions to formal actions are apparent e.g. tne marriage which provides tnat tne lineage should first be proved whilst this proof is tne right of others, but tne liability of marriage to formal actions has only taken place recently in Egypt. And likewise the mortgage which involves severe consequences such as the dispossession of the mortgager, and tne liability thereof to formal action is with a view to allowing ample time to tne mortager to think of his fate. This is also detrimental and would lead to tne abandonment of the mortgage of property by tne mortgager. In this connection Shakir el Hanbili, tue viewer of tne Lands Law had, in his views on this subject, said:- 'It is doubtless that tne performance of the sale, gifts and mortgages at the Khakani Depts. and tne issue of a Khakani deed to tne purchaser, Donee and mortgagee is very beneficial from the point of view of the regularity of transactions, but the non acknowledgment of these transactions when performed outside the Khakani Dept, and tne disallowance of the Judges to hear tne suits respecting properties not bound by a Khakani deed or, in the other word, the application of tne transactions in respect of Govt, lands to the properties calls for consideration from the point of view* of the contravention thereof to the 3hara*a provisions. It is possible to adopt special provisions to govern tne disposal of Govt, lands so as to conform witn the interests of the Treasury since the surveillance tnereof is entrusted to the latter. But absolute properties are governed by the 3hara*a Laws* as the 'Majalla' provides that every person may dispose off his property at his discretion but provided tnat he snould not injure the properties of others and that tne agreements duly given by the respective owners are valid. Therefore the sale, gift and mortgage of properties outside tne Khakani Dept, is in order from the Shara* provisions point of view and the non hearing of suits by tne Shar*a and Civil Courts aRfcxxg respecting disputes taking place between the seller and tne purenaser, the Donar and Donee, tne mortgager and mortgagee in connection with properties as well as tne non issue of judgment, persuant upon the confession of thelitigant, owing to tne non-hearing of tne suit would lead to tne devolution of rights and tne departure from tne purpose aimed at from tne introduction of tne Law”. It would tnerefore be observed that tne performance of the formality which the litigant attempts to allege as having been omitted in the title deeds in possession of tne defendants is not Justified by any reason whatsoever. Moreover, has this formality been stipulated against tne contracting parties or, in the other word, is it necessary that tne acceptance should, equally to the offer, be performed before an autnorized officer ? It is theoretically agreed in several Laws such as in France and Egypt that tne offer is to be performed before tne Government Officer as the seller is tne one who is relinquishing his property duly registered in his name and transferring tne same to otners. This has been specifically provided in the Egyptian and French Laws in connection with the mortgage of an estate. As regards the acceptance, tne sane can be made in any form even by tne use of tne standardized form confirming tne offer of tne mortgager as if being submitted by tne mortgagee creditor for registration. We would also like to point out in this statement that tne non-compliance with the stipulation regarding tne formalities respecting tne agreements said tne registration thereof does not affect in any way the contracting parties, but any snortcoming effect in these actions would be apparent amongst two individuals having under dispute the place in which tne agreement has taken place. This has been observed by almost all laws and even in Iraq as on 5th July 1919 the Acting Commander-in-Chief, Iraq Expeditionary Forces had issued Notification,Article 3 of which reads as follows:.'Nevertheless, if any person sells his absolute property by an ordinary deed not registered and it then appears that ne or his heirers and/or Agent had sold or mortgaged that property with another person wno had registered tue same in the Tapu Dept, without knowing of tne existence of the ordinary deed the latter will not be executed on the possessor of the registered deed.' The Iraqi Govt, had on 18th April 1922 introduced a Law designated as 'Law governing tne XxxBLxxxxxtixx Unregistered Sales and Transfers' Article 6 of which reads as follows ’’Any sale or final transfer and/or conditional transfer shall not be executed against a person who is entitled to a land by virtue of another agreement given by the sane seller or transferer or by his heirers or transferers if the other agreement had been duly registered at tne Tapu Dept, without knowing any thing about tne previous unregistered agreement.' Likewise tne Egyptian Govt, had enacted a Law for the registration of agreements of this nature i.e. Law N 0 .18 and 19 of 1923 article 1 of which reads as follows 'Al-c agreements ^concluded, bj tfa nti against a substitute or otherwise and which provide the establishment of a right of ownership or a right ox other estate property or tne transfer, alteration and/or the elimination thereof as well as ti.e final judgments covering such a condition should be declared by having tne same registered at tne office of tne Preliminary Court where the estate is enrolled or at tne Shara Court, with due regards to the provisions in force at present in connection with the concessions, mortgage of estates and estate allotments'. 'The non-registration provides tnat the above rights snail not take effect, nor it be transferred, altered and/or eliminated neither amon, ; ; tne contracting parties nor in comparison witxi otners and non registered agreements shall have no effect but the personal undertakings between tne contracting parties .and the provisions of this article are regarded as a restriction to the provisions governing the transfer of ownersnip mraacyAy and other rights of estate substance by the mere offer ana acceptance between the contracting parties'. On remonstrating/ against this Law tne Egyptian Court of Cassation said:- 'The agreement of sale is one of tne mutual agreements which conciuaes and takes effect by tne mere acceptance of both parties. The only invention introduced by tne Registra^ion Law in respect tnereof is tnat tne transfer of ownership, after having been regarded as essential result for tne proper sale as provided by tne provisions of para (1) Article 266 of the Civil Law on having the same concluded by an agreement, it nas now become loo until after tne registration. The other provisions the sale are still in force and nave never been r“26* by the Registration Law as tne seller remains bound, by virtue of tne agreement, to hand over tne sale and the transfer of ownership to the purcnaser whilst the latter remains bound to pay tne value etc. as mutually agreed to by tne mere conclusion of the agreement. H It will be seen from the above provisions that the sale will not be null and void wnen not fulfilling these its formal formalities but &amp;xxx effect becomes loose, as inuicated by the Egyptian Court of Cassation, pending completion of tne said formal formalities between the contracting parties alone. As regards those who have under dispute a property not transferred, tne party who having fulfilled those formal formalities before his competitor will be given preference as delineated above. This procedure is nou of tne day as it has been said before tnat M who he endeavours to revoke wnat has been done by hint his endeavours snail reflect on aim”. We now «*isn to discuss tne following matter :- Did tne Laws in Iraq really provide taat the offer and acceptance in respect of the sale of absolute lands should be performed before an authorized officer or not ? We have perused certain legal books wnieh deal with this matter and were all found to be stipulating the same witaout snowing tne origin of tnat opinion. We have also referred to tae Laws governing tne sale of immoveable properties and particularly tne Law governing tne disposal of Immoveable Properties ana have observed tnat Article (1) thereof proviues as follows ”All transactions relating to Govt.Lands and 'Waqf” Lands snould be perfomed at tne Office of the Khakani Depts. only and tue disposers tnereof be given a KhaKani deed, and, whereas the disposal without a title deed is disallowed, tne hearing of a suit by tne Shara 1 a and Civil Courts and the performance of tne transaction at tne Govt.Depts. in respect of lands for which no K^akani deed is produced is likewise prohibited snould it happen at the places where tne document and demarcation have been performed in accordance with the new Law”.-27- It appears from tae provision of this article that the same apply to tne transactions relating to G 0 vt* Lands and $aqf lands and did not provide anytning about the absolute property, therefore, tne liability of tne latter to tne provisions of this article is beyond the definitions thereof. It would be understood from the expression (as the disposal without a need is disallowed tne hearing of is likewise prohibited) tnat the same alludes to the disposal of absolute property, but this comprehension is wrong as tx.e disposal alluded to by this article, according to tiiis expression, is txie specific disposal referred to in tne beginning of this article i.e. tne transactions relating to Govt, lands and Waqf Lands. When referring to tne Regulation designated as (Tapu Regulation - form of the H&amp;aayoni deed - to be complied with accordingly) it will be observed that rticle (1) thereof provides as follows 'Whereas tne Revenue Officers i.e. the Daftardars, the {vludir el Mai and tne ^jdirs of the ^adixas are authorized to grant reclamations and accept tenders in respect of Govt.lands in outside stations they should therefore be regarded equally to txxe owner of the land”. It will also be seen that the provision of this article refers to Govt, lands onl&gt;. Article ( 3 ) begins also with txie following (If any one intends to relinquish a land etc) and it is intuitively understood tnat relinquishing does not taKe place in connection with absolute property. All the foregoing provisions do not in any way provide the necessity of obtaining Tapu deeds for absolute property and, altxiough the same are beneficial therefor and render the absolute property subject to Tapu Regulation, they do not repeal txxese agreements but, as provided in tue Egyptian Law, defer the traces thereof pending fulfi lme nt of tnese formal formalities.28- ? f h The abovernentioneG Laws and Regulations all provide i tnat a suit in respect of the property should not be heard but they do not however define the revoking of the agreement. In this connection we would like to point out that) under this dispute, we are only defendants ana not plaintiffs. It is also desired to discuss the origin 01 this succession since we are unable to find out any trace 1 r it in these Laws, i.e. tne necessity fcnat the offer and acceptance should be made before a competent Officer. We have already referred, in our discussion, to the resolutions of the Iraqi Court of Cassation and it oJU( was found that these resolutions proviae tnat tne sale of immoveable properties outside the K^akani Dept, is not valid and these resolutions were based on the provisions of article (1) of the Law governing tne disposal of immoveable property and the Royal /arrant issued in September 1318. These resolutions firstly provide, in general, 'the sale of immovable properties”. But it is not understood whether this expression covers the sale of absolute properties or other property. Since, however, the sane resolutions have been based on the provisions of article (1) of the Law governing the disposal of immoveable property which article governs the Govt, property and the Waqf Lands only, these resolutions must therefore be referring to this kind of property only. But the resolutions in question had also referred to the R 0 yal ♦ arrant issued in September 1318 and though we tried to refer to the text of this warrant no trace was made of this text. We have been able to trace the I^truetions issued by the Minister of Interior to the Wilayets in execution of this Warrant. On referring to the provisions of these Instructions and although, it is appreciated, that the same nave not the sane legal effect, but it has been found that these Instructions provide as follows-29- ?U 'Pursuaiit upon tne issue of a Royal Warrant disallowing the courts to hear suits taking place between two parties itsauc for proving tne sale and purchase executed on ordinary documents, the disposers of properties snould be advised tnat they must hasten to obtain tne necessary deeds and the same be also broadcast throughout tne Wilayet by means of local papers and otner methods ,, • It seems from the contents of tnese I r structions that the latter do not revoke the agreements but simply disallow tne nearing of the suit, whilst tne difference between the revoking of the agreement and the disallowance of the hearing of tne suit is great. Nevertheless, do the defendants in this dispute lack Tapu deeds ? The late Shaikh Mubarak el Saban had purcnased these properties from Abdul Wahab pasna el Qirtass, as be hag Agent of Aesna Khanum el Zuhair, in 1327 and subsequently correspondence were excnanged between him and the Sublime Porte and tne matter took a political shape until Great Britain occupied Basran v/ilayet* In this correspondence the Sublime Porte had recognised the correctness of the sale of these properties and issued instructions for the registration thereof at tne Tapu Department as shown in the letter of tne v^ali of Basrah in 1328, as indicated above, but tne sane has not been executed for some political factors which we need hardly mention herein although the letter of the Wall of Basrah abovementioned alludes to tne same reasons indirectly who indicated that Muharram Eff, his predecessor, had some oemfiaujiieationc in these political factors. The mat er has thus remained lingering until Great Britain occupied Basrah and, after having organized her affairs therein, sne discussed the question of trie ownership of H.H. The Shaikh as she was in previous touch with him in this respect and tne British Government had resolved that the sale was in order. Subsequently, the Director of Finance Mr.Henry Dobbs had issued orders to tne Tapu Dept, for the registration of this property in the names of the owners tnereof i.e. tne legators oftine defendants. Tine text of tne Tapu deed has already been outlined above. Objection may pernaps be raised to tne incorrectness of this course of action but this objection is out of tne question, as Great Britain when occupying Basrah as invader and she has to organize matters in tne lands occupied by her at her own discretion. Therefore, tne Commander in Chief of the Occupation Troops had issued circular during August 1916 covering tne organization of matters in the occupied country and designated the same as M Tne Occupied Iraq Country Law 11 . Chapter 6 of this Law under the heading Miscellaneous” part 47 reads as follows ”The Courts established by virtue of this Law shall not adopt the Ottoman Penal Laws nor anything connected with the evidence of the Laws or the Ottoman Civil Laws”. Whereas Great Britain navin^, been invader State she has to regularize matters in Iraq as she may deem suitable, hence the officials were not receiving their power from the provisions of the Laws but from the instructions received from the Commander-in-Chiei* or his representative, the Political Officer or his representative. Therefore, the officials of the Tapu Dept. Basran had received written instructions from the Director of Finance, kr.Henry Dobbs, to have taese properties registered in tne names of the sons of H.H.T^e Shaikh of Kowait and have executed tae sane order accordingly. The agreements actually in existence at tne time but not registered the^ were not treated by the Laws as invalid and the latter Laws allowed the registration thereof in the names ox' the respective owners. The said Laws stipulated however tnat no rights of others should be effected on the registration thereof. Among these Laws is the Notification issued by the Commander-In-Chief in 1.919 as well as the Law introduced by the Iraqi G 0 vt. in 1922 which all definitely provide (1) the non revoking of agreements concluded outside the Tapu De ;u. ana (o) t-3L t power granted to tne Commander-in-Chief then allows tdis course of action not by virtue of tne provisions of tne Law but because sue was an invader State. All Authors agree that tne acts of the officials of the invader Government are to be considered in order and among those Authors is Ahmad Nashaat Beg tne Law Professor of tne Royal Egyptian Law School who, in his book known (Rissalat el Itnbat Fi el Taahudat), said:- H When a lawful Govt, becomes conquered and the extorting Govt, appoints an official tne latter correspondence should be consiaered as official correspondence as he is an official in reality. If we consider his acts as invalid this would lead to the hindrance of the people»s interests and paralyses the operations due to tne absence of other person. Such an official when writing any document the same would cover tne people*s interests or embodies certain Civil obligations against the people - which obligations must be esteemed particularly when tne preparation of agreements being made merely on the mutual desire and discretion of tne contracting parties as it is doubtless that it is^tne public and private interest to regard such documents and agreements as official ones. According to tne Islamic Shara Law, the J^dgraent of the Qadhi appointed by tne invader Authority is to be treated as in order'* • This is b~ing the same opinion of tne English Author (Goodnow) in his book (Tne Comparative Administration Law) edition (2) page (25) under the heading ''Office de Factor”. It will therefore be gathered from the foreging that the claim of tne plaintiff is groundless from all aspects and should be rejected. In spite of our confidence in our safe situation in this suit it is imperative on us to mention something about the mode of service of tne process of this suit on the defendants, as this has been carried out illegally. The Civil Procedure Code provides that service of any process snouid be made on tne defendant or his attorney, whilst the plaintiff came forward with this suit in 1932 ipa&amp; failed to have the same served on tne defendants because they reside in an inaependant Emirate far away from the Government of Iraq. H.H. A^mad el Jabir el Sabah the Shaikh of K u wait had appointed one of us (Abdul Jelil Partow) as his attorney to see certain matters but hispower of attorney did not authorize the s aid Advocate to plead in this case, specifically, but in fact the power of attorney had prevented him from the right of accepting the service of any process and, in tne other legal sense of tiie word, H.H.The Shaikh did not allow trie discretion to the Advocate in person or his office to allow the service on him and nas evidently prevented him from this in the said power of attorney hence the service in tnis case is beyond these definitions (1) because the Advocate in question has not been a ppointed to plead in this case but has been appointed to act in other cases (2) in this power of attorney he has been prevented from accepting any service. The Court having decided the litigation of H.H.T^e Shaikh on the grounds of a Telegram sent by K.H. to the fresident of the Court on tne understanding that this telegram is being in acknowledgment of the service on H.H. the Shaikh which is incorrect, as the wire did not cover such expression or a word which could be treated as comprehended by the court besides the fact that, as enumerated above, the above mentioned Advocate is not an attorney in this case and is prevented from accepting any service • In addition to the above tne case was fixed for hearing on 5th January 1938 but on that date the case was postponed for scrutinization and fixed for 12th January 1938 but tne court did not resolve the hearing of tae case against H.H.the Shaikh. On 12tn January the case was adjourned for 15/1/38, due to the absence of the President, without resolving tne hearing thereof. On 15th January 1938 the Court resolved the hearing of the case by default, a matter which is absolutely in contravention to the Law as article 144 (amended) provides that tne hearing can be resolved to be made by default when the defendant fails to attend on the day fixed for trial and that if, on the said date, the*'\ ry m hearing by default is not resolved against tne aeiendant and tne case is adjourned for other date, for some reason or another, another summons should then be issued to tue uefendant. In tnis case the court haa adjourned tne suit twice and did not resolve the trial of U.e case by ueiault and, in the third instance, tne co &gt;rt heal'd the case by default whilst tne oefs; has never been served by any means, whatsoever, to attend on 15th January 1958 hence tne sa^-i actions should be regarded as null and void and no service should be considered as having been received by the defendants. The matter did not end at this stage but tne court had fixed the hearing on 23/1/38 and this has been promulgated in tne papers which is another illegal action, as the notice to be only published in tne local papers when the residence of tne defendant is unknovvn whilst the residence of the deiendants in this case could not be considered as unknown and it is considered that these actions are illegal ana we are reluctantly compelled to nave the sa.e enumerated nere with a view to fulfilling the bearings of the defence in this case. In the circumstances we insist upon our claims that tne suit oi the plaintiff should be rejected and the service process be likewise cancelled and the plaintiff be made liable to meet all court fees plus tne honorary fees including tne sum of ID.11/250 being tne fees for tne drawing up of this statement.

My Lord, Vith reference to my letter (176/4/36) of Llaroh 22nd, ■' ,r * Ba ^allay, I have the honour to report that the efforts vrnicn have been t0 persuade the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to amend paragraph 5 ^ the iraft reply to Mr. Bateman’s letter to Hurl Pasha of July 8th, 1936 (Ho. '347) relative to the application of land settlement procedure to the properties of the ohaikh of Koweit in Iraq, have unfortunately proved fruitless. Minister for Foreign /iffairs and his departmental officials have from the outset maintained that the Iraqi law imposes a number of restrictions on the ownership by foreigners of —g? u ( i#e# ^.ri land granted in Tapu ) property in Iraq. Pressed to quote the law on which this assertion is based, they have produced, after a long delay, Article 110 of the Ottoman Land Code (I enclose a copy of this Article taken from 'Ottoman Land Lsws ,! by Stanley Fisher, M.A: Humphrey Milford 1319). They have explained that the experts in the government departments have assured them that this Article makes it impossible for the Iraqi l overn/rient to give, in full, the assurance for which they wera* . P‘ 7 . asked in the last sentence of paragraph 8 of the note of July 1936. 3. We have argued that such an interpretation of this Article is Inconsistent with the existing procedure, whereby foreigners are given title for insaovable properties, subject only to the consent of the Minister of the Interior or, in special cases, of the Council of Ministers. e have pointed out that there The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, X.G., G.O.8.I., G.C.I. etc., etc., etc.there l 8 nothing In thle Article of the Land Code *hioh provide b reason for the discrimination which is made in the draft reply the iiJte of July 1936 &gt; between the grant to the Shaikh of title for muik and for Taou property, and we have urged that, in any event, article 110 does not apply to the Shaikh's properties as, although some of them may have been acquired by one or other of his forebears while technically an Ottoman subject, the present shaikh, Ahmad al Jabir, must, at the time he inherited tne properties, have been of the same nationality as the man from whom he inherited them. All these efforts, have however, failed to move the Ministry. Chalkh Ahmad, succeeded hie uncle, Salim, in February 1921, before the ratification of the Treaty of Lausanne. It would seem, therefore, that he inherited or at any rate came into effective possession of, the properties in question while he was an Ottoman subject, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been unable to refer to any law or treaty which prevents ex-Ottomans, who have acquired nationality other than Iraqi under tne Treaty of Lausanne, from continuing to own immovable property of which they were in posseaeion before they ceased to be Ottoman subjects. For example, there seems to be nothing to prevent an ex-Ottoman, now a Syrian, from remaining in possession of property which he owned in Iraq before the War. The Mlnistrj however, have stuck obstinately to their point and say that they cannot go furt^er^ meet our wishes than the wording of paragraph 5 of their‘draft. 0n their side it must, in fairness, be admitted that Article 110 of the Land Oode does suggest the possibility of complications concerning the Shaikh’s title which do not seem hitherto to have been fully considered. For example, the promise given to Shaikh J-ubarak in 1914 guarantees ownership ofhiu gardens in iraq to hie deeoendants. But it does not promise that the ownership shall be vested in his successors. Mubarak was succeeded by his eldest son, but Jabir was followed by his bl, ° thei ‘» Salim, and /-Jiraed is the nephew of Salim. So that there is room for difficulties in the matter of inheritance. lbe position in regard to the right of foreigners to acquire property in Iraq is, so far as can be ascertained, that set out in paragraph ,2 of Sir Archibald Clark ■-err s despatch ]&lt;o. 806 of July 14th, 1937, and I suspect that it is the ’ouncil of Minister's resolution of 1934 referred to therein which is the real obstacle to the Iraqi Government agreeing to give the assurance asked for in paragraph 3 of Ur. Bateman's note of July 1936. / 7 J.Vr' 1 observe, however, that the Commander-In-Chief’s [nr K Proclamation No. 58 of July 50th, 1919, deale with the alienation of Immovable property to foreigners, whereas the Council of Ministers' resolution of 1934 (of which there is unfortunately no copy in the archives of this Bnibasay) is said to restrict the of property by foreigners to purposes of residence only* Even if it is assumed that the word 'ownership' is intended here to have the same meaning as 'alienation' in Proclamation $o. 58 the Proclamation itself provides no explicit ground for restricting permission to house property and it may be the fear that the legality of the resolution will be challenged which has deterred the Iraqi authorities from quoting it as the justification for the formula adopted in paragraph 5 of the draft note under discussion* It will be recalled that house property (other than waqf ) is usually classified as rr-i.c * It must also be noted that the Proclamation says nothing ibc-t the grant of title to foreigners for property to which they can establish a claim (other than that of acquisition after the date- 4 - of the Iroclaraatioa), unlese it oan be argued that such grant woul in law^ be alienation by the Cknrernnent. There is, moreover, the Turkish '’haw Giving Foreigners the Right to Rosaees Iitsmovable Property in the Ottoman Kmpire' of 7th Bafar, 1284 (see page 57 of Stanley Fisher’s work quoted above), which was not abrogated in Iraq until the coming into force in June 1951 of tiie 'Personal status Law” (see Compilation of haws for 1931 page 143). it would possibly be argued that the Shaikh should be given title under the Law of 7th Safer because he owned the land before it wos repealed; on the other hand, it could perhaps be equally well maintained that Article 18 (S) of the Personal Status Law prevents the grant of title under the Law of 7th Safer, at any date after the coming into force of the Personal Otatus Law itself. these circumstances of legal uncertainty and confusion I have been considering whether it might not b© advisable for Hie -'ajesty*© Government to accept the formula proposed by the Iraqi Government, subject to the reservation by His Majesty’s Government of all rights concerning the effect of the bhaikh’e non-Iraqi status on the question of the grant to him of taou deeds for properties awarded to him by the Land Sctticnent committee. The disadvantages of taking this course would be:- (a) That although, under the de facto practice described above (and setting aside the complications to which Article 110 n&amp;ght give rise in the matter of inheritance), the only bar to the grant of title to the Shaikh for properties awarded to him by Land Settlement ie apparently the Council of Ministers’ resolution of 1934, there is no guarantee that when the time comes the Council of Fini^ter© would be willing to instruct the Tapu office to grant the Oh&amp;ikh title for any properties. In fact there aeema to be a consider able riskable risk that they would not agree to do so and would devise a variety of arguments to justify their refusal* (b) That, so far as I have been able to find out, most of the property now in the possession of the Ghaikh is, or if awarded to him would become, nlri rnufaw&amp;g* Very little, if any, seems to be mulk, though it is possible that the trees planted in the gardens may be rnulk (Article 26 of the Land Code) but I feel unable to assess what effect this additional complication may have on the Shaikh*s right to title as a non-Iraqi. (c) That in consequence of the considerations mentioned in (a) and (b), the proposed Land Settlement procedure might lead to a situation in which the Shaikh of Xoweit (or the Shaikh and other heirs of Shaikh Ltubarak) might be confirmed in their claim to the bulk of the properties which are now in their possession, but be refused title for them* Such a situation might bring into prominence the whole question of the Shaikh* e right as a foreigner to own property in Iraq whereas up to the present his right has only been contested by private individuals in respect of part of the properties* On the other hand, the advantages to be gained would be:- (a) That civil suits against the Shaikh (including the case now before the Courts about the Faddaghiyah properties) would not be heard* (b) That full information about the Shaikh’s properties (including aurvey plans) would at last be available, a result which, for many reasons, would be a help towards the final settlement of the question of ownership. (c) That Land Settlement will, in any event, be applied ultimately and that in view of (a) it is better that it should be applied now rather than later.6 0.0 ^ (d) Althoxigh the Iraqi Government are not willing to give in fall the assurance asked for, they have not declared that title will not be given for tapu land, but only that in this regard the law mat be taken into account. The provisions of the law are not clear but, whatever they are, they cannot in the end be avoided and, provided that when the time comes title is not refused except in cases where the law so demand®, the risk© entailed in having Gand Settlement applied now are probably less than those which are run by allowing the matters to stand as they are. (e) That the rest of the draft reply is satisfactory and, if the present opportunity to reach agreement about the application of Land Settlement is allowed to pass, another may not occur again. 9. Although I cannot pretend that the above summary appreciation of the position covers all contingencies, I feel that the balance of argument lies on the side of the advantages of accepting the draft and, subject to Your Lordship’a own views, I think that, all things considered, it is best that I should Inform the Ministry that I have reason to believe that, if the draft is sent to me officially, it will be favourably received by my Government. At the same time, it would be desirable that I should warn the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that I foresee that HI® Majesty 1 a Government will stipulate that they must reserve the ri^it, in the event of the non-Iraqi nationality of the Shaikh (and / or his co-heirs) becoming the cause of impediment or delay in the grant to him (or them) of title deeds under Article 20 of the Lend Settlement Law, to take up the matter with the Iraqi Government, through the diplomatic channel. If a reservation of this kind is made His Majesty’s Government will7 7-eH' will be in a position later on should title be refused to the Shaikh by a Council of Ministers’ resolution or by a false inter pretation of the law, to bring pressure to bear on the Iraqi Government to change their attitude* I enclose a draft of a letter on these lines which I suggest X might be authorisied to send to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in reply to the letter in which he comrnunicates to me the document now under discussion. 3.0* In making the Above recommendations, I am also bearing in mind the fact that Mr* iden, in hie telegram ho. 120 of July 4th 1936, suggested the advisability of omitting the laet sentence of paragraph 8 of the note of July 8th 1936, and that it therefore appears that His Majesty's Government may not wish to insist on obtaining the assurance to which that sentence refers. 11. After the long delays which have occurred, it is desirable that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should be informed, as soon as possible, whether or not His Majesty’s Government would be willing to accept the proposed reply to Mr. Bateman’s note of July, 1936, and I accordingly request that I may be speedily informed of your wishes. desident in the Persian Gulf and to the olitical - gent at ^oweit.

After con^liments, In reply to your letter No. 114/2/1, dated 26th Dhil-Qa &gt; da lr354, there is no objection to the opening of the three roads mentioned in your letter, that is on » ''—I the road on the right side of 'Bungalow' the road on the bank of 'Shatt-al-Arab', and the road on the left side of Mohammad al-Khalifa*s river, but as regards the opening of the longwise and crosswise roads, it is kindly requested that they may be appointed and shown on the map, so that I may know their exact position. I I also request you to utilize the open space between the palm trees, which is the same width required for the roads, in which way you could open a road without causing damage to any of the p alm trees.■ ■M {yJ o-i I Translation of letter dated 26tii April 1938, from AMul-Jalil Partu, the agent of His Highness the Huler of Kuwait in Basra to the Port Director, Basra. After compliments, The representative at Fao of Shaikh Ahmed al-Jahir as-Subah, the Ruler of Kuwait, to whom I am working here as agent, informs me that the Port Department at Kao.has cut 320 palm trees from the gardens of the above, and shifted dust from under 1050 palm trees to build the road which is newly- opened to connect the old 'Qlshlah' with the desert, for which the above amount of damage to the palm trees was caused unlawfully. It is not hidden that the properties of the Ruler of Kuwait at Pao have been guaranteed by Great Britain in their agreement with the Kuwait Government before the publication of the Anglo-Iraq. treaty. The Anglo-Iraq. treaty dictates that Iraq, must respect the guarantees given by the British Government to others, and moreover there is a law in Iraq, called ’•The Possession Law” which must be observed, when any of the Government's Departments wants to open road, if we consider it politically lawful in such circumstances. I request you to give orders at once to stop the cutting and damaging which the Port Department is doing now, which is against the Iraq, treaty and the 'Possession Law', and also request you to begin to estimate the damage done to the above (landlord) by these actions, and the subsequent payment of its value to him.CONFIDENTIAL.

In particular, the correspondence concerns the Government of Iraq's decision to end the immunity from taxation (on the gardens) that had been granted by the British Government to the former ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubārak Āl Ṣabāḥ and the Shaikh of Mohammerah, Khaz‘al bin Jābir al-Ka‘bī in return for their military support against the Ottoman Empire in WW1.The correspondence discusses in detail a number of cases in the Iraqi courts regarding the gardens (by that time owned by the ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) and attempts made by British officials in Iraq and Kuwait to mediate between the two sides. In the correspondence, British officials discuss whether or not the British Government should compensate Shaikh Aḥmad for the amount of tax he had been forced to pay by the Government of Iraq and exactly what area of land was covered by the 1914 promise. More broadly, the correspondence is focused on how the disagreement can be settled permanently and whether an agreement incorporating border demarcations and anti-smuggling measures could form a part of any final settlement between Kuwait and Iraq.The file contains correspondence regarding the hiring of an Egyptian lawyer to assist in compiling the defence for Shaikh Aḥmad. Two Egyptian lawyers are discussed and hired: Tewfik Doss Pasha [Tawfīq Doss[?] Bāshā] and Ahmed Rushidi Bey [Aḥmad Rashīdī Bey]. The file also contains reports regarding the cutting down of trees on Shaikh Aḥmad's estates in Fao by order of the Iraqi authorities.The file contains the following documents:An English translation of a petition filed by Abdullah bin Issa Pasha Al Zuhair before the Basra Court of Instance against the heirs of Shaikh Mubarak Al Sabah (ff 60-63).An English translation of a court notice regarding the petition filed by Abdullah bin Issa Pasha Al Zuhair (as above) that appeared in the Basra newspaper,
