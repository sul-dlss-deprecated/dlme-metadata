The file notes near the end of the file (f 25) mirror the chronological arrangement. These notes are usually found at the end of a file, but in this instance, two further folios follow them.</extent><extent>Foliation: the main foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover and terminates at the inside back cover; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio. An additional foliation sequence is present in parallel between ff 1-27; these numbers are also written in pencil, and can be found in the same position as the main sequence, but they are not circled.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file’s contents are a result of changes made in 1948 to the administration of civil aviation in the Middle East, with the Persian Gulf, including the Arab coast of the Gulf, falling under the remit of the Civil Air Attaché in Baghdad. As a result of the change, B G Barnard, the Civil Air Attaché in Baghdad, requested from the Political Agency at Bahrain, comprehensive data on air traffic at Bahrain, with a detailed outline of the data required (ff 5-6). The bulk of the file is a copy of the data subsequently sent to the Civil Air Attaché (ff 7-23). This information includes: total movements (landings and take-offs) by month (April to October 1948); numbers of passengers, aircraft type, air operator and country, and nature of flight (military, scheduled, private) for each month; airport revenue derived from landing, parking and hangar fees; and numbers of overflying aircraft using radio facilities at Bahrain.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Civil Air Attaché, Baghdad</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000344#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
