Contraband foodstuffs in the Red Sea. A report of 6th September 1915, addressed to Admiral Peirse by Rear-Admiral Commandin.s: the detached naval division in Egypt - the latter of which has sent me a copy - mentions the singular anomaly which exists between a recent decision of the Indian Government sending to Jeddah 13,000 sacks of flour as well as divers other pro visions, and the orders given to the Red Sea station to confiscate foodstuffs specially destined for the Turks. As a consequence of this contradiction the Montcalm 11 and ^ Hardinge ,, have lately seized, on dhows coming from Jeddah, the one fifteen sacks and the other thirty sacks of the same flour disembarked at Jeddah with the assistance of the Government of India. In both cases the destination of the provisions cannot be doubted, it was to assist in the revictualling with flour the small Turkish posts on the Arabian coast, about then entirely deprived of this commodity. I should be obliged if at a convenient time you would draw the attention of the Admiralty to this state of things which does not fail to present serious inconveniences from various points of view.I (1 Cot 3V of Extract Montcalm, 6th December 1915. Rear-Admiral Huguet, Commanding Far Eastern Naval Division detached in Egypt to Vice-Admiral Sir R.Peirse, Commander in Chief of Naval Forces in Egypt. The Captain of 'Hardinge 11 has informed you in his last report of the anomaly which exists between the pro ceedings of the Indian Government which has lately sent to Jeddah 13,000 sacks of wheat flour (accompanied by a whole grocery outfit) - and the orders given to the Red Sea Station to confiscate foodstuffs specially destined for the Turks. Now wheat flour is specially destined for the Turks, and I am forbidden to seize it. The seizure of 15 sacks of flour made by Montcalm from a dhow which has been spoken of above, shows that it is, now Jeddah which, thanks to Indian Agents, revictuals with flour all the Turkish posts on the coast, at a time when the Turks were awaiting their flour from Syria. It had become very scarce and they were often run out of it. I point this out as you will appreciate that an end should be put to this contradiction. The 'Hardinge' is thus found in the position of seizing 30 sacks of flour on a dhow while under her eyes are disembarked 13,000 sacks at Jeddah- the whole authorised by the Government.\ 12 ] -*e~ In Any further communica tion on this subject, please quote / i 9 i 6 No and address— The Under-Secretary of State Foreign Office, -jv London.

In this connexion I am to refer to sir H. McMahon’s telegram of the 30th ultimo, communicated to you in my letter of the 6th instant, in which he expresses the opinion that the recent bombardment of Perirn would justify His Majesty’s Government in depart ing from previous assurances as regards Sheikh saiyid. A similar principle would apply a fortiori to the case of Arabian tribes definitely taking up arms against His Majesty’s Forces, and sir Edward Grey does not therefore consider The Under Secretary of state, India office.(91115/15) consider tnat the future action of His Majesty’s Government will be restricted by the assurances published in the pamphlet to the extent which nr. Secretary Chamberlain appears to apprehend. I- is clear, moreover, that these assurances in ao way preclude treaty arrangements with the various tribes of the Arabian peninsula. Sir Edward Grey therefore concurs in rr i i * Chamberlain’s proposal to inform the Government of India that the assurances of the Arabic pamphlet will be interpreted by His Majesty’s Government in the light of the above considerations, and that the publication of a similar announcement in Mesopotamia is unnecessary.

Nothing in the shape of formal proclamation has been issued. Purport of your telegram No. 173 of 14th April was communicated privately in certain quarters of Egypt and the Soudan, but no public announcement, as authorised in your telegram No. 262 of 20th May, has yet been made in either country. An unsigned' printed leaflet in Arabic has been d’stributed, as authorised in your telegram No. 274 of 21st May, on coast of Hedjaz by such aeroplanes and trading vessels as have been able to go there. It has not been distributed in the Soudan, hut a copy was sent to Senoussi. It was in the following terms :— “ To the people of Arabia : “ It is already known to you that we, the English, went to war with Germany because she attacked, without any provocation, small States upon her borders whose independence she had solemnly sworn to guarantee. “ You also know that Germany, being hard pressed, cunningly induced the Turkish Government to assist her. This she effected by lavish expenditure of gold and by lying promises. Her real object was to obtain a proclamation by the Sultan of Turkey of a Jehad against ourselves and our Allies; for under the protection of our Empire are many millions of Mahommedans, of whom thousands are now actually fighting in our armies, and Germany hoped that they would be induced to attack us and so afford her help. Surely every true Mahommedan must regard with loathing this cynical employment of his religion as an instrument to be used by a foreign Power for the furtherance of its own selfish ambitions. “ Mahommedan subjects of British Empire and of France, Russia, and her Allies have shown their view of the matter by supplying thousands upon thousands of troops to help us in fighting against the Turks and their deceivers, and even the more honourable of the Turks must realise the baseness of what has been done. “ Perhaps, however, there are those amongst you who ask what may be our intentions after the war is over. “ Lest there be any misunderstanding, let the following be known : — “ The Government of His Majesty the King of England and Emperor of India has declared when this war ends it shall be laid down in the terms of peace, as a necessary condition, that Arabian peninsula and its Mahommedan holy places shall remain independent. We shall not anne x one foot of land iryt , nor suffer any other Power to do so. Your independence of ^ all foreign control” is thus assured, and with such guarantees the lands of Arabia will, please God, return along the paths of freedom to their ancient prosperity. Surely this is sufficient. Certain Arab chiefs have already assured us of their desire to be rid of Turks, and some are assisting our troops with their swords. “ To those of you who wish us well, but are perhaps afraid to show their feelings, we say: ‘ Have no distrust of us ; wait for a favourable opportunity, and, when it comes, shake off the oppressor’s yoke, and we will support you to the full extent of our ability, and will, with God’s help, make you a truly independent people.’ “ But it must be with respect to your religion that you chiefly wish to know our attitude. [780—11]2 “ The religion of Islam, as history proves, will always be scrupulously respected by the British Government, and it is for this very reason that in the past we have befriended and assisted the Sultan of Turkey. Now that his venal Ministers have induced him to forget all gratitude and attack us that were h.s friends, he must accept the consequences; but our policy of respect and_ friendhness towards Islam remain^ unchanged. The latest proof of this is that we wished to assist the inhabitants of th Holy Cities and pilgrims with gifts of corn ; but German and Turkish officers seize ' the corn on its arrival at Jeddah, and thus forced us to cease sending corn for ouf enemies to f? group omitted] while the poor go hungry. , “In suite of this, His Majesty’s Government, having heard that pilgrims and innocent inhabitants are suffering grievously from want of food, and pww'd by compas sion and their continual friendship towards the Arabs, have now decided once more to allow food to be brought in by sea to Jeddah, and it wi 1 be for the Arabs themselves to ensure that this food is used for sustenance of themselves, and thens to prevent ns being seized by those who act contrary to the usages of [? war] and seek to take bread out of the mouths of the hungry.” If ffe k acts of tj ■®s seiz^' for ol &gt; prevent its From Viceroy, 2?&gt;rd June 1915. [i Foreign Secret. Arabia. Your telegram of the 19thWtimo. 1 have just seen substance of proclamation issued to Arabs in Arabia, Sudan and Western Desert on 13th June, presumably under the orders of the High Commissioner of Egypt. Paragraph b of this proclamation appears to go much further than was ever intended. Expression “ Arabian Peninsula” is open to serious misinterpretation and might be held to tie our hands in Oman and even to indicate intention to withdraw from Aden. General Nixon enquires whether similar proclamation should be issued in Mesopotamia, have replied in negative pending instructions. Generally speaking I maintain the opinion that any proclamation in Mesopotamia as regards our future intentions in Arabia would at present be premature and liable to misconstruction.CONFIDENTIAL.

Without forbidding pilgrimage, Egyptian Government propose to discourage it as far as possible by advice and by raising guarantee deposit required from pilgrims. Similar course last year proved practically equivalent to prohibition and produced no ill-feeling in Egypt, though it was represented by pan-Islamists at Constantinople as an act of hostility to Islam.

After fullest consideration we have decided, for reasons given in my telegram of 12th May, not to prohibit pilgrimage. Every effort will be made to discourage Mohammedan subjects from embarking on it, and to this end the support of the Sunni Princes and 11aj Committee throughout India will be enlisted. It is not anticipated that the number of pilgrims will be great or the political risks involved serious, A communique will shortly be issued on the subject, announcing that we cannot guarantee that pilgrims will be allowed to land at Jeddah, much less that they will be immune from molestation and hardships. We await a further communication from you on the subject of extending war insurance scheme to ships proceeding to Jeddah.

It is not desirable that large numbers of such should visit enemy country during war.

Admiralty piomise to advise me on this point in course of day or two.From Viceroy, \2th May 1915. (Repeated to Cairo.) Foreign Secret. Pilgrimage to Hedjaz. Reference to Education (?) telegram No. 314 of 11th March. Owing to arrival from other parts of India of pilgrims at Bombay it is desirable to decide the question forthwith. We are strongly of opinion that pilgrimage this year should if possible be carried out as usual. To forbid it definitely would offend Moslem opinion in India, give the impression of weakness vis a vis Turkey, and be incon sistent with our Proclamation regarding the Holy Places which stipulated that there should be no interference on the part of Turks with pilgrimage. There are, however, difficulties in regard to food supplies, guarantees to shippers and quarantine As regards food supplies, we have in accordance with your telegram of the 7th of May, resumed restricted supplies from India to Jeddah but we think that, if possible, guarantees should be obtained through neutral Power from Turkish Government to the effect that food supplies for pilgrims will not be diverted to other purposes. As regards guarantees to shipowners we conclude that the War Insurance Scheme would as before be held to cover ships proceeding to Jeddah. As regards quarantine at Kamaran, we think arrangements might be left as heretofore to Turkish Government, if prepared to undertake them. Their wishes might be ascertained through neutral Power. Were we forcibly to seize Kamaran and insist on performing quarantine arrange ments ourselves, this would doubtless drive Turks into active opposition to Foreign Secret.

It’s purport has been communicated where desirable in Soudan by Sirdar and also here in certain quarters in Egypt, Term 'independent sovereign State' has been in terpreted in a generic sense because idea of an Arabian Unity under one ruler recognised as supreme by other Arab Chiefs is as yet inconceivable to Arab mind * Position as regards Khaliphate in [ estern world and as far as we know in Arabia, excluding Turks themselves, is as follows:- general opinion appears in favour of an Arab Khaliphate popular choice would be doubtless Shereef of Mecca as being both a Koreish and possessor of Med3as, Sultan of Egypt I understand strongly advocates this. Prospects of Shereef largely depend on extent of public confidence in stability and independence of his possession of Hedjaz. Me is moreover as yet only known as candidate. At present there is a curious absence of general interest here with regard to question of Khaliphate. Moslem attention is concentrated on temporal as pects of events in Turkey and they will not probably awaken to effect on Khaliphate until even a considerable time after fall of Constantinople. CircumstancesCircumstances under which Sultan leaves Con stantinople will possibly influence them more than mere change of Ottoman capital itself. Any change of Khaliphate in immediate future is in my opinion more likely to cope about by individual action of a candidate than through previous manifestation of Moslem opinion,. Success of Sliereefnas Khalif would appear desir able in best interests of Moslem world and incident ally to our interests also, but any attempt to in fluence Moslem opinion would be obviously harmful. All we can usefully do to assist SliereefTpros pects is to increase public confidence in our deter mination to safeguard welfare of independence and integrity of Hedjaz. Undue delay in settlement of Khaliphate will produce rival claimants which seems undesirable for reason that they will each seek Moslem support at our expense by competitive display of ante-Christian attitude.COPY TELEGRAM.- C.-in-O., East Indies, Port Said. 17/5/15.

Your telegram No. 129 (of March 23rd) Reported famine in the Yemen.- We distrust proposal of Turkish Government. They are levying pecuniary contributions from Arabs and tneir army is reported to be suffering severely from lack of funds. We fear that, even if Italian authorities could distribute money properly in first instance, this money would pass immediately after wards from their control. What Arabs really need is not money but food, and this need we are ourselves taking steps to supply. You should speak in above sense to Minister for Foreign Affairs and ask him to proceed no fur ther with his proposal.From Resident, Aden, 26th March 1915.

Yemen certainly devastated by locusts. W e are sending far more convov(s) from Aden than ever. I hese supplies go across the border to Turkish Arabs in the Lnva of Taiz to aid ilawia sheikh with whom we have recently concluded agreement. 1 would suggest as a political measure that extra supplies (be) sent from tiere instead of allowing Turks (to) supply Yemen. Cash sent by them probably intended more foi their own troops and for Imam and (it) would be easy after a while for their local authorities (to) dispense with Italian control. ^ T' 6 'I^ a ° come forward as friend of Arabs. Our former supplies to Mecca made a great impression among Arabs and Imam.

Your telegram oi 25th March, e are inclined to agree with view of Resident at Aden stated in his telegram No. 43 A.P. of 26th March. From report of late Consul. Hodeida, we know Lurkish authorities in Yemen are embarrassed for want of funds. Arabs require food not money, and it is distress of Arabs not of Turkish authorities we desire to help. Although therefore we see no serious military objection to proposed remittance if distress under effective control of Italian authorities, which would be difficult to insure, we think situation will more suitably be met by^ despatch of extra supplies from Aden to hinterland.

No port clearances are now given for above Turkish ports and if dhows from Aden are found enter ing these prescribed areas they are to be seized, it is not a (sic) desirable differentiate(ion) between Turkish and Arab flags as all dhows are Arab owned end it is our policy to estrange the Arabs from Turks.

Stoppage of imports to these ports cannot greatly affect Turkish garrisons who are already comparatively isolated and who in any case will subsist on inhabitants, but it will undoubtedly hit Arabs hard and give rise to suspicion and discontent . Thus any slight advantage from a military point of view would be gained at expense of alienating Arab sympathy.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government, and should be returned to the Foreign Office when d one with unless required for official use.] JlYv..T rnADi: AND TREATY .

You should inform Naval Authorities that until last pilgrims have left Jeddah, policy of His Majesty’s Gov ernment regarding importation of foodstuffs is that set forth in my telegram No. 429 (of 18th.

Objects of these patrols will be to stop supplies going to Turkish garrisons and purely Turkish ports such as Hodeidah, Mokha, Loheiya, to prevent mine-laying, to stop troops or agents being sent across to Egypt or the Soudan coasts, and to reassure and get into touch with Arab sheikhs in Arabia. A British officer with experience of dealing with Arabs will accompany each patrol as political adviser, and upon these officers will devolve duty of informing Arab chiefs of policy decided on by His Majesty’s Government. . , , a Inadvisability of interfering more than is absolutely necessary with Red bea coast trade has been emphasised. Any such action would be deeply resented, and Idrisi especially is most jealous of his ports and commerce. ^ It is also imperative to abstain from any hostile operations, and it such are absolutely unavoidable they should only be directed against Turkish military forces, and, in any case, Jeddah and Yambo should be excepted, being regarded as holy cities.
