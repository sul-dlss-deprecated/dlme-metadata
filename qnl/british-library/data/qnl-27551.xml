Sulaiman al Baruni al Nafusi. Sir, I have the honour to say that His Highness the Sultan has asked me to arrange for facilities for one Sulaiman al Baruni to come to Muscat should he so desire. Tie has done so at the man’s own request. I think he only wishes to he able to write to Sulaiman al Baruni that he has made this request and that I am addressing my govern - ment about it. I have told him I am doing so. I attach translations of Sulaiman’s letters to the Sultan. I gather from them that his chief object is net to come to Muscat but to collect documents likely to increase his importance. Al Baruni indicates the man’s tribe. Al Nafusi indicates his place of origin which I am told is Nafusah in Tunis. What his actual rationality is I do not know. He seems to claim three nationalities Turkish, French and Italian. He has never been to Muscat but corresponded with His Highness Saiyid Faisal and has corresponded with the present Sultan and with others. Like them he is an Ibadhi by© Translation of a letter dated 21st November 1922 from Sulaiman al Baruni al Nafusi (inhabitant of Nafusah in Tunis, Africa), Lausanne, to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat, Muscat, After Compliments, Perhaps you may have heard what changes happened in our parts. I left Constantinople for Lausanne, the place where the general peace conference began the other day. It is hoped that it produces results which may rid the world of disturbances and destructions. As it is impossible for me to return to Tripoli at this time owing to not getting help from Italy I intend to travel in tlie East and specially your country (may it flour' h.sh) which I have always been longing to see, since a long time, to so? pay my respects to Your Majesty. It may releive me of my troubles and terrors of the war which I see in my heart. Possibly the English Embassy might object to grant a passport to me therefore it is requested that if I send you a telegram about it you may ask the British Consul at your place to inform the Foreign Office in order to facilitate it, I pray God to give you long life and help you in your rule. Anen. P. S. This letter was delayed with me till I reached from Lausanne to Naples. I again requested the Italian Govern ment to allow me to go to Tripoli but they refused in these days. Now I will go either to Angora or Constantiiiople. u.E.7th RaM II 1341 Translation of a letter dated , 7~~~ ^rd December 1922. from Sulaiman al Baruni al ITafusi (inhabitant of Rafusah in Tunis, Africa), Lausanne, to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Muscat. After Compliments, I have sent the other day a letter to Your Majesty regarding my journey to the Daot. How it is necessary for me that I would state to Your Majesty that the revolution (changes) in Turkey was the result of the late sultan’s taking protection ifith the English and it brought an end of the Parliament of which I was a member. Por this reason I intended to remain away from Constantinople till matters were put right. But Italy does not permit me to Tripoli and the Xrench do not allow me to go to Tunis or any other place of their possessions, and the English are more severe than these both, and so I shall return to Angora after two days. As there is an old feud between me and Ahmad al Sanussi at Angora and probably I cannot get ease there with them. How there is no place of shelter for me after them except your wide place till peace is concluded and I may be allowed to return to Tripoli. Consequently I pray from Your Majesty’s mercy only this one thing. You may ask about ray coming to you by telegram which may be sent to the Prench Ambassador or you may ask the Consul at your place to write to his ambassador about your good wishes and that ambassador rnay inform me about it. I am waiting for it after the arrival of this my letterto your goodself. The telegram may remain with me for requirement, and if I am compelled to travel I will use it. But if I get ease I will keep it as a historical valuable remembrance. I asked Your Majesty about this so that the people may know that I have got some other them them with whom I may ask for help if it is required. I have written this in hni haste© After the fighting took place in the hills of ITafusah and ruin ed many places last year victory has come to our people who have turned out their opponents. The places have flourished, the peace has established and it has rained much in these days and thanks are to God for this.

In this letter he stated that, according to a letter which he had received from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman, the Indian Government had telegraphed to me authorising me to visa his passport for Muscat, end he asked me to r®ply to his letter through the Representative here of the Angora Ministry of foreign Affaire. 2. as no communication had reached this high Commission or the Consulate-General from the Government of India, and as in any ceea I was unwilling to correspond with Buleiman-el-Baruni through Adnan Bay in reply to a direct letter, I took steps to ascertain unofficially whether Adnan Bey had any interest in the matter. I found that he knew no-;hing of the business and believed Bulalman-el-Borunl to have already left Angora, travelling to some European destination via Constantinople, Adnan Bey’s as'-'istant to whom Mr. Ryan mentioned the matter spoke of Suleiman-el-Baruni with some contempt. In these circumstances T decided to take no action or. his letter. 3. Suleiman-el-Berun-!, though a person of consequence In hie own pert of Northern Africa enjoys little consideration in this country. He was a member of the Turkish senate until last November when It, with the Constantinople Government, ceased to exist.

This individual reached LIuscat from the interior of Oman on the 7th of karch. At his instigation the Sultan of Muscat wired to the French Consul at Bombay for permission for him to go to Tunis: this was refused. Baruni has now asked the Khalifa Committee in Cairo to use their influence to get permission for him to bnter Egypt. The Sultan is anxious that he should leave Muscat as early as possible and the Government of India have been asked to suggest a suitable destination to which he can be sent. As he is, in theory at any rate, an Italian subject, the Government of India wish to know whether the Italian Government would allow him to return to Tripoli.

With reference to the letter from this department of the ICth April I am directed by Secretary Sir Austen Chamberlain to request you to inform the T ari of Birkenhead that the Counsellor of the Italian T mbasay called some days ago and stated that the Italian Government prepared to allow Suleiman al Paruni ou reside in Italy as they regard him as an It lian subject under the te;ms of the Royal Decree of 6th April, 1912. They will however on no account allow him to return to Libya and will only agree to his being sent to Italy on condition th t adequate steps are taken to prevent his making any attempt to slip away to Tripoli. They are therefore anxious that he should, if possible, be put on board a ship bound direct for an Italian port c, nd that arrangements should be made to watch -him during the voyage. 2. If lord Birkenhead sees no objection, Sir A.Chamberlain ifrould suggest that enquiries should be made of the Govern- ment of India re to whether arrantements can be m de for the removal of this man, in accordance with Hie above conditions, end that such arrangements ' s m y be possible should be kbouxi communicated to him for the information and approval of the Italian Government.

Sir With reference to your telegram NO 421 dated the 3rd July 1926 to the Govt of India, I have the honour to state that Sulaiman Pasha al Baruni is now the guest of the Imam ,Muhammad bin Abdullah al K^alili at Semail.

Lupin for Aden en route to Britrea or any aitax place other than Tunis or Tripoli. In Oman, Sulaiman Pasha 3aruni is honoured as an Ibadhi leader and is housed and fed alternately by the Sultan and the Imam. Aden or Eritrea would have no advantage unless as a stepping stone to reunion with his ( family, which he gires out to be his greatest wish. j His Highness is glad that the period of his own Ibadhi country. He is however terrified that Baruni anti#- British language Pasha may be guilty of someor action, that may bring Muscat into bad odour with the British Gort.

Urgent. il^DiA OFFICE, tfKITEHAEL, London, 24th July 1926. Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to your letter of the 14th July, i o.J. 1901/192/66, relative to the question of the future movements of Suleiman el Baruni, who is at present at muscat. in the Earl of Birkenhead's view the problem for which the Political Resident, Bushire, and the Government of India have hitherto been seeking a solution has been to find some . destination to which Suleiman el baruni is village to *o and where the local authorities are prepared to allow him to come. From your letter and its enclosure, however, it appears that the Secretary of State for ^oreisrn Affairs now sup^ests tnat el baruni mip-ht, whether with his own consent or not, be conveyed from f.uscat to Aden and there removed to an Italian ship. Lord Birkenhead understands that the view is taken that, since el Baruni is an Italian subject, it is incumbent upon the Italian Government to decide what action should be taken in regard to hi^# and the suppestion embodied in the draft telep-ram forwarded with your letter is made with the object of obtaining a definite decision from taat overnment. His Lordship does not desire to raise any objection to this su^mestion an i he amrees with Sir listen Chamberlain that, provided the action suprmested is taken at the request of the Italian Government, lemal diiiiculties are not to be anticipated. it is however essential, in his opinion, that there should be no delay in handing the man over at ~den i i Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. 1 an(an operation which he considers should present me difficultyy as otherwise serious le/ral difficulties mitfit arise if it were deemed necessary to detain him on shore. Lord Birkenhead therefore concurs generally in the draft telegram which it is proposed to send to His Majesty’s Ambassador at Home. He would surest, however, the insertion of the words 'So desire and if they' after the word'Governmen t in the second line of the final paragraph, in order to make the responsibility of the Italian Government still clearer, and also the omission of the words 'and suggests that Italian ship should fetch him from there'. This suggestion, strictly speaking, has not emanated from the Political Resident, who merely suiypested the possibility that el aruni mi^ht go from Men to Eritrea if his consent and the permission of the Italian Government could be obtained. 1 have, etc., Sd/- L.D.WakelyTelegram to Sir H, Graiiara (Home)# Foreign Office, 36th July, 1926# ITo.199 (H).

Africa. He began by playing into the hands of the Italians as did most of the Berbers largely out of racial antagonism to the Arabs. He was most probably bought by the Italians soon alter or before the occupation of Tripoli and successfully sued Mr. Maclure, then M Times M correspondent in Tripoli and Italy* for iibel. He next turned against the Italians, contrary to most of the Berbers, and threw in his lot with the Arabs during the 1914-1915 revolution, becoming involved with the Ramadan Bhetewi - Abdurrahman Azam combination at Misurata. When the Turks in the course of the war sent a prince of royal blood to Misurata to regain the sympathy of the natives of Tripolitania, Suleiman el Baruni was appointed wazil of tne Vali of Tripolitania (namely the Prince). The Turks failed to establish their position and surrendered 'when the end of the war occurred, by which time Suleiman el Baruni had already become a prominent member of the Confederation of Tripolitan Tribes, ostensibly as representative of the Berber element in the coui:try which, hov/ever, so profoundly mistrusted him that his self- appointed position became untenable. He was equally disliked by the Arabs because he is a Berber. The Italians after they proclaimed the Constitution of the country attempted to use him as a M mudir’' but without success; he was then aiming at becoming Smir of Jeoel lefusa (Tripolitan Jebal). Soon after this he left for Switzerland via Italy and got into touch with the League of Oppressed lotions and then to Constantinople. He returned to Tripoli again without having achieved much. He is an intriguer and not a very successful one. In any case he is undesirable. ffii .iiXTHACT from Summary No* 691, dated Turkey the 23rd May 1922. ?r% j/.I t OF T TS T^IPQLITAij SULi^I^AlI i£L BARUNX , It was reported in Summeiry 1]q. 664 that Suleiman el Baruni, a Tripolitan, who is believed to be an Italian Secret Service a^ent, arrived in Constantinople during April last, and was endeavouring to obtain permission to proceed, to Angora. Jil Baruni 1 s presence in Constantinople, and the fact that he uesires to proceed to Anatolia, have been confirmed by a good local source, according to whom, the Tripolitan recently sent a personal telegram to Mustafa Kemal, stating that he had important matters to discuss with the latter. B1 Baruni from Angora, and it appeared doubtful whether Mustafa Kemal would consent to his proceeding there. It appeared possible that the lack of success attending Baruni’s efforts to enter Anatolia, were due to the influence of the Sheikh el Senussi at Angora. The Sheikh el Senussi is known to detest B1 Baruni, on account of the nature of the latter’s activities in Tripoli. S.I.S. * 31 Baruni is ex-benator for Tripoli, and belongs to the sect known as Ahl-el-Khamis. He has in the past played the role of an adventurer, and there appears to b e no doubt that he is a paid agent of the Italians, who are reported to have used him in causing inter-tribal friction, ml Baruni is also reported to have been in close touch with the ex-Khedive, Abbas Hilmi, and to have been engaged in Abbadite activities generally in Tripoli* Note* His request to visit Bombay and Muscat was twice refused in 1923 the High Commissioner, Constantinople, giving it as his opinion on the second occasion that he should not be en couraged to travel in British Moslem Dependencies. In 1926 he reached Muscat from the interior of Oman and undertook to stay there for a period of seven years as Finance Minister of the Imam of Oman. He has given no trouble during his stay in Oman.Confidential Ho* 2806*1^30• From.

On the strength of the Sultan's statement I issued the debited letter. Al Baruni arrived in Muscat on August S6th and shortly after, it was reyorted to me, had been ayyointed to a yost in the emyloy of the Muscat Governs.nt. On my return from recess therefore I looked up tto Agency filee about this nan and aiso had a talk about him with the Sultan, who has now written me a letter on the subject of which a ooyy is enciossd.3. ixic records siiow tliat al or»n-s • , ^^ ax Baruni is an adventure of the 'notorious ,, tvoe whn who for nan/ years both before during and after the Great •ar was a well known person in the Middle Bast, Tide enclosures to Bushire flesidenoy Confidential letter Ho. 410-8 of Uth August 1930.

Summary Ho. 691 of 23rd Hay 1922 which formed part of the abovementioned enclosures. The Sultan, however, informs me that al Baruni states he is not now allowed by the Italian Government to return to his Home in Tripoli which he is desirous of doing and that his arrival in Muscat and his appointment to a post under the Muscat Government was mentioned recent ly in the Arabic broadcast from the Italian Radio Station at Bari. Had he still beeen in their employ it is hardly ii e iy tnat the Italians would have thus announced his movements • Prom 1924 to 1932 al Baruni was in the Oman being employed by the Imam as his Financial Adviser. He lei t the country of his own accord# In 1934 the present Sultan wrote to the Political Agent and ashed that this individual should not be given a visa to return to Muscat. His Highness in his talk with me about the matter said that he had taken this action on account of an impertinent letter he had received from al Baruni when the latter was in the Oman; he had now, he went on to say, decided to forgive him and had sumnoned him to Muscat with a view to \ giving him an appointment in the State as he considered that for certain internal administrative work, in view of the \ fact that he belonged to the Ibadhi Sect, he would be of considerable use. The Sultan said that whatever political intriguesintrigues al Baruni may j^ve been oonoerned with in ^ past he was now a broken old man of over sixty (which age in the Sultan's eyes is very oldl) and was thankful for a a Ve ‘‘ in V ‘ Illc ' a t0 ' / i&gt;03B the remainder of his days since he was forbidden by the Italian Government from returning to his Home in Tripoli, 4. it will be seen from the Sultan's letter that he is evidently anxious not to employ al Baruni if His Bajesty Government do not desire it and he is careful to mention that his wor* will be confined to matters concerning the internal administration of the State. I can find nothing in the Agency records to show lhat this nan was ever sus pected of anti British activities and I certainly do not thmx that he will ever become as objectionable as the present head of the Utate Courts, Hasasi, a Palestine Arab time *ho for some considerable/pa at has not troubled to conceal his riolent antipathy to a 11 things British, believe the Sultan's real object in bringing back al Baruni to his State is / part of an ambitous pro ject on fchich I have for long suspected the Sultan has set his heart* the expulsion of the Imam and the eventual resumption by the kuscat Government of control over the whole of its territory. As mentioned above this man is of the Ibadhi Sect to which practically the whole of the inhabitants of the Oman belong. It seems he is by way of being a holy man and is said to have had ^ considerable influence for reli- gous reasons over the Omanis during the period he spent there in the employ of the Imam, The Sultan's policy for sometime past has been to make overtures to Shaikhs and Leaders of the Oman in outlying parts of that district whom he has reasons to believe- 4 - teliere are dissatisfied with the loam's rule. The Imam's authority and control over the tribes of the Oman is very largely, if not entirely, based on his position as a religous leader.

However you might keep an unobstrucive eye on Baruni and let us know in due course what you can of his activities.

He had an interview wi the Political Agent and asked the latter's permission to ^isit Sultan in India. He was refused visa for India. In ^O ctober of the same year he proceeded to t ie Interiof oi Oman with the consent of the Sultan. At that time it was known that proceeded to Oman on religious grounds only. In March 1925 Baruni returned from Oman to Muscat. During his absence in Oman an invitation from King Faisal was received through the High Commissioner, Baghdad, to Baruni to give a short visit to his old acquaintance (King Fnisal), and he was told of it by the Political Agent. Baruni expressed his desire to stay a short time in Iraq, and then proceed to Tunis. During his residence in Muscat the Baruni continued to write articles against Ibn Saud, and Saiyid Muhammed(bin Turki? ) warned him to be cautious in his writing against others. In 1926 he ag^in visited the interior of Oman, and returned to Muscat in March 1936. In 1926 the Italian Ministry of Colonies received information that Suleiman Baruni sent a word to his relatives in Tripoli (Lybia) to the effect that he feels confident of his success to reach Northern -Africa It that time, and his intention was to proceed via Egypt. He first instigated the Sultan, who wired to the ffrench Consul for permission for him to proceed to Tunis. This request was refused. Being an Italian ' subject, the Government of India, tried to send him to an Italian state. The Sultan ol Muscat was duiing that ^ time anxious that Baruni should leave Muscat a*s early as possible.

It appears that Baruni has informed His Highness that 2 he intends to leave ifescat ostensibly for medical treatment in Iraq, but in reality to try and gat aa naar to Tripoli aa be can ao that in tfaa event of Italy entering the war he will be in a position to take advantage of such opportunities as may offer with the idea of eventually regaining eome at least of hie old Influence in Tripoli. 3. has addressed a letter to the French Foreign Minister outlining his own career and making tha most of his power to influence events in Tripoli. H e has pointed out that there are soma 30,000 of hia old adherents in Tunisia and has suggested that ha should go to Tunis now so as to be ready to act should Italy become involved with France. He has asked that the French Government should assist him in his endeavaura, presumably financially, and has expressed hie willingness to go to Paris or Syria to discuss the situation with them. His Highness has» 2 - ! f U promised to lot me have a copy of Baruni'o letter to the French Government and as soon as I receive it I will forward a copy to you* 4* 1 understand from His Highness that Baruni wished me to he informed of his proposed movements and asked that I he acquainted with the contents of his letter to the French Govern ment in which I understand he has asked that their reply may he addressed to him through me. 5. His Highness the Sultan has told Baruni that he thinks that there is little chance of the French Government acceding to his request unless Italy actually decides to enter the war as an ally of Germany. Baruni has announced his intention of leaving his family in safety here and going to Iraq whatever reply the French Government give. It is doubtful if he will even wait for a reply. 6. I explained the delicacy of the situation with regard to Italy at present and informed His Highness that I would communicate with you at once. I asked the Sultan to make a particular point of keeping the matter secret and he promised to do so* 7 # The French Government, I have no doubt, are hotter able to estimate Baruni's usefullness and the advisibility of iwnk^ n ^ r use of him than I am. It might be as well, if you thought fit^o ma fr* it clear that his reference to this Consulate does not in any way indicate that I have been privy to his plans until now or that they have the benediction of the British Representat ive here* Baruni is too old for active work in the Sultan*s opinion and has deteriorated mentally during the last year.

The object of the gathering was to consider the situation of our brothers, who fled to different countries of the east, at the presenl moment when the atmosphere is cloudy and all nations are busy in determinig their own safe course in order to xeep their boats steady from sinking and entering into the waters of false propaganda. After much discussion and in view of the existing circumstances, it was unanimously decided, firstly, that the democratic front was worse for our brothers in the east and secondly, that absolute faith, by the signatories of this letter, was to be put in Amir Syed Muhammad Idris A1 Sanusi to represent us all* All our brothers are to ■eirmvjmic be of this.

It seems that he is suffering from eye trouble and wishes to consult an occulist in Bombay, the Sultan has suggested that if the grant of a visa is sanctioned Baruni should not be infomed until the dultan hiiaself leaves for India to consult an occulist. The Sultan hopes to leave for India shortly after his return from Dhofar, as the local medical diagnosis of trachoma in the left eye has alarmed him and I have advised him to obtain expert specialist opinion without delay. The Sultan considers that if Baruni accompanies him he will be able ; to a certain extent,to keep him under observation. I suggest that X be permitted to grant a visa and that in accordance with the sultan’s wishes Baruni is not informed until the Sultan himself considers desirable.

I received your letter of the 16th Muharram in an opportune moment and was very glad to *now of the acti vities of our countrymen in Tunis and of their future plan for the welfare of their country. I a m still more glad to learn that the responsibilities of presidentship have been placed on you. This I hnew from our brother Anmad Zarem, cier*: of the Association. May God bless and help you in your undertaking and may He grant us -the opportunity of meeting in our dear native country which we had to leave. Surely it is not difficult to God. Since a long time I have been trying to get leave to go to Tunis for treatment and shortly I will leave for India. I hope to return soon and to see that the way of lunis is open ior me. hlease let me know if anything new happens to you. As for news of Tunis and of our dear country, mostly I hear them from radio. I am very sorry to hear the latest news about scarcity of rain and famine. Everything is in the hand of God. I have received letters from our brothers of Syria and Egypt and I am glad to learn that they have formed an association with Syed Idris Al Sanausi as its president. It is desirable that both the associations remain in touch with one anothe., to exchange their ideas and each should show its acti vities and plans to the other so that they may shape a united thought and aim. As for a binding between the two associations for work, I do not find it possible or fruitful as both of them are under the supervision of different„governments. Hence it is necessary that each association should act according to the guidance oi the- 2 - the government under which it is. In view of the distance oetween the seats of the two associations and their separation, no correspondence will be possible without the knowledge of those governments. So, common action and binding of the two associations are not possible. Moreover the war is bringing in changes every hohur, nay, every moment. It depends on the condition of the country in which the association is and the in-migrants are. As to the immigrants living in the east, such as Hejaz and Syria, their participatior in the association'^.will be advisable on account of nearness of places and facilities of communications, if they want to act for the same cause and if Tunis is not near from their places. I have given my opinion to the assocxation of Egypt. Please convey my respects to my brotners and to one and each of the members of the association and particularly to my brother Ahmad Zarem, cleric of the association. I have received his letter but for want of time for the mail I could not reply but God willing, hope to write to him by the next mail.
