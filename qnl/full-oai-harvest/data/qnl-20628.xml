Kemball reports that the amicable arrangements reached at Sohar between His Highness and the Wahhābī commander ‘Abdullāh bin Fayṣal have led to plans for the levy being abandoned. Kemball makes mention of a similar scheme, brought to his attention by the Native Agent at Sharjah; a capitation tax, levied in that town against non-Muslims, which amounted to five or six rupees per person per annum, and which gave non-Muslims immunity against military service and other ‘feudal obligation’. Kemball requests the Government’s views on the scheme.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024051557.0x00001d#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
