At. atooivt 1 pvm. we returned 'bo Tjhe sliip which prGceeded alone: ■uhe coast, 'bo Lalala, a di^uance of ^56 miles. The ^amhan rane:e of* hills ai&gt; ^urba'0 is abou'U b miles from bhe coast, and, at, a distance of seven or eight miles to the west it draws nearer to the sea beiner in places not more than a mile from the shore. 'I'he hills, from beine; bare and rocky, gradually become covered with patches of trees and what we subsequently found to be grass withered by a hot sun and the absence of rain- 'The change was very striking and it was difficult, after the rocks and cliffs of Muscat and ^ur, to believe that it could be the same coast. Eighteen miles from Murbat is the village of Taka ( (/U* ) which consists of about r/J huts wiUa one stone building, and about 5 miles further on the hills drop back at the Eastern extremity of the Lhufar plain and the cliff, 100 feet in hie-ht which lines a the shore between Taka and this pointy abruptly breaks off. From here to the village of Dahariz ( ), 7 miles from Lalala, at which point the hills are 10 miles from the coast, ■uhe shore is lined by a mangrove swamp half a mile deep. ..e reached ^.alala ax. about* ct* bO p.m. where Xihe ^.ultjan's streamer the 'Kur-ul-Bahar' was already at- anchor. dis jiehness hawing ■oaken up quarters in t,he fort, ashore our visit, to him was deferred: until the following day. ■onday lath Eecember. At about 7. a.m. we landed, fhe t^t^ioh here xs exposed, and there is a heavy surf on the beach all the year round,which makes landing difficult and unpleasant,, the services of a catamaran or masula boat have to be employed which reminded us of landing on parts of the Madras coast. Vfe found His highness the J.ultan comfortably housed in the fort of £.alaj.a^which was built some years ago by his Wali Euiaiman bin Luwailim to whom considerable praise is due for general improvement in this district. It is a substantial 5 storied building about 100 yards from the shore,with a compound covering about an acre of ground and surrounded by the usual wall with a largeerrDrance and t?at;eway looking eastward. Ou'Dside t»he fart is an enclosed bazaar cont/ainine; half a dozen shops where rice and grain imported from Bembay are sold^as well as frankincense, cocoanuts, maize, tobacco and cotton, the local produce; and, near the bazaar, a few huts, the whole making a small village known as 'Al ^itf^Ln f &gt; or ,,llt3:ie Fort ' ,, • Luring the course of our visit to the Sultan ^is Jighness shewed us some large black and yellow spiders brought from the Lamhan hills which he said were supposed to produce silk., xhese insects, which were still alive, were examined by us,but the opinion of an expert would be required to estimate the value of the thread of which thf^/web is composed^ It appeared to be strong and was of the bright golden colour of ordinary silk- l : he visit to ^iis highness over, we set out, accompanied by an escort to explore the neighbourhood to the East. About half a mile from A1 ^fisan lies the village of ^lafa ( ) which e?rtends a quarter of a mile along the coast and contains perhaps 150 houses of mud and stone, many of which are uninhabi^ted and in a bad state of repair. :he inhabitants, numbering about 5.00, »» y/ I ' *&gt; s/ belong to the Lhanafirah ( J/^ W ' !:I0 were originally of the •Bani Awamir but&gt; have emigrated Louth and are now considered as a section of the A1 Kathir tribe.
