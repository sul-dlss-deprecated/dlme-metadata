I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Louis Mallet. s Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.October 1st, 1914. Monsieur le Ministre:- I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of the Note No.96 dated September 27th. by which Your Highness requests me to instruct the Directors of the British Post Offices established in the Ottoman Empire to act in accordance with the communications which have been addressed to them by officials of the Imperial Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs with a view to their ceasing their operations from to-day onwards. The fact that a measure of such importance affecting an official department of His Majesty’s Govern ment should have been adopted in virtue of a unilateral decision of the Sublime Porte and that effect has been given to the measure in so precipitate a manner, compels me to formulate the most express reservations both as to the procedure followed and as to the principle underlying the Highness Prince Said Halim Pasha, Grand Vizier and Minister of Foreign Affairs.the question. With a view to avoiding incidents of a public nature I have Instructed the British Post Offices in the Empire to suspend their ordinary postal operations from to-day onwards. By so doing and by authorising a verbal exchange of views, in order to mitigate the inconvenience, resulting from this suspension, I must not be considered to have prejudiced the question of principle. It will be for my Government to consider what further action shall be taken in the matter. I avail myself, &amp;c., (Signed) Louis Mallet.From Viceroy, 12£/? October 1914.

(September 30, 7'45 p.m.) MY telegram No. 878 of 27th September. Arrangements have partly broken down, as my French and Russian colleagues on reconsideration objected to presence of a Turkish official in then offices^ under any circumstances. In consequence of this refusal, Turkish Government decline to allow our offices to deal with any incoming mails after to-day. They say they will open such mails in the presence of a consular representative if the postal administration in the country of origin authorises it. Otherwise they will send the bags back. French Ambassador has just received instructions to resist closing of his post office, but my Russian colleague and I do not propose to follow suit. Russians propose to transfer winding up operations to Embassy or consulate-general. It is too late to work out a common line of action, and the whole question is one of transitory import ance once we have decided to close the offices. I have therefore acted on considerations of practical convenience, and instructed British postmaster to wind up outstanding business at the Galata office within fifty-five days. He can probably do this, and transfer lease of premises to Ottoman authorities by 31st October. I have told him formally to claim delivery of incoming mails of 12th July addressed to him, but not 22nd July, resist [? ing] if Turks take possession. .

It was simply to do away with an ancient practice (the 'deille habitude' referred to by Tewfik asha) by which all bags lor India made up by the Turkish ffices in those places, and containing jaatter entrusted to those offices, are handed over to t*ie British Offices to ihe Kight honourable oir 'E. Gray, Jart., K.Cr., ...P*, etc •, e tc *, etc.to oe lonvarded. i'je Turkiaa toverniaent desire that in future they suould be allowed to make their own arrangement for forwarding these bags and that the Indian Postal Authorities should receive them for delivery in India or ior transit as tde case may be, in spite oi* taeir not having passed through the iritish Oiiices. Should enquiry in India coniirm this account oi the ancient practice reierred to, I venture to think t'iat the request of the Turkish Government cannot oe rejected without claiming lor the British Oifices in Jagdad and dasra a great deal more than is claimed ior them elsewhere in the Empire, without claiming, in fact, a monopoly of the despatch oi mails irom those places to India and certain other countries, and it appears to me that such an attitude on our part mi/^it justiiiably be resented as a failure to recognise Turkey's position as a member oi the rostal Union . by acceding to the request, ais majesty's Govern ment would be in no wise consenting to any curtailment oi the safeguards availaole for those £or whom the dritish Post Offices primarily exist or indeed for any person who chooses to entrust his correspondence to the Gritish Oificea TheThe position of the latter has, on the contrary, gained fresh recognition by the terms of toe secret dec laration signed by aakki Pasha on Decemoer 12th last. The request contained in the letter from the Turkish director of i'osts, copy of wtich was enclosed in your despatcu .&lt; 0 . 409, is not germane to the subject of the present despatch and it has reference only to an alter native postal route via Constantinople to dagdad, which the Turkish Administration believes to compare favourably with the sea route normally followed by the Sn ( -lish mails, mis is a matter entirely within the province of ilis majesty's Po 't-.iaster General. I may, however, suggest that this alternative route, though perhaps not yet as perfect as is claimed for it, does offer considerable ad vantages; and that, by making it generally known that it was available as an alternative route for persons desirous oi using it loi course at their own risk) ilis majesty's i'03tiaaster General would sttow t*jat nig iiajegty’s Croveminont are not actuated by any desire to monopolise tne carriage oi mails, even tuou^ they do not yet consider the time ripe lor tae abolition of Jritish Post Offices in this country.

S 1 .f diuh reference to the 2nd paragraph of your letter of the 21at ultimo, No.32138A4, on the subject of the carriage of Mails between Bagdad, Basra and India, I am directed by the Postmaster General to afford the following explanation of the apparent discrepancy between the opinions expressed in the letters from this Office of the 14th ultimo, No.135780 and of the 2nd of June 1913 No. 101334. Although in the last mentioned letter the Post master General expressed his concurrence in the proposed abolition of the British Postal Agencies in Turkey subject to certain conditions, he had as a matter of fact in mind the Agencies maintained by the Imperial Post Office in the Levant and not those maintained at Basra and Bagdad by the Government of India. The letter from this Office of the 14th ultimo on the other hand had reference solely to these Indian Post Office Agencies. For those Agencies, as Sir E. Grey is aware, the Imperial Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.Imperial Post Office is not in any way responsible and at the present date has no special interest in their maintenance. In view, however, of future possibili ties it was thought desirable to inform the Secretary of State that the attitude of the British Post Office towards these Agencies might not in the future be one of indifference. The Postmaster General does not feel justified in opposing the acceptance in principle for adequate political reasons of the abolition of the Indian as well as of the British Agencies. But for the reasons stated in the Post Office letter of the 14th ultimo the Postmaster General trusts that, even if the abolition of the Indian Agencies is accepted in princi pie, this acceptance will be subject to conditions which will enable the agencies to be maintained so long as agencies are maintained by other powers and if possible until such time as there shall be a thor oughly efficient administration of the Ottoman Posts.

I am, with great truth and respect. Sir, Your Excellency's most obedient. humble Servant, Excellency The Right Honourable ' t. Wallet, K.C.ti.O (Signed) E. Grey..Post Offices a t Bagdad a nd Rakt^ # (1) j-he British Post Offices at these places were opened on January 1st 1868 hy the Indian Postal Adminis tration, as an extension of a system already established at Bushire and muscat. The Vail of Bagdad was notified of the arrangements made, and apparently availed himself of an offer to have his letters carried free, if franked by him. No other correspondence seems to have passed at the time with the Turkish Authorities,and no objection was raised by them. In 1883 the Turkish Government wished to have them suppressed. The Government of India resisted stoutly on the ground that they had no confidence whatever in the efficiency of any Turkish service that might be substituted, and that comaercial interests would suffer by any change. In 1889 a question arose about Customs duties on vhe parcels arriving by mail. On this occasion 31r J. Pauncefote observed 'The Turks want to get the thin end 'of the wedge in through Bagdad and Bussorah and detach 'us from the other Powers on this question' - i.e., the maintenancemaintenance of Postal Agencies In Turkey. (2) The question of the Post Offices at Bagdad and Basra is, Indeed, only a small part of the large question of the abolition of foreign Postal Agencies throughout the Ottoman Empire, concerning which the Turks beve never ceased to make representations to us and other Powers, and to the International Bureau at Berne. In these representations they have frequently quoted the International Postal Convention, and contended that, as a party to it, they have a right to make their own arrangements. This has of course never been ac cepted as a valid argument, in view of the Important nature of the interests involved, and the chaos which would supervene if the Turkish Authorities had the # handling of foreign mails. The fact is that in the case of Turkey this Convention must be read subject to other Treaty stipulations by which she is bound, guaranteeing most-fevoured-natlon treatment to a number of Powers. So long as any foreign Postal Agencies exist in Turkey, any one of these Powers has a riglit to % a similar privilege. The question cannot be treated in part, but only as a whole. (3)© (3) This is how it Is treated in the recent De claration signed hy Sir E.Grey on July 29th last which concedes the principle of abolition, on condition that this measure be extended to all the foreign Post Offices, and that His Majesty's Government are convinced that the Ottoman postal administration offers the requisite guarantees for the safety and speed of conveyance of correspondence. In this connection Sir G.Lowther on June 25th last (29184) repeated a telegram from our Consul- General at Bagdad which said 'May I represent that Bagdad 'and Basra Post Offices stand on a different footing 'from those in Turkey under His Majesty's Government', and went on to urge the importance of maintaining them. His Excellency's despatch No.552 of June 23rd last conveyed the Consul-General's suggestion 'that in any 'arrangement which may be come to regarding river 'navigation, the carriage of British malls to Bagdad 'should be secured'. The India Office (August 29th 1913 - 40372) on this said 'As regards the Post Offices in Bagdad and Basra, 'Lord Crewe apprehends that if and when British post offices'officeB throughout Turkey disappear, there will he no 'case for their retention at those two places'. (4) The present request seems to relate only to an Ottoman service from Bagdad and Basra as distinct from a British service to these places, hut this is practically a request for abolition, since it is clear that if half the service is misconducted the whole thing will he thrown out of gear. It rather looks as if the Turks had selected these two agencies for attack as being on a different footing (as Consul-General Lorimer has already suggested) from the others. There is however no reason for any distinction being drawn. The circumstances that the Indian Post Office, and not our own, supervises them, is merely a matter of internal administration; while the status of India as regards power to deal with foreign postal matters is recognised by the fact that she herself is a signatory to the Postal Union Conven tion, coming next, but after. Great Britain. A copy of the Convention is annexed. The obvious answer to this request is to refer His Excellency to our Declaration of July 29th last under whichwhich we conceded the principle of abolition generally, subject to the conditions laid down; and to add that in the meantime there would be no advantage in placing the Post Offices in question on a different footing from other Postal Agencies in the Ottoman Dominions. We shall however no doubt be furnished in due course with the detailed observations of the India Office and General Post Office on the reference now being made to them. (Initialled) H.R.

I understand (1) that the weekly British mail steamer delivers and takes up at Pao not only a bag (or bags) containing unregistered postal articles for or from the members of the Indo-European Telegraph lepartment and a few non-British subjects residing at .hat place but also a considerable number of mail bags addressed to or from Kuwait, and (11) that the postal Offg: Political Resident in Turkish Arabia and Acting British Consul-General, Baghdad, To Sir, business which the above operations involve is - andhas for many years been - performed by the Telegraph Staff at Pao without remuneration of any kind. I also understand that Sir Percy Cox made the proposal under reference partly in order to secure some allowance for the Telegraph official (or officials) who do the postal work in connection with Kuwait and partly on political grounds. 3. If the above surmises be correct, I think that the proposal is a good one as it is but fair to in future recompense the Telegraph Staff at Pao for the postal services which they have hitherto rendered gratuitously and it is certainly desirable to strengthen in any way expedient our position in the Gulf region. But, as the Government of India are aware, the Porte have for some years been averse to any extension of the foreign postal system in their territory and our Government have recently agreed (under certain conditions) to the ultimate abolition of the British post officer in Turkey. I assume therefore that the suggestion of the late Resident in the Persian Gulf will not be proceeded with if it necessitates any communication to or negotiations with thethe Ottoman Government.

In spite of the general warning administered by His Majesty’s Minister His Majesty's Minister, Tehran to the Political the Belgian Director-General of Posts IS Resident in ‘he Person Gdf, teh^am No 68, still trying to insinuate a colourable Post dated February 17th, 1913, enclosure 7 to Rest- J dency letter No. 598, dated 22nd February 1913 UltlCe into OUr Concession at Henjam. to Foreign Department. ^ The present local position is that the Customs Mudir, who is only allowed to live in our concession on sufferance, and because he would not be safe from molestation in the Arab village, keeps a few stamps for sale and occasionally sends a few letters across Qishm to Bandar Abbas. 1 3. The Postmaster-General, Bombay, recently informed me that the “ Prov incial Director of Southern Persian Posts ” (a/ias our Persian Postmaster at Bushire) is pressing to be allowed to send closed mail bags from the so-called Persian Post Office at Henjam to other Persian Offices through the British Post Offices and mail steamers, and that he had been directed to consult me before replying. I have taken an opportunity to sound the Persian Postmaster here, who is on intimate terms with the Residency, and speaking confidentially he freely admits that no justification exists for any Persian Post Office on the Island or for the transmission of bags for such an office, and reminds us that when a similar attempt to open a Post Office was made at Henjam some years ago it was soon dropped as administratively unprofitable. He states that it is Molitor, the present Belgian Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs at Tehran, who is now pressing him to push the matter through locally and he expresses the belief that if his own reference to Bombay receives an unequivocal refusal Molitor will drop the subject. 4. I suggest that the Postmaster-General should reply that from enquiries made locally he finds there is no postal justification for the carriage of bags to or from Henjam, and that he regrets he cannot see his way to make the demand upon the Company. Should the Persian Postal authorities persist in pressing the question, it will 1 be advisable to refer him, as has been done in previous cases, to the diplomatic channel, through which he could be informed that in no case can there be any Persian Post Office within our concession at Henjam, and that the only colourably proper location for the establishment of one is the Arab village beyond its limits. Incidently, this would oblige the Customs Mudir, in the event of a Post Office being established, to remove himself from our concession.

As regards the amount of the annual subsidy for the proposed motor launch service between Mohammerah and Ahwaz, I beg to enclose a copy of a No. iSa-c., dated 22 „d November i 9 i 3 . communication received from His Majes ty’s Consul, Mohammerah, on the subject, from which it will be seen that there is no prospect of Messrs. Strick Scott and Company, Limited, accepting any reduction in the subsidy. In this connection I beg that Government will be pleased to consider the question in the light of current events in Arabistan and consider whether ample justification does not exist for such contribution towards such a service from the Imperial and Indian Exchequers, on political, as apart from departmental grounds. 4. I would remind Government that within the past six months the following specific developments have occurred on Karun and at Ahwaz:— (1) The appearance of German launches towing large barges, and running Vide correspondence ending with Residency IO active Competition With letter No. 3058, dated 5th October 1913. vessels of the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company, Limited, and apparently with instructions to obtain a foothold regardless of cost. (2) The inauguration at Ahwaz by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Limited, of borings for oil, which seem likely to termi nate successfully and the possibilities of which are said to have created a most favourable impression on the Commission under Rear-Admiral Sir E. J. VV. Slade, now on a tour of investigation. (3) The renewed importance which recent developments have lent to the Foreien Department telegram No. S.-324, Karun Irrigation Scheme, dated 6th July 1913. j n w hi c h connection the Secretary of State has approved of the Government of India’s sug gestion that we should obtain from the Shaikh of Mohammerah a definite concession for irrigation from the Karun. 5. I hope to submit at an early date, for the wise consideration of Govern ment, proposals with the object of strengthening so far as it is at present within our power to do so, the stability of the political situation in Arabistan, the uncer tainty of which at present hampers British Commercial effort in the province Vide correspondence ending with Re*idency letter No 2473, d^ted nth September 1913,10 Fo.ei^n Department.

Having regard to the developments outlined above, and in view of the importance which His Majesty’s Government have already attached to any steps whereby the status of Ahwaz as one of the Gulf Ports, a ^d a dependency of Korean Office to Hi, Majesty's Minister, Tehran, Mohammerah, COllld be emphasized the despatch No. 121, dated 8th August 1904. proposal under reference to estaousn an Indian Post Office at Ahwaz, as at every other port of the Persian Gulf, connected with Mohammerah by a regular motor launch service, seems to me to be not merely a timely and reasonable step towards the consolidation of British influence in the neutral sphere, but an almost essential item in our general plans and 1 have no hesitation in asking Government, on grounds of political expediency, to con tribute the very modest sum (£250) estimated to be required. 7 This amount is only one quarter of the subsidy that, from the opening of the Karun in 1889 or thereabouts, to the end of 1910, has been paid annually to the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company in respect of the losses incurred by that Company in running the S.S. “ Malamir on the Karun venture to think that the present proposal will be of far greater benefit to Hi Majesty’s Government and the public at large, as the boat or boats which it is contemplated to put on the river for mail purposes will in addition be able to carry a few passengers, thus placing Ahwaz in much closer touch with Moham merah than is now possible, and, incidentally, greatly facilitating the work of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in maintaining the Mohammerah-Ahwaz telegraph line, which runs along the bank of the Karun. The importance of a regular mail service in connection with current railway projects in Arabistan, if and when they materialise, need no demonstration; meanwhile it will enormously facilitate the operations of the engineers on the spot. 8. 1 hope shortly to receive definite confirmation from Mohammerah of the figure of /2S0 already named, together with precise details as to the nature of 6 the service to be affordfed ; in the mean- vide alternative estim tes attached. time I trust that the Government of India will be pleased to accord the above proposals early and favourable consideration.

F rom His Majesty’s Consul for Arabistan, Mohammerah, To—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to inform you that Mr. Walpole has been in correspond ence with his directors on the subject of the proposed postal service for Ahwaz, for some time past. He heard from them last week and they appear to consider that he has been quoting too low a figure for business to be done and that he has not allowed sufficiently for depreciation. Mr. Walpole has every hope of their agreeing to the figure he has named in answer to a further letter which he has written them but he has no expectation of their accepting any reduction in the subsidy, w T hich indeed is cut down to a very low margin. The sum at stake is so small that if the postal authorities cannot meet the whole of the amount it would seem desirable on political grounds to assist the subsidy from Political funds. The directors further point out that with so small a subsidy it would be impossible to accept any penalty for missing the mail and that further some arrangement would have to be made for the periods when it would be necessary to lay up the launch for overhauling.IN POUNDS STERLING.

Ma y I ropresent that Bagdad and Basra post offices under Government of India stand on a different footing from those in Turkey under His Majesty’s Government ? In view of possible ultimate dissolution of Turkey and formation meanwhile of foreign spheres of interest, it seems desirable to maintain,^nd even increase, our establish ments in Mesopotamia, which is region where our stake is most large and our claims greatest. For this reason I submit that no modification should be made in Bagdad and Basra post offices, and that all other institutions which mark our premier position here should be most jealously maintained, such as military detachment and stationnaire. These are ocular proofs of antiquity of our connection with Mesopotamia, where steam navigation and post and telegraph, and nearly all such civilisation as exists, are due to British enterprise.” COPY 7 0 INDIA ] ;790—50012 Annex. Memorandum sent in Draft to Ilahhi Pasha, June 5, 1913. HIS Majesty’s Government have had under careful consideration the various draft conventions and declarations which have been drawn up, and initialled ad referendum, in the course oi the recent negotiations with ITakki Pashi; they have also examined, with close attention, the memoran dum communicated by his Highness on the 1st May, comprising a list of various concessions to which the Imperial Ottoman Government desire that His Majesty’s Government should give their assent. These documents may be dealt with under their several headings as follows : 1. A convention relating to the establishment of a Commission to improve the conditions of navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab, and a declaration, annexed to the convention, providing for the representation on the Commission of neighbouring, but non-Turkish, de facto interests in the river. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to adhere to both these instruments, subject to a modification in article 21 of the convention, increasing its minimum duration to a period of sixtv years, as in the case of Declaration No. 5 (vide infra). Since the assent of His Majesty’s Government to the increased customs duties is requested for an unlimited period, and not merely for seven years, His Majesty’s Government trust that the Imperial Ottoman Government will raise no objection to such a modification of article 21. 2. A convention, with a secret declaration annexed, providing lor the settlement of the respective interests of Great Britain and 1 urkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. To these documents His Majesty’s Government are prepared to adhere. 3. A declaration, with the necessary maps, indicating the line of the Turco-Persian frontier from the region of Hawizeh to the sea. His Majesty’s Government are willing to join in this declaration; they understand, however, that an agreement providing for the settlement of the remaining part of the Turco-Persian frontier will likewise be concluded forthwith. As the Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s3 Government attach the greatest importance to the conclusion of this arrangement. 4. A convention relating to conditions of railway transport, and a declaration providing for the terminus of the Bagdad Railway to be at Basra. His Majesty’s Government are satisfied with the terms of this convention, provided the words “ Turquie d’Asie ” are substituted for “Asie Min cure ” where they occur; the proposed declaration as to the terminus being at Basra is of cardinal importance. 5. A declaration respecting river navigation on the Euphrates and Tigris. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to accept this declaration as a satisfactory settlement of the question, subject of course to the adjust ment of details between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the concessionnaire. 6. A declaration regarding the borrowing powers of Egypt. [Addition to come here.] The points to which the assent of His Majesty's Government is desired by the Imperial Ottoman Government are five :— 1. An increase to 15 per cent, ad valorem of the Turkish import duties. It will be recalled that in 1907 His Majesty’s Government, in concert with the other Power's concerned, agreed to the increase of the Turkish import duties from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem for a specified purpose and for a limited period of seven years, which expires in 1914. In their note of July 1912 His Majesty’s Government expressed their readiness, on stated conditions to agree,— “ to the maintenance, for a period of seven years, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valmem for the same period.” The present request of the Ottoman Govern ment goes considerably beyond this concession: nevertheless, on the successful conclusion of the negotiations which have been proceeding with 3 [2950 k—3] B 24 rJ f &amp; His Highness Hakki Pasha in Tjondon, His Majesty’s Government are prepared to agree to the levy on British imports of 15 per cent. ad valorem without stipulating for a limitation of the period during which such a rate shall be enforced. It must, however, be distinctly understood that this assent of His Majesty’s Government is sub ject to two further conditions, firstly that the assent of other Powers concerned is obtained to the levy of a similar rate on their respective imports, and secondly that a period of notice, of not less than six months, is given before the increased duties are levied. 2. The eventual substitution of a specific tariff, to be fixed by mutual agreement, for the proposed 15 per cent, ad valorem rate. Provided that such a change meets with the approval of other Powers, His Majesty’s Govern ment would be prepared to agree to it in princi ple, subject to the following conditions :— (a.) The details of the scheme of conversion must be previously agreed between Great Britain and Turkey. (5.) No such tariff, even when it has been agreed upon, shall be put into operation without a reasonable period of notice, which in any case shall not be less than twelve months. (c.) The Imperial Ottoman Government shall previously make a declaration that the rights at present enjoyed by His Majesty’s Government, whether under or by virtue of capitulations, treaties, notes, declarations, or otherwise, to veto any increase m the duties leviable on Butish imports into Turkey shall be fully reserved. 3. The imposition of the “ temettu tax on British subjects on condition of its impo sition on all foreigners in Turkey. This question is the subject of active negotia tion at the present time between the Imperial Ottoman Government and the Embassies at Constantinople, and His Majesty’s Government would hesitate to institute collateral negotiations in London, since to do so might lead to mis-5 4. The abolition, in principle, of foreign post offices in Turkey; and, pending their abolition, the sale of Ottoman stamps. Though certain Powers have, His Majesty’s Government are well aware, given a conditional assent to the abolition of their respective post offices in Turkey, the question is one in which it is impossible for His Majesty’s Government to dissociate themselves from the collective action of the Powers. They are, however, prepared, subject to the assent of other Powers to a similar step, to agree to the abolition of British post offices in principle, on the understanding that no such abolition shall be effected until they are satisfied that the Ottoman postal administration affords adequate guarantees of security and promptitude in transmission of correspondence. His Majesty’s Government have no primd facie objection to the sale of Turkish instead of British stamps ; but it would oe necessary to surcharge the stamps used in the British post offices, or otherwise differentiate them from the stamps sold at Ottoman Post Offices or the postal agencies of other Powers, and the technical details would have to be submitted to careful expert examina tion so as to avoid difficulties of accountancy and interference with the British local administration. If the other Powers concerned agreed to a similar change in principle, His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to appoint a delegate to enquire whether the change is practicable. 5. To study the question of the abolition of the Capitidations. As the Imperial Ottoman Government are aware, His Majesty’s Government have con sistently maintained that, inter alia, their right to veto the increase of taxation on British subjects and merchandise is derived from the capitulations, and this right they are not prepared to abandon. Pending the introduction of drastic reforms in the Turkish judicial administration, His Majesty’s Government feel that it would be somewhat premature even to study the possibility of abolish- thecapitulations. None the less, they are prepared, if the other Powers agree to such a course, to appoint representatives to examine how far the existing conditions under the capitulations are capable of improvement.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Ma ( iesty’s Government.] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. [June 4.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 4. [25497] No. 1. Sir, General Post Office to Foreign Office.—(Received June 4.) General Post Office, London, June 2, 1913. I AM directed by the Postmaster-General to refer to your letter of the 9th ultimo. and to the subsequent correspondence between our Offices, and to the personal discussion at the Foreign Office on the 29 th ultimo, on the proposals of the Turkish Government concerning the abolition in principle of the foreign post offices in Turkey, and the use as a provisional measure of Turkish stamps by those offices. 1 am to acknowledge the receipt of a paraphrase of Sir G. Lowther’s telegram of the 15 th ultimo, and of a copy of a memorandum communicated to the Foreign Office by Hakki Pasha on the 24 th ultimo. I am also to enclose for the information of the Secretary of State a copy of a letter dated the 21st ultimo from the British Postmaster at Constantinople, and to draw attention more especially to the objections raised in the second paragraph thereof to which the Postmaster-General attaches considerable weight. Mr. Samuel has now examined the question personally, and directs me to acquaint you, for the information of Sir E. Grey, that he concurs in the views expressed in the provisional reply sent from this Office in his absence (my letter of the 16 th ultimo), viz., that if on political grounds it is considered expedient to abolish the Britisli Post Office agencies in Turkey, no objection would be raised by the Post Office, so lonj? as an efficient Ottoman service is substituted and the agencies maintained by other foreign administrations are withdrawn at the same time. Since the despatch of that letter, however, information has been obtained from the British offices concerned showing that sales to stamp-dealers account for about 1,100Z. of the total revenue of those offices during the past financial year ; so that, if receipts from this source are ignored, there was no excess of revenue over expenditure during that year. It appears to the Postmaster-General essential that the stamps sold at the agencies should be distinguished in some way from those sold at Ottoman post offices or at the agencies of other Powers, unless the British agencies are to be conducted without any sufficient assurance that the correspondence entrusted to them for conveyance will be franked by stamps which they have sold, and therefore without any security of revenue, and at the risk of a substantial loss. If, in the opinion of the Secretary of State, such a risk of loss ought to be accepted for adequate political considerations, Mr. Samuel would not desire to raise objection from a post office point of view, but he does not understand that the Secretary of State invites him at present to regard the matter in this aspect. I am to add that the cost of maintaining the agencies will probably be increased in the future ;— (a.) Under the operation of the transit statistics taken during the past month which will come into effect on the 1st January next; and (b.) By the probable necessity of meeting demands which have been received from the staff at Smyrna and Constantinople for increased remuneration in view of the increased cost of living at those places. For all these reasons Mr. Samuel would suggest that the acceptance in principle of the provisional use of Ottoman stamps should be qualified by a statement that it presents serious practical difficulties, that in any case the stamps so used would have to be distinguished, whether by over-printing or otherwise, from those sold in Ottoman post offices or by the agencies of other powers, and that no definite commitment can be made until the various difficulties have been examined in detail by postal experts It occurs to the Postmaster-General as possible that, if the Ottoman administration is informed that a condition of the use of Ottoman stamps at the agencies will be that they are in some way distinguished from those sold at Ottoman post offices or the [2950 d—4] and a conclusion arrived at whether they can be surmounted, and, if so, on what conditions. Ix-Caj To - Tagencies of other powers, they may say that in these circumstances they are indifferent whether Ottoman or foreign stamps are used. The Postmaster-General would rather welcome such a conclusion, as with the over-printing of Ottoman stamps there would he an inducement to fraudulent over-printing which does not arise with the use of British stamps. I am, &amp;c. E. CRABB. rv P.S.—Your letter of to-day’s date, is just to hand. The Postmaster-General concurs, so far as his department is concerned, with the terms of the proposed reply to Hakki Pasha, subject to the suggested interpolation after the words “ British post offices ” in the second paragraph on p. 4 of the words “ or otherwise differentiate them from the stamps sold at Ottoman post offices or the agencies of other Powers.” (Vide copy attached.) E. C. Enclosure in No. 1. Postmaster, Constantinople, to General Post Office. Sir, British Post Office, Constantinople, May 21, 1913. I PEG leave to report, for the information of the Postmaster-General, that the Second Dragoman of the British Embassy called at this office at the request of the Ambassador and informed me that the Great Powers will probably shortly be invited to consider the question of handing over to the Ottoman Government the net profits derived from the foreign post offices maintained in Turkey. His Excellency desired to know whether it would be possible for the foreign agencies to be worked free from interference or control on tiie part of Turkish officials in the event of Turkish postage stamps being sold in place of foreign stamps. This scheme, it will be remembered, was outlined in a leading article published in the “ Levant Herald,” a copy of which was submitted to the department on the 26th March, 1909. I replied that although the proposal to use native stamps seemed practicable, it was open to several serious objections. For instance, the public might find it convenient to buy stamps from the Ottoman post office, whilst continuing to post their correspondence at one or other of the foreign post offices. In that case the cash receipts would shrink without a corresponding diminution of expenses, and the foreign offices might find themselves working at a loss. Of course, such an eventuality could be met by obtaining an undertaking from the Ottoman Government to make good any deficits, but there are obvious objections to that course. Another objection to the proposed scheme would arise with correspondence addressed to places in Turkey where there are no foreign post offices. At present, when an “inland” letter is found in the letter box of this office, it is refranked with a Turkish stamp and transferred to the Ottoman post office. But if the foreign post offices sold Turkish stamps the public would naturally expect them to despatch letters to all parts of the Empire, and they might consequently be overburdened with corre spondence addressed in Turkish characters. In these circumstances I ventured to point out that if the foreign Governments concerned were really prepared to surrender the profits realised on postal opeiations in Turkey, it would be possible for the foreign post offices to continue to sell their own national stamps and to work along their present lines without loss to the revenues of this country. This object would be attained if the central administrations of the foreign post offices were to furnish the Ottoman Treasury with an annual statement showing details of the receipts and expenses connected with the upkeep of each group of offices. The net surplus profits shown in the statement could then be handed over to the Ottoman authorities. This plan would involve no extra expenditure, and existing arrangements would remain undisturbed. Furthermore, the profits, amounting to several thousands of pounds, now annually derived from the sale of foreign levant stamps to collectors and dealers would incidentally not be sacrificed. I am, &amp;c. F. FERGUSON.[This Docnment is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.! [A] ASTATIC TURKEY AND A RABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [May 17.] Section 1 . [101534] No. 1. General Post Office to Foreign Office.—(Received May 17.) (Confidential.) Slr ’ TXT 1 . , , General Post Office, May 1C, 1913. Ji\ reply to your letters of the 9th and 14th instant, 1 have the honour to acquaint you, ior the information of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that there scenr to be no objection in principle to the abolition of the British postal agencies in ImKe}. iIns office might indeed welcome their extinction, so soon as there is adequate security for an efficient alternative service. It is considered, however that m the interests of British commerce their abolition is to be deprecated unless they are abolished concurrently with those maintained by other foreign countries. A\ith regard 1o the suggestion that, pending the abolition of ’ the agencies Ottoman stamps should be sold instead of British stamps, no sufficient reason is seen lor raising objection, if acquiescence is expedient for political reasons, nor, from a post office point of view, is it considered that such an alteration in the practice at the .British agencies need be made conditional on a similar change in the ao-encies maintained by other Powers. . I enclose a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditure at Constantinople . C]r0Tl b a nd Smyrna for the year 1012-1913. The figures for Salonica have not been included, as it is assumed that future action with regard to the agency at that place . j be a Iaatter for separate consideration. It will be observed 'that* the statement with regard to the three other agencies, without any allowance for Administrative c laiges m London, or for the rental value of the post office premises at Smyrna, or for stationery, Ac., indicates an annual profit of approximately 1,000Z., or about 10 per cent, of the receipts (10,2581) from the sale of postage stamps. It is suggested that, il the pioposed alteration is agreed to, it should be on the principle— 1. That the Ottoman Administration should defray any deficit or receive any profit on the service. 2. I hat there should be no elaborate system of accounting between the two dmnnstrations, but that agreement should be come to (after some further investigation as to probable loss or profit) for the payment of an annual sum to be fixed, say, for a period of five years. . . t would be desirable to arrange that any such fixed annual payment should be subject to revision should there be any considerable change in the amount of the business during that time. from the financial point of view it is necessary to refer to the fact that a considerable portion of the receipts of these agencies is derived from time to time from e sale of stamps to stamp dealers and collectors, and that this amount fluctuates greatly. If the British agencies adopt the use of Ottoman stamps instead of British s amps specially surcharged, it is to be anticipated that the sale to stamp dealers will e gieatly reduced even if it does not cease altogether. .Immediate steps are being a en to ascertain approximately what proportion of the stamp sales during the past ^ eai f e P reseri ts sales to stamp dealers ; and the Secretary of State will be furnished as speeddy as possible with an estimate of profit and loss after allowing for the extinction this item of revenue. It ^ 1G 1T1 ? an ^ me » ^ hoped that this letter will enable the Secretary of State to a e such action as he finds desirable on the question of principle, leaving the points 0 cetail for further consideration. If objection betaken to the suggestion that the payment to be made to or by the Ottoman Administration should be a fixed annual sum agreed on beforehand, it is thought that it might be possible to arrange that the payment, so long as there is a profit, should take the form of a fixed percentage on the ^ c e \alue of the postage stamps requisitioned from the Ottoman Administration or agency purposes. It is of course assumed that, if the British agencies [2917 r—1] ifundertake to sell Ottoman stamps, these stamps will be supplied on demand without charge. The Postmaster-General is at present travelling on the Continent ; and, as the Secretary of State wishes to have an answer this week, it has been impossible to submit the question to Mr. Samuel. . , ^ The case will, however, be submitted to him at once for Ins decision; and, wheO* this is received, a further communication will be sent to you.

The Company are proceeding with the work of enclosing the Customs house with an expanded metal fence. I interviewed Monsieur Fourman on the matter. He told me that he was fully aware beforehand that there would be trouble in the matter and that he reported against it. He expressed his objection to being placed in such a false position and said that he would ask to be relieved of postal business if he were asked to continue to do such work. He told me that he had reported to his head office that, to do his work satisfactorily here, he must maintain good relations with the British and with the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and that he was strongly opposed to the line taken, but that he had to carry out the orders he received. He stated that he had reported that the Post Office could only be run at a loss, and would but be a source of annoyance. He then asked me whether I would object to a Post Office outside the Concession limits. In reply I asked him to imagine himself for an instant in my place : no post office was needed at Abadan and, as he had stated, one could only be run at a loss, if then such a Post Office were placed there l should imme diately begin to wonder why and suspect there must be some ulterior motive. In these circumstances it could hardly fail to be a cause of annoyance. He said that this was the opinion he had already formed, and he would again report to Tehran accordingly. He added that my action in putting a fence round the Customs would bring the matter to a head, and would very soon pro duce a reply from his head office. In further discussion I asked Monsieur Fourman how it was that, after we had shown ourselves so friendly to Persia’s development and long suffering with regard to our own losses, his department, who were servants of the Persian Government, should attempt an action which could hardly be worth the annoy ance which they knew it was bound to cause to us. He expressed himself unable to understand the whole affair. I observe that the issue of the notice to the Works Manager at Abadan is datetd he 21st December ; the notice to me is dated 23rd, but was not delivered till Christmas Eve, after office hours, evidently with the object of gaining two clear days, 25th and 26th December, when offices were closed for the Christmas Holidays.

The British Postmaster imforms me that he has received 3 registered letters bearing the post-mark Abadan. I write to express ray astonishment that, notwithstanding my informing vou that, without orders from Tehran, I could not allow a post office to be established CgiFD6 at that place, you have Instructed your official there to undertake postal work in a British Concession. Apart from all other considerations the passing to and fro of the public could not be tolerated at the jetty, and the Oil Company will accordingly be obliged to enclose that part of their Concession, in their own interests, in order to avoid the possibility of further inconvenience or danger. I regret that the conduct of your Department in this matter, which passes my understanding, should {have necessitated measures being taken which can hardly increase the dignity of the Customs, but I find myself unable to advise the Oil Company to take any other steps, unless I hear by return that you have issued orders that the Persian Post Office be immediately closed. Sub-Enclosure No. 2. Telegram P„ No. 7, dated 8th February 1913. From—His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, To—His Britanic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Three registered letters have been received in the British Post Office here emanating from the Persian Post Office at Abadan. These letters I returned to the Persian Post Office, and I informed the local Director of Customs that it was a cause of regret to me that notwithstanding the fact that I had told him that a Persian Post Office could not be allowed at the concession without the permis sion of the British Legation at Tehran, he had continued to instruct his official that postal business should be accepted. I added that the circumstances being such no course was open to the Company, in order to prevent further inconven ience and possible danger to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but to enclose that portion of the Concession in which the Customs was situated. The Company is at my request commencing this work and will, if it is necessary, complete it. Private ,—The Provincial Director of Customs here is strongly in opposi tion to the line of action adopted by his Department, and tells me that he reported against it. He also said that if he was placed in such a false position he would ask to be relieved of his postal work. He then questioned me as to whether a Post Office outside the Concession would be objected to by me. There appeared to be, I replied, no demand for such a post office while he himself had said it could not pay ; it seemed evident that it could only be a cause of trouble. He then stated that he would report against that also. Enclosure No. 5. No. 23-C., dated Mohammerah the 15th February 1913. From— Major L.

(Copy of enclosure). Abadan ; The 7th February 1913. My Dear Walpole, Regarding the Post Office at Abadan. The man in charge is the ' Director of Customs, Abadan ”—or that is what he terms himself—and he has stated that A. P. O. C. cannot stop the Post Office, and that the Director of Customs m Mohammerah has given him instructions to encourage everyone. To assist !? t ^ s \ he gives a pictorial post-card to everyone who posts a letter or parcel. Something for nothing goes a long way with the natives. The post-office is in the Customs House, and by closing up the post-office we also close up the Customs House. So far we have marked off the fence, and I have given instructions to erect the same at once. We will allow the Customs Officer to pass through the Jetty gates to enter the Customs House from the inside of the Works. This is not ^ very satisfactory method, but it is the only way to prevent outsiders from having access to the Post Office.8 I have not advised this man officially ; one of our men carried the information to him, and it is from this man that I had the Customs Officer’s remarks. Can I send him an official letter saying; that he has not received the Company’s sanction to start a Post Office, or will we wait developments from the other side ? Yours sincerely, (Sd.) R.

With reference to our conversation of yesterday’s date at which you agreed that no letters will be accepted at the Abadan Post Office as an unofficial solution and that till orders come from Tehran the Customs official will state that he has run out of stamps 1 take it for granted that equally no letters will be delivered. This is equally necessary. Sub-Enclosure No. 5. Dated 8th February 1913. From— Major L. B. H. Haworth, I. A., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Arabistan, To— Mr. C. A. Walpole, Manager, Messrs. Strick, Scott and Company, Limited, Your letter of yesterday’s date regarding Post Office at Abadan with enclo sure from Pitkethly. On receiving my last letter Fourman came round to see me. He naturally does not want to look foolish in having a fence drawn round his Post Office and has agreed that his man shall accept no more letters and shall say that he has no more stamps if anyone wishes to post letters. I too have no wish to appear to be openly fighting the Customs as long as we win our point. They might then continue the erection of the fence, but not complete it entirely. Could you put an Indian Orderly at the door or window of the Post Office to see that the promise is kept and that no stamps are issued also that no letters are delivered. ' If we have to complete the fence all that is necessary is to put some stores alongside of the Customs House, have the gates v/here you like, and put a sentry to stop anyone entering except the Customs official.

An Indian Post Office has been in existence at Gwadur since 1868: it is a combined sub-post office M i.e. t the postmaster undertakes telegraphic as well as postal work. ^ Indian inland rates are charged and the Post office is included^ in the Imperial penny postage scheme. I have no f-® make in regard to this office: the present somewhat primitive arrangements by which mails for Charbar, in Persian territory, are landed at Gwadur and taken to Charbar, and vice versa, by telegraph linesmen, will cease, if, as suggested elsewhere, an Indian Post Office is opened at Charbar. 3. Maskat .—This office was established on 1st May 1864. Indian inland rates are charged and the office is one of those included in the Imperial penny postage scheme. I have no suggestions to offer in regard to this office. 4. Bahrain .—This office was established in 1884: it is inconveniently accommodated at present in the Agency building and in connection with the erection of a new residence and office for the Political Agent, further suggestions will be made in regard to accommodation for the post office, which has already been under the consideration of Government. The only point which calls for specific notice is that commission at 2 per cent has been charged since 1890 on money orders issued by or payable at this office. The increase appears to have been effected at the instance of the British India Steam Navigation Company, who complained that large sums of specie were being carried in the mail bags between Bahrain and Bushire causing loss to themselves in freight and a great increase in responsibility. I am inclined to think that the time has now come for a reconsideration of this restriction of post office business at the expense of British Indian merchants and of the general public. In the first place, the British India Steam Navigation Company, now only charge ^ per cent on specie carried to Bombay from Bahrain and the post office would be therefore in no wise competing unfairly with them by charging 1 per cent. In the second place, there sterns no sufficient reason to discriminate in this matter against Bahrain, whereps the Government of India are aware, our mer chants already have many difficulties to contend with. I am consulting the Political Agent, Bahrain, and the Superintendent of Post Offices, Persian Gulf Division, on this point and will address Government further on receipt of their views. 5. Dehai. —In 1905 several leading merchants of Debai represented to the British India Steam Navigation Company the inconvenience entailed to them by the lack of postal facilities, and in 1906 they renewed their representations to this Residency, In reply to a request for his views on the proposal that a post office be opened at Debai, the Postmaster-General, Bombay, informed the Resident, in the Persian Gulf, as departmental supervision though costly, was not effective, and the question of accommodation presented frequent difficulties. In August 1906, the Postmaster-General arranged for the despatch to Debai of unregistered fully prepaid letters (at Indian inland rates) m a special bag and in November 1908 the Government of India sanctioned a proposal that the Native Agent of the British India Steam Navigation Company at Debai should ^ oe o font Q H VP mPaCllfP •No. 38759, dated 16th March 1906. that the Indian Postal Department was opposed to an extension of their operations No. 3446 -E.A., dated nth November 1908, act as Postmaster as a tentative measure at a remuneration of Rs. 15 per month.2 The Chief of Debai was however from the first unwilling to consent to the establishment of a post office, and partly for this reason and partly from the mail agent’s own remissness, the arrangement has never worked satisfactorily, and any improvement in this direction in the near future must depend upon the steps which are contemplated by Government in connection with the establishment of a wireless telegraph installation on this coast. 7. Kuwait —The question of regularizing our postal arrangements at this port is already under the consideration of Government. I need only refer to the Residency letter No. 3450, dated 32nd December correspondence On the Subject and express the hope that a favourable decision may be reached shortly and that it will be decided to charge Indian inland rates at this office, and include it, like Maskat, Bahrain and Gwadur, within the Imperial penny postage scheme. Omission to do this will tend to weaken rather than strengthen our position vis-a-vis the Porte, and will be given undue significance locally, as at all the Arab ports where our post offices are established, viz., Maskat, Bahrain and Debai, Indian inland rates are charged. 8. Fao .—I attach a note supplied by the Superintendent of Post Offices, Persian Gulf Division, showing the present position of this station from the departmental point of view and in this connection beg to invite reference to my k . , recent letter on the subject to the Foreign Department. I may add that rao has been a port of call for mail steamers since 1867 and that until 1886 letters, both paid and unpaid, for Turkish officials at Fao and occasional letters for the Arab villages on the opposite bank of the Shatt-el-Arab were included in the bag sent from Basrah to Fao, but, as the telegraph officials had no means of distribution at their command and as difficulty was experienced in recovering postage on unpaid letters, the practice was discontinued, except in the case of letters and packets for Turkish officials and departments entitled under agree ment to free postage. On political and postal grounds it is to be regretted that it was considered necessary thus to restrict the postal activities of telegraph officials at Fao, for they would doubtless have developed in time into a fully fledged post office : but it is perhaps not impossible for us to do something to retrace our steps in this matter. If and when the Bar is dredged, and in connection with the Baghdad Railway, Fao may attain considerably increased importance and it seems expe dient that we should seek to strengthen our prescriptive position there in the matter of postal facilities by such unostentatious means as may suggest themselves. To this end I would suggest (1) A grant of a local allowance of say Rs. 25 per month to the telegraph official charged with postal work : it may be remarked with refer ence to Mr. Hughes’ note that the post office at Fao has a good deal to do with handling the Kuwait mail bags and that this branch of work, which is likely to increase, demands care and attention which it is scarcely reasonable to ask the telegraph staff whose salaries are none too large, to perform gratuitously. There seems no reason to think that the grant of an allowance would give rise to objections by Turkey. (2) The provision of a date stamp and other essential paraphernalia intended for a post office. (3) The mention of Fao, as a branch office in the list of Indian Post Offices in the Indian Postal Guide Index (but not elsewhere) with the necessary limitations as to the non-acceptance of registered or insufficiently paid articles, etc. It would seem unnecessary to call attention to its inclusion in any other way; it will be noted however that the official time table of the British India Steam Navigation Company contains the following foot note (page 33) :—3 “ Steamers stop for mails weekly at Fao Telegraph Station in the Basrah river. ” In conclusion, I may mention that it appears to have been the custom for many years to make up postal bags for Fao from Basrah, Mohammerah and other ports, whenever occasion offers, and I am informed that the Turkish officials at Fao have frequently availed themselves of the postal facilities afforded by the present system. 9. Briefly summarized, the proposals that I have ventured to submit above are as follows :— Gwadur ... Nil. Maskat... • •• • •• • •• • • • ... Nil. Bahrain .—Reduction of rate of money order commission to 1 per cent. Dehai .—Under consideration in separate connection. Kuwait .—Already under consideration of Government. Application of Indian inland rates and Imperial penny postage scheme advocated. no Grant of local allowance. Fao.— \ (2) Provision of postal paraphernalia. ! ^(3) Inclusion of station in list of post offices. Respectfully committing the foregoing suggestions to the wise consideration of the Government of India. Note. Post office arrangements at Fao. There is no post office at Fao. For some years past, however, mails bags are closed for Fao by offices in the Gulf. These bags contain unregistered articles of the letter mail. Registered articles and parcels are also received but these are sent through the post office at Bushire which collects fees due, etc., before sending them on. In the same way registered letters and parcels are sent to Bushire by Fao where they are receipted, entered up, etc., as if posted in Bushire. This arrangement is intended purely in the interest of the telegraph staff at Fao,—but l understand even non-British subjects take advantage of it and receive letters, etc., in the bags made up for the telegraph staff. Some short while ago the officer in charge put in for an allowance for doing post office work. It came through the Director, Telegraphs, and Post master-General. I pointed out— (1) that there w T as no British post office at Fao, (2) that the work done was purely in the interest of the telegraph staff, (3) that non-British subjects, *.&lt;?., others than the telegraph staff should not benefit by it, ( 4 ) that if an allowance was paid, it would be giving the place the status of a post office which might give rise to objections by Turkey. There the matter dropped. The post office guide contains no mention of Fao or any mail arrangements that we have for it. It is not supplied with a date stamp or any of the other paraphernalia intended for a post office. All the arrangements in fact are purely private. Sd. A. J. HUGHES.

The suggestion was made hy me in 1905 when the present acceleratedaccelerated mail service was introduced, that the .post office should adapt itself to the new v vide correspondence ending V with j?ostjunst®r General's V letter jfo* 34014 dated conditions and open on Sundays,v January 23rd 1903« ^ closing instead on Mondays. This proposal wa® not, however, accepted by the postmaster general, Bombay, on departmental grounds, and on reference to the vyovernment of India his view was upheld, I would ask you to y Resident to Foreign Bo, 91 V dated 18th February 1905, 0 Foreign to .Resident bo, 1906- consider whether it is not v JS*3*, dated 20th May 19o5, 0 feasible and necessary now to reconsider this question, both in the interests of the post office staff and of the public, and of present political requirements, I would lay stress on the fact that the Persian post Office has found it necessary to modify its working arrange ments and hours and to regain open on Sundays* The result is that it is largely used for purposes of registration which would otherwise fall to the British post office and thus the latter not only loses revenue but gives handle to the local Belgian Officials for claiming that the .Persian office meets Yu the requirements of the public more readily that the British institution. That the Sunday facilities in question are taken advantage of by the public and that the loss of revenue is not imaginary, is shown by the abnormal decrease in the booking of registered letters for the year, during which the postPost offio® h&amp;s taken to remaining o^en on ,ja?idays* 1 may add that the British postmaBtfey, in pointing out this faot to me # spontaneously suggested that the post Of fit© should u© kept open for the transaction of all business on Sunday and observe Monday as a holiday instead* 7, Finally, 1 would point out that under the new British India company's Contract, the mails will be closed &amp;££ here on Sunday afternoon at S or 5 which will in any case necessitate the Postmaster and the whole staff attending for several hours on that day; if my suggestion be adopted and the post Office be opened on Sunday and only closed on Monday not/will the public and this Residency, be spared the grave inconvenience arising from the closing of the post office on Mail days, but the post office Staff will have the weekly holidays to secure which is no doubt the object of the departmental rules upon the subject of Sunday work in post offices, I have addressed you fully and unreservedly in order that you may completely understand the situation, and believing ttet the remedy lies within your competence as the postmaster ureneral, Bombay, to apply; should this for any reason not be the case, I beg that you will be good enou*h to submit the question to higher authority withall practicable despatch and advise me accordingly• Meanwhile I am forwarding a copy of SIMM this comnuni- cation to the Superintendent of Posts and persian v»uliT Division Karachi# extract (para.H) from a communication ilo. 3035 ( d^ted 18th Uovemher 1912, from the postmaster general, Bombay, to the political Hesident, in Persian uulf, Bushire.

From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Delhi. (Repeated to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran). Secret .—1 have just learnt from telegrams passing through that Director- General of Posts in Tehran has instructed Persian Director of Posts at Bushire to ask Customs-house here to arrange for their official at (?) Hanjam to perform / postal duties and inform him of the result. In my letter No. 431, dated 9th February, in transit to Simla and Tehran course of action submitted, inter alia, proposals for a British Post office on Hanjam, to be run by Telegraph officials as at Jask, Gwadur, etc. I beg Government of India will expedite consideration of the matter and give necessary instructions forthwith for, at all events, a temporary postal instal lation. It is most important that we should be first in the field with working I postal arrangements and thus obtain benefit of new mail contract providing for : • call weekly at Hanjam. To permit Persian Post Office on our concession or on Island at all would greatly weaken our position there. In this connection please l| see last paragraph of my telegram No. 37*115 to Foreign Department repeated to Tehran, dated 19th January. Telegram P., No. 279, dated 12th (received 13th) February 1913. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have sent following to Minister, Tehran. Begins Please refer to my immediately preceding telegram. Mornard, it seems possible, does not realise the full bearing of Molitor’s present scheme to insinuate Persian Post offices into British concessions by making use of Customs-house employe for the purpose. You could perhaps, without referring to Hanjam question, in regard to which the source of my information at present precludes my asking Your Excel lency to take up the matter, approach Mornard, with specific reference to Abadan question, vide Consul, Mohammerah, telegram 7, dated February 8th, and point out to him that by permitting Customs officials to be made use of to plant Persian Post offices in the British concessions generally in the Gulf where there is in any case not the least need for them, he is gratuitously courting friction and scattering thorns in the path of his own local officials who have already quite enough to do without fathoming Molitor’s littoral schemes, which must inevi tably result, as is now case at Mohammerah, in their coming into conflict with local British representatives, to the detriment of the primary interests of Customs house administration. Ends, No. 431, dated Bushire, the 9th (received 17th) February 1913. From— Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. I have the honour to invite attention to the subject of British postal arrange ments in the Persian Gulf and in particular on the Persian littoral, and to invite the Government of India to take into their wise consideration the expediency of extending them unostentatiously in certain directions where such action is indicated either on postal grounds or as a measure of political expediency. 2. The Government of India are doubtless familiar with the history of our postal establishments in the Persian Gulf, the first of which were originally established in 1864, less however as administrative novelties, than in order to regularize and make available to the general public postal facilities which had been long enjoyed by the different Residencies and Agencies, and by the purely commercial establishments of the Honourable East India Company, of which C86FD2 our Agencies were the lineal successors, at a time when the Persian Gulf route was (as it may well be again) the most rapid between Europe and India. From the time of their inception until 1877, when Persia was admitted to membership of the International Postal Union, there were no regular post offices at all in Persia except those maintained by the Indian Government : the British Legation at Tehran and the Residency Agent at Shiraz, however, discharged some of the functions of postmaster by collecting letters for despatch to Bushire and India, and by distributing letters for the benefit of British officials and subjects and a few other persons, including Persian officials; snd the records of this Residency for that period bear testimony to the appreciation of Persian notables and others in the interior for the facilities afforded. These however ceased to be accorded in 1878, as the result of an agreement between the Persian Government and the Government of India, though the Persian Government had at first sug gested that the British Indian Postmaster at Bushire should be placed also in charge of the Persian Post office there. 3. In 1901, a further restriction of the activities of British Post offices in Persia took place, the Government of India accepting a proposal by the Persian Government that the various Indian Post offices should not accept postal matter intended for delivery at any place in Persia, in order that they might not compete with the newly established Persian Post offices; whilst in 1902 orders were issued for the discontinuance of the old established practice of sending letters for delivery out of the Post office, thus for instance putting a term to the delivery of letters on Qishm Island from the Bandar Abbas Post Office, and to the house to house and suburban delivery on Bushire Island. In 1903, the Belgian Customs Administration having taken charge of the Persian Post office, Monsieur Naus demanded and obtained the adoption by British Post Offices in Persia of Union instead of Indian inland letter post rates ;a reform involving an increase of 250 per cent in postal rates for British subjects in Southern Persia, and very distasteful to the latter in consequence. 4. In 1910, a Parcels Post Convention was concluded with the Persian Gov ernment which whilst regularizing the position generally, restricted considerably our old established privileges in this direction. In the same year a further concession was made to the Persian Government, the Indian Post offices which had hitherto had the monopoly of despatching letters to India and Europe, being instructed to accept from Persian Post offices letters for abroad franked with Persian stamps. c. It will be seen from the foregoing that the tendency of our postal nego tiations during the past 30 years has been in the direction of whittling down our prescriptive postal privileges, and it was therefore with some apprehension that I learnt in the summer of 1912 of the proposed employment in Southern Persia of a Belgian Director of Posts ; and I was not surprised to hear, shortly after- •His Majesty * Minister, to Foreign Office, telegram No. 596 , dated 17 th Nov- Wards,* that the main ember 191 a:— r , .. . . object of certain pro- “ The need of a Belgian Postal Inspector in the south has formed the subject of , forward hv a lengthy correspondence between the Director-General of Posts and the Treasurer pOSalS put lOrwam Dy General. The latter has submitted this correspondence to me, from which Monsieur Molltor, is clear that one of the Director-General’s chief objects ts to secure the abolition Rplcrian DirPPtor of British post offices in certain Gulf ports. The Minister of Posts approves the the tSClgian UireCtOF suggestion regarding the Postal Inspector.” 0 f Posts at Tehran, was to secure the abolition of certain British Post offices in the Persian Gulf. This correspondence following hard upon indications from Mohammerah of the desire of the Belgian Director of Posts to pursue a more active policy, to revert, in fact, to the attitude of hostility to our post offices which he sheM so notably in 1907, has led me to endeavour to examine our postal machinery in the Gulf ports with a view to suggesting the adoption, while there is yet time, of any improvements which political exigencies and the growing requirements of trade may indicate. 6 It was likewise this development which prompted the suggestion which I had the honour to Res dent, to Foreign Office, repeated Foreign and Minister, No. 37-115 dated 0 fl er f or Foreign, to Foreign Office, repeated to Resident, No. 50 ‘ 0 ., dated 24 th January deration / / „ 9 ment consi- of Govern- recently that3 documentary recognition, as a permapency, of such ancient and prescriptive postal rights and privileges as are still left to us, and if possible an expression of readiness to see the same rights applied to other Persian ports of the bull as occasion may require, should be sought from the Persian Government. The Government of India expressed at the time the view that' this matter was not urgent and might stand over, and considered that without the concur rence of the Russian Government such undertakings would not be possible. 7. I would however, with the highest respect, venture to hope that it may vet be considered possible to claim that this service, which affects the littoral of the Persian Gulf only, is, like quarantine, one of our special interests m the Persian Gulf, the existence of which the Russian Government ‘ did not deny in 1907, and that we are therefore entitled to treat it as one between the Persian Government and ourselves. 8. 1 now beg to indicate the various places where we have ^ post offices or where it would seem that we might usefully graft them on to existing telegraph establishments. Mohammerah .—A post office was formally opened here on loth July 1892, shortly after the creation of the British Vice-Consulate: it is located in the Con- S y d ... d -, d sulate building. The express consent of to Minister, «el.g,.m No. 7 t, 3 ^ ^ ^ estabUshment . Minister to Resident, inM 3rd ]«'« '890. and ; n this respect it appears to be unique E F dSVd C Jnne m ,8 n 9 i.° ' ' amongst the post offices in the Gulf, and indeed with the doubtful exception of Jask, it is the only British Post office in Persia that was not in existence many years before Persia commenced to maintain her own postal service. Pending the provision of suitable accommoda- f .. . , , „ . tion in the British Vice-Consulate, the Enclosure to Legation despatch dated September . • , 0 26th, 1891, to Resident. Persian Government issued orders f r room to be set apart for the post office in the Persian Telegraph Office. The fact that, in this instance, the Persian Government accorded specific ^ . P , No 8 daled 6th sanction to the establishment of the post M : r ch“ ' ' Office, though* there was already a Persian Post office in existence is of some importance and may serve as a precedent for any subsequent request for postal facilities that it may be necessary to make to the Persian Government. The accommodation at present available for the post office and the Post- mastpr has been the subject of constant complaint of recent years and some better arrangement is imperatively demanded, Mohammerah being one of the bus e t officfs in the Persian Gulf and serving a larger European and Indian population than any other British Post office in Persia except Bushire. I hope to submit proposals in this connection for the favourable considera- tion of Government during the next few weeks. o Ahviaz —Ahwaz is at present unprovided with a British Post office, tinued ever since. . ,1 wouid be convenient both with a view to faciiitating °-commerce ^ in order to emphasize the position of A . s ! t hink P little doubt that it a^S^at who u , h d GulUnd is in conse'quence charged with a good deal of accounts work over and4 above the usual duties of a Post office. It has, moreover, a certain amount of daily business contact with the Persian Post office, as, despite pillagings and robberies, a considerable volume of postal matter is transferred weekly from the British Post office for transmission to Shiraz and Ispahan. But the practical working efficiency of this office is of greater importance to us than that of any other office, for it is here alone that Foreign Consular Officers will be found, and Bushire is the only Persian port in the Gulf where foreigners form an appreciable part of the European population. Anxious, like all of us, for their mails, they are prone to magnify every little shortcoming in the working of the office, and are not slow to make capital out of its alleged deficiencies. Bushire too, is the head-quarters of the Belgian Administration in the Gulf and it is for this reason also very necessary that out Post office should be adequately and sufficiently staffed : I have already been in correspondence on the subject with the Post master-General, Bombay, and hope that, as a result of a full discussion of the whole matter which I have had at his request with the Superintendent of Persian • Gulf Post Offices, an arrangement may receive sanction under which the Post master here will always be a man of a higher grade than is generally the case at present. I trust that, should the specific sanction of Government be required to any additional expenditure in this direction, the matter may receive favourable considerstion. n. Lingah —k British Post office was first established here on ist April 1867 and has been retained ever since: for many years it was the office of exchange for mail bags from the British enclave at Basidu, some 23 miles distant it differs from most offices in the Gulf in that it exists entirely apart from the British Vice-Consulate, which has only recently been established. Commis sion is charged on money orders at the rate of 2 per cent, instead of 1 per cent in order to prevent the accumulation of cash which led in 1898 to a serious robbery. l am inclined to think that this restriction, which is somewhat of a hardship to British traders there, is no longer necessary, local conditions having considerably changed, and I am suggesting to the Superintendent of Post Offices, for his consideration and that of the Postmaster-General, Bombay, that commis sion be reduced to 1 per cent as at other Gulf offices. With this exception I have no suggestions to make with regard to the Lingah Post office. The British Telegraph station at Hanjam received its mails from the Bandar Abbas Post office under its own departmental arrangements until the beginning of the present year, when, under the revised mail contract subsidiary mail steamers began to call weekly from outwards and inwards with mails for Hanjam. The Government of India are familiar with the history of our position on the Island, which has been considerably strengthened by the inception of coaling arrangements there for His Majesty’s ships, and will shortly be further consoli dated by the establishment of a wireless station. I beg to suggest that, in order to make the best possible use of the new mail service, and to strengthen our general position a Post office should be established forthwith on the Island. In view of the exceptional status of our concession on the Island Indian inland rates might suitably be applied : it would be preferable on all grounds to appoint a postmaster from India authorized to transact the same classes of business as are accepted at Lir^gi, Mohammerah, etc. Mr. Hughes, Superintendent of Post Offices, Persian Uulf Division, estimates the cost of such an establishment at Rs. 100 per mensem. A cheaper though less effective and less convenient scheme would be to create a “ branch post office ” as at Jask, subordinate to Karachi, and give a proportionate allowance of Rs. 25 per mensem (plus Rs. 15 for a postman) to the Telegraph official charged with postal duties. Mr. Hughes, however, has expressed a strong preference on departmental grounds to the establishment of a sub-office, as experience has5 shown that considerable inconvenience is caused both to the public and. to the Department by branch offices conducted by frequently changing and conse quently non-expert officials. I may add that a Post office at Hanjam would be a y-. great convenience to the Navy, and would afford additional postal facilities to ^ Lingah, which at present only gets a fortnightly call both ways. It would also be of great use should we at any time decide upon overt action on Masandum. The necessary accommodation could be provided in connection with the erection of a wireless installation, at a small extra cost. 13. Bandar Ahb as. —The Post office at Bandar Abbas was opened, con currently with that at Lingah, on April 1st 1867, at the earnest request of the mercantile community and of the Persian Governor: it was from the first a great success from every point of view and as already mentioned, was an office of exchange for mails to and from Hanjam until the beginning of this year. The British Post office at Bandar Abbas was not until recently housed in the British Consulate, which was only established in 1901 but in a separate building. Bandar Abbas is at present a combined Post and Telegraph office, the postmaster drawing a special allowance for transacting telegraphic business over the Bandar Abbas- Hanjam cable, a most convenient and economical arrangement. 1 have no suggestions to make with regard to this office which is likely, as railway development proceeds, to attain considerable importance. 14. Jask. —A regular post office was established in the British concession here in 1880, in supersession of previously existing informal postal arrangements. The attached note by the Superintendent of Post Enclosure I. Offices shows clearly the disadvantages, from the departmental point of view, of the present system under which Jask is provided with a branch office under Karachi, and I trust that the departmental authorities concerned will give favourable consideration to the replacement of the present branch office by a departmental sub-office; the necessary buildings, need not be expensive, if erected departmentally. It is impossible to foresee when circumstances may permit the withdrawal of our troops, from Jask, and the Government of India will 1 trust concur with me in considering it desirable to make our postal arrangements at Jask as efficient as possible. I would venture also to enquire, whether, having regard to the conditions under which we occupy our enclave at vide page 96, Aitchuon, Volume xn, 4 th Edition. j as k an ^ w hi c h have since tended to inure in our favour owing to the continued presence of British troops there, in semi permanent quarters, we should not be justified in charging Indian inland rates as suggested above for Hanjam. Jcisk may possibly attain greater importance in the future than in the past, and we cannot afford to lose any opportunity of emphasizing and strengthening the special position we enjoy there: 1 need only refer to the correspondence which passed in 1900 regarding the creation of an International Sanitary Station at Jask as an example of a political development which we cannot wholly exclude from consideration. 15. Charbar. —Charbar is a station on the Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment’s land line between Karachi and Bushire, in charge of a First Class General Service Clerk, who draws Rs. 5 ° fro m the Political Department of the Govern ment of India in addition to his pay. There has been a detachment of Indian Infantry there for some years in connection with the Arms Traffic. There is at present no British Post office at Charbar though^ it has since 1911 a port of call for our mail steamers, but in 1910a Persian Post office was re-opened there (it had been established apparently in 1902 but closed soon afterwards) and Persian mail bags are now conveyed between Charbar and other Gulf ports by our mail steamers, under arrangements made and paid for by the Government of India. It seems to me that in giving Charbar a regular mail service whilst omitting to establish a post office there, we are not making the most of the favourable6 position in which we are placed in regard to these small ports by the existence of a British telegraph station and a British mail service. I would propose therefore that a branch post office be quietly established at Charbar, the Tele graph clerk in charge being provided with the necessary stamps, etc., and being given an allowance as is done at Jask. It would not seem necessary to inform the Persian Government as no intimation was given in the case of the Jask Post officej which is also managed by Telegraph officials. The establishment of a branch post office would render obsolete the present primitive departmental arrangement under which mails for Charbar are landed at Gwadur and carried to Charbar by Telegraph linemen. In the not very likely event of any protest being raised by the Persian Government it could be explained that a British Post office is a necessary corollary of a regular mail service and that objection on their part to the post office will entail stoppage of the mail service. I do not, however, anticipate any serious local objection, and would add that the establishment of a branch post office at Charbar will be greatly appreciated by the thriving colony of British traders at that port, which, it must be remembered, has the making of a fine harbour and may attain importance in connection with the Trans-Persian Railway Project. 16. In conclusion, I venture to remind Government that the Persian Postal Administration, whilst making use of our fast and subsidiary mail service to carry its own sealed mails between Persian ports in addition to letters posted anywhere in Persia for places abroad, does not so far as I know pay a penny for the privilege of doing so, and in the not very probable event of their questioning our title to initiate our own postal arrangements at Hanjam and Charbar, I would suggest that this consideration might be brought home to them, if not by a request to contribute to the mail subsidy, then by an allusion to their good fortune in being immune from such a contribution. 17. The recommendations which I have ventured to make in the foregoing paragraphs may be briefly summarized as follows:— Mohammerah .—Improved accommodation for Post office and Postmaster. Ahnoaz .—British Post office to be opened. Bushire .—Superior grade of postmasters and more numerous staff required. Lingah .—Money order commission to be reduced to 1 per cent as at other Gulf offices. Hanjam —Post office to be established; Indian inland rates to be charged. Jask. —Present branch office to be converted to sub-office. Charbar. —Branch post office to be established. 18. In a subsequent communication I will endeavour in the same way to summarize the present position and make suggestions with regard to other post offices in the sphere of this Residency, outside Persia. I am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister, Enclosure 1. Note. Jask Post Office. There is a branch post office at Jask which is managed by one of the clerks of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. The Post office is accommo dated in one of the Telegraph buildings. An allowance of Rs. 30 per mensem7 used to be paid to the clerk in charge for doing the Post office work. 1 he Arms Traffic in the Gulf has made the place somewhat important in conse quence of which besides the continual presence of gunboats, there is a fairly large contingent of native troops from India. Post office work has greatly increased and some time back on an application of the clerk in charge, his allow ance was raised to Rs. 50. However when the question came before me, I suggested that it would be very much more satisfactory to give the public greater postal facilities by having a regular sub-office manned by a departmental postmaster, particularly as it would cost very little more and would ensure the work being done in a more methodical manner. The Postmaster, Karachi, has continually been reporting this office for bad work and it has given us a lot of trouble. No good can be expected of it as long as the incumbents are frequently changed by the Director, Indo-European Telegraphs, in the interests of his own Department. As soon as a man has begun to get into working order he is replaced by another who knows nothing at all about the Post office and thus the interests both of the department and the public suffer to a very great extent. There was no difficulty about making it a sub-office provided accommodation could be found for a post office and a postmaster. With this view I addressed the Director, Indo-European Telegraph Depart ment, and in reply I was informed that far from being able to give us any accom modation he would be glad if we gave up the present room occupied by the Post office as it was wanted for their own requirements, adding that he had no objec tion to our building a Post office of our own. The importance of Jask from a Post office point of view is bound up with the presence of troops and gunboats and will dwindle away to nothing as soon as it becomes practicable to withdraw them. This I take it is only a matter of time. Under the circumstances the Post office was not prepared to erect a building at a considerable cost and agreed to pay the increased allowance to the clerk in charge as the lesser of two evils. The work however is too heavy for any but departmental postmaster and is performed very unsatisfactorily. The whole question of improving it is one of accommodation. A. J.

The Anglo-Persian Oil Company allowed the Customs Department to rent a room for the accommodation of the Customs Agent at Abadan in the summer of 1911. On 23rd the Director of Customs issued a notification to the effect that a post office had been opened by him at Abadan. I wrote asking the situation of this post office and I have received a reply that it was in the Customs Officer’s room. I have refused to allow the post office without the sanction of Your Excellency, and have expressed my surprise that such action should have been taken by the Postal Department without my knowledge or that of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. There is no need for a post office. Telegram P., No. 2, dated 10th (received 16th) January 1913. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah. I am not sufficiently au fait with the conditions at Mohammerah to know on what lines I should be enabled to base my objections to the establishment of the post office you mention in your telegram No. 1.

From—His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. With reference to the questions asked in Your Excellency’s telegram No. 2. Oil Company’s correspondence from Abadan (which place is about 50 minutes distance from Mohammerah) is sent to Head Office here, which des patches it through British Post Office. I am given to understand that the next move which the Persian Postal Department intended to make was to attempt to prevent this correspondence being carried by the Oil Company’s launch and to try and insist that it should be sent to Abadan Persian Post Office. Great inconvenience would be caused to the Oil Company by this and the British Post Office here, would suffer great loss also. Letters despatched from Abadan except by the employes of the Oil Company are practically niL The precedentalso would be inconvenient since Abadan is a British concession and the idea is strongly opposed by the Company. Persians themselves would be surprised at the fact of a Persian Post Office on British owned land. My objections have been based on the grounds that there is no demand for a post office and that the permission of Your Excellency and the owners of the land is required. I am refusing to allow the post office so I presume the next move will be from the Postal Department. Telegram No. 41-130, dated aist January 19*3. p rom —The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. Attempted establishment of Persian Post Office at Abadan, Reference current telegrgphic correspondence and second paragraph of enclosure to my despatch No. 71-2652, October 30th. Oil Company leased from Shaikh in 1908 a square mile of land on Abadan for the purposes of their business under Article three of their concession ; lands are Shaikh’s perpetual property under royal farman. Shaikh and subsequently Oil Company consented to establishment of Customs surveillance post on certain conditions, vide my telegram No. 42-217, March 17th, 1911 : it was understood that du/ies of said Customs were to be restricted to supervision of arrival and despatch of merchandise. Proposal to establish post office there has not been mentioned by Customs to Shaikh, whom Belgians are under an obligation to consult in such matters under his Customs farman of 1903. Nor has a reference been made to Oil Company, in whose con cession post office is situated, and who strongly object to post office for following reasons. Firstly .—For obvious reasons Oil Company are obliged to take very stringent precautions against entrance into concession of unauthorized persons, and establishment of a public post office there would nullify their efforts. Secondly .—They have their own private means of communication by steam launch and motor boat between their works at Abadan and their Head Office at Mohammerah and are also in touch by telephone, and have no need for Persian postal service. Thirdly. —It is of importance to them to insist on their full proprietory rights in concession, with which establishment without their consent of a Persian Post Office is inconsistent.

I have the honour to express my thanks for the information contained in your telegram, No. 41, which will enable me, should the question again be raised, to reply to the Treasurer-General or the Director-General. I am approving the action of Major Haworth in the meanwhile.[Tills Document is the Property of Plis Britannic Maje sty’s Government.] PERSIA. [January 19.] CONFIDENTIAL. Section 1. [2825] No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P. Cox to Sir Edward Grey. — (Received January 19.) (No. 115 .) (Telegraphic.) Bushire, January 19, 1913. RECENT Reuter telegrams emanating from Tehran and London seem to adumbrate that His Majesty’s Government may be giving lively consideration to the pros and cons of the grant of a further respite to the Persian Government for restoring order on the Bushire-Ispahan road and in Ears generally, and, if this is the case, it can only be in conjunction with an extensive scheme for the financing of the Governor- General by Imperial Government. Without touching on prospects of such a scheme, I venture to urge, in case anything of the sort is on the tapis, the importance of our securing from the Persian Government, in return for such forbearance, the preliminary settlement of various desiderata, regulation of which would assist towards the consolidation of our position and legitimate interests. Immediate loss both in trade and prestige which will be involved to us by further long-suffering is so considerable that it would appear gratuitously quixotic for us to refrain from requiring the Persian Government, as a condition of it, to recompense us as far as they can for the damage their impotence brings on us. Satisfaction of our requirements in these matters involves no difficulty or loss of authority or dignity for the Persian Government, and, moreover, it is not our position vis-a-vis of Persia which we seek to better thereby, but our position vis-a-vis of foreign Powers. To the strengthening of this latter position Persia should be interested little less than ourselves, for she must surely now see in Great Britain a friendly Power whose [? aim] it is to uphold her. Desiderata which occurred to me are as follows :— 1. Documentary recognition of our prescriptive rights to control lighting, buoying, and policing of Gulf in the same way that our position has been recognised in respect of quarantine, in regard to which the position might with advantage be reaffirmed incidentally. 2. Documentary recognition as a permanency of the old prescriptive postal rights and privileges which we still enjoy, and an expression of readiness to see those extended to other Persian ports of the Persian Gulf as occasion may require. 3. Undertaking to refrain from giving any lease or concession, commercial or otherwise, in Southern and South-Western Persia (i.e., in the area comprising the British and neutral zones under the Anglo-Russian convention), or in Persian islands of the Gulf, to any foreign subjects or Government, without the knowledge and consent of His Majesty’s Government. We have precedent for such a request in the under taking given by the Shah to the Russian Minister referred to in Mr. Marling’s telegram of 27th August, 1908, to the Foreign Office, repeated by me to India on the following day. This, perhaps, might be secured in the course of current negotiations for mining concessions. 4. Extension of rights of navigation to the Upper Karun. 5. Abandonment of empty claims to sovereignty over Bahrein and recognition of our protective rights over those islands and Trucial Coast and our title to protect their subjects in Persia. 6 . Undertaking to grant option to British company when the time is ripe for formation of lighterage company in Gulf ports. 7. Acceptance of consular officer at Bampur when needed. I make no suggestion here in connection with Kishm-Henjam position, as we appear to be effectively consolidating ourselves in an unobtrusive way, and further openings are likely to offer themselves. I have expressed views on the strategical question in my telegram No. 10, dated 3rd January, to India and Tehran. (Communicated direct to Foreign Office ; repeated to India and Tehran.)

His Majesty’s Minister’s telegram No. 596, dated November 17th, fully justifies the views and apprehensions expressed by me in previous correspondence on this subject and tends to give point to my suggestions that the activities of Belgian administrators in the service of the Persian Government unless they are closely watched, are likely to operate to the prejudice of British interests. As regards the subject under reference it bas always been recognized that the Indian Post Offices in the Persian Gulf are both commercially and politically amongst the most important of our assets and in this connection I would invite Government of India, to His Majesty’s Minister, reference to the marginally cited letter of No. 3S6.-E.A.. dated ,9th September 1905. the Government of India and connected correspondence. 3. With reference to my allusions thereto in my telegram of 13th October Telegram No.240-1138, dated 13th October, copy His Majesty s Minister, I may mention forwarded to Government of India with Residency that the intention to insinuate a Persian ^ letter No. 2^93 of October 13th. Post Office into the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s concession at Abadan has materialised (without any reference to His Majesty’s Consul or the Oil Company) but as the matter is still the subject of local correspondence, and a reference to higher authority may prove superfluous, I merely mention the matter incidenlfl^jy. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to His Majesty’s Minister. No. 218. Sir, Tehran. October 2 ist t igi 2 . In his despatch No. 223 of December 1904, His Majesty’s Charge d’Affaires had the honour to lay before His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs a difficulty which had arisen between the Persian Department of Customs and Posts and the British Post Office at Bushire. Relations between the two parties would seem to have been harmonious since that date and His Majesty’s Consul General appears to attribute this fortunate state of affairs to the fact that the present Director of Posts at Bushire, a Persian, who has held the position for many years, is conciliatory and satisfac tory. Sir Percy Cox considers that this official is able to do all that is needed in co-operation with the Customs Administration and the British Post office. It has however recently come to my notice that the Persian Minister of Posts intends to appoint one of two recently engaged Belgian postal officials as Director of Posts for the Bushire district. After making enquiries of the Treasurer-General who confirms this information and states that the extent of the district has not yet been clearly defined, I requested His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire to let me know whether he saw any objection to the arrange ment. Sir Percy Cox has favoured me with his views in a telegram of which I have the honour to enclose a paraphrase, V' ’’ v - \ 'V \ 1 Wi Pv H i ^ ‘ ^ f a / * \ &gt; f i Lf^h- iI concur in the views expressed in this telegram, and consider that it would be prejudicial to British interests to allow an appointment of the proposed nature to be made. Recent difficulties experienced on the Shiraz road where a strike of postmen was only brought to a conclusion by the intervention of His Majesty’s Acting Consul at Shiraz and myself have not impressed me favourably regarding the ability or tact of the Belgian Administrator General of Posts here and I do not think it advisable to increase his powers by allowing this appointment or by effecting a change in existing arrangements as regards postal affairs in the Gulf, The present volume of correspondence at Bushire and in the Gulf does not justify an expensive change in the present system and I understand that this opinion is privately shared by the Treasurer-General. I have therefore brought to the notice of Monsieur Mornard the objections to this appointment and have requested him to hold the matter in abeyance until 1 have ascertained the views of His Majesty’s Government who have special postal interests in the region affected. I have the honour to be, with the highest Respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servant, (Sd.) W. TOWNLEY. The Right Honourable Sir Edward Grey, Baronet, K.G., M.P., etc., etc., etc. Paraphrase of telegram No. 240 of October 14 th, 1912^ from H&lt;s Majestys Consul-General, Bushire. Proposed appointment of a Belgian Director of Post, Bushire. Under date of September 15th, I addressed a despatch to the Legation expressing the opinion that the increase in the number of Belgian officials in the south of Persia is generally opposed to our interests : in the present connection there are specific reasons for deprecating this further appointment. 1 would urge that in any case the parlous state of the finances of Southern Persia, which is forming the subject of separate correspondence, gives us ample grounds for objecting to the establishment of another expensive Belgian official as unnecessary in practice and unjustifiable in theory. On every occasion in the past on which they have been identified with the Post Office, Belgian officials (doubtless at first under Russian influence) have endeavoured to interpret the postal rules in a manner calculated to curtail our prescriptive privileges in postal matters in the Gulf Ports and to ignore in general the special position we enjoy there. Shortly after their arrival they attempted to force us to abandon the Indian Postal rates in the Post Offices of the Persian Gulf, a privilege which we had enjoyed for 40 years, I would invite a reference to Legation Despatch No. 223 to the Foreign Office of December 9th, 1904, etc., for further examples. Again when the Belgians took over the control of the posts in Arabistan in 1905 one of their first steps was to endeavour to abolish the private courriers of British merchants. They made, however, no attempt to improve the postal facilities in return. It was found necessary in this case to enter a ^vigorous protest at Tehran to obtain a fair examination of the matter. Copies of correspondence reached me from India only by last mail showing that an unsuccessful attempt had been made by the Director-General of PostsD- 44—29 i-ij—CBP Simla 3 in Tehran to enter into direct negotiation with the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in India on the subject of an important question which affected the Bushire Post Office. Correspondence showed that the attention of the Belgian Director had to be called to our special position with an intimation that the matter could only properly be considered when submitted through the usual diplomatic channels. In recent times, as is proved by Shiraz telegrams, this summer the inter vention of Belgian officials in postal affairs has prejudiced rather than improved matters. A further instance of activity recently reported by His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah and which will have to be referred soon to Tehran if persisted in is the proposal to place a Persian Post Office at Abadan on the Oil Com pany’s concession. I can see indeed no reason for the appointment of a Belgian Director in a Gulf Port. As to Bushire, the present Persian Director has occupied the post for many years; he is conciliatory and gives satisfaction, and, with the co-opera tion of the Customs and the British Post Office, is quite able to do all that is required. I would mention here that the difficulties experienced by Shiraz are said to occur practically exclusively on the north side of Kazerun. With regard to the other ports I do not consider that the Arabistan, Isfahan, Bandar Abbas, Kerman services could in practice be put under the control of a Director at Bushire. Telegram No. 596, dated the 17th November 1912. From—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, To—His Majesty's Foreign Office, London. Treasurer-General has submitted to me a lengthy correspondence which has passed between Director-General of Posts and himself upon the subject of the necessity of a Belgian postal inspector in the south. This suggestion has been approved by Minister of Posts. It is clear from this correspondence that one of chief objects of Director-General is to obtain abolition of British post offices in certain Gulf Ports.

Is any objection seen by you to the arrangement ? Telegram (P.), No. 240-1138, dated 13th October 1912. From—The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—His Majesty’s Minister, Tehran. (Repeated Foreign, Simla, by post.) I have the honour to reply to your telegram No. 232, dated 9th October 1/1912. In my judgment, as I have urged in a despatch dated 15th September, our interests generally are opposed to this multiplication of Belgians in the South, and there are specific grounds for holding this view in the present instance. In any case, I submit, the parlous state of the finances of Southern Persia gives us ample reason to object to the entertainment of another expensive Belgian functionary as being unjustifiable financially and from a practical point of view unnecessary. The Belgian Administration, whenever they have been identified with the Persian Post Office in the past, has sought (at first doubtless under Russian influence! to whittle away our prescriptive postal privileges in the Gulf Ports by means of the Postal Union Rules, and generally has been prone to ignore our position. One of the first steps they took was to press for the abandonment in our Persian Gulf post offices of Indian inland rates, a privilege which we had for 40 years enjoyed. For later examples of this, see Legation despatch No. 223, to His Majesty’s Foreign Office, dated 9th December 1904, and the enclosures to Legation despatch No. 1 of 1905 to Bushire. Again, one of the first acts of the Belgians when, in 1905, they took over charge of the Posts in Arabistan, was to make an attempt to stop the use of private couriers by British firms, whilst making no effort to provide better postal facilities. In order to secure equitable treatment of that question, His Majesty’s Minister found it necessary to make a vigorous protest in Tehran. Copies of correspondence received only last mail from India show that the Director-General of Posts in Tehran has recently tried without success to enter into direct negotiations, in regard to an important matter affecting the Bushire Post Office, with the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in India, and it was necessary to remind him of our special position, and inform him that the question could be properly dealt with only through the usual diplomatic channels. The recent intervention of the Belgians in local postal administration has in no way improved matters, but the contrary,—see Shiraz telegrams Nos. 132, 143 and 167. A further instance of activity, which, if persevered with, will have to form the subject of a reference to Your Excellency, is the expressed intention of placing a Persian Post Office within the Concession of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Abadan, which His Majesty’s Consul, Mohammerah, recently reported. In reality there is no raison d'etre for a Belgian Postal Director in a Gulf Port. As regards Bushire, the present Persian Director has been here many years; he gives satisfaction and is conciliatory, and in conjunction with the British Post Office and the Customs, can do all that is needed; difficulties con nected with Shiraz post occur on Shiraz side of Kazeroon.3 As regards other ports it would not, in my opinion, be possible in practice tor the Director at Bushire to supervise the postal services between Bunder Abbas and Kerman and between Arabistan and Ispahan.

Townley to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received November 7 .) gj r ^ Tehran, October 20 , 1912 . ’ IN his despatch No. 223 of the 9 th December, 1904 , His Majesty’s charge d’affaires had the honour to lay before His Majesty’s Principal Secretory of State for Foreign Affairs a difficulty which had arisen between the Persian department of customs and posts and the British post office at Bushire. Relations between the two parties would seem to have been harmonious since that date, and His Majesty’s consul-general appears to attribute this fortunate state of affairs to the fact that the present director of posts at Bushire, a Persian, who has held the position for many years, is conciliatory and satisfactory. Sir Percy Cox considers that this official is able to do all that is needed in co-operation with the Customs administration and the British post office. # It has, however, recently come to my notice that the Persian Minister^ of Posts intends to appoint one of two recently engaged Belgian postal officials as director of posts for the Bushire district. After making enquiries of the treasurer-general, who confirms this information, and states that the extent of the district [has not yet been clearly defined, I requested His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire to let me know whether he saw any objection to the arrangement. Sir Percy Cox has favoured me with his views in a telegram of which 1 have the honour to enclose a paraphrase. . i j I concur in the views expressed in this telegram, and consider that it would be prejudicial to British interests to allow an appointment of the proposed nature to be made. Recent difficulties experienced on the Shiraz road, where a strike of postmen was only brought to a conclusion by the intervention of His Majesty’s acting consul at Shiraz and myself, have not impressed me favourably regarding the ability or tact of the Belgian administrator-general of posts here, and I do not think it advisable to increase his powers by allowing this appointment or by effecting a change in existing arrangements as regards postal affairs in the Gulf. ^ . . r The present volume of correspondence at Bushire and m the Gulf does not justi y an expensive change in the present system, and I understand that this opinion is privately shared by the treasurer-general. . . ,. , ,v- I have therefore brought to the notice of M. Mornard the objections to this appointment, and have requested him to hold the matter in abeyance until I have ascertained the views of His Majesty’s Government, who have special postal interests m the rejdon affected O I have, &amp;c.

Townley. ■y i i • \ p Bushire, October 14 , 1912 . .eiegrapme.) r. , . ,, , -q • PROPOSED appointment of a Belgian director of posts, 15 ushire Under date of the 15 th September I addressed a despatch to the legation express- g the opinion that the .increase in the number of Belgian officials m he south of ersia is generally opposed to our interests ; in the present connection there are spec lasons for deprecating this further appointment. &lt; 5 nnthem I would uroe that in any case the parlous state of the finances of Southern ersia, which is forming the subject of separate correspondence, u® ^ ,r objecting to the establishment of another expensive Belgian official as unnecessary 1 practice and unjustifiable in theory. On every occasion mthe past on wbcl^they ave been identified with the post office, Belgian officiaiipdoulitj^ at 1 ussian influence) have endeavoured to interpret the p st *calculated to curtail our prescriptive privileges in postal matters in the Gulf ports, and to ignore in general the special position we enjoy there. Shortly aftei then airi\al they attempted to force us to abandon the Indian postal rates in the post offices of the Persian Gulf, a privilege which we had enjoyed for forty years. 1 would invite a reference to legation despatch No. 223 to the boreign Office of the 9 th Decembei, 1904 ^,.^ &amp;c., for further examples. . Again, when the Belgians took over the control of the posts in Arahistan m 1905 , one of their first steps was to endeavour to abolish the private couiiers of l^ntish merchants. They made, however, no attempt to improve the postal facilities in return. It was found necessary in this case to enter a vigorous protest at lehran to obtain a fair examination of the matter. . Copies of correspondence reached me from India only by last mail showing that an unsuccessful attempt had been made by the director-general of posts in Tehran to enter into direct negotiation with the director-general of posts and telegraphs in India, on the subject of an important question which affected the Bushire post office. Correspondence showed that the attention of the Belgian director had to be called to our special position with an intimation that the matter could only properly be considered when submitted through the usual diplomatic channels. In recent times as is proved by Shiraz telegrams this summer the intervention of Belgian officials in postal affairs has prejudiced rather than improved matters. A further instance of activity recently reported by His Majesty’s consul at Mohammerah, and which will have to be referred soon to Tehran if persisted in, is the proposal to place a Persian post office at Abadan on the oil company’s concession. _ . _ I can see indeed no reason for the appointment of a Belgian director in a Cult port. As to Bushire, the present Persian director has occupied the post for many years; he is conciliatory and gives satisfaction, and, with the co-operation of the Customs and the British post office, is quite able to do all that is required. I would mention here that the difficulties experienced by Shiraz are said to occur practically exclusively on the north side of Kazerun. With regard to the other ports, I do not consider that the Arabistan, Ispahan, Bunder-Abbas, Kerman services could in practice be put under the control of a director at Bushire.copy- /!

I have the honour to state that I concur in Mr. Lorimer’s view, and would propose, subject to your approval, to so inform him. I have, &amp;c. GERARD LOWTHER. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Consul-General Lorimer to Government of India. (Confidential.) Sir, Bagdad, October 30, 1911. 1 HAVE the honour to submit herewith copy of a letter and enclosure, dated the 29th September, 1911, which I have received from the Postmaster-General, Bombay, relating to a proposal made by the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs in Turkey. 2. The present arrangements regarding mails at Bagdad are known to the authorities in India, and need not be described here. Certain closed mails are exchanged between the British and Turkish post-offices at Bagdad, but these contain neither letters and parcels from abroad for Bagdad and its suburbs, nor letters and parcels from Bagdad and its suburbs for abroad. Letters and articles belonging to these tw r o classes form, of course, much the larger and more important part of the British mail, and to transfer them to the closed mail service would be to do away with the bulk of the British post-office’s business by making it over to the Turkish post-office. 3. The object of the Turkish proposal is evident; it is to abolish the British \ post-office here in so far as this can be done at a single step. Under the Turkish proposal the incoming mail would be taken to the Turkish post-office instead of to the British, and would be distributed by it. (It may be remarked, in passing, that even the residency official mail, besides private and commercial correspondence in general, would thus pass through Turkish hands prior to delivery. It would be delayed, and might be tampered with.) The only function remaining to the British post-office at Bagdad would apparently be to dispatch to the Persian Gulf, India, and Europe such communications as were still entrusted to it in preference to the Turkish office by senders, and it cannot be doubted that the Turkish postal authorities would soon draw attention to such an “anomalous survival,” and request its abolition. If this further demand were conceded the British post-office at Bagdad would cease to exist, or at least would have no regular postal work to do. 4. It is probably unnecessary that I should devote time or space to proving that the abolition of the British post-office at Bagdad would be a mistake, and little or nothing short of a calamity. The present state of Turkey as regards political disorganisation and the inefficiency of the public services is a matter of common knowledge. I have very recently had occasion to remark on the unsatisfactory working of the Turkish post- office in this very province (see summary of events for September 1911). On the other hand, it is no idle boast to say that among the few stable and efficient public institutions at Bagdad are the British residency and its connected establishments, among which the post-office is perhaps the most generally useful. The British post-office at Bagdad is patronised to a large extent by the foreign consulates and foreign firms at Bagdad, wdio, even in correspondence with Europe, often prefer it, because of its accurate and reliable working, to the more rapid but less certain Turkish [2294 d—3]2 overland mails via Damascus and Aleppo. Any interference with it would be widely deplored, and w r ould unfavourably affect trade. 5. It should be mentioned that there is no delay in distributing the British mail at Bagdad. The British mail-steamer’s approximate time of arrival is known before* hand T she whistles on arrival, and the mail is sorted for delivery immediately, if the hour permits, otherwise the next morning. If the Turkish post-office were to be brought into the matter there would be no acceleration of delivery it is safe to say, but the reverse—at least in the case of those for whose use the British post-office primarily exists. Similarly there is no delay in dispatching the British mail from Bagdad after the advertised hour of its closing. 6. To touch at all on the political aspect of the question would be superfluous. The surrender of a long-enjoyed privilege without compensation, to the general detriment and for no valid reason at all, would be unjustifiable from the national standpoint. The maintenance of the British post-office at Bagdad is now more than ever essential as a set-off to the German Bagdad Railway and the advantages for Germany which it will bring in its train. A better case could probably be made out for the abolition of the British post- office at Constantinople, where the Turkish administration is more efficient than here, and the means of communication with places abroad are more speedy and numerous ; but, unless I am much mistaken, any such subversive proposal would be rejected, in limine, as inconsistent with the prescriptive rights of the British Government in Turkey. . . . 7. I am advising the Postmaster-General, Bombay, by means of a copy of this letter, that he should not in any way entertain the Turkish proposals without orders from the Government of India, the question raised being of political importance. It will be observed that the Turkish Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs has endeavoured to snatch a favourable decision from the Postmaster-General, Bombay, as if the matter were one of detail merely, instead of addressing himself to the chief postal authority in India, or—as with still greater propriety, in view of the tians- parently political character of his proposal, he might have done causing the mattei to be raised in a diplomatic manner at Constantinople. It is also significant that the Turkish Director-General’s letter contains no reference to the subsidies at present paid loy the Government of India for the carriage of the mails on the Bombay-Bagdad line, in regard to which, if the British post-office at Bagdad were abolished, modifications would have to be made. It was evidently intended, I venture to think, that the scope of the Turkish proposals should not be perceived until they had been accepted. 8. I am instructing the postmaster, Bagdad, not to make any change in the procedure now followed here without my assent, which will not be given without orders from the Government of India. 9 . The letter of the Turkish Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs to the Postmaster-General, Bombay, might in the first case, perhaps, be left unanswered. If a reminder should be received from him it might be replied that his proposal does not commend itself to the Government of India, who foresee no advantage from its adoption. The Turkish Director-General would then be obliged either to drop his proposal altogether or to commit it to diplomatic channels. I have &amp;c J. G.

I HAVE the honour to forward a copy of a letter, dated the 24 th August, 1911 , from the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Turkey, and to request that you will kindly let me know whether there is any objection, from a political point of view, to the acceptance of the proposal made by the Turkish Post Office. In the meantime, the Indian postmaster of Bagdad has been instructed to take your orders regarding the3 disposal of any closed mails addressed to Bombay that may be received by him from the Turkish post-office at that place. 2. In connection with this question I beg to invite a reference to the correspon dence ending with your office letter, dated the 6th July, 1887, addressed to my office. I have, &amp;c. E. A. DORAN. Enclosure 3 in No. 1. Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, Turkey, to Postmaster-General, Bombay. Constantinople, August 24, 1911. I HAA^E the honour to inform you that communications originating in India intended for Bagdad and its neighbourhood are enclosed in the closed mails from your office at Bombay for the British office at Bagdad, and are transmitted by the latter to the Turkish office at that place for being delivered or forwarded onward to their destination. Those coming from Bagdad and neighbourhood intended for India are likewise transmitted by the Turkish office at Bagdad to the British office at the same place for being forwarded onward to their destination. You will concur with me, I think, in considering that the intervention of the British post-office at Bagdad in exchange of these communications is quite useless, and onlv tends to make them suffer delay. With a view to obviating such delays, my administration has decided to shortly have closed mails from the Turkish office at Bagdad made up for the office at Bombay, and to enclose therein all the mails intended for India and the Far East. I shall be obliged if you will be so good as to instruct, on your side, the office at Bombay to make up at the earliest date possible the reciprocal closed mails for the Turkish office at Bagdad, and to enclose therein the communications intended for Bagdad and beyond. I trust that you will favourably dispose of my proposal, and will let me know the date from which the Bombay office will dispatch direct mails to the Turkish office at Bagdad.Earn I</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000087_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/242</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x000087</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/242</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 1912/897 Pt 1 ‘Persian Gulf.
