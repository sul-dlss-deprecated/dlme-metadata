May it please Your Excellency, I,the undersigned, Amir of Jalan, have the honour to address this for the kind consideration 'by Your Excellency in Council. As Your Excellency and the Members of Your Excell- -ency's Council are aware, Jalan is an independent state wituated in Southern Arabia to the South Muscat. As announced by the Government of India in the General Notice dated first Ramzan 1338 that the Principality of the Amir of Jalan are allies with the Muscat Government and the Translate -ion of the same is herewith attached for your information, rhe State of Jalan comprises a territory of about 500 miles and has the population of about a lac. The Amirs of Jalan and their ancestors have at all times remained loyal and faithful allies of the British Gov- -ernment and have on all occasions rendered very high and valuable services to the British Kmpire, as shown by the letters written by Sir Percy Cox and the true teanslation of the same is annexed hereto. During the Great War, I, as the present Amir of Jalan State, not only remained neutral byt dremainedyHKHjEi: rendered very valuable assistance to the British and their allies, and among other things I may mention that when the crew of a British ship which was I stranded in the Port of Ras Rakhaba we rendered very valuable assistance, which has been recognised by the British official If necessary I beg to refer to the letters of recognition of the services rendered, written by the Political Agents of Muscat and Consulate of Muscat. /I ■ ? I 1 k 3 ® We further draw your attention that during the War there was a restriction of export of rice from India, and we approached the Government of India through our representative at Bombay directly and our request was granted, without any consultation or confirmation, as a special case, and the copy of the same sanction is attached herewith for your favourable consideration. At present I have come on a visit to India and touring India about two months. I intend staying in . India for about a month more. In view of the facts and circumstances mentioned above, I have the honour to request a favour. formerly we were getting all the arms and ammunit- -ion from Muscat and also direct from Kurope, but since the War, as Your Excellency and His Council are probably aware, the importation of arms and ammunition in Muscat has become difficult and we cannot get there direct arms and ammunition for our own territory. I intend therefore to make purchase of some arms and ammunition Sax in Bombay for the purpose of taking them to Jalan or to order them direct to Jalan through Sur, which is a port of my territory, and with that view I openedliegotiations with the firm of ammunition 1 merchants in Bombay and carried on correspondence with the Political Agent in Bombay, but in reply to my request the Political Agent has written to say that I should produce'a 'no objection' certificate from the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty^ Consul at Muscat authorizing to supply the rifles and ammunition'. I submit that this request of the Political Department of Bombay is not fair to me as the Ruler of an independent State and it would be highly detrimental to my dignity to ask for consent or certificate from the Political Agent of Muscat. I hold the Political Agent at Muscat in high regard but I think you will appreciate that I prefer, to !3 to preserve the dignity of my State, not to do an act detrimental to its independent possession. I aay here refer to the sanction of the Rice Eyport which was granted to me 'by the Government of India as a special case without any interference of the Muscat Government. With that object in view I now request Your Excellency in Council to consider the whole case from my point of view and to give your necessary sanction that I may be permitted to take away with me a very small quantity of arms and ammunition at present that I may require for my own use. I may at once state that for the present I want to carry ten rifles and about ten thousand bullets for the use of myself and my body-guards. Further I may say that my desire is to buy arms and ammunition only of British make and not of any foreign make. In view of the relationship existing between my State and the British Kmpire I trust this small request will certainly meet with a favourable reply and I request Your Excellency in Council to dispose of this application as an urgent one as I wish to have your reply before I leave Bombay at the end of this month.

The Amirs of Jaalan employ at Bombay a broker,7«rho sells their date® and dried fish^and in return sends rice and other ^oods to Sur« The name of this broker is Abdul la Saleh,a man of negroid extract- -ion,who dresses in very shabby European clothes and has a slight knov/ledge of English. It is generally considered that it is this individual who is to a*1- great extent the originator of the letters which JuLahomed bin Kasir has deemed fit to address to tne txovernment of India. Mr♦ ±5.Thomas,financial Adviser,was in Bombay during tne firbt half of last January with a view to proceeding on H.M.S.'Triad 11 to Dhofar to embark His Highness the Sultan,and,acting on my suggestion,he put himself in touch with Mahomed bin Uasir,and with the approval of the Senior .Naval Officer offered him a passage to his country in order that he should make preparations for the visit of the Anglo Persian Oil Company^ geologists. It had been arranged that these gentlemen would travel on 'Triad' to Dhofar,survey this place in so far time permitted,and would then visit a certain locality within the influence of the Amirs of Jaalan and of Shaikh I'ansur bin Nasir al Majali. Mahomed bin ITasir accepted the offer of the passage and was dis- -embarked in the limits of his country,H.IT.S..'Triad' then pro- -ceeding to Dhofar. Shaikh Mansur had been previously asked by this Political Agency , to meet H.i. ♦S.'Triad' and to exert his influence with the local Bedouin tribes to allow the geologists to carry out the survey # of the mainland opposite the island of Hamur an iTafar. On the arrival of H.IT.S.'Triad' off Hamur an ITafar island on her return from Dhofar both ohaikh Kansur and 1'ahomed bin ITasir were round to be present with a number of tribesmen. The geologists ./ere met in a . riendly manner and v/ere able to carry out their survey. * The geologists presented on behalf of the Anglo Persian Oil Com- —pany Rs.750 each^to the two Chiefs and two second hand rifles. ?ahomed bin ^asir subsequently deputed his youngest brother^ Shaikh Hamdan bin Hasir,to attend His Highness the Sultan up to Muscat. •Shaikh Hamdan has had two interviews with me since his arrival. He has evidently been instructed by his brother to assert the in- -dependence of Jaalan,while protesting that the '^mirs' are friendly allies of both Muscat and of the British. He was also to get permission to purchase 12 rifles and 10,000rounds of ammunition* I reminded Shaikh Hamdan that the ransom paid for the kidnapped Hindu Teas still outstanding,hut his only proposal was that this sum should 'be forgiven* f He eventually said that he would 'bring the matter to his 'brothers notice. It is quite clear that the ITali of Sur has not the least chance of recovering this ransom money without pressure 'being /• exerted through this Political Agency on the Jaalan Amirs# The claim of the Jaalan Amirs that they are independent of Muscat is one that cannot stand a moment's scrutiny from the his- -torical point of view. In 1820 during the reign of Sultan Saiyid Saeed a disast|rous expedition was undertaken by this Sultan in conjunction 7/ith the British against the 3eni hu Ali of Jaalan.This tribe had embraced the Wahabi tenets and in other ways had incurred His Highness* di6pleasure &gt; and &gt; so far as the British were concerned,the tribes- -men had murdered the interpreter of H»lf»S»'Mercury' • The com- -bined forces were shipped to Sur and thence invaded the Beni bu Ali country^ They suffered a very serious defeat. In the following year,lS21 &gt; a large force was despatched under CJeneral Sir Lionel Smith from Bombay,which inflicted a decisive defeat on the Beni bu Ali. The ?ort of Sur has always paid customs duties to the Muscat State and still does so. Theoretically,and practically as regards the collection of cus- -toms duties at Sur,the Amirs of Jaalan are subjects of His High- -ness the Sultan. These Amirs are also subsidised by the Muscat State,and an allow- -ance of 100 dollars a month is regularly paid by the Muscat State Treasury.This sum was apparently first paid in 1891,but the Muscat State Records are in such confusion that it is not poss- —ible to trace the full history of this allowance. As regards the origin of the title of 'Ainir'by which these Jaalan bhaikhs are known the same difficulty is again experienced owing to the lack of archives. It is however generally believed that this title was assumedsi Isy or given to the Beni bu Ali Shaikhs in 1800 at the time of the Wahabi ascendency# As is well known to. the Hon^ourable the Political Resident^this title in Arabia is frequently conferred on Governors and Deputy Governors - as tiui in the case o::' the Amir of Hasa* It may also be stressed that these Amirs are by no mean^ all powerful in Jaalan,as there is a lar^e rival tribe antago- -nistic to them,the Beni bu Hassan. The Beni bu Ali are Wahabis and of the Ghafiri political faction. The Beni bu Hassan are of the Abadhi sect and Hinawi in politics. The Muscat State is at present weak and feeble,and in the circumstances any petty Chieftain or tribe can with impunity claiic independence. however trust that when the purchase of a steamer is completed and officials of the State are enabled to travel up and down the coast^a very considerable change for the better will occur# In this connection it may not be out of place to mention that since His Highness returned from Dhofar a very noticeable change is apparent in his interest in matters of State. Instead of reiterating to the Political Agent that any attention to public matters makes him feel giddy in his head &gt; he now dis- -cusses State affairs with great interest and has announced his intention to make a prolonged tour in the neighbourhood of bohar after the Id. It is indeed most satisfactory to see this change in His Highness. In view of the facts noted in this letter I would submit that the Government of India should take no notice of the Amir T s claim for independence. As regards his request for rifles and ammunition,I have discussed the matter with His Highness and the latter is of opinion that it is undesirable at the present juncture to re- 1 -fuse i^n toto the request.The only place in His Highness 1 terli- -tory where traces of oil have been found is within the Jaalan Amir's territorial influence. He suggests that a 'No objection Certificate ,, for 5 rifles and1,000 rounds 'be issued^and I a^ree with His Highness * views. Should the Hon^le the Political Resident concur,! recom- -mend that the Amir of Jaalan be given to understand that any- further sanction for rifles and ammunition will depend on a satisfactory termination of the Hindu's ransom claim# I attach copies of such documents mentioned hy the Amir as having emanated from this office as can 'be traced# In no way can such documents 'be held to denote the indepsndence of the Amirs. It is customary for the Political Agent^Muscat,to address the Shailchs of trihes direct and not through the Muscat Government* I have the honour to 'be.

I now enclose a copy of a letter JHo. 16, dated the 8th February 19^6, from the lolitical Agent, iluacat, on the aubject. 2. 1 have replied to I-aJor Barrett that he can tell Muhammad bin Kasir that he will give him a ho Objection certificate for the import of 10 rifles and 2,000 rounds of ammunition if the Amir will first arrange for the refund to the Wali of f&gt;ur of the ransom paid by the Muscat Government on behalf of the Hikmanis, who are under his control, in connection with the kidnapping of Kersandas Lalji. 5. As regards the claim to independence, I beg to refer you to Vol. I ^art 1 of the Caaette»r of the Persian Gulf (191&amp;), page 462 onwards. At the head of p. 464 it is stated that the Ban! Bu , Ali, of whom Amir loihaKinad bin Masir isS is one of the Shaikhs, wore in 1820 in open rebellion against the Sultan's Crovernment. Prom this it is clear that the Anlr was subordinate to the Tultan of Muscat, and ho still is, as Customs duties are paid by the port of ^ur to Muscat, and the Amirs receive a subsidy there from that 3tate. On pa^e 465 it is stated ^hat the tribe have never fully recovered the position which they once held in Oman. Jhls was true in 1915, but the Ms cat State has iipvkx perhaps never been so weak A as it is now and this accounts for the Amirpreposterous claim to independence. 4.

Barrett informs me that the Muscat State rej^id on the 2nd September 192&amp; to the Bunniahs the ransom, which the latter had paid to the Bedouin. he new Wali of Sur, Saiyid Hamad ibn Hilal, has informed the Muscat Government that the only way to put pressure on the Hikman is to seize two or three of their tribesmen when visiting Sur. The Vali, however, does not recommend this in view of the precarious position of the Muscat Government in ^ur, as it might merely be playing into the hands of rhaikh Itohammad bin Basir, the Amir of Jaalan, who is setting up a claim to independence. Barpett adds that the Muscat Government hope to be in a posit* •ion after they have completed the purchase of a steamer to regain some of their lost authority in Eur and Jaalan. 3. he habitat of the Hikman tribe 60 years ago was in independent Oman^but sinoe then they have attached themselves partly to the Bani Bu 'Ali and partly to the Chief of Abu Dhabi, who has interests in Baraimi.

In spite oj the unreli ability of tiie irregulars the '/ali says he would not welcome a Muscat Infantry detachment posted in Soor as a permanency % as he considers it would be provocative to trie tribes. If the detachment were stationed at Jlukraimata.in, which is the harbour, it could easily be cut off from its water which is ^ drawn ffom Bilad 4 miles off, while if it were stationed at ^ A1 Heis fort which commands the water supply the tribes could cut it off from any reinforcements that might be sent from I useat by sea. I am informed that tne E&amp;nd buuAljLi Shaikh has recently . tola the Council of Ministers tuat the J an ah 'Port near Bilad ■ which&lt;a) v:hich is occupied by Muscat irregulsrs is in a tumbled down condition and that they should take immediate steps to re pair it. A number of tribal Shr-ilchs appear to imagine that they have p. better ri^ht in Soor than any one else end though they tolerate the Mali's x- )rcs,snce * they assert their rifjht by levying toll on all and sundry on every occasion that they honour the town with their presence. I have al ready referred in para 2 of this letter to the complaints of the Bunniahs in this matt.er. The Wali who appears to be in terror of the tribes says he is quite powerless to pre vent the action of tneir chiefs. I'ly visit to Soor has convinced me that the authority of the Liuscat State in Soor is negligible at the moment end that its restoration must be a very slow business. The amount of the ri.nsom originally paid by a Bunniah for the release of the cook Kersandas Lalji and subsequently refunded to him by the Muscat State, was pa.id over to Shaikh T r ahomed bin ?Tasir of the Bani bu .Mi. The 'ali thinks it quite possible that it went jio further than the pockets of this Shaikh. For this reason and also owing to his dread of Arab attack he does not recommend the seizure of Hikmani tribesmen visiting Soor. If the Government of India should insist that the Hik- . manis must hand over at once both the ransom and a fine in addition it would be necessary for them to ta.ke tne recovery in hand themselves. In this event tne presence at Soor of one of tUM's ships to enforce their demands would be neces sary and T understand that the Hon'ble the Political iResideni wishes to avoid this course. ' recommend therefore that Government should take no direct action at present but, while not withdrawing their demand for the punishment of the guilty, should support the State as far as possible in tneir efforts to regain their authority at Soor. When tne State regains control incidents of this sort will cease. « /.part from the immdeiate question at issue ' submit thatthat Government cannot permit the extortion practised on their subjects 'by irresponsilDle tribal chiefs, v/'hlch came to ray notice during my visit to Soor. T am bringing this matter to the notice of the Council of Ministers, wnd will keep the undesir able state of affairs at 3oor constantly before their eyes and see that they ta .ke measures to improve it* The Sultan and some of his Ministers think that the des patch of the steamer they propose to purchase to Soor will im prove their position there, but ' do not consider thet constant visits paid by a small steamer will suffice to restore Tluscat authority. X am inclined to think that the posting c T a Muscat Infantry detachment in the neighbourhood is essential, but be fore recommending this course to the ftate i em awaiting the return of Captain Eccles who is at present on leave♦ He will be in a position to advise me regarding the location and numbers of the troops necessary to hold the town and its water supply. Any attempts tp improve the condition of affairs at Soor, just as in the rest of the State, are handicapped by the com plete lack of cash. Tt is difficult to balance the budget even while making no allowance for extra expenditure such as the es tablishment of a military post must involve. Cj 5 Political Agent &lt;P- H.'B.T'^s Consul, Muscat. ■ P.S. Since writing this memorandum ' r have received the Hon'ble the Resident *s telegram 3?o.250 of 10th April and I am addressing Shaikh ITahomed Nasir and Shaikh Abdulla of th'e Eani bu Ali in the terms directed.0 QxT? IDSI-TT I.'lL &gt; ■9f D.O. No'. Jtj*]- Tuscat, 16th April 1926» Dear 11 PROPOSED POPT OF KILiSSAB By the courtesy of Gapt. ¥.C, Tancred B.N, I proceeded to Khassah in E.r.S. Crocus on 7th instant. It was not convenient for an Arah official of the State to accompany ine # On arrival T discovered that the '^ali v/as absent in Hen jam. E.E.S. Crocus had to leave Khassah the follov/ing day so that conditions were not favourable for my making a trip into the hills to investigate matters at first hand, though the Shaikh of Khassah, 3aif hin Sulaiman, was 'nre-oareo to- accompany me. I was ahle to land and have conver sations with the Shaikh, with the '7ali*s retainers and others. The information thus hastily gleaned should 'be verified on a fu^ture and more protracted visit, | The Sultan's authority is vested in a ''ali Saiyid I!uhammad. 'bin Badr who has held this post for 19 years State revenues are in a measure collected and go en- tire 1 ^ to the 'Tali in lieu of salary. He pays nothing into the Kuscat Treasury and draws nothing from it These revenues consist of Zakat from the date gardens at Khassah and other coastal village gardens, and Bait al Mai from a Government garden at Sih. In lattei1 years date disease has diminished this income so that the -ali until quite'recently sat.in I'uscat for nine months unwilling to return to his nost. Ee is reimW ■ 'i —reputed to 'be a drunkard and of little account 'but it has 'been found impossilDie ^to find a substitute for Mm. He spends much of his time in Hen jam I 'believe. The .Tali ♦s influence with the interior trihes is negligible ( he has made one tour during his 'period of office ) except through the Shaikh: his relations with the Shaikh are outwardly if distantly friendly. TJith a garrison of only four men he ^plays second fiddle* to the Shaikh, v/ho incidentally is the paramount Shaikh of the Bani Hidiyah i.e., one of the two 'big confederations which together make up the SHIHUH. The Bani Hidiy ah form largely the interior Badu elements of Huus A1 Jehal The other confederation the Kamazirah known sometimes as Bani Shatair has for Its para mount Shaikh Salih 'bin Kuhamrnad who lives at Baiah The Kamaz irah are primarily fishermen 'but have Badu elements too. Although the SEIHUH are nirjtwiyah throughout (Shafi) their constituents the Bani Hidiyah and the Kamazirah are hereditary enemies. Peace prevails at the moment 'but collis ions occur from time to time. They coalesce however if one or other is attacked hy the Q,uwasim, The respective Shaikhs of Baiah and Khassah, Salih and Said divide Huus A1 Jehal 'between them. Judged numerically the former is perhats slightly stronger In importance vis a vis Kh.assah and the mountain trihes immediately behind Sa'id is the bigger man. His protection for the traveller is said to be good as far as Sih. The trade route inland from Khassab passes I was told through Sail Ali, Sail Sultan, Sima, ^uhaiba, Sail Stam to Sih. Sail Ali is said to be six hours riding distance from the port: Sih fifteen hours.(This needs verification) Beyond the• » . 3 the latter point a wall of mountains makes impossible further animal transport. Up to and around this point Bani Hidiyah tribal sections met with are Bani Zaid l!ansur and Bani Lazyad; also the DHUEURIYIIT: it marks the limit of Shaikh Sa f ids influence. Beyond it the KhanaMlah and Bani L'arra own allegiance to Shaikh Salih. Kiassah is thus not the. only port for the interior uplands. Luch of what trade there is E. G. Bani Judaid section, passes more freely to the ports of Diba and Lima. On the Trucial coast side the Hahus trade exclusively with Hams and Has al Khaim whither they have a camel track. The people of t^e interior largely satisfy their own wants Cows goats dates and V/heat are plentiful. They are ex tremely primitive and shy. KhassaVs sea tarde is almost entirely with DiTjai from which place imnorts are drawn of rice sugar coffee piece goods and oil. Firewood and fish are the chief exports. To a much lesser extent Linga and Bandar Ahhas are traded wit with, From information that dhows average only 10 a month it would appear that the scope of trade is. limited. This number is probably increased in summmer when elements of the Dhuhuriyin Bani Marra and Khanazirah descend into Khassab date gardens bringing with them their surplus cows and firewood for sale. The inflated population of Khassab during Summer, referred to by the Political Resident consists I gathered very largely of families of the pearl divers absent on the Bibai and Bahrain banks, -ome three hundred women from such diverse Quarters as the -^ani Yas country and Hen jam as well from Sx.ai ja annually make their summer abode on Khassab beach. The tangled mountain mass of Runs Al Jetal4 j ( loius A1 JelDal impenetralDle for transport animals nust always militate against trade dev elopment. The paucity of wants of the population aGcessilDle 'by Khassah partly negatives X fear her otherv;ise cood claims as a port on nautical grounds. Inform tion would indicate that there is water from mountain reservoirs in comparative abundance over a wide area, the Shaikh mentioned one inland reservoir called Ghushih three days- distant and presumably in Bani l!arra country. Certainly dhows from the Batinah on their way to Dihai put in to Khassah for water which they can get free within a few hundred yards of land ing either at DiMiha or Bir Juwa. KhassaVs harbour is a fasinating place with all the naut ical merits enumerated in the Political Resident* letter. The cost of reclamation of the foreshore however would T think he nrohihitive. I saw a dhovj- anchored presumably in a position vtfiere she • would just float at low water and this seemed cuite half a mile from the shore. The 'beach is a { gently shelving one making the necessary area of reclamation vast. Dredging the creek would ec_uall I think he viewed as an uneconomic measure. If Khassah ever comes to anything I would hazard the opinion that landing facilities will best be found by making a road from the beach along the br base of the western wing of the harbour and run ning off a jetty therefrom. It must however be regarded as unlikely that Ahassab can ever displace Dibai as a trading port. The natural wealth of Dibai and its hinter land is incomparably greater than the potential wealth of Khassab and r.uus A1 Jebal and must ther c ' continue commercially to be a more attrac-5 ^ ^ - tive attractive market. If the E .I. Company ships ceased to call at Dihai I presume some other rival steamship company would eagerly step in. On the other hand as regards Persian Entre pot trade and the coastal trade Khassah is at least as well situated as Diahi and had it 'been a E.I. port of call would prohahly hy now have profited in this limited sense at-Dihai's expense In the absence of any 'big merchants at Khassah and in the light of what may 'be regarded as the cuasi-illicit nature of the Persian trade (it is said chiefly to consist of running the gauntlet of Persian customs with contraband cargoes of tea and sugar) it would appear unlikely that the B.I. Company would regard Khassah as commercially worth while. Had Khassah taken the Eye of the Naval Authorities when they chose Henjam as their 'base, capital may have come in and given rise to conditions whereby Khassah • ■ ould have encroached on Dihai's prosperity. VI Any opinion regarding the possibilities of a hill station in Huus A1 Jebal would be prema ture without first making a visit inland in mid summer accompanied by the Shaikh and armed with an aneroid, a thermometer, and some test tubes 'or water specimens. The population are extra ordinarily Jungly and every caution would have to be exercised, Vilien fishing with I \ T o. 1 of the Crocus in their motor boat a mile or two down the coast from Khassab we encountered a small SHIHUK fishing bo&amp;t. This on sight of us made off for a cave where the fishermen abandoned their craft and scattered like frightened goats up into their hills. I heard too that when one of E .r. ships was carrying out gunnery practise a few months'•i 6 J months 'back in the harhonr there was a general exodus from rhass^lD of scared. Baduins who were on visit . T: e Shaikh of Khassah is said to have a good deal of influence with these wild men and conciliation of the trihes in the neighbourhood ever heco'mes necessary he would 'appear to 'be the I 'best adviser and.medium, T^e hillraen are said to 'be well armed with mausers etc, 'but have little or no ammunition'. The alleged local price of a rupee for two rounds is, if true, illuminating.

The Janabah as a whole plead poverty which only In part true. Cm) During the past six months there have been severe in the town and the murderers murder^without exception have not been brought to the Wall, or any separate settlement made and so a blood feud exists* Tne two Janabah sections involved in tnis feud kokhana and Arama have each built three war towers in tne town six in all during tne past year against the orders of the Wali# (IV) The only pressure tne State is able to apply to the refractory subjects is to Intercept their dhows and hold them up in Muscat # a measure employed in the days of the^Nural Bahr * and before# And in this respect Sur is extremely vulnerable because it lives by its carrying trade and posseses no less tnan a hundred dhows, many of these of large siae and worth 30000 Rpa# To intern four or five of these in port is calculated to bring the Sur people to reason# These crafts are to be met with at Bahrein, Basrah, Karachi and Bombay.

When Muhammad bin xiasir 4 .i could not obtain our allegiance, he moved Al kukhannan ana Al Crhi&amp;lin to make buildings. When we saw the war buildings being raised in the midst of town we also raised our buildings to save ourselves from the harm. Then arrived the Wazir and sent for Muhammad bin iiasir from Jaalan and he arrived after some days. Muhammad bin Jiasir asked us to come to him but he could not succeed. He then entered upon the Wazir and deceived him. He made him to order us and we are obedient to the Government, to destroy our buildings before the other sections. Had he ordered all sections to destroy their buildings , then all should have been pulled down in one time.

The Council of Ministers also stated that as the place was chiefly populated by the Muqabil it would be impossible for Saiyid ftarnad to hold it in opposition to that tribe# They impressed upon him to use his tact and avoid trouble as the present state of finances would not permit of undertaking any expenditure on an expedition# The latoft report from a fresh arrival states that oaiyid ftamad has come to terms with the Muqabil and the situation has become normal® I have the honour to be, Sir # Your most obedient servant^ Major, l] Political Agent and fl.B.M's Consul, Muscat#C ON PIDEITTIAL. ■ rag. .0. c. of 1927.

There have 'been three failures this year in the dealr '•ings of the State with the tribes nominally under it. (1) The opposition of the SHIHUH trite of Cape mussendum to the hydrographic surveyors sent to Jihasab. (2) failure in obtaining the consent of the UAIM and DHOWAHIH tribes to the passage of the Air Porce party through Baraimi. (3) failure of the Minister of Finance to induce the * JEKEBEH at Sur to pull down their forts, and firing by the ARAKA section of the JEKEHEH on the • AL SAEED 'o As regards (1) Mr. Thomas writes in his letter i^o. M/l/195 dated 16th August 1927, M The Muscat State has neglected a HASAB for some ten years and its authority there now is not what it was then. I have definitely not ventured to change that policy because (1) from a revenue point of view r HASAB is a meatless bone: ( We have no custom^ post there ). (2) its remoteness makes it an expensive business to ma ice / 1 i7^ JL. \ * maice frequent visits there; (3) tliere lias been no compelling reason ta change the existing order of things. .but it would seem that the State policy of self -effacement ratne than assertion has encouraged the independent and obstructive attitude shown to the Political Residents surveyors. 4 # in the Administration Report for the Trucial Coast for 1921iserious fighting was reported betv/een the Sheiich of RAs El j&amp;BAIMAH and SHIHUH tribes. As it seemed certain that the pearl- —ing industry would be adversely affected by divers being divert- -ed, H.M.S. ' Cyclamen ' proceeded there and succeeded in settling the dispute v/lth the assistance of Saiyid Nadir ( brother oi the Sultan ). It appears that Saiyid fladir had proceeded to KHASAB to settle disputes betv/een the two sections of the SHIHUh. &gt; ±s AN I HAD I YAH and AL KAIvIAZERAH. 5. muscat diary for the week ending 14th August 1921 reports Saiyid Uadir 1 s return to Muscat with the headmen of both parties. The diary ending 28th September reports the imprisonment ( o£ all the Sheikhs by the Miscat Government^whilst the diary ending the 12th uctober reports their release. It appears they % were released after signing a settlement paper by which the AL il ALIAZER a H had to pay Rs 600/- to the BAKI HADI^AH. The diary ending 10th November reports M The local government have informed the SHIHUH Sheiidis that they will have to pay in future Customs Duty at 4 ^ on fish, 3 % on other goods. They have farmed the Customs for the current year for Rs 1600/-. Muscat diary for the period ending 3ist nay 1925 reports the arrival of four AX KAMAZERAH Sheikhs in xiuscat. It appears this was in connection with the previous settlement. The diary reports that the J3A1TI HADIYAH leaders had been sent for, but they have refused to come to Muscat since 1921 although called by the Muscat {government several times. 7 # in a D.0. No. M/3- dated 16th April 1926 Mr. Thomas writes ' The Sheikh of miASAB ( Paramount Sheikh of the iSAKI HADIYAH ) is said to have a g«od deal of influence with these wild men, and if conciliation of the tribes in the neighbourhood ever jever 'beconies necessary, lie v /ouid appear to 'be the Dest adviser and medium. ' 3 # Latest reports from the V/ali to the Council of liinistera are to the effect that the Sheildi does not allow the Za^at [ land tax ) to 'be collected and has appropriated a boat belonging to some Ualuchis which was wrecked and floated to ilmaoaB . g # regards (2), Lluscat Hews Diary Ho. 12 of 1325 ^o^ the perisd 16th to 30th June 1925 statest- ' The rumour that ihn Saud , s oixicials have recently visited Baraimi and collected Zakat v/'as coniirmed by nev/s from SOK/iH. The tov/n of Uaraimi with its adjacent villages of riAUASAH etc. formerly belonged to the Sultanate oi uuscat Lind was under SOHAB. but became independent or semi -independent in the reign of Saiyid Faisal. The Sheikh was then ZAID BIN KHALIPAH AIT ITAIIII who himself and latterly his son and successor hAin)AL BlA r ZAID used to visit the Sultan ( Saiyid Faisal ) regularly once or twice a year, and paid homage and rece ived rewards _li_*e tne ,rest_ of the Omani Sheikhs. ,—— The present Sultan ( Saiyid Taimur j neglectea to carry on the ,&gt;0Id relations etc. The lirst neglect on ii.io pwi.rt being that Saiyid* Faisal^ death was not reported nor niu o^n succession to the Sultanate and that this displeased the I4AII.II Sheikhs and estranged them. X2, The present Shei±ch Sultan bin Zaid has for che last fev/ years bien sending and receiving presents to and from Ibn Saud whom he has now apparently invited to take possession or make a sort of protectorate of Baraimi. .Last year Bin JTLIT I, (iovernor of EL HAGSA ( for ibn Saud ) is said to have collected Zakat from the neighbouring tribe of YAL BIT SHAKIS near Baraimi and this time Baraimi itself has surrendered and paid taxes, the Sheikh being left to rule as heretofore. 13^ sohar on the coast of the interior of uman being easily accessible through Baraimi, this event is probably dangerous to the Sultan's Government who however do not appear toto think much alDout it or show any signs of alarIIi ,, ftr of being forewarned.' 14. As regards (3), the same tendency on the part of the Liu scat authorities to alienate the tribal Sheikhs may be traced in the files, regarding Sur, though the matter is somev/hat more complicated. 15^ The town of Sur consists of two large quarters separat ed by a creek. That on the eastern side is occupied by the ±JA^I BU ALI tribe whilst that on the west is occupied by the JEHSBEH. According to iiOrimer's (iazetteer vol. il page 1849, there is a perpetual feud between the ±JAKI BU ALI and the JCE1TEBEH. 16. The JE^IEBEH at Sur are divided into four sections ARAKAH, FUWARIS^ GHIALIN, and MUKHANI. The first two are combined against the other two. 17. As regards the BANT BU ALI tribe; although they gave some trouble in former years and there was an expedition against them in 182Jiunder Sir Lionel Smith,in conjunction with the Sultan, they had of latter year^been loyal to the Sultan and took his part in the late rebellion. 18. in his Memorandum no, 1014 dated nay 1920, nr. iSTingate writes, ' The allowance paid to these Sheikhs and to two t . other Sheiidis of the BA1TI BU ALI resident in Sur by the Sultans government had been cut by the Wazir during my absence owing to a combination of ignorance and misdirected economy. This i had recti- -fied on my return over a month ago and my visit has, i hope, set their quite justifiable misgivings at rest . M 19. m spite of this,financial economies, introduced by the Financial Adviser in his budget for 1923 included the reduction of the subsidy paid to the JMISBEH Sheikhs by Rs 60/- per mensem. A reduction which still holds good. 20. Since then the Amirs of the BAMI BU ALI, Ali bin Abdullah and Mohomed bin Nasir, have been attempting to assert / their independence and their authority over the other tribes of JAALAN, and sent a petition to Government to this effect. ( vide Jj'lireign5 © Foreign No. 2481/719/EXT datedJ27tli February 1923 ). 21. xn his letter r&lt;o. 1436 dated 4/6 ucto'ber 1924 Major ninde reports ; ,, 1 invited Moiiomed 'bin ITaser to explain the local situation and he 'became very verbose and excited, ne said he was authorised 'by the Muscat uoverninent to settle all disputes in Sur and had succeeded in doing bo with the exception ©f KHAmIS . bin MUBARAK ( ARAokA section ). j who was an unruly creature and was out to ruin the whole settlement. ' etc. 22. ' i then refer^red to a complaint x had had from the nindu merchants regarding the closing of the inland route from Sur. The Sheiida said the read had been closed for political reasons in order to punish the lilJRiilN who lived on it. H 23. in Muscat Diary JNo. 23 of 1924 for the period ending 30th .November 1924 reference is made to an attempt on the part of ' the Amirs of the ±;AKI BU ALI to foist a Sheikh on the JMIBBEH at Sur. This action seems to have bjeen resented ^y the JEKSBEH and to have failed. \ ayt' 24. As regards the J1£NEBEH, Colonel Miles in his book stat H It must be noted however that there are a few Sheikhs in uman known as 'UtiMKEMBHS who possess real power over their people and wield it despotically. The tribes who are thus governed are, ---- the JEKEBEH. ,, Besides the four sections of the jEUEBSH mentioned above as resident in Sur, there is a fifth section AL LSAJAAIA living at ADAM, MANA, and 122 in Oman. The TEMEEMBH of the JEKEBlilH is selected from the AL MAJAALA. Mansur bin jsaser of uASlRAn ( ./hose death from small-pox occurred last August whilst he was returning from a pilgrimage to Mecca ) was selcted Sheikh of the JEKEBEH about two years ago but about half the JE!^SJ3EH ( ARAMA and JfUwAIRIS ) viere displeased with him, as Sheikh Mansur a bin leaser was close supporter of the Ami th of the A ±JANI BU ALI, Mchomed bin uaser and Ali bin Abdullah. 25. in Muscat Diary no, 14 of 1^25 for the period from 16th to 31st July 1925 it states; ' Reports which have not yet been confirmed have reached muscat to the effect that Sheikh rnansur bin J^aser ( JEKEBEH ) came to Sur and tried to form a sort6 v @ sort of committee of certain leading men there for the administra- -tion of justice as the local Wali has been iound incapable uo man maintain authority and order in the country* it is said that tne Wali apprehended danger and incited some of the aAKMAIT and mOKHAKNAH tribes to interfere, xoth sides f«ught with the result •ne of the iiAiQiaAN was killed and one mounded* 26» The Hindu community of Sur petitioned the folitical Agent in connection with above requesting the protection Ox i.neir property and life* They stated that Shei-ech Liansur had giveii them to understand that there was no Sultanas G-overnment in iSur and they were to look to him for justice etc. and that they should not go to the V/ali. He warned them that if they did they would endanger themselves#. The Wali also v /rote and ini or^ied them that he was powerless, and that they should inform their Gevernmen v/ ( British ) . It appears that the Wali himself is responsible for all this trouble as by doing this he hopes to strengthen hib case for increase of pay and get more Arab levies. H 27. xn their letter to me after the recent trouble dated 25th September 1927 the ARAMA section of the JiUNEBEJl state; M ** This jciohomed bin J^aser A1 Hamudah ^ —AI.I BU ALI ] wishes to ente.' Sur and t© subject the residents to his orders and against the -mitted to him and were under his orders, against the Sultan of Muscat. .But we AL ARAMA and AL FtTWAIRIS opposed him. ne asked us to be under his orders but we did not accept and made our obedience to the Sultan of Muscat. Then Mohomed bin XJaser could not obtain our allegiance, he moved A -L I'iUiuiAMHAll and All G-HIALil^ to make forts . '.vhen we saw the forts being raised in our midst we also raised our forts to save ourselves from harm. 28* Then arrived the Wazir and sent for j^ohomed bin jMaser and he arrived after a few days. Mohomed bin Naser asked us to com to him but he could not succeed, ne then entered upon the Wazir and deceived him. ne made him to order us to destroy our forts before the other sections.' 29» After the death of iiansur bin uaser, and. even a few Sultan of nuscat. The sections A-L Mukhannah months33 //« © months before ills death^when he left for necca, SAjSED Bill SULTAIi BIIv KHAMIS A -L MAJAAl^i { one of the Sheiichs v /hose subsidy was reduced vide paragraph above ) had been selected as the Sheiich of the ne lives at ADAK and visits 3ur uccasionally. it is stated that all sections are now agreed upon the Sheikhship. 30» In my letter no, C--84 dated 31st uctober 1927 i have reported that baiyid laohomed bin Ahmed, rresident of the Council of Ministers recently received a letter from Sheiidi baeed bin Sultan bin £hamis A1 MAJAALA, Chief Sheikh of the JiilJNEUEji at aur to arrange an armistice between the two rival factions, AL AHA11A and AL MUKKANNAH and that after arranging that he would bring the AKAJ^A leaders to pay their homage to the Council of ministers at muscat. 31» It &lt;yould seem that Sheikh 3aeed was the proper person to deal with when treating with the ARAMA section and not Liohomed bin liaser of the ±}ANI BU ALI who was at enmity with the ARAKA and possibly playing for his ov/n interests, and the assertion of his authority over the other tribes in JAALA1T. 32. A glance at the annual administration reports for the last few years will show that there has been constant friction between the Muscat State authorities and the tribes with which they have to deal, 'iiie Annual Report for 1925 states; H Saiyid Hamad bin Faisal, the Sultan^ half-brother who is ^ali of Sohar is most unpopular with the neighbouring tribes owing to exactions. The tribe mostly concerned is BANI KAAB. (Note: this was the tribe with whose assistance Mr. Thomas and the Air Force larty were able to proceed from Sohar to Shargah.) A powerful tribe, and rebellion is openly discussed, nis Highness is aware of this feeling but hesitates to take any action against hi brother. M Diary ITo. 10 of 1924 for the period ending 4th ray, 1924 reports a complaint by Ahalaf bin Sinan of the isANl ALI (DhAHIKSE) * against oppression of his people by Saiyid namad at aohar while tney were there. jbately also he has had trouble with the m UQUABIL tribe.'KV 1 ■ t v I- '1 i 33. x n 1920 the lAL SAAD tribe, the largest tribe in uman, living on the iiatineh coast attacked aiASKAA as a protest against the erection of a customs post there. ( Diary .No. 5 dated 10th February 1920 ). . In his -No. Bu 1 dated 26th August 1922 Major Hae reported the prevention of the erection of custom houses by XAL SAAB at and KKADRA and the increase of slave dealings from the i.eicran coast. The Muscat (i-overnment declared their inability to deal with the situation and naval action was taken by Cfovernment. , it is interesting to note that Sheiich isa tin Salih wrote a letter to the i-olitical Agent offering to intervene in this trouble. 24 * &gt; -LJiary iNo. 16 of 1925 for the period from 16th to 31st August 1925 reports a disturhanoe at SUWAiq, between the Wali and the YAL SAXD tribe. The Wali had burnt a dhow and killed two cov.s belonging to the sheikh of YAi S.'AD, and sent t.vo slaves to set hie house on fire, ihe outcome of this trouble was that the Wali was dismissed. 1 ,iC&gt;u - LC - alee refer you to the activities of Sheikh ISO, Din oalih and the imam's Uovernment in 1925 as throwing some 1 light on the general attitude of the tribes. The Egyptian newsplper ASH SHOHA to which Sheikh Sulaiman A1 Baruni, the Tripoli to. agitator and now Sheikh Isa&lt;6 lieutenant, is a correspondent, stated on 29th October 1925 that a pact had been entered into between the Imam', uovernment and tbe Bheixhs of Dubai and *bu.Dhabi on the I'rucial coast strengthening the cord of union and laying down case any body attacked the country land side. 36 - in ^tober 1925 Sheilch xsa bin Salih collected his ftrees and marched into AL DHAKIHEH ostensibly for the purpose ol settling some disputed there but actually to consolidate his position there. the course of Joint action in either from the sea side or tie In40. lv&gt; ® In September 1925 The Uairc Daily ASH SHCHA published the following; * The imam is preparing to proceed to DHAEIKEH and ±5araimi to put in order tte forts and make it a centre of military strength for that part so that if any thing happens from the sea side or the land side, organized forces, rations and ammunition^ be despatched there. The werld will no doubt hear that nis nighness the buitan Taimur will do what is necessary in the interests of the country and will a_prove of the action of the imam. &gt; ' i 37. Sheilch isa bin Salih proceeded to ibri ostensibly t» settle the m U ^AZARAH question. The AL MJI na ZARAH ( HXKAWI tribe ) had been turned out of xbri by Sheikh of the Al ^UAQUB for having murdered his brother the former Sheiidu 38 # In his report l^o. 96 dated 29th December 1925 Colonel Crosthwaite states ; M before isa bin Salih marched to ibri he called upon Sulaiman bin namyar, a powerful G-haf iri Sheikh of JABAL AKHDi\R ( BEN I RlYAl r ) to accompany him in order to bring pressure on the Ibri Sheikh to hand over that tovn to him. Sulaiman biHhamyar consented to persuade his fellow lihafiri Sheikhs to hand over ibri on condition that the town be handed back after four days occupation. The tov.n the fort at DIK were accordingly handed over. After the fixed period xsa bin Salih made no sign of returning the fort to the Sheikh of Ibri and the latter upbraided Sulaiman bin namyar for failing to make isa bin Salih keep his promise. Sulaiman bin namyar then went to Isa bin balih and demanded that he should keep his word. A dispute arose between isa bin Salih and Sulaiman bin namyar and the latter left the former and took away his fighting men with him. 39. The defection from Isa bin Salih's fighting forces gave courage to the remaining Ghafiri tribesmen to resist ar,H Isa bin Salih found himself so weak that he evacuted Ibri and all the other places that had surrendered to him and has gen e back to his home at kABII ^10 @ 40» In his letter jno . 83 dated 30th November 1925 Colonel Crosthwaite states; t M The DHAJIIKEH tract has always maintained more or less friendly and qasi-subject relations v /ith the muscat State, though at no even comparatively recent time has the ruler of muscat raised any taxes from its inhabitants. When xsa 'bin Salih led the rebellion of the tribes in Oman proper in 1913 the DKaHI - BEH inhabitants do not appear to have joined him in any great numbers. '^6 reason why local •pinion is now exercised by isa bin Salih 1 s move into DHaHIHEH is that certain of the tribes of that tract lie astride the range of hills separating DhAHlREH from the ±iatineh districts of uman^ Should he bring such tribes under his power in the DHAHIKEH he may be able to exercise an influence contrary to the interests of the iluscat State in the Batineh. The general impression, however, is that xsa bin Salih as a H lie A V,'I YAH will not be able to win over the (ihafiriyah tract the of^rPIAHIREfi 2 would point out that history has already shown isa bin Salih capable of surmounting sjich difficulties, juajor naworth in his letter jmo . 91-C dated 9th j^iay 1917 states:- H Isa did not openly join^ the rebellion immediktely. It was joined by namiyar bin leaser el x^ebhani, Temeemeh of TA m UP and chief oheiih of the Kiyami tribe of (ihafiris. JUS oALnl!! went about raising the tribes and (iiLiiUitiS and niKAV/lS alike declared their allegiance but the main body the latter faction only came in when isa bin Salih openly attached himself to the movement. Jf'rom previous history aJfid subsequent direction of the rebellion, there is little doubt that Isa was, and had been, the hidden power behind the scenes from the commencement and the Sultan confirmed this as being c©Jrrect» ne was, however, clever enough to see where previous revolutions had failed and to perceive the wisdom of bringing in the GEAPIHIS first in order to make the movement a universal one in Cfman.* 1 .* 43.

This family first came to notice in 1841 when Saiyid Hamud of Sohar placed some Muttawas or religious zealots - among them Said hin lOaalfan A1 Khalili — in charge ci his principal forts to hold them against the «Vahabis u Iiiiuocii adopted a religious profession and way of life.

I~&gt;n this connection, it is interesting to note that in 1913, Saiyid imdir, ( brother of nis nighness ) pledged Semail fort to Abdullah bin Said A1 Ahalili ( father of present Imam ) whilst he went to Sib.j 44^ Concerning the KlYABn tribe, mentioned above, the principal CxHAFIRI tribe to support the rebellion, Mr. Lorimer states H There are no bedouins... Those of the hills do not bear^T good reputation being regarded as irascible, slothful, immoral and wanting in hospitality. The prejudice against them may be partly due to their disregard of j&amp;ahomedan princip^Cles in drinking a wine which they themselves manufacture from home grown grapes.' 45» Sheikh isa bin Salih*a diplomacy in bringing about an alliance between the wine drinkingj^iyami and the fanatically religious Muttawas is certainly worthy of admiration and under present conditions it seems only a question of time before he succeeds in bringing the DHAEIKEH within his sphere of influence '—j— 46» xar. Dowson, who visited the Semail valley last June, v/rote in his report:- H He ( A1 Baruni, mentioned above ) was most interest ed in the whereabouts of the Minister of finance and the R.A.F officers and their widely advertised attempt to get to the ±5araimi uasis and rumour has it that it is A1 Baruni himself who has kept them out of the place.' 1 47. waving regard to the method employed with success by 13artc isa 'bin SaliiL during^ late rebellion, of instigating the GhAPnii tribes to rebel against the Sultan and then stepping in and obtaining the uverlordship, it would seem that the same * tactics have been empl&amp;yed by Sheikh Xsa in instigating the Baraiini tribes , who were in opposition to him, to show \ opposition to the Air Force irarty. 48» There is also a suspicion that isiohomed bin leaser of the BU All may have employed similar tactics to create friction betv/een the ARA11A section of the JEKEEEH with whom he was at enmity, and Mr. Thomas. 49^ In paragraph 8 above&gt; mention is made that the bultan present aheiim afaitiir bin Zaid, ef tne jNAUki, has for trie last fev/ years, been sending and receiving presents to and from liiw Aaud, v/hen ne nas now apparently invited to taKe possession and ma±:e a sort of protectorate of ^araimi. 50. xnere are two important tribes m j ^aralml, the jnAIxl and the DnOWAtiiR.

It is possible tnat overtures to Ibn Saud by the iiAIM may have been for tne purpose of replacing tne support of the muscat btate which no longer nas any value, it is more probable that it was sought for the purpose of counteracting the activities of isa bin aalih and their absorption witnin nis spnere of influence. 52» ±n this connection, ± would draw your attention to the fact tnat oheiiai mansur bin naser, of tne , mentioned above, and namdan bin iMaser and balem bin leaser, brothers of Mohomed bin Uaser mentioned above, of the isAKl BU Al&lt;i, { a tribe wmcn is wahabi ) stayed at j&amp;ecca for tnree montns tnis year and tne party were tne guests of n.M.

I.—Administration. J. His Highness Saiyid Taimur bin Faisal bin Turki, K.O.I.E. (1926), C.S.I. (1917), Sultan of Muscat and Oman, born in 1885, succeeded his lather, Sultan Saiyid Faisal-bin-Turki, G.C.I.E., who had ruled the Sultanate since 1888, in 19lo. He has three sons, of whom the eldest, Saiyid Said, is being educated at an Arab school in Baghdad. His Highness, who is entitled to a salute of 21 guns, represented his father at the Delhi Durbar, 1902—3, and visited England in the summer of 1928, when he was received in audience by the King, and entertained as a State guest for a period of a month. 2. The Sultan is an independent potentate who has commercial treaties with the Governments of France (1841) and the United States (1833), as well as with flis Majesty's Government. There is in addition a commercial declaration ol 1877 with the Dutch Government. Under the Anglo-French declaration of 1862, His Majesty's Government and the French Government engage reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan of Muscat (as oi the Sultan of Zanzibar). Under his treaty relations with His Majesty's Government, a precis of which is contained in the memorandum printed as Appendix on page the Sultan is pledged never to cede, sell, mortgage, or otherwise give for occupation, his dominions, save to His Majesty s Government, to whom, in addition, the right to search and seize Muscat ships suspected of carrying slaves was ceded in 1373, as was the right (simultaneously ceded to Persia) to search Muscat vessels tor arms in Muscat waters in 1898. The right to search Muscat vessels for arms on the high seas was ceded to His Majesty's Government and the Italian Government in 1903. While, however, the Sultan is in theory a wholly independent ruler, since the end of the eighteenth century British influence has been predominant in Muscat, afid in practice the relations which obtain between its ruler and His Majesty's Government and the Covernment of India very closely approximate to those which obtain between the Government of India and an Indian State under the suzerainty of His Majesty. 3. The internal administration of Muscat is carried out by an Advisory Council of Ministers (President, Minister of Finance, Minister of Religious Affairs, Minister of Justice),'^ purely Arab with the exception noted below, • p. 937/24. presided over by His Highness's brother, Saiyid Nadir.t The, Council, t Letter 163 s. from which the Sultan was required to institute in 1920 as a condition of the Pol. Res. to o. of 1., assistance of His Majesty's Government in the reconstruction of his adminis- tration and in negotiations with the rebel Omani tribes (see para. 35), is entitled to a salute of 17 guns, individual members receiving five and the p h. 321 /22. President nine, or 13 if a member of the ruling House. In theory it exercises all ordinary powers of administration, not only during the absence, but during the presence of the Sultan at Muscat, subject to the retention by His Highness of power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty4 It does not, however, x g. of 1. Desp. to appear in the past to have exercised in practice a very effective control. At M a 0 r f a'/mi' the request of the Sultan, an Englishman, Mr. B. S. Thomas, O.B.E., p. 1969 /21. ' formerly assistant British representative in Trans-Jordan,§ was appointed in § Letter 41 8 s. from 1925 as Financial Adviser. In 1926 Mr. Thomas was appointed Wazir and j^^ u ' of a member of the Muscat Council, functioning as Finance Minister, but ' 11 ' ' 0 having also a full share in the government of the State. The result has been a marked improvement in the general level of efficiency of administration. 4. His Majesty's Government and the Government of India are represented in Muscat by the Political Agent, who is an officer of the Indian Political Department, on the cadre of which the appointment is borne. The 3064 15 8.28post, which is at present held by Major G. P. Murphy, Indian Army, has * Lor. i, 472. been maintained without interruption since its revival'''' after the separation of Muscat from Zanzibar in 186]. In 1869 it was placed in strict t Lor. i, 488 -9. subordination to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.t Since 1867 the Political Agent has also held His Majesty's Commission as Consul lor Muscat. Under the Muscat Order in Council of 1015 (see paras. 6J-4 below), which replaced the Muscat Order in Council of 1867, the Political Agent is the District Magistrate and Sessions Judge, and exercises his powers subject to the jurisdiction of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. The limits of the Order are co-extensive with the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 5. Xo specific reference was made to Muscat in the Report of the Masterton-Smith Committee, and while, under the general principle embodied in that Committee, matters of political significance on the north Arabian littoral which may affect relations with Ibu Sand fall to be dealt with by or in consultation with the Colonial Office, such matters rarely, if at all, arise in Muscat, and political control may in consequence be regarded as resting, as in the pre-war period, with the Government of India, subject to tho general control of His Majesty's Government. Under the principles embodied in the Masterton-Smith Report, the internal affairs of the State are in any event the direct concern of the Government of India. 6. With the inconsiderable exception referred to below, expenditure in Muscat is wholly borne by Indian revenues. That expenditure consists of subsidies to the Sultan, of Durbar presents, and of the cost of maintaining the Political Agenc} 7 . The subsidies consist of an annual sum of Rs. 86,400, representing the $40,000 payable by Zanzibar to Muscat under the Canning award of 1861 (liability for this payment was assumed by His Majesty's Government in 1871, and has since 1st September 1883 been wholly an j Lor. i, 499 -500, Indian charge),J and of the annual subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh paid since 1912 (see paras. 12\nd 22 below) in compensation for the losses to the Sultan arising out of the suppression of the arms traffic, which will cease with the tenure of power by the present Sultan. These charges are fixed, and their amount does not vary. In the latest year for which authoritative figures are available (1919-20), the cost of the Political Agency was Rs. 78,427, and in § sir d . Bray to the same year Durbar presents amounted to Rs. 5,000.§ The solitary item n5(i^A ly juiy () 2i expenditure shared with His Majesty's Government is a yearly payment i92ii P. 3588 /21. in respect of anti-slavery measures, the amount of which in 1926 was Ks. 73. II.—1908 to 4th October 1913 : Sultan Faisal. 6. The dominating feature of the period between 1908 and 1913 is the successful suppression, in agreement with the Sultan of Muscat, of the arms traffic from his State, and no other question of sufficiently general interest to call for reference in this Memorandum arose in the closing years of the reign of Sultan Faisal. The rebellion of the Omani tribes, which broke out some months before his death on 4th October 1913, belongs principally to the reign of his successor. It is dealt with in a separate section in paras. 43 to 52 below. The Suppression of the Arms Traffic from Muscat. 7. At the beginning of the period a general prohibition of the arms traffic was in force on the Persian Gulf littoral save in Muscat. The Sultan of Muscat had prohibited in 1891 the import or export of arms and ammunition to or from Gwadur, his dependency on the Persian littoral of the Gulf. In 1898 His Highness had agreed to prohibit the export of arms from Muscat to India and Persia (where the import of arms was illegal), and had empowered Persia and Great Britain to act on his behalf bv sea in enforcing this prohibition within Muscat territorial waters. In 1903 he had further agreed to the search by British and Italian ships of Muscat vessels on the high seas suspected of carrying arms. But the import of arms into Muscat, and their export, except to India and Persia, were still unprohibited in 1908. *1.0. Mcrao. 182, 196. B. 175, 8. I lie result was to make Muscat the recognised centre of the trade in arms for the whole Middle East. At the beginning of the period now in question, the main channel of distribution was from Muscat across the Gulf to the coast of Persian Makran, whence arms were taken up country by caravans, ultimately reaching the tribesmen of Afghanistan and the North- West frontier o! India. From 1910—11, the stringency of the prohibitive measures imposed by His Majesty's Government led to the adoption, in preference, of smuggling to El Katr. on the Arabian coast, then still under Turkish control, and thence across the Gulf to the Persian coast of Earistan. 9. The constant flow of modern arms of precision from Muscat to the North-West Frontier of India created a very serious situation for the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. The situation was one which could be dealt with adequately only by the suppression of the free trade in arms at Muscat. The fact that the Sultan had commercial treaties not only with His Majesty's Government, but with the United States oi America and I ranee, which expressly provided for the unrestricted import and export ol all kinds ol merchandise (with certain specified exceptions); that he had further a commercial declaration which provided for reciprocal most-favoured-nation treatment between Muscat and Holland ; that a large part of the trade in arms was in the hands of certain French firms with considerable political influence in the Chamber ; and that the French Government, unlike the Governments of the United States of America and Holland, was not prepared to sacrifice its treaty rights provided other Treaty Powers did the same, made it extremely difficult to take effective steps to this end. 10. The efforts made by His Majesty's Government to provide a quid pro quo acceptable to the French Government having failed, steps \vere taken, in the light of a reiteration at the Brussels Arms Conference of 1908-9 of the refusal of France to modify her attitude, to suppress the traffic so far as was practicable without the violation of existing treaty rights. Towards the end of 1909 a naval blockade was instituted, which was still in being on the outbreak of the War in 1914, but which, though it met with very considerable success, proved extremely costly. Between 1910 and 1912 further lengthy negotiations took place in consequence with the French Government and with the Sultan. The Sultan, who saw in the suppression ol the traffic not merely a possible occasion of immediate compensation from His Majesty's Government, but the closing of the most convenient source from which the rebellious tribes in the interior of Oman could arm themselves against him, was generally amenable, though in 1911-12 his financial difficulties, wdiich delivered him into the hands of the arms dealers, 0 led h 1111 * Cp. tel. from for a time to change from an attitude of neutrality towards the trade, to active, u'lVn if surreptitious, participation in it. The French Government, however, p. ni, p. 200. remained unyielding, and in view of the complete failure of the negotiations with them, it was decided to disregard France, and to endeavour to concei t with the Sultan of Muscat some local arrangements for a satisfactory control of the trade.! t I.O. to F.O, July 19 1911. 11. It is unnecessary to recapitulate the various incidents which took place in connection with the suppression of the traffic between 1910 and 1912, or to enter into details of the discussions which took place during that period with the Sultan and with France. Suffice it to say that, after lengthy negotiation, an arrangement was finally reached with His Highness in May 1912. Under this the Sultan agreed to establish at Muscat a bonded warehouse under sufficient control, in which all arms and ammunition would be deposited on importation, the warehouse to be in charge of a trustworthy person from among his subjects. All issues from the warehouse would be regulated by special licences prepared by the Superintendent and counter signed by the Sultan personally, and such licences would be issued only to individual purchasers or their authorised agents subject to satisfactory proof that the issue involved was ' free from justifiable objection.' Licences would not be issuable to traders. 12. The terms on which the Sultan agreed to this settlement were as follows. He w r as to receive as compensation an immediate lump sum4 payment oi' 1 lakh of rupees, together witii 1 lal&lt;h of rupees per annum in the future, paid monthly in advance. In addition he was to receive compensation for certain specific losses in 1009 and 1911. The Sultan was further guaranteed that His Majesty's Government would give him all the necessary support to dispose of objections that might ensue from France or other Powers ; that no right was given by the arrangement to His Majesty s Government or their officials to take action in his territories any more than in the past; and that a friendly understanding should be reached with him by His Majesty's Government as to suitable arrangements for the supply of the hond fide needs of his administration and his subjects. K&gt;. The arrangement, which was to come into force, after three months' notice, on the Jst September 1912, was published on the 4th June lOl-, came into operation on the appointed date, and was subsequently maintained with complete success. 14. Very serious difficulty immediately arose with the French Government, which expressed its readiness to approve the regulations only subject to the compensation of the French merchants, who had hitherto played a consider able part in the arms trade. Compensation to French interests would have meant compensation to the other interests—Muscat, British, German, Belgian—affected, and the' objections to it from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government were overwhelming. The fact that England, while a joint guarantor with France of Muscat independence under the Agreement with France of 1862, was not a party to the French Treaty of 1844 with Muscat, under which the arms trade was permissible, further complicated the issue. 15. His Majesty's Government, however, made it clear to the French Government on the 14th September 1912, that they were firmly determined to support the Sultan in maintaining the regulations, which, they stated, in their view did not infringe French treaty rights, but merely regulated a dangerous trade, a right enjoyed by every Government. They added that, while compensation without arbitration could not be admitted, as His Majesty's Government did not recognise that French rights were infringed, they were prepared to submit the question to arbitration. 1G. After lengthy and difficult negotiations, which lasted until the early *p. 35'38/i3. part of 1914, the French Government agreed 0 to recognise the regulations in iorce at Muscat, and the right of the Sultan to amend those regulations with the concurrence of His Majesty's Government, if His Majesty's Government, in direct negotiation with the French trade interests affected, could arrive at an agreement as to the terms on which those interests should t p.5i79/i3. be bought out. An agreement having been reached,! under which £64,495 was paid by His Majesty's Government to the interested firms, an exchange of notes took place on 4th February ]914, by the settlement embodied in which the French Government undertook 'no longer to claim for their nationals the privileges and immunities secured under the Treaty between France and Muscat of 1844, in so far as those privileges and immunities conflict with the regulations for the prevention of the illicit trade in arms and ammunition in the Sultanate. In other respects the Treaty of 1844 remains in force,' The expenditure involved was divided equally between + f.o. toi.o., Indian and Imperial revenues.^ It was decided that no compensation Iv 5103. 1 ' 1 should be paid to British firms affected. 17. While a continual vigilance is called for, the steps taken to put § Report of Arms a sto P to tlle arms traffic fro ™ Muscat, as described above, have been Traffic Committee, completely successful. In 1921,§ and again in 1925,11 the Political Resident 1921, I'. 1036/21. was a | J ] e to report that, save for the Batineh coast, on which a truculent s.'for l. 1 264?May i Omani tribe (the Yal Saad) are not under the Sultan's effective control 1925, p.'1345/28. (c/. para. 52), Muscat had entirely fallen out of the arms traffic ; and the fact that under the post-war Arms Traffic Convention, to which the Sultan has IL'Vwo'' adhered at the request of His Majesty's Government,^ Arabia is a p.8997. ' prohibited area for the import or export of arms, has disposed of the probability of the recurrence in present circumstances of international difficulties.5 III. Internal History of Muscat from Accession of Sultan Taimur, 4th October 1913 to 1928. 18. Sultan beisal died on 4tli October 1913.His sod , Saijid Taimur, * p . ^ne/is. had m piactice, it not formally, lor some yeans previously been recognised as lieii apparent,] and while His Majesty's Government had in the past in t Tel.from Viceroy Muscat postponed recognition ol a successor until they were satisfied that a to s - of S-fo-1., pai ticular claimant was assured ol tne general support of the more important ^ elements and could be regarded as the dc facto ruler, the demise of the late oultan at a time wlien the interior was in a state of revolt, the urgent necessity of establishing a fresh administrative centre, and the fact 'that baivid Laimur \\ r as lamiliar with the policy of his predecessor, and could probably be relied upon to follow that policy in the vital matter of the arms traffic, decided them in Javour of his immediate recognition. J This i f.o . to i.o., the Political Agent was authorised to convey to the Saiyid in November 1913. .1 he 1* rench Government, w r ho had suggested that the two Governments rcconnaissent en, meme temps the new ruler,§ were informed that while § m . Cambon to His Majesty's Government, as they had already indicated, adhered to the Declaration of 1862, it was their usual practice to recognise the de facto ruler, and that they had accordingly already authorised the Government of India to take this step in the case of Sultan Taimur, especially as they understood that the French Consul at Muscat only awaited the receipt of instructions by his British colleague himself to accord official recognition on f.o . t&lt;#i.o.. Nov. 20 behalf of France. p. *739. 19. But the recognition had not been unconditional. The new Sultan had been required as a prior condition to state that he accepted all the obligations which his father bore towards His Majesty's Government, and that in regard to the arms traffic as well as other matters he intended to pursue his father's policy, and undertook ' to be guided by our advice in all important matters. j{ And, immediate recognition having been granted II Tel. from viceroy, by His Majesty's Government on compliance by the Saiyid with these p.li^ 1!n3 ' preliminary demands, further requirements were presented to him as a condition of the continuance of the subsidies granted to his predecessor. 20. Of these subsidies the Zanzibar subsidy was one the precise conditions antecedent to the grant of which are a matter of some dispute.^ ^ cr. Lor i, p. son, It would, however, appear that those conditions are that a Sultan should be footnote, acknowledged by His Majesty's Government and should promise friendship and the maintenance of his treaty obligations, and that subject to this he might prefer an absolute claim. The arms traffic subsidy of Rs. 1 lakh per annum had, however, been personal to Sultan Feisal, and, while it was essential that the new ruler should afford the co-operation in the suppression of the trade to secure which it had been granted, he could prefer no claim to it as of right. 21. After lengthy discussion between the Government of India, the India Office and the Foreign Office, it was finally decided that the Sultan should be required as a condition of the regrant of the subsidies to agree to postpone for live years, or such shorter period as His Majestv's Government might desire, die revision of the Commercial Treaty of 1M*..) 1 ::0 ; a decision being deferred pending further examination on two connected questions—the assent of His ner'si'lol^'tei to Highness to the establishment of a Muscat Levy Corps, and his agreement Viceroy, Jan.'17 to conclude no further treaties with foreign Powers without the consent of I'lo/iT' 5152/13 ' His Majesty's Government. The second of these questions was one which had arisen towards the close of the reign of Sultan Feisidtt, the disposal of tt 1.0. to f . o., which presented political difficulties owing to the position of France vis-d-vis to\ V () the State, and which was still under examination when the outbreak of the p -5152. European War in August 1911 made its immediate pursuit unnecessary.ti f.o . to 1.0., It has not been revived. For various reasons the proposal to raise a Muscat u**' Levy Corps (to which the Foreign Office saw no political objection in 1914g§ &lt; • F() 0 )r) 10 so long as the force was nominally a Muscat force and commanded by officers Jan- ^ 1914, nominally in the service of the Sultan) produced no result until 1921 (see 1&gt; ' 301 u ' para. 31). 22. The arms traffic subsidy was renewed without a very clear definition of the terms of its renewal, though the intention both of His Majesty's6 Government and the Government of India had been that, as in the case of Res'^May^l ® u ^ an Feisal, it should be personal to the ruler. ii: ' The complete success of p. 4iso/2i. the restrictions imposed on the arms traffic, the extension to Arabia of the Arms rraffic Convention of 1910, and the financial stringency of the post war period, led at a later stage to re-examination of the position in regard to this subsidy, and as a result the Sultan was warned in 1922 that, while it would be continued to him during his tenure of power, it would not be admissible to his successor. In this decision His Highness reluctantly acquiesced. 23. The dominating position in Muscat throughout the war was the rebellion of the Omani tribes, which Sultan Taimur inherited as a legacy from his predecessor, which he found himself unable to quell on his accession, and the history of which is separately dealt with in paras. 43 to f)2 of this Memorandum. The pre-occupation of the State with this problem absorbed its energies during the war period, while its relative remoleness from the politics of Central Arabia resulted in its isolation from the disputes of Ibn Sand and Ibn Rashid, and from the development of event alike at the head of the Gulf and on the coast of the Red Sea. 24. It is unnecessary to enter in any detail into the internal affairs of Muscat (as distinct from the Omani rebellion) in the early years of the war. The control of the arms traffic, itself no inconsiderable element in that rebellion, was on the whole satisfactorily maintained. Hut the Sultan retained his throne thanks only to the active militarv assistance and support of His Majesty's Government, a support not extended to the administration of his State until 1918; his administration, never distinguished, became hopelessly corrupt; while His Highness's financial position, as the result of the inefficiency of his servants, the demands of the campaign against the Omanis, and the loss of revenue involved in the Omani rebellion, gradually t p. 370/18. deteriorated until in J 918 it could be described as desperate.! 25. The Oovernment of India and His Majesty's Government, committed by their undertakings of 1895 and 1913 to secure the safety of the coast towns of Muscat and Muttra (cp. para. 45), in the early part of tiie war confined their action to implementing these undertakings with some generosity of interpretation, and abstained from interference in the internal policy of the State. But the inefficiency of the internal administration, the action taken at the behests of His Majesty's Government by the Sultan'and his predecessor, and the Omani rebellion were closely interwoven • the strategic position of Muscat, athwart the main route to the headwaters of the Gulf and to Mesopotamia, was of vital interest; the nominal independence (&gt;! the Sultan rendered his situation of more than local importance, and in 19! , the then Political Agent, Major Haworth, submitted for consideration a programme the acceptance of which would involve active interference in the internal affairs of Muscat by the Government of India and His Majesty's Government. 20. I he proposals of the Political Agent were that a levy corps should be established under British officers ; that a loan should be granted the Sultan sufficient to rid him of his liabilities; and that as a condition of the loan His Highness should agree to the transfer to British control of the Muscat customs, to the appointment of a British adviser and to the establishment of an educational system the ultimate result of which would be the provision of a nucleus of Muscat subjects educationally qualified for employment in the local administration, which had hitherto been whollv dependent on alien talent. 27. Major Ha worth's proposals necessitated careful consideration in the light of the Declaration of 1862, under which His Majesty's Government had become a joint guarantor with France of the independence of Muscat A further difficulty was the uncertainty as to the authority with which respon sibility for Muscat affairs would rest after the war, and the reluctance of the Government of India to initiate a policy the development of which was unlikely to rest with them. But circumstances forced the pace : negotiations with the Omani rebels in the spring of 1918 were unproductive, tluTfinancial/p 5$ situation l|ecaiiie, iJ possible, more critical; the reactions of maladministration at homo, alike on the financial situation and on relations with the tribes of the inteiloi, became increasingly apparent; and in August 1918 the Government of India, alter lurther discussion with Sir Percy (Jox and Major Haworth, expressed to the Secretary of State lor India the view that action could not Tel. from viceroy l)e postponed indefinitely, and submitted proposals to meet the situation. 1° s '?!• ?;.!o r I '' 1 A 1918, 28. The Government of India suggested the offer to the Sultan of a loan ^ :,,Hil/18 ' oi Ks. lakhs at (i per cent, interest to be paid off in 10 years and to be secured on the Muscat customs ; the loan to be conditional on agreement bv His Highness to undertake a delinite programme of reform which would result in financial reorganisation and the improvement of the administration • f.o . to i.o.. of justice. The Foreign Office did not consider^ that the proposed loan *ov. 5 isis, could afford any ground for legitimate protest 1o the French Government, to 1 ' 4!,13/18 : whom no reference was accordingly made by His Majesty's Government, and it was finally sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India on 4th December : treasury to f.o., 1918.t It was borne wholly by Indian revenues, the Treasury refusing to i™, 10 T 191 ?/- S of POntribntftt S. for I. to Viceroy, COniriOUCe.4. Feb. 14 1919, P. 371/19. 29. The programme of reform accepted by the Sultan as a condition of the loan covered the following points :— (1) Appointment by His Highness ol' an Indian, to be selected by His Majesty s Government, as Customs Director, who would in the first instance reorganise existing customs posts, and subsequently extend a customs system to all ports in Oman. (2) Fixation of amount of Privy Purse, remainder of State income being appropriated to charges of administration and payment of instalments and interest of loan. (3) Appointment of a Wazir or Dewan to conduct Courts of Justice and control proceedings of local governors of districts. (4) Improvement of roads, establishment of schools, &amp;c. (5) Reorganisation of Sultan's guard with a view to its eventual use as nucleus for a levy corps. 30. Considerable discussion took place regarding these conditions in the early part of 1019, Sir Arnold Wilson, then Civil Commissioner, Baghdad, feeling serious doubt as to whether they did not at once constitute too heavy a commitment on the part of His Majesty's Government, and traverse the principles of self-determination embodied in the post-war policy of the Allies. They were, however, ultimately substantially accepted by the authorities -concerned, and were put into operation during 1919. It may be recorded for convenience at this point that the Commercial Treaty of 1891, which had been renewed for five years in 1914, was extended for one year in 1919, and has been extended yearly since that date. p. 901/14. 31. An additional loan of lis. 1 lakh, borne, like the original loan, by Indian revenues, was sanctioned by the Secretary of State for India in February 1920, raising the total of the advance to Rs. 0^ lakhs, repayment of which was to be made in 19 equal half-yearly instalments of lis. 4G.740. 5.^ § Tui. to vicoroy, 0 Feb. 9 1920, 32. The very considerable degree of indirect control represented by the p - 8G:{ - w - measures described in para. 29 was justilied from the point of view of [f 1 - 1035 • s , ^Q'; Muscat by their results. By the beginning of 1920 the Sultan's debts had been fo^i.^D^o ilm, discharged with the assistance of the additional loan ; steps had been taken to 803 3/i ! &gt;: of 1. introduce financial order; the result of the appointment on 1st October 1919 {,^1, ma,' 31 '1921,' •of three trained Egyptian customs officials to reorganise the customs, which I&gt; - J 969 /- 1 - provided the major part of the revenue of the State, was seen in a balance in the Treasury on 1st October 1920 of l is. 3j lakhs, , and a regular Court j Pol. Agent to Poi. of Law, though with less immediately satisfactory results, had also been JvbN,, established. In addition, a European Wazir (Capt. McCollum, formerly 1921°, p. 202.3/21! Political Agent, Koweit) was employed from January to August 1920, when the reorganisation of the administration referred to in paras. 35-6 below rendered it possible to dispense with his services. Early in 1921, a Muscat levy corps under a British officer, which has since been maintained at a strength varying between 200 and 250, and which is now recruited from the p.5218/21,2230/26. Makran coast, made possible the withdrawal of the Indian troops maintained8 ^ by His Majesty's Government for the defence of the Sultan in Muscat and Muttrah. m 33. Simultaneously with the reorganisation of the internal administration, the steps referred to in para. 49 below were being taken to bring about a settlement with the Omani tribes. With the attainment of a settlement in September 1920, the State found itself solvent and in sight of a condition of ^ political stability such as it had not previously enjoyed, 34. While, however, the active intervemion of His Majesty's Government had secured the results described above in the aflairs of the Stale, the Sidtan, an agreeable but effete and indolent ruler, who had at no stage displayed the qualities of character necessary iu the ruler of Oman, saw in the new dispensation an opportunity to divest himself of his nominal responsibilities, and in March 192U, in a private interview with the Viceroy, expressed his ^ desire to abdicate and to reside permanently in India. 35. Other considerations apart, the facts that the tribal situation was still critical, that there was no obvious successor, and that the succession was a matter of more than local interest iu view of the Sultan's international treaties, rendered the proposal inopportune. Lord Chelmsford declined to countenance it, and His Highness was required to return to Muscat on the p - 1969 / 21 - conclusion of his visit. But the Sultan was in name at least independent; his reluctant co-operation might do more harm than good, and a compromise, ^ which by reducing His Highness's interference with the administration might simplify the task of reorganisation, was not altogether without advantage. As a result, the Omani tribes having in the autumn of 1920 asked that negotiations might be reopened, the Political Agent, after personal consulta tion with the Government of India, was authorised to inform the Sultan that His Majesty's Government were willing to assist him in the continued reconstruction of his finances and in his negotiations with the rebels on the following conditions :— (a) That if he persisted in his wish to live away from his State as much as possible, he should spend not less than five months every year continuously at Muscat. (h) That he should authorise the constitution of a regular Advisory Council, purely Arab in composition, to exercise all the ordinary powers of administration, not ouly during his absence, but during the periods of his presence at Muscat. (c) That he should retain the power to decide all matters of extraordinary importance affecting the interests of his State or his dynasty. (cl) That should he at any time change his mind and decide to live permanently at Muscat, these' arrangements should be cancelled, and he should resume all powers of administration, subject to the conditions of the loan made to him by His Majesty's Government (see para. 28 above). 30. After lengthy discussions these conditions were accepted by His Highness subject to the reduction of the period of his obligatory annual residence at Muscat and to the fixation of his privy purse at Hs. 1(),000 per ^ mensem. The Government of India agreed to modify their requirements; the period of residence was fixed at four months and subsequently reduced to three ; and approval was given to a privy purse of Rs. 10,000 per mensem subject to His Highness's continued good behaviour and to the continued ability of the State finances to bear the strain. An arrangement on these lines has since been in operation. Po], Awnt to Pol. 37. The financial position gave ground for increasing uneasiness in 1923 i-Tis'K 'iri'oi.' ' and 1024. Trade depression had reacted on the customs revenue; the Kes. to g. of L, Egyptian customs officials had not proved an unqualified success—one had !•! 4fi?~.'i'July 20 been dismissed while another had resigned ; efforts at retrenchment, and the 1924, r. 1288/24. imposition of certain minor taxes, produced no substantial result. A large increase in revenue could be secured only by an increase in the customs duty from 5 per cent, to 10 per cent., and the existence of treaties between Muscat and France and the U.S.A., fixing that duty at 5 per cent., made action on these lines difficult.f 0^ 9 38. The Government ol' India endeavoured to meet the situation, to the seriousness of which the Sultan was fully alive, by lending for four months a highly qualified European customs official, Mr. Bower, to reorganise the Muscat customs. At the same time, they agreed, at the request of the Sultan, to find a competent Englishman to serve as Financial Adviser, look after the finances of the Slate, and aid His Highness and the Council with advice. The Arab Advisory Council established in 1920 (see para. 35) had proved of no real assistance—the Sultan in 1924 had complained that they were, ' though very worthy persons . . . absolutely useless as administrators, apart from which they would never come to a decision about any matter, oven unimportant questions ' ; and the Political Resident agreed * Tel. 22 t. from that 'the difficulty was to get them to give a decided opinion on any : ' of I '' subject.' 0 P. 2028/24. 39. The post of Financial Adviser was offered to Mr. B. S. Thomas, 0. KE., formerly Assistant British representative in Trans-Jordania, who assumed duty in April 1925, and in 1926 was appointed Wazir and a member of the Muscat Advisory Council, functioning primarily as Finance Minister, but exercising also a full share in the general government of the State.t Mr. Thomas, who is the servant of the State and not of His t Letter 163 s. from Majesty's Government, was engaged on a contract for live years, with Apnu;*'' of I '' six months' leave after three years, plus one month's leave a year, and pay of P- -'077/26. Rs. 1,500—100—2,000. The terms of his service were approved by the Government of India. ]&gt; ' 4 - s!, li - 10. The result of the steps referred to above has been a very marked improvement. By April 1925 the financial situation could be reported j Y'p^ 10 ' ( 8 ' from 'more satisfactory than it has been for some years' +; by June the State Apni 51925, '' was reported solvent, and despite^ fluctuations in trade which have been p - 15 i6/25. reflected in decrease of revenue, the improvement has been maintained.

The improvement referred to above has been secured for rather than by the Sultan, although His Highness has on occasion shown a definite interest in the action taken.H Sir L.

'the Sultan is practically worthless as a Ruler, though he takes a certain ^^ ent 5 t l 0 g 1 ) , ( , . &gt;1 - ReH -' interest in seeing that others rule for him.' The Resident continued, p. 3301/26.' 'It was not thought advisable in 1920 to allow him to abdicate, nor do 1 think it desirable now.

A critical stage has not been reached, although the local Amir of Jaalan has set up an independent customs administration, but the Political Resident apprehends that should the Amir endeavour to throw off his allegiance to the Sultan and establish an independent dominion similar to that of the Omanis of the interior, the very considerable reduction of the Sultan's dominions and revenues which would r . , • 1 , • 1 . . ^ . . i tt - • » §§ Letter 167S.from be involved might necessitate active economic pressure by His Majesty s Pol.

The Oman Rebellion, 1913-21. 43. Up to 17So the capital of Muscat and Oman was at Rastaq in the interior. Up to 1793 the temporal ruler, who was also the spiritual rul^r of the country, had, in accordance with the tenets of the Ibadhi sect ol l^lam, been elected by the people. The transfer of the capital to the coasts of Muscat relieved the fanatical tribes of the interior of the direct control to which they had hitherto been subject, while the fact that from the usurpation of Saiyid Sultan in 1793 the formality of election had been dispensed with, enabled them to regard their nominal ruler as a usurper. 1 he relations with heretical foreign Powers which iollowed the transfer of the capital and the progressive degeneration in the capacity of the ruling house by which that transfer was accompanied, further weakened the position of the Sultan vis-a-vis the Omani tribes; and a series of rebellions between 1829 and 1867 culminated in the temporary seizure of power (1868-71) by a representative of a younger branch of the ruling family supported by the tribes. 44. The usurper was overthrown in 1871 by the legitimate branch; but between that date and 1913 numerous attempts were made by the Omani tribes to dethrone the Sultans, whose survival as rulers may fairly be said to have been due solely to the support of His Majesty's Government. In the years immediately before the war, tribal feeling was inflamed by the stoppage of the importation of arms,*'-' following on the suppression of the slave trade, both ot them measures permitted by Islam, at the instigation of Christian Powers; a carefully organised conspiracy followed, and in May 1913, in an outburst of religious fanaticism, rhe Omani tribes arose in rebellion.t 45. Reinforcements were despatched by His Majesty s Government in fulfilment of a guarantee given to the Sultan in 1895, and then communicated to the Sheikhs of Oman, that they would not allow attacks to be made on Muscat or Mattrah whatever differences the Sultan might have with his tiubes—a guarantee, the principle of which was extended in practice to the ports of the Batinah coast and to Kuryet, which contained resident British subjects. The warning in question was renewed, with the approval of His Majesty's Government,^ but produced no impression on the Omanis, and while in January 1915 the crushing defeat of an attack in force on the British outposts stationed at linit-el-hnlaj for tlie protection of Muscat and .Mattrah taught the tribes their lesson, by 1916 the rebels had obtained complete control of all Oman proper, and had organised a Government in it; and they remained thereafter in undisputed possession of the interior, and a constant menace to the coast towns. These they would probably liave taken had it not been for ihe British garrison at Bait-el-Falaj and the knowledge that the arrival of one of His Majesty's ships would quickly have forced them to relinquish any hold which they might temporarily have established. 46. Thanks to the efforts of the Political Agent, a conference to consider terms of peace between the Sultan and the Imam of the Omani tribes took place at Sib on the 15th September 1915. It was completely abortive,§ the demands of the Sultan that the Wadi Samail and its forts (captured in August 1913, and essential to the commercial prosperity of Muscat)|| should be returned to him, and his temporal supremacy in Oman recognised, being categoricallv refused by the Omanis, who demanded on their part that the Sultan should reform his Government according to their ideas, that their financial claims should be settled in full, and that the free purchase of arms and ammunition should be allowed. No reconciliation proved possible, and the negotiations were broken off. 47. From the breaking off of the negotiations in September 1915, no further steps were taken towards a settlement until March 1918. The Imam consolidated his power in the interior, while the Sultan's Government, according to the Political Agent, 'became involved in hopeless debt and reached an unparalleled degree of ineptitude.' 48. Further abortive negotiations took place in March 1918, but there was no substantial advance until the following year. At the beginning of11 1919 (see paras. 29-30) the necessity of taking drastic measures to preserve the Sultan's Government on the coast from complete collapse was recognised by the Government of India and His Majesty's Government; a loan from Indian revenues was made to Uis Highness to enable him to put his house in order internally, and pressure was put on the Omani tribes through the Political Agent with a view to securing a settlement between them and the Sultan. After much correspondence, the Imam was persuaded to resume vi&lt; e ero V negotiations, and a meeting took place between him and the Political Agent to s. of s. for i., at Sib on the 15th September 1919. 0 49. Very great difficulty was experienced in arriving at agreement. It was only after negotiations had been broken off, and definite action taken to show not only that the support of the Sultan by His Majesty's Government ^ was a reality, but that the Sultan was in a position to retaliate effectively ' on the Omanis by the taxing of their produce when it came down to the Jan. ib 1920, yjn lxxv/ ^ j c&gt; it P 5039/20 coast for export, that any advance was secured. A British Adviser was + X(lmir;ilt V t( ,, appointed to the State,! a British warship, which actually inflicted punish- Aprim 'i^o,' ment at Masnaah,^ was despatched to support the Sultan's authority on the p. 3140 /20. coast, and prohibitive duties were imposed on Omani produce, with the J o J' i l cer 9 , ;/ 4 ^ 0 x s ll ? f ' 1 o' result that in July 1920 the Imam was murdered by his tribes,§ and that on 1920^. Bm/20. 25th September 1920, after considerable further negotiation, agreement was viceroy to s . of s . reached between the conflicting parties. i| for r., 11 so s., Oct. 9 1920, P. 7486, 8294. 50. Under the terms of settlement, the Sultan undertook^ not to interfere f G of ^ Desp . 3 7 &gt; in the ' internal affairs ' of Oman (no formal admission of Omani indepen- Mar. :n 1921, r' . 1^19(10/21 dence being given); not to impose taxation in excess ot o per cent, on • commodities brought into the coast towns from Oman ; to allow members of the tribes to enter and leave Muscat and the coast towns in safety and freedom ; and to return fugitive criminals\)n demand. 51. The tribes, on the other hand, contracted to remain in peace and amity with the Sultan's Government, with which they were not to interfere; not to attack the coast towns ; to impose no restrictions on trade : to under take that travellers to Oman on their lawful business should be free and safe; to turn out fugitive criminals and evil-doers; and to dispose of the claims of merchants and others against them according to the Sharah law. 52. The agreement, which, as will be seen, involves recognition by the tan of the worked well Sultan of the practical independence of the Omani tribes, has, on the whole, since 1920. Action had to be taken in 1922 by His Majesty's ships in support of the Muscat Government against one of the Omani tribes (the Yal Saad, on the Batineh coast), 00 but, broadly speaking, the situation p. 3140 /20, has stabilised itself, and the Omani tribes, while they would no doubt '09 /22,393 /23. constitute an immediate menace were the support of His Majesty's Govern ment withdrawn, have ceased, at any rate temporarily, to interfere with and harass the Sultan's Government. V.—Foreign Relations of Muscat, 1908-1928. 53. During the first part of the period now under consideration, the existence of treaty relations between France and Muscat was, as will be seen from paras. 7-16 above, of the first importance from the standpoint of His Majesty's Government in connection with-the suppression of the arms traffic. It is unnecessary to enter into the details of the relations between the two countries, since the substantial consideration which led to French interest in Muscat disappeared with the amicable settlement reached between His Majesty's Government and the French Government on the suppression of the arms traffic in February 1914. But the settlement in question did not involve the abrogation of the French Treaty with Muscat of 1844, or of the Anglo-French Declaration of 18(32, and the continued existence of these instruments is of sufficient importance in present circumstances to call for brief notice in this Memorandum. 54. As will be seen from tne precis of the Muscat Treaties given on page the Sultan of Muscat has a Commercial Treaty with France dating from 1844. There is further the joint Anglo-French Declaration of 1862, 3064 C12 * Sir E. Grey to French C. &lt;1 A., Sept. 22 1913, P. 4222. t P. 522/11. I P. 929/11. J Pol.

Letter 109 t S. to G. of I., Mar*2 192K, P. 1592/28. the signatories to which agree reciprocally to respect the independence of the Sultan. While the agreement concluded by the Sultan with Her Majesty's Government in 1891, under which he pledged himself and his successors never to cede, sell, mortgage or otherwise give for occupation, save to Her Majesty's Government, the dominions of Muscat and Oman or any of their dependencies, represents a substantial departure from the spirit of the Declaration of 1S(32, that Declaration remained and remains binding, and an assurance that His Majesty's Government recognised it as such was formally given to France in September 1913.* Its existence, taken with the existence of the Treaty of 1844, was responsible for the difficulty which arose with France in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic between 1910 and 1914, and it is not only clear that it precludes the establishment by His Majesty's Government of a formal protectorate over Muscat, but in view of the action taken under its terms vis-d-vis France at Bander Gisseh in 1899, it seems probable that it constitutes a definite impediment even to the acquisition by His Majesty's Government of the lease, e.g. for use as a naval base, of any portion of Muscat territory. This latter difficulty is of importance at the present time in view of the revival by the Political Resident of the proposal for the establishment of a British naval base at Khassab in tho Musandim Peninsula (see paras. 65 and 71 below). 55. It is unnecessary to enter into the history of the efforts made between 1910 and 1914, in connection with the suppression of the arms traffic, to secure French concurrence in the abrogation of the Declaration of 1862 and possibly of the Treaty of 1844. Suffice it to say that it proved impracticable to arrive at an agreement which could be confined to Muscat, or even to Muscat and the French possessions in Indiat; that France was not prepared to cede her rights in return for territorial acquisitions in India alonej; that the Government of India were reluctant to agree to any cession of Indian territory, save in return for a corresponding acquisition of French territory in India (Chandernagore and the Loges); and that proposals of compensation in other parts of the world by the cession of Gambia, the rectification of the Desert Boundary between the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and French Equatorial Africa, or by the grant to the French Government of certain concessions in North Africa, came to nothing. 7 o 50. The position, therefore, is that French rights persist in their entirety. On the other hand, for the last 14 years no matter of dispute between the French Government and His Majesty's Government has arisen in Muscat; the Muscat dhows flying the French flag had fallen by 1920 to seven, of which two only belonged to French subjects^ ; and French interests in the affairs of the Sultanate has shown a progressive decrease, although a Consulate is still maintained by France. In 1920-1 the French Government relinquished the coal depot at Mokalla ,l| which had been granted them at the time of the Bander Gisseh incident of 1899 dealt with in Mr. Parker's memorandum, and in 1928 the Political Resident^ stated that he gathered from the French Consul (at Bushire?) that 'France novv takes very little interest in Muscat and is now considering closing down permanently the Consulate, which has not been held by any incumbent for some years.' 57. While, however, France may no longer actively concern herself with Muscat affairs, so long as the engagements referred to in para. 54 remain in being His Majesty's Government cannot be regarded as free agents in respect of Muscat, even though practical control may rest with them and all external expenditure on the State be financed by them. On a broad view, the interests of His Majesty's Government would probably best be served by the abrogation of botli instruments, and it is possible that, at some later stage, if French interest in Muscat diminishes to vanishing point, the French Government might be willing to consider the extinction of their rights as part of an arrangement which would also dispose of the controversial question of the French Loges in India itself, without demanding an unreasonable quid pro quo. But it cannot be overlooked that the 1862 Declaration, inconvenient as it may be in certain ways to His Majesty's Government, is of value as constituting a certain check on designs on Muscat by other Powers. From a different standpoint, its existence, taken with that ■vwM $ 13 of the Treaty of 1814, is au assurance to the Sultan, the value of which was certainly fully appreciated by his predecessor, that he will not suffer the fate of Zanzibar. 58. The United States of America, despite their Treaty of 1833 with Muscat, appear in practice to have no relations of any importance with that State, their interests in which are now entrusted to His Majesty's Government* No question affecting these relations arose during the period • Tel. from viceroy now under consideration. Here, however, as in the case of France, the to s.of s. for j ., guarantees embodied in the Treaty of 1833 would make it impossible for the rtosVIo . 0- Sultan to increase his customs duty (the most important method of raising revenue at his disposal) without the prior concurrence of the United States ( lovernment (cp. para. 37 above). 59. No question affecting the relations between the Sultan and the Dutch Government arose during the period in question, and those relations appear, as in the case of the United States Government, to be entirely unimportant. Under the Commercial Declaration of 1877 Holland is, however, entitled to most-favoured-nation treatment, and so would be affected by any modification of the customs duties. 60. The possibility of the development of a German interest in Muscat was of interest to His Majesty's Government in the years before the war. The present Sultan was informed in 1913 that His Majesty's Government could not agree to direct correspondence between him and the German t Tel. from Viceroy Consul, a practice contrary to the practice of Sultan Faisal, who had referred ^ 31 to His Majesty's Government matters affecting Powers unrepresented at P. i/H; f.o. to Muscat-']' rVr* 151 The danger of the acquisition by Germany of a foothold in Muscat through the grant to Muscatis of German certificates of nationality, was prominently before His Majesty's Government and the Government of India in J 914. To prevent the establishment of a precedent which could be quoted by Germany, arrangements were made that the British flag should not be granted to Muscat subjects in British East Africa unless a ''no objection' certificate had first been secured from the Sultan through the Political Agent,J and the question of securing the Sultan's approval to an f ( ' f ed ict which would have made his personal consent a condition of the transfer p. ibdi; f.o . to of allegiance by an Omani to a foreign State was under consideration at the p^vlo/iV 0191 outbreak of the war.§ The difficulty which would be presented by a , ,, t ( . r German request to the signatories of the Joint Declaration of 1892 for their 1, July'S u/u,'' concurrence in the conclusion of a direct German (Commercial Treaty with I&gt; • 3r,76 u - Muscat (on the basis of which a political connection could be developed), were brought to the attention of Government bv the Political Resident in Julv 1914. Relations between Muscat and Persia. 61. No question of importance as between Persia and Muscat has arisen during the period now in question. It may be recorded that in the autumn of 1914, on the request of the Persian Government, the Political Agent was instructed to exercise his good offices on behalf of Persian subjects in Muscat should an appeal be made to him, and in all serious cases of hardship and * T( ^; 0 4 oppression.^' p. 4591, p. 2 «)24/i4. Relations between Muscat and Ibn Saud. 62. Ibn Saud is a growing influence on the Trucial Coast, but he has not so far come very directly in contact [with Muscat, to the independence of which he contributes at the moment a less immediate menace than is the case on the Trucial Coast. VI.—Miscellaneous Questions. (а) The Muscat Order in Council. (б) Establishment of a British Naval Base on the Musandim Peninsula. (c) Cession of Gwadur. Id) Oil in Muscat.14 (a) The Muscat Order in Council—1887 and 1915. 03. From 1867 the jurisdiction exercised over British subjects in Ala sea' by the Political Agent and His Britannic Majesty's Consul was exercised froin po^re^'tn g im( i er the Muscat Order in Council oi I SOT. 0 Tlie revision of this Order, of i., Jan. 19 i9i8, vvhich jiad l)econie out of date, was raised hy the Political Resident in ihe p. 4487/13. Persian Gulf in 1013. His proposals that the revision should be undertaken i g. of i. Secret were accepted by the Government of India']' and His Majesty's Government, s ^of s !for i.^od'. ie aiK ^ a revised Order in Council in substitution for the Order of 1867 was i9i3. p. 4487/13. approved by His Majesty on the 3rd February 1915. The new Order, which i g. of i. Notifica- came into force on the 1st January 1916, j vests in the Political Agent, i^.^p 22 subject to the general control of, and right of appeal to, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, jurisdiction over— (а) British subjects, and British ships, with their boats, and persons and property on board, or belonging to them, within the limits of the Order. (б) Muscat subjects registered in the Political Agency as in the regular service of British subjects, subject to a proviso as to the disposal of cases in which such Muscat subjects are concerned. (c) The property, &amp;c., of all British subjects and of the Muscat subjects referred to in (6), whether within or without the limits of the Order. (d) Foreigners, with respect to whom any State, &amp;c., the subjects, or under the protection, of which they are has agreed by treaty to the exercise of power or authority by His Majesty. (c) Muscat subjects and foreigners, ether than those referred to in (6) and (d) in certain specified cases. The limits of the Order are the territories and territorial waters of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. 64. Various regulations, &amp;c., have since 1916 been issued under the new Order, certain amendments in which were approved by His Majesty in § p. 931 /22. Council in 1922,§ but no question of importance has arisen in connection with its working. (b) Proposal for the establishment of a British Naval Base in the Musandim Peninsula. 65. The earlier history of this proposal, which appears first to have been made by Sir Lewis Pelly, then Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, in 1863, is given in Air. Parker's Memorandum above. 66. The question was again raised in 1913. In a Note communicated to the Committee of Imperial Defence on 17th January 1913, the Admiralty expressed the view that it was ' essential that any naval station that may be required ' (i.e. at the mouth of the Gulf) 'should not be either at Bunder Abbas or on the adjacent islands, but on the Ras Musandim promontory or the Arabian shore. There would otherwise be risk of our being driven bv military force from our necessary naval base. Moreover, the only anchorages which can be trusted are on the Arabian shore.' 67. Almost simultaneously the Political Resident had suggested that it might be desirable to choose Ras Musandim as a site for a lighthouse in preference to Little Quoin,|| and the Government of India, in the light of the jan. 3 i9i3, p.'too . expression of the views of the Admiralty quoted above, were prepared to • 'jvi . from vie; rov agree to the substitution 'apart from the considerations arising from the i'-'^Irp'gsi Anglo-French Declaration of 1S62.'^[ 68. In April 1913 the Government of India reported that the Director, Royal Indian Marine, saw technical objections to the selection of Musandim as the site for a lighthouse on the grounds that ' thick weather over Tlt . Vl . ,. v Alusandim is the rule rather than the exception . . . further . . . worst to s .'o 'f s^for I'..' 10 ' tides experienced anywhere in the Gulf and its approaches are found round Apni 261913, Musandim Island.'** P. 1663. 69. In May the Admiralty expressed the view that ' while a naval base on the Musandim Peninsula would theoretically be in a somewhat better strategical position for the control of a railway passing along the northern15 shore of the entrance to the Gulf, if threatened by a hostile advance from the north-west, practical considerations point rather for the present to the use of lenjani . . . with Hasidn as a subsidiary base. It does not appear necessary to contemplate the actual fortification uf a naval base in this region so long as we retain the command of the sea in Eastern waters.'* This disposed * Admiralty to of the question of a station on Musandim; and it was agreed that the 1913 ' ighthouse )ii contemplation should be erected on Little Quoin as beinn' preferable from the strictly navigational standpoint. &lt;0. I here appear to have been no developments until in February 1927 the Political Resident t indicated that Khassab was of value, not merely in + Desp. 4 from Pou connection with the air route, on which it would constitute a jumping off Ros - to G. of i., ground for Gwadur on the Makran coast, but for strategical reasons, since Rms. 1927 ' ' the country possessing it can practically command egress from and ingress to the Persian Gulf.' Sir L. Ilaworth therefore favoured the purchase of Khassab from Muscat, possibly for about £12,000, and the establishment of ' a Gibraltar at the head of the Gulf.' He regarded this as practicable vis-d-vis France, in view of the right of pre-emption enjoved by His Majesty's ' government under the Ivxclusive Agreement of 1892. 71. No views have been expressed on the subject by the Government of India. With the Persian challenge to the position of His Majesty's Govern ment in Basidu and Henjam the possibility of establishing, if not a fortified base, at any rate a station, in the Musandim Peninsula or on one of the adjoining islands, on two of which (Telegraph Island and Sheep Island) the British flag has for a short period been hoisted in the past, becomes of more immediate importance. But, financial and strategical considerations apart, the extent to which His Majesty's Government are free agents vis-d-vis France, who, though aware of, is not a party to, and has never formally recognised, the Exclusive Agreement of 1892, will call for careful examina tion before a decision can be taken. (c) The Cession of Gwadur. 12. It was decided in 1863 after exhaustive examination that no attention need or could be paid to the claims to Gwadur, a dependencv of Muscat in Makran, on the Persian littoral of the Gulf, of the Khan of Kalat or of + j (lU( . 1 the Gitchkis. I his decision was reaffirmed by the Government of India of i. to a.g.g. Ill 1 928.1 Baluchistan, July 18 1928, p. 4140/28. 7f3. 1 he question of its retransler to Kalat at a price was raised bv the Political Agent, Muscat, in J 921, when the financial situation of Muscat was ovi. n:.: tvon. ♦critical, but the (.loveinment ol India were instructed^ that no overtures s. of s. for I. to should be made to the Sultan of Muscat without prior reference to His S'rvWoy lo s Majesty's Government, and the matter dropped. of s. for i., n82 s.,' Oct. !) 1920, 74. The geographical position of Gwadur would lend it considerable ^' i27, ' 75,:i - importance in the event of an air route being established along the north Arabian coast, and the Political Resident in February 1927 proposed i^p.toG. ..fi,. that it should be purchased outright for, say, £135,1)00, or about 20 years' F ] t,b - 19 1?) - 7 - purchase of the present customs revenue (Rs. 118,000 in 1926, say Rs. 1 lakh ^ 1575 ' after deduction of expenses of collection) as a British possession, the Khan of Kalat being compensated for his claim out of the amount in question. No opinion on the matter has been expressed by the Government of India. But, as in the case of Khassab and the Musandim Promontory (para. 71 above), the extent to which His Majesty's Government are Iree agents vis a-vis France would need very careful examination before a decision could be taken even were the proposal held to be free from objection on other grounds. (d) Oil in Muscat. 75. An oil concession was secured from the Sultan by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1925. The question is dealt with in the Memorandum on c.o. toi.o.. Oil in the Gulf on p. . pTsso/ ^ 5 ' &amp;c ' ,VII.—Summary. 76. The last 20 years have seen the elimination of trench influence in Muscat and the consolidation of the influence of His Majesty's Government. Despite the fact that the Sultanate is independent, a very close degree of indirect control has been established ; the succession has been regulated ; the customs administration has been brought under the management of officials recommended by the Government of India; a European adviser, a servant indeed of the Sultan, but recommended and selected by the Government of India, and working in close and friendly co-operation with the Political Agent, is the mainspring of the administration ; the arms traffic has disappeared, and, thanks to the active intervention, both political and otherwise, of flis Majesty's Government, a working arrangement has been reached with the rebellious tribes of the interior of Oman. The main difficulties which at the moment confront the State are the instability of the Sultan's character, and the possibility that before a suitable successor is available he may renew his desire to abdicate; the financial situation, which is complicated by the need for expenditure on essential improvements, the fact that the main source of additional revenue—increase of customs duties—cannot without great difficulty be tapped, and the necessity of repayment to the Government of India of the balance of the loan made to the State in 1919 ; and the problem, the importance of which cannot at this stage be appraised, but which may not prove to be serious, of the attitude of the tribes of Sur. 77. The direct intervention in the affairs of Muscat of His Majesty's Government has been very definitely in the interests of the State, and, so far as those interests are concerned, it is desirable that it should be maintained. At the same time, so long as the treaties at present in force between the Sultan and the Governments of France, Holland and the United States continue to subsist, there can be no question of the establishment of a formal protectorate,even should wider objections of principle not be held to militate against the acceptance of such a policy. From the narrower point of view of the interests of His Majesty's Government and the Government of India, there is no less advantage in a maintenance of the status quo, under which control in everything but name rests with His Majesty's Government. With the gradual elimination of British authority from the south Persian coast and with the adoption, for however long- it may be maintained, of an active policy in the Gulf by Persia, the strangle hold on the Gulf which the effective control of Muscat constitutes has assumed an importance, more especiall} 7- in view of British commitments in Iraq, which it did not in the past present. Moreover, not only is effective, if veiled, control of Muscat the point d'appui of the consolidation of British influence on the north Arabian littoral, but the danger, in its absence, of active foreign interest in the State cannot be overlooked, while should it ultimately prove that the difficulties in the way of an Imperial air route through Persian territory are insuperable, Muscat, with its dependency Gwadur, may prove to be of great importance for air reasons. From the naval point of view, should a decision favourable to the establishment of a naval base in the Musandim Peninsula at any stage be taken, and should it prove possible to reconcile the acquisition of a site for such a base with the terms of the Anglo-French Declaration of 1S()I2, the principality would acquire an additional importance. 78. To sum up. The predominant influence in Muscat of His Majesty's Government is in the interest of the State itself. The commitments involved in its maintenance are not, in existing circumstances, heavy, though the presence of a British Adviser and the exclusion of foreign interference imposes on His Majesty's Government a measure of responsibility for the progress, or lack of progress, of the State. The predominant influence of His Majesty's Government is equally, and more especially in present circumstances, an Imperial interest, whether from the commercial or the strategical standpoint. It can be maintained without undue ''Westernisation,' and, while it can never be popular with the fanatical tribes of the interior, its withdrawal is unlikely to be desired so long as the country internally remains divided as it has been for many years, and so long as no ruler arises with a personality so outstanding as to show himself capable of disposing effectively, single- handed, of the problems presented by the government of his State.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00018c_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/1/423</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x00018c</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/1/423</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'35/101 V (A 49) Muscat Miscellaneous'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1925/1928</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-09-18T15:12:20</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (118 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged chronlogically from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: The main foliation sequence commences at the cover and terminates at the last folio; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and can be found in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.
