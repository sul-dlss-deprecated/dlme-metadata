[To be inserted inside cover of all Sailing Directions.) PART I.—CLOSING OF PORTS. (1) My Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty having taken into consideration the fact that it may be necessary to forbid all entrance to certain ports of the Empire, this is to give Notice that on approaching the shores of the British Isles, or any of the ports or localities of the British Empire, a sharp lookout should be kept for the signals described in the following paragraph, and for the vessels mentioned in paragraph (5), Part II., of this Notice, and the distinguishing and other signals made by them. In the event of such signals being displayed, the port or locality should be approached with great caution, as it may be apprehended that obstructions may exist. (2) If entrance to a port is prohibited, three red lights vertically disposed by night, or three red balls vertically disposed by day, will be exhibited in some conspicuous position in or near to its approach, which signals will also be shown by the vessels indicated in paragraph (5), Part II., of this Notice. If these signals are displayed, vessels must approach the port with the greatest caution, and implicitly obey all orders or signals given them by the Examination vessel or Signal station. (3) At some ports or localities at home or abroad, searchlights are occasionally exhibited for exercise. Instructions have been given to avoid directing moveable searchlights during practice on to vessels under way, but mariners are warned that great care should be taken to keep a sharp lookout for the signals indicated in paragraph (2) above, when searchlights are observed to be working. PART II.—EXAMINATION SERVICE. (4) Under certain circumstances, it is also necessary to take special measures to examine vessels desiring to enter the ports or localities at home or abroad. (5) In such case, vessels carrying the distinguishing flags or lights mentioned in paragraph (7) will be charged with the duty of examining ships which desire to enter the port and of allotting positions in which they shall anchor. If Government vessels or vessels belonging to the local port authority, are found patrolling in the offing, merchant vessels are advised to communicate with such vessels with a view to obtaining information as to the course on which they should approach the port. Such communication will not be necessary in cases where the pilot on board has already received this information from the local authorities. (6) As the institution of the Examination Service will probably be unknown to vessels desiring to enter the port, especial care should be taken in approaching the ports, by day or night, to keep a sharp lookout for any vessel carrying the flags or lights mentioned in paragraph (7), and to be ready to ' bring to ' at once when hailed by her or warned by the firing of a gun or sound rocket. In approaching by night any port in the British Empire, serious delay and risk will be avoided if four efficient all round lanterns, two red and two white, are kept available for use. (7) By day the distinguishing flag of the Examination Steamer will be a special flag (white and red horizontal surrounded by a blue border). Also, three red balls vertically disposed if entrance is prohibited. Usually the Examination Steamers will fly the blue ensign, but at certain ports they will fly the white ensign. By nigbt the steamer will carry : (a) Three red lights vertically disposed if entrance is prohibited ; [b) three white lights vertically disposed if entrance is permitted. The above lights will be carried in addition to the ordinary navigation lights and will show an unbroken light around the horizon. (8) Merchant Vessels approaching a British port at which the Examination Service en force, must hoist their signal letters on arriving within visual signalling distance of the port and are not to wait for the signal ' What ship is that ? ' to be made from the Examination Steamer. (9) Masters are warned that, before attempting to enter any port when the Examination Service is in force, they must in their own interests strictly obey all instructions given to them by the Examination Steamer. anc ^ lor ^ ie Examination Anchorage, Masters are warned that it is forbidden, except for the purpose of avoiding accident, to do any of the following things, without permission from the Examination Officer (a) To lower any boat ; (o) to communicate with the shore or other ships ; (c) to move the ship ; Id) to work cables ; {e) to allow any person or thing to leave the ship. (10) In case of fog. Masters of vessels are enjoined to use the utmost care, and the port should be approached with caution. (11) When the Examination Service is in force, merchant vessels when approaching ports are especially cautioned against making use of private signals of any description, either by day or night; the use of them will render a vessel liable to be fired on. folio^^d ^ ie ^teehed to the ports will be acquainted with the regulations to be Wtl4521/9628/1275 9.32 2500 CT&amp;CoLtd GpSie., PS 20 C 1S\ tXI-A' (To face Cautionary Notice in all Sailing Directions.)

The gulfs were originally surveyed by Officers of the Indian Navy in 1821-8 ; subsequently, Commander Constable and Lieutenant Stiffe, of the Indian Navy, were employed in the Euphrates, 1857-8, and the Marie, 1858-60, in revising the survey. It was from their experience and remark books that this portion of the work was compiled, and published in 1864. The directions for the Makran coast, that is, between Cape Jask and Cape Monze (originally published in 1874 as the ' Persian Gulf Pilot Supplement ') were written by Lieutenant A. W. Stiffe, in most part, from personal experience. This, the eighth edition, has been prepared by Commander G. C. Glen, D.S.O., O.B.E., R.N., and contains the latest information received in the Hydrographic Department from British and foreign sources, including the results of the survey by H.M.S. Ormonde, 1930-32. The meteorological information has been revised by the Meteoro logical Office of the Air Ministry. Temperature is expressed in degrees Fahrenheit, rainfall in inches, speed in knots, and distance in nautical miles unless expressly stated otherwise. Information received from meteorological services which do not use these units has been converted into the units mentioned above by the Meteoro logical Office. Mariners and others are invited, in the interests of navigation, to forward to the Hydrographer, Admiralty, Whitehall, London, S.W.I, any information that may come under their notice which would be useful for the correction of the charts and other hydrographic publications issued by the British Admiralty ; early advice as to newly discovered dangers, the establishment of, or changes in, any aids to navigation, is specially requested. Copies of a Form (H.102), on which to render information, can be obtained gratis from the Admiralty Chart Agent : Mr. J. D. Potter, 145, Minories, London, E.C.3, or from any of his sub-agents in Great Britain and abroad, a list of whom will be found at the end of all books published by the Hydrographic Department.

The following rules for the spelling of geographical names (termed the R.G.S. II system) have been adopted for British official use, and the names in Admiralty Hydrographic publications will be rendered in accordance with these rules as opportunity occurs. In new editions of the various volumes of sailing directions names are, generally speaking, given in accordance with these rules, but where the name on the chart shows an older rendering of a name, such chart name is given in brackets after the new rendering and will also be given in the Index. The rules for spelling in the R.G.S. II system are as follows (1) The spelling of every place-name in an independent country or self-governing dominion using the Latin alphabet (including ' Latin ' alphabets containing extra or modified letters, such as Cesky, Croatian, Polish, Rumanian, etc.) shall be that adopted by the country or dominion, except in the case in which certain important localities have also, in addition to the official name, another customary name, notably different, in which case the name customary in British use (i.e. 'conventional') may be adopted (e.g. Geneva, Warsaw, etc., for Geneve, Warszawa, etc.). (2) In colonial possessions the spelling of such place-names as belong to languages coming under Rule (1) will be spelt in accordance with that rule. (3) The accents and diacritical marks in official use by the above countries will be retained. Wherever it appears desirable, the pronunciation will be shown by giving the name as transliterated on the system below. (4) All other place-names throughout the world will (with the exception of 'Conventional' names and some others) be spelled in general accordance with the following system. The broad features of this system are— (а) That vowels are pronounced as in Italian and con sonants as in English; (б) That every letter is pronounced, and no redundant letters are used. This system aims at giving a close approximation to the local pronunciation ; but it is recognised that in some languages, notably Russian, Greek, and Arabic, the necessity for letter-for-letter trans literation often renders this impossible.SYSTEM OF ORTHOGRAPHY XIU nj* Has three separate sounds, as in vanguard, finger, and singer. If necessary to distinguish, a hyphen may be placed, as in van-guard, sing-er .. .. In-gdssana ; Bongo ; Ng-ami, Tong-a. o Long as in both* ; short as in rotund .. ..

Zhob, Azhdaha, • The true Italian 6 is broader than this : almost as in broth. t Pronounced differently in Greek. I See note at end on Liquid sounds.XIV SYSTEM OF ORTHOGRAPHY Notbs. The doubling of a vowel or a consonant is only necessary when there is a distinct repetition of the single sound, and should otherwise be avoided .. Nuulua, Moorea, Jidda, Muhammad. Accents should not generally be employed ; but in order to indicate or emphasise the stress, an acute accent may be used .. Sarawak, Qantara, Tong-atdbu, Parand. A long or short mark over a vowel (e.g. a, 6) should only be used (and that sparingly) when without it there would be danger of mispronunciation .. Kflt, Hashin, Ang6ra. Hyphens will not be used except to indicate pronunciation and with the Persian izafat, -i- . . Mus-hil ; Pusht-i-Kuh. Inverted Comma and Apostrophe.—The inverted comma ' is employed only to represent the Arabic 'ain and the Hebrew 'ayin. The apostrophe ' in foreign words indicates a liquid sound (see below). Liquid Sounds. —The occasional ' liquid ' or ' palatalised ' sound of d, I, n, r, t, etc. (as in d'you, lure, new, clarion, tune, etc.) is as a rule sufficiently represented by a following y j where, however, owing to a following consonant, or to the letter in question coming at the end of a word, the y is inapplicable, the liquid sound will be represented by an apostrophe, thus : d , I, n , r , t , etc. The ' Neutral Vowel.'—The ' indeterminate ' or ' neutral' vowel sound (er), i.e. the sound of a in marine, e in often, i in stir, io in nation, o in connect, ou in curious, u in difficult, etc., e in French je, or the often unwritten vowel (Fat-ha) in Arabic,'etc., is represented as a rule by a ; as in Basra, Hawiya ; but sometimes by e, when the sound approximates more to e than to a : as Meshed, El Gezira. With reference to rule (4) it may be remarked that in the case of native names in countries under the dominion of other Powers, in whose map, charts, etc., the spelling is given in accordance with a system other than the R.G.S. II system, that the spelling of such native names in British publications may difier from the local spelling. Thus, the island in the Dutch East Indies east of Java is spelt Madoera in Dutch publications, but, in British publications, Madura. The Royal Geographical Society has published a book entitled ' Alphabets of Foreign Languages transcribed into English according to the R.G.S. II system.' This book enables the correct rendering of such names as are referred to in the last paragraph to be obtained, also of names in languages which are transliterated letter for letter.XV INFORMATION RELATING TO ADMIRALTY CHARTS AND OTHER HYDROGRAPHIC PUBLI CATIONS AND GENERAL NAVIGATION ON THE CORRECTION OF ADMIRALTY CHARTS, SAILING DIRECTIONS, ETC. Guides to Navigation. In addition to the charts, the naviga tional publications which are primarily affected by the continual changes and alterations that take place are the sailing directions, the list of lights, fog signals and visual time signals, and the list of wireless signals. The Admiralty notices to mariners contain information mainly for the correction of the charts and navigational publications. CHARTS 1. Degree of Reliance. —While the Admiralty charts can be relied upon to be correct for all information received, it should be clearly understood that the value of a chart depends on the character of the original survey and on the completeness of the reports of subsequent changes. The remarks on 'The Use of Charts as Navigational Aids, etc.', which are included in the introductory portion of each volume of Admiralty sailing directions, should be carefully studied in this connection. 2. System of Dating and Issue of Corrected Copies.— Admiralty charts after (a) first publication, are kept corrected by means of (b) new editions, (c) large corrections, and (d) small corrections. Copies of charts issued by the Admiralty Chart Establishment, Chart Agency or Admiralty chart depots are corrected except from temporary and preliminary notices to mariners (see paragraph 3h) , for all navigational information to the date of issue. (a) New charts. —The date of publication of a chart is shown outside the bottom margin, in the middle, e.g.:— Published at the Admiralty 30th May, 1925. {b) New Editions. —When a chart is revised throughout and modernised in style a new edition is published, the date being shown outside the bottom margin and to the right of the date of publication, e -r?- : New Edition 2nd J any., 1926. All large and small corrections notations are at the same time erased, and all copies of the chart are cancelled. (c) Large Corrections. —When a chart is corrected from important information which is too comprehensive to promulgate by Admiralty notice to mariners or to insert conveniently by hand on existing copies, but when the chart is not revised throughout, the date on which these corrections are made is shown on the chart outside the bottom margin and to the right of the date of publication, and inGENERAL NAVIGATION the case of a chart already marked with a new edition date, below such date, e.g.:— Large Corrections 10th Feb., 1927. All small corrections notations are at the same time erased and all copies of the chart are cancelled. [d) Small Corrections.— (i) When a chart is corrected from information promulgated in an Admiralty notice to mariners (except temporary and preliminary notices—see paragraph 3/z), the year, if not already shown, and number of the notice are entered in the bottom left-hand corner of the chart, e.g.:— Small Correction 1928-P03- Copies of the chart in stock in the Admiralty Chart Estab lishment, Chart Agency and the Admiralty chart depots are corrected by hand from such information. (ii) When a chart is corrected from information which is considered of no importance from the standpoint of safe navigation and which is, therefore, not promulgated in an Admiralty notice to mariners, the year, if not already shown, and date of the correction are entered on the chart, in one of two ways, in the bottom left-hand comer below the margin and in sequence with the notations referred to in the preceding paragraph, e.g.:— Small Corrections, 1928—[5.20]— or Small Corrections 1928—(VP 25) These indicate that the chart received minor corrections on the 20th May or 25th June, respectively. In such cases copies of the chart held by ships and Establishments are not usually replaced by new copies, but in exceptional cases, e.g., when new compasses are inserted, new copies of the charts may be supplied. It should, however, be particularly noted that the absence of corrections represented by square or bracket dates from a chart does not invalidate it for navigation. 3. Correction of Charts in Ships, etc. (a) General Instructions. —All small but important corrections affecting navigation that can be made to the charts by hand are promulgated in Admiralty notices to mariners and, with the exception of corrections from temporary or preliminary notices (see paragraph 3/f), should at once be neatly made in waterproof red ink on the charts affected, the year (if not already shown) and numbers of the notices being inserted, also in waterproof red ink, in the bottom left-hand comer of the chart as shown in paragraph 2d (i). The recognised abbreviations shown on Admiralty chart No. 5011 ('Signs and abbreviations used on Admiralty Charts') should be used. Generally speaking, the amount of information which should be inserted on a chart should be in accordance with that already shown. {h) On Large Scale Charts the abridged descriptions, as shown on chart No. 5011, of all details of all lights, light-buoys and fog signals, and the year dates of obstructions, reported shoals, dredged channels, depth of water on bars or in shifting channels, and irregu larities of lights, should be inserted.GENERAL NAVIGATION xvii [c) On Coastal Charts the abridged descriptions of only the principal lights and fog signals, i.e., those to assist in approaching or making the land, should be inserted. Particulars of such lights should be omitted, in the following order, as the scale of the chart decreases, viz.:— (i) Elevation, (ii) Period, (iii) Number in Group, and (iv) Visibility. v ' Particulars of fog signals should be inserted in their appropriate positions if space permits, but should otherwise be entered in a tabu lated list under the title or some other convenient place on the chart. Inner harbour light-buoys and beacons should not be inserted on coastal charts, and against other light-buoys only the character of the light should be inserted. [d) On Ocean Charts lights which are visible 16 miles or over should alone be inserted and then only their character and colour. [e) Insertion of Writing, etc .—Writing should be inserted as much as possible clear of the water, unless the relative objects are on the water, and care should be taken not to obliterate any information already on the chart. When cautionary or tidal notes, etc., are inserted, they should be written in a convenient but conspicuous place, preferably near the title, where they will not interfere with other details. (/) Erasures should never be made but the details should, when necessary, be crossed through in waterproof red ink. (g) Blocks. Notices to mariners are occasionally accompanied by reproductions of portions of charts (known as 'blocks'), and when correcting charts from such blocks the following points should be borne in mind:— (i) A block not only shows corrections in red hut may also cancel existing work on the chart. The latter would, how ever, invariably be mentioned in the text of the notice, and the fact that a block accompanies a notice should not cause the text of the notice to be disregarded. (ii) The limiting lines of a block are determined for convenience of reproduction and need not be adhered to when cutting out for pasting on the chart, provided that the point mentioned in the preceding paragraph is taken into consideration. (iii) The new information shown on a block can sometimes be inserted on the chart by hand, the reason for issuing a block in such a case being to avoid a long description of the new information in the text of the notice. (iv) Owing to distortion the blocks do not always fit the charts exactly, care should therefore be taken when pasting a block on to a chart that the more important navigational corrections fit as closely as possible. This can best be assured by fitting the block while it is dry and making two or three pencil ticks round the edges for use as fitting marks after the paste is applied. (A) Corrections from temporary or preliminary notices should be inserted on the charts in pencil and the year 'and number of the notice should be shown against them, e.g.:—N.M. temp., and also in the bottom left-hand corner of the chart helow thz small corrections notations (see paragraph 2d). Temporary correctionsxviii GENERAL NAVIGATION should be rubbed out when the notice is received cancelling them, but preliminary corrections should be inked in when the notice is received reporting that the changes have been made. Charts in stock in the Admiralty Chart Establishment, Chart Agency and the Admiralty chart depots are not corrected from temporary or preliminary notices to mariners, and when charts are received from one of these sources they should be corrected in pencil as necessary from the copies of such notices already held, or from those supplied with the charts. (J) Corrections from Wireless Navigational Warnings concerning derelicts and drifting obstructions, the temporary extinction of lights, displacement of important aids to navigation, ice reports, &amp;c., should also be noted in pencil, as received, on the charts affected. Wireless navigational warnings of a permanent nature and those relating to derelicts and drifting obstructions dangerous to navigation are re-issued in the form of Admiralty notices to mariners, but other warnings are not re-issued in this way, except in special circumstances. NAVIGATIONAL PUBLICATIONS 4. [a) Admiralty Sailing Directions, consisting of about 70 volumes for the whole world, contain general information useful to the navigator. An index chart bound near the beginning of each volume shows the area dealt with and the serial numbers and limits of all Admiralty charts for the area which were published when the volume was printed. Each volume is periodically revised throughout, and, in the intervals between the publication of new editions. Admiralty notices to mariners and supplements are published to enable the volume to be kept corrected. It should, however, be clearly understood that sailing directions cannot be correct in all minor details after the date of the latest supplement. The above mentioned corrections are not made in the Sailing Directions stocked in the Admiralty Chart Establishment, Chart Agency or the Admiralty chart depots. (&amp;) A new edition of each volume of Sailing Directions is published at intervals of approximately ten to twelve years. The number of the latest Admiralty notice to mariners used in its compilation is given in the 'Advertisement' on page iii of each volume, and the numbers of the notices affecting it between the dates of going to press and issue to ships and establishments are given in the notice announcing its publication, to enable the new edition to be corrected before being brought into use. (c) Supplements and Summaries of Notices to Mariners. A supplement to each volume is generally published annually, each succeeding supplement cancelling the former. When a volume is , taken up for revision, however, no further supplement to that edition is issued, but subsequent notices to mariners affecting it are summarised each year and issued as a separate publication, until the new edition of the volume is published. A tabular form for notation of the existence of supplements and summaries of notices is printed on the front fly-leaf of all Sailing Directions, and these notations are made as necessary in all copies issued by the Admiralty Chart Establishment and the Admiralty chart depots.GENERAL NAVIGATION xix [d) Corrections from Supplements and Summaries of Notices. Supplements and summaries of notices should either be retained intact for reference, notations referring to them being made on the pages of the sailing directions affected, or they should be cut up, the slips being pasted in the sailing directions at the appropriate places. Whichever of these alternatives is adopted, the tabular form on the front fly-leaf of the volume should be noted accordingly. (e) Correction from Notices to Mariners. A copy of each notice affecting the sailing directions should be pasted into them in its appropriate place as soon as the charts (see paragraph 3) and other publications affected have been corrected. 5. The Admiralty List of Lights, Fog Signals and Visual Time Signals for the world is issued in nine volumes divided geographically as shown on the index chart at the beginning of all volumes. Light-buoys are not included in the list. The volumes are published at intervals of three years, corrected to the 31st December, and in the intervals, supplements to each volume embodying all corrections to the 31st December are published annually, the second supplement in each case cancelling the first. Important amendments to the light list are notified in Admiralty notices to mariners, and minor amendments in section III of the weekly editions of these notices. (This section III also includes the important amendments.) These corrections are not made, however, in copies of the volumes stocked in the Admiralty Chart Establishment, Chart Agency or the Admiralty chart depots, and copies received from these sources should accordingly be corrected from the supplements (if any) and weekly editions of notices before being brought into use. e 6. The Admiralty List of Wireless Signals is issued in two parts. Volume I includes details of W/T stations, direction finding ig stations, fog signals, weather bulletins, storm and navigational rt warnings, time signal stations, &amp;c., whilst Volume II contains regulations, details of codes, list of observation stations, &amp;c., of id a permanent or quasi-permanent character.

The Admiralty Tide Tables are published in two editions, 'ty standard and abridged. The standard edition embraces the wholexx GENERAL NAVIGATION world, and the abridged edition covers European waters, the Mediterranean sea, and the west coast of Africa north of Cape Palmas. Each edition consists of two parts published separately, as follows:— Part I, published annually, contains tidal predictions for Standard ports. Part II, published at intervals of about five years, contains non-harmonic tidal constants, tidal differences and harmonic tidal constants for the principal ports, &amp;c. Supplements to this part are published as required. THE USE OF CHARTS AS NAVIGATIONAL AIDS AND GENERAL REMARKS RELATING TO PRACTICAL NAVIGATION 1. Reliance on a Chart. —The value of a chart must manifestly depend upon the accuracy of the survey on which it is based, and this becomes more important the larger the scale of the chart. To estimate this the date of the survey, which is always given in the title, is a good guide. Besides the changes that, in waters where sand or mud prevails, may have taken place since the date of the survey, the earlier surveys were mostly made under circumstances that precluded great accuracy of detail, and, until a plan founded on such a survey is tested, it should be regarded with caution. It may, indeed, be said that, except in well-frequented harbours and their approaches, no surveys yet made have been so minute in their examination of the bottom as to make it certain that all dangers have been found. The fullness or scantiness of the soundings is another method of estimating the completeness of a chart. When the soundings are sparse or unevenly distributed, it may be taken for granted that the survey was not in great detail. It appears to be insufficiently realised that the degree of reliance which may reasonably be placed upon an Admiralty chart, even in surveys of modem date, is mainly dependent on the scale on which the survey was made. The scale for publication is now generally that of the original survey, except in the case of Coast sheets, which are sometimes reduced. It should not, therefore, be assumed that the original survey was made on a larger scale than that published. It must be borne in mind that the principal method of ascertaining the inequality of the bottom of the sea is by the laborious process of sounding, and that in sounding over any area, the boat or vessel obtaining the soundings is kept on given lines; that each time the lead descends, or a sonic sounding is taken, the depth over only a small area is obtained, in the case of the lead, it has a diameter of only a few inches, and that consequently each line of soundings, though miles in length, is only to be considered as representing a narrow width. Surveys are not made on uniform scales, but each survey is made on a scale commensurate with its apparent importance. For instance, a general survey of a coast which vessels only pass in proceeding from one place to another is not usually made on a scale larger than one inch to the nautical mile, while surveys of areas where vessels are likely to anchor, are made on a scale of three inches to the mile, and surveys of frequented ports, or harbours likely to be used by Fleets, on a scale of from six inches to ten inches to the nautical mile.GENERAL NAVIGATION Close examination by sounding is the only method by which surveys on a large scale can be made, and in view of the vast mileage of surveys yet requiring completion in the interests of navigation, it would be a waste of time to undertake large scale Coast surveys. The scale on which a survey is to be conducted having been settled, it is manifestly superfluous to obtain more lines of soundings than can be represented on the paper. 100 soundings, which is the maximum number that can be placed with clearness on every square inch of paper, means that on a scale of one inch to the mile each sounding on the chart occupies an area representing eight acres of actual ground, whilst on a scale of six inches to the mile each sounding represents an area of a little less than a quarter of an acre, i.e., of lOO feet square. The following diagram represents as many soundings as can be placed legibly on a square inch of paper:— 16 15 15 13 13 K 12 II 10 9 14 15 14- 14 13 13 12 II 9 8 15 15 14 17 16 14 13 10 !0 9 16 16 17 18 16 12 II 9 10 18 17 15 12 9 7&gt;i 74 74 9 10 19 16 12 9 5*5 4il 64 i S'SI 9 22 19 16 10 5i 74 8* 10 20 16 (2 7i 5i 64 64 7i 8i 10 18 15 11 8 741 7 7 ) S 10 11 20 17 M- 11 tz 10 S 10 II 13 Little assistance in detecting excrescences on the bottom is afforded by the eye, when sounding in a boat, even in clear weather, on account of the observer being within five feet of the surface ; none in turbid seas. If, therefore, there is no inequality in the soundings to cause suspicion, a shoal patch between two lines may occasionally escape detection. Lines of soundings plotted as close as may be practicable on a scale of 6 inches to the mile would be 100 feet apart, and each line would be only 2 inches in actual width. Thus, in a chart on a scale of one inch to the mile, an inequality of some acres in extent rising close to the surface, if it happened to be situated between two lines, might escape detection; whilst in a chart on a scale of 6 inches, inequalities as large as battle-ships, if lying parallel to, and between the lines of soundings, might exist without detection if they rose abruptly from an otherwise even bottom. General Coast charts should not, therefore, be looked upon as infallible, and a rocky shore should on no account be approached within the contour line of 10 fathoms, without taking every precau tion to avoid a possible danger; and even with surveys of harbours on a scale of 6 inches to the mile vessels should avoid, if possible, passing over charted inequalities in the ground, as some isolated rocks are so sharp that the lead may not find the highest part. Better results can, however, be obtained by sonic sounding owing to the rapidity with which such soundings can be taken, but, even this method will not find rocks unless the boat or vessel be directly over them. Blank spaces among soundings mean that no soundings have been obtained in these spots. When the surrounding soundings are deep it may with fairness be assumed that in the blanks the water is also deep; but when they are shallow, or it can be seen from the rest of the chart that reefs or banks are present, such blanks should be regarded with suspicion.xxii GENERAL NAVIGATION 2. Fathom Lines a Caution. —Except in plans of harbours that have been surveyed in detail, the six-fathom line on most Admiralty charts is to be considered as a caution or danger line against unneces sarily approaching the shore or bank within that line, on account of the possibility of the existence of undiscovered inequalities of the bottom, which nothing but an elaborate detailed survey could reveal. In general surveys of coasts or of little frequented anchorages, the necessities of navigation do not demand the great expenditure of time required for such a detailed survey. It is not contemplated that ships will approach the shore in such localities without taking special precautions. The ten-fathom line is, on rocky shores, as before mentioned, another warning, especially for ships of heavy draught. Charts where no fathom lines are marked must be especially regarded with caution, as it generally means that soundings were too scanty and the bottom too uneven to enable them to be drawn with accuracy. Isolated soundings, shoaler than surrounding depths, should always be avoided, especially if ringed round, as there is no knowing how closely the spot may have been examined. 3. Chart on largest scale always to he used. —It sometimes happens that from press of work, only the copper plate of the larger scale chart of a particular locality can at once receive any extensive re-arrangement of coastline or soundings. This is an additional reason, besides the obvious one of the greater detail shown, why this largest scale chart should always be used for navigating. 4. Caution in using Small Scale Charts. —In approaching the land or dangerous banks, regard must always be had to the scale of the chart used. A small error in laying down a position means only yards on a large scale chart, whereas on a small scale the same amount of displacement means large fractions of a mile. This is particularly to be observed when coming to an anchor on a narrow ledge of convenient depth at some distance from the shore. For the same reason bearings to objects near should be used in preference to objects farther off, although the latter may be more prominent, as a small error in bearing or in laying it down on the chart has a greater effect in misplacing the position the longer the line to be drawn. 5. Graduation. —All Plans are now being graduated in skeleton style before publication in order to facilitate easy reference to Astronomical positions; previously published plans are also graduated as opportunity offers. The graduation is, however, of necessity, often based upon imperfect information of a conflicting nature; for this reason, whenever an Astronomical position is quoted other than approximate (i.e., when seconds are given), it is necessary to quote also the number of the particular chart from which the position has been derived. In this connection it is pointed out that, whenever possible, a position should be transferred from one chart to another by bearing and distance from a distinguishing feature common to both, such as a point of land or a light, etc., and not by the graduation which may differ owing to one of the charts being constructed on later and more complete astronomical data than the other. 6. Distortion of Printed Charts. —The paper on which charts areGENERAL NAVIGATION XX111 printed is, from various causes, subjected to distortion, but the effect of this is seldom sufficient to affect navigation. It must not, however, be expected that accurate series of angles taken to different points will always exactly agree, when carefully plotted upon the chart, especially if the lines are to objects at some distance. The larger the chart the greater the amount of this distortion. 7. Buoys. —It is manifestly impossible that any reliance can be placed on buoys always maintaining their exact position. Buoys should therefore be regarded as warnings and not as infallible navigating marks, especially when in exposed positions; and a ship should always, when possible, be navigated by bearings of fixed objects on shore or angles between them and not by buoys. Light-buoys. —The lights shown by light-buoys cannot be implicitly relied on, as, if occulting or flashing, the apparatus may get out of order, or the light may be altogether extinguished. These lights in the British islands are from 5 to 217 candle power. Cable-buoys. —Cable-buoys marking the ends of submarine cables usually are spherical or can shaped, surmounted by a globe and occasionally a flag. Below the topmark two white fixed lights placed horizontally. 8. Lights. —Circles drawn on charts round a light are not intended to give information as to the distance at which it can be seen, but solely indicate, in the case of lights which do not show the same characteristics or colours in all directions, the bearings between which the differences occur. All the distances given in the Light Lists and on the charts for the visibility of lights are calculated for a height of an observer's eye of 15 feet. The table of distances visible due to height, at the beginning of each Light List, affords a means of ascertaining how much more or less the light is visible should the height of the eye be more or less. The glare of a powerful light is often seen far beyond the limit of visibility of the actual rays of the light, but this must not be confounded with the true range. Again, refraction may often cause a light to be seen farther than under ordinary circumstances. When looking out for a light at night, the fact is often forgotten that from aloft the range of vision is much increased. By noting a star immediately over the light a very correct bearing may be afterwards obtained from the standard compass. The intrinsic power of a light should always be considered when expecting to make it in thick weather. A weak light is easily obscured by haze, and no dependence can be placed on its being seen. The power of a light can be estimated by remarking its candle power, as given in the Light Lists, and in some cases by noting how much its visibility in clear weather falls short of the range due to the height at which it is placed. Thus, a light standing 200 feet above the sea, and only recorded as visible at 10 miles in clear weather, is manifestly of little brilliancy, as its height would permit it to be seen over 20 miles, if of any power. (See table in Light List before mentioned.) The distance from a light cannot be estimated either by its brilliancy or its dimness. On first making a light from the bridge, by at once lowering the eye several feet and noting whether the light is made to dip, it mayxxiv GENERAL NAVIGATION be determined whether the vessel is in the circle of visibility corresponding with the usual height of the eye or unexpectedly nearer the light. 9. Fog signals. —Sound is conveyed in a very capricious way through the atmosphere. The following points in regard to fog signals should be borne in mind:— {a) Fog signals are heard at greatly varying distances. {h) Under certain conditions of atmosphere, when an air fog signal is a combination of high and low tones one of the notes may be inaudible. (c) There are occasionally areas around a fog signal in which it is wholly inaudible. {d) A fog may exist a short distance from a station and not be observable from it, so that the signal may not be sounded. (e) Some fog signals cannot be started at a moment's notice after signs of fog have been observed. Mariners are therefore warned that fog signals cannot be implicitly relied upon, and that the practice of sounding should never he neglected. Particular attention should be given to placing 'Look-out men' in positions in which the noises in the ship are least likely to interfere with the hearing of the sound of an air fog signal; as experience shows that, though such a signal may not be heard from the deck or bridge when the engines are moving, it may be heard when the ship is stopped, or from a quiet position. It may sometimes be heard from aloft though not on deck. 10. Tides and Tidal Streams. —In navigating coasts where the tidal range is considerable, caution is always necessary. It should be remembered that there are indraughts to all bays and bights, although the general run of the stream may be parallel to the shore. The turn of the tidal stream offshore is seldom coincident with the time of high and low water on the shore. In open channels, the tidal stream ordinarily overruns the turn of the vertical movement of the tide by about three hours, forming what is usually known as tide and half-tide, the effect of which is that at high and low water by the shore the stream is running at its greatest velocity. The tidal predictions given in Part I of the Tide Tables can generally be relied upon to give the times of high and low water within a few minutes and the heights within a few tenths of a foot; times and heights at Secondary ports, found by means of the tidal differences given in Part II, are considerably less exact than those predicted in the tables for Standard ports; times and heights found from the tidal constants may be considerably in error and must always be used with caution, particularly in waters where diurnal inequality is great. In crossing a bar or shallow flats, the tables for finding the height of the tide at times between high and low water, given in the Tide Tables, may be found of great assistance in calculating how much the water has risen or fallen at any hour of the tide. Heights of tide obtained from these tables must not, however, be implicitly relied on, for they depend on assumptions which are not always correct in practice. The datums used on the charts of different nations vary con siderably . That adopted for the Admiralty charts founded on surveys carried out by the surveying vessels of the Royal Navy is, in waters where the diurnal inequality is small, the level of meaDGENERAL NAVIGATION xxv low water springs, and in waters where the diurnal tides are con siderable, the level of Indian spring low water. As, however, a very long series of tidal observations is required before either of these levels can be definitely determined, and as the chart datum depends, in most cases, on a few weeks' observations on ly &gt; the datum adopted must always be considered as approximate, and differs, in some cases, considerably from the theoretical datum. Where Admiralty charts are founded on the charts of other nations, the datum is that used by the original authority. This may be mean low water springs (Denmark, Norway, Germany, Japan, &amp;c.), mean low water (U.S. Atlantic coast, &amp;c.), mean low water (U.S. Pacific coast, Philippines, &amp;c.), or the lowest possible low water (France, Spain, &amp;c.). All these datums must be considered as approximate only. It should be remembered that the tide may fall below datum, except in cases where the lowest possibly low water has been used as datum. In waters where diurnal inequality is small the lowest tides usually occur when the moon is near perigee and near the equator at springs, or at about the equinoxes; where diurnal inequality is great the lowest tides usually occur when both the moon and sun are in high declination at springs or at about the solstices. Wind or a high barometer may also reduce the height of the tide and cause it to fall below datum. Caution. —From the above remarks it will be seen that the depths shown on Admiralty charts are not always the least depths that will be found to exist, due to the fact that the level of the chart datum is, in most cases, above the level to which the tide may fall. 11. Arrows on charts only show the most usual or the mean direction of a tidal stream or current. It must never be assumed that the direction of a stream will not vary from that indicated by the arrow. In the same manner, the rate of a stream constantly varies with circumstances, and the rate given on the chart is merely that found during the survey, possibly from very few observations. 12. Fixing position. —The most accurate method of fixing a position relative to the shore is by angles between well-defined objects on the chart. All ships are supplied with a station-pointer, and this method should be used wherever possible. Two things are, however, necessary to its successful employment: First, that the objects be well chosen; and, second, that the observer is skilful and rapid in his use of the sextant and station-pointer. For the former, reference can be made to the pamphlet on the use of the stat ion-pointer, or to the Admiralty Manual of Navigation; the latter is only to be obtained by practice. It will readily be seen that a sextant often offers great advantages, as angles can be obtained from any position whence the objects are visible. In many narrow waters also, where the objects may yet be at some distance, as in coral harbours, or narrow passages among mud banks, navigation by sextant and stat ion-pointer is invaluable, as a true position can only be obtained by its means. A small error in either taking or plotting a bearing under such circumstances may put the ship ashore. It is not intended that the use of the compass to fix the ship should be given up: there are many circumstances in which it may be usefully employed, but errors more readily creep into a position soxxv i GENERAL NAVIGATION fixed. In all cases where great accuracy of position is desired, angles should invariably be used, such as the fixing of a rock or shoal, or of additions to a chart of fresh soundings or new buildings. In all such cases angles should be taken to several objects, the more the better; but five objects is a good number, as the four angles thus obtained not only prevent any errors, but they at once furnish a means of checking the accuracy of the chart itself. In the case of ordinary soundings, it is only necessary to take a third angle now and then; firstly, to check the general accuracy of the chart, as above stated; secondly, to make certain that the more important soundings, as at the end of a line, are correctly placed. Sometimes, when only two objects are visible, a compass bearing and sextant angle may be used with advantage. In passing near a point of land, or an island, the method of fixing by doubling the angle on the bow is often most useful. This method is as follows:— Suppose that the angle between the ship's head and an object is measured, and found to be X 0 , and that the time of the observation is noted. Suppose also that the time is again taken when the angle between the ship's head and the object is 2X 0 . Then, if the course made good is the course steered, the distance of the ship from the object at the time the second bearing was taken is equal to the run (over the ground) in the interval. Hence the ship's position can at once be laid off as a bearing and distance from the object. The most useful form of this method, the so-called 'four-point bearing,'' gives an excellent fix for a departure, but does not ensure safety, as the point and any dangers that may lie off it are abeam before the position is obtained. By taking the bearings when the object is two points and four points on the bow a very good position is obtained before the object is passed; the distance from the object when the second bearing is taken being, as before, equal to the distance run in the interval over the ground. This, however, is only true if the current is directly with or against the course of the ship. If a cross current or leeway has to be allowed for, the results by this method may be altogether erroneous and misleading. In such a case, therefore, the method should be discarded, and the ship's position determined by plotting the two bearings and the estimated course and distance made good in the interval in the usual manner. A table, 'Distance of an object by two bearings,' is supplied with certain chart folios, and is also given in Inman's Tables, by which the ship's position at the time of the second bearing can be found by using any two bearings (without regard to the angle on the bow) and the run between them; but this, like the method of doubling the angle, should not be employed when the vessel is subject to a cross current or leeway. The use of a danger angle in passing outlying rocks with land behind should also not be forgotten. In employing this method, however, caution is necessary, as should the chart be not accurate, i.e. should the objects selected be not quite correctly placed, the angle taken off from it may not serve the purpose. It should not, therefore, be employed when the survey is old or manifestly imperfect. In fixing by the compass it must always be remembered that two bearings only are liable to error. An absolute error may be made in either bearing observed; errors may be made in applying the devia-GENERAL NAVIGATION XXV11 tion; or errors may creep in in laying them on to the chart. For these reasons, a third or check bearing of some other object should be taken, especially when near the shore or dangers. The coincidence of these three lines will prevent any mistakes. Amongst astronomical methods of fixing a ship's position, attention is drawn to the great utility of Sumner's method. A Sumner line, that is, a line drawn through the position (obtained by an assumed latitude or longitude) at right angles to the bearing of a heavenly body, as obtained from azimuth tables, etc., gives at times invaluable information, as the ship must be somewhere on that line, provided the chronometer is correct. A sounding at the same time may often serve to give an approximate position on the line. An early and very accurate position can also be obtained by Sumner's method, by getting a Sumner line by a bright star at daylight when the horizon is well visible, and another Sumner line by the sun when a few degrees above the horizon, or, better still, by observing two or more stars at twilight. The Sumner lines thus obtained will, if the bearings of the bodies differ three points or more, give an excellent result. 13. Change of Variation of the Compass. —The gradual change in the variation must not be forgotten in laying down positions by bearing on charts. The magnetic compasses placed on the charts for the purpose of facilitating plotting become in time slightly in error, and in some cases, such as with small scales, or when the lines are long the displacement of position from neglect of this change may be of importance. The compasses are re-engraved when the error amounts to a degree, but the chart plates cannot be corrected more frequently from the impossibility of making alterations often on one spot in a copper plate. The geographical change in the variation is in some parts of the world sufficiently rapid to need consideration. For instance, in approaching Halifax from Newfoundland the variation changes 10° in less than 500 miles, and in the English Channel about 5° in 400 miles. The Variation Chart should be consulted on this head. On certain general charts embracing large areas with considerable change of variation, true compasses are placed instead of magnetic compasses, the variation being shown by isogonic lines (curves of equal magnetic variation), in a similar manner to the Variation Chart. One or two isogonic lines are also sometimes placed on charts in addition to the magnetic compasses, in order to indicate the general direction of these curves, and thus facilitate the determination of the variation to be employed in portions of the chart not in immediate proximity to any one of the engraved compasses. 14. Local Magnetic Disturbance of the Compass on hoard Ship.— The term 'local magnetic disturbance' has reference only to the effects on the compass of magnetic masses external to the ship in which it is placed. Observation shows that such disturbance of the com pass in a ship afloat is experienced only in a few places on the globe. Magnetic laws do not permit of the supposition that it is the visible land which causes such disturbance, because the effect of a magnetic force diminishes in such rapid proportion as the distance from it increases that it would require a local centre of magnetic force of an amount absolutely unknown to affect a compass half a mile distant. Such deflections of the compass are due to magnetic minerals inXXV111 GENERAL NAVIGATION the bed of the sea under the ship, and when the water is shallow, and the force strong, the compass may be temporarily deflected when passing over such a spot, but the area of disturbance will be small, unless there are many centres near together. It is very desirable that whenever a ship passes over an area of local magnetic disturbance, the position should be fixed, and the facts reported as far as they can be ascertained. 15. Use of Oil for Modifying the Effect of Breaking Waves. —Many experiences of late years have shown that the utility of oil for this purpose is undoubted, and the application simple. The following may serve for the guidance of seamen, whose atten tion is called to the fact that a very small quantity of oil, skilfully applied, may prevent much damage both to ships (especially the smaller classes) and to boats, by modifying the action of breaking seas. The principal facts as to the use of oil are as follows:— 1. On free waves, i .e., waves in deep water, the effect is greatest. 2. In a surf, or waves breaking on a bar, where a mass of liquid is in actual motion in shallow water, the effect of the oil is uncertain, as nothing can prevent the larger waves from breaking under such circumstances; but even here it is of some service. 3. The heaviest and thickest oils are most effectual. Refined kerosene is of little use; crude petroleum is serviceable when nothing else is obtainable; but all animal and vegetable oils, such as waste oil from the engines, have great effect. 4. A small quantity of oil suffices, if applied in such a manner as to spread to windward. 5. It is useful in a ship or boat, both when running, or lying to, or in wearing. 6. No experiences are related of its use when hoisting a boat up in a sea-way at sea, but it is highly probable that much time and injury to the boat would be saved by its application on such occa sions. At anchor, when the sea is sufficient to render it difficult to hoist up or in boats, oil bags from forward or from the swinging booms have been found to render the sea alongside comparatively smooth. 7. In cold water, the oil, being thickened by the lower tempera ture, and not being able to spread freely, will have its effect much reduced. This will vary with the description of oil used. 8. The best method of application in a ship at sea appears to be: hanging over the side, in such a manner as to be in the water, small canvas bags, capable of holding from one to two gallons of oil, such bags being pricked with a sail needle to facilitate leakage of the oil. The position of these bags should vary with the circumstances. Running before the wind they should be hung on either bow—e.g., from the cathead—and allowed to tow in the water. With the wind on the quarter the effect seems to be less than in any other position, as the oil goes astern while the waves come up on the quarter. Lying to, the weather bow and another position farther aft seem the best places from which to hang the bags, with a sufficient length of Ime to permit them to draw to windward, while the ship drifts.GENERAL NAVIGATION xxix 9. Crossing a bar with a flood tide, oil poured overboard and allowed to float in ahead of the boat which would follow with a bag towing astern, would appear to be the best plan. As before remarked, under these circumstances the effect cannot be so much trusted. On a bar with the ebb tide it would seem to be useless to try oil for the purpose of entering. 10. For boarding a wreck, it is recommended to pour oil over board to windward of her before going alongside. The effect in this case must greatly depend upon the set of the current, and the circum stances of the depth of water. 11. For a boat riding in bad weather from a sea anchor, it is recommended to fasten the bag to an endless line rove through a block on the sea anchor, by which means the oil is diffused well ahead of the boat, and the bag can be readily hauled on board for refilling if necessary. 12. Towing a vessel in a heavy sea, oil is of the greatest service, and may prevent parting the hawser. Distribute from the towing vessel forward and on both sides ; if used only aft the tow alone gets the benefit. 16. Concise Rules for Revolving Storms:— 1. Revolving storms are so named because the wind in these storms revolves round an area of low pressure situated in the centre. They have also local names, and are termed hurricanes in the West Indies and South Pacific Ocean ; cyclones in the Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal, and Arabian Sea; and typhoons in the China Sea. 2. In these storms the wind always revolves the same way in the same part of the world, that is, against the movement of the hands of a watch in the northern hemisphere, and with the hands of a watch in the southern hemisphere. The wind does not revolve in circles, but has a spiral movement, inwards, towards the centre. 3. Revolving storms have also, as a general rule, a progressive movement. Within the tropics they usually move from east to west at first, and then curve towards the pole of the hemisphere in which the storm is generated, and afterwards move from west to east. 4. The track which the centre of the storm takes is called the path of the storm, and the portion of the storm-field on the right of the path is known as the right-hand semicircle, and that on the left as the left-hand semicircle of the storm. 6. In the right-hand semicircle, if the observer be stationary, the wind will always shift to the right, and in the left-hand semicircle to the left. This law holds good in both hemispheres. 6. If a vessel be so situated in a storm that running before the wind the path of the advancing storm will be crossed, this is con sidered to be the dangerous semicircle. This will always be the right-hand semicircle in the northern hemisphere, and the left-hand in the southern. 7. These storms are most frequent in the northern hemisphere from July to November, and in the southern hemisphere from December to May. In the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea the storm period is from April to December, the most dangerous storms occurring during the transition periods at the beginning and end of the monsoon.XXX GENERAL NAVIGATION 8. The area over which revolving storms have been known to extend varies in diameter from 20 miles to some hundreds of miles, and their rate of movement in the West Indies averages about 300 miles a day; in the China Sea, Bay of Bengal, and Arabian Sea about 200 miles a day; and in the Indian Ocean from 0 to 200 miles a day, the more stationary storms occurring at the beginning and end of the hurricane season. 9. The indications of the approach of a revolving storm are (1) an unsteady barometer, or even a cessation in the diurnal range, which is constant in settled weather; (2) a heavy swell not caused by the wind then blowing; (3) an ugly, threatening appearance of the sky. 10. In order to judge what is the best way to act if there is reason to believe that a storm is approaching, the seaman requires to know (a) in which direction the centre of the storm is situated, (6) in which semicircle the ship is situated. 11. As these points cannot be determined if a vessel is moving with any speed through the water, the first proceeding should be to 'stop' or 'heave to,' and, as it is always best to assume, at first, that the vessel may be in the dangerous semicircle, she should be hove to on the starboard tack in the northern hemisphere, and on the port tack in the southern. 12. If an observer faces the wind the centre of the storm will be from 12 to 8 points on his right hand in the northern hemisphere, and on his left hand in the southern hemisphere ; 12 points when the storm begins; about 10 points when the barometer has fallen three- tenths of an inch, and about 8 points when it has fallen six-tenths of an inch or upwards. 13. If the wind shifts to the right the vessel is in the right-hand semicircle, if to the left in the left-hand semicircle, and, if the wind is steady in direction, but increasing in force, she is in the direct path of the storm. 14. If the seaman has reason to think that his vessel is in the direct path of the storm he should run with the wind on the star board quarter in the northern, and on the port quarter in the southern, hemisphere until the barometer has ceased falling. If she is in the right-hand semicircle in the northern hemisphere she should remain hove to on the starboard tack, but if in the southern hemisphere run with the wind on the port quarter ; if she is in the left-hand semicircle in the northern hemisphere she should run with the wind on the starboard quarter, but if in the southern hemisphere remain hove to on the port tack. 15. Should a vessel not have sufficient room to run when in the least dangerous semicircle, she should heave to on the port tack in the northern, and on the starboard tack in the southern hemisphere. 16. If in a harbour or at anchor the seaman should be just as careful in watching the shifting of the wind and ascertaining the direction of the centre, as by so doing he will be able to tell on which side of the path of the storm he is situated, and be able to act according to circumstances. 17. Should the centre of a storm pass over a vessel, the wind, after blowing furiously in one direction, ceases for a time, and then blows with equal fury from the opposite direction. This makes a confused pyramidal sea, which is especially dangerous.IMPORTANT.

GENERAL REM ARKS .—The Persian gulf is comparatively- shallow, and lies between the parallels of 24° and 30° North latitude, and the meridians of 48° and 57° East longitude. It is bounded on the south and west by the great peninsula of Arabia, and on the north-east by the mainland of the continent of Asia. 5 It is approached by way of the Gulf of 'Oman, which latter may be considered as an arm of the Arabian sea, extending in a north westerly direction from a line joining Ras al Hadd, at the eastern extremity of Arabia, and Gwatar bay, on the boundary between Persia and Baluchistan, about 185 miles north-eastward. 10 In addition to a description of the shores of the Gulf of 'Oman and the Persian gulf, this volume describes the coast of Baluchistan, eastward of which latter is British India. Physical features .—The south-western shore of the Gulf of 'Oman is, in general, steep-to with but few off-lying shoals, though 15 there are some islets near Muscat, situated about 93 miles north westward of Ras al Hadd, and others about 30 miles farther north westward. With the exception of the Batinah, a wide fertile plain extending, from the coast to the foot of the mountains, 'for about 150 miles north-westward of Muscat, the interior of the country 20 is arid, desert, and mountainous. The coast of Baluchistan and the northern shore of the Gulf of 'Oman extend, for about 520 miles, in a westerly direction, from the frontier of British India to Ras al Kuh at the entrance of the Persian gulf, whence the shore trends northward. The whole of 25 this stretch is, in general, clear of off-lying shoals, though there are some in the vicinity of Astola island, see page 65; and 54°° a2 GENERAL INFORMATION [Chap. I. Baklane rock, page 78, is an isolated danger. Churma is an island off Cape Monze, at the eastern end of this coast, and in Gwatar bay there are two islets, page 73. Owing to the small rain fall the salt nature of the soil, and the physical conformation of 5 the country it is almost entirely desert, presenting a succession of arid clay plains impregnated with salme matter, and intersected by watercourses. From these plains rise precipitous table-hills with fantastic peaks and pinnacles, varying m elevation from 2 050 fppf (624 m 8) at Ras Malan, s&amp;e page 62, to hillocks but 20 r/w feet (6*1 or 9*1) high. Farther inland, other ranges of moun- tains of varying height, extend parallel with the coast, and all ^Th? coast 6 klla're/lnd^inftented, but its most characteristic feature is the repeated occurrence of promontories and peninsulas 75 of white clav cliffs capped with coarse limestone or shelly breccia, all approaching the table-topped form. The intervening stretches of coast are low, in places rising to high white sandhills, or to sand dunes on which are small bushes and tufts of grass ; m many places the coast is merely a very low strip of sand, backed by extensive salt-water swamps; off such parts caution is necessary, for the distance offshore is very liable to be over-estimated. . With the exception of the Hab and Purah, there are no perennia rivers, and, near the sea, the streams, which are frequently dry or nearly so, except after rain, become salt-water creeks only navi- 25 gable bv small boats. There is no vegetation except, here and there a clump of date trees near a village or settlement, mthe vicinity of which there may be a small amount of cultivation. The only fresh water is that collected during ram m shallow wells or 16 The 0 Persian or north-eastern shore of the Persian gulf is moun tainous, and in most places steep-to; it presents a series of rugged and precipitous mountain ranges running, m general, nearly parallel with the coast. These mountain ranges increase m height as they recede inland and, being visible at great distances are good marks 55 some, even, are snow-capped for a great part the year.^ ^ valleys separate the mountains, and there are belts of low lan of varying width, between them and the sea, which are called by the Persians, the Garmsir or winter pastures; being at the southern foot of the mountains, and watered by no river, they are very hot 40 in summer. , ^ 1. t The Arabian coast, or southern and south-western shore ot the Persian gulf, is, with the exception of the north-western side of the •Oman peninsula, exceedingly low; from it, for nearly its whole length reefs and shoals extend from 30 to 50 miles in places. The 45 Arabian coast is, for the most part, a desert of white sand, and extensive tracts are quite uninhabited. Near the villages, or where there are any inhabitants, there are, generally, more or less extensive There are numerous islands in the Persian gulf, the two largest 50 being Qishm, off the Persian coast, near the entrance of the Gulf, and Bahrein, on the western side of the Qatar peninsula, a large projection in its south-western corner. Some are merely sand islets, whi e many are, at least partly, of volcanic origin. . . x The head of the Gulf is the low alluvial land forming the deltas 55 of the Tigris, Euphrates, Karun and other rivers. The north western end of the Gulf is probably silting up, owing to the large 30Chap. I.] GENERAL INFORMATION 3 amount of alluvium deposited by the great rivers debouching there. The water in the upper part of the Gulf is much more salt than that of the ocean. Caution. —With respect to the descriptions given in this work concerning trees, and the shape and colour of buildings, etc., caution 5 should be exercised, for many new buildings may have been erected, and old ones destroyed, so that such marks, which may at one time have been conspicuous on account of their isolation, shape, or colour, may no longer exist, or now be difficult to identify. The mariner may find, moreover, that some towns and villages mentioned herein 10 have disappeared, and others not mentioned have sprung up. New places frequently originate through the secession of families, who, being dissatisfied with the chief of their own tribe, emigrate and build a new settlement of their own. Depths.— The depths in the Gulf of 'Oman and in the Persian 15 gulf are generally great off high coasts, but less off low coasts. The Gulf of 'Oman is very deep in the middle, and the greatest depth, 2,020 fathoms (3694 m 2), is off Muscat; the 100-fathom (182 m 9) line lies, on an average, from 10 to 15 miles offshore, but in places it is closer to the coast. Towards the entrance of the 20 Persian gulf, the depth decreases to 70 and 50 fathoms (128 m 0 and 91 in 4), but near Ras Musandam there is a small area in which the depth is more than 100 fathoms (182 m 9). Within the Persian gulf, the depth rarely exceeds 40 or 50 fathoms (73 m 2 or 91 m 4), and it decreases to 30 and 20 fathoms (54 m 9 and 25 36 m 6) towards the head; on the Pearl banks, which occupy about one-third of the area of the Gulf, the depth is less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6). Across the head of the Gulf, the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lies about 50 miles distant from the entrances of the rivers. Within the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line, especially off the Arabian coast, the 30 soundings are irregular, with shallow banks and shoals. Off the Persian coast, and in the deep part of the Gulf, the bottom is generally mud; on the Pearl banks it is hard sand, coral, and rocks; and in many places off the Arabian coast, especially northward of Bahrein, it is white clay. 35 Off the Makran coast and westward of the great bank off the Indus (Long. 65° 50' E.), the 100-fathom (182 m 9) line lies from 25 to 5 miles offshore, beyond which distance the depths, in general, increase suddenly. The depths are fairly regular, the bottom being rock, sand, and mud near the land, and mud or clay in depths over 12 40 fathoms (21 in 9); as a rule, the increase in depth is gradual up to 20 fathoms (36 in 6) beyond which it becomes very rapid. Political and administrative divisions. —In the following sections, the countries bordering on the Persian gulf and its ap proaches are given in a clockwise direction, commencing at Ras al 45 Hadd, on the southern side of the Gulf of 'Oman. The Sultanate of Muscat and 'Oman. —Those portions, dealt with in this work, of the coasts of this Muhammadan state may be considered in three divisions, namely: 'Oman, the Batinah, and Ruus al Jabal. 50 The coast of 'Oman extends from south-westward of Ras al Hadd to just beyond Ras al Hamar, situated nearly 100 miles north westward, and includes the town of Muscat; that of the Batinah is contiguous to that of 'Oman, and extends from Khuwair to Khatmat Milaheh, a distance of about 150 miles; while Ruus al Jabal is a 55 detached province, at the extremity of the promontory forming^ general information [Chap.

The Kingdom of Nejd.— In the Persian gulf, the coastline of this kingdom extends from a position about 10 miles southwar o 35 ' Oqair to a position about 10 miles southward of Ras al Khafji, nearly 200 miles north -westward; it is bordered, on its southern side, bv the Trucial State of El Qatar, and on its northern side by the Principality of Kuwait, and may be said to embrace the district known as the Hasa. The kingdom is one unit of H.M. Bin Saud s domi- 40 nions, the full title of which is the kingdom of the Hedjaz, Nejd, and its dependencies. . , , . or . The administration of Nejd is simple, and of a patriarchal character, without ministers of Slate, the King being usually represented y a Viceroy. 45 The Principality of Kuwait. —The coast of this independent Arab State, under British protection, extends from a position about 2 miles southward of Ras Qaliya (al Kaliyah) to the junction of Khor Sabiya or Bubiyan and Khor Shetana, over 100 miles T nor t ward. The islands of Umm-al-Maradim, Karu, Kubbar, Kurem, 50 Failakah, 'Auhah, Mashjan, Bubiyan, and Warbah are dependencies of the Sultan of Kuwait. The area between Ras Qaliya and a position about 10 miles southward of Ras al Khafj i is a neutral zone. The Sultan's rule is personal and autocratic; in Kuwait town his authority is strictly enforced, but in the country districts, 55 where control is difficult, it is necessarily more tolerant.Chap. I.] GENERAL INFORMATION 5 The Kingdom of 'Iraq.— The maritime coast of this kingdom extends from Khor Shetana to the mouth of the Shatt al 'Arab. Withm the river, the western bank only is in 'Iraqi territory, as far as the mouth of Failiyeh creek about 3J miles above Mohammerah; but above that point both banks belong to the kingdom of 'Iraq. 5 The legislative power is vested in Parliament, with the King; arliament consists of an appointed Senate and an elected Chamber of Deputies. Iraq is divided into fourteen main administrative divisions or Liwas, each administered by a Mutasarrif, who is responsible to 10 the Minister of the Interior, but is also the agent and representative ot the other Ministeries. Each Liwa is divided into two or more Quadhas, administered by a Qain Maqqam; and each Quadha is sub-divided into two or more Nahiyahs, administered by a Mudir. Persia.— The riverain and maritime coasts on the south of Persia 15 extend from Failiyeh creek, in the Shatt al 'Arab, to the eastern boundary of Persian Makran, in Gwatar bay, and include the whole of the north-eastern shores of the Persian gulf and Gulf of 'Oman. This kingdom, the head of which is the Shah, possesses a Con stitution. There is a National Assembly or Majlis, and the 20 government of the country is in the hands of a Cabinet. The country is divided into thirty-three provinces, which are governed by Governors-general (Wali) or Governors (Hakim), who are directly responsible to the central government. The maritime provinces are Khuzistan, administered by the 25 Governor-general at Ahwaz, Bushire, administered by the Governor of the Persian Gulf Ports and islands, and of the districts of Dashti and Dashtistan at Bushire, and Makran, administered by the Military Governor at Iranshahr ; this last is a military division of Persian Baluchistan, under military control, and does not at present form 30 part of one of the civil provinces. The various provinces are divided into districts, the administrators of which are subordinate to the governors of their respective provinces. The only maritime district in Khuzistan is Mohammerah, the 35 coast of which extends from Failiyeh creek to Hindian; it is ad ministered by the Governor of Mohammerah. From north to south, the coastal districts and sub-districts in the province of Bushire are Dashtistan, which includes the sub- districts of Liravi, Hayat Davud, Rud Hilleh and Angali; Bushire; 40 Dashti, which includes Tangistan; Shi'b-kuh; Jehan-Girieh; and Bandar 'Abbas, which includes Biyaban Mughistan. Liravi is administered by the Khan of Liravi, and its coast extends from Hindian to Sabzpushan. Llayat Davud is administered by the Khan of Bandar Rig, and 45 its coast extends from Sabzpushan to Khor-ul-Qusair (Gasair). Rud Hilleh is administered by the Khan of Rud Hilleh, and its coast extends from Khor-ul-Qusair to Ramleh on the Rud Hilleh river. Angali is administered by the Khan of Angali, and its coast extends 50 from Ramleh to Shif. Bushire town and district is administered directly by the Governor of the province; it extends from Shif to Halileh. Dashti is administered by various feudal chiefs subordinate to the Governor of Lingeh; its coast extends from Halileh to and including 55 Tahiri.g general information [Chap. I.

I.] general information 7 are all very similar; a square fort of rough stones with loopholed towers at the angles, or several detached round towers; the Shaikh's house, and perhaps one or two others, of stone, the remainder of mats made of date-leaf stalks; a date grove in the immediate vicinity, and a detached tower or two near the wells, are the invariable com- 5 ponents. They are, as a rule, situated near a small creek or back water, where there is a smooth place for hauling up the boats. The large towns are sometimes walled round, and have a larger proportion of stone buildings, but there are no pretensions to architecture, and seldom more than two stories to the houses. The guns mounted 10 in Arab fortifications are, almost without exception, old and useless. The hirkeh is a characteristic of many of the Persian towns and villages on the shores of the Gulf; it is a water reservoir, either oblong and arched over, or circular and domed; being white, it is often conspicuous from seaward, especially the domed variety. IS Ihe bdd-gir or wind-tower is a feature in many of the villages on the shores of the Persian gulf. It is a square or round, masonry or brick tower, rising 10 or 12 feet (3 m 0 or 3 m 7) above the roof of the house of which it is the ventilator. The interior is divided vertically into four segments, the partitions being extended several 20 feet above the walls of the acual tower to catch any breath of wind from whichever direction it may blow. The base of the tower opens into the room below, and the seat of honour in the hot season is near this ventilating shaft. Population.—Languages. —The inhabitants of 'Oman are, for 25 the most part, poor, and a large number of them are nomadic; though mainly consisting of Arabs, there is a considerable admixture of foreigners, such as Banyans and Khojahs from India, and Persians, East Africans, and Nubians, whilst people of mixed races are usually found in the larger towns. The estimated population is about 30 500,000; and that of Muscat and Matrah together about 12,500. The language of 'Oman is Arabic; many persons in Muscat and Matrah speak Persian, Baluchi, and Hindustani. Business com munications can, however, be sent in English. The population of the Arabian coast of the Persian gulf is ex- 55 elusively Arab, except in the towns of Dabai, Doha, Bahrein, and Kuwait, where many Persians reside. In the towns they may be trusted, but it is not safe to land unarmed on the mainland, on account of the Bedawin who may be occasionally met and who, for the sake of plunder, attack even their own countrymen of the 40 towns. It is estimated that about one-third of the population is engaged in the pearl fishery, during its season, and that quite one- half is directly or indirectly supported by that industry. The population of Nejd is estimated to be about 3,000,000; and that of Hofuf, the largest town, about 30,000. The population of Bahrein ^ is about 120,000; Manamah and Muharraq each accounting for about 25,000. The population of Kuwait town is about 50,000, to which must be added an indeterminate number of Bedawin, and about 10,000 Persians. Outside the cities, the population of 'Iraq is almost entirely 50 tribal. That is, the population is divided into collections of kindred families which form communities under the leadership of their own chiefs or shaikhs. In the plain there are Bedawin tribes who are nomadic pastors of camels, sheep, and horses. There are also cultivator tribes near the rivers, and in addition semi- 55 settled semi-nomadic tribes and marsh tribes. Except in certaing general information [Chap.

The rural population is abnos^ exclusively Persian, but Persians do not take to the sea and all 25 craft sailing from Persian ports are live in mat huts, which are easily moved, so that a village is otten merely a temporary encampment. In more permanent sett ments there is a tower or fort in addition to the huts, and it is on y at the towns of Sonmiani, Ormara and Gwadar ^at masonry or 30 mud houses are found. In 1921, the population of the State of Kalat, including Makran was 328,281; and that of Las Bela, 0 Supplies.—Products.—Trade .—Basra is the only P ort . in the area covered by this work, at which all necessaries can ^ obtamed. 35 At other places the supplies are meagre. Fresh water is usua y both scarce in quantity and bad in quality, though it is better after the winter rains than at other times. The great heat of summer is very favourable to the cultivation of dates, which fruit forms the staple article of food of the inhabitants 40 of most of the coasts described in this work. Those grown near the Shatt al 'Arab, said to be the finest in the world, are sent to ail parts of Asia, also to Europe and to America; quantities are also exported from the Batinah. ^ , Probably the two most important products of the Gult are pearls 45 and petroleum; the latter is found at the north-western end of the Gulf, and refineries have been established by the Anglo -1 ersian Oil Company at Abadan, in the Shatt al 'Arab, to which place the oil is conveyed from the fields by pipe line. Oil is also being developed in 'Iraq, two companies having been granted concessions, and 50 drilling operations for locating oil are taking place at Bahrein. The principal exports of 'Oman are dates, pomegranates, dried limes, and dried fish. The imports are rice, coffee, and cotton piece goods, etc. ,, -i -c. a The principal exports from Nejd are dates, hides, and ghi (clarified 55 butter); but they are insignificant in quantity. The imports are piece goods, tea, sugar, coffee, and rice. The products consistChap. L] GENERAL INFORMATION 0 of dates, wheat, barley, fruit, hides, wool, ghi, and abas (Arab cloaks), in addition camels, horses, donkeys, and sheep are reared. The chief imports of Bahrein are rice, wheat, sugar, coffee, piece goods, tea, and ghi; the exports are similar but with the addition of pearls. 5 The importation of arms and ammunition into Bahrein and Kuwait, except with the consent of the British Government, is prohibited by treaty; and that of alcoholic liquors and drugs is prohibited by local regulation, though permission is granted to Europeans to import for their personal use. 10 The chief exports of 'Iraq are dates, wool, grain (chiefly barley), intestines (casings), hides and skins, cotton, liquorice, and gall- nuts. It is anticipated that in the future oil may take an important place on the list. In addition there is a large transit trade through Basra to the distributing centres of Persia. The principal imports, 15 excluding goods in transit, are cotton piece goods, sugar, machinery, silk piece goods, oils, tea, metals and ores, vehicles, provisions, wood, wearing apparel, etc. In addition to mineral oils, the principal exports of Persia are carpets, fruit, raw cotton, rice, opium, gum, and hides. The 20 chief imports are cotton goods, sugar, tea, machinery and tools, vehicles, etc. Trade on the Makran coast is trifling. Fish is the staple article of diet and quantities are salted for export. Currencies.—Weights and Measures .—There is no national 25 coinage in 'Oman; the current money there and at Bahrein and Kuwait is the Indian rupee and the Austrian Theresa dollar; the rate of exchange varies. The copper coins used are the pice of India, which pass at Muscat at an arbitrary and fluctuating value. so The currency of Nejd is based on the gold standard, 10 silver riyals being equal to one pound sterling; the riyal is divided into eleven qarsh miri , and the qarsh miri into two qarsh darij. Between 1918 and 1932, the Indian rupee was the unit of coinage in 'Iraq, but in the latter year a national coinage, the standard of 35 which is the dinar with an exchange value of one pound sterling, was introduced. The dinar is divided into 1,000^/s. The unit of Persian currency as from the 21st March, 1932, is the silver rial, the equivalent of the silver kran which it replaces, and of which 100 go to make one pdhlavi , the equivalent of one pound sterling. iO At the date of conversion the kran sterling rate was in the vicinity of krans 90 to the pound. The coins to be struck are: In gold, the pahlavi and half-pahlavi; in silver one-half, one, 2, and 5 rial pieces; in nickel 5, 10, and 25 dinar pieces. Only banknotes, silver, and nickel will be in circulation. ^5 On the Makran coast, the Indian rupee and copper pice, the Theresa dollar, and the Persian kran all pass current, the latter chiefly in the western districts. The Indian coinage is now probably the best known. The Indian rupee passes current everywhere, and vessels should 50 be provided with it, or be able to draw bills on Bombay, which latter are usually at a premium at Bushire. Weights and measures in 'Oman vary somewhat from place to place. The weights in use at Muscat and Matrah for the Sultan's customs are based on the maund or mann equivalent to about 8 lb. 55 14^ oz. ; but the bazaar mann equals only about 8 lb. 8 oz. The 54°° a*5 jq general information [Chap.

Makran coast, both the Indian maund and the English weights are understood at the telegraph stations. Pearl fishery. —The pearl fishery gives employment to the greater 20 part of the maritime population of the Persian gulf In 1905 about 3,411 boats, with crews numbering m all ^4 ,390 men were engaged in this fishery; of this number, no less than 2,39o boats, with crews amounting to 47,635, were under British protection. The boats vary in size from 10 to 50 tons, and their crews from 8 The chief pearl market for the Persian gulf is at Man amah in the Bahrein islands, with Dabai and Kuwait a long way behind. An increasing number of European pearl buyers now (193^) come to Bahrein, which, owing to its central position, banking, and tele- 30 graphic facilities, has taken away a good deal of the business formerly transacted at Bombay, several buyers sending their pearls direct from Bahrein to Europe. The pearl trade on the Persian coast is now negligible. , -u • There are three seasons for the pearl fishery, the first being the 35 Khanchia, the second the Ghaus , and the third the Radda .i he first lasts for from 25 to 30 days, roughly from the 1st to 30th of April; the second extends over May, June, July, August, and the first ten days of September; and the last continues for a further 25 days or more, depending on the weather, or until about the 5th 40 ox 10th of October. Divers are only bound to dive for their Nakhudas during the ghaus, and can make their own arrangements for the Khanchia and the Radda. The pearl banks appear from time immemorial to have been open without distinction to the Arabs of the entire littoral, and it would 45 be futile here to attempt to specify any definite tribal limits, but the external boundaries are well known, and all intrusion is resented. Nearly all the towns on the Arabian side, and many on the Persian, send boats to the fishery. The fishery is pursued on any banks where the bottom is hard 50 and level without rugged rocks; the average depth is 8 fathoms (14 m 6), and the extreme depth about 14 fathoms (25 m 6). The general Arabian name for such a bank is heir. Of these banks, the names and positions of no less than 184 are known between Dabai and Ras Tanurah, or between the parallels 24° 10' and 27' N. 55 latitude, and the meridians 50° and 55° E. longitude, whilst there are also 217 banks known to the fishermen, and 24 different des-Chap.

A small trade has sprung up in mother of pearl, the oystershells, formerly considered valueless, being now exported, chiefly to 5 Europe. Health. —In spite of the general dryness of the coastal regions, malaria is endemic throughout the year. The worst cases occur in the late summer and autumn and the disease is less prevalent in the months of January to April. Yellow fever is unknown. 10 Cholera and plague sometimes occur. Smallpox is more frequent; a small encampment at a short distance from an Arab town is often a kind of lazaretto for smallpox, and should be avoided by parties landing. Conjunctivitis and trachoma is extremely prevalent among the natives. 15 The hot season does not seem to be absolutely unhealthy; sea men suffer from aggravated prickly heat, boils, etc., but if they are kept out of the sun, and ventilation is attended to, there will probably be but little serious sickness. As little work should be done aloft by day as possible; awnings must be spread, and the 20 men should sleep on deck, where the dew does not appear to have an injurious effect. Absolute necessity alone can justify the exposure of the men to the sun, and tropical helmets should be insisted on. Kuwait is far and away the most healthy town in the gulfs, and malaria is practically unknown there. 25 Charts 2931-2934. METEOROLOGICAL INFORMATION.—Pressure.—The distribution of average barometric pressure on the coasts of the Persian gulf and approaches may be considered under the main seasonal types of winter and summer. In winter, from December to February, a region of high average pressure lies over central Asia, with an extension towards Spain, and pressure decreases towards central Africa; the average pressure along most of the above coasts is about 1020 mb., and the extreme range of the barometer in this season is said to be about 27 mb. In the summer 35 months, June to August, an extensive area of low average pressure is centred over north-west India, and the average pressure on most of the coasts is about 1000 mb. The periods September to November, and March to May, are transition periods, when the change from one type of pressure distribution to the other takes 40 place. At Lingeh and Henjam, the average pressure is 3 to 5 mb. lower than the figures quoted above as applying to most of the coasts. The diurnal variation of the barometer is somewhat peculiar; there is only one maximum, at 1000, and one minimum, at 1600,' 45 from which latter time the pressure rises gradually until 1000 on the following day, the depression which should occur at 0400 being hardly perceptible. The diurnal variation is about 3 mb. The barometer is not a safe guide, and as a rule it gives no warning of bad weather in the Persian gulf; the worst weather sometimes 50 occurs without any change at all, or the change does not take place until the gale has set in. On the Makran coast, the barometer is usually a good guide for the weather; its range, although small, is greater than in the tropics, and it falls before bad weather. The shamdl and occasional squalls, 5512 meteorological information [Chap. I. however, often occur without barometric warning. The table below, compiled from observations extending oyer nine years, gives the average height and greatest range on this coast for each mon . It shows an annual great depression during summer, and indicates 5 that the barometer is lowest in June and highest m December, the difference being 17 mb. Month. January- February March . April May.

Thus, in summer, under the influence of the low pressure over north-west India, the prevailing winds over most of the Persian gulf are north-westerly, while the south-west monsoon of the Arabian sea reaches the Makran 20 coast, and a deviated branch of the monsoon reaches Jask as a south easterly wind and penetrates for a short distance into the Gulf. In winter, the large scale distribution of pressure over the globe shows little direct influence since the waters of the Gulf, being at this season warmer than the neighbouring lands, produce a local region 25 of low pressure. The prevailing winds are mainly north-westerly over the Gulf, and from some northerly point on the Makran coast. For more detailed information about winds on the various sections, see below:— Gulf of 'Oman. —The south-west monsoon is not felt inside 30 Ras al Hadd. From about June to September, light variable winds prevail westward of a line joining Ras al Hadd and Cape Jask, and south -easterly winds, force 2 to 3, eastward of this line; the shamal, see page 13, occurs rarely; calms are frequent, and of shortChap. I.] winds 13 duration. Occasionally very hot, dry, north-westerly winds, lasting not more than a day, have been experienced in the gulf. The passage of a sailing vessel out of the gulf is very tedious. The sea is usually smooth, with a slight swell in the eastern part. During the north-east monsoon, the shamal and the nashi, see page 5 14, prevail, but calms are frequent and sometimes last for days. The general direction of the shamal is north-westerly. The nashi blows very hard in the gulf, and is much dreaded by native seamen, as the Batinah coast is to leeward, and affords no shelter. The suhaili, see page 14, occurs infrequently, but it is especially felt off Ras 10 al Kiih. Seamen say that there is either too much wind or none at all in the gulf, and this is nearly true, moderate steady breezes being almost unknown. In winter, especially, tremendous gusts blow out of the Devil's gap, the great valley in the mountains south-south-eastward of 15 Muscat, see page 39. Persian gulf.— Shamdl—The prevailing wind in the Persian gulf is the north-wester, called by the natives, shamal. Three types of shamal may be distinguished: the first is the winter shamal, which is usually described as coming suddenly, sometimes asso- dated with a thunderstorm and rain, and is the squally wind characteristic of the passage of the rear of a depression moving from westward. These north-westerly squalls come with reversal of wind direction, and bring thunderstorms and rain which pass off rapidly; dry, cool, weather, with good visibility, usually 25 succeeds them. The squalls are associated with rising barometric pressure, and the worst weather occurs soon after their onset. The time of occurrence of a squally shamal depends on the progress of the winter depressions, and it may reach a particular station at any time during day or night. On an average, a well-marked squally 30 shamal, in its eastward progress through the Persian gulf, reaches Jask in from 24 to 48 hours after leaving the head of the Gulf. At individual stations, and in ships at sea, the warning for a shamal of this type will be the falling tendency of the barometer a day or two previously, but not at the time, a rise of temperature 35 with south-easterly to south-westerly winds, and cloudiness changing gradually from high to low clouds. The indication from clouds, though satisfactory over land stations, generally, is not very satisfactory at sea, where'there is usually not much cloud before the appearance of a squally shamal. 40 The second type of strong north-westerly wind described as shamdl, lasting for a longer period, sometimes up to a week, with strongest winds towards the middle of the period, is not usually the shamal associated with a winter disturbance, but occurs during the summer months, due to an intensification of the seasonal low pressure areas 45 over the region from the Persian gulf to north-west India. A shamdl of this type occasionally rises to gale force gradually, and not by a squall with reversal of wind; it also falls off gradually with the return of the seasonal low pressure to its normal state; the strong gusty winds carry sand and dust from far off regions, reducing the 50 visibility considerably, but are scarcely ever associated with thunderstorms or sudden squalls. The third type of shamdl is merely the prevailing wind of the region; it has been described as blowing over the Gulf for 9 months of the year. Similarly the name bdrih or 40-days shamal refers 55 to the ordinarj^ prevailing wind.winds [Chap.

During win er, 25 however, these winds usually precede a western depression. Kaus and suhaili are reported to be associated with the appearance of cloud and warm moist gloomy weather and falling barometer these are signs of the approach of a western depression. The winds gradually strengthen, and the weather gets gloomier with ral ' or 30 passing drizzle, but the disturbed weather is of a milder type than thS of the squally shamal which usually follows Winter kaus or suhaili, unlike the shamal, are strongest towards the end of their existence, and occasionally attain gale force after blowing as a moder- ate to fresh breeze for at least 12 hours Although a kaus heralds 35 the approach of a winter depression, the depression may be following a course well away from the point of observation; m which case a gentle SE. wind or a kaus may die away without attendant bad weather or attaining gale force. A vessel anchored for protection from the kaus in an anchorage open to the shamal should ^eigh 40 immediately the kaus is over or she may have to ride out a sham^l on a lee shore. Easterly winds are of most frequent occurrence m the southern part of the Gulf. The suhaili is much feared by the natives as it blows into nearlv all the otherwise sheltered anchorages on the Persian coast. Usually it lasts only a few hours and often 45 it follows the kaus. . , . _ . . . JSfashi .—The local name for NE. winds is nashi. During winter, over the entrance of the Persian gulf and on the Makran coast, the prevailing NE. winds are associated with an offshoot of the anti cyclone of central Asia which projects into Persia. Sometimes, 50 with the approach of a western depression, the existing anticyclonic wind circulation over lower Persia becomes intensified, and the NE. winds produce secondary disturbances with the oncoming SE. winds, causing cloudy weather and rain over the hilly regions in the neighbourhood. It therefore sometimes happens that, with 55 the approach of a disturbance near Bushire, cloudy weather with rain is also associated with NE. winds over the Henjam -LingehChap. I.] WINDS 15 region. These disturbances are usually of minor importance and quite localised. The wind often blows from 3 to 5 days, but frequently for only one day. Before a nashi, the air is sometimes thick with dust blown off the land; after the first day, the air becomes clearer, possibly owing to rain on the land. The nashi blows in gusts with 5 frequent lulls, and if lasting three days is strongest on the third day. The barometer is not affected by a nashi, being usually high, but if so it falls a little when the wind is over. Squalls. —At the change of the seasons in autumn, very severe squalls may be expected, called 'uhaimir' by the Arabs. The air is often very clear about the time of these squalls, and it does not appear that they blow from any special direction. According to the Arabs they are experienced between the 14th October and the 23rd November, during which time no native vessels put to sea until a squall is over. If they do not occur before the 23rd November, 15 the Arabs consider that there will be none until the ordinary bad winter weather sets in. An unusual degree of electrical action is noticed, and St. Elmo's fire has been observed on board ship at this season. In Basidu road, very violent squalls are experienced from north- 20 ward in May, and from south-eastward in July, but these are not of frequent occurrence. Very heavy squalls from northward are experienced in May near the head of the Gulf. Alternating winds. —A succession of squalls from opposite quarters, each lasting only a few minutes, and alternating thus several times' 25 is occasionally experienced. Land and sea breezes. —These are uncertain. In fine Weather, very decided land breezes are experienced, but only close inshore. At Bushire, sea breezes are very regular in summer, setting in, when there is no shamal, at 0900; the land breezes are very light 30 and of short duration. At Basidu, land breezes are strong and last until 1000; sea breezes are also regular, but do not set in so early as at Bushire. On the Arabian coast, the land breezes are often strong in the morning, and come off occasionally in hot gusts. At Kuwait, 35 the sea breezes are regular in fine weather. Periodical winds. —'The following statement has been compiled from information obtained from the masters of Arab dhows :— Butain—2nd January to 7th February—Usually starts with a shamal, and then changes into a westerly wind and continues as such. 40 'Ajuzah—26th February to 8th March—A very strong shamal, lasting for at least five days. Sometimes it veers round to kaus. Barih ath-Thuraiya or Barih as-Sarayat—7th May to 27th May—• Usually starts with a shamal, but changes frequently and suddenly. Normally, it is not very strong. 45 Barih al-Jauzah or Barih al-Kabfr—6th June to 16th July— There is a strong shamal during most of this period. It is frequently misnamed 'The shamal' by Europeans. Mirzam—17th July to 31st July—A hot period in which there is rarely much wind. 50 Kulaibain—1st August to 13th August—Usually pronounced 'Chilaibain'. There is usually a dead calm, or, if not, a kaus, during this fortnight, which is generally the hottest time of the year. Ukaidhib—14th October to 2nd November—Pronounced 'Uchaid- hib'. Very changeable, but usually starts with a very strong 55 kaus which veers round, through west, to shamdl.16 WINDS [Chap. I. The wing, Uhaimir—3rd November to 23rd November—The wind is predominantly kaus, though it sometimes ends by veering round to shamal and blowing for several days as such. Arab sailing vessels rarely start on a long voyage in November until it is over, 5 as it is very treacherous. Marba-'aniyah or Arba-'in—24th November to 1st January- Starts with a strong shamal, and then continues blowing from west ward in the early part of the day and veering round to east in the afternoon. 10 Makran coast. —The south-west monsoon commences m the Arabian sea in Mav, and usually sets in at Karachi between the 6th June and 10th'July, with a few days', or even a fortnight's, hard blow from between south-west and west-south-west, accompanied by cloudy weather and scud flying overhead. It is announced by 15 a falling barometer, and is accompanied or preceded by a heavy swell from the same quarter. After the first blow, it moderates, and strong to light breezes prevail until the end of August or sometimes the middle of September, the wind at night veering westward several points. The swell 20 continues, and varies from a high to a long low swell, according to the weather. Soon after the middle of July there is a lull, clouds bank up with lightning in the east, and sometimes during a heavy squall, accompanied by torrents of rain, the wind shifts to the west. The weather from May to September is very hazy, so that the land 25 is often not seen until close-to. . , , At Gwadar, the wind is not so strong as at Karachi, and the swell is longer and more from southward; westward ot Gwadar the wind decreases, and at Cape Jask it is a light southerly to south-easterly breeze, accompanied by a long ground swell causing surf on the SO coast, The monsoon rains do not appear to extend westward of Ormara. Land and sea breezes. —These prevail on the coast in winter; the land breeze sets in at midnight, or some hours later, from between north-north-east and east-north-east, and veering gradually east- 35 ward, is followed by a calm before noon, or by a light south-easterly air which veers to south-west in the afternoon. The land breezes prevail from October to February, and are often fresh or strong in November, December, and January. After January, they are weak and uncertain, and in April are sometimes felt as hot winds. The sea breezes are light from October to January, and increase in strength as the season advances, being strong in April and May; they veer several points off the land at night, and are light or fail in the morning. N or th - easier s. —During December and January, strong north- 45 easters are frequently experienced, accompanied by clouds of dust, and often by gloomy squally weather, with rain about the end of the year. They last sometimes 2 or 3 days, in which case the wind usually lulls in the afternoon, freshening again at night. Shamdl. —Winds of this type, see page 13, are experienced at 50 all times of the year near Cape Jask, and in winter, sometimes along the whole coast. In January or February, especially, a very strong shamal often blows home to Karachi, and along the coast southward to Bombay; there is usually only one such shamal annually, and it lasts 2 or 3 days, raising a heavy sea. These winds 55 are accompanied by a thick haze caused by fine dust, probably from the plains of 'Iraq.Chap. I.] WINDS 17 In winter, heavy squalls from north-west to north-east, with rain, are experienced off the western part of the Makran coast. Remarks.—li was noticed in H.M.S. Proserpine, whilst cruising off the Makran coast in April, 1910, that absence of dew usually precedes a westerly wind, but it is also absent without any wind 5 succeeding. A windy appearance of the sky frequently leads to nothing, and the strongest winds usually arise without any clouds or threatening signs. The boats easily rode out a bad shamdl on two occasions, and were never in difficulties. Any wind usually hauls two or three points to the north during the evening and night. 10 In moderate weather, the wind follows the sun with considerable regularity, a calm being almost invariable during the forenoon. Cyclones and depressions .—In winter, December to February, frequent depressions, coming regularly from the west, pass through Persia, the Persian gulf, the Gulf of 'Oman and along the Makran 15 coast. On an average the number of western depressions which affect this area in winter is 6 in January, 8 in February, 6 in March, 5 in November and 6 in December. The marked variation of weather in winter depends on the movement and the intensity of these western depressions. Thus, when a depression is approaching 20 'Iraq or the Gulf, through Arabia, the usual north-westerly wind over the northern portion of the Gulf changes to some point between SE. and SW. The clouds, at first of cirrus type, gradually become lower, temperature rises, the wind backs a little, and drizzle or fog may occur. W ith the further eastward movement of the 25 depression, a veer of wind to a point between west and north occurs, possibly accompanied by squalls. This sequence of phenomena is observed when the depression centre passes northward of the ship; but if the centre passes southward, winds from SE. backing towards N. are experienced, compare remarks on kaus, etc., page 14. 30 Near Gwadar, depressions are said to tend to move along the line of the mountains of the north-west frontier and also to break up into parts, thus giving a tendency for disturbed weather to be prolonged in the neighbourhood of Gwadar. Normally the western depressions reach their most southerly track in February. 35 In summer, June to August, occasional eastern depressions, originating in the Bay of Bengal, move westward towards north western India; some of these pass through Sind or Gujarat into the northern part of the Arabian sea, and along the Makran coast. On such occasions, heavy rain, rough seas, and squally weather 40 occur over the Pasni-Karachi section; light passing showers, dust- storms, rough seas, and squally weather occur up to the Gulf of 'Oman, and thunderstorms occur over the hilly section of the Province of 'Oman westward of Muscat. Over the Persian gulf, only dust-storms occur, even on such occasions. Occasionally ^5 however, from June to September, it has been noticed that after a temporary period of inactive monsoon, the revival of the monsoon gives rise to a 'monsoon depression' off the Bombay coast. These depressions usually show a tendency to move in a direction about NNW. They sometimes break up into secondaries entering India 50 near Gujarat and also continue to move in a more westerly direction, reaching the extreme north of the Arabian sea and the Gulf of 'Oman before entering Persia or Baluchistan and causing squally and overcast weather, slight passing showers, dust-storms, rough seas, and heavy swell on the Persian coast and thunderstorms over the 55 hills of 'Oman.18 WINDS [Chap. I. Besides the well-marked summer and winter periods, there are two transition periods. During the period March to May, the western depressions gradually become less important, Occasionally, however, storms and depressions form in the Arabian sea and move 5 towards higher latitudes. These storms, like the usual tropical cyclones, in most cases have a well-marked central region of bad weather. They do not all move in the same direction; but they have a general tendency to north-westward movement, and some of them reach far enough northward to affect the Makran coast. Because 20 of the concentrated nature of the storm area, a severe storm may be passing over a particular place without materially affecting the weather at neighbouring stations. Similarly, during the months of September to November, the eastern depressions become less important. Occasionally, however, i5 storms form in the Arabian sea; these storms, moving westward or north-westward, usually cross the south Arabian coast far away from the Makran coast, but occasionally one or two have been found to reach the Gulf of 'Oman. Strong winds, rough seas, and cloudy weather are said to be 20 encountered more frequently over the region of the Gulf of 'Oman than over the other regions. There is a general opinion that the storms in the Arabian sea seldom reach the Makran coast; but considering the history of previous known storms, it can be seen that the number of occasions 25 on which Arabian sea storms have been near or have passed over the Makran coast is comparable with the number of storms that have entered the west coast of India. In spite of the fact that these storms usually lose part of their energy as they move to more northerly latitudes, their effect is felt in a heavy southerly swell, 30 with falling barometer and cloudy unsettled weather, and, after the storm has passed, in a strong breeze or moderate gale from south- westward. A brief mention of the different storms that have been known to affect the section between Karachi and the entrance of the Persian gulf is of interest:— 35 1—3rd week of April, 1847—a severe storm appears to have entered the Gulf of 'Oman in the neighbourhood of Muscat, with all the attendant severe weather of a tropical cyclone. 2—May, 1871—a storm in the Arabian sea, far from the coast, appears to have caused a moderate south-westerly gale and 40 heavy sea and swell on the Makran coast. 3—3rd week of June, 1872—a severe storm gave an easterly gale and rain along the whole coast, westward as far as Charbar. 4—3rd week of May, 1886—a severe storm apparently entered 45 the Makran coast near Gwadar. Data are not available, but a rapid fall of pressure with strong surface winds occurred at Karachi and Quetta. 5—2nd week of June, 1889—a storm moving westward, parallel with the Makran coast, passed Muscat on the 10th where it 50 caused considerable damage. 6—1st week of June, 1890—a storm, moving north-westward, entered the Gulf of 'Oman with heavy gales and rain squalls at Muscat and Jask. 7—2nd week of June, 1890—a moderate storm travelled along 55 the west coast and, between the 18th and 22nd, moved parallel with the Makran coast, as shown by the very lowI. Chap. I.] winds 19 le pressure over Jask and Muscat. It is not known what kind f, of weather it caused along the Makran coast, 'e ^ week of June, 1898—a severe storm moved due north along the line Muscat—Jask, and did considerable damage. l( l ^ Ist week of May, 1901—H.M.S. Sphinx encountered a NE. 5 iy wind, force 11, in lat. 25° N., long. 63| 0 E. on the evening oi of 'the 3rd. A terrific storm was reported at Ormara on the se morning of the 4th. Karachi reported a severe SW. gale iy on the 4th and a gale on the 5th, whilst the reversal of wind he from east to west at Muscat and Jask showed that the storm 10 had moved into Makran. 10—2nd week of May, 1902—a severe storm passed inland east ^ of Karachi, where the wind reached 52 knots from NE. The storm was very concentrated and caused considerable damage 'W along its path, but apparently did not materially affect the 15 )md weather west of Ormara. 11—3rd week of June, 1902—a severe concentrated storm ote occurred.

CLIMATE AND WEATHER.—Persian gulf. —The climate of it W ard, the Persian gulf is one of the most trying imaginable, though 50 S q Ua lls perhaps on the whole not unhealthy for Europeans. The intense heat of the summer is aggravated by the humidity of the atmosphere,* ^ The packing of chronometer boxes requires frequent examination to ffiOVefl see that it is free from damp and mildew ; tarred oakum has been used for this ,fy low purpose with good effect.20 CLIMATE AND WEATHER [Chap. L and by the dust raised by every wind; nor are there rains or clouds to temper the excessive heat. With the exception of Kuwait town, the Arabian coast is hotter and less healthy than the Persian, and the heat is greater at the 5 southern end of the Gulf than at the head. In winter the winds are cold and cutting, but although the temperature is then more agreeable and apparently better suited to Europeans, experience shows it to be not the most healthy season. The following is a general summary;— 10 January and February. —Cold and boisterous. Gales prevail, with rain and bad weather. Frequently the bad weather starts about the beginning, but occasionally not until near the end of January. The lowest temperature of the year occurs in the first half of February. 15 March. —Generally fine and clear, with variable winds and pleasant temperature. The natives consider the bad weather over in the southern parts of the Gulf after the middle of the month. Intervals of variable winds and fine weather are frequent, though it is sometimes unsettled. 20 April. —Pleasant, getting hot towards the end. Generally fine, with occasionally a moderate shamal. Sometimes an easterly gale, a strong shamal, or a heavy squall, in the northern part. Variable winds, however, prevail, sometimes with rain. There is seldom any bad weather after the middle of the month. 25 May. —Getting hot, but generally fine; a moderate shamal of frequent occurrence; heavy squalls have been experienced, but are exceptional. June and July. —Until the middle of July, the heat at the head of the Gulf is moderated by the almost constant shamal, the air 30 being usually laden with dust; but from that time the heat is most intense, and with a southerly wind, almost insupportable, from the increase of humidity. August. —Heat most intense, the black bulb thermometer rising on shore to 159° Fahrenheit in the sun. In the shade, on board 35 ship, the range is small; at Bushire, from 90° to 93° at 0400 to 96° or 98° in the afternoon. At Basidu it is rather higher. In the Shatt al 'Arab the thermometer is stated to have risen to 124° in the shade. The great heat at night renders the weather the more distressing. 40 September.—Bni little cooler than August; the nights, however, are less oppressive, particularly towards the end of the month. The heat is said to be necessary for the maturing of the date crop. October. —Though still hot, the weather is more bearable; towards the end, the squalls, which usually occur, reduce the temperature 45 considerably. November. —Generally fine; atmosphere often very clear; tempera ture pleasant. December. —Often fine, cool, and pleasant before the bad weather, which seldom begins until the middle of the month, or more fre- 50 quently later. Makran coast.— The climate of the Makran coast is intermediate between those of the Persian gulf and India, and it differs considerably in the eastern and western portions. Although northward of the limits of the monsoons of the Arabian sea, it is usual to speak of 55 the south-west monsoon on this coast, because its effects are felt in many ways, thus:—the heavy monsoon swell rolls up from JuneChap. I.] CLIMATE AND WEATHER 21 to September, when humid cloudy weather prevails with occasional westerly winds, and rain in the eastern districts; the reduction of the temperature in the eastern part, while in the western part, cut off by Arabia from its influence, the heat approaches that of the Persian gulf. 5 The weather, which as a whole is singularly fine and safe for navigation, may be summarised as follows: January. Strong north-easters or land winds; also squally, north-east to south-east winds, with some rain; sea breezes, if an y. light. Sometimes a strong shamal; atmosphere dry; winds 10 cold and cutting; clouds of dust accompany and at times precede the strong winds; weather fine, but sometimes gloomy and overcast. February. Land breezes moderate, with light sea breezes, or a moderate shamdl; usually one strong shamal during the month. Sometimes squally with rain from eastward, shifting to westward 15 at Cape Jask, otherwise fine dry weather. March. —'Land breezes failing; weather generally fine but getting humid; sea breezes light to moderate, south-west, veering to west- north-west or north-west at night; also strong, or a shamdl, with much dust. Occasional calms chiefly in the forenoon; weather 20 settled and fine. April. —Very fine but hazy; air much warmer but very humid; sea breezes north-west to south-west, occasionally fresh, and, towards the end of the month, strong. Sea smooth, sometimes hot winds off the land. 25 May. —Calm in the morning, with strong sea breezes; hot, very humid, hazy, and with clouds passing rapidly eastward. Generally fine, and sea smooth, excepting the swell due to the sea breezes. Heavy squalls from west-north-west, with rain, have occurred. Near Cape Jask, light breezes from south-east to south-west, with SO an occasional shamal. June. —Similar to May, with probably a few days of light airs or hot scorching winds from the land, rendering the heat very oppressive, until about the middle or latter part of the month, when the monsoon, preceded by a falling barometer and threatening 35 weather, usually sets in, on the eastern part of the coast, as a strong west-south-westerly wind or moderate gale; this may last from a few days to a fortnight, and is preceded or accompanied by a heavy swell, out of proportion to the amount of wind. The weather then becomes cooler, the clouds and scud pass eastward, and the humidity iO continues. On the western part, light south-east and southerly winds prevail, varied by strong westerly breezes, with dust and a high temperature. July. —The first burst of the south-west monsoon is often followed by less boisterous winds; when the monsoon does not set in until 45 this month, it is preceded by very hot unpleasant weather. Soon after the middle of the month, there is an interval of light winds, after which the rain of this season occurs; it usually begins between the 15th July and 10th August with a squall, thunder, and lightning from the north-east, followed by a strong westerly wind. Lightning 50 in the evening to the north-east is a good indication of rain at this season. On the western part of the coast, the heat is excessive in July, and so continues until the end of September; light southerly to south-easterly winds prevail, with an occasional fresh hot west- 55 north-westerly wind.22 CLIMATE AND WEATHER [Chap. I. August. —Much cooler; air clearer and drier after the rain; monsoon breeze and swell moderate or light, and the wind more westerly at night. Sometimes heavy weather and rain occur. Native craft go to sea again early in the month. On the western 5 part of the coast, the weather is the same as in July. September. —The south-west monsoon usually ends about the beginning of this month; light winds, with a decreasing swell, but at times strong west-south-westerly winds, with a heavy swell, continue up to the middle or latter part of the month. Light airs 10 and calms are common. On the western part of the coast, the temperature continues very hot, with light variable winds and an occasional fresh shamal. In 1872 there was an easterly gale, with rain, lasting a few hours; this is exceptional. October. —Fine, clear, and dry; light sea breezes, and calms; 15 land breezes usually very light, but occasionally fresh for a few hours. Sea smooth. November. —As in October; but sometimes about the middle of the month, squally from eastward, with unsettled weather and ground swell, probably due to bad weather to the south. 20 December. —Fine, with moderate land and sea breezes. The land breezes are often strong towards the end of the month, when a moderate gale from north-east to south-east, with rain, is frequent. A shamal occurs at times on the western part of the coast. The weather is usually clear, but the land is sometimes obscured by 25 dust. It is often exceptionally clear, and very cold after rain. Sea generally smooth. In December and January, the bad weather of the Persian gulf sometimes reaches Cape Jask, or still farther eastward. Temperature. —The average temperature for the whole year is 30 about 75° at the head of the Gulf, increasing southward to about 80° at Lingeh and decreasing slightly towards the eastern part of the Makran coast. The average for the year is about 82° at Muscat, where the temperature of the cooler part of the year is higher than in the other sections. The hottest period, in the Gulf, with an 35 average temperature of about 92°, is about August; but it tends to come earlier in the year on the coasts subject to the influence of the monsoon, which prevents any increase in temperature after June or July. Thus the hottest month is June, with 93° at Muscat and 87° at Pasni. The coolest month is January, with an average 40 temperature of 52° at Basra, increasing to over 60° in the southern part of the Gulf, and to 67 0 at Jask. On the Makran coast the average temperature in January is about 65°, and at Muscat 71°. Extreme temperatures. —The greatest range of extreme temperatures occurs near the head of the Gulf, where temperature is likely to fall 45 to about 40° each year, and to rise to about 110°. Occasionally tem peratures below the freezing point occur, the lowest recorded at Basra being 24°; the highest temperature recorded there is 122°. In the northern part of the Gulf, generally, temperature may be expected to range from 50° to 105° in the course of the year, but a 50 range of 41° to 109° has been experienced at Lingeh. At Muscat the extreme range is from 49° to 116°, from Jask to Gwadar 41° to 114°, but at Pasni 31° to 115°. Temperature of the sea. —The conditions during summer in the Persian gulf are the more trying to those on board ship from the 55 excessively high temperature of the sea, which has been known toChap, I.] climate and weather 23 reach 98°, and is seldom below 90°. On board H.M.S. Sphinx in 1889 and 1896, between 0900 and 1500, the temperature of the ln J ^ u S us ^ was from 95° to 96°, and in July and September from 93 to 94°. In February the temperature of the sea is about 71° m the southern part of the Gulf and 65° in the northern. 5 , The temperature of the sea on the Makran coast varies from 71° in February to 84° in May. Humidity .—--In the greater part of the Persian gulf, the average relatrve humidity varies during the year from a maximum in the cold season to a minimum in the hot season. On coasts which are 10 subject to monsoon influence, the variation of relative humidity during the year is less simple, and there is a tendency for a maximum to occur also in August. From about Ormara eastward, however, there is a single maximum of humidity in the hot season, and a minimum in the cold season. Although the figures of relative 15 humidity given in the Tables in Appendix III may not appear unduly high, they must be considered in relation to the comparatively high temperature of the air. The temperature shown by a wet bulb thermometer gives a better measure of atmospheric conditions as affecting the human body. Thus, it is generally supposed that 20 climates with an average wet bulb temperature of over 70° for the year are unsuitable for permanent settlement by white races; when the wet^bulb stands at 85°, heat-stroke is likely to occur, and at 88°—90° in still air the ordinary cooling function of the body can no longer operate, even in the case of a man stripped to the waist. 25 Except at Bushire and Basra, the average wet bulb temperature for the year at coastal stations where observations have been taken is 71° or above; the average at Bushire in August is 80° and at Muscat 82°. Observations over the open sea have not been col lected to any great extent; but it may be mentioned that wet-bulb 30 readings of 85° to 88° were recorded on 10 successive days in August 1930 in a ship in the southern section of the Gulf. Even a light breeze is sufficient to mitigate the discomfort due to high wet bulb temperatures, and the importance of adequate ventilation for confined spaces should be borne in mind. 35 In the most extreme conditions of high temperature and humidity, however, an increase of wind velocity may be injurious. Thus, with a wet bulb temperature of 97° or 98° and a dry bulb exceeding 117°, it has been estimated that an increase of wind velocity above 22 knots would bring an amount of heat too great for the average 40 cooling power of the body to cope with, and the resulting increase in body temperature would be fatal. So long as conditions are such that body temperature is not increased, life is not necessarily impossible, but it has been stated that for each individual there may be a certain critical temperature above which he could not 45 live, and the temperature at which heat-stroke occurs varies with the state of health of the individual at the time. Rainfall. —The rainfall is small and variable; at Bushire, the mean annual fall is about 11 inches (279 mm ); totals of from 5 to 29 inches (127 nim to 737 mm ) in a year have been registered 50 but in the winter of 1931-32 the total amounted only to half an inch (12 mm ). At Muscat, the average fall is about 4 inches (102 mm ); from 3 to 8 inches (76 mm to 203 mm ) have been recorded, and on the 4th and 5th June, 1890, during the cyclone mentioned on page 18 it rained continuously for 24 hours, during which time 11^ inches 55 (292 mm ) of rain fell. With rare exceptions rain falls only in winter.24 CLIMATE AND WEATHER [Chap. I. On the shore of the southern bay of the Persian gulf, rain is said to fall very rarely. . . „ On the Makran coast; the rainfall is uncertain but small generally; sometimes there is hardly any rainfall for two or three years but 5 every now and then a large fall occurs during the year when that is so . the rain usually falls in such heavy downpours as to be hardly less destructive to cultivation than the long droughts; the rivers or watercourses at such times discharge an immense volume of water. From Karachi westward to Ormara, ram falls generally m July or 10 August; but little or none falls at this season on the western part of the Makran coast. Rain also falls in winter along the whole coast, usually in December or January, and sometimes m February; this rainfall is more abundant on the western part of the coast than near Karachi. The average at Karachi which is probably greater i5 than on the Makran coast, is between 7 and 8 inches (178 and 203nim^ Waterspouts at sea and sandspouts on land are frequent in the gulfs and along the Makran coast. D ew&lt; —xhe dew is very heavy in the Persian gulf, especially in summer, when, in the morning, it would appear as though there 20 had been a heavy shower of rain. ^ o x u j On the Makran coast dew is heavy from March to September, ana occasionally during the winter. . ^ pQg &lt; Dense fog is likely on about two occasions in the Persian gulf and once or twice along the Makran coast in January, in 25 February and March, it is likely once over the Gulf, and two or three times on the Makran coast. Morning fog is likely along the Makran coast on two or three days in September, four or five days in October, and two or three days in November. In December, fog occurs on two or three days in the western section of the Gulf. The fog is 50 often so dense as to wet objects like rain; the time of occurrence is usually in the morning, although occasions when it started much earlier are not unknown. The fog lasts for a few hours and usually the weather becomes clear by mid-day. Dust-storms occur about once in each month over the Persian gulf, 35 and occasionally over the Gulf of 'Oman and the Makran coast during the period January to April. Dust-storms, associated with high winds and poor visibility, occur most frequently during the months of May, June and July; three or four dust-storms may be expected on the Makran coast in May and about the same number 40 in June. In winter, after strong western disturbances and in the absence of recent rainfall, severe dust-storms or sand-storms may occur in the wake of the disturbance; these sometimes carry dust as far eastward as Karachi. Dust-haze with poor visibility is reported from 4 to 8 times from the Karachi—Jask section in May, 45 but in June and July it is more frequently reported from the Gulf stations, Bahrein reporting on 15 occasions in June and 10 occasions in July. The following account of a sand-storm experienced by H.M.S. Cyclamen at Henjam is of interest. At about 1630 on the 19th 50 September, 1925, the sky assumed a very threatening aspect, similar to heavy rain clouds, though of a lighter colour. At 1705, the storm broke quite suddenly, the wind changing from a light southerly breeze, force 1, to a force of from 5 to 6 from eastward. The air at once became thick with sand and the visibility closed in rapidly to about 55 150 yards (137 m 2). The storm lasted at this force for about 15 minutes, and then the visibility became greater and the wind de-Chap. I.] climate and weather 25 creased, though there were still occasional squalls. By 1815, the wind had dropped to force 3, and the visibility cleared to about one mile. At 1900, the wind dropped, and then blew from westward. After this storm, the air became drier, and at midnight the wet and dry bulb thermometers differed by 8°, as compared with 2° or 3° 5 before the storm. During the evening, very vivid lightning was observed. This storm took place one day after the new moon, and the natives stated that it marked the end of the hot weather for the year. Visibility in the various months*; io January. Visibility generally good except during showers and dust-storms. February. —Generally similar to January. March.~Eax\y mornings, for an hour before and after sunrise, are sometimes foggy or misty from the Gulf of 'Oman to Karachi; 15 but only from two to four mornings with thick fog are reported. Towards the latter part of the month dust begins to be blown about by moderately strong winds during the day, and visibility is only fair to good in general over the Makran coast and the Arabian side of the Persian gulf; over the Persian side of the latter, however, 20 it is good. April. Except in occasional years, visibility is only fair to good on account of dust-haze which usually lasts a few days even after the subsidence of the strong winds associated with dust-storms. May .—Visibility is decidedly the worst over the Makran coast 25 and is slightly worse than in April over the Gulf; dust-haze occurs on from 2 to 5 days over the Gulf, and on from 6 to 10 days over the eastern part of the Makran coast; morning fog may also occur on 2 days. June. —Poggy weather, apparently due to salt-haze, occasionally 30 occurs over the Gulf and, unlike winter fogs, lasts many hours; occasionally it has been known to last till the afternoon. There is also a marked deterioration of visibility over the whole section, due to dust in the atmosphere. Visibility is therefore fair to poor, and on a few occasions it is bad. 35 July. —Misty and hazy conditions prevail over the coastal areas in the early mornings, and the visibility conditions are almost similar to June; but the atmosphere begins to get clearer between Karachi and Gwadar, where visibility is generally fair. August. —Visibility conditions distinctly improve. Except over 40 the Arabian side of the Gulf, where some haze persists, the visibility is everywhere fair to good; only from 1 to 3 days of poor visibility may occur over the Gulf. September. —The dust-haze conditions are less marked, but morning fog occurs on from about 1 to 3 days, lasting for short periods. 45 Visibility is good on from 60 to 90 per cent, of occasions. October. —Visibility is good, except towards early morning and late in the evening, when a certain amount of haze towards the sea decreases visibility somewhat. Over the Makran coast, morning fog may occur on 6 days, elsewhere on 2 days on an average. 50 November. —Visibility is almost invariably good. Fog is some times encountered over the Makran coast in the morning. December. —'Visibility is good, except during rain and morning fog, which latter occasionally occurs near the head of the Persian gulf. ♦Based on information in ' Meteorology of the Persian Gulf and Mekran,' by Dr. B. N. Banerji.26 CURRENTS [Chap. I. Charts 2939—2950. CURRENTS—TIDES—TIDAL STREAMS.— The informa tion available on these subjects is meagre. It would appear that the surface drift, due to the winds, is sometimes so great that the 5 tidal stream, when opposed to it, fails to overcome it, and the resultant stream continues in one direction, merely changing in velocity. See also remarks on currents, page 296. In the summer, the south-west monsoon of the Indian ocean is said to drive the water into the Persian gulf, and to raise the general 20 level by about one foot (0 m 3). The swell of the south-west monsoon rolls round Ras al Hadd, and is felt off Muscat, and even near the entrance of the Persian gulf, though there only slightly. Sometimes there is a heavy swell in the entrance of the Persian gulf for several hours, without any 15 wind either preceding or following it; such a swell is usually, however, the forerunner of a gale. From June to September, a heavy swell, caused by the south west monsoon, rolls in on the Makran coast. The swell comes from west-south-west or south-west at Karachi, from south-south-west 20 at Gwadar, from about south at Chahbar, and from south-east at Cape Jask. It decreases gradually from Gwadar to Cape Jask, at which latter it is a light ground swell. The swell is usually much heavier than that which would be due to the strength of the wind on the coast, but it varies much, and during a break in the 25 monsoon is often light; sometimes it disappears in early September, at other times it continues heavy during the greater part of that month, though by the end it has always ceased. On the occurrence of a cyclone or storm in the Arabian sea, con siderable swell rolls up from the south, or a heavy ground swell with 30 surf on the coast may be experienced. In the Persian gulf, the sea gets up quickly, and is short and hollow. At the entrance, when the tidal stream opposes strongly a heavy shamal, it is particularly distressing, breaking very heavily; it is often out of all proportion to the amount of wind, but quickly 35 subsides after a gale. During a heavy shamal, there is a very high sea off Muscat, and also on the Makran coast. Currents. —Along the south-western shore of the Gulf of 'Oman, there is, usually, during the south-west monsoon, a north-westerly current, which attains a rate of from 10 to 35 miles a day. From October to February, when the shamal prevails in the Gulf, the current usually sets south-eastward; between Muscat and Ras al Hadd, it attains a rate of from 10 to 45 miles a day. On the Makran coast, the currents depend on the prevailing winds, and, though variable in strength, are least irregular during the 45 south-west monsoon, when they usually set eastward along the coast, at a rate of from 10 to 30 miles a day. During the north east monsoon, and in the periods between the monsoons, the current is quite uncertain, though it sometimes sets westward, at a rate of from 10 to 35 miles a day. 50 At the south-eastern end of the Persian gulf, observations con tinued for eight days during April, 1930, showed a current running into the Gulf, at an average rate of 6 miles a day. It is probable that this rate is considerably increased in summer, when evaporation is greatest and south-easterly winds occur, and that the rate is 65 very small, or the direction of the current reversed, in winter, whenChap. I.] TIDES—TIDAL STREAMS—SIGNALS 27 evaporation is least and north-westerly winds prevail. See also page 296. Tides, —In the Persian gulf, great variations occur in the type of tide, and the information available is insufficient for any reliable general description to be given; tides of semi-diurnal type appear, 5 however, to be usual in the northern part of the Gulf, and tides of diurnal type, in the southern part. Times and heights of high water at the more important ports and anchorages may be obtained from the information given in the Admiralty Tide Tables. Tidal streams. —On the southern part of the south-western lO side of the Gulf of 'Oman, the tidal streams are almost imperceptible. On the Makran coast, from Karachi to Gwatar, the tidal stream sets eastward during the rising, and westward during the falling tide; but westward of Gwatar bay it sets westward during the rising, 15 and eastward during the falling tide. In the northern part of the Gulf of 'Oman, the general set of the stream is north-north-westward and south-south-eastward. The north-north-west-going stream attains a rate of from half a knot to 2 knots, and is strongest on the western side, as Ras Musandam 20 is approached. The south-south-east-going stream attains a rate of from one to If knots. In the Persian gulf, the tidal streams are subject to great variation in type, semi-diurnal streams occurring in some parts, and diurnal streams in others. The type of stream in any locality is not 25 necessarily the same as the type of tide, and diurnal streams may occur where the tide is semi-diurnal, and vice-versa. For this reason, the time of the turn of the stream, and its rate, in any locality, bear no fixed relation to the tide in that locality. See also pages 292 to 296, 30 Information available regarding the streams depends, generally, on a few hours' observations only, and conclusions drawn by the observers, though correct at the time, may be quite erroneous during other astronomical conditions. Information regarding tidal streams, given on the charts, must therefore be regarded as unreliable, and 35 used with caution. Northward of Ras al Kuh, the streams become very strong, and they attain their greatest rate, of about 4 knots and probably more at springs, at Ras Musandam, where eddies and races are formed near that point and between it and the Salamah wa Binat-ha islets, 40 On the eastern shore of the entrance of the Gulf, the rate of the streams is less, and is perhaps from 2 to 3 knots off Girau.

I. 6. A white flare from which, at intervals of about three seconds, a white light is ejected into the air. If for some urgent reason, such as another aircraft in distress, any British aircraft wishes to communicate with a Merchant vessel, 5 she will fly low round the ship, and fire a succession of green Very's lights to attract attention. The aircraft will then signal her require ments by visual. If the aircraft is not fitted for visual signalling, she will, as soon as she has attracted attention, proceed towards the object she wishes 10 to point out. This means of communication will only be used as a distress signal, and Merchant ships should therefore make every effort to read any signal made from an aircraft flying low round the ship. British aircraft have been instructed not to fly low round ships, 15 unless for the purpose of passing such a signal. These signals are also made by French and Belgian aircraft in similar circumstances. Note. —The above signals are subject to such modifications as shall be published from time to time. 20 COMMUNICATIONS.—Land. —In Arabia, there are no proper roads; but the advent of the motor car is changing this state of affairs rapidly. This applies especially to Bahrein and Kuwait where many local roads are being built. At Muscat a motor road runs to Matrah, and a good motor road exists between Kuwait town 25 and Basra. Cars now (1932) run over every part of the country, except the Rub al thali, the great desert in the south-eastern part of Arabia; but, as conditions are often unsettled, travelling, without an armed escort, is dangerous. In 'Iraq, a railway runs from Basra to Baghdad, with extensions .30 to Baiji, Kirkuk, and Khaniqin. There are now some 4,500 miles of road in the country, and the motor car and motor lorry is fast superceding the ancient caravan, though the road surface leaves much to be desired. In Persia, there are a number of main roads available to motor 35 traffic, but only at Bushire and Bandar 'Abbas do they reach the southern coast. Animal transport has already been almost com pletely swept off the main roads by motor transport, pack animals being only used on such roads when certain sections are rendered impassable to mechanical transport by floods, rain, or snow. Even 40 in the outlying districts of eastern and south-eastern Persia, motor transport is being used on the secondary roads. A north to south railway, from Bandar Shah, in the south-eastern corner of the Caspian sea, to Bandar Shapur, in Khor Musa at the head of the Persian gulf, is projected, and work has been commenced at 45 either end; the line will pass through Tehran, the capital, see page 251.

The following cables are operated in the area covered by this work:— Karachi Jask; Jask—Chahbar; Jask—Muscat; Jask—Henjam-5&lt;? Jask—Bushire; Hen jam—Bushire; and Bushire—Fao. There is a land-line to India along the Makran coast and messages are received at the stations at Ormara, Pasni, Gwadar, Chahbar, and Jask. A light is shown at the telegraph stations when a vessel is expected, or an answering blue light is exhibited if signals are 35 observed. In addition, there are internal telegraph systems in 'Iraq and Persia, and communication is maintained between Kuwait and Basra. The cables and land-lines are connected to the universal telegraph io system. W/T.— The following W/T stations for general public corres pondence are established in the area covered by this work. For details, see the 'List published by the International Bureau of the Telegraph Union.' Henjam; Bahrein; Bushire; and Basra. Those stations which transmit messages concerning weather and navigation, details of which may be found in the 'Admiralty List of Wireless Signals', are as follows:— Weather Bulletins. —Baghdad. 50 Navigational Warnings. —Basra. Time Signals. —Basra. §A/o/e.—The Junkers Company's services are (1932) indefinitely suspended.30 MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION [Chap. I. Signal stations. —Signal stations, at which reports can be trans mitted through Lloyd's, are established at Jask, and Henjam, and are controlled by the Imperial and International Communications Ltd., Karachi. 5 Vessels can communicate with these stations by means of the International code; no lookout, however, is kept, and vessels desiring to communicate must first attract attention. MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION.—Pilots.— In the Persian gulf, generally, pilots are now seldom employed, especially as 10 the men offering their services usually possess local knowledge only; it should be borne in mind that pilots taken on board for the Arab coast are only to be depended on for certain localities. For pilots for particular places, such as the Shatt al 'Arab and Bahrein, etc., see the body of this work. 15 Deratisation. —In accordance with Article 28 of the International Sanitary Convention of 21st June, 1926, Deratisation can be carried out and Deratisation and Deratisation Exemption certificates can be issued to vessels at the following place within the limits of this work:—Basra. .20 Native craft— Part of the trade between the Persian gulf and India, the Red sea, and the East coast of Africa, is carried on in native vessels called by the Arabs hdgala and hum, similar Indian- built vessels being called kutiyah and dangiyah, respectively. The bagala and dangiyah are clumsily rigged vessels, of from 25 100 to 400 tons, with a huge mainmast and lateen sail, and a small lateen mizen. They sail well in moderate winds; but do not go to sea in the south-west monsoon. The halam is a somewhat similar craft, though smaller. The smaller vessels used in the pearl fishery and for the coasting 30 trade, of from 10 to 120 tons, are called sambuq, shu'ai, jalibut, mashuwah, batil, and bdkara; they are all rigged similarly to the bagala, except that they do not have the mizen and smaller lateen sail. The sambuq is pre-eminently the pearling boat of Kuwait and Bahrein, though the jalibut and mashuwah are also commonly .35 used as such. The term dhow is unknown to the natives of the Persian gulf littoral; but is used by Europeans to denote any native craft. The etymology of the word is dubious. Piracy.—European vessels within the Persian gulf or Gulf of 40 'Oman need not apprehend piracy. Piracies on native boats, however, occasionally occur in the Gulf. Obtaining information .—It is most difficult to get trustworthy information from the Arabs, and but little that they impart can be relied upon. 45 Presents. —A vessel anchoring off a town in Arabia is besieged for medical aid; strong aperients, opium, mercury, eye medicines, caustic for sores, and lint are the articles usually asked for. The most acceptable presents for any services rendered are lead, cutlery, small telescopes, cloth, looking-glasses, coloured silk handkerchiefs, 50 watches and, of course, money. Coal. —Coal can be obtained at Muscat, Henjam, and Basra. Fuel oil. —Fuel oil can be obtained at Abadan, and Basra. Docks. —For particulars, see page 280.Chap. I.] , passages 31 Repairs .—Repairs, not necessitating docking, can be effected at Basra, where also the services of divers are available. ^r. tandar 1 d rim J e -~ The standard tim e kept in 'Iraq is that of the 45th meridian of East longitude, or 3 hours fast on Greenwich mean time, 5 p A SSAGE S —For information concerning passages to and from the Persian gulf and the Gulf of 'Oman, the mariner is referred to the work entitled Ocean Passages', published by the Hydrographic Department of the Admiralty. ^ 5 f ^ In the area covered by this work, steam vessels may steer useful m P01nt t0 P oint ' but the following information may be ^keu navigating up or down the Gulf vessels should keep alon^ the Persian coast; when visiting the Arabian coast, vessels should always anchor at dusk, if possible. 15 •cTi! 6 ^ U! i r ? eroU j ^ s ^ ands anc i strong tidal streams near the entrance of the Gulf, and the frequency of bad weather, necessitate caution, btrong breezes set in and sudden shifts of wind occur with but little or no warning. During a shamal, especially in summer, and also while the nashi 20 is blowing m the southern part of the Gulf in winter, the very hazy state of the atmosphere so completely obscures the land that the surf on the beach may be the first intimation of its proximity. Approaching the Gulf. —When bound up the Gulf, calling at Muscat, it is usual to make the Arabian coast, which in the fine 25 season^s generally visible from a great distance, especially at sunset. 1 he mgh land between Ras Abu Dawud and Sur is first seen, and the Devil s gap may be identified. During the south-west monsoon, vessels should pass some 3 miles off Ras al Hadd; the high land will probably not be visible until 30 ' or Ra-lhat, and, owing to the haze, may not be seen at all if far offshore., except about sunset when it often shows up. Muscat to the entrance of the Gulf. —From Muscat vessels should steer to pass Ras al Kuh and the Salamah wa Binat-ha islets at a con venient distance. With a shamal, to avoid the lee current and 35 heavier swell on the Arabian coast, it is best to keep over towards the Persian coast. The Persian coast is fairly steep-to and safe of approach eastward of Cape Jask, but it is low, and the hills are a considerable distance inland; it should, therefore, be given a good berth at night. From 40 Jask, the coast continues low northward to Jezirat Hormuz, and the hills in the background render it difficult to judge the distance offshore. Soundings are but little guide. The tidal streams on the Arabian coast, northward of Jezirat Limah, are very strong, especially northward of Jezirat Umm al ^5 Fayarin, and the depths are too great for anchoring. The entrance of the Gulf to Jezirat Tunb. —From Ras al Kiih to Jezi'rat Henjam, the tidal streams become strong across the entrance. On passing Salamah wa Binat-ha, vessels should guard against the north-going stream, 50 The shamal, in this part of the Persian gulf, blows from west- south-west to south-west, and the lee shore must not be closely approached. There is sheltered anchorage northward of Tezfrat Hormuz, or Qishm town. The flat off the south-western end of Qishm island requires caution 5532 PASSAGES [Chap. I. when approaching it; discoloured water marks its edge, and fishing boats often anchor there. Jezirat Tunb to Jezirat Qais. —Vessels may pass on either side of Coote rock, Jezirat Tunb, and Jezirat Nabiyu Tunb. Jezirat 5 Farur, which shows well at night unless the weather is hazy, and Jezirat Qais may be passed close-to. In a shamal there is less sea near the Persian coast than at a distance off it. Vessels should guard against a northerly set which is sometimes 10 experienced in the area between Jezirat Tunb and Sheikh Shu'aib. During a shamal, the extreme haziness of the air renders the greatest caution necessary in making or passing any of the islands, sounding affording no guide. Jezirat Fariir is the easiest to see, it being dark coloured, high, and steep-to, with the exception of a 15 small ledge on its western side. Shelter can be obtained during a kaus either in Charak or Mughu bays, but it is necessary to anchor well in, where there is shelter in a shamal, or everything must be ready to weigh and quit. Between Lingeh and the Basidu flat there is not much sea in easterly 20 winds. Jezirat Qais to Ras al Mutaf. —Vessels should pass southward of Jezair Hindarabi and Sheikh Shu'aib, and then south-westward of Ras al Mutaf; the mud-coloured water on the shoal extends some miles outside it, and is a good indication of.its vicinity by day. 25 In thick weather, or at night, a depth of 15 fathoms (27 m 4) leads about 10 miles south-westward of Ras al Mutaf, but caution is necessary, for if set north-eastward, the course would lead from depths of 30 to 40 fathoms (54 m 9 to 13 m 2), through 15 fathoms (27 m 4), directly on to the shoal. 30 From Jezirat Qais to Ras al Mutaf the smoothest water is inside the islands, and this route can be taken in daylight. The channel between Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib and the mainland, where there is anchoring ground, is clear, but neither the sandy shoal off the low eastern point, nor the western end of the island, 35 should be approached closely. Shelter from the shamal can be obtained in Chiru bay, off the eastern end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib, off Shivuh, and under Ras al Mutaf shoal. Naband bay affords shelter from a kaus, but, if followed by a 40 shamal, a heavy sea would set in. Nakhilu bay is the best anchor age in a kaus. Soundings afford no guide in passing Jezair Qais, Hindarabi and Sheikh Shu'aib, they being steep-to. Ras al Mutaf. —From about 10 miles south-westward of Nakhilu, 45 an islet 11 miles north-westward of Ras al Mutaf, vessels should steer for a position about 6 miles south-westward of Rishahr point. This track leads along, and from 6 to 10 miles off the coast, in general depths of from 12 to 22 fathoms (21 m 9 to 40 in 2). The coast near Ras al Khan, 15 miles north-north-westward of Nakhilu, is very 50 low, but the mountains, about 4 miles inland, and extending some 40 miles northward from a position about 9 miles northward of Ras al Khan, are conspicuous. If bound for Bushire harbour vessels should make Rishahr point, off which the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line is 4 miles distant, and then 55 cautiously approach the coast into a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0),Chap.

Chart 10c. COAST OF 'OMAN.—Ras al Hadd.— This cape, the southern most point at the entrance of the Gulf of Oman, is not easily identified for it is low and sandy as is the coast for about 3 miles southward 5 and 2 miles westward of it. Farther southward, for a distance of about 4 miles, or as far as Ras al Junaiz [see Red Sea and Gulf of Aden pilot), and farther westward for about 12 miles, or as far as Sur the coast of 'Oman is composed of low cliffs. Al Hadd [Lat. 22° 32' N., Long. 59° 48' E.), is a village 10 consisting chiefly of mat huts erected round a fort with three round towers, situated about one mile south-westward of the extremity of the cape; in the vicinity are a few date trees, and a fourth round tower, which in 1928 was partly in ruins, stands detached on the northern shore of Khor al Hajar, westward of the town. 15 Depths offshore. —A bank, over which the depths are less than 100 fathoms (182 m 9), extends from 2 to 4 miles eastward of the coast between Ras al Junaiz and Ras al Hadd, the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lying about one mile offshore. This bank is famous for large fish. Northward of Ras al Hadd there are great depths at a distance 20 of about half a mile offshore. Ras ash Shajar is situated about 40 miles north -westward of Ras al Hadd and between them there is no known off-lying shoal. Westward of Ras al Hadd, the 100- fathom (182 m 9) line lies about 3 miles offshore, but in the neighbour hood of Sur it closes the coast to a distance of about one mile, whence 25 to Kuryat as Saghirah, nearly 50 miles north -westward, it lies from one to 3 miles from the coast. In 1885, H .M .S. Ranger obtained a sounding of 55 fathoms (i00 m b), sand and rock, in a position about 18 miles south-eastward of Ras al Hadd, but the same vessel was unsuccessful when searching for 30 this bank on a subsequent occasion. Currents. —Off Ras al Hadd, the currents are strong, variable, and much influenced by the prevailing winds. From April to August inclusive, the current usually sets northward along the Arabian coast southward of Ras al Hadd, and north-westward 35 along the coast forming the southern shore of the Gulf of 'Oman; the rate of this current varies from 10 to 45 miles a day. In September, the current continues to set northward at the same rate Charts 38, 1012, 748b.Chap. II.] COAST OF 'OMAN 35 Chart 10c. along the coast southward of Ras al Hadd, but northward of that cape it is variable. In October, the current is still variable along the coast forming the southern shore of the Gulf of 'Oman, though usually it sets south-eastward at a rate of from 10 to 2o'miles a 5 day; along the coast southward of Ras al Hadd it sets southward. In November and December, the current sets south-eastward along the southern shore of the Gulf of 'Oman from the vicinity of the Daimaniyat islands, situated about 125 miles north-westward of Ras al Hadd, to the latter cape, the rate varying from 10 to 45 miles 10 a day; southward of Ras al Hadd, it sets southward or south-westward at a rate of from 10 to 30 miles a day. In January, the current sets south-eastward along the southern shore of the Gulf of 'Oman at a rate of from 15 to 30 miles a day; but in February and March it is variable. js Sometimes, usually towards the end of the south-west monsoon, while the current sets northward along the coast southward of Ras al Hadd, it sets south-eastward along the coast from Ras Abu Dawud, situated about 68 miles north-westward of Ras al Hadd, to the latter cape, off which the two currents appear to combine and flow north- 20 eastward at a rate of about 2 knots, the rate being further increased on the east-going tidal stream. Owing to this current, vessels lying to at night off Ras al Hadd have found themselves out of sight of land when day broke on the following morning. See monthly current charts, Indian ocean, 2939-2950. 25 Anchorage. —At a distance of from 5 to 8 cables offshore, anchorage may be obtained in depths of from 8 to 10 fathoms (14 m 6 to 18 m 3), coral, with the town of Al Hadd bearing about 270°; but it is exposed, and the depths decrease rapidly within the 10-fathom {18 m 3) line. 30 During the south-west monsoon, better anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of about 12 fathoms (21 m 9), at a distance of about one- quarter of a mile offshore, between the entrances of Kh5r al Hajar and Khor al Jaramah, situated, respectively, about 2^ and 4 miles westward of Ras al Hadd; or off the entrance of the latter kh5r in 35 from 10 to 12 fathoms (18 m 3 to 21 m 9), mud and sand, at a distance of about half a mile offshore. When at anchor off the coast, anywhere between Ras al Hadd and Sur, a vessel must always be prepared for a sudden shift of wind northward. 40 Khor al Hajar.—Tidal streams. —This small inlet affords shelter to fishing boats; within the entrance, which lies between two low cliffs and is about If cables wide, it trends southward for about half a mile and thence eastward for about one mile extending to a position close westward of Al Hadd. The depths in the entrance 45 are from 5 to 3^ fathoms (9 m l to 6 m 4), but within it soon shoals to 1^ fathoms (2 m 7) and its inner and larger part dries. The entrance is between Ras al Haiya {Lat. 22° 32' N., Long. 59° 48' E.), and Ras al Hamma, between which Jabal Sifdn may be seen in the background; these names are not shown on the chart, but see view 50 facing page 38. The tidal streams near the entrance of Kh5r al Hajar set eastward and westward; the east-going stream is weak, but the west-going stream attains a maximum velocity of about 1^ knots. Charts 38, 1012, 748h.3g APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 10c. plan of Khor Jarama. Khor al Jaramah.— Beacon.—This khor is a large shallow inlet with a tortuous entrance channel, which latter is about one mile in length and about three-quarters of a cable wide between 5 cliffs about 60 feet (18 m 3) high. _ ^ 13 T3 - A white cairn, 10 feet (3 m 0) in height, stands on Ras Bu Buraij the eastern entrance point of the kh5r. It is said to form a good landmark and to be visible at a distance of at least 6 miles Close southward of the point, portions of the cliff have fallen and, lying 10 near its foot, are covered at high water. • , , u ■, At the southern end of the entrance channel lies an islet, beyond which the khor expands into a large and shallow basin, surrounded for the most part by cliffs 100 to 200 feet (30^5 to 61^0) high, but having at its southern end a low sandy beach close off which is an 15 isolated black flat-topped hill which is conspicuous; on the beach are a few scattered trees. , ^ x . ... The kh5r affords excellent shelter, and though the turnings m the entrance channel are somewhat sharp it is accessible to steam vesse s drawing less than 15 feet (4^6). The inlet is used by native vessels 20 only as a harbour of refuge; there is no village on its shores and the water obtainable from the wells on its southern beach, though drinkable, is brackish. There is an abundance of fish in the khor and the seine may be hauled to advantage on its beaches. Between the entrance points, the depths are from 4 to 6 fathoms 25 (7 m 3 to U^O), soft sand; at about one-quarter of a mile withm the entrance, shoal ground, over which there is a depth of U fathoms (2 m 3) extends from the western shore, leaving between it and the eastern shore a channel only about 60 yards (54^9) wide, in which the least depth is 3| fathoms (6n 1 4). Southward of this shoal, and 30 through the channel eastward of the islet at the southern end of the entrance channel, a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) can be carried to the anchorage situated close southward of the islet. Directions.—Anchorage. —Good well-sheltered anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 3 to 4 fathoms {5 m 5 to 7^3) between 35 2 cables southward and about half a mile south-westward of the islet at the southern end of the entrance channel. Vessels entering the kh5r are advised to do so at the very first of the ebb tide, as at other times the tidal eddies in the bends of the channel render steering very difficult. The tidal streams through 40 the entrance attain a rate of about 2 knots, and in the channel flaws of wind are, of course, prevalent. The isolated hill on the southern side of the khor bearing 17b leads to the entrance. Vessels entering should give Ras Bu Buraij a sufficient berth to avoid the fallen portions of the cliff, and should 45 afterwards keep close to the eastern shore until past the shoal about one -quarter of a mile within the entrance; thence vessels should keep in mid-channel and, passing north-eastward of the islet at its southern end, should anchor in the area already indicated. Chart 10c. 50 Coast —From the entrance of Kh5r al Jaramah, the coast ot 'Oman trends westward to Ras Sharh and is composed of cliffs. Ras Sharh {Lat. 22° 34' N., Long. 59° 39' E.), is situated about 4£ miles westward of the entrance of Kh5r al Jaramah and is a slightly projecting point. Charts 38, 1012, 748b.Chap. II.] COAST OF 'OMAN 37 Chart 10c. From Ras Sharh to Sur, situated about 6 miles farther westward there is a ridge of low broken hills with cliffs in places. Chart 10c, plan of Sur anchorage. S ur ' Sur is the name usually given to a group of settlements 5 at the mouth of the Wadi Falaij which latter enters the sea, forming a narrow creek that affords shelter to small craft. With its abundant fertility, it stands out in marked contrast to the surrounding desert. Fort Sanaisalah, a large square building with towers, is situated near the coast about 2 miles north-westward of the mouth of the 10 creek^and is visible from seaward at a distance of about 10 miles. This fort and another, standing on higher ground about \\ miles west-south-westward, are surrounded by villages of considerable size. A large square tower, very conspicuous from seaward, stands on a mound about half a mile west-north-westward of Ras Jimeleh, 15 the western entrance point of the inlet. The ruined tower, shown on the plan on chart 10c, about half a cable southward of the square tower, south-westward of the observation spot, is most inconspicuous and consists of nothing more than a heap of loose stones. There is, however, a very conspicuous ruined tower, resembling a broken 20 tooth, about half a mile south-south-westward of it that may easily be mistaken for it when bearing between 190° and 220°. The towers, shown on the plan on chart 10c, eastward of the eastern town, are conspicuous, though in a dilapidated condition. Jabal Khamis, about 2,700 feet (823 m 0) high and situated about 25 8 miles inland, bearing 212° leads to the anchorage off Sur, close eastward of which place the 100-fathom (182m9) line is only about one mile offshore. Jabal Jaalan, see Red Sea and Gulf of Aden Pilot, rises to an elevation of about 3,900 feet (1188 m 7) about 15^ miles south-south-westward of Jabal Khamis [Lat. 22° 27' NLong. 30 59° 27' E.) and is conspicuous when clear of that mountain. See views facing page 38, and on chart 38. The creek at Sur is extensive but dries almost entirely at low water; the depth on the bar at the entrance is about 18 inches (0 m 4). Muqraimatain, the largest settlement, is situated on the western 35 side, and 'Aiqa, on the eastern side, of the mouth of the inlet. The houses in both quarters are mostly of mud and stone with stuccoed roofs, but there is also a proportion of huts. The inhabitants of the two quarters are members of different tribes, and are continually at feud, so that personal security does 40 not exist, A1 Heis and Bildad are not shown on the chart; the former is an inland fort which is not visible from seaward; it commands the wells and is also a customs station. Fresh water for the supply of Sur is transported in skins from Bildad, situated about 3 miles inland, 45 and from other inland places. A supply of water sufficient for a ship for drinking purposes could probably be obtained. The people of Sur possess a number of boats and the fishing appears to be of importance. The country inland is partly cultivated and there are many date groves. The exports from Sur consist of dried 50 dates and salted fish. There is no bazaar; trade is carried on in the compounds of the houses, which are strongly built and protected. Anchorage.—Landing. —'Open anchorage may be obtained off Sur in depths of from 8 to 11 fathoms (14 m 6 to 20 m l), sand, with Charts 38, 1012, 748b.38 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 10c, plan of Sur anchorage. the eastern entrance point of the inlet bearing 178°, distant 6 cables. There is a suitable landing place for boats on the southern side 5 of Ras Jimeleh, near the observation spot {Lat. 22° 35' N., Long. 59° 33' E.). At high water, a ship's motor-boat can go along side a protecting ledge of rock, but at low water it is necessary to land in a skiff. Chart 10c. 10 Coast.—From Sur, the coast of 'Oman trends north-westward for about 29 miles to Ras ash Shajar, and consists generally of low cliffs; after the first 3 miles, the land rises to the precipitous Jabal Bani Jabir, of which Jabal Kalhat is the south-eastern end. These mountains are of regular outline and about 4,500 feet (1371 m 6) 15 in elevation; behind them is a higher range, probably over 6,000 feet (1828 m 8) in height. North-westward of Ras ash Shajar the coastal mountains recede inland and end at the Devil's gap, see page 39. Kalhat.—Anchorage. —This small village is situated at the 20 entrance of a gorge about 11 miles north-westward of Sur. Its position may usually be identified by a peak in the coastal range about one mile south-eastward of it, see view facing page 39. It is reported that small craft can obtain shelter from northerly winds quite close inshore under a small projecting point. There are 25 some wells containing good water, and bullocks, sheep, poultry, and vegetables might be obtained in small quantities at this and the other villages mentioned on this coast. At the village is one conspicuous tower and two smaller ones. Landing may be effected on a shingle beach about half a mile 30 southward of the tower erected on a spit. Anchorage was obtained by H.M.S. Cyclamen, in 1925, off the southern side of the spit in a depth of 17 fathoms (31 m l), about 3| cables offshore eastward of the village. From this position, the depths rapidly increase seaward to over 40 fathoms (73 ni 2) and 35 shoal as rapidly towards the coast. The vicinity of the spit should be avoided as foul ground appears to extend some distance from it. Coast.—Anchorages .—At Haiwa, situated about 61 miles north-westward of Kalhat, there is an anchorage, but the place is uninhabited. 40 Tiwi, situated about 3J miles north-westward of Haiwa is a large village with a date grove and a lagoon of fresh water about 2 cables inland. It is situated at the entrance of a gorge and may thus easily be mistaken for Kalhat. There are many fruit trees in the neigh bourhood and a few sheep and goats could be procured. Off the village 45 the 100-fathom (182^9) line lies within cables of the coast. In 1884, H.M.S. Dragon anchored close to the beach northward of a small spit in a depth of 9 fathoms (16^5). Shab, situated about 1^ miles north-westward of Tiwi, is a small village with a tower on a little hill at the mouth of a deep gorge 50 .m the mountains. A fine stream of excellent fresh water flows rom the gorge and forms a lagoon within one-quarter of a cable of tne sea, which is convenient for vessels watering. Anchorage may be obtained off Shab, in depths of from 20 to 30 fathoms (36 m 6 to 54 m 9), at a distance of from 3 to 4 cables offshore; Charts 38, 748b.Chap. II.] COAST OF 'OMAN 39 Chart 10c. but vessels should be prepared to leave it on the approach of a shamal. Makalla Wabar, not shown on the chart but situated between Shab and Ras ash Shajar, is an anchorage where small craft may 5 obtain shelter from the shamal. Fins is a small village between Makalla Wabar and Ras ash Shajar; like others at the foot of these mountains, it has good water, fruit trees, &amp;c. Ras ash Shajar.—Shoal. —This cape is low, sandy, and well 10 defined only when close-to, but a solitary tree, standing about half a mile southward of it, is conspicuous and assists in identifying the locality. For a distance of about 3| miles on either side of the cape, the mountains recede from the coast. During a shamdl, native craft anchor, very close in, south-eastward of the cape. 15 A shoal bank, on which the British barque Marian Moore was wrecked in 1879, extends offshore for a distance of about three- quarters of a mile from Ras ash Shajar {Lat. 22° 56' NLong. 59° IS' E.); in the same year H.M.S. Teazer anchored on this bank in a depth of about 5f fathoms (10 m 5), rock and sand, at* a 20 distance of about 4 cables offshore with Ras ash Shajar bearing 308° and Fins tower, situated about 1^ miles southward, bearing 175°. Coast.—Aspect. —'From Ras ash Shajar, the coast trends north westward for a distance of about 28 miles to Ras Abu Dawud; for about the first 18 miles it consists of low cliffs, but thence becomes 25 low and sandy until within about 2 miles of Ras Abu Dawud, where it is rocky. At about 10 miles north-westward of Ras ash Shajar, Jabal Bani Jabir, see page 38, recedes from the coast in a west-north westerly direction and terminates abruptly in a great bluff about 12 miles inland on the southern side of Devil's gap. The north- 30 western side of the gap is formed by a range of mountains, extending in a north-westerly direction, which presents an even crest except near its south-eastern end wher^ Jabal Quryat, a small peak, rises to an elevation of about 6,300 feet (1920 m 2); this range terminates northward and southward in bluffs, that at the southern end being 35 very grand and falling in steps. The Devil's gap is the great valley that trends south-westward between the foregoing mountain ranges; when bearing between 216° and 285° it is conspicuous, but when bearing about 250° it is quite open and very remarkable; see views on charts 38 and 2837a. Sometimes, when the mountain tops on 40 either side of the gap are enveloped in continuous clouds of a heavy stratus formation, a clear sky beyond may be seen through the gap; in the evening, this presents a remarkable spectacle. Very heavy squalls occasionally descend through the valley in winter. Jabal Abu Dawud is a detached mountain, about 4,000 feet 45 (1219 m 2) high, of irregular outline, deeply furrowed, and of light colour, rising abruptly from the coast in the vicinity of Ras Abu Dawud, see views on chart 38 and 2837a. When seen from a distance, bearing about 312°, Jabal Abu Dawud has the appearance of an island, steep on its seaward side with a long slope landwards, there 50 being a wide valley between it and the mountains of which Jabal Quryat is the summit. The foot of Jabal Abu Dawud extends for a distance of about 8 miles along the coast. The foregoing mountains are occasionally obscured by haze; Charts 38, 748b.40 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 10c. . • m , but, under these conditions, their outline is often visible for a short time about sunset. Bimma and Dhibab (Thibab) are small villages situated, res- 5 pectively, about 6 and 12 miles north-north-westward of Ras ash Shajar; at the latter place there are large date groves. Daghmar, a small fishing village on a prominent hill, is situated about 8^ miles south-eastward of Ras Abu Dawud, and 1| miles southward of a low projecting sandy point. A white fort on a small mound, visible above the trees, stands on the opposite side of a wadi and indicates the position of the hamlet; at about 4 miles inland of it there is a range of low hills. Quryat, consisting of a number of stone houses and many palm leaf huts is situated, about 3 miles southward of Ras Abu Dawud, 16 on the sandv foreshore, backed by date groves, at the foot of Jabal Abu Dawud'. A small creek, the bar of which is awash at low water, is entered close southward of the hamlet, and close ofi its mouth is a rocky islet, about 50 feet {15 m 2) high; on this islet is a white square watch-tower, 20 feet (6 m l) in height, that forms a con- -20 spicuous mark; when the place was visited by H.M.S. Philomel, in* 1909. there were several dhows in the creek. There is a con spicuous white square building in the hamlet, and a similar one stands at a short distance southward, but the latter is almost hidden in the date groves. 26 Anchorage.—For a distance of about 3 miles north-westward of the low point northward of Daghmar, the bottom is foul for a distance of about half a mile ofishore. Anchorage mav be obtained off Ouryat, in a depth of 12 fathoms (21 m 9). sand, at a distance of about 1^ miles ofishore, with the 50 rocky islet off the mouth of the creek bearing 227 * and Ras Abu Dawud bearing 337 ^ steam vessels may anchor between Quryat and Ras Abu 'Dawud, at a distance of about 2| cables oftshore, in depths of from to 5 fathoms (S In 2 to 9 m l). Coast. —Ras Abu Dawud is steep and rock}-, and is not easily 5a identified at a distance as it is broken up into several points; at about U cables northward of it lies a rock}- islet, about 100 feet (SO^o) high, the depth in the intervening channel being about 3 fathoms 5 m 5). Small vessels could obtain shelter during a shamal in the little bav close southward of the point, but a sailing vessel 10 could not leave if a kaus came on. For a distance of about 4 miles north-westward of Ras Abu Dawud (La*. 2o : 19' X,, Long, SS' 55' £.), the coast is composed of cliffs from which Jabal Abu Dawud rises abruptly; thence it becomes low and sandv as far as Sifa. situated about 6* miles farther north- 41 westward, the foot of the mountains turning inland and leaving a plain between them and the coast. Sifa is a square tower near the coast. standing on a mound about 60 feet ^IS^l high, with a date grove close to it. A range of rugged precipitous hills extends from Sifa to Ras al 6(i Hamar, ses page 4S, situated about 20 miles north-westward, the intervening coast consisting almost entirely of clifis aiiemating with little sandy bays and inlets or coves. Ras al Khairan. situated about 5 miles north-north-westward of Sifa, is a vertical cliff. about 60 feet IS^S high, of a light colour, as Charts SS, 74Sh.54°° Chap. II.] COAST OF 'OMAN 41 Chart 10c. also are the hills within it. See view facing page 39. There are tour httle sandy bays southward of Ras al Khairan; Khaisat as um is t e southernmost; in Sifat ash Sheikh, the next, is a grove ot date trees; the following bay is insignificant; and the last, 5 between Kas Kizkizan, a rocky peninsula on its eastern side, and Kas al Khairan, is about half a mile deep with depths in it of about 6 fathoms (5 m 5), but it is open north-eastward; none of the fore going are named on the chart. Chart 10c, plan of Bandar Khairan. iq i ^^ ia ^ ran •7 _ -^ nc horage.—Immediately westward of Ras a Khairan are two islands, but, owing to the similarity of their appearance with and their closeness to the mainland, they are not easily distinguished. In the channel between the western island and the mainland is Bandar Khairan. 25 The eastern island has a small rocky detached islet close off its north-eastern side; the channel southward of the island, in which 18 a rock above water, is about 60 yards (54 m 9) wide,' tortuous and shallow [Lat. 23° 31' N., Long. 58° 44' E.). The western island is about 300 feet (91 m 4) high, steep, and 20 rocky; close to its north-eastern end is a small detached rock above water, between which and the eastern island is the eastern entrance latter is 3 cables wide, with depths of 15 fathoms )f 7 4 ) in lts outer part. The anchorage in the channel between the western island and the coast, southward of it is from 70 to 200 25 y^n S . (6 t m ^ t0 182m9 ) wide ' with depths of from 3^ to 5 fathoms ) 111 lt; south-western part of the island it is wider, but there is a rocky islet in the middle with depths of 6 fathoms (ll m 0) on its northern side, and from 3 to 4 fathoms (5 m 0 to 7 m 3) elsewhere, round it. Southward of this islet is a narrow 30 passage leading into a shallow bay extending about one mile south ward, and ending in a swamp; on its shores is a large grove of date trees and a small village. The western entrance is about three-quarters of a cable wide and has depths of from 9 to 6 fathoms (16 m 5 to ll m 0) in it. This 35 harbour is only frequented by fishing boats; the winds are usually baffling, especially in the western entrance, and blow in violent gusts during a shamal. Chart 10c. Coast.—From the western entrance of Bandar Khairan, the 40 coast, a rocky cliff, trends westward for about 2J miles to Yiti Yiti is a small fishing village, on the shore of a little sandy bav with a few date trees in the valley behind it. The inhabitants number about 100; chickens, eggs, and fish can be obtained in small quantities. 45 Sheikh rock, about 80 feet (24^4) high, stands on the foreshore at Yiti with a smaller rock, about 50 feet (15^2) high, eastward of it; these rocks are conspicuous from seaward as they appear black against the light-coloured hills inland of them. The most sheltered landing place is about 3 cables westward of Sheikh rock • 50 but a small reef, which probably dries, lies in its approach Close westward of Sheikh rock is the entrance of a lagoon', about one mile long and 3 cables wide, the channel into which runs parallel Charts 38, 2837a, 748b.42 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 10c. with the shore behind Sheikh rock. Small boats can enter at half tide; the lagoon is suitable for seining and fish are plentiful. From Yiti to Bandar Jissah, situated about 2 miles north-westward, 5 the coast is rocky. Chart 10c, plan of Bandar Jissah. Bandar Jissah.—Anchorage. —This bay is protected by a precipitous light-coloured island, about 140 feet (42 m 7) high, and close offshore in its south-western part is an islet. The eastern 10 entrance channel is about \ \ cables wide with depths in it of 7 fathoms (12 m 8); the western entrance is almost blocked by a flat rock or islet with depths of 9 feet (2 m 7) in the narrow channels on either side of it. Anchorage may be obtained in Bandar Jissah in depths of from 4 to 7 fathoms (7 m 3 to 12 m 8). 15 The headland that forms the eastern entrance point of the bay presents, when approached from either direction along the coast, a remarkable likeness to a black sheep's head. The bay is difficult, however, to identify from seaward at a distance greater than one or two miles; the best guide to its locality is the very light colour 20 of the cliffs in the immediate vicinity; its position in relation to Sheikh rock also forms a guide. Westward of the islet in the bay is a village which was reported by H.M.S. Bramble, in 1919, to have fallen into decay, there being at that time not more than 50 inhabitants; many of the wells were 25 disused and contained but a small amount of stagnant water. The best landing place is said to be on the sandy beach in front of the village. Charts 2869, 10c. Coast.—Aspect. —From Bandar Jissah, the coast trends in a 30 general north-westerly direction for about 5 miles to Muscat and is composed of a succession of sandy bays separated by rocky points. There are numerous hills near the coast, behind which mountain ranges extend inland. Saddle hill {Lat. 23° 35' N., Long. 58° 35' E.), situated about 35 3| miles west-north-westward of Bandar Jissah and about 1| miles inland, rises to an elevation of 1,340 feet (408 in 4); it terminates in two sharp peaks which form the summits of a very rugged dark range and when in line bear about 250°; the hill, however, is not particularly conspicuous from northward, as the peaks then appear 40 to be some distance apart. See view facing page 52 and on chart 2837a. Several villages stand on the shores of the sandy bays remarked on above. A1 Bustan, the southernmost, has a date grove in its vicinity, and the inhabitants are agricultural. Kantab, a small 45 fishing village not shown on the chart, lies under Saddle hill; in the bay, a pyramidal rock lies, close offshore, near the village. Sidab is a fishing village on the northern shore of Bandar Sidab, situated about 3| miles north-westward of Bandar Jissah; it is separated from Muscat by a short ridge through a pass in which a 50 footpath gives access to Muscat. The coast on either side of Sidab consists of cliffs rising to rugged hills; the bay may afford shelter to small craft during a shamal. Ras al Kanada, situated about half a mile north-eastward of Sidab, terminates in a cliff about 250 feet (76 m 2) high, with Pillar Charts 38, 2837a, 748b.Chap. II.] muscat 43 Charts 2869, 10c. rock, about 100 feet (30 II1 5) high, lying about 1| cables northward ot it. Two small rocks, from 4 to 6 feet (l m 2 to l^s) high, lie within 0 ? e Jr^ ble of the coast about one-quarter of a mile north-westward of Pillar rock. 5 Mughab is a little cove about half a mile north-westward of Pillar rock that affords good landing for boats southward of Jalali fort, see below. Anchorage, affording shelter during a shamal, may be obtained off Mughab southward of Muscat island, but care must be taken to avoid anchoring in the area indicated by pecked lines 10 on chart 2869 owing to the existance of cables therein Chart 2869. • COVE.-—Aspect. —This cove lies between Muscat island, on its eastern side, and the mainland of 'Oman, on its western side {Lat. 23° 37' N., Long. 58° 36' E.). 15 Approaching from eastward or westward. Saddle hill, see page 42, is remarkable. Farther inland and southward is the Quryat range, westward of which are Jabal Tayin and Jabal Nakhl, see page 49, with low ranges between them and the coast. Approaching from westward or northward Fahal islet, see page 48, is a good mark. 20 Muscat island has a very irregular, rocky, and precipitous coast- and depths of 30 fathoms (9^1) are found from one to 2 cables off its eastern side. A pillar rock, about 100 feet (30^5) high, lies close off its south-eastern extremity. The western side of Muscat island is covered with the names of European vessels of different 25 nationalities painted in white on the rocks, a time-honoured custom whereby their first visit is recorded. In several cases the White Ensign (with yellow staff) is depicted with the name of the vessel the position of that painted by H.M.S. Perseus being indicated on chart 2869, though, in 1931, this particular ensign was reported 30 to be almost obliterated. Ras Muscat, the northern extremity of Muscat island, is a round sloping bluff with cliffs southward of it. See view facing page 52 and on charts 2869 and 2837a. A reef of rocks extends northward from the point for a distance of about one-quarter of a cable. 35 Fisher's rock, 10 feet (3 m 0) high, lies about one-quarter of a cable northward of the extremity of the reef, and in the channel between them there are depths of from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 6 to 5 m 5). Sira tower is situated on the eastern side of the cove about half way up the northern slope of Muscat island, If cables southward of 40 Kas Muscat; under the tower and near the water's edge is a fort. Ras Kalbuh, the western entrance point of the cove, is the northern extremity of a detached precipitous ridge rising to an elevation of 43o feet (132m6); at the northern end of the ridge, above the point is a conspicuous white tower; the ridge slopes down, at its south- 45 eastern end to a cliff, about 150 feet (45^7) high, on which is Mirani fort with a battery below it near the sea level. Sira al Gharbiyah is a fort, with two tiers of embrasures and a round tower on its highest part, standing on the extremity of a spur which projects eastward into the cove from the middle of the ridge 50 on its western side. See view on chart 2869. Jalali fort, with two tiers of embrasures, crowns the summit of a small detached hill, about 150 feet (45 m 7) high, in the south eastern corner of Muscat cove on the northern side of Mughab cove. Charts 10c, 38, 2837a, 748b.44 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. 11. Chart 2869. Between this hill and the southern end of Muscat island is a detached islet about 100 feet (30 m 5) high that is connected to the coast south ward of it by a reef; between this islet and Muscat island is a boat 6 passage named Duwairah in which there is a depth of about 2 feet (0 m 6). The town of Muscat {Lat. 23° 37' NLong. 58° 36' E.) is situated at the head of Muscat cove in rear of a beach between Forts Mirani and Jalali. This town, and also those immediately north-westward 10 of it, do not show up well under the dark hills and are only visible when the coves are open. In the morning, with the sun shining on it, Jalali fort sometimes shows white, on westerly bearings, against the dark hills behind it. Makallah bay is the indentation on the western side of the cove, 15 southward of Sira al Gharbiyah; the depths in the bay are shallow and it is used as an anchorage for the smaller native craft; on the shore at the head of the bay are coal sheds from which a pier, with a depth of 4 feet (l m 2) at its head, extends in an east-north-easterly direction; though used for loading and unloading coal lighters, 20 the pier is of no use as a landing place for Muscat as there is no way round. Depths.—Shoal.—There are depths of from 9 to 13 fathoms (16 m 5 to 23 m 8) in the entrance of Muscat cove, decreasing gradually to 6 fathoms (ll m 0) abreast Sira al Gharbiyah, and to 2 fathoms 25 (3 m 7) at a distance of about one cable from the head of the cove. A rocky patch, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), lies, about half a cable from the eastern shore of the cove, about 2 cables within its entrance. Fisher's rock, bearing about 020°, and well open of the north-western extremity of Muscat island, leads 30 north-westward of the danger; and Pillar rock, bearing about 144°, and well open of the south-western extremity of that island, leads south-westward of it. Lights.—Buoy. —A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 273 feet (83 I11 2), from a white tower, 14 feet (4 m 3) in height, erected on 35 the northern summit of Muscat island. It can be distinguished from the anchorage and may therefore be used as an anchorage mark at night. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 62 feet (18 m 9), from the flagstaff at the British Consulate, about half a cable south-westward 40 of Jalali fort. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 165 feet (50 m 3), from a position about 2| cables south-south-eastward of the British Consulate. These last two lights in line, bearing 158°, lead through the entrance 45 and up the centre of Muscat cove. A black mooring-buoy is established about one cable south eastward of the head of the pier in Makallah bay. Anchorage Directions. —Small vessels should anchor off the western shore of the cove, near Sira al Gharbiyah; but a good berth 50 for a vessel of moderate size is with her anchor on the line of the leading marks and westward of a white-topped pinnacle rock, situated about 2| cables southward of Ras Muscat; in 1931, it was reported that this rock could not be identified. The cove, however, is open Charts 10c, 38, 2837a, 748b.Chap. II.] muscat 45 Chart 2869. io the shamal, and as that wind usually blows a couple of points off the western shore while the sea sets straight in, it is advisable during its continuance to lay out a stern anchor to keep the vessel head on to the swell. During hot weather, the vessel's stern may 5 be hauled in towards the white-topped pinnacle rock by a hawser secured to it or, preferably, by a stern anchor laid out in that direction; in this position she will lie broadside on to the breeze. There is also another convenient rock to which a stern hawser may be secured the position of which is easily identified from the fact that it is a 10 large, round, dark-coloured rock and that immediately behind it is painted the legend 'H.M.S. Philomel' in white letters on a blue ground. The nashi sends in a heavy swell, and there is little or no shelter from it, but the bottom is of sand and shells, and with a long scope 15 of cable vessels seldom drag; moreover, near the rocks there appears to be a rebound of the sea which lessens the strain on the cable. Outside the cove, in depths over 20 fathoms (36 m 6), the bottom is of clay or mud. The area within the 5-fathom (9 m l) line is not usually available 20 for visiting vessels as it is nearly always occupied by native craft and the Sultan's yacht. The cove should be entered on the line of the leading lights; the position of the rear light may be identified by its proximity to the eastern end of the wall eastward of Buma Sali, a very conspicuous 25 tower situated about 2| cables southward of the British Consulate The anchor should not be dropped before the pinnacle rock with the white top bears less than 109° on account of the 2-fathom (3™?) patch near it. The usual landing place is on the beach immediately in front of 30 the British Consulate. When there is a surf on the beach, the best landing will be found in Mughab bay, by going through Duwairah passage. Muscat. —This picturesque town {Lat. 23° 37'N. ,Long.58 0 36' E ) is protected on its eastern and part of its southern sides by precipitous 35 hills, the remainder of the southern side, and the western side, is defended by a wall. Outside the wall, and between it and the rugged hills encircling the town, every available level spot is occupied by mat huts. Several footpaths lead through the passes and a road to A1 Matrah, see page 47, fit for motor traffic, has been 40 constructed. The Sultan's palace is the largest building on the sea front; the mosques are small and have neither dome nor minarets. In addition to those already mentioned, there are several towers on the sur rounding hills. 45 Muscat is the capital of Oman and, with Al Matrah, has a podu- lation of about 20,000. Great Britain is represented by a Political Agent and also a Consul. Westward of the British Consulate, there is a hospital in the charge of an officer of the Indian Medical Service. 50 Dates, hides and skins, and dried fish are exported; rice and piece goods are the chief imports. Certain kinds of cloths, used by the Arabs, are woven, and weapons, other than firearm's, are manufactured. Charts 10c, 38, 2837a, 748b.46 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 2869. Supplies. —A stock of coal is maintained, but a day's notice is necessary for the loading of the lighters, of which there are about 33; baskets are used, and about 200 tons can be put on board per 5 diem. Fresh provisions are plentiful, though in summer vegetables are scarce. Water, of good quality, can be brought off to vessels in tanks each of about 2 tons capacity. 10 Climate. —Muscat is not unhealthy, although it is said to be one of the hottest towns in the world. The highest temperature recorded is 116° F., and the lowest 49° F. The high temperatures are due to the hot winds, which sometimes in summer, and generally for only a few hours at night, blow from the Arabian deserts and 15 barren rocks around Muscat. For the greater part of the summer, owing to the high state of humidity of the atmosphere, in com bination with a high temperature, the climate is very trying. From November until the middle of March, the weather is pleasant, but fails to be bracing, as the temperature seldom falls below 60°, The 20 average rainfall is 4 inches (101 mm ), and it is due to this that Muscat may be considered to be a fairly healthy port, provided ordinary precautions are taken; if using shore water it should be purified by boiling or filtration, and care must be taken to protect oneself from mosquitos, which during winter, are numerous in the town, 25 and cause a considerable amount of malaria amongst the natives. See also Meteorological table, page 282. Communications. —Mail steamers call at Muscat on their way to and from the Persian gulf; except for these, few steam vessels now enter the port unless calling for orders or to discharge some 30 particular cargo. Telegraphic communication to all parts of the world is main tained through Jask, see page 29. The post office is maintained by the Indian Government, and the telegraph office by the Imperial and International Communications 35 Ltd. COAST.—Kalbuh cove. —This cove is entered between Ras Kalbuh and Ras al Baz, situated about 3| cables westward. Ras al Baz is a small detached hill, about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, situated at the end of a promontory fringed with drying reefs and 40 on the summit of which is a round tower. The hill is connected to the higher part of the promontory, southward of it, by a sandy isthmus on which stands the village of Dohab. A rocky spit, awash at high water, extends from the shore close southward of Ras Kalbuh for a distance of about half a cable. 45 There are depths of from 4 to 8 fathoms (7 m 3 to 14 m 6) in the outer part of the cove, but this part is not used as an anchorage for it affords but little shelter; in the inner part the depths decrease from 4 fathoms (7 m 3) to one fathom (l m 8). Kalbuh is situated at the head of the cove and extends into the 50 pass leading to Muscat, to the suburbs of which it is almost joined. Matrah bay. —This bay is entered between Ras al Baz and Ras Kowasir, situated about three-quarters of a mile north-westward. The latter is a precipitous point, with a low white islet lying about Charts 10c, 38, 2837a, 748b.Chap. II.] coast of 'oman 47 Chart 2869. one cable north-eastward of it, and. a ledge, on which are some rocks about 50 feet (I5 m 2) high, extending eastward for about three- quarters of a cable from its south-eastern extremity. Matrah peak, the summit of a range of hills, is remarkably sharp 5 and rises to an elevation of 1,010 feet (307 m 9), about 111 cables south-south-westward of Ras al Baz. Riyam cove, at the head of which is the village of the same name, is in the south-eastern part of the bay. A steep and rugged pass! leads from the village to Muscat. ' iq Al Matrah castle stands on the summit of a detached hill, about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, situated on the southern shore of the bay, about three-quarters of a mile south-westward of Ras al Baz. This hill separates the village of Matairah, eastward of it, from the town of Al Matrah, in the south-western corner of the bay. Other 15 villages stand on the shores of the small indentations in Matrah bay. Al Matrah (Lut. 23° 38' NLong. 58° 34' E.) is a walled town with suburbs outside the walls. _ The Sultan is represented by a Wali. At Matrah there is a Khojah community, mostly merchants 20 and shopkeepers, who dwell in a large fort or enclosed quarter on the sea front to which the only persons of any other sect admitted are the British officials at Muscat. Until the completion of the motor road remarked on on page 45, communication with Muscat was almost entirely carried on by sea. 25 Anchorage.—Rock. —Matrah bay affords good shelter in a shamal, but is open to the nashi. The larger native vessels always anchor in this bay in preference to Muscat cove. The anchorage is off the north-western shore, 3 or 4 cables north-eastward of Arbak South fort, situated about 4 cables south-westward of Ras Kowasir. so A small rock, over which there is a depth of 1|- fathoms {2^7), lies about 2 cables northward of the eastern tower of Al Matrah castle. A red mooring-buoy has been established, for the use of lighters, about 1^ cables north-eastward of Arbak South fort. ' 35 Shataifi cove.— This cove is entered between Ras Kowasir and Ras ash Shataifi, situated about 3 cables northward. Ras ash Shataifi is a vertical cliff, at the north-eastern end of a ridge of hills from 200 to 300 feet (61 m 0 to 91 m 4) high, close off which there are depths of 10 fathoms (18 m 3). ' 40 The cove is not used as an anchorage as it is open to the nashi; at its head is the small fishing village of Shataifi; a foot path leads thence to Arbak, a village on the northern side of Al Matrah. Chart 10c. Coast.— From Ras ash Shataifi, the coast of 'Oman is cliffy 45 and treads in a westerly direction for about one mile to Ras Aiyint a small projecting point, not shown on the chart, close westward of which is the little village of Aiyint. Little Darsait is a small shallow bay, westward of Aiyint, which is well sheltered by rocks and in which small boats could safely 50 anchor. On the shore of the bay are a few huts, but there is no way inland, and the only way of reaching them on land is along the rocks on the coast. Charts 38, 2837a, 748b.48 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. 11. Chart 10c, plan of Dar sail anchorage. Darsait anchorage.—Rock. —At about 2| miles westward of Ras ash Shataifi is the mouth of a deep valley at the foot of which, situated on a sand and shingle beach, is the village of Darsait. 5 Open anchorage may be obtained in a depth of about 6 fathoms (ll m O), sand, at a distance of one-quarter of a mile northward of the village, but rocks extend a considerable distance offshore on either side of it. A rock, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), was reported, 10 in 1915, to lie about 2f cables offshore, 6J cables north-eastward of the fort in the village, and a chain of rocks projects nearly one cable north-eastward from the shore at the western end of the beach. The beach is fairly steep-to, and landing in ordinary weather is easy; but it would probably be impracticable during either a 15 shamdl or a nashi; the best place appears to be at the western end of the beach. The village is in two parts with about 40 huts in each; a stone fort, about 15 feet (4 m 6) in height, stands in front of the western part and is the only stone building; a smaller fort is hidden amongst 20 the huts of the eastern part. There are two towers on spurs of the hills, one on either side of the valley; that on the eastern side is about 30 feet (9 m l) in height, and that on the western side, which is in ruins, 50 feet (15 m 2). The valley is filled with palm trees and from its head a path leads 25 through the hills to A1 Matrah. The inhabitants are fisherfolk and appear to do a considerable trade. Chart 10c. Coast. —Close westward of Darsait, a conspicuous red hill rises above the cliffs at its base to an elevation of about 400 feet (121 m 9); 30 the summit of the hill is in the form of paps. From this hill, a sandy beach extends north-westward, for about one mile, to a sloping point, named Ras al Abyadh. Ras al Hamar [Lat. 23° 39' NLong. 58° 30' E.) is a red cliffy point, about 150 feet (45 m 7) high, situated at a short distance west- 35 ward of Ras al Abyadh. From Ras al Hamar, the coast trends south-westward and westward for a distance of about 20 miles, forming Kubbat al Hail, a large sandy bay. There is a small creek, not shown on the chart, into which 40 runs a large water-course at the eastern end of Kubbat al Hail ; at the creek are a few huts and mangrove trees. Gobra and Khalil are two small villages, about one-quarter of a mile apart, situated about 7 miles westward of the creek. The villages lie on the eastern and western sides, respectively, of a date 45 grove and consist entirely of mat huts which are not conspicuous; there is no fort in either village. The date grove is comparatively conspicuous and lies in a dip of the sand dune, which fringes the coast and is elsewhere about 20 feet (G 111 !) high. The grove lies about 3 cables inland and can be clearly seen from seaward at a 50 distance of about 4 miles. Westward of Khalil there are no date palms until the vicinity of Hail is reached. Fahal. —This precipitous islet is situated about 2 miles north ward of Ras al Hamar; it is about 280 feet (85 m 3) high and steep-to, there being depths of from 14 to 38 fathoms (25 m 6 to 69 m 5) round Charts 38, 2837a, 748b.Chap.

Charts 10c, 2837a. and is visible from seaward for the whole of its length, gradually approaching the sea until, at Murair, there is only a comparatively narrow plain between the foothills and the coast. 5 Supplies of cattle, poultry, fish, and vegetables might possibly be obtained at the coastal towns. Chart 10c. Coast.—Anchorage. —Hail al 'Umair is a small village west ward of which the date groves extend continuously to and beyond Sib. 10 Sib {Lat. 23° 41' N., Long. 58° 10' E.), situated about 4 miles west-north-westward of Hail al 'Umair, is a scattered town with two small detached forts. The position of the town is difficult to identify on account of the continuous coastal belt of palm trees. During the hot season, the mountains inland are only clearly visible 15 at sunrise and sunset. Two white-domed buildings and one of the forts are, however, visible from seaward, and at a short distance southward are two gaps in the palm trees about three-quarters of a mile apart. The town is cooler and healthier than Muscat. Anchorage may be obtained at Sib in a depth of about 5 fathoms 20 (9 m I), sand, at a distance of about half a mile offshore, but there is no protection whatever. Ras al Ghaf.—Shoal. —This broad low projection is situated about 5 miles westward of Sib; in its vicinity, for a distance of about 4 miles, there are no date trees near the coast, and sand hills 25 rise at a short distance inland. The point is named from two large ghaf or acacia trees on its most projecting part. A sand bank, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies about 1| miles northward of Ras al Ghaf; between the bank and the coast, there is a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3). 30 Daimaniyat islands— Danger—Anchorage.— These islands, called by the Arab seamen Saba' jezair, lie nearly parallel with the coast and from 6| to 8 miles offshore; they are all quite barren and waterless, and are frequented by fishermen from the mainland. Jezirat Kharabah, the eastern of these islands, is situated about 35 8| miles northward of Sib, and is about 25 feet (7 m 6) high, with black rocky points separated by white sandy beaches, which might show up at night; a reef extends about half a mile off its northern and eastern sides, and there are depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) at one- quarter of a mile off it. There are several detached rocks round the 40 island. The eastern islet of the middle group lies about 3 miles west- north-westward of Jezirat Kharabah, and the group extends west ward for about 3| miles. The group consists of seven islets of different sizes in a line, with some detached rocks. The islets 45 are from 30 to 40 feet (9 m l to 12 m 2) high, with low cliffs of light- brown colour, difficult to see at night. On the western and largest islet are two little hills separated by a valley. The islets are said to be steep-to, with no outlying shoals, but soundings are no guide by which to approach them from inshore. H. M. S. Hastings anchored, 50 in 1931, about 4J cables southward of the eastern end of the western islet of this group in a depth of 15 fathoms (27 m 4), sand. This position provided good shelter from a heavy swell which, due to a light shamal then blowing, was rolling in round the islets. There Charts 2837a, 7m.Chap. II.] COAST OF BATINAH 51 Chart 10c. are two good sandy beaches near the middle of the southern side of the islet where landing was easily effected. The western group, consisting of Jezirat Jun and three islets or rocks, lies about 3| miles west-south-westward of the middle 5 group, the passage between being clear with depths of about 19 fathoms (34 r n7) ,* the group extends westward for a distance of about 12 miles. Jezirat Jun is 107 feet (32 m 6) high near its western end, of light-brown colour, and is not easily seen at night. Fair anchorage may be obtained on the southern side of Jezirat Jun in depths of 10 from 7 to 8 fathoms (12 in 8 to 14 m 6), sand, about one-quarter of a mile off a small sandy beach; the position is sheltered from north ward, though much swell rolls round the islet during strong winds. Half a mile southward of Jezi'rat Jun is a 4|-fathom (8^2) shoal with depths of 8 fathoms (14^6) between it'and the islet. A 2- 15 fathom (3 m 7) spit extends about 1| cables south-eastward from the western islet or rock. Clive rock, on which the E.I.C. sloop Clive grounded in 1858, lies about one mile west-north-westward of Jezirat Jun; it is a detached patch about one-quarter of a mile in extent, over which 20 there is a depth of If fathoms (2 m 7), coral rock, and round which there are depths of from 14 to 20 fathoms (25 m 6 to 36 m 6) at a distance of one-quarter of a mile. The rock is visible from aloft when the sun is in a favourable position. The depths southward of the Daimaniyat islands are fairly 25 regular and less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6), except in the vicinity of the eastern group. In depths less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6), the bottom is mud and sand; in greater depths it is chiefly mud. There is a depth of 20 fathoms (36 m 6), about 1| miles northward of Jezirat Jim. 30 Coast.—Anchorage.— Abu Nahail, situated about 8 miles west ward of Sib, is a hamlet, consisting of 30 or 40 mat huts, in which there is a well. Barkah [Lat. 23° 43' N., Long. 57° 54' E.), situated about 7 miles westward of Abu Nahail, is a town in the middle of which is 35 the Shaikh's castle, a lofty and conspicuous building with four large flanking towers at its corners. The town extends, for a distance of about 3 miles, along the coast in the date plantations which line the shore nearly to Ras al Ghaf. In the vicinity of the town, the land is well cultivated. There is a large bazaar, and fresh provisions 40 could be obtained. The Sultan is represented by a Wali. Anchorage may be obtained in the vicinity of Barkah, at a distance of about one mile offshore, in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), sand; the depths decrease regularly shoreward, but the anchorage is unsheltered; when in depths less than 4 fathoms (7 m 3), the bottom 45 becomes visible. Within a distance of about 3 miles north-eastward of this anchorage the depths, between 5 and 9 fathoms (9 m l to 16 m 5), are irregular. In 1931, H.M.S. Penzance anchored in a depth of 3| fathoms (6 m 4), sand, with the fort bearing about 189°, distant 5J cables. ' 5 q Suwadi point, situated about 7^ miles north-westward of Barkah castle, is a low sandy projection; the date groves on the coast end about 1| miles soath-eastward of the point; there is a well of good water on the beach about one mile westward of the point. Charts 2837a, 748b.52 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. 11. Chart 10c. Suwadi point and the off-lying islets are reported to lie about three-quarters of a mile farther northward than charted. Jezair Suwadi.—Anchorage. —Jezair Suwadi consist of seven 5 islets lying within If miles west-north-westward of Jabal 'Add, the largest, see view on chart 2837a. Jabal 'Add, lying close off Suwadi point, is about 280 feet (85 m 3) high; it is table-topped, but there is a gap in it, and on its seaward side it is cliffy; on its western side, there is a little sandy bay. 10 The channel between Jabal 'Add and Suwadi point is about 2 cables wide, but it dries from 2 to 3 feet (0 m 6 to 0 m 9) right across. The six islets lying westward of Jabal 'Add are from 50 to 150 feet (15 m 2 to 45 in 7) high, and precipitous; Makbarah, the southern, has a tower on its south-eastern end, built in the days of piracy to 15 protect the anchorage; there is also a tower on the summit of the western islet. Between Makbarah and the coast, there is a boat anchorage about half a mile in extent, with a depth of about 6 feet (l m 8) close to the islet, where native vessels anchor partly sheltered from the prevailing 20 winds. The entrance is close south-westward of the islet; in the date season, the anchorage is crowded with boats. A small vessel might obtain anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), close off the south-eastern side of Jabal 'Add, but she would be on a lee shore should a nashi come on. 25 Close outside Jazair Suwadi there are depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to 9 m l). Coast.—Anchorage. —Bu 'Abali is a village situated about 5f miles westward of Suwadi point. Masn 'ah, situated about 2J miles westward of Bu 'Abali, is a village in the middle of which is a conspicuous fort, with a tower surmounted by a flagstaff. Shirs [Lat. 23° 47' N., Long. 57° 37' E.), situated about one mile westward of Masn 'ah, is a straggling village in which are six conspicuous trees and in the middle of which is a square ruined 35 fort. Depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found about one mile offshore. A1 Uwaid, Wadam, and A1 Khabba are three villages, situated in that order, between Shirs and As Suwaik. Wadam may be identified by a square ruined tower, near the water's edge, and the 40 mosque, a white square building, in its centre. In October, 1930, H.M.S. Cyclamen anchored, in a depth of about 4| fathoms (8 m 7), with the ruined tower bearing about 198°, distant 12 cables. As Suwaik.—Shoal. —As Suwaik, situated about 10| miles westward of Shirs, is a partly walled town in the middle of which 45 is a large and conspicuous fort of a light yellow colour with three high towers, the highest being surmounted by a flagstaff. See view facing this page. At about 16 miles south-westward of the town, are two conspicuous hills, from 700 to 1,000 feet (213 m 4 to 304 m 8) high and of a light yellow colour, which show up well against 50 the dark mountains inland when the sun is shining upon them. Outside the walls of the town are many mat huts. The Sultan is represented by a Wali. Goats, fowls, sweet potatoes, and onions may be procured in small quantities. A shoal extends seaward from the coast in the vicinity of As Charts 2837a, 748b.Saddle hill. View of approaches to Muscat, from cast-south-eastward Ras Muscat, bearing 290°, distant 20 miles.

Coast.—Anchorage. —Riddah, not shown on the chart, but situated about 2 miles westward of As Suwaik, is the most important 5 of several villages on the coast between As Suwaik and A1 Khadhra. A1 Khadhra is a village which extends along the coast for a distance of about one mile from a position about one mile west ward of Riddah. A fort, with two partly ruined towers, stands in the centre of A1 Khadhra, and there is a conspicuous umbrella- 10 shaped tree at the eastern end of the village. From northward, the towers of the fort are difficult to distinguish, particularly after noon, as from this direction only the ruined interiors are visible. Anchorage was obtained, by H.M.S. Cyclamen, in October, 1930, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 ni 3) with the fort at A1 Khadhra 15 bearing 182°, distant 9 cables. Chart 2837a. Khaburah. —Situated about 14 miles north-westward of A1 Khadhra, is Khaburah one of the principal places on this coast, having a large trade with Bahrein, see page 210, and the Shatt al 20 'Arab, see page 252. Khaburah may be identified from the fact that the northern portion of the town is built of stone and mud as opposed to the usual mat structures; in addition, there is a tall black flagstaff on the fort. The depths off the town, inside the 5-fathom (9 m l) line, are very irregular. At distances of about 25 25 and 20 miles, respectively, south-westward of Khaburah are two conspicuous mountains; the more distant is about 3,000 feet (914 m 4) high, bluff, and quoin-shaped; the nearer is a double peak on the lower jagged range of foot-hills. Coast— Ras al Hayari is situated about 6| miles north-westward 30 of Khaburah; on the point is a village with two mud forts, the southern of which is square and has one tower, whereas the northern is square but has three towers. There are many huts between the coast and the date groves in rear. Majasaah, not shown on the chart, but situated about 3 miles 55 north-westward of Ras al Hayari, is a village in which is a low fort with a single round tower at its north-western end. Dil, situated about one mile north-westward of Majasaah, has two low forts, about one -quarter of a mile apart, with huts between them and the coast. (La*. 24° 06' N., Long. 56° 57' E.) 40 Umm al Jaarif, not shown on the chart, but situated about one mile north-westward of Dil, is a small village that may be identified by a large square castellated tower of a darker colour than is usual on this coast. , tt i Makhailif, situated about one mile north-westward of Umm al 45 Jaarif is a small village with a large high fort that is the most conspicuous mark on this part of the coast; a large and conspicuous dark tree stands on the coast about half a mile south-eastward of th Saham, situated about 4 miles north-westward of Makhailif, 50 is a large village in which is a low square fort, but owing to the date trees in rear it is difficult of identification. The fort is most easily distinguished on a west -south-westerly bearing; it has two towers but they rise only a few feet above the rest of the building, Chart 748b.54 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 2837a. and in front of it are two tall palm trees. At about half a mile southward of the fort, is a tower the top of which is in ruins; it is visible from southward, but not from northward. The huts of the &lt;5 village extend along the coast for a distance of about one mile. Sohar.—Anchorage. —Situated about 13 miles north-westward of Saham, is Sohar, a walled town with a moat (Lat. 24° 21' N., Long. 56° 45' E.). In it is a fort in which are several large round trees and a square tower about 110 feet (33 m 5) high surmounted by a 10 flagstaff, see view facing page 53. This tower is very conspicuous and is visible from seaward before the trees of the date groves, which are quite continuous in this locality, come into view; it has been sighted at a distance of 12 miles. Many mat huts are erected, outside the walls, in the date groves along the beach. In the town, 15 which in 1927 had a population of about 7,500, is a bazaar; at that time, chickens, beef, and a small quantity of vegetables were obtainable. There are some good wells close to the beach. The Sultan is represented by a Wali, who lives in the fort. Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), sand, at a 20 distance of about one mile off the town. The depths shoal gradually towards the coast. In 1931, H.M.S. Triad anchored in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) with Sohar fort bearing 220°, distant about 9 cables, and the northernmost date palm bearing 309°; and in the same year, H.M.S. Penzance anchored in a depth of 3 fathoms 25 (5 m 5), sand, with the fort bearing 250°, distant 7 cables. Except in a calm sea, landing is bad owing to the surf on the sandy beach. Sohar peak, called by the Arabs Hurah Barghah, rises from the plain, in front of the main mountain ranges, some 12 miles south- westward of the town, to an elevation of 1,550 feet (472 m 4); it is 30 conical in shape, light brown in colour, and when visible is a good mark. See view on chart 2837a. Coast. —A1 Fasikah, situated about 6 miles north-westward of Sohar, is a straggling village with a fort on a slight rise at its northern end. In rear of the village is another fort with two con- 35 spicuous date trees in front of it. There is a solitary bushy tree on the beach northward of the village. Majis, the largest village between Sohar and Shinas, is situated about 2 miles north-westward of A1 Fasikah; it is composed of mat huts and in the centre of the village is a long low inconspicuous 40 fort with one square tower in its north-eastern corner. Harmul, situated about 3 miles north-westward of Majis, is a village of date-stalk huts with a large building on the beach at its south-eastern end. Liwa, situated about 2J miles inland from Harmul, is a large 45 square fort with a square tower in the middle that is visible from seaward above the date trees. The large building at Harmul may be identified in low visibility for, when in line with the fort at Liwa, it bears 266°. The peak shown on chart 2837a, about 6| miles south-westward of Liwa, is conspicuous and stands out well 50 against the background of mountains; it is of a darker colour than Sohar peak. Shinas.—Anchorage. —Situated about 16 miles north-westward of Harmul, is Shinas, a small town with a large fort. The fort has three towers, that at its northern end being higher than the Chart 748b.Chap. II.] COAST OF ASH SHAMAILIYAH 55 Chart 2837a. others and higher than those of any other forts in the neighbourhood; on north-westerly bearings, the fort presents a long low front, and on west-south-westerly bearings is visible at a considerable distance. See view facing page 53. The town shows up well against the back- 5 ground of trees, except from northward, from which direction only the highest tower of the fort is visible. A creek, the mouth of which is situated about 1^ miles northward of the town, extends parallel with the coast along the whole of its frontage; the entrance, which may be identified by a small sand-hill on the beach and the 10 break in the date trees, is conspicuous when bearing less than 300°. Dhows are usually to be seen in the creek, both northward and southward of the town. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m I), at a short distance northward of the town, off the mouth of the creek. 15 The depths shoal gradually to the coast. Landing is effected in the creek, but it is difficult with on-shore winds owing to the surf. Coast. —Murair, situated about 13 miles north-westward of Shinas, is a village with three large towers, two at its northern end and one at its southern end, the latter being in ruins. At about one 20 mile southward of Murair, there is a large fort with two ruined towers in the neighbourhood of which are several mat huts. There are three small villages between Shinas and Murair. The Batinah coast ends about one mile northward of Murair and at about 2 miles farther northward, Khatmat Mildhah, a dark ridge 25 of hills, slopes down to the coast. ASH SHAMAILIYAH. —The coast of Ash Shamailiyah, part of the principality of Sharjah, see page 4, extends in a general northerly direction, for a distance of about 38 miles, from Khatmat Milahah to and including Dibah. The coast consists of cliffs 30 alternating with sandy bays in which are villages and date groves; the coastal plain gradually becomes narrower until, at about 20 miles northward of Khatmat Milahah, the hills slope down to the coast. Coast. —Khor Kalba, situated about 5 miles northward of Murair, 35 is a small village with a fort; at the village is a creek that may be entered by boats at high water. Sohar peak, see page 54, appears triangular in shape when bearing less than 225°, and from off Khor Kalba it resembles a light brown triangular island. 40 Gallah or Kalba village {Lat. 25° 04' N., Long. 56° 20' E.) is situated about 3 miles northward of Khor Kalba. It is a large village and in it is a dilapidated Arab fort, a large square building resembling a castle with a conspicuous square tower that may be identified on west-north-westerly bearings at a distance of about 45 15 miles. See view facing page 56. From the village, a thick date grove extends northward along the coast for about 2\ miles, at which distance from the village there is an almost bare sandv patch. A1 Fujaira.—Anchorage.—Shoal.— Situated about 3 miles 50 northward of Gallah and about miles inland, is A1 Fujaira, a small town of huts, erected amongst date trees which latter extend from the bare sandy patch to a position about one mile northward Chart 748b.56 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. II. Chart 2837a. of the town. In the town is a conspicuous Arab fort with towers. Gherefa, not shown on the chart, but situated about one mile southward of the fort, is a small village of mat huts between the 5 date grove and the coast. Anchorage may be obtained off A1 Fujaira, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), at a distance of about three-quarters of a mile offshore. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), was discovered by H.M.S. Espiegle, in 1910, in a position about 1| miles offshore eastward of A1 Fujaira; between the shoal and the coast there are depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l). Coast. —Sakamkam, situated about 3 miles northward of A1 Fujaira, is a small village, the position of which may be identified by a round tower situated at some distance inland. Close north- 15 ward of Sakamkam is a steep, black, rocky point between which and Khor Fakkan is a plain dotted over with black hillocks varying in height and resembling gigantic mole-hills. Chart 2837a, plan of Khor Fakkan. Khor Fakkan.—Anchorage. —On the southern shore of this 20 sandy bay, situated about 11 miles northward of Sakamkam, is a village with a large date grove, see view facing page 57. Immediately southward of the bay is a hilly projection, from 1,000 to 2,000 feet (304 m 8 to 609 m 6) high, off the extremity of which lies a peaked islet about 240 feet (73 m 2) high; the channel between the islet and 25 the point is about 2 cables wide, with depths in it of about 3J fathoms (5 in 9). Khor Fakkan is entered between this islet and Ras Luluiyah, a rocky point, situated about miles north-north-westward. The depths in the bay decrease regularly shorewards from about 9 fathoms (16 m 5) in the entrance. 30 Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0), sand, at a distance of about half a mile offshore abreast the village, but it is open to the nashi. Eastward of the village and northward of a cliffy point on which are two ruined towers, is a little cove with a sandy beach at its head; 35 there are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) in the entrance, and within it small boats can find sheltered anchorage. A conspicuous tower stands, at an elevation of 268 feet (81 m 7), in a position about 4 cables southward of the village. Fresh meat can sometimes be obtained; fish, such as rock cod, 40 &amp;c., is plentiful. The natives were very friendly when visited by H.M.S. Redbreast, in 1910, and H.M.S. Triad, in 1923. Chart 753. Coast. —From Ras Luluiyah, the coast trends northward and, 45 for a distance of about 4 miles, is low, sandy, and lined with date groves, the mountains being but a short distance inland. Zubara is a small village situated about If miles northward of Ras Luluiyah. A1 Badi (Lat. 25° 26' N., Long. 56° 23' E.), an islet about 200 50 feet (61 m 0) high, lies close offshore about IJ miles northward of Zubara; on the coast, at a short distance northward of the islet, is a village of the same name. Sharam, Dhadnah, and Rul Dhadnah are three villages situated on the coast, respectively, about 2, 7f, and 8| miles northward of Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. II.] COAST OF ASH SHAMAILIYAH 57 Chart 753.

Ras Dibah, situated about 1J miles northward of Rul Dhadnah, 5 is a projecting point consisting of cliffs of moderate height; at about half a mile northward of the point is an islet, the depths in the intervening channel being about 2 fathoms (S 111 ?); there is a sand bluff in the cliffs about one mile westward of the point, which is conspicuous from northward but cannot be seen from eastward. 1° Duhat Dibah.—Anchorage. —'This bay is entered between the islet off Ras Dibah and Ras Suwat, a rocky point to which slope down three spurs of the mountain range, situated about 5| miles north-westward; it is open from north-north-eastward to eastward, and the depths decrease regularly from 15 fathoms (27 m 4), in the 15 entrance, to the sandy beach. It is reported that, between the sand bluff mentioned in the previous paragraph and the Shaikh's fort, the shore of the bay recedes considerably more than is indicated on the chart. Dibah town is situated at the head of the bay about 5 miles 20 westward of Ras Dibah, and in it are two forts only the southern of which can be seen from seaward. There are extensive date plantations in the valley southward of the town and all along the shore of the bay which greatly obscure the view of the town from seaward. The Shaikh's fort, the southern one, is situated close 25 to the beach in front of the date palms; it is small but conspicuous. Cattle, vegetables, &amp;c., may be obtainable. Anchorage was obtained by H.M.S. Cyclamen, in October, 1930, in a depth of about 5| fathoms (10 m l), with the Shaikh's fort bearing 250°, distant 6| cables. In 1931, H.M.S. Penzance an-30 chored in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), sand, with the fort bearing 230°, distant 4 cables. Landing may be effected in fine weather on the sandy beach at the head of the bay. The village of A1 Karsha [Lat. 25° 40' N., Long. 56 17 E.), 35 situated about 2|- miles northward of the Shaikh's fort at Dibah, is in the district of Ruus al Jabal, the boundary running inland from a position between the two villages. For the coast of Ruus al Jabal, see page 86.

COAST OF LAS BELA. —The coast of Las Bela extends from the frontier of British India, at the mouth of the Hab river, northward for about 30 miles, ajid thence westward for nearly 5 140 miles to Kh5r Kalmat. It is chiefly an uninhabited wilderness of hills and cliffs at the foot of which are swamps or desert plains. Water is everywhere bad and difficult to obtain I very few supplies can be had from the villages. Chart 41. , 10 Cape Monze.— Light.—Off-lying dangers .—This cape, also known as Ras Muari, is the western extremity of a sloping headland which rises to a pointed summit, at an elevation of about 460 feet (140 m 2), about 17 miles westward of Karachi harbour entrance, see West Coast of India Pilot. 15 Lakhi hills, a ridge with a nearly level crest, but on which are some remarkable hummocks, the highest rising to an elevation of 776 feet (236 m 5), extend in a north-easterly direction from Cape Monze {Lat. 24° 50' N., Long. 66° 39' £.), for a distance of about 10 miles; for about the first 3 miles eastward of the cape, the hills 20 slope down to the coast, but then turn inland and at about 5 miles farther eastward the coast becomes low. See view on chart 41. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 162 feet (49 m 4), from a black concrete tower, with white bands, 168 feet (51 m 2) in height, erected on the coast about one mile south-eastward of Cape Monze. 25 A shoal spit, over which there is a depth of 3^ fathoms (6 m 4), extends in a south-westerly direction, for a distance of about one mile, from the coast in the vicinity of the lighthouse. A small shoal, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies about 6 cables west-south-westward of Cape Monze. 30 Foul ground extends for a distance of about 6 cables offshore between the shoal spit and Cape Monze. Nancowry shoal, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), rock, lies about If miles south-westward of the lighthouse; and a spit, over which the depths are from 6| to 10 fathoms (ll m 9 to 18 m 3), 55 extends about 1^ miles further in that direction. Beauchamp reef, over which there is a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), Charts 38, 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF LAS BELA 59 Chart 41. coral, lies about 3^ miles westward of Cape Monze; foul ground, over which the depths are from 7 to 9 fathoms (12 m 8 to 16 m 5), extends about half a mile south-south-eastward and one mile north-north westward from the reef. Churma island, situated about 4 miles north-westward of Cape Monze, is about 580 feet (176 m 8) high; from southward, its almost precipitous light-coloured hills appear to rise to a peak, but from westward, it looks like a flat-topped hill with sloping sides. The island is steep-to, barren, and uninhabited; there is no fresh water on it. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), sand, at a distance of about 2 cables offshore, with the summit of Churma island bearing about 225°. On the northern side of Cape Monze is a small bay with a sandy beach to which descends a valley between the Lakhi ridge and some detached hills, about 560 feet (170 m 7) high. The seaward side of these hills, which extend to the mouth of the Hab river, is cliffy. Foul ground extends for a distance of about one mile offshore for over 2 miles northward of Cape Monze. Southward of Cape Monze, in depths greater than 20 fathoms (36 m 6), and eastward of it, in depths greater than 10 fathoms (18 m 3), the bottom is everywhere soft. Chart 38. Sonmiani bay. —This bay is entered between Cape Monze and Ras Kachari, situated about 60 miles north-westward. For the first 20 miles, the shore of the bay trends north-north-eastward and consists of a succession of small bays between rocky points; thence it trends north-westward and westward and, becoming sandy, is covered with small jungle, with sandhills here and there. Pab mountains rise, on the northern bank of the Hab river, about 10 miles north-eastward of Cape Monze and extend north-eastward and northward gradually increasing in elevation to over 3,000 feet (914 m 4). Westward of these mountains is a plain, about 35 miles wide, which extends to the foot of the Haro range. This plain is drained by the Purali river which flows through a swamp into the sea at the head of the bay. The Haro range trends north-north eastward from the northern shore of the bay, and at its southern end attains an elevation of about 3,150 feet (960 m l); these mountains are of light colour and irregular outline. Bela, the capital of the State of Las Bela, stands in the valley , distant about 65 miles by road, northward of Sonmiani {Lat. 25° 25'N., Long. 66° 35' E.), which latter is situated near the mouth and on the eastern bank of the Purali river. The depths in Sonmiani bay decrease regularly towards the head of the bay, there being depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) close to the bar at the mouth of the Purali river. Tidal streams. —In Sonmiani bay, the tidal streams are weak and set eastward and westward, following the curve of the land. Hab river. —This river rises in the mountains at the northern end of the Pab range, and, after a course of over 150 miles, reaches the sea about 3J miles north-north-eastward of Cape Monze. There is no fresh water within several miles of its mouth, except during freshets. The rocky hills on its southern side end about one mile 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chart 748b.60 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38. within its mouth, above which there is a plain on each side of the river, called the valley of the Hab, The northern side of the entrance of the river is low, and a sandy spit extends nearly across 5 the channel. A small isolated rocky hill stands on the northern side, at a short distance inland. The channel of the Hab river is tidal, and nearly dries; it has depths in it of 9 feet (2 m 7) at high water, and, usually, there are breakers across the entrance; it is only frequented by fishing boats. 10 The channel outside high-water mark shifts, but is practicable for a ship's boat. The tidal influence does not extend more than about 2 miles inside the mouth of the river. The vicinity of the mouth of the Hab has only been partially examined. 15 Coast.—Dangers. —From the northern entrance point of the Hab river, the coast trends northward for about 3 miles and is low; thence it continues northward, with an easterly bend, for about 5 miles to Chir Churna, a detached, square, rocky hill, about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, joined to the mainland by a low sandy isthmus. 20 A shoal, over which there is a depth of If fathoms (3 m 2), lies about H miles westward of the northern entrance point of the Hab river. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies close inshore about 3| miles northward of the If-fathom (3 m 2) shoal. 25 A sunken rock lies, about one mile offshore, at a distance of about 1^ miles northward of the 3-fathom (5 m 5) shoal. There are depths of from 4 to 6 fathoms (T^ to ll m 0) round both the 3-fathom (5 m 5) shoal and the sunken rock. A low rocky islet lies about three-quarters of a mile north-westward 30 of Chir Chuma, with depths of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) close seaward of it, and 5 fathoms (9 m l) between it and the land. North-north-eastward, and within a distance of about 6 miles, of Chir Chuma, are three small bays separated by high rocky points. Inland of the southernmost of these bays are backwaters, one of 35 which has an entrance close eastward of Chir Chuma; from these backwaters, the ground rises abruptly to the southem part of the Pab range. At about 8 miles north-north-eastward of Chir Chuma, the coast turns north-westward, and at a distance of about 16 miles farther is the entrance of Sonmiani harbour; it is hilly for the first 40 3 miles, and thence to the harbour consists of sand-hillocks covered with tufts of grass and small bushes. Chart 38, plan of Sonmiani harbour. Sonmiani. —This, the seaport of Bela, is a small town standing on the north-eastem shore of Miani hor, an extensive backwater 45 in which are a number of large creeks. The town {Lat. 25° 25' N Long. 66° 35' E.), is difficult of identification from seaward owing to its low position and dull appearance. The entrance of Sonmiani harbour is nearly 2 miles wide, and on the bar there is a depth of about 1J fathoms (2 m 3), though the 50 channel inside it has depths in it of from 3^ to 6 fathoms (5 m 9 to 11 m 0) close to the eastern entrance point where its width is about H cables. On approaching the town the depths in the channel decrease considerably. A shoal flat, on which the sea breaks heavily, extends nearly 2^ Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF LAS BELA 61 Chart 38, plan of Sonmidni harbour. miles outside the entrance, and through it winds the entrance channel; there are depths of 4 fathoms [l m 3) close to the outer edge of the shoal. The eastern entrance point is composed of sandy hillocks, thinly 5 covered with tamarisk bushes, and between it and the town is a mud flat which mostly dries and over which the Windar (Vindar) river, flowing south-westward, discharges during floods. The western entrance point consists of low bare sandhills. Westward of the harbour is a vast swamp, that extends within 10 the coastal sandhills almost to the foot of the Haro range, and at high water is partly covered. During heavy rains, the Purali river discharges into the northern part of the swamp, though, being dammed about 20 miles inland, its waters are usually absorbed in irrigation. 15 The harbour is only used by native craft. Vessels wishing to communicate should anchor off the bar, in a depth not less than 5 fathoms (9 m l), with Churma island bearing about 173°. It is advisable to engage a local fisherman as pilot to conduct even a ship's boat up to the town. 20 Chart 38. Coast.—Anchorage. —The shore of Sonmiani bay, from the western entrance point of Sonmiani harbour, trends westward for about 43 miles to Ras Kachari; it is low with sand-hillocks, on which are tufts of grass, to the Haro range, a distance of about 25 24 miles, whence it again is low to Chandragup (Darya cham), 13 miles farther westward. The depths offshore are regular, and the coast can be approached into a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0); the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies from one to 2 miles offshore. Phor river enters the sea about 33 miles westward of Sonmiani 30 harbour; its mouth is a small salt-water creek into which, during the rains, flows the river that drains the valley westward of the Haro range. Anchorage could be obtained, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), in the bay westward of the mouth of Phor river, but a depth of 35 3| fathoms (G 11 ^) is charted about 2| miles offshore, nearly 6 miles south-westward of the mouth of the river. Chandragup {Lat. 25° 26' N., Long. 65° 50' E.), the eastern of a detached group of low hills near the middle of the southern part of a plain extending westward from the Haro range for about 40 30 miles, is situated, about 2 miles inland, 4| miles west-north westward of the mouth of Phor river; it consists of several white conical hillocks, the highest of which attains an elevation of about 300 feet (Ol 1 ^). Aspect. —Ras Kachari, the western entrance point of Sonmiani 45 bay, is the south-eastern extremity of some low cliffs above which rise the detached group of hills of which Chandragup is the easternmost. Between the Haro range and Ras Malan, situated about 30 miles westward of Ras Kachari, the coast appears from seaward as a sue- 50 cession of rugged mountains, generally of light colour, with lower whitish-clay peaks, called 'shur'by the natives, in front of them. Jabal Hinglaj, 20 miles west-north-westward of Ras Kachari, and 8 miles inland, is about 3,500 feet (1006 m 8) high, and quoin-shaped; see Chart 748b.62 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38. view on chart 38. Gurangatti (Gorangati), 8 miles farther west- north-westward, with a valley between, is a conspicuous square- topped mountain, about 3,800 feet (IISS 11 ^) high, resembling a 6 castle with bastions, its sides appearing almost vertical. From Jabal Hinglaj, the Hala range, of irregular outline and with lower hills in front, trends east-north-eastward from 8 to 12 miles inland, until about 5 miles from the Haro range, where it turns north-north eastward, parallel with the latter. 10 Coast .—Shoal .—Westward of Ras Kachari, the coast is low, Jabal Gurab, situated near the coast about 2| miles westward of Ras Kachari, is small and oblong. A shoal bank extends seaward for a distance of about 2| miles from the coast in the vicinity of Jabal Gurab; there are depths of 15 6 fathoms (ll m 0) close to its outer edge. Jezirat Chahardam, situated on the coast about 3 miles westward of Jabal Gurab, consists of some rocks from 20 to 30 feet (6 m l to 9 m l) high, and somewhat higher than the neighbouring coast; there is good landing for a boat inside these rocks. From the rocks, the 20 coast continues low and trends westward for about 12 miles to Jabal Hab, a ridge of hills about 250 feet (76 m 2) high that descends to the coast and forms a small point about 2 miles farther westward. Hingol river, the mouth of which is situated about 2 miles east ward of Jabal Hab, can be entered at high water by small craft 25 drawing 6 feet (l m 8). Fresh water can always be obtained in the river, though at some distance from the sea. The bed of the river dries in many places. The river is about 140 miles in length, and during freshets brings down quantities of driftwood; it winds round the eastern side of Jabal Hinglaj, and through a gap in Jabal 30 Hab. Eastward of the river, the plain within the coastal sandhills is swampy after rain. Westward from Jabal Hab, low sandhills form the coast for a distance of about 12 miles to the cliffs of Ras Malan (Lat. 25° 19' N., Long. 65° 13' E.). 35 Ras Malan.—Anchorage. —This headland, situated about 14 miles west-south-westward of Jabal Hab, is a prominent bluff with a steep face on its seaward side and a level summit of clay capped with impure limestone. The highest part, about 4 miles northward of the bluff, attains an elevation of about 2,050 feet (624 m 8), with 40 cliffs rising to it abruptly from the sea, there being no beach. Great masses of clay, detached from the mountain side, frequently fall. From seaward, the bluff appears as a long light-coloured table-land ending in cliffs; between it and Jabal Hinglaj is a confused mass of lower hills and shur. There is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) at 45 a distance of about one mile off the bluff. The locality is waterless and uninhabited. Anchorage may be obtained in the bay eastward of Ras Malan, in depths of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), at a distance of about one mile offshore, with Gurangatti bearing about 000°, and Ras Malan 230°, 50 but the depths appear to shoal close inshore of this position. Coast. —For a distance of about 19 miles westward of Ras Malan the coast is cliffy; thence it is low and sandy for about 15 miles to Ormara isthmus, with a plain inland. The high land westward Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF LAS BELA 63 Chart 38. of Ras Malan, known as Batt, is divided 7 miles from the point by the Hor Batt, a salt-water lagoon, with a sandy bar between it and the sea, into which a great water-course runs through a gorge in the mountains. The mountains become lower westward of the hor. 5 The plain westward of Batt extends some 10 miles inland to the Talo (Tallu) hills, a range running eastward to Gurangatti in several ridges nearly parallel with the coast. On this plan, northward of the eastern point of Ras Ormara, and 4 miles from the sea, is Chandra kup, a conspicuous white cone about 600 feet (182m9) 10 high, with a mud crater. Khor Maniji, 20 miles westward of Ras Malan, is shallow; but, for a short time after rains, it becomes the mouth of a small river.' Khor Gurad, about 5 miles farther westward, is similar; both are visited by native boats. 25 Ras Ormara.—Communications.— This mountainous peninsula is 1,400 feet (426 m 7) high; the top slopes gently eastward and southward, and ends on all sides in cliffs; from southward, the peninsula appears wedge-shaped. It is of similar geological' for mation to the other ranges on the coast, and is only accessible with 20 great difficulty. The sandy isthmus connecting the middle of the peninsula to the mainland projects about 5 miles southward from the coast; it is nearly 1-| miles wide, and on its southern part is Ormara village. Northward of the village, there are high sandhills in the middle of the isthmus, but the beach on each side is low. 25 Two rocks are reported to exist about cables south-westward of the south-western extremity of Ras Ormara. There are depths of 6 fathoms (11^0) close to the cliffs, and 20 fathoms at 7 miles southward of them. Ormara village, situated on the eastern beach of the isthmus, so about one mile from the cliffs, consists of a few stone houses and mosques, and some mat huts, inhabited chiefly by fishermen. There is a small trade by sea with Karachi. There is a telegraph office on the isthmus, about one mile westward of Ormara village, see page 29. 35 For steamship communications, see page 28. Demi zar. —Demi zar or Ormara East bay, is the usual anchorage for vessels visiting Ormara. It has a sandy bottom, except near the cliffs, and is shallow off the village, from which the anchorage, in 31 fathoms (6 m 4), is distant about 2| miles. The eastern point 40 of the peninsula, about 500 feet (152 m 4) high, bears from this anchorage 151°, and the telegraph office about 261°. The depths shoal regularly when entering the bay, and the eastern bluff point may be approached to a distance of about half mile. The beach dries a long way off the village, making landing inconvenient at 45 low water; a shoal extends from the northern side of the cliffs of Ras Ormara {Lat. 25° 11' N., Long. 64° 40' E.). The bay is open to easterly winds, which blow strongly at intervals from December to February. During the south-west monsoon there usually occurs at least one blow from eastward, with rain, 50 which is not of long duration; Padi zar is then the best anchorage! though communication with the shore is more tedious. Native craft appear always to ride out these breezes. In the south-west monsoon, and at any time after April, a long swell sets round the Chart 748b.64 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38. point into Demi zar, raising a surf on the beach and causing vessels at anchor to roll heavily. The tidal streams in the bay are weak, and set north-eastward 5 and south-westward following the curve of the land. Padi zar. —Padi zar or Ormara West bay is nearly 8 miles across its entrance between the western extremity of the peninsula and the high cliffs of Ras Sakanni west-north-westward; the shores are low and sandy; at its head, and about 5 miles from the village, 10 is a small rocky hill near the coast. The bay is seldom visited, being open south -westward and westward. Depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found within 3 miles of the eastern and northern shores of the bay. The anchorage is with the western extremity of the peninsula bearing about 180°. 15 Coast. —From Ras Sakanni, the coast of Las Bela trends west- north-west ward for a distance of about 20 miles to Khor Kalmat. Between Ras Sakanni and Ras Basol, a distance of about 10 miles, the coast consists of continuous cliffs, about 800 feet (243 m 8) high, of light colour and irregular outline, without any marked peak; 20 the cliffs are the sea face of the Kamgar hills, between which and the Talo range is a wide plain. There are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) at about one mile from these cliffs, and the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line lies about 8 miles offshore. Ras Basol is the point at the western end of the cliffs. The bay 25 between Ras Basol and Khor Kalmat is shallow, the 3-fathom (5 iri 5) line being nearly 5 miles from its low sandy shore, which latter is probably invisible at that distance. At about 2 miles north-westward of Ras Basol is the mouth of Basol river, a large water-course rising in the mountains of the 30 Kolwa district and flowing from the interior between the Talo and Talar ranges. The land about its mouth, is swampy and very low. The Talar hills trend east-north-eastward from about 10 miles north-westward of the entrance of Khor Kalmat, and approach the western part of the Talo hills. 35 Khor Kalmat. —This, the largest inlet on the coast, has depths of 5 and 6 fathoms (9 m l to ll 11 ^) in it; it is of considerable width, but on the bar there is a depth of only 2 feet (0 m 6). The entrance is rendered difficult by rocks lying upwards of one mile outside the bar, and the tidal streams in the entrance are strong. The land 40 near the entrance is very low, with mangrove swamps. Native craft of 9 feet (2 II1 7) draught are reported to enter the inlet by the eastern of the two channels over the bar. Inside the bar there are depths of from 4 to 7 fathoms (7 m 3 to 12 m 8). At some distance inside the inlet are four creeks, which, beyond the range of the 45 tides, form the mouths of water-courses. Tad, situated on the western side of the khor, contains about seven houses, the only permanent habitations in the neighbourhood. The water supply is scanty and very brackish. A small quantity of dwarf palm in its raw state, lime, and mangrove wood is exported; 50 piece goods and grain are imported. COAST OF MAKRAN. —The coast of Makran extends in a general westerly direction from Khor Kalmat (La/. 25° 19' N., Long. 64° 04' E.) to the frontier of Persian Makran, a distance Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF MAKRAN 65 Chart 38. of nearly 140 miles; it is chiefly an uninhabited desert, in places swampy. Water is everywhere scarce, and that which is obtainable is bad; very few supplies can be had from the villages. From Khor Kalmat, the coast trends westward, and for the first 5 12 miles is low with a shoal extending for a distance of about 3 miles seaward from it; thence, gradually becoming higher, it is backed for the next 18 miles by a number of shur (whitish clay hills); it then trends southward for about 6 miles to Ras Jaddi. Until near the town of Pasni, situated about 3 miles north-westward of Ras 10 Jaddi, the coast is barren; but there are two small water-courses, usually dry, about 18 and 22 miles, respectively, westward of Khor Kalmat, and there is a small boat harbour about 3 miles westward of the western water-course. Shadi kh5r is a large shallow creek with swampy banks, the 15 entrance of which is situated about 2 miles north-eastward of Pasni; on the southern side of the mouth of the creek is a projecting point, and drying banks extend about 6 cables offshore. A river, which breaks through the hills northward of Pasni, flows into the head of the khor. At about one mile up the river are the ruins of a large 20 and ancient town, said to be those of the city of Pesani. Boats can enter the khor at high water. Astola island.—This island, known to the Baloch as Haptalar, to the Meds as Astalu, to the Arabs as Astalo, and to the Hindus as Satadip, is situated about 16 miles south-westward of the entrance 25 of Khor Kalmat; it is table-topped with cliffs all round, and there is a partly detached hill at its western end, 260 feet (78 m 2) high, that is a little higher than the rest of the island. The cliff rises vertically from the sea, except on the northern side of the island, where, about the middle, there is a little sandy point, and, at the 30 north-western corner, where there is a sandy spit and a small boat harbour. The island is without water. There are rocky ledges off both ends and some detached rocks above water along the southern coast, but all are less than 2 cables from the cliffs [Lat. 25° 06' NLong. 63° 50' E.). 35 Astola island is covered with a luxuriant growth of rank grass and low shrubs, and abounds with small venomous snakes, called 'gar' by the natives. The Arabs from Muscat frequent the place for turtle catching, and the Pasni fishermen for gwahtag fishing, the latter being an excellent fish which abounds there. They also 40 visit the island to collect the sea-birds' eggs, which are found in enormous quantities on the cliffs, at the end of the cold weather. The island is held in extreme veneration by the Hindus, and pilgrims from all parts visit it in small but increasing numbers; 45 on the south-eastern side of the top of the island is a small open shrine made of rough stones. The Pasni Meds hold several places in the island sacred, and on a detached rock at the north-western extremity are said to be the footprints of Duldul, the horse of Ali; on the beach close to this rock is an enclosure, dressed with red 50 flags, and dedicated to the Khwaja Khizr, the patron saint of the Meds. Here the Meds are wont to take omens at the beginning of each fishing season. The landing place generally used by pilgrims is at the north-eastern Chart 7m. 5400 cg0 approaches to Persian gulf [Chap. III. point Of the island; the ascent from it is steep and tortuous, and after heavy rain it sometimes becomes almost impassable, the ascent and descent having then to be effected by the aid of ropes. , 5 Off-lying dangers .-Directions. -Webb bank which was dis covered when the telegraph cable was being laid in 1864 and named after the engineer -in-charge, is a rocky patch situated about 5 miles south-south -eastward of Astola island. A depth of fat cms jfjnm has been found on the bank, but that may not be the least; m the sea breaks on the bank during the south-west monsoon. Sail rock (Lat. 25° 05' N..

A wide berth should, therefore, be given to this locality. _ . j . i, x 11 &lt; 1.1, Two shoals, over each of which there is a depth of 1J fathoms (2 m 7) lie close together with their outer edges about 1| miles 25 northward of Astola island; the western shoal is connected to the island by a bank and the eastern shoal nearly so; their northern sides are steep-to, and there is no passage between them and the coast of the island except for boats. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 21 fathoms (4^6), lies nearly 2 miles north-eastward 30 of the eastern end of the island, and is steep-to; a 2^-fathom (4 m l) patch lies between it and the island. .. , i ^ , There is a clear channel, about 7 miles wide, between the shoals extending southward from the mainland and those northward of Astola with depths in it of from 5 to 8 fathoms (9 m l to 14 m 6), sand, 55 rock, ind shells; depths of 4 fathoms (7^3) are charted for about 8 miles southward of the coast just westward of Khor Kalmat. The depth between Astola and Ras Jaddi varies from 7 to 10 fathoms (12 m 8 to 18 m 3), but there are depths of 4 fathoms (7 in 3) at 2 miles off that point, and a detached 5-fathom (9 m l) rocky patch lies about 40 11 miles eastward of it. If proceeding northward of Astola., which should not be done at night, except under favourable conditions, vessels should give it a berth of 4 miles to avoid the outlying shoals. Pasni.—Anchorage.—Communications. —This town, situated 45 on the low western shore of the bay northward of Ras Jaddi, is of considerable importance owing to its proximity to Turbat, the headquarters of the Makran administration, situated about 70 miles north -north-westward, but the majority of the inhabitants are fishermen. 50 A small fort, two mosques, and a bungalow which serves as the post and telegraph office are the only permanent buildings, the rest of the town consisting of mat huts. It is the seaport of Kulanch, a district of Makran, extending about 120 miles westward from Kalmat, and is the headquarters Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF MAKRAN 67 Chart 38. of the Naib of Kulanch. The general depths in the bay are from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to 9 m l). With the exception of a few date trees southward of the town, there is no vegetation in the neighbourhood; south-westward 5 of the town is a mass of high white sandhills, and northward of these, are a number of shur. Wool, ghi, cotton, dates, and mats are exported; piece goods, grain, and miscellaneous articles are imported. The only industries are fishing and fish-curing. 10 Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of about 3^ fathoms (6 m 4), sand, at a distance of about miles offshore, with the town bearing 270°, and Ras Jaddi about 194°, or farther out in depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3). After the month of April, there is considerable surf on the shore of 15 the bay rendering landing difficult. For Meteorological tables, see page 283. There is a bridle path from Pasni to Turbat and Panjshir. Postal and telegraphic facilities are available to all parts, see page 29. For steamship communications, see page 28. 20 Coast. —Ras Jaddi is a small projection from which a rocky spit, with depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) close off it, extends for a distance of about half a mile. Between Ras Jaddi [Lat. 25° 13' N., Long. 63° 30' E) and the point about miles southward, on which is Jabal Zarrain, is a 25 small bay about cables inland of which is a group of clay hills of fantastic shape and about 150 feet (45 m 7) high. Jabal Zarrain is about 400 feet (121 in 9) high, brown in colour, ajid conspicuous; its shape is similar to that of a bam, especially when seen on easterly or westerly bearings; on northerly bearings, 30 it appears as a long notched ridge with sloping ends: at a distance, it appears detatched as the land round it is low; it is steep-to, and there are depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to 9 in l) at a distance of about one mile offshore. See view on chart 38. From Jabal Zarrain, the coast trends westward for about 10 miles 35 and then curves north-westward, westward, and south-westward for about 13 miles, forming Ras Shamal bandar, a bay of which Ras Shamal is the western entrance point; the coast is low, and in the bay shoal water extends offshore for a distance of about 1| miles. Fishing boats and small vessels sometimes take shelter 40 from westerly winds in the western part of the bay. The coast appears to be desert, but at a short distance inland it is fertile in places, yielding corn and cotton. Chakuli kuh, a range of mountains about 1,400 feet (426 m 7) high, is a westerly continuation of the Talar hills and lies, parallel 45 with the coast, from 9 to 12 miles inland. Ras Shamal is a bluff, and is the first high land near the coast westward of Jabal Zarrain; it should not be approached into depths less than 6 fathoms (l^O) as a reef, the outer edge of which is steep-to, extends offshore for a distance of about one mile, 50 Ras Shahid is situated about o-| miles west-south-westward of Ras Shamal. Depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) will be found about one mile offshore. The coast eastward to Ras Shamal, and westward for about 13| Chart 748b.68 approaches to persian gulf [Chap. III. mites to Ras Kapar, consists of a long jagged ridge of precipitous white clay hills, from 400 to 500 feet (121 m 9 to l52^4) high, rising at a short distance inland with low ground behind them; except 5 in a few places, at low water there is no beach on this stretch of coast Between 6 and 9 miles westward of Ras bhahid, there are three gaps in the hills, through one of which the Sawar river flows into a large salt -water creek. ^ ki + ^ v,-ii w Ras Kapar is the southern extremity of a table-topped hill with 10 bluff ends, nearly 800 feet (243^8) high, situated at the western end of and partly detached from, the hills extending westward from Ras Shahid; it projects but little from the line of the coast. There are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) at a distance of about 3 cables from the point. Kapar is a small village close to the coast near 15 th From n Ras Kapar, the coast trends westward for about 15 miles to a little sandy bay on the southern side of which is Ras Sur; it is sandy and rises to low hills, principally shur Kiih Chilari, which is separated from the Chakuli kuh by the on Sawar river valley, extends westward from a position about 11 miles north-north-eastward of Ras Kapar, and is continued west ward by the Kuh i Daram. Mukh, the summit of the latter range, situated about 17 miles north-westward of Ras Kapar, is a conspicuous peak about 3,200 feet (975^4) high, and Barn peak, 5 miles eastward 25 of it, is 3,152 feet (960 m 7) high. Lower clay hills rise m front of these mountains. _ , u , , Kiih Dimak, 6 miles westward of Ras Kapar, and a short distance inland, is small, of darkfer colour than the other hills in the locality, and has several little paps on its summit. 30 Karwat river, about 9 miles westward of Ras Kapar, is only a small stream; it is the eastern boundary of the Gwadar territory. Shoal water extends from half a mile to one mile off the coast between Ras Kapar and Ras Sur. Chart 38, plan of Gwddar hay. 35 Gwadar head.—Aspect. —This rocky peninsula is connected to the mainland by a low, narrow, sandy isthmus on which stands the town of Gwadar (La*. 25° 07' N., Long. 62° 19' E.), and on either side of which are Demi zax and Padi zar, two sandy ba.ys. The headland is faced on all sides with cliffs and its summit slopes 40 down from the highest bluff, which is about 480 feet (146™3) high and is situated at the southern end of the western side of the isthmus. See view on plan on chart 38. Ras Nuh, the eastern extremity of the headland, is a bluff about 280 feet (85 m 3) high on which are two buildings, the eastern being 45 a small conical mosque or tomb close to the edge of the cliff. With its high white bluffs, the headland is conspicuous on westerly bearings and then appears as a quoin-shaped island; on northerly and north easterly bearings it is not so remarkable, but appears darker in colour than the land behind it. See view on chart 38. 50 Bandar Hairan, situated about three quarters of a mile south- westward of Ras Nuh, is a small bay frequented by fishing boats; the cliffs in the vicinity of the bay are low and the beach is of sand. Ras Kamaiti, the western extremity of the headland, is a cliff about 70 feet (21 m 3) high. A small white tomb on the southern Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF MAKRAN 69 Chart 38, plan of Gwddar hay. edge of the cliff, about half a mile eastward of Ras Kamaiti, is conspicuous on northerly bearings when the sun is shining on it. Ras Sur, the northern entrance point of Demi zar, is a small quoin-shaped white clay hill, 560 feet (170 m 7) high, rising steeply 5 with a vertical cliff at its eastern end; the isthmus connecting it to the mainland is low and sandy; see view on chart 38. Jabal Mehdi, a precipitous white clay ridge with vertical cliffs on its southern side, rises abruptly from the plain at the root of the isthmus and extends westward for about 4 miles from a position 10 about 2 miles westward of Ras Sur, the land between Ras Sur and Jabal Mehdi being low. The outline of the ridge is very remarkable; the highest peak, 1,375 feet (419 m l) high, is in the form of a sugar- loaf at its eastern end; the Asse's ears, 2 miles westward, is a curious double peak, 1,360 feet (414^5) high [Lat. 25° 12'N., Long. 62 0 23' E.). 15 From eastward, this ridge, as also Ras Sur and Gwadar head, appears detached. See view on chart 38. Chart 38. Kuh i Daram is a range of mountains lying parallel with the coast, about 12 miles inland, that, decreasing in height westward, 20 ends abruptly in Garr, a remarkable notch or rather two great vertical steps descending from a height of 1,550 feet (472 m 4), about 20 miles west-north-westward of Ras Sur, and forming a good landmark. A wide plain extends from the foot of Kuh i Daram to Jabal Mehdi, and to the root of the isthmus of Gwadar; in this plain, which is 25 cultivated, are some scattered villages. Kuh Saiji is the summit of a mountain range, extending in an easterly and westerly direction about 20 miles inland, the peaks of which there attain an elevation of 3,260 feet (993 m 7). Chart 38, plan of Gwddar hay. gQ Danger.—Directions. —A rocky spit, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) and close outside which there are depths of from 6 to 10 fathoms (11^0 to 18^3), extends in a southerly direction for about 9 cables from a low rocky point about one- quarter of a mile southward of Ras Nuh. 25 The eastern peak of Jabal Mehdi bearing 005° leads about one mile eastward of the spit, and the south-western extremity of Gwadar head bearing 285° leads about one mile southward of it. Vessels approaching from westward should not get into depths less than 12 fathoms (21 m 9) until Ras Nuh bears less than 350°, par- 40 ticularly in hazy weather. There is usually a ripple over the spit and, during the south-west- monsoon, it is marked by breakers. There is a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l) about 3 cables eastward of Ras Nuh. Vessels from eastward should keep in depths of from 10 to 15 45 fathoms (18 m 3 to 27 m 4); even if hazy, it would scarcely be possible to pass Gwadar head in these depths without seeing it. Vessels approaching from southward should beware of the tidal streams, and the position should be frequently checked. In hazy weather vessels not bound to Gwadar should keep in 50 depths greater than 20 fathoms (36 m 6). At night a good look-out should be kept for fishing boats and canoes with their nets. The tidal streams off Gwadar head set eastward and westward. Chart 748h.&gt;jq APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III.

Anchorage.—Directions.— Anchorage may be obtained in Gwadar bay with the telegraph office at Gwadar bearing between 262 and 30 250° as close in as the draught of the vessel will permit, the closer the better, both to facilitate communication with the town and to obtain smoother water. ... Approaching from southward or westward, from a position about 4miles southward of Ras Nuh, with the western end of Jabal Mehdi 35 ridge bearing less than 348 c and open eastward of Ras Nuh, the eastern peak of the ridge may be steered for, bearing less than 005 , until Ras Nuh is abeam, whence course may be shaped for the anchorage as convenient. Gwadar.— This town, once the principal port on the Makran 40 coast, is situated near the southern end of the sandy isthmus con necting Gwadar head to the mainland. Most of the dwellings are mat huts, but a number of mud and stone buildings, amongst which is a conspicuous mosque, are grouped round a square fort with a high tower. Northward of the town is the telegraph office, a large 45 block of buildings, and at about half a mile farther northward is the Wali's fort with its flagstaff, which must not be mistaken for the telegraph office. The Wali s fort is a large white square building, conspicuous either from eastward or westward. The flagstaff is erected on the south-eastern comer of the roof and its truck is about 50 100 feet (30 m 5) above the ground. At about midway between the Wali's fort and the telegraph office are two W/T masts, each 70 feet {21 m 3) in height, but they are not conspicuous from eastward or westward as they are partially obscured by trees. In the Chart 748b.chap, nr.] GWADAR 71 Chart 38, plan of Gwddar hay. neighbourhood of the town, there are a few date palms and banyan trees. The town and district, the coast of which latter extends from the mouth of Karwat river to the neighbourhood of Ras Pishukan, 5 see below, is administered by an Arab Wali representing the Sultan of Muscat. The inhabitants are chiefly fisherfolk. There are no jetties nor any convenience for landing goods, except in native boats. Ghi, wool, goats' hair, hides, cotton, salt-fish, fins, dates, pish 10 leaves, and mats are exported; cotton piece goods, silk, sugar, rice, iron, juari, and kerosene are imported. The water supply is small in quantity and indifferent in quality. A few sheep, chickens, and when in season, some fruit and vegetables may usually be obtained; fish is plentiful and good. A British Political Agent resides at Gwddar. A British-Indian post and telegraph office is situated in the telegraph buildings, see page 29. For steamship communications, see page 28. Chart 38, with plan of Gwddar bay. 20 Gwadar West bay.—Anchorage.— This bay, also called Padi zar, is entered between Ras Kamaiti and Ras Pishukan, situated about 9| miles westward. Shoal water extends for a distance of about half a mile southward of Ras Kamaiti [Lat. 25° 06' N., Long. 62° 15' E.), but the north- 25 western side of the point is steep-to; depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found nearly 2| miles offshore on the western side of Gwadar isthmus, which latter forms the eastern shore of the bay. With the exception of Kiih Toshdan, a small range of low hills on the coast about 7 miles northward of Ras Pishukan, the shores 30 of the bay are low. Near Kiih Toshdan is a fort. Khor Ankara, at the head of the bay eastward of Kuh Toshdan, is small and near it the land is marshy. Depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found within miles of the northern and 2\ miles of the western shores of the bay. From .35 about 8 fathoms (l^e) in the entrance, the depths in the bay decrease regularly shorewards. The small village of Pishukan is situated on the western side of the bay about 4 miles north-north-westward of Ras Pishukan, Anchorage may be obtained in Gwadar West bay, at about 2| miles 40 offshore, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7^3), sand, with Ras Kamaiti bearing 198', and the telegraph office at Gwadar bearing 090°; or, on the western side of the bay, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) with Ras Pishukan bearing 182°, distant about 3 miles. Chart 38. 45 Coast. —Ras Pishukan consists of narrow rocky cliffs about 20 feet (6 m l) high, and a rocky spit, on which the sea breaks, extends for a distance of about 3£ cables south-eastward from it. The headland is said to be the western limit of Gwadar territory, but the frontier has not been permanently defined. ' 50 From Ras Pishukan, the coast of Makran trends westward for about 12 miles and is low; it then turns southward for about 4 miles, to Ras Ganz, and consists of a succession of rocky cliffy points sep arated by sandy beaches. Chart 748b.approaches to Persian gulf [Chap. III. fa $8 Bandar Ganz, between Ras Pishukan and Ras Ganz, affords shelter, during westerly winds, to small vessels m depths of from 3 to 4 fathoms (5 m 5 to 7^3) at about one mile offshore. 5 Ganz is a small village of mat huts on the coast about 4 miles northward of Ras Ganz; a small white-washed mosque is the only ^rGanz^s'orfight colour and about 200 feet (Ol-'O) high; it is the bluff eastern point of Katagar promontory, and is conspicuous 10 from westward but not so from eastward. „ , , Katagar promontory separates Bandar Ganz from Gwatar bay, it is 454 feet high and its southern coast trends west-south- westward from Ras Ganz for about miles to Ras Jiunri. This side of the promontory is an almost unbroken line of elm with, here i5 and there, sandy beaches at its foot. Ras Garnan, situated about 2 miles eastward of Ras Jiunri, is about 20 feet (6 m l) high, and projects about half a mile southward beyond the line of the higher cliffs. Singular hills with rugged peaks, and amongst which are pillars 20 of clay, rise at a short distance inland and extend nearly to the Dasht river, see page 73; northward of these hills is the great plain or valley of the Dasht. , In depths less than 10 fathoms (18^3), the bottom off Katagar promontory is very uneven. 25 Chart 38, plan of Gwatar hay. ^ Ras Jiunri.— Shoals.— This point is formed by a cliff about 100 feet (30 m 5) high. A spit appears to dry for a distance of about one cable from its western extremity. A shoal patch, over which there is a depth of 6 fathoms (U 11 ^), 30 was discovered by H.M.S. Sphinx, in 1891, in a position about 3£ miles south-eastward of Ras Jiunri, see chart 38. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2| fathoms (_4 m 6), rock and sand, lies about 1^ miles south-eastward of Ras Jiunri; it is of considerable extent in an easterly and westerly direction, and 35 there is a depth of 7 fathoms (12 Da 8) between it and the coast. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), lies about one mile westward of the western extremity of Ras Jiunri and, for a distance of about miles northward of the point, a reef extends about half a mile offshore. 40 There are several shoal patches northward of the 2-fathom (3 m 7) shoal, and depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) have been reported within about 1J miles of the coast northward of Ras Jiunri. Gwatar bay. —This bay is entered between Ras Jiunri {Lat. 25° 00' NLong. 61° 42' E.) and Ras Fastah, situated about 45 15| miles west-north-westward. The eastern shore of the bay is cliffy for about 3£ miles northward of Ras Jiunri, beyond which it is sandy with rocky hills rising at a short distance inland. At the head of the bay, which is low, are several creeks and mangrove swamps extending some miles inland. The eastern shore is a 50 succession of bluff points, separated by sandy beaches behind which the land rises to table-topped hills. The hills near the eastern shore of the bay are of even outline; but behind them are others of fantastic shape, the highest, in the form of a remarkable pillar, being very conspicuous. Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF MAKRAN 73 Chart 38, plan of Gwatar bay. Kuh Drab hoi, chart 38, northward of the middle of the bay and about 9 miles inland, is a detached table-topped hill, about 500 feet (152 m 4) high, with sloping sides. The depths in the bay, over a mud bottom, decrease regularly 5 from about 6 fathoms (ll m 0) at the entrance, but they are reported to be less than charted. Ras Fastah, the eastern extremity of a detached ridge extending westward along the coast for a distance of about 6 miles, is a cliff 45 feet (13 m 7) high. On the northern side of Ras Fastah is a small 10 bay affording shelter to native craft in depths of from li to 3 fathoms (2 m 7 to 5 m 5), mud. Castle hill, situated about 3| miles north-westward of Ras Fastah, is square, rocky, and 430 feet (131 m l) high; its summit, seen over the lower hills in front of it, resembles a fort. See view on chart 15 38. It does not, however, show until bearing less than about 340°. South islet and North islet, lying about one mile north-eastward of Ras Fastah, are two small rocks situated close together on a reef off which foul ground extends for about 4 cables; the higher islet is 108 feet (32 m 9) high. It is reported that there is a channel, 20 between the islets and the point, in which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3). Rivers.— Khor Jiunri is the easternmost creek at the head of Gwatar bay {Lat. 25° 07' NLong. 61° 44' E.). Khor Dasht, situated almost in the centre of the head of Gwatar 25 bay, is the mouth of the Dasht river, the largest river on this coast; the river is formed by the junction, in the Kej valley, of the Ni'hing and Kej rivers, whence it flows south-westward through the district of Dasht, and finally, passes eastward of Kuh Drabhol into the head of the khor. The mouth of the kh5r is about 2 cables wide, 30 between flat sandy banks almost level with the sea, on which the latter breaks during the south-west monsoon. The bar and breakers extend about one mile southward of the shore. The passage over the bar is on the eastern side of the breakers. A depth of 4 feet (l m 2) can be obtained by keeping a grass-covered sandhill, situated 35 near the shore on the western side of the entrance, in line with the o third distant peak westward of Kuh Drabhol range, bearing 338 . Course should not be altered up the river until the sandy spit on the eastern bank is well clear of the eastern extremity of Kiih Drabhol. For the first two miles there is a channel close to each 40 bank; but the eastern bank should be followed. Above this the deeper water is on the concave sides of the bends in the river. At 10 or 11 miles from the entrance, is a caravan ford where the depth is only 2 feet (0 m 6), the tidal rise being from 2 to 3 feet (0 m 6 to 0 m 9) • No villages or natives were observed during the ascent of a 45 party from H.M.S. Pyramus , in 1926, until near the ford. The river is tidal for about 12 miles from its mouth; in places it decreases in width to about half a cable and there, when the river is in flood, the depths are from 2 to 3| fathoms (3 m 7 to 6 m 4). Dashtiari Chil river, which flows into the bay close to Gwatar village, 50 is the mouth.of two combined streams; it has a shallow bar, but is deep inside, and is tidal for some distance. The position of the entrance can be identified from a distance by the masts of the dhows anchored within. The only landing for boats is within the entrance. Chart 748b. 540074 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38, plan of Gwatar hay. , After rain, the water is fresh some miles up the river. There are some creeks in the head of the bay between Khor Dasht and the mouth of Dashtiari Chil river. 5 Villages. —Jiunri village, consists of two groups of mat huts, situated on low rocky cliffs on the eastern shore of Gwatar bay, about 2| miles northward of Ras Jiunri, and a third group on that point. The inhabitants are chiefly employed in shark fishing. Partridge, hare, and gazelle shooting can be had. 10 There is good landing, even during the south-west monsoon swell, in a bay about \\ miles northward of the western extremity of Ras Jiunri. At the head of this bay, and half a mile inland, is a white rectangular stone fort. The coastline of this part, as charted, appears to be only approximately correct. 15 Gwatar village {Lat. 25° 09'N., Long. 61° 29' E.), consisting of some mat huts, is situated near the mouth of the Dashtiari Qui river, in which latter the inhabitants, mostly fishermen, keep their boats. There is a conspicuous white fort with two towers on the western side of the village. Between it and the river is a small 20 round tower with a tall and conspicuous flagstaff, from which the Persian flag was flown during the stay of the H.M.S. Espiegle in April, 1923. Scarcely any supplies can be obtained either at Gwatar or at Jiunri, and there is very little trade. Chart 38. 25 PERSIAN MAKRAN— Coast.— The coast of Persian Makran extends from the Perso-Kalat frontier in Gwatar bay, westward for about 210 miles to Jask. In places it is low, with ranges of mountains at some distance inland, but there are many high rocky points and hills near the coast. The country, though barren, is not absolutely 30 desert. There are a number of villages or settlements, but no town of importance, and the population is scanty. Supplies are meagre. Navigation along this coast during the south-west monsoon is much impeded by the land being frequently obscured by haze, soundings being then the only guide. Due to this haze, when only 35 about 5 miles offshore and in depths less than 10 fathoms (18 m 3), it is often necessary to obtain the position of the vessel by observations of the heavenly bodies. The haze appears to set in about the end of April. During the north-east monsoon the weather is usually clear. 40 Gwatar flat .—Shoal .—There is a remarkable flat outside Gwatar bay, which is a useful guide at night or in thick weather; the 10- fathom (18 m 3) line lies about 10 miles, the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line, 17 miles, and the 100-fathom (182 m 9) line, 19 miles, south-south eastward of Ras Fastah. The bottom is of white clay, very tenacious £5 and gritty. The evenness of the flat and the bottom in the bay are probably due to silt brought down by the Dasht and other rivers. After heavy rain, the water over the whole flat becomes discoloured, and much drift wood is seen. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 4J fathoms (7 m 8), lies 50 about 1J miles south-westward of Ras Fastah. Coast. —From Ras Fastah, the coast trends west-north-westward for about 15 miles to Ras Bris; for about 6 miles from Ras Fastah it is cliffy; then there is a low gap of about 2 miles where the Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF PERSIAN MAKRAN 75 Chart 38. beach recedes for a short distance, and for the remaining 7 miles there are vertical white cliffs with a level summit about 200 feet (61 m 0) high. From about 3 miles westward of Ras Fastah, the coast is fringed with a shoal gradually increasing in width until at 5 Ras Bris its outer edge lies about one mile offshore. Ras Bris {Lat. 25° 08' NLong. 61° 10' E.) is at the western end of the white cliffs; north-eastward of and detached from the latter is a range of white clay hills with very remarkable peaks; both Ras Bris and the range behind are conspicuous, see view on chart 10 38. Bris, situated about miles north-eastward of Ras Bris, is a small fishing village on the shore of a bay on the northern side of the cape. Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), 15 sand, in the middle of this bay; the depths shoal gradually shore ward. From the northern side of the bay, the coast trends west-north westward for about 18 miles to Siyah kuh and is low and sandy. _ Siyah kuh, about 1,000 feet (304 m 8) high, is a dark round hill, 20 situated close to the coast, with cliffs on its seaward side. From Ras Bris to about 3 miles eastward of Siyah kuh, the 5-fathom (9 m l) line appears to lie about 1^ miles offshore, but depths of 6 fathoms (ll m 0) have been obtained about half a mile westward of Ras Bris. 25 Kochu is a very small settlement about 12 miles westward of Bris; but there is a large village on the coast, about 1J miles east- south-eastward of Siyah kuh, that is not shown on the chart. Kinj Dap is a gap in the coastal hills on the western side of Siyah kuh through which runs a small watercourse of the same name; the 30 mouth of the stream is probably usually barred by sand, but after heavy rains in the interior it becomes open; at its mouth is a grove of acacia trees and on its left bank, about 2| miles from the sea, is the village of Kinj. From Kinj Dap, the coast trends west-north-westward for about 35 13 miles to Chahbar point, and consists of rocky hills and cliffs gradually decreasing in elevation towards the point. Inland of these coastal hills, a vast plain extends westward for many miles. Kaki kuh, situated north-eastward of Siyah kuh and about 9 miles inland, rises to an elevation of about 2,000 feet (609 m 6), 40 see view on chart 38. The range extends for some miles eastward and westward, and its southern face is vertical; its crest is deeply indented, and when seen from westward presents a double peak with a bluff south-eastward of it; being composed of white clay it is conspicuous when the sun shines upon it. 45 Between Ras Bris and Chahbar point, the bottom inside the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line is mud. Chart 38, plan of Chdhhdr hay. Chahbar bay.—Light.— This bay is entered between Chahbar point and Ras Kuhlab, situated about 7| miles westward. 50 Chahbar point is low and rocky and on it are some small sand hills; near its extremity is a small square tomb with a white dome, about one mile east-north-eastward of which are two dark flat-topped buildings, one of which is the telegraph office, that assist in identi- Chart 748b.76 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38, plan of Chdhhdr hay. fying the point. A reef extends for about 3 cables westward of the point, and for a distance of about one cable farther the bottom is foul. 5 A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 36 feet (ll m 0), from the roof of the telegraph office. Ras Kuhlab is the extremity of a promontory the sides of which consist of low cliffs. Within Chahbar bay, and on the northern side of the promontory, is a cliffy point, 270 feet (82 m 3) high, situated 10 about 2| miles north-westward of Ras Kuhlab; there is a small village on the cliffs southward of the point, but it is not visible from seaward. For the first 4 miles within the entrance points, the shores of the bay, on either side, are rocky; at the head of the bay is a large i5 plain, the shores of which are low and swampy. Tiz point is situated about 3| miles northward of Chahbar point and the intervening coast forms a small bay at the head of which is Chahbar town. At about 4 miles eastward of Tiz point is a high tableland, the south-eastern side of which is about 840 feet (^G 11 ^) 20 high, and in places almost precipitous (chart 38). For a distance of about 2f miles south-eastward of Tiz point, the shore of Chahbar bay consists of cliffs about 150 feet (45 m 7) high, rising steeply to a tableland, about 400 feet (121 m 9) high, the southern side of which is composed of cliffy terraces, see view facing page 90. North- 25 eastward of Tiz point, the cliffs turn inland forming the southern side of the large plain inland of Chahbar bay. Immediately northward of Tiz point is the mouth of a valley, in which, at about one mile inland, is the village of Tiz. At the entrance of this valley is a small hill on which is a fort, and, fronting it, a shallow 30 lagoon that is entered by fishing craft at high water. Hor Namak, about 6 miles northward of Tiz point, becomes the mouth of a small river after rain. Kunarak village {Lat. 25° 21' N., Long. 60° 24' E.) is situated on the western shore of Chahbar bay about 5f miles north-west- 35 ward of Ras Kuhlab; there is a conspicuous tree close southward of the village. A range of mountains, on the northern side of the plain at the head of Chahbar bay, runs parallel with the coast at about 8 miles inland (chart 38); one of its summits. Quoin peak, is conspicuous 40 and about 2,400 feet (731 m 5) high; at about 10 miles westward of Quoin peak, is a sharp peak that may be identified on north easterly bearings. Depths.—Shoal. —The depths in the entrance of Chahbar bay are about 8 fathoms (14 m 6), sand and shells, decreasing regularly 45 to 5 fathoms (9 m l) at about 5^ miles within a line joining the entrance points. The north-western side of Chahbar point is bordered by a reef, and foul ground extends offshore for a distance of about 2| cables as far, north-eastward, as a small clump of date trees near the 50 ruins of a fort. Northward of these trees the beach is sandy. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2f fathoms (S 11 ^)), lies, close outside the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line, about 9 cables northward of Chahbar point and the same distance offshore. A rocky bank, over which the depths are from 1| to 2 fathoms, Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF PERSIAN MAKRAN 77 Chart 38, plan of Chdhhdr bar. extends north-westward from Tiz point for a distance of about 3 miles. Depths less than 3 fathoms (5 in 5) will be found about 2 miles off the northern shore of the bay and the same distance off the western 5 shore, northward of Ras Kuhlab peninsula. Anchorage.—Directions. —Anchorage may be obtained by small vessels in Chahbar bay, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), sand, with the tomb on Chahbar point bearing 170°, and the mosque at Chahbar town bearing 110°; native craft anchor, in depths of about 10 2 fathoms (3 m 7), about half a mile off the town. During the south-west monsoon, when a heavy south-south easterly swell is rolling into the bay, sheltered anchorage with no swell may be obtained about 3| miles eastward of Kunarak village; this anchorage also affords shelter during a shamal. 15 Anchorage in Chahbar bay is prohibited southward of a line drawn 270° from the mosque at Chahbar. The best landing place is directly under the barracks at Chahbar, where a good lee is given by a flat rock. During the south-west monsoon, landing is difficult owing to the heavy swell. 20 The two entrance points of the bay, being light in colour, are not easily distinguished at night, and should be approached with caution, vessels being guided by the light on the telegraph office. Chahbar point should be given a berth of at least 7 cables, to avoid the spit extending from it. By day, Tiz point is a useful mark 25 on which to enter. See view facing page 90 and on chart 38. The tidal streams in the bay are scarcely perceptible. Chahbar town. —This town, situated on the eastern side of Chahbar bay about IJ miles north-eastward of Chahbar point, is inhabited chiefly by fisherfolk and those employed in the native 30 dhows by which the small trade of the place is carried on. There are no roads in the vicinity, and no trade with inland towns. A large white mosque, with a white dome, stands at a short distance northward of the town and is conspicuous from seaward. The telegraph station is a fine yellow building standing on a sand- 35 hill about half a mile southward of the town; it is visible from south-eastward {Lat. 25° 17' N., Long. 60° 37' E.). Barracks, consisting of three large one-storied buildings, are situated near the telegraph station. Near the town are gardens, with many fruit trees and a few date 40 palms, extending inland for about half a mile. Ghi, moong, fins, pish leaves and seeds, mats, wool, goats' hair, hides, gelatine, and barley are exported in small quantities; cotton piece goods, rice, juari, and sugar, etc., are imported. The supply of water is scarce, and what there is is brackish. 45 Sheep and bullocks may be procured from the neighbouring country. Chickens and, when in season, melons are also to be had. Ibex may be shot on Ras Kuhlab. A Persian doctor is Quarantine Officer at Chahbar. Postal and telegraphic communication is maintained with all 50 parts; the post office is in the telegraph station, see page 29. For steamship communications, see page 28. For aircraft communications, see page 29. Chart 748b.78 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38, plan of Chdhhdr hay. Climate. —Except during the monsoon season, light winds of land and sea breeze type prevail at Chahbar; during the south west monsoon in the Indian ocean, south-south-easterly winds of 5 some strength are common by day, but fall light at night. These winds cause a heavy sea to break all round the shores of the bay, except at the town, which is sheltered. The shamal is fairly frequent in winter. The prevalence of south-south-easterly winds renders Chahbar much more suitable to Europeans than almost 10 any other place in, or near, the entrance of the Persian gulf. Chart 38. Coast.—Anchorage. —From Ras Kuhlab, the coast trends west-north-westward for about 11 miles to Ras Puzim, and becomes higher at a short distance westward of the former cape. It may be 15 approached in safety to a distance of about one mile. Ras Puzim {Lat. 25° 20' N., Long. 60° 17' E.) is faced with cliffs about 300 feet (Ql 11 ^) high; depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found within about one mile of the cape, outside which distance the depths are from 6 to 8 fathoms (ll m 0 to 14 m 6). 20 Puzim bay is entered between Ras Puzim and Ras Rashidi, situated about 5 miles westward. Ras Rashidi is the eastern extremity of a table-topped promon tory, about 150 feet (45 m 7) high, the coast of which trends westward for about 5^ miles, and ends in a somewhat higher vertical cliff; 25 this promontory is almost inaccessible on all sides, and the land on its northern side is low and sandy; depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) will be found about half a mile off its southern side. Puzim bay is reported to extend farther northward than charted; the shore within its entrance points is low and sandy; there are depths 30 of 5 fathoms (9 m l) in the entrance of the bay, and within it the depths are reported to be greater than charted. Puzim is a little fishing village, on the eastern side of the bay, close northward of Ras Puzim. There are a few huts, on the western side of the bay, northward of Ras Rashidi. 35 Anchorage may be obtained off Puzim village in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), or on the western side of Puzim bay. Sirgan river, not shown on the chart, flows into a large creek on the north-eastern side of Puzim bay. Kair river flows into a salt-water creek about 1| miles northward 40 oi Ras Rashidi; this river flows past the town of Geh, situated more than 50 miles inland. Kair village, not shown on the chart, is situated on the right bank of Kair river about 4 miles upstream; in the neighbouring district there is much cultivation. 45 The great plain inland of Chahbar bay continues westward past Puzim bay, the mountains being about 12 miles inland; but in front of the latter are some lower hills, one of which, Kiih Milin, rises about 6 miles from the head of the bay, and is conical. Baklang rock. —This dangerous drying rock lies, off the entrance 50 of Puzim bay, about miles south-eastward of Ras Rashidi; there are depths of 5 and 6 fathoms (9 m l and ll m 0) close round it, and, when covered, there is nothing to indicate its presence in calm weather. Chart 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF PERSIAN MAKRAN 79 Chart 38. The 10-fathom (18 m 3) line lies about 3 miles, and the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line 5 miles, southward of Baklang rock. At night, vessels should avoid getting intb depths less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6). 5 Ras Tank.—Shoal.—Anchorage. —This rocky promontory, on which are sandhills about 30 feet (9 m l) high, projects about one mile from the coast, to which it is joined by a narrow sandy isthmus; it is situated, about 10J miles westward of the western extremity of Rashidi promontory, at the western end of a bay, the shore of 10 which latter is composed of low sandhills. A small group of brown hills, westward of which are some date palms and a few large trees, is situated about 4 miles north-eastward of Ras Tank, and forms a good mark. There are depths of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) at about half a mile southward 15 of Ras Tank; but a shoal, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), extends eastward from the promontory for a distance of about one mile; the little bay on the western side of the promontory is shallow, and a shoal extends about 2 miles westward from the western end of the latter. 20 As soundings give little warning, Ras Tank should not be approached at night into a depth less than 30 fathoms (54 m 9). Anchorage was obtained by H.M.S. Bramble, in March, 1919, in a depth of 20 feet (6 m l), with the eastern end of Ras Tank bearing 197°, distant about 5 cables, but the bottom was rocky and the 25 holding ground bad. Tank village {Lat. 25° 22'N., Long. 59° 53' E.) is situated about 3 miles up a large creek that forms the mouth of a branch of Kair river, which latter flows from north-eastward at a short distance inland of the coastal sandhills until nearing its mouth; 30 the creek is entered between the coast and a drying sand spit, which when covered is marked by breakers and is situated close eastward of the root of Ras Tank isthmus. The bar is shallow, but is sheltered by Ras Tank; within the bar the creek is deep and about 2| cables wide. Small dhows, drawing about 5 feet (l m 5), have been observed 36 to anchor close off the entrance until high water, and then to proceed about three-quarters of a mile up the creek. In the creek, the rate of the outgoing stream has been estimated to be from 2 to 3 knots. Coast.—Aspect. —From Ras Tank, the coast trends north-west- 40 ward for about 3 miles and is cliffy, thence it trends westward for about 14 miles to Ras Maki and is low, but the cape itself is about 100 feet (30 m 5) high. Humdan village is situated, in a grove, on the banks of a creek about 3^ miles eastward of Ras Maki. 45 Discoloured water has been observed off the coast between Ras Tank and Ras Jagin, see page 83, situated nearly 100 miles westward; it is apparently caused by the water, brought down by the rivers, that is carried along the coast by the tidal streams; the edge of the discolouration is no guide to the depth, as its distance 50 from the coast is continually varying. Kuh Kalat is a great range of white clay cliffs of remarkable outline; its eastern extremity is situated about 11 miles northward of Ras Tank, whence it extends westward for some 20 miles. A Chart 748b.80 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 38. vertical cliff, about 650 feet (IQS 111 !) high, rises about 4 miles from its eastern end and is conspicuous from south-eastward. Biri sai padag, a sharp double peak, 1,521 feet (463 m 6) high, is 5 situated about 8| miles north-north-eastward of Ras Maki. A remarkable single spiked peak rises, about 3| miles south-westward of Biri sai padag, to an elevation of 1,350 feet (411 m 5), From a distance of about 33 miles on a north-easterly bearing, these summits appear as a group of three conical peaks and form a good 10 landmark. It is reported that the single spiked peak forms a part of Kiih Kalat and that Biri sai padag is detached from that range. The mountain range inland of the great plain at the head of Chahbar bay becomes lower as it extends westward, and northward of Ras Tank becomes less conspicuous. 15 From Ras Maki, the coast trends north-westward for about 8 miles and thence westward for about 21 miles to Ras Maidani; it is low and sandy and intersected by creeks leading to backwaters. Depths less than 3 fathoms will be found within about 1| miles of the coast and the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line lies from 4 to 5 miles offshore. 20 Kh5r Darak is entered about 6 miles north-westward of Ras Maki; anchorage may be obtained about half a mile off its entrance in a depth of 2| fathoms (4 m 6). Khor Galag.—Anchorage. —This creek, entered about 12 miles west-north-westward of Ras Maki, is the mouth of the Rapch 25 river, which latter flows from the interior of Persia for a distance of over 100 miles. The coast in the neighbourhood is bare and the entrance points of the creek are only about one foot (0 m 3) high; but there are some tall palms, close eastward of its mouth, which are conspicuous and 30 form a good guide. At about one mile upstream, and on the eastern side of the creek, there is a small village {Lat. 25° 29' N., Long. 59° 22' E, the natives of which are friendly; it is situated near some palm trees, but the tops only of the latter are visible from westward, their trunks being obscured by sandhills, though on 35 northerly bearings they are visible from seaward. The bar, on which there is always a surf, extends for a distance of about 1^ miles off the entrance of the creek, and the channel across it, in which there is a depth of about IJ fathoms (2^3), trends in a north-westerly direction. The river nearly dries, but off the 40 western entrance point there is a depth of about 3 feet (0 m 9). Dhows occasionally enter the creek at half tide. Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l), at about 2J miles, 170° from the entrance of the creek, but within that distance the depths appear to shoal quickly to 2 fathoms (3 m 7). 45 The best way to enter the river was, in 1911, to approach the coast eastward of its mouth until the river was well open and then to steer directly towards the western entrance point, keeping close to the breakers on the western side; but the condition of the entrance may be subject to change. 50 The best landing, with westerly winds, is on the western entrance point of the creek. Chart 145, plan of Hor Rabij. Khor Rapch. Anchorage. —Khor Rapch, entered about 8 miles westward of Khor Galag, is the mouth of a large tidal back- Charts 38, 748b.Chap. III.] COAST OF PERSIAN MAKRAN 81 Chart 145, plan of Hor Rabij. water encumbered with flats of mud and sand. At about miles outside the entrance, there is a bar, over which the depths are from 1| to 6 feet (0 m 4 to l m 8) and on which the sea breaks at low water. The depths in the channel within the bar are from U to 64 fathoms 5 (2^7 to ll m 9). On the entrance points are low sandhills, and the neighbouring country is desert; the inlet appears to be of no importance and is frequented only by fishing boats. Inland of Khor Rapch there are several villages and groves of 10 date palms. Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 4| to 4f fathoms (7 m 8 to 8 m 7), sand, about miles southward of the entrance of the khor. The following directions were used in 1911, but may not now hold 15 good. To enter the khor, the bar should be approached, as close as possible, with the eastern edge of Korat el Usif, 80 feet (24 m 4) high, seen over the eastern entrance point, bearing 349°; thence course 334° will lead across the bar, a good lookout being kept for breakers on the eastern side. When inside the bar, course should 20 be altered to pass about one cable westward of a fuzzy bush, on the eastern entrance point, after passing which the channel follows the western shore of the inlet until abreast a low sandy spit extending westward from the eastern shore. Landing can be effected, near the fuzzy bush, on the low sandy spit. 25 Charts 38, 2837a. Coast.—Shoal.— Ras Maidani is faced with white cliffs, 155 feet (47 m 2) high, which extend westward for a distance of about 3 miles, whence, for a farther 2 miles, the coast is low and sandy and covered with small bushes. The hills which terminate in the 30 cliffs are about 200 feet (61 m 0) high, table-topped, and brown in colour. See view on chart 38, Westward of the cliffs, and at a short distance inland, is a large date grove. From a position about 5 miles westward of Ras Maidani, the coast is low and trends north-westward for about 9 miles, and thence 35 westward for about 13 miles, to the mouth of the Sadaich river. Passing northward of the hills near Ras Maidani, the great coastal plain continues westward for a distance of about 60 miles. A shoal bank, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends offshore, southward of Ras Maidani, for a distance of about 40 1| miles; this shoal fringes the coast for a distance of about 10 miles westward and north-westward of the cape, and attains its greatest breadth about 5 miles westward of the latter, where its outer edge lies about 3 miles offshore. Caution is necessary when approaching this headland, especially 45 at night, for soundings give very little warning. At about 8 miles eastward of the mouth of Sadaich river, there is a small rocky point forming a little bay in which good landing may be obtained. Quoin mountain {Lat. 25° 46'N., Long. 58° 55' E.), on the 50 western side of which is a great valley, rises to an elevation of 2,120 feet (646 m 2) about 18 miles north-eastward of the mouth of Sadaich river. Sadaich river flows through swampy ground into a tidal creek Chart 748b.82 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Charts 38, 2837a. with a shallow bar at its mouth; the course of the river beyond the mountains has not been explored. Boats cannot enter the river at low water, and within it the depths are very small; it is probable 5 that the entrance is subject to change. On the banks of the river, at some distance inland, are a village, some date groves, and a certain amount of cultivation, A shoal bank, extending about 2 miles offshore, fringes the coast from a position about 10 miles eastward of the mouth of Sadaich 10 river to and beyond that river. Mountains.—Aspect. —Bashakird, a district of Persian Makran inland and northward of Jask and westward of the Sadaich river, is very mountainous and but little is known of it. Kiih Gukardi, situated from 2 to 4 miles inland, about 6 miles 15 eastward of Sadaich river, has three principal conical peaks, the northern and highest being 490 feet (149 m 3) high. There is a rocky outcrop, from 20 to 50 feet (6 m l to 15 m 2) high, on the plain about 5 miles eastward of Kuh Gukardi. Gau kuh (Jabal Shahu), situated about 36 miles north-north- 20 westward of the mouth of the Sadaich river, rises to an elevation of 6,220 feet (1895 m 9); it appears to be almost detached from the neighbouring mountains in Bashakird and on north-westerly bearings its eastern side exhibits a great bluff, though on easterly bearings its summit appears rounded. See view on chart 38. 25 The coastal range extends westward from the vicinity of Quoin mountain towards Jask, situated about 50 miles westward of the mouth of the Sadaich river, the elevation of its peaks varying from 1,400 to 2,540 feet (426^7 to 774^2). Suraf, a range of bare white sandhills about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, 30 extends for a distance of about 6 miles along the coast westward from the mouth of the Sadaich river; there is a conspicuous tree at the western end of these sandhills. Coast.—Anchorage. —Ras Jagin is situated about 31 miles westward of the mouth of the Sadaich river; the coast between 35 the sandhills and the point is very low, and is intersected by mangrove swamps and the mouths of numerous creeks; that immediately westward of the sandhills affords shelter to boats, having depths of 2 feet (0 m 6) on the bar and from 6 to 8 feet (l m 8 to 2 in 4) at a short distance within, between steep-to banks about 6 feet (l m 8) high. 40 Other creeks are also visited by local craft; they are the mouths of streams descending, through gaps in the coastal mountains, from the Bashakird mountains. Gabrig river, the mouth of which is situated about 18 miles westward of that of the Sadaich river, is one of the largest of the 45 aforementioned streams. {Lat. 25° 35' NLong. 58° 21' E.) The shoal bank eastward of the Sadaich river continues to fringe the coast between the mouth of that river and that of Gabrig river and extends about 2 miles offshore. An isolated sandhill, covered with scrub, rises about 1J miles 50 westward of the mouth of Gabrig river. The boat channel into the Gabrig river is situated at the eastern end of the bar at its mouth, and the depth in it is about one foot (0 m 3). Anchorage may be obtained off the mouth of the river, in a depth Chart 748b.Chap. III.] JASK 83 Charts 38, 2837a. of 5 fathoms (9 m l), at a distance of about 2 miles offshore, but the depths decrease rapidly shoreward to 2 fathoms (3 m 7). A north-easterly current has been experienced between the mouth of Gabrig river and Ras Jagin. 5 Ras Jagin {Lat. 25° 33' NLong. 58° 06' E.) is very low, rounded and sandy, and the mouth of Jagin river is situated close eastward of it; inland of the point is a mangrove swamp whence a plain extends to the foot of the hills. A sandy drying spit extends for a distance of about half a mile south-westward from the point, the 10 3-fathom (5 m 5) line being about one mile offshore; it is probable that the configuration of this point alters after heavy rains or storms; there being depths of from 18 to 20 fathoms (32 m 9 to 36 m 6) within one mile of the spit, soundings afford little guide and caution is necessary when in its vicinity, particularly as the point itself is 15 difficult to identify and the appearance of the hills inland cause the distance offshore to be easily over-estimated. Charts 145, 38, 2837a. JASK.—East bay. —From Ras Jagin, the coast trends north westward for about 12 miles, and thence south-westward for about 20 10£ miles, to Cape Jask, forming Jask East bay; in the bay there are depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) from 2 to 3 miles offshore. The north-eastern shore of the bay is low, the sands drying for a distance of over half a mile from the coast. Hor Lash, the entrance of which is situated about 8 miles north-westward of Ras Jagin, is large. At 25 the head of the bay, the hills approach within one mile of the shore, the coastal range ending in Kuh Gazdan, a ridge of white cliffs, 1,720 feet (524 m 3) high, which on easterly bearings, appears quoin- shaped. There is a village with a few date trees between Kiih Gazdan and the shore. The north-western shore of the bay is rocky 30 and level, about 14 feet (4 m 3) high, with a sandy beach and, in places, rocky ledges and low cliffs. Anchorage.—Caution. —Anchorage, somewhat sheltered from westerly winds, may be obtained, in depths of from 6 to 8 fathoms (ll m 0 to 14 m 6), close off the north-western shore of the bay. The 35 bay is open south-eastward and there is usually a light surf on the beach which becomes heavy during the south-west monsoon in the Indian ocean, although there may be only a slight ground swell in the bay. The bay is open to the easterly gales of winter. In a shamal, the wind is westerly and it is said that the anchorage is then iO good, though a considerable swell rolls round the cape, causing a vessel at anchor to ride uneasily. For warning of a shamal, see page 85. Vessels should not anchor with the beacon on Cape Jask, see page 84, bearing less than 046° or more than 270°, on account of the ^5 existence of telegraph cables. The best landing place is on a sandy beach between the beacon and the cliffs north-eastward of it. Chart 145. Cape Jask.—Lights.—Signal station. —This cape is low and 50 is the extremity of a point that projects a considerable distance from the general line of the coast. At its extremity there is a small Charts 753, 38, 2837a, 748b.84 APPROACHES TO PERSIAN GULF [Chap. III. Chart 145. tomb, 15 feet (4 m 6) high, close to which are two dark flat-topped buildings. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 37 feet (ll m 3), from a 5 white round tower on the northern comer of a small square stone house, 23 feet (7 m 0) in height, about 2 cables northward of Cape Jask {Lat. 25° 38'N., Long. 57° 45' E.). The telegraph buildings, about 4 cables north-eastward of the cape, consist of three flat-roofed blocks, the northern and southern blocks having conspicuous square towers; near them is a flagstaff, 80 feet (24 m 4) high, and some water tanks. The office of the British India Steam Navigation Company, near which is a flagstaff, is situated about midway between the telegraph buildings and the stone fort in the village of Jask, about 15 3 cables north-eastward. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 78 feet, from a flagstaff, 63 feet (19 m 2) in height, erected in the fort in the village of Jask. Two W/T masts, each 75 feet (22 m 9) in height, are erected on the shore of Jask East bay, about If miles north-eastward of Cape 20 Jask. A light is exhibited from each of the W/T masts. A signal station is established at the telegraph buildings on Cape Jask, at which reports can be transmitted through Lloyd's. Com munication can be maintained by means of the International code 25 of signals; no lookout is kept and vessels must therefore attract attention. A stone beacon, painted in black and white horizontal bands and 30 feet (9 m l) in height, is erected, on the shore of Jask East bay, about 4| cables north-eastward of Cape Jask. 30 Jask bay.—Shoals.—Buoy. —The shore of this bay, situated westward of Cape Jask, trends in a general north-north-easterly direction for about 4 miles to the mouth of Jask creek, and is composed of sandhills from 10 to 20 feet (3 m 0 to 6 m l) high ; thence it trends north-westward for about 4 miles and is also composed of 35 sandhills. Mason shoal, lying in the approach to Jask bay about 3 miles west-south-westward of Cape Jask, is composed of coarse sand and shells; there are depths of from 2f to 3 fathoms (5 ni 0 to 5 m 5) over the shoal and from 8 to 10 fathoms (14 m 6 to 18 in 3) close to its southern 40 end. A flat about one mile broad, over which the depths are from 2| to 3 fathoms (4 m 6 to 5 m 5), extends in a north-westerly direction for about 2 miles from Cape Jask. A red can buoy with cage topmark is established near the north- 45 western extremity of the flat. The channel between Mason shoal and the flat is about U miles wide, with depths in it of from 5 fathoms (9 m l) on the Mason shoal side to 3J fathoms (5 m 9) near the edge of the flat. The western extremity of Gaigan hill, see page 100, bearing 354° 50 is stated to lead between Mason shoal and the flat. Jask village, which is of considerable size, extends for a distance of about one mile north-eastward, along the shore of the bay, from a position about half a mile north-north-eastward of the cape. Northward of the village, the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies from half Charts 753, 38, 2837a, 748b.'Cg Chap. III.] j ASK gg Chart 145. a rnile to If miles offshore, and drying sands extend nearly one mile off the mouth of Jask creek. Jask creek is entered by a channel, through the sands, in which there is a depth of about feet (O'M) with greater depths inside; 5 the creek winds through mangrove swamps for about 4 miles and is used by native craft. Jask fort [Lat. 25° 44' N., Long. 57° 46' E.), situated about 2J miles northward of the mouth of the creek, is in a ruinous condition with a few houses and date trees near it and a range of white sand- 10 hills south-eastward of it; it stands about one mile inland and is not easily identified from seaward. Anchorage. — Directions . — Convenient anchorage, partially sheltered from southerly winds by the flat extending from Cape Jask and by Mason shoal, but open to the shamal, may be obtained 15 by vessels drawing up to 16 feet (4m9), in a depth of 31 fathoms (6 m 4), with Cape Jask lighthouse bearing 173°, distant about 12 cables. Larger vessels anchor farther out in a depth of 4^ fathoms (8 m 2), with the lighthouse bearing 153°, distant about 2 miles. 20 Approaching from southward or eastward, vessels may pass between Mason shoal and the flat extending from Cape Jask; after rounding the buoy at the north-western end of the flat, course may be shaped as requisite for the anchorage; the least depth on this route is 3| fathoms (6 m 9). 25 Good landing may be obtained within a rocky point northward of the telegraph buildings. Warning of the approach of a shamal may often be obtained at the telegraph office where information is received of the commence ment of one at Bushire; a shamal beginning at Bushire may be 30 expected at Jask from 24 to 48 hours later. For meteorological tables, see page 284. Tidal streams .—Between Cape Jask and Ras al Kiih, situated about 26 miles west-north-westward, the tidal streams off the coast set eastward and westward; near the cape, the streams are weak, 35 but the rate increases towards Ras al Kiih. In December, 1922, H.M.S. Espiegle experienced a strong set in the channel between Cape Jask and Mason shoal, though outside the channel the stream did not appear to be strong. Supplies.—Communications.—The best water is obtained from wells near some conspicuous date groves, about one mile north eastward of the telegraph buildings at Jask; the larger water- tank, supported on pillars near the well, and roofed in, is conspicuous. Bread and fresh meat can be obtained, but no vegetables; fish is plentiful. 45 There is telegraphic communication with all parts, s^page29. For steamship communications, see page 28. For aircraft communications, see page 29.

Chart 753. RUUS AL JABAL.—Aspect. —This great and mountainous promontory, the northern end of which is the Musandam peninsula, is situated on the western side of the entrance of the Persian gulf. 5 The coast is everywhere precipitous, the cliffs in most places over hanging, their bases having been eroded by the action of the sea. There are many small sandy bays at the mouths of the valleys, and the mountains rise abruptly from the coast. The promontory is indented, on its eastern and northern sides, by numerous deep- 10 water inlets, some of considerable extent. Except in a few little valleys where date groves, &amp;c., are to be found, the land is every where barren, though in some of the fissures of the hills there is a scanty vegetation. The mountains, apparently consisting of bare rock, present a grand and wild appearance, and are infested 25 by wolves, leopards, hyaenas and foxes. The paths across them are, in general, rough tracks. The inlets, enclosed by the bare precipitous mountains, have a most remarkable appearance. In them, the winds are very baffling, and consequently, though any of them can be entered by a steam 20 vessel, difficulty would be experienced by a sailing vessel either entering or leaving. The inhabitants of the promontory are herdsmen and fisherfolk. They are for the most part inoffensive and extremely poor, very ignorant and superstitious. 25 From eastward the mountain ranges of Ruus al Jabal appear to have two principal peaks. Jabal Kawa {Lat. 25\ 41' N., Long. 56° 13' E.), the southern peak, has a small notch in its summit, and rises to an elevation of about 5,800 feet (1767 in 8), at about 6 miles north-north-westward SO oi Al Karsha, see page 57. Sha am peak or Jabal al Harim, the northern peak, is situated about 14 miles northward of Jabal Kawa; it is about 6,750 feet (2057 m 4) high, and has a truncated or small table top with a little notch in its southern part. See views on chart 2837a. 35 Coast. From Al Karsha, the coast trends northward to Has Suwat, see page 57, and thence, for about 1| miles in the same Charts 2837a, 748h.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap. IV.] RUUS AL JABAL—EAST SIDE 87 Chart 753. direction, to a point at the southern end of an indentation at the northern end of which latter is Duhat Haffah. Ras Haffah, situated about 3| miles north-north-eastward of Ras Suwat, is the southern end of a narrow promontory on the eastern side of Duhat Haffah; the promontory is of moderate height and decreases in elevation towards the point. Duhat Haffah, entered westward of Ras Haffah, has depths in it of from 7 to 8 fathoms (12 m 8 to 14 m 6), with 4 fathoms (7 m 3) close inshore. The cove, which is quite land-locked and has high mountains coming down to the water's edge, is not noticeable from seaward. At a short distance within the cove, there is, on its western side, a small bay with a sandy beach at its head where there is a date garden and a few huts. At the head of the cove, there are two small villages, one on either side. H.M.S. Triad reported, in 1930, that the cove appeared to be shorter than charted, and that there were few places within it where landing is possible. Khor Mala is situated about 3J miles northward of Ras Haffah, and the intervening coast is of cliffs, with depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) at a distance of from 2 to 3 cables from them. The inlet, which is narrow, recedes for a distance of about 8 cables; its shores are irregular, and the depth decreases from 8 fathoms (14 m 6) in the entrance. [Lat. 25° 47' N., Long. 56° 21' E.) From Khor Mala, the coast, in which there are several small indentations, trends northward for about 3J miles to a cove which extends westward for about one mile; at about half-way in, the cove narrows to a width of about 2 cables, but its inner part is about half a mile wide; there are depths of 8 fathoms (14 m 6) in the entrance of the cove, and 3 fathoms (5 m 5) in its inner part. Duhat Sharjah, the southern entrance point of which is about 7J miles northward of Ras Haffah, is separated from the last- mentioned cove by a promontory about three-quarters of a mile wide; it is open eastward and there are depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) in the entrance, decreasing gradually to the sandy beach at head of the cove. From the northern entrance point of Duhat Sharjah, the preci pitous coast trends north-north-eastward for a distance of about 3 miles to Ras Hamra, and thence north-westward for about 1J miles. Ras Hamra is the southern entrance point of Ghubbat 'Aqaba. Limah peak, when seen from northward, appears as a fine cone and is situated about miles south-westward of Ras Hamra; at about 3 miles west-south-westward of it is a somewhat higher saddle- shaped mountain that is also conspicuous from northward, see view on chart 2837a; on westerly bearings these mountains do not show up against the higher land farther inland. Ghubbat 'Aqaba extends north-westward for about 2 miles from its entrance between Ras Hamra and Ras Samut, situated about 2| miles north-eastward. The depths in the bay decrease from 23 fathoms (42 m 0) in the entrance to 10 fathoms (18 m 3) near its shores. 'Aqaba, situated in the north-western corner of the bay, is a small village, close off which boats may obtain shelter from the nashi; the worst wind on this coast. Ras Limah, situated about \\ miles north-eastward of Ras Samut, is the termination of a narrow, precipitous promontory. Charts 2837a, 748b.88 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. Jezirat Limah, lying about 3| cables eastward of Ras Limah, is a precipitous islet, 285 feet (86 m 9) high. There is a depth of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) in the channel between the islet and the point, 5 and a small detached rock lies close to the former. The tidal streams through the channel are strong. Close eastward of the islet there is a depth of 30 fathoms (54 in 9). Limah.—Anchorage. —At a distance of about miles westward of Ras Limah {Lat. 25° 56' N., Long. 56° 28' E.), is a sandy bay 10 on the shore of which, at the mouth of a valley, stands the village of Limah. The village is.situated on the southern side of the bay and a part of it extends up the hillside on terraces, one hut above another; in the valley there is a date grove and some cultivation. A spit extends for a distance of about 2 cables offshore near the 15 date grove north-westward of the village. The mountains in the vicinity of Limah rise abruptly to great heights. At the northern end of the sandy bay is a high precipitous hill, close off which lie four rocky islets from 10 to 30 feet (3 m 0 to 9 m l) high. In June, 1898, when visited by H.M.S. Sphinx, the inhabitants 20 of Limah were found to be armed and hostile, but when visited by H.M.S. Cyclamen, in 1922, they were perfectly friendly. When the people are friendly, cattle, &amp;c., may be procured, but good water cannot be obtained in any quantity except perhaps from a distance. A path leads through the hills to Aqaba. 25 Anchorage may be obtained off Limah in a depth of about 12 fathoms (21 m 9), but it is open eastward and north-eastward. A small bight on the southern side of the bay, close to the cliffs, that is used by native boats, affords the best landing place in easterly winds. 30 Coast. —From Limah, the coast trends northward for about 3 miles to Ras Marovi. Ras Marovi is situated at the northern end of a bay, about 1J miles across, in which there is a patch of sandy beach. At about one-quarter of a mile off Ras Marovi are two rocky islets about 55 25 feet (7 m 6) high. Ras Samid, a high cliffy point, is situated about miles north ward of Ras Marovi, and between them are several little bays separated by small points. A rock, 25 feet (7 m 6) high, lies about one mile north-north-eastward 40 of Ras Marovi and nearly half a mile offshore; there is a depth of 22 fathoms (40 m 2) between the rock and the coast. Duhat Kabal is entered northward of Ras Samid; it is about 1^ miles wide, and, after trending westward for about 2 miles, turns southward for about one mile, forming a narrow cove with a sandy 45 beach at its head; the shores of the inlet are very indented, the bays, which are all separated by cliffy points, have small beaches in them. At about one mile south-westward of the head of the cove, the mountains rise like a wall, forming a tremendous bluff, over 4,000 feet (1219 m 2) high. The depths in the inlet decrease from 25 50 fathoms (45 m 7) in the entrance to 13 fathoms (23 m 8) at the mouth of the cove, at the head of which latter the chart shows a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3); but H.M.S. Redbreast, in 1902, anchored in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) at a distance of 1^ cables from the head of the cove Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] RUUS AL JABAL—EAST SIDE 89 Chart 753. and found that from 5 fathoms (9 m l) the depths shoaled suddenly to the beach. The cove teems with fish, and is frequented by fishermen from Limah; a few poor herdsmen live in huts scattered over the valley 5 at the head of the cove. In the western branch of this valley or water-course are the ruins of an extensive village. There is a small bare hill on the summit of the lofty cliffs at the northern entrance point of the inlet, and thence the deeply fur rowed cliffs trend north-eastward in an unbroken line of irregular 10 but decreasing height. Ras Sarkan, a vertical cliff of considerable height, is situated about 3 miles north-eastward of the small bare hill, and forms the southern entrance point of Ghubbat Ghazirah; depths of 40 fathoms (73 m 2) will be found within half a mile of the point. 15 Ghubbat Ghazirah .—Anchorage . — This extensive bay is en tered between Ras Sarkan and Ras Dilla, situated about 2| miles northward; it extends west-north-westward for about 9 miles, and its deeply indented shores are high and precipitous, except where valleys terminate in a few small sandy bays. See view on chart 20 '2837a. On the southern side of the bay there are two principal inlets; the outer one recedes miles and the inner one 2J miles, both run south-south-eastward; in the former there is a village. Habalain village {Lat. 26° 09' NLong. 56° 20' E.) is situated 25 on the shore of a small bight at the south-western end of the head of Ghubbat Ghazirah. Fish are plentiful, and can be obtained by seining. In 1923, a number of fowls and eggs were obtained at the village. The water in the wells at Habalain is brackish. Good anchorage, on a sandy bottom, may be obtained in the 30 bight off Habalain village. On the northern side of Ghubbat Ghazirah are two large inlets, each extending north-north-eastward for a distance of about 3 miles and separated by a high, narrow, and rugged peninsula. Mukakah village, not shown on the chart, is situated on the shore 35 of the western inlet, the northern side of which is the narrow ridge or isthmus connecting the middle of the north-eastern coast of Ruus al Jabal to Musandam peninsula; in places the isthmus is only about 3 cables wide and on its northern side is Khor ash Shumm, entered from the Persian Gulf, see page 96 iO Film is a village at the head of the outer or eastern inlet on the northern side of Ghubbat Ghazirah. The depths in Ghubbat Ghazirah vary from 25 to 36 fathoms (45 m 7 to 65 m 8) in the main part of the bay, and from 12 to 25 fathoms (21 m 9 to 45 m 7) in the inlets, there being 20 fathoms (36 m 6) in most 45 places close to the cliffs; in the entrance of the bay the bottom is rocky, but within it is chiefly mud. MUSANDAM PENINSULA.—Eastern side. —This peninsula consists of a series of small, lofty peninsulas and headlands, enclosing numerous inlets of various sizes. Many of the inlets are good 50 harbours, though the depths in them are as a rule inconveniently great, but owing to the intense heat in summer rendering the climate unsuitable for Europeans, they can hardly be used then even as temporary anchorages. Two of its peaks rise to an elevation of Charts 2837a, 748b.90 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. about 3,000 feet (914 in 4), and many others to between 1,000 and 2,000 feet (304 m 8 and 609 m 6). See view facing this page and views on chart 2837a. 5 Ras Dilla.— This, the eastern extremity of the south-eastern portion of Musandam peninsula, is a vertical cliff, from 200 to 300 feet (61 m 0 to Ol 11 ^) high, with a conical summit. The peninsula, of which Ras Dilla is the extremity, commences at Film village and has on its widest part a remarkable peak, brown in colour, 10 over 1,000 feet (304 m 8) high, with a little round knob on its summit; it separates Ghubbat Ghazirah from Ghubbat Shabus. The depths off Ras Dilla are irregular, varying from 33 to 49 fathoms (60 m 4 to 89 m 6). On the north-western side of Ras Dilla is a small bay, open north-eastward, with a depth in it of about 15 fathoms {21^4). 15 Ghubbat Shabus. —This bay is entered between a point situated about 2J miles north-north-westward of Ras Dilla and Ras Bashin situated about If miles farther northward. The shores of the bay consist of high cliffs, with here and there small sandy beaches. Depths of from 12 to 20 fathoms (21 m 9 to 36 m 6) will be found close 20 to the cliffs. Shabus, not shown on the chart, is a village on the shore of a little bay on the south-western side of Ghubbat Shabus. Two other villages are situated on the shores of the northern part of the bay. 25 Kami Sibi is a remarkable cone with a flat scalloped top, rising to an elevation of 3,010 feet (917 m 4), about one mile westward of the head of Ghubbat Shabiis. See views on chart 2837a. Kaisa peak is a conical hill of light colour, rising to an elevation of over 1,000 feet (304 m 8), about 1^ miles north-eastward of the 30 head of Ghubbat Shabus. Ras Bashin is about 100 feet (30 m 5) high and light red in colour; an islet lies about half a mile offshore and about 8 cables north eastward of it. There are depths of 30 fathoms (54 m 9) close off Ras Bashin. 35 Abu al Mawar, over which there is a depth of one fathom (l m 8), is a reef reported by the Arabs to lie close offshore near the islet off Ras Bashin. Jezirat Umm al Faiyarin. —This islet, situated in the approach to Ghubbat Shabus, is about 360 feet (109 ra 7) high; it is of light 40 colour and lies about 3| miles east-south-eastward of Ras Bashin; its western coast is precipitous, but it is possible that landing could be effected on its south-eastern side. There are depths of from 65 to 60 fathoms (100 m 6 to 109 m 7) near the eastern side of the islet, and from 38 to 42 fathoms (69 m 5 to 76 m 8) between it and the coast. 45 See views on chart 2837a. Tidal streams.—Caution. —In the vicinity of Jezirat Umm al Faiyarin {Lat. 26° 11' N., Long. 56° 33' E.), the tidal stream entering the Persian gulf usually sets northward along the coast as far as Musandam island, whence it sets north-westward towards 50 Salamah wa Binat-ha, see page 92, and westward towards Ras Sharaita, see page 93; the tidal stream flowing out of the Gulf usually sets in the opposite direction. The rate of the stream is from 2 to 3 knots, though off Ras Musandam it may attain a rate of about 4 knots, and perhaps even more at springs. Charts 2837a, 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap. IV.] MUSANDAM PENINSULA 91 Chart 753. The tidal streams being very strong near Jezirat Umm al Faiyarin, and from its vicinity to Musandam island and Salamah wa Bindt-ha, with eddies and races, especially near the northern end of the island, sailing vessels should avoid approaching this side of the entrance of the Persian gulf, especially as the wind is uncertain near the high land, often failing or shifting suddenly to the opposite quarter. Duhat Shisah. —This extensive bay is entered between Ras Kaisa and Ras Qabr Hindi, situated about 5 miles north-north eastward . Ras Kaisa is situated about one mile north-eastward of Kaisa peak and about 3 miles northward of Ras Bashin; it is about 100 feet (30 in 5) high and light red in colour. White islet, 37 feet (ll m 3) high, lies about 1| cables north-eastward of Ras Kaisa, and close to it there are depths of 30 fathoms (54 m 9), depths of 70 fathoms (128 m 0) being found about one mile seaward of the point. Ras Qabr Hindi rises to an elevation of 1,448 feet (441 m 3); it is a precipitous mountain and its summit is in the form of three scallops. See view on chart 2837a. It is the easternmost extremity of Musandam peninsula and is distant about 30 miles from the nearest point on the coast of Persia. There are depths of from 46 to 53 fathoms (84 m l to 96 m 9) at a distance of half a mile from the cape. [Lat. 26° 19' N., Long. 56° 31' E.) Duhat Shisah extends westward for about 6 miles from its entrance, and its shores are indented and precipitous though there are some small sandy beaches in the coves. In general, the depths in the bay decrease from 30 or 40 fathoms (54 m 9 or 73 m 2) to from 15 to 20 fathoms (27 m 4 to 36 m 6) close to the cliffs; the bottom is a fine grey sand. Red islet, so called from its colour, is the largest and southern most of three islets, lying about half-way in on the northern side of the bay. It is in two parts, joined by a narrow and stony neck, the southern and highest part rising to an elevation of 183 feet (55 m 8). The middle islet is the largest of the three and has sheer cliffs; its craggy peak, 368 feet (112 m 2) high, overhangs to the east. The northern islet is a rocky stack, 62 feet (18 m 9) high. Shisah is a small village standing on the western side of the southern part of the bay; there is a larger village about If miles north-westward of it. The south-western shore of Duhat Shisah is separated from Khor ash Sham by a ridge, in one place only about three-quarters of a mile wide; the western shore is separated from Khor Ghubb 'Ali, see page 95, by a similar ridge not much wider. Ras al Bab. —Off -lying islands and dangers. —Ras al Bab, the north-eastern extremity of Musandam peninsula, is a vertical limestone cliff, 453 feet (138 m l) high, situated about 2f miles northward of Ras Qabr Hindi, the intervening coast forming a bay. This headland, and the islands and islets off the northern end of the Musandam peninsula have been undermined in places for a considerable distance by the action of the sea and tidal streams. Fakk al Asad or the Lion's jaw, a strait 3 cables wide, separates Musandam island from Ras al Bab; it is clear of dangers, and has a depth in it of 24 fathoms (43 m 9). The strait is frequently used Charts 2837a, 748b.92 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. by steam vessels, but great attention must be paid to the helm, and the vessel must be kept in as near mid-channel as possible. Owing to the strong tidal streams and baffling winds, it is not safe 5 for sailing vessels. The north-west-going tidal stream sets against the cliffs on the western side of the strait, and the south-east-going stream on to the south-western part of Musandam island. Musandam island is 889 feet (271 m 0) high and precipitous all round, except in three or four small coves on its eastern side, where 10 are the only landing places. The highest part is near the southern coast, and is in the form of three little peaks. See views on chart 2837a. There are the remains of some buildings on the northern part of the island. There are usually a few herdsmen on the island, tending their flocks of goats; the coasts of Musandam island are 15 frequented by fishermen from Kumzar, see page 93. Ras Musandam (Lat. 26° 23' NLong. 56° 32' E.), the northern extremity of the island, is a cliff about 100 feet (30 m 5) high. A sounding of 104 fathoms (190 m 2) has been obtained about 3 miles eastward of Ras Musandam, and this is the greatest known depth 20 northward of Ras al Kuh. Kachalu or Abu Sufur is a rocky islet in the form of a pillar, 98 feet (29 m 9) high, lying about half a mile north-eastward of Ras Musandam with a clear passage between it and the cape, Tawakkul islet, known to the fishermen as Abu Raschid, lies about 25 If miles north-westward of Ras Musandam; it is 453 feet (138 m l) high, steep-to, and precipitous; in appearance it much resembles Great Quoin, see below and view on chart 2837a. Rak Suwaik is a rocky patch, over which the least known depth is 4 feet (l m 2) with from 47 to 57 fathoms (86 m 0 to 104 m 2) close 30 round it, lying about three-quarters of a mile westward of Tawakkul islet. Kachalu islet open northward of Tawakkul islet, bearing more than 108°, leads northward of the patch. Numbers of small birds are often seen to hover over the patch. Salamah wa Binat-ha.—Light. —'Salamah and her daugh- 35 ters', a group of three islets, is also known as The Quoins. See views facing page 90 and on chart 2837a. Little Quoin, lying about 4| miles northward of Kachalu, is 168 feet (51 m 2) high, and as its name implies quoin or wedge-shaped; the highest and vertical part is at its southern end, and its northern 40 extremity is also a bluff, but smaller. Landing can be effected only on the northern side of the islet, where there is a small stone jetty with a depth of only about one foot (0 m 3) alongside. A reef over which the depths are from 2 to 6 fathoms (3 m 7 to ll m 0), extends for a distance of about 2 cables northward from the islet. 45 A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 197 feet (60 m 0), from a white framework tower, 79 feet (24 m l) in height, erected on the summit at the southern end of Little Quoin. Gap islet, 247 feet (75 m 3) high, rises in the form of a peak about one mile north-north-westward of Little Quoin; it is cliffy on all 50 sides. A small rocky patch, over which the least known depth is 8 feet (2 m 4), lies between Gap islet and Little Quoin at a distance of about 3 cables from the former and 8 cables from the latter. Salamah or Great Quoin is 541 feet (164 in 9) high and lies about Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] MUSANDAM PENINSULA 93 Chart 753. three-quarters of a mile west-north-westward of Gap islet; it is quoin-shaped with the vertical side at its south-eastern end; landing can be effected only on its north-western side. A reef, over which the depths are from 4 to 6 fathoms (7 m 3 to ll m 0), extends northward 5 from the islet for a distance of about 2 cables. A small detached rock lies above water less than half a cable from the northern side of Great Quoin. Tidal streams. —In the vicinity of The Quoins, the tidal streams set north-westward and south-eastward, at a rate of from 3 to 4 iO knots at springs, see page 292. A sailing vessel should not pass southward of the islets, as the wind often fails in their vicinity, and the tidal stream then renders a vessel unmanageable. Near Kachalu and Tawakkul islets the streams are strongest, causing broken water; in calm weather, at springs, the noise of the races, 15 caused by these streams, can be heard at a considerable distance. Northern and western sides of Musandam peninsula.— Mountains rise steeply from the northern and western coast of Musandam peninsula; the sea is everywhere clear. Westward of Ras al Bab, see page 91, the northern coast of 20 Musandam peninsula consists of several projecting points separating bays in all of which the depths are considerable. Ghubbat al Khouse or Khor Fakudda, the largest bay, is entered between two narrow cliffy points, about 2 miles south-westward of Ras al Bab and its sides are precipitous all round; at about 8 cables south- 25 eastward of the northern entrance point is a stack, 146 feet (44 m 5) high, that lies about half a cable off the shore to which it is connected at low water. Kh5r Muaili, the bay next westward, has a sandy beach, on which are a few huts, at its head. Jabal Maili, a sharp peak, rises to an elevation of 1,891 feet 30 (576 m 4) immediately southward of the head of Khor Muaili; on southerly bearings its eastern side appears to overhang slightly. Kumzar {Lat. 26° 20'N., Long. 56° 25' E.) is a small fishing town in a gloomy valley or gorge about 2 miles north-westward of Jabal Maili. It is situated at the head of Khor Kumzar, a bay 35 that extends south-westward for about miles and, varying in width, has several indentations in its shores. The bay is open to the nashi, which latter often blows with strength in the winter. The depths in the bay decrease from 32 fathoms (58 m 5) in the entrance to from 20 to 17 fathoms (36 m 6 to 31 m l), sand, at the anchorage 40 at its head. Aalam is a mountain, with a double summit over a precipice, that rises to an elevation of 1,843 feet (561 m 7) about 8 cables south ward of Kumzar. Ras Mukhalif is the northern extremity of the projecting point 45 on the western side of Khor Kumzar. Between Ras Mukhalif and Ras Sharaita, situated about 2| miles north-westward, are three coves all open northward, in which the depths are considerable. At the head of the eastern cove is a small natural boat harbour, near which are a few huts and a well; the 50 middle cove is named Khor Kulte; the eastern one, Khor Khouran; and the western one, Khor Fordha (Ferrta).

Lupin, in 1927, to be 4° in error, and that bearings taken 35 from the chart should be increased by that amount. Tezirat al Ghanam is an island the north-western extremity ot which Ras Allamo, is situated about 1| miles south -westward of Ras Sharaita. At the northern end of Jezirat al Ghanam is a hill 209 feet {63 m 7) high, that is joined to the main part of the island 40 bv a low sandy neck about half a cable wide; thence the land gradually rises to an elevation of 606 feet (184^7) near the southern end of the island, which latter terminates in a sheer cliff 350 ieet (106 m 7) high At a distance of half a mile westward of the island there are depths of from 38 to 45 fathoms (69^5 to 82^3). The 45 island is barren, waterless, and uninhabited; but usually there are on it a few goats belonging to the inhabitants of Kumzar. Kh5r Kuwai (Kawi) is the strait between Jezirat al Ghanam and the mainland of Musandam peninsula. The general depths in the strait are from 11 to 19 fathoms (20 m l to 34 m 7). *0 Pier point {Lat. 26° 22' N., Long. 56° 22' £.), a rocky projection from 30 to 40 feet (9 m l to 12 m 2) high, resembling that from which it obtains its name, extends in an east-south-easterly direction from the northern end of Jezirat al Ghanam.

NORTH -WESTERN SIDE OF RUUS AL JABAL.—Aspect.— The northern and western coasts of Ruus al Jabal promontory rise steeply to mountains, and the sea off them is everywhere clear. From northward, except when very close inshore, Sha'am peak, 35 with its small table-top, see page 86, is visible over the other mountains. Fine peak, see page 98, is situated about 8 miles north- north-westward of Sha am peak, but does not show up well against the mountains rising to the latter when bearing between about 140° and 170°. 40 Coast.—Anchorage. —Between Ras Shakhs and the eastern entrance point of Khasab bay, situated about one mile south -westward, the northern coast ot Ruus al Jabal is high and rocky; it is indented with several small bights, in the largest of which is Fenekha, a little village at which there are wells of good water. 43 Khasab town stands at the head of Khasab bay; it is situated in a date grove that extends up a wide valley running in a southerly direction with bare steep hills rising on either side; beyond the date grove the valley is well cultivated, corn and vegetables being produced. Little of the town is visible from seaward, with the 50 exception of a fort that stands with its flagstaff near the middle of the beach. The Wali of the Sultan of Muscat resides in the fort; but the Shaikh's house is situated about one mile inland and Charts 2837a, 748b.98 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap.

The population of Khasab W The 'depths toTha^bay decrease gradually, from 8 fathoms (J..6) imthe entrance, to 2 fathoms (3-7) at about 5 cables from the wsandv beach at its head, which latter dries for nearly that distance, rendering landing unpleasant. The best landing at high water is on the western end of the beach, and boats approaching it should keep along the western shore of the bay; at low water it is best to keep just eastward of the Wall's fort and follow up the creek J5th ^Xragrmay teotoinlfin Khasab bay, but it is open north ward to the strong winds that blow in winter from that direction, though thev occur very rarely and are of short duration. In summer lessels should anchor ill abo^t 7 fathoms d^) fine sand, but m 20 winter they should not get into depths less than 10 fathoms (18 3) the holding ground is good. The shamal blows from south-westward and the bay is then well sheltered from wind and sea. In 1931, H.M.S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 3 fathoms (o o), sand, with the fort bearing 171°, distant 6 cables. 25 Kidah cove is entered about one mile westward o Khasab bay from which latter it is separated by a ridge of steep hills^ the depths in the cove decrease from about 10 to 3 fathoms {18 3 to 5 5). Kidah. a small village with a large date grove stands on the shore at the head of the cove; Makhi, a large fishing village, at which 30 there are wells of fairly good water, is situated on the western side of the cove near its entrance. „ ^ v • x j u Hanah cove {Lat. 26° 13' N., Long. 56 13 E.) is entered about one mile northward of Kidah cove; on its shores are a few huts and a fine date grove; at about H cables from the beach is a well of 35 good water. The inhabitants are chiefly fisherfolk. Haraf is a village in the mountains above Hanah cove. , • , i- A Anchorage, sheltered from the shamal which m this locahty blows from between west -south-west and west, may be obtained in depths of from 19 to 22 fathoms (34^7 to 40^2) with Ras Sheikh 40 Mas'ud, situated about If miles northward of the head of Hanah cove, bearing about 306°, distant 1| miles. ^ u ^ Ras Sheikh Mas'ud.—Tidal streams .—This prominent headland is often called Ras ash Sheikh. Its northern extremity is composed of cliffs about 50 feet (15 m 2) high and from it the land rises gradually 45 to Fine peak. This peak, 4,526 feet (1379-5) high is situated about 9| miles southward of Ras Sheikh Mas ud and from eastward or westward appears as a regular cone; but when seen from northward has a rounded top. See view on chart 2837a. 1 he long slope on its northern side is very conspicuous from westward. Inere 50 are two small bights at the northern extremity of the point witn white sandy beaches; on the beach, in the eastern bight, is tne tomb of the shaikh after whom the point is named. On the western side of the point, at about one mile from its extremity is Aida cove, a small bight in which there is a well of excellent water. Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] RUUS AL JABAL—WEST SIDE 99 Chart 753. With a westerly wind, a sailing vessel should avoid rounding Ras Sheikh Mas'ud closely, for under it she may be becalmed. The tidal streams eastward of Ras Sheikh Mas'ud are weak; but north-westward of a line joining that point and the northern end of 5 Jezirat al Ghanam they set south-westward and north-eastward at a rate of from 1| to 2 knots. For tidal streams in mid-channel between Ras Sheikh Mas'ud and Jezirat Henjam, see page 293. Coast—Anchorage. —From Ras Sheikh Mas'ud, the western 10 coast of Ruus al Jabal trends south-south-westward and the cliffs, broken here and there, increase in height until at Ras al Jadi, a bold cliff about 2|- miles southward that is conspicuous on north easterly and south-easterly bearings, they are 909 feet (277 m l) high. The coast south-westward of Ras Sheikh Mas'ud is open to the 15 shamal from which no shelter can be obtained in that direction; vessels at anchor off the coast should therefore weigh as soon as there are indications that it is about to blow, sailing vessels standing off on the port tack. Al Jiri, situated at the foot of the hills about 3 miles south- 20 south-westward of Ras al Jadi, is a small fishing village standing on a beach which extends southward as far as Bakhah. Jadi village, at which place there are some wells of good water near the beach, is situated about 1| miles south-south-westward of Al Jiri. Between these two villages there are some date trees. 25 Bakhah village, about 1^ miles south-south-westward of Jadi, is situated on the southern shore of a small bight, the western entrance point of which projects slightly from the general line of the coast. The bight is open northward and the depths in it are shallow the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line being about 7 cables from the 30 beach ; but there are depths of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) about 1| miles north-westward of the bight, seaward of which the depths increase suddenly to over 20 fathoms (36 m 6). There are four forts at Bakhah, one of which is in ruins; the second, is a square fort, also in ruins but with a watch tower still standing, situated on a hillock about 35 half a mile eastward of the village; the third, the position of which is indicated on chart 753, is a large fort at which the Shaikh's flag is flown, and is situated at the foot of a hillock but is not easily identified from seaward as its colour blends exactly with that of the hillock; the fourth, and by far the most conspicuous, stands on 40 the western entrance point of the bight, the tower at one of its angles being higher than the others. Inland of the village is a cultivated plain and some date groves. The inhabitants of the village are mostly fisherfolk. From Bakhah, the coast under Fine peak, see page 98, trends 45 south-south-westward for about 6^ miles to Ras ash Sha'am; it is steep-to and rocky with here and there small sandy beaches. Fudar, Ghamtha, and Tibat are fishing villages on the beaches about 1|, 3, and 4| miles, respectively, southward of Bakhah; near each village are a few date trees. 50 Ras ash Sha'am {Lat. 26° 03' NLong. 56° 05' E.) rises regularly to the summit of a mountain, about 2,500 feet (762 m 0) high and 2 miles inland, that has a notch in it and is conspicuous on north easterly and southerly bearings. From Ras ash Sha'am, the range Charts 2837a, 748b.100 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap.

COAST OF BIYAbAN mughi ST AN.— General remarks.— The coast of this sub-district of Persia, included in the administra tive district of Bandar 'Abbas, extends, on the eastern side of the entrance of the Persian gulf, from and including Jask, sgg page 83, 10 in a general north -north-westerly direction for about 81 miles to Kuhistak. . • , j Ranges of high mountains rise at some distance inland and m clear weather are good marks. There are a few villages and towns on this, and the coast, farther northward, with a mixed population, i5 the fishermen or seafaring portion being Arabs and the cultivators, &amp;c., chiefly Persians. Near most of the towns there is a certain amount of cultivated land together with groves of date trees; other trees are scarce and small, with the exception of an occasional banyan tree. 20 No supplies are to be obtained. The coast is very low, and a plain of varying width extends inland to the foot of the mountains. A feature of the district are the Mins or dangerous quicksands formed by the sun drying the surface ground while the soil below remains in a semi-fluid condition, they occur 25 chiefly upon the coast between the firm damp strip near the water s edge and the soft dry ground farther inland. The coast is imperfectly known and must be approached with great caution for in most places there are considerable depths close seaward of the coastal bank and soundings afford but little warning. 30 The coast is visible but a short distance, and care must be exercised, owing to the appearance of the high land in the background, to avoid over-estimating the distance of the vessel from it. There is no shelter from the shamal, and anchorage off the coast is bad. 35 Coast.—Aspect. —From a position about 4 miles north-westward of the mouth of Jask creek, the coast trends westward for about 24 miles to Ras al Kiih [Lut. 25° 47' N., Long. 5/° 19 E.)] it is low and sandy with tufts of grass; there are several shallow creeks which at times connect the mangrove swamps behind the coast to 40 the sea; at some distance inland are many date groves. Khor Hamad, the most important of these creeks, is used by native craft; its mouth is situated about 8 miles eastward of Ras al Kuh, and into it flows the Gangan river. Several prominent mountains and hills in this neighbourhood 45 are visible from seaward long before the coast. Gaigan hill or Jabal Dongiyol, between which and Kuh Gazdan is a great valley, is an isolated peak, rising to an elevation of 1,630 feet (496 m 8), about 12| miles northward of Cape Jask; its western side forms a great bluff which, except on easterly bearings when 50 it is less conspicuous, shows up well against the background of mountains, Perkau or Jabal Behmadi, the summit of which rises to an elevation of over 3,000 feet (914 m 4) 7 miles north-westward of Gaigan hill, Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] COAST OF BIYABAN MUGHISTAN 101 Chart 753. is separated from the latter by a gap with precipitous sides; Perkau has a long slope on its western side and a very serrated crest; on its southern slope is a natural pillar of rock about 3| miles north westward of Gaigan hill. See view facing page 100, and on chart 5 2837a. From Perkau the mountains trend north-north-westward with a valley between them and the coastal ranges. Jabal Khor Hamad, the eastern end of which is situated about 9 miles westward of Gaigan hill and 4 miles inland, is a ridge about 10 300 feet (91 ^ high, with cliffs on its southern side, extending in a westerly direction for about 2 miles. Shoals.—Caution. —-A shoal bank, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends in places for a distance of about 1| miles offshore between Jask bay and Ras al Kuh. 15 Gaha shoal, a small l|-fathom (2 m 7) soft patch with depths of 13 fathoms (23 m 8) close round it, lies, about 3 miles offshore, 16 miles west-north-westward of Cape Jask. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) lies about 2 miles southward of Gaha shoal. 20 Between Cape Jask and Ras al Kuh, vessels should not get into depths less than 27 fathoms (49 m 4) when in the vicinity of Gaha shoal. Great caution is necessary for the coast is so low that an error in judging the distance of a vessel from it is both possible and 25 probable. Coast.—Anchorage. —Ras al Kuh is very low and the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies about half a mile from it, with considerable depths close outside it; the point should therefore be given a good berth, especially at night. The coast consists of a sandy beach with tufts 30 of grass, within which the country is swampy for several miles. A small creek, the entrance of which is close north-westward of the point, is frequented by native craft; drying sands extend about 3 cables from its mouth. Mugmalam, a small village with a date grove, is situated about 3 miles north-eastward of the point. 35 From Ras al Kuh the coast trends north-north-eastward on the eastern side of the entrance of the Persian gulf. Kuh i Mubarak, situated in the swampy plain about 3J miles northward of Ras al Kuh and about one mile inland, is a very remarkable isolated rock; it is light in colour, 333 feet (101 m 5) ^ high, and cylindrical in shape; there is a small hole in its upper eastern corner, which is open on north-westerly and south-easterly bearings; except when seen against the light-coloured hills behind, the rock is conspicuous; on north-easterly and south-westerly bearings, it looks, when the low land is not in sight, like an out- 45 lying rock. See views on charts 753, 2837a. Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 6 to 10 fathoms (ll m 0 to 18 m 3), at from one-half to three-quarters of a mile offshore, about one mile south-eastward of Ras al Kuh [Lat. 25° 47' N Long. 57° 19' E.) ; but it is not sheltered from the shamal whichi 50 off the point, blows from a little northward of west. Aspect. —The Bluff, situated about 3 miles inland and 4| miles north-north-eastward of Kuh i Mubarak, rises to an elevation of • Charts 2837a, 748h.102 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV.

On the western side of the Bluff, a white pillar rock stands out conspicuously. Karai Jump is a remarkable hill of light colour, 1,910 feet (582 m 2) high, situated in the same ridge as, and about 16 miles northward of, the Bluff. When seen from westward it presents a jagged outline 10 but from north-westward or southward it appears as a fine peak with almost precipitous sides, see views on chart 2837a. Quoin hill, situated about 9| miles north-north-westward of Kuh i Mubarak, rises to an elevation of 720 feet (219 m 5) about 1J miles from the coast; it is the summit of a comparatively short 15 ridge lying parallel with, and between, the coast and the ridge in which are the Bluff and Karaf Jump; on easterly bearings Quoin hill appears conical in shape. Zangian rises to an elevation of 3,964 feet (1208 m 2) about 14 miles east-north-eastward of Karai Jump; except from close inshore, 20 when it is obscured by the lower intervening ranges, it is conspicuous; from north-westward or southward it appears conical. See view on chart 2837a. There is a valley between Zangfan and the ridge in which is Karaf Jump. Northward of Karaf Jump, the coastal hills trend north-north- 25 westward and are of irregular outline but have no remarkable peaks. Coast.—Shoals. —From Ras al Kuh, the coast trends northward for about 10 miles to Proserpine rock and the 3-fathom line lies about three-quarters of a mile offshore. Proserpine rock lies close to the coast and is about 70 feet 30 (21 m 3) high; it is quoin-shaped, the bluff being at its western end. A tower stands on the coast about lj miles northward of Proser pine rock, and northward of the tower is a small creek in which the depths are from 2 to 4 feet (0 m 6 to l m 2). Sarocan village is situated at the head of the creek and its in- 35 habitants were quite friendly when visited by H.M.S. Proserpine, in 1908. Ras ash Shir {Lat. 26° 01' NLong. 57° 12' E.) is a very low point situated about 4 miles north-westward of Sarocan village; there are one or two huts on the point, and flats dry off it for a 40 distance of nearly half a mile. Tujak is a small village about 2 miles north-eastward of the point. A shoal flat of sand and mud, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), fringes the coast northward of Proserpine rock, and off Ras ash Shir extends offshore for a distance of about 3 miles. 45 There are depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) from one to 1| miles outside the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line towards which latter the depths decrease rapidly. Ras ash Shir, and the coast northward of it, should therefore be given a wide berth, especially at night or in thick weather. 50 Kunari point is situated about 12 miles northward of Ras ash Shir and is very low, being partly covered at high water; on the intervening coast are patches of mangroves. The shoal flat of sand and mud gradually decreases in width northward of Ras ash Shir until off Kunari point its edge lies about 1| miles offshore. Charts 2837a. 748b.Chap. IV.] COAST OF BIYABAN MUGHISTAN 103 Chart 753. A detached shoal, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), lies about miles south-westward of Kunari point. From Kunari point, the coast of Biyaban Mughistan trends in a general northerly direction for about 37 miles, and between it 5 and Musandam island is the narrowest part of the entrance of the Persian gulf, see page 91. As far as Turu, a distance of about 20 miles, the coast is low, but thence coastal sand hills extend for some distance northward. The 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies from one to 2J miles off this part 10 of the coast, the depths beyond it increasing rapidly to over 20 fathoms (36 m 6); a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) has been found If miles offshore, about 5 miles north-north-westward of Kunari point. Kunari river is entered about 6 miles north-north-westward of Kunari point; in 1909, there was a depth of 4 feet (l m 2) over the 15 bar and about 14 feet (4 m 3) inside. The river was ascended in a northerly direction by boats from H.M.S. Redbreast for a distance of about 3| miles; it then appeared to divide into two branches, one flowing from north-eastward and the other from north-north westward . The banks of the river are low and covered with mangroves. 20 Curlew and oyster-catchers, herons and cranes, as well as many other kinds of birds abound. The neighbourhood of the river ap peared to be uninhabited, but Kunari town is stated to be about 11 miles above its mouth. Gaz river is entered about 8 miles northward of Kunari river and 25 appears to be deep enough to admit coasting craft; there appears to be nothing to identify its mouth from seaward. Bandar Sirik, a small backwater used by dhows, is situated near a sandy point about 6 miles northward of the mouth of Gaz river; its entrance is difficult to identify from seaward as the coast is low 30 with sand dunes on the foreshore. Behind the sand dunes are date groves extending to the foot of the hills. Sirik village is situated at some distance inland and is hardly visible from seaward. Landing may be effected about one-quater of a mile northward of Bandar Sirik. {Lat. 26° 31' N., Long. 57° 06' E.). 35 Turu, situated one mile or more northward of Bandar Sirik, is a small village in the vicinity of which are many date trees. Girau, situated about 3 miles northward of Turu, is a small village, at which there is a fort and a date grove, standing about half a mile inland. The fort, though white, is not conspicuous^ from seaward, being situated in the date grove. The sandhills on the coast are from 30 to 40 feet (9 m l to 12 m 2) high, but in them is a gap which serves to identify the position of the village. The country beyond these sandhills appears to be well cultivated. The hills approach within a distance of 3 miles from the coast 45 in the vicinity of Girau. The 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies about If miles offshore, and the 5-fathom line is about one mile beyond it. Bundram and Ziarat are two villages situated about 1| and 4f miles, respectively, northward of Girau. Kalla, is a village on the coast about 2 miles northward of Ziarat, 50 and near it a low spur of the coastal range approaches the coast. From Ziarat, the coast trends north-north-westward for about 9| miles to Kuhistak. Kuhistak is a village that may be identified by its fort, from Charts 2837a, 748b.104 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. 80 to 100 feet (24 m 4 to 30 m 5) high, standing on a little hill close eastward of it; there are some date trees in the vicinity, see view facing page 100. The inhabitants of Kuhistak are mostly fisherfolk. 5 Sheep, fowls, and eggs may be obtained in limited quantities. Tidal streams. —On the coast of Biyaban Mughistan, the tidal streams set northward and southward. Though weak eastward of Ras al Kuh, the tidal streams attain considerable strength when rounding that point and along the coast 10 northward of it, the rate at spring tides being sometimes as much as 2 knots. BANDAR ABBAS AND APPROACHES.—Aspect.— This town, is situated on the northern side of the entrance of the Persian gulf about 45 miles north-westward of Kuhistak. It is approached 15 between Jezirat Hormuz, on the north-eastern side, and Jezfrat Larak and the eastern end of Qishm island, on the south-western side. The town is situated in a bare sandy plain which rises gradually to some hills about 100 feet (30 m 5) high from one to 2 miles inland; farther inland the country becomes broken and reaches elevations 20 of from 500 to 700 feet {152 m 4 to 213 m 4); still farther inland are mountains. Kuh Ginau, a detached mountain of irregular outline, rises to an elevation of 7,690 feet (2343 m 9) about 15 miles north-north- westward of Bandar 'Abbas, [Lat. 27° 11' NLong. 56° 17' E.) 25 see chart 2837a, and view facing page 101. Khush kiih, situated about 33 miles north-eastward of Bandar 'Abbas, rises to an elevation of 8,500 feet (2590 m 8) and is very conspicuous from the entrance of the Gulf; the upper part of the western side of the mountain is a bluff and at about 8 miles eastward 30 of its summit is a remarkable cone about 5,000 feet (1524 m 0) high. See view on chart 2837a. Furgun, situated about 42 miles northward of Bandar 'Abbas, rises to an elevation of 10,660 feet (3249 m 2) and is visible in clear weather through the great valley between Kuh Ginau and Khush 35 kuh; in winter it is covered with snow. Between Kuhistak and Bandar 'Abbas the coast forms a bay the shores of which are low and swampy with mangroves in places. This coast is seldom visited by Europeans, and the soundings off it are very scanty. 40 In the vicinity of Kuhistak, the hills recede from the coast, leaving a plain from 10 to 20 miles or more in width, parts of which are fertile. Inland of this plain are high mountains, on the summits of which snow lies for months. At about 20 miles north-eastward of Kuhistak is an overhanging 45 peak or sharp pinnacle of the mountains, about 3,000 feet high, which on north-north-easterly bearings appears as two peaks; it is situated at the southern end of a level-crested range which extends north-north-westward for about 6J miles to a ragged peak of about the same elevation, see views on chart 2837a. 50 Sailing vessels.—Caution. —A sailing vessel should not approach the coast northward of Kuhistak if there is a likelihood of the shamal blowing, for in this locality it is west-south-westerly and raises a very bad sea, rendering it dangerous to become embayed off the Charts 2837a, 748b.% Chap. IV.] APPROACHES TO BANDAR 'ABBAS 105 Chart 753. coast. No native vessels visit the coast except such as can either be hauled up or can get into the creeks. For larger vessels, Hormuz, see page 107, offers the nearest place of shelter from the shamal, unless the vessel is far enough to windward to fetch in to the 5 anchorage off Qishm, see page 108. Coast. —From Kuhistak, the coast trends north-north-westward for about 10 miles to Khargun in the vicinity of which it is low and sandy; but the place may be identified by a turtle-backed hillock and some date palms. io Khargun is a small village peopled by fisherfolk. Close northward of the village is a creek, formed by the mouth of Mazawi river, that affords shelter to the boats. The mouth of Minab river is situated about 5| miles north westward of that of Mazawi river. In ordinary times very little 15 of the water in the river flows down to the sea as it is nearly all diverted by irrigation canals. Apparently detached shoals, over which the depths, respectively, are 5 and 10 fathoms (9 m l and 18 m 3), were reported, in 1910, to lie about 5| miles west-south-westward and 6| miles south-westward 20 of the mouth of Minab river. Kh5r Minab, a salt water mangrove creek, is entered about 6 miles north-westward of the mouth of Minab river and is the port of Minab; it can be entered by small craft of 20 tons and less; but the bar, which nearly dries, is impracticable during a shamal. There are 25 very similar creeks on either side of Khor Minab, but the entrance of the latter may be identified from its position in relation to two large mangrove trees, growing close together at a short distance south-eastward of it. The middle of the bar is marked by a wooden post, about 6 feet (l m 8) high. From the bar, the creek trends north- 30 eastward through sand and mud flats for about 1^ miles; thence it trends south-eastward between banks covered with mangroves for about 2 miles, and then east-north-eastward for about 4 miles to its head. The banks are everywhere flooded at high-water, and above the head of the creek the river decreases in size until it is a 35 mere ditch. Minab town [Lat. 27° 09' NLong. 57° 05' E.) is situated about 13 miles north-eastward of the mouth of Minab river; the fort is situated on a hill close to the river, and appears large and imposing, though it is very dilapidated. The town is a collection of mat 40 huts, but at the foot of the hill on which stands the fort are a number of substantial buildings; on its southern side are extensive gardens and plantations; the bazaar is outside the fort and is well supplied; the inhabitants are well disposed to Europeans. The district pro duces dates, plantains, mangroves, wheat, henna, &amp;c.; rice and ^5 wheat are imported; dates, henna, wool, and ghi are exported. The coast trends west-north-westward from Khor Minab and is low and swampy, the eastern portion being covered with man groves ; it is bordered by a mud flat which extends offshore from one to 2 miles, the depths beyond that distance being from 3 to 4 fathoms 50 {5*5 to 7 m 3). Jezirat Hormuz. —This island has a long low point on its northern side which extends from a plain to within 2| miles of the coast about 17 miles westward of the mouth of Khor Minab. The island is for Charts 2837a, 748b. 5400106 entrance of persian gulf [Chap. IV. Chart 753. the most part hilly, the hills being about 300 feet (91 m 4) high, with a very rugged outline and marked by a variety of colours, such as red, purple, etc.; in the centre of the island, a few white peaks, 5 resembling snow-clad hills, rise above the rest. Great White peak attaining an elevation of 690 feet (210 IIl 3); this peak has a very sharply-defined summit and a long slope on its eastern side. The hills, with the remarkable exception of the white peaks, are chiefly of rock salt with a thin incrustation of various coloured earths; 10 but near the southern and south-eastern coasts is a range not composed of salt; on the eastern coast are a few rocky hillocks. The southern and south-western coasts are cliffy. See views facing page 101, and on chart 2837a. At one time a city stood on the plain on the northern side of the 15 island, but the only remains now visible from seaward are those of the Portuguese fort situated on the point; the fort is in a dilapidated condition having, it is said, been damaged by an earthquake in 1902; its highest part is 45 feet (13 m 7) high. A minaret, 70 feet (21 m 3) high, stands about 2 cables southward of the fort. 20 Hormuz village [Lat. 27° 05' N., Long. 56° 27' E.) is a collection of mat huts close southward of the fort, and the plain on which it stands is carefully cultivated; the inhabitants also include a number of fishermen. In the hot weather, during the south-west monsoon, a large proportion of the people go to Minab where they obtain 25 employment during the date harvest. Red oxide is worked in the interior of the island and is brought down to a position near the fort for shipment, by dhows, into steam vessels which call for that purpose. The north-eastern side of the fort presents a remarkable spectacle from seaward, being coloured 30 a vivid red purple by the dust from the oxide. Supplies cannot be obtained, and what little water there is is stored in reservoirs; that flowing from the hills, even in rainy weather, is saturated with brine. Good gazelle shooting may be obtained in the island. 35 Shoals. —The eastern and south-eastern coasts of Jezirat Hormuz are fringed with reefs to a distance of from 2 to 6 cables offshore. A shallow flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends from the western side of the island for a distance of about 1^ miles. 40 Euphrates patch, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), lies about 2 miles south-westward of the south-western extremity of the island; it is steep-to, except on its north-eastern side which is joined to the flat extending from the western side of the island. A shoal spit, over which the depths are 3 fathoms (5 m 5) and less, 45 extends for a distance of about 2 miles westward from the Portuguese fort, and thence north-north-westward, across the western approach to the channel northward of Jezirat Hormuz, for a distance of nearly 2J miles. Shoal water extends for about 6 cables eastward of the point 50 on which stands the Portuguese fort, and a drying flat extends about 3| cables northward from the eastern part of the northern coast of the island, with depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) half a mile farther northward. A shallow flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms Charts 2837a, 748h.Chap. IV.] APPROACHES TO BANDAR 'ABBAS 107 Chart 753. (5 m 5), fringes the mainland opposite Jezirat Hormuz and extends offshore to within a distance of about three-quarters of a mile of the Portuguese fort. A shoal spit, over which the depths are 3 fathoms (5 in 5) 5 and less, extends from the flat bordering the mainland and lies, with its extremity about 2| miles east-north-eastward of the Portu guese fort, on the northern side of the eastern entrance of the channel northward of Jezirat Hormuz. Anchorage.—Directions. —Anchorage may be obtained on the 10 northern side of Jezirat Hormuz with the Portuguese fort bearing about 236°, distant half a mile, in depths of from 7 to 8 fathoms (12 m 8 to 14 m 6), mud; small vessels anchor nearer the village. The anchorage is sheltered, except from the nashi, on the occurrence of which the native craft shift to the western side of the point on 15 which stands the fort. This anchorage {Lat. 27° 06'N., Long. 56° 28' E.) should be approached with caution as the channel between Jezi'rat Hormuz and the mainland has not been properly surveyed. From a position about one mile eastward of the eastern side of 20 the island vessels should steer north-north-westward until the Portuguese fort bears 255° whence a westerly course may be steered until it bears 236°; the fort may then be approached on the latter bearing, anchorage being obtained as previously directed. This channel is used by vessels, calling to load red oxide, drawing 25 sometimes as much as 25 feet (7 m 6); in 1924, H.M.S. Triad reported that, from soundings obtained whilst passing through this channel, it would appear that the least depth in the fairway is about 3| fathoms (6 m 9). To proceed north-westward from the anchorage, vessels should 30 pass about one-quarter of a mile northward of the fort, and bring a ruined chapel on the northern coast of the island open its own width north-eastward of the high south-eastern tower of the Portuguese fort, bearing 125°, astern; this will carry the vessel through the western channel in a least depth of about 2| fathoms (5 m 0); when 35 the high peak of Jezirat Larak bears 188°, course may be altered westward or south-westward as requisite. Jezirat Larak .—Anchorage .—This island, the north-eastern extremity of which lies about 9| miles south-south-westward of the southern end of Jezfrat Hormuz, is generally barren; the highest 40 peak of its rugged hills, is square in shape and rises to an elevation of 510 feet (155 m 4). A conical peak, 456 feet (139 m 0) high and situated about one mile south-westward of the highest peak, shows up best on north-westerly and south-easterly bearings. There are two table-topped hills close together on the eastern side of the 45 island which show up well from north or south, but are obscured against the hills behind them when viewed from eastward. See views facing page 101 and on chart 2837a. The coasts of the island, generally, are steep-to; but the shore reef extends for a distance of about 4 cables from its western side. 50 At night, Larak and Hormuz are very similar in appearance, on north-westerly bearings; but the depths at similar distances are greater south-eastward of Larak than those south-eastward of Hormuz. On the northern side of Larak is a low sandy point, nearly 2 Charts 2837a, 748b.108 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. miles eastward of which is an old Dutch fort and the little fishing village of Labtiyab. A small quantity of water is contained in reservoirs. 5 The island is covered with a stunted vegetation, and near the village are a few small date trees. Anchorage, in depths of about 13 fathoms (23 m 8), may be obtained off the northern coast of Jezirat Larak, between the low point and the village, at about half a mile offshore and 3 cables from the edge 10 of drying sands; off the village, the bottom is rock, and there the coastal reef extends offshore for about one cable. The anchorage is sheltered only from the shamal and is not recommended. Oishm. —Qishm, situated on the eastern end of Qishm island, see page 111, was once a large and well-built town standing on a i5 fairly level, sandy site close to the water's edge; earthquakes, however, have destroyed half the town, the highest building remaining being from 50 to 60 feet (15 m 2 to 18 m 3) high. There is a small date grove on either side of the town and at a short distance southward of it are several domed water reservoirs; in dry seasons 20 these latter fail, and, in extreme cases, the wells also; when this happens water has to be brought to the town from other parts of the island where it seems to be fairly plentiful. The land behind the town, and southward of it, rises in a gradual slope to a hill, the northern and western sides of which are precipitous; 25 its fiat summit, 560 feet (170 m 7) high, is situated about 3 miles westward of the town. Meat or cattle, vegetables, and bread can be obtained. The water in the wells is fairly good. The inhabitants are engaged in boat-building and fishing. 30 Shoals.—Light-buoy. —Several shoals, over which the depths are from 2| to 3 fathoms (4 m 6 to 5 m 5), sand, lie from one to 1^ miles offshore eastward and north-eastward of Qishm town [Lat. 26° 57' N Long. 56° 17' E.)] these shoals lie on a flat, over which the general depths are from 3^ to 3^ fathoms (5 m 9 to 6 ni 4), that extends parallel 35 with the coast for some distance north-westward of the town; the outer edges of these shoals are steep-to and between them and the coast there are depths of from 3J to 7 fathoms (5 m 9 to 12 m 8). Off the town the depths shoal very rapidly towards the inner side of the flat. 40 A drying flat extends nearly 2 cables offshore on the northern side of the town, and a shoal bank extends about 3 cables off its eastern side; this bank fringes the coast southward of the town and at 1J miles in that direction extends offshore for about 6 cables. The shoals are marked by discoloured water. 45 A light-buoy, exhibiting a white flashing light, is moored about 1J miles eastward of Qishm fort and marks the southern side of a channel, half a mile wide, in which the depths are about 3J fathoms (5 m 9); this channel leads, between the shoals, to the anchorage. Anchorage.—Directions. —Anchorage may be obtained anywhere 50 northward of the flat off Qishm; a good position is in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll 11 ^)), at about 2 miles offshore. Vessels whose draught will permit them to cross the flat may anchor in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), mud, with the fort bearing 180°, distant about three-quarters of a mile. Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] bandar 'abbas 109 Chart 753. Anchorage is prohibited between lines drawn north-north-eastward from positions on the coast about 5 and 9 cables, respectively, north-westward of the fort at Qishm. The anchorage near the town is well sheltered from the shamal, 5 and the nashi does not raise a heavy sea; but the tidal streams cause a vessel at anchor there to lie broadside on to the prevailing wind and to ride uneasily. Off the town and over the shoal banks, the tidal streams attain a rate of 2 knots at springs, and cause ripples. 10 Vessels approaching the anchorage off Qishm should proceed as for Bandar 'Abbas, see page 110, until the fort at Qishm bears 210°, when they should alter course to pass between the 2f and 3-fathom (5 m 0 and 5 m 5) patches north-eastward of the town and thence steer for the anchorage. Or, preferably, when Qishm fort flagstaff bears 15 218°, it may be kept so until abreast the light-buoy when course should be altered to 300° for the anchorage. In either case caution is necessary. It is not advisable to approach the anchorage from southward without local knowledge, as the fort and its flagstaff are difficult 20 to identify. Chart 3599, plan of Bandar 'Ahhas. Bandar ' Abbas .—This town is fronted by a flat from one to 2 miles wide, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lying from 2 to 4 miles offshore. The beach 25 is of firm sand and dries for about one cable off high water mark; landing on it at low water is bad, and at times the surf is very heavy. The town has a frontage on the beach of about 1| miles and is a place of considerable importance and increasing trade, being the end of the caravan route from Kerman, 327 miles inland, to which 30 place it is connected by a motor road, the distance by this route being 345 miles. The official language is Persian, but the bulk of the people speak a patois almost unintelligible except to themselves. The town is the seat of the Persian Deputy Governor, who is sub ordinate to the Governor of the Gulf Ports. 35 During the hot season many of the inhabitants migrate to Minab, etc. There is a pier in the middle of the foreshore in front of the Customs- house. The masonry portion of the pier dries and lighters can go alongside only from about 3 hours before until 3 hours after high 40 water; but it has been extended by a wooden deck on iron piles, with steps at its head in a depth of about 3 feet (0 m 9). On the pier is a narrow gauge railway, and a flagstaff. The port [Lat. 27° 11' N., Long. 56° 17' E.) is the entrepot for goods destined for the south-eastern part of Persia, the two 45 chief towns of which are Yezd and Kerman. Naiband village is situated 2^ miles eastward of the pier and its vicinity may be identified by a conspicuous date grove. Ab-i-Murgh, immediately eastward of Bandar 'Abbas, and the stream on which stands Naiband appear to be usually dry; only a 50 few insignificant pools were observed 24 hours after very heavy rain. Siru village is situated on the coast about 2 miles westward of the pier. Charts 753, 2837a. 748b. '110 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 3599, plan of Bandar 'Abhas. Khazar mosque, between Siru and Bandar 'Abbas is conspicuous. Great Britain is represented by a Consul; the Consulate, an isolated, conspicuous, grey stone, two storied house with a flagstaff, 5 stands, half a mile inland, about one mile north-eastward of the pier. For steamship communications, see page 28. Climate and health. —The climate of Bandar 'Abbas is not unhealthy, and from October to April, inclusive, is extremely pleasant. In winter, when the mountains to the north are covered 10 with snow, the air is dry, clear, and bracing. In summer, however, these rocky masses reflect heat on to the plain below, and the climate is damp, hot, and relaxing, but is not such as to render it by any means insupportable to a European who is comfortably lodged, and the land and sea breezes, which are then fairly regular, do i5 much to mitigate the heat. The prevailing diseases are malarial fever and diseases of the skin; other diseases seldom exist in epidemic form. Sanitation of even the most elementary description is unknown. Trade.—Supplies. —The principal imports are matches, candles, rice, sugar, tea, spices, iron, and cotton and woollen goods; the exports are ghi, almonds and pistachios, raisins, currants, dates, asafoetida, gum, wool, and carpets. Meat, bread, and vegetables, also cattle and rice, can be obtained. Drinking water comes from dirty reservoirs, situated westward 25 of the town, where the surface rain-water is collected in masonry tanks, called 'birkehs'; these are covered by conspicuous dome- shaped roofs, see page 7. It is also obtained from shallow, unbuilt wells, sunk in the dry bed of the river at Naiband; this is of bad quality and requires filtering; the water elsewhere is brackish. 30 Only a few tons can be supplied at a time. There is a good bazaar in the town. Anchorage.—Buoy.—Directions. —Anchorage off Bandar 'Abbas is prohibited in the area indicated by pecked lines on chart 3599. A red can buoy {Lat. 27° 09' N., Long. 56° 19' E.), with staff 35 and globe topmark, is moored on the eastern side of the prohibited anchorage about 2 miles offshore south-south-eastward of the British Consulate. Vessels usually anchor eastward and in the vicinity of the red buoy. During fine weather, small craft anchor closer inshore. 40 The holding ground is good and the anchorage is well sheltered, except from south-eastward. The tidal streams at the anchorage set westward and eastward. Chart 753. Vessels approaching Bandar 'Abbas or the anchorage off Qishm 45 may pass on either side of Jezfrat Larak. When passing between Jezirat Hormuz and Jezirat Larak, the latter may be approached to a distance of half a mile but the eastern end of Qishm island must be given a berth of at least 2 miles to clear the shoals off it, and Hormuz must not be closed within a 50 distance of 2| miles to avoid Euphrates patch. If passing between Larak and Qishm island, the shoal ground off the western side of the former must be avoided, and the eastern end of the latter should be given a berth of at least 2 miles to clear the shoals off Qishm town. The coast southward of the town can Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] QISHM ISLAND HI Chart 753. be approached to a distance of one mile until nearing the offlying jstafi, patches, but the depths shoal quickly to the reef fringing the coast. ; pj er ' It is advisable to keep on the Larak side of the channel as the currents are irregular near the shoals off the eastern end of Qishm island. 5 OISHM ISLAND .—Qishm (Kishm) island or Jezirat at Tawila is the largest island in the Persian gulf. It lies nearly parallel with the coast of Persia from which it is separated by Clarence strait, see page 120. It rises in light-coloured table-topped hills with precipitous 10 broken-down sides, in many places remarkable in appearance, see view facing page 112. On the island are a few towns and numerous villages; the inhabi tants are for the most part poor and only trade in the barest necessaries of life. ^ There is much game on the island; wild goats, partridges, and rock-pigeons abound in the hills, and on the plains are to be found many small antelopes or gazelles. From May to October, inclusive, the climate is exceedingly trying. Coast.— From Qishm town, sgg page 108, the south-eastern coast 20 of Qishm island trends southward and south-westward for about 25 miles to Ras Khargu, see page 113. Westward of the hills behind Qishm, a low plain extends across the island for several miles. Westward of the plain are a number of table-topped hills which decrease in height towards Ras Khargu and are precipitous on their 25 seaward sides. A white cone or sugar-loaf, 446 feet (135 m 9) high, and situated about 2 miles northward of Suzeh [Lat. 26° 47' N Long. 56° 05' £.) a village on the coast about 15 miles south- westward of Qishm, rises between a long plateau and a remarkable white hill, 509 feet (155 m l) high, with a small cone at its southern SO end; all show up well from seaward. Behind the coastal hills, rise Finger peak, 941 feet (286 m 8) high and Jabal Biscoe, 994 feet (303 m 0) high, both near the centre of the island. See page 121. The shores of the bight south-westward of the hill behind Qishm 35 are low and sandy but farther south-westward, as far as Ras Khargu, the coast is a succession of rocky patches between wl ich are small sandy beaches. This coast is open to the shamal which in this locality blows from between south-west and west-south-west. 40 In most places depths of 15 fathoms (27 m 4) will be found about one mile offshore. At about 2 miles north-eastward of Suzeh is a flat rocky islet 59 feet (18 m 0) high with vertical sides, lying about 0 cables off a rocky point; within this islet is a small bay in which the depths 45 are about^ 1| fathoms {2 m 7) and in which native craft shelter during the shamal; at about one mile north-eastward of the islet are three others lying about 4 cables offshore with foul ground between them and the coast; they are smaller than the first mentioned, the middle and largest being 56 feet (17 m l) high, the northern one is a flat 50 ledge of rock only one or 2 feet (0 m 3 or 0 m 6) high. Suzeh is a small village with a date grove; it possesses a number of trading dhows but sends no boats to the pearl fisheries. Most of Charts 2837a, 748b.112 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV.

At about half a mile eastward of the village is a ruined tomb or mosque with a dome. 5 Masan is a small village on the coast, with a date grove, situated about 4| miles south-westward of Suzeh; inland of the village are some ruins and an old mosque. At about one mile north westward of the village is a remarkable isolated crag, 270 feet (82 m 3) high, that shows up well on westerly bearings. 10 Shoals.—Banks. —At about 3J miles south-westward of Jezirat Larak, and about 6J miles from the coast of Qishm island, there is a 17-fathom (31 m l) bank with depths of from 25 to 30 fathoms (45 m 7 to 54 m 9) between it and the coast; it extends in a south-westerly direction for more than 4 miles and it is said that the least depth 15 over it is 12 fathoms (21 n 9), but the locality has not been sounded over. A shoal, on which, towards low water, the sea breaks in moderate weather, lies about 9 cables south-south-westward of Suzeh, but its position has not been accurately determined. 20 Depths less than those shown on the chart were reported, in 1927, to exist at about 2 mi.es southward of Masan. Patrick Stewart bank is a detached patch, over which the least depth obtained is 14 fathoms (25 m 6), lying about 8J miles south- south-eastward of Suzeh, with greater depths close round it, 25 Tidal streams .-—For Tidal streams in mid-channel between Jezirat Henjam anc the Musandam peninsula, see page 293.

Jezirat Henjam. —This island lies off the middle of the south eastern side of Qishm island with its north-eastern end about 30 one mile south-westward of Ras Khargu; its barren hills, which decrease in elevation from its northern to its comparatively low southern end, are covered with coarse grass and brushwood, and in colour the islsnd is rather dark, see view facing this page. Table hill, sitiated near the northern end of the island, rises to 35 an elevation of 359 feet (103 m 3); though remarkable on some bearings, it does not show up well when seen from southward against the higher land of Qishm island; on its summit is an inconspicuous whitewashed stone cairn, 7 feet (2 m l) in height. See view on chart 2837a. {Lat. 26° 41' NLong. 55° 53' E). 40 Jabal Mushi, about 3 cables northward of Table hill and separated from it by a low valley stretching from east to west across the northern end of Jezirat Henjam, is 262 feet (79 m 9) high and on its summit is a :aim, 10 feet (3 ni 0) in height. Mitre hill, from which an irregular ridge extends in a south-easterly 45 direction for learly one mile, rises to an elevation of 350feet (106 m 7) about 7 cables south-eastward of Table hill. It has a double summit, the eastern oeing surmounted by a large and conspicuous cairn! On the nortl-eastern side of the ridge is a rocky plateau, 130 feet (39 m 6) high falling in cliffs to the valley. 50 There is a small village near some date groves on the western side of the island, and a much larger Arab village near the point at its southern end, A Persian doctor is Quarantine officer at Henjam, A small Persian garrison is maintained on the island. Charts 2837a, 748h.Chap. IV.] QISHM ISLAND 113 Chart 3599, plan of Hanjam sound, Henjam sound.— The strait between Jezirat Henjam and Qishm island is known as Henjam sound. Ras Khargu [Lat. 26° 42' N., Long. 55° 56' E.), on the north eastern side of the sound, is low and rocky rising gently to an 5 elevation of a little over 100 feet (30 m 5) where it ends, about one mile inland, in a cliff that drops to a sandy plain from which latter rise several plateaux. At a short distance eastward of the point is a whitewashed cairn, 18 feet (5 m 5) high. See view on chart 2837a. From Ras Khargu the coast trends northward and north- 10 westward and for the first 1| miles is rocky, beyond that it is low and sandy. A conspicuous stone hut stands on the coast about 4 cables north-westward of Ras Khargu, and about 4 cables farther north-westward are the ruins of a similar hut. White point, on the south-western side of the sound, is situated 15 about 1| miles south-south-westward of Ras Khargu; on it is a cairn 29 feet (8 m 8) high. From White point, the coast of Jezirat Henjam trends north-westward for about 2 miles to Ras al Mashia and consists of rocky points separated by sandy beaches. Ras Giohdna, situated about three-quarters of a mile north- 20 north-westward of White point, is marked by a cairn. Ras al Mashia, the northern extremity of Jezirat Henjam, is low and sandy; from it the coast trends west-south-westward for about 8| cables to Ras Buser. Ras Buser is marked by a cairn, 10 feet (3 m 0) in height, and a 25 similar cairn stands, on the slope of Jabal Mushi, between it and that on the summit of the hill. From Ras Buser the coast trends south-south-westward for about 2J miles to Khail. In the eastern approach to the strait, the channel between the shoals on either side has a least depth of 5^ fathoms (9 m 6) over a 30 width of 2| cables, and a depth greater than 4 fathoms (7 m 3) over a width of 4 cables. In the western approach the depths are from 5-| to 6 fathoms (9 m 6 to llmO). Shoals.—Buoy— Depths less than 3 fathoms (5^5) will he 35 found within 3 cables of the coast eastward of Ras Khargu, and southward of the point, rocky uneven ground, over which the depths are similar, extends offshore for about 4| cables. A red conical buoy marks the outer edge of the shoal water south ward of Ras Khargu. 40 Maundrell shoal, over which the least known depth is 3^ fathoms (5 m 9), lies between 8 and 15 cables south-eastward of Ras Khargu, to the shoal ground off which latter it is connected by a ridge with depths less than 6 fathoms (ll m 0) over it. Vessels should avoid passing between Maundrell shoal and the coast of Qishm island. 45 The coastal bank, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends for a distance of half a mile offshore between White point and Ras Giohdna, whence to Ras al Mashia the edge of the bank is about 2 cables offshore. A shoal spit extends nearly one cable northward of Ras al Mashia. 50 North-westward of Ras Khargu, depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found within 3 cables of the coast between that point and the conspicuous stone hut, northward of which latter similar depths will be found about 1^ cables offshore.

Bevan patch, on the north-eastern side of the sound, lies, about half a mile offshore, 1J miles north-westward of Ras Khargu; the least known depth over the shoal is 2J fathoms (4 m l), but the depths 5 northward and north-westward of it are less than 5 fathoms (9 m l); a ridge, over which the depths are from 3| to 4|- fathoms (6 m 9 to 8 m 2), extends west-north-westward from Bevan patch for a distance of about 9 cables. Mushi patch, over which the least known depth is 5J fathoms 10 (9 m 6), lies between 8| and 11| cables north-westward of Ras al Mashia. A patch, over which the depths are less than 6 fathoms (ll m 0), lies close south-eastward of Mushi patch. A rocky bank, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), fringes the coast of Jezirat Henjam westward of Ras al Mashia; 15 between that point and Ras Buser it extends about 2 cables offshore, but southward of Ras Buser its outer edge lies from 5 to 6 cables from the coast. The outer edge of this bank is steep-to. Lights.—Buoys.—Signal Station. —A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 128 feet (39 m 0), from the north-eastern corner of the 20 telegraph building situated about 4 cables southward of Ras al Mashia. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 26 feet (7 m 9), from a white iron column on a concrete base, erected about one cable south ward of Ras al Mashia. 25 A beacon, consisting of concrete blocks surmounted by a staff and triangle, painted white and 25 feet (7 m 6) in height, is erected near the extremity of Ras al Mashia. A mooring buoy has been established about 3| cables north-westward of the beacon on Ras al Mashia. Three small mooring-buoys for 30 the use of aircraft are established about 3 cables east-south-eastward of Ras al Mashia [Lat. 26° 42' N., Long. 55° 54' E.). A signal station, at which reports can be transmitted through Lloyd's, is situated at the telegraph building; no lookout is kept and vessels wishing to communicate must attract attention by blasts 35 on the steam whistle or siren; the British flag is flown from the flagstaff; there is another flagstaff about one cable eastward of the telegraph building. A W/T mast, 205 feet (62 m 5) in height, with four secondary masts near it, is erected about one cable north-north-westward of the 40 telegraph building. Anchorages.—Directions. —Bandar Sharki, eastward of Ras al Mashia, is sheltered but is not a desirable anchorage on account of the hard bottom and the strong tidal streams and eddies there, 45 Anchorage is prohibited south-eastward of the pecked line, shown on the plan on chart 3599, joining a white stone hut, situated about half a mile south-eastward of Ras al Mashia, and the conspicuous stone hut north-westward of Ras Khargu. Bandar Gharbi, north-westward of Ras al Mashia, is partially 50 sheltered from the shamal which there blows from south-westward. The depths are somewhat irregular, being from 5| to 10 fathoms (10 m l to }8 m 3), sand and mud. The best position in which to anchor is in a depth of from 7 to 9 fathoms (12 m 8 to 16 m 5), with the Charts 753, 2837a, 748b.Chap.

Anchorage is prohibited south-westward of the pecked line, shown on the plan on chart 3599, drawn 303° from Ras al Mashia. 5 Avery satisfactory berth is with the light on Ras al Mashia bearing 183° distant 3f cables. In the hot weather, any cool wind there may be is felt and it is not laden with sand or dust. The position is open to a strong shamal and slight sea but the holding ground is good; it cannot, however, be recommended during the winter months. {Lat. 26° 42' N., Long. 55° 54' E.). Vessels drawing more than 20 feet (6 m l), entering Henjam sound from south-eastward, should exercise great caution and should keep well southward of Maundrell shoal. It is recommended to enter with the western edge of a conspicuous clump of trees close north- 15 ward of the conspicuous stone hut, north-westward of Ras Khargu, bearing 340°, but care must be taken to alter course north-westward in good time to avoid the foul ground marked by the buoy southward of that point. During a shamal it is better to approach the anchorage by the eastern, rather than the western entrance. 20 Tidal streams. —Eastward of Ras al Mashia, the tidal streams run north-westward and south-eastward; and at times attain a rate of nearly knots, see table, page 294. Port facilities.—Communications. —A pier extends for a distance of about half a cable in a north-easterly direction from 25 a position close south-eastward of Ras al Mashia; there is a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9) alongside the steps; at the root of the pier is a large brick storehouse. Landing can also be effected on the north-western side of Ras al Mashia where the beach is moderately steep. Oil fuel barges are moored in Bandar Gharbi about 4 cables north- 30 westward of Ras al Mashia. At night they exhibit riding lights. Turtle can be obtained from the local fishermen. Beef, and a very limited quantity of mutton is to be had, but 24 hours'notice must be given. Sea fishing and seining is good, and oysters can be taken from the rocks at low water. 35 A stock of Indian coal is kept in lighters; Welsh coal can be obtained at 48 hours' notice, the time being required for the loading of the lighters. Customs regulations are strictly enforced by the Persian authorities and duty is levied on every article landed. 40 There is cable communication with all parts, see page 29. For W/T communication, see page 29. For steamship communications, see page 28. Coast.—Danger.—Anchorage.— Ras Salagh is situated on the southern coast of Qishm island, about 9| miles westward of Ras 45 Khargu, and between those points the coast recedes to formDairistan (Deriston) bay, the shores of which are low and sandy. The depths in Dairistan bay are from 3 to 5 fathoms (5 m 5 to 9 nl l) shoaling gradually to the shore. Chart 753. 5 q Dairistan (Deriston) is a small village situated about 1J miles inland and 4 miles north-north-westward of Ras Khargu. Quoin hill, situated about 2| miles inland of the northern shore of Dairistan bay, is 344 feet (104 m 8) high, long and conspicuous; Charts 2837a, 748b.116 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. between it and the hills northward of Dairistan is a large swampy plain; behind the plain rises Jabal Biscoe, the summit of which is a pronounced peak that shows up well from southward, see 5 page 111. Ras Salagh (Lat. 26° 41' N., Long. 55° 46' E.) is a sandy point, but it has a rocky beach; it may be approached to a distance of about half a mile; the hills are about 2 miles inland of Ras Salagh. From Ras Salagh, the coast trends in a general west-south-westerly 10 direction for about 26^ miles to Ras Dastakan the south-western extremity of Qishm island. Salagh is a large fishing village, near the shore of the bay westward of Ras Salagh, situated about 2^ miles from that point; at the village are a few date trees and some wells. 15 Ras Tarkun is a rocky point situated about 8 miles west-south- westward of Ras Salagh. The coast between Dairistan bay and Ras Tarkun is low and sandy, but the land soon rises gently to cliffs, of varying height, which face landward and drop to the floor of a flat valley or plain beyond which the hills rise with broken and 20 precipitous sides; at about 2 miles inland of Salagh, they form a plateau about 3^ miles long, westward of which they become confused, rising in varied and often fantastic forms. A rock, over which there is a depth of only one foot (0 m 3), lies about If miles east-south-eastward of Ras Tarkun near the edge of 25 a bank that there fringes the coast. A black chimney, 80 feet (24 m 4) high, rises from the buildings of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company about 2^ cables eastward of Ras Tarkun; it is conspicuous, except from eastward when it is difficult to distinguish it from the dark hills behind it. There are 30 two small but conspicuous trees about one mile north-eastward of the chimney. Anchorage may be obtained off Ras Tarkun in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) at a distance of three-quarters of a mile offshore; it should be approached with the chimney bearing 013° in order to avoid 35 the rock off that point. Landing is bad, for a ridge of sand which nearly dries runs parallel with and about one cable off the beach. The best place is said to be at a short distance westward of the path leading to the oil company's main building. There is a jetty, opposite the tall chimney, but it appears to dry at about half tide. 40 Chart 35. Kish kiih, a hill with a small table-top, is noticeable and rises to an elevation of 1,331 feet (405 m 7) about 4 miles west-north westward of Ras Tarkun. See view on chart 2837a. Namakdan, a range of dark red hills, largely composed of salt, with patches of 45 slate colour, crosses the island from north to south about 3 miles westward of Kish kuh. There are extensive salt caves at the southern end of the range from which brine exudes onto the plain between them and the sea and where, on evaporation, it leaves a large deposit of salt. Close westward of a point near the southern end of these 50 hills, and about 10J miles east-north-eastward of Ras Dastakan, is a small stone hut which, though not conspicuous, has been found to be a useful mark for fixing the position of the vessel when approaching the inshore passage round the western end of Qishm island; there are some fishing stakes close southward of the hut.

Jezirat Tunb.—Light. —This island, the northern end of which is situated about 15 miles southward of Ras Dastakan, is under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. It is 175 feet 5 (53 m 3) high, brown in colour, and level in outline; near its north eastern extremity is a small peaked hummock that is conspicuous on north-easterly and south-westerly bearings. See views on chart 2837a, and facing this page. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 233 feet (71 m 0) ) from a 10 white iron framework structure, 71 feet (21 m 6) in height, erected on the summit of Jezirat Tunb. Except at the northern and southern ends, where there are sandy beaches, the eastern side of Jezirat Tunb consists of a low rocky cliff. The south-eastern extremity of the island is a sandy spit, 15 almost steep-to, on the northern side of which is a bay with depths of from 3 to 4 fathoms (5 m 5 to 7 m 3) at about 2 cables, and 9 fathoms (16 m 5) at half a mile, offshore; beyond the latter distance, the depths increase rapidly to over 30 fathoms (54 m 9). Foul ground extends for a short distance from the south-western 20 part of the island. On the southern side of the island, at a short distance inland, there is a hamlet, consisting of about half a dozen well-built houses with cultivated gardens, near which is a flagstaff; there are some wells at the village and near the beach are some huts used occasionally 25 by fishermen. The island is covered with coarse grass and shrubs, and on it are many small and very poisonous snakes; a considerable number of goats and some cattle are kept; fine oysters are to be had. Off-lying dangers.—Banks. —Coote rock, over which the SO least depth obtained is fathoms (8 m 2), lies about 5 miles east ward of the north-eastern extremity of Jezirat Tunb. The tidal streams, which there attain a rate of from 2 to 3 knots at springs, cause strong ripples over the rock. A heavy tide rip often occurs over a 19-fathom (34 m 7) bank situated -3-5 about 3 miles northward of the light-structure on Jezirat Tunb; and also over a 12-fathom (21 m 9) bank about 3^ miles west-north- westward of the light-structure. Two rocky patches, over which the depths are, respectively, 7| and 6| fathoms (13 m 7 and 12 m 3), lie about 3 miles southward 40 and 4 miles south-south-eastward of Jezirat Tunb. The depths between these patches and the island are very uneven and cause overfalls. Clive rock {Lat. 26° 15' N., Long. 55° 18' E.), on which the E.I.C.S. Clive struck in 1835, lies about 4 cables west-north -west ward of the south-western extremity of Jezirat Tunb; it is a detached rock, drying 10 feet (3 m 0) with depths of from 3 to 4 fathoms (5 m 5 to 7 m 3) close round it. A rock, which dries 2 feet (0 m 6), lies about 2| cables south-south eastward of Clive rock, and between them is another over which 50 the depth is 5 feet (l m 5). Ormonde rock, over which there is a depth of 7 feet (2 m l), lies about 4i cables west-south-westward of Clive rock, with depths of 4 and 5 fathoms (7 m 3 and 9 m l) close round it; and another rock, over which there is a depth of 10 feet (3 m 0), lies, about 3 cables Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap.

Anchorage. —The best anchorage at Jezirat Tunb for a steam vessel is in a depth of from 7| to 10 fathoms (13 m 7 to 18 m 3) on the eastern side of the island. In this position the vessel is sheltered 5 from the shamal, though exposed to the nashi, but the tidal streams are not so strong as they are southward of the island. In 1931, H .M.S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), rock, with a conspicuous white hut on the south-eastern point of the island bearing 236°, distant 4| cables. 1 Anchorage may be obtained off the southern side of the island, in a depth of 6 or 7 fathoms (ll m 0 or 12 ni 8); but the tidal streams run strongly eastward and westward. During strong south-easterly winds, sheltered anchorage may be obtained north-westward of the island in from 7 to 8 fathoms 15 (12 m 8 to I4 m 6), at a distance of about 4| cables offshore, with the light-structure bearing 097°. When approaching this anchorage, due allowance must be made for the tidal stream. The best landing, except when the nashi is blowing, is on the beach in the bay northward of the south-eastern extremity of the 20 island. Landing can also be effected at the village on the southern side of the island, or on a sandy beach on its north-western side. Tidal streams. —For tidal streams in the vicinity of Jezirat Tunb, see page 294; overfalls have been observed about 3 miles southward and 2| miles north-westward of the island, those in 25 the former position being the stronger. Jezirat Nabiyu Tunb. —This island, situated about 7 miles westward of the western extremity of Jezirat Tunb, is under the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Ras-al-Khaimah. It has a dark Mil on its north-western point, with two small peaks 116 feet (35 m 4) 30 high. It is barren, waterless, and uninhabited. See views on chart 2837a, and facing page 118.

A sand spit, steep-to on its eastern side, but foul southward, extends from the south-eastern extremity of the island. Anchorage sheltered from the shamal, may be obtained in a depth j of 7 fathoms (12 m 8), sand, near the southern end of the eastern coast of Bu Musa. In 1931, H.M .S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) mud, with some mud huts on the beach near the south-eastern extremity of the island bearing 280°, distant about 3^ cables. 10 The southern coast of the island is divided into three bays by two rocky points with a sandy shore between them. The eastern and middle bays are foul, there being drying rocks in them; it is inadvisable to approach the locality within a distance of 1| miles. The western of the two points terminates in a conspicuous black 15 rock near which is a village with a flagstaff. A rocky steep-to shoal, over which there is a depth of 2f fathoms (S^), lies about half a mile westward of the western point. Good anchorage, sheltered from the kaus, may be obtained, in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0), northward of the rocky shoal. 20 The western point of the island is steep and on it is the termination of the range of hills on the western side of the island. Close off the point are four islets, the largest of which is connected to the coast at low water. [Lat. 25° 53' NLong. 55° 01' E.) The north-western coast is rocky and should not be approached 25 within one mile as the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies at some distance offshore. At the south-western end of this coast, is a sandy bay off which lie two islets with a shoal between them. Torlesse rock, over which there is a depth of 8 feet (2 m 4), lies about 1J miles westward of the northern extremity of the island; 30 there are depths of 6 and 7 fathoms (l^O and 12 m 8) close to the rock, on which latter the sea breaks heavily in rough weather. There is a large quantity of iron oxide on the island. No supplies are available; water is obtained from wells. Tidal streams. —The tidal streams set south-westward and 35 north-eastward at a rate of about one knot at springs. CLARENCE STRAIT. —This strait separates the island of Qishm from the coast of Persia. Near its centre the strait is con tracted to a width of about 1^ miles between Puhal point, on the mainland, and a position on the northern coast of the island about 40 t\ie same distance north-eastward of Laft point. South-westward of Laft point the channel is divided by a large island, that part of it north-westward of the island being known as Khor Masaga, and that part south-eastward of the island being Kh5r Guran. 45 From the junction of these two portions, at the south-western end of the island, to the south-western extremity of Qishm island the channel is known as Khor Jafuri. Clarence strait is navigable by vessels of moderate size from its eastern entrance as far as Laft point, and vessels of lighter draught 50 can proceed right through it; but the channel is not buoyed, the tidal streams are strong and, westward of Laft point, the kh5rs have not been thoroughly surveyed. The passage should not be attempted without local knowledge. Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] CLARENCE STRAIT 121 Chart 753. The least depth in the fairway eastward of Laft point appears to be about 5J fathoms (9 m 6) and that westward of it, 3J fathoms (G 11 ^), which latter depth is found in the western entrance of the strait. 5 Pilots can be obtained at Qishm town. Aspect. —On the mainland side of Clarence Strait is the great chain of mountains that ends eastward in Kuh Ginau, see page 104. A mountain, 5,120 feet (1560 m 6) high, with two great steps or notches on its western side, is situated about 18 miles west-south- 10 westward of Kuh Ginau. Kuh i Hormuz or Shu, situated about 36 miles west-north westward of this latter, is a peak, 9,200 feet (2804 m 2) high, that is visible over other mountains seaward of it; from southward its summit appears as three small peaks covered, in winter, with snow. 15 See chart 2837a. Kaneh Surkh range, between this lofty range and the sea, rises gradually from westward to an elevation of about 1,500 feet (475 m 2), and extends in a north-easterly direction from a position about 17 miles westward of Bandar 'Abbas. 20 Koh-i-Namak Sar range is a confused mass of irregular and precipitous peaks, the highest of which attains an elevation of 1,235 feet (376 m 4), situated southward of the south-western end of Kaneh Surkh range, Kuh-i-Punal-i-Khamir [Lat. 27° 03' N., Long. 55° 40' E.), 25 about 3,700 feet (823 m 2) high, is a pointed summit, about 6| miles north-westward of Puhal point, near the eastern end of a mountain range, that extends in a westerly direction for nearly 50 miles; West peak, in the same range and about 13 miles westward, is stated to be much higher, but is not conspicuous, and a spur of 30 the range extends south-eastward from it. Between this range and the great range northward of it is a wide valley. A third range commences northward of the south-western extremity of Qishm island and extends in a westerly direction for a great distance, see page 131. There is a wide valley between this and 55 the Khamir range through which flows the Rud-i-Mchran. On the Qishm island side of Clarence strait, the most remarkable hills are situated southward of Biscoe bay, see page 123. Jabal Biscoe, situated almost in the centre of Qishm island, is 994 feet (303 m 0), see page 111. 40 Finger peak, situated about 2 miles north-eastward of Jabal Biscoe, is 941 feet (286 I11 8) high and is conspicuous. From Finger peak a range trends northward to within 1| miles of the coast where it turns westward and, extending in that direction for about 6 miles, forms a coastal range of low irregular hills with no conspicuous 45 summit, except Sugar-loaf hill, 350 feet (106 m 6) high, near its western end. Paipusht, a village on the slopes of the eastern hill of the coastal range, shows up well when the sun is shining on it, Jabal Arab is a detached hill, 185 feet (56 m 4) high, situated 50 near the coast, about 1| miles northward of Sugar-loaf hill, and 2f miles south-eastward of Alia Mulk point. Sheikh Musa is a detached hill, 270 feet (82 m 3) high, situated about 1J miles southward of Alia Mulk point; its southern side Charts 2837a, 748h.122 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. is perpendicular and forms a useful mark for vessels approaching from eastward. Meherhuni hill, 585 feet (178 m 3) high, is situated about 2| miles 5 southward of Alia Mulk point and is also conspicuous from eastward. Eastern approach.—Coasts. —Clarence strait is approached from eastward in the same manner as Bandar 'Abbas, see pages 109 and 110. From Siru, see page 109, the northern shore of the strait trends westward for about 6 miles to Birkeh Band-i-'Ali, a conspicuous dome-shaped reservoir. Siru spit, a drying bank of hard sand, extends about 1| miles offshore between Siru and Birkeh Band-i-'Ali, and on its outer edge is Siru island, 8 feet (2 m 4) high at its eastern end. There are depths of from 5 to 8 fathoms (9 m l to 14 m 6) at a distance of about 2 cables southward of Siru spit, but at about 2 miles southward of it is the end of another spit, over which there is a depth of 4| fathoms (7 m 8), which latter extends eastward from an extensive shoal. The southern shore of the strait extends north-westward from 20 Qishm town, see page 108, for about 4 miles to a point from which the land rises to a table-topped hill about 100 feet (30 m 5) high; thence it trends in a general westerly direction for about 6 miles to a low point close southward of which is Jabal Horton. Between the two points, the coast is fronted by a drying mudbank that 25 extends offshore for about 2 miles, and oft the centre of which shoal water extends a further half a mile affording anchorage to boats when the nashi is blowing. Khor Tawala, in which native boats are hauled up, runs in behind a long low point, at the south-eastern end of the mud flat, that 30 projects in a westerly direction from the point on which is the 100- foot (30 m 5) hill. {Lat. 26° 59' NLong. 56° 13' E. Dukuhak islets, 80 and 100 feet (24 m 4 and 30 m 5) high, respectively, lie on the mudbank off the entrance of Kh5r Tawala, Milne head, a bold promontory 225 feet (68 m 6) high, juts out 35 onto the mud flat about If miles westward of the Dukuhak islets. Jabal Salsul, a peaked precipitous-sided hill, rises about three- quarters of a mile south-south-eastward of Milne head. Jabal Horton is a remarkable quoin-shaped hill, the bluff being on its southern side; it is 454 feet (138 m 4) high and on its summit 40 is a small tree. The northern shore of the strait trends in a general south-westerly direction from Birkeh Band-i-'Ali, for a distance of about 12 miles, to Bustaneh point. A bank of dead coral covered with sand and mud dries for a distance of about 7 cables offshore, and as far south- ^5 ward as Bustaneh village, situated about 7| miles south-westward of Birkeh Band-i- Ali, is fairly steep-to; but, in the bight between that village and Bustaneh point, a flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends about one mile outside the bank. Bustaneh point is low and not easily identified though, on its 50 eastern extremity, there is a hillock about 20 feet (6 m l) high. Puhal point is a low projection situated about 11^ miles west- south-westward of Bustaneh point; the intervening coast is low and the high water line is not easily defined as the sea overflows it at spring tides. It appears to be fronted by a drying flat of Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] CLARENCE STRAIT 123 Chart 753. considerable extent, southward of the middle of which a flat, with depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) over it, extends to within a short distance of Middle banks, see page 124. On Puhal point are some ruined water-tanks and at about 2| cables north-eastward of the point is a conspicuous tree. The mouth of the Rud-i-Kul, the water of which is extremely salt, is situated about 2 miles north-eastward of Puhal point; the river is navigable by native craft only. Puhal village, situated about 2 miles northward of the point, consists of a number of scattered groups of houses extending in an easterly and westerly direction across the plain. The southern shore of Clarence strait trends west-south-westward for about 6^ miles from the low point northward of Jabal Horton to Kuwai point; between these points are several bights filled by drying mud flats. Dargawan {Lat. 26° 58' N., Long. 56° 05' E.), situated about 1^ miles south-westward of Jabal Horton, is a little fishing village near which are a few date trees. Kuwai village, situated about one mile eastward of Kuwai point, has a date grove; near the beach is a birkeh and a ruined mosque. Kuwai point is steep-to and well defined and on it is a hillock, 50 feet (15 m 2) high; immediately inland of the point is Kuwai plateau, 270 feet (82 rn 3) high. Zainubi great table-land is from 300 to 500 feet (91 m 4 to 152 m 4) high and extends parallel with the coast for about 3 miles west ward of a position about If miles south-eastward of Kuwai village; it is highest at its eastern end and there is a gap near its western end. Zainubi point, situated about 1| miles south-westward of Kuwai point, is at the north-eastern end of a plateau 180 feet (54 in 9) high. On the point is the small village of Murghara. Zainubi village lies in a thick date grove about one mile inland. Biscoe bay is a large indentation in the coast between Zainubi point and Alia Mulk point, situated about 10 miles westward. At about 5 miles southward of the shore of the bay is the Biscoe range, see page 121, the summits of which form useful landmarks. A drying bank fringes the shore of the bay and extends offshore from one- quarter to one-half of a mile. Alia Mulk point is at the eastern end of a rocky plateau that rises to an elevation of 110 feet (33 m 5); the village of the same name, near which are a few trees, lies close southward of the plateau; in the village is a small fort. Laft Kedim is a small rocky point, situated about 14 cables westward of Alia Mulk point, whence the coast trends westward and south-westward for about 1^ miles to a rocky plateau 62 feet (18 m 9) high, and thence south-westward for about 6 cables to Laft point. There is a birkeh near the beach eastward of Laft Kedim point and a small mosque stands about 2 cables southward of the birkeh; both are fairly conspicuous. Between Laft Kedim point and the 62-foot (18 m 9) plateau are the villages of Kahura and Geshira. Laft point has a small hill close inside it which is a useful mark when approaching the anchorage off the point. Depths of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) or less will be found 3 cables northward and 1| cables west- 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Charts 2837a, 748b.124 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. iv. Chart 753. ward of the point, southward of which latter position these depths will be found 4| cables offshore. Between one and 5 cables west- north-westward of the point the depths are uneven, varying from 5 to 5 fathoms (G'M to 9 m l), sand and rock. Low point, see page 126, is situated about 1| miles west-south- westward of Laft point; from it a spit extends in a north-easterly direction for about the same distance; the inner part of the spit dries and over its extremity there appears to be a depth of 3^ fathoms 10 (6 m 4). Shoals. —Bustaneh East and West banks form practically one continuous narrow bank, about miles long as defined by the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line, lying parallel with and about 2^ miles off the northern shore of Clarence strait; its north-eastern end is situated 15 about 4| miles southward of Birkeh Band-i- 'Ali; and its south-western end about 2 miles south-eastward of Bustaneh point. A patch on the East bank is sometimes awash, and one on the West bank dries 4 feet (l m 2). The banks are moderately steep-to on their southern sides. The channel northward of the banks, between them and the shoal 20 extending from the coast of the mainland, is about If miles wide at its eastern end and three-quarters of a mile wide at its western end, the depths in it varying from 4J to 8 fathoms (7 m 8 to 14 m 6). A small detached bank of sand and rock, over which there is a least depth of 1|- fathoms (2 m 7), lies on the southern side of the 25 strait from 6 to 8 cables offshore northward of Dargawan. A small detached shoal, over which there is a least depth of 4^ fathoms (8 m 2), hard sand, lies about 2 miles north-eastward of Kuwai point, and is the principal fishing ground in the strait. Middle banks consist of two shoals, about 1^ miles apart, between 30 which are depths of from 3 to 5 fathoms (5 m 5 to 9 m l). They extend from a position about 1J miles northward of Zainubi point to a position about 2 miles eastward of Alia Mulk point. The eastern bank is of rock and sand, and the least depth over it, near its centre, is one foot (O^); the western bank dries over a considerable area 55 and is steep-to on its south-western side. The channel southward of the Middle banks is from half a mile to one mile wide with depths in it of from 6 to 10 fathoms (ll m 0 to 18 m 3). There is a channel northward of the banks, but it is intricate and should not be attempted, at its western end there is a 2f fathom (5^0) patch in 40 mid-channel. The east-going tidal stream is reported to set strongly towards these banks. A rocky bank, with depths over it of from one foot to 3 fathoms (0 m 3 to 5 m 5), lies on the southern side of the fairway nearly parallel with the shore of Biscoe bay, and extends from a position about 3 45 miles west-south-westward of Zainubi point to within about half a . m ~ e so uth-eastward of Alia Mulk point; between this bank and the shore bank, there is a very narrow channel, but it is only suitable for native craft. Alia Mulk reef, which dries from 3 to 4 feet (0 m 9 to l m 2), lies 50 near the western end of the foregoing rocky bank; and at about ca les northward of the western end of the reef is a detached shoal over which there is a depth of 2J fathoms (4 m 6). Alia shoal (Lat. 26° 67' N., Long. 55° 47' E.) consists of rocky patches lying between 8 and 14 cables north-westward of Alia Mulk Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] CLARENCE STRAIT 125 Chart 753. point and from 5 to 8 cables offshorethe least depth over the southern part of the shoal is 84 fathoms (5 m 9), and over the northern part. 3| fathoms (6 m 9). Puhal patch, over which there is a depth of 3f fathoms {6 m 9), 5 rock, lies about 6|- cables east-south-eastward of Puhal point. Ked shoal, over which there is a least depth of 2| fathoms (4 m 6), rock and sand, lies from 2 to 4 cables northward of the 62-foot (18 m 9) plateau north-eastward of Laft point. Anchorages.—Directions. —Well-sheltered anchorage, with good JO holding ground in depths of from 4| to 7 fathoms (8 m 2 to 12 m 8), may be obtained between Bustaneh village and Bustaneh East bank; but in the eastern approach to it the depths varv from 3^ to 4i fathoms (6 m 4 to 8 m 2). Completely sheltered anchorage may be obtained off Puhal point i5 in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l) close offshore; but the tidal streams there are said to attain a rate of 21 knots, and the holding ground is bad. (Lat. 26° 58' N., Long. 55° 45' E.). Well protected anchorage may be obtained north-westward of Laft point in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0) at a distance of 3^ cables 20 from the point, or in 4 fathoms (7^3) at a distance of 2 cables from it. At this anchorage, the tidal streams attain a rate of 2 knots at springs, the flood-stream running westward, and the ebb stream north-eastward. Having rounded the eastern end of Qishm island at a distance 25 of not less than 2 miles, see page 110, when past the point on which is the 100-foot (30 m 5) table-topped hill 4 miles north-westward of Qishm town, care must be taken to avoid the shoal fringing the drying bank northward of Milne head. Kuwai point should be passed at a distance of about 3| cables, and thence Jabal Arab 30 bearing 255° leads through the fairway southward of Middle banks; but care must be taken to avoid being set onto those banks by the east-going tidal stream. When Sugar-loaf hill opens out from behind a 320-foot (95 m 7) bluff between it and the coast, bearing about 210°, course may be altered onto the conspicuous tree north- 35 eastward of Puhal point v bearing 297°; but caution must be exer cised, for this course passes very close north-eastward of the detached 2|-fathom (4 m 6) shoal northward of the western end of Alia Mulk reef and if continued too far will lead onto Puhal patch. Having passed northward of Alia shoal and southward of Puhal patch, 40 the anchorage off Laft point may be approached between Ked shoal and the spit extending from Low point. Strong eddies and overfalls may be expected off these shoals at spring tides. Khor Masaga.— This branch of the channel through Clarence strait, see page 120, though wider than Khor Guran, is seldom used 45 by the pilots, for the banks on either side are in most places steep-to and being covered do not show in the muddy water. It was reported in 1912 that this channel had silted up and could then only be used by small bagalas. The northern shore of this part of the strait trends in a general 50 west-south-westerly direction for about 10 miles to near the head of Khamir backwater. At about 3| miles westward of Puhal point is the eastern end of a low island that lies about half a mile offshore; it is steep-to on its southern side, but there is no passage northward of it - 55 Charts 2837a, 748b.126 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 753. Khamir backwater is stated to have its entrance, a narrow channel in which the depths are not less than 4 fathoms (7 m 3), about 9 miles south-westward of Puhal point. Depths of 6 fathoms (llmO) being 5 obtained in the backwater, it would appear to be deeper than charted. Khamir town {Lat. 26° 57' N., Long. 55° 35' E.), situated on the mainland about 8J miles westward of Puhal point, is built round a fort with a high square tower; the town is situated about 10 half a mile inland and there is a date grove eastward of it. Two pyramidal hills rise to an elevation of 150 feet (45 m 7) about 2 or 3 miles west-south-westward of the town. Anchorage has been obtained, in a depth of 3| fathoms (G 11 ^), at about half a mile offshore south-eastward of Khamir town. 15 From the entrance of Khamir backwater, the north-western shore of Khor Masaga trends south-south-westward and is formed by low swampy land covered with mangroves, probably the delta of the Riid-i-Mchran. The south-eastern side of Khor Masaga is formed by the north -western side of the large low island, covered with scrub, that, dividing Clarence strait into two channels, extends south-westward from Low point, see page 124, for about 13 miles. Khor Guran.—Anchorages. —The navigable channel in this _ part of Clarence strait is only about one cable wide between the 25 5-fathom (9 m l) lines at its entrance, about 4 cables north-westward of Laft point; but depths greater than 3^ fathoms (G 1 ^) exist over a width of 3 cables; southward of Low point it is not less than 3 cables wide, except at the sharp turn from north-west to south-west in its southern part, where it is 2 cables wide; it is usually pre- 30 ferred by the pilots, as the depths in the fairway are not less than o fathoms (9 m l) throughout, and, except at the western entrance, the banks are well defined by mangroves. Its course is tortuous, being southward for about 9 miles from Laft point; thence north westward for about 2^ miles; it then turns sharply south-westward 55 for about 5 miles and south-south-westward for about 2 miles to the small village of Guran, whence it trends west-south-westward for about 2 miles to its junction with Khor Masaga at the eastern end of Khor Jafuri. The last reach is the most difficult part of the passage as it is very narrow, and several large bagalas are some- 40 times moored off the village; the banks cover at high water, and are not marked by mangroves. The southern entrance is most easily navigated when the tide has fallen sufficiently to show the edges of the flats. Fishing stakes, hardly visible at high water, block the greater part of the channel south-westward of Guran. 45 In 1924, H.M.S. Triad reported that, from abreast of Hinderabi islet, lying about one mile southward of Laft point, to abreast of Kuvadin, situated about 5^ miles south-south-eastward of that point, the banks on the western side of the channel had extended eastward in places for about half a mile and that the channel had 50 correspondingly shifted eastward. Great caution is necessary when opposite the narrow channel leading north-westward at about 2J miles northward of Guran, as there the main channel has silted up, to about 9 feet (2 m 7), from the southern shore for about three- quarters of its width, leaving only a narrow channel with a least Charts 2837a, 7m.Chap. IV.] CLARENCE STRAIT 127 Chart 753. depth in it of 4 fathoms (7 m 3). Westward of Guran, the channel is very narrow and not straight as shown on chart 753; but the passage presented no difficulty at low water as the banks were uncovered and a single line of fishing stakes on the southern side 5 showed the extent of that bank, which was steep-to. Laft, situated about 3 miles south-eastward of Laft point, is a small town at the foot of a hill, 200 feet (G^O) high, rising from the beach to cliffs; at the southern end of the town is a ruined fort with three towers. Fresh water is stored in reservoirs. A few cattle 10 and some poultry are occasionally obtainable. The fishing in the vicinity is good. Laft creek, in which native craft lie, is entered at the southern end of Hinderabi islet and runs south-eastward close to the coast of Qishm island as far as the town. Hinderabi islet is low and i&lt;5 at its northern end is a small white tomb. The creek is narrow and its south-western side consists of mud banks covered with mangrove bushes. There is a conspicuous hill, from 500 to 600 feet (152 m 4 to 182 m 9) high, about one mile east-north-eastward of Laft town, on the summit 20 of which are stated to be the ruins of some reservoirs. Anchorage was obtained by H.M.S. Triad, in a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6), sand, about 3 cables south-westward of Hinderabi islet. Anchorage was also obtained by the same vessel, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8), mud, close westward of Guran village. 25 Chart 35. Khor Jafuri.—Directions. —This, the westernmost portion of Clarence strait, extends, from the junction of Khor Masaga and Khor Guran, in a south-westerly direction for about 16 miles, to Basidu point {Lat. 26° 39' N., Long. 55° 16' E.). 30 The mainland on the northern side of the kh5r is low for the first 7 or 8 miles being formed by the delta of the Rud-i-Mchran; thence it trends north-westward for about the same distance to the foot of the eastern end of the mountain range northward of Basidu point, see page 131, whence it trends in a general south-westerly J5 direction. At about 4f miles north-westward of Basidu point, is a low rounded point on which are the ruins of many reservoirs. On the southern side of the khor, between Guran and Basidu point, are several villages; they are situated at a short distance inland and in each case possess date groves. Chahu, Tersai, and ^ Kunar Siyah, are small fishing villages situated, respectively, about 12, 9£, and 8| miles eastward of Basidu point; they are not visible from the strait, but near Chahu can be seen a white tomb. Diraku, situated about 1^ miles south-westward of Kunar Siyah, stands on rising ground; Guri, situated about 2 miles south-westward 45 of Diraku, is a large village, with extensive date groves and much cultivation, from which a pass leads through the hills to the southern coast of Qishm island; these two villages can be seen from the strait. Kalat Hajji Karitu, situated on the coast about 3 miles westward of Guri, is a ruined fort standing on a small rocky mound 50 with Nakhlistan, or Old Basidu, about half a mile south-westward of it. Between Guri and Kalat Hajji Karitu, the coast is low and barren, but here and there are large date plantations with a few houses and some wells of good water. Charts 753, 2837a, 748b.128 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 35. A mud flat, which dries in most places, fringes the coast of Qishm island from Guran to Basidu point and extends offshore from 2 cables to one mile in places. 5 A middle ground, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies offshore between Diraku and Basidu; in March 1919, H.M.S. Bramble reported that changes appeared to have taken place and that the middle ground did not extend so far eastward and westward as charted, but lay farther southward. The navigable 10 channel is northward of the middle ground and is about one mile wide. The northern side of the navigable channel is bounded for the whole of its length by an extensive sand-bank; H.M.S, Bramble reported that, northward of the middle ground, this bank appeared to have extended at least half a mile farther southward than charted. In order to keep in the fairway, from a point about 3 miles westward of Guran, vessels should keep from about If miles to three- quarters of a mile off the southern shore of the strait until north ward of Kunar Siyah, where they should cross over and proceed 20 along the southern edge of the extensive sandbank on the northern side of the khor, in a depth of about 5-fathoms (9 m l), until past the middle ground, whence a south-westerly course may be steered for the anchorage off Basidu. Chart 35, with plan of Basidu anchorage. 25 Basidu.—Shoals.—Beacon. —Basidu point, the north-western extremity of Qishm island and on which the village of Basidu is situated, is a cliff, 20 feet (6 m l) high, on the level summit of which are a few small buildings and some date trees. The point is fringed to a distance of about 2 cables offshore by a shoal, over which the 30 depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5). A rocky patch, which nearly dries and close outside which are depths of 2| fathoms (4 m 6), extends north-westward for three-quarters of a cable from a position close north-westward of the pier at Basidu. At about \\ cables north westward of the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line off Basidu point, the Gut, 35 about one cable wide with depths in it of from 12 to 16 fathoms (21 m 9 to 29 m 3), trends north-eastward. Beacon shoal, the north-eastern end of which is rocky, the re mainder being of sand, extends in a south-south-westerly direction, from a position about 6 cables westward of Basidu point, for a dis- 40 tance of about 3^ miles. For about half a cable from its north eastern end, the shoal dries, as does also a large patch about 2 miles farther southward. From the southern end of the shoal, a shallow sandspit extends south-south-eastward for about 3^ miles between the northern extremity of the Flat, see page 117, and the mud and 45 sand flat extending from the western end of Qishm island, see page 117. There is a narrow channel between Beacon shoal and its spit on the one hand and the mud and sand flat on the other; but it is not navigable. A beacon (Lat. 26° 39' N., Long. 55° 15' E.), consisting of a 50 white mast, about 40 feet (12 m 2) high, with five red battens giving the appearance of a red circular disc as topmark, has been erected on the north-eastern extremity of Beacon shoal.

Approaching from eastward, vessels intending to use the channel northward of the Flat should steer for the eastern Hummock 5 (Lat. 26° 35' NLong. 55° 20' E.), see page 117, bearing 274°, to a position about one mile southward of the point near the southern end of Namakdan hills; thence the 10-foot (3 m 0) islet north westward of Ras Dastakdn should be steered for, bearing 264°, until the former point bears 073°, whence course 253° should be 10 made good with the point astern until the islet is abeam; thence the following courses and distances should be made good, fixing the position of the vessel, when eastward of Ras Dastakdn by the 550-foot (167 m 6) hill northward of Kawuni and the eastern Hum mock, and when past Ras Dastakan, by that point; the eastern i5 Hummock and Basidu flagstaff or beacon: 245°, 3 , 7 miles; 270°, 9 cables; 299°, 4*1 miles; 348°, 3 9 miles; and about 044° until Basidu beacon is abeam; the beacon should be rounded at a distance of about one-quarter of a mile and anchorage obtained as previously directed. In 1931, the least depth obtained when following this route 20 was 4 fathoms (7 m 3). The 550-foot (167 m 6) hill is a very good mark, being the western extremity and highest part of a range and falling abruptly to a valley on its western side. Caution is, however, necessary as the coast line is incorrectly charted. Approaching from eastward, vessels intending to pass outside the 25 Flat should avoid Coote rock, see page 118, and pass about 2 miles northward of Jezirat Tunb, proceeding afterwards as directed for the approach from southward. Approaching from southward, vessels having passed on either side of Jezirat Nabiyu Tunb should bring that island to bear about 169°, 30 astern, and Grubb's notch, see page 131, if visible, ahead, bearing about 349°; this course will lead about 5 miles westward of the shoalest part of Mariner shoal, and of the western edge of the Flat. When the eastern Hummock bears 072°, Kuh-i-Punal-i-Khamir, see page 121, should bear 044° and, if visible, should be kept so until 35 Basidu beacon is abeam. It has been reported, however, that in normal summer visibility it is doubtful if the foregoing marks could be seen in time to be of use. Having rounded the beacon at a distance of about one-quarter of a mile, anchorage may be obtained as previously directed. The least depth on this track is about 40 3| fathoms (6 m 4). The edges of Mariner shoal and the Flat are indicated by discoloured water; and near the edge of the latter a number of fishing boats may often be seen at anchor. Approaching from westward, vessels should pass about 3 miles southward of Ras Kharyu, page 133, and steer east-north-eastward 45 until Kuh-i-Punal-i-Khamir bears 044°; thence the peak should be kept on that bearing until Basidu beacon can be rounded at a distance of about one-quarter of a mile and anchorage obtained as previously directed. At night, Jezi'rat Tunb light bearing 300°, astern, will take a 50 vessel westward of Mariner shoal; when past the latter, due allowance having been made for the tidal streams, course should be altered north-north-westward and the vessel should anchor off the Flat, in a depth of about 6 fathoms (ll m 0), to await daylight before proceeding farther. Charts 753, 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] COAST OF JEHAN GIRIEH 131 Charts 35, 753, and 2830. COAST OF JEHAN GIRIEH.—Aspect.—The coast of Jehan Girieh or Lingeh, one of the Persian districts under the Governor of the Gulf Ports, extends from Khamir in a general south-westerly direction for about 58 miles to Ras Bustaneh whence it trends 5 north-westward for a further 22 miles to Charak, see chart 2837a. In the vicinity of Purgah and about 10 miles northward of Basidu point is a rounded mountain, 2,940 feet (896 m I) high, at the eastern end of the range on the southern side of the Rud-i-Mchran valley, see page 121. From this mountain the range trends westward. 10 Grubb's notch, a saddle-shaped summit, 2,950 feet (899 m 2) high, is situated in the range about 14 miles westward of the mountain near Purgah. See views on charts 35 and 2837a. Lingeh peak is a conspicuous summit, 3,900 feet (1188 m 7) high, situated about 12 miles west-north-westward of Grubb's notch; 15 between the peak and Jabal Bustaneh, see page 134, is an extensive low plain that, after rain, is swampy. The coast in the neighbourhood of the low rounded point, about 4f miles north-westward of Basidu point, see page 127, is low, but at about 5 miles westward it rises in a mountain to an elevation 20 of 1,330 feet (405 m 4); the outline of this mountain is very irregular; its eastern part is of a light colour whereas the western part is dark and apparently of volcanic formation; westward pf the mountain is a plain. On the south-western side of the plain, about 4 miles in that direction from the mountain, the land again becomes hilly. 25 The north-eastern part of these hills is a long, light-coloured ridge, 960 feet (292 m '6) high, with a very jagged outline, that is rather conspicuous on west-north-westerly bearings; the remaining hills are dark and of volcanic origin; near the coast and at about IJ miles south-westward of the southern end of the ridge is a flat- 30 topped hill, 620 feet (189 m 0) high, that is conspicuous from east ward; A1 Buza, three-quarters of a mile eastward of the last- mentioned hill, is similar to it but smaller. Kaleh Lashtan {Lat. 26° 38' NLong. 54° 52' E.), situated about 8 miles westward of A1 Buza and about 4 miles inland, is about 35 600 feet (182 m 9) high, with a sloping summit and precipitous sides; on the summit is a ruined fort, but it is not visible from seaward! The hill, which is detached from others between it and the coast and is visible over them, is conspicuous on westerly and north westerly bearings, when it appears quoin-shaped. Another hill, 40 400 feet (121 m 9) high, rises to a quoin-shaped summit about 4 miles south-westward of Kaleh Lashtan and is conspicuous from eastward. Coast.—Anchorages.—Ras ash Shawari, situated about 2| miles east-north-eastward of A1 Buza, is low, sandy and compara tively steep-to. Bandar Hamairan is a bay north-eastward of Ras ash Shawari in which, at about 3 miles in that direction from the point, is a shoal lying about IJ miles offshore with depths of 4 fathoms '(7 m 3) between it and the coast. Native vessels anchor inside the shoal. Bandar Mu'allim village is situated in a date grove about one 50 mile northward of Ras ash Shawari. Rung, situated about 7 miles south-westward of Ras ash Shawari, is a fishing town extending for about half a mile along the sandy shore and containing many well-built houses and several gilded Charts 2837a, 7m.132 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Charts 35 , 753, and 2830. mosques. At the south-western end of the town are the ruins of a factory, on the beach near which, standing below high water mark, is a round fort. There is a large date grove and much cultivation 5 behind the town; a few supplies might be obtainable. Anchorage, sheltered except from the suhaili, may be obtained, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), mud, abreast Kung at a distance of about \\ miles offshore; but at about one mile offshore the depths shoal rapidly from 4| to 2\ fathoms (8 m 2 to 4 D1 6). 10 Landing is bad at low water, as the sandy beach dries off in ridges for a distance of about 2| cables, with depths of one or 2 feet (0 m 3 or 0 m 6) between the ridges. On the coast, at about 2 miles south-westward of Kung, is a date plantation. 15 Depths.—Caution. —From the low rounded point about 4| miles north-westward of Basidu point, the coast, as far as about 2£ miles south-westward of Kung, appears to be fronted by a shoal that extends from three quarters of a mile to if miles offshore, but the locality has been only partially surveyed. Close outside'this shoal is a gut from half a mile to one mile in width, in which the depths vary from about 6 to 13 fathoms (ll m 0 to 23 m 8). Eastward of the gut the depths are less than 5 fathoms (9 m l) , and between it and North bank they are from 3£ to 4| fathoms (C 13 ^ to 8 m 2). The coastal shoal being very steep-to, great caution must be 25 exercised when approaching this coast to avoid getting into shoal water on the inshore side of the gut. Just outside the anchorage at Kung there are depths of 8 fathoms (14 m 6) in the gut. From a position about 3J miles southward of Kung, the 5-fathom 30 (9 m l) line, forming the south-eastern side of the gut, trends in a general north-easterly direction, and from the same position the 5-fathom (9 m l) line, in the south-western approach to Basidu, trends eastward and south-eastward towards the Flat. Depths of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) will be found about 8 miles south- 35 ward of Kung. Chart 3380, plan of Lingeh. Lingeh.— This town, the seat of a Deputy Governor of the Gulf Ports, is situated about 3| miles south-westward of Kung. In it are many well-built houses occupying a narrow strip of the foreshore 40 about one mile in length, and at a short distance inland of it are some date groves. In the foienoon, the town usually shows up well from seaward. The Deputy Governor's house on the sea-front is conspicuous and the flag is flown from a tall white flagstaff nearby. At the south-western end of the town is a conspicuous tall minaret; i5 its upper part, built of grey and green bricks with the roof painted dark green, shows up well against the light-coloured land behind it. In addition, there are two W/T masts, 112 and 110 feet (34 m l and 33 m 5) in height, respectively, situated about half a mile inland near the northern end of the town; but it has been reported that 50 they are not easily identified. Outside the town are many birkehs or circular domed reservoirs that are filled by the winter rains. The Customs-house {Lat. 26° 33' NLong. 54° 54' E.) is on the sea-front, south-westward of the Deputy Governor's residence, and on either side of it are boat cambers which dry out. Charts 35, 753, 2830, 2837a, 748b.Chap. IV.] COAST OF JEHAN GIRIEH 133 Chart 3380, plan of Lingeh. The population is fluctuating owing to the number of men who go annually to the pearl fisheries. Both Persian and Arabic are generally known at Lingeh, and English can be used for commercial correspondence. 5 Petroleum, hardware, cotton, cloth, rice, sugar, timber, tea, etc., are imported. Carpets, canvas, gum, opium, pearls and pearl shells are exported. Anchorage.—Tidal Streams. —Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), clay and good holding ground, at 10 about three-quarters of a mile offshore abreast the town. Small craft anchor about 3 cables farther in, in depths of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3). The anchorage is sheltered except from the suhaili, which sends in a heavy sea; but this wind is always of short duration. Close outside the anchorage there are depths of 7 and 8 fathoms 15 (12 m 8 and 14 m 6) in the gut, and at about miles offshore the depths decrease again to 5 fathoms (9 m l). The best landing place is in the camber north-eastward of the Customs-house. The facilities for working cargo are good. Off Lingeh, the tidal streams set south-westward and north- 20 eastward at a rate of from one-quarter to three-quarters of a knot. Supplies .—Communications .—Beef of poor quality, mutton, and vegetables can be obtained. Fowls, eggs, and fish are plentiful. Duck, bustard, and grouse can be shot during the winter months, but it is necessary to travel some miles inland to get them. Water 25 can be procured, but it is sometimes scarce. There is a British-Indian post office at Lingeh. For steamship communications, see page 28. For aircraft communications, see page 29. Charts 35, 753, and 2830. 30 Coast.—Dangers .—Jisheh, situated about 2 miles south-westward of Lingeh, is a small village in which there are two towers and near which are some date trees. The inhabitants are fisherfolk and agriculturists. Depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found about three- 35 quarters of a mile offshore abreast Jisheh. Ras Kharyu, situated about one mile south-westward of Jisheh, is low and sandy, but has a rocky beach. A spit, over which there is a depth of 1|- fathoms (2 m 7) extends south-eastward from the point for a distance of about 4^ cables, and a rocky patch, over 40 which there is a depth of 2| fathoms (4 m 6), lies about 8 cables southward of the point. The spit and the rocky patch are both steep-to. Shias bay, on the western side of Ras Kharyu, is fronted by a flat which extends offshore for a distance of about half a mile and 45 over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5). Shias village, on the western side of the bay and about three- quarters of a mile inland, is situated about 2J miles westward of Ras Kharyu. It is obscured from seaward by a thick grove of date trees. The inhabitants of the village are fisherfolk and 50 agriculturists. Ras ash Shias {Lat. 26° 30' NLong. 54° 48' E.), situated about 3J miles south-westward of Ras Kharyu, is very low and sandy; Charts 2837a, 748h.134 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Charts 35, 753, and 2830. the depths are shoal within one-quarter of a mile of the point, but outside that distance they increase rapidly to 13 fathoms (23 m 8) ; depths of 10 and 20 fathoms (18 m 3 and 36 m 6) will be found,' 5 respectively, at about one and 5 miles southward of the point. Ras Bustaneh is situated about 9 miles westward of Ras ash Shias and the shore of the intervening bay is fronted by a flat, which extends offshore for a distance of three-quarters of a mile in places and over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5). The shore of this .70 bay is low and sandy, but it has a rocky beach. At about one mile westward of Ras ash Shias are some white sandhills rising close to the beach to an elevation of about 30 feet (9 m l); westward of these the land rises in a gentle slope from the coast to the foot hills of Jabal Bustaneh, which are from 200 to 300 feet (Gl 11 ^ to 15 91 m 4) high. At about 2^ miles westward of Ras ash Shias, is a grove of date trees, close to the shore, in which are four wells. A white birkeh, situated about one mile farther westward and about one-quarter of a mile inland, is conspicuous. Jabal Bustaneh is a remarkable detached group of dark volcanic 20 hills of very irregular outline; the highest part, near the middle of the group, is a ridge near the southern end of which, and at about 4f miles north-eastward of Ras Bustaneh, is a small peak resembling a tower that attains an elevation of 1,750 feet (533 m 4) and is con spicuous, especially from eastward or westward. The south-western 25 part of the group, situated about 3 miles north-westward of Ras Bustaneh, has been mistaken for that point when the low land forming the latter has been invisible. See view on chart 2837a. Between Jabal Bustaneh and the hills behind Lingeh, the land rises in a gentle slope from the coast to an elevation of about 300 feet (91 m 4), 30 thence falling in cliffs to the southern edge of the low plain between that mountain and Lingeh peak, see page 131. Bustaneh, a fishing village, situated about 2 miles north-eastward of Ras Bustaneh, is small; in it is a round tower and on rising ground behind it is a birkeh. There is a date grove at the village 35 and another between it and the point. Ras Bustaneh is low, and brown in colour; at about 3 cables westward of it are three small date trees. A shoal, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends about half a mile offshore on the south-western side of the point. 40 Off-lying shoal.—A detached patch, over which there is a depth of 3| fathoms (6 m 9), with from 6 to 22 fathoms (ll m 0 to 40 m 2) close round it, lies about If miles south-westward of Ras Bustaneh. For shoal and islands farther southward, see page 138. Anchorages. —Shias bay affords good anchorage in depths of 45 from 5 to 7 fathoms (9 m l to 12 m 8); it is sheltered from the shamal, and the nashi does not raise a heavy sea as Qishm island and the Flat afford a certain amount of protection. Anchorage may be obtained off the coast between Ras ash Shias and Ras Bustaneh; it is open to the shamal but is well sheltered 50 from the nashi. Good landing can be effected, on the sandy beach near the grove of date trees, about 2\ miles westward of Ras ash Shias. [Lat. 26° 31' NLong. 54° 45' E.) Anchorage for boats may be obtained, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), close inshore nearly one mile south-westward of Bustaneh Charts 2837a, 748h.rising Chap. IV.] COAST OF JEHAN GIRIEH 135 Charts 35, 753, and 2830. village. The anchorage is partly sheltered from the shamal which in this locality blows from westward; larger vessels cannot get close enough in to obtain much shelter. Tidal streams. —The tidal streams off Ras Kharyu and Ras 5 ash Shias attain a rate of about 1^ knots and cause a discolouration of the water. See also page 129. Chart 2830. Mughu bay.—Shoal.—Anchorage .—The shore of this bay trends north-north-westward from Ras Bustaneh for about 7 miles 10 and thence westward for about the same distance to Ras Yurd; it is low and sandy, and near the former point the beach is rocky; at either end of the bay the land rises in a gentle slope to the bases respectively, of Jabal Bustaneh and Kuh-i-Namki, see below, between which, at about 2^ miles inland, is precipitous broken 15 ground. A flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), fringes the bay and extends offshore from half a mile to IJ miles in places; the depths in the bay, generally, are less than 10 fathoms (18^3). A detached shoal, over which the least known depth is 2| fathoms 20 (4 m l), lies, about If miles offshore, nearly 4 miles south-eastward of Ras Yurd. {Lat. 26° 36' NLong. 54° 24' E.) Duwwan is a small village, situated about 5|- miles north westward of Ras Bustaneh, in which there is a fort with two white towers; behind the village, and on either side of it, are date groves; 25 good water is obtainable, but scarcely anything else; some of the inhabitants go to the pearl fishery. Mughu, situated about 4 miles westward of Duwwan, is a somewhat larger village in which are several round towers; a large fort with three conspicuous square towers stands immediately behind the 30 village with a date grove inland and westward of it; low sandhills extend for a distance of about 2 miles eastward of the village. Water can be obtained, and also cattle and a few vegetables. A number of the inhabitants go to the pearl fishery. Ras Yurd is an ill-defined low point, from about half a mile 35 inland of which the land begins to rise to Kuh-i-Namki. Kuh-i-Namki, about 4^ miles north-north-eastward of Ras Yurd, is a rugged group of dark-coloured volcanic hills, about 1,200 feet (365 m 8) high, that has a jagged outline but no marked summit; from westward, its northern bluff is conspicuous. 4.0 A flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends south-westward from Ras Yurd for a distance of nearly 2 miles- there are depths of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) close to its outer edge; by dayi it is marked by the discolouration of the water. Mughu bay affords good shelter from the kaus on its eastern side, 45 but it is a dangerous anchorage during a shamal. For shelteri even from easterly winds, sailing vessels should anchor near Mughu,' or farther out with Ras Bustaneh bearing about 103°, in order to be able to put to sea should a shamal arise. The bay is open to the suhaili which probably raises a heavy sea, but the holding ground 50 is good. Anchorage may be obtained close off the village of Mughu, and a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), clay, will be found nearly one mile Charts 2837a, 748b.136 ENTRANCE OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. IV. Chart 2830. offshore; unless close inshore, very little shelter is obtained from the shamdl, which in this bay blows from westward. In a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), the flat off Ras Yurd breaks the sea, but 5 some swell rolls in, causing a vessel at anchor to ride uneasily. The depths decrease regularly towards the anchorage. Chart 2837a, plan of Chdrak. Charak bay.—Anchorages. —From Ras Yurd, the shore of Charak bay trends north-westward for about 10 miles to Charak town and thence west-south-westward for about 4 miles to Ras Taviineh; the depths in the bay are less than 10 fathoms (18 m 3) and decrease regularly shoreward. Haslneh {Lat. 26° 39' N., Long. 54° 22' E.) , situated about 4 miles north-westward of Ras Yurd, is a fishing village, at either 15 end of which is a conspicuous round tower; a large fort stands on the shore in front of the village and behind it the land rises gradually to the base of Kuh-i-Namki. Anchorage may be obtained off Hasineh, but it is open to the shamal. 20 The shore between Hasineh and Charak is low and sandy, and may be approached to a distance of about one mile. Charak town, in which are several towers, has a date grove behind it, and on a hillock, about 90 feet (27 m 4) high, and nearly half a mile inland, is a small fort in ruins. The town has a cleanly 25 appearance, and the Shaikh's conspicuous house is situated in the middle of it. The inhabitants are usually friendly and civil, but when visited by H.M.S. Hyacinth, in 1912, were hostile. Charak sends a number of boats to the pearl fisheries A good pass is said to lead into the interior. There is a Persian Customs-house at 30 Charak. Cattle, sheep, goats, fish, fruit, and water are ob tainable . A small creek, which forms the mouth of a water-course and in which boats are hauled up, is entered about one mile eastward of the Shaikh's house at Charak; a small village stands on its western 35 bank. Jabal Hamar, see view on chart 2837a, rises to an elevation of 370 feet (112 m 8) about 1^ miles westward of the Shaikh's house and from south-westward appears quoin-shaped; there is a conspicuous birkeh on its southern side. 40 Two rocky points are situated about 2 and 3 miles, respectively, westward of Charak, and between them, and westward as far as Ras Tavuneh, foul ground extends to a distance of about 4 cables offshore. Tavuneh is a small village on Ras Tavuneh at which good water 45 is obtainable; near it are a few date trees, four towers, and a castle standing on a rocky hillock. The point is about 28 feet (8 m 5) high, and from it a rocky spit extends for a distance of about 3| cables. Good anchorage, sheltered from the prevailing winds but open 50 to the suhaili, may be obtained off Charak, in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), mud, with Ras Tavuneh bearing 267°, and the ruined fort about 005°. The shamal, which blows from westward, sends in some swell and vessels should, therefore, anchor closer in if their draught permits.

Landing at low water is bad, for the sandy beach in front of the town dries off in ridges for about 2 cables. Anchorage may be obtained by small vessels about half a mile offshore at Tavuneh, with Ras Tavuneh bearing about 295°, distant about three-quarters of a mile; in this position the vessel will be sheltered from the shamal by the spit extending from the point.

Farur shoa.!, Jezirat Farur, Jezirat Nabiyu Fariir, and Jezirat Sirri lie in that order from 3| to 9^ miles westward of a line drawn 5 southward from Ras Bustaneh. Far6r shoal. —The least depth over this shoal, 2| fathoms (4 m 6), is found at its eastern end about 5J miles south-westward of Ras Bustaneh; from this position {Lat. 26° 26' NLong. 54° 33' E.) the shoal, as defined by the 6-fathom (ll m 0) line, extends in a westerly 10 direction for about 3 miles, the bottom being rock and sand. The shoal, which is frequented by fishermen, lies close within the 20- fathom (36 m 6) line off the Persian coast, the depths between it and the 3f-fathom (6 m 9) patch off Ras Bustaneh being from 11 to 17 fathoms (20 m l to 31 m l), rock; but close southward of the patch 15 there is a depth of 22 fathoms (6 m 7). The tidal streams set strongly over the shoal causing ripplings and much discolouration of the water; overfalls occur between the shoal and Ras Bustaneh. A small bank, over which the least depth obtained is 8 fathoms (14 m 6), sand, was discovered by H.M.S. Nimble, in 1873, in a 20 position about 7| miles southward of Ras Bustaneh and about miles south-eastward of the shoalest part of Fariir shoal. The depths close round this bank are from 22 to 39 fathoms (40 m 2 to 71^3). Jezirat Farftr. Anchorage. —This island, the northern extremity of which is situated about 12^ miles south-south-westward of Ras 25 Bustaneh and about 7 miles southward of Farur shoal, rises in dark volcanic hills to a table-topped conical peak 465 feet (141 m 7) high. See view on chart 2837a. The eastern coast of the island is fringed with a rocky steep-to reef extending offshore for about 2 cables ; on the western side of the island, is a rocky flat, with some detached 30 above-water rocks upon it, extending about one cable offshore- depths of 6 fathoms (11^0) will be found close off the edge of the flat; elsewhere the coasts of the island are steep-to, there being depths of from 24 to 40 fathoms (43 m 9 to 73 m 2) at about 3 cables from the cliffs. 35 From its height, dark colour, and the fact that it is steep-to, the island is sometimes made at night, in thick weather, or during the haze of a summer shamal; when attempting this, caution.

The island is inhabited and is used for grazing cattle from the mainland; it abounds with gazelle. In a ravine on the eastern 5 side are a few date trees and some wells containing a little water; there is also a small sandy cove, about one cable deep, the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line being about 2 cables from its head, at which latter is a fairly conspicuous bushy tree. The village stands in the dry bed of a river, with cliffs about 50 feet (15 m 2) high on either hand, 10 at the head of this cove, and on the cliff on its southern side are a number of ruined huts at one of which is a flagstaff from which a light is occasionally exhibited. Anchorage was obtained by H.M.S. Crocus, in 1929, off the eastern side of the island and close to the cove, in a depth of 27 fathoms 15 (49 m 4), sand and shells, at about 2f cables offshore with the village bearing about 240°. Anchorage has also been obtained, in a depth of 20 fathoms (36 m 6), with the village bearing about 257°. Anchorage has been obtained in a small bay, at the southern end of the island, in a depth of 17 fathoms (31 m l), sand and shells. 20 Fish, especially rock cod, were plentiful in the bay. In suitable weather, landing can be effected on the eastern part of a steeply shelving beach. Jezirat Nabiyu Farur. —This island, situated about 8J miles south-south-westward of the southern extremity of Jezirat Farur, 25 is the smallest of the three southward of Ras Bustaneh and has a remarkable dark-coloured saddle-hill, 120 feet (36 m 6) high, on its eastern side. See view on chart 2837a. A rocky reef, partly above water and marked at times by breakers, extends for a distance of about one mile in a north-north-westerly so direction from the island. The western and southern coasts are fringed by a narrow reef. A bank {Lat. 26° 06' NLong. 54° 26' E.), over which there is a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6), hard bottom, lies about IJ miles south- south-westward of the island; it has not been thoroughly examined 35 and it is therefore possible that there may be depths over it less than charted. A bank, over which there is a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3), lies about one mile westward of the island. With the foregoing exceptions, Jezirat Nabiyu Farur is compara- 40 tively steep-to and soundings give no warning of its proximity. Jezirat Sirri .—Anchorage .—The northern end of this island is situated about 12 miles south-south-eastward of Jezirat Nabiyu Farur and its eastern side lies about 25 miles westward of the western extremity of Jezirat Bu Musa, see page 119; it is low and on it are 45 many small detached dark hillocks, none of which are more than 50 feet (15 m 2) high. See view on chart 2837a. Several above- water rocks lie off its north-western coast, one being about half a mile westward of its north-western extremity. The eastern coast of the island, and the low sandy point forming its south-eastern 50 extremity, are steep-to; but elsewhere foul ground extends offshore for about half a mile. The 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lies from half a mile to 1| miles offshore, and soundings give no warning of the proximitv of the island. Charts 2387a, 748b.140 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2830. Sirri village is situated on the southern coast of the island about 11 miles from its south-eastern extremity. Near the village is a flagstaff and several large and conspicuous trees. On the northern 5 part of the island, are several houses and small date groves. The inhabitants of the island are mostly engaged in the pearl industry. Cattle and goats are sent over from the mainland for grazing. There are some wells near the village of Sirri. Anchorage off the island is indifferent; the best position is, in 10 a depth of about 8 fathoms (14 m 6), rock, about half a mile offshore, between the wells at Sirri and the south-eastern extremity of the island; this position is partially sheltered, both from the shamal and the nashi, but the holding ground is bad, as is the landing at the village. {Lat. 25° 54' N., Long. 54° 32' E.) 15 At about 41 miles south-south-westward of Jezlrat Sirri is the island of Sir Bu Na'air, see page 179. Directions. —Vessels may pass either northward or southward of any of the foregoing islands, and by day, unless very hazy, the passages present no difficulty. For vessels proceeding up or down 20 the Gulf, the passage between Farur shoal and Jezirat Farur is to be preferred. By keeping in depths greater than 25 fathoms (45 m 7), vessels will pass well southward of Farur shoal, and Jezirat Farur usually shows up well at night; but vessels must guard against a northerly set which is sometimes experienced between Jezirat Tunb 25 and Jezfrat Sheikh Shu'aib, see page 145. COAST OF SHlBKlJH.—Aspect .—The coast of this district of Persia extends from Charak to Banak, about 140 miles north westward . The dominant feature of the whole of the mainland portion of the 30 district is the great maritime range of south Persia which rises steeply from the coast at its northern end and, trending south-eastward, gradually recedes inland and terminates in the rounded mountain about 10 miles northward of Basidu point, see page 131. North ward of the plain behind Jabal Bustaneh there are several dark 55 summits, one of which, situated about 17 miles north-north westward of that mountain, is about 1,500 feet (457 m 2) high, hay cock-shaped, and conspicuous. Kuh Namki or Jabal Turanjeh, see view on chart 2837a, is of a flattened dome shape, light in colour, and has a small hummock iO on its summit; it rises to an elevation of 5,150 feet (1569 m 7) about 24 miles west-xiorth-westward of the haycock-shaped mountain, and is conspicuous from seaward from off Basidu until on an easterly bearing, but within 10 miles of the coast is obscured by a lower range in front of it. 4:5 The lower or coastal range is from 2,000 to 3,000 feet (GOQ^ to 914 m 4) high, and extends in a westerly direction from a position close northward of Charak, see page 136, to Nakhilu, see page 142. At about 8 miles west-north-westward of Charak, there is a somewhat conspicuous peak. 50 There are a number of coastal towns and villages where small supplies of cattle and poultry might be obtained. The population is a mixture Persian and Arab blood. » Charts 2837a, 748h.Chap. V.] COAST OF SHfBKtfH 141 Chart 2830. Coast.—Anchorages. —From Ras Tavuneh, the coast trends westward for about 13£ miles to Gurzeh and is steep-to with a plain between it and the foot of the coastal hills. Gurzeh, a small village in which there is a tower and near which 5 is a date grove, is situated on the northern side of a bay, the shore of which is fairly steep-to. Anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, may be obtained close off Gurzeh. Kalat al Abeid is a fishing village situated on the coast about 10 4| miles west-south-westward of Gurzeh. Between these two places the coast appears to be fronted by a flat that extends offshore for about half a mile. See view facing page 145. A fort, with a round tower, stands on a hill, 250 feet (76 m 2) high, behind Kalat al Abeid, and eastward of the village are a number 15 of date groves. There are two towers, one round and the other square, in the village, and below the fort, on a hillock about 150 feet (45 m 7) high, is a tomb; at about one mile eastward of the village are several birkehs from which water can usually be obtained. Anchorage may be obtained close offshore southward of Kalat 20 al Abeid, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), sand, with the western extremity of the land bearing 260°, Caution is necessary as there may be less depths in the vicinity. The anchorage is sheltered from the shamdl and partially from the nashi; at about three-quarters of a mile offshore there is but little shelter. Landing 25 at the village is bad and often impracticable. A flat on which the sea breaks, extends about half a mile offshore between positions about If and 4| miles westward of Kalat al Abeid, that part of the coast rising steeply to a small range of hills about 200 feet (Ol 11 ^)) high. 30 At about 10 miles south-south-eastward of Kalat al Abeid is Jezirat Qais, see page 142. Chart 2837a, plan of Chiru. Chiru.—Anchorage. —This fishing village, at which there is a conspicuous square fort with a large square tower at each corner, 35 and near which is a large date grove, is situated on the western side of a bay about miles westward of Kalat al Abeid. A conspicuous yellow tower, about 30 feet (9 m l) in height, stands on the shore about 4 cables north-eastward of the fort. Chiru point {Lat. 26° 41' N., Long. 53° 45' E.), situated about 40 three-quarters of a mile south-south-westward of the fort, is a low projection that is steep-to on its southern and eastern sides. A flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends about 3| cables offshore eastward of Chiru village. Good anchorage may be obtained off Chiru in a depth of about 45 8 fathoms (14 m 6); it is easy of access, sheltered from the shamal, but open to easterly winds. Landing may be effected, opposite the fort or the village, on a steep-to sandy beach; but during easterly winds it is bad. Chart 2830. 50 Coast.—From Chiru point, the coast trends north-westward for about 16 miles to Ras Nakhilu and rises steeply to hills which decrease in height towards, and terminate near, the point. Charts 2837a, 748b.142 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2830. Jazeh, a table-topped hummock about 800 feet (243 m 8) high, is situated about 8 miles north-westward of Chiru point and 4 miles inland; from southward it is fairly conspicuous. All the hills 5 in this locality are light in colour. A flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), sand, extends about one mile offshore for the first 3| miles north-westward of Chiru point; it is marked by discoloured water. Bandar Mansuri is an anchorage used by native craft on the fiat 10 from 2 to 3 miles westward of Chiru point; it affords indifferent shelter to such craft during easterly winds. At about 4J miles westward of Chiru point is the eastern end of Jezi'rat Hindarabi, see page 144. Makahil and Jazeh are small fishing villages on the coast about 15 13 and 14| miles, respectively, north-westward of Chiru point; there is a tower in each village and some trees near them. The anchorage off the villages is quite open and the coast is steep-to. Ras Nakhilu, at which point the coast turns northward, is low and ill-defined; close northward of it are some sandhills. 20 A flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends about 8 cables south-westward from Ras Nakhilu. At about 4| miles south-westward of Ras Nakhilu, lies Jezirat Shatvar, close off the eastern end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib, see page 145. 25 Nakhilu, situated about 4 miles northward of Ras Nakhilu, is a village near which is a large grove of date and other trees. Anchorage, sheltered from easterly winds but open to the shamal, may be obtained off Nakhilu and the coast northward of it. Chart 3380, plan of Magam. 30 Mugam.—Anchorage.— At a distance of about 3J miles north ward of Nakhilu is the large village of Mugam (Magam), near which is a large square fort. At about 14 cables north-westward of the fort; a conspicuous triangular cliff, about 165 feet (50^3) high, * stands about 4 cables inland from the coast. A flat, over which 35 the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends for a distance of about 8 cables offshore abreast and north-westward of the village. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0), mud, with the fort bearing 058°, distant about 13 cables, or close off the edge of the flat, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), with 40 the fort bearing 063°, distant about one mile. Chart 2830. OFF-LYING ISLANDS AND BANKS.— Off the coast of Shfbkuh, between Charak and Nakhilu, are four islands and a similar number of banks on the south-westernmost of which latter 45 there is a dangerous shoal. Jezirat Qais.—Light-vessel. —Jezirat Qais, lying about 9 miles offshore southward of Gurzeh, see page 141, is of even outline and rises to a plateau about 120 feet (36 m 6) high; being light brown in colour, it is difficult to see it at night. 50 A light vessel [Lat. 26 29 N,, Long. 53° 58' E, from which a light is exhibited at an elevation of 32 feet (9 m 8), is moored close within the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line, near the middle of the southern side of Jezirat Qais. The hull of the light-vessel is painted red Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. V.] ISLANDS 143 Chart 2830. with the name KAIS ISLAND in white letters on either side. The vessel has one mast which carries the lantern. The coasts of the island are low and consist of sandy beaches between rocky points; but the eastern and western extremities are 5 low cliffs. There are many trees on the island and several villages stand on its northern side; the interior is partly cultivated. Water can be obtained by digging wells almost anywhere near the coast, but would probably be brackish after a long draught. The in habitants send a number of boats to the pearl fishery. 10 Reefs, in most places steep-to, fringe the coasts of the island but nowhere do they extend for a greater distance than one mile offshore. The 20-fathom line lies from to miles offshore, and a small detached bank, with a depth of 14 fathoms (25 m 6) over it, was reported, in 1922, to lie about 2| miles eastward of the eastern 15 extremity of the island. From East point, the eastern extremity of the island, the coast trends southward for about half a mile and then curves westward and north-westward for about 9 miles to its western end; there are one or two small clumps of date trees on the southern coast. 20 Foul ground extends about half a mile off the southern and western coasts of the island, with depths of 6 and 8 fathoms (llmO and 14 m 6) close outside it; beyond this the depths increase rapidly. From the western extremity of the island, the coast trends north eastward for about 3f miles to its northern point, and is fronted by 25 a reef, with depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) over it, that extends offshore for a distance of nearly one mile. Chart 2837a, plan of Kais anchorage. Safil, a small village, is situated about three-quarters of a mile south-westward of the northern extremity of Jezi'rat Qais; at low 30 water, landing at the village is bad, for a reef dries off it for about one-quarter of a mile; the edge of the foul ground lies about 7 cables offshore northward of the village. From the northern extremity of the island, which is cliffy and about 15 feet (4 m 6) high, the coast trends eastward for about 3f 35 miles to North-east point and is fronted by a flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), to a distance of from 3 to 6 cables offshore. {Lat. 26° 34' N., Long. 54° 02' E.) Dih, situated about IJ miles westward of North-east point, is a small village at which there are date plantations and gardens; 40 at about half-way between Dih and the northern extremity of the island are the ruins of the ancient Muhammadan town of Hanra which flourished in the 12th century. North-east point is low and sandy and upon it is a conspicuous fort with two towers; the flag is flown from the northern tower. 45 A sandy spit, extends north-north-eastward from North-east point for a distance of about 6^ cables; there are depths of 3| fathoms over its outer part, and within 3 cables of the point the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5); the edge of the spit is steep-to. Masheh village, the inhabitants of which are employed chiefly 50 in the pearl fishery, extends for about one mile along the shore of the bay of the same name southward of North-east point. In the village is a well. A conspicuous tree stands behind the southern end of the village. Charts 2830, 2837a, 748b.144 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2837a, plan of Kais anchorage. East point, at the southern end of Masheh bay, is a cliff about 6 feet (l m 8) high with a ruined tower upon it; it is situated nearly 3 miles south-eastward of North-east point. 5 In Masheh bay, the depths decrease regularly from 6 fathoms (ll m 0) at about 3 cables eastward of North-east point and the northern part of the village; but foul ground extends for a distance of about 7 cables northward from East point. Anchorage.—Directions .—The best anchorage at Jezi'rat Qais is off the northern part of Masheh village, eastward of North-east point. In summer, when easterly winds are not experienced and shelter from the shamal is often required, vessels should anchor, in depths of from 8 to 9 fathoms (14 m 6 to 16 m 5), mud, with the fort on North- 15 east point bearing between 283° and 294°. In winter, anchorage may be obtained in the foregoing position, or northward of North-east point [Lat. 26° 34' N., Long. 54° 02' E.)' in a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3), with the fort on North-east point bearing 180°, distant about three-quarters of a mile. The latter 20 position is partially sheltered from the shamal, which in this locality blows from westward; and sailing vessels could put to sea if an easterly gale arose. Anchorage may also be obtained, in a depth of 8 fathoms (14m6) ) about 1| miles northward of Hanra, but it is exposed to the pre- 25 vailing winds. The tidal streams in the passage between Jezfrat Qais and the mainland are reported to be strong and very irregular; in the offing they are weak. Vessels passing northward of Jezi'rat Qais should not close the 30 island to a distance less than 2 miles unless about to anchor The passage northward of the island is not recommended at night unless the island can be seen. Chart 2830. Sambarun bank. Ihis bank, lying from 5^ to 8f miles south- 35 ward of Chiru pomt, page 141, has a least depth over it of about 6 fathoms (ll m 0), rock; there are depths of 17 and 12 fathoms (31 m l and 21 m 9) northward and southward, respectively, of its shoalest part, and from 21 to 33 fathoms (38 m 4 to 60 m 4) close round it. Jezirat Hindarabi.—Anchorage.—Caution.— This island, the 40 eastern end of which is situated about 4 miles west-south-westward of Chiru point, see page 141, and about 2f miles from the coast of inn ™ am ^ n&lt; ^ 0 ^ Persia, rises gradually to an elevation of about 100 feet (30 m 5); it is brown in colour and difficult to see at night. A large banyan tree stands on the south-eastern point of the island • 45 the eastern and western points are low cliffs, and at about one-quarter t off n? e western P oint is a flat detached rock about 10 feet (3^0) high. There is a walled village near the middle of the northern coast near which are a few trees, some cultivation, and a few wells; but the water in the latter is brackish in summer 50 A reef fringes most of the coast of the island; on the northern sidejt extends about one-quarter of a mile offshore, making landing at the village bad at low water; off the north-eastern and eastern C ° asts i re 1 ef f . a llttle broader and is steep-to; on the southern side of the island it probably extends about one mile offshore, and Charts 2837a, 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap.

A flat, over which the depths are less than 6 fathoms (ll m 0), extends about one mile westward of the western end of the island. The depths are less than 10 fathoms (18 in 3) at about 2 miles westward and one mile northward of the island. Anchorage may be obtained off the village in depths of from 6 to 8 fathoms (ll m 0 to 14 m 6), rock; but it is open to the shamal. A current is said sometimes to set towards Hindarabi and the coast in its vicinity; caution is therefore necessary at night. The tidal stream is strong northward of the island, but weak in the offing. Charts 2837b, plan of Sheikh Shu'aib anchorage, 2830. Jezirat Shatvar. —This island lies about three-quarters of a mile east-south-eastward of the eastern end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib and about 4| miles south-westward of Ras Nakhilu, see page 142. It appears to be fringed with reefs to a distance of about 1| cables offshore, and a shoal, over which the depths are less than 6 fathoms (ll m 0), extends about one mile southward and the same distance eastward from it. The 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lies about 1| miles eastward and 3 miles southward of the island; but there is a small detached bank, apparently of hard sand, over which the depth is 9 fathoms (16 m 5), in a position about 3^ miles east-south-eastward of it. Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib. —This island, the eastern end of which is situated about 6 miles west-south-westward of Ras Nakhilu, is brown in colour and its eastern and western extremities are low but thence it rises to a number of hummocks having an elevation of about 120 feet (36 m 6), see view facing this page. A very conspicuous tower stands near the eastern end of the island, and a single large round conspicuous tree grows on its summit about 7| miles westward of the tower. In the middle of the island is a valley in which are four small villages. The low eastern point of the island {Lat. 26° 48' N., Long. 53° 24' E.) consists of sand, but the south-eastern point, situated about 4 cables south-south-westward, is a cliff about 20 feet (6 m l) high. From this cliff, the southern coast trends westward for about 4| miles to a low sandy point on which stands the village of Kurat; at the village is a tower and a large grove of date and other trees. From Kurat, the coast, consisting for the most part of rocky cliffs, trends westward and north-westward for about 9 miles to the western extremity of the island; this latter point is also rocky and is about 6 or 10 feet (l m 8 or 3 m 0) high. From the western end of the island, the northern coast trends eastward for about 2 miles to a small bight that affords good landing for boats; thence, continuing eastward and south-eastward to the eastern end of the island, it consists of cliff with one or two sandy bights. Ras, a village at which there is a round tower and also a few trees, is situated about 1| miles eastward of the western extremity of the island. Dekhun and Laza are small villages/situated, respectively, about 61 and 7 miles eastward of Ras; at the eastern of the two villages, there is a tower. Laz, the principal village in the island, stands on a small rocky Charts 2837a, 2837b, 748b.146 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Charts 2837b, plan of Sheikh Shu'aih anchorage, 2830. point on the northern coast about one mile from its eastern end; at the village is the conspicuous tower, which is high and square; southward of it are many large round trees and a few date palms. 5 Shoals. —A narrow spit extends eastward from the eastern ex tremity of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib; there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) on it at a distance of about half a mile offshore and thence the depths increase gradually eastward. In the fairway of the channel between Jezirat Shiekh Shu'aib 10 and Shatvar there is a depth of 2\ fathoms (4 m 6); the best course through is reported to be from a position about 3 cables off the south-eastern extremity of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib to a position about 2\ cables north-westward of Jezirat Shatvar, but caution is necessary as the channel has not been examined. 15 The southern coast of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib is fringed with a reef to a distance of about one cable offshore, beyond which the depths are shoal for nearly one mile; at that distance there are depths of from 6 to 9 fathoms (ll 11 ^) to IG^), increasing rapidly to 35 and 45 fathoms (64 m 0 and 82 ni 3). 20 A flat, over which the depths are less than 6 fathoms (11™*)), extends westward for about one mile from the western end of the island, with depths of about 10 fathoms (18 m 3) for about 2 miles north-westward of it. A reef from one to 2 cables wide, fringes the northern coast and 25 depths of from 9 to 13 fathoms (16 m 5 to 23 m 8) will be found about one mile offshore. Anchorages. — Directions. — Tidal streams. — During south easterly winds, sheltered anchorage might be obtained, off the eastern end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib, in depths of from 4 to 7 30 fathoms (7 m 3 to 12 m 8), sand and rock, at a distance of about half a mile offshore north-eastward of Laz village; but it would be necessary to put to sea on the approach of a shamal for in this locality that wind blows from west-north-westward. Shelter from the shamdl can be obtained southward of the eastern 35 end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib {Lat. 26° 48' N., Long. 53° 24' E.), in a depth of about 8 fathoms (14^6), at from 3 to 5 cables offshore between Kurat village and Jezirat Shatvar, but the locality has been only partially examined. Anchorage, well sheltered from the shamal, and to some extent 40 from easterly winds also, may be obtained in the channel between Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib and Jezirat Shatvar in a depth of about 3 fathoms (5 ni 5), sand and rock; but the holding ground of decaying coral is very bad and the anchorage is not recommended; vessels using it should approach from southward and anchor rather nearer 45 the western side of the channel, with the tower at Laz in line with the low eastern point of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib. Jezirat Sheikh Shu aib is exceedingly difficult to see at night or in hazy weather, and soundings are of little use when approaching it. When passing between Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib and the mainland, 50 the coast in the vicinity of Ras Nakhilu should not be approached into depths less than 15 fathoms (27 m 4). Caution is necessary as the tidal streams set across the channel and run strongly between Jezirat Sheikh Shu aib and Jezirat Shatvar, causing a ripple on the spit extending from the eastern end of the former.

The tidal streams in the channel, between Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib and Jezirat Shatvar, set north-north-eastward and south-south- westward; between the islands and the mainland they are strong, but in the offing they are weak. 5 Chart 2830. Banks.—Shoal. —Stiffe bank, lying between 20 and 25 miles southward of the western end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib, has depths over it of from 15 to 19 fathoms (27 m 4 to 34: m 7), sand, shells, and coral; the depths close round it are from 30 to 40 fathoms (54 m 9 10 to 73 m 2). Shah A Hum shoal, so named from the vessel Shah A Hum having passed over it in 1857, is a small dangerous rocky patch in the track of vessels passing up and down the Gulf. It lies about 42| miles south-westward of the western extremity of Jezirat Sheikh 15 Shu'aib, and the least-known depth over it is 2 fathoms (3 II1 7). It is steep-to, and lies near the northern end of a bank over which the general depths are less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6). No discolouration of the sea has been observed and the shoal cannot be seen from aloft; some white birds are, however, usually hovering over it. 20 Cable bank, lying between 34 and 37 miles west-south-westward of the western end of Jezirat Sheikh Shu'aib, has a least known depth over it of 14 fathoms (25 m 6); it was passed over by vessels laying the telegraph cable in 1885. COAST.—Aspect. —From Mugam, see page 142, the coast 25 trends west-north-westward for about 19 miles to the village of Shivuh, and along it runs a range of hills over which can be seen the summits of another range, from 4,000 to 5,000 feet (1219 m 2 to 1524 m 0) high, that runs parallel with it, and about 12 miles inland. North-eastward of Mugam, there is a fall or dip in the 30 coastal hills that is conspicuous. Bandar Basatin, about 4| miles west-north-westward of the fort at Mugam, is a little bay, the small low point at the western end of which projects from rocky hills; near the point are some birkehs and from it a spit extends offshore for about half a mile. 35 The position of the bay may be identified by a low, jagged, light- coloured ridge of rock which, in line with a peak 4,870 feet (1484 m 4) high, bearing 033°, leads to its western point. Anchorage may be obtained about half a mile eastward of the point though it is but little sheltered from the shamal, which in the vicinity 40 blows from westward or west-north-westward. Small vessels might anchor with the point bearing 270°; larger vessels should anchor as close inshore as their draught permits; there is a depth of about 10 fathoms (18 m 3) at a distance of about one mile offshore. From Bandar Basatin (Lat. 27° 00' N., Long. 53° 25' E.), the 45 coast trends west-north-westward for about 14 miles to Shivuh and rises steeply to the summits of the precipitous coastal hills which are there from 200 to 300 feet (O^O to 91 m 4) high. In a position about 2^ miles eastward of Shivuh there is a somewhat conspicuous saddle-shaped hill about 400 feet (121 m 9) high; and 50 at a distance of about 9 miles north-eastward of that place is a mountain, known as the Paps, that is fairly conspicuous, especially from westward, and forms a useful landmark. Charts 2837a, 2837b, 748b.148 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 3599, plan of Shivuh. Shivuh.—Light.—Anchorage. —This village is situated on the eastern point of a small shallow indentation in the coast; in the village is a large square white mosque, close eastward of which is a 5 fort; a tower, about 120 feet (36 m 6) high, stands on a small hill behind the village, and there also are three large banyan trees; at a distance of about half a mile east-south-eastward of the village, is a peaked hill from 200 to 300 feet (61 m 0 to 91 m 4) high. The villagers are mostly engaged in the pearl and fishing industries. 10 A light is hoisted at the flagstaff of the Customs-house when a vessel is expected. [Lat. 27° 05' NLong. 53° 09' E.) The wells close to the beach contain good water; in 1923, it was reported that fowls and eggs were at all times procurable, and that meat and fish could be obtained at short notice. 15 A long flat black rocky ledge off the south-eastern end of the village forms a small boat harbour. Gill rock, small and about 4 feet (l m 2) high, stands in the middle of the bay westward of the village in depths of from 1J to 2 fathoms (2 m 3 to 3 m 7), sand. 20 Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), sand, at about one-quarter of a mile off the black rocky ledge. In 1911, H .M.S. Philomel found this anchorage to be good even when the shamal was blowing; although there was a swell that rendered landing impossible, it was much less than that experienced at other 25 open anchorages. There is a depth of 15 fathoms (27 m 4) at a distance of about one mile offshore; but the depths shoal from 10 to 5 fathoms (18 m 3 to 9 m l) within a distance of one cable. The tidal streams are weak and the above-mentioned vessel lay with her head to the wind. 30 When practicable, the best landing place is in the boat harbour. Chart 2830. Coast.—Anchorages .—At about 2 miles westward of Shivuh is a rocky point from which the hills rise steeply. Bandar Kalatu, westward of the foregoing point, is a bay that 35 affords good shelter to small native craft during a shamal; the bay affords better shelter to a vessel of moderate size than does the anchorage off Shivuh; vessels should anchor about 2| cables from the point and as far into the bay the draught permits. The coast, for about 5 miles westward of Kalatu, is indented and 40 in most places cliffy; from the small sandy bays the hills rise steeply ; there are a number of boat anchorages, close inshore sheltered from the shamal, and the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lies about 1| miles offshore. Ziyarat and Buraghleh are small villages, in each of which are two birkehs, situated respectivelv, about li and 2i miles westward 45 of Kalatu. Bustani is a village, situated at the head of a small bay, about one mile north-westward of Buraghleh. A ridge of grey-coloured rock, about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, runs down to the coast close eastward of the village and on its southern end is a tower. North- 50 ward of the village there is a small creek navigable by dhows, but its entrance is difficult of identification. Anchorage, probably the best in the neighbourhood, may be obtained off Bustani in a depth of 7 fathoms (12m8) at a distance of about 6 cables from the village; depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l) will Charts 2837a, 2837b, 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap. V.] COAST OF SHIBKUH 149 Chart 2830. be found about 2| cables offshore and 2 fathoms (3 m 7) at one cable from the beach. The anchorage is well protected from the shamal and, in February, 1924, H.M .S. Crocus rode out a strong kaus without dragging. A considerable surf runs inshore, but safe landing can be effected at the south-eastern end of the village by steering for the centre of the latter and when clear of the breakers steering south-eastward parallel with the coast; smooth water is obtained inside a reef that projects west-north-westward from the south-eastern end of the village for a distance of about 60 yards (54 m 9). Shahin Kiih, about 2| miles north-eastward of Bustani, is a remarkable mountain with precipitous sides; it is flat-topped and its southern bluff is about 1,100 feet (335 m 3) high, see views B and C on chart 2837b. Kharabeh and Dastur are two small settlements situated close together about 2 miles westward of Bustani. The inhabitants of both are fisherfolk. Amarieh is a small fishing village on a hill about 5f miles north westward of Dastur. Tib in is a small village about 5^ miles north-westward of Amarieh; it lies in a little bay and, except for one square hut, is scarcely noticeable from seaward. It is reported that, in the vicinity, there is a bight in the coast that is not shown on the chart, and at a distance of about one mile northward of the village is a small creek, open south-eastward, that affords shelter to dhows; it is not visible from seaward. The natives of Tib in fish for pearls, and there is a pearl bank extending from close westward of the village almost to Amarieh. Charts 2837a and h. The coast from Tib in trends north-westward for about 15 miles to Ras Naband and is bold, steep-to and rocky with low cliffs; it is devoid of anchorages or shelter. Khuvadan, Ghaf, Ras Ghurab, and Barku are small villages between Tibin and Ras Naband, the inhabitants of which dive for pearls on the small banks that fringe this part of the coast. Ras Naband. —This wide projection is faced with a rocky cliff about 10 feet (3 in 0) high; south-eastward of the point the land rises gradually to the summits of white precipitous flat-topped cliffs from 60 to 80 feet (18 m 3 to 24 m 4) high. At a distance of about half a mile inland from the point is a large date tree, and in a position about 3 miles south-eastward of it is a conspicuous solitary tree growing on some high tableland. The western side of the point {Lat. 27° 23' NLong. 52° 35' E.) is steep-to, and the depths increase gradually to 30 fathoms (54 m 9) at a distance of about 3 miles offshore; but a shoal, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends about half a mile northward and 2£ miles north-eastward from the point. Pearls are fished for off Ras Naband; this and the banks remarked on above are the only places off the Persian coast where any have been found, but none of much value have been obtained. The tidal streams in the vicinity and in Naband bay are scarcely perceptible. Naband bay.—Shoal. —This bay is entered between Ras Naband Chart 748b.PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Charts 2837a and b. and a point situated about 5 miles north-north-eastward. The depths in the entrance are about 10 fathoms (18 m 3) and they decrease gradually within; but the head of the bay is shallow, there being 5 depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), mud, at a distance of about 2 miles from the shore. A small rocky patch, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies about 1J miles south-westward of the northern entrance point of Naband bay; it is steep-to and does not show up well 10 Gabandi valley runs east-south-eastward from the head of Naband bay, for about 35 miles, between the coastal hills and the mountain range behind them. On its northern side, the hills are of con siderable height and fairly precipitous; at a distance of about 15 miles eastward of the head of Naband bay is a bluff, about 3,600 15 feet (1097 m 3) high, that is conspicuous from north-westward. From Ras Naband, the shore of the bay trends eastward for about 4^ miles, thence it curves northward and westward to the low northern entrance point from which a reef extends for a distance oi about one-quarter of a mile.

Ihe southern shore of the bay is low and rocky, and behind it the coastal hills rise to a moderate height; the shore at the head is 25 low sandy, and m places swampy. At a few miles eastward of the nead of the bay, a pass leads into the interior. Naband, a village with several conspicuous trees on either side oi it and a square fort at its western end, stands on the southern shore of the bay about 2| miles within Ras Naband. Wheat and 20 barley are exported, principally to Bahrein. Fish, cattle, and vegetables might be obtained.

Naband village {Lat. 27° 23' N., Long. 52° 38' £.), bearing be tween 135° and 180°, distant about one mile; the holding ground is, however, reported to be bad. Anchorage, stated to be partly sheltered from the shamal, may be obtained, in a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), good holding ground, with a square house westward of Baidheh Khan village bearing 019°, and a tower, situated about miles south-eastward of the village, bearing 086°. Landing can be effected anywhere in the bay except in northerly or westerly winds, which raise a heavy surf. The passage between the 3-fathom (5 m 5) shoal 1| miles off the northern entrance point and the reef off that point is about one mile wide, but it should not be used; by far the better entrance, which is about 2 miles wide, is that between the shoal and the reef off Naband village. Coast.—Aspect. —From the northern entrance point of Naband bay, the coast trends north-westward for about 40 miles to Banak and along it extends a range of mountains the seaward side of which appears to be precipitous; at times the fires of the charcoal burners may be seen high up in the mountains. Date groves begin close north-westward of the northern entrance point of Naband bay and extend along the coast past 'Asalu town. Jabal Sir i Yalfal or 'Asalu notch, situated about 6 miles north ward of the northern entrance point of Naband bay, is a summit in the coastal range, 4,870 feet (1484 m 4) high, that appears as a great step, except from westward when it looks like a sharp notch. See views A, C, E, and F on chart 2837b. Jabal Siri 'Ayanat or Barn hill, situated about 26 miles north westward of Jabal Sir i Yalfal and about 5 miles inland, is a most conspicuous bam-shaped peak, 4,660 feet (1420 m 4) high, on a long level-topped part of the range that terminates, about 17 miles farther north-westward, in a great step, named the Fall; on easterly bearings the peak appears to be small. See views A, C, F, and H on chart 2837b, and facing page 145. When close inshore, Jabal Siri 'Ayanat is obscured from view by a lower coastal range that commences about 12 miles south-eastward of it and increases in height north-westward past Banak. 'Asalu.—Anchorage. —This village is situated about one mile north-westward of the northern entrance point of Naband bay and extends along the coast for a distance of about half a mile; there is a large date grove behind the village and a conspicuous though partially destroyed round tower stands on a small hillock some distance north-westward of it. Some of the inhabitants are employed in pearl fishing. A reef extends over half a mile offshore for a distance of about 3^ miles north-westward of the northern entrance point of Naband bay; there are depths of 5 and 6 fathoms (9 m l and ll m 0) close outside the reef which should not be approached into a depth less than 7 fathoms (12 m 8). Boats pass over the reef and shelter close to the village in depths rather greater than those on the reef. Anchorage off the village is open to the shamal; the holding ground is poor, and it is necessary to approach with caution as the shore reef is very steep-to. Chart 748b.152 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Charts 2837a and b. Coast.—Shoal.—Caution. —Nakhl Tagi, situated about 2 miles north-westward of 'Asalu, is a small village at which there is a fort and a tower; there are some date trees nearby and two or three 5 large round trees stand between the village and 'Asalu. A reef, close outside which there are depths of 8 fathoms (l^G), extends about one-quarter of a mile offshore, and caution should be exercised when approaching it. The 20-fathom (36 m 6) line lies about one mile offshore between Nakhl Tagi and Tahiri, situated 10 about 17 miles north-westward; the bottom is of mud. Barak [Lat. 27° 39' N., Long., 52° 24' E.), situated about 13 miles north-westward of Nakhl Tagi, is a small village with a fort, a square tower, and a date grove. A small village, in which there is a square tower, stands about 2| miles south-eastward of Barak. 15 The coast between Nakhl Tagi and Barak rises steeply to the hills; it is nearly steep-to and has little or no shore reef. A low point projects from the coast line about 2 miles westward of Barak and affords partial shelter from the shamal to boats anchored off the village. 20 A shoal, over which the depths are from 2 to 3J fathoms (3 m 7 to 6 m 4), extends south-south-eastward from the foregoing point for about one mile, and is steep-to. Tahiri.—Anchorage. —This fishing village is situated on the shore of Tahiri bay, about 3J miles north-westward of Barak, and 25 extends some way up the side of the coastal hills which there rise from the head of the bay to an elevation of about 700 feet (213 m 4). Two forts, neither of which are conspicuous, stand at the eastern end of the village and at about half a mile eastward of them are three large round conspicuous trees. On the foreshore, in the middle 30 of the village, are two white mosques about \\ cables apart, and on a small hill westward of the village is a large fort with a square wind-tower, near which is a large conspicuous round tower with a white band near its top and a flagstaff. A few cattle and some vegetables might be obtained at the village; water is plentiful and 35 good. The north-western point of the bay, situated about one mile westward of the village, is low and almost steep-to; near it are some date groves. The depths in the bay shoal gradually from 8 fathoms (14 m 6) at about half a mile offshore. Anchorage, partially sheltered from the shamal but exposed to 40 the kaus, may be obtained, in a depth of about 6 fathoms (ll 11 ^)), good holding ground, close offshore with the western entrance point of the bay bearing about 284°. Chart 2837b. Coast.—Anchorages.— The coast between Tahiri and Banak, 45 situated about 21 miles north-westward is fairly steep-to and may be approached to a distance of about half a mile. Achar, situated about 4 miles north-westward of Tahiri, is a small village almost hidden in date groves but it has a large round conspicuous mosque in the middle of it. 50 Anchorage, exposed to the kaus, may be obtained, in a depth of 11 fathoms (20 m l), good holding ground, at a distance of about half a mile south-westward of the mosque. Ras Achar and Ras Aswat are two small slightly projecting points Chart 748b.Chap. V.] COAST OF. DASHTI 153 Chart 2837h. about 2 miles west-north-westward of Achar, between which is a bight in which boats can anchor sheltered by the latter point. 'Ayanat, situated about 3| miles north-westward of Achar, is a village, that is also known as Tumbak, with a few trees interspersed 5 amongst the houses, and date groves at either end of it. A tower stands at the western end of the village. See view facing page 145. Anchorage, open but said to be tolerably good during a shamal, may be obtained off 'Ayanat in a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3). Two reefs, marked by breakers, lie one on each side of 'Ayanat 10 and form a boat harbour; they extend parallel with the coast at from one-half to three-quarters of a mile offshore; the western reef is about 1| miles in length and the eastern reef one mile. The channel between the reefs is about half a mile wide. The landing is good. Dhows anchor inside the reefs. 15 Miyalu is a village about 3| miles north-westward of 'Ayanat. Its fort is built on an elevation and its inhabitants are fisherfolk, pearl divers, and cultivators. Ras al Marrar is a low point, situated about 5 miles north-westward of Miyalu, from which rocks extend offshore for a distance of about 20 half a cable. Kangun {Lat. 27° 49' N., Long. 52° 04' E.), situated about 2 miles north-westward of Ras al Marrar, is an important town standing on a sandy beach; there is a tower at its northern end and a large date grove is situated about half a mile north-westward 25 of it. A few cattle and some vegetables might be obtained; the water in the wells is stated to be good. Anchorage may be obtained off Kangun in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 in l) at from one-half to three-quarters of a mile offshore; the anchorage is partially sheltered from the shamal which in this 30 locality blows from north-westward, but some swell rolls in from west-south-westward; it is exposed to the kaus. Banak, the northernmost village on the coast of Shibkuh, is situated about 3 miles north-westward of Kangun. COAST OF DASHTI.—Aspect. —From a position close westward 35 of Banak, the coast of the Persian district of Dashti trends westward for about 23 miles and thence continues north-westward for about 40 miles to Kalat, whence the coast of the sub-district of Tangistan extends north-north-westward for a further 30 miles to Halileh. The range of mountains in which is the Fall, see page 151, continues 40 north-westward and at distances of about 8 and 11 miles, respectively, from that landmark are two conspicuous castle-shaped mountains with almost vertical sides and projections resembling bastions; situated about 12 miles farther north-westward is a rounded mountain, about 4,000 feet (1219 m 2) high, on the sides of which streaks of 45 salt deposit glisten when the sun shines upon them; from this mountain, the range trends in a north-north-westerly direction. In the vicinity and north-westward of Kangun is a coastal range, for 2,000 to 3,000 feet (609 m 6 to 914 m 4) high, that appears at a distance to form part of the main range but which obscures the 50 latter from view when close inshore; the mountains forming it are rugged, precipitous, and of very irregular outline. A valley extends north-westward from the coast westward of Chart 748b.154 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2837h. Banak and separates the foregoing mountain ranges from a detached group of mountains between them and the sea. Jabal Direng is the summit of the detached group of mountains 5 and rises to an elevation of 3,270 feet (996 m 8), at its northern end, about 25 miles north-westward of Banak; according to the direction from which it is seen, the mountain appears either as one peak or surmounted by from three to five hummocks of equal height. On north-easterly bearings the hummocks are in line and a great bluff appears on the northern side of the mountain. See views D, F, H, and I on chart 2837b. Funnel hill, towards which the mountains forming the group decrease in elevation, is situated at the south-western end of the group about 13 miles south-south-eastward of the central summit 15 of Jabal Direng and about 3 miles inland; it is table-topped, about 800 feet (243 m 8) high, and on it is a small natural pillar that is a good landmark. Northward of this group of mountains lies an extensive low, swampy plain. 20 Coast.—Anchorage.— From Banak, the coast trends westward across the mouth of the valley and is low and sandy for about the first 7 miles. Bardistan, situated about 5 miles north-westward of Banak and about 2 miles inland, is a town at which there is a tall bad-gir, or 25 wind-tower, that is partly hidden by trees. It stands near a creek the mouth of which is situated about 2J miles south-eastward. During rains the creek becomes the mouth of the water-course that drains the valley. Daiyir [Lat. 27° 50' N., Long. 51° 55' E.) is a small town, 30 the inhabitants of which are chiefly cultivators, situated about 7 miles westward of Banak; in it is a square fort, with two towers, and also some round trees; eastward of the village is a large date grove. The Shaikh's house, a white two-storied building with a small flagstaff, stands near the fort. 35 A remarkable isolated rock of light grey colour, and from 60 to 80 feet (I8 m 3 to 24 m 4) in height, stands about one mile westward of the town and about three-quarters of a mile inland; it has the appearance of a square tower and can be identified from afar. Water, provisions in moderate quantities, and possibly a few cattle 40 may usually be obtained at Daiyir; vegetables are said to be scarce. Excellent anchorage, affording far better protection from the sham a 1 than that off Kangun, but exposed to the kaus, may be obtained off Daiyir in a depth of 4 fathoms (7^3), with the fort bearing 000 distant about half a mile; large vessels should anchor 45 farther out in depths of from 8 to 10 fathoms (14 m 6 to 18 m 3), mud. Landing is difficult unless the boat is able to cross a reef that extends from one to 2 cables offshore abreast Daiyir. At springs, the tidal streams attain a rate of from one to 2 knots at the anchorage off Daiyir. 50 A small rocky point, consisting of low cliffs, projects from the coast about 2h miles westward of Daiyir, and at a distance of about one cable off it are some sunken rocks; within these rocks, abreast the position in which was formerly the village of Auli, is a landing place near which latter is a spring of good water. In the vicinity Chart 748h.Chap. V.] COAST OF DASHTI 155 Chart 2837h. of the point, and for a distance of about 7 miles westward of it, the hills descend to the coast. Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0), at a distance of about half a mile off the foregoing point. 5 Batuneh is a small coastal village, situated about 8 miles westward of Daiyir, at which sheep, poultry, and vegetables might be ob tainable in small quantities. Anchorage off Batuneh is open both to the shamal and the kaus. Ras Umm al Kuram is situated about 10 miles westward of 10 Batuneh and thence the coast trends north-westward for about 27 miles to Kabgan at the mouth of Mund river. Between Batuneh and Kabgan there are several date groves on the mainland but no villages. This part of the mainland cannot be approached owing to the extensive shoals and swamps that lie off it. 15 Shoals, banks, and islands. —Jezirat Umm al Kuram, known to the natives as Qurma, is a low islet lying about one mile south- westward of Ras Umm al Kuram. Umm Sila is a low sandy islet lying about 4 miles north-westward of Jezirat Umm al Kuram, and about one mile offshore. 20 Nakhilu is a low islet lying about 5 miles westward of Jezirat Umm al Kuram; in the middle of the islet is the tomb of a shaikh, a square building of loose stones; a cairn, about 5 feet (l m 5) high, stands on the north-eastern extremity of the islet. From a position close off Nakhilu, some date groves on the coast of the mainland 25 are just visible. From Nakhilu [Lat. 27° 49' N., Long. 51° 28' E.), a shoal extends in a south-easterly direction for about 18 miles. Ras al Mutaf, situated about 11 miles south-eastward of Nakhilu, is the south-western extremity of the shoal, which appears to consist of sand over a rocky foundation; the shoal is almost dry for many 30 miles from its north-western end, but its eastern end is covered. When surveyed in 1821-9, the north-western extremity of the shoal lay about 3^ cables outside Nakhilu and Ras al Mutaf was situated 11 miles 139° from that islet; but, according to soundings obtained by H .M .S. Sphinx, in 1892 ,the shoal has altered and probably 35 extends farther, both westward and southward, than charted. At the time of the survey, the south-western side of the shoal was steep-to, there being depths of 10 fathoms (IS^) within a distance of about half a mile of it; on the southern side, the depths shoaled gradually from a distance of about 3 miles from it. The eastern end 40 of the shoal was then situated about 7 miles 169° from Batuneh and from it a flat, over which the depths were from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to 9 ni l), extended eastward and south-eastward for a distance of about 5 miles, with depths of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) at 7 miles from it, whence the depths increased gradually to 20 and 35 fathoms 45 (36 m 6 and 64 m 0). In 1912, H.M.S. Espiegle discovered a 2-fathom (3 m 7) patch in a position from which Funnel hill bore 348° distant 13| miles, which would appear to show that the shoal is extending southward in the vicinity; depths of 8 fathoms (14 m 6) were obtained close 50 southward of the 2-fathom (3 m 7) patch, A bank, over which there is a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6), with from 12 to 17 fathoms (21 I11 9 to 31 m l) round it, lies about 22 miles south-westward of Funnel hill. Chart 748b.156 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2837h. A depth of 9| fathoms (17 m 4) was reported, in 1930, in a position about 27 miles south-south-westward of Funnel hill. Shoal water, in which the bottom was plainly visible, was 5 reported, in 1917, in a position about 33 miles south-westward of Funnel hill. Kh5r Khan is a channel inside the shoals of which Ras al Mutaf [Lat. 28° 42' NLong. 51° 37' E.), is the south-western extremity; its principal entrance is northward of the eastern end of the shoals 10 and the depths in it are from 4 to 9 fathoms (7 m 3 to 16 m 5). The channel continues in a north-westerly direction for about 7 miles beyond Nakhilu islet but there is no outlet at its north-western end. Khor Khan is used by small native craft that are able to leave it by a channel, close northward of Nakhilu, in which there are 15 depths of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) at high water. The cairn on Nakilhu in line with the Shaikh's tomb lead through Khor Khan. Shoals extend from the mainland shore of Khor Khan for a distance of from 2 to 3 miles, but a channel, in which there is reported to be a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3), leads westward through them and passes 20 inside Jezirat Umm al Kuram. Jezi'rat Jabrin, known to the natives as Tahmadu and its south eastern extremity as Ras Tahmadu, extends north-westward for about 4J miles from a position about If miles in that direction from Nakhilu ; it is a low narrow strip of sand with tufts of grass upon 25 it; it is uninhabited, but is frequented by flamingoes, pelicans, and curlew. Between Ras Tahmadu and Nakhilu is the boat channel into Khor Khan. Eastward of Jezfrat Jabrin is an extensive swamp intersected by deep creeks, the mainland being distant about 5 miles; this swamp continues northward almost to Kabgan. 30 Anchorage .—Directions .—Tidal streams .—Anchorage may be obtained, by vessels with local knowledge, in depths of 4 or 5 fathoms (7 m 3 or 9 m l), off the eastern end of the shoal of which Ras al Mutaf is the south-western extremity, in a position from which Funnel hill bears 330 and Jabal Siri 'Ayanat 073°. This anchorage is &lt;35 sheltered from the shamal but exposed to the kaus. As there is no good shelter from the shamal between this anchorage and Bushire, more than 90 miles northward, it is resorted to by vessels caught by a north-westerly gale off that part of the coast. When rounding the shoal vessels should not get into depths less than from 11 to 12 fathoms (20^1 to 21^9); and at night, or in thick weather, it should not be approached into a depth less than 15 fathoms(27 m 4). By day, the discolouration which extends some miles off the shoal, into deep water, is a good guide. As the coast from Nakhilu almost to Kabgan is extremely low, 45 caution is necessary when in its vicinity, especially at night, or m thick weather, when the depths should not be shoaled to less than 14 fathoms (25 m 6). The tidal streams are said to set westward and eastward over the shoal, and south-westward of it they appear to set north-westward 50 and south-eastward. A perceptible indraught into the bay eastward of Ras al Mutaf has been observed on several occasions, during the south-east-going tidal stream. At springs these streams attain a rate of about 2 knots; both in the channels inside the shoals and along their outer edge they are said to run with strength.

Coast.—Anchorages.—Buoy. —Ras Jabrin, situated close north ward of the northern end of Jezirat Jabrin, to which it is almost connected, is the south-western extremity of the swamps which extend from the mainland and join those northward of the island. Ras al Khan {Lat. 28° 02' N., Long . 51° 20' E.), situated about 15 miles north-westward of Nakhilu, is the southern end of a very low sandy ridge that is almost covered at high water. The ridge and the coast northward of it, almost as far as Kabgan, project considerably from the coast farther northward and form the seaward edge of the swamps which probably constitute the delta of the Mund river and are part of the great valley between the coastal hills north ward of Kabgan and the mountains extending in that direction from Jabal Direng. Anchorage, offering but indifferent shelter from the shamal, may be obtained by small craft in a little bay, southward of Ras al Khan, in depths of from 2 to 2| fathoms (3 m 7 to 4 m 6). Khor Ziyarat is a small creek with low banks about 8 miles north ward of Ras al Khan; it can be entered by boats at high water, but the entrance, from which Jabal Direng bears 098°, is open north westward; there are depths of about 4 feet (l m 2) on the bar, and 9 feet (2 m 7) in the channel for about 2 miles within it. The creek is a mouth of the Mund river, the ancient Sitagon, which latter drains an extensive area and after rains discharges a large volume of water. Open anchorage may be obtained at a distance of about 1| miles off the entrance of Khor Ziyarat in a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), mud, whence the depths decrease gradually shoreward. From Khor Ziyarat, the coast trends north-north-westward and is swampy for a short distance after which it becomes sandy with small rocky points and is steep-to at a distance of about one cable offshore. Kabgan, situated 3 or 4 miles northward of Khor Ziyarat, is at the entrance of the northern mouth of the Mund river. Ziyarat is a small coastal village about 2 miles northward of Kabgan. Balangistan, situated about 3 miles northward of Ziyarat, is a small village at which there is a square tower. Lavar, situated about 2 miles northward of Balangistan, is a conspicuous village standing on the bluff of a sandy hill about 60 feet (18 m 3) high. In it are two square towers, the southern of which is a Customs-post and has a flagstaff. At Lavar is a rough break water, for the use of small boats; it dries out and should be ap proached with caution. When approaching the village from north westward, two conspicuous peaks, sickle-shaped with points opposed, will be seen. Anchorage may be obtained in a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), at about three-quarters of a mile offshore, with the sickle-shaped peaks bearing about 107°. A red conical buoy, with staff and globe topmark, is moored off Lavar, in a depth of about 17 fathoms (31 m l), to mark the anchorage. Bariku, Zirahak, Hadakuh, and Merreh, the last of which is not shown on the chart, are small villages situated on the coast in the order given between Lavar and Kalat. Chart 748b.158 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2837b. Kalat, situated about 6 miles northward of Lavar, is the northern most village in the district of Dashti. COAST OF TANGISTAN.—Aspect.— The coast of the Persian 5 sub-district of Tangistan extends in a north-north-westerly direction from a position close northward of Kalat for a distance of about 30 miles to Halileh. A range of coastal mountains, that rises a few miles northward of Khor Ziyarat, continues along the coast of Tangistan for about 20 24 miles northward of Kalat and then falls to the plain inland of Bushire. The plain between these hills and the sea is from one to 2 miles wide. Bu Riyal or the Asses' Ears, one of the summits in the coastal range, rises, to an elevation of about 2,500 feet (762 in 0), about 15 5 miles north-eastward of Kalat; it consists of two pinnacles, close together, with a smaller one northward of them, and is conspicuous. See views G and J on chart 2837b. There are other peaks in the coastal range, two of which, situated about 2 and 3 miles, respectively, northward of Bu Riyal, are higher 20 than that mountain and form a saddle or notch that may be seen on south-easterly bearings. From the rounded mountain north-westward of the Fall, see page 153, the main range of mountains trends north-north-westward. Kuh Khormuj (Lat. 28° 43' N., Long. 51° 30' E.), situated about 25 22 miles north-eastward of Bu Riyal, is one of the peaks in the main range; it is about 6,500 feet (1981^2) high and, except when close inshore, is visible over all parts of the coastal range; on north easterly bearings, it appears as a long convex ridge, but on east- south-easterly bearings the ridge is end on and the mountain then 30 appears as a fine peak with a long rounded slope on its northern side. See views G, J, and L on chart 2837a and view on chart 27. The tidal streams off this coast are weak and often imperceptible. Baraki villages .—Anchorages .—This is the collective name of the eight southernmost villages on the coast of Tangistan. 35 Karri, the southernmost is situated about one mile northward of Kalat; in it are two towers, the northern being round and the southern square; there also is a very conspicuous palm. Good but open anchorage may be obtained off Karri in a depth of 4 fathoms {7 m 3) at about 8 cables offshore. 40 Salim Abadeh, situated close northward of Karri, is a village that is easily identified by the very dark background which is peculiar to it, at its northern end is a date grove and at its southern end are a few conspicuous palms. A square tower and a conspicuous mosque stand about one mile northward of the village. 45 Bunju and Khur Shahabi are the next two villages. Omari, situated about 6 miles northward of Karri, has, near its centre, a conspicuous square tower; there is a fairly large date grove northward of the village. At the northern end of the village is a mosque which, though obscured from northward, shows up well SO from southward. Bulkhair lies in a small bay northward of 'Omari; there are several date tiees on either side of the village and a conspicuous round tower stands at its northern end. Chart 748b.Chap. V.] coast of tangistan 159 Chart 2837b. Anchorage may be obtained in the bay at Bulkhair, in a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), at about three-quarters of a mile off the village, Gahi, not shown on the chart but situated about one mile north ward of Bulkhair, is nearly surrounded by date trees; off it is a low sandy spit on which the sea always breaks; between Gahi and Bulkhair there is a conspicuous mosque. Rustami, situated about one mile northward of Gahi, is easily identified by a high round tower in the middle of the village. There is a conspicuous mosque about half-way between Rustami and Gahi. Landing can usually be effected at any of the Baraki villages; there are several small points which afford protection from north westerly winds. The Baraki villages should be approached with caution, as in some places depths less than those indicated on the chart have been found. Coast.—Shoal. —From Rustami, the coast of Tangistan trends northward for about 16 miles to the head of Halileh bay; at a distance of about 2 miles northward of Rustami there is a little cliff from a position about 2 miles northward of which low cliffs extend for some distance along the coast. Bashi, situated about 6 miles northward of Rustami, is a village at which there is a large round tower; near it is a date grove. In the vicinity of Bashi, the coastal hills trend inland falling to the plain behind Bushire some 10 miles northward. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2f fathoms (5 m 0), lies about 2 miles south-westward of Bashi. Nargis Zar and Dilbar, situated, respectively, about 3 and 6 miles northward of Bashi are moderate sized villages surrounded by date groves. Halileh bay is formed by a large indentation of the coast between Bashi {Lat. 28° 39' NLong. 51° 04' E.) and Ras Halileh, situated about 14 miles north-westward; its shores are low and sandy and over its greater part the depths are less than 2 fathoms (3 m 7), chiefly mud. Khor Khuvair is entered near the head of Halileh bay, about 9 miles northward of Bashi; it is a small creek the entrance of which dries; near it is a small fort and a date grove. At about 2 miles north-westward of Khor Khuvair is the mouth of a large creek that drains the Mashila; dry sands extend about one-quarter of a mile off the mouth of the creek, which latter nearly dries. The Mashila is a large salt-water swamp that connects the dry land on which stands Bushire to the great plain inland of that place. APPROACHES TO BUSHIRE.—Coast.—Anchorage. —From the mouth of the creek that drains the Mashila, the coast trends westward for about 4 miles to Ras Halileh; it consists of a ridge of sand some 5 feet (l m 5) high, that is covered with tufts of coarse grass and increases in width from about one-quarter of a cable at its eastern end. Ras Halileh is low, and from it a rocky spit extends south- westward for a distance of about 4 cables.

Anchorage. —•Anchorage is prohibited off Rishahr point between lines drawn 220° and 265° from the ruins of the white house on the point; on the latter bearing, the ruins and Imamzada are in alignment. 5 In 1911, H.M.S. Philomel anchored, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3'), at a distance of about 2 miles offshore westward of the telegraph buildings; during a shamal the ship dragged; whilst the north west-going tidal stream was running a very heavy sea got up and it became necessary to put to sea. 10 In 1908, however, H.M.S. Proserpine anchored near the same place and rode out a shamal, which lasted for three days, without dragging. Indifferent landing, in calm weather, may be obtained under the ruins of the white house; but with any wind or swell it becomes 15 impracticable. Coast. —From Rishahr point, the coast trends north-north-west ward for about 1| miles to Ras ash Shaghab, about half a mile southward of which latter, and close to the coast, is a small clump of date trees in which is a well. 20 Ras ash Shaghab [Lat. 28° 56' N., Long. 50° 48' E.) is the westernmost part of a low, wide, sandy, rounded projection whence the coast trends northward for about 3| miles and is low and sandy ; thence cliffs, about 15 feet (4 m 6) high, continue northward for about half a mile to the outskirts of Bushire town, see page 166. From 25 Rishahr point to the town, the coast is fringed by a reef extending from it for from one to cables; in many places, rocky boulders, drying about 3 feet (0 m 9), lie on the outer edge of the reef. Mufka'eh, situated on the coast about 2 miles southward of Bushire, is a little fishing village at which a break in coastal reef forms a 30 small boat harbour. A tower, intended as a lighthouse but never used as such, stands at a short distance northward of the village. A building, formerly the German Consulate, with high arched windows, two towers, and a flagstaff between them, stands at the southern end of Mufka'eh village and is conspicuous. 35 Two W/T masts, each 70 feet (21 m 3) in height and from the top of each of which a light is occasionally exhibited, have been erected at a short distance south-eastward of the former German Consulate. A building, formerly the Russian Consulate, is situated on the coast about 1| miles northward of Mufka'eh and has also two towers; 40 it is conspicuous and is surrounded by an extensive wall. Jezirat Sheikh Saad, on the eastern side of Bushire harbour, extends in a northerly direction for about 4 miles from a position about 2 miles east-north-eastward of Bushire. With the exception of a narrow strip along its western and northern coasts, the island is 45 low and swampy. The northern extremity of the island is rocky and about 10 feet (3 m 0) high; on it are a large village and a small tower, about 50 feet (15 m 2) high. A conspicuous solitary palm stands about 2| miles southward of the tower. Bar Abbasak, the quarantine station, is situated at the southern 50 end of Jezirat Sheikh Saad. Chart 2837b. Shif, in the district of Angali, is situated about 1| miles eastward of the tower on Jezirat Sheikh Saad; it is a rocky point, about Chart 748b. 5400 Fi 162 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 2837b. 25 feet (7 m 6) high on which is a small building. Eastward of Shif, the country is low, barren, and in places swampy for some miles; there are extensive swamps northward of it towards the 5 Rud Hilleh district. Tahima point is situated about If miles north-north-westward of the northern end of Jezi'rat Sheikh Saad; it is a small sandy projection, from which rocks extend for some distance, that is occasionally used as a landing place at high water. 10 Ras ash Shatt is situated about 9 miles westward of Tahima point and 11 miles north-westward of Bushire town. The northern side of the harbour, between Tahima point and Ras ash Shatt, is composed of extensive mud banks intersected by numerous large and deep creeks the entrances of which are shallow; on the mud banks are 15 a number of drying sand knolls. Ras ash Shatt is a narrow strip of sand, scarcely above water, eastward of which a swamp extends for many miles; the swamp is intersected by numerous creeks which are fairly deep inside but have depths of about 2 feet (0 m 6), only, at their mouths. The 20 point, and the banks off it, afford shelter to Bushire harbour, from the shamal. Chart 27. Shoals.—Banks. —In the approaches to Bushire, the 5-fathom (9 m l) line trends in a general north-north-westerly direction from 25 a position about 2J miles south-westward of Rishahr point to a position about the same distance south-westward of Ras ash Shatt. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms {5 m 5), lies in the prohibited anchorage, about one mile west-south-westward of Rishahr point. 30 A small shoal, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) was reported by H.M.S. Triad, in 1930, to lie, close northward of the prohibited anchorage, in a position about 7 cables westward of Rishahr point. Northward of Ras ash Shaghab {Lat. 28° 55' NLong. 50° 48' E.), 35 the 3-fathom {5 m 5) line lies from one to If miles eastward of the 5-fathom (9 m l) line; but off that point a bight, in which the depths are from 3f to 3j fathoms (6 m 9 to 5 m 9), runs in parallel with the coast to a position about 6 cables north-westward of Mufka'eh. Two small detached 2-fathom patches lie about H miles 40 westward of Bushire town. A flat, over which the depths are less than 2 fathoms (3 m 7), extends northward and north-westward from Bushire town and the coast in its vicinity, and westward from Jezirat Sheikh Saad. On this flat are a number of sand banks that dry from one to 3 feet {0 m 3 45 to 0 m 9) in patches. Rakat as Safli, on the above fiat, extends north-westward from Bushire town for about one mile; it dries about 2 feet {0 m 6) in patches, and through it are small channels that are used at high water by boats with local knowledge as a short cut between vessels 50 in the outer anchorage and the quay in Khor Sultani on the eastern side of Bushire town. Ras al Marg, the north-western extremity of the flats, is situated about 2 miles north-westward of the northern end of Bushire town, and the depths over it are from 2 to 5 feet (0 m 6 to l m 5); it is steep-to Charts 2837b, 748b.Chap. V.] BUSHIRE 163 Chart 27. on its north-western side. In 1916, the shoal was reported to be extending westward. Lakfa sands, over which the depths are from 2 to 3 feet (0 m 6 to 0 m 9) extend eastward from Ras al Marg for about 1J miles. The 5 sea seldom breaks on Lakfa sands, except at very low water or during strong winds. Ras al Jabri is the eastern extremity of Lakfa sands. Rakat al Aali, over which the depths are less than 2 fathoms (S 01 ?), is the southern extremity of an extensive flat that projects in a southerly direction from the coast eastward of Ras ash Shatt to a position nearly 3 miles west-north-westward of the northern end of Bush ire town. In depths less than 1| fathoms (2 m 7), the bottom is of hard sand; in depths greater than 1| fathoms (2 IIl 7), the bottom is of sand and 15 mud, and is softer. Lights.—Buoyage. —Two lights, disposed vertically, are ex hibited at elevations, respectively, of 72 and 54 feet (21 m 9 and 16 m 5), from a mast erected close north-westward of the British Residency in Bushire town. 20 A light-buoy, painted red with a black conical cage, having a white horizontal band, as topmark and exhibiting a white flashing light every ten seconds, is moored in the outer anchorage in a position about 4 J miles west-south-westward of the British Residency in Bushire town. 25 A light-buoy, painted red with a black conical cage as topmark and exhibiting a red flashing light every ten seconds is moored on the south-eastern side of Rakat al Aali about 2| miles north-westward of the British Residency in Bushire town. A black can buoy, with a staff as topmark, is moored off the north- 30 western side of Ras al Marg. The buoys at Bushire cannot be relied on. Anchorage.—Depths .—Anchorage is prohibited within a distance of 3 cables of the outer light-buoy. Vessels whose draught will not permit them to enter the inner 35 anchorage, should anchor in a depth of from 4J to 5 fathoms (7 m 8 to 9 m l), in the vicinity of the outer light-buoy, but clear and preferably southward of the prohibited anchorage; this anchorage is exposed both to the shamal and the kaus; sailing boats can fetch off with the prevailing winds. 40 In fine weather, a small steam vessel, making a short stay, may anchor, in a depth of 2J fathoms (4 m l), with the flagstaff of the British Residency in Bushire bearing 045°, distant about one mile. Landing can then be effected near the flagstaff. Khor Deira, the native name of the harbour or inner anchorage, 45 is a bight in the flats, from 6| to 10 cables wide, that extends in a north-easterly direction for about 3 miles between Rakat al Aali {Lat. 29° 01' NLong. 50° 47' E.) and Ras al Marg. The depths in the approach are from 21 to 2f fathoms (4 m l to 5 m 0), and the bottom is everywhere soft; but in the middle of the bight the depths 50 increase to from 3J to 3| fathoms (5 m 9 to 6 m 4), mud and good holding ground. Steam vessels drawing up to 15 feet (4 m 6) may enter the anchorage at any state of the tide unless the shamal is blowing, and steam vessels of 20 feet (6 m l) draught can usually enter at high Charts 2837b, 748b.164 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Chart 27. water. In the anchorage, the farther north-eastward the better is the shelter from the shamal. A good position in which to anchor is, in a depth of about 3| fathoms with the flagstaff of the 5 late residence of the Persian Governor, on the eastern side of Bushire town, bearing 149°, and the conspicuous solitary palm northward of Bar Abbasak bearing 090°. Bandar al Ghawi, south-eastward of Ras al Jabri, is the local name of the anchorage, in depths of from one to 1J fathoms (l m 8 10 to 2 m 3), used by small native craft and sheltered by Lakfa sands. {Lat. 29° 01' NLong. 50° 50' E.) From the inner anchorage, a comparatively deep but narrow channel trends northward and eastward, passing about one mile westward of Jezi'rat Sheikh Saad and running round its northern 15 end. at a distance of about one-quarter of a cable offshore. The large mudflats on the northern side of the channel uncover. This channel passes about half a mile southward of Shif, towards which a branch extends with a depth in it of 3| feet (l m l) ; the branch ends in a mud flat about 2 cables from Shif; dhows sail in at high 20 water and their cargoes are carried across the flat. Landing is effected in Khor Sultani, where a fairly good quay has been built with a depth alongside it of about 6 feet (l m 8). A small hand crane is available. Boats are allowed to go alongside or leave during daylight; at other times special permission must 26 be obtained from the Customs passport department. Charts 27, and 2837b. Directions.—Pilot. —Vessels drawing more than 15 feet (4 m 6) must await the rise of the tide. Vessels requiring the pilot, should await his arrival in the outer 30 anchorage. Weather permitting, he will always come off, if required. In clear weather, the position of the vessel may be determined at some distance from the port by bearings of Gisakan bluff, Kuh Khormuj, or Bu Riyal, see pages 243 and 158, and view on chart 35 27, and views G, J, K, and L on chart 2837b. Approaching from south-eastward, vessels should steer to pass about 6 miles off Ras Halileh, and thence continue north-westward in depths not less than 6 fathoms (ll™*)), anchoring according to draught southward of the light-buoy at the outer anchorage. From 40 south-westward and in depths of about 20 fathoms (36 m 6), Imamzada mosque, and the British Country Residency and telegraph buildings at Rishahr will be the first objects sighted, showing white, especially in the afternoon sun. The depths decrease regularly as the coast is approached. Small vessels may keep near the coast, according 45 to draught. At night, vessels should steer north-westward in depths not less than 10 fathoms (18 m 3) and make the lights at the British Residency in Bushire and that of the light-buoy at the outer anchorage. If in doubt as to the position, vessels may anchor anywhere in a con- 50 venient depth and await daylight. Approaching from northward, vessels, when passing Ras ash Shatt, should not get into depths less than 10 fathoms (18 m 3) and should keep in that depth until the light-buoy marking the outer anchorage is sighted. Chart 748b.[Chap,! Chap. V.] bushire 165 Charts 27 and 2837b. At night the lights at the British Residency at Bushire will not be sighted until a little southward of Ras ash Shatt. The former German and Russian Consulates, the flagstaff of the British Residency in Bushire, the solitary palm northward of Bar 5 Abbasak [Lat. 29° 01' NLong. 50° 52' E.) and the village at the northern end of Jezirat Sheikh Saad are good marks by which to fix the position of the vessel when entering the inner anchorage. From the outer anchorage, vessels may approach with the flagstaff of the British Residency at Bushire bearing 076°; when the former 10 German Consulate bears 135°, course should be altered to 000°; and when the Residency flagstaff bears 108°, vessels should steer 028° to the anchorage, passing eastward of the inner light-buoy. The least depth by this route is 2| fathoms (4 m 6). Mail steamers approach with the Residency flagstaff bearing 15 081° until the former German Consulate bears 138°, and then steer 017° to the anchorage; the least depth by this route is 2J fathoms (4 m l). From westward it may be convenient to approach with the Residency flagstaff bearing 103° until the former German Consulate 20 bears 149°, and then steer 028° to the anchorage; the least depth by this route is 2| fathoms (4 m l). Approaching from southward, a vessel may pass about one mile off Ras ash Shaghab and steer 359° until the Residency flagstaff bears 108°, thence steering 028° to the anchorage; the least depth 25 by this route is 2|~ fathoms (4 m 6). Tidal streams. —In the offing, the tidal streams set up and down the coast, but are weak. In the entrance of the harbour the tidal streams set northward and southward; near Rakat as Safli, they set eastward and westward 30 across the shoals at the mouth of Khor Sultani. In the inner anchorage the tidal streams set from north-north- eastward to east-north-eastward, and from south-south-westward to west-south-westward; at spring tides they attain a rate of one knot, and at neaps, from one-half to one-quarter of a knot. North- 35 ward and eastward of the inner anchorage, the tidal streams over the flats are weak. In Khor Sultani, the tidal streams are very strong off the town, as are they round the northern end of Jezirat Sheikh Saad. The July spring tide is the highest in the year. 40 The winds have considerable effect on the tidal streams; the shamal causes the streams to turn later and lowers the general level, sometimes as much as one foot (O^); the kaus, on the other hand, raises the general level. In summer the day tides are higher than the night tides; in 45 winter the reverse is the case. At all times the rise of the lower tide is very small. Khor Sultani.—Buoy.— This large creek, with a shallow bar at its mouth, runs in south-eastward past the eastern side of Bushire town and affords access to the quay. 50 From the northern end of the town, the south-western shore of the creek trends south-eastward for about 2 miles to Ras Fudar, which latter is about 30 feet (9 m l) high; thence it trends south- south-eastward for nearly 5 miles to a low point; between the Chart 748b.166 PERSIAN GULF—NORTH-EASTERN SIDE [Chap. V. Charts 27 and 2837h. creek and the rising ground towards Imamzada are groves of date trees and cultivated land. Caravans cross the Mashila, see page 159, which is there from 5 3 to 4 miles wide, about one mile northward of the low point, Tangak village, in which is a small fort, is situated at a short distance southward of the low point and thence the edge of the Mashila trends southward. Alafdan {Lat. 29° 00' NLong. 50° 50' E.) is the north-western 10 extremity of an extensive sand and mud flat south-westward of Jezirat Sheikh Saad; it forms the north-eastern side of the entrance of Khor Sultani and its north-western extremity is situated about 8| cables northward of the northern end of Bushire town. . A black buoy, which cannot, however, be relied upon, marks 15 the eastern side of Alafdan in a position about 4| cables north- north-west ward of the northern end of Bushire town. Muharrak island, north-eastward of Ras Fudar, is swampy and on its south-western end, distant about 4 cables from that point, are some fishermen's huts; thence the island extends north-eastward 20 towards the southern end of Jezirat Sheikh Saad and is nowhere more than about 3 feet (0 m 9) high; most of the island covers at high water spring tides; that part of the flat extending from Jezirat Sheikh Saad which lies northward of Muharrak island is rocky. Between the south-western end of Muharrak island and Ras Fudar, 25 Kh5r Sultani bifurcates, the principal branch, Kh5r Lashkari, running in a north-easterly direction, southward of that island and Jezirat Sheikh Saad, and the other, Khor Pooda, running south eastward through a sandy plain that covers at high water springs for many miles. 30 Khor Sultani is approached, across the great flat southward of Lakfa sands, in depths of from about three-quarters of a fathom to one fathom (l m 4 to l m 8). In 1920, the approach was made, either by Khor Bahrani southward of Ras al Marg, or northward, eastward, and south-eastward round Lakfa sands. Bagalas drawing up to 35 10 feet (3 m 0) use these passages, but local knowledge is necessary. As there is usually a confused sea on the bar, boats drawing more than 3 feet (0 m 9) should be cautious of entering within two hours of low water. Abreast Alafdan, the entrance is about half a mile wide with depths in it of from one to 1| fathoms (l m 8 to 2 m 3); 40 abreast the town, it is about one cable wide with depths of from 4 to 7 fathoms (7 m 3 to 12 m 8), hard bottom. Bushire.— This, the principal seaport of Persia, is situated on a rocky ridge that does not exceed 40 feet (12 m 2) in elevation. It is poorly built, and most of the streets are narrow. See view on 45 chart 27. As far as Sangi, a village situated about one mile southward of the town, the ground is swampy, and, with the exception of a narrow strip along the western coast, it covers at very high water. The land rises in a gradual slope to Imamzada village, and is partially 50 cultivated; in that direction there are also several small hamlets, and many wells. Bushire [Lat. 29° 59' NLong. 50° 50' E.) is the administrative headquarters of the Persian province of the Gulf ports, Dashti and Dashtistan; and the Governor resides about 3 miles southward Chart 748b.■.i, ' rrr-. f?4 Chap. V.] bushire 167 Chart 27. of the town; his offices are in one of the larger houses on the sea wall on the west side of the town. There is a small garrison. The people are occupied in seafaring, agriculture, and trade. There are a number of European inhabitants, and there are small Armenian 5 and Roman Catholic churches in the town. Fresh provisions may be procured, but notice of requirements is necessary. Vegetables are always scarce. Bushire is the headquarters of the British Political Resident in the Persian gulf. The town Residency, near which is a flagstaff, 10 is a large building at its south-western corner. The Political Resident also performs the duties of British Consul- General, and a Vice-Consul of the Levant Consular Service is included in his staff. For Meteorological tables, see page 285. 15 Quarantine. —Plague first appeared in Bushire in 1910, and it was followed by severe outbreaks in 1911, and 1912; it re-appeared in a very mild form in 1913, and again in 1916 since when there have been no further outbreaks. The town is otherwise healthy, especially during the hot summer. 20 The Quarantine regulations are very strict and the authorities enforce all penalties. The Quarantine station is at Bar Abbasak. Passengers less than five days out of Bombay, or other infected ports are landed there. Trade. —Bushire is the port and terminus for the .great and ancient 25 caravan route that runs through Kazurun to Shiraz and Isfahan and thence on to Tehran. A portion of the supplies and stocks at Bushire is required for consumption in the town and its vicinity; but the larger part is intended to supply the great centres of Shiraz and Isfahan which are, respectively, the capitals of provinces. 30 The trade of the port has latterly tended to decrease as the result of the opening up of the Khorramabad route to the interior, via Ahwaz, and a further decline is anticipated on the completion of Bandar Shapur. Recent years have seen the decline of animal transport, and the bulk of both imports and exports is now 35 transported by lorry. The distance to Shiraz is about 170 miles. The chief exports are opium, almonds and pistachios, gum, wool, carpets, skins, and intestines. The chief imports are sugar, tea, cotton piece goods, motor lorries, cars and accessories. 40 Communications. —There is a post and telegraph office at Bushire {Lat. 29° 59' N., Long. 50° 50' E.). Cable communication is maintained with all parts, cables running to Basra, Hen jam, and Jask. For steamship communications, see page 28. For aircraft communications, see page 29. For W/T communications, see page 29. Charts 2837b, 748b. 45168 CHAPTER VI PERSIAN GULF, SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE—COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN, AND EASTERN SIDE OF QATAR—RAS ASH SHA'AM TO RAS RAKAN. Chart 2837a. COAST.—General remarks. —The eastern portion of the coast of Trucial 'Oman trends in a general south-westerly direction from Ras ash Sha'am, see page 99, for about 133 miles to Abu 5 Dhabi {Lat. 24° 29' N., Long 54° 22' E.), and is throughout low and sandy; but the mountains of the Ruus al Jabal promontory are visible in clear weather until past Dabai, situated about 64 miles south-westward of Ras ash Sha'am. This coast is remarkable for the high degree of refraction or mirage that is frequently 10 experienced, especially in the early morning, when its features become greatly distorted, villages sometimes appearing as clumps of rounded trees, and small uncharted hillocks or dunes as hills of considerable height. The towns are all very similar in appearance and are situated 15 near the entrances of khors or salt-water creeks, of which there are many along the coast, often connected to one another or forming large backwaters in which native craft lie. Everything connected with these places seems to indicate a state of decay. The similarity of appearance makes it difficult to distinguish one 20 town from another; for this reason, a somewhat detailed description of any peculiarity in the appearance of each is given. Cattle and vegetables can usually be obtained at most places; the beef is often very good and much better than the mutton; Capital mullet are caught in all the khors, and fish, generally, is 25 plentiful. Water is scarce in quantity and indifferent in quality, especially southward of Dabai; in most cases it is obtained from shallow wells dug in the sand. The Great Pearl bank, which includes the whole of the area on the Arabian side of the Persian gulf southward and south-westward 39 of the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line, begins about 60 miles south-westward of Ras ash Sha'am, see page 178. Anchorage. —The whole of the eastern portion of the coast of Trucial 'Oman is open from south-west, through north-west, to north-east, and the bottom is in many places hard, the holding 35 ground, in consequence, being bad. On the approach of a winter shamdl vessels should weigh, and sailing vessels should stand off on the port tack as that wind blows from about west -north-westward Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN 169 Chart 2837a. or even more westward. Vessels should anchor farther offshore in winter than in summer. Tidal streams .—The tidal streams off the coast set south- westward and north-eastward at a rate of about one knot. 5 Chart 753. Coast. —From Ras ash Sha'am, see page 99, the coast of Trucial 'Oman trends southward for about 2 miles to Sha'am; it is fringed, to a distance of about one-quarter of a mile offshore, by a shoal, over which the depths are from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 5), and is 10 low and sandy, with a plain, from one to 1| miles wide, between it and the mountains of Ruus al Jabal; the plain is partly cultivated, there being in it a number of date groves and vegetable gardens, and some wells of good water. Sha'am {Lat. 26° 01' N., Long. 56° 05' E.) is the first town on 15 this coast and is inhabited by fisherfolk and cultivators. From Sha'am the coast trends south-south-westward for about 8| miles to Rams and continues low with high mountains in the background. The coastal bank, over which the depths are from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 5), extends off this part of the coast for 20 from about 2 cables to one mile. A small ruined tower stands on a hillock, about 50 feet (15 m 2) high, about one mile southward of Sha'am; from southward the hillock appears to have a peaked summit. Hanna, situated about 4 miles southward of Sha'am, is a village of 25 mud huts on the northern side of a creek that may be entered by boats at high water. Whereas the coast northward of Ras ash Sha'am is comparatively steep-to, that south-westward of it is not so, depths of 10 and 20 fathoms (18 m 3 and 36 m 6), respectively, being found at distances of 30 half a mile and 3 miles westward of Sha'am. The bottom, generally, is of sand. Rams is a small town at which there is a fort, and is situated in a date grove; its position may be identified from seaward by a tower showing above the tree-tops; it stands on the southern side 35 of a creek, the entrance of which nearly dries. In 1922, it was reported that the depths off Rams are less than charted. Zai is a small hill-fort situated about 2 miles east-north-eastward of Rams; it has a square tower at either end but, being of dark colour, it does not show up well against the mountains behind it. 40 At a distance of about 1-| miles southward of Rams is the mouth of a small creek that trends southward and runs into Khor Khaimah. The coast in the vicinity is swampy but at a short distance from it are date groves that extend far inland and continue southward, along the eastern side of Khor Khaimah. 45 Chart 2837a, plan of Ras al Khaimah. Ras al Khaimah. —This is a low sand spit that extends, parallel with the coast, for a distance of about 3| miles in a north-easterly direction, to a position about the same distance south-westward of Rams, and encloses a shallow lagoon. 50 The town, situated at the south-western end of the spit, consists chiefly of stone buildings; some square buildings, higher than the others, are the Shaikh's residences; on one corner of the highest Charts 753, 2837a, 748b. 54OO F*270 PERSIAN gulf- 1 — SOOTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2837a, plan of Ras al Khaimah. is a little dome, that attains a height of about 60 feet (18 m 3); there is a high building farther northward from which a flag is flown, and at the northern end of the town is a white round tower. 5 A fort with two square towers, see view facing this page, stands on the wall built across the peninsula at the southern end of the town, and near it is a large and conspicuous tree. A detached tower stands about 4 cables south-westward of the fort, and another one, about one mile farther south-westward, 10 near the foot of some red sandhills. A white circular tower {Lat. 25° 46' N., Long. 55° 57' E.) stands on the northern summit of these hills/at an elevation of about 80 feet (24 m 4), in a position about 2 miles southward of the fort. In the neighbourhood of Ras al Khaimah, the plain is about 15 6 miles wide, but its width increases rapidly southward, the coast trending south-westward, so that from northward the town appears to stand at the spot where the mountains end. The red sand hills trend south-westward for some 12 miles and are about 130 feet (39 m 6) high; from westward their northern end 20 affords a guide to the locality. The tower shown on the plan on chart 2837a at their south-western end is small and inconspicuous; it can only be seen from south-westward. Khor Khaimah is entered at the northern end of the sand spit and should be approached from north-eastward keeping close to 25 the coast. There is a depth of 2 feet (0 m 6) in the entrance; inside the khor there are depths of 9 feet (2 m 7) as far as the town, close behind which native boats lie. There are two low islets in the khor abreast the town; on one of them is a small fishing village. The towers shown on the plan on chart 2837a on the eastern side 30 of the lagoon are obscured by trees and are scarcely visible from seaward. Cattle, vegetables, and fruit are obtainable; but the supply of water is uncertain. Anchorage.—Shoals. —A good berth is in a depth of 5| fathoms 35 (10 m l) with the fort at Ras al Khaimah bearing 138°, distant about 3| miles. Small vessels anchor in a depth of 4^ fathoms (7 m 8) with the fort bearing 1^3°, distant about 19 cables. The holding ground is good, and it is considered locally that there is not so much sea at this anchorage during a shamal as there is at other places 40 in the vicinity. Caution is necessary, however, when approaching the anchorage for the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies from to 5 miles offshore, and close within it are patches over which the depths are from 2| to 3 fathoms (4 m 6 to 5 m 5). The 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies from 1^ to 2| 45 miles offshore, and a sand knoll, over which the depth is less than 6 feet (l m 8), lies about one mile north-westward of the fort. Chart 753. Coast. —Jezfrat al Hamra is an island formed by an inlet, about 10 miles south-westward of Khaimah, on it is the town of the same 50 name. At the town is a fort that has several towers and in which are a few round trees; close to the fort is a high square tower with two rows of windows, and a high slender tower stands at the western end of the town. There are no date groves; but a solitary con spicuous palm grows near a tower at the eastern end of the town. Charts 2S37a, 748b.Chap. VI.] coast of trucial 'oman 171 Chart 753. The range of reddish sandhills, mentioned on page 170, ends about 3 miles southward of the town. The 3 and 10-fathom (5 m 5 and 18 m 3) lines lie, respectively, about half a mile and 4 miles off the town; but northward of it, the 5 5-fathom (Q 111 !) line is about 5 miles offshore, and close within it are several patches over which the depths are from 2| to 3| fathoms to 6 m 4). The locality has not been thoroughly examined; in most places the bottom is of sand. Ras Abu Ahmad, situated about three-quarters of a mile north- 10 eastward of the town, is a low sandy point at the entrance of the inlet forming Jezirat al Hamra. From the point, the inlet trends south-westward between the town and the strip of sandy beach forming the mainland; there are depths of from 2 to 3 feet (0 m 6 to 0 m 9) in the entrance, and from 7 to 8 feet (2 m l to 2 m 4) 15 inside; but off the town the inlet is shallow. From Jezirat al Hamra (Lat. 25° 43'N., Long. 55° 48' E.), the coast trends south-westward for about 14 miles to the point on which stands Umm al Qaiwain. A reef, nearly dry in places and said to be extending seaward, 20 fringes the coa^t for a distance of from one to 1| miles offshore, and by day shows up well. At a distance of about 10 miles south- westward of Jezirat al Hamra, the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies nearly 3 miles offshore, with depths of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) close inside it. This part of the coast, also, has not been thoroughly examined. 25 Khor-al-Baidhah, the entrance of which is situated about 7 miles south-westward of Jezirat al Hamra, trends south-westward and affords communication with the inlet at Umm al Qaiwain, but it is only available to small boats with local knowledge. Near the middle of the seaward side of the island formed by Khor-al- 30 Baidhah is a small fort which shows up well at a distance; it has a double tower, and westward of it is a date grove. Umm al Qaiwain. —The point of this name is low and sandy but has a rocky beach; at about 1| miles southward of it is a date grove. From the point the coast trends eastward for nearly one 35 mile to an inlet that trends southward and westward forming a peninsula on which stands the town. Umm al Qaiwain is an independent and thriving town in the middle of which stands the Shaikh's fort; it is tolerably clean and well built and sends a number of boats to the pearl fishery. There are 40 six or eight detached towers in the town which, at a distance of about 10 miles, appear to stand in the sea; one of the towers, on which is a flagstaff, is much higher and larger than the others and, when the latter are below the horizon, has the appearance of a boat; this tower, together with two others, stands on the point, and the 45 three form part of a wall built across the isthmus. The inlet is approached from a position about 2 miles north- north-eastward of Umm al Qaiwain point and has a depth of about 2 feet (0 m 6) in its entrance. A reef of sand and rocks extends in a northerly direction from the western entrance point of the inlet and 50 fringes the eastern side of the approach to it. The entrance of the inlet is marked by a ruined mosque with a round kiln-shaped tower close to it; a tower stands, about one quarter of a mile eastward of the town, on the western side of the entrance. Charts 2837a, 748b.172 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 753. At the town, the inlet is about 3 cables wide with depths in it of from 6 to 8 fathoms to 14 m 6); it then splits up into several branches, the main one trending southward. Behind the town, 5 where the native boats lie, there are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5). The inlet is an extensive backwater in which are several low islets. Anchorage.—Depths. —North-westward of Umm al Qaiwain point, the depths decrease regularly to 5 fathoms (9 m l) at about one mile offshore. Northward and north-eastward of the point 10 the 5-fathom (9 m l) line is about 2| miles offshore, and there the depths decrease rapidly from 5 to 2 or 3 fathoms (9 m l to 3 in 7 or 5 m 5), Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 6 to 7 fathoms (ll m O to 12 m 8), with the large tower on the point bearing between 134° and 150°, distant from half a mile to one mile; but in winter 15 vessels should anchor farther out in a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6). Landing, except in fine weather, is bad; but it may be effected within the reef, which latter has depths over it, in places, of 3 feet (0 m 9). Coast.—Anchorage. —From Umm al Qaiwain point, the coast 20 trends south-south-westward for about 7 miles to Al Hamriyah and thence continues in the same direction for about 5 miles to Al 'Ajman; it is low and sandy, and in the neighbourhood of the various villages is sparsely covered with date palms. The depths offshore are regular and the bottom is rocky; until 25 about 2 miles from Al 'Ajman, depths of 5 or 6 fathoms (9 m l to ll m 0) will be found about one mile offshore. Vessels should not anchor close inshore, for there there is a liability of losing an anchor. Al Hamriyah {Lat. 25° 29'N., Long. 55° 31' E.) is a small 30 place at which there is a fort with five large towers, one of which latter was, in 1926, in a ruinous condition ; the fort, in 1931, formed a conspicuous landmark from seaward; there are also two detached towers, one behind the village and the other near the coast north- north-eastward of it; near the north-eastern end of the village 35 is a large date grove. In 1922, H.M.S. Cyclamen anchored, in a depth of 4J fathoms (7 m 8), sand, at about half a mile offshore; and, in 1931, H .M .S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), sand, with the fort bearing 140°, distant 9 cables. 40 Landing may be effected in a creek on the southern side of Al Hamriyah; but there is a bar at its entrance. Al 'Ajman.—Shoals. —This town, at which there is a fort, with towers, is situated on the south-eastern side of an inlet. The fort is small but high, and that tower from which the flag is flown 45 is much higher than the others, being visible at a distance of about 12 miles, see view facing page 170. Water is obtained from wells, sunk about one mile south-westward of the town, and is bad. A shoal, over which the depths are from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 5), extends offshore for a distance of about 1^ miles, and depths 50 of 5 fathoms (9 m l) were found by H.M.S. Hyacinth, in 1910, about 2f miles north-westward of the fort. In 1931, H.M.S. Hastings reported that this 5-fathom (9 m l) shoal appeared to be extending northward. In 1927, a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) was found nearly 2 miles northward of the fort. The depths in the locality are irregular. Charts 2837a, 748b.Chap. VI.] COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN 173 Chart 753. and the coast should not be approached at night into depths less t H 1 fathoms (18 m 3), which latter will be found about 4 miles offshore. Anchorage off A1 Ajman is bad, for the bottom is rocky. 5 eas i es f of access of any on this coast and is available to dhows. The entrance is north-westward of the fort, between the extremities of two sand spits lying about 2| cables' offshore; the bar, which is of sand, has a depth of 2 feet (0 m 6) over it. Within ^ a 1 , 6 ^ a . r are ^ wo c f ianne l s . the one trending south-westward past 10 Al Ajman, and the other, extending in an east-north-easterly direction for about half a mile into Kh5r Zora. The latter channel, in which the depths are from 6 to 9 feet (l m 8 to 2 m 7), extends close along the southern side of the north-eastern entrance point and then opens out into drying lagoons forming Kh5r Zora. Off the 15 town, there are depths, in the inlet, of 2 fathoms (3^7). Coast. From Al Ajman the coast trends in a south-westerly direction for about 4 miles to ^harjeth, and. the village of Al Ha.ira.li lies about midway between those two places. The 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies about half a mile off this part of 20 the coast. A date grove extends for a distance of about one mile south- westward from Al 'Ajman; south-westward of the date grove, as far as Al Hairah, there is a clear uncultivated space; between Al Hairah and Sharjah the palm groves are continuous. 25 At Al Hairah there are two detached towers and a very small inlet. There are several other villages between Al 'Ajman and Sharjah. Sharjah.— This, the largest and most important town in Trucial Oman, extends for a distance of about miles along the eastern 30 bank of a creek that trends in a south-westerly direction parallel with the coast; in it are several detached towers of unequal height and a fort. The Shaikh's residence is a large white two-storied building; his flag is flown from the eastern tower of the fort which is long and low and is situated about one cable northward of his 35 house. The most conspicuous object in the town is, however, a dark tower, standing about 2| cables southward of the fort; a large proportion of the houses of Sharjah are built of stone. Great Britain is represented by an Arab who is the agent of the Political Resident in the Persian gulf; his house is north-eastward 40 of the fort, and from its roof the Union flag is flown whei any of H.M. Ships are lying at anchor off the town. Liyah village {Lat. 25° 22'N., Long. 55° 24' E.), situated on the opposite side of the creek and between Sharjah and the sea is a large suburb of the latter place consisting entirely of mat huts; 45 a high tower stands at the southern end of Liyah village and between the village and the town are many square buildings which, from seaward, appear to form part of the latter, as do the villages north ward of the town. At the southern end of Sharjah, some white rocky rising ground 50 from 30 to 40 feet (9 m l to 12^2) high, has a bluff on its southern side; a small square tower, close to the end of the bluff, serves to identify it easily. The beach in front of Liyah village is of white sand but the bluff and Liyah point, a small rocky projection, which Charts 2837a, 748h.174 persian gulf—south-western side [Chap. VI. rl/Clr 1/ § u u. when in line with the latter bears about 167°, are both dark though inconspicuous until close to; in 1928, a large stranded lighter lay on the beach and formed a conspicuous landmark. 5 Provisions can be obtained in the bazaar. The creek at Sharjah is very small and shallow, and its entrance is about one mile north-eastward of the northern tower of the fort; the depth on the bar is about one foot (0 m 3), but there are depths of 6 feet (l m 8) abreast the town. After passing the town, the creek 10 winds round the bluff and spreads out into a small backwater. Anchorage. —In order that the sea breeze may be a leading wind for sailing boats proceeding to and from the landing place, vessels should anchor with Liyah point bearing between 180° and 160°, in summer, in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), and in winter, in 15 a depth of about 7 fathoms (12 m 8); in either case the holding ground is bad, being rock covered with a little sand. In 1931, H.M .S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 4| fathoms (8 m 2), with the fort bearing 130°, distant about one mile. Caution must be exercised when approaching the anchorage from 20 west -north-westward for a southerly set is often experienced after passing Jezirat Sirri, see page 139. The best landing place is not in the creek, at the entrance of which there is usually some surf, but at Liyah point or under the lee of the stranded lighter. Boats landing at the point should pull 25 round it until it is on a north-north-westerly bearing; in a moderate shamdl it affords the only safe landing. When landing at Liyah point, the creek has to be crossed to reach Sharjah. Coast. —From Liyah village, the coast trends south-westward for about 7 miles to Dabai. 30 Khan and Abu Hail are villages situated, respectively, on the northern and southern sides of a small creek about 2^ miles south- westward of Liyah. These villages are conspicuous from seaward, the country in the vicinity being low and swampy for some miles inland. The creek divides into two branches, one trending north- 35 eastward into the backwater southward of Sharjah, and the other extending in a southerly direction behind Abu Hail village. Khan village consists chiefly of mat huts, but in it are five detached towers. Abu Hail also consists chiefly of mat huts and in it are four towers 40 which are nearly in line when bearing about 137°; at the southern end of the village is a wall that is built across from the sea to the creek behind the village. The towers at both Khan and Abu Hail look high in proportion to the size of the houses and are easily identified. 45 Anchorage off these villages is bad, though there are depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l) at about one mile offshore. At a distance of about one mile south-westward of Abu Hail is a conspicuous clump of tall palms. Chart 3380, plan of Dabai. 50 Dabai.—Shoal.—Anchorage. —This town is situated at a short distance inland on the southern side of a creek, and from it a date grove extends in a southerly direction for about one mile, ending in a detached clump. Dairah {Lat. 25° 16'N., Long. 55° 18' E.) is a large suburb Charts 753, 2837a, 748b.Chap. VI.] COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN 175 Chart 3380, plan of Dahai. consisting of mat huts, amongst which stand a number of well-built houses, most of which latter have square towers with pillared tops; it stands north-eastward of and on the opposite side of the creek to Dabai, on a point formed by a sharp bend in the creek. 5 The highest building in Dabai is the fort, a conspicuous high square castle near the south-western corner of which is a round tower from which latter the Shaikh's flag is flown. There are eight or nine smaller towers in the town and its suburb. Northward of Dabai the coast is of white sand and there is a 10 space clear of trees in which there is a large round tower situated about 11 miles north-eastward of Dabai fort. A small minaret stands about 5 cables north-north-eastward of Dabai fort and is fairly conspicuous from westward or north westward; it is a useful mark when entering the creek. 15 For steamship communications, see page 28. A shoal, consisting of a stony flat over which the depths are about 6 feet (l m 8), extends about half a mile offshore for some distance north-eastward of Dabai and also for about 3 cables off the western entrance point of the creek. {Lat. 25° 16' NLong. 55° 18' E.) 20 Northward of Dabai, the 5-fathom (9 m l) line is about IJ miles offshore; but westward of it, it is only half a mile from the coast. Anchorage may be obtained off Dabai; but the holding ground is bad and there is no shelter from the shamdl. Vessels should not anchor in depths less than 4 fathoms (7 m 3). A good berth is in 25 a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0) at about one mile offshore, or in 5 fathoms (9 m l), with the fort bearing 160°, distant about 13 cables. In 1911, H.M.S. Alert anchored in the latter position but, with a westerly wind of force 4, the sea rose considerably in three hours and, having dragged both anchors, the vessel had to put to sea. Smaller 30 vessels may anchor in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), with the fort bearing 156° distant about 11| cables. Khor Dabai. —This inlet is entered about half a mile northward of the town; its western entrance point is low and sandy and it, and the spit extending from it, are reported to have extended 35 somewhat so that the former now projects slightly. The entrance, which is reported to be constantly changing and is much obstructed by the stony shoal, has a depth in it of about 2 feet (0 m 6), the bottom in places being rocky. The channel winds southward and passes close to the western entrance point. Dairah point is situated about 40 3 cables southward of and on the opposite side of the creek to the western entrance point, and from it a spit extends towards Dabai. At Dairah point, the inlet turns eastward between the town and its suburb and is there about three-quarters of a cable wide with depths in it of from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to 9 m l). A stone jetty, situated 45 on the southern side of the river close eastward of the ferry shown on the plan on chart 3380, is used by native vessels when working cargo and is reported to have a depth alongside of 3 feet (0 m 9). The inlet extends for several miles in a south-easterly direction, but, above the town, is only used by fishermen. 50 Chart 2837a. Coast. —From Dabai, the coast of Trucial 'Oman trends south- westward for about 70 miles to Abu Dhabi; with the exception of a small village, at which there are some date trees, situated about 4 Chart 748b.176 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2837a. . • , „ miles south-westward of Dabai, it is quite barren, uninhabited, and very low and uniform in appearance, here and there tufts of coarse grass grow on hillocks separated by creeks or, in places, by 5 extensive swamps j there is no tree larger than a mangiove bush. Although there are no settled inhabitants, landing unarmed on the mainland between Dabai and Abu Dhabi, is not recommended, for it is often visited by Bedawin from the interior. jabal 'Ali situated about 17 miles south-westward of Dabai 10 and about 3 miles inland, is a flat-topped hill, 220 feet (67^1) high, that rises gradually from either end; it is the only landmark on or near this part of the coast, see view on chart 2837a. Ras Hasa, situated about 30 miles south-westward of Dabai, is a little rocky point that projects slightly from the line of the coast; 15 it shows as a small dark patch in the white sand, but can only be identified when close inshore. Between Dabai and Ras Hasa, the soundings are regular, depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), fine sand, being found at a distance of about 8 cables offshore. Ras Kantut is similar to Ras Hasa and is situated about 5 miles 20 south-westward of it. A1 Ghanadhah, entered about 3 miles south-westward of Ras Kantut, is an inlet the mouth of which is marked by mangrove bushes. The inlet is said to be easily entered by large boats and is frequented for firewood. 25 Ghurabi, entered about 2 miles south-westward of A1 Ghanadhah, is a smaller inlet but it is also frequented for firewood. Between Ghurdbi and Abu Dhabi there is a succession of inlets the majority of which are inter-connected with merely narrow strips of sand between them and the sea. Some of these inlets have 30 deep water within, though their entrances are very shallow, and the whole form extensive swamps and backwaters that extend inland for many miles; they are visited by Arabs for firewood and for fishing. Ras Hanyura {Lat. 24° 44' N., Long. 54° 39' E.), situated about 35 8 miles south-westward of the mouth of Ghurabi inlet, is the low sandy northern entrance point of a shallow bay of the same name, the shores of which are intersected by many creeks. Maraifjain, situated about 3 miles south-westward of Ras Hanyura is the low sandy southern entrance point of Hanyura bay. Both 40 points can be identified at a distance of about 5 miles. A small cliff, with a slightly overhanging top, stands at the head of Hanyura bay and is the southern end of a little tableland from 20 to 30 feet (6 m l to 9 m l) high; it can be identified at a distance of about 7 miles and serves as a guide to the bay. See view on chart 45 2837a. Hadd at Thalei is an extensive reef that, commencing near Ras Hasa, fringes the coast to a position about 2|- miles south-westward of Abu Dhabi fort and in the vicinity of Maraifjain extends offshore for a distance of probably 6 miles. There are depths of 5 and 6 50 fathoms (9 in l to ll m 0) close outside this reef and soundings are not a good guide when approaching it as the bottom is uneven. The natives state that there is a boat channel inside the reef which is used by them during a shamal. Ras al Ghurab, situated about 9| miles south-westward of Chart 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap. VI.] COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN 177 Chart 2837a. Ras Hanyura, is a rocky point near which are low sandhills; the edge of the reef is about 3 miles from the point. There is an inlet at Ras al Ghurab that is said to be extensive and deep inside; it is also stated that its entrance is deeper than that of any other inlet on the coast. Ras Laffan, situated about 9 miles south-westward of Ras al Ghurab, is a low point on the northern side of an inlet that trends southward and joins the great backwater southward of Abu Dhabi; bagalas belonging to Abu Dhabi are hauled up in this inlet. Chart 2837a, plan of Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi.—Shoals.— This town, once the chief seat of piracy in these waters, consists for the most part of date mat huts and extends along the coast for a distance of nearly 2 miles. In the town is a small fort, partially surrounded by trees, with six towers close together, on one of which latter is the flagstaff. A small tower stands on the beach, where there are also several conspicuous stone buildings; one of the buildings is erected on the low sandy point that projects slightly, in a north-westerly direction, from the town. Cattle might possibly be obtained at Abu Dhabi; but the water is very brackish, all good water being brought from Dabai. The coast in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi is very low and the beach is of white sand; the only landmarks are the fort, a tall, conspicuous white minaret about half a mile north-eastward of it, and Jabal Fatasia, a low hill about 8| miles south-south-westward of the fort. This hill, when seen from seaward, hrst appears dark in colour, but on nearer approach the white sand, of which its lower part consists, becomes visible. A few stunted date trees grow about one mile inland from the town. A shoal, over which the depths are from 1| to 3 fathoms (2 m 7 to 5 m 5), extends in a north-westerly direction for nearly If miles from the sandy point at the town. A reef of coral, over which the depths are from 3 to 6 feet (0 m 9 to l m 8), lies on the inshore end of the shoal, with a channel, in which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), between it and the coast. A rock, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies nearly 2| miles north-westward of the fort at Abu Dhabi. A 2J-fathom (4 m 6) patch lies about 2| miles northward of the fort, and eastward of it the depths appear to be shoal. At about 3 miles south-westward of the fort at Abu Dhabi is the mouth of a channel leading into a large backwater, 3^ miles wide at its entrance and extending inland for a considerable distance. The greater part of the inlet is shallow and it has not been surveyed; but in it are many deep channels and several islands. By its connection with Khor Laffan, the land on which stands Abu Dhabi {Lat. 24° 29' N., Long. 54° 22' E.) becomes an island; there is, however, one place that is fordable at low water. Anchorage.—Directions. —The anchorage for larger vessels is in depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 in 3 to 9 m l) , with the fort bearing not more than 122° distant from 2 to 2| miles; but caution is necessary on account of the proximity of the 3-fathom (5 m 5) rock; this position is open seaward and the holding ground is bad, consisting of coral which is bare in some places and only lightly covered with sand in Chart 748b.178 persian gulf—south-western side [Chap. VI. Chart 2837a, plan of Ahu Dhabi. others. The sandy point, shown on the plan on chart 2837a, about 2 miles south-westward of the fort, is of very white sand and is quite clearly defined when close to the anchorage; it forms a useful 5 mark by which to anchor. In 1931, H.M.S. Penzance anchored, in a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), sand and coral, with the fort bearing 123°, distant 8| cables; this position was found to be too far north ward; the fort should not be brought to bear more than 120°. Small vessels, drawing up to 12 feet (3 m 7), anchor between the 10 coral reef and the coast in depths of about 2£ fathoms (4^6) with the fort bearing 174°, distant about 6 cables; this anchorage is quite sheltered by the reef, but the space is usually fully occupied by native craft. [Lat. 24° 30' N., Long. 54° 22' E.) Vessels approaching Abu Dhabi from north-eastward should 15 give Hadd at Thalei a wide berth. Vessels approaching from northward should first make Sir Bu Na'air, see page 179; its summit should be brought to bear 356° and kept so, course 176° being made good after losing sight of it. The depths are irregular, varying from 16 to 7 fathoms (29 m 3 tol2 m 8), 20 and cause considerable overfalls; the tidal streams set north-eastward and south-westward and probably attain a rate of about one knot. A good lookout should be kept from aloft, for depths of 8 fathoms (14 m 6) are found close to the reefs; the reefs north-eastward of Abu Dhabi must be specially guarded against. Having identified the 25 fort, anchorage may be obtained as previously directed. The inner anchorage may be approached with the fort bearing 122°; this will lead close south-westward of the coral reef which shows up well; the reef may be rounded closely and anchorage obtained as previously directed; the afternoon is the best time for 30 entering. The shallow water over the reef shows up dark. There is a passage northward from the inner anchorage in which the depth is apparently about 2 fathoms (3 m 7); it is available for a sailing vessel leaving with a westerly wind, the vessel being conned from aloft, and is used by native craft. 35 Landing, when the swell is moderate, can be effected close north eastward of the low sandy point half a mile northward of the fort; it is sheltered by the reef and the beach is fairly steep-to. Charts 2837a and b. GREAT PEARL BANK. —This extensive bank, of which the 40 20-fathom (36 in 6) line may be considered to be the northern limit, fills the great bight in the southern part of the Persian gulf. The eastern limit of the pearl fishery is north-westward of Sharjah, and its northern boundary trends in a general westerly direction to Jezirat Haliil, see page 200, passing about 20 miles northward of 45 Jezirat Sir Bu Na'air, see page 179; from Haliil it trends north westward to a position about 30 miles north-eastward of Ras Rakan, see page 202. Nearly all the numerous pearl banks known to the Arabs, see page 10, are situated to the south of this line. The depths on the Great Pearl bank average from 10 to 15 fathoms 50 (18 m 3 to 27 m 4), but in places there are depths of from 20 to 23 fathoms (36^6 to 42 m l). Many shallow knolls, over which the depths are from 3 to 9 fathoms to 16 m 5) lie on the bank, and these are the pearl banks proper. Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] great pearl bank 179 Charts 2837a and b. On all the pearl banks the bottom is uneven, the depths in many places changing suddenly by as much as 2 or 3 fathoms (3 m 7 or 5 m 5). Great reefs, in places with channels or open water inside them, lie within 45 miles of the coast; the general depths over them vary 5 from 3 feet to 3 fathoms (0 m 9 to 5 m 5); the bottom is stony or broken coral and they show up well, except on cloudy days or when under the sun. The water everywhere is comparatively shoal and in places, especially about 35 miles north-westward of Sir Bu Na'air, there 10 are great overfalls, so that, the eye being the only guide, it is not safe to be under way after dark when near or within the great reefs, and a good look-out from aloft is indispensable. Many islands, both close to the coast and far offshore, lie on the bank; some are high, and most of them have low projecting sandy 15 points at their south-eastern ends. Many are barren and, for the most part, without fresh water, though a little brackish water may be found on one or two of them. With the exception of Dalmah, see page 188, none have permanent inhabitants, though they are frequented by the pearl boats during the summer and by fishermen 20 from Abu Dhabi {Lat. 24° 29'N., Long. 54° 22' E.) during the winter. Caution.—Tidal streams.—Pilotage .—Extreme care must be exercised when on the Great Pearl bank for the tidal streams are strong and uncertain; and the bank has been incompletely surveyed. 25 When southward of the parallel of 25^° N. and westward of the meridian of 531° E., particular caution is required for the safety of the vessel depends chiefly upon a vigilant lookout being maintained. Soundings afford little or no guide when approaching the islands and reefs. A vessel drawing more than 10 feet (3 m 0) should not be 30 under way after dark anywhere in the above area. From observations made by H.M.S. Crocus, in 1924, it would appear that, between Sir Bu Na'air and a position midway between that island, Jezirat Sirri, and Jezirat Bu Musa, the tidal streams set eastward and westward at a rate of about three-quarters of a knot; 35 that between Sir Bu Na'air and the meridian of 53° 10' E. they set east-south-eastward and west-north-westward at a rate of about half a knot; and that between the meridian of 53° 10' E. and Jezirat Haliil they set southward and northward at a rate of about one quarter of a knot. 40 A vessel visiting the coast, or navigating within the reefs should have a pilot on board. The best pilots for the coast are to be obtained at Abu Dhabi. Chart 2830. Jezirat Sir Bu Na'air.—Anchorage .—This island, situated 45 about 45 miles northward of Abu Dhabi and over 40 miles south- south -westward of Jezirat Sirri, see page 139, is composed chiefly of small volcanic hills excepting its south-eastern extremity which is a very low sandy point about half a mile long. The summit of the island is a table-topped peak that rises to an elevation of 240 50 feet (73 m l) near the southern end of the hills and is fairly conspicuous, except from northward. See view on chart 2837a. The island is fringed with a reef that extends from 2 to 3 cables offshore. The south-eastern point, being low, must be given a Charts 2837b, 748b.180 PERSIAN gulf— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2830. good berth at night. There are depths of from 10 to 15 fathoms (18 m 3 to 27 m 4) close to the reef and for several miles round the island, so that soundings are not a good guide when approaching it. 5 The island is uninhabited, but on it are a few wild cats, a fair number of sea birds, and some curlew. It is barren, nothing but brushwood growing on it. The water in the wells near the eastern side of the island is brackish, but there is a deep well of good drinking water to which tracks lead from the south-eastern point of the island; 10 the water is, however, so hard that it is of no use for washing. Iron ore and some sulphur are reported to exist on the island. During the pearl fishery, the island is visited by numbers of boats, to open the oysters, etc.; in winter, a few boats, fishing chiefly for sawfish and sharks, usually make it their headquarters, and erect i5 temporary huts for their families. Anchorage, sheltered from the shamdl but exposed to the nashi, may be obtained on the eastern side of the island, in a depth of about 13 fathoms (23 m 7), at a distance of about half a mile offshore, with the peak bearing 275°, and the low south-eastern point bearing 20 202°. Chart 2837a. Rak az Zakum.—Shoals. —Rak az Zakum is a pearl bank lying about 35 miles north-westward of Abu Dhabi. Its extent is not accurately known, but it appears to be about 13 miles in length, in 25 an easterly and westerly direction, within the 5-fathom (9 m l) line. The least depth over it (La/. 24° 48' N., Long. 53° 48' E.) is 2| fathoms (4 m 6) and those round it afford but little guide when approaching it. It is not marked by discolouration. Southward of Rak az Zakum, between that bank, Abu Dhabi, 30 and Rak al Hajji, see page 182, the area has been imperfectly sounded. In many places there are great overfalls. Three shoals, lying respectively about 12 miles south-westward, 8 miles southward, and 10 miles south-south-eastward of the shoalest part of Rak az Zakum, were reported in 1927; they have not been 35 examined and their positions are only known approximately. A shoal, over which there is a depth of fathoms (8 m 2), lies eastward of the foregoing, about 22 miles north-westward of Abu Dhabi. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3^ fathoms (G 1 ^), was 40 reported, in 1926, to lie about 11 miles southward of the shoalest part of Rak az Zakum; its position is not accurately known. The chart shows a detached 5-fathom (9 in l) patch about 27 miles westward of Abu Dhabi. Charts 2837a and h. 45 Coast. —The southern shore of the Persian gulf is low and sandy or stony, with here and there hills of rock or sand of moderate height, but there are few, if any, distinctive features; it is entirely barren and desolate; water is only obtainable at a few places, and even then it is of very indifferent quality. From Abu Dhabi to Al 50 Wakrah, see page 195, 157 miles west-north-westward and about 60 miles southward of Ras Rakan, there are neither villages, houses, nor permanent inhabitants. The coast is occasionally visited by Bedawin who might attack a small unarmed party; but it is seldom visited by Europeans. Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] GREAT PEARL BANK 181 Charts 2837a and h. Jezirat Yas or Sir Beni Yas, see page 184, is situated about 93 miles westward of Abu Dhabi, and very little is known of the intervening coast. Reefs, on which are many low islands, lie from 10 to 30 miles off it; some of the islands are of considerable size 5 and overgrown with mangroves. In the eastern part of this coast, there are many creeks and backwaters, and channels through and between the reefs that are only partially explored. The land is a stony desert, with small detached groups of volcanic hills; on the coast are low cliffs. The apparent coast line, for the first 30 miles 10 south-westward of Abu Dhabi, is formed by a number of low islets with creeks running in between, and meeting behind them, thus detaching them from the mainland which lies at some considerable distance within them and has not been explored. Many of the islets, and the mainland behind them, are resorted to by the Arabs 15 to cut mangroves for firewood, and the creeks are visited by fishermen; all the creeks are said to have shallow entrances and deeper water inside. The tidal streams are said to be strong in places; particularly round the points of the islands, through the narrow channels, and 20 between the reefs. Jezirat al Bahrani, on the south-western side of the entrance of the backwater southward of Abu Dhabi, is a low sandy island with some mangroves upon it. Jabal Abu Kashasha is a small hill on the island next south- 25 westward of Jezirat Al Bahrani. Ras al Kahaf, situated about 7 miles south-westward of the south-western extremity of Jezirat al Bahrani, is a flat-topped rocky point, comparatively high, and probablv a part of the main land. [Lat. 24° 17' N.,'Long. 54° 07' E.) 30 Umm al Majarib and Jezirat Kantur are low islands south- westward of Ras al Kahaf; they are covered with mangroves and are separated from each other and from the mainland, by small creeks. The foregoing islands are fronted by a reef that extends about 35 3 miles north-westward of Jezirat Bahrani and 8 miles in that direction from Jezirat Kantur. Khor Kantur, a channel through the reefs, is about one mile wide at its entrance situated about 23 miles west-south-westward of Abu Dhabi. It trends southward for about 8 miles and then 40 divides, one part extending eastward behind Jezirat Kantur, and the other westward behind Jezirat Salali. There are depths of 2 fathoms (3 m 7) in the entrance channel and 4 fathoms (7 m 3) farther in. Bazam reef. —This reef, forming the northern side of Khor al Bazam, see page 183, also forms the western side of Khor Kantur 45 and extends thence in a westerly direction for about 53 miles. The northern edge of this reef lies from 12 to 17 miles off the mainland and is only charted approximately. Soundings are no guide when approaching it for there are depths of from 5 to 10 fathoms (9 m l to 18 m 3) both close to it and at a distance of 15 miles from it. 50 A chain of islands, usually called collectively Bazam, though each island has its own proper name, extends along the southern edge of the reef. All the islands are waterless. Jezirat Salali, the easternmost island on Bazam reef, is low, Chart 748b.persian gulf— -SOUTH -western side [Chap. VIi except near its north -eastern end where there is a hill. Westward of the island, there is a channel into Khor al Bazam that is used by boats at high water. a t z ^ 5 Tezirat Abul Abyadh, the next island westward of balah, is the ' largest on Bazam reef and on its western part are low sandhills. Al Tunaina, lying about 5 miles westward of the western end of Abul Abyadh and IJ miles inside the southern edge of the reef, is a rocky islet in the neighbourhood of which are a number of 10 detached rocks. * u + K -i A rocky islet lies, on the southern edge of the reef, about 5 miles westward of Al Junaina, with a smaller islet about one mile north- Wa Al Fiha {Lat. 24° 17'N., Long. 53° 16' E.) is a low island, 15 situated about 9 miles westward of Al Junaina, close westward of which is another; both lie on the southern side of the reef. Bazam al Gharbi, the westernmost of the islands on Bazam reef, is low and partly covered with mangroves. It lies on the southern edge of the reef and about 3 miles within its western end. 20 Reideim, the north-western portion of Bazam reef, lies within about 5 miles northward of Bazam al Gharbi and extends in an east- north-easterly and opposite direction for about 9 miles, it is probably detached. Halat Hail is an islet on the northern edge of Bazam reef, lying 25 about 8 miles north-eastward of the north-eastern end of Al Fiha. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2J fathoms (4^1), lies about 2 miles north-eastward of Halat Hail. Rak al Hajji and Bu Tini. —These two shoals lie, in the approach to Khor al Bazam, northward of the western half of 30 B3.za.111 reef. Rak al Hajji has not been surveyed; but on it are one or two sandbanks that dry. Halat al Mubarraz is a narrow sandy islet, about 3 feet (0 m 9) high, that lies on the southern edge of Rak al Hajji. 35 Khor Bashubar, the channel between Rak al Hajji and Bazam reef, is about miles wide and the depths in it are from 4 to 8 fathoms (7 m 3 to 14 m 6). The tidal streams, setting eastward and westward through Khor Bashubar, are strong at springs. 40 Bu Tini, about 8 miles north-westward of Rak al Hajji and 5 miles northward of Reideim, is an extensive shoal, that in places, is nearly dry for miles, and on which are about six drying sandbanks. On this, and on many other shoals on the Great Pearl bank, the fisher men wade about, looking for pearl oysters, far from their boats. 45 Khor Halj is the clear channel between Bu Tini, on the north west and north, and Rak al Hajji and Reideim, on the south-east and south; it appears to have a least width of about 5 miles, with depths of from 5 to 8 fathoms (9 m l to 14 m 6). Directions. —Khor Halj is navigable by day in clear weather. 50 The dry banks on Bu Tini can be seen from aloft at some distance from the shoal and Bazam al Gharbi is visible from aloft when in mid-channel. To pass eastward through Khor Halj, vessels should keep on the Bu Tini side, with the sandbanks of that shoal in sight until past Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] GREAT PEARL BANK 183 Charts 2837a and h. it; a good lookout should be kept for the pale green water on Rak al Hajji. To pass through Khor Bashubar, vessels should steer eastward from Bu Tini with caution until Rak al Hajji is sighted; they should 5 then run along its southern edge passing about 21- cables southward of Halat al Mubarraz. These passages should only be used with the sun astern of the vessel. Khor al Bazam. —This large inlet is a blind channel leading 10 east-south-eastward between Bazam reef and the mainland for about 45 miles. At its entrance it is about 6 miles wide, and its breadth decreases to about one mile at its head. The entrance of the inlet has not been surveyed. The inlet is approached between Reideim and Ras Barud situated 15 about 10 miles west-north-westward. Ras Barud {Lat. 24° 27' NLong. 52° 52' E.) is the north eastern extremity of an extensive reef on the western side of the entrance of Kh5r al Bazam; on the reef are several dry sandbanks. Al Isha, lying about 8 miles south-south-eastward of Ras Barud, 20 is a low sandy islet at the south-eastern end of the reef. In the channel between Ras Barud and Al Isha, on the one hand, and Bazam reef, on the other, there are several detached shoal patches. The depths in Khor al Bazam decrease from 10 fathoms (18 m 3), near its entrance, to about 2 fathoms (3 m 7) at its head, but are some- 25 what irregular. The southern side of the khor is bounded by a reef that extends about 6 miles from the mainland. Directions.—Anchorage.— None but vessels of light draught should attempt to enter Khor al Bazam and even they must keep a 30 good lookout. The approach may be made passing either side of Rak al Hajji or Bu Tini. If passing northward and westward of Bu Tini, from a position not less than 5 miles southward of Zirko, see page 185, the summit of that island should be brought to bear 024° and kept so, astern, to pass westward of Bu Tini. When the 35 sandbanks of Bu Tini, which should be made, have all been passed, the vessel should steer southward, allowing for the tidal stream and keeping a good lookout for shoal patches. Al Isha should be sighted, and when it bears 270°, course may be altered into Khor al Bazam, a good lookout being kept for the south-western extremity 40 of Bazam reef. When the south-eastern end of Bazam al Gharbi bears about 069°, it should be approached on that bearing and anchorage, completely sheltered by the reef, obtained about one mile offshore in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), clay and good holding ground. 45 From this anchorage, two points of the mainland should be visible; Ras as Sawami, situated about 8 miles south-south eastward, is a light-coloured cliff, apparently about 50 feet (15 m 2) high; Ras Jaliya, situated about 10 miles south-westward, is of somewhat similar appearance, and is so named from its imaginary 50 resemblance to a fort. In proceeding up Khor al Bazam, from Bazam al Gharbi the depths appear to be more regular than in the approach, and the vessel should pass from about one to 2 miles southward of the islands on Chart 748b.184 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Charts 2837a and b. Bazam reef, being guided by the eye when approaching the edge of the reef. The fourth island, which is rocky, may be passed close to. 5 Coast. —From Ras as Sawami, the coast of Trucial 'Oman trends westward for about 30 miles to a low point near which is Jabal Dhanni and consists of low cliffs behind which are small detached groups of volcanic hills. Jezirat al Hamar, situated about 11 miles eastward of Jabal 10 Dhanni, is the westernmost of several islets that lie on a reef extending from 4 to 8 miles offshore between that islet and Ras as Sawami. Jabal Dhanni [Lat. 24° 11' N., Long. 52° 37' E.) is about 350 feet {106 m 7) high and is situated about 2 miles south-westward of 15 the low point previously referred to , from which latter a reef extends for a distance of from 2 to 3 miles. Between this reef and that on which lies Jezirat al Hamar there is a deep bight in the middle of the entrance of which is a sandy islet, about 3 feet (0 m 9) high, that is surrounded by deep water. 20 Jezirat Rashid. —This low flat rocky islet lies, on the western end of the shoals extending northward and westward from Al Isha, in a position about 14 miles north-westward of that islet. These shoals, if not continuous, have no navigable passage between them, and are reported to extend for a distance of about one mile south- 25 westward of Rashid. There are great overfalls northward and north-westward of Rashid and a detached patch, over which there is a depth of 4^ fathoms (8 m 2), lies about 2 miles north-westward of it. Jezirat Yas.—Dangers.— This island, also known as Sir Beni 30 Yas, lies between Rashid and the point on the mainland near Jabal Dhanni; it rises in the middle to volcanic hills of which the two highest peaks are 430 feet (131 in l) high, and are situated close to one another. With the exception of a small hill, about 70 feet (21 m 3) high, on its eastern side, the coasts of the island are low. 35 The ruins of a village stand on the north-eastern side of the island close to the beach, and near them wat»r can be obtained by digging, but it is not good. A reef extends off the northern and north-eastern sides of Jezirat Yas and also from its southern end; on its western side the reef 40 extends for a distance of about 8 cables offshore and is steep-to. A detached shoal patch lies eastward of the summit of Jezirat Yas at a distance of about one mile offshore, with a 5-fathom (9 m l) patch about 2| miles north-eastward of it. A white sandy islet, only a few feet high, lies about 3| miles eastward of Jezirat Yas, 45 with the 70-foot (21 m 3) hill and the summit of the island nearly in line; the chart shows a shoal patch close south-westward of this islet. The channel between the reef extending from Jezirat Yas and that on which lies Jezirat Rashid is about 1| miles wide with depths in 50 it of from 7 to 18 fathoms (12 m 8 to 32 ra 9); but a shoal, over which there is a depth of 5 fathoms (O 01 !), lies in it about If miles south- westward of Rashid. The channel between the reef extending from the southern extremity of Jezirat Yas and that fringing the mainland southward Chart 748b.f2-&lt;i Chap. VI.] great pearl bank 185 Charts 2837a and h. J of it is less than one mile wide; there are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) in it, but the tidal streams through it are strong and cause eddies. Meriton bay is an almost circular basin in the low south-eastern sandy part of Jezfrat Yas. It is about half a mile in extent and the 5 anchorage inside it is completely sheltered. The entrance, which is about 75 yards (68 m 6) wide, has a depth in it of 13 feet (4 m 0) and is close to the very steep-to spit on the eastern side of the bay. In the centre of the bay there is a depth of 6 fathoms (ll 11 ^)), mud; but the approach to the entrance is shallow, there being depths less 10 than 2 fathoms (3 m 7) outside the bay. Directions .—Anchorage .—Meriton bay and the anchorage off it should be approached from northward and eastward of Jezfrat Yas. Having made Jezirat Yas, its summit should be brought to bear 180° and kept so until Rashid is seen; this latter should be 15 passed at a distance of less than one mile and course altered to pass between the reef extending south-westward from it and that fringing the northern end of Jezirat Yas. The reefs fringing the eastern side of Jezirat Yas should be skirted at a convenient distance, passing between the detached shoal patch eastward of the summit of the 20 island and the white sandy islet about 2f miles eastward of it. The reefs on either side of the channel between Jezirat Rashid and Jezfrat Yas show up well. When past the white sandy islet and the shoal patch, course may be altered to round the low sandy south-eastern point of Jezirat Yas, and Meriton bay will be seen over the low spit 25 on its eastern side. Anchorage, sheltered from all winds, may be obtained, in a depth of 7 fathoms (I2 in 8), clay, at a distance of about 2^ cables offshore, with the small hill on the eastern side of the island in line with the low south-eastern point of Meriton bay. 30 In 1930, H.M.S. Cyclamen approached Meriton bay on a north westerly course and anchored in a depth of 6|- fathoms (ll m 9) with the end of the spit enclosing the bay bearing 328° and the right tangent of the curve of that spit bearing 032°. There is a shoal, over which the depth is less than 2 fathoms (3 m 7), sand, about 2 35 cables westward of this position; it is marked by discoloured water extending northward and north-westward from it. This shoal is apparently part of a reef that extends for a distance of about 8 cables eastward and southward of the southern extremity of Jezfrat Yas and must be avoided when approaching the anchorage. 40 Entry into Meriton bay [Lat. 24° 17'N., Long. 52° 38' E.) is not recommended to sailing vessels as the tidal streams are strong; the channel runs close round the end of the sandy spit on the eastern side of the bay. Meriton bay may be approached from westward, passing south- 45 ward of Jezirat Yas; but the passage is not recommended, that northward of the island being the better. There is a passage from Jezirat Yas leading southward of A1 Isha into Khor al Bazam, but it requires great care in its navigation; it should not be attempted by any but small vessels and is not 50 recommended even to them. Jezirat Zirko.—Dangers.—Anchorage. —This island, situated about 12 miles northward of the northern side of Bu Tini, rises to a fairly conspicuous peak about 540 feet (164 m 6) high; it is without Chart 748b.186 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Charts 2837a and h. water or any vegetation other than some grass and stunted brushwood. See views N and O on chart 2837b. The southern point of the island is low and sandy, and from it 5 extends a drying sand spit. On all sides the island is fringed with a flat reef that extends for a short distance offshore, except on the eastern side where it projects for about three-quarters of a mile. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 2| fathoms (4^6), lies about miles southward of the island. 10 A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), lies about one mile northward of the island. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 4^ fathoms (8 m 2), with the southern extremity of the island bearing between 248° and 270°, distant from 5 to 8 cables; the anchorage is sheltered 15 from the shamal, but some swell rolls in round the island. The tidal streams between the southern end of the island and the shoal lying off it are strong at springs and cause ripplings like breakers that extend in a northerly and southerly direction. Jezirat Qarnain.—Shoals. —Jezlrat Qamain is waterless and is 20 situated about 11 miles west-north-westward of Jezirat Zirko. The southern part of the island is low; but on its northern end are three remarkable detached dark peaks, the highest of which rises to an elevation of 190 feet (57 m 9), see view O on chart 2837b. The depths close to the island are comparatively great; but a 25 shoal spit, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) extends nearly one mile from its south-eastern point. Shoals which have not been examined, were reported, in 1927, to lie between 4 and 8 miles north-westward of Qarnain, and two others are stated to exist about 7 and 9 miles, respectively, south -westward of that island. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3), lies about 13 miles south-westward of Qarnain; and a shoal with a similar depth over it lies about 10 miles west-south-westward of the island. 35 Jezirat Das.—Dangers.—Anchorage. —This waterless island is situated about 12 miles northward of Qarnain; its hills, rising in its northern half to an elevation of about 260 feet (79 m 2), are of even outline and its southern half is low. There is very little fringing reef; but a 2-fathom (3 m 7) patch lies close off the southern 40 end of the island. [Lai. 25° 09' NLong. 52° 53' E.) Shoals, over which the depths are 4 fathoms (7 m 3), lie within ' a distance of 3 miles southward and south-eastward of the island. Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 5 to 8 fathoms (9 m l to 14 in 6), at about half a mile eastward of the south-eastern 45 low sandy point of the island; but during a shamdl much swell would probably be felt there for the island affords but little shelter. Caution is necessary when approaching this anchorage for the depths decrease quickly shoreward. The best landing place is on the western side of the south -eastern 50 point of the island. Jezirat Arzanah.—Shoals.—Anchorage. —This waterless island is situated about 18 miles south-westward of Qarnain and about 25 miles northward of the northern end of Jezirat Yas; towards Cha#t 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chep.

It is fringed by a reef that nowhere extends more than 3 cables offshore. Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 4 to 5 fathoms (7 m 3 to O 111 !), with the southern extremity of the island bearing about 270°, at a distance of about half a mile offshore. The following pearl banks or shoals exist in the neighbourhood of Arzanah {Lat. 24° 48'N., Long. 52° 34' E.). An extensive shoal, over which the depths are from 3 to 4 fathoms (5 m 5 to 7 m 3), its shoalest part being charted about 8 miles north-north-westward of Arzanah, though it is reported to lie farther westward; a shoal, extending in a northerly direction for about 10 miles from a position within 2 miles east-south-eastward of Arzanah, with depths of one fathom (l m 8) over its southern part increasing to 5 fathoms (9 m l) at its northern end; a shoal, over which the depth is 5 fathoms (9 m l) or less, about 11 miles south-eastward of Arzanah; and a small shoal, over which there is a depth of 4|- fathoms (8 m 2), about 2J miles southward of that island. Jezirat Daiyinah.—Shoals.—Anchorage. —This island is situated about 12 miles north-westward of Arzanah; it is flat and sandy and scantily covered with grass; the highest part is a solitary black rock, at its northern end, about 9 feet (2 m 7) high. Except at the southern end of its western side, where there are depths of 20 fathoms (36 m 6) close inshore, the island is fringed by a reef that extends about cables from the coast. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6), from 3 to 5 cables off the southern point of the island; it is more sheltered from the shamal than might be expected from the small size of the island. Several pearl banks, over which the depths are from 3| to 5 fathoms (6 m 4 to 9 m l) and the positions of which can best be seen on chart 2837b, lie between 8 and 17 miles northward of the island. A coral reef has been observed about 7 miles northward of the island; it appeared to extend for about 3 miles in a northerly and southerly direction, and to be nearly awash. Chart 283Tb. Jezirat Shura awah.—Shoals.—Anchorage. —This islet, situated about 9 miles west-north-westward of Jezirat Daiyinah, has little or no fringing reef; on it are five or six little hummocks, about 40 feet (12 m 2) high, that are nearly in line on easterly and westerly bearings; the middle part of the islet is low. Shoal water extends south-eastward from the islet for at least half a mile. The islet has a good sandy beach on which turtles are caught. A small detached rocky pinnacle, about 8 feet (2 m 4) high, lies about one mile northward of the islet; in the channel between them there is a depth of 8 fathoms (14 m 6). The least depth in the approach from northward, with the islet bearing between 180° and 190°, would appear to be 5 fathoms (9 in l); but reefs may exist in this area. The bottom, between Daiyinah and Shura 'awah, is very irregular and several reefs, not shown on the chart, have been observed; the depths in the approach from southward are also uneven. A one-fathom (l m 8) patch lies, on the southern side of a large Chart 748h.188 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. pearl bank, about 6 miles north -westward of Shura awah; this bank lies eastward of Rak Kareinein, page 195. , o ^ Fair anchorage can be obtained in a shamal, about 3 cables off 5 the beach in the middle of the southern side of the island, in depths of 5 or 6 fathoms (9 m l or llmO), sand; a vessel about 200 feet (61*0) in length swinging in-shore would get into a depth of 4 fathoms (T^); there is no shelter farther out. Charts 2837a and b. 10 Jezirat Dalmah .—Shoals—Anchorage.—Thts island, situated about 20 miles south-westward of Arzanah and 6| miles north westward of Jezirat Yas is for the most part hilly but terminates southward in a very low narrow plain, about miles long, that ends in a point. At a distance, the hills appear as one long table- 15 land, with a small barn-shaped peak near the northern end, which peak' is 244 feet (74 m 4) high. The village, which stands on the western side of the plain, is small and in it is a tower, it can be seen from eastward across the plain. There is plenty of brackish water in the wells and the villagers keep flocks of goats. 20 Except at its southern and eastern extremities, a reef fringes the island to a distance of about 2| cables offshore; from its eastern extremity the reef extends nearly three-quarters of a mile offshore with discoloured water from 2 to 3 miles or more farther seaward; as its southern extremity is approached the fringing reef becomes 25 narrower. The depths in the vicinity of Dalmah are irregular. A patch of the discoloured water, where the depth is apparently about 2 fathoms (3 m 7), has been reported to lie about 2 miles east ward of the island. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3| fathoms (6 m 4), sand, 30 lies about one mile offshore eastward of the village. The island is much visited by the pearl boats on account of the water, and at the end of the season a temporary bazaar is set up; persons engaged in the trade, including the Indian merchants of the Trucial coast, go there to collect debts and purchase pearls. &lt;35 Halat Masuma {Lat. 24° 25' N., Long. 52° 19' E.) is a sandy islet, about 2 feet (0 m 6) high, lying about 2J miles southward of the southern extremity of Dalmah; it is situated on a shoal that has depths of 8 fathoms (14 m 6) close-to, and extends about 1^ miles south-south-westward from it and one mile in other directions. 40 There is a narrow passage, between the shoal and Dalmah, in which the depths are about 3 fathoms (5 m 5); the tidal streams, setting east and west through it, are strong. A rocky patch, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 in 5) and close round which are depths of from 12 to 17 fathoms (21 m 9 id to 31 m l), lies about 6 miles south-westward of Halat Masuma. The chart shows a detached 5-fathom (9 m l) patch lying about 8 miles south-south-eastward of the islet. Anchorage, well sheltered from the shamal, may be obtained off Dalmah, in a depth of 6| fathoms (ll m 9) and about 4 cables south- 50 eastward of the low sandy plain, with the southern house in the village bearing 289°, and the eastern extremity of the island bearing 011°. At a distance of about one cable inshore of this position the depths shoal rapidly from 5| to 3| fathoms (10 m l to 6 m 4). From eastward, the anchorage should be approached with the village Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] COAST OF TRUCIAL 'OMAN 189 Charts 2837a and b. bearing more than 282' . In 1931, H.M .S. Hastings anchored a little farther northward. Native boats lie on the western side of the point, off the village and close to the reef, where they are sheltered from the shamal by the south-western point of the island and are 5 also protected from the nashi. Chart 2837b. Caution. —A1 Wakrah is situated about 80 miles north-westward of Jabal Dhanni, see page 184, and the intervening coast is most difficult and dangerous of approach for off it lie many low islets 10 and the great bay between them is much encumbered with shoals which have been imperfectly surveyed and but roughly delineated. Navigation is also dangerous, outside the shoals, westward of a line joining Dalmah and Shura 'awah for there the irregular nature of the bottom causes overfalls in all directions. This locality 15 should therefore be avoided; even the Arabs do not visit it in any craft larger than their pearl boats. Jabal Dhanni to Ras Masheirib.—Shoals. —From Jabal Dhanni, the coast trends south-westward for about 9 miles to a point close off which lies Zabiit, an island, faced with white cliffs 20 and stated to be about 120 feet (36 m 6) high. Shoals extend for a distance of about 8 miles northward and north-eastward from Zabut; and westward and north-westward of it are two shoal patches and a large unsurveyed area; it is not, therefore, advisable to approach the island within a distance of 8 25 or 10 miles. Jabal Barakah rises to an elevation of about 250 feet (76 m 2) at a short distance inland of a low cliff on the coast of the mainland about 8 miles south-westward of Zabut . Jabal Wutaid is situated about 2 miles from the coast nearly 30 7 miles south-westward of Jabal Barakah [Lat. 24° 01' N., Long. 52° 22' E.), and is the termination of the low ranges of dark coastal hills that extend westward from Ras as Sawami. Ras Assak is a small point north-westward of Jabal Wutaid. Sabakhah matti, or the salt ground, extends westward from 36 Ras Assak for a distance of about 25 miles. It is most desolate, low and partly swampy, and is the southernmost part of the coast of the Persian gulf. It is difficult to approach or even to sight it for foul ground extends from 4 to 6 miles offshore, and a detached 3-fathom (5 in 5) patch lies about 4 miles offshore, 13^ miles north- 40 westward of Ras Assak. The mainland is invisible from the edge of the foul ground. The Arabs state that it is the hottest part of the Gulf. Ras as Sila is a slightly projecting point at the western end of Sabakhah matti. Foul ground extends eastward and east-north- 45 eastward from the point for a distance of at least 2| miles. From near Rasas Sila, the coast trends northward for about 13 miles and consists of a succession of small rocky points; thence it trends north-westward for 2| miles to Ras Masheirib, and is fringed by a reef extending from 5 to 8 cables offshore. Northward of Ras 50 as Sila, the land gradually rises to a level summit about 100 feet (30 m 5) high, falling to the coast in a series of little terraces or steps. This table land is of light colour and sometimes sparkles in the sunlight owing to the fragments of crystals embedded in its surface. Chart 748h.igQ PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 28m. i J f ^ Near the coast, at a short distance northward ot Kas as Sila, are some wells of brackish water. ^ v . Kassar al Baya (Lat. 24° 07' N., Long. 51 47 E.) is an islet 5 on the coastal reef about 4 miles northward of Ras as Sila. A conspicuous little table hill rises to an elevation of 75 feet [22^9) at the point whence the coast trends north-westward; from the 75-foot (22 m 9) hill, for a distance of about one mile, the coast consists of low white cliffs; it then falls towards Ras Masheirib 10 which is very low, rocky, and shelving. Off -lying islands and dangers.—Anchorage.— Jezair Yasat, situated about 24 miles west-north-westward of Zabut, and about 11 miles off the coast of the mainland westward of it, consists of a group of two level islands, about 15 feet (4 m 6) high, and 15 surrounded by cliffs, together with three islets farther southward. A small spit extends south-eastward from the southern islet and a shoal patch lies about one mile north-westward of it. There is a clear channel, southward of the southern islet, about 2h miles wide; but the depths in it are irregular and vary from 4 20 to 20 fathoms (7 m 3 to 36 m 6). A reef extends in a north-easterly direction for a distance of about 6 miles from the northern island of the group, and thence a chain of extensive reefs continues northward for about 60 miles with no known ship channel through it, except that between Fasht al 'Odaid 25 and Rak Kareinein, see page 195. Anchorage can be obtained at Yasat with the southern islet bearing between 068° and 090°, distant about half a mile. Westward and north-westward of Yasat, along the coast and inshore of the extensive outlying reefs as far as Khor al 'Odaid, 30 see page 192, the survey is more complete than that eastward of those islands; but it is probable that many undiscovered rocks and shoal patches exist there. Mahamaliya, lying about 6 miles west-south-westward of the southernmost islet of Yasat, is a light-co loured islet, from 15 to 35 20 feet (4 m 6 to 6 m l) high, that has a flat top with a notch in it, and is surrounded by cliffs. A small detached patch, over which there is a depth of one fathom (l m 8), lies about one mile south-eastward of Mahamaliya. Umm al Hatab, lying about 6 miles north-north-westward of 40 Mahamaliya, is a low sandy islet on which are tufts of coarse grass. It is situated on a rocky reef, with several above-water rocks off its northern end; the reef extends about half a mile from the eastern and western sides of the islet, but the southern side is clear. Naita, lying about 2 miles north-eastward of the 75-foot (22 m 9) i5 hill south-eastward of Ras Masheirib, is a low sandy islet on which are tufts of coarse grass; on the islet are a few graves; several detached rocks lie off its northern end. The islet lies on the south western edge of an extensive reef that appears to be joined to that which extends northward from Yasat. A spit extends in a south- 50 easterly direction from Naita for a distance of about one mile In the area southward of Naita and westward of Yasat, the depths are uneven, and in places where they do not exceed 3 or 4 fathoms {5 m 5 or 7 m 3) there are overfalls; in the deeper parts the bottom is mud, but the shoaler patches are of rock or sand. Chart 748b.Chap. VI.] GREAT PEARL BANK 191 Chart 2837b. Naita strait.—Tidal streams. —This passage is about 3| miles long, in a north-westerly and opposite direction, and about 6 cables wide between the reef on which stands Naita and that which fringes the coast south-eastward of Ras Masheirib. The least depth in 5 the channel is about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), and it is the onlv known navigable passage leading northward inshore of the extensive reefs already referred to. The deepest water is on the Naita side of the strait, and when passing that islet caution must be exercised for a spit extends from 10 the mainland nearly halfway across the channel; after passing Naita, the strait widens. Foul ground extends for a distance of about one mile north westward from Ras Masheirib {Lat. 24° 17' N., Long. 51° 45' E.), and also for about 3 miles in the same direction from Naita, at which 15 distance there is a small detached patch. The tidal streams in the strait are strong and set north-westward and south-eastward: but the times of their turning are not known. Ras Masheirib to Ras Bu Kamheiz. —Between Ras Masheirib 20 and Ras Bu Kamheiz, situated about 21 miles north-westward, are two comparatively small inlets and one large bay. Duhat an Nakhalah, immediately westward of Ras Masheirib, extends in a southerly direction for about 5 miles; between the reefs extending from either side, the width of its navigable part, in which 25 the depths are from 3 to 5 fathoms (5 m 5 to 9 m l), is about half a mile; but one or two shoal patches lying in its entrance render it unsuitable for shipping. Duhat al Kawaisat, next westward of Duhat an Nakhalah, extends in a southerly direction for about 7 miles and within its entrance 30 is about 1| miles wide; it is stated that there are depths of 6 fathoms (ll 11 ^)) in the inlet, but its entrance is reported to be only 40 yards (36 m 6) wide between the reefs on either side and to have a depth in it of only 3 fathoms (5 m 5). The narrowest part of the entrance is between the western shore of the inlet and Al Fazaya. 35 Al Fazaya is an island lying close northward of the long point, separating Duhat al Kawaisat from Duhat an Nakhalah, to which point it appears to be connected by a shoal; the island is about 50 feet (15 m 2) high, and is light in colour as is the neighbouring coast; it has a level top and its sides are cliffy. 40 Ras al Hazra, situated about 10 miles west-north-westward of Ras Masheirib is very low, rocky, and shelving. Several rocky islets lie on the reef that extends about half a mile offshore between the entrance of Duhat al Kawaisat and Ras al Hazra. From Ras al Hazra, the coast trends west-south-westward for about 15 miles 45 and thence north-north-eastward for about 20 miles to Ras Bu Kamheiz. Khor adh Dhuwaihin is situated at the head of the large bay thus formed. No information subsequent to that obtained during the survey of 1823 is available concerning the bay, the shores of 50 which consist, except in the vicinity of Kh5r adh Dhuwaihin, of low white hills; the bay contains many shoal patches and the depths nowhere exceed 10 fathoms (18 m 3) being in most places less; the bottom is mud.

Off-lying islets and dangers. — Directions. —Fareijat are two islets, lying northward and southward of one another and about 2 miles apart, the southern being situated about 6 miles eastward of 10 Ras al Hazra; they are about 20 feet (6 m l) high, table-topped, and light in colour. They lie at the south-western extremity of the great chain of reefs that extends northward from Yasat and appear to be connected by a shoal. Jezair Ghara is a group of flat-topped islets lying within a distance 15 of about 5 miles north-westward of Ras al Hazra; the group consists of a number of rocky islets one of which is larger than the others. Shoal patches lie about one mile north-eastward of the group; a detached 3-fathom (5 m 5) patch lies about 6 miles northward of Ras al Hazra; and there is an extensive patch of foul ground north- 20 westward of the Ghdra group. Vessels should pass eastward of these shoals, A detached shoal, over which there is a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), lies about 3 miles north-north-eastward of Ras al Hazra; a shoal, over which there is a depth of one fathom (l m 8), lies close northward 25 of the 2-fathom (3 m 7) shoal and extends in that direction for nearly 5 miles. Vessels should pass westward of these shoals. Caution is necessary when passing between the foregoing shoals and a good look-out is essential for undiscovered shoals may exist in the channel, in which latter the least depth appears to be 5 fathoms 30 (9 m l). Miyamat entin, situated between 4 and 7 miles northward of the northern Fareijat islet, are three very low islands lying north and south on the great reef that extends northward from Fareijat islets. For over 15 miles eastward of Miyamat entin, the sea is reported 35 to be encumbered with shoals having no passage between them, but the area has not been examined. Jezfrat Kafai {Lat. 24° 35' N., Long. 51° 44' E.), situated about 12 miles eastward of Ras Bu Kamheiz, is a low island on which are tufts of grass. A shoal extends for about 2^ miles southward 40 from the island, and another, which has not been examined and may be connected to the island, lies about 4| miles north-north-westward of it. There are several 5-fathom (Q 111 !) patches, and one 4-fathom (7 m 3) patch, westward of these shoals. Khor al 'Odaid.—Dangers. — This inlet trends in' a south- 45 westerly direction along the north-western side of the promontory of which Ras Bu Kamheiz is the eastern extremity. The south eastern shore of the inlet consists of rocky hills, but on the north western side are sand hills from 50 to 80 feet (15 m 2 to 24 m 4) high, round in shape, perfectly white, and quite barren. The khor is 50 frequented in winter by fishermen who remain some months; very fine mullet are to be caught. Jabal al 'Odaid, at the north-eastern end of the rocky hills, is situated about 5 miles north-westward of Ras Bu Kamheiz; it consists of two hills, the north-eastern of which rises immediately Chart 748b.Chap.

On the southern side of the entrance of the khor, between its outer entrance pomt and a low rocky point 2| miles farther west ward, there is a sandy beach on which are three wells of tolerable water and the rums of a village. ^5 A reef, on which are three rocks, extends for a distance of about one mile eastward and half a mile northward of the southern entrance point of the khor. {Lat. 24° 37' NLong. 57° 27' E.) A reef, on the edge of which are three small rocks, extends north ward from the inner pomt for a distance of about half a mile. 20 A sandy shoal extends along the northern shore of the entrance or a distance of about 2 miles; there is deep water between its khSr- 1 a s h ore » but there is no passage through into the '^ e P arro / y channel into the khor, in which there is a depth of 25 one fathom (1^8), lies between the sandy shoal and the reefs extending rom the southern shore. Farther in, there are depths in the channel of from 2 to 4 fathoms (3 m 7 to 7 m 3). Anchorage.—Directions.— Anchorage may be obtained off the northern outer entrance point of Khor al 'Odaid at a distance of 30 about 2 cables offshore, in depths of from 6 to 10 fathoms (llmO to 18 m 3), sand and shells; it is just inside a slightly projecting sandy point, off which there is no reef, and northward of the sandy shoal in the entrance of the khor; from it the north-eastern summit of Jabal al 'Odaid bears 170°. 35 It is difficult to estimate the distance from the white sandhills on the north-eastern side of the khor, which appear farther off than they are in reality. The anchorage is sheltered from the shamal and, owing to the extensive reefs seaward of it, the nashi does not raise very much 40 sea. Vessels approaching the anchorage should keep rather towards the shore northward of it, to avoid the outer end of the sandy shoal in the entrance of the khor. The north-eastern summit of Jabal al 'Odaid bearing 260° leads 45 northward of Fasht Umm Janna, which latter shows up well and is steep-to. Khor al Odaid to Ras al Allach.—Off-lying dangers .—From the northern entrance point of Khor al 'Odaid, the coast trends north- north-eastward for about 18 miles to a position about 4 miles 50 northward of which is Ras al Allach. Jabal Naqiyan is a range of high white sandhills fringing the coast for the first 18 miles northward of Khor al 'Odaid. Between Khor al 'Odaid and Fasht al Arrif, which latter extends Chart 748h. 5400X94 PERSIAN GULF— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. souTh-faslward from Ras al Allach, there are a great number of oatehes in the offing, but near the coast there is more open water. P A small shoal patch lies in the fairway, about 6 nnles north- 5 north-eastward of Jabal al 'Odaid and about one mile offshore, with a 3-fathom (5»5) patch about 2 miles north-eastward of it A one -fathom (Us) patch, with depths of 3 fathoms (o^o) within a distance of over one mile eastward of it, lies about 11 miles south- south -westward of Ras al Allach, and about one mile offshore. 10 There are doubtless other patches which have yet to be discovered, but a good look-out will enable a vessel to avoid them, no attempt, however, should be made to navigate with the sun ahead. Las hat is a group consisting of two rocky flat-topped islets and several detached rocks lying about 12 miles north-eastward 75 of Tabal al 'Odaid {Lat. 24° 36' N., Long 51 26 E )] the islets have light-coloured cliffs and lie about one mile apart. / ln , ox A shoal ridge, over which there are depths of one fathom (18) in places, extends southward for about 2 miles from a position about 2i miles south-south-westward of Las hat group. 20 A bank of white sand that barely covers, and from which other banks extend north-westward for a distance of about 2 2 miles, lies about 3 miles north-eastward of Las hat group. Machasib, lying about 14 miles east-south-eastward of Las hat group and about 7 miles north-eastward of Kafai, is a flat locky 25 islet, about 7 feet (2^1) high, that is surrounded by a reef extending about U miles from it. A channel about one mile wide, m which the depths are from 4 to 5 fathoms (7^3 to 9^1), separates the reef surrounding Machisib from an extensive shoal south-eastward of it, the limits of which have not been determined. 30 Halat Dalma is a small sandbank, nearly covered at high water lying about 1U miles north-eastward of Machasib. It is situated on, and about 2 miles from the western side of, an extensive reef the limits of which have not been determined, its south-eastern side being almost unexplored. There is no safe channel through or 55 near this reef. , . , o -i Fasht al 'Odaid, the western edge of which lies about 8 miles east-north-eastward of Las hat, is partly dry. The channel between it and Machdsib is about 3 miles wide and m it are overfalls. Fasht al Arrif is a long narrow spit extending south-eastward 40 from Ras al Allach for a distance of about 7 miles. From its extremity, the coast is rarely visible, but by day the reef shows up well; the apparent end of the reef should be given a berth of about one mile, for there is a depth of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) at a distance ot about 6 cables off it. The tidal streams set strongly over the reef, 45 and must be guarded against. The channel between Fasht al Airit and Fasht al 'Odaid is about 3| miles wide and is the best by which to approach Khor al 'Odaid. Jezirat Mishiryat is a low islet on Fasht al Arrif about 5 miles west-north-westward of its outer extremity. A channel, about 50 1^ miles wide, leads between the islet and the coast at the northern end of the Naqiyan range into an extensive backwater that has not been examined. , Ras al Allach, situated about 3 miles northward of Jezirat Mishiryat, is the northern entrance point of the backwater. Chart 748b./^s Chap. VI.] QATAR PENINSULA—EASTERN SIDE 195 Chart 2837b. Ras al Allach to A1 Wakrah .-Off-lying dangers From Ras al Allach, the coast trends northward for about 11| miles to Al Wakrah, and as far as Jabal Wakrah, situated about one mile southward of that town, consists of a low sandy or stony desert 5 fringed by a coastal reef that extends from 1| to 2 miles offshore. Umm al Hul [Lat. 25° 05' N., Long. 51° 37' E.) is a small low point, about 6 miles northward of Ras al Allach, that projects but slightly from the line of the coast. The width of the channel between the coast in the vicinity of Umm al Hul and the off-lying 10 reefs has not been determined, but it may be as much as 6 or 7 miles. The depths in the channel are from 6 to 14 fathoms (ll m 0 to 25 m 6) and are fairly regular; but several ridges of coral and rock lie from 4 to 6 miles eastward of Al Wakrah; they run north and south and are some 40 yards (36 m 6) wide; the depths over them are 5 fathoms 15 (9 m l) or less, with 14 to 17 fathoms (25 m 6 to 31 m l) between them; other shoals, the presence of which is as yet unknown, may exist in the channel. Rak Kareinein, an off-lying mass of shoals, extends for a distance of 20 miles in a northerly direction from a position close northward 20 of Fasht al 'Odaid; it has a breadth of from 10 to 15 miles and on it are a number of patches that dry and have deep water between them; but there is no known channel through them. A narrow channel, in which the depths are from 7 to 9 fathoms {12 m 8 to 16 m 5), was found by H.M.S. Philomel, in 1911, to lead 25 between Fasht al 'Odaid and Rak Kareinein. There is a blind channel, about 2 miles northward of the eastern entrance of the real channel, that leads about 2 miles westward into the reefs and then ends abruptly. Halat Bui Khaifan is a small shoal, that is said to dry, on the 30 north-eastern side of Rak Kareinein. Caution is necessary in the vicinity of Rak Kareinein, as the shoals have not been surveyed, and may extend farther northward than charted; it is possible, also, that out-lying patches may exist. It is recommended that, when navigating in these waters, a boat should be sent to sound ahead of the ship, as the sighting of the shoals, or the discolouration of the water over them, cannot be entirely relied upon. The tidal streams, through and over the reefs southward of the parallel of 25° 15' N., set westward and eastward, but the times of 40 their turning are not known. Al Wakrah.—Shoal.—Anchorage. —This large town, divided into two parts by an inlet forming a boat harbour, is situated on the shore of a bay which recedes about three-quarters of a mile from the general line of the coast. A castle, with two towers, the 45 larger of which is high and square, stands about three-quarters of a mile inland of the southern part of the town; in the northern part of the town is a large fort having three towers. A large and conspicuous white building stands close to the foreshore in the centre of the town. Supplies are scarce; fish and water can be 50 obtained in small quantities. Jabal Wakrah, situated close to the coast, about one mile south ward of the town, is a brown level-topped rocky hill, 85 feet (25 m 9) high. Chart 748b.196 PERSIAN GULF— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI.

Sphinx. in 1903 the depths in the vicinity of A1 Wakrah were considered to be generally somewhat shoaler than those shown on chart 2837b. Anchorage may be obtained by a small vessel m a depth of 2| fathoms (5 m 0) sand and clay, with the highest tower in the fort ™ hearing 299° and the high tower of the castle bearing 232°. Larger vessetemay anchor eastward of the town, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12^8). at a distance of about 3 miles offshore. In 1931, H.M.S. Hastings anchored with the conspicuous white building bearing about 276° and Ras Abul Mushut, seg below, bearing 345°. A depth of about 15 21- fathoms (4 m 6) was found about one cable southward of this position and it is considered that a better anchorage would be at a short distance north-eastward. A large purple patch was observed north-westward of the anchorage. Landing is protected from northward and eastward by a high 20 sandbank. There is a coral reef off the town which boats should go round, though such craft may cross it at high water. Chart 2830. ^ xt j Approaches to Doha.— Shoals.—Tidal streams.—Northward of Jabal Wakrah the coast generally, except near Doha, is low. In 25 the neighbourhood of Doha, situated about 10 miles north-north westward of Jabal Wakrah, there is some slightly higher rocky ground. The approaches to Doha, northward of the parallel of that place, are clear of off-lying dangers; but reefs continue to fringe the coast and extend in places as much as 10 miles offshore, the bottom becoming 30 visible before the land is sighted. The tidal streams set southward and northward along the coast; but the times of their turning are not known; they attain a rate of about one knot. * i ,*7 , i Ras Abul Mushut, situated about 6 miles northward of A1 Wakrah, 35 is the south -eastern entrance point of Doha harbour; it is low and rocky, but shows up well against the sandy coast in its vicinity. A reef extends for a distance of about half a mile eastward of the point and also for 2 miles northward from it. Jezirat Aliyah {Lat. 25° 24' N., Long. 51° 34' £.), situated about 40 8 miles north -north-westward of Ras Abul Mushut, is small and brown in colour, though in certain lights it appears white; at its eastern end it has a small peak, about 30 feet (9 m l) high. There is a boat channel westward of the islet, but it can only be used at high water. 45 Shoals, over which the general depths are from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 5), extend for a considerable distance offshore between Ras Abul Mushut and Jezirat Aliyah; but depths of 1| and If fathoms (2 m 7 and 3 m 2) are found, respectively, at a distance of about 4 miles north-eastward of the former and 5^ miles east-south- 60 eastward of the latter; the shoals obstruct the approach to Doha harbour, and continue southward for some distance from the l£- fathom (2 m 7) patch. In 1921, the depths in the approach to the harbour were reported to be less than charted; but in 1931, H.M.S. Folkestone obtained soundings in agreement with the chart. Charts 2837b, 748b.Chap. VI.] QATAR PENINSULA—EASTERN SIDE 197 Chart 2830. A detached shoal, over which there is a depth of 3| fathoms lies about 9 miles eastward of Jezirat Aliyah; but its position is not accurately known. Chart 2837b, plan of Doha harbour. 5 In addition to the fort at Doha, see page 199, a white castle stands nearly 2| miles north-north-westward of it, with two round and three square towers; in 1924, it was reported that the castle was difficult ! dentif y&gt; but, in 1931, H.M.S. Hastings saw it plainly from a position eastward of Jezirat Aliyah; and H.M.S. Folkestone reported 10 that when entering in the morning it appeared as a long white streak on the foreshore with a fort having two towers distinguishable at its southern end. A small buff-coloured castle, with two square towers, stands about one mile south-westward of the white castle; it may sometimes be seen before other objects in the harbour and 15 may be used as a mark by which to enter, at other times it is not readily identified. These castles and towers may, owing to re fraction, be visible at a distance of 12 or 14 miles. Between the buff castle and the white castle there is a large dark clump of trees on the flat-topped stony hills, which is a useful mark as there are 20 no other trees on the western side of the harbour. Doha harbour.—Beacon. —This harbour is in the southern part of a bay the shore of which trends westward and northward from Ras Abul Mushut {Lat. 25° 17' N., Long. 51° 37' E.). It is almost enclosed by reefs and, over an area about 3 miles in extent, 25 the depths are about 4 fathoms (7 m 3); but in its entrance, and also in its western part, the depths are less. The land on the southern and western sides of the harbour consists of flat-topped stony hills from 40 to 50 feet (12 m 2 to 15 m 2) high, and, with the exception of a little cultivated ground near the wells, 30 about 1J miles south-eastward of the town, the whole country is desert. Jezirat as Safliyah, on the northern side of the harbour, is low and sandy, and from its eastern and western ends, respectively, sand spits extend south-eastward and south-westward; between 35 the extremity of the latter sand spit and an extensive reef that fills the western side of the bay and almost dries, is a narrow channel leading into a basin, westward of the islet, in which there are depths of from l| to 3| fathoms (2 m 7 to 6 m 4). Ras Bu Abut, situated about 2| miles west-north-westward of 40 Ras Abul Mushut is low, and the intervening coast is fronted by a shallow rocky reef that extends in a north-easterly direction for over If miles offshore. In 1931, it was reported that the point projects farther northward than charted. A circular masonry beacon, about 12 feet (3 m 7) in height, stands 45 near the northern extremity of the reef, on the southern side of the entrance of Doha harbour; it is not easily identified, and, at a distance, it resembles a rock. A reef, over which the depths are from 2 to 6 feet (0 m 6 to l m 8), leasts' roc k and sand, extends for a distance of about one mile southward 50 and eastward from the eastern end of Jezfrat as Safliyah. The entrance of the harbour is between the reefs extending north- roackto* ward from Ras Abul Mushut and those extending south-eastward 531,P- from Jezfrat as Safliyah; in 1931, the least depth on the track recom- chaii Charts 2830, 2837b, 748b.jgg PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2837b, plan of Doha harbour. mended was 2^ fathoms (4^1). Vessels drawing up to 10 feet (3^0) can enter at low water, and at high water the harbour is available to vessels drawing up to 16 feet (4 m 9). , , „ „ 5 Ras Nessa, situated about miles westward of Ras Bu Abut, is a low projecting rocky point on which are the ruins of a fort, but they are not easily identified. A spit, the extremity of which nearly dries, projects in a northerly direction for about 3 cables from the point. In the small bay westward of the point are several 10 shoal patches that show up plainly. Directions.—Anchorage. —As the coast northward of Doha cannot be sighted, vessels from northward should steer southward, parallel with it, keeping in depths not less than 5 fathoms (9 m l) until east-north-eastward of Jezirat as Safiiyah, when that islet, 15 which forms a useful mark, should be steered for, care being taken to avoid the detached 3^-fathom (6 m 4) patch eastward of it. Having sighted Jezirat as Safiiyah, from a position about 6 miles eastward of it, course may be shaped to pass eastward of the 1|- fathom (3 m 2) patch in the approach to Doha harbour south-eastward 20 of it. When the centre of Doha fort, see page 199, bears about 247°, it may be approached on that bearing, w^hich leads between the If and 1 ^-fathom (3 m 2 and 2 m 7) patches; the greatest caution is, however, necessary when approaching the reefs. 25 From north-eastward or eastward, vessels should first sight Jezirat Halul, see page 200, and having done so should bring it to bear 065°; thence course 245° should be made good until the centre of Doha fort bears 247° whence the foregoing directions should be followed. 30 Should the vessel get too far southward and Jabal Wakrah {Lat. 25° 09'N., Long. 51° 37' E.) be sighted, extreme caution is necessary as she may be in dangerous proximity to Rak Kareinein. The reefs at the entrance of Doha harbour are best seen from seaward early in the forenoon; the best time for leaving is late in the after- 35 noon; at other times they are very difficult to make out. They are more clearly visible at low water, when a small vessel can enter guided by the eye and by sounding. A vessel of moderate size should await the rise of the tide, and, while doing so, may anchor about 6 miles eastward of Jezirat Aliyah. 40 Approaching the entrance in the forenoon, with the centre of Doha fort bearing 247°, the channel will be plainly seen from aloft; the reef on its northern side will then be of a dark purple colour, while that on its southern side will be of light sand colour. The southern reef extends about 1J cables northward of the beacon; 45 but the deeper water is stated to be on that side of the channel. In the vicinity of the beacon, while the tidal stream was setting northward, a sudden southerly set has been experienced. Having entered the harbour, vessels should steer to pass about 1| cables northward of the spit extending from Ras Nessa and should 50 anchor, about half a mile offshore, with the low tower of A1 Bida fort, see page 199 bearing about 245°; in this position there are depths of from 2| to 3 fathoms (4 m 6 to 5 m 5) and the vessel will be outside the native vessels and clear of the foul ground on the western side of the bay.

Doha town. —This town, divided into several quarters, is situated at the head of the harbour; it is partly walled and in it are several towers. 15 The Shaikh's house, situated about one quarter of a mile south eastward of Ras Nessa {Lat. 25° 17' N., Long. 51° 33' E.), is not easily identified by a stranger; it has many columns and an open balustrade round the roof; on it is a small flagstaff that does not always show up well as it is erected on the lower portion of the 20 building, the higher portion being behind it. Between the Shaikh's house and Ras Nessa, a very conspicuous minaret stands close to the shore in front of a large building with many colonnades. This minaret looks like a lighthouse and is a useful mark by which to identify Ras Nessa, for the point does not 25 show up at a distance. Doha fort, situated about one mile westward of Ras Nessa, is of a light colour and very conspicuous; it is a very large courtyard- type square building with towers at its corners; these towers resemble square houses with colonnades and verandahs; built into the centre 30 of the north-western wall of the fort is a round tower. Close south eastward of the fort is a white mosque with a conspicuous minaret at its northern end; this minaret has many colonnades and is a useful mark by which to identify the fort. The small minaret, shown on the plan on chart 2837b, close to 35 Ras Nessa fort, could not be identified by H.M.S. Folkestone in 1931; and the minaret near the white house south-westward of Ras Nessa was not easily made out. A1 Bida or Gutteh fort, situated about one-quarter of a mile north-westward of Doha fort, is a long, low, inconspicuous fort iO with a low tower at its south-eastern corner; the fort merges into the ruins, shown on the plan on chart 2837b, north-north-westward of it. On the high ground behind these two forts stands a small fort in front of which is a tall black flagstaff with stays. 45 Most of the inhabitants of Doha are employed in connection with the pearl fishery. Fish and meat can be procured in the bazaar, but, in 1913, the natives were by no means friendly. Water is indifferent in quality and limited in quantity. 50 Chart 2830. Ras Qutaifan to Ras Laffan.—Shoals. —Northward of Doha, the land is chiefly a stony desert with here and there a few hillocks; farther northward it becomes very low. The bottom close to Charts 2837b, 748b.200 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2830. the coast is of white sand or rock and usually shows up well in the clear water. Ras Qxitaifan, situated about 4 miles north-westward of Jezirat 5 Aliyah, projects but'slightly from the line of the coast and is probably some 50 feet (15 m 2) high, that is, slightly higher than the adjacent coast. Ras an Nof, situated about 10 miles northward of Ras Qutaifan is a low rocky point; the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line, within which the 10 bottom is foul, lies about 4 miles eastward of it. Duhat Lusail is a slight indentation in the coast between Ras Qutaifan and Ras an Nof. It is shallow, but is frequented by pearl boats, which run in over the shoal extending from its shore, for shelter from the shamal. 15 The coastal bank, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) and on which are a number of drying patches, extends offshore between Ras Qutaifan and Ras an Nof for a distance of from 4 to 11 miles; its most easterly point is situated about 10 miles east- north-eastward of Ras Qutaifan. 20 Ras al Matbakh is situated about 3 miles north-north-eastward of Ras an Nof; there is a drying sandbank about 3 miles eastward of the point. Ardh an Nof is a reef that nearly dries and lies about 3 miles south-eastward of Ras al Matbakh. 25 Khor Shakik is a creek or backwater that is entered south-west ward of Ras al Matbakh; there is a depth of about 6 feet (l m 8) in its entrance. Near the khor is a small village in which are several towers. {Lat. 25° 40' N., Long. 51° 31' E.) Halat Gabir, a low islet on which is a cairn, lies close offshore 30 about one mile north-eastward of Ras al Matbakh. Khor Dhakhirah, entered about 3| miles northward of Ras al Matbakh is small and shallow. Fasht el Yabis, over which the depths are less than 6 feet (l m 8), extends northward for about 3 miles from a position about 3| miles 35 north-eastward of Ras al Matbakh; it lies about 2|- miles offshore abreast the entrance of Khor Dakhirah. The 3-fathom (5 m 5) line lies about 2J miles eastward of Fasht el Yabis. In 1879, H.M.S. Beacon observed a series of shoal patches, about 6 miles offshore, extending for a distance of about 8 miles northward 40 of Ras al Matbakh. The depth over these shoals appeared to be about 4 feet (l m 2) with from 16 to 20 feet (4 m 9 to 6 m l) inside them; they were plainly seen during daylight and soundings gave warning of their proximity; as the coast is very low, the distance from it may have been over-estimated. 45 In 1910, it was reported that the depths inside the 10-fathom (18 m 3) line, north-eastward of the foregoing shoals, are less than those shown on chart 2830. A detached 6|-fathom (ll m 9) shoal lies about 10 miles eastward of Fasht el Yabis. 50 Ras Laffan, situated about 14 miles northward of Ras al Matbakh, is very low and sandy; the coastal reef does not extend much more than half a mile off it. Jezirat Halul. —This island, situated just within the edge of the Great Pearl bank about 49 miles east-south-eastward of Ras Charts 2837b, 748b.Chap. VI.] great pearl bank 201 Chart 2830. Laffan, and about 45 miles southward of Shah Allum shoal, see page 147, is hilly and rises to an elevation of 192 feet (58 m 5). It is fringed by a reef that in places extends offshore for a distance of about 2 cables; shoal water extends northward and north- 5 eastward of the island for a distance of about 6 cables. The island is visited by the pearl boats; but it is quite barren and waterless. The depths in the vicinity of the island {Lat. 25° 41'N., Long. 52° 25' E.) do not give much warning of its proximity, and there are great overfalls all round it; between 15 and 20 miles from the island, and also about one mile off it, the depths are from 10 to 14 fathoms (18 m 3 to 25 m 6). Small detached patches, over which the depths respectively are 6, 6, 7 and 7 fathoms (llmO, llm-0, 12 m 8 and 12 m 8), lie about 14 miles west-north-westward, 26 miles east-south-eastward, 20 miles south-south-eastward, and 23 15 miles south-westward of the island. Chart 2837b, plan of Halul island anchorage. Anchorage. —Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) about 3 cables off the south-eastern coast of Jezirat Halul; but, during a shamal, much swell rolls round the island, 20 and the bottom, being patches of sand and rock, is not very good holding ground. July 1925, H.M.S, Cyclamen anchored, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8), with the 192-foot (58 m 5) summit bearing 310°, and the eastern extremity of the island bearing 353°. A strong shamal 25 was blowing at the time and the cable was veered to 5 shackles (114 m 3); the holding ground was found to be good. About 100 dhows belonging to the pearl fishing fleet were sheltering under the lee of the island at the time. Landing may be effected at a gap in the low cliff south-westward 50 of a sandy beach north-westward of the anchorage; but it is only suitable for boats of light draught, and, as there are many rocky patches near it, it should not be attempted in heavy weather. During south-easterly winds, landing at this place would be dangerous; but there is then a more Sheltered place on the south-western part 35 of the island. Chart 2837h. Ras Laffan to Ras Rakan. —From Ras Laffan, the coast trends in a general north-westerly direction for about 24 miles to Ras Rakan, and, except off the latter point, there are no off-lying 40 dangers, the 3 and 5-fathom (5 m 5 and 9 m l) lines lying respectively about 1| and 3| miles offshore. A1 Huwailah, situated about 6 miles west-north-westward of Ras Laffan, is a small town in which is a square fort some 30 feet (9 m l) high. Westward of the town is a small bay in which the 45 depths are shallow, the shore reef extending about 1| miles off the beach. Ras al Maruna, situated about 4| miles north-westward of A1 Huwailah, is the point at the northern end of the foregoing bay; it affords shelter from the shamal to the pearl boats which anchor 50 close inshore southward of it. Fuwairat, situated about 2 miles north-westward of Ras al Maruna, on the shore of a small inlet, is a walled village in which Chart 748b. 5400 G*202 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VI. Chart 2837b. are several towers; immediately northward of it are some small white sandhills. A1 Ghariyah, situated at the northern end of the sandhills about 5 one mile northward of Fuwairat, is a deserted village in which are the ruins of a large fort. Ras Umm Hasah is situated about 6 miles north-north-westward of Ras al Maruna; it rises to a rocky hillock, some 20 feet (6 m l) high. The coastal reef extends about one mile off the point, and 10 the depths are reported to be shoal for some distance farther off. Boats obtain shelter from the shamal close inshore southward of the point. Ras Rakan, situated about 8| miles north-westward of Ras Umm Hasah, is the north-western extremity of a narrow islet about 2 15 miles in length; the greater part of the islet is less than one cable wide, very low, and with tufts of grass upon it; at its western end, however, is an extension that increases its width to about one mile. The islet lies about one mile within the edge of the coastal reef that fringes the northern end of the peninsula of Qatar and about 20 miles off the coast of the latter, from which it can be reached, at low water, by wading. Native boats shelter southward of the islet. The 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies about 3| miles northward of Ras Rakan, and there is a 2f-fathom {5 m 0) patch about 2 miles north-north-westward of the point. 25 A small rocky mound, that is conspicuous from seaward, stands on the mainland, about 2| miles south-eastward of Ras Rakan. Ar Ruwais, not shown on chart 2837b but situated about 2^ miles southward of Ras Rakan {Lat. 26° 11' NLong. 51° 13' E.), is a small town, the northernmost on the peninsula of Qatar; when 30 approaching from northward, it becomes visible before Ras Rakan is sighted.

GENERAL REMARKS .—The whole coast between Ras Rakan sootbwarfi;: and Jezirat Bubiyan, situated about 260 miles north-westward, fenonlirt;; is a low sandy or stony desert with, here and there, a few small cbabout2; : hills. The only vegetation, except near A1 Katif, situated about 5 69 miles west-north-westward of Ras Rakan, and in the vicinity nseaward;: of one or two other towns where there are date trees, is the coarse of Ras 4 grass growing in tufts on the sandhills and the occasional small ituated air brushwood. For the first 180 miles, the coast is fronted by extensive .ong.Hrif reefs; and off it lie Bahrein, see page 208, and many low islets, 10 jofjw'j:. the outermost of the latter being about 53 miles offshore. With ^ the exception of a few towns, this coast is rarely visited by Europeans. Large tracts are without villages or any settled inhabitants, and it is probably unsafe to wander away from the towns on the mainland without an armed escort. 15 The coast westward of Ras Rakan {Lat.26°ll'N.,Long.51°13'E.) forms a great bay near the entrance of which is the large island of Bahrein. Reefs extend from the eastern side of Bahrein to within 5 miles of the west coast of Qatar and southward of them the bay has been but little explored. 20 In 1901-2, R.I.M.S. Investigator, drawing 14| feet (4 m 4), endeavoured to circumnavigate Bahrein starting from its western side; but between Ras al Bar, the southern extremity of the island, and Jezirat Hawar, off the coast of Qatar south-eastward of it, such a network of reefs and shoals were encountered that the attempt 25 had to be abandoned. For tidal streams, see page 223. APPROACHES TO BAHREIN FROM NORTH-EAST- WARD.—Ras Rakan to Ras as Sawad.—Coast. —Between Ras Rakan and Ras 'Ashairik, situated about 17 miles south-westward, 30 the coast is low and of so light a colour that it is difficult to pick it up by eye, especially when enveloped in the prevailing haze. A reef fringes this coast to within 4 miles of Ras Ashairik and extends from 2 to 3 miles offshore; it nearly all dries and is plainly visible in a good light; landing, except at high water, is very 55 difficult. Chart 748b. f204 PERSIAN GULF— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. Ras Bu Amran, situated about 2 miles south-south-westward of Ras Rakan, projects northward from the coast for a distance of nearly one milej it is low, but rises to a small rocky mound. 5 Abu Dhuluf is a small town, with four conspicuous towers on its fort, situated about I2 miles south-south-westward of Ras Bu Amran. , . ^ Khor Hasan, situated about miles south-westward of Ras Bu Amran, is a small and very compact walled Arab town standing 10 on the coast; at about half a mile northward of it is an islet on which is a low round tower. There are two small villages in ruins between Abu Dhuluf and Khor Hasan. Ras 'Ashairik, situated about 7 miles south-westward of Kh5r Hasan is low but prominent and rocky; on it are the ruins of a 15 look-out tower. A reef extends for a distance of about one cable from Ras 'Ashairik and between it and the reefs extending eastward from Bahrein island there are depths of from 2 to 3 fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 5). Eastward of the point is a shallow bay that extends some distance southward. On the eastern side of the bay are the 20 ruins of the once important town of Zubarah. In 1902, the old fort, though fast crumbling away, was still conspicuous. The shores of the bay and the coast immediately northward of it are sandy, and dry out for a considerable distance. Danger.— Katat Ekhchejera is a rock, over which there is a 25 depth of 6 feet (l m 8), lying about 2 miles north-westward of Ras 'Ashairik; the sea breaks over it at low water, and at high water its presence is disclosed by an oily appearance of the surface and slight discolouration. Anchorage .—Anchorage may be obtained off Ras Ashairik; 30 vessels drawing up to 10 feet (3 m 0) may anchor, in a depth of 2| fathoms (S^), about half a mile north-westward of the point; vessels drawing 15 feet (4 m 6) should anchor, in a depth of 3^ fathoms (5 iri 9), about 5 miles north-north-westward of the point. Approaching these anchorages, vessels should make Ras Rakan 35 or Ras Bu Amran and steer south-westward along the edge of the reef, keeping a good lookout for indications of shoal water as this locality has not been closely surveyed. Coast. —From Ras 'Ashairik, the western coast of Qatar trends southward for about 28 miles to the head of Duhat al Adhwan, a 40 shallow inlet in which the greatest depth is 2 fathoms (3 m 7). The ruins of Rubeija, not shown on chart 2837b, are situated about 2 miles southward of Ras 'Ashairik, and there are no signs of habitation between them and Duhat al Adhwan. Forts and huts appear to have been constructed at Duhat al Adhwan shortly before 1902, 45 and there is frequent communication by boat with Bahrein. Jezirat Hawar is the westernmost and largest of a group of islands on the western side of the entrance of Duhat al Adhwan. The islands have been but little explored and the vicinity is shallow and unsurveyed. 50 Ras as Sawad {Lat. 25° 36' N., Long. 50° 50' E.) is the north western extremity of the mainland near the southern end of Jezirat Hawar; according to a native report, the coast for some distance north-eastward of Ras as Sawad consists of a chain of moderately high stony hills. Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] APPROACHES TO BAHREIN 205 Chart 2837b. Off-lying dangers.—Caution.— In 1930, the s.s. City of Baghdad reported the discovery of a distinct patch of discoloured water lying about 18 miles north-north-westward of Ras Rakan. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 3| fathoms (6 m 9), lies 5 about 13 miles north-north-westward of Ras Rakan; it has not been closely examined and should be avoided. Vessels of light draught can pass between it and Fasht ad Dibal situated farther south-westward, but those of deep draught should keep northward of it, and of the discoloured water north-north-westward of it, in 10 depths not less than 6 fathoms (llmO). Fasht ad Dibal, lying about 14 miles west-north-westward of Ras Rakan, dries in places, and its northern edge is fairly steep-to. On the north-eastern corner of the reef there is a beacon, not shown on chart 2837b, consisting of a pile of stones with a staff and small 15 black can as topmark; in 1931, the beacon was reported to be in a dilapidated condition. In a good light, the reef can be seen at all states of the tide. A detached 2-fathom (3 m 7) patch lies about 3 miles westward of its southern end, and a shoal, over which the depths are from one to 2f fathoms (1^8 to 5^0) extends for about 20 10 miles from Fasht ad Dibal, joining the reefs extending eastward from Bahrein. As the west-going tidal stream sets southward in the vicinity of Fasht ad Dibal, vessels should keep well northward of the reef. Katah ad Jaradeh lies south-westward of Fasht ad Dibal and is 25 separated from it by a channel, about 2\ miles wide, in which the depths are from 2 to 2f fathoms (3 m 7 to 5^0). It almost dries, and on its south-eastern side is a narrow strip of sand, about one mile long, parts of which only just cover; this sandbank, however, varies both in shape and size. 30 At a distance of about 8 miles, southward of Katah ad Jaradeh is the eastern extremity of the reefs extending some 15 miles or more eastward from Bahrein island, the whole space within that distance being apparently encumbered with shoals that, at present, are quite unexplored. 55 Northward of Bahrein reefs and westward of Katah ad Jaradeh {Lat. 26° 11' N., Long. 50° 54' E.), there are no shoals until the reefs off Muharraq island, sgg page 207, are approached. Shoals northward of Bahrein.— The edge of the Great Pearl bank extends in a west-north-westerly direction from a position 40 about 35 miles north-north-eastward of Ras Rakan ; the bank, northward of Ras Rakan, is called Abu Kharab and on it, in depths of from 9 to 20 fathoms (16^5 to 36^6), there are overfalls. Rennie shoal, the outermost danger on this part of the Great Pearl bank, lies about 60 miles north-north-westward of Ras 45 Rakan. It was discovered in 1848, and is about one mile in extent, the depth over it being 2 fathoms (3 m 7), rock. It lies about one mile within the extremity of a tongue of the bank that extends in a northerly direction, the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line passing close eastward and westward of it. 50 A detached patch, over which there is also a depth of 2 fathoms (3 m 7), rock, lies, on the same tongue of the bank, about 2f miles southward of Rennie shoal; there is no visible indication of the presence of either of the foregoing shoals. Chart 748h.206 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. A submerged obstruction, which a vessel is reported to have touched, in 1917, lies about 10|- miles south-south-eastward of Rennie shoal. Bu Athama {Lat. 26° 55' N., Long. 51° 01' E.), a. small detached 5 patch over which there is a depth of 6 fathoms (ll m 0), lies close inside the 20-fathom (36 m 6) line, about 19 miles south-eastward of Rennie shoal. In June, 1890, the British India s.s. Kilwa obtained soundings of from 3 to 5 fathoms (5 m 5 to 9 m l) about 5 miles west-south- 10 westward of Bu Athama; the bottom was visible, and, by the tide ripples round it, the shoal appeared to extend for a distance of about • one-quarter of a mile in an easterly and westerly direction. Bu Amama is an extensive bank, over which the depths are from 8 to 10 fathoms (14 m 6 to 18 m 3), lying from 12 to 18 miles southward 15 of Rennie shoal. A1 Ashira is an extensive pearl bank, over which the depths are from 3 to 10 fathoms (5 m 5 to 18 m 3), lying close westward of Bu Amdma; the shoalest spot lies about 17 miles south-south-westward of Rennie shoal. For shoals farther westward, see page 222. 20 A shoal, over which the general depths are from 4 to fathoms (7 m 3 to 8 m 7), lies with its centre about 22 miles south-south-westward of Bu Athama. A shoal patch, over which the depth is If fathoms (3 m 2), was discovered in 1924, on the eastern part of the shoal; but the locality has not yet been carefully examined. 25 Depths of 5J and 6 fathoms (9 m 6 and ll m 0) exist over a considerable area in the approach to Bahrein harbour, see page 209, northward of Fasht ad Dibal. A shoal, over which there is a depth of 4J fathoms (7 ni 8), lies about 9 miles north-westward of the northern end of Fasht ad 30 Dibal. An obstruction, reported by the s.s. City of Baghdad in 1930, lies close off the entrance of Bahrein harbour in a position about 12J miles west-north-westward of the northern end of Fasht ad Dibal; the vessel touched the obstruction when drawing 21^ feet 35 (6 m 5). Charts 20, 2837b. Fasht al Jarim. —Fasht al Jdrim is an extensive reef on the northern side of Bahrein harbour, that protects the latter from the shamal. Its middle and southern parts consist of rock and 40 sand, but its northern end is of coral; the whole reef shows up well at low water; on its northern end are black masses of decayed coral, at its southern end, called Jadam, is a large sandbank. Ras as Shab, the northern extremity of Fasht al Jarim, is out of sight of land, and caution is therefore necessary when approaching 45 it from northward. The northern end of Fasht al Jarim is fringed by a shoal, depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) being charted about 2 miles from it. Addla is a bank, over which the depths are about 2| fathoms (4 m 6), that extends north-westward from the northern end of Fasht 50 aA Jarim for a distance of about 3 miles. Haraka is a small bight in the eastern side of the reef, in which the depths are from one to 2 fathoms (l m 8 to 3 m 7), that affords shelter from the shamdl to pearl-fishing boats. Ras al Ain is on the eastern side of Fasht al Jarim about 4 miles Chart 748b.??5- Chap. \ II.] approaches to bahrein 207 Charts 20, 2837b. from its southern extremity; that side of the reef is fringed by a shallow flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), that extends eastward for 5 or 6 miles from Ras al Ain. Eastward of the southern extremity of Fasht al Jdrim, the 3- 5 fathom (5 m 5) line lies about one mile from the edge of the reef; but southward, the shoal extends into Bahrein harbour for about twice that distance. Kalai ah [Lat. 26° 25' NLong. 50° 29' E.), lying about 4f miles north-north-westward of the southern extremity of Fasht io al Janm, is a rock, on the reef, that dries about 6 feet (l m 8). Except at high water, it can usually be seen, when near the reef. For shoals on the western side of Fasht al Jdrim, see page 219, Charts 3380, 3540, 20. Muharraq island.— Light .—Beacons .—This island, situated i5 north-eastward of Bahrein island and separated from it by a narrow channel, is low and sandy; on it are several conspicuous groves of date palms about 40 feet (12 m 2) high, that are the first objects sighted when approaching in hazy weather, though, in clear weather, Jabal ad Dukhan, see page 208, will be seen just before them. See view 20 P on chart 2837b. Galali (Kalali) is a village, on the north-eastern extremity of the island, in which are two small towers, the eastern being the larger. Simahij, Dair, and Busaitin are villages, on the northern and western coasts of the island, at which there are date groves. See view on 25 chart 20. Reefs fringe the island and extend offshore for a distance of about 2 miles in places. A shallow flat, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends for a distance of about 4 miles north westward, 2| miles northward, and 3 miles eastward from the coasts 30 of the island. Landing is only possible when the tide is above mean sea level. Ras Khasaifah is the north-western extremity of the above- mentioned flats. Khaseifa, lying on the reefs northward of Muharraq island and about 3|- cables offshore, is a small rocky islet, 8 feet (2 m 4) 35 high. Between it and the coast of the island are several fresh-water springs that uncover. A white pole beacon, 50 feet (15 m 2) in height, with a cylindrical topmark, painted in black and white horizontal bands, has been erected on Khaseifa. 40 Fasht al Hadba, nearly 2| miles westward of Dair, is the north western extremity of the reefs extending in that direction from Muharraq island. Sajah (Saya), lying on the reefs about 8 cables offshore westward of Busaitin, is an islet, about 2 feet (0 m 6) high on which there is a spring of fresh water. 45 A white pole beacon, 35 feet (lO 111 ?) in height, with a cylindrical topmark, painted in black and white horizontal bands, has been erected on Sajah. Muharraq is a large town on the south-western point of the island. A light is occasionally exhibited, at an elevation of 128 feet 50 (39 m 0), from a flagstaff on the foreshore at Muharraq. Abu Mahur (Bu Mahir) is a square fort, with one large and three small towers, that is conspicuous from the anchorage at Bahrein; Charts 2837b, 748b.208 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Charts 3380, 3540, 20. it stands, about one cable southward of Muharraq town, on a low detached bank that becomes an islet at high water. The fresh water submarine spring,* from which the town was formerly chiefly 5 supplied, rises about 2^ cables south-eastward of the fort. A1 Hadd, a town situated on the long south-eastern point of Muharraq island, is conspicuous from eastward. From the point reefs extend southward and enclose Khor Kaliya on its eastern side, see page 214. 10 Arad peninsula extends south-westward, for a distance of about one mile, nearly midway between A1 Hadd and Muharraq towns; it is about half a mile wide and on its south-western part are the ruins of a large fort and a date grove. Charts 3380, 20. 15 Bahrein island.—Northern side. —The coasts of Bahrein island are low, and along the northern side is a belt of very fertile well- watered land from 2 to 3 miles wide that is covered with continuous date groves and lucerne, amidst which are a few gardens producing fruit and vegetables of indifferent quality. The remainder of the 20 island is uncultivated, owing chiefly to lack of water. From about 4 miles southward of the northern coast, a rocky tableland, from 100 to 150 feet (30 m 2 to 45 m 7) high, extends south ward for many miles and stretches across the island almost from side to side; the tableland rises on all sides in small cliffs. 25 Rifa 'a (Ar Rifa) is a village situated about 7 miles southward of the north-eastern extremity of the island ; it stands partly on and partly at the foot of the cliffs on the north-eastern side of the tableland; at the village [Lat. 26° 07' N., Long. 50° 34' E.) is a hill fort with several towers that attain an elevation of about 210 30 feet (64 m 0) and, on southerly bearings, are visible over the tree tops from seaward, though at times, owing to the growth of the trees they are difficult of identification even from aloft. Jabal ad Dukhan, situated about 12 miles from the northern end of the island and about midway between its eastern and western 35 coasts, is a small compact group of dark hills, 410 feet high; in clear weather it is the first part of the island to be sighted when approaching it; but, in 1913, it was reported that the hills could not easily be identified until nearing the entrance of the harbour. See view P on chart 2837a and view on chart 20. 40 Ras ar Rumman, the north-eastern extremity of the island and on which stands Manamah town, see page 212, is situated about 1| miles south-westward of Muharraq town. At a distance of about 2| miles south-westward of the point are the ruins of a large mosque with two minarets, each about 70 feet (21 m 3) high; the upper parts 45 of the minarets are visible over the tree tops until near the inner harbour and are good marks though not easily identified. The Portuguese fort, see view on chart 20, is situated about 3| miles westward of Ras ar Rumman; it stands, in ruins, in a gap in the date groves, about three-quarters of a cable from the beach and is 50 little better than a heap of stones; from seaward, it appears as a shapeless light coloured mass; in 1902, its highest part attained ♦Submarine springs are characteristic of these islands ; several are mentioned in the following pages ; often by putting down a hollow bamboo the fresh water will rise through it above sea level.

Shereiba is a village, about miles westward of the Portuguese fort, in which there is a tower, close to the beach, that is higher &lt;5 than the houses in it. Budaiya is a town, standing on the point at the north-western extremity of Bahrein island, about If miles south-westward of Shereiba. Reefs.—Beacon. —The northern coast of Bahrein island is 10 fringed with drying reefs that extend offshore for from half a mile to 11 miles. Depths less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) are found about 3 miles north-north-westward of Ras ar Rumman and 2| miles northward of the Portuguese fort. Fasht Rustan is a reef, westward of those extending from Muharraq 15 island, lying about 2-|- miles north-north-westward of Ras ar Rumman. Ras Zarwan, situated on the eastern side of the inner harbour, about If miles north-westward of Ras ar Rumman, is the western extremity of the reefs extending north-north-westward from that 20 point. A conical masonry beacon, about 12 feet (3 ia 7) in height and painted black with one broad white horizontal band, marks Ras Zarwan. In 1931, H.M.S. Hastings reported that the depths within a. 25 distance of about half a mile southward of Ras Zarwan beacon are considerably less than charted. Liya, about If miles northward of the Portuguese fort, is a rock that dries 3 feet (0 m 9), and from which foul ground extends west ward for a distance of about half a mile; it lies on the shoal spit 30 extending northward from the reefs abreast the Portuguese fort. Lighthouse rock, about 2 feet (0 m 6) high, lies on the edge of the reefs about one mile northward of the Portuguese fort; it is not conspicuous, being almost hidden by fishing stakes. Sala {Lat. 26° 16'N., Long. 50° 27' E.) is a detached drying 35 reef that lies about 2| miles north-westward of Shereiba; there are several shoal patches and rocks in its vicinity and the depths appear to be very uneven. Marwadi, about 2| miles northward of Sala, is a reef that covers at about high water and, when that occurs about mid-day, it is 40 very difficult to make it out, though its presence is usually disclosed by the birds upon it. West spit is the south-eastern extremity of a shoal, over which the depths are from 7 to 18 feet {2 m l to 5 m 5), that extends south eastward, into Bahrein harbour, for a distance of about 4f miles 45 from Marwadi; the shoal also extends south-westward from Marwadi for a distance of about 1| miles. Kh5r fasht, a coral reef on which there are two or three sand banks that dry 3 or 4 feet (0 m 9 or l m 2), lies with its south-eastern end about three-quarters of a mile northward of Marwadi and about 60 2f miles south-westward of Jadam. Its eastern edge usually shows up plainly, but it is said that it is very difficult to distinguish the reef at high water when that occurs about mid-day. Near the sandbank on the south-eastern side of the reef is a fresh-water Charts 2837b, 748b.210 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Charts 3380 , 20. spring, in a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9). It is difficult to find this spring except at low water with a smooth sea. A narrow channel, in which there is a depth of 15 feet (4 m 6), 5 separates Marwadi from Khor fasht. Rak al Yadda is a large sandbank, south-westward of Kh5r fasht, the extent of which has not been determined. A channel, which has a least width of 4 cables and in which the least depth is 20 feet (6 m l), separates Rak al Yadda from Khor 10 fasht. BAHREIN HARBOUR.—Buoyage .—Bahrein harbour lies, northward of Bahrein island, between West spit and the shoal on which lies Liya, on its western side, and the reefs and flat extending from Muharraq island, on its eastern side, with Fasht al Jdrim 15 and the shoal extending from it, on its northern side. Although Fasht al Jarim affords shelter from the shamdl it does not prevent a considerable sea, that is bad for boats, getting up in the outer harbour when that wind is strong; but communication with the shore is seldom interrupted, and vessels ride easily at anchor. 20 The inner harbour is a bight in the reefs west-north-westward of Manamah town [Lat. 26° 14' N., Long. 50° 35' £.); affording much better shelter than the outer harbour, it is suitable for small craft and is usually full of bagalas, but vessels drawing more than 15 feet (4 m 6) should not enter. The reefs bordering the inner harbour 25 are all flat and in a good light they show up well; there are numerous fish weirs on them, but with a few exceptions, they are all a long way inside the edge of the reef. Discoloured water often extends, westward of Khaseifa islet, across the harbour. The least depth in the fairway from seaward into the outer harbour 30 is 21 feet (G 11 ^), and thence into the inner harbour, 16 feet (4 m 9). A black light-buoy with a black topmark, exhibiting a white flashing light is established, northward of an 18-foot (5 m 5) patch in the entrance of Bahrein harbour, in a position about 6 miles north-north-eastward of Khaseifa islet. 35 A red can light-buoy, with a conical superstructure painted black, exhibiting a red flashing light every twenty-two seconds, is established, on the eastern end of a 21-foot (G 11 ^) patch in the northern approach to the harbour, in a position about 4 miles north-westward of Khaseifa islet. 40 These two light-buoys are maintained by the Government of India; they sometimes break adrift and cannot therefore be relied upon. A red conical buoy marks the extremity of West spit in a position about 2 miles north-north-westward of Ras Zarwan beacon. 45 Anchorage. —Suleisil or the outer harbour is approached with the Portuguese fort bearing 202°, or on the leading line shown on charts 3380 and 20 formed by the western shoulder of Jabal ad Dukhan in line with the western of the two minarets, about 2| miles south-westward of Ras ar Rumman, bearing 182°. The Portuguese 50 fort shows up well in the early morning but is difficult of identification after noon. The minarets are not easy to make out, but with the aid of glasses they appear as two small pointed towers showing just above the tree tops. The larger vessels able to enter the harbour anchor a little west- Charts 2837b, 748b.r?-f Chap. VII.] BAHREIN 211 Charts 3380, 20. ward of the leading line, in depths of from 24 to 30 feet (7 m 3 to 9 m l), about half a mile eastward of West spit buoy with the northern extremity of Muharraq island bearing between 085° and 090°. Vessels drawing up to 15 feet (4 m 6) anchor, close eastward of the 5 leading line, in depths of 18 or 19 feet or 5 m 8), with the fort southward of Muharraq town bearing 102°, and the western of the two minarets close southward of Manamah bearing 138°. Vessels of light draught anchor southward of Ras Zarwan beacon at a distance from it not less than half a mile, but caution is necessary 10 owing to the decreased depths in the vicinity. The minarets on the leading line become obscured by trees when nearing the inner harbour. The tidal stream which sets north eastward across the entrance of the inner harbour is appreciable, and caution is therefore necessary on that account also. The closer 15 in that a vessel is able to anchor the less is the sea that will be felt during a shamal. Good anchorage, completely sheltered from the shamal, may be obtained eastward of Jadam. Charts 3380, 20, 2837b. 20 Directions.—Caution. —Vessels approaching the entrance of Bahrein harbour should keep a good lookout from aloft for shallow patches as the locality has not been thoroughly surveyed. The 10-fathom (18 m 3) line, about 20 miles east-north-eastward of the outer light-buoy, is a good guide. During the summer months, 25 the sand-haze renders it, at times, difficult to pick up the outer light-buoy; but at other times it is often sighted before it is expected owing to mirage. During November, a thick early morning mist is frequently experienced and it is therefore then advisable to make the outer light-buoy at night rather than in the early morning. 30 Between February and April, also, an occasional thick sea-fog is experienced in the morning, but it usually clears by 1000 or 1100. During the pearl-fishing season, a great number of dhows anchor on the banks within a distance of 20 miles of the outer light-buoy, rendering caution necessary at night; these vessels are useful as 35 indicating the direction and strength of the tidal stream. Should a vessel approaching the harbour be set southward of the entrance, the clumps of date trees on Muharraq island, Galali tower {Lat 26° 16' N., Long. 50° 39' £■.), A1 Hadd village, Jabal ad Dukhan, and Rifa fort should be seen in time to ascertain the position 40 in safety. The edge of Fasht al Jarim is usually indicated by the pale green colour of the sea, especially in the early morning. The tidal streams set eastward and westward and both Fasht ad Dibal and Fasht al Jarim must be guarded against. 45 In clear weather, as Bahrein is approached, Jabal ad Dukhan may be sighted at a distance of about 25 miles; at about the same time the W /T mast at Manamah will come into sight*, and subsequently the date palms at Riya and the northernmost clumps of trees on Muharraq island will appear. 50 On nearer approach from northward, should the light-buoy be * Note. —It is reported that this W/T mast may, in the near future (1932) be removed. Chart 748b.212 PERSIAN gulf— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Charts 3380, 20, 2837b. adrift or out of position, Jabal ad Dukhan bearing about 208°, or Riya clump, which latter may be identified from northward by two white buildings close westward of it, bearing about 232°, 5 will lead in depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l) until Galali tower and the remaining clumps of trees on Muharraq island can be seen, and the position of the vessel fixed approximately. A least depth of 21 feet (6 m 4) may be assured by passing about one mile southward of the outer light-buoy and then steering westward iO until the inner light-buoy bears about 240°; thence vessels should steer to pass about one or 2 cables south-eastward of the inner light-buoy. When the western of the two minarets, situated about 2J miles south-westward of Ras ar Rumman, is in line with the western shoulder of Jabal ad Dukhan, bearing 182°, the leading 15 line may be followed and anchorage obtained as previously directed. Should the light-buoys be adrift or out of position, from the assigned position of the outer one, vessels should steer for Jabal adh Dhahran, see page 217, bearing about 264°; this will lead northward of Ras Khasaifah and the detached patches on the northern 20 edge of Muharraq island fiats, until the Portuguese fort bears 202°, when it should be steered for on that bearing which leads to the anchorage. Chart 3380. Manamah. —This, the principal town on, and the port of, 25 Bahrein island, is situated on Ras ar Rumman and has a frontage of about one mile along the coast south-westward of the point. The residence of the British Political Agent, with its flagstaff, is situated about one cable south-westward of the point. The flagstaff from which the B.I.S.N. Go's house flag is flown is conspicuous. The 30 W /T mast, 105 feet (32 m 0) in height, and a clump of date trees on rising ground, about 3| cables southward of Ras ar Rumman, are conspicuous, and near the latter is the Christian cemetery, surrounded by a high wall. There are two minarets close southward of the town; both show up well above the house-tops and the eastern one, 35 which can be seen from the outer light-buoy, is situated about 5J cables south-south-westward of the Agent's residence; at night, four lights are exhibited from the gallery of this latter minaret at a height of about 60 feet (18 m 3). The town is lighted by electricity. There is a considerable boat-building trade at Bahrein. 40 During the year 1930, 123 British and 11 German vessels called at Bahrein. [Lat. 26° 14' N., Long. 50° 35' E.) Climate and health. —The climate of Bahrein is unpleasant from April until October, being very hot with a high relative humidity; it is said, however, to be better than any of the other 45 ports on the Arabian coast of the Gulf. Very pleasant weather is experienced from November to March. Very strong north-westerly winds prevail; but they are varied during the hot weather, from the beginning of May till well into October, by south-easterly winds or calms, when the humidity is such that there is sometimes 50 a difference of only 2° between the dry and wet bulb thermometers at a temperature between 95° and 100°. The mean annual temperature is 78°. January being coolest (61°), and August hottest (92°). The daily range is only about 10°. Temperatures exceeding 100° may occur in any month from Charts 20, 2837h, 748b.Chap. VII.] BAHREIN 213 Chart 3380. May to October; the highest recorded is 109°, and the lowest 41°. The barih, or 40-days shamal, often makes the climate in June and July comfortably cool and pleasant. Manamah [Lat. 26° 14' N., Long. 50° 35' E.) is, away from 5 the bazaar, fairly free from insect pests. The average annual rainfall is 3 inches (76 mm ). See also Meteorological tables, page 286. The port of Bahrein, having a large population and a great dhow traffic, is naturally more liable to epidemics than the smaller ports; 10 since 1920, however, there have been no more epidemics in Bahrein than in any other of the larger Gulf ports. The endemic diseases are: smallpox; the enteric group of fevers; dysentery, both amoebic and bacillary ; malaria ; and all kinds of venereal disease. Europeans, however, are seldom attacked 15 if they observe the usual precautions. The epidemic diseases are plague and cholera. The former is always imported from India, either directly or through intermediate ports; since 1920, epidemics of this disease have arisen at intervals of 5 years, but under steadily improving quarantine supervision 20 they should tend to become still less frequent. The latter, cholera, is imported, usually, from 'Iraq; Bahrein is, however, less fre quently attacked than any other of the Gulf ports, and this is probably due to the fact that the water supply is less open to contamination. The Agency surgeon acts as Quarantine Officer 25 for the Government of Bahrein. Piers.—Lights.—Buoyage. —A stone pier about 150 yards (137 m 2) long, with an extension, projects in a north-westerly direction from a position close to the British Agency. A light is occasionally exhibited, at an elevation of 10 feet (3 m 0), from a black 30 and white staff at the head of the pier. At the steps, the pier dries out 2 feet (0 m 6). The Customs pier extends in a north-westerly direction from a position about 5| cables south-westward of the Agency pier; at very low tides, there is a depth of only about three-quarters of a 35 foot (0 m 2) alongside. On the pier is a 5-ton hand crane. A light is occasionally exhibited, at an elevation of 79 feet (24 m l), from a black iron framework beacon at the head of the Customs pier. A small black buoy consisting of a drum surmounted by a staff 40 and square topmark has been established about 5| cables north westward of the head of the Customs pier on the south-western side of the approach to the latter. A small black light-buoy, that occasionally exhibits a white fixed light, is established, in the approach to the Customs pier, about 45 1^ cables north-westward of the head of the latter. This light- buoy marks the channel, and boats approaching or leaving the pier should pass close to it. A small red mooring buoy is established, close north-westward of the reefs northward of the Customs pier, in a position about 2f 50 cables north-westward of the head of the pier. Port facilities.—Pilots. —It would appear that native pilots usually go out when they see a vessel approaching the harbour; but the services of a pilot would seem to be hardly necessary. Charts 20, 2837b, 748b.214 PERSIAN gulf— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 3380. There are two American hospitals at Manamah, one of which is for women and is run by a lady doctor; there is also a hospital attached to the British Agency. 5 Ample supplies of water are available both for drinking and for boilers; but the water contains a large percentage of magnesia, and should only be used for boilers in case of necessity. The supply is slow as it is brought off in small dhows of about 7 tons capacity and must be pumped on board by the ship. It is obtained 10 from artesian wells and the quality varies; it is always slightly brackish, and the temperature, 82° is the same from all the wells. Fresh meat and native bread are plentiful, but the supply of vegetables is limited. Bustard and sand-grouse exist, but are preserved by the Sheikhs i5 for hawking. Fishing is poor; the natives use as bait a peculiar kind of weed, of which a quantity may be obtained from the shore in front of the British Agency. The port possesses a number of motor launches and lighters and a large number of sailing cargo boats. All goods for Bahrein are 20 landed at the Customs-house at Manamah. Communications. —Communication with the mainland of Arabia is maintained by native craft; there is also much traffic in such vessels between Bahrein and ports on the Persian coast. There is an Indian post office at the British Agency. 25 For steamship communications, see page 28. For W/T communication, see page 29. Chart 3540. KHOR KALIYA.—Beacon .—This extensive khor lies eastward of the northern end of Bahrein island, and southward of Muharraq island; SO it is enclosed on its eastern and southern sides by reefs extending, respectively, southward and eastward from Muharraq and Bahrein islands. The only entrance available to shipping is at its south eastern corner; but there is a boat passage leading through the reefs westward of Muharraq island into its north-western corner. 35 The middle of the kh5r is occupied by a large shoal over which the depths are from 7 to 16 feet (2 II1 1 to 4 m 9), sand; but there is a considerable space round the shoal that affords good anchorage, sheltered from the shamal, in depths of from 18 to 45 feet (5 m 5 to 13 m 7), Kassar Diwan [Lat. 26° 12'N., Long. 50° 40' E.) is a rock, ^ about one foot (0 m 3) high, that lies on the southern extremity of the reefs that extend southward from A1 Hadd for a distance of about 3J miles and form the eastern side of Kh5r Kaliya. Kh5r Kaliya beacon is of iron and is surmounted by a black ball; it is 12 feet (3 m 7) high and stands nearly 2 cables within the eastern 45 edge of the reefs on the western side of the entrance of the khor, at a distance of about half a mile westward of Kassar Diwan. The entrance, between Kassar Diwan and the reefs on which stands Khor Kaliya beacon is about 2 cables wide; but it is obstructed by a bar, 120 yards (lOQ^) wide at its narrowest part, that stretches 50 from reef to reef and is steep-to. A shoal, over which the least depth is 11 feet (3 ni 4), lies just outside the entrance; but deep channels on either side of it lead up to the bar. The entrance channel across the middle of the bar, in which the Charts 20, 2837b, 748b.Chap. VII.] KHOR KALIYA 215 Chart 3540. depths are from 12 to 16 feet (3 m 7 to 4 m 9), is about 60 yards (54 m 9) wide; it shoals abruptly on its eastern side and but gradually on its western side; the depths in the remainder of the entrance channel, which is steep-to on both sides, are from 25 to 54 feet (7 m 6 to 16 m 5). 5 Southward of the entrance of Kh5r Kaliya are the reefs that extend from the whole of the eastern side of Bahrein island towards Ras 'Ashairik, see page 204. Sitrah is an island, south-westward of the entrance of Khor Kaliya, between which and Bahrein island is a narrow channel 10 part of which latter dries. Mahana as Saghira, see chart 20, is a small fishing village at the southern end of the island of Sitrah; there is apparently a wide and deep channel, about half a mile eastward of the village, that leads southward, but it has not been examined. 15 Mahana al Kabira, on Bahrein island itself, is situated about 1| miles south-westward of Mahana as Saghira, and thence the coast trends southward for about 20 miles to Ras al Bar {Lat. 25° 48' N., Long. 50° 35' E.), see page 216. The northern half of the island of Sitrah is covered with high date 20 trees, and the eastern extremity of this part is a bluff close south ward of which is a conspicuous tree. Sitrah village and its fort are situated amongst the date trees. Ras al Jazra, on which there is a village and a detached date grove, is situated about 2 miles northward of the island of Sitrah; 25 at the point, there is a fresh-water spring on the beach below high water mark. Khor Lupin opens into the south-western corner of Khor Kali}^ southward of Ras al Jazra and is an extensive shallow backwater, the centre of which is occupied by a large reef. The entrance, 30 northward of the central reef, has depths in it of only 6 feet (l m 8) and navigation is intricate owing to the existence of many fish traps. Jezfrat Nabbi Sali is covered with date trees and lies, on the south-western part of the central reef in Khor Lupin, about 2 miles south-westward of Ras al Jazra. 35 Halat an Nannas is a low sandy point, about 1| miles north westward of Ras al Jazra, on which is a little fishing village. Anchorage.—Directions. —The best anchorage in Khor Kaliya is about 1^ miles within its entrance, between the middle sandbank and the eastern reef, in depths of from 24 to 28 feet (7 m 3 to 8 m 5). 40 The kh5r is frequented by native craft; but these vessels run up to its head and anchor close off Muharraq town. Vessels of suitable draft should approach Kh5r Kaliya with Jabal ad Dukhan bearing 229°; when Kassar Diwan is in line with the minarets, 2f miles south-westward of Ras ar Rumman, bearing 45 284°, course should be altered westward until that rock is in line with a conspicuous house on Ras al Jazra, bearing 298°; Kassar Diwan should then be approached on this bearing and when from 3 to 4 cables from it course should be altered west-south-westward towards the southern side of Sitrah date grove, and again north- 50 westward to cross the bar with Khor Kaliya beacon open westward of the clump of date trees near the Christian cemetery at Manamah. Having crossed the bar, course should be altered northward for the anchorage. Charts 20, 2837b, 748b.216 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 3540. , . It is advisable to enter in the morning and leave in the afternoon for then the position of the sun is favourable for seeing the reefs. The tidal streams in the entrance attain a rate of from 1J to 3^ 5 knots; within the khor they run at about half a knot. Charts 20, 28S7h. DUHAT AS SALWA AND APPROACHES.—Bahrein island.— Western side. —From the point on which stands Budaiyd, see page 209, the western coast of Bahrein island trends southward, 10 and the date trees, instead of being continuous as on the northern coast, grow in clumps. Reefs and shallow banks fringe the coast, and extend from 4 to 4| miles offshore for some distance southward of Budaiya, rendering approach, except in small native craft, impossible. 15 Raka, an islet 5 feet (l m 5) high and covered with scrub, lies about one mile south-westward of Budaiya. Cliff islet {Lat. 26° 12' N., Long. 50° 24' E.) lies about 1| miles west-south-westward of Raka; its western end is a cliff 52 feet (15 m 8) high, but its eastern end is low and sandy. 20 Umm Na'san, the northern end of which is situated about one mile southward of Cliff islet, is low and sandy, but on it are two rocky peaks; the one, rising to an elevation of 66 feet (20 m l) about half a mile within the western point of the island, is conspicuous; the other, about half a mile farther north-eastward, is 25 feet (7 m 6) 26 high. The reef on which the foregoing lie extends about 1^ miles westward of Cliff islet and about three-quarters of a mile westward and southward of the western part of Umm Na'san. Zelldg is a small pearling village situated about 10 miles south- 30 ward of Budaiya. Anchorage may be obtained off Zellag in a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), about 2| miles offshore, with the higher peak of Umm Na'sin bearing 335°; the anchorage should be approached with the village bearing about 081°; the depths decrease suddenly from 5 to 3 35 fathoms (Q 111 ! to 5 m 5). Landing is good at Zellag; but bad both northward and south ward of it. From Zellag the coast trends south-south-westward for about 4 miles and thence south-south-eastward for about 13 miles to Ras 40 a.\ Bar, the southern extremity of Bahrein island. Southward of Zellag, all cultivation and date palms cease, the country becoming a stony desert with small patches of camel grass and scrub here and there. Shoal water extends a long way offshore. Ras al Bar is a long low sandy point, that cannot be approached 45 within a distance of about 5 miles on account of the shallow fiats. Eastward and northward of Ras al Bar, the extensive reef fringing the eastern coast of Bahrein island debars all communication except in small boats. Chart 2837b. 50 Coast westward of Bahrein island. —Ras Kuwakib, not named on the chart, is situated on the mainland of Nejd about 15 miles north-westward of the north-western extremity of Bahrein island. Qalat al Husain is a small fort, close to Ras Kuwakib. A reef extends for a distance of about 8 miles eastward and north- Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] APPROACHES TO DUHAT AS SALWA 217 Chart 2837b. eastward of Ras Kuwakib, near its outer edge are drying sandbanks, see page 219. Jabal adh Dhahran, about 4^ miles westward of Ras Kuwakib, is the conspicuous south-eastern summit of a range of hills; it is a 5 long sloping hill from the middle of which rises abruptly a remarkable and rather flat-topped peak, 500 feet (152 m 4) high. Mudrah, the north-western summit of the range, is conical and rises to an elevation of 416 feet (126 m 8) about 3^ miles north westward of Jabal adh Dhahran. 10 From Ras Kuwakib, the coast trends southward for about 12 miles to the entrance of Duhat Ain as Saih. Lalyah district, said to be well watered and fertile, is near the coast southward of Ras Kuwakib. Tall i Zabanat is one of a group of four sandhills near the coast 15 about 6 miles southward of Ras Kuwakib; an isolated sandhill rises to an elevation of 55 feet (16 in 8) about 3f miles farther south ward; both Tall i Zabanat and the isolated sandhill are good marks. Duhat Ain as Saih is a shallow bay in the entrance of which there is a depth of about 6 feet (l m 8). At a distance of about one 20 mile off the entrance, and lying parallel with the coast, is a long narrow sandbank that dries in places. Kureya, a long low sandy point on the northern side of Duhat Dhalum, is situated about 7 miles southward of the entrance of Duhat Ain as Saih. 25 Duhat Dhalum is an extensive shallow bay, the shores of which are uninhabited. Numerous sandhills extend inland for some distance from the northern and western shores of the bay; but only one, rising northward of the bay to an elevation of about 55 feet (16 m 8), is at all conspicuous. 30 Hamadiya hill [Lat. 25° 59' N., Long. 50° 05' E.), on the southern side of Duhat Dhalum, is 120 feet (36 m 6) high and extends eastward and westward for about one mile; North hill, 2% miles west-north westward of Hamadiya hill, is small, round, and about 100 feet (30 m 5) high; both hills are good marks. 35 From the entrance of Duhat Dhalum, the coast trends south- south-eastward for about 25 miles to Ras Saiya, off 'Oqair, see page 218. Channels westward of Bahrein island.—Tidal streams.— The north-western extremity of Bahrein island lies about 12 miles 40 eastward of the coast of the mainland in the vicinity of Tall i Zabanat. The passage between is much obstructed by reefs intersected by narrow and shallow channels of which the easternmost is considered the best and is the only one that has been examined. In 1903, H.M.S. Lapwing, proceeding from Bahrein harbour to 45 'Oqair, passed between Khor fasht and Marwadi reef at midday about one hour after high water; on that occasion the reefs were not seen and no tidal stream was experienced. Jabal adh Dhahran, Jabal ad Dukhan, the higher peak on Umm Na'san, Cliff islet, the Portuguese fort, and the northern extremity 50 of the trees on Muharraq island are good marks by which to fix the position of the vessel when passing through the narrows westward of Umm Na'san island; but great difficulty is occasionally caused by refraction and mirage. The sandy islets on the western side Chart 748b.218 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. . , • vi , j i of the passage are conspicuous. It is not desirable to proceed through the passage with a favourable tidal stream. In the channel westward of Umm Na'san, the tidal streams set 5 southward and northward, attaining, at springs, a rate of from 2 to 3 knots. Duhat as Salwa.— This bay, as defined by Captain R. E. Cheesman, in 1921, extends for a distance of about 55 miles south ward of a line joining Ras as Sawad, see page 204, and 'Oqair, the 10 latter being situated about 20 miles west-south-westward of Ras al Bar, the southern extremity of Bahrein island. Captain Cheesman travelled to Salwa, at the head of the bay, by camel, passing along the western shore and returning in abagalathat, withhis chronometer onboard, had met him at three or four points on the outward journey. i5 Nowhere in the bay were any great depths discovered. The eastern side of the bay was found to be, in general, a straight sandy shore rising to sandhills; these latter are in close proximity to the coast of the northern half, but in the southern half they lie farther inland. 20 The western shore of the bay consists of a succession of bays separated by headlands consisting of sand dunes. 'Oqair, pronounced Ojair, on the western side of an inlet, consists of a few buildings, a Customs-house, and an old fort; there is a considerable caravan trade with the interior. The fort, a low 25 structure, has near it four towers, about 60 feet (18 m 3) high, close to which latter is a well. A jetty, at the head of which there is a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9), extends from the shore near the fort. Ras Sufaira is the western entrance point of the inlet, which latter trends north-north-westward, the entrance being between 30 that point and the southern extremity of Ras Saiya, a low sandy peninsula. The depths in the inlet, until near the jetty at 'Oqair, are from 4 to 6 fathoms (7 m 3 to ll m 0); but off its entrance lies a shoal, about 8 cables in extent, over which the depths are from 4 to 6 feet (l m 2 35 to l m 8). If intending to anchor off the eastern side of the peninsula, caution is necessary when approaching it, as the depths decrease very suddenly. Jezirat Zakhuniya, the northern end of which is situated about 40 3 miles south-eastward of Ras Sufaira, is a bare sandy mound on which are a village and a fort. Ras Umm al Awa, a sandhill running out from the coast, terminates in a rocky point, between which and the coast of Jezirat Zakhuniya there is a narrow shallow channel. Between the southern point 45 of the island, abreast which the coast of Nejd ends and that of the Trucial States begins, and the north-western extremity of a large promontory southward of it, is a still narrower channel in which there is a depth of 4J feet (l 11 ^). Ras Huwaiqil {Lat. 25° 07' NLong. 50° 38' E.) is a point about 50 30 miles southward of Ras Umm al Awa. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 20 feet (6 m l), about one-quarter of a mile offshore, southward of the point; landing abreast the anchorage is good, the beach being steep-to. Hashm 'Husaini is a sandstone range about 15 miles southward Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] NORTH-WESTWARD OF BAHREIN 219 Chart 2837h. of Ras Huwaiqil; it rises, a few miles inland, in a bluff about 300 feet (Ql 11 ^) high, that makes a good landmark. Duhat Hashm 'Husaini is a bay eastward of the sandstone range; southward of the bay, the coast is straight and within half a mile 5 of it the depths are only about 4 feet (l m 2). A plain extends 2 or 3 miles inland to numerous hills about 300 feet (91 m 4) high. Salwa is at the head of Duhat as Salwa; in its vicinity are some ruins and three groups of palm trees; there are also some wells that are 10 used by the Arabs on the caravan route between Qatar and Hofuf, see page 7. Charts 20, 2837b. NORTH-WESTWARD OF BAHREIN.—Reefs and channels.— The sea westward of Fasht al Jarim, see page 206, 15 is much obstructed by reefs and shoals. On the western side of the reef the depths decrease gradually towards it, except in the neighbourhood of Ras as Sala, situated about If miles westward of Kalai'ah rock, which part of the reef is comparatively steep-to. Khor al Bab is the channel leading from Bahrein harbour to 20 Al Katif, see page 221. It should not be used by vessels drawing more than 15 feet (4 m 6), and all vessels should engage a native pilot from Bahrein. The southern entrance of the channel is northward of West spit, see page 209, whence it trends between Khor fasht and Fasht al Jarim. For about 15 miles in a north-westerly direction, 25 the average width of the channel is about one mile and the depths in it are from 21 to 38 feet (O 11 ^ to II m 6), though there are some patches over which the depth is only 18 feet (5 ni 5). A large shoal, over which the general depths are from 13 to 18 feet (4 in 0 to 5 m 5), lies in mid-channel about 4 miles northward of Khor fasht. 30 Chaschus, 4 feet (I m 2) high, is one of several sandbanks on the outer part of the reef that extends for a distance of about 8 miles north-eastward from Ras Kuwakib, see page 216; its north-eastern extremity lies about 7 miles north-westward of Khor fasht. These sandbanks undergo considerable alteration due to the strong winds 35 and tidal streams; they are usually visible, from south-eastward, when the tide is below mean sea level. A bank, over which the depths are from to 3 fathoms (2 m 7 to 5 m 5), extends nearly 3 miles eastward from Chaschus {Lat. 26° 24' NLong. 50° 18' E.) and there forms the western side of Khor al Bab. 40 Rak as Surra, on the eastern side of Khor al Bab, is a pearl bank over which the depths are from 2 to 2f fathoms (3 m 7 to 5 m 0); it extends north-westward from Fasht al Jarim for a distance of about 7 miles and over its rocky parts the sea is much discoloured. The bank, deepening eastward to 4 fathoms (7 m 3), joins the Adala bank, 45 see page 206. Detached patches, over which the depths are from 2^ to 3 fathoms (4 m I to 5 m 5), lie from one to 5 miles north-eastward of Rak as Surra. Najwa is a reef lying nearly 6 miles northward of Chaschus reef, and about 3 miles westward of Rak as Surra. On it are two sand- 50 banks; the larger, in the middle of the reef, dries 4 feet (I m 2) and can usually be seen from south-eastward when the tide is below mean sea level; the other, on the southern end of the reef, is visible only at low water. The reef lies on a shoal that extends northward Chart 748b.Chap. VIL] NORTH-WESTWARD OF BAHREIN 221 Chart 2837b. that extends westward for about 2| miles from Ras Khali, trends northward for about 7 miles to a position near Ras Tanurah. Saihat is a coastal town, in which there is a large fort, situated about 10 miles north-westward of Ras Khali. Thick date groves begin at Saihat and extend northward, past A1 Katif, for a distance of about 8 miles. Westward of the town there is a sandhill, probably about 100 feet (30 m 5) high. On the coast, midway between Saihat and A1 Katif, is 'Anik fort, pronounced Anich. A1 Katif is an important coastal town about 5 miles northward of Saihat. It is situated in an oasis of the same name that extends 9 miles northward and 9 miles southward of the town and lies, on an average, about 3 miles inland; the oasis is bounded north ward and westward by a large tract of desert. The fort, the only part visible from seaward, is large but contains little besides the residence of the Amir and his followers, the town being scattered in the surrounding date groves. There is a minaret, between 80 and 100 feet (24 m 4 and 35 m 5) high, in the southern part of the fort; the citadel, in the north-western corner, is said to have been built by the Portuguese. A brown sandhill rises to an elevation of about 100 feet (30 m 5) about 3 miles west-north-westward of the town. There being many fresh-water springs in the neighbourhood, date and fruit trees, vegetables, melons, etc., are grown, and some rice is cultivated. There is a good bazaar in the town. The climate of the oasis is damp and unhealthy; malaria is prevalent. Jezirat Tarut {Lat. 26° 35' NLong. 50° 05' E.) lies, off A1 Katif, on the coastal reef that there extends about 7 miles offshore; its eastern part is closely grown with high date trees. See view facing this page, observing that Tarut fort is no longer visible from seaward. Darin, situated at the southern end of Jezirat Tarut, is a town in which there is a square fort with a conspicuous tower. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), with Darin fort bearing 270°, distant about 4^ miles. A1 Katif town can be reached by boats drawing up to 7 feet (2 in l); larger boats enter by Khor Saihat, a branch of the bight westward of Ras Khali that passes close eastward of Saihat town. Another branch of the bight trends southward and leads to Dammam. At about 3 miles eastward of Darin is the entrance of a small channel, also available to large boats, that, trending westward, leads close past Darin and joins Khor Saihat near Burj Abul Lif, a small fort on the reef about 1| miles westward of Darin. The main channel passes about 2| cables eastward of Burj Abul Lif, above which the larger boats cannot go, though there is a small branch that admits such boats close up to the walls of the fort. Another channel, navigable at high water, leads round the northern end of Jezirat Tarut and joins the channel from Burj Abul Lif off A1 Katif. A local pilot is necessary to take a boat drawing 2|- feet (0 m 8), or more, up to A1 Katif. Chart 2837b, plan of Ras Tanurah anchorage. Ras Tanurah.—Anchorage.—Directions. —This point is the extremity of a strip of sand, with sandhills on its outer edge, that extends south-eastward for a distance of about 9 miles from the mainland to a position about the same distance east-north-eastward 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chart 748b.222 PERSIAN GULF— SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837h, plan of Ras Tanurah anchorage. of M Katif It is about half a cable wide in places, and the sand hills appear to be about 40 feet (12^2) high; they show up white when the sun shines upon them. The point itself is about 12 feet 5 (31117) high, and consists of level sand overlying coral. The reefs within the point show up well, especially the large main reef off ^A^beacon^consisting of the mast of a dhow, 52 feet (15^8) high, was erected, in 1921, near the extremity of Ras Tanurah; if it still 10 exists it is a useful mark for the anchorage. \ reef extends from one to 3 cables from the western side of the sand strip between positions 5 and 18 cables north-westward of its extremity, but near Ras Tanurah there is no fringing reef. There is a depth of 3 fathoms (5 m o) about half a mile east-south- 15 eastward of Ras Tanurah, and from this position shoal water extends southward and westward; between these shoals and Najwa reef, about 5 miles south-eastward, the depths are from 5 to 7 fathoms (9 m l to 12 m 8). j ^ , The reefs extending from Jezirat Tarut, and the coastal reef 20 northward of A1 Katif, approach the western side of the sand strip leaving a passage which, inside Ras Tanurah, is about one-quarter of a mile wide with depths in it of from 22 to 41 feet (6 m 7 to 12^5); in the entrance, the chart shows a least depth of 19 feet (5 m 8). Anchorage may be obtained, in depths of from 30 to 39 feet 25 (9 ni l to ll m 9), at a distance of about one cable offshore between one-quarter and one-half of a mile inside Ras Tanurah. The anchorage is well sheltered from the shamal, but, the bottom being hard, a good scope of cable should be veered. The kaus sends in a heavy sea, and better shelter will then be found north-westward 30 of Najwa reef. The channel inside the sand strip continues north-westward for about 4 miles, with depths, in places, of 5 fathoms (9 m l); it is narrow and tortuous and passes close southward of an islet. There is no fresh water near the anchorage. 35 The approach to Ras Tanurah anchorage from eastward would seem to be safe for vessels drawing up to 18 feet (5 m 5), and the best method appears to be to steer along, or a little northward of, the parallel of Ras Tanurah, passing between Khaura shoal, see below, and Najwa reef; on this line, chart 2837b shows depths not less than 3f fathoms 40 (6 m 9), but caution is necessary. Should the vessel be set south ward, which is unlikely, the edge of Fasht al Jarim will probably be visible at a considerable distance. Ras Tanurah {Lat. 26° 37' N., Long. 50° 10' E.) is steep-to and should be rounded at a distance of about one cable; anchorage 45 may then be selected as previously described. When rounding the point, the vessel should have good way upon her, for there are eddies and tide rips. The reefs southward of the entrance can usually be seen. Chart 2837h. £0 Off-lying shoals. —There are several detached shoals eastward and northward of Ras Tanurah. Khaura, over which the depths are from 2 to 5 fathoms {3 m 7 to 9 m l), extends north-north-eastward for about 8 miles from a position about 6 miles east-north-eastward of Ras Tanurah; the Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] NORTH-WESWARD OF BAHREIN 223 s Chart 2837b. 1*1 greatest breadth of the shoal is about 5 miles, and it lies about 3 miles northward of Najwa reef. Sheikh Gata, over which the depths are from 3| to 5 fathoms irtci■■ (6 m 9 to 9 m l), is about 8 miles long, east and west, and about 4 5 miles broad. Between Khaura and Sheikh Gata there is a channel in which ijjjt the depths are from 10 to 12 fathoms (18 m 3 to 21 m 9). Between Sheikh Gata and Addla banks there are depths of 7 lie-:.. fathoms (12 m 8) in the channel. 10 Fasht al Eling [Lat. 26° 53' N., Long. 50° 10' E.), over which there is a depth of 1| fathoms (2 in 7), lies about 16 miles northward of Ras Tanurah and about 9 miles offshore. A detached patch, over which there is a depth of 2f fathoms (S 111 ©), lies about miles eastward of Fasht al Eling. 15 The depths between Fasht al Eling and the coastal shoals south- westward vary from 3^ to 5| fathoms (6 m 4 to 10 m l). Fasht Bu Saafa, lying about 13 miles north-eastward of Fasht al Eling, is a patch of large rocks, on which the sea breaks heavily at times, there being depths of only 3 feet (0 m 9) over its shoalest 20 part and 3 fathoms (5 m 5) for a distance of about one mile south eastward of it; at high water, with a calm sea, the shoal does not always show up; the bottom round it is sand and depths of from 6 to 16 fathoms (ll m 0 to 29 m 3) are found close to it. A detached bank, over which there is a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), 25 lies about 3| miles eastward of Fasht Bu Saafa, with patches of 4^ and 4| fathoms (8 m 9 and 7 m 8) within 4| miles farther south-eastward; there is also a 4|-fathom (8 m 7) patch about 4| miles west-south- westward of Fasht Bu Saafa. Between these shoals and Al Ashira, 5 miles south-eastward, the depths are from 6 to 17 fathoms (l^O 30 to 31 m l). The shoals are frequented by fishermen from Jezirat Tarut, who take large quantities of fish with the line. For shoals farther eastward, see page 205. TIDAL STREAMS. —The tidal streams are felt everywhere on the Great Pearl bank, especially near the reefs and islands. From 35 Ras Rakan, the west-going tidal stream sets along the coast, southward into Duhat as Salwa, between Ras Rakan and Bahrein island. Off Bahrein island and amongst the outlying reefs, the tidal streams are very erratic and much affected by the wind, but, to a certain extent, they follow the general trend of the reefs, attaining 40 at springs a rate of from one to 2 knots, and even 3 knots at times, but this is very exceptional. Between Bahrein and the Qatar peninsula, the tidal streams are, for the most part, weak and the rise and fall slight. There are, however, heavy tide rips southward of Bahrein, in Duhat as Salwa, 45 caused by the sudden alterations in depth. The configuration of the land would point to a greater rise and fall in the latter locality than immediately northward, but no observations on this point have been possible. Careful observations made, in 1901-2, by R.I.M.S. Investigator, 50 whilst at anchor between Bahrein island and Hawar, show that the spring rise never exceeds 3 or 4 feet (0 m 9 or l m 2) in that locality. Chart 748h.224 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. The tidal stream, coming in from north-eastward, runs southward along the eastern side of Fasht al Jarim, until abreast Ras al Ain, where, joining the stream flowing westward along the northern edge 5 of the Khasaifah reef, it turns south-westward into Bahrein harbour. Northward of Fasht al Jarim and across the eastern part of the Sheikh Gata bank, the tidal streams flow south-westward and north-eastward, turning to south and north, respectively, along the western side of Fasht al Jarim and to south-east and north-west 10 between Fasht al Jarim and Khor fasht in Kh5r al Bab; but eastward of and over Khor fasht they set southward and northward. The tidal streams set southward and northward over Khaura shoal [Lat. 26° 42' N., Long. 50° 18' E.), and south-westward and north-eastward between Chaschus banks and Najwa reef. 15 The southern edges of Khaura shoal and Sheikh Gata bank are marked by overfalls. The streams set south-eastward and north-westward between Muharraq and Bahrein islands, and eastward of Muharraq island they set southward and northward. In Bahrein harbour entrance, 20 northward of Muharraq, they set west-south-westward and east- north-eastward at a rate of from one to 2 knots. The tidal streams seem to divide and meet near Ras Tanurah; south-eastward of that point, the general west-going stream sets southward, and the east-going stream, northward; northward of the 25 point, the general west-going stream sets north-westward, and the east-going stream, southward; the general east-going stream appears to set north-eastward from Ras Tanurah, passing between Fasht Bu Saafa and Al Ashira; but the streams are not strong enough to interfere with safe navigation. 30 In Ras Tanurah anchorage the streams run north-westward and south-eastward at a rate of knots at springs and half a knot at neaps. NORTHERN PART OF THE COAST OF NEJD .—From Ras Tanurah, the coast trends north-westward for about 125 miles 35 to Ras al Misha'ab and is a low sandy or stony desert with, at intervals, a few isolated hills; it is fronted for nearly the whole distance by extensive reefs that, in places, have passages inside them, and there are several low off-lying islets. The sea is not usually as clear as it is farther southward, for in places the bottom 40 is of white clay and the shoals do not, in consequence, show up so well. Many patches of whitish muddy colour, apparently indicating shoal water, are frequently seen where no change in depth exists, yet the warning of discoloured water must not be disregarded. With the exception of the settlement at Khuwair- 45 al-Jabal, see page 225, and the villages on Jezirat Jinnah, see page 226, and Jezirat Musallamiyah, see page 227, there are neither towns, villages, nor a fixed population on the coast, the only in habitants being several tribes of Bedawin. The Great Pearl bank decreases in width off this coast, and may 50 he said to end in the vicinity of Jezirat Abu 'Ali, see page 225, although pearls are sought on a small scale on some of the banks northward of that island. This part of the Persian Gulf has been very incompletely surveyed. Chart 748b.-• ',r' V Chap. VII.] coast of nejd 225 Chart 2837b.

Jabal-al-Bahri, situated about 13 miles north-westward of Jabal Dhalaifam, is a high sandhill on a slightly projecting point at the 10 southern end of Duhat Abu 'Ali, which bay is large and shallow; inland of the point are some very high sandhills, and on the coast, at a distance of a few miles northward of it, is a stony hillock Khuwair-al-Jabal {Lat. 27° 02'N., Long. 49° 46' E.) is a small creek that runs inland on the northern side of Jabal-al-Bahri. It 15 is used as a port by sailing craft, and has a good boat anchorage protected from most winds except the nashi; it is the most convenient pomt on the coast for communication by caravan with the interior and a considerable settlement has grown up. Jezfrat al Batinah is a peninsula, forming the shore of Duhat 20 Abu Ah, that ends about 19 miles north-westward of Jabal-al-Bahri. aV 8 ^A?° r i ed by the Arabs on the sou th-western side of Duhat u All, date trees grow near springs of fresh water in one or two places. Jezfrat Abu Ali lies close northward of Jezfrat al Bdtinah and 25 between them there is a narrow shallow passage. The ruins of a tomb stand on a small hill close to Ras Abu Ali, the eastern extremity ot Jezirat Abu 'Ah. A diying sandspit extends eastward for about 4 miles from Ras Abu 'Ali; at low water thousands of cormorants settle on the spit. 30 Good anchorage during a shamdl may be obtained, in Duhat Abu Ah southward of Ras Abu 'Ali, there being but little reef on the southern side of the point, though shoal water extends from the western side of the bay for nearly 4 miles offshore. In depths less than 9 fathoms (16 m 5), the bottom is hard sand, but in greater 35 depths it is mud; the soundings are fairly regular and the depths decrease from 18 fathoms (32^9) in the middle of the channel between the shore of Duhat Abu 'Ali and the off-lying reefs to 6 and 4 fathoms (11^0 and 7 m 3) close to the coastal reef, and to 7 fathoms (12m8) withm half a mile of the spit extending from Ras Abu 'Ali. 40 The best position in which to anchor is, in a depth of about 5 fathoms (9 m l), with the ruins of the tomb bearing 000°, distant about one mile; within this distance the depths decrease rapidly towards the reef, which there extends about half a mile offshore. A little bight, westward of the ruins, affords complete shelter to 45 small native craft, but for larger vessels there is no shelter in the bay from the kaus which sends in a heavy sea. Anchorage, sheltered from the kaus, may, however, be obtained northward of Ras Abu i nr\o • a ^ fathoms (7 m 3), with the ruins bearing about 170°, distant about 3 miles. 50 When rounding the spit extending from Ras Abu 'Ali, its eastern extremity should be given a wide berth, for the depths shoal very rapidly and a heavy sea breaks on its weather side. Off-lying dangers. Inshore channel. —^Jezfrat Jaraid, charted Chart 748b. 5400226 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. about 10 miles north-north-eastward of Jabal-al-Bahri, but reported to lie about 6 miles farther eastward, is of sand, about 12 feet (3^7) high, and is covered with thin scrub; it is surrounded by a reef &lt;5 that extends for a distance of about half a mile from its northern side, and the depths near it are from 13 to 37 fathoms (23 m 8 to 67m7). The island appears to be a breeding place of cormorants. Jezfrat Janah, charted about 9 miles east-north-eastward of Ras Abu 'Ali, but reported to lie about 4 miles farther eastward is of 10 sand, about 10 feet (3 m 0) high, and is covered with thin scrub. A small reef, which is steep-to, surrounds the islet and extends for a distance of about three-quarters of a mile from its northern side. Shelter from either the shamal or the kaus can be obtained under its lee. 15 A large area, extending about 25 miles south-eastward, 20 miles north-westward, and 10 miles north-eastward from Jezirat Janah is only partially surveyed, but is known to be encumbered with shoals having deep channels between them; extreme caution is necessary in navigating this area. 20 From Ras lanurah, a navigable channel, in which the depths are from 5 to 20 fathoms (9^1 to 36^0), leads north-westward within the foregoing area; at its southern end it is wide, but its width soon decreases. See Directions, page 227. Daka is a patch, in the fairway of the channel, that nearly dries 25 and lies about 7 miles eastward of Jabal-al-Bahri. Jezirat Abu 'Ali to Ras al Ghar.—Anchorage.— Duhat ad Dafi is a large shallow inlet that extends south-eastward on the western sides of Jezirat Abu 'Ali and Jezirat al Batinah, and ends in a swamp; it appears to be frequented by black fish from 15 to 30 20 feet (4 m 6 to 6 m l) in length. Between Jezirat Abu 'Ali and Ras al Bidya, situated about 10 miles north-westward, is an extensive but shallow bay in the northern portion of which is Duhat Musallamiyah. Jezirat Jinnah {Lat. 27° 23' N., Long. 49° 20' E.), about 8 miles 35 west-north-westward of Jezirat Abu 'Ali, lies about 8 cables off the western shore of the bay and has, on its north-eastern side, some cliffs about 35 feet (10 m 7) high; the summit of the island is'level, its western part is low, and its colour is light. A large fort, with a round tower, stands on the summit of the island, and on the 40 noithern side of the latter is a fishing village possessing a large number of boats. Abundant supplies of fresh water said to be good are obtained from springs. Diy sandbanks extend about 2 miles northward and one mile eastward from the island There _ is a small basin, with depths in it of 3 fathoms (5^5), close north- 45 eastward of the island; large native boats lie in it, but the entrance which is from eastward, dries. x 1 a 1 ?

The sandbanks and reefs in the bay are numerous but, being usually visible, are easily avoided. The mainland on the northern side of the bay is everywhere low; 5 but just southward of Jezirat Musallamiyah there is a conspicuous cliffy bluff, the coast for some miles southward of which is from 50 to 80 feet (15 m 2 to 24 m 4) high with a growth of shrubs upon it. Jezirat Musallamiyah lies about 5 miles westward of Ras al 10 Bidya and on it are some low sandhills. The village stands amongst a few trees, and the inhabitants are fisherfolk possessing a large number of boats. The water on the island is brackish and limited in quantity, it is said by the natives to be unwholesome. A branch from Duhat Musallamiyah, in which the depths are about 15 3 fathoms (5 m 5), extends southward, between Jinnah and the mainland, from a position just inside Ras al Bidya; a channel leads from this branch to the village on Jinnah, giving access by boat to the latter at high water. The best anchorage, when visiting either Jinnah or Musallamiyah, 20 is in a position about 5 miles north-eastward of Jinnah fort, in depths of 4 or 5 fathoms (7 m 3 or O 110 -!); the anchorage affords but little shelter from either the shamal or the kaus, and inshore of it are extensive sandbanks with numerous ridges and reefs running north and south. When anchoring in this locality allowance must 25 be made for a difference in the level of the sea due to the action of the winds, as well as that due to the tides; in a position where a depth of 18 feet (5 m 5) was obtained, after a strong kaus had blown for 12 hours, there was, on the following day, a depth of only 14 feet (4 m 3), and that, when a strong shamal had followed the kaus 30 and had been blowing for several hours. Jinnah is approached through the main channel, trending west- south-westward from its entrance, until the village on that island bears 180°; thence the village may be steered for, keeping close to the sandbanks on the eastern side of the channel. 35 Musallamiyah village is approached, through the main channel, steering towards the conspicuous bluff on the mainland southward of it; when close to the mainland the channel turns towards the island. {Lat. 27° 25' N., Long. 49° 15' E.). Ras al Ghar is low and is situated about 9 miles north-westward 40 of Ras al Bidya; on it are brownish rocky hillocks overgrown with small shrubs; there is but little coastal reef. Foul ground extends north-north-eastward from Ras al Ghar for a distance of about 5 miles. Off-lying dangers.—Directions.— Fasht al Kash extends in a ^5 north-easterly direction for about 5 miles from a position about 12 miles east-north-eastward of Ras al Bidya. The whole of the area between Fasht al Kash and Jezirat Janah is unsurveyed, see page 226. The channel between Fasht al Kash and the mainland has only been partially sounded; depths of from 4 to 6 fathoms 50 (7 m 3 to ll m 0) are found within a distance of about 5 miles of the coastal reef, but those near Fasht al Kash are unknown. The channel from Ras al Ghar to Ras Tanurah is entered from northward between the former point and Fasht al Kash; a depth of Chart 748b.228 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837b. 5 fathoms (9 m l) could probably be carried through it, but it should only be taken in daylight, the vessel anchoring at sunset. Jezirat Harkus {Lat. 27° 56' N., Long. 49° 41' E.) or Jezirat al 5 Karan, see page 229, should first be made; thence vessels should steer for a position on the mainland close south-eastward of Ras al Ghar. The depths in the approach being very irregular, soundings are of little assistance. When about 4 miles from the coast, course should be altered, south-eastward, towards Ras Abu 'Ali, the ruins 10 oi the tomb near which are conspicuous. Having given the spit extending from Ras Abu 'Ali a wide berth, course should be altered to pass about 4 miles north-eastward of Jabal-al-Bahri whence the coast should be kept at that distance, care being taken to avoid Daka patch. Ras al Kaliya should be given a berth of at least 5 15 miles to avoid the shoal extending off it, and care should be taken to avoid a 3^-fathom (G 11 ^) patch lying about 7 miles north-north eastward of that point. Thence course should be shaped to pass southward of Fasht al Eling and altered to round Ras Tanurah, being guided by the chart. 20 Islets and dangers north-eastward of Fasht al Kash.— Beacons. —Jezair Farsi, 'Arabi, Harkus, Al Karan, and Al Kurain all lie within 40 miles north-eastward of Fasht al Kash; they are all very low and waterless, and have deep water close to them. They are difficult to make out in the haze during and after a shamal, 25 especially in summer, and should never be approached at night. The tidal streams in the vicinity of this group of islets set westward and eastward; but the times of the turn of the streams are not known; between 'Arabi and Farsi they appear to attain a rate of about one knot. If anchoring off any of these islets, caution must 30 he exercised when approaching them, for the depths shoal rapidly and soundings give no warning. Jezirat Farsi, the north-easternmost islet of the group, lies about 40 miles north-eastward of the north-eastern end of Fasht al Kash, less than 60 miles from the nearest part of the coast of Persia; it is 35 about 10 feet (SH)) high and is overgrown with coarse grass and brushwood; the beach is of white sand and its fringing reef extends from its northern end for from 3 to 4 cables, from its western side for a greater distance, and from its southern side for about one cable; it shows up plainly and there are depths of 25 fathoms (45 m 7) close ^ to it. On the south-eastern side of the islet, protected from the sea by rocks, is a small lagoon that may be entered by pulling boats at its southern end. A wooden daymark, 30 feet (9 m l) in height and surmounted by a circular iron topmark 9 feet (2 IU 7) in diameter, has been erected on the summit of the southern part of the islet. 45 A pyramidal beacon, 12 feet (3 m 7) high, composed of loose stones, stands on the northern end of the islet. In 1924, H.M.S. Cyclamen anchored south-westward of the islet; and, in 1931, H.M.S. Triad anchored, in a depth of 27 fathoms (49 m 4), with the pyramidal beacon bearing 338°, distant about half a mile. At certain seasons 50 flocks of small birds settle on the islet and their cries can be heard on a calm night at a distance of about one mile, sometimes even before the islet is sighted; turtle abound. Jezirat 'Arabi, lying about 13 miles southward of Jezirat Farsi, is about 10 feet (3 m 0) high, and consists of sand on a rocky base. Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] coast of nejd 229 Chart 2837b.

Cyclamen anchored south-westward of the islet; and, in 1931, 5 H.M.S. Triad anchored, in a depth of 25^ fathoms (46 m 6), with the cairn bearing 330°, distant about 3| cables. Landing is bad, and at low water it is almost impossible to get a boat on shore on account of the large number of drying rocks. The islet literally swarms with birds, chiefly cormorants, and in the season it is covered 10 with nests and young ones, so that it is scarcely possible to walk without treading on eggs. At one time it had on it a deposit of guano a few inches thick; it is visited by fishermen for turtle. A submerged obstruction was reported, in 1920, to exist in a position about 12 miles west-north-westward of Jezirat 'Arabi. 15 Jezirat Harkus {Lat. 27° 56' N., Long. 49° 41' E.), lying about 28 miles west-north-westward of Jezirat 'Aiabi, is a sandy islet, about 3 feet (0 in 9) high, with a small fringing reef that is steep-to, there being depths of 15 fathoms (27 in 4) close off it, and from 14 to 17 fathoms (25 m 6 to 31 in l) within a distance of 5 miles eastward of it. 20 The islet does not appear to be frequented by birds. A wooden daymark, 30 feet (9 m l) in height, with a circular iron topmark, 9 feet (2 m 7) in diameter, has been erected in the centre of the islet. Jezirat al Karan, lying about 19 miles west-south-westward of 25 Jezirat 'Arabi, is only a few feet high, quite level, and covered with brushwood. Comparatively few birds have been seen upon it. A fringing reef surrounds the islet, and extends about one mile north westward and more than half a mile south-eastward from it; depths of from 7 to 10 fathoms (12 m 8 to 18 m 3) are found at a distance of 30 about half a mile from the reef. The islet is frequented by fishermen. Anchorage may be obtained on the south-eastern side of the islet. Vessels should not anchor in depths less than 17 fathoms (31 m l), for the reef is very steep-to, a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) being found within a few yards of its edge. 35 Jezirat al Kurain, lying about 31 miles southward of Jezirat al Karan, is a sandy islet, about 2 feet (0 m 6) high, thai is surrounded by a reef and is usually covered with birds. A bank, over which there is a depth of 5 fathoms (9 m l), is said to exist about 8 miles eastward of Jezirat al Kurain, but its position 40 has not been determined and the Euphrates passed over its assigned position without finding it. There is a channel with depths of 12 fathoms (21 m 9) in it, between Jezirat al Kurain and Jezirat al Karan. The area southward and westward towards Jezirat Janah and Fasht al Kash appears to be 45 clear but has only been partially examined and caution is therefore necessary. Ras al Ghar to Ras al Misha'ab. —From Ras al Ghar, the coast of Nejd curves north-westward for about 23 miles to Ras at Tanajib, and is chiefly low, with shoal banks extending offshore for a distance 50 of from 5 to 9 miles; the 10-fathom (18 II1 3) line lies from 11 to 12 miles offshoie and between depths of 8 and 20 fathoms (14 m 6 and 36 m 6) the bottom, generally, is of white clay. Jabal Manifah, situated on the coast about 12 miles west-north- Chart 748b.230 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VIL Chart 2837b. westward of Ras al Ghar, is small, and neai* it is Duhat Balbul, a little bay affording anchorage for boats. Ras at Tanajib rises steeply to a flat-topped light-coloured hill 5 between 70 and 100 feet (21 m 3 and 30 m 5) high. Duhat Kharais is a large bight between a point situated about 7 miles north-westward of Ras at Tanajib and Ras as Safaniyah, situated about 8 miles farther in the same direction; little is known of the bight except that its shores are low and that on them there are one i0 or two hillocks. Ras as Safaniyah is a low projecting point, whence the coast, for the most part also low, trends north-westward for about 13 miles to Ras al Misha'ab. Jabal Thaluf, situated on the coast about 4 miles west-north- 15 westward of Ras as Safaniyah, is a hill, with a bluff on its northern side, that rises in two steps to a height of about 40 feet (12 m 2). Jabal 'Amadah, situated about miles south-westward of Ras al Misha'ab, is a dark volcanic-looking hill, 105 feet (32 m 0) high, that appears from north-eastward as four hummocks, see view Q 20 on chart 2837b. Ras al Misha'ab is low and sandy but is faced, in places, with low cliffs. Jezirat al Makta, an islet lying close southward of Ras al Misha'ab, has cliffs from 20 to 30 feet (6 m l to 9 m l) high on its eastern side 25 and is covered with grass and brushwood. There is no channel between the islet and the mainland, and a sandy spit, on which are several dry sandbanks, projects eastward for about 2| miles from the former. Dangers. —A detached shoal patch lies, about 2| miles offshore, 50 4J miles south-eastward of Jabal 'Amadah. Kasr Umm as Sahal, a patch that almost dries, lies near the edge of the coastal reef that extends north-north-eastward from Jezirat al Makta for a distance of about 4 miles and over which the general depths are about 2 fathoms (3 m 7); there are depths of 9 fathoms 35 (16 in 5) close to this shoal. Anchorage. —Bandar Misha'ab is an anchorage, where native craft shelter from the shamal, on the southern side of the spit extending eastward from the coast in the vicinity of Jezirat al Makta; the anchorage is in the north-eastern part of a large bay that is in ^0 most places shallow; the approach to the anchorage, in which the depths are from 6 to 7 fathoms (ll^O to 12^8), is between the foregoing spit and Kassar al Mitma, see below. The best position in which to anchor is about 1J miles south-eastward of the north-eastern extremity of Jezfrat al Makta. 45 Off-lying dangers.—Anchorage.— Bildani reefs extend offshore for from 15 to 16 miles between Ras at Tanajib and Ras al Misha'ab. Ras Bildani [Lat. 27° 58' NLong. 49° 14' E.), the south-eastern extremity of the reefs, lies about 17 miles north-eastward of Ras at Tanajib, and from it the edge of the reef, which appears to be 50 continuous, trends north-westward for about 25 miles, and then turns south-westward for about 7 miles to Kassar al Mitmar, on the eastern side of the approach to the anchorage off Jezirat al Makta. Parts of the reef are above water, and others dry; a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3) will be found, generally, at a distance of about half a mile Chart 748b.Chap. VII.] COAST OF KUWAIT 231 Chart 2837b. outside the reefs. A channel leads along the coast inshore of Bilddni reefs from the southern part of the bay in which is the anchorage off Jezirat al Makta; it has not been examined, but is reported by the Arabs to be navigable. 5 A detached patch, over which the depth is fathoms (4 m l), sand and rock, and round which there are depths of 12 and 13 fathoms (21 m 9 and 23 in 8), lies about 10 miles north-north-westward of Ras Bilddni; the sea is but little discoloured over the shoal. Bildani reefs should not be approached at night into depths less 10 than 18 fathoms (32 m 9), nor by day, when in clear weather they can be seen at a distance of about 3 miles, into less than 15 fathoms (27 m 4); the land is not in sight from seaward of the reef. The 2^-fathom (4 in l) patch should be given a wide berth. Anchorage, sheltered from the shamdl but open to the kaus, might 15 be obtained under the lee of the reefs between Ras Bilddni and Ras at Tandjib, with the hill on the latter bearing 260°, distant about 8 miles. COAST OF KUWAIT .—The coast proper of the Principality of Kuwait begins about 2 miles southward of Ras Qaliya (al 20 Kaliyah), situated about 45 miles northward of Ras al Misha'ab, and extends in a general north-north-westerly direction to Khor Abdullah, see page 240; but that portion between a position about half-way between Ras al Misha'ab and Ras al Kafji and the boundary of Kuwait proper is jointly owned by the Ruler of Kuwait and the 25 King of Nejd and is known as the neutral zone. Between Ras al Misha'ab and Kita at Araifiyan, situated about 4 miles offshore 52 miles north-north-westward, the coast may be approached to a distance of about 6 miles, and between Kita at Araifiyan and Ras al Ardh, situated at the entrance of Kuwait harbour, about 23 miles 30 farther north-north-westward, it may be approached to a distance of about 2 miles. There are several off-lying islets, within which the depths are irregular and soundings afford but little guidance; off the northern part of the coast of the Sultanate is an extensive flat, see page 234. In depths less than 8 fathoms (14 m 6), the bottom 35 is of sand or rock; but in greater depths it is of mud. Between Ras al Misha ab and Kuwait harbour, there is no place of shelter from the shamal for any but very small boats; this wind, which on this coast blows from north-north-westward, and occasionally from north ward, raises a considerable sea. 40 The tidal streams set north-north-westward and south-south-east ward along the coast, and are strong. Ras al Misha'ab to Ras az Zor, —The coast between Ras al Misha'ab and Ras al Khafji consists of low sandhills, and depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) are found from 2 to 3 miles offshore. 45 Duhat al Asli, some 2 to 4 miles southward of Ras al Khafji {Lat. 28° 24' NLong. 48° 32' E.), is shallow. Ras al Khafji is a sandy projection, on the northern side of which is an islet; the coastal reef extends about one mile off the point. Ras Bardhalk, situated about 5 miles north-north-westward of 50 Ras al Khafji, is low, white, and sandy, and from it a spit extends north-eastward for a distance of about one mile. Hadd al Hamarah, situated about 4J miles north-westward of Chart 748h.232 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 2837h. Ras Bardhalk, is a small sandy spit under the lee of which boats shelter. Jabal Bannah, situated about 10 miles north-westward of Ras 5 Bardhalk, rises, about 2 miles inland, to an elevation between 70 and 100 feet (21 D1 3 and 30 m 5); it is small, saddle-shaped, and dark in colour, the coast in the vicinity consisting of low white sandhills. See view R on chart 2837b. Kh5r al Ami, a small inlet frequented by fishing boats, is entered about 2 miles northward of Jabal Bannah. Ras az Zor, situated about 16 miles north-north-westward of Ras Bardhalk, is the extremity of a long, low, sandy projection; a spit extends north-eastward from it for a distance of about 2 miles. Off-lying dangers and banks. —Al Kumrah is a pearl bank, 15 lying about 18 miles north-eastward of Ras al Misha'ab, over which there is a dep|;h of 8 fathoms (14 m 6). Breakers, apparently caused by a shoal, were reported, in 1908, by s.s. Kazimi, in a position about 12 miles east-north-eastward of Ras al Khafji. 20 Umm al Maradim [Lat. 28° 41' N., Long. 48° 40' E.), lying about 15 miles north-eastward of Ras Bardhalk, is a sandy waterless islet, some 20 feet (6 m l) high, that is covered with brushwood. Except on its southern side, a reef extends from it for a distance of nearly half a mile; there are depths of from 14 to 16 fathoms (25 m 6 to 29 m 3) 26 round the islet. A small reef, awash and steep-to, lies about 2 miles north-north westward of Umm al Maradim. Charts 22, 1265. Ras az Zor to Ras al Ardh.—Light. —Duhat az Zor is a bay, 30 between Ras az Zor and Ras Qaliya, situated about 10 miles north-westward. Ras Qaliya is low, and from it the coast trends north-north westward for about 30 miles to Ras al Ardh and is a low stony desert, brownish in colour; at a few miles inland are hills from 200 to 300 55 feet (61 m 0 to 91 m 4) high. At about 3 miles north-westward of Ras Qaliya is a square hillock that in appearance resembles a fort and rises to an elevation of about 50 feet (15 in 2), it is known as Jilaat al Abid, and on it are the ruins of an old tower; along the coast northward of this hillock are four forts or villages, the whole being 40 known as Al Qasur; the inhabitants of the latter are herdsmen and cultivators. Shi'aibah, the southernmost of the four, and situated about 12^ miles north-westward of Ras Qaliya, is a small square fort standing on the coast. The beach in its neighbourhood is sandy, 45 but at low water the landing is indifferent; near the fort are some wells and a date plantation. Horses are sometimes exported to India. Fahaihil (Fahaheel) is a village on the coast about 2| miles north ward of Shi'aibah. 50 Abu Halaifah is a small fort, about 5 miles northward of Shi'aibah, near which are a few date trees and some wells of good water. Al Fantas, the northernmost of the four, and situated on the coast about miles northward of Abu Halaifah, has a small date grove. Charts 2837h, 748b.Chap. VII.] COAST OF KUWAIT 233 Charts 22, 1265. At Abu Fatairah, about 2 miles northward of A1 Fantas, there is a patch of melon cultivation; and at Fanaitis, near the coast about 2 miles farther northward, is a group of wells marked by a conspicuous solitary tree; but neither are shown on charts 22 or 1265. 5 Sirrah hill or Mishrif fort is small, square, and conspicuous; it stands at an elevation of about 180 feet (54 m 9) in a position about 5 miles south-westward of Ras al Ardh. Ras al Ardh, the southern entrance point of Kuwait harbour, is low and sandy; it is reported to have extended considerably since 10 the first survey of 1821-9; shoal water extends north-eastward from it for a distance of about 2 cables. During a kaus, a very heavy sea breaks on the point. At springs, the tidal streams off the point are strong. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 36 feet (ll m 0), from a 15 stone pyramidal beacon, painted black, on the extremity of Ras al Ardh. [Lat. 29° 21' N., Long. 48° 06' E.). Dangers. —In Duhat az Zor are many shoal patches, some of which lie about 4 miles offshore. From Ras Qaliya, a spit, over which the depths are 2 fathoms 20 (3 m 7) and less, extends north-eastward for a distance of about 4 miles, depths of 10 fathoms (18 :m 3) being found within one mile of its extremity. Kita at Araitiyan, lying about 7^ miles north-north-westward of Ras Qaliya and about 4 miles offshore, is a small detached reef, 25 that is nearly awash and close round which are depths of from 7 to 10 fathoms (12 m 8 to 18 m 3). A small patch, over which there is a depth of lj fathoms (2 m 3), rock, lies, about three-quarters of a mile offshore, 7| miles south ward of Ras al Ardh. 30 Kola patch, on which the vessel of that name grounded in 1906, lies, about 8 cables offshore, 3| miles southward of Ras al Ardh; an examination by H.M.S. Sphinx revealed the fact that it consists of a small rock, over which there is a depth of 6 feet (l m 8), with depths round it of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) at a distance of three-quarters of a cable. 35 A shoal, over which there is a least depth of 2 fathoms (3 ra 7), lies about 6 cables offshore and extends for a distance of about half a mile southward from a position about If miles in that direction from Ras al Ardh. Off-lying dangers.—Tidal streams. —JeziratKaru, lying about 40 10 miles north-eastward of Umm al Maradim, is a sandy islet, about 3 feet (0 m 9) high, on which are a few tufts of grass. A spit extends northward from the islet for a distance of about half a mile. The islet swarms with birds, and, during the season, is covered with their eggs and young. 45 A small, detached, steep-to reef, on which the sea breaks at low water, lies about 1^ miles north-north-westward of Jezirat Karu. The depths in the vicinity of the islet and of the reef are no guide to their proximity, and they should be carefully avoided at night. Madaira reef consists of two coral patches extending about 8| 50 cables north-westward from a position about 6| miles northward of Jezirat Karu; there is a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9) over the south eastern patch, and 5 feet (l m 5) over the north-western one; the depths round the reef are from 10 to 20 fathoms (18 m 3 to 36 m 6), Charts 2837b, 748b. 54°° H*234 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Charts 22, 1265. but there is a 9-fathom (16 m 5) patch about one mile south-eastward; in fine weather the existence of the reef is only indicated by slight overfalls in its immediate vicinity, though in bad weather it probably 5 breaks. Taylor rock [Lat. 29° 02' N., Long. 48° 35' E.), a small coral patch over which there is a depth of 1^ fathoms (2^7), lies about 12^ miles north-westward of Madaira reef; in fine weather there is no indication on the surface of its existence, but in bad weather it improbably breaks. Jezlrat Kubbar, lying about 5 miles north-westward of Taylor rock, is a sandy islet, about 8 feet (2 m 4) high, that is overgrown with brushwood; a reef extends 1J cables southward, 3 cables eastward, and one cable northward from the islet, and a narrow rocky tonguei 25 on which the sea breaks in bad weather, extends for a distance of about 6 cables north-westward from it. A detached l|-fathom (2 m 7) patch lies about 6 cables westward of the islet. A stone beacon, 15 feet (4 m 6) high, surmounted by a barrel, stands on the northern side of Jezirat Kubbar. A few birds frequent the islet, which, except after rain, is usually waterless. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of 11 fathoms (20 m l), about half a mile south-south-eastward of Jezirat Kubbar; but the islet does not afford shelter from the shamal. In fine weather, landing on the south-western side of the islet is good. 25 The tidal streams in the vicinity of the foregoing dangers set north-westward and south-eastward, and at springs attain a rate of about 1| knots. Approaches to Kuwait.—Abu Jezza flat. —The deep water approach to Kuwait harbour lies between the coast southward of Ras 30 al Ardh and Abu Jezza, a great flat that extends south-eastward from the coast north-eastward of the entrance of the harbour for from 35 to 40 miles. Over the south-eastern end of this flat there are depths of from 6 to 9 fathoms (llmQ to 16^5); but depths less than 6 fathoms (ll m 0) are found within 33 miles of the coast. 35 Jezirat Failakah, pronounced Failicha, lies on an extensive flat of mud, sand, and rock on the eastern side of the approach with its south-eastern extremity about 20 miles north-north-westward of Jezirat Kubbar; it is very low, but there is a clump of date trees on its south-western side about 2 miles from its south-eastern end. 40 The highest part of the island is a little mound on its south-western side, about half a mile eastward of its western extremity, and about 30 feet (9 m l) high, on which is a small but conspicuous tomb. Az Zor is a village, the only inhabited part of the island, near the middle of its north-western side; near the village is a small date ^5 grove. Native boats anchor on the flat off the tomb, and shift round the point on which it stands according to the direction of the wind. The island is healthy; but the water supply indifferent. Off the north-western side of Jezirat Failakah there are depths of from 2 to 6 feet (0 m 6 to l m 8), and there is good landing for boats 50 at all states of the tide, especially at Az Zor. The 3 -fathom (5 m 5) line lies about 6 miles south-westward, from 6 to 9 miles southward, 3£ miles eastward, and about 2f miles north-eastward of the coasts of Jezirat Failakah. Jezirat Auhah is a sandy islet covered with scrub, about 8 feet Charts 2837b, 748b.f44 Chap. VII.] KUWAIT HARBOUR 235 Charts 22, 1265. (2 m 4) high, lying about 2 miles south-eastward of the south-eastern end of Jezlrat Failakah; on it are three cairns, the north-western and south-eastern being about 6 feet (l m 8) in height, and the middle one, smaller. A stone beacon, 11 feet (3 m 4) high, stands on the 5 south-eastern end of the islet. Ras al Yahi is a rocky patch, drying 2 feet (0 m 6), that extends in a north-easterly direction for about half a mile from a position about 1J miles north-eastward of Jezirat Auhah; it lies on the eastern extremity of the flats surounding Jezfrat Failakah, with depths 10 of 5 fathoms (9 m l) at a distance of 1| cables north-eastward of it. Soundings give no warning of its proximity when approaching from northward or eastward and caution is therefore necessary in its locality. The depths are shoal between Jezirat Auhah and Ras al Yahi and also between them and Jezirat Failakah. 15 Tharub is a great mud-flat lying between Jezirat Failakah and the mainland north-westward of it. Mashjan [Lat. 29° 29' NLong. 48° 15' £.), a sandy islet about 10 feet (3 m 0) high, lies on Tharub flat about If miles north-westward of the north-western extremity of Jezirat Failakah. 20 Chart 22. KUWAIT HARBOUR.—Shoal. —This harbour is a bay, the southern shore of which recedes westward from Ras al Ardh for about 20 miles forming three bights in which the depths are for the most part very shallow. The northern shore is low and is fronted by a 25 mud-flat, the 3-fathom (S^) edge of which lies 5 miles offshore in the eastern part of the bay, but only one mile offshore near its head. North-westward of the bay is the Aghthi country, the hills of which are probably from 200 to 300 feet (61 m 0 to 91 m 4) high, and are dusky brown in colour, with a level summit ending abruptly 30 on its seaward side in cliffs. The whole of the surrounding country is elsewhere a desert of white sand. The depths in the harbour are from 10 to 16 fathoms (18 m 3 to 29 m 3) in the entrance, from 5 to 9 fathoms (9 m l to 16 m 5) in the middle, and thence from 4| to 5 fathoms (8 m 2 to 9 m l), deepening again to 35 5^ and 6 fathoms (10 m l and ll m 0) towards its head, which latter is shallow. The shamdl raises a considerable sea in the southern part of the bay, but insufficient' to distress a large vessel, though a heavy swell gets up quickly making boatwork very difficult. The kaus also 40 causes a swell in the harbour, much greater than would be expected from the strength of the wind. The bight between Ras al Ardh and Ras 'Ajuza, situated about 5^ miles west-north-westward, is almost filled with a bank, over which the depths are from one to 2| fathoms (l m 8 to 4 m 6), the outer 45 edge of which lies about 6 cables outside the line joining those points; but a narrow channel, in which the depths are from 7 to 11 fathoms (12 m 8 to 20 I]a l), runs in close to the shore westward of Ras al Ardh. A patch, over which there is a depth of only 3 feet (0 m 9), lies near the end of the bank westward of the entrance of the narrow channel, 50 in a position about 8 cables north-westward of Ras al Ardh. Chart 1213. Port of Kuwait.—Reefs .—Shoals .—The port of Kuwait is in the eastern part of the large indentation, on the southern side of the Charts 22, 1265, 2837b, 748b.236 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Chart 1213. harbour, between Ras 'Ajiiza and Ras Ushairij (Ashairij), situated about SJ miles westward. Duhat Abu Tala, the head of this bight, see chart 22, is filled with extensive sand and mud flats that dry! 5 The town of Kuwait, see page 238, is situated on the eastern shore of the bight close south-westward of Ras 'Ajuza. Ras 'Ajuza is low and from it a rocky flat, that dries about 6 feet (l m 8) and has fish weirs upon it, extends northward for a distance of about 3|- cables; a shoal extends beyond this flat and terminates 10 in a spit, on the eastern side of the approach to Kuwait town, over which there is a depth of 2f fathoms (5 m 0) at a distance of about 1^ miles northward of the point. In a position about 6 cables eastward of the extremity of the spit, there is a depth of 3i fathoms (5 m 9). 15 For a distance of about 8 cables off the frontage of Kuwait town, the depths are less than 2 fathoms (3 m 7), and the beach dries out for a considerable distance, though at high water the sea washes up to the houses; the native boats are hauled up on the beach inside substantial breakwaters constructed of loose stones. At a short 20 distance south-westward of the town are some white sandhills. Fasht al Hadaibah, on the western side of the approach to Kuwait town, is a rocky patch, over which there is a depth of If fathoms (3 m 2), lying about one mile westward of the extremity of the spit extending northward from Ras 'Ajuza; it lies at the north-eastern 25 end of a shallow spit extending from the north-eastern part of Al ' Akaz. Al Akaz is a large reef lying about 1^ miles westward of the southern part of Kuwait town ; its southern part dries, and over its northern part the depths generally are about 2 feet (0 m 6), though 30 there are upon it some rocky patches that dry. Jezirat Kurein is an inconspicuous barren islet on the southern side of Al 'Akaz having a peak, 30 feet (9 m l) high, at its southern extremity. Bandar ash Shuwaik is a small basin, south-eastward of Al 'Akaz, S5 in which the depths are from 2 to 6f fathoms (3 m 7 to 12 m 3), mud.' It is used by native craft and the channel to it passes eastward of Al 'Akaz. Lights.—Buoys. —A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 50 feet (lo m 2), from the Shaikh's house, situated about 3 cables west- south-westward of the extremity of Ras 'Ajuza. This house is the most easterly one in the town of Kuwait. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 58 feet (17^7) from a flagstaff, 88 feet (26^8) high, at the British Residency at Kuwait {Lat. 29° 23'N., Long. 47° 59' E.), situated about 14| cables 45 west-south-westward of Ras 'Ajuza. A black can buoy with spherical topmark is moored close off the end of the spit on the eastern side of the approach to Kuwait town in a position about miles northward of the light on Ras ' Aj uza. 50 A red conical buoy is moored on the eastern edge of Fasht al Hadaibah; vessels drawing more than 10 feet (3 m 0) must not pass over any part of the reef westward of this buoy. A conical buoy, painted in black and white horizontal bands, marks the anchorage off Kuwait town in a position about 12 cables Charts 22, 1265, 2837h, 748b.15o Chap. VII.] KUWAIT HARBOUR 237 Chart 1213. north-north-westward of the British Residency; the greater depths are northward of the buoy. The foregoing buoys are maintained by the Government of India. Anchorage,—Landing. —Southward of Fasht al Hadaibah, and 5 about 1-| miles from Kuwait town, is an area, in which the depths are from 3^ to 5| fathoms (5 m 9 to 10 m l), that is available as an anchorage for vessels of suitable draught. The farther westward within this area that a vessel can anchor, the better is the shelter. Vessels requiring greater depths anchor west-north-westward of 10 Fasht al Hadaibah in from 7 to 9 fathoms (12 m 8 to 16 m 5); but at this anchorage there is little shelter from the kaus. In fine weather there is usually a light land breeze in the morning, and fine easterly to south-easterly sea breezes in the afternoon. Anchorage may also be obtained, by vessels of suitable draught, 15 in Bandar ash Shuwaik with the Shaikh's coal shed, situated about I| miles south-westward of the wall surrounding Kuwait, bearing 204°, distant about 4 cables; Al Akaz, north-westward of this anchorage and the shoal water northward and north-eastward of it, afford little or no protection, and winds from W.N.W., through 20 North, to N.E. raise a breaking sea that makes boatwork dangerous. The holding ground is, however, exceptionally good, and on two occasions in 1928, H.M.S. Lupin rode out a heavy shamal in this anchorage. Except with winds from the above-mentioned directions, the landing facilities are very good on the beach in the vicinity; 25 a sloping hardway extends from the Shaikh's coal shed. Landing at Kuwait may be effected in any of the well sheltered cambers formed by the numerous breakwaters; but they all, including that at the British Residency {Lat. 29° 23' NLong. 47° 59' E.), dry from 2 to 3 feet (0 m 6 to 0 m 9) at springs. 30 Anchorage may also be obtained in Duhat Kadhama, see page 239. Charts 1213, 22, 1265. Directions.—Tidal streams. —From south-eastward, vessels should steer to pass about 10 miles north-eastward of Madaira reef, 35 see page 233, and continue north-westward for about 8 miles into a depth of 10 fathoms (18 m 3). Thence they should steer westward along the southern edge of Abu Jezza flat, keeping in depths between 8 and 10 fathoms (14 m 6 and 18 II1 3) but not increasing them to more than the latter depth. In clear weather, Jezirat Kubbar should be 40 made, and having passed about 3 miles northward of it, vessels should steer west-north-westward towards Sirra hill fort. When about 4 miles from the coast, course should be altered north-north westward to pass about 1|- miles north-eastward of Ras al Ardh; caution should be exercised for there is usually an indraught towards 45 this part of the coast. In hazy weather, it might be well to continue westward, with caution, until the coast is sighted, for it may be approached in safety to a distance of 1| miles. From the Shatt al Arab light-vessel, see page 254, vessels should steer about 196°, in depths not less than 5 fathoms (9 m l), until 50 south-eastward of Jezfrat Failakah, and thence westward in depths between 5 and 7 fathoms (9 ni l and 12 m 8). From eastward, vessels should steer for a position on Abu Jezza flat and thence westward being guided by soundings. Charts 2837b, 748b.238 PERSIAN GULF—SOUTH-WESTERN SIDE [Chap. VII. Charts 1213, 22, 1265. Sirra hill fort, bearing 275°, leads southward of Failakah flat in a least depth of 3f fathoms (6 m 9); the clumps of date trees on the south-western side of Failakah might possibly be sighted. 5 From a position about l\ miles north-eastward of Ras al Ardh, vessels should steer for a position about one mile east-north-eastward of the buoy off the extremity of the spit northward of Ras 'Ajuza. Thence course should be gradually altered to pass, on a south-westerly course, between that buoy and the buoy marking the eastern side 10 oi Fasht al Hadaibah, anchorage being selected as previously directed. Should the buoys not be in position, the peak of Jezirat Kureiri [hat. 29 21 N., Long. 47° 55' E.), bearing 227°, leads midway between Fasht al Hadaibah and the spit eastward of it; the bearing must, however, be carefully maintained for a deviation from it on 15 either side of about 3° leads into shoal water. Vessels proceeding into Bandar ash Shuwaik, should keep on the foregoing bearing, until a telegraph post with a triangular daymark, south-westward of Kuwait town, is in line with a large black and white cairn, about 11 feet (3 m 4) high, southward of it, bearing 196°. 20 On this leading line, a least depth of about If fathoms (3 m 2) may be carried into the basin, see chart 1213. When a black and white beacon, erected about 9 cables north-eastward of the telegraph post, bears 096°, course should be altered for the anchorage. Care should be taken to avoid getting westward of the leading line, until the 25 Residency flagstaff bears less than 080°, for there is a spit with a depth of 7 feet (2 m l) over it close westward of the line. The tidal streams in the entrance of the harbour, eastward of Fasht al Hadaibah, set about east-north-eastward and west-south- westward, and at springs attain a rate of from 2 to 3 knots. In 30 Bandar ash Shuwaik, the tidal streams set fairly through the channel Chart 1213. Kuwait town. —This town, the capital of the Principality of Kuwait, is one of the most important in the Persian gulf; it is built on a considerable slope, the houses behind being about 50 35 feet (15 m 2) above those on the sea front. It is surrounded, on its landward side, by a wall in which are 38 towers and 4 gates. The houses are mostly of stone and sun-dried bricks, though there is a large suburb of mat huts, outside the town proper. The Shaikh's palace, about 3 cables south-westward of the British 40 Residency, has a small roof which is the highest point of any building in the town; in front of the palace there is a flagstaff. The hospital and the residence of the doctor attached to the American mission are just south-westward of the town; the hospital is small but very up-to-date; Europeans can be admitted in an emergency. 45 A British Political Agent is stationed at Kuwait. The diseases prevalent are those of the digestive system, granular conjunctivitis, and tuberculosis. Between November, 1921, and March, 1922, 3 inches (76 mm ) of rain fell; none fell during the remainder of the year. 50 For Meteorological tables, see page 287. Port facilities. Trade. Local sailing craft bring dates from Basra, and do much trade both in the Gulf and with such distant ports as Zanzibar, Hodeida, Socotra, and those on the Malabar coast of India. Horses are occasionally exported. Timber and Charts 22, 1265, 2837b, 748b.3* Chap. VII.] KUWAIT HARBOUR 239 Chart 1213. rice are brought from India, Kuwait is much visited by the Beddwin, who bring horses, camels, sheep, &amp;c., to barter for dates, clothes, arms, &amp;c. There is a considerable dhow building industry in the town. 5 Sheep can be procured; vegetables, except tomatoes when in season, are scarce in quantity and indifferent in quality. The water in the district is unfit for Europeans to drink unless boiled; water for the better classes in the town is brought in tank-boats from the Shatt al 'Arab; it can be supplied to shipping at from 3 to 5 10 days' notice. During the year 1931, 98 British vessels, 2 German vessels, and one Norwegian, visited Kuwait. Communications. —There is an 'Iraqi Government telegraph station and post office at Kuwait although Indian postage stamps 15 are issued there ; both are close to the British Residency, see page 236. Communication is maintained by motor car with Basra, a distance of 108 miles. For steamship communications, see page 28. 20 Chart 1214. Duhat Kadhama.—Reefs.—Beacon. —This bay is that portion of Kuwait harbour lying westward of Ras Ushairij, see page 236, which latter is about 12 feet (3 m 7) high. The shores of the bay are low, sandy, and covered with scrub. The southern shore of the 25 bay is bordered by sandy or rocky shoals, on which are many fish traps, to a distance of about 1^ miles offshore. Jezfrat Umm an Namil, lying close eastward of Ras Ushairij, is rocky and about 10 feet (3 m 0) high. A beacon, 51 feet (15 m 5) high, with a triangular topmark, has 30 been erected on Jezirat Umm an Namil. A conspicuous building stands about 2 cables north-north-eastward of the beacon. Kita 'atain Ushairij, lying about 1^ miles north-westward of Ras Ushairij, is a small rock over which there is a depth of 1J fathoms (2 m 3). {Lat. 29° 24' N., Long. 47° 50' E.) 35 Kutat Abu Taleh, lying about three-quarters of a mile south- westward of Kita 'atain Ushairij, is a small reef nearly awash; small 3 and 5-foot (0 m 9 and l m 5) patches lie, respectively, about half a mile and 1J miles south-westward of Kutat Abu Taleh. All the foregoing reefs lie close inside the 5-fathom (9 m l) line on 40 the southern side of Duhat Kadhama and close to or actually joining the shoals extending from the shore. Ras Kadhama, on the northern shore of Kuwait harbour about 5| miles west-north-westward of Ras Ushairij, is swampy and only just above water at high tide. At about half a mile inland from the 45 north-western shore of Duhat Kddhama, the ground, sandy and covered with scrub, rises gradually to the foot of a range of hills from 21 to 3 miles inland; north-westward of the head of the harbour, these hills attain an elevation of 410 feet (125 m 0). North-eastward of Ras Kddhama, a soft mud-fiat, that makes 50 landing very difficult at low water, extends offshore for a distance varying from 3 cables to over one mile. Fasht Oushair, over which the depth is less than 6 feet (l m 8). Charts 22, 1265, 2837h, 748b.240 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VII. Chart 1214. lies, about 1| miles offshore, about 5 miles north-eastward of Ras Kadhama; with the exception of this reef, the depths on the north western side of the bay decrease gradually towards the mud-flat. 5 The head of Duhat Kadhama, westward of Ras Kadhama, is shallow. Khwesat, situated about If miles west-south-westward of Ras Kddhama, is the only landing place in the head of the bay, Fasht al Jathir, lying about 8 cables south-westward of Ras 10 Kadhama , dries 11 feet (SmS); there is a boat passage on its northern side leading to the landing place. Jahra is a village about 1^ miles south-westward of the head of Duhat Kadhama. Anchorage .—The outer part of Duhat Kddhama affords anchorage, 15 in depths of from 5 to 6 fathoms (9 m l to ll ni 0), for a large number of vessels; it is the only good anchorage for large vessels in the northern part of the Persian gulf, and is sheltered from the shamal. To reach the anchorage, however, a bank, that extends from shore to shore across the bay and over which the depths are from 44 to 5 20 fathoms (7 m 8 to 9 m l), must be crossed. Charts 1235, 1265. KUWAIT HARBOUR TO THE SHATT AL ARAB.— Khor as Sabiya is a narrow channel, in which the depths are from 2 to 10 fathoms (3 m 7 to 18 m 3), that extends north-north-westward 25 ior about 25 miles, and thence east-north-eastward for about miles, from a position about 2^ miles north-eastward of the point on the mainland on the northern side of the entrance of Kuwait harbour; the southern approach to the khor, over Tharub flat, is very shallow and in it are numerous rocks and dry patches; it is accessible 30 to boats, but only when the tide is above mean sea level. Sabiya, on the mainland at the southern entrance of Khor as Sabiya, is a ruined mud enclosure surrounded by tamarisks and a few date trees; the water in the well there is brackish. Jezlrat Bubiyan is a large, low, barren island that is partly covered S5 at high water; it is separated from the mainland by Khor as Sabiya, on its western and northern sides, and by Khor 'Abdullah on its eastern side. Ras al Buraisha [Lai. 29 35 NLong. 48° 13' E.), the southern most point of Jezlrat Bubiydn, is situated about 7 miles north- 40 westward of the north-western extremity of Jezirat Failakah. The flat of mud, sand, and rocks that connects Jezirat Failakah to the mainland continues north-eastward as a mud-flat extending for a distance of about 3 miles from the south-eastern side of Jezirat Bubiyan, and there are depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5), or less within 45 8 miles of that side of the latter island. Ras al Qaid, near which is a conspicuous fort, is the easternmost pomt of Jezirat Bubiyan and is situated about 15 miles north-eastward of Ras al Buraisha. Khor Abdullah, see chart 1235, trends in a north-westerly direction 50 between the north-eastern side of Jezirat Bubiyan and the south western sides of Marakat 'Abdullah, sgg page 254, and the land north westward of that flat, to its junction with Khor as Sabiya, off the north-eastern point of the island. Both shores of the khor are low Charts 2837b, 748b.:&gt; Chap. VII.] KUWAIT HARBOUR TO SHATT AL 'ARAB 241 Charts 1235, 1265. alluvial land, covered in places with reeds and grass, and with shallow flats extending a long way from them, but much farther from the north-eastern shore and Marakat 'Abdullah than from the south western shore. 5 Fasht al aik, lying about 6| miles east-south-eastward of Ras al Qaid, is a detached bank of hard sand, over which there is a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9); six separate detached patches, over which the depths are from 2| to 3 fathoms (4 m 6 to 5 m 5), lie within 3 miles north eastward and 5| miles east-south-eastward of Fasht al aik. Shoals, 10 over which the depths are from one to 3 fathoms (l m 8 to 5 m 5), lie within a distance of about 4| miles south-eastward of Fasht al aik, and others, which dry in places, lie within 7J miles north-westward of it. Khor al Qaid, a channel in which there is a least depth of 11 fathoms 15 (2 In 7), leads north-westward between the foregoing shoals and Ras al Qaid. Jezirat Warbah, an island mostly low, fiat, and covered with reeds and coarse grass, lies northward of Jezirat BubiycLn, and is separated from it by the northern end of Kh6r as Sabiya. On its 20 northern and north-western sides, respectively, it is separated from the mainland by Khor Shetana and Khor Sakaa. A sand spit, over which the depths are from one to 6 feet (0 m 3 to l m 8), extends nearly 1|- miles eastward from the island, and a detached 3-fathom (5 m 5) patch lies in mid-channel about 2 miles south-eastward of the 25 extremity of the spit. Khor Umm Qasr (Kasr) extends north-westward from Khor Sakaa for about 4 miles to Umm Qasr fort, on its western bank, above which it is apparently known as Khor Zobeir. There is plenty of good fresh water at the fort. {Lat. 30° 02' NLong. 47° 56' E .) 30 Anchorage.—Directions .—Anchorage may be obtained by vessels with local knowledge anywhere in Kh5r 'Abdullah above Ras al Qaid according to draught, but it is not advisable to anchor below that point. Anchorage may also be obtained in Khor Umm Qasr about 2 miles 35 below the fort, but abreast the latter there is very little room. Considerable difficulty may be experienced in fixing the position of the vessel in the approach to, and in, Khor 'Abdullah; the following objects are available but can only be identified in the clearest weather; Shatt al 'Arab light-vessel; the tidal semaphore, see page 257; the 40 conspicuous fort, on the eastern side of Jezirat Bubiyan, near Ras al Qaid; and Fao flagstaff, see page 261, which last is not readily identified though its position is indicated by a clump of dark trees conspicuous in the line of date palms. The navigable channel in Khor 'Abdullah passes between Marakat 45 'Abdullah, and the shoal water extending from it and the coast farther north-westward, on the north-eastern side, and Fasht al aik, with the shoals lying off it, and the flats extending from Jezirat Bubiydn, on the south-western side. Between the 3-fathom (5 m 5) lines, it varies in width from one mile to about 4 miles, but depths of from 50 3^ to 4 fathoms (5 m 9 to 7 m 3) can be carried to about 3|- miles below Jezirat Warbah; thence, 3| fathoms (6 m 4) may be carried to the channels on either side of that island, but the southern one is not recommended. A depth of 15 feet (4 m 6) can apparently be carried Charts 2837b, 748b.^ HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VII.

GENERAL REMARKS.—Aspect. —From Ras ash Shatt, see page 162, the Persian coast trends in a general north-north-westerly direction for about 73 miles to the head of Duhat Dilam [Lat. 30° 11' NLong. 50° 03' E.), the north-eastern bight of 5 the Persian gulf, whence it extends west-south-westward for about 26 miles to Ras ul Bahrgan, westward of which latter is the delta formed by the rivers of Persia and 'Iraq. Jezirat Kharg and Jezirat Khargu are the only off-lying islands and are situated, about 15 miles offshore, 19 miles north-westward 10 of Ras ash Shatt. Northward of the parallel of the latter island the general depths in the Gulf are less than 20 fathoms (36 m 6), decreasing towards the mouths of the rivers and the shores of Duhat Dilam. There are no off-lying dangers between Ras ash Shatt and Ras 15 ul Bahrgan; but shoal water extends from 2 to 4 miles from the coast between them. The towns on this part of the coast are small and the population for the most part Persian. The coast generally is low and the mountains, with the exception 20 of Kuh-i-Bang, lie at some distance inland. Kuh-i-Bang is about 1,000 feet (304 m 8) high and is situated about 42 miles north-north-westward of Ras ash Shatt; its summit lies about 2 miles inland and its seaward face is precipitous; when seen from southward it appears as a conspicuous bluff; see view 25 M on chart 2837b and view facing page 247. The range, of which Kuh-i-Bang is a part, extends, parallel with the coast, for a distance of about 12 miles. At about 15 miles north-north-westward of Kuh Khormuj, see page 158, and about 26 miles eastward of Bushire, is a mountain 30 ridge, about 4,000 feet (1219 m 2) high, that has summits at either end and near its centre, and the crest of which is deeply serrated. Gisakan bluff, about 5,350 feet (1630 m 7) high, is situated about 22 miles northward of the central summit of the ridge just remarked on and rises at the northern end of a range in the crest of which 35 there is a step. See view on chart 27 and view K on chart 2837b. The land between this range and the coast appears to be low. Chart 748b.I 244 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 2837b. A round-topped mountain, the summit of which is capped with snow in winter, rises, about 41 miles north-eastward of Gisakan bluff, to an elevation of about 10,200 feet (3109 m 0). 6 A series of ranges, lying from 30 to 40 miles inland, extends northward from Gisakan bluff; rising behind these ranges, can be seen the summits of much higher mountains, which latter are covered in winter with snow. Separated from Kuh-i-Bang by a valley is a range, about 15 iO miles inland, which rises to heights of from 2,000 to 3,000 feet (609 m 6 to but has no conspicuous peak; its southern end is situated about 26 miles north-eastward of Ras ash Shatt. A range of hills, lower than the above, trends west-north-westward to a position about 4 miles northward of the head of Duhat Dilam, 15 whence it turns north-westward into the interior and decreases in height; this range is the westernmost of the Persian hills, the whole of the head of the gulf being a low alluvial plain. Rising from this range, at about 26 miles north-eastward of Kuh-i-Bang, is a sharp peak, 44 miles north-westward of which is Funnel hill 20 550 feet (167 m 6) high. Kuh Behbehan, situated about 26 miles north-eastward of the sharp peak just remarked on, is a great mountain mass of irregular outline lying in an easterly and westerly direction; its summit, at an altitude of 10,400 feet (3169 m 9), is snow-clad for six months 25 of the year. Tidal streams. —Southward of Duhat Dilam, the tidal streams set northward and southward along the coast; from the head of the bight to Ras ul Bahrgan they set south-westward and north eastward. The rate is from one to 1|- knots, increasing to from 30 2 to 3 knots as the mouths of the rivers are approached. Coast. —From Ras ash Shatt, the coast trends north-north westward for about 5 miles to the entrance of Khor Rud Hilleh and is low and sandy with here and there tufts of grass; the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies about 21 miles, and the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line 1J J5 miles offshore. Khor Rud Hilleh is the mouth of Rud Hilleh river, which latter is formed by the junction of the Shapur and Dalaki rivers about 30 miles inland; the Rud Hilleh floods regularly after the melting of the snow in the mountains. The river is navigable by small 40 craft to Rud Hilleh village, situated near a clump of date trees about six miles north-eastward of its mouth, from which place grain is exported. The entrance of the river is shallow, and the banks cover at high water. There are several other inlets on this part of the coast; their 45 entrances are all shallow, but they are deeper inside. Chart 2837b, plan of Kharg and Khdrgu. Off-lying islands. —Jezirat Kharg is the southern and larger of two islands and its southern extremity is situated about 18 miles westward of the entrance of Khor Rud Hilleh. Table-topped SO hills extend from north to south through the island, and near its centre, on a hill 284 feet (86 m 6) high, is a small tomb; another, known as Dedabuun or Muhammad's Watchman {Lat. 29° 15' N Long. 50° 19' E.) is situated about 3 cables north-eastward and there are several other similar tombs on the island. The hills at Chart 748b.Chap. VIII.] OFF-LYING ISLANDS 245 Chart 2837b, plan of Kharg and Khdrgu. the southern end of the island terminate in precipitous bluffs, and on the southern point are detached table-topped hummocks. Towards the north-western point of the island the hills decrease in height and end in cliffs from 20 to 30 feet (6^1 to 9 m l) high. 5 Near the middle of the northern end of the island is a quoin-shaped hill, about 200 feet (61 m 0) high, close northward of which stood, in 1921, a solitary date tree that was conspicuous from northward but not so from eastward; except from northward, the hill itself is somewhat conspicuous. Near the centre of the island stood, 10 in 1929, a dillapidated date palm that is indicated on the plan on chart 2837b as a conspicuous tree; standing entirely alone, it was then unmistakable in clear weather, though it appeared more like a beacon than a tree. [Lat. 29° 14' N., Long. 50° 19' E.) The western coast of Jezfrat Kharg consists of several rocky 15 points, between which are sandy beaches, the hills on that side ending abruptly in cliffs; the eastern coast is sandy. On the eastern side of the island is a cultivated plain terminating in Fort point, its north-eastern extremity; on this low, sandy point are the ruins of a Dutch fort, built in 1754. The flagstaff shown on the plan on chart 2837b, nearly half a mile southward of the fort, is difficult to identify as it is but a few feet high, painted black, and attached to the gable end of a house. The tomb about half a mile farther southward is, however, conspicuous. Near Fort point is a village, the inhabitants of which are mostly fisherfolk. The largest of 25 the dhows belonging to the island go to the pearl banks near Bahrein; they leave every year about the middle of June and return at the end of September. Gazelle may be found on the hills, and the inhabitants possess some flocks of goats. Drinking water is obtained from wells near the east coast. Fowls, 30 eggs, milk, fish, and sometimes vegetables, can usually be obtained from the natives. The climate of Kharg is said to be far less trying, in hot weather, than that of Bushire. Jezfrat Khargu, the southern end of which is situated about 2J miles northward of Fort point, is composed of white sand with &lt;35 a thin covering of coarse grass; it is very low, but had, in 1909, a conspicuous tree on it about one mile from its southern extremity. There are no permanent inhabitants on the island. Dangers.—Caution.— Jezfrat Kharg is fringed by a rocky reef that extends offshore about 4 cables from its southern and western 40 coasts, half a mile from its northern coast, and about 3 cables from its eastern coast; close outside the reef on the eastern coast there are depths of from 4 to 7 fathoms (7 m 3 to 12 m 8). A sand spit, over which the depths are from 3| to 6 fathoms (6 m 4 to ll m 0), extends in an easterly direction for about 8 cables from Fort point, 45 with depths of from 6 to 8 fathoms (ll m 0 to 14 m 6) close-to on either side of it. From its dark brown colour, Jezfrat Kharg can seldom be seen on a dark night; though by moonlight it sometimes shows as a white streak, but not until close-to. 50 Jezfrat Khargu is fringed, except at its northern end which is steep-to, by a flat rocky reef that extends from 5 to 8 cables off shore, with depths of from 6 to 10 fathoms (ll m 0 to 18 m 3) close outside it. From the southern part of this reef a shoal, over which Chart 748b.246 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 2837b, plan of Kharg and Khdrgu. the depths are from 4 to 4^ fathoms (7 m 3 to 8 m 2), rock, extends in a south-easterly direction for about half a mile, Jezirat Khargu cannot be seen at night until dangerously close-to. 5 In the channel between the two islands, the fairway between the reefs is about one mile wide; but the depths, from 5 to 9 fathoms (9 m l to 16 m 5), hard bottom, are irregular and are carried close to the reefs. Anchorage.—Landing. —The most convenient summer anchorage, 10 sheltered from the shamal, is on the eastern side of Jezirat Kharg' about 4 cables offshore, in a depth of about 8 fathoms (14 m 6), with the quoin-shaped hill just open southward of the ruins of the fort, bearing about 287°. In winter, vessels should anchor farther out,' in about 10 fathoms (18 m 3), so that, should a kaus come on, berth 15 could be shifted to a position north-westward of Fort point, where shelter could be obtained, in a depth of about 7 fathoms (12 m 8), with the eastern angle of the fort bearing 160°, distant about 9 cables. In either position, however, the holding ground is rocky and indifferent, so that, during winter, a vessel should be ready 2^ to shift berth to the opposite side of Fort point, which should be effected without delay immediately the necessity for the change has become apparent. There is a small mooring buoy, situated about 3^ cables north eastward of the Customs-house flagstaff in the fort; but it is of 25 little use as such, for on the south-going tide there is a race over the spit and the stream attains great strength. Owing to trees m its vicinity, the Customs-house flagstaff is difficult to distinguish on certain bearings. The best landing on Jezfrat Kharg at low water is northward 30 of the eastern angle of the fort, where there is a small pier; at high water, landing can be effected anywhere on the beach inside the reef. The best landing on Jezi'rat Khargu is at its north-eastern extremity. 55 Trv I ' idal streams -— In vicinity of Jezi'rat Kharg and Jezirat hargu, the tidal streams set north-westward and south-eastward at a rate sometimes exceeding 2 knots Chart 2837b. Coast.—Anchorage. —From Khor Rud Hilleh {Lat. 29° 11' N. 40 Long. 50° 39^ E.), the coast trends northward for about 17 miles to Bandar Rig and is low and sandy, the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line Ivinff about 2 miles offshore. J b Khor-ul-Qusair (Gasair), situated about 10 miles northward of Khor Rud Hilleh, is frequented by large boats; near its mouth 45 is a small village. Bandar Rig is the port and chief town of the Persian coastal sub-chstnct of Hayat Davud; it is small and its inhabitants are of mixed descent. There is a small creek at the town, fronted bv two sandy islets or banks, inside which native boats lie aground 50 at low water.

From Bandar Rig the coast trends north-westward for about 8 miles to Ganaveh and is low and sandy; the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lies about 3^ miles, and the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line about li miles offshore. Ganaveh.—Anchorage. —-This place consists of a group of three villages situated about half a mile inland, at which there are a few date and other trees and a large tomb with a spire, and, close north-westward, a large round banyan tree with three dark round trees close to it. The inhabitants are chiefly agricultural. Water is scarce, but fowls, cattle, and vegetables are obtainable. Khor Khalil is the tidal mouth of a river about 1^ miles southward of the banyan tree at Ganaveh; drying sands extend for a distance of about 2 cables off the mouth of the river. Large dhows, which can enter at high water, carry on a small coasting trade. The Anglo-Persian Oil Company has an establishment at Khor Khalil; the living quarters are situated south-eastward of the entrance, and farther south-eastward are a water tank, windmill pump, and the dep6t buildings. The approach to Khor Khalll is across a bar, over which the depths are from one to 2 feet (0 m 3 to 0 m 6), lying about half a mile offshore. A small spar buoy with brush topmark is established on the eastern side of the channel across the bar, and between it and the mouth of the river that side of the channel is marked in places by slender poles. Within Khor Khalil, the deepest water is on the starboard hand when entering, and about 2 cables within the entrance is a concrete jetty with steps, the property of the Oil Company, which affords good sheltered landing at all states of the tide. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of about 3 fathoms (5 m 5), at a distance of about miles offshore south-westward of the banyan tree; the holding ground, clay and mud, is good; large vessels anchor farther out. At low water, landing on the beach is bad for several ridges of dry sand, with depths of about 2 feet (0 m 6) inside them, must be crossed. Light.—W/T masts. —A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 27 feet (8 m 2), at Ganaveh {Lat. 29° 34' N., Long. 50° 31' E.). A W/T station is situated about three-quarters of a mile south eastward of the entrance of Kh5r Khalll; the two masts, each 120 feet (36 m 6) in height, are the best marks for identifying the locality. See view facing this page. Coast.—Anchorage. —From Ganaveh, the coast trends north westward for about 7 miles to Sabzpushan, and is low and sandy, the 5-fathom (9 m l) line lying about 3| miles and the 3-fathom (5 m 5) line about 1^ miles offshore. Kalat Haidar, situated about 5 miles north-westward of Ganaveh, is a small village near which are a few date trees ; the inhabitants are agricultural. Sabzpushan is a slightly projecting rocky point, rising steeply to hillocks from 40 to 50 feet (12 m 2 to 15 m 2) high; on its summit is a tomb which cannot be seen until close inshore. A rocky reef fringes the point and extends for a distance of about cables from it; there is a little watercourse close eastward of the point. Chart 748b.248 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 2837b. The coast northward falls within the Liravi sub-district, see page 5. From Sabzpushan, the coast trends north-westward for about 5 24 miles to Ras at Tanb. Under the highest part of Kuh-i-Bang, a small tomb surmounts one of the coastal hillocks, which are about 50 feet (15m2) high in a position about 7 miles north-westward of Sabzpushan. Between Sabzpushan and this tomb there are no reefs extending more than 10 2 cables offshore; the 5-fathom (9 m l) line is about U miles distant and thence the depths increase to 10 fathoms (18 m 3) at about 4 miles offshore. Khor Smi, situated about 16 miles north-westward of Sabzpushan is a small inlet with a depth of about 2 feet (0 m 6) in its entrance' iJ but deeper water within. Imam Hasan is a small village, with some trees near it, situated about 1| miles southward of Khor Smi; in it is an old and con spicuous mosque. _ Asshar castle, with 4 large round towers, is conspicuous and is situated about miles eastward of the entrance of Khor Smi; behmd the castle is the large village of Asshar, the inhabitants plentiM appear t0 be P r0£ P erous ' water and supplies being fairly In 1922, H.M.S.

Khor al Abd, situated about 4 miles north-westward of Khor Smi and Khor Lailatain, about 3 miles farther in that direction are both small. 30 Ras at Tanb {Lai. 29' 57' N., Long. 50' 09' E.) is the low, sandy south-eastern point of Duhat I'ilam; dry sands extend nearly one mile seaward of the point and shallows project some distance beyond mfles inshore of the sandy coast is swampy for many 36 1 t0mb under K uh-i-Bang and Ras at Tanb, the o-iatliom (jmj) hne gradually increases its distance from the coast ln 1 0 . ie ^-ter it is about 5 miles offshore; the depths seaward are under 10 fathoms (18^3), the 10-fathom (18^3) line trending ^estward from a position about 10 miles westward of Kiih-i- 40 Jtsang. Dilam.

The coast m the vicinity is merely a strip of rocky land, from Chart 748b.Chap. VIII.] coast of liravi 249 Chart 2837b. 10 to 15 feet (3 m 0 to 4 m 6) high, within which swamps extend for many miles inland. Mud flats dry off the town of Dilam, but in them is a small creek which dries and in which native craft lie. Landing is difficult, 5 even at high water. The bottom is hard sand for a distance of about 3 cables offshore, and soft mud farther out. The 2-fathom (3 m 7) line lies about 1| miles offshore. Anchorage may be obtained, in a depth of about 4 fathoms (7 m 3), soft mud, at about 3^ miles offshore, or in 3 fathoms (5 m 5), clay, 10 at about 2| miles from the town. The anchorage is sheltered from the shamal, and the kaus does not raise the usual sea and swell, though it blows with strength. Dilam exports grain, cotton, wool, ghi, etc., chiefly to Bushire and Kuwait. Fish, cattle, and poultry are plentiful, but not immediately obtainable in any quantity. Gazelle are reported in the neighbourhood. The quality of the water is indifferent. Shah Abul Shah, situated on the hillocks at the head of Duhat Dilam, about 8 miles north-north-westward of Dilam, is a village in which is a large white-domed tomb, A small creek gives access 20 to the village and some coasting trade is carried on. From Shah Abul Shah, the shore of Duhat Dilam trends west- south-west ward for about 28 miles to Ras ul Bahrgdn and, though shoal water extends nearly 4 miles offshore, it may be approached in safety if soundings are taken for the depths decrease regularly. 25 The land westward of Shah Abul Shah and the hills terminating in Funnel hill, see page 244, is exceedingly low across the head of the Persian gulf to Kuwait, about 115 miles south-westward, forming as it does the deltas of the great rivers. Ras ul Bahrgan is a very low strip of sand which is nearly covered 30 at high water; inland the country is swampy for many miles and depths of 3 fathoms (5 m 5) will be found 4 miles southward of the point. Mud flats, which cover at high water, extend for some miles on either side of the point; eastward of it, the mud being soft for about half a mile offshore, landing is impossible. There 35 are two conspicuous date groves about 3 miles northward of the point {Lat. 30° 01' N., Long. 49° 35' E.). Zuhreh river. —'This river, the lower reaches of which are more commonly called Hindian river, flows into the Persian gulf a few miles north-westward of Ras ul Bahrgan. It appears to have several 40 mouths forming a delta and but one main channel. 1 he principal entrance is very shallow and has been but partially surveyed. The approach to it, through an extensive mud flat, is marked by poles with tin cans for topmarks. The craft using the river are, as a rule, of from 20 to 30 tons, but a steam vessel drawing 8 feet 45 (2 m 4) has ascended as far as the town of Hindian, reported to be situated about 30 miles up stream. The river is very tortuous and some of the reaches approach within 2 miles of the shore of Duhat Dilam. Mir Na' aman shrine stands on the right bank of Zuhreh river, 50 about 6| miles above its mouth. Hindian has a population of about 1,500, and is a port for native craft; cereals are exported. Sirima, situated about 9 miles north-westward of Ras ul Bahrgan, Chart 748b.250 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 2837b. is a small clump of trees on the low shore; it is a mark for the entrance of Zuhreh river, the delta of which latter lies between these trees and the point. 5 Chart 1265. Shoals in the approach to Khor Musa.—Buoy.— Fasht al Miairiz is a bank of sand and mud that dries in patches 4 and extends to a position about 12 miles south-south-eastward of Ras at Tullub, a low projection of the mainland situated about 18 miles north-westward of Ras ul Bahrgan. It is separated from the point and the coast eastward of it by Khor Ghazlan, a channel in which the general depths are about 9 feet (2 m 7). This channel is itself approached through Khor Bahrgan, between Fasht al Miairiz, on the western side, and the flats westward of Ras ul .Bahrgan, on the 15 eastern side. Khor Bahrgan is about miles wide with depths m it of from 1^ to 3 fathoms (2 m 7 to 5 m 5). A red conical buoy is moored southward of Fasht al Miairiz in a position about 15| miles south-south-eastward of Ras at Tullub. r} , 1S ma i nta i ne d for the guidance of tugs proceeding to and from 20 Zuhreh river. A shoal, over which there is a depth of only 6 feet (l m 8), is icported in a position about llf miles south-south -westward of Ras at Tullub. Aich Shaham, a small sandbank, over which the depth is less 2&lt;5 than 6 feet (l m 8), rises from depths of from 3 to 6 fathoms (5^5 to 11^0) about II miles south-westward of Ras at Tullub South-westward of Aich Shaham is the bar {Lat. 30° 00' N Long 49° 03' E.) at the entrance of Khor Musa, southward and south -south -eastward of which latter are the shoals in the approach 30 to the Shatt al 'Arab, see page 253. Khor Musa. Beacons.—Buoys. —This remarkable inlet is entered between Ras at Tullub and Bu Sif, situated about 19 miles south-westward; but navigation is restricted by tidal flats that ry m places to a comparatively narrow channel near the western 35 shore of the estuary. At about miles north-westward of Ras at Tullub is the mouth of a river or creek with extensive ruins on its banks. The coast north-westward is nearly all covered at high water and has not sn ^® e . n surve y e( i'' ^ is fronted by the tidal flats remarked on above, ^0 which latter are intersected by a number of deep channels that also have not been surveyed. Bu Sif, the western entrance point of Kh5r Musa, is the south eastern extremity of Dorakistan, a low swampy tract intersected by creeks, that extends eastward for about 15 miles to the mouth of Bahmanshir river, see page 275. Khor Silaik Bahri, entered close westward of Bu Sif, has a depth of about 6 feet (l m 8) at its mouth and is said to connect with the Karun river, page 276* * S r Kuwairm, the entrance of which lies about 8 miles westward k i'? ^ c ° n ? ects wit* 1 the Karun river, but neither of these &lt;5c/has been explored for any distance. The navigable channel of Khor Musa is entered across a bar, ymg from / 2 to 12^ miles south-eastward of Bu Sif, over which the least depth, m 1930, was 22 feet (6^7). Within the bar, the Charts 2837b, 748b.Chap. VIII.] KHOR MUSA 251 Chart 1265. channel is about miles wide and the depths in it are from 5|- to over 17 fathoms (10 m l to SI 111 !). A small black conical buoy is moored about 3 miles southward of the bar. 5 The passage across the bar is marked by beacons, those on the western side consisting of triple piles and those on the eastern side of single piles; in addition small black conical buoys mark the western side and red can buoys the eastern side. These buoys are constantly dragging out of position. 1( * A drying sandbank, close north-eastward of the bar, is marked by a most conspicuous triple pile beacon the upper 5 feet (l m 5) of which is covered with zinc plating. Above the bar, the channel is marked by buoys in a similar manner, but they are very unreliable, and it is reported that they are being i5 replaced by pile beacons. Khor Abu Khadhair extends westward from a position about 19 miles northward of Bu Sif; within its entrance its banks are steep-to, but there are flats on either side of its mouth, see plan on chart 1265. _ 20 At about 6| miles above the entrance of Khor Abu Khadhair, Khor Musa alters its direction and trends eastward for about 8 miles to the mouth of Khor Dorak. Khor Dorak trends north-westward and is somewhat tortuous in its lower reaches, above which it trends northward and probably 25 connects with the Karun river. The main channel continues east-north-eastward for about 6 miles and thence, under the name of Khor Ma 'shiir, trends north- north-east ward for about 7 miles. Islands and dangers. —The islands and islets mentioned below SO lie on the great tidal flats on the eastern side of Khor Musa. Bunneh, the eastern end of which is situated about 2 miles westward of Ras at Tullub, is a low, narrow island, on which is a ruin. Dara, lying about 3^ miles south-westward of the western end 35 of Bunneh, and separated from it by Kh5r Wasta, is low and in places swampy. Kassar bin Siswan is a rocky drying shoal that lies in the channel about 11 miles above Bu Sif; it is steep-to and could be passed on either side, though the main channel passes westward of it.^ 40 Kabr an Nakhuda is a low islet, on the flats on the eastern side of the channel, situated about miles north-north-eastward of Kassar bin Siswan. Bu Suf is a white sandy islet on which there is a cairn, 7 feet (2 m l) in height, situated about 4 miles west-north-westward of Kabr 45 an Nakhuda. Bandar Shapur. —Works are in progress in Khor Musa, at a short distance above the mouth of Khor Dorak, for the building of wharves and the formation of a port that is destined to be the terminus of the railway which runs through Ahwaz to Dizful, and 50 will eventually be extended to Tehran. See also page 28. A pier [Lat. 30° 27' N., Long. 49° 05' E.) has been constructed for the use of vessels bringing material for the port and railway. The berthing accommodation is 350 feet (106 m 7) in length and it Charts 2837b, 748b.252 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 1265. is proposed to extend it to 500 feet {152 m 4). The depth alongside is 25 feet (7 m 6). Directions.—Anchorage.—Tidal streams .—Having crossed the 5 bar, vessels not in possession of local knowledge should anchor, in a depth of 7 fathoms (12 m 8) about 3 miles above it and wait until the tide has fallen sufficiently to uncover the mud flat on the western side. This bank is steep-to, and by following it the vessel may proceed to Khor Abu Khadhair. 10 The tidal streams run N.N.W. and S.S.E., turning about the times of high and low water, respectively. The greatest rate observed, in February, 1922, was 1^ knots. Caution should be exercised when passing Kassar bin Siswan, for the ebb tidal stream there attains a rate of about 3 knots and 15 causes eddies and tide rips over the shoal. Anchorage may be obtained off the mouth of Khor Abu Khadhair with Bu Suf bearing 095°, distant about \\ miles, see plan on chart 1265. {Lat. 30° 19' N., Long. 48° 53' E.) Khor Abu Khadhair can be ascended some 5 miles above its 20 junction with Khor Musa by keeping in mid-channel; farther up, the channel becomes too narrow for a vessel of any length to turn. Above Khor Abu Khadhair, the left bank of Khor Musa is well defined and always above high water. Both banks are marked by small mud cairns erected as surveying marks. The left bank 25 is steep-to as far as Bandar Shapur, about 15 miles above the mouth of Kh5r Abu Khadhair, and forms a guide to the channel. A Persian pilot is available, and his services may be obtained by communicating with the ship's agents at Ahwaz; he will meet a vessel in the vicinity of the outer buoy. 30 SHATT AL 'ARAB.—General remarks. —This important river is formed by the confluence of the rivers Tigris, see page 271, and Euphrates, see page 275, which takes place at Qurna, some 110 miles from the open waters of the Persian gulf. Parallel with, and eastward of the lower half of the Shatt al Arab, flows the 35 Bahmanshir river, see page 275, which forms the outlet to the sea of the Karun river, see page 276; this latter is connected to the Shatt al 'Arab by Hafar channel, an artificial cutting, and the large island thus formed between the Shatt al 'Arab and Bahmanshir river is known as Jezirat al Khidhr or Abadan island. Mohammerah, 40 see page 266, is situated on the northern bank of Hafar channel, and the port of Basra, see page 267, is in the Shatt al 'Arab about 19 miles above the entrance of Hafar channel. Abadan, see page 264, at which place are the refineries of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, is situated on the island of that name on the left bank of the Shatt 45 al Arab, about 8 miles south-eastward of Mohamrnerah, with Bawarda about one mile below it. The eastern bank of the Shatt al Arab as far up as Failiyeh creek, that is, about 3J miles above the entrance of Hafar channel, is Persian; the western bank from the entrance of the river to 50 Failiyeh creek, and both banks above that, are in 'Iraqi territory. The Shalt al Arab is navigable by any vessel able to cross the bar at its entrance as far as Basra harbour, see page 254. At the mouth of the river, both banks are very low and are Charts 2837b, 748b.f Chap. VIII.] SHATT AL 'ARAB 253 Chart 1265. . rr , AT bordered by date palms. Ras al Bisha {Lat. 29 oo IS., Long. 48° 33' E.), the western entrance point, has some small date trees on it, and the ruins of an old Turkish fort stand on the bank of the river about If miles north-westward of the point; on the &lt;5 opposite bank, about 2 miles northward of the ruins of the old Turkish fort, is an old Persian mud fort. The seaward and lower parts of the banks on both side? of the river are thickly overgrown with reeds and coarse grass; the soil, being a soft alluvial mud, is so soft that it is almost impossible to land, and the attempt 10 should not be made anywhere near the forts. Above the entrance, the banks on both sides continue very low to and beyond Basra, and are intersected by numerous irrigation canals; excepting the bunds enclosing the plantations, the land is often submerged. The belt of land near the river from Fao, 15 situated about 3 miles above the ruins of the old Turkish fort, as far, and for a few miles above, Qurna, is exceedingly fertile and produces very fine dates as well as grain, and fruit and vegetables of various kinds. The date groves extend from half a mile to 2 miles from the river 20 bank, but beyond them all is desert or swamp. In places the date groves along the banks are interrupted by tracts of sandy uncultivated land, though it is probably as fertile as the remainder. Excellent duck and snipe shooting may be had along the banks of the river, especially at Fao and above Basra; partridges also are plentiful, Z5 and bustard are found in the desert round Basra. The close season for game is from 1st June to 1st October, but sand grouse may be shot at any time of the year. On the falling tide, the water in the river is fresh, even at tao, except in the autumn when the river is low and it is then slightly 30 brackish; at about 10 miles above Fao the water is at all times fresh. Shoals and banks in the approach.— Within a distance of about 40 miles of the mouth of the Shatt al Arab, the depths are very uneven and afford little guide to navigation. Banks, over 35 which the depths are less than 10 fathoms (18^3), lie m north westerly and opposite directions with deep channels between them. Shoal patches, over which the depths are between 4 and 5 fathoms (7 m 3 and 9 m l), lie within 23 miles south-eastward and south- south -eastward and 17 miles southward of Bu Sif. Depths less &lt;*0 than 5 fathoms (9 m l) will be found within 16 miles south-eastward of Ras al Bisha and westward of a line drawn south-south-eastward from that point as far as Abu Jezza flat, page 234 A shoal of small extent, over which there is a depth of 3 fathoms (5^5), lies about 15 miles southward of Bu Sif. _ _ 45 Palinurus shoal, over which the least depth is 3 fathoms (5 5), lies between 20 and 23 miles south -eastward of Ras al Bisha. Detached shoals, over which the depths are from 4| to 5 fathoms (8 m 7 to 9 m l), lie about 6^ miles eastward to east -north-eastward of Palinurus shoal. . u ^ i« -i ^ 50 Depths of 5| fathoms (10 m 5) will be found about 16 miles south- south-eastward and between 4 and 6 miles southward of Palmurus shoal; a depth of 5J fathoms (9 m 6) will also be found about 15 miles southward of that shoal.

Bars.—Depths. —Marakat Abadan and Marakat 'Abdullah are two large banks that dry in patches and extend in a south easterly direction for about 7 miles from the southern extremity of Abadan island and from Ras al Bisha {Lat. 29° 55' N 25 Long. 48° 33' E.), respectively. The seaward ends of these banks are joined^ by an outer bar, over which the depths are less than 3 fathoms (5 m 5) and of which the south-eastern extremity lies about 12^ miles south-eastward of Ras al Bisha. An inner bar obstructs the river east-north-eastward of Ras al Bisha. 30 There are two channels across the outer bar, namely Khor al Rooka and the Western channel. Khor al Rooka is dredged (1932) to a depth of 21 feet 6 inches (b 5). Western channel had, in November, 1931, a depth in it of 7 1 35 feet (2 m 3). * The depths in both channels are liable to change; but are main- tamed by dredging. The inner bar reaeh is dredged (1931) to a least depth in the inCheS (6m8) ■ WllenCe t0 Fa0 the ^ aSt de P th Off Fao there are depths of 5 fathoms (9 m l).

With the exception of H.M. ships, those of the Government of 5 'Iraq, and sailing craft, pilotage is compulsory for all vessels entering, leaving, or navigating the Shatt al 'Arab. Pilotage in the river outside the harbour limits of Abadan and Basra is conducted by river pilots, and within those limits by harbour masters, except in the case of a vessel proceeding through either harbour without 10 stopping when the river pilot will conduct the vessel through the harbour. Owing to the alterations that are continually taking place, it is essential that H.M, ships should obtain the latest information concerning the available depths in the channels and the traffic and 15 other regulations in force from the pilot vessel before attempting to enter. The exemption from pilotage granted to H.M. ships does not apply to movements within harbour limits ordinarily conducted by harbour masters. Under no circumstances are vessels under sail permitted to navigate Kh5r al Rooka. 20 A steam pilot vessel, painted white with a yellow funnel and two masts, is stationed off the entrance of Western channel about 14 miles south-eastward of Ras al Bisha. Vessels approaching her from seaward should hoist their number and then their draught in feet and inches, and a pilot will be sent off. In the event of the 25 pilot vessel being temporarily off her station, the vessel requiring the pilot should anchor there and communicate with the Port Officer, Basra, through Basra W/T station. Anchorage off the outer bar is prohibited within the area indicated by pecked lines on charts 3842 and 1235. 30 In order that vessels proceeding in opposite directions shall not meet in Khor al Rooka, permission to enter must first be obtained, through the pilot vessel, from the officer in charge of the control vessel. No vessel may overtake or pass another vessel proceeding in the same direction in any of the dredged channels, nor in the 35 river between North house, see page 261, and Ma 'awiya spit light-buoy, see page 264. The control vessel [Lat. 29° 55' N., Long. 48° 39' E.) is a steam vessel, with two masts and one funnel, painted black, with the word 'Control' on her sides in white letters; she is moored on 40 the north-eastern side of the channel about If miles north-westward of the junction of the inner ends of Khor al Rooka and Western channel. See view facing page 256. The vessel exhibits both tidal and traffic signals by day and at night, except that, when the channel is closed the exhibition of tidal signals is discontinued 45 and the vessel then carries the lights prescribed for a vessel at anchor. Any signals exhibited by the control vessel must be instantly obeyed. A fog signal is occasionally made from the control vessel. When the dredger is working in Khor al Rooka, a vessel entering 50 from seaward must make the signal prescribed on page 258, and be guided by the reply. Vessels employed in surveying exhibit a red cone, and all vessels under way should endeavour to keep clear of them. Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b.256 head of persian gulf [Chap. VIII Charts 3842, 1235.

At night the control vessel communicates by flashing lamp. Tidal. —Signals indicating the rise of the tide on the bar above chart datum are exhibited by day and at night from a white house erected on piles on the eastern side of the Western channel 10 about 9^ miles south-eastward of Ras al Bisha and also by the control vessel and at Fao. At the white house {Lat. 29° 50' N., Long. 48° 43' E.) the signals are exhibited from a mast, 54 feet (16 m 5) in height, erected on a platform 15 feet (4 m 6) above low water. The semaphore has three 15 moveable arms, the upper of which indicates one fathom (l m 8) and over, the middle feet, and the lowest inches, as shown in the diagram, facing this page. At this station a black ball is hoisted at the mast-head at high water and hauled down as soon as the tide begins to fall. 20 On the control vessel, and at Fao, the tidal semaphores have no fathom arm, but one black square shape is hoisted when the rise is one fathom (l m 8) or over, and two black square shapes, when the rise is 2 fathoms (3 m 7) or over. At night the following signals are exhibited at all three stations, 25 those at the white house being hoisted to a bracket on the southern side of the mast 50 feet (15 m 2) above the platform: One green light indicating a rise of 0 feet or 12 feet (0 or 3 m 7) ; One white light indicating a rise of 1 foot or 7 feet (0 m 3 or 2 m l); One red light indicating a rise of 2 feet or 8 feet (0 m 6 or 2 m 4); 30 Two red lights disposed vertically indicating a rise of 3 feet or 9 feet (0 m 9 or 2 m 7); One red light over one white light indicating a rise of 4 feet or 10 feet (l m 2 or 3 m 0); One white light over one red light indicating a rise of 5 feet 35 or 11 feet (l m 5 or 3 m 4); Two white lights disposed vertically indicating a rise of 6 feet (l m 8). One green light exhibited under any of the above signals, with the exceptions of that indicating 0 feet or 12 feet (0 m 3 or 3 m 7), 40 indicates a rise of 6 inches (0 m l) above the exact foot. When a strong shamal is blowing there is a considerable quantity of sand in the atmosphere, which sometimes makes it difficult to distinguish whether a red light is above or below a white light. Great caution should, therefore, be exercised when any signal is 45 exhibited consisting of both red and white lights. Dredgers. —Whilst engaged in dredging operations, the dredgers will exhibit the following signals:— By day.— {a) Two black balls or shapes in a vertical line, where they 50 can be best seen. (6) A red flag at the yardarm on the side on which the channel is not available for navigation. Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b. 5400 1258 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Charts 3842, 1235. At night.— (a) Three white lights in a triangle, one at the mast-head and one at each yardarm. 5 (b) When necessary, a red light on the side on which the channel is not available for navigation will be shown vertically under the white light at the yard-arm. When a dredger is working in Kh5r al Rooka, inward bound vessels on arriving at Rooka light-vessel, see below, must sound JO a prolonged blast on their whistle or siren and must not enter the channel until the dredger replies with four prolonged blasts on her whistle or four long flashes on an arc lamp, which signals indicate that she is keeping clear of the channel or that, whilst remaining in the channel, vessels may pass her, in which case the i5 signals described above will be exhibited. Khor al Rooka.—Lights.—Buoyage. —This, the main entrance channel of the Shatt al 'Arab, is approached through Khor al Amaya, a comparatively deep and narrow gut running north westward between the western edge of Maidan Ali and the eastern 20 edge of the outer bar. Rooka light-vessel [Lat. 29° 49' N., Long. 48° 48' E.), painted red, with the name 'Rooka' in white letters on her sides, is moored in the approach to Khor al Amaya, about 5 miles south eastward of the entrance of Khor al Rooka, and exhibits a light, 25 at an elevation of 30 feet (9 m l), from a superstructure which is surmounted by a black ball. A black can bell-buoy, surmounted by a staff and globe, is established off the eastern edge of the outer bar about 2f miles south -south-eastward of the entrance of Khor al Rooka. 30 Khor al Amaya light-buoy, painted in red and white vertical stripes, and exhibiting a white flashing light every ten seconds, is moored on the prolongation of the centre line of Khor al Rooka, about 8 cables from the entrance of the dredged channel. This light-buoy marks the south-western edge of Maidan Ali and the 35 eastern limit of the deep water in Kh5r al Amaya. A can buoy, painted in black and white horizontal bands, with a black topmark consisting of a cone above a square shape, is moored on the prolongation of the centre line of the dredged channel about one mile eastward of Kh5r al Amaya light-buoy. This 40 buoy is established for dredging purposes only and should not be used for navigation. The centre line of Khor al Rooka is indicated by the alignment of three beacons erected on Marakat 'Abdullah, the front and rear ones exhibiting lights. When in line these beacons bear 284| 0 . 45 The front light-beacon consists of a pile beacon, painted black and exhibiting a light at an elevation of 18 feet (5 m 5); it is situated about half a mile westward of the inner end of Kh5r al Rooka. The middle beacon, 30 feet (9 m l) in height, is painted in black 50 and white horizontal bands and is surmounted by a square day- mark; it is erected about half a mile westward of the front light- beacon. The rear light-beacon, situated on Marakat 'Abdullah, about Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b.5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 Chap. VIII.] SHATT AL 'ARAB 259 Charts 3842, 1235. 1^ miles westward of the front light-beacon, is painted black and carries a triangular daymark. The light is exhibited at an elevation of 55 feet (16 m 8). [Lat. 29° 54' N., Long. 48° 38' E.) The sides of Khor al Rooka are marked by light-beacons and light-buoys. Those on the northern side of the channel exhibit white flashing lights; those on the southern side, red flashing lights. A tide gauge has been established on the southern side of Khor al Rooka, near its entrance from seaward. Tidal streams. —In the vicinity of the Shatt al 'Arab light- vessel, the flood stream at springs attains a maximum velocity of from half a knot to 1^ knots, that of the ebb stream being from 1|- to 2| knots. In Khor al Amaya, the tidal streams attain a rate of from one to 2 knots and continue to run for about 45 minutes at spring tides, and 25 minutes at neaps, after high and low water, respectively. The duration of slack water is about 20 minutes. The in-going tidal stream sets in a north-westerly direction. In Khor al Rooka, the streams set fairly through the channel, except at spring tides, when at either end there is a strong northerly set on the in-going stream, and a strong southerly set on the out going stream; at neap tides these cross-currents are inappreciable. The maximum rate of the flood stream, which at springs is from 1J to 2 knots and at neaps from one to knots, occurs at about half-tide. The maximum rate of the ebb stream is from 3 to 3 J knots at springs, and from 2 to knots at neaps. At spring tides, the flood stream continues to flow for about 40 minutes after the time of high water; at neaps it is irregular, but usually continues for about one hour after high water. The ebb stream continues for about 30 minutes after low water at springs, and for about one hour after low water at neaps. H.M.S. Triad reports that the observed direction of the surface stream is not a reliable guide, for, in June, 1931, when anchored below the control vessel, she swung to the flood, about 2 hours after the time of low water, whilst a 2-knot ebb stream continued to run past her. Caution is, therefore, necessary, as, if when turning into Kh5r al Rooka allowance is made for an observed ebb stream, it may be that the sub-surface flood stream is already making, which might easily put a vessel on to the bank. For remarks on the tides, see page 261. Western channel.—Buoyage. —This channel leads across the outer bar close eastward of Marakat 'Abdullah and the shoal water extending southward from that bank. It is liable to change and the light-buoys marking it are shifted as may be necessary, and cannot, therefore, be relied upon. Outer Fairway buoy, situated at the entrance of the Western channel, about 12 miles south-eastward of Ras al Bisha, is a light-buoy painted in black and white horizontal bands and exhibiting a white flashing light every ten seconds. Between the Outer Fairway buoy and the junction of the Western channel and Kh5r al Rooka, the channel is marked by single light- buoys about 2 miles apart. Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b.260 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Charts 3842, 3843. Inner bar reach.—Lights.—Buoyage. —This reach extends, for a distance of about 5 miles, from the junction of Khor al Rooka and Western channel to a position north-eastward of Ras al Bisha. 5 The centre line of the dredged channel through the reach is indicated by the alignment of two light-beacons erected, near its inner end, on the northern side of the river. The front light-beacon {Lat. 29° 57' N., Long. 48° 34' E.), situated about If miles north-north-eastward of Ras al Bisha, is 10 a black iron structure with a white inverted triangle as daymark and exhibits a light at an elevation of 20 feet (6 m l). The rear light-beacon, situated about 3j cables north-westward of the front light-beacon, is a black iron structure with a black triangular daymark and exhibits a light at an elevation of 50 15 feet {15 m 2). These light-beacons when in line bear 304°. In addition to the leading marks, the channel is marked as necessary by light-buoys. Two sets of beacons for the use of the dredgers have been erected 20 on the outer bar southward of Khor al Rooka; each set consists of three beacons lying in north-easterly and opposite directions one from another and the centre beacon of each set is situated on the prolongation of the centre line of Inner bar reach; the sets are, respectively, about If and 2f miles south-eastward of the junction 25 oi Khor al Rooka and Western channel. Chart 3843. Fao reach.—Lights.—Beacons. —This reach extends from the inner bar to Fao, a distance of about 6 miles. The centre line of the dredged channel is indicated by the 30 alignment of two light-beacons at Fao, which are duplicated seaward, for the benefit of vessels proceeding down the river, by three beacons erected on Marakat Abadan, the front and middle ones of which exhibit lights. The front leading-light at Fao is exhibited, at an elevation of 35 30 feet (9 m l), from a black framework mast erected on the southern bank of the river about half a mile south-eastward of Fao. The rear leading-light at Fao is exhibited, at an elevation of 75 feet (22 m 9), from a black framework mast erected about three- quarters of a mile north-westward of the front light-mast. 40 The front leading-light on Marakat Abadan is exhibited, at an elevation of 17 feet (5 m 2), from a black framework mast carrying a white disc under the lantern, erected on the northern side of Inner bar reach, about 3 miles east-north-eastward of Ras al Bisha. The rear leading-light on Marakat Abadan is exhibited, at an 45 elevation of 47 feet (14 m 3), from the middle one of the three beacons; it is a black framework mast carrying a white triangular shape under the lantern and is erected about one mile south-eastward of the front light-mast. The rear beacon, which is unlighted, 30 feet (9 m l) in height, 50 and painted black, is erected about 2| miles south-eastward of the rear light-mast. The above sets of leading-lights and the beacon when in line bear, respectively, 287^° and 107| o . An illuminated tide gauge, on which the rise of the tide is Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.K$. Chap. VIII.] SHATT AL 'ARAB 261 Chart 3843. indicated by white figures on a black background, is established, for the use of outward bound vessels, on the southern side of Fao reach about 8^ cables south-westward of the Inner bar reach rear leading-light. 5 Two white iron framework beacons, the front beacon 25 feet (7 m 6) in height and carrying a black board with the legend ' 'Dredged Channel limit' in white letters theron, and having a triangular topmark, and the rear, 30 feet (9 m l) in height and having a St. George's Cross as topmark, are erected on the southern bank of the river 10 about 2|- miles below Fao. When in line they bear 197° and indicate the inner end of the dredged channel in Fao reach. Fao. —Fao {Lat. 30° 58' N., Long. 48° 29' E.) is situated on the south-western bank of the river and is the repair and stores depot for the dredgers; it is also the buoyage depot for the port 15 of Basra and the Persian gulf lights. A wooden jetty, 140 feet (42 m 7) long, with a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9) at its head, has been erected at Fao. Black notice-boards with the word 'Slow' in white letters, are set up on the south-western bank of the river about half a mile 20 above and below Fao; between them vessels are to proceed at slow speed. Traffic and tidal signals, see page 256, are exhibited from a mast, 100 feet (30 m 5) in height, painted white and fitted with yards, which has been erected close south-eastward of the Customs buildings 25 at Fao. There is a hospital at Fao, with 20 beds. Charts 3842, 3843, 1235. Tides. —'Tidal predictions for the Shatt al 'Arab are given in the Admiralty Tide Tables, Part I; tidal differences for Basra 50 will be found in Part II. The tides are affected by a large diurnal inequality in both times and heights, varying with the declination of the moon. Near the equinoxes it is more pronounced at neaps than at springs, and near the solstices the reverse is the case. 35 Seasonal variations in the level of the river are small at the outer bar, less than ±0.5 feet (0 m l); but at Basra they are considerable, +2.5 feet (0 m 7) in June, and —1.5 feet (0 m 4) in October; these affect high and low water equally. In the river, the highest levels occur in May, June, and July, when the Shatt al 'Arab is discharging 40 the combined flood-waters of the Euphrates and Tigris. The lowest levels occur in October and November. Both times and heights of the tide are very much affected by the prevailing wind. A heavy kaus will raise the level of the river by 2 or 3 feet (0 m 6 or 0 m 9), causing both a higher high water and 45 a higher low water; it will also accelerate the time of high water. On the other hand, a strong shamal will lower the level of the river, so that at low water the tide may fall below the zero of the tide gauge, and it will retard the time of high water. Chart 3843. 50 Kasba reach.—Lights.—Beacons.—Anchorage. —This reach extends from a bend in the river at Kasba point {Lat. 30° 00' N., Long. 48° 28' E.), on the opposite bank and about 2 miles above Fao, to North House, a square mud house without dome or minarets Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.262 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 3843. used as a mosque and situated on the eastern bank of the river about SJ miles above Kasba point. On the same bank of the river and about 1J miles southward of North House, is a conspicuous square 5 fort. In this reach the channel skirts the eastern bank of the river. The centre line of the channel is indicated by the alignment of two leading lights. The front light is exhibited, at an elevation of 29 feet (8 m 8), from an iron structure, painted white, with a triangular daymark, 10 erected on the south-western side of the river south-westward of Kasba point. {Lat. 30° 00' NLong. 48° 27' E.) The rear light is exhibited, at an elevation of 48 feet (14 m 6), from an iron structure, painted white, with a St. Andrew's cross as daymark; it is situated about 1-1 cables southward of the front 15 light-structure. These lights or beacons in line astern, bearing about 178°, lead through the centre of the deep water channel as far as the square fort. At about 8 'cables above the front light-structure in Kasba reach 20 and on the same side of the river is the first pair of four sets of anchoring beacons erected for the guidance of vessels of deep draught compelled to anchor to await a suitable opportunity for crossing the bar. The beacons consist in each case of angle-iron structures and exhibit white fixed lights; the front beacons carry a triangular 25 daymark at an elevation of 20 feet (6 m l), and the rear beacons a St. George's cross at an elevation of 32 feet (9 m 8). These pairs of beacons are lettered consecutively from seaward 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D', the letters being in v/hite on a black background at the base of the beacons. The berths indicated by the beacons 30 are about 1,350 feet (411 m 5) apart. Kasba beacon is a black and white surveying beacon, 50 feet (15 m 2) high, erected between 'B' and 'C' anchorage beacons. North House light.—Light-buoy. —A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 45 feet (13 m 7), from a white steel mast with black 35 bands, erected close westward of North House. A black can light-buoy, exhibiting a red flashing light every five seconds, is established about 2 cables westward of North House light-structure off the shoal water on the western side of the river. After passing the square fort in Kasba reach, vessels should steer 40 to pass midway between the light-structure at North House and the light-buoy. Vessels of deep draught should avoid arriving off North House at low water, for the depth in the channel is there not more than 25| feet (7^8). 45 North House to Chellabi point.—Light.—Beacons. —Above North House, the channel closes the western bank of the river. An illuminated tide gauge has been erected on the south-western bank of the river about 2^ miles above North House. Two notice-boards carrying the letters 'E' and 'F' have been 5^ erected about one quarter of a mile, respectively, above and below the tide gauge to indicate anchorage berths for deeply laden vessels awaiting the tide to cross the bar at North House. A light is exhibited, at an elevation of 45 feet (13 m 7), from a conspicuous white steel mast with black bands, erected on the western Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.264 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 3843. bank of the river opposite Chellabi point about one quarter of a mile north-eastward of the ruins of a brick kiln, which latter is about 21 miles north-westward of the illuminated tide gauge. 5 Chellabi point to Kabda point. —This reach trends north eastward and the channel is on the south-eastern side of the river. Khasal Abad is a Persian village with a number of large mud and sandstone buildings on the south-eastern bank of the river, about miles above Chellabi point. At Khasal Abad there is 10 a stone pier for dhows. Muzulew is another Persian village, about one mile above Khasal Abad. Chart 3844. Kabda reach.—Lights.—Light -buoy .—This reach trends north- i5 westward from Kabda point {Lat. 30° 10' N., Long. 48° 25' E.) for a distance of about 12 miles to A1 Khast or Deep Water point. For the first 9 miles the channel follows the south-western bank of the river, the opposite bank being bordered by a chain of islands and flats of which Ma 'awiya and Dawasir islands are the largest. 20 A can light-buoy, painted in red and white vertical stripes and exhibiting a white flashing light, is moored on the north-eastern side of the channel abreast the southern extremity of a spit which extends in that direction from Ma 'awiya island. The centre line of the channel abreast and above Dawasir island 25 is indicated by the alignment of two light-beacons. The front light is exhibited, at an elevation of 25 feet (7 m 6), from an iron pillar painted in black and white bands and erected on the south-western bank of the river south-south-westward of the northern end of Ma 'awiya island. 30 The rear light is exhibited, at an elevation of 80 feet (24 m 4), from an iron pillar painted in black and white bands and carrying a triangular daymark, situated about 4 cables south-eastward of the front light-beacon. These light-beacons when in line astern bear 141°. 35 r) ■^ )a ^ an . reac h • Lights.—Caution .—The refineries of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company are situated at Abadan, on the north-eastern side of the river opposite A1 Khast. The oil is brought by pipe line from the oil-fields at Masjid-es-Suleiman, situated about 140 miles north-north-eastward. There are many large buildings at 40 the refinery and the tall chimneys there are conspicuous. The refinery treats some 5,000,000 tons of crude oil per annum. The whole of Abadan reach is a danger zone, and special regulations are in force therein; see Port Regulations and Bye-Laws. ^ Abadan and Bawarda, situated about one mile south-eastward, 45 there are in all 14 jetties, alongside the majority of which ocean going vessels may be berthed. Lights are exhibited from Nos 1 4, and 5 jetties. Anchorage is prohibited in Abadan reach within the limits of the harbour indicated by the 'Slow'' notice-boards. These slow 60 notice-boards are erected on both sides of the river just below awarda that on the right bank being a short distance above the village of beeba, and also on both banks of the river near A1 Khast point, that on the right bank being a short distance above the village Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.leroli station. Chap. VIII.] SHATT AL 'ARAB 265 Chart 3844. of Zaudiyah, at which place there is an 'Iraqi Police and Customs a.tion. There are a number of mooring-buoys on the south-western side of the river between Abadan and Bawarda. A European Harbour 5 Master boards vessels on arrival and berths them as necessary. All sea-going vessels, whether awaiting a berth or loaded must be moored below the lowest jetty, at Bawarda, and no vessel bound for Abadan or Bawarda may ascend the river above that point until boarded by the Harbour Master. 10 The offices of the port are on board a hulk moored off Bawarda. A floating dock, from either end of which lights are exhibited, is moored on the south-western side of the river abreast No. 7 jetty; for details, see page 280. Vessels in Abadan reach should on no account make use of their 15 sirens, except in a case of emergency, as the 'fire alarm' at Abadan and Bawarda is given by siren. The framework mast of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's W/T station is situated about 7 cables northward of No. 1 jetty. At Abadan, the flood tidal stream attains a rate of 1^ knots, and 20 the ebb stream 3 knots. For steamship communications, see page 28. Great Britain is represented by a Vice-Consul. Supplies. —Ship's provisions are not usually obtainable at Abadan, though fresh meat, but of poor quality, can be had at a 25 few days' notice. Water, for drinking or boilers, in any quantity, can be obtained from the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. Fuel oil is supplied at the jetties or by lighter. Chart 3845. 30 A1 Khast reach— After passing A1 Khast point, the main channel of the river takes a wide sweep south-westward, westward, and then north-north-westward round Muhalla island. Off A1 Khast point {Lat. 30° 20' N., Long. 48° 16' E.), the deep water channel is on the northern side of the river; it then crosses 55 to the southern side, southward of Muhalla island, and then skirts the western side of that island, passing eastward of Gatah island, Abu Dood island, and the banks extending northward from the latter. There is a tide gauge on the western side of the channel abreast 40 Abu Dood island. The channel north-eastward and northward of Muhalla island is only available to boats. With a strong ebb tidal stream, an eddy that must be guarded against is formed in the southernmost part of the curve in A1 Khast 45 reach, southward of Muhalla island. Mohammerah bar—Buoyage.— This bar extends from just above Harthah point, situated on the eastern side of the river im mediately northward of the north-western end of Muhalla island, to a position just below the junction of Hafar channel with the 50 main river. The track across the bar varies considerably, especially at the beginning of the flood season, March or April, when very rapid Charts 1235, 1265, 28371), 748b. 54OO266 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 3845. alterations in the channel may be expected. As these alterations prevent the establishment of permanent leading marks, light-buoys, which are moved as necessary, are employed to mark the channel. 5 At all times when the bar is in an unsettled condition a surveying vessel is stationed there to check the depths, and when necessary a special pilot boards inward bound vessels in the vicinity of Harthah point to conduct them across the bar. Numerous surveying marks are maintained on either bank of 10 the river. Dabba spit black can buoy marks the extremity of the spit, on the western side of the bar, extending south-eastward from the south-eastern end of Dabba island, see page 267, in a position about one mile below the mouth of Hafar channel. Except in the flood season, the least depth over Mohammerah bar is usually about 19 feet (5 m 8), though in October, 1930, it was only 17| feet (5 m 3). Vessels are prohibited from anchoring abreast the mouth of Hafar channel, between the pecked lines shown on chart 3485. Mohammerah. —Hafar channel, more usually known as the 20 Karun, connects the Shatt al 'Arab with that river, see page 276, and is about 2 cables wide and 2 miles in length; the depths in the channel vary from about 2^ to 4 fathoms (4 in 6 to 7 m 3). There is a conspicuous statue of H.I.M. Riza Khan, the Shah of Persia, on the southern side of the entrance of Hafar channel. 25 Mohammerah, one of the principal ports in Persia, is situated on the northern side and about half a mile within the entrance of Hafar channel. The town is the seat of government of the Governor of Mohammerah. [Lat. 30° 26' N., Long. 48° 10' E.) The Anglo-Persian Oil Company have offices at Mohammerah; 30 there also is a Customs-house with covered accommodation for cargo, and a bazaar. Both the Persian and Arabic languages are spoken. The town is said to be comparatively cool and healthy. There is a wharf at the entrance of Hafar channel on its north-western side formed by the retaining wall of the Customs-house compound, 35 and on its south-eastern side is a jetty near which are some disused barracks and a Persian quarantine station. Boats can go alongside the landing jetty southward of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's premises at any state of the tide, and lighters lie alongside the Customs-house wharf. 40 Vessels whose draught permits them to do so may lie off the town close to the bank, but there is no room to swing, and ocean-going vessels usually anchor in the Shatt al 'Arab north-westward of the entrance of Hafar channel, cargo being worked by means of lighters. There is a tide gauge on the north-eastern side of Dabba 45 island, westward of the entrance of Hafar channel. Anchorage in Hafar channel is prohibited in the area indicated by pecked lines on chart 3845, abreast the Anglo-Persian Oil Company's premises, owing to the existence of telegraph and power cables therein. 50 Great Britain is represented by a Vice-Consul. There are both Indian and Persian post offices at Mohammerah, and also a telegraph office. River launches run between Mohammerah and Basra. For steamship communications, see page 28.

For meteorological tables, see page 288. Supplies. —Meat is fairly plentiful, but the supply of vegetables 5 varies; no bread is obtainable. The water in Hafar channel is purer and cooler than that of the Shatt al 'Arab; in summer a difference in temperature of 16° F. has been observed. Charts 3845, 3846. 10 Mohammerah to Basra.—Light -buoy. —^Between Mohammerah bar and Basra {Lat. 30° 31' N., Long. 47° 50' E.) are several islands. On the southern side of the main channel are Dabba, Omarassas, Zain, and Industry islands, and on the northern side are Sham Shamiah, At Tuwaila, and Ajairawiya islands. 15 The channel follows the northern bank of the river to the western end of Dabba island, where it passes through Satan's Gap, between that island and Sham Shamiah island. It then skirts the southern sides of Sham Shamiah and At Tuwaila islands until about 2 miles above the western end of Industry island, whence it follows the 20 southern bank of the river. The palace of the late Sheikh and Governor of Mohammerah is situated on the northern bank of the river about 3 miles above the entrance of Hafar channel, and at about one quarter of a mile farther upstream is the mouth of Failiyeh creek. White pillars marking 25 the boundary between 'Iraqi and Persian territory are erected on either side of the mouth of Failiyeh creek, whence the boundary trends northward so that above the creek both banks of the Shatt al 'Arab are in 'Iraqi territory. Satan's Gap is a narrow pass and the channel through it is marked 30 on its northern side by a light-buoy, painted in red and white vertical stripes and exhibiting a white flashing light; on the southern side of the channel is a green can buoy. A sunken wreck, over which there is a depth of 30 feet (9 m l), lies in the middle of Satan's Gap, and causes a large deflection of 35 the magnetic compass when a vessel is passing over it; when passing through the Gap the vessel should, therefore, be steered by the land or conned until such time as the compass becomes steady. Should vessels bound in opposite directions sight each other 40 when approaching Satan's Gap, the vessel stemming the current should reduce speed or stop until the other vessel has passed clear. Two white mooring buoys have been established off the village of Sanger for the use of ocean-going steamers; they are situated on the northern side of the channel about 6^ miles below Basra. 45 Chart 3846. Basra.— The port of 'Iraq is Basra, situated on the south western side of the Shatt al 'Arab in Basra reach, which latter trends north -north-westward from the north-western end of Ajairawiya island. 50 Basra city is a walled town, some 2 miles up Ashar creek, 'containing the principal business and native quarters and the majority of the bazaars; the mouth of the creek is in the western bank of the river, about one mile above the north-western end of Charts 1235, 1265, 2837h, 748b.268 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 3846. Ajairawiya island. Outside the walls of the city are extensive suburbs, separated by gardens and date groves, which line both sides of the creek to its mouth; the creek is spanned by several 5 bridges. Ashar contains the principal mercantile and government offices, and is also the chief residential quarter; it is situated on the river front on both sides of the mouth of Ashar creek. There are bazaars and a native quarter on the northern side of the creek near its 10 mouth. Ma'qil, the native name of which is A1 Kut al Faranji, is the shipping centre of Basra. It is situated on the same side of the river as Basra, and about 3 miles above the mouth of Ashar creek. At Ma'qil are the wharves to which all ocean-going vessels proceed 15 to discharge or take in cargo. Great Britain is represented by a Consul. The Consulate is situated in Ashar, about 1-| cables below the mouth of Ashar creek. The Customs-house is situated on the northern side of the mouth of Ashar creek. [Lat. 30° 31' N., Long. 47° 51' E.) 20 The port signal station is at Jubailah, at the lower end of Ma'qil, about 2 miles above the mouth of Ashar creek. The Port Directorate headquarters are in Ma'qil, in rear of No. 5 wharf. The exports consist chiefly of dates, grain (pulse and flour), wool 25 (raw), hides and skins, cotton piece goods, etc. The imports consist chiefly of cotton piece goods, sugar, machinery, silk piece goods, oils, tea, etc. During the year 1929-30, 820 vessels of an aggregate gross registered tonnage of 4,386,967 tons, entered the Shatt al 'Arab; 30 of these 177 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 799,189 tons entered Basra, and 643 vessels of an aggregate tonnage of 3,587,778 tons entered Abadan. Climate and health. —The prevalent north-westerly wind of summer is dry and hot. July, August, and September are intensely 35 hot; December and January are cold, often with frost; the rest of the year resembles the spring and summer of southern Europe. In the autumn months the nights are usually cool, and it does not get hot until about 1000, but the afternoons are intensely hot. During June, when the sun rises about 0500, it is intensely hot by &lt;0 0800, and cool nights are the exception. The climate of Basra is considerably drier and more healthy than that of the Persian gulf, and, although the temperature attains a higher degree, it is less oppressive. See also Meteorological tables page 289. 45 Malaria, sand-fly fever, and heat-stroke are the most general forms of illness. Malaria occurs at all times, especially at the commencement of the hot weather. Sand-fly fever occurs in spring and early autumn. Plague occurs at Basra in the cold weather, and cholera cases usually in the hot weather. 50 Regulations.—Quarantine— Special regulations are in force in the port of Basra. Masters of vessels should obtain a copy of the Bye-Laws on arrival. Every vessel arriving at the port of Basra, except H.M. ships, shall be considered as in quarantine until the Port Health Officer Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.Chap. VIIL] basra 269 Chart 3846. has boarded her and granted pratique; and no person is to be allowed to board or leave the vessel, except the pilot and the harbour master, until such time as pratique has been granted. Mail steamers are inspected on arrival; other vessels between sunrise and 5 sunset only. Infected or suspected vessels must anchor below Khora creek, opposite the north-western end of Ajairawiya island, for medical inspection. There is a civil hospital at Basra; also an isolation hospital and a nursing home. 10 For Deratisation facilities, see page 30. Wharves. — Mooring -buoys. — Anchorage. — There are 12 wharves at Ma'qil {Lat. 30° 33' N., Long. 47° 48' E.) ] 'A' wharf is the farthest up-stream, the remainder are numbered consecutively from upstream downwards, and are connected to the railway 15 system. Nos. 1 to 6 can accommodate large vessels; they are fitted with 11 electric gantry cranes, and are provided with large warehouses; there are depths of 25 feet (7 m 6) alongside. There are no bollards on these wharves, but they are provided with wire eyes to which the vessel's hawsers can be attached. Nos. 7 to 11 20 berths are used by the British Royal Air Force, and have depths alongside of from' 10 to 15 feet (3 m 0 to 4 m 6). In addition there are 4 temporary berths for ocean-going vessels, and special wharves reserved for the handling of petrol, kerosene, and fuel oil. There are several mooring-buoys in the river; the one abreast 25 the British Consulate is reserved for the use of H.M. ships. There are also numerous moorings for the port and river craft. A vessl arriving at Basra bound for the wharves will be boarded by a Harbour Master off Jubailah creek; those bound for a buoy or mooring in the stream will be boarded off Seraji creek. 30 All vessels of more than 200 tons gross measurement, when anchoring, are required to moor with two bower anchors and 60 fathoms ('l09 in 7) of chain cable on each. The anchors are laid up and down the river. _ , , .. Anchorage is prohibited in the area indicated by pecked lines 35 on chart 3846, about one mile above the mouth of Ashar creek. Repairs .—Supplies .—There is a complete engineer s yard and store depot at Ma'qil. _ . i r The port is equipped with floating sheerlegs capable of lifting a weight of 80 tons; in addition there is a 30-ton floating crane. 40 There is a patent slip at Ashar. . . . ,. Supplies of every description Ccin be obtained, at Basra, including fresh meat, vegetables, and bread; in summer, ice is usually to be had The river water should be boiled and chlorinated before drinking, but chlorinated or dechlorinated water can be supplied 45 in quantities up to 1,000 tons, on 2 days notice being given. It is brought off in 100-ton lighters, of which there are six. Stocks of coal are maintained. Arrangements for coaling should be made with the Port Authorities, at least 48 hours' notice being given. Coaling is a slow operation. The coal is brought off in 50 lighters, or vessels may coal alongside at Ma qil, m a depth of 25 feet {7 m 6). Fuel oil can be obtained alongside the wharves, or, in lighters, from Abadan. Charts 1235, 1265, 2837b, 748b.270 HEAD OF PERSIAN GULF [Chap. VIII. Chart 3846. . ^ x Communications. —There is a, weekly steamship service to and from Bombay, and several companies run monthly services which give direct communication with London, Marseilles and other 5 European ports j there are sailings also for the Far East, as well as for other ports in the Persian gulf, see page 28. Basra is in connection by rail with Baghdad. There is telegraphic communication with all parts of the world. Mails are despatched by sea, and also by overland route or, by air, via Baghdad. For aircraft communications, see page 29. For W/T communications, see page 29. Tidal streams. —The velocity of the tidal streams at Basra varies with the seasons of the year. During the flood season, i5 February to June, the ebb stream, accelerated by the freshets due to the melting of the snow in the mountains, may attain a rate of 4 knots. During the dry season, September zo December, the rate of the ebb stream varies between 2 and 3 knots, and that of the flood stream from one to 2 knots. 20 Observations made by H.M. Ships Espiegle, Cyclamen, and Folkestone, between the years 1922 and 1931, show that the flood tidal stream at Basra makes about 3h 23m before the time of high water there or about Ih 07m after the time of high water at the bar of the Shatt al 'Arab, and that the ebb tidal stream begins about 25 Ih 40m after the time of high water at Basra or about 6h 10m after the time of high water at the bar of the Shatt al 'Arab. These times are subject, however, to seasonal and other variations, that of the commencement of the flood tidal stream preceding the lower high water being considerable and amounting to as much 30 as hours on either side of the average. Slack water would appear to be of short duration. There is a tide gauge at a short distance south-eastward of No. 6 wharf, Ma'qil, and an automatic tide gauge at 'A' wharf. Charts 3846, 1265. 35 Basra to Qurna. —The Shatt al 'Arab is navigable by vessels drawing up to 15 feet (4 m 6) as far as Qurna {Lat. 31° 00' N., Long. 47° 26' E.), situated about 40 miles above Basra, at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Commencing abreast the northernmost wharves at Ma'qil is a 40 spit, which extends south-eastward in the middle of the river from Coal island, the southern of two long islands which occupy the centre of the next reach; the northern island is called North island. The deeper channel is that north-eastward of the islands. Qarmat 'Ali discharges the waters of Hammar lake, see page 45 275, into the Shatt al 'Arab abreast the gap between Coal and North islands; flowing from westward, it is comparatively deep for the last few miles. Telegraph wires are suspended across the mouth of Qarmat 'Ali at a height of about 70 feet (21 m 3). The western bank of the Shatt al 'Arab, both above and below 50 Qarmat 'Ali, is lined with conspicuous brick kilns. The river thence leads northward for about 7 miles. The Katiaban canal flows in on the eastern bank, and is said to connect with the Karun river. The eastern bank of the river from Basra to this point is lined with date groves. Northward of the canal Chart 748b.Chap. VIII.] TIGRIS RIVER 271 Charts 3846, 1265. is an open sandy desert, and the western bank has a thin fringe of date palms, beyond which is also desert that is sometimes flooded. At about 2 miles northward of the canal, the river turns north- westward, with general depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) near its north- 5 eastern bank; near the south-western bank it is shoal for the first 2 miles, after which it is steep-to on that side, with deep water close to a prominent point, above which vessels should keep to the south-western side of the river. Nahr 'Umar is situated in this reach on the south-western bank of the river, about 10 miles above 10 Qarmat 'All. For the next 17 miles there is no difficulty in the navigation. Ash-shafi creek, with five brick kilns at its entrance, is conspicuous on the western bank, about 12| miles above Nahr 'Umar, which bank, northward of this, is open plain. . . 15 For about one mile northward of Ash-shafi creek the river is shallow the depths being about 2 fathoms (3 m 7), but it soon deepens again to 3 and 3^ fathoms (5^5 and 6^4). The river then narrows somewhat, and curves round northward and north-north- eastward, the western bank, which is there thickly planted with 20 date palms, being steep-to with depths of 4 fathoms (7 m 3) close al( Shwaiyib river flows in on the eastern side, v/here the Shatt al 'Arab is narrowest; it is a deep river, which trends off north eastward and northward, with many turns, and with depths of 25 2 or 3 fathoms (3 m 7 or 5 m 5) for the first 12 miles, but it is too narrow for anything larger than a steam launch. After passing the entrance of the Shwaiyib river, the main river curves north-westward, and widens out into a broad reach miles long, most of which however, is shallow, forming the bar of the combined Tigris and 30 Euphrates rivers. The greatest depths are close along the northern shore, the channel being, however, very narrow, with a depth of only feet (2m6) at high water low river. _ After pacsing the bar the river narrows again, and becomes deep, there being depths of 6 fathoms (ll m 0) at the junction of the rivers. 35 Between Basra and Qurna the bottom is everywhere mud. Qurna is a small town, situated on the point formed by the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. In the town is a telegraph office. TIGRIS RIVER.—General remarks .—This great river originates in Turkish territory in two head streams which unite some 70 miles from the northern frontier of 'Iraq. The united stream flows south-south -eastward past Mosul, near which is the site of the ancient city of Nineveh, past Baiji, Samarra, and Baghdad, whence « it trends south -eastward, and past Kut al Imara and Amara to its junction with the Euphrates at Qurna , The total length of the river is some 1,150 miles; its chief tributaries are the Greater and Lesser Zab rivers, flowing from north-eastward into the main river between Mosul and Baiji, and the Dailah river, which, flowing from northward, joins the main stream jus t below B Thertde is felt for about 30 miles above Qurna, but the current272 TIGRIS RIVER [Chap. VIII. Chart 2483. always runs downstream. Masters of river steamers running to Baghdad, etc., report that it is practicable to take vessels of about 10 feet (3 m 0) draught for a distance of about 60 miles above Qurna, 5 and of 9 feet (2 m 7) draught, 90 miles farther. The types of craft plying on the Tigris are Side Paddle tugs, Quarter-wheelers, and Twin Tunnel-screw tugs. In the high river season a draught of 4 feet 6 inches (l m 4) is usual, but in the low river season a draught of 3 feet 3 inches (l m 0) should not be exceeded. 10 In 1838, the s.s. Euphrates, of 3 feet (0 m 9) draught, reached the Great Bund, 28 miles below Mosul, which is about 200 miles in a straight line north-north-westward of Baghdad. The river is narrow, and difficult of navigation, on account of its numerous curves. The depths are from 2 to 4 fathoms (3 m 7 to 25 7 m 3) for the first 10 miles from Qurna, but the current is swift. The river is nowhere wide enough to turn round in. In most cases, when vessels meet, one has to bank in to allow the other to pass. Rises in the river are caused by rain and melting snow. 'Rain- rises' as a rule commence about the middle of November; the 20 first rises invariably fall again very rapidly, a fall of 5 feet {1^5) during a night has often been experienced in the upper reaches, but by the end of December the river is usually full. After the second 'rain-rise' the river continues good during the remainder of the winter months. 25 'Snow-rises' start in early March, and by the end of that month or early in April the river is in full flood; about the middle of April, rises from this cause cease, but a rise may occur owing to late rains. In May, the river commences to fall, and great care must be taken in navigating it, as the channels are not then formed; 30 when the scour of the river has formed the channels, navigation becomes easier. In June, there is good water, but the channels must be carefully adhered to; in July, the channels are apt to be most erratic; in August, the channels begin to form; in September, the river reaches 35 its lowest level, and during this month steamers have made their worst passages; in October, at the first snap of cold or cooler weather, the sandbanks appear to harden and the channels scour out several inches deeper. Navigation in the Tigris varies with each season of the year, 40 and as each year in itself varies, no hard and fast rules can be laid down. In a good or favourable year the 'rain-rises' come regularly, and though the level may at times fall slightly, the river is always gaining. 45 In bad years, the river perhaps falling later, a very high rise amounting to anything up to 12 feet {3 m l) at Baghdad, may come, at any time in December or January; occasionally, however, the river falls almost to its lowest (summer) level. A rise in the river is naturally felt later towards its lower reaches. 50 A rise at Maslu takes some three days to reach Baghdad, and about the same time to travel to Qurna. [Lat. 31° 00' N., Long. 47° 26' E.) Floods occasionally occur. Usually the rise above normal river level is about 2 feet (0 m 6), but 8 feet (2 m 4) has been observed at Baghdad. A very heavy rainfall in January, 1896, caused the rivertf G Chap. VIII.] TIGRIS RIVER 273 ^ Chart 2483. to rise 8 feet (2 m 4) in one night, with the result that the embankments b\v. were broken down, and a sea was formed round Baghdad, about 25 miles in length and some 6 miles wide. The water rose to a 'Jlls, higher level than the city, which is, however, surrounded by a 5 glacis. There was also a great inundation in April, 1894, and [in- another in March, 1923. During low river, occasional groundings are almost impossible to ;lit- avoid, and local pilots are employed. In general, the best water is found on the outside of curves, but 10 this is not invariably the case. As the level of the river falls, the channels often change, so that :: in certain sections local pilots should be engaged. Pilots can usually be got at Basra, 'Amara, 'Ali Gharbi, Kut al Imara, Bughaila, Al 'Aziziya, and Baghdad. The nature of the river bottom between Basra and Baghdad is mud, and no rocks are found between these places. Ships taking the ground can usually haul off by laying out anchors. The tendency of the current is to quickly wash away the mud on the up-stream side of a vessel, and to form a bank on the other, 20 which sometimes rises above the water in three or four hours. During April and May, sudden squalls known as 'guttras' are frequent, often necessitating the furling of awnings, etc.; these squalls are experienced most frequently in the neighbourhood of 'Ali Sharqi and all small craft must make fast while they are 25 blowing. Qurna to 'Amara. —From Qurna to 'Amara {Lat. 31° 4S' N., Long. 47° 15' £.), a distance of 82 miles, the general depth is about 13 feet (4 m 0) at high river and 6 feet (l m 8) at low. Ezra's tomb is situated about 27 miles above Qurna and the 30 river between them is marked by black posts on the light bank and white poles on the left, to denote the course of the river when the banks are covered during floods. The river between Qurna and Ezra's tomb is always good, but there are some bad bends, the worst being at Humaiyan, Saiifah, and the southern bend of Majrum 35 rea ch Oal'a Salih is situated about 26 miles above Ezra's tomb. The section Ghumaiqa Shargi to Abu Ruba is the worst part of The Narrows, see below. In the low river season this reach is extremely difficult,' owing to the narrow and tortuous course of the channel 40 combined with the very strong current. Great care must be taken to avoid grounding on the spits that run out for a considerable distance at the worst bends. From Abu Ruba to Qal a Salih, with the exception of Nufaikh reach, the river is good, though narrow. 'Amara is situated about 29 miles above Qal'a Salih. The 45 channels, mentioned below, deprive the ligris of a large amount of water' which causes the river to narrow below Qal'a Salih to a width of'about 60 or 70 yards (54^9 or 64 m 0), forming that section of the river referred to above as The Narrows, that is to say, the Kahala canal on the left bank of the river at 'Amara; the Majar 50 al Kabir canal, about 2 miles above Aba Sidra, on the right bank; and the Michrivah canal, now partly dammed, about one mile above Qal'a Salih, on the left bank. The worst reach in the Qal'a Salih to 'Amara section is the Muzaniya reach, about 4 miles274 TIGRIS RIVER [Chap. VIII. Chart 2483. above Qal'a Salih; with the exception of this reach the river is generally good throughout the year. Since 1928, the Narrows have become more difficult to navigate owing to the action of the 5 Majar Regulator, situated about half-way between Qal'a Salih and 'Amara. This regulator, when opened, admits water to the Majar and causes the level in the Narrows to drop from 10 to 18 inches {254 mm to 457 mm ); it has also caused a considerable amount of silt to be deposited in this section of the river. 10 'Amara, on the eastern bank of the river, contains about 1,500 houses, the population consisting of settled Arabs, with some Persians and Sabians. Wheat and barley are exported, and there is usually a small supply of coal. 'Amara to Baghdad. —Navigation presents no difficulty to 15 vessels of suitable draught in that section of the river between 'Amara and Kut al Imara. The width, generally, is about 1| cables, with a depth of 26 feet (7 m 9) at high river, and 6 feet (l m 6) at low. 'Ali Gharbi is situated about 77 miles above 'Amara. Between 20 'Amara and Saiyid 'Ali canal good water is found all the year round. From the canal to Ali Gharbi there is good water nearly all the year round, but soundings should be taken continuously in this section. Shaikh Sa'ad is situated about 30 miles above 'Ali Gharbi. During the low river season there are three bad reaches in this 25 section, viz., Said Abbas, Mandaliya, and Abu ad Dud. The channels in these reaches are very liable to change. As vessels approaching the sharp bend at the bottom of Mandaliya reach are unable to see one another, caution should be exercised. Kut Camp is situated about 36 miles above Shaikh Sa'ad and the 30 river between them is good for navigation all the year round; with care no difficulties should be experienced. At Kut al Imara, the Hai branch, the ancient Tigris, leaves the right bank of the river. From Kut al Imara to Baghdad, a distance of 192 miles, is the 35 most difficult part of the river, and there are many shoals. The width of the river, generally, is from 300 to 400 yards (274 m 3 to 365 in 8), with a depth of 26 feet (7 ni 9) at high, and 6 feet (l m 8) at low river. It is essential to carry a pilot with local knowledge. Baghdad. —This famous city, situated about 460 miles above 40 Basra, is built on both sides of the Tigris. Two boat bridges cross the river at Baghdad. The population is about 140,000, and supplies are plentiful. Baghdad {Lat. 33° 15' N., Long. 44° 28' E.) is connected by railway to Basra, the line continuing northward, past Samarra 45 to Baiji; another line runs from the opposite side of the river at Baghdad to Kirkuk, situated some 145 miles northward; just above Baghdad there is a ferry for transporting railway wagons across the river, thus connecting the two lines. In addition to various other services, there is a regular weekly 5^ steamer service from Basra to Baghdad. For W/T communications, see page 29. For aircraft communications, see page 29. Above Baghdad navigation is usually only by rafts, though small steamers can ascend to Samarra.Chap. VIII.] EUPHRATES AND BAHMANSHIR RIVERS 275 Chart 2483. EUPHRATES RIVER.—This river rises in two branches in the mountains of Armenia; the northern branch, the Kara Su or Frat, takes its rise about 20 miles north-north-westward of the city of Erzerum, in Turkey, and after flowing for a distance of 5 about 275 miles, is joined by the Murad Su; the latter river rises in the mountains between Lake Van and Mount Ararat and flows westward for about 415 miles. The united stream then flows southward, into Syria, and thence south-eastward, past Hit and Hilla, near which latter are the ruins of ancient Babylon, to its 10 junction with the Tigris. The total length of the river is probably some 1,600 miles. The difference between the Euphrates and the Tigris is very marked; whereas the latter has a 3 to 4-knot current, the Euphrates has little, if any. The difference in appearance is also very marked 15 at Qurna, the water of the Tigris being muddy and chocolate in colour, while that of the Euphrates is very dark but comparatively clear. The Tigris water is said, however, to be the more wholesome of the two. See distance table on page 263. From Qurna the main channel of the Euphrates trends west- 20 south-westward, with depths of 2 fathoms (3 ni 7) for a short distance, but it soon deepens to 3 or 4 fathoms (5 m 5 or 7 iri 3), and for the first 20 miles presents no difficulty to a vessel drawing 12 feet (3 m 7). Beginning about 7 miles from Qurna, there is a great U-shaped bend, which, however, is not sharp; its concave side is always 25 deep. After ascending for about 20 miles, the depths gradually shoal to 2 fathoms (3 m 7) at about 2| miles below the large village of Kabaish. Thence the depths decrease to 9 feet (2 m 7) before reaching the village, the deepest water being close to the northern banjc. 30 At the village itself, the depths are from 12 to 18 feet (3 m 7 to 5 m 5). Shallow-draught vessels drawing 4 feet (l m 2) can reach the entrance of the Hammar lake, about 6 miles above Kabaish, but the depth in the lake is only 2 or 3 feet (0 m 6 or 0 m 9). The bottom is every- ^ where very soft mud. _ on' 35 Hammar lake has another outlet in Qarmat All, see page 270. Chart 1235. , . BAHMANSHIR RIVER .—The river is approached through Khor al Amaya, see page 258, across the fiats, between Marakat Abadan and Maidan Ali, over which the least depth for a distance 40 of about 5 miles would appear to be from 3 to 4 feet (0 m 9 to l m 2). The channel is not marked in any way, and the banks on either side of it do not dry until nearly 4 miles of shoal water has been crossed. At the mouth of the river there is a depth of 8 feet (2 m 4) and within it the depths increase to as much as 33 feet (10 m l) in one place, 45 though higher up there are no less than five bars, over which the depth on the three upper bars is not greater than one foot (0 m 3). Bahmanshir river is about 42 miles in length from its mouth to Mohammereh [Lat. 30° 26'N., Long. 48° 10' E.) at its junction with the Karun river and could apparently be ascended for a distance 50 of about 28 miles by vessels drawing up to 7 feet (2 m l). There are two large bends near the middle of its course, the first commencing about 81 miles above the mouth of the river. The width of the Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b, 2483.276 BAHMANSHIR AND KARUN RIVERS [Chap. VIII. Chart 1235. river near its mouth is from 3 to 4 cables, but in its northern half it is in some places only 1^ cables wide. The banks of the river, near its mouth, are of soft mud, sloping down to the water's edge 5 and covered with coarse grass above high-water mark; at a few miles above its mouth the banks are steeper and harder. At about 22 miles from the mouth of the river, villages and date gardens commence to line the banks and continue thence almost uninter ruptedly to the junction with the Karun river. The northern part 10 of the river, for about 15 miles, is very shallow and the depths are uneven, some of the mudbanks drying almost across the channel. As there are no pilots for the Bahmanshir river, vessels desiring to enter should endeavour to obtain the services of a bagala man, who is acquainted with it; if obliged to enter without local know- 15 ledge, it is advisable to start on a rising tide. Within the entrance the deepest water is close to the bank on the concave side of each bend, and vessels should cross over at the commencement of each change in the direction of the river. Chart 1235, plans of Karun river. 20 KARUN RIVER.—-General remarks. —This, the largest of the rivers of Persia and the only one navigable by steam vessels, takes its rise in the mountains of the Bakhtiyari country, about 100 miles westward of Isfahan, and after flowing for a considerable distance south-eastward, south-westward and then north-westward, 25 enters the plains of 'Arabistan some 15 or 20 miles northward of Shushtar [Lat. 31° 48' N., Long. 49° 00' E.), situated nearly 120 miles north-north-eastward of Mohammerah. The Karun is navigable by river steamers of 2 feet (0 m 6) draught at any time, and of 5 feet (l m 5) draught when the river is high. 30 The river is from 2 to 5 cables wide, and the channel is very narrow in places, especially at the bends, where, as usual, the deepest water is, in most cases, on the concave side. Sandbanks extend from most of the points, sometimes half-way across the river. Vessels of 12 feet (3 m 7) draught can reach Samana bend, 14 miles 35 above Mohammerah; but off the point there, the channel is narrow and the bend very sharp. The best months for navigating the river are from December to May or June, when it is in spate either from heavy rain or melting snow. 40 The river is said to rise sometimes as much as 20 feet (6 m l) or more between January and March due to very heavy rains up country; but such rises subside so quickly that advantage cannot be taken of them for navigational purposes. The rate of the stream in a high river is from 4 to 6 knots, and in a low river about 2 knots. 45 There is least water from August to first rain, when, for 20 miles below Ahwaz, the navigation is difficult for a steamer of 2^ feet (0 m 8) draught. The tide is felt as far as Ali-bin Husain's tomb, 30 miles above the entrance. Mohammerah to Ahwaz. —The Karun river enters the eastern 50 end of the Hafar channel, see page 266, the main volume of its water flowing through that channel into the Shatt al 'Arab, the remainder turning south-eastward into the Bahmanshir river. From Mohammerah to Ahwaz, a distance of 110 miles, the course of the Charts 1265, 2837b, 748b, 2483.»-fz Chap. VIII.] KARUN RIVER 277 Chart 1235, plans of Karun river. river is tortuous between low banks, through an almost desert country, but abounding with a great variety of wild fowl. The first vegetation is above Reuben's tomb, 16 miles north-north eastward of Mohammerah, whence the banks become fringed with 5 light scrub, the country being extensive plains. Farsiat village is on the south-eastern bank, about 65 miles above the entrance; at 2 miles below it, and projecting about 30 feet (G 111 !) from the opposite side of the river is a rock, covered at high water. 10 As far as Kut 'Abdullah, a village on the south-eastern side of the river, about 37 miles above Farsiat village, the bottom is mostly sand, or sand and mud, and with the above exception is free from rocks. Off Kut 'Abdullah are rocks, probably the remains of old build- 15 ings, with a depth of about 3 feet (0 m 9) over them. From this village to Bandar Nasiri, a distance of about 6 miles, the river is much encumbered with sandbanks and subject to constantly changing channels. At times the reach has to be bandalled to ensure sufficient depth for the passage of barges loaded to a draught of 2^ feet (0 m 7). 20 From Bandar Nasiri, the limit of navigation from seaward, to Ahvvaz, a distance of a little more than one mile, there is a great rise in the river bed and a series of heavy, almost impassable rapids, followed by a navigable stream above the rapids. Off Bandar Nasiri is a small natural basin, where vessels unload, and goods for tranship- 25 ment to the upper waters are conveyed thither by train. Ahwaz [Lat. 31° 28' N., Long. 48° 43' E.) is a modern town with, including Bandar Nasiri, a population of about 4,000 in habitants, and is the centre of the grain district; it is reported to be 200 feet (61 in 0) above the sea. 30 There is a British Consul, and also a Vice-Consul, at Ahwaz, but the latter visits Isfahan from May until October. A range of hills, about 220 feet (67 m l) above the surrounding plain, marks the position of Ahwaz; three small peaks lie close together, and the highest, elevated 420 feet (128^0), is about 2 miles south- 35 eastward of the town. Chart 2483. . . Ahwaz to Shushtar. —The river, above the rapids, is smuous, from one to 3 cables wide, and flows between banks from 15 to 20 feet (4 m 6 to 6 m l) high, which gradually become steeper near Band-i-Qir, about 35^ miles above Ahwaz. The country on each side of the river is extensive plains. j u In general, the navigation of the upper river is more difficult than that of the lower; but, with the possible exception of the 2-foot (0®6) reach above Band-i-Qir, there is no part which cannot be 45 negotiated with safety during the hours of darkness provided search lights are fitted, and greater use made of buoys and navigational aids. , „ Between Ahwaz and Graneh, situated 2 or 3 miles up river, Iia ' vl ' gation is simple after clearing the islets immediately above the former. At Graneh, a few patches of stone have to be negotiated, and caution is necessary. From Graneh to Kut Saiyid Amaieh, a distance of about 7 miles, progress becomes slower, but most of the shoals are visible and navigation is not difficult.278 KARUN RIVER [Chap. VIII. Chart 2483. From Kut Saiyid Amaieh to Wais, about 15 miles, the banks and shoals become more numerous, and a few groundings may be expected. 5 Wais is a large village about 24| miles above Ahwaz, at the southern end of a long reach. From Wais to Band-i-Qir, there is a straight reach in which it is stated that there are only two bad places, where the river bed is of stone, namely at Helowdella and Bait Senafie. At Band-i-Qir, the river divides into three branches, named Ab-i-Gargar (Gargar river), Ab-i-Shatait (Shatait river), and Ab-i-Diz (Diz river); the first two re-uniting above Shushtar and resuming the name of Karun river. At Band-i-Qir, vessels bound for Shushtar enter the Ab-i-Gargar, the eastern branch, for the Ab-i-Shatait, the middle branch, is 15 completely barred about one mile above Band-i-Qir by a ridge of rocks, which renders it impassable to a steam vessel, and nearly so to native boats. A bridge spans the river at Band-i-Qir, but it can be opened to allow the passage of the river craft. At Band-i- Qir the stream is from a quarter to half a cable wide, with general 20 depths of from 3 to 6 feet (0 m 9 to l m 8); under the telegraph wires there, a rocky ridge leaves a very narrow channel, barely permitting the passage of the steamers. Kyat peak, a triangular-shaped summit of the nearest range of hills, is an excellent mark. 25 The banks of the river in this locality are from 30 to 40 feet (9 m l to 12 m 2) high, and a few miles above Band-i-Qir, the remains of an old ruined city are discernible, embedded in the cliff. The reach between Band-i-Qir and Saiyid Hassan, situated about 6| miles up stream, is the most difficult of all, by reason of the narrowness 30 of the channel and the depth available. The stern-wheelers and barges are frequently aground, or else strike the banks every few minutes. Above Saiyid Hassan, conditions improve, but progress is slow as far as Dar-i-Khazineh, a distance of about 15 miles. The steamers stop abreast of Shalaillyeh village, which lies about 2 35 miles from the river bank 8 miles below Shustar. At a short distance farther up, navigation ceases. Shushtar [Lat. 31° 48' N., Long. 49° 00' E.) is a large town with about 10,000 inhabitants; it is the seat of the Governor of Arabistdn, an official appointed by the Persian Government, 40 and has a considerable garrison. Cargo is conveyed to it from the steamers' stopping-place by pack mules, the distance being about 7 miles. The principal exports are grain, cotton, wool, gum, and oil seeds; and the imports, piece and general goods from Bombay, iron from Europe, and tea from India. Inferior carpets 45 and native fabrics are manufactured. Diz river. —In August, 1891, the s.s. Shushan, a stern wheeler, 80 feet (24 in 4) long, 30 feet (9 m l) beam, and 21 feet (0 m 8) draught, ascended the Ab-i-Diz, which, starting from Band-i-Qir, follows a very tortuous course through flat uncultivated country and vast 50 jungle as far as Kut Abdush Shah, Entering by a channel 20 yards (18 m 3) wide, the vessel proceeded for 1| hours through a winding channel, with a depth of 3 feet (0 m 9); it then deepened to an average of 9 feet (2 m 7), except where barred by long sand banks about every 5 miles; in the crossings there were depths of 55 3 feet (0 m 9).Chap. VIII.] KARUN RIVER 279 Chart 2483. On the third day, the Shushan arrived at Kut Bandar. At this place a reef of rocks extends across the river, through which is a straight channel 4 feet (l m 2) deep. Thence passing through intricate channels, the vessel arrived at Umm 'al Wawieh, about 10 miles beyond Kut Bandar, and about 20 miles from Dizful by road. Not being able to proceed farther, the return journey was com menced on the following day, and much difficulty was experienced through grounding and striking in the bends. The ascent occupied 51 hours and the descent 36 hours. During spring and winter, the Ab-i-Diz can be navigated as far as Kut 'Abdush Shah, about 80 miles by river, and a farther 10 miles by road, from DizMl, a town of about 15,000 inhabitants, which exports rice, oil, seeds, cotton, and native fabrics, and is a dis tributing centre for imports. Communications. —Regular steamer services are maintained between Mohammerah and Ahwaz, the upward passage taking 2 days and the return one day. Between Ahwaz and Shushtar an irregular service is run by the local merchants; the upward passage takes 2 days and the return one day. There are Persian post and telegraph offices at Bandar Nasiri, and at Dizful and Shushtar.

N = Greatest north declination. S=Greatest south declination. Explanation .—Tables I to IV depend on the assumption that the stream is entirely due to the moon. As this assumption is not correct, and as the observations available are insufficient for complete analysis, no high degree of accuracy is to be expected in the streams predicted from the tables. Tables I to IV give rates of the semi-diurnal constituent of the stream at springs, and of the diurnal constituent due to the moon s greatest declination. Table V gives factors, by which these rates are to be multiplied in order to obtain the rates at other astronomical conditions. The streams in Table I are rotary. It has, therefore, been necessary to give tables for both the N. and E. components. At other positions the streams run mainly in two opposite directions only, as given under the tables. The best results will be obtained by reference to the time of higher high water at the local tidal station, computed from the harmonic constants (see Admiralty Tide Tables, Part 11, Section II)- Diurnal inequality in the local heights of high water is small and the high water to be considered the higher, and used for reference, is always that which differs in time by about |-day from the corresponding higher296 appendix v high water at Shatt al 'Arab bar, even though, as computed, this is the lower high water. Instructions .—The first line of each portion of each table gives the interval from higher high water at the local reference station, the second line the interval from the corresponding higher high water at Shatt al 'Arab bar. The line marked SD in the left column gives the rates of the semi-diurnal constituent of the stream, and that marked D the rates of the diurnal constituent, according to the time intervals from higher high water. The rates given in the tables are to be multiplied by the factor from Table V, according to astronomical conditions. The stream to be expected at any time is the sum of the rates of the semi-diurnal and diurnal constituents at that time. When using Table I, the N. and E. stream components must be computed separately and their resultant found from the Traverse table.

Note .—Difference in times of H.H.W. at the local reference station and at Shatt al 'Arab bar is not constant ; variations in this difference result in small differences in the computed stream. Current. Observations show currents as follows :— Position of Table I : In December, E.ly, 0-2 kn. Position of Table II : In March, SW.ly, 0-75 kn ; and in January, S.ly, 0-5 kn. In Henjam sound : In December, no appreciable current. Near Jezirat Tunb : In April, W.ly, 0-25 kn. Information regarding currents in the entrance of the Persian gulf is incomplete ; the probability is that, owing to evaporation in the Gulf, an in-going current runs in summer, and that in winter, when evaporation is least, the in-going current is at its minimum. From the results of observations, given above, it is probable that the rate of the in-going current in the narrowest part of the entrance, may be as much as 2 kn. at midsummer, decreasing westward and south-eastward. Horizontal movement of the water is the resultant of stream and current. Stream, as found from the tables, is therefore to be com bined with current, using the Traverse table.f#4^ 321 LIST OF SAILING DIRECTIONS, &amp;c., PUBLISHED BY THE HYDROGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT OF THE ADMIRALTY, AUGUST, 1932.
