The main correspondents are the Political Agent for Bahrain, the Director of Customs and Port Officer for Bahrain, and the Government of India Export Trade Controllers in Bombay and Karachi. These officials discuss the allotment of Government of India surplus quota goods among merchants in Bahrain, Dubai and Sharjah and exchange distribution lists containing the names of approved importers (local merchants) and their Indian exporters or shippers in Bombay and Karachi, as well as the nature and quantity of their consignments. There are also several letters, mainly from local merchants to the Political Agent in Bahrain, asking him to grant them import licences, so that their exporters and shippers in Bombay and Karachi may apply to the Export Trade Controller in their home port for a Government of India export licence. In response to several trade enquiries from the Indian Government Trade Commissioner for the Near and Middle East in Alexandria, the Political Agent in Bahrain provides him with lists of Bahrain merchants interested in importing sports goods, paints and varnishes from India. The file also contains several Government of India circular letters issued by the Chief Controller of Exports, New Delhi to all regional Export Trade Controllers in India, notifying them about the relaxation of export controls on certain textiles, metals, manufactured articles and other goods.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Export Trade Controller</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Trade Commissioner for the Near and Middle East</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Commodities</topic></subject><subject><topic>Manufactured goods</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Director of Customs and Port Officer</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Export Trade Controller, Karachi</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Chief Controller of Exports</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Dubai</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Trucial Coast</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Sharjah</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Exports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Imports</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0000d2#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
