Cox and Col Knox stood 4 years of 4V each - but not many people can - I had a year of it and that «ae a year too much. I always think Bushire heavenly compared to it. muscat compares more nearly with the other plaj^ce^. - / I hope to hear something about that sample of oxide from Kuriyat today- mien I went to M’h’rah in the Lawrence after leaving muscat I need hardly say that I forgot to hand over the sample there £ and had to send subsequently by the hand of mmrx one Trapie (?) who happened to come here. I sent it to A.P.O.C. as I think A.T. will ge’ it • If one sends a sample home or to India it takes months and months, and months- I think it possible however that A.P.O.C. may say they want a sample of several toms before they can say if * is a good commercial proposition, that happened with a sample we ' 1 had from some island or other. Hope you are fit. trust you would be at muscat about 15th or 16th march?
