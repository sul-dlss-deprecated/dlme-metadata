W ith reference to my docket No. 114B .P. of yesterday's date, I am directed to state, for the information of His Excellency the Governor of Bombay in Council, that the Government of India will appoint a Commission for the investigation of the case against His Highness Mulhar Rao Gaekwar. 2. The Commission will require an efficient Secretary well acquainted with the Guzeratee and Mahrattee languages, and I am to request that His Excellency in Council will be pleased to nominate, for the approval of the Governor-General in Council, an officer of the Bombay Service for this duty. 3. The Governor-General in Council desires that the prosecution of the case on behalf of the Government of India should be entrusted to the Advocate-General of Bombay. He will be allowed a Junior Counsel to assist him. The Governor-General in Council is of opinion that the Junior Counsel would most suitably be taken from the Bombay Civil Service, an officer accus tomed to deal with legal questions being selected. This, however, will be left to the Governor in Council to arranore in communication with the Advocate- O General. 4. The expenses of the Commission will be borne by the Government of India, the question of recovering them from the Baroda State being left for consideration hereafter. I am, however, to request that the recommendations of the Bombay Government may be submitted as to the pay and allowances to be granted to the Secretary to the Commission and to the Junior Counsel and the remuneration to be given to the Advocate-General.

I am to request that you will send a copy of the depositions enclosed in Mr. Souter's report and of these charges to His Highness the Gaekwar with a letter informing him that you furnish him with a copy of the statements made to the Government of India whereon they have acted against him ; that such state ments speak for themselves ; but that for His Highness' better information you send a paper showing the offences which the Government of India are led to impute to His Highness, and as to which they w T ill direct a Commission to enquire ; that His Highness will receive the earliest possible information of the day on which the Commission will sit; but that as you are at present advised H is Highness must expect it to commence on 18th February. 3. Henceforward you will conduct the proceedings yourself with such advice as the staff placed at your disposal by the Government of Bombay may afford you. The Bombay Government have been asked to arrange with the Advocate-General at Bombay for the prosecution of the case. A copy of this communication will also be sent to the Bombay Government, but you should atonce let the Advocate-General know direct from yourself what has been done by way of giving notice to Mulhar Rao Gaekwar. The Bombay Government will be requested to inform the Advocate-General that he will be looked to as the principal adviser with respect to the enquiry. 4. As the enquiry will be one of political and not of purely legal origin, and the results will be of a political and not a legal character, the use of legal terms has been avoided in framing the heads of charge, and it will be advisable to avoid them throughout. In all the proceedings the use of popular expressions is to be preferred to legal ones. No. 150B.P.

Gaekwar very anxious to retain his salute, but to grant it would be illogical and might give rise to very inconvenient impressions in the minds of witnesses and the public. I detained a telegram addressed to Bombay, and yesterday watched the addressee in the train and arrested him here. He proves to be one of the first class confidential intriguers. He is quite alarmed and is on the point of giving most important information. Enclosure I^io. 14. Telegram, No. 158P., dated 16tli January 1875.

The only error is where the reporter states, I said unfortunately a man cannot guide his own destiny. My words were, unfortunately a man has antecedents. The Bombay Times of sixteenth contains a brief summary of subsequent interview with Sirdars, but there were about three thousand people in the compound representing all classes, all of which I addressed in succession. All quiet. 1 think further evidence may be expected. The troops were not disarmed.

From— Sir Lewis Pelly , Baroda, To—Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. Twenty-nine guns parked; of these three are brass breech-loaders, cast and completely turned out in Baroda Arsenal. Gaekwar very anxious to retain his salute, but to grant it would be illogical and might give rise to very inconvenient impressions in the minds of witnesses and the public. I detained a telegram addressed to Bombay, and yesterday watched the addressee in the train and arrested him here. He proves to be one of the first class confidential intriguers. He is quite alarmed and is on the point of giving most important information. Enclosure No. 14. Telegram, No. 158P., dated 16th January 1S75.

From— Sir Lewis Pelly , Baroda, To—Foreign Secretary, Calcutta. T he Bombay Gazette of sixteenth contains a detailed accurate report ot what passed at the interview immediately preceding the arrest. The only error is where the reporter states, I said unfortunately a man cannot guide his own destiny. My words were, unfortunately a man has antecedents. The Bombay Times of sixteenth contains a brief summary of subsequent interview with Sirdars, but there were about three thousand people in the compound representing all classes, all of which I addressed in succession. All quiet, i think further evidence may be expected. The troops were not disarmed. Officer Commanding Field Force reports that before Commission arrives he would be glad to have a squadron of Native Cavalry for escorts and run work. At present the only Cavalry here are twelve men forming my escort If approved I will apply to Bombay for them. Enclosure No. 16. Telegram, No. 169P., dated ISth January 1875.
