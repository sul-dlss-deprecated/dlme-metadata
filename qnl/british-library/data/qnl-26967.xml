WITH reference to the letter, dated the 15th Mehr, 1314, corresponding to the 8 th October, 1935, we acknowledge receipt of the cheque on London for £30,000 remitted by you as the result of the agreement for the settlement of the differences between the Imperial Iranian Government and the Imperial Bank of Iran. DA VAR, Minister of Finance. Enclosure 4. A greement. ( 1 ) FOR some time the Iranian Ministry of linance have objected to the mode of calculation of royalties paid by the Imperial Bank of Iran to the Imperial Government of Iran for the past years and considered same contrary to the provisions of the bank’s concession. I he Imperial Bank of Iran on the contrary regarded their action in the mode of calculation of royalty as being in strict accord with the terms of the said concession. This difference of view existed for some time until finally both parties deemed it necessary to settle the said difference amicably, and after negotiations the two parties have agreed that the Imperial Bank of Iran should pay to the Imperial Government of Iran the sum of £30,000 in full and final settlement of all royalties accounts. Accordingly, the said amount of £30,000 has to-day been paid to the Ministry of Finance by the Imperial Bank of Iran and the Iranian Government hereby accept this sum in full and final settlement of all their claims against the Imperial Bank of Iran on account of royalties. (2) On the other part, as for a number of years the Imperial Bank ot Iran have stated that during the Great War certain of their branches in Iran had been molested by a number of people and that they had thereby sustained losses and claimed compensation in connexion therewith from the Imperial Government of Iran, and the Imperial Government of Iran have always rejected this claim and have not considered themselves responsible in any way whatever, now that both parties have concluded the present agreement in settlement of all outstanding questions between them, the Imperial Bank of Iran for their part heieby with draw the said claim which never was and never will be recognised by the Imperial Government of Iran. . (3) While admitting that the Imperial Bank of Iran are by virtue ot their concession exempt from the payment of tax, the Ministry of Finance latterly requested the bank to agree voluntarily to relinquish their exemption and to pay Iranian income-tax. The Ministry of Finance have now withdrawn this request and they hereby confirm that the Imperial Bank of Iran are, by virtue of their concession, dated the 30th January, 1889, exempt during the remaining period of the said concession from payment of all taxes including Iranian income-tax, property tax, customs duty, and road tax on imports for the bank s requirements. The Ministry of Finance also hereby confirm that during the period of the said concession permits to import the bank’s requirements will, as heretofore, be granted free of charge without the purchase of export certificates.

This hue been comnunioated to ne confidentially by the Tehran onager or the Bank. 2. Taw new points of interest are now raised by the Bank. In tne first plaee, while maintaining as hitherto that they were only called upon to pay royalties on net profits after deduction of British income tax, they threaten that if the dispute goes to arbitration, they will at the s me time revive their unsettled claim of dearly six million rials (£75,v0o) for the losses caused by the looting of certain of their brunches during the war by ersian troops. They are prepared, however, to waive this claim if the Iranian Government withdraw their demand for the payment, of further royalties. 3. In the second place the Bank refer to the repeated aemanda by the Ministry of finance that they should ray income-tax in this country. While maintaining that the terms of their concession exempt them from the payment of such tax, the Bank nevertheless offer to pay it in future on their net profits denveu solely from their business in Iran on tzo conditions:* (a)/ The Right Honourable Bir Samuel Hours, Bart, G.C.8.I., etc., etc., etc.. The foreign office.(a) that the National Ban* henceforth confine their functions to those of a Ban* of Issue and that the laperial Ban* of Persia «re re appointed the Comaeroial and Exchange Ban* of the country, entrusted as before with the Government's exchange business; and (b ) that an amicable agreement is reached in the question of royalties* ’ hile it is understood that the dan* has not for some years made a net profit i n this country , presumably it would at once begin to do so if it obtained the above requirements. The Ban* finally suggest that before there is any resort to arbitration, an endeavour should be made to reach a friendly settlejaent of the various points in dispute. 4. I consider that the Iranian Government will in all probability refuse to admit that there is any connexion between their demand for the payment of past royalties ana the claim advanced uy the Ban* in respect of the looting of their branches. The latter nay, however, find their claim of some use as a bargaining counter. The second proposal advanced by the Ban* is of considerable interest, though it may seem to savour of optimism, if the Iranian Government were ever to agree to it, however, it might save them not merely a lot of worry but perhaps also a considerable sum of money. Persistent rumours are in circulation as to the difficulties which the National Ban* are experiencing, and I nave heard it stated on reasonably good authority that they have an oversold foreign exchange position of some half a million sterling. The Shah is uaid. however, to have refused the request of the Ban* to be allowed to shin silver, in spite of the fact that this would enable them to close their transactxons at a profit* 5.

[E 3866/3441/34] Mr. Eldrid to Sir L. Oliphant.—(Received June ' 2 ' 2 .) Imperial Bank of Persia, Dear Sir Lancelot, London, June 19, 1935. BANK royalties. Since my letter of the 27th October, 1933, on this subject there has been little in the occasional discussions which have taken place in Tehran between subordinate officials of the Ministry of Finance and our chief manager that was worth reporting to you. We have consistently maintained our previous attitude, namely, that legal authority of high standing supported our view that the interpretation “net profits means that which remained after all expenses, taxes and other charges in whatsoever country incurred, had been deducted from gross profits. Recently, however, the Minister of Finance has become insistent upon a settlement being reached and on the 11 th ultimo wrote to the chief manager demanding, within one month, payment of the so-called arrears of taxes. At the same time the Minister asked to be supplied with a statement showing the amount of the taxes under discussion. I am forwarding, for your information, a translation of the Minister’s letter, () also a copy of the chairman s reply of the 12 th June to his Excellency, together with a copy of the statement(‘) prepared and certified by the Bank’s auditors setting forth the net profits of the bank, and other details, from the inception of the bank of 1931, when royalty became no longer payable. Here the position remains until we receive a reply from the Minister. There is another matter I should like to mention, namely, that, having been granted a supplement to our charter authorising the change in the bank’s name to “The Imperial Bank of Iran,” we are placing special resolutions before shareholders of the bank at an extraordinary general meeting to be held on the 28th instant, following our annual general meeting. I enclose a copy of our letter to shareholders dealing with this change. 0 Yours sincerely, E. M. ELDRID. Enclosure. Mr. Barnes to Minister of Finance {Tehran). Your Excellency, ^ June 12 , 1935. Mr. BUTTERS, our chief manager, has forwarded to the board of directors a translation of your letter to him of the list May last, which has received their careful attention. We deeply regret that there should be any disagreement between the Iranian Government and the Imperial Bank, which has served the country for some forty-six years, and has endeavoured to implement its concession not only in the letter but in the spirit in which it conceives it to have been granted. The board adhere to the view stated in their notes of the 8 th June, 1932, and the 28th November, 1933, in which it will be remembered they were supported by high legal authority that the interpretation “net profits’’ in article 7 means that which remained after all expenses, taxes and other charges, in whatsoever country incurred, had been deducted from gross profits. Although it holds a concession from the Government of Iran, the bank is an English company established by a British Royal Charter of Incorporation, and the net profits ( x ) Not printed. [440 y—1]referred to in article 7 of the concession dated 1899 can only be arrived at after deduction of British income tax. As requested in your Excellency’s letter, I am forwarding you, without prejudice to the bank’s contention, a statement, prepared and certified by the bank’s auditors, setting forth the net profits of the bank, royalty paid and taxes paid, not only for the years 1916 to 1925 but from the inception of the bank until 1931, when royalty no longer became payable. The statement shows the royalty paid and the royalty that would have been payable if the view of the Finance Minister were upheld. It will be seen from this statement that the Minister of Finance is mistaken in supposing that up to 1915 royalty was calculated and paid on the net profits before deduction of British income tax. In most of the years from 1891 to 1916 only the minimum royalty of £4,000 was payable, but there were a few years in which there would have been a slight excess payable, namely, 6 per cent, on £26,474 if the contention of the Ministry of Finance had been adopted. After 1916 the profits of the bank were greatly increased by the exigencies of the war and the full royalty on these profits, after deduction of British income tax, has been paid to the Iranian Government. But, as this is a point to which the attention of the Ministry of Finance is specially called, a large portion of these exceptional profits, instead of being distributed to the shareholders, were, in accordance with sound financial practice, placed to reserve funds. The reserve funds and the annual additions to them are invested in British Government securities, the interest of which is paid to the bank net, after deduction of the Government tax. The board hold that, even if the Finance Minister’s method of calculating royalty were adopted as regards the trading profits of the bank, it cannot be extended to the gross income of the invested funds which the bank has only received after deduction of tax. There is, however, another matter which would have to be considered in any arbitration, and that is the unsettled claim of the bank on the Government of Iran for the losses occasioned by the looting of certain of their branches during the war by Iranian armed forces. Full particulars of these losses have been submitted to the Government of Iran in former years, and the total amounts to 5,952,027 rials. In order, however, to arrive at a friendly settlement, the board would agree to withdraw this claim if the Government of Iran, on their part, withdraw their present demand and give the bank a complete discharge for past royalties. There is a point not mentioned in your Excellency’s letter which may be alluded to here so as to arrive at a complete settlement of all matters in dispute between the Government of Iran and the bank. This is the repeated request made by the Ministry of Finance that the bank should agree to pay income tax in Iran. It is hardly necessary to remind your Excellency of article 5 of the Bank’s concession, which lays down that “the bank, its establishments and branches, shall be wholly exempt from every kind of taxes and imposts,” and it would be impossible for the bank to agree to pay income tax in Iran on profits made in England and Iraq in addition to British income tax. But as regards net profits derived purely in Iran, as certified by our auditors, the board would not be unwilling to pay the Iran income tax, provided they were given a satisfactory quid 'pro quo. Reasonable compensation for such a departure from the terms of the concession would be not only the friendly settlement of the royalty question as indicated above, but also, as suggested by General Amir Khosrowi, the confine ment of the National Bank to the functions of a Bank of Issue only and the reappointment of the Imperial Bank as the commercial and exchange bank of the country, entrusted, as before, with the Government’s exchange business. It is gathered, however, from the final sentence in your Excellency’s letter you would prefer that an endeavour first be made to settle the matter by agreement rather than by resort to arbitration. In this the board concur, and to this end they suggest that the various points in dispute be brought before representatives of the Government and the bank with a view to a settlement being arrived at.

I enclose for your information a copy of the letter No.8018 from the Minister of Finance addressed to me, with a translation of it done in this office. A copy of my letter of acknowledgement is also enclosed. Arbitration is dealt with in our Concession Appendix No*5, Article 3. 'If necessary the third Arbitrator will be appointed by the President of the Economic ftnd Financial Organisation of the League of Nations'. Article 10 of the Concession, referred to by the Minister of Finance was modified by appendix No.4, Article 8, and again by Appendix No.5, article 3. So far I have not traced that the manner of calculating the Royalties was changed in 1916. If any other question occurs to you I shall be very glad to try to reply. Yours sincerely, (Signed) O.A. Butters. • Knatchbull-Hugessen, Esq., C.M.O., His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, etc .$ etc .f etc., TEHERAN*From the Iranian Minister of Finance, addressed to The Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Tehran. Ho.8018, dated 30th Ordibehesht, 1314 (llth May, 1935) During the last few year® the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly objected to the method of calculation of the annual 6 ' royalty payable to the Imperial Government in tema of Article 7 of the concession dated 1889. The said Ministry has been »nd is of the opinion that the 6A royalty should h&amp;ve been calculated on the annual net profit, th* t is, before deduction of any tax whatever payable in England. rhit the Bank have not hitherto acted in accordance with the view of the Ministry of Finance, whereas at the outset the Bank adopted this same view end in conformity therewith, during the first twenty-five years the concession was in force, i.e., from 1891 to 1916, they calculated and paid the royalty on the net profits before deduction of British Income tax. It is only since 1916 that the Bank changed the above method and Instead of taking as basis the net profits, on which royalty should have been calculated, they deducted therefrom British income tax and even other taxes. This f» ct substantiates in the clearest manner the legal arguments net forth in this Ministry’s letter of 5th April, 1932 and in the note dated 18th June, 1933, to which the Bank replied per their notes dated 8th June, 1932 and 88th November, 1933. Last year when the matter was brought to ray notice I gave instructions ttot the question be dUecuseed verbally with the Bank with a view to arranging for the settlement of the account. But to my regret the said negotiations have been fruitless and as it is impossible to allow/allow this fltnt® of things to continue any longer, I a» writing to infora you that the Ministry of Finance requi e that you will remit to the Treasurer General, within one month, the arrear of royalties due to the Government since 1916, on account of various taxes paid in England and deducted from the net profits annually. You will no doubt admit that in this respect that Ministry of Finance has shown more than usual leniency and it would not be proper to allow the question to remain as it stands any more. In order to obtain assurance as to the method of calculation of royalty during the s^iid period, I request that you will send, within the time-limit referred to above, a statement in the form of the accompanying model in respect of each year from 1916 to 1926. Should the Bank, contrary to my expectation, foil to give effect to this request, the matter will have to be referred to arbitration in terms of Article 10 of the concession. Do you think, however, that it would be becoming for the Bank that we refer to arbitration so apparent a question? Minister of Finance.

Sir, The General Manager of the laperial Bank of Persia has just called to tell me that he was summoned By the Acting (Persian) Treasurer General yesterday on a 'matter of great urgency' which the Imperial Goyemment hoped could Be settled within twenty four hours* 2. This urgent matter proved to Be the manner in which the southern customs receipts hare Been handled ever since the 1911 Loan Agreement* A. B. 4, The relevant passages of that Agreement are The Imperial Government of Persia undertakes that throughout the continuance of the loan all sums collected By the Customs Administration shall Be paid to the Bank at the ports of collection, or at its nearest Branch, week By week, for meeting the prior charges referred to above and for the service of the loan, and an account of such receipts shall Be sub mitted to the Persian Government By the Bank at the end of each month. The Bank shall, out of the monies so collected, pay the prior charges above mentioned and the interest and sinking fund of the loan, and shall hold the surplus at the disposal of the Imperial Government of Persia. Mr. Wilkinson told me that in the past, though it /almost The Eight Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I., etc., etc. , etc., The Foreign Office.almost Invariably happened that the first week's customs receipts more than covered the five thousand odd pounds required for the service of the loan, the practice has been only to pay over to the Persian Government the balance at the end of each completed month, interest at one per centum being allowed on the sum involved. As a natter of fact he had frequently, by private arrangement with the Treasurer General, made advances before the expiration of the month* 5. Vhtkt was now being asked was - and the Acting Treasurer General made it clear that it was a matter of the Shah’s personal amour-propre - that the southern customs receipts should be credited to the Persian Government as and when encashed on precisely the same footing as the receipts from other customs posts; in return the Persian Government would undertake to pay one month in advance, the money required for the service of the loan. 6. I observed to Mr. Wilkinson it seemed to me that what was in fact proposed was to substitute the general guarantee of the Persian Government for a definitely ear marked source of revenue, thereby depreciating the value of the security. He agreed that this was what it amounted to. 7. Turning to the two paragraphs I have quoted above, I said that it seemed to me that it would be no violation of their sense if he offered to liberate to the Persian Govern ment the revenues as they came in week by week, instead of at the end of the month, once the sum required for the loan service was encashed. 8. After some further discussion we agreed that Mr. Wilkinson would make the offer indicated above as a practical solution of the matter. We imagine that if it is indeed a /fact- 3 - fact that amour-propre is involved, this offer would not he ^ \ acceptable. In that caae Mr. Wilkinson will say that all he can do is to refer the matter to the Board of the Bank, # and indicate that in his opinion, the latter will probably decide that the terms of the Loan Agreement preclude them from meeting the wishes of the Persian Government. The only explanation of this curious development which I can think of is that the Shah has demanded that some sort of statement of the day by day money available should be prepared for him; that when this statement had been prepared it showed that the southern customs receipts were not available except after a delay of a week or two; that the explanation of this circumstance which he received did not satisfy him and he concluded that a foreign lien on the southern customs was no longer in accordance with ithe spirit of the times and that Persian sovereign rights must therefore be immediately asserted.

Mr. Eldrid to Sir L. Oliphant.—(Received October 30.) Dear Sir Lancelot The Imperial Bank of Persia, London, October 27, 1933. BANK royalties. With reference to the discussions which have been taking place between the Persian Government and ourselves regarding the method we have, in the past, adopted in calculating royalties, the board has now, with the assistance of counsel, prepared its answer to the Ministry of Finance’s letter and memorandum of the 18th June last. I enclose a copy, for your information. A draft of it is being sent by to-day's mail to Mr. Wilkinson, who will address it to the Persian Government in answer to their letter. Mr. Wilkinson, however, is being requested to exhibit the letter to His Britannic Majesty's Minister before presentation. Reply by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Memorandum by the Ministry of Finance accompanying its Note to the Bank of June 18. 1933. THE arguments set forth in the memorandum of the 18th June, 1933, have been carefully considered by the bank and those advising it. The bank and its advisers cannot accept those arguments as establishing the position claimed by the Government and they remain of the opinion that the method adopted by the bank in computing the sums payable to the Government is correct. 2. Ihe point at issue is clearly defined and the bank feel that no useful purpose would be served by a restatement of their case. The bank desire, however, to make one comment upon the arguments put forward by the Government and tnis comment applies to, and in the view of the bank, vitiates all those arguments. It appears to the bank that the Government fails to attach any weight to the fact that the operations designed to lead to a profit, part of which’was to be paid to the Go\ eminent, were, with the assent of the Government, to be conducted by a British concern; and that such concern necessarily became subject to British taxes and bound to pay British taxes in respect of its operations before those entitled to participate in profits could receive their shares. That expenditure, indeed, must be made or provided for before divisible profits can be ascertained or divided. The principle of the concession is that whatever the divisible profits might be the Government should be guaranteed a minimum yearly sum; subject to this, the Government follows the fortunes of the bank and shares with the bank, in agreed proportions, the profits falling for distribution. The Govern ment, in the view of the bank, is seeking to have a share in a hypothetical sum which does not exist for division. 3. So far, therefore, from the bank disputing an evident right of the Government, the bank takes the view that it is giving full faith and effect both to the letter and to the spirit of the concession.

Mr. Mallet to Sir John Simon.—(Received July 19.) (No. 323.) Sir, Gulhek, July 1, 1933. I HAVE the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of a letter and memorandum that the Imperial Bank of Persia have just received from the Ministry of Finance on the subject of the Ministry’s claim that the bank should not have taken income tax paid in the United Kingdom into account before calculating the “ net profits ” on which the royalty of 6 per cent, was payable to the Persian Government in past years. The royalty came to an end in 1930, at the time of the cancellation of the bank’s right to issue notes (see article 2 (2) of Appendix No. 5 to the bank’s concession signed on the 13th May, 1930), but the Ministry’s claim is in respect of all years between 1889 and that date. During many of these years the royalty would not have reached the minimum figure of £4,000 which the bank was obliged to pay in any circumstances, even if United Kingdom income tax had been taken into account after, instead of before, the net profits were calculated; but making all allowances for these years the sums involved would be likely to prove very considerable. 2. I understand that the chief manager would like his board to take the dispute to arbitration if the Ministry persist in pressing this claim. 3. I venture to draw attention to the fact that the date, the 8th June, quoted in the Ministry’s letter is the 8th June, 1932, which means that the Persian Government have taken a whole year to decide upon their answer. 4. I am sending a copy of this despatch to the Department of Overseas Trade. I have, &amp;c. V. A. L. MALLET. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Persian Ministry of Finance to Imperial Bank of Persia. The Imperial Bank of Persia, June 18, 1933. I HAVE to acknowledge receipt of the letter dated the 8th June from Mr. Barnes, chairman of your board of directors, and I have taken note of the contents of the memorandum attached thereto with regard to the mode of compu tation of the annual royalties due by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government. In reply I send you herewith a memorandum containing the views of the Ministry of Finance on the subject in dispute. This Ministry hopes that the arguments set forth in its memorandum will this time be considered convincing enough by the bank to settle the difference and that the bank's directors will not allow the aggravation to such an extent of a dispute over so evident a right. Since the Government have always helped the bank in every respect and still do so, the bank should not, by contesting such an obvious right, shake the Govern ment’s belief in the sincerity of the bank’s friendship. HASSAN TAGHI ZADEH. (Seal of the Ministry of Finance.) [859 t—2]2 Enclosure 2 in No. 1. Memorandum on the Mode of Computation of the Dues Payable by the Imperial Bank of Persia to the Persian Government. (a) THE General Revenue Department, in its letter dated the 5th April, 1932, requested the Imperial Bank of Persia to send to it certain information in order that it might be able to a certain extent to probe into the accounts submitted^K by the bank’s experts in determining the dues payable by the bank. No reply has, however, been received on this subject. It will be necessary, before the account of the said dues is definitely closed, to obtain a clear and detailed answer in this respect. In the above-mentioned letter it was pointed out that, by virtue of the terms of the concession, the bank should have had its centre and registered office (“ siege social ”) in Tehran and that, therefore, the bank cannot exempt from Persian dues a part of its net profits which it pays to the British Government as income tax because of its British nationality and its domicile in London. Further, the Revenue Department had stated that the bank had at least impliedly admitted that the dues payable to the Persian Government had priority, inasmuch as the said dues had been debited to the profit and loss account before British income tax was taken into account. It was also pointed out that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (Limited), whose concession was similarly worded, had never raised any objection in this respect and had always paid the dues out of net profits before deducting British income tax. (b) The Imperial Bank of Persia contested the above interpretation, and in the course of its memorandum dated the 8th June, 1932, advanced certain argu ments which, briefly stated, are as follows :— Bank’s Arguments. (1) As the bank had to work partly in Persia and partly abroad, and as it had to be constituted in accordance with the laws of a foreign country, and seeing that disputes between the contracting parties had to be referred to arbitration, the concession must, therefore, be considered as an international agreement and without reference to either Persian or English law, the concession must be inter preted and construed in accordance with the surrounding circumstances and the intention of the contracting parties at the time. The Persian Government, by approving the bank's statutes, has obviously taken full cognisance of the matter, and has also admitted that the bank must comply with the laws of the country where it is constituted and, particularly, pay British income tax so that it may continue its operations and make profits. Therefore, by ‘ ‘ net profits ’ ’ is meant profits remaining in Persia after payment of British financial and other duties. Refutation of above A rguments. The concession granted to the Imperial Bank of Persia has no international agreement aspect whatsoever. It is merely an agreement concluded in Persia between the Persian Government and a foreign national laying down the terms under which the concessionnaire should work on Persian territory (without for bidding him from extending and expanding his operations abroad). It is not, therefore, so important or effective if the Persian Government has not objected against the constitution of the bank, the establishment of which it had sanctioned, as a British company. Moreover, an implied agreement on a question of appearance (form) cannot be considered as proof that the Government has waived some of the rights explicitly assured (reserved) to itself in the concession, nor can it prove that the Government has permitted the deduction of a portion of the net profits due to it by virtue of the concession. The Imperial Bank of Persia must have its registered office (“siege social ”— “Markaz-i-Asli ”) and its centre of operations (“Markaz-i-Amaliyat”) in Persia. In justice and equity the bank should centralise in Persia all its profits derived in Persia and abroad and pass same to the royalty account. From these should be deducted only such expenditures as are in reality necessary for the carrying out of the operations mentioned in the concession. British income tax should on no condition be debited to this account, because it represents a part of the net profits derived in Persia and abroad which the concessionnaire company freely pays to the British Government by reason of its having selected British nationality.3 Bank's Arguments. (2) Over a great number of years the Persian Government has accepted that royalty should be calculated on net profits after deduction of British income tax, and the High Commissioner who represented the Persian Government was no doubt aware of the method of calculation of royalty, and never objected. This is proof that the Persian Government has heretofore accepted the bank’s interpre tation regarding deduction of British income tax from net profits. Refutation of above Arguments. 1 he concession foresees the presence at the general meeting of shareholders and meetings of the directors in Tehran of the Government’s special envoy. Apart from this the Imperial Bank of Persia did not in the past send detailed statements of accounts so as to ascertain that British income was being deducted from net profits, and as no documents or positive proofs of any kind were presented, the Persian Government had been unable to agree to the amount of royalties it has received. Such payments have, on the contrary, been treated as part payments made on account and the Persian Government has not waived its rights. There fore, the implied consent of the Persian Government which, it is alleged, existed does not apply. On the contrary, the payment of £87,304 in 1928 indicates that the Imperial Bank of Persia itself impliedly agreed to the indefinite nature of the Peisian Government annual royalties accounts. Moreover, by virtue of the concession, the Persian Government is entitled to 6 per cent, of the net profits of the bank. By net profits is meant profits less expenditure, and by expenditure is meant moneys spent in the course of deriving income. For this reason income tax payable in Fngland cannot be looked upon as expenditure, and for the same reason the Government’s royalty must be paid before the deduction of the said tax, especially since the Imperial Bank of Persia, in spite of having had the sole right of issue of notes, has been exempt from all taxes, including income tax, whereas in England, where it has no such monopolistic concession, it pays income tax. In the circumstances, how can it be said that the payment of British income tax has precedence over the Persian Government’s 6 per cent, royalty which must compensate the Government’s Exchequer loss for the non-collection of the usual taxes ? The Persian Government naturally sees no objection to the Imperial Bank of Persia paying any amount it likes out of its profits to any person or authority it chooses, but this prerogative cannot cause a diminution of'the undoubted rights of the Persian Government. Bank's Arguments. (3) The fact that royalty payable to the Persian Government has been debited to the profit and loss account before providing for British income tax, cannot be taken as evidence of the bank’s interpretation of the meaning of “ net profits ” mentioned in the concession. The said procedure was adopted by arrangement with the British income tax authorities. Besides, the practice of another company which also holds a concession in Persia cannot affect the subject in dispute. Refutation of above Arguments. Admittedly, the said facts were cited only as secondary evidence, and it is true that by themselves they are not sufficient to prove the Persian Government’s contention. The other questions, however, are amply sufficient to prove the justice of the Pei sian Exchequer s claim, in favour of which the followm 0, argument mav also be added :— J It is entirely contrary to logic that taxes payable in Persia should be subject to an increase or decrease in taxation in another country, for in this manner it will be sufficient for the latter country to raise its taxation two or three times in order that as a result the Persian Government’s dues may sustain a very considerable7 * i« n„. &gt; 77/2 S/S/J^ -7f&gt;J ) —«&lt;?/ to any ptnon by mime, but to —7 V^/ and address The Un^ex-Secretary of State,” Foreig/ Office, Lonj/on, S.W. 1 .

Mr. Dodd to the Marquess of Reading.—{Received October 2.) (No. 526. Most Confidential.) i , ^ So , My Lord, Tehran, September 23, 1931. WITH reference to my telegram No. 204 of the 16th instant, I have the honour to transmit to your Lordship herewith, a translation of the letter addressed by the Minister of Finance to the acting chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 13th September, recording the bank's appointment as the Persian Government's agent for the purchase of exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. No other bank is to share this privilege, apparently. 2. The press has referred to a decree of the Council of Ministers embodying this decision, but the text of the decree itself has not been published, nor has Mr. Butters received a copy of it. The latter, however, does not think that it would be politic to press the matter, as the Government doubtless wish to give it as little publicity as possible, whilst the Minister of Finance's letter gives the bank the guarantee and rights it has been craving for. 3. Mr. Butters, in my opinion, deserves the greatest credit for having brought his negotiations to a successful issue. He has throughout shown an experienced intuition of the most suitable line of approach, and a fund of tact and patience, and the results which he has obtained show what success can be obtained by the display of these qualities in the direction of the bank’s affairs. 4. All the exporters’ exchange bought by the Imperial Bank will be held at the disposal of the Government, and the bank is to make regular statements of such purchases to the Treasury-General, as indicated in Taghi Zadeh's letter. It is only to this extent that the bank has agreed to “ place itself under the control of the Persian Government ' (see your Lordship’s despatch No. 509 of the 7th September), and this it has been willing to do from the very beginning. Mr. Wilkinson's letter to the Minister of Finance of the 20th April, a copy of which formed Enclosure {c) to Sir Robert Clive's despatch No. 224 of the 6th May last, gave a definite undertaking to that effect. It is, therefore, a mere excuse on the part of the Government for the delay in according to the Imperial Bank a privilege to which it was clearly entitled under the agreement of the 13th May, 1930, to profess that the bank has hitherto declined to accept the measure of official control required of it. 5.

[E 4323/847/34] Mr. Dodd to Mr. A. Henderson.—{Received August 20.) (No. 430.) Sir, . Gulhek, August 12, 1931. WITH reference to my telegrams Nos. 177 and 178 of to-day's date, I have the honour to transmit to you herewith a copy of the letter which Mr. Butters, who is acting as chief manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia during Mr. Wilkinson’s absence on leave, received from the Minister of Finance on the 5th August. Mr. Butters brought this letter round to me and told me that he proposed to send a mere acknowledgment in return, mentioning that he had sent a copy to the board and myself. I expressed the opinion that the challenge to the veracity of Sir Hugh Barnes’s statement called for an immediate reply, and I suggested to Mr. Butters that he might like to think the matter over and, if he wished, consult me as to the terms of the reply he should send Taghi Zadeh. He subsequently called, on the 7th August, and we together drafted what we considered a suitable answer, which I gathered Mr. Butters would send Taghi Zadeh, with perhaps one or two minor amendments. 2. Written as it was two days after Mr. Lascelles’s interview with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Taghi Zadeh’s letter was presumably intended to make it clear to the bank that the Government in no way abandoned their uncom promising attitude. The latter, moreover, has been made public by an article in the “ Iran ” (copy attachedf 1 )), which has been evidently inspired by the Minister of Court. The second part of this article, it will be noted, deals with an article on Persian currency problems which Mr. Rogers, a director of the bank, contributed to the “ Times,” and in which he made use of terms which could not fail to irritate the Persian Government. 3. Mr. Butters himself, although he has been instructed to insist on the recognition of patent rights of the bank in the matter, is not unduly disturbed by the Government’s behaviour. In the first place, he is positive that the National Bank are not in a position to buy exporters’ exchange, and that, if any were to be had, the Government would have to have recourse to the Imperial Bank, which alone could afford to lock up capital in this way. Secondly, he is equally positive that the Persian Government are about to ask his bank to delay the withdrawal of their note issue once more. The fact is, however, that as long as there is no exporters’ exchange for the National Bank to buy, the Government are not likely to realise how difficult tfie situation would be were it forthcoming and only the National Bank authorised to purchase. Moreover, there is a verv important question of principle at stake which should, if possible, be settled before any bargaining takes place on the question of the note issue. It would, indeed, be extremely bad policy to allow the Persian Government a bargaining counter, which they would certainly not possess had they honoured their engagements. 4. The above considerations lead me to suggest, with all due diffidence, that the time has come when a strongly-worded note should be addressed to the Persian Government, stating in unequivocal terms the very serious view which His Majesty’s Government take of the violation of the spirit of the agreement arrived at on the 13th May of last year. I have, &amp;c. CHARLES DODD. Postscript.—V have only learnt this morning, after this despatch had been typed, that Mr. Butters, on second thoughts, decided not to send Taghi Zadeh a written reply to his letter. He has asked Teymourtache for an interview; he has had what he describes as another friendly conversation with Taghi Zadeh, and seems to be satisfied that he is making satisfactory progress. I shall be glad to have your authority to address a note to the Persian Government as suggested, but do not propose to take any action without first consulting Mr. Butters. C. D. ( x ) Not printed.Enclosure in No. 1. Persian Minister of Finance to Mr. Butters, Imperial Bank of Persia. (Personal.) My dear Mr. Butters, Tehran, August 4, 1931. AS you are well aware, by virtue of the supplement to the Trade Monopoly Law of the 20th Esfand, 1309, a “ reglement ” was instituted by the Imperial^ Persian Government appointing the National Bank of Persia as the sole agent of the Government for purchase of the exchange sold by the exporters. On the 20th April, 1931, the Imperial Bank of Persia addressed a letter to the Ministry of Finance protesting against this exclusive agency of the National Bank and claiming the appointment contrary to the spirit of the agreement concluded in May 1930. The bank did specially refer to the letter written to her in May 1931 by his Highness the Prime Minister. By my letter dated the 2nd May, 1931, I clearly refused to agree to the argument advanced by the bank, and by stronger arguments refuted the claim of the Imperial Bank to any right of equality in this or similar matters with the -*■ National Bank of Persia, pointing out in the clearest manner that “there was absolutely no place to raise any question of principle.” I informed the bank, however, that “ the question of how a solution could be found so as to give the bank the possible facilities and satisfaction and reach an eventual arrangement by which the Government might extend to the bank the desired facilities in this question and the bank give the necessary guarantees and promise of assistance to the Government was under consideration.” Reference to my above-mentioned letter will make this whole matter quite clear to you. Tou will note that we did not in the least recognise any right for the Imperial Bank of Persia in its claim, but that, on the contrary, we rejected same entirely. If the Government took the matter under consideration, it was on their own choice and solely in order to do, if possible, a mere favour to the Imperial Bank of Persia, but in no wise because her claim was thought to have any foundation. Though no formal decision in the matter is yet reached by the Government which might lead to an amendment of the “reglement,” I thought 1 could give, during an interview with Mr. Wilkinson, to his repeated representations and his request for answer, an optimistic reply, giving him hope of an arrangement and referring him to the Ministry of Economy to take part in the drafting of the would-be amended project of the “reglement,” in anticipation of the hoped-for decision of the Government. I should say, however, that statements such as that made recently by Sir Hugh Barnes, chairman of the Imperial Bank of Persia, on the occasion of the forty-second ordinary general meeting of the bank (topic, “ Foreign Trade Monopoly,” last paragraph), statement which, you will readily admit, is quite inconsistent with the facts and misleading, do not seem to be of nature to induce the Council of Ministers to take a very favourable decision. Sir High Barnes pretended that “ the Persian Government, as might be expected, admitted that a mistake had been made and undertook that the regulation would be amended.” Would it not have been much better if the chairman had stated the facts as they were and as they stand now, and not have told his audience publicly things which not only are entirely erroneous, but also certainly not meant to draw the Persian Government’s special favour toward the Imperial Bank of Persia in the matter ? Having been quite surprised to read that part of the speech, I thought to write you these personal lines in the hope that you will understand and take it as a friendly notice meant to call your attention to the possible effect of such utterances in the opposite direction. Yours very truly,, S. H. TAQIZADEH.N f British Legation No* 465 G-ulhek (E 4549/847/54) 25th August, 1951 Sir With reference to my telegram No. 185 of the 18th instant. I have the honour to inform you that the Minister of Finance asked the Acting Chief Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia on the 15th whether the hank would delay the withdrawal of its notes until March 21st next, unless the Government happened to be in a position to introduce the new note issue sooner, in which case the bank would be given two months notice. This notice, however, would not be given before November 1st so that the present notes would not begin to be withdrawn before January 1st at the earliest. Mr. Butters informed Taghi Zadeh that he would forward the Government^ request to his Board. The latter subsequently instructed him to convey to the Persian Government their readiness to meet their wishes and co-operate in every possible way, it being understood that the Imperial Bank would in return be granted the right to purchase exporters’ exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. 2 . Teymourtache let it be known to Mr. Butters that the commercial treaty he hoped to conclude with the Soviet Ambassador by the end of this month would probably contain a clause to the effect that the Soviet acknowledged themselves bound to purchase exchange from the authorized banks only. This would clear the way for giving the Imperial Bank the privilege it asked for and His Highness held out the likelihood that the monopoly regulations would be amended accordingly. He wanted, however, an exchange of letters in which the bank would recognize that The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P The Foreign Officeannoyance of government departments. Both the Belgian Treasurer-General and the German Manager of the National Bank have been to see Mr. Butters on the subject. Doctor Lindenblatt has gone so far as to promise the Imperial Bank his unstinted support in its negotiations with the Government if it agrees to issue another million tomans* worth of notes in co-operation with the National Bank. 5. Doctor Lindenblatt confided to Mr. Butters at the same time that he was extremely anxious about the whole question of the gold standard and the new currency. He stated that he was going to ask the Government to acquaint him with the exact measures they proposed to adopt to maintain the rial at par and he would resign without any hesitation if he judged them insufiicient. He was a poor man — in spite of his present salary of live thousand pounds per annum — and he could not afford to lose his reputation as a banker. If the rial followed the example of the kran he would be held partly responsible, to say the least, in banking circles, both in Germany and elsewhere. 6 . Teymourtache has promised Mr. Butters that he will settle the bank*s affairs before his departure to Europe on the 3rd or 4th of September and he will probably see Mr. Butters on August 26th. The latter is very sanguine of his ability to strike a bargain on purely practical lines, without raising the issue of principle, and I trust that his expectations may be realised. I have, etc., (Sgd.)

Monsieur Noury was reminded that on the 21st April it ha., been explained most frankly to him how serious a view liis Majesty*a Government took of the Persian Government’s action in this matter (see Mr. henderson’s telegram to ~ir R. Clive ho.M of the goth April). Monsieur Noury had subsequently stated that he had telegraphed what had parsed at the interview fully and accurately to his Government; and when, on the 12th May, the Persian Minister of Finance had informed the Manager of the Imperial Bank that the Monopoly Law Regulations would be amended so as to allow the Imperial Bank equal rights with the National Bank in exchange transactions, Monsieur Noury had attributed this apparently satisfactory settlement in large measure to the effect of his telegram. It had then been generally assumed that the whole question was finally settled. 8 . Monsieur Noury said that he had certainly been under the impression that the matter had been satisfactorily settled last May. he had been informed to that effect semi-off icially from Tehran, and he had noticed that the Persian Government C.L.o. Dodd Ksq., etc., etc., etc. had Tehran.had recently been paying salaries to net tuber a of the Ferulen Legation through the Imperial i*ank, which had confirmed hi a Impreaalon that all waa now well. 4. tfontleur Hor^yrwab then given the euhatance of paregraphe 1 and 5 of your telegram *;o#177 of the 12th August, and tiurprlM* and dl&amp;&gt;eppolntment were expreo^ed at the fact that, In spite of all the i era!an Government* a asaur, ncea, nothing had yet be^n done, &lt;nd that the position wae now exactly the aame as it waa in »pril« It had been supposed three monthe ago that, partly as a result of the frank a diecueelon with Monsieur Noury on the felet April, at ioaat one difficulty had been removed, and that Anglo*terelan relatione were, to that extent at least, in a lese un^atiefactory position# hut how, it wae asked, could any improvement ever b© reached If queetlons which had been regarded as settled months ago were re-opened in this manner, and if such categorical aasurancea ae had been received from the i’erai&amp;n Government proved long afterward* to have meant nothing? The situation could only be regarded aa profoundly disappointing and it was hoped that the »eroian Government would again be informed what a serious view hie AiaOeety f fc Government took of their attitude. b.

Under the circumstances the relevant passage in speech of Bank Chairman at annual meeting was inconsistent with the facts and misleading.

Please see the instructions (on P.Z.4965/31) sent to Tehran in the light of the Cabinet decision that we should endeavour to secure an extension of the permission for Imperial Airways to use the South Persian route in return for the reopening of the Duzdap Railway. / The telegram from the Charge d f Affaires at Tehran now submitted records a general discussion with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in v/hich this question was covered. It will be seen that in addition to the Duzdap Railway and the extension of Imperial Airways’ concession discussions took place on the draft agreement to regulate the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department from Persia, and on the Persian failure to implement thei] formal promises to place the Imperial Bank of Persia in a position to deal in exporters’ exchange on the same terms as the National Bank. The present submission does not comment in detail on these questions. Suffice it to say that Mr. Lascelles appears to have dealt with both entirely satisfactorily. The important section of the telegram is Pt.II, which deals with the Duzdap Railway. Mr. Lascelles might perhaps have been wiser not to emphasise the decrease of trade consequent on the monopoly law. But in general he seems to have handled the question exceedingly well, and Sir Denys Bray, who has seen the papers, agrees as to this. The Foreign Office telephone that they propose, subject to our concurrence, to telegraph formally ; approving Mr. Lascelles's language, and I submit that we may concur in this. His handling of the situation is the more creditable as he is an officer of very short service,We cannot yet feel optimistic as to the prospects of securing an extension of the Airways concession in return for the Duzdap Railway. But at any rate we have made it clear to the Persians that we are prepared to consider reopening only on a business basis and in return for some quid pro quo . Mr. Lascelles’s representations will in any case go a long way towards clearing the air. As he remarks, the result of our demarche 'depends on real importance of Duzdap to the Persian Government'.

I expressed astonishment and quoted the Prime Minister’s letter of May 13th,1930. ne argued with obvious embarrassment that monopoly law had created a new situation. I retorted that the whole poino of this as of other international agreements was to provide security against an otherwise uncertain future B as ^ t ^ e ^P^rial Bank of Persia continued to be handicapped His Majesty’s Government could hardly avoid conclusion that no agreement with Persia would provjde security.

He spoke of their economic difficult ies and consequent necessity for special measures, and even suggested that it was impossible for them to afford the Imperial Bank of Persia the same treatment as the National Bank without having to extend it also to the Russians. It was explained in reply that this last suggestion had no relation whatever to the facts. Imperial Bank was a State Bank under its concession, and the Persian Government last May had definite^ undertaken to accord it equality of treatment with the National Bank. There was no Russian or any other bank which could possibly be regarded as coming within the same category. His Majesty's Government were fully aware of Persia's economic difficulties, but these did not justify a violation of the Persian Government's agreement with the Imperial Bank of Persia. -0-0-0 - O'O -0- Perslan Chargd d'Affaires called on April 21st to furnish explanations of his Government regarding their measures against Imperial Bank of Persia.

Whatever the Persian Government might say about desiring good relations with His Majesty’s Government, in no single instance had they given the slightest indication of such a desire. On the other hand, difficulties were continually arising, and the present incident could be regarded as the culmination of these difficulties. His Majesty T s Government had for years been trying to improve Anglo-Persian relations, tut their efforts could not be successful unless the Persian Government on their side adopted a similar friendly attitude e Chargd d'Affaires repeated that he was not informed of details, and said he would report to * hie Government the sense of the language held to him.

But this was immediately followed by the further and more serious breach of faith reported in Tehran telegram No.72 of 15th April (on P.Z.2341/31 flagged) which led to vigorous official remonstrance by the Minister. Sir Robert Clive's complaint produced sufficient effect to lead to explanations by the Persian Charge / d'Affaires to the Foreign Office (see Foreign Office telegram of 25th April No. 61). The Foreign Office took the opportunity to indicate our general view of the unfriendly attitude of the Persian Government and to impress on Nouri that we could not accept their justification in the matter of the Imperial Bank. Matters rest at that point, and it will be seen from the Minister's telegram No. 87 of 25th April that while our attitude has disturbed the Persian Government, they have so far done nothing to meet the Bank's legitimate grievance. We need have no hesitation in concurring in the Minister's suggestion that he may be authorised to protest at his discretion if the Persian Government x decline to give way. x F.O. after d.o. consultation with this Department are telegraphing today approving, but v/aming the Minister that, pending closer investigation here, his protest ih made, should be on the general ground that the Persian action is inconsistent with the spirit of the agreement.

Following notice is published this morning by hiinistry of National Economies. M As mentioned in Article 11 of Regulations relat ing to foreign trade monopoly lav/ only National Bank is authorised by Government to purchase exchange resulting from export of goods. M I have seen Director of Imperial Bank of Persia and in our opinion this constitutes flagrant breach of agreement made by Bank with Persian Government last May - see my despatch No.221 May 15th and especially the letter to the Bank from the Pxlme Minister.* I have requested interview with Minister for foreign Affairs and shall tell him that I have reported to you as follows; in my opinion the Persian Government appear to be pursuing a deliberate anti-British policy, that this latest action is most flagrant breach of faith in my experience and I have definite impression that Fersian Government are trying to make the position of Imperial Bank of Persia impossible. Letter from Director of Bank to Minister of Court on March 29th and to Minister of Finance on April 6th requesting informa tion on rumoured intentions of Persian Government have simply been ignored, exactly as Minister of Court ignored and has net yet replied to my letter on the 2341 &lt;J93! subject2 . subject of the Treaty. In these circumstances to pursue negotiations for Treaty of Conraerce and general xreaty vhlch includes Treaty of Friendship is a mockery. -nder the Trade Monopoly Law foreign trade is being paralysed and it would be senseless to continue Commercial Treaty negotiations whilst deliberately unfriendly atmosphere is being created Which would render equally useless negotiations for a General Treaty. In fact I can only conclude with the greatest regret that policy of conciliation and friendship pursued by His Majesty's Government for the past ten years appears to have failed.

Tehran, May 15, 1930. WITH reference to my recent telegrams ending with my telegram No. 128 of the 14th May, on the subject of the negotiations between the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Persian Government, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of an additional appendix (No. 5) to the bank’s concession, which was. signed on the 13th May by the Prime Minister, in his capacity of Minister of’ Finance, and Messrs. Rogers and M ilkinson, on behalf of the Imperial Bank. 2. It will be seen from this document that the bank gives up its right of note issue and in return is to receive on the 20th March next the sum of £200,000 sterling in cash. At the same time the bank will cease to pay the 6 per cent, royalty on its net profits and will be exempted from the control of the Persian high commissioner of the bank. 3. In addition to this appendix, the bank received a letter (Enclosure 2) signed by the Prime Minister in regard to the question of’ their future collaboration with the Government and with the National Bank, and in regard to the latter point a memorandum (Enclosure 3) is attached to this letter setting forth certain details m regard to this collaboration. I understand that the method by which this is to be done is at present under discussion between the two banks. The main thing is that the Imperial Bank is placed on an equality with the National Bank for ordinary banking business. 4. The settlement embodied in the documents signed by the Prime Minister was negotiated entirely with the Minister of Court, who merely informed the Council of Ministers what he had arranged. Although I consider they have parted with their note issue cheaply, I am convinced that the bank were right in coming to a settlement. The negotiations were conducted in a friendly atmosphere, and it was an excellent thing that the board decided to send out Mr. Rogers. It is too much to hope that Mr. Wilkinson and Dr. Lindenblatt will establish cordial relations, but I trust that their future relations may be correct. 5. The news of the renunciation by the bank of their right of note issue has been received by the Persian press, instigated no doubt by the Minister of Court, with paeans of joy. It is represented as a great triumph fur the Government. It is also admitted that without the right of note issue the Government’s Gold Standard Law must have been rendered inoperative. It is satisfactory, however, that these articles conclude on a more friendly note towards the Imperial Bank and that the conciliatory attitude of the bank is commended. Satisfaction is also expressed at the arrangement concluded (although this has not been published) between the Imperial Bank and the National Bank with regard to future collaboration between these two institutions. The leading article in the “ Iran ” concludes by saying that the general attitude of the Imperial Bank will gain the sympathy of everyone in Persia. 6. It is of course far too early to surmise what will be the practical effect of this arrangement, but there is no doubt whatever that the Persian Government have obtained the renunciation by the bank of their sole right of note issue at a very cheap price, and, unless the Imperial Bank can regain the preponderance of exchange business, it would seem inevitable that there will be in the future a very considerable drop in their profits. I am hopeful, however, that if the Imperial Bank will only profit by the lessons of the past eighteen months, they may yet maintain their position as the leading bank in Persia. There is no doubt that the board of the bank have for some years past been far too conservative in their policy—I might even say reactionary—and, if it is not presumptuous on my part to express an opinion on the constitution of the board, I am convinced that the introduction of a little new blood could only be an advantage. Since the abolition of the so-called Capitulations in 1928 the wave of Persian nationalism has been spreading. I am the first to admit that this is less a genuine expression of national feeling than an artificially fostered growth, but nationalism is being preached in the army and in the press, and due allowance will have to be made for this by all commercial institutions doing business in Persia.
