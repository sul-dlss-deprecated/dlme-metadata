We had already despatched the Drainpipes for shipment by the last steamer from Manchester, but unfortunately this steamer was carrying so much cargo that our drainpipes were shut out. We trust, however, that they will go forward by the opportunity mentioned above, and that they will arrive in good time for your requirements. Yours faithfully, DOULTON &amp; CO., LIMITED. per -'0-'L L&gt; BAHRAIN GOVERNMENT ELECTRIC SUPPLY DEPT. D.O. Dated: Bahrain. 11th May, 1938 11th R/Awal,1357 Dear Weightman, Re your artesian well - I enclose some readings from which you will see that a good natural head is maintained throughout the twenty-four hours, the biggest difference being about 3i rt only. There may be a bigger difference during spring and neap tides, etc., but I do nbt think we have anything to worry about, unless the well opens out at the junction of the casing and the rock stratum, at some later date. From a test taken at about noon to-day the well produced 1490 gallons of water in ten minutes. Yours sincerely, I IS H.Wei^htman, Esqr., H.B.ivi’s Political Agent, Bahrain.C 0 P Y May, lCth.,1938.

The State Engineer^ Government of Bahrain, Bahrain Government Electric ^4- Supply Department, State engineer f s Office, Bahrain, Persian Gulf, Arab BY AIR MAIL QUOTATION Our Ref: G/W Your Ref: GL/18/57. Dear Sir, We are in receipt of your letter of the 3rd inst., but fear that we are unable to ascertain the B.T.U’s in your fuel from the information you hvve given us. We donot see any reason why it should have a bad effect on our fire bars. In our exnerience sulphur is the worst enemy we come across in fuel for affecting our Boilers and Fittings, Are we correct in assuming the taps you refer to are the ordinary kind for Domestic Supply, and 1 not for bathf, as if they are for baths, we usually allow 15 gallons per bath, whereas for ordinary taps we allow 4 gallons. If these are 12 ordinary taps, we think you will find that our'AX' Closed Type DOMESTIC Boiler will be large enough, though if the demand is likely to be heavy, perhaps it would be better to put in a 'CX'. As, however, you prefer a Boiler on which you can boil a kettle, we should suggest your using either a' C.O.F.or Q.O.F.Open Fire type, and we have pleasure in enclosing herewith an estimate for these Boilers, together with Shipping Specification. ^ We may say that our Boilers are constructed to burn coal, coke or anthracite, etc., and they are quite satisfactory with these fuels. Your order will be esteemed, and shall have our best attention. Yours faithfully, For THE BEESTON BOILER CO.LTD. DIRECTORCL 0 P Y b. Vi estimate. May 10th,1938.
