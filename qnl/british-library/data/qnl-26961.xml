Holidays.—-The Birthday of H. M. King George V was celebrated as usual at all British Consulates in East Persia. RectiMtiiwis were well attended. 2. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad .— The arrest of Idu Khan, together with his brother Lashkar Khan and the former’s two sons caused a considerable stir in the Sarhad. They were later sent to Tehran. It is doubtful whether the Persians will be able to maintain order in the Sarhad with out the benefit of Idu Khan’s assistance. Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk is concealed in the Mashkel hills. All troops have been withdrawn from the Remishk area as the heat renders further operations impossible. Yawar Iskandar Khan, brother-in-law of the former G. 0. C. (Mohammed Khan) who has long been under suspicion on a charge of embezzlement, is believed to have been acquitted by a Military Court at Khwash, and has left for Tehran to receive posting orders. On the other hand, as is usual in such cases, two junior officers, Sultan Mohammed Khan late Cantonment Commandant Zahidan, and Naib Moham med Khan, Storekeeper at Khwash, have both been made scapegoats and convicted in this case. Havildar Karimzadeh who was in charge of the Military Police at Zahidan, but was transferred to Khwash about 10 months ago was brought back under arrest, and is being sent to Meshed to undergo 18 months’ imprisonment. His own story is that, on being transferred to Khwash, he wrote privately to an Indian member of the staff of our Vice-Consulate at Zahidan asking him to arrange trans port for his family from Zahidan to Zabul. The latter replied that he would take ad vantage of the first lorry available. This letter fell into the hands of the authorities and the Havildar was charged under Section 67 of the Military Law. “ Communicat- jng with Foreigners ”. 3. Military—25% Conscripts left Zabul for Zahidan at the end of May, and a further 300 followed early in June. 250 have been given leave preparatory to transfer to Khwash. These conscripts are marched to Zahi dan, a severe test for newly conscripted men. Of the batch last sent two are reported to have died of fatigue and thirst en route. The garrison at Birjand is to be considerably augmented and new barracks are being constructed. Conscripts on leave are being called in. Naib Masnur Khan, Wireless Officer, left Kwash for Tehran on the 4th June with the field wireless set; which has been in use during the operations against Remishk. 4. Persian Officials.—Doctor Zahidi, the highly inefficient and drink-sodden Municipal Doctor of Zabul has been trans ferred to Kuchan and has been relieved by Hassan Majad, a former dispenser in the American Mission Hospital at Tehran. Bahrami, former Head Clerk of the Revenue Department at Zabul, who was returned to that place to stand trial for embezzlement, has been acquitted as was anticipated. His superior, the late Reis-i- Malieh, who made a considerable fortune at Zabul in the course of two or three years, is being tried at Tehran. As all evidence has been suppressed in the case of Bahrami, his Chief will, no doubt, equally escape punishment. Faridi, Inspector of the Court of Dewan- i-Jaza Tehran, arrived at Zahidan recently to examine the books of certain firms, viz.:- \ / o Indians. N. A. Mullick Hafiz Mahmud Hashim Illahi Baksh Shuraka . . J-Persian Firms. Rozzakoff . • J as it was reported to Tehran that Shahidi failed to examine them last year. He demanded the removal of the local Governor Abdul Shahu Amin, whom he suspected of collusion with Shahidi, the Public Prosecutor, who enquired into the smuggling cases last year. The Assistant Governor at Kain has been suspended on a charge of accepting bribes, together with other officials, from persons liable to conscription. In spite ENCLOSURE IN 5 REIGN SECftFTAr'WS ; .128 •\o t / v :' 1333r r of payment of bribes the unfortunate individuals did not escape conscription. Dishonesty among officials ^ in East Persia has reached a state which is said by all to far surpass anything experienced before the present regime. In former times petty officials were in some fear of local persons of importance, but the latter now have no influence, and the great distance from Tehran enables them to deal dishonestly with the Public almost with impunity. It is true that, sooner or later nearly every official is “ tried ”, as the results of complaints, often made anonymously to Tehran, but a conviction is extremely rare. The tremendous increase of ‘ Regulations in almost every Government Department, provides ever increasing opportunities for Officials to squeeze the populace. Dis content is very noticeably on the increase for sooner or later nobody escapes the depredations of these avaricious officials, all of whom dislike service out of the big cities and are solely concerned in amassing money to enable them to return to Tehran. Signs are not wanting of discontent in the Army—hitherto the privileged class— for the lower ranks are beginning to suffer financially at the hands of their superiors 5. Foreign Travellers.—The following arrived at Zahidan on the 1st June from Tehran. 1. Rudolf Sedlacek .. Czecho-Slovak. 2. Uternul 3. Ruttner Czecho-Slovak. Austrian. Nos. 2 and 3 who had obtained visas at Tehran and Messina respectively left for India on the 7th June and No. 1 who had been refused a visa also left for India on the 9th June and has presumably been dealt with at the frontier. Amis Effendi, Baghdadi, said to be Editor of an Iraq newspaper arrived at Zahidan from Kabul via India on the 1st June and proceeded to Iraq via Tehran. Franz Rosenthal, German, said to be a mechanic arrived at Zahidan en route for India on the 26th June. He was reported by H. M’s. Vice-Consul to be desti tute, but being in possession of a valid visa could not be stopped. Two Russian refugees named Borodin with their families arrived at Birjand recently. Gustav Stratil Sauer—German—arrived at Zabul on 1st June and stayed till the 5th. He announced that he was a Professor of Geography of Leipzig University and was engaged in writing an economic geography of Persia. He passed through Birjand on the 12th June en route Meshed and Tehran. 6. Customs and Excise Department .— The opium yield at Darmian near Birjand has regularly for many years been returned as about 40 mands. This year the estimate was 140 Mands ; which even so is well below the real amount. The inhabitants have bribed the local officials to make a revised estimate. In Sistan the Revenue Department is reported to have collected the Revenue for the past year in full. A hitherto un is nown occurrence. 150 Camel Sowars are being enlisted in Sistan for a Special Customs Preventive Force. One military Naib and a regular N. C. 0. are in charge. On the principle 0 f—“ get a thief, etc.,”—most of the men engaged were formerly smugglers. They f are to be paid Tomans 16 per mensem which includes Tomans 5 allowance for maintenance of their mounts. 7. Miscellaneous .—Work on the Lutak- Qila Rustam section of the new Zabul Zahidan road continues, but is handicap ped owing to the difficulty of supplying water to the labourers engaged. The Sheila (a depression between Girdi and Hormuk on the above road) is flooded, and although rafts have been constructed the water is insufficiently deep to allow the passage of motor traffic. It is for this depression that tenders for an iron bridge have been asked for by the Persian authorities at Tehran from the British Legation. Five boxes of silver were sent through Zahidan to India in June. They had been consigned from London by K. R. Mehrabji, Import and Export Merchant, 11 Wormwood Street, London. The boxes were declared at Qasr-i-Shirin as “ in Transit ’ to India. The representative of a Calcutta firm has recently arrived in East Persia to negotiate the import of Russian Diesel Engine oil by this route. The fact that there is no customs control on this frontier is now becoming increas ingly known and exploited. On 25th June a Road Guard entered the house of one Mahtab Singh, Indian Broker at Zahidan and took away 1,000 LKrans in silver which he was counting at the time, alleging that the money was intended eventually to be smuggled into ^ndia. A further report is awaited from fcs Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Zahidan. C. K, DALY, Major, His Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Persian Baluchistan. —At the end of April Idu Khan- and his brother Lashkar Khan were arrested by the G. 0. C. The real reason is not known but the G. 0. C. announced that the latter had concealed 15 rifles. Idu was also charged with the responsi bility for refusal of Sardar Ja-Hind (Jiand) Khan Yarmohomadzai, to return to Persia. Later Dad Khuda, Idu’s son, was arrested. The monthly Sardari allowance paid to Idu Khan (the continuance of these allow ances was one of the ‘conditions under which the Sarhad was restored to the Persians after British occupation) has been transferred to Mir Mohammad Kurd. The G. 0. C. promised the Keki Sardars that Idu would be released if he surrendered the 15 rifles he is alleged to have, and it is believed that he did so, claiming that they had been given him by the last G. 0. C. for Levy duties. About May 20th it was reported that Idu was charged with acting as a British Agent, a charge which is without any foundation. He receives a Jagir of Rupees 600 yearly from Baluchistan authorities in respect of his services in the Levies before and during British occupation of the Sarhad. His son Dad Khuda, after being beaten admitted that Idu had 10 rifles given him by Sartip Mahomed Khan for Levy duties. A further 8 rifles were then demanded. The last report received was to the effect that both Idu and his son were being sent under arrest to Tehran. In view of his services to the Persians, without, which they would not have been able to subdue Persian Baluchistan, the treatment meted out to him is unduly severe, if the only proved charge is that of concealing a few rifles. He was the right-hand-man of the last G. 0. C. (Mohamed Khan) but from the moment of the arrival of his successor, fell into disfavour. As is so common in Persia the new G. 0. C. proceeded to reverse the policy of his predecessor. Sardar Abdul Hussain with followers and their families have left Rems’hk and gone to the Mashkat hills near Charbar. . ENCLOSUrtt IN' NDIA FOREIGN 3ECRF • ah v'b i Utter 11^0 1 6 JUL 1933 _ The Kerman troops were still camped in the Bashakad hills early in May, while some of the Baluchistan Brigade were withdrawn to Sarbaz to effect the arrest of one Malik Beg Baluchi, who has been committing dacoities. 2. Sistan. —The Reis-i-Malieh, Zabul, proceeded to Tehran to put forward a scheme for the employment of some trained Indian agriculturists in Sistan, to run experimental farms for the education of the peasants. It is believed he will propose that | the good offices of His Majesty’s Legation 1 and the Government of India be sought to I enable a few selected officials of the Indian I Agricultural Department to be deputed for f a fixed term. In view of the very unsatis factory manner in which foreign employees of the Persian Government Departments are invariably treated, the loan of any Govern ment officials would be unsatisfactory— particularly in Sistan, where the local Persian Officials are singularly corrupt and irresponsible. Private individuals would be well advised to have a very definite contract with salary fixed in rupees. Mohamed Khan Hadi, late Governor, Zabul, who had proceeded on leave to Meshed, has since been transferred to Kuchan. No relief has yet been appointed. The G. 0. C. in Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad visited Zabul from 1st to 3rd May to discuss with the Frontier Commis sary (Sarhang Mukri) measures to combat smuggling. Dr. Zahidi, Municipal Doctor at Zabul, is transferred to Kuchan. Smuggling from Afghanistan to Sistan has decreased owing to the difficulties of negotiating the journey, large areas being flooded. Several bridges on the new Zabul- Zahidan road (not yet open to traffic) collapsed during recent floods owing to being built of bad material. A serai at Zabul has been converted into , a hospital for opium smokers. Some 200 addicts have been confined in the serai under Police guard. The period of deten- | tion under treatment is to be four weeks. Members of one batch already released, are reported to be improved in health. It remains to be seen whether the experiment will have any lasting results.3. Foreign Travellers .— IX. r ' Name. Gustav Stratil Sauer and wife. Nationality.

Municipalities.—A report from Zahi dan states that the Persian Government has authorised the sale to traders at Zahidan of state land on which their houses and shops exist—the price to be fixed by a local Com mission. Further details have been called a portion of the proceeds and is under arrest. One Randa Mai, Indian shopkeeper of Zahidan, sent 2,000 Rials to his shop at Chamarg on the Kerman road, for purchase of ghee which he sells at Zahidan. Levies at Chamarg suspecting this coin to be smuggled, seized it and took it to the Belgian Customs Director at Zahidan. The latter confiscated the coin, imprisoned the Indian in the Customs for a time and inflict ed a fine of 4,000 Rials. He was made to sign documents in Persian which he did not understand and which appear to be a ‘ confession ’. The case is being made the subject of a separate despatch as it appears to be a flagrant miscarriage of justice. The lorry of one Sandar Dass was searched at Mirjawa and Rials 12,000 in coin were discovered in a petrol tin. Cases of genuine smuggling are unfortunately so common that the innocent {vide case of Randa Mai above) frequently suffer with the guilty. 7. Afghan Affairs. —^Muhamad Samim Khan, Chief of Police of Kandahar in the Amanullah regime, arrived at Zahidan from Tehran on the 13th and returned on the 15th. He apparently went there to meet a nephew and niece who were expected from Peshawar. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Persian Baluchistan. 1. Reference last part of paragraph I of the Diary for March 1933. The Provincial Director of Posts and Tele graph denies that he sent any men to inter fere with the Boundary Pillars near Robat. He states, however, that he has orders to collect the telegraph poles originally erect ed by the British on the Robat-Koh-Malik- Siah route, but that no poles will be touch ed which are in British territory. Some fighting is reported to have taken place with the recalcitrant Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk. Three of the Sardar’s tribesmen were recently executed at Khwash. A report has been received that Ayub Khan, brother of Nowsherwan, who was with Ali Mohammad in Mekran, recently attempted to raid near Bakhshan. Troops were des patched to effect his capture but he fled, presumably re-entering British territory. Sardar Lashkar Khan, Gumshadzai, who was recently ordered by the General Officer Commanding to surrender a further 20 rifles, failed to return to Khwash. He attacked a Kafileh in British Maskel and looted 7 camels. The owner of the camels has applied to Idu Khan at Khwash for assistance, but the latter has been unable to induce Lashkar Khan to return the animals. Persian Officials. 2. Abdul Hussain Meftah, Persian Pass port Officer, Quetta, accompanied by his English wife, left Zahidan en route Quetta on the 29th March. Mohammed Khan Hadi, Governor of Sistan, proceeded on leave to Meshed on April 4th. The Chief of the Police is Acting-Gover nor. It seems unlikely that Hadi will return to Sistan. Agha Parwaresh, the Official in Charge of the distribution of lands in Sistan pro ceeded to Tehran on the 25th April. Opium. 3. The worst cases amongst the opium smokers in the town of Zabul have been collected in a serai and placed under medical surveillance. The cultivation of opium has been pro hibited in Sistan, but as large stocks exist, and it is readily obtainable from Afgha nistan and Kain, no immediate improve ment can be expected. Smuggling. 4. The flow of silver coin to India con- j tinues. In an effort to stop coin being brought south to Zahidan, Customs check ing posts have been established at Sar- besheh and Birjand. All lorries are examined for concealed silver, on the south ward journey, and for smuggled goods on the northward trip. The petty Officials 'in charge of these posts cause lorry drivers considerable trouble, unless pecuniary gratification is forthcoming. The shortage of silver coin in the Bazaars causes much inconvenience. Trade and Agriculture. 5. The export of ghee (clarified butter) from Sistan recently, the only local product which could be profitably exported, has been prohibited, presumably in the interests of the peasants. The price fell as the result of this action. At the moment nothing seems too trivial to escape the attention of the authorities in their eagerness to develop Sistan and to encourage the cultivators who have received the parcels of land recently distributed. Whether this is in the interests of the peasants or of the State Treasury remains to be seen. The majority of the ignorant peasants have no idea as to the terms on which they hold the land. The terms have not, in fact, been made clear to anybody. British Travellers. 6. Mr. Evelyn Wood and his wife, of Ralli Bros., Bombay, arrived at Zahidan from India on the 31st March. After much delay attempting to repair the decrepit Ford car in which they arrived, the machine was eventually abandoned and the journey to Europe continued by hired vehicles. Foreign Travellers. 7. Messrs. Haworth and Brewster, Ameri cans, arrived at Zahidan from India on 2nd April and proceeded to Iraq via Tehran. Afghan Affairs. 8. A reputable traveller from rferat, states that there is a strong rumour there that ez-King Amanullah is in Bokhara and ENCLGSUR u, INDIA FOREIGN itCnOMK Li/Uar •'iu v.3j o ?2 HiN.-’2 that it is believed that the Soviet authori ties intend to appoint him Amir of Bokhara. The rumour is presumably spread by anti- Nadir propagandists. At Birjand extensions to ‘ Permits de Sejour ’ are not being given to Afghans, on the ground that they are engaged in smuggling. The chief smugglers, however, are in league with the Police and are not naolested. Moharram. 9. Instructions were received by the Police to prohibit processions and to confine all demonstrations to the limits of the Mosques. These instructions were received only after all preparations for the usual r processions had been made, and on advice of the local authorities they were not enforced. The period of intensive mourning passed without untoward incidents. C. K. DALY, Major, C. I.

Persian Baluchistan. —Abdul Hussain ‘of Kemishk continues to give trouble to tbe Military Authorities. He hides in the hills by day and cannot be located, making raids against isolated posts by night. His family have been sent to British territory. Sartip Abbas Khan proceeded to Iran- sheher on March 6th to arrange a concerted drive in the hills, in conjunction with Kerman troops. Should this fail, and up to now no reports of any decisive action have been received, it is improbable that further operations can be undertaken until next winter. Baluchis attacked an Amnieh post consisting of four men, near the British Mekran frontier. The gendarmes were severely beaten and their rifles stolen. The Baluchis escaped and cannot be traced. Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai visited the G. 0. C. at Kwash and endeavoured to obtain permission for his brother, Ahmad Khan, who emigrated to Afghanistan, to return to Persia. The matter has been referred to Tehran. The G. 0. C. has despatched Habibullah Khan Reki to British Mashkel to endeavour to induce Jahind Khan, Yarmuhammadzai to return to Persian territory. From a subsequent report it appears that the mission failed to achieve its object. It is reported that a Persian telegraph linesman was recently sent to Robat Bevy post with instructions to destroy the boundary pillars in the vicinity of the post. He was prevented by the Levy Havildar in charge. 2. Judicial. —The Zahidan-Zabul Peace Court moved from Zahidan to Zabul during the month. The British Indian subjects who were recently sentenced in Tehran for smuggling have appealed and have been permitted to return to Zahidan, on bail, pending the hearing of their appeal. Orders have at last been received for the Peace Court to remain permanently at Zabul and for the establishment of a separate Court for Zahidan. 3. Persian Holidays. —H. I. M. The Shah’s Birthday was celebrated at Zahidan by a reception to which H. M. Vice-Consul and staff were invited. At Zabul a ceremony was performed by the troops. Foreign Consuls were not invited. The customary official calls were P ald ■on local Governors at Zabul and Zahidan on the occasion of the New Year (Persian) 4.

Should this prove impossible Tutins (Reed rafts) will have to be employed as was the case in 1929. The new road which is under construction is on an alignment which is not liable to inundation. 5. Government Trade Monopoly. —A large quantity of loaf sugar has been purchased by the Persian Government in Belgium. It is anticipated that 200 tons will reach Nokkundi in April and a further 400 tons in May. Indian traders who had been anticipating a revival of this trade in which they secured a handsome profit, in the past, as middlemen, are therefore once more disappointed. The sugar will be stocked in Zahidan and sold through specially appointed agents. This importation is partly due to the failure of the Russians to import sufficient sugar and partly as an effort to flood the markets in an endeavour to discourage smuggling. As however the Persian Government will doubtless endeavour to recover at least the full normal customs duty it is uncertain whether the latter object will be achieved. Still further restrictions on the freedom of trade are being resorted to in an endea vour to check the wholesale smuggling. All persons who bring goods into Zabul from the villages near the frontier are now required to produce a £ permit ’ from the nearest frontier customs post and similarly no goods are allowed to be taken out to the villages without a permit from Zabul. At Birjand a special customs checking post has been established and the contents of all lorries proceeding up-country are examined and Customs , ‘ Passeavant certificates called for. In spite of these pre cautions the villages all along the frontier from the sea-coast to Meshed are fully stocked with smuggled tea, sugar and cloth and consequently legitimate trade in the towns is at a standstill. 6. Revenue Department. —This Depart ment has now discovered what was com monly known a year agr—that Baigan the late Reis-i-Malieh had taken a huge amount in bribes. It is probable that official cognisance of this would not have been taken, but for the fact that it is now certain that he also embezzled government funds. The two clerks (brothers) who were in charge of the accounts are being prosecuted. The Department has notified the public that all amounts illegally collected by Baigan will be recovered from him and remitted from Revenue due. As a result practically every cultivator i n feistan district has submitted a claim. tJ2 7. In preparation for the re-distribution of land in Bistan, the cultivation of opium was prohibited last autumn. A. certain amount was however cultivated in gardens which did not fall within the scheme. This has now been destroyed by order of the Revenue Department and for the time being no poppies are being cultivated. Two Government experimental gardens are now being prepared—one at Imamieh, near Bunjar village and the other at Deh Dost Muhammad. The latter village is to have a telegraph office and a school in the near future. 8. Control of Opium Addicts .—At a conservative estimate 80 per cent, of the population of Sistan is addicted to the opium habit. The recent redistribution of lands has, however, drawn the attention of the authorities to the large number of men who are totally unfit to work. This has led to the restriction of cultivation of poppies as mentioned above. The Excise Department sells opium at Zabul at Tomans 34 per seer (l/3rd of a lb.). Smuggled opium, brought from Afghanistan is available at Ts. 24 per seer. During the month some two thousand opium smokers were collected by the Gendarmerie. It was proposed to deport them to Khorassan, but instructions were received that they were not to be ^sent elsewhere. On the occasion of the Id, they were permitted to t '-turn to their homes, but were warned that they would again be collected. No further action has as yet been taken. It is reported that a plan is under preparation for the formation of a ‘ Colony’ in the neighbourhood of Qileh Rustum—a derilict fort in a desolate stretch of the Zabul-Zahidan road. Wells are to be dug and mud huts erected. The inmates will be under the supervision of a medical officer and will be required to work, in return for their food, on the con struction of the new road. The temporary release of these destitute and besotten creatures is probably intended to afford them an opportunity to escape across the border into Afghanistan from the fate in store for them. 9. Persian Officials. —Zainul Abidin Muntazami—Persian—has relieved Herr Bchnorr as Manager of the local branch of the National Bank at Zahidan. He opened business somewhat inauspiciously by virtually defrauding a Consulate clerk of ten tomans, when he was cashing a cheque. Two vaccinators have arrived in Sistan and are vaccinating the inhabitants of the villages. Sarhang Mukri, Frontier Commissary, has been ill for some months. He has been cured by our Medical Officer. There are indications both at Zabul and Zahidan of an attempt of the higher MC90FD—18—29-5-33—GIPS officials to be more friendly. The approach has been so forced and simultaneous and the professions of affection for the British and dislike of the Russians so fervid, that one is led to the conclusion that a hint must have been received from higher quarters to adopt a conciliatory attitude. It will be interesting to note whether any such change of attitude has been detected elsewhere in Persia. 10. Municipality. —The Zabul Munici pality initiated a tax of two Krans per package entering the town by lorry, camel or donkey transport. This was indeed the last straw, and villagers practically ceased to bring in even perishable supplies. The tax produced insufficient to pay the wages of the tax-collectorate and has been abandoned. The Revenue Department has received a credit of Tomans 1,000 for the construc tion of masonry water-channels in the town. On all sides there are definite indications that the Shah’s determination to develop Sistan is to be given effect to, when and as, funds become available. 11. British Travellers. —Lieutenants Clive and Coates, on leave, arrived at Zahidan on 15th March and visited Zabul from 16th—24th, leaving on the latter date for Meshed. Foreign Travellers. —Master Boris Frank, Pole and Master Aranoff, RussfcA, both from Meshed, proceeded to Nanital on 9th for study. 12. Afghan Affairs. —In spite of recent articles in the Press designed to encourage a ‘ rapprochement ’ between the Afghan and Persians, relations do not seem to be improving. Both at Zahidan and Zabul the Police have declined to renew the Residency Permits of Afghan subjects and have warned them to leave the country, and threatened forcible deportation in the event of the order being disobeyed. Afghans at Zahidan have refused to comply with these verbal instructions and have demanded that the order to quit Persia be given them in writing. To this the police have demurred. Reports from Meshed indicate that the Persians are deliberately delaying the issue of Permits to Afghans and are raising difficulties over the recognition, as Afghan subjects of Berberis, hitherto so recognised. As this baiting of the Afghans seems to be applied universally in East Persia it may be assumed that it is part of a settled policy dictated by Tehran. C. K.

His Majesty's Consular Officers .— ^ Captain Taylor, assumed charge as Vice-Consul, Zabul, on February 4th. He was accompanied by Mrs. Taylor and family. Captain Beausang, I.M.S., proceeded on transfer to Quetta. 2. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .— Information regarding the operations against Abdul Hussain is obscure. Early in the month a report was current that troops from Rodbar and Iransheher made a night assault but were unsuccessful. The son and nephew of Abdul Hussain are reported as killed. Sardar Saidi and his brother Nawab of Kharram are reported to have quarrelled, as a result of which the former killed the latter. The Nawab is said to have favoured surrender to the Persians rather than to assist Abdul Hussain. Sardar Saidi has now definitely joined the insurgents. 3. ‘ Elections ’ in Baluchistan. —The G. 0. C. sent for Idu Khan and Habibullah Khan and said one of them was to stand to be ‘ elected ’ for the Majlis. Both declined and eventua , one Qiam, Shirazi, a person of obscure origin was duly ‘ elected ’ to represent Baluchistan. 4. Persian Officials. —Buhi, one of the officials of the Ministry of Justice who was deputed last year to enquire into the Zahidan smuggling cases has arrived in Zahidan. His mission is kept secret, but it is believed that, as a result of reports to Tehran, he is endeavouring to collect evidence against the Governor, suspected of accepting bribes. An Inspector of the Monopoly Depart ment arrived at Zahidan at the beginning of the month and is engaged in checking ‘ prohibited ’ articles in possession of traders, which are to be confiscated and sold by the Government after Nauroz (20th March). The post of Civil Governor in Baluchistan, created last year, has been abolished and the ez-Governor is leaving for Tehran. A Health Officer has been appointed at Khwash and Giri Garibian, Armenian, has been sent there in that capacity. Afsher, Head of the Roads Dept, in East Persia visited Sistan for a week to inspect the new road construction. Agha Shora, Peace Court Judge of Zahidan and Zabul, returned to Zabul on the 14th February. The existence of only one court for Zahidan and Zabul still causes most severe hardship. Witnesses are dragged to and fro between the two places and cases linger on intermin ably. An Accounts Officer of the Customs Department visited Zabul for a week to inspect Customs Office accounts. Herr Sohnorr, Manager of the Zabul Branch of the National Bank is to be transferred. His relief—a Persian—has arrived. 5. Malik Mahomed Khan, one of the leading Sardars, who had been called to^Tehran and detaine^ there, but was subsequently released, arrived in Zabul on 1st February. The distribution of the land hitherto farmed by Sardars is proceeding. A plan is on foot to start 2,000 gardens in Sistan. A number of plots have been distributed to cultivators for the purpose and the Revenue Department ha&amp; brought a few gardeners from Yezd and elsewhere to instruct the peasants. Date palm seeds are being distributed free. Work has started on plots in the vicinity of the town. The village of Bunjar is to have a school and municipality. In an attempt to stop smuggling the National Bank issues no coin, as it was used to pay for goods smuggled from Afghanistan, whereas notes are not accepted by the smugglers. As the five Rial note is the smallest obtainable the poorer inhabitants are put to great difficulty, for shopkeepers have no change and will sell nothing for less than 5 Rials. Market produce, such as eggs, butter, etc., cannot be readily sold by villagers for the same reason. The ‘ Tax Sanitaire 5 of 9 Rials per traveller which had been imposed at Mirjawa has been abolished,, doubtless as the result of representations made by our Legation, on behalf of motor drivers plying for hire on the route, who had to pay every time they passed Mirjawa.

It is interesting to note, that, according to an article in the newspaper “ Koshish ” that nothing was proved against Arbab Mehdi, the leading Persian trader, who had smuggled on a large scale for years, as was well known. He is reported to have engaged a pleader for Ts. 30,000. Some of which rtioney found its way to influential quarters. It was the fact that Mehdi smuggled, with connivance of the Customs Officials, and could undersell other traders, that practically compelled the latter to follow suit. 7. Foreign Travellers. —Aris H. Moure, Armenian, who had entered India without a passport and was put back over the frontier by the Baluchistan authorities was again put back over the border into Baluchistan by the Persians. His nationality is not established. His Majesty’s Consul has some grounds for suspecting him to be an individual whom he came across during the war, and has asked for photo|s to be supplied by the Baluchistan authorities. Doctors of Medicine, Witold Winniaz and Jolef Wielawsili Poles, arrived from Kerman on 5th and proceeded to India. ' Lazar Fink, Pole, Bailway Engineer, employed in China, left for India on 7th en route Hong-Kong. 8. British Travellers. —Lieutenant-Colonel E. W. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., Political Depart ment, of Government of India arrived at Zahidan on 7th February and proceeded to Meshed en route United Kingdom on leave. Mr. H. Chalmers, an Official of the E. I. Bailway, arrived from India on 14th and proceeded, on foot, to the United Kingdom. His reason for traversing this inhospitable region on foot is not clear and cannot be a good one. Mr. Murray, Official of the North Western Bailway, Quetta, visited Zahidan from 14th to 19th February to inspect the railway pumping plant which has been operating to supply the Vice-Consulate with water. 9 . Climatic. —Heavy rainfall at Zahidan and Zabul towards the end of the month, rendered the Zahidan-Zabul road impassable for motor traffic for several days. C. K.

H. B. M’s. Consular Officers .—Captain A. C. Galloway relieved Captain L. A. G. Pinhey as Vice Consul at Zahidan on the 21st January. New Years Day was cele brated as usual at Sistan Consulate and the subordinate Vice Consulates. 2. Sistan and Qainat. —The distributicn of land continues in Sistan. No land is given to those addicted to opium. As probably 75% of the local population is so addicted only the obviously hopeless cases are included in this category. Conscripts are being given land and can employ labourers to work it. Land is given for gardens either to men or women who apply and the Revenue Department is issuing seeds for Almonds and pistachio as an experiment. Sardars who formerly owned the land surrounding several villages are being given one small village each producing about 180 Kharvars of grain. After deducting the revenue amounting to 40 Kharvars there will remain 140 Kharvars which at present values represents an income of 700 Tomans per annum or 60 Tomans a month. This is, of course, a totally inadequate income for the Sardars to maintain even a very small establishment. Samsam Ud Dowleh is being given no land at all, it being asserted that “ he has other sources of income ”. Opium smokers are once more being dismissed from Government services. This procedure is adopted every few years, but they succeed in re-engaging themselves. Coins are being withdrawn from circulation by the Bank and notes issued. This has still further . adversely affected trade, as the people are suspicious of notes and will not take them as ‘ change ’. Meanwhile silver is being smuggled over the borders of Afghanistan to India where they can be disposed of at Rials 5/6 per Rupee as against the local rate of Rials 7*50/8. Legally imported sugar is not obtainable in Sistan, but smuggled sugar can be had anywhere. The nominal bazaar rate for loaf sugar is Rials 14 per loaf while contraband sells at Krans 8/9. i ENCLOSURE IN ;a FOREIGN sectary's The beggars of Zabul have been gathered in for the winter and are given a minimum of food and old clothing. Sardar Malik Mohamed Khan, Brother-in-Law of Shaukat U1 Mulk has at length been released from custody in Tehran and has reached Khwash from whence he is coming to Sistan, and has been allowed to retain his principal villao'e Jhalabad. 3. Persian Departments — Amnieh .—Sartip Azizullah Khan, Chief of the Gendarmerie inspected at Zabul from 28th/30th Jan uary. Justice .—The Chief of Gendarmerie reported urgently to Tehran that a separate court was required for Zabul. He has also suggested that as Amnieh are now required to serve summonses on persons living in the districts, a fee should be charged for service. Municipality. —The town is no longer lighted by electricity, although the Power House still functions for private consumers of current. The Municipality have not paid for lights for over a year. The Governor is reported as anxious to lease the Power House privately and to sell current to the Municipality, when, no doubt, arrears due would be promptly paid. Military .—Naib Sarhang Mahmud Khan, of the Ministry of War proceeded to Khwash early in January to check the accounts with Sujan Singh, British Subject, who is owed a large sum by the Military Department. A curious rumour was current at Zahidan and Zabul to the effect that Amanullah Mirza, late Officer Commanding the Eastern Army, had been appointed Minister of Court in place of Teymourtache. Such an appointment was wholly unlikely and it is curious how it found currency. 4. Foreign Travellers. —Leone Arpea, Italian, proceeded to India on 7th January, en route Indo China. Koroly Zettner, Hungarian, who entered India without a visa and reached Karachi, was returned to the border by the Indian authorities and reached Zahidan on the12th. He proceeded to Tehran on the 14th alleging that he would obtain a visa from our Legation. 5. Miscellaneous .—Traffic between Meshad and Zahidan has suffered delay owing to damage to the road by spate. Tomans 20,000 have been allocated till the end of the present Persian Year for the construction of the new Zahidan-Zabul road and the earthwork is progressing. Stone is to be brought by lorry from Koh-i-Kwajah. It is stated that 300,000 Tomans will be voted for this road next year. It really appears that this road is to be tackled in earnest at last. When the full scheme of linking Zabul via Baring with Shusp is completed, Zabul will be withm an easy days motoring of Birjand and two days of Meshad. India and Tehran only. 6. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad. The Kerman troops are still camped at Bodbar. Three hundred camel sowars sent from Khwash have not proceeded beyond Iranshehr. Abdul Hussain is reported to have looted another caravan. The majority of the Baluchis of Sarbaz have joined him. The Kerman troops willy^ probably return to Headquarters after the 15th February, as the heat then becomes intense. If this be so, Abdul Hussain will remain at large and be a centre of unrest for at least another year. C. K. DALY, Major C.I.E., His Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Major Stevens, Secretary, Meshed, left for India, via Zahidan on 6th Decem ber, on relief by Major Hamber. Captain Pinhey rejoined at Zahidan on expiry of his leave. 2. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad. —A preliminary attack was made on Remishk early in December, but troops returned to Kahnu, near Rudbar, having suffered 20 casualties. As a result 200 Camelry from Khwash, who were to have joined the Kerman troops, were detained at Iranshahar. Sardars Saidi and the Nawab of Ali-i- Kharran left their homes early in the month. It is believed they have joined forces with Abdul Hussain. It is believed that three columns will advance on Remishk. The Kerman troops from Rudbar, Bandar Abbas garrison from Chamber and the Balu chistan Brigade from Dizzak and Jalk. Meanwhile provisions are being collected at these points. 3. $ is tan a?id Kainot. —The month passed quietly in Sistan in spite of rumours of impending trouble over the land division. At Birjand the elections resulted in Munsiff, brother-in-law of Shaukat-ul- Mu 1 k being returned as a member for Kain with over 90 per cent, of the votes. He appears to have celebrated the occasion by selling arms to an Afghan gun-runner, doubtless feeling he will not require them in Tehran. All the Persian Customs Officials and traders of Zahidan who were in Police custody in connection with the Zahidan smuggling cases, have been sent to Tehran ; other traders, both Indian and Persian, who were on bail, have also been ordered to Tehran. It is rumoured that Shahidi, the Public Prosecutor who conducted the enquiry into the smuggling, has been arrested in Tehran on accusation of accepting bribes from various traders. Information is said to have been ENCLOSURt if* INDIA FOREIGN ’ j ' No 20 9'^.m lodged ^ against him by Badri, a clerk of Zahidan who committed suicide in October last. Afsher, Head of the Road Deptt. in f East Persia arrived at Zahidan early in | December. He has orders to repair the | Railway and Railway Building as far as I Mirjawa. Abdul Hussan Miftah, Persian Pass port Officer at Quetta, accompanied by his English wife, left Zahidan for Tehran on the 7th, on three months’ leave. 4. Russian Activities. —Two members of the ‘ Sharq ’ and * Pursaznaft ’ organisation visited Zahidan on the 6th December. Several hundred tins of Russian petrol and 100 tins of lerosine have recently been sent to Zahidan and a Selling agent has been appointed. The Russian s have therefore now penetrated i far south of Birjand which has hitherto been regarded as the limit, beyond which they could not compete with British trade. 5. Foreign Travellers. —Mr. and Mrs. Bose, Americans, left Zahidan for Kerman on the 10th. Master Boris Aranoff, Russian, and Master Boris Prank, Pole, both of whom are students arrived at Zahidan from India on the 14th and left for Meshed. Herr H. Blenck, German National, accompanied by Frau Erva Dorver, left Zahidan for India on the 14th December. They are travelling to demonstrate the “ Baby ” Ford car. Koroly Zetener, Hungarian, is reported to have left Zahidan lor India on 19th December. The Police at Kundi report that his passport bore only the “ Visa Applied For ” stamp, given at Tehran on the 18th November J932. Baluchistan authorities have been communicated with in regard to this. It is not clear how the man passed j our control at Kileh Lafid. 6. Miscellaneous .—The mail service &gt; between Meshed and Zahidan has been interrupted by snow in the hills. Hisam-ud-Dowieh, Governor of Bir jand, has been granted 8 months ’ leave, for next spring and intends to travel in Syria and Europe. Letter DatedA large number of thefts have taken place at Birjand during the past two years. One Ali Bahlavi has long been sus pected by the Police and was recently arrested. “ He ” was then discovered to be a woman. This person “ married about a year ago, and the “ wife is said to have been an able confederate. A decided state of anxiety is apparent in regard to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s matter and public opinion appears, to be that the “ rejoicings ” were premature. A slight earthquake shock was felt at Birjand on the 20th December, about noon ; no material damage was done. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and K ain.

Pinhey has proceeded to India on one month’s leave and Captain J. Beausang from Zabul is temporarily officiating at Zahidan His Britannic Majesty’s Consul re turned to Meshad from Birjand on the 15th November. 2. .Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— It appears that towards the end of October about 200 rifles and some ammunition were brought in a dhow to Chahbar by Baluchis, and were seized by the Persian Officer Commanding. Two rumours are current in this respect:— (1) That the arms were purchased in Bombay; and (2) That they were transferred at sea from a foreign vessel. Troops from Kerman are said to have advanced to Bemishk together with 200 Camelry from the Baluchistan Brigade, but up till the end of November no fighting had taken place. Sardar Abdul Hussain attacked a caravan early in tne month and looted 400 sheep, killing the military escort of four men who accompanied the cara van. The Yarmuhommadzais who had migrated to British Mashkel have now returned to their homes with the excep tion of Jiand Khan and Lashkar Khan I (Gumshadzai). There is evidence of ill- feeling between the G. O. 0. and Mirza Hassan Khan Badee, who was recently appointed Civil Governor. The mother of the late Dost Mohamed Khan has left Shastu and has joined her husband Ali Mohamad in Panjgur. 3. Sultan Khan Bar Khan, Canton ment Magistrate at Zahidan, has been transferred to Khwash. It is believed that the transfer is the result of repre sentations made by His Majesty’s Legation in regard to his high-handed treatment of a British Indian motor driver. Two guns which had been sent to Tehran for repair were recently returned to Khwash. Naib Mansur Khan arrived at Zahidan from Tehran about the 20th November and proceeded to Khwash in charge of a portable wireless set. This officer has acveryiRbad reputation for ill-treating ' FOREIGN SECRETARY'S } ! - ' -) F 1 ] M. j British subjects and was severely ad monished by the G. O. C. in 1930, as a result of complaints made by His Majesty’s Consul. He owes a sum of money to the Army and Navy Stores, Bombay, for goods purchased, which we have long been endeavouring to recover. On November 1st a fire occurred in the magazine at Khwash, all the ammunition exploded and four soldiers were burnt. The cause of the fire has not been discovered. Sarhang Nasrullah Khan and Staff arrived from Tehran on 11th November at Khwash to inspect the Brigade accounts. This party will again check the accounts of two Indian traders Sujjan Singh and Mehr Singh, who are owed Tomans 30,900 and Tomans 1,000 respectively by the Military authorities. 4. Smuggling at Zahidan. —Kashawar, a Customs Official, and a Clerk of a Persian firm at Zahidan who had been charged with smuggling and released on bail, have been arrested. Several of the smuggling cases investigated by the Special Public Prosecutor sent from Tehran in the summer, and which were referred to Tehran Courts have been again referred to the Peace Court at Zahidan for disposal. Several British Indians who had previously confessed to falsification of accounts and bribery of Customs Officials now intend to alter their state ments on the ground that they were made under threats by the Public Prosecutor. Akali Narain Singh, British Indian \ subject, who was early in 1932, sus- / pec ted of smuggling 10,000 Krans in silver out of Persia, and the motor driver Bawa Nanak Singh in whose lorry the coin was detected, have both been arrested and sent to Tehran for trial. Abdul Aziz Khan, the Customs Direc tor at Zahidan at the time, and Chet Singh, an Indian merchant, who is alleged to have bribed him on Narain Singh’s behalf have also been arrested. About November 20th one Assa Singh, British Indian, left Zahidan for India in a lorry driven by Munawar Singh. He had in his possession 930 Krans. He evaded the Customs Barrier #GIPD 638(Cy F&amp;PD-31 12-S3-1S at Mirja'wa and went on foot to Qila Safid, where he awaited the lorry which was being examined at the frontier. Meanwhile, another Indian called Jai Singh laid information with the Customs Officials. The latter sent three officials to a point two miles past Qila Safid (in British territory). They stopped the • lorry and endeavoured to arrest Assa Singh. Munawar Singh and two other drivers, who were at the spot, Antar Singh and Mohtab Singh, expostulated and informed the Levy Havildar at Qila Safid. Assa Singh was then released, but on the return of the three drivers to Mirjawa they were arrested and sent to Zahidan. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul has pro tested to the local Governor and a further report is awaited. 5. Sistan and Kain. —Difficulties are being experienced by the Officials in their efforts to distribute lands among the peasants. In the Miankhangi Dis trict large numbers have refused to cultivate the land allotted to them and there is a continual flow of emigration to Afghanistan. Several of the leading Sardars are being pressed to pay arrears of Revenue (amounting to very large sums and dating from several years back). They are without doubt unable to pay the huge sums demanded and some of them refuse to visit the Malieh Officer for discussion. His Majesty’s Consul has been in formed from a reliable source that Mohamed Khan Hadi, the Governor recently appointed to Zabul, is likely to be transfered very shortly. There seems some likelihood that Samsam Ud Dowleh or his brother Hisam Ud , Dowleh (now Governor of Kain) will be offered the appointment. There are unconfirmed rumours that a Commission is to be appointed to determine the lands which are to be allotted to the Sardars and that Shaukat U1 Mulk will be Chief Commis sioner. Up till November 15th, the latter certainly had no information on the subject, but it is not impossible that the Government would use his influence to arrive at a settlement which would be acceptable to the Sardars and which he alone could probably effect. 6. Persian Customs.—The Customs at Mirjawa are now collecting a sum of Krans 9 on each inward and outward passenger, which is alleged to be a tax authorised by the Central Authorities to raise funds to establish a quarantine station at the frontier. 7. Persian Officials. —Mirza Shams- Ud-Din Haqqi has assumed charge of the post of Chief of Police, Zahidan. The Revenue Officer, ZaDul, visited Zahidan during the month to inspect accounts 8. Foreign Travellers. —A. K. Shaha, , an Indian who has been some years employed in Moscow, together with his Russian born wife passed through | Zahidan on 9th November en route to India. Madame Tauba Suba Kagan, origin ally Russian, now a naturalised British j subject, proceeded to India from Zahidan on 16th November. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.

DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.CONFIDENTIAL. a Drt!- His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and Kain, Diary lor the month of October 1932. 1. Consular Officers .—Captain Beau- sang, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice- Consul, Zabul, proceeded to Zahidan early in October, in his capacity as Medical Officer, owing to a case of serious illness in the family of His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Zahidan. He subsequently remained to act for Cap tain Pinhey during the latter’s absence on short leave. His Britannic Majesty’s Consul arrived at Birjand on tour from Meshed on the 12th October. 2. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .— Reports have been received from Tehran to the effect that Sartip Muhammad Khan, late Military Governor in the Sarhad is to stand trial in Tehran on charges of selling arms confiscated from the tribes and of embezzlement. His successor in Baluchistan who at first gave indications of undue severity towards the tribes, is now reported to take little interest in affairs other than purely Military and to be consequently increasing in popularity. On the other hand there are indications that order is not likely to be so well maintained as under his predecessor. 3. Sistan and the Qainat. —Informa tion has been received that the long •threatened distribution among the peasantry of the lands occupied by the Sardars, has at last commenced. Lands occupied by Hisam-ud-Dowleh (Governor of Birjand and nephew of Shaukat-uI-Mulk) are being so divided and doubtless the turn of the less im portant Sardars will follow. This is believed to be a direct result of H. I. M. The Shah’s vistit to Sistan. On that occasion the Sardars were urged by the Frontier. Political Officer, Sarhang Murteza Khan Mukri, to make as fine a display as possible. Consequently macy of the Sardars sent to great distances, to Afghanistan, Baluchistan, etc., to borrow camels and equipment to make an impressive * Show ’. The results were in fact so impressive that the Shah took this as an indication of martial strength which he determined to undermine. The dis missal of the hereditary Governor, Samsam-ud-Dowleh and the imprison ment and banishment to Tehran of Malik Mohd. Khan, the most influential Sardar and close relative of Shaukat- ul-Mulk was followed by an invitation to Shaukat to visit Tehran where he has under various pretexts been delayed the whole of summer, meanwhile the division of the lands of his nephew has commenced. The Sardars are not united and as a result of several years of bad markets for their agricultural produce, are im poverished and are not likely to make any dangerous disturbances. On the other hand the greatest discontent is evident and the situation is being ex ploited by the Afghans. Afghan fcistan is well watered and fertile but lacks cultivators. The Afghan Government have recent ly paid considerable attention to the development of this area—resulting in the Helmand water dispute. Most of the Persian Sardars are related by marriage to the Afghans near the border. Recently the Afghans have been spread ing propaganda in Sistan promising financial assistance for six months, free grant of land, and exemption from taxation for two years to any Persian Sardars who desire to emigrate with their followers. That some Sardars will wish to take advantage of this situa tion seems likely, but their followers are liable to refuse to accompany them, since they would enjoy the division of their Master’s land in Persia. The outcjome of these measures is still obscure, but the disintegration of the tribal system seems to be not far distant. Sarhang Murteza Khan Mukri, Frontier Political Officer in Sistan, who has for a long time been under a cloud and could neither obtain orders from his superior, nor replies to his applica tions for leave, is now once again under the orders of the Military Commander in the Sarhad, who unlike Sartip Mohajnmed Khan, is a personal friend. News has been received that an official of the Afghan Foreign Office has recently arrived near the Frontier at Chakansur. His visit is believed to be in connection with the Helmand Water dispute. It is believed that negotiationswill be resumed. The Afghan Minister at Tehran who recently visited Kabul, has returned via Meshed and it is said will put forth proposals for an amicable settlement. The recent difficulties in regard to the boundary in Khorassan are said to have been amicably settled between the Minister and the local officials in Khorassan, on the former’s return. This may indicate either that a more conciliatory attitude is to be adopted towards Persia, in general, or that he has deliberately proved complaisant in the matter of the frontier diffictdties, and intends to obtain a quid pro quo in respect of the Helmand river, which is of greater importance to Afghanistan. Efforts are being made to encourage the export of wheat from Kain and Sistan to the famine-stricken areas in the South-East; but roads are in so deplorable condition that motor trans port is expensive and merchants are hesitating to commit themselves heavily, fearing that by the time consignments reach Kerman, etc., by animal transport, the situation may have changed, as there are rumours of relief measures, whereby grain may be extensively imported via the Gulf Ports. At the beginning of the month a new office was opened at Zabul designated “Reforms Revenue Office”, and 12 officials arrived to undertake the distribution of lands among the peasantry. The lands surrounding the Govern ment villages of Tuti, Khuzamak and in Miankhangi District were first dis tributed. This was followed by the distribution of the lands attached to Dadi village, hitherto owned by the Mutawalli Bashi of Meshad Shrine. At the end of the month land adjacent to Zabul town was being distributed. Agricultural land hitherto owned by the Sardars has not yet been distributed, but the Sardars have been told to select one of the several villages owned by each and that they will be permitted to farm the adjacent land, but that the remainder will be distributed. The only case in which the lands of an important Sardar have so far been selected for distribution is that of Hisam-ud-Dowleh, nephew of Shaukat- ul-Mulk. It is perhaps significant that shortly after he had intimated his willingness to relinquish all claims to such lands, his uncle, Shaukat-ul-Mulk, was permitted to leave Tehran for Birjand. The unit of distribution seems to be the area of land in which one Kharwar Sistan of grain can be sown which,is apparently some 13,000 square yards. Many of the leading Sardars have protested that the grant of the lands adjacent to one village will be insuffi cient to enable them to maintain their families and dependants and they are supported by the Mullahs, but are scarcely in a position to resist the orders of the Central Government. 4. Communications -—It is evident, that the development of Sistan is now seriously occupying the attention of the Government. Early in October the Officer-in-charge of Roads in East Persia accompanied by other officials visited Sistan. Accompanied by the Governor and Frontier Political Officer they pro ceeded to tour for the purpose of selecting a suitable re-alignment for the Zabul-Zahidan road. The route finally selected will run some distance to the East of the present road and will approximately follow the direct route of the Telegraph line. This will obviate the construction of a number of small bridges between Zabul and Lutak, but will necessitate bridges at Mohamad- abad and Karbasik. The following programme is said to have been determined upon. During the Persian year, 1311. —Con struction of the road from Zabul to Hermuk (at the .entrance to the hills on Zahidan-Meshad main road). This will include a bridge over the Shiela between the Girdi Chah and Hormuk. Persian year, Construction of road and bridges from Zabul to Shusp via Naizar and Lab-i-Baring (a route which was used by our troops during the war). On completion of this road the present Hormuk-Shusp road will not be maintained and all traffic between Meshad and Zahidan will pass via Zabul. Work was held up for some weeks owing to the refusal of the land- owners to contribute the share agreed upon by them on the grounds that their lands were being taken from them by Government and little advantage would accrue to them from the construction of the road. A grant of Ts. 7,000 from the Road Fund enabled the work to proceed andmaterials are being collected at Mohammadabad for the bridge to be constructed. - -r \ ^ 5. Irrigation in Sistan .—On October ^p6th Officials arrived at Sistan to advise | the peasants who are to receive allot ments of land, on the cleaning and construction of canalfe. They also propose to fix the amount of water tax to be paid and to draw up plans for the construction of a regulator at Karbasak. On October 27th they visited the Sistan Bund, on the Helmand lliver. 6. Health .—The Quarantine was removed at Mirjawa on October 25th. In spite of the fact that the season for cholera has long passed, the Municipal Doctor at Zabul has been carrying out enforced innoculations. The fact that he broke the needle of the syringe in the arm of a patient led to resistance to his progromme. The needle was extracted with considerable difficulty at the Consulate Hospital. 7. Persian Military Affairs .— Conse quent on the attempt to call up conscripts at Zabul some 490 families are reported to have fled from the Miankhangi District across the Afghan border to Chakansur. 12^, Persian soldiers deserted from Khwash at the end of the month. Two were arrested but the remainder are untraced and have probably succeeded in reaching British territory. 8. Afghan Affairs .—See paragraph 3 above regarding propaganda in Sistan. The emigration of 490 families to Chakansur mentioned in paragraph 7 has led to a small diplomatic storm. It appears that on arrival of these families the Persian Consul at Chakansur addressed them in stirring language, stating that Chakansur was once part of Persia and that with their help and of their brethren across the border would be regained for Persia. In return for services they would be given perpe tual exemption from Military Service. The Governor of Chakansur to whom this speech was reported took the matter up and a quarrel took place between him and the Persian Consul. The Prohtier Political Officer at Sistan has demanded, through the Afghan Consul, Zabul, that the Governor of Chakansur be dismissed for his discourtesy. The matter has / apparently been referred to Kabul by the Consul. 9. Elections to the Majliss .—It seems certain that Asadi has been re-elected for Sistan. In Birjand, Munsiff, Brother-in-Law of Shaukat-ul-Mulk is likely to be elected. This means the displacement of Shahzadeh Muttazaddi, who was originally returned as a result of Shaukat’s influence, but has appa rently not bestirred himself in his benefactors interests. It is rumoured that Asadi, Mutawalli Ba^hi of the Meshad Shrine (who was formerly head retainer in Shaukat’s family, but is now not well disposed towards him) has promised to secure a seat for Muttazaddi from Khorassan. 10. miscellaneous News .—Hussain Khan, son of the Governor of Birjand, who has lately returned from the Boyal Agricultural College at Cirencester, was recently offered an appointment as Agricultural Adviser in Sistan, where it is proposed to open a Government Parm for the instruction of the peasants. He has declined the appointment as he has not yet finished his College course, which requires him to carry out a year practical work before a Diploma can be granted. A Persian clerk at Zahidan who had been released on bail, being charged with complicity in smuggling, com mitted suicide on the 28th October. 10. One Ghulam Qasim, British Indian has been detected smuggling 1,000 Tomans in silver out of the country and is to be tried shortly. He is a well-known smuggler. Sarhang Haji Baqir Khan arrived at Birjand on the 24th October. He is to be Frontier Political Officer in Kain under the direction of the G. O. C., Meshad. The Frontier Political Officer in Sistan is now placed under the orders of the G. 0. C. in the Sarhad. 11. Foreign Travellers. —M.

Persian Baluchistan. —This area is nominally to be placed under a Civil Governor and Mirza Hassan Khan Badee has been appointed to the Governorate. It is anticipated that the Civil Governor will have little real power. Sardar Khudadad Khan and a number of the leading Baluch Sardars of Sistan pro ceeded to Khwash on a summons from the General Officer Commanding, who held an enquiry into the recent murder case at Sistan in which some of the Sardars were involved. They returned to Sistan on the 10th of September and have remained thejTE/ Abdid Hussain of Remishk continues to attack caravans. He has a good deal of support from other tribes. The only tribes on whom the General Officer Com manding, can rely are the Rekis in the Sarhad and the Sardars of Bampur, Iransheher, Mogis and Dowar Paneh. Unsuccessful efforts have been made to bring back the Yarmohamedzais and the Jamsbedzais who are in British Mashkel. The strength of the garrison at Khwash does not exceed 1,000 mostly conscripts, and the General Officer Commanding, considers the garrison insufficient to maintain peace in the Sarhad if active operations are also to be undertaken against Remishk. Ahmad Khan, brother of Juma Khan Ismailzai, who has emigrated to Afghan istan recently committed a raid into Persian territory near Galuga and cap tured a number of camels. Umar Khan, son of the late Dost Mahomed has married a daughter of Mohamed Shah of Sib and Suran, who was an enemy of Dost Mahomed. Qadi Baksh, who was recently appoint ed Governor of Sarbaz, recently fled to Khwash, his life being threatened by the Sarbazis. Ali Mahomed and Nausherwan, refu gees in Mekran, are reported to be in communication with the General Officer Commanding soliciting permission to return to their homes. 2. Sistan .—The local Governor recently assembled leading traders at Zabul and appealed to them to prevent smuggling. Active helpers to be rewarded by a recommendation to H. I. M. The Shah. run.'ail . C.U r»C i r. RY No 1 Some 400 men and their families entered Afghanistan from Miankhongi district to avoid conscription. The local officials have requested the Afghan Consul to demand their return and the matter is under reference to Kabul. 3. Army .—300 men from Miankhongi district were brought to Zabul on the 19th September to be enrolled as con scripts and a further 200 on the 21st September. One hundred and ten conscripts from Zabul passed through Zahedan for Khwash on the 1st September. Naib Ali Akbar of the Baluchistan Tip has been sent to Tehran under guard. He is implicated in the case proceed ing against Yawar Sikandar Khan. A deserter from the Persian Army recently surrendered to our levies at Juzzak. The barracks at Birjand are being extended and it is reported that th e strength is to be raised from one to two “ Gurdans 4. Persian Officials .—The Director General for Public Health has recently toured in East Persia. Appointments and transfers among the junior officers are so frequent that efficiency must be severely affected, and minor appoint ments are seldom held for more than a few months. This now appears to be the result of determined policy at Head quarters—possibly with a view to the prevention of cliques among officers. The Public Prosecutors having com pleted their enquiries into the irregulari ties of the Customs Department at Zahedan, were about to depart (taking with them in custody a number of customs officials) when one Illahi Baksh, an Indian trader who had fled to India returned. He was examined and con fessed to having obtained false import licences and to bribery of Customs Officials. He was then allowed to export goods which had been held up. Wazir Singh, who had givemsecurity for the appearance of Narain Singh, was released on payment of Rials 50,000 cash security. Dr. Seif, appointed Medical Officer to the Persian Legation at Kabul, passed through Zahedan on the 29th Septem ber. *■ 1 ^ ^ r ?3' r- 5*The Public Prosecutor paid as reward 200 Tomans to one Nichal Das and 150 to Ghulam Rasoul, for assistance in checking books of Indian traders and they have been promised 1/3 of any fines which may be inflicted. 5. Miscellaneous. — Zabul. —It is stated that Persians applying for passports to India are required to lodge 1,000 Tomans in the National Bank, which will be forfeited if they proceed to any other country. On 17th September 10 men from Kastan stated to ^&amp;e Agricultural Experts arrived at Zabul to advise local cultivators. Their salaries are to be recovered from landowners. The Sistan Sirdars who are at present in Z abed an (see para. 1) have been per suaded to purchase motor cars. Quarantine still exists at Mirjawa, although cholera is said to have died out in British Baluchistan. Local efforts are being made to have the restrictions removed. The fees have recently been reduced (on instructions from Tehran) to— Birjand. —A slight earthquake shock was felt on the 8th September—no seri ous damage resulted. The cotton crops are reported to be far below the average. Nearly all the officials of the Excise Depot have been sent to Tehran under guard accused of embezzlement. Foreign Travellers.— Scholber German Engineer arrived at Zahedan from India on 17th September and pro ceeded to Meshad in search of employ ment. M. Mauzi, French subject, left for India en route Siam on the 20th Septem ber. Mile. Vaiane, French subject dentist left for Siam via India on 20th Septem ber. H. Adolf Muller, dentist, accompanied by Frau. Margarete Siehemann left for India on 20th September. He intends to practice at Kabul and arrived at Zahedan from Tabriz. 1st Class 2nd Class 3rd Class Rials 12-50 per diem. 7-50 5 Mr. C. Hart, Extra Assistant to His Majesty’s Consul, who was detained there, reports that all arrangements are entirely inadequate. Those in quaran tine mixed freely with villagers, etc., from outside and sanfijjhry arrangements consisted solely of a pit in the ground. No disinfectants were in use and practi cally no cleaning of the quarters took place. H. J. Butler, American, accompanied by wife and 3 children arrived from Kerman and left for India on 20th Sep tember. 7. British Travellers. —Mr. C. Hart, Extra Assistant to His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan arrived at Zahedan from India on 20th September and proceeded to Camp Office at Meshed. Mr. F. W.

Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .—All the Baluch prisoners who were brought to Kwash from Remishk, nine in number, have now been shot. Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk con tinues to raid. The brother of one Sabuk, who recently killed a Persian soldier and cut the tele graph line near Karvandeh, was shot at Kwash early in August. The mother of the late Dost Mohamed Khan has returned to Dizzak. It is un derstood that the G. 0. C. informed her that the Persian Government would not permit Ali Mohammed or Kausherwan to retrun to Persia. Qadir Baksh, Kurd, who has been ap pointed Governor at Sarbaz, is very unpo pular with the local Baluchis. He recently applied to the G. 0. C. for assistance on the ground that the tribes were purchasing arms from different sources and comtemplated attacking his fort. 2. Frontier. —A rumour has been^ current in Kwash to the effect that the British in tend to vacate Bobat, Kacha and Saindak and to surrender that area to the Persians. 3. iSfofcm.—The authorities have been very active in attempting to stem the flood of contraband goods entering Sistan. A number of raids have been carried out against villages along the frontier a considerable quantity of goods have been found. The appointment of 75 special Amnieh Sowars has been sanctioned to be employed on preventive duties. No less than 49 arrests have been effected by the Military authorities of persons charg ed with smuggling who have been^kept m Military custody. Two rates rule m Zabul town—one for normal trade and one for contraband goods—e.y., sugar loaf official rate Rials 12 per loaf obtainable without difficulty at Rials 7. Cotton ‘ Shirting ’—open bazaar rate Rials 13 per Zar, ' Private ’ deals Rials 5. Smuggling is now so universal that it is doubtful if any measures can be contrived which will suppress it. Even the recent orders which are said to have been issued— that smugglers of certain articles are to be ENCLOSURE IN j INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S ] Letter No &gt;13® .1 j Dated 2''•SEP. 1932 dealt with by Military Courts and to suffer the death penalty—will not deter the border tribes who are interested in such lucra tive trade. A number of important Sardars of the Sistan area have proceeded to Kwash to interview the G. 0. C. in connection with the case in which one of their number is accused of murder. On 22nd August Amnieh from Sistan engaged a party of smugglers and a running fight took place. The smugglers escaped to Afghan territory. 4. Health. —Consequent on an outbreak of Cholera near Quetta, the Persians have established quarantine at Mir jawa. Travel lers both to and from India are subjected to inoculation, unless in possession of certificates of recent date. Mails were at first held up by the Health authorities, although they had no means whatever of disinfecting them. Subsequently mails were permitted to pass without delay. An unconfirmed report has just been re ceived of an outbreak of Typhoid in Kain town. 5. Qainat.—On receipt of the news at Birjand of the illness of Shaukat-ul-Mulk at Tehran, very wild rumours were circula ted to the effect that an attempt has been made on his life. 6 . Education .—Notice has been given that a new Government School is to be opened at Zabul. Arabic, Persian, and Military Drill are to be compulsory subjects for the scholars. At Birjand all teachers in the Primary Schools have been ordered to prqceed to Meshed for examination by the Khorasan Directorate of Education. One village school-master, who, by reason of being a Mullah, was exempted from wearing the National Headgear, was recently forced to adopt the ‘ Pahlevi ’ hat by the Inspector of Schools. He immediately sold his property and absconded to Afghanistan. 7. Military News.—Practically all the Sistan conscripts have now been sent to Kwash for service. Only 40 conscripts now remain. A small number of regular cavalry which remained at Zabul have been dis missed the service and replaced by cons-2 crint infantry. Yawar Nasratullah, who recently arrived in the Sarhad from Tehran, has been appointed 0. C., Zabuh Regimen , Iskander Khan who is still under arrest at Tehran. The post of “ Diwan-i-Harb ” has recent ly been created for the Baluchistan Brigade and Yawar Azizullah Khan recently O. 0., Camelry, has been promoted Naib Sarhang and given the appointment. Naib Sarhang Simla Nizam of the Baluchistan Brigade is under arrest on a charge or receiving bribes. This official was Reis Amnieh in East Persia in 1931. He was then appointed Military Governor, Zabul, for a short time, but was reverted to Military duty on com plaints of his venality. 8. Civil Officials —Dr. Amjed Karakol arrived at Kwash. He is civil Medical Officer. The Inspectors at Zahidan who have been ! engaged in tracing Customs frauds have completed their examination of the books of Indian traddb. The only serious case discovered appears to be one against Naram Singh An entry in his books is alleged to render him liable to a charge of smuggling silver out of the country. The Reis Mallieh, Zabul, is about to be transferred. This very lucrative post is seldom allowed to remain in the hands or any official for more than two years, by which time he may be said to have amassed a comfortable fortune. The Keis Sulhieh continues the highly unsatisfactory practice of travelling to and fro between Zahidan and Zabul witn the result that the cases at neither place can be completed in a resonable time. Consequent on a number of arrests for bribery almost all the junior officials in the Qainat have been replaced recently. 9. Communications. — Bricks are being made in large quantities at the ISaurab near Zabul for the construction of the bridge. An engineer is said to be due from Tehran to supervise the construction. Tenders have been called for for the construction of bri dges on the Zabul-Zahidan and Kabul-Deh Dost Mahomed roads. The Sardars have been called upon to supply free labour on these roads and also have undertaken to subscribe Tms. 7,000. The Headmen of Villages were called to the Malieh and informed that by the Shah’s orders roads were to be made forthwith and that they were required to pay Rials 2 upon each Kharvar of Wheat sold and cultiva tors were to pay Rials 7 per Pago. This frw a fav nf Rials one ner male head. 10 Law and Order.-TLe Amnieh both in gistan and the Qainat are frequently engaged in fracas with bands of smugg ers. The Assistant Amnieh Officer at Zabul'. , was recently ordered by the Chief Ammeh Officer for the Area to arrest his immediate superior Hussain Khan Amnieh Officer of Zabul On declining to do so he was arres ted bn the night of August X st he effect ed his escape from custody and fled to Afghanistan He fired upon Amnieh sent in his pursuit. Attempts are being made through the Afghan Consul, Zabul, for him to be extradited. A number of crimes of violence are re ported from outlying districts. T ey appear to be the direct outcome of the severe poverty of the masses. 11. Afghan Affairs.-The recently ap pointed Afghan Consul, Zabul, Gul Mahom ed Khan, has already applied for a. transfer on the grounds of severity of the climate. The Afghans are taking steps to repair and extend the Fort at Kang on the Aighan- Sistan border. It is reported that they have also started work on a road from Kandahar to Chakansur. 12. Miscellaneous .—Dissatisfaction has been’caused at Zabul by the National Bank the Manager of which institution has recently declined to give any proportion of coin but insists on Notes alone being ac cepted The Governor, Zabul, has noti fied that the pensions of any pensioners who are re-employed by Government will not, in future, be paid. A notice has also been published to the effect that Government will grant loans to Sardars on condition that they surrender their lands to Government. Presumably a sort of £ Mortgage ’ is meant. As an instance of the credulity of the in habitants of Sistan it has been freely stated in the bazaar that the Shah has decreed that in future an Aeroplane shall proceed from Tehran to Zabul weekly for the ex press purpose of conveying to him the peti- \ tions of the inhabitants. 13. Travellers.—One Mahomed Khan Tabasi, previously a clerk in the Russian Consulate at Sistan, arrived at Zabul from Moscow on 23rd August. One Khalil Khan, who described himself as an Iraqian from Baghdad, passed througn Zahidan in route Kwash on 4th August. He stated that he was a Schoolmaster on leave and intended to proceed via Bampur, Bam and Kerman to Bandar Abbas. Hie difficulty of this journey, combined with, fo/rt- fiiaf Pa s-nnlrA Puuiabi and Urduwitli equal fluency and seemed both in terested and well informed on Indian affairs, lends colour to local report that he was an Indian disguised as an Arab. M. Delcorde, Inspector-General of Persian Customs, visited Zahidan during the month. Peter Gonnheimer, German national, arrived at Zahidan on 19th. He had neglected to obtain an exit visa from Tehran Police and was detained pending telegraphic reference. He intends pro ceeding to China via India in search of employment. He states that he is an engineer. R. W. Puckle, British subject, accom panied by H. W. Irvin, U. S. citizen, passed through Zahidan on 16th en route China. M. G. A. McIntosh, Canadian Missionary, arrived at Zahidan from India on the 16th and proceeded to Meshed for Tehran. Captain Benyon, endeavouring to estab lish a motor record from London to Calcutta, left Zahidan for India on the 9th. Dr. D. Black arrived from India on the 9th and proceeded to Tehran. C. K.

Persian Baluchistan .—Reports indi cate that the tribal situation is deteriorating. The arrest and despatch of Sardar Barkat Khan and the execution of Ibrahim Khan has had a disturbing effect on all the Sou thern tribes. Abdul Hussain attacked the Persian post near Remishk and killed some soldiers, the ^ remainder fled to Iranshehr. Sardars Saidi ' and the Nawab of Ab-i-Kharan have collect ed their followers near Iranshehr and threatened the lives of any soldiers who leave the Fort. One man has been killed by them. The extreme heat renders action against the tribes difficult although it is rumoured that action is shortly to be taken under orders from Tehran. The O. 0. C. has reversed the policy of his pridecessor and favours Jiand Khan as opposed to Idu Khan. Bamri tribesmen recently murdered a Persian soldier near Karvinda and cut the telegraph line. The mother of the late Dost Mohamed Khan has again visited Khwash to obtain sanction for her son Nausherwan, and Ali Mahomed to return to Persia. Sarhang Mukhtiari who recently inspect ed the accounts of the Baluchistan Brigade, has compelled Yarwar Khabir Zadeh to appear in Zahidan and settle an account of 1,500 Tomans due to a British Indian Sub ject. The amount has been outstanding for 3 years. Batches of Zabul Conscripts have been sent to Khwash for training. The Gl. 0. C. despatched several loads of wheat as a present to Lashkar Khan Gumshadzai and Jiand Khan Yarmohamed- zai. The former accepted the gift, but the latter declined, and has removed his flocks to Mishkil. Heavy rain fell in the Sarhad and has caused damage to the Karezes. 2. Sistan and Kainat. —It is rumoured that the hereditary Governor, Hisam-ud- Dowleh, nephew of Shaukat-ul-Mulk has sought permission to resign. Typhoid is increasing at Birjand. It is evident that the pipe water-supply which was installed last year is infected, but such ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S \ Letter ^ j uued u Sr 1932 Reo^eo 19 SEP. iB32 is the faith of Persians in everything mo dern that they decline to believe that the water of an expensive pipe-system can pos sibly be unhealthy. 3. Persian Departments, Customs. —The Inspectors at Zahidan have been checking the books of Indian traders. Five or Six who had declared fictitious exports, have been required to furnish security. The books of the remainder have been returned. Owing to the smuggling of silver from Persia, the Customs have ordered a strict search of all drivers leaving for India. Lorries are to proceed under Guard in Convoys, to the frontier. Practically all the officials of the Excise Department at Birjand have been dismissed for fraud. Municipal.— new Electric Light Ins tallation of Birjand was formally opened on 10th July. A small hospital of 10 beds has been open ed at Birjand—cost of upkeep is to be de frayed from Municipal funds. Governorate .—Mahomed Khan Hadi, recently Beis-i-Baladieh (Mayor) of MesheJ, assumed charge of the Governorate, Zabul, on July 30th. Justice .—Sardars Amir Khan and Dost Mahomed Khan, two leading Sardars of Sistan are under arrest, accused of the murder, with gross brutality, of a male servant. In this connection the Officer Com manding the Load Guards is under arrest accused of having accepted bribes from interested parties. The practice of one Peace Court Judge for Zabul and Zahidan still continues and the Court is transferred at the whim of the Judge to whichever place offers the greater financial attraction. By this means too, difficult cases can be indefinitely post poned. Roads.—&amp; contract has been given for a large supply of bricks for a bridge to be constructed over the Naurab, near Zabul. The long promised repair of the Sistan road therefore appears to be really about to take place. 4. Climate. —Abnormally hot. 110 deg rees Fahrenheit was registered at Birjand.Heavy rain fell at Zahidan and caused con- siderable damage. There is no record o rain at Zahidan in July, within the memory of the oldest inhabitant. 5 . Miscellaneous .—On July 7th an In dian named Khrishna (Alias Ah Akhbar) arrived at Zahidan under guard. He was taken to Mirjawa and put across the border into British Territory. He is said to have been brought from Tehran. The Governor, Kain, has notified that in future only Tabriz! weights may be legally used in Kain province. 6 . Foreign Travellers. —M. Louis Joseph Bouvier, Brench Citizen, passed through Zahidan for India, late in June. Herr Trappe, wife and daughter, German citizens, left Birjand for Meshed on 12th. He is employed by Shaukat-Ul-Mulk as Agricultural Adviser. 0. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.

Daly accompanied by the Headquarter Staff of the Consulate proceed ed to Meshed on 13th to officiate as Consul- General in Khorasan vice Colonel C. C. Barrett proceeded on sick leave. Captain L. A. G. Pinhey, H. M.’s Vice- Consul at Zahidan proceeded to Quetta on 17th June on four days casual leave. He was detained by the Medical authori ties to be under observation, and returned to his post on 27th. He is unfortunately suffering from Sprue but it is anticipated that he will be fit to continue to discharge his duties. 2 . Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad .— The new G. 0. C. Sartip Abbas Khan is on bad terms with Idu Khan. The late G. 0. C. very wisely used Idu Khan as an intermediary in his dealings with the tribes and the avowed policy of his succes sor to undermine the authority of Idu Khan may well lead to widespread disaffec tion. The Yarmahommedzais, Gumsad- zais and many Damanis who have long threatened to emigrate, but were restrained by Idu Khan are now reported to be contemplating a rising. Gumshadzais recently raided the Persian Military at Ab Khan, near Kwash, and carried of 20 Government camels. The G. 0. C. intends to take action against the Damanis, but no date has yet been fixed for the commencement of opera tions. Barkat Khan of Bint and his son have been arrestd by the G. 0. C., Kerman, and sent to Tehran. Another relative named Ibrahim Khan has also been arrest ed and is in custody at Kwash. A later report is to the effect that the latter was shot on June 9th. Sarhang Mukhtari is making enquiries regarding the alleged complicity of the late G. 0. C. in the sale of Government arms last year. Abdul Hussain of Remishk continues to raid caravans and being highly incensed at the execution of Ibrahim Khan has declared that he will never sur render, Sardar Saidi of Ab-i-Kharan recently attacked the village of Sardar Rustam Khan of the same tribe and killed several persons. Idu Khan is said to have sent a message to these Sardars to cease fight ing but to prepare for a struggle with tie MC312FD common enemy—presumably the G. 0. C. The latter has threatened to send Idu Khan to Tehran on a charge of complicity with the late G. 0. C. in the sale of arms. From a number of reports which have been received from independent sources it appears certain that the situation in the Sarhad is deteriorating. Whatever may have been his shortcomings Sartip Mahom ed Khan managed the tribes very satis factorily and was, without doubt, tactful in his dealings with them. His successor has so far shown little ability. 3. Sistan and Qainat. —Mehr Dad who was recently appointed Governor at Zabul has already been superseded. The Tele graph Master is temporarily acting and Hadi, until recently Municipal Commis sioner at Meshed is under orders to pro ceed to Zabul to assume charge of the Governorate. Hadi was, a few years ago, Governor at Zahidan. He is well and progressive and appears to possess the confidence of the Governor-General in Khorasan. He called on H. M. Consul- General at Meshed and offered to co operate in any matters affecting the in terests of British subjects. A small party in Zabul, former support- &gt; ers of the Soviet Consulate and known to be still in touch with the Soviet Consu late-General at Meshed, have recently been active in disseminating false reports about our hospital in Zabul and have induced certain people to petition the Persian Gov ernment for a hospital to be opened there. For some time past there has been no Doctor at all in Zabul, except the British Consulate Medical Staff. A Military Doctor who was recently sent there was found drunk in the street and suffering from knife wounds and has been transferred. Dr. Zahidi, previously Municipal Health Officer, is being sent back to Zabul in the same capacity. He is a drunken indivi dual with practically no medical qualifi cations. The troops in Zabul, who are forbidden to attend our hospital and can therefore only call out the Assistant Sur geon privately, or visit the hospital surrep titiously, recently petitioned to be re leased from service as they had no medical attention. Several were punished by the enclosure !N INDIA FOREIGN SECH‘ T Letter vln t ,!ec 2 PJllO 1C4 ’33? #'■919322 Commanding Officer. Dysentery is preva lent among the troops. 4 . Persian Military Affairs .—It is pro posed to move the Conscription Office from Zabul to Kwash in the near future. Enquiries are being made as to whether conscripts can be found who will main tain their own camels. 100 men are re quired for the Camel-Corps in the Sarhad. Pay amounting to Rials 57 • 50 is offered for a man with a Camel, or Rials 37-50 if the camel be supplied by the Covern- ment. Sartip Mahomed Khan, late Military Oovernor in the Sarhad left Zahidan for Tehran &lt;on .June 8 th. Neither m Kwash nor in Zahidan did any of his late Com mand see him off. Sarhang Mukhtan left Zahidan for Kwash on 4th to continue enquiries regarding the disposal of Govern ment arms which took place last year. He is said to have stated that he found no direct evidence against the late G. (X C. but Iskander Khan, his Brother-in-Law had disposed of the arms and doubtless shared the proceeds. The wireless outfit which had been sent to Kwash for use during the operations against Remishk, has bem removed and the Operator has returned to Tehran. 5 . Persian Officials .—The Minister of Justice was expected in Zahidan in con nection with the Customs frauds. Some thing must have discouraged him from un- d rtaking this weary journey, for on arriv al at Birjand he busied himself in en quiring into the working of the local Court and the Excise (Opium) Department, both of which are notoriously corrupt. After placing practically all the officials concerned under arrest, the Minister sped away to Meshed. In taking this decision he showed acumen, for had he proceeded to Zahidan and had he prosecuted careful enquiries there, it would probably have been necessary to place under arrest the majority of the officials not excepting the Special Inspectors. 6 . Miscellaneous News .—The desire of the Persian Government to collect photos appears to be insatiable. At Zabul all officials have been required to complete various forms to which photos are attachedj The school children appearing for their final examinations are required to pro duce three photos. The Reisd-Sulhieh (Peace Court. Judge); of Zabul has been sent to Zahidan to join in the merry hunt which is proceeding to track the defrauders of the Customs. Meanwhile there is no Court in Zabul. The National Bank at Zabul is pressing notes on- the public. The notes are not U, readily accepted outside the town and it is difficult to obtain silver. The Banlf is charging 10 per cent, discount on Im perial Bank of Persia Notes, while in. the bazaar merchants are charging a com mission for cashing the new National 1 Bank notes. The Revenue Office, Zabul, has notified the public that all contracts of ten thous and Tomans or over must be registered 5 at the Revenue Office and are liable to a tax of 10 per cent. Contracts for lesser sums are to be regis tered in the Adlieh Office at rates not yet fixed. A meeting was held at Zahidan Revenue Office on 8 th at which the Government conversion rates for Revenue grain were announced as follows :—* Wheat 1 st quality Rials 55 per Kharvar (1,300 lbs.) Wheat Medium quality Rials 50 per Kharvar (1,300 lbs.) Wheat Poor quality Rials 45 per Kharvar (1,300 lbs.) On June 3 rd at Zabul the Police raided a house and discovered dies, etc., for illicit coining of Rials. 343 false coins were com fiscated. On the 4th further dies were found in another house. A Meshedi who was under arrest in this connection escaped from custody and has not yet been ap prehended. The National Bank at Zahidan ran short of cash towards the end of the month. The Manager was placed in the humiliating position of having to call on his clients and request them not to draw cheques. To meet cheques already presented he had to resort to borrowing in the bazaar. Later money was received from Meshed. The confidence of the public was shaken and various rumours resulted.—The Na tional Bank was shortly to be closed—all German Officials were about to be replaced by Swiss, etc. The smuggling.of Silver from Zahidan to India continues. It is estimated that one hundred thousand Krans reached Kundi in one week. Many of the shop-keepers in Birjand have ceased to sell sugar. Both Russian sugar and Java sugar can be purchased cheaply in the villages as smuggling is regularly carried on all along the border of East Persia.7. Ceremonial. —His Britannic Majesty’s ^Birthday was celebrated at Birjand, Zabul, and Zahidan Vice-Consulates as usual, ^jpceptions were held and were well attended. 8 . Communications. —Boad communica tion with Sistan has been interrupted by water in the Sheileh. A survey is being carried out for new roads from Zabul to Zahidan and Zabul—Deh Dost Mahomed, on the Afghan Frontier. The Governor-de signate for Zabul informed H. M. Consul- General that orders had been received for the construction of these roads but ho had yet to discover where the funds were to come from. 9. Foreign Travellers. —Jacob Ploner, German Journalist and Georges Miraz, Austrian Professor, and wife, left Zahidan for India on 8 th. They stated that they intended to go to Afghanistan and thence over the Hindukush to China. Erich Mandel, German, arrived at Zahi dan on foot from Kerman, on 7 th. He pro fesses to be studying Economics, but is a mendicant who exists by selling worthless pictures. (Sd.) C. K.

Sistan Consulate Area Locust Beport, for the month of May. Diary of His Britanic Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of May 1932. 1. H. B. M.’s Consular Officers .— H. B. M.’s Consul-General at Meshed having been granted sick leave, Major C. K. Daly, H. M. Consul for Sistan and Kain is under orders to assume charge of H. M. Consulate-General in Khorassan in addition to administrative control of Sistan and Kain Consulate, and will proceed to Meshed in June. 2. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad .— Khan Sahib Idu Khan was called to Zahidan on 25th to visit the G. 0. C. Sardar Jiand Khan Yarmohammadzai who has been living over the border in British Baluchistan was induced by Idu Khan to return to Gazu, but is reported to have taken an oath that after harvesting their crops he will emigrate to British territory, or should he not obtain permission to settle there will go to Afghanistan. The mother of the late Dost Mohomed Khan recently visited Kwash to seek per mission for her husband Ali Mohamed and her son Nowsherwan to return to Persia from Panjgur. As a rumour was then cur rent that Sartip Mohamed Khan had been killed at Ramishk, she returned to Da war Paneh (Dizzak) without seeing him. Sardar Saidi and his brother Nawab of Ab-i-Khurran are still rebellious. They recently attacked a caravan from Minab and also a Military convoy conveying rations near Iransheher. Abdul Hussain of Bemishk has occupied a position on the hills in Bashkard and is once more engaged in highway robbery. One Sarfaraz of Sarbaz accompanied by 15 tribesmen recently attacked a military party grazing camels near Iransheher. Two soldiers were killed and 30 camels looted. The culprits have now joined forces with Saidi and Nawab (see above). The troops on return from the fighting at Remishk brought 7 Baluchi prisoners. One was shot at Iransheher and the remainder are in custody at Kwash. About 100 rifles mostly muzzle-loaders— were recovered from the tribes. Wild rumours regarding alleged disturbances in Tehran have been circulating among the tribes and causing unrest. The supersession of the G. 0. C. Sartip Mohomed Khan (who has been ordered to Tehran) has also en- W CLOSURE IN 1 'OiA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S j j No 9 I M. : couraged the hot-heads, only the Rekis, who owing to the influence of Idu Khan received exceptionally good treatment, are sorry to see his departure. He was never theless a capable officer and if his methods were unduly harsh, in accordance with European views, he at least succeeded in maintaining a semblance of Law and Order in a very wild and difficult part of the country. The Persians have demanded payment of a tax of 4 Rials per date tree in the Sarhad, as a consequence of which the Baluchis of Sib and Suran have gone to British terri tory at Panjgur leaving only a few men to collect the date harvest. 3. Sistan and the Qainat. —The Revenue Department at Zabul has received instruc tions to restore to Sardar Mallick Mohamed Khan all lands which were confiscated from him. It is probable that Shaukat-ul-Mulk who has proceeded to Tehran will be able to secure his release from custody. Sardar Ali Khan Sarabandi who has an old trade dispute with the Indian firm Rai Sahib Gulab Singh recently sent a bribe of 100 Tomans and a maimd of opium to the Peace Court at Zabul. The Revenue Officer got news of this and Revenue and Amnieh officials searched for and recovered the opium. The matter is under investigation. The Moharrum processions took place without disorder at Birjand and Zabul. By Police orders, processions were limited and centres for “ Rouza-Khawani ” (Religi ous readings) were controlled by the authori ties. H. E. Shaukat-ul-Mulk left Birjand for Tehran on the 24th. He sold landed pro perty to the value of 12,000 Tomans to raise funds for his journey. He is to thank H. I. M. the Shah, in person, for the order recently bestowed upon him and it is anti cipated that he will endeavour to secure the release of his relative Mallick Mohammad Khan. Samsam-Ud-Dowleh, ez-Governor of Sistan is now at Birjand, engaged in erect ing a Municipal lighting plant and cinema. 4. Persian—Military—On May 24th Sartip Mohammed Khan was relieved of hiscommand of tlie Baluchistan-Sarhad area and ordered to report at Tehran. He w as succeeded on the 29th by Sartip Abbas Khan, late G. 0. C. Kerman. The Persian troops operating against Kemishk have now withdrawn to Kwash, leaving a garrison of ICO at Transhener. Six severely wounded have been brought back ; the extent of casualties is unknown, but it is freely rumoured that the number returned is considerably less than that which originally left Kwash. It is certain that apart from the fighting there wore many deaths from sickness. The rifles sold by the Government of India in 1928-29 which were stocked in Zahidan have been sent to Kwash for dis tribution to the troops. Sarhang Muktari and two officers of the Military Audit Department arrived at Zahidan on the 25th to check the accounts of Sujjan Singh Mohar Singh, Indian Traders, who claim Tomans 31,000 from the Military Department for rations supplied. The Military authorities at Zabul have called for tenders for the supply of 100 Kharvars of flour to the troops at Kwash. —up till the end of May no tenders were forthcoming. Conscripts at Zabul are now being made to perform Police duties at night in addi tion to the Police. 5 . Persian (finals —Customs Ins pectors at Zahidan have examined the books of Ittihadieh, a Persian firm. The firm is said to have exported goods on fictitious permits, to the value of Tomans 20 , 000 . The entry of a bribe to a Customs officials has led to his arrest. Mehdi Arbab (see Diary for April) and Nazimi, his contractor, have, it is said, con fessed to smuggling on a wholesale scale and that they bribed M. Graux, late Cus toms Director, and his Persian successor, Abul Faiz Khan. Nazimi has also smuggled cocaine, which is now being sold in Isfahan. Mohammed Agha, nephew of Mehdi Arbab has been arrested, as also Watani, his partner. Ptubi, of the Persian firm of Ghulam Keza Yezdi, who disappeared with his account books has been apprehended. The total amount of which Arbab is alleged to have defrauded the Customs now amounts to 1,400,000 Rials. Two further Inspectors have arrived from Tehran and the work of attempting to clear the Augean Stables continues, meanwhile business is entirely dislocated. Yawar Hassan Khan Godarzi has succeed ed Sarhang Mustafa Khan as Head of the Amnieh, Sistan and Kain. Masoom Khan, Governor of Sistan, w^ transferred to Bujnurd on the 5th. He ^ capable and had some authority. He is suc ceeded by Mehr Dad, who was Governor in Zahidan two years ago. • He is a venerable and entirely ineffectual old gentleman of the pre-war type of officials. Sartip Abdul Razzak, leader of the Persian Survey party, reached Zahidan on 14th and intended to survey the area Zahidan —Koh-i-Malik-Siah. 6 . Afghan News.—On May 14th a new Afghan Consul arrived at Zabul, but did not assume charge till 19th. He is said to be a member of the Mohammadzai to which family the present King of Afghanistan belongs. Further details are awaited from Zabul. The Zabul police have notified that in future Afghan applicants for ‘ perission de Sejour ’ will be required to produce 8 photos, 5 to be retained by the Police and 3 in the Afghan Consulate. One Ghaur Jan, Afghan, has been arrested at Zabul for alleged gun-running. Mohammad Ali Khan, a notorious Afghan gun-runner, has arrived in Birjand. He brought with him one Kharvar of smuggled opium from Herat. He has purchased three rifles from a local notable. Last year he made an abortive attempt to purchase Government rifles from the local Military Commandant. His activities are well known, but he enjoys the protection of the leading families in Birjand. A report is current that an Afghan Gene ral recently visited Farah, Kung and Mian. He arrested the Naib Salar at Farah, the Customs officers at Kung and the Gov ernor at Mian, all of whom were sent to Kabul. It has also said that he has des patched troops to arrest the Naib-ul-Hu- kumat in Herat. 7. Health. —A report that Cholera had broken out among the Baluchis of Koh-i- Bazman has been difficult to check. Doc tors despatched from Zahidan and Kerman disagreed as to whether the disease was Cholera or not, and it has been found im possible to obtain any reliable news. Typhoid —continues in Birjand. The main water supply is infected. Apart from meetings at which the Doctors invaria bly disagree, no action is being taken to effectually deal with the situation. 8 . Municipal .—It has been decided to construct four new Khiabans on the out skirts of Birjand, and Tomans 2,000 has been allotted by the Central Government for the purpose.Apart from satisfaction of local vanity the expenditure will be entirely useless. Under instructions from Meshed the f -ion and Sun ’ Society of Birjand have en holding meetings to raise subscriptions for the relief of the poor suffering from the Typhoid epidemic. The results have so far been negligible. 9. Miscellaneous news. —A villager from near Birjand, who had absconded from conscription, was -arrested, but drowned himself in a water tank on the way to the barracks. On May 9th the Customs officer at Zabul entered the godowns of various British Indian Traders and listed their goods. On May 11 th the same official forcibly entered the godowns of the Agents of a British Indian trader named Bashirullah and confiscated 30 cases of tea. This matter has been separately reported to H, B, M.’s Minister at Tehran. Chet Singh, a trader of Zahidan, was arrested for alleged smuggling of gold coins. He has been released on bail. At Birjand, the police have received orders that all members of the force who are confirmed opium-smokers are to be dismissed. As the majority are addicted to the habit the Mili tary Doctor is endeavouring to treat them. At Birjand a graveyard in the centre of the town has been converted into a Munici pal garden. Some ancient copper vessels were unearthed during the construction and are to be sent to Tehran. On 12 th May four armed dacoits looted the Persian Mail lorry near Hormuk and robbed the passengers. On receipt of the news of the impending arrival of a Postal Department Inspector at Birjand, the local Post Master resorted to borrowing from the leading merchants and the Telegraph Master to complete his cash balance. ! Silver is being smuggled from Persia via Zahidan in ever-increasing quantities. The local officials are quite unable to cope with this branch of the thriving industry in contraband articles. 10 . Foreign Travellers via Zahidan .— {a) Mrs. Louis Kenivautier, French B. C. Priest, arrived from India on the 17th and proceeded to Meshed. {h) J. S. Haqqi, French Syrian, Pro fessor in Aligarh University, arrived on the 24th and proceeded to Meshed e/n route to Syria. (c) M.

F, Fisuer (?) German tourists ar rived from Meshed on 28th May. They allege that they have been deputed by the Univer sity of Munich for Geographical Research and intend travelling to China via Chaman, Kandahar and Kabul in the first instance. They are at present endeavouring to raise funds from the local Persian gentry. British Travellers. —Mr. Dowling, A.P.O.C., having closed that Company’s branch at Meshed, arrived at Birjand on the 23rd to open his headquarters for East Persia. Miss D. Wiggins, B. C. M. S., Zahidan, returned from India on the 24th May. Mr. D. J. Stopford Adams, H. B. M.’s Consular Service, China (retired) arrived at Zahidan on 24th and proceeded to Meshed en route to U. K. Mr. R. H.

Sistan Consulate area Locust Report. Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of April 1932. (1) H. M. Consular, etc., Officers. —Cap tain Beausang, I.M.S., arrived at Zabul on April 22 nd to assume charge of the office of Medical Officer and Ex-Officio Vice Con sul at Zabul vice Captain Shepherd, I.M.S., who had proceeded to the United King dom. Mr. D. Busk, 3rd Secretary, H. B. M’s Legation, Tehran arrived at Zabul on the 19th and left for Zahidan on the 23rd April. H. M.’s Consul, Sistan and Kain moved to summer quarters arriving at Birjand on April 27th. Captain Pinhey, H. M’s Vice-Consul, Zahidan, was granted short Casual Leave from 21 st April to enable him to accompany Mrs. Pinhey to Quetta. ( 2 ) Persian Baluchistan. —Sartip Mo- hamed Khan and the Headquarters staff were expected to reach Kwash on April 20 th. Two companies of Infantry are being left to garrison Bampur. Sardar Abdul Hussain is reported to be still concealed in the hills near Ramishk. ( 3 ) Sardar Mahomed Malik Khan, the leading Sardar (a relative of Shauhat-Ul-Mulk) who has been in custody for some months under Martial Law has been sent to Tehran. His landed property has been confiscated. No charge has been openly made against him and it is believed that he has fallen a victim to the intrigues of Sartip Mahomed Khan (G. 0. C. Sistan Brigade and Military Governor in the Sarhad). The latter has long been at enmity with Sarhang Murteza Khan, late Frontier Poli tical Officer, and was jealous of the influ ence Murteza Khan was acquiring in Sis tan, where he championed the local Sar- dars, and was supported by the late Gov ernor Samsom Ud-Dowleh. I0U FOREIGN SECRETARY’S i U*. - 741 *! DHted 25 NiAY. 1932 , . R«,,'vt,r 13JUN. Last summer a small fracas occurred between followers of Malik Mahomed Khan and cultivators of neighbouring Sardar. Such occurrences are of almost daily oc currence. The opportunity was seized by the local military commander and the Am- nieh (doubtless under the G. 0. C.’s gui dance) and alarmist telegrams were des patched to Tehran which led to the dis missal of the hereditary Governor Samsam- Ud-Dowleh. His successor, the Officer I/c Amnieh was a personal enemy of Malik Mahomed Khan (the chief remaining sup porter of Sarhang Murteza Khan) and the latters arrest followed. S. Murteza Khan was relieved of his post as Frontier Officer, but was temporarily appointed a member of the Helmand Frontier Commission. Since the Commission ceased work he has remained unemployed at Zabul and his repeated applications for leave have been refused. It is learnt from a reliable source that he has been reported by the G. 0. C. as being an active supporter of the late Soviet Consul Sistan. A more malicious and unfounded attack on him could scarcely have been devised. He is very strongly anti-Soviet and took very effective steps to curtail the Soviet Consul’s local activities. Of the many officials who have served in Sistan since my arrival there, Sarhang Murteza Khan is the only one who has consistently behaved in a straightforward and honest manner, ( 4 ) Persian Customs .—The recent action of the Inspectors at Zahidan (mentioned in paragraph 6 of Diary for March) has caused great excitement. Mehdi Arbab’s case is to come before the Courts. He is still in custody, bail having been refused. sr-2 One Syed Mahomed who had imported prohibited goods from India has been ar rested and is believed to have confessed his guilt. Goods so imported by him were for the Director of Posts and Telegraphs and the Police Commandant. The Inspectors called upon all traders to produce lists of goods imported during the past year. While Indian Traders were awaiting advice as to whether they should comply with this order one Illahi Baksh left for India taking with him all his account books, whereupon the Inspectors arrested four Indian traders. They were released on bail on H. M’s Vice-Consul’s intervention, ; and the account books of others were sealed and they were called upon to give security. One Haji Ghulam Qasim was detained for over 24 hours as he could find no security. H. M’s Vice Consul has lodged a protest with the Governor. The clerk of Illahi Buksh, who declares that his principal has gone to India in the ordinary course of business, has been told that none of the latter’s goods lying in the Customs may be cleared although their value greatly exceeds the security demanded from all other traders. The matter is being investigated by H. M.’s Vice-Consul and further information is awaited. Both Indian and Persian traders have sent telegrams of protest to H. M. the Shah. It is well known that gross irregularities have been occurring in the Customs and it may be assumed that Indians have followed the example of Persian traders, officials and indeed the Customs Officials them selves. They could not, in fact, compete in trade otherwise. From the fact that action has been taken against two Persians only, while nearly all the Indians have been called upon to lodge security, seems to point to a desire to make the foreigners the scape-goats, whereas the venal Customs Officials are the prime mov ers. Not only at Zahidan, but along the whole length of the Perso-Afghan frontier smug- ling is rife, since the withdrawal of the railway. In the Miankhangi district of Sistan loaf sugar which retails at 11 J Krans normally, is everywhere procurable at Krans 5. Even imported jars of Cold-cream for toilet pur poses, which sell usually at Krans 15, can be obtained for Krans 5. As an example of the universal corruption of Persian Officials it may be mentioned that Sartip A. Razzak Khan (leader of the Persian Survey party operating on the frontier) and his subordinates are compen sating themselves for the lack of amenities and rigours of life on the frontier, by smug gling cloth, sugar and foodstuffs, which* they obtain from Kundi, into Persia. ' One of the Customs Inspectors at Zahi dan recently crossed the frontier .and pro ceeded to Juzzak, ostensibly to call upon the Sartip, among whose party was the Cantonment Commandant of Zahidan. A Persian soldier at Zahidan managed to convey a warning of his approach to the Cantonment Commandant, who, together with the Sartip spent a hectic time conceal ing the stock of goods they had accumu lated to forward to Persia. They even requested the Havildar of our Levy post at Ruzzak to take charge of the goods until the Inspector should depart. ( 5 ) Frontier Survey. —The British Sur vey Party had completed their work by the end of the month. The area mapped cover ing the disputed length of frontier in the neighbourhood of Mirjawa. Captain Bom- ford reports that the Persians have made little progress and will take several years to complete the work. As long as the party find that their stay can be turned to good account, vide remarks under paragraph 4 above, it may be presumed that they will be in no hurry to complete the work. ( 6 ) Afghan Affairs. —It is believed that Persian Consuls in Afghanistan have had in structions to refuse visas to Afghan traders to visit Persia till further orders. This may be an attempt to stop smuggling, if so, it will be abortive since those engaged in smuggling ignore such formalities. ( 7 ) Health. —A dangerous disease, the nature of which is not yet known, although Cholera is suspected, has broken out at Bazman near Kwash and many deaths have occurred. Four Persian doctors have been sent there. Typhoid continues at Birjand. ( 8 ) British Travellers. —Captain K. Hicks (and wife) British Army, arrived at Zahidan on the 5th and proceeded to Me shed. He is spending short leave in East Persia. On his return from Meshed, he made a short tour in the neighbourhood of Birjand. As he went, on the advice of Mr. C. P- Skrine, late Consul Sistan to a locality sel dom visited by Europeans, it has given rise to some speculation among the local officials as to the object of his visit. H. M. Consul had no advice of the pro jected trip. It would be well, particularly in the case of military officers, whose jour neys are always viewed with suspicion.if arrangements could be made through the Consulate, in the event of officers desiring to make pleasure trips of this nature. (9) Foreign Travellers .— S. P. Gallini, Italian trader arrived at Zahidan on the 12 th from India and proceeded to Tehran. Leon Constantion Nicholas, Armenian Persian subject, who has owned a hotel in Rangoon for many years, arrived at Zahidan from India, with two sons, on the 8 th and proceeded to Tehran, ( 10 ) Persian Officials .—Sartip Iraj Khan arrived at Birjand from Meshed on 9 th and inspected the local garrision of cavalry. Mirza Ahmad Khan, Official of the Ministry of Interior, arrived at Birjand on the 3rd and inspected the Go venerate and Municipality. He refused invitations of Shaukat-Ul-Mulk and the Governor and hired quarters in the town. Shaukat-Ul-Mulk is by no means happy as to his position. His inability to assist, without drawing unpleasant consequences upon himself, his nephew Samsam-Ud- Dowleh, who was deprived of the Governor ship of Zabul, or his brother-in-law Malik Mahomed Khan, who is mentioned in para graph 3, is under arrest, has greatly de creased his prestige in these parts, while the attack on his relatives may well be a deter mined effort to decrease his influence. He wisely refrains from any share in politics, but the ostentatious manner in which he entertained the Shah and retinue in 1930 was undoubtedly a mistake and served only to draw unwelcome attention to his position in East Persia. He has however lately been the recipient of the “ Hamayun ” Order 2 nd class for his work on the Helmand Boundary Commis sion, the whole expense of which he bore. (11) Excise. —An Inspector of Excise who recently visited Birjand, is reported to have collected about Ts. 2,000 in bribes from the local officials. The official selling rate for Opium is Krans 1 • 20 but the local officials are openly charging Krans 1-25. The sales from the Birjand Depot are reported to amount to about 6,000 Mis- cals monthly. (12) Climate .— Snow was unusually scar ce in Kainat last winter and consequently the Karezes are poorly supplied with water. No rain fell after Nauroz, but at the end of April unusually heavy rain fell in the neighbourhood Birjand-Shusp. (13) Communications .— Consequent on the rains mentioned in paragraph 12 the Meshed-Zahidan road has been severely damaged. It was impassable for a few days at the end of April, near Shusp. (14) Miscellaneous .— Wild rumours have been circulating in the local bazaars, of the discovery of a subversive plot in Teh ran. The Ministers of War, Interior, Posts and Telegraphs and many others are said to have been arrested and the Shah to have fled to Mazanderan. The origin of these rumours would seem to have been the ar rest of a number of not very important persons, suspected of anti-governmental leanings. The exaggerated rumours have however been given credence by the lower orders and it is evident that the failure of the plot has caused disappointment. From a well informed source it is gather ed that the unpopularity of the present regime is on the increase and is steadily extending to the lower commissioned offi cers and the rank and file of the army. The only really contented class would appear to be the officials of the Civil de^ partments in the provinces, who find in the unending stream of new laws and regu lations a fertile source of income from bribery.

Casu- oi+ip* were 12 Baluchis killed including o son of Sardar Abdul Hussain. The troops had 3 killed and 4 wounded^ The rnaioritv Of the tribesmen deserted their kader Abdul Hussain, who fled with a following of some 20 men only. The remainder are handing m their arms q^rriar Bustom Khan of Champ, who had foined Abdul Hussain, fled to Chahbar. rnp^ Persians have captured 500 sheep and goats, 30 camels and 15 cows belong ing to Abdul Hussain. The G. 0. C. has arrested Barkat Khan of Bint. ’ His son is collecting the rifles of the tribe and has been told that his father will be released on completion of the disarming of the tribe. It is, however, commonly believed that he will be sent to Tehran. Sardar Saidi and the^ Nawab of Ab-i- Khurran have still _ declined to surrender and operations against them have been deferred for the summer. MC30FD The G. 0. C. proposes to put 200 men at Bemishk and 200 at Lashar. The G. O. C. appears to have brought to a successful conclusion operations which at one time appeared likely to be barren of results. The Baluchis occupied an almost impregnable position, but by bidding his time the G. 0. C. evidently counted on dissensions among the various tribes. 3 . Frontier Surrey. —The Persian party under Mirza Abdul Bazzaq Khan, Sartip, arrived at Zahidan on 3rd March. Malik Mohamed Khan and Mulla &gt; Dur Mohamed, two Baluchis of Zahidan, visited the Sartip, who enquired what information they had as regards Kacha Post. They replied that the ^ Commis sion under Colonel Weir and Amir Nizam, from the Persian side, decided many years ago that the Jozzak-Bobat road was in British territory and Kacha Post was cm the road, but that subsequently the British moved Kacha Post about ^ one h arsak i inside Persian territory. It is not known whether there is any truth in this state ment that the post was ever moved from the original site. On March the 11 th the Persian party proceeded to Mirjawa. They were de layed there owing to inability to obtain camel transport. Available camels had been engaged by the Frontier Assistant for the British party, and the Baluchis had removed all others, since the i m ary authorities had endeavoured to seize .hem without payment, for the Persian Survey party. . . Captain Bomford, B.E., O.C., British Survey party, arrived Mirjawa on th - 16th, and commenced the survey of the border towards Bobat. The Governor, Zahidan, had asked Tehran for permission for the party to enter Persia without passports. e t ; on to the Police, however, took no action to cNCLOSU'rU I'N INDIA FOREIGN SECHHARY’b Letter '^ 0 ® ^ Dated 28 APR. 1952 fYAV •2 inform the officials concerned, because he had received no direct orders from his own Department, and presumably declined to act on the Governor’s instructions. Consequently the Cantonment Command ant, who went to Mirjawa, refused to per mit the armed members to enter until he obtained separate instructions from Tehran. He declined to consult the Governor. The latter has reported this typical example of the lack of co-ordination between de partments to Tehran. 4 Sistan. —Heavy rain fell in Sistan on the 21 st and 22 nd and the road to Zahidan became temporarily impassable for motor traffic. A number of buildings in Zabul collapsed, but there were no casualties. 5 Ceremonial. —H. M. the Shah s birth- day was celebrated on 15th March. H. M. s [ Consul paid the customary official visit to the Governor, and was received by a military Guard of Honour, a mark oi respect which has not hitherto been accorded. The New Year was similarly celebrated on March 21 st, On February 23rd the Cantonment Com mandant at Zahidan held an official celebration of the Coup d’Etat. Persians only were invited. 6 . Miscellaneous.—Wx. Delisse, Direc tor of Custopis, Zahidan, declined, in ac cordance with his standing instructions, to allow two Inspectors of the Adlieh Department, who arrived on March 4th to inspect his books, until he obtained orders from Tehran. He wired for instructions, but meanwhile the Inspectors had report ed his refusal to produce the books and he was arrested, and kept in the local lock-up for 24 hours, being subsequently released on orders from Tehran. He is said to have demanded payment of his salary for the three years of his contract, and to be allowed to return to Belgium. He did not resume duty for several days as a protest. Later the Inspectors arrested Mehdi Irbab, the most prominent Persian mer chant, on a charge of smuggling. The Persian shopkeepers held a hartal Indians who sought the advice of H. M.’s Vice- Consul as to whether they might join the hartal were discouraged and took no part. Nothing could be discovered from Mehdi Irbab ? s account books and it was rumoured that the Persian Foreign Office would endeavour, through the good offices of H M’s Legation, to obtain Railway Statis tics of goods imported by Mehdi Irbab. This rumour caused consternation among the Indians, many of whom have no doubt also found means to escape full custom^ on goods imported. The Customs officials were also greatly perturbed at the pros pect. i The Zabul Municipality is constructing a slaughter house. None previously existed. ’ 2 ^. The new Police Officer at^abul has been active in rounding up gamblers and bad characters. The National Bank has announced that, with effect from 21 st March, Krans will be converted into Rials. 7 . Afghan Affairs.—McxM Razaak Khan, Afghan Consul-General at Meshed, proceeded to Kabul via Zahidan on 1 st March. . ; He stated that he had gone on leave, but local rumour has it that he proved obstructive in the preliminary negotia tions which took place at Meshed, in the matter of the Helmand Water supply, and advised his Government not to concede the Persian demands, which led to the break down of the subsequent negotiations on the frontier. As a result he was not 'persona grata with the Persians, whom he had also offended in smaller matters, and his exequatur had been cancelled. That this rumour may hawe some foun dation, would seem to explain the obvious reluctance of the Afghan Consul, Sistan, to have anything to do with the negotia tions which took place here. It is^ well known that on the occasion of the Snah s visit to Sistan in 1930, His Majesty had an interview with the Afghan Consul on the subject and is believed to have offered him the gift of some Afghan money which had been confiscated by the Customs (see Diary for November 1930, para. 108). It may be assumed that the Consul tried to deserve this financial assistance during the negotiations at Meshed, but was unable to induce the Consul-General to support him, and knowing that he could not influence the higher officials from Kabul, who accompanied the subsequent Com mission, considered it advisable to keep clear of the matter, and make the Consul- General the scapegoat to the Persians. 8 . Soviet Affairs. —There are indica tions that the Soviet Consulate General, Meshed, are taking renewed interest m Sistan Affairs. Last year the German Manager of the National Bank of Persia produced aquantity of silkworms in his private house, which were distributed to local Sardars with instructions as to their maintenance. It is believed he received Nese from the Soviet Consulate here and undertook the work on their behalf. En quiries have recently been made by the Soviet Consul-General, Meshed, as to the progress in production of silk. It now seems that the present manager of the National Bank is growing tobacco plants presumably for distribution in a similar manner. Coupled with rumours that the Russians desire to open trading concerns at Zabul, it may be assumed that the object is to start industries in which such a concern could show interest. There is little doubt that the establishment of a Russian trad ing firm would be followed by a demand for renewal of Consular representation, or alternatively the members of the firm would virtually carry out Consular duties. Russian members of the ‘ Sharq ’ com pany who visited Zabul last year announc ed that a branch would be opened here in the near future. The Soviet Consulate is being maintain ed in repair. C. K.

(1) His Majesty's Consular Officers .— Major J. A. C. May-Somerville accom panied by Mrs. Somerville arrived at Zahidan on the luth from India and proceeded to Meshed on the 20 th to assume charge of the post of Secretary to H. M. Consul-General. Major Somerville left Zahidan in good health but developed Pneumonia while en route to Birjand and arrived there seriously ill. Captain Shepherd, I.M.S., Officiating Medical Officer Zabul was despatched urgently to Birjand and Dr. Lichwart of the American Mission in Meshed also proceeded at once to attend him. The case appeared hopeless from the outset. Major Somerville had on a pre vious occasion suffered from Pneumonia and both lungs were affected. He rallied for about 24 hoars under emergency treatment but sank rapidly and died on 25th bein^ interred in the small Christian Cemetery in Birjand. Fortunately Mr. Dowling of the Anglo- Persian Oil Company was in Birjand proceeding on leave via India and he kindly undertook to escort Mrs. Somer ville back to India, No sooner had Captain Shepherd re turned to Zabul than he had again to be sent to Birjand to treat H. M. Vice- Consul, Jemadar Fazal Haque who be came seriously ill. The disease is at present obscure but certain indications point to Tvphoid. His infant son is also ill and his wife has but recently re covered from severe Pneumonia. Two further deaths from Pneumonia have occurred among the menial staff of this Consulate and the wife of one of the clerical staff has been very seriously ill. ENCLOSURE i *&gt; ) INDIA FOREIGN Lfittor 4,4 Dated 2&lt; MAR, 1832 Received 1 4 APR. 1852 His Majesty’s Consul proceeded on 11th on a short period of Casual Leave to India and returned accompanied by Mrs. and Miss Daly. (2) Wild rumours have been circulat ing regarding the operations against Remishk, but it is now certain that the Persians have been able to make no headway and by the end of the month it was reported that the force was being withdrawn to Kwash as the extreme heat rendered further operations impossible. Sardar Idu Khan was send back to Kwash about the 20th February. He is said to be ill. (3) Sistan .—The negotiations with the Afghans regarding the Helm and water distribution have proved fruitless. The Afghan Commissioners returned to Kabul about the middle of February and the Persians remained awaiting permis sion from Tehran, till the end of the month. ( Q j Shaukat-Ul-Mulk, thinking the negoti ations would last only a short time, de clined to accept from the government an allowance to cover expenses, and has in consequence of the great delay, suffered very considerable expense as the com mission apparently entertained all the local Sardars and their followers through out the whole period, as well as their own following which was considerable. Rumours are cm rent that the railway will shortly be re-opened to Zahidan and the Governor Zabul informed H. M. Consul that the Central Government was determined to open up Sistan District and comrempjated constructing a light railway line to Zahidan. Failing this they had determined to re-align the Zahidan-Meshed Road to make it passthrough Sistan and plans for the same had recently been made. This involves construction of a canal which would provide water across the desert stretch and also carry off surplus water which at certain seasons floods the country through which the road would pass. (4) Persian Officials.—Ahu\ Faiz Khan late Director of Customs Zahidan has retired on pension. Marghai a Customs Official has been appointed ‘ Inspector ’ of the Dazdap Customs. He was in Duzdap in 1923 and has a reputation for integrity. Naib Hadi Khan Nighaban Chief of Police Zabul has been transferred to Meshed and his place has been taken by Naib Ismail Khan Aatmi. Naib Sarbang (Lt.-Colonel) Hashmand 0. C. Road Guards in Sistan and Kain inspected the Zabul and Frontier Guards recently and returned to Birjand on 27th February. Syed Ali Khan, Masoom Khani, the New Civil Governor of Zabul has shown a desire to be friendly and apart from official visits has paid social calls on H. M. Consul. It is yet early to judge to what extent he can control local affairs, but in a number of small matters, even concern ing high handedness on the part of the military he has been able to take effec tive action. M. Delisse the new Director of Cus toms at Zahidan, a new recruit to the Customs Department evinces great zeal in the performance of his duties. He is handicapped by having no knowledge of Persian and is so afraid of the cumber some regulations that he interprets them in the narrowest sense possible. His Inspector at Mirjawa said of him to H. M. Consul “of course he is quite new, but we will soon cook him ”. Smuggling’ is 'freely indulged in by all the Motor Drivers on the Kundi Road to whom the price of the Officials at the frontier is well known. (5) Passports .—The issue of Long- period Visas to Indian Drivers on the Kuhdi Road started oil February 9th. The Persians are charging Krans 36/30 as the equivalent of 10 Gold Francs and^ in consequence H. M. Vice-Consul has been instructed to demad an equivalent fee from Persian Drivers. Some French and Arab drivers working on the same road have been debarred from the con cession by the Persians on the ground that they have no reciprocal arrange ment with the governments concerned. As regards Arab drivers, subjects of British Protectorate or Mandated terri tory a reference has been made by the local officials to Tehran. ( 6 ) Local J^ews .—The Persians have decided to make public gardens at Mirjawa, Hadis, Sangoon and Kwash. On the 17th all Baluchis in Mirjawa were made to plough land in the vicinity of the railway for the purpose. As a result of the rumours that the railway would be re-opened to Zahidan Motor Lorry rates for freight have dropped 50 per cent. On the 15th February the Customs Officials at Mirjawa neglected to lock the office and left a cash box containing 1,509 Toman on the table. Next morn ing the box was missing. The culprits have not been traced. (7) British Travellers. —W. H. Buckley N. W. Railway Quetta visited Zahidan on the 31 st January to inspect the Rail way’s Water plant boilers. Mr. Osborne of the B. C. M. S. Zahi dan proceeded to Kerman on the 18th. Foreign Travellers .—Frau Schnoor, wife of the Manager National Bank Zabul arrived in Zabul on 7 th February from Germany. H. Karl Shumann, German, arrived at Zahidan on 9 th to assume charge of the National Bank Zahidan. He has come from Busbire. Herr Fricke has been oideted to report Tehran. It is said that he has not proved Persona Grata to the Persian Officials in Zahidan. C. K. DALY, Major, C.lE., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.CONFIDENTIAL.

His Britannic Majesty s Consul for Sistan and Kain, presents his compliments to the ioreign Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart, meat, and has the honour to forward the undermentioned documents. 1 Sistan Consular Diary for the month of January 1932. Locust Report for the Sistan Consulate Area for the month of January 1932. Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for January 1932. 1 . Persian Baluchistan .—The situation at Remishk is obscure. By January 10th the Persian troops had advanced from Ifanuj to within 3 days journey of Remishk. A later report was that an attack had taken place bat had been repulsed with some loss to the Persians. Sardar Abdul Hussain is stated to have so skilfully entrenched a position in the valley leading to Remishk that the Persians could not locate the trenches. It is estimated that with the advent of Barkat Khan of Bint and Nawab Khan and Saidi Khan of Ab-i-Khurran there are some 3,000 tribesmen opposed to the troops. Towards the end of the month a report was received that in endeavouring to effect the recovery of some camels looted by Abdul Hussain’s men fKe Persian soldiers were killed. The G. O. C. was then encamped at Chah Gaz. An unsuccessful attempt had been made to force the entrance to the Remishk Valley. A further uncon firmed report stated a Sultan and 20 men were despatched from Rodbar to open negotiations with Abdul Hussain, but the latter’s followers attacked the party at night, killing several and taking the Sultan as a prisoner to Remishk. After this the G. O. C. sent one Mirza Hasham a former accomplice of the late Dost Mahomed Khan, to request Abdul Hussain to refrain from fighting and to visit the G. O. C., who undertook to confirm his position as Sardar and to appoint him as Deputy Governor of Remishk. Abdul Hussain seems to have been too sharp to fall into this typical Persian trap. It may be assumed that the G. O. 0. had no intention of keeping his promise, and sent back a message that he was prepared to fight to the last, X unless the G. O. C., with Idu Khan wmuld visit Remishk Valiev to nego tiate. This the G. O. C. of course' de clined to do. Nosherawan Khan, brother of the late Dost Mahomed is said to have promised Abdul Hussain support. Altogether the situation is fraught with unpleasant possibilities for the G. O. C. and should he suffer any consider able reverse he may well have the whole of Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhadi’s allied against him. 2. Sistan .—The Helmand water and boundary commission is still at work. The month has been passed in touring the disputed border and although no reliable news has yet been forthcoming it appears that the members of the com mission are not finding matters so simple of solution as at first anticipated. The new Governor told His Majesty’s Consul that the Persians had, since the Shah’s visit, definitely decided to develop Sistan. The first step is to be the con struction of a metalled road which will link Zahidan with Meshed via Zabul and it is hoped also to link the latter place with Kandahar by road. Such a scheme would certainly provide means of outlet for the gram of Sistan, but it remains to be seen whether the necessary funds for road construction will be forthcoming. 3. Perso-Indo Frontier .—At the end of December the Persian Customs clerk at Mirjawa, with two servants, went to Kila Sufaid and checked the effects of the British Levies in the Port, presum ably with the intention of discovering if they had goods destined to be smug gled over the border. They saw at the fort, some camels which had transported petrol from Nokkundi and wanted to take them to Mirjawa is. corre beene«fl ^%3 mom foreign sefcivf no 33 MMi1932 Letter Dated [ 3 The Le vies, who, seem to have ant as regardstheir personal belongings, objected to this and some alteration appears to have taken place and the Customs clerk returned after abusing the Levies and declaring rhat the boundary was at Juzzak. 1 / X A protest was made to the Director of Customs at Zahidan, and the latter stated he had issued orders to his sub ordinates not to cross the Biver-bed which is temporarily recognised as the boundary. Up to the end of January the issue of long-period Visas to British drivers who have to cross the frontier to Kundi, had not been started at Zahidan, although the procedure has long been sanctioned by the Central authorities. Nevertheless the Central authorities saw fit to address a complaint to H. M. Legation, that we were not reciprocating as regards Persian drivers. The ostensible reason for not issuing these Visas, is that the police were unaware of the Kran equivalent of 10 gold Prancs and had to refer to Meshed. It could, of course, have been ascertained from the local banks. About 10 th January he was instructed to charge Krans 3o/70. This did not however satisfy the Police, who then again referred to Meshed to enquire, whether the same rule was to apply to French drivers. The actual reason for all this is that as long as the Head of the Police has the power to issue Visas for each trip, he is in a position to require each driver to smuggle to him from India some small perquisite, such as clothing, shoes, etc., whereas once Long-term Visas start he will be in a less easy position in the matter. Smuggling is rife all along the border and it may be assumed that the with drawal of the railhead is costing the Persians a very great deal. Rumour has it that the G. 0. C. in the Sarhad, and some other officials, have a very efficient service of smugglers under their control and for this reason will no doubt use all their influence in Tehran to oppose the return of the railway to Zahidan. vX 4. Registration of Foreigners .—At long last the necessary forms have arrived, and registration of foreigners for “ Permits de Sejour” has commenced both at Zahidan and Zabul. 5. Legal .—The local courts continue to be as corrupt as ever. A number of cases of attempted oppression of British subjects have occurred at Zabul, but have been settled as the result of energetic protests from this Consulate. As an example—A Kurrami barber was forcibly taken from his shop to the military barracks and made to bake bread all night for the troops. He was given no pay. The following morn ing troops again appeared at his shop, but by a ruse he contrived to get away to the Consulate. The man was kept in the Consulate until his pay w T as forthcoming and an undertaking not to interfere with him was procured. The naive excuse of the military officer was that “ He would not have done it had he known the man was a British subject,” actually he is a “ British protected person 6 . Persian Military Affairs —Some 100 time-expired conscripts returned to their homes in Birjand from Meshed in January. Sarhang Pathullah who visited Zabul in connection with the alleged venality of the late Governor, Yawar Shuja Nizam, returned to Tehran. Owing to the constant desertions to India the G. O. C. has ordered the Cantonment Commandant at Mirjawa to prohibit his men from intercourse with Indian officials there. The conscripts from Zabul this year consist solely of the riff-raff, who were unable to find the means of purchasing their escape. Practically the only exceptions were a few of the menial staff of this Consulate w ho were conscripted presumably with the intention of demonstrating how impartially the law is administered. 7. Consulate Land .—An Indian firm who have for some years been permitted to lease a piece of land belonging to the Consulate, on which they had built a house, at their own risk, recently in contravention of the terms of their agreement, sublet the house to the Afghan Consul. The first intimation H. M. Consul had had of this was the hoisting of the Afghan flag in the build ing. The Afghan Consul, who had only two days previously visted H, M. Consul, made no mention of the matter, although he well knew the land to belong to this Consulate. He also chose to move into his new quarters at night. H. M. Consul called on him and ex plained that the house could not be sub let and consequently requested him to leave. To permit the sub-letting might cause complications under the Law of Property owned by Foreigners. The Afghan Consul duly moved out.The Governor has now made * back door ’ requests to be permitted to occupy the house, but has been asked to write on -^the subject, to enable the matter to be Referred for sanction. This he has not done. Meanwhile the Indian firm is bankrupt and cannot continue to pay the rent of the land, and possession has been recovered by the Consulate. 8 . Persian Officials .— Musaddiq-i- Diwan an err-official of the Ministry of Poreign Affairs has assumed charge of the office of Governor Zabul. Juma Khan Reis-i-Amnieh Zahidan has been transferred to Zabul. Mirza Sadiq Khan Bustami arrived at Birjand from Meshed on the 1 st to take over the appointment of Reis-i-Adlieh. The Reis-i-Nazmieh Birjand supple ments his salary by receipts from a gambling house which a servant runs on his behalf. One Rastine (?) an Excise official from Meshed has been checking Excise accounts at Birjand. He announced that firewood and coal would in future be sold under Municipal Supervision. The order was rescinded as the result of a display of truculence by the inhabitants who objected to pay the bribe of one Kran to the Municipal Official appointed to supervise sales. 9. Lawlessness .— Reference paragraph 5 Diary for December. The ReisT-Amnieh followed the robbers tracks and arrested one^ in British territory (a separate report of this occurrence has been made). The other was captured by British Levies and was sent to Zahidan by the Political Agent Chagai. The men have been sent to Birjand to stand trial. 10. Afghan Affairs. —The Afghan Consul Zabul has left on a visit to Chakansur. Shams-uI-Banat, sister of Inayatullah Khan, proceeded to Teheran from Zahidan on the 17th to live with her brother. She is the divorced wife of a Mahomedzai Sardar of Kabul. Afghans are busily engaged in smuggl ing goods into Persia all along the frontier. 11 . Communications. —Snow has block ed the Meshed-Zahidan road for some days during the month. The proposal to link Zahidan-Zabul- Birjand by road has been referred to under paragraph 2 . 12 . Foreign Travellers .— Masters Boris Aranofi and Boris Prank (Russian and Pole respectively) school-boys from a school in India proceeded from Zahidan to Meshed at the end of December. R. D. Jones —U. S. citizen, proceeded to India on 12th January. R. H. Jones— American tourist from Tehran, proceeded to India on 20th January. Max Ghetton, German—said to be a sculptor—‘arrived at Zahidan from Tehran on 20 th and left for India. Herr Pricke, Manager National Bank Zahidan paid a short visit to Zabul at the end of the month. 13. Miscellaneous .— The Governate Zabul has notified traders that the Import of Foreign cloth, the dye of which is not fast, is prohibited. All stocks of such material to be declared within one month, failing which the cloth will be liable to confiscation. The usual reception was held at H- M. Consulate on New Years Day. The Acting Governor and all Persian Officials, as well as British subjects and the Afghan Consul called. A similar reception at the Zahidan Vice-Consulate was attended by all Persian Officials in addition to the leading Persian and Indian traders. Rainfall in Zabul has been very slight this winter and the weather milder than for some years past. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain.Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Eain. Locust Report for January 1932. 1. No Locusts appeared in Sistan and Kain. 2. (A) On December 30th and 31st small swarms of Locusts, pink in colour arrived in the vicinity of Zahidan They were again observed from the 1 st to 3rd January. They arrived from the South- West and in the plains about Jaikooli Hill, some 4 miles from Zahidan very large swarms were seen. (B) Those which arrived on 30th and 31st December passed overhead flying North—very few settle—. The swarms of the 1st—3rd January alighted in the desert around the town and fed on wild vegetation for two days, whereafter they took flight Northwards. Many of the latter were killed by cold. (C) The weather at this period was windy but unclouded. Temperature 24*2 minimum and 5T5 Tah. maximum. (D) Eggs are reported to have been deposited in the sand on the slopes of the hill mentioned under A. This hill is devoid of any cultivation. (E and F).— Nil. Two specimens taken from the above swarms are being sent by post. The early arrival of these swarms passing Northwards would seem to indi cate that the cultivated areas of the Qainat and Khorassan are likely, later, to suffer from a serious invasion. It has been noted that when the winter season as far South as Zahidan and Sistan, is mild, as has been the case this year, the swarms which appear to originate far South in the warm climate of the deserts adjacent to the Persian Gulf, arrive early. Later swarms then seem to penetrate very far north, possibly because suitable feeding grounds have been visited by the earlier swarms. When the conditions are such that the winter is severe in the highlands about Zahidan, the first swarms arrive later and subsequent flights do not penetrate so far north. It may perhaps be presumed that when the weather in the hill belt about Zahidan is cold in early spring the swarms spread laterally along the shores of the Gulf and into British Mekran and Baluchistan— when it is mild, they cross the highland belt and enter the plains of North-East Persia. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain. OIPD -896(&amp;')F&amp;PD~ 25.2.22—13.CONFIDENTIAL. Diary o£ His Britannic Majesty’s Consulate for Sistan and . — 1. Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad. —On December 16th Sarhang Muham mad Khan left Bampur with his force for Remishk. He is said to have receiv ed instructions to push forward the attack as the Baluchis had commenced looting in several directions. He had, however, sent messages to Sardar Saidi Khan and the Nawab of Ab-i-Kharran, who were reported as preparing to assist- Abdul Hussain, to hand in their arms and wished to await their replies before commencing hostilities. The Baluchis captured 70 Persian Camelry who were on reconnaissance duty and carried them towards Remishk. Fifty men were sent to effect their rescue and fighting took place in which 15 Persian troops are said to have been killed and 5 wounded. The Baluch casualties are not known. Mirza Khan Bamri has secretly sent men to assist Abdal Hussain. The latter has seno his family and personal effects to British Mekran and his follow ers have taken up positions on the approaches to Remishk. Practically all the tribesmen of the Sarbaz area have offered assistance to the Remishk Sardar. Sardar Barkat Khan of Bint has threatened the life of Idu Khan if he continaes to assist the General Officer Commanding. The General Officer Commanding is ' reported to have despatched Sardar Habibullah Khan Reki to Sarbaz to report if the British tribes afford any assistance to the recalcitrant tribes. Mehrab Khan and Qadir Baksh of Hoshak have removed to British terri tory at Mand. The Officer Commanding at Dizzak sent troops in pursuit. They succeeded in securing their arms, but the individuals made good their escape. On the occasion of the recent despatch of British Levies to Qileh Sufaid, near the frontier at Mirjawa the General Officer Commanding at first decided thet they should be prevented from taking water from Mirjawa, but sub sequently cancelled the order. He has reported their presence to Tehran. Our Frontier Assistant at Mirjawa r recently reported that the General 1 Officer Commanding had sent men to ' clear the railway line of sand as far as Koh-i-laftan station, in British territory.. The General Officer Commanding when asked denied all knowledge of the matter. It seems probable that such attempts will be made from time to time, in the hope that they will pass unnoticed and may subsequently be used as evidence that the Persians maintained the line to the frontier which they seem prepared to claim, which is well within our tenitory. This being so, it will be necessary to protest should they repeat the experiment. 2 . His Majesty's Consular Officers .— Captain G. F. Taylor, Medical Officer and Vice-Consul at Zabul became seriously ill with pneumonia complicat- ed by typhoid and nearly succumbed to the disease before medical help was forth coming. Colonel Dickson, Chief Medical Officer in Baluchistan proceeded by Air to Nok Kundi and thence without stopping to ZabuL Captain Taylor, whose life was despaired of for some 10 days is now happily recovering. Colonel Dickson has returned to Quetta on relief by Capt. J. Shepherd, I. M. S. who is temporarily acting as Medical Officer and Vice-Consul at Zabul, until such time as Capt. Taylor will be fit to resume his duties. It is hoped that this will be about the end of March after a short period of leave in India. 3. Sistan and Qainat .—On December the 13th the Acting Governor at Zabul was transferred to Kwash and charge of the GovernorRe devolved temporarily on the Telegraph master. A ci vil Governor is said to be on his way from Tehran. He is reported as being an ^-Consul at Herat and recently employed in the Foreign Ministry. On December 18th the following members of a Commission to negotiate with the Afghans in regard to the Hel- mand water distribution, arrived at Zabul and proceeded a few days latter to the frontier.

Afghan Affairs.—Tho Afghans have recently established a number of small posts along the frontier. Such posts as originally existed have been reinforced. A p 'haas recently entered Persian terri tory at Chakao and endeavoured to establish a post there. They were- turned out by the local inhabitants, but retuin- ! ed later in lirger force. Sardar Khuda- dad Khan has been ordered to despatch 50 of his camel sowars to Chakao. No information has yet been received o their arrival there. The Afghan Consul, Zabul, recently went to Chakansur to confer with the representative of the Afghan Foreign Office who recently arrived there in connection with the w r ater dispute^. En subsequent conversation with H. M. Consul, he stated that he had not bt^en to Chakansur for some years and was much struck with the improvements which had been effected. 5. Lawlessness .—Three inhabitants of Zabul recently drew cash from a Bank in Zahida i and set &lt;mt lor Zabul. When th ee miles from Zahidan they were attacked by Baluchis. Two were killed and the third wounded. The robber are said to have made good their escape into Afghanistan, via Robat. 6 . Military Atf airs.—The conscrip tion Committee at Zabul recently caused consternation, by ordering all men of age for conscription, who had married without the permission of the military authorities to divorce their wives. \ Two Persian soldiers deserted and fled \into British territory about Djcember 20th. They were disarmed by our Levies at Juzzack and allowed to proceed to Kuneli. 7 . Persian Officials .—Mirza Hussain Khan Tambool, Reis-i-Maiieh at Zahi dan has been transferred to Kwash. He has been replaced by Murteza Khan Shahidi from Kwash. Hussain Khan Bosteh an official of the Court of Correction for officials arrived at Zahidan on 1st to enquire into the charges of corruption against Moosa Khan Kesravi, late Reis-i-Malieh. He is reported to have discovered nothing to the official’s disadvantage. As he remained in Zahidan as guest of Irbab Mehdi, a close personal friend of the accused, this outcome of the investi gation was to be expected. M, Ddycee, Belgian, arrived at Zahidan on 4th and assumed charge of the Customs from Abul Faiz Khan. He is inexperienced and at present so uncer tain of the complicated regulations that he is unable to take the smallest action without reference to Tehran. 8 .

His Brilannic Majesty s Consul for Sistan arid Kain presents his compliments to the Foreign secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, New Delhi, and lias the honour to forward the undermentioned documents :— Sistan Diary for November 1931. Diary o£ His Majesty’s Consulate Sistan and Kain lor November 1931. 100. Persian Baluchistan and Sarhad .— Supplies ate now being collected at Bampur for the impending operations against Bemishk. Transport is being com mandeered from Sistan as the G. 0. C. mistrusts the local camelowners, fearing they would desert when operations commenced. The following troops are to be em ployed :— From Kwash Fauj-i-Zabuli—Strength 600 including Camelry and Artillery. From Bam Fauj-i-Zabuli—Strength about 600 which includes 500 recent conscripts. From Bandar Abbas 500 from Kerman Brigade eight guns and eight machine guns. The landing ground at Kwash has been repaired and 4 aeroplanes are expected from Tehran. A portable wireless set has arrived at Kwash from Tehran. The foices of the Remkhk Sardar have been augmented by the following of Sardar Barkat Khan of Bint and of Sardar Saidi and his brother the Nawab of Ab-i-Khuran. As is usual in these cases a number of other Sardars are sitting on the fence and would throw in their lot with Abdul Hussain of Remishk should he gain an initial success against the Persians. 101. Sistan and Kain .—Considerable excitement was aroused in Sistan by the news that the Afghans were widening the old bed of the Nahr-i-Shah, which takes off from the Heimand in Afghan territory above the Band. This would draw off sufficient water to reduce by nearly half the cultivated area in Persian Sistan. The local Sardar* were encouraged to proceed in force to the frontier to nego tiate with the Afghans and all the principal Sardars left with their followers amounting finally to some 1,500 or 2,000 men. It is believed that they had secret instructions to fight if necessary and that they would eventually be supported by regular troops. The scheme was typically Persian. Should the unaided tribesmen succeed in defeating tne local Afghans, no troops need be employed. Should they be defeated, it would be open to the Persian Government to disown the action of these tribes, who for generations have been in the habit of settling their local disputes by force, or to send troops if the situation appeared promising. No sooner had they reached the fron tier than instructions were received from Tehran, evidently cancelling the arrange ment and the local Military Governor hastily recalled the tribesmen. Mean while an Afghan official from Chakansur has arrived in Sistan to discuss the matter and danger of hostilities appears to have passed. The Military Attache of the Persian Legation in Kabul is reported to have arrived at Chakansur in this connection. It is possible that the Persians ne ver intended to resort to bloodshed, but con sidered a show of force necessary to support the negotiations which have been proceeding for some months with the Afghans, as a result of which they hope to obtain a more generous share of Hein'and water than was allotted under the Macmahon settlement. The situation was complicated by the fact that the Sistan Sardars were greatly perturbed by the recent action of the Military Governor in arresting Malik Mahomed Ali Khan, one of their most influential members. He is related toShaukat-nl-Mulk. He has been under arrest for nearly a month, no definite charge having been brought against him. He is generally charged with having failed, as Deputy Governor of Miankhangi district, to maintain good order. Actually his difficulties are due to a private quarrel with the present Military Governor, and it was this quarrel which lead indirectly to the dismissal from the office of Governor of Samsam-Ud-Dowleh (vide paragraph 94 Diary for October). Some years ago Yawar Lutf Ali Khan, the present Governor, was in Sistun as an Amnieh Officer. He cultivated an area of Crown lands in the district. Subsequently he was transferred and the agreements with the cultivators terminat ing, the land lay follow for two or three years. Malik Mahomed Khan then leased the land, put in his followers as cultivators, dug water channels, etc. The Yawar recently returned to Sistan and claimed the right to cultivate the much improved land. The officials in Sistan took sides in the matter. Samsam-Cd-Dowleh supported the Sardar, as a 7 so apparently Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Commissary, although it is now believed the latter was secretly repor'ing against the Governor to Tehran and supporting the Yawar. The case was heard in the local court, and the Sardar, who doubtless paid dearly for the decision, won the case. The tables were shortly afterwards turned, by the military clique succeeding in securing the dismissal of Samsam-Ud- Dowleh and appointment of the Yawar as Officiating Military Governor. As was to be expected, he lost no time in aveng ing himself on Malik Mahomed Khan. This was the situation when the Helmand water crisis arose. The Sardars demanded as the price of their being prepared to take the offensive against the Afghans, the immediate release of the imprisoned Sardar. They were put off with the usual specious promises. The water question being of vital importance to them however they finally decided, in their own interests, to proce ed to the frontier. It was learnt that they intended to utilize the occasion to come to a secret agreement with the Afghans, and in the event of their failing to effect the release of Malik Mahomed Ali, to emigrate and take up land on the newly dug Nahr-i- Shah. Whether these negotiations fc took place is not yet known. It is certain that they view with distrust the dismissal of Samsam and arrest of Malik Mahomed both near relatives of Shaukat-Ul-Mulk, and realise that their hereditary positions are at stake. It is generally believed that the Shah determined on a policy of ousting the Sardars, when he visited Sistan last Autumn. 102. Soviet Affairs .—A Russian named Pravdin Alexander Garjrwieh arrived at Zahidan from Tehran on 3rd. He pro ceeded to Kerman for Bandar Abbas. He announced freely that the Russians had defeated the British as regards com mercial Interests in Persia, since their treaty with Persia had been signed where as the Anglo* Persian treaty was not concluded. 103. Law and Order .—On November 28th the shop, godown and private house of a Sikh at Zabul were surrounded by the police, who together with a Customs Official and a clerk from the court, searched the premises. No search warrant' was produced and from the questions put to the owner it is evident they were acting on some anonymous report. 1 hey then searched the house of another Sikh and removed a box containing 77 packets of Indigo, which the firm declare have been lying in the godown since 1924. They state none has been disposed of since the use of this dye was prohibited. A protest against this illegal action has been lodged and the matter will be separately reported. The villagers in Sistan are being much harassed by searches for opium. These searches are carried out solely to enrich the petty officials concerned. It is doubtful whether at any time in the past history of Sistan, the officials have been more corrupt than at present. 104. Persian Officials .—The Telegraph Master at Zahidan was recently dismis sed. A report received at Sistan was that his services had been dispensed with as he was suspected of passing informa tion to a source which reached this Consulate.

The new Governor of Sis tan was at first under the orders of the G. 0. C. Baluchistan Brigade. He has now been placed under the Ministry of Interior. Herr Acker—Hungarian—A water expert employed by the Persians is visit ing bistan accompanied by one ‘ Shirazi 5 who is believed to be Headmaster of a school in Meshed. They have visited the Band-i-Kuhak and are shortly to return to Meshed and submit a report. 105. Health .—A particularly virulent outbreak of Influenza has occurred at Sistan. The town and all surrounding villages are affected. Many deaths are occurring daily from Pneumonia. One member of the Clerical staff of this Consulate and four menials have died, and fully half the entire staff are at present sick several dangerously so. His Majesty’s Consul and the Vice-Con sul suffered from n ild attacks. Malaria which has not previously existed in Sistan became prevalent last summer and it is anticipated that it will increase next year. The town has large pits of stagnant water in which mos quitos breed. Hitherto mosquitos have been^ dispersed by the annual 4 Sad-o- Bist ’ wind. This wind was abnormally As a hign percentage of the population nas become infected it is feared that mosquitos will spread the disease in the spring. Tne sanitary department has ceased to operate. The Municipal -Doctor has been dismissed and arrange ments are now in the hands of the new Governor, who appears to dissipate his energies solely in grandiose schemes for disfiguring the town, and pays no atten tion to urgent matters of public health. 106. British Travellers. —Mr. A. R. Normand and wife, members of a bcottish Mission in Bombay arrived at Zahidan on October 28th and proceeded to Meshed. Foreigners. —Mr. Amiguet—Swiss—a painter arrived at Zahidan from Kerman on November 8 th. He will proceed to India in his own lorry, which is at pre sent, is broken down at Nasratabad Sipi. 107. Miscellaneous. —Bank notes are being called in by the National Bank at Zabul. Considerable fluctuations in exchange have caused uneasiness among Indian Importers, whose stocks were pur chased when the rate was over 600 Krans to Rs. 100. At Birjand £the sale of the monopoly for extracting Salt from Garm-ab and Talkh is advertised for sale. 108. Afghan Affairs. —The Helmand water dispute has been referred to in paragraph 101 above.

Persian Baluchistan ani Sarhad.— Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk con- tinues to raid caravans. The General Officer Commanding who was proceeding to Tehran on leave w?.s ordered to return from Kerman and prepare for operations against the Sardar, which are expected to begin about November 12 th. Stores for the advance from Kwash are now being collected. 50 men under a Sultan have been posted at Rodbar to intercept any Baluchis who might proceed from British territory to the assistance of Abdul Hussain. Barkat Khan of Bint has declared his intention to join forces with the Remishk Sardar. The latter is reported to have construct ed trenches along the boundary of his territory. Sardar Jahind Khan has returned to his home in Persian territory. The G. O. C. has gone to Bam to meet the G. 0. C. Kerman Brigade in connec tion with the operations to be under taken. Relatives of Lashkar Khan Gumshadzai recently raided into British territory and carried off 20 camels. Some of these have been recovered and the Persians are pursuing the matter. Mirza Khan Afghan, a notorious gun runner has recently been in the Sarhad. It is believed that he is purchasing some rifles from Idu Khan and Juma Khan Ismailzai. 94. Sistan and Kainat. —At Zabul camels have been commandeered to convey grain to Kwash for the Army. Samsan Ud Dauleh, the heriditary Governor of Sistan was suddenly relieved of the Governorship which has been taken over by Yawar Shuja-Ud-Dauleh of the Amnieh. Shaukat U1 Mulk has been unable to discover the reason for this, beyond private information from Tehran that H. M. The Shah consider ed he had been insufficiently energetic. There were however indications that this is the beginning of a policy long contem plated in Tehran, and that the Sardars of Sistan will probably be deprived of their tenure of crown lands, which will be distributed among their followers, from whom Revenue will be collected direct. The Police at Zabul have been very active in compelling the Baluchis to adopt the Kullah Pehlave and are now forbidding them to wear the usual buggy trousers and are insisting on trousers of European style. As a result the villagers have ceased bringing supplies to the town and there is a great shortage of wood for fuel. 95. Persian Military Affairs. —Cons cription committees have been busy at both Birjand and Zabul. With the exception that the cost of securing exemption appears to have increased, their operations seem to be conducted in much the same manner as last year, which results in only the poorest persons being conscripted. 95. Persian Officials. —Shah Reza Khan from Zahidan Customs has been appointed Head of Customs at Zabul. 97. Communications. —The road from Railhead at Nok Kundi to Mirjawa is row so bad that it will shortly become impassable for lorries. The Zahidan-Zabul road has not been repaired since the Shah’s visit last year and is in a deplorable condition. It is reported that the Persians intend to seriously push on the Construction of the Chahbar-Kwash road. 98. Movements of British subjects .— Mr. W. M. H. Dowlong, Anglo Persian Oil Company returned from India on 16th. Mr. Douglas Sandes, I. B. P., Meshad left Zahidan for India on 15th. Mr. G. Wright, I. B.

Persian Baluchistan and the Sarhad .—Abdul Hussain, of Bemishk looted another caravan during the first week of September, carrying off 60 camels. It is rumoured that on the return of the General Officer Command ing from Tehran, operations will com mence against him, in which both the Kwash and Kerman troops will be em ployed. During the absence of the General Officer Commanding and Military Governor, who has proceeded on two months’ leave to Tehran, Yawar Aziz Dllah Khan of the Khusravi Fauj (Camelry) will be acting Governor. Umar Khan, son of the late Dost Mohammad Khan is living at Shasto. He has taken possession of all his late father’s land and is said to be popular with the tribesmen. The newly-raised Amnieh in the Sarhad have been given uniforms. The men previously dismissed have received six months pay of the yea v s salary due to them. A report has been received to the effect that Habib Ullah Khan, Nawab of Kharan, has put forth a claim to the greater part of Eastern Persian Baluehis- (I tan based on documentary evidence that bb his Grandfather Azad Khan ruled there fifty years ago. The General Officer Commanding is said to have received urgent instructions from Tehran to send a reliable messenger to the Nawab offer ing a substantial sum if he will with draw his claim. 87.

A Zabul trader who works for the Russians and is in Meshed also wrote to his son in Zabul that he would return in the com pany of the Russian Consul shortly. 89. Military Affairs .—-ISO men of the Zabuli Fauj were sent from Zahidan to Kwash on 8 th September. A compounder in the Military hospital at Mirjawa and two soldiers from Kwash deserted to British territory between 15th and 18th S eptember.

It is reported that the regulation; are being more strictly en forced than last year when large num bers evaded service on inadequate grounds. On September 5th a Persian soldier at Zahidan in charge of a prisoner demand ed to be carried in a lorry belonging to an Indian, going to Kundi. The lorry was full and the owner suggested he might travel in another lorry of his which was being loaded and would follow later. The lorry then started and the soldier fired his rifle—apparently in the air—although some witnesses believed the bullet hit the lorry. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul protested immediately and the Cantonment Commandant assured him that the man had been severely reprimanded and that there would be no further incidents of the nature. 90.

The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— Idu Khan has proceeded to Mashkel to attempt to bring about agreement between the Yarmuhammadzais and the Gumshad- zais. Abdul Hussain of Renushk conti nues to ccmmit dacoities. About mid- July he looted a caravan frcm Rodbar, taking 25 camels and murdering two of the men of the caravan. The G. 0. C. has stated that action will be taken against him in the autumn. Sardars Saidi Khan and Nawab Khan, on the advice of other Sardars of Bampur district were recently prepared to surrender, but have been dissuaded by Abdul Hussain and continue recalcitrant. Four Sardars of the Shaiki tribe of Nar- jnasar recently visited the G. 0. C. to complain against the harsh treatment of the Military authorities of Kerman. The G. 0. C. has allowed them to settle on the Kwash side of Narmasar, within his own ju risdiction, on the understanding that they provide Levies for Ab-i-Reis, Samsor, Warkoh and Kwash, which terms they have accepted, to escape persecution from Ker man. Idu Khan having failed to make terms between the tribes as descrited above, later returned to Kwash. Jahind Khan and his tribesmen, now at Mashkel are said to be determined to emigrate to Afghanistan. A complaint by the Baluchis at Jalk that the Reis-i-Malieh had collected revenue in excess is being enquired into by the G. 0. C. A curious rumour has spread among the Baluchis to the effect that the Persian Government has adopted Bolshevik princi ples and that future laws will be framed after the Soviet example. The G. 0. C. has authorised the Revenue authorities to collect a tax of one Kran per 'sheep and two and a half Krans per from the Baluchis, An order has also been JHCS40FD ENCLOSURE !N INDIA FOREIGN SECRHARY’S Letter No 035 .1. | Dai so 1 2 4 SEP; *1931 12 jUI. 1931 promulgated to the effect that they must cease their nomadic life and build houses. Jahind Khan recently sent his son Bijar Khan to Lagasht to see the representative of the Nawab of Kharan. They were detained by the Levies at Sotagan, while the matter has been referred to the Assistant Politcal Agent at Panjgur. 75. Sistan and the Kainat. —A rumour is current in Sistan that difficulties have arisen between the Persians arid the Afghans in regard to the distribution of the Helmand water and that the latter have threatened to cut off the supply of Persian'Sistan. The Amnieh in Sistan have been instruct ed to be vigilant in checking smuggling which is said to be already assuming con siderable proportions. Goods enter Sistan from Kundi via Afghanistan. 76. Afghan Affairs. —The Governor of Birjand has announced that the Afghan Government have asked for the loan of the services of two expert carpet weavers. Appli cations have been called for and it is stated that the Persian Government will settle the terms of their employment before permitting them to proceed to Afghanistan. The Afghan Consul, Sistan celebrated Afghan Independence Day by a reception. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul was invited. Later, all Afghans in Zabul were sum moned to the Consulate and King Nadir Shah’s speech at the opening of thi Mejlis was read to them, after which booklets were distributed which contained a brief history of Afghanistan. 77 . Persian Military Affairs. One hundred and fifty men of the Kwash garri son have recently been dismissed as being unfit, by reason of age, for further service. Yawar Khabirzadeh, Accountant, Balu chistan Brigade has proceeded on leave to Meshad.2 Sultan Boi Khan, late Cantonment Com- mander at Zahidan lias been transferred in the same capacity to Bam. Sultan Hasran Agha Karimi, Reis-i-Am- nieh, Zahidan, hae been transferred to Ker man. Hassan Khan, son of Sardar Haji Juma Khan of Zabul has replaced him. 78 Persian Officials .— Yaqub Khan ar rived at Birjand on 17th from Turbat to assume charge of the post of 1 ublic Prose- mi tor. Dr Vladimirofi, white Russian, and now a Persian subject, who was formerly a dis penser in the Russian Consulate Hospita at Sistan, was appointed to be Medical Officer to the troops m Birjand, but tne terms under which he was prepared to serve were not approved and Naib Mahmud Khan arrived from Meshad to take over the duties. Mirza Moosa Khan Godarzi, Reis-i- Adlieh (Judge) of Birjand, has proceeded on leave. His assistant is acting. The Reis is very unpopular with the other officials, being unique as far as Birjand officialdom is concerned, in refusing to accept douceurs. The Governor of Sistan paid a short visit to Birjand recently. His object was to endeavour to form a company to supply the town with electricity by a new machine he has recently imported, and also to run a Cine- matoora.ph Show with the films which remain on his hands from his Zabul venture. These films were purchased second-hand from a London firm about two years ago. They were extremely bad when first received and have since had rough usage, so that the success of the company in Birjand is doubt ful. ; The Governor called on H. M. Consul privately. The Governor of Birjand has been granted two months' leave. He is living at a country house at Furq some fifty miles from Birjand. H. M. Consul was recently invited to spend a few days there and was hospitably enter tained and taken for tours in the neighbour hood. Agha Asghar Saulati has been appointed TelegraplvMaster at Mirjawa and has open ed an office there. It is reported that three engineers re cently visited the Zahidan-Mirjawa section of the Railway and submitted a report to Tehran on the feasibility of running motor trucks on the existing line. As the gradient is steep, it is doubtful whether such a scheme could be made to pay. It would also be. practically useless unless the railway line connected at Mirjawa. MC540FD Mossa Khan Kesravi-Reis-i-Malieh at Zahidan, who is under suspension is pro ceeding to Tehran in connection with the charges of corruption made against him. 79. Lawlessness .—In Sistan robberies with violence and housebreaking have again increased. Tire Frontier Commissary has been empowered to try robbers by Martial Law and punish them summarily. 80. A Russian refugee named Ibrahim : Mohamed was recently taken to Zahidan to be put across the border into British terri- tory. On permission to enter India being refused by H. M. Vice-Consul under instruc tions from H. M. Consul, the individual was returned to Meshad on 4th August. H. M. Vice-Consul at Zabul reports that ( he has learnt that a Soviet Consul is shortly- expected at Zabul and that a Russian firm intend to open there with the object of buying raw silk. In this connection it is interesting that the Manager of the National Bank of Persia at Zabul, some time back was rearing silk worms which were distributed to the Sardars in Sistan. The Manager spoke Russian fluently, and it may perhaps be assumed that he was acting in a private capacity for the Russians. He has since returned to Germany being dissatisfied with the terms of his contract with the Bank. It is reported that Baluch shopkeepers in the Sarhad are increasingly dealing in Russian piece-goods, which are cheap and find a ready sale among the Baluchis. 81. Communications. —Consequent on earthquake shocks at Quetta and damage to the main line, no mails have been received from India during the last week of August. An engineer has arrived at Zahidan to execute repairs to the Zahidan-Mirjawa road, which under increased traffic is rapid ly becoming impassable. After completion of this work he is to ta 1 e in hand the construction of a motor ror d from Kwash to Iransheher via Karvmdak and thence to Chahbar. This scheme lias long been pressed upon the Government by the G. O. C. partly as an offset to depend ency on the Railway and partly as a means of pacifying the area through which road will pass. A serious accident occurred between Zahidan and Mirjawa. A lorry driven by a Sikh named Jai Singh, employed by Jaw r ala Singh of Quetta, the postal con tractor, was upset while travelling at speed. The driver nad no license, to uiive and has been arrested. All the occupants3 ^Infill j %.

Mrs. Miall, a British nurse was injured and has been admitted to hospital at Quetta. One Budh Singh who had his forearm shattered Jnd refused to allow amputation has been sent to Quetta. It is doubtful if he will recover. All the Sikhs have stated they bring no charge against the driver, but there can be no doubt but that the lorry was loaded with the centre of gravity too high. It is not yet known whether Mrs. Miall will endeavour to claim damages, but in view of the fact that all the other passengers were friends or relatives of the accused it will be a difficult matter to con vince a Persian court of the culpability of the driver. On 23rd August an Armenian driver knocked down a Baluch near Zahidan. The man’s leg had to be amputated. The driver was held not to have been at fault. Anybody who has experience of the drivers on the Meshad-Zahidan road can confirm that they habitually drive in a dangerous manner, with no regard whatsoever for other traffic on the road. 82. Movements—British Subjects. —Mr. and Mrs. Brenchley B. C. M. S. Zabul have proceeded to India on leave. 83. Movement s—F oreigner s. —H. Duckstein, Inspector, National Bank has been visiting the branches at Zahidan, Zabul and Birjand. Herr Trappe—German—said to be a cotton expert—is staying with H. E. Shaukat U1 Mulk. He was for many years in Russia. He was visited by his wife and daughter, from Meshad, for a short time. They were also accommodated at Shaukat’s house. Madame Cornelli—Russian—married to an Italian has been staying, together with her young son and her mother, with Shankat U1 Mulk. Ostensibly she was engaged to teach his daughters dancing. The husband is said to own a Cafe in Tehran and the lady is a professional dancer. She returned to Tehran on August 20th. A somewhat dis graceful scene, practically a brawl, appa rently took place at the house of the Manager of the National Bank, before her departure. The lady was dissatisfied with the remuneration offered by Shaukat and made a ‘scene’. H. M. Consul, who had previously noted that the affair was likely to end unpleasantly, had foNrtunately been able to concoct a suitable excuse for not being present at this farewell party. Subse quently the lady received 500 Tomans and two pairs of carpets, in addition to the three of them having been kept and lavishly enter tained for over two months. Shaukat U1 Mulk, who since the death of his mother last year has deteriorated and been drink ing somewhat heavily, appears to be-dis illusioned and c under doctors orders ’ is, for the time being, a teetotaller. Miss Kaminsky—Russian—now natu ralised Persian subject—sister-in-law to Amanullah Mirza, Amir-i-Laskar, ‘ who is now on leave in France, is also staying with Shaukat U1 Mulk and teaches in the local Girls’ school. Her father was in pre war days the Russian Consulate doctor at Zabul. Although the lady is far from being attractive’, it is rumoured that there are signs that Shaukat, who appears to wish to be in the prevailing fashion and to have a Russian wife, may espouse her. It is also rumoured that a marriage is con templated between Amanullah Mirza and one of Shaukat’s daughters—so that the mutual arrangement may, in Shaukat’s case, indicate a desire to obtain powerful friends at Court. K. Michel (Czechoslovak) —tourist—passed through Birjand for Zahidan on 6th August. Benjamin Not ley James—^American— journalist from the New York ‘ Tribune ’ proceeded to India on 4th en route Afghanis tan. M. G. A. Malraux (Journalist) and Madame Malraux—French—proceeded to India at the end of July. Antenio Zetto—Italian tourist—arrived from India on 4th and proceeded to Meshad. Saif-i-Azad, son of Ghulam Hussain— Persian—editor of the Persian paper ‘ Iransheher ’ published at Berlin, arrived at Zahidan from Bombay on 4th and pro ceeded to Meshad. This individual appears to be very anti- British. In conversation at Zahidan he stated that he had met a British Political officer at Bombay, but had told him that he visited him merely as a friend, and expected to be treated as an equal. Presumably he visited the officer in search of ‘ News ’. He further stated that he was at the Taj Mahal Hotel when Gandhi came in. The British officers present all rose and saluted him but Gandhi did not return their salu tation. He further stated that he had been personally instructed by H. I. M. the Shah to visit India and to induce wealthy Parsees to return to Persia. He had not succeeded in his mission. M. Walker (Czechoslovak)—tourist—ar rived at Zahidan from Meshad on 3rd and proceeded to Kerman. M. Graux, late Provincial Director of Customs, Zahidan, .-went to Nok Kundi on11 th and returned with Mdlle Anna Jonescu, with whom he proceeded to Europe, on leave, via Meshad on 15th. 84. Miscellaneous News .—The Persian Newspaper Iran of 2nd Murdad (25th July) published a long article entitled ‘The question of Bahrain Isles and the Policy in connection with the Persian Gull which is, of course, strongly cm^-British. Passengers who arrive at Mirjawa after office hours are charged one Kran each by the Customs Official who checks the bag gage. An official receipt is given, so that the charge has presumably been autho 11054 7FD—25—GEW rised. As most passengers travel at night in the hot weather the charge seems most unfair and an extra clerk should be em ployed for night work. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty s Consul.

His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, presents his compliments to the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla, and has the honour to transmit the undermentioned documents :— Diary for July 1931. Locust Report July 1931. Diary of His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for July 1931. • 65. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchis- tdn .—The Yarmuhammadzais and Gum- shadzais are on bad terms. The G. 0. C. has ordered Idu Khan to reside at Mashkel for a considerable time and to attempt to reconcile these tribes. Jahind Khan Yar- muhammadzai Sardar is annoyed at delay in receipt of his subsidy and threatens to emigrate to Afghanistan. It is said that he has been offered land at Kwaja Ah. The two Rekis, mentioned in a previous diary as having been arrested for the murder of a butcher at Kwash, were brought to Zahidan and together with a soldier, believ ed to have been a recaptured deserter, were shot at the Military barracks about midnight on July 6th. The barracks are immediately adjacent to His Majesty s Vice-Consulate and the G. 0. C. shewed some lack of consideration for the inmates by carrying out these executions, witnout warning, just outside the garden wall. The band played loudly for over half an hour, presumably to drown the noise of the execu tions as far as possible and after each execu tion a party of buglers, playing loudly, accompanied the burial parties or some distance into the desert. The G 0. C. subsequently apologised to H. M. Vice-Consul for any inconvenience that might have been caused. The Reve nue Department have collected Revenue from the Baluchis in the Sarhad at the rate of mans per Kharvar of the harvest. 66. His Majesty’s Consular Officers.-- H. M. Consul visited Zahld ^ n f J T ° 1 ^ r vice _ 10th July and accompanied by • Consul at Zahidan, visited Mnjawa on 8th in connection with the withdrawa Railway. At an interview wi^the a O- U the latter again asked H- ■ (Jeter request the Baluchistan authorises to ^ as far as possible, Persian Baluchis 1 emigrating to British territory. He added that he had received applications from Baluchis in British Baluchistan who wished to enter Persia but had discouraged them. It is extremely unlikely that any such offers to enter Persia have been received by the G. 0. C. The conditions in Persian Balu chistan must be too well known to the tribes in India to induce such emigration. H. M. Consul replied that the influx of Persian. Baluchis was rather a source of embarrassment to the Government of India and they were offered no encouragement whatever, but that it was impossible for us to turn them back at a desert frontier, but it was hoped that under his wise rule such emigration would be less evident in future. 67. Persian Officials.—M A. Graux, Direc tor of Customs, Zahidan, proceedea to Quetta on 9th and returned on 14th July. He had been refused leave, but is believed to have represented to Tehran that he desired to arrange with the Baluchistan authorities for the prevention of smuggling after with drawal of the Railway. The real motive of his visit was however purely personal to accompany Mile. Jonescu, a member of a theatrical troupe, who had remained at Zahidan with M. Graux after departure of the troupe to India. As this lady had the entire funds of the troupe, it is not Imown how the remainder of the party will fare m India without funds. M. Graux appears to have adopted Mile. Jonescu as his Mistress and to have arranged for her to re-join him on his return from leave to Europe. jy® an ' while she has a visa valid for a limited time only in India and M. Graux has informed the Quetta police that he holds himself res ponsible for her maintenance should she be permitted to remain in India after expiry of her visa. She is of Rumanian nationality.

He is an amiable and inefficient old man who was not above accepting the meanest bribe. 68. Soviet activities. —The following mem bers of the 4 Sharq coy. visited Zahioan on 10th and proceeded to Zabul on 12th July :— (1) Waniloff Minyas, (2) Ditroff Sargai, (3) Tibrokoff Wizal, and Urii Waladimir. They had a letter of intoduction from Razza- qoff, a Meshed trader, to his brother who is employed in the Zahidan firm of Dost Muhammad Khan, Tokhi. The latter deals mostly in Russian goods. Both at Zahidan and Zabul they collected samples of wool and of Foreign imported cloths. No. 1 is said to have spent four years at Herat. 69. A Russian refugee, named Ibrahim Mohamed, was sent to Zahidan under escort with orders from the G. 0. G, Amnieh to put him across the border into India. He stated that he was an ^-officer of the Russian army, whose relatives had been killed by the Bolsheviks. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul was instructed to refuse a visa whereupon the local autho rities said that a mistake liao been made and that the man had left Meshed without per mission and would be sent back. About the same time it was rumoured that a large number of refugees had left Meshed for Zahidan, but were turned back by the Amnieh—doubtless on receipt of news from Zahidan that permission to enter India could not be obtained. Rumours have been persistent in Sistan lately that the Russians intend to re-open their Consulate at Zabul. This may have been spread by the ‘ Sharq ’ representatives referred to above. On the other hand the Governor of Sistan, at present on a visit to Birjand, informed H. M. Consul that he had no official information on the subject. 70. Afghan Affairs. —Captain Tafazul Hussein, of Gwalior Imperial Service Troops, arrived at Zahidan from Mecca on 17th. He stated that while at Mecca he had seen ex- King Amanullah sweeping the ‘ Haram ’—a duty, which according to Muhammadan belief should be performed only when the assistance of the Almighty is required in an important undertaking. 71. Communications. —The road from Mirjawa to the new Railhead at Nok Kundi is reported to be in extemely bad condition. From Mirjawa to Zahidan H. M. Consul found it in moderately good repair, but stretches exist which will rapidly deteriorate with the increased traffic which can now be expected. At the request of H. M. Consul the local authoritis at Zahidan have referred to Teh- # ran a proposal that Indian lorry drivers working as far as Nok Kundi should be given annual Visas at Zahidan. No Teply has yet been received and for the time being f such drivers would be obliged to proceed to Quetta to obtain a visa from the Persian Vice-Consul there to enable them to return. All railway staff at Zahidan and Mirjawa were withdrawn by July 10th. Persian traders at Zahidan state that they have received news from Tehran that the railway j may be re-opened as the Persian Govern- ! ment now desire to agree to tSe majority of the conditions required by the Government of India. H. E. Shaukat U1 Mulk informed H. M. Consul that he had written to the Foreign Minister expressing the opinion that Persia would lose heavily by the withdrawal. Meanwhile Indian traders are jubilant and expect increased trade from Kundi via Afghanistan and they will, moreover, be able to maintain only agencies in Persia and headquarters at Kundi thus avoiding all the restrictions of the Persian Monopoly Law, passport control, etc. Agents will keep them informed of the state of the local mar ket to enable them to anticipate require ments, while the onus of getting goods into Persia will rest on the Persians in the case of direct import by them and the Afghans as regards smuggled goods. 72. Foreign travellers. —Herr Max Rysikha and Fraulein Anna Koehler arrived at Zahidan from India by motor cycle and proceeded to Birjand on 1st July. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty's Consul.

The G. 0. d is referring cases of raiding, etc., to tribal Jirgas, e.g., a recent case in which three Ismailzais attacked a caravan of Sardar Zama Khan of Dehlegan. They were arrested and sent under escort to Galooga where a £ Jirga ’ was ordered to assemble. A similar case in which some Ismailzais stole came 1 s from members of their own tribe is being disposed of in the same manner. Muhammad Umar Khan (see paragraph 49, Diary for May) has proceeded jto Shastun. The property belonging to his father Dost M. Khan and his uncle Nowshera wan has been restored to him. The above incidents point to the G. 0. C. adopting a concilia tory attitude to the tribes. Sardar Saidi Khan of Ab-i-Khuran and his brother Nawab Khan are reported to have taken 100 men to the hills near Geh and to be refusing to comply with the G. 0. C.’s orders. 59. Sistan and the Qainat. —A quarrel occurred in Sistan between Sardar Ali Khan and Sardar Mohd. Reza Khan over land, which resulted in several of their followers being wounded. Sarhang Mur- teza Khan proceeded to the scene of the fight with Amnieh and is enquiring into the case. The Reis-i-Malieh of Sistan is bringing pressure on the local Sardars to pay arrears of Revenue which amount to so large a sum that payment is quite im possible to realize. Sarhang Murteza Khan is supporting the Sardars and has repeatedly reported to Tehran that recovery of Reve nue which has been outstanding for years is impracticable. It had been expected that H. I. M. The Shah would announce remission of the demand when he visited Sistan last year, but the matter was appa rently potsponed until the receipt of the report of the Commission which to consider agricultural conditions in the province. In Birjand one Beant Singh, a British I Indian subject, recently lost his passport. He believed he left it at the police station to which he had paid a visit. The Reis-i-Nazmieh denied any know ledge of the passport, whereupon Beant Singh reported the loss at the Vice-Consulate | and offered a reward for its recovery. The Reis-i-Nazmieh had on a previous occasion had a difference of opin’on with Beant Singh. Some days later a Persian re turned the passport and claimed the reward, but it was significant that the person was an intimate friend of the Police Officer. He was unable to give any satisfactory reply as to why he had not returned the passport earlier. H. M. Consul was about to write to the local Governor asking that an enquiry be made, when it was learnt that Beant Singh had already asked a member of his firm to make an official complaint to the Governor- General at Meshed. As a result of this the Police Officer was summoned to Meshed and an official has now been sent to Birjand to investigate the matter. As, however, this official is said to be a relation of the local Police Officer the result of the enquiry is likely to exonerate him. Subsequent information is to the effect that an adverse report is being made. 60. Persian Military Affairs .—200 cavalry arrived at Zabul on 11th from Kwash. It is believed that the Infantry from Sistan who have been in the Sarhad will be sent to Kerman. %5 Balluch soldiers (regulars) who lost some of their ammunition were dismissed from the service. A party of 30 under a Lieutenant ar rived at Zahidan from Kwash on 29th May and proceeded later to Bam to train .conscripts enrolled therefor the Baluchis tan Brigade. Sultan Boi Khan has been appointed 0. C., Cantonments at Zahidan. The following troops arrived at Zahidan from Kwash during the month—190 In fantry and Artillery with two guns and 25 cavalry—the strength at Zahidan is now 355. Sultan Hamid Nizam and Naib Mahmud Khan who are under suspension, accused of embezzlement of official funds have been sent to Meshed under escort. Yawar Iskandar Khan is also being sent there Irom Tehran in the same connection. The G. Q. C. has apparently so far succeeded in avoiding being involved. 61. Persian Officials .—The officials who have been examining the Zahidan Revenue and Customs Accounts have placed Moosa Khan, Kisravi, the Reis-i-Malieh under LNuLCSU:.': !N INDIA F0R£i3N ' T r- ' ' Loiter i\L JO Dated . .. „jL.

Graux and they took a certain amount of evidence of bribery. Some witnesses are said to have been British Indian Traders. It is well known locally that when the Government of India, some months “back, permitted the re-export of a large quantity of sugar to India, without insisting on a refund of drawback of Indian Customs, which had been paid, the Indians made a handsome present to the whole of the Persian Customs staff under the impression that no difficulties would then be raised as regards the export. In re turn, it is believed that many of the mer chants paid Customs storage at c out door ’ rates, whereas their sugar had been 1 stored under cover. Later the Examiners were ordered to return to Tehran and were told that they had exceeded their powers in recording evidence of bribery, but that other officials would be sent to continue an enquiry. M. Graux is due for leave at the end of July, but has apparently been ordered to report at Tehran. His relief is expected shortly from Meshed. 62. Communications .—The Military are repairing the road between Zahidan and Kwash via Askalbad and Nazi!.. H. E. Shaukat-Ul-Mulk informed H. M. Consul that a road is projected to link Kerman direct with Birjand. 63. Movements of Foreigners.—Fim E, Fricke, wife of the Manager, National Bank at Zahidan, arrived from India on 26th May. ^ H. A. A. Langlet, a Swedish Journalist, arrived at Zahidan from Meshed and pro ceeded to Bombay on 28th May. The following members of a theatrical troups arrived at Zahidan on 11th June Mdlle Anna Jonescu—Roumanian. M. Giovanni Batta Lopreite—known as Lopretti—Italian. Giovani Lopreite, aged 16, son of the above. Eugenia Mosti—Italian. Ginseppe Bo—Italian. They were not allowed to give a perfor mance owing to Muharram. 64. Miscellaneous. —Malarial fever is much on the increase at Zahidan. The decision to close the Persian section , of the Railway has caused consternation amongst traders in Zahidan and the Qamat, both Indians and Persians. Persian Offi cials at Zahidan openly criticised the action of their Government which has led to this decision. A Persian lady, wife of a res ponsible official remarked that if the Gov ernment continued to wreck the chances of the country developing, as they had recently been doing, it would not be long before it would be confronted with revolu tionary conspiracies.HC324FD—15—22-7'31—GIPS e Persians©; ed coikni; His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and ICain. Locust Report for the month of June 1931. On June 16th swarms of yellow winged locusts arrived at Zahidan (Duzdap) from --the South. Ihe weather was cloudless with variable gusts of wind. They left on 17th in a Northerly direction. * Very little damage was done to cultivation, the insects feeding mostly on desert scrub. No locusts have yet appeared in the Bir- jand area but on 27th a report was re ceived that eggs were hatching out near Baig Chah and Chah-i-daraz. Persian officials proceeded to that area and organ ised destruction by trenching. Yellow locusts are reported to be in great numbers at Neh and Shusp and are being destroyed by spreading barley flour mixed with arsenic. It has further been reported that red locust swarms have proceeded from Shusp in the direction of Qaimabad and Koh-i-baran. Red winged locusts have appeared at Reh and Sheder and have done slight damage to summer crops. They are being to some extent destroyed by the cultivators but no officials are in that area. Neither the local Governorate nor the Revenue Officials appear to receive any reports from officials engaged in combating locusts and reliable information is consequently difficult to obtain. The temperature in Kain is abnormally low for the time of year—it is often in the neighbourhood of 95-100 Fahr. in June but has not exceeded 84 degrees in the shade a t Birjand. Local inhabitants are of the opinion that the abnormally low tempe rature has deterred locusts from arriving far north in Kain during the spring. Wheat and Barley is now mostly harvested and fruit ripened so that serious damage is not now anticipated. C. K. DALY, Major, H. M.

His Majesty's Consular Officers .— His Majesty’s Consul visited Zahidan on 19th May and proceeded on six days’ casual leave to Quetta. Captain L. W. G. Hamber, Secretary to His Majestey’s Consul-General at Meshed arrived at Zahidan on 19th and proceeded to Meshed on 22nd May. He was accom panied by Mrs. Hamber. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Noel, C.I.E., D.S.O., late Consul, Kerman, arrived at Zahidan on May 1st, with his family, and proceeded to India on 7th May. 49. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. —Muhammad Umar Khan, aged 15, son of the late Dost Muhammad, was recently taken to Kwash. He was told to proceed to Iranshehr and take possession of the pro perty of his late father. He was also promised a Sardari allowance, the amount of which has not yet been fixed. The youth asked to be permitted to go to Tehran to see His Imperial Majesty the Shah before assuming charge. It is ru moured that he was really taken to Kwash as a hostage for the good behaviour of the Baranzai and Bamri Baluchis of Bampur who are believed to be disaffected. It is also stated that the boy will be compelled to accompany troops against Abdul Hus sain of Remishk next autumn. The or ders for despatch of troops from Kerman against Abdul Hussain have been cancelled and opeations postponed, owing to the intense heat in Baluchistan. The Afghans and Baluchis previously reported as having been sent to Kwash in connection with the alleged purchase by them of Government rifles at Zahidan, have been returned under escort to Zahi dan and will be sent to Zabul for trial. About 20th a quarrel occurred at Ab-i- Khurran between Sardar Saidi Khan and the Baluch Levies who were recently sent there. Two Levies and three of the Sir dar’s men are reported killed. The General Officer Commanding has given 80 rifles to Sardar Hussain Khan, son of the late Sardar Said Khan and restored to him all his landed property at Bampur, which had been taken from him some years ago by the late Dost Muhammad.^ 30 Bifles have also been £iven to Zama Khan of Dehlogan. MC213FJD As a result of repeated applications by the General Officer Commanding the Cen tral Government have sanctioned a month ly sum of Ts. 950 for payments to the Sardars and Amnieh in the Sarhad. Ar rears for the past 12 months will not be paid. The General Officer Commanding has not yet determined on the distribu tion of the sum authorised, and as yet only the Dak Sowars and their Sardars have received pay for four months. The remainder of the Amnieh having received no pay, have left their posts and gone to their homes. Two cousins of Jahind Khan recently quarrelled at Dorodi, near Sangun. One named Moghul killed the other with a stone. He has been arrested and taken to Kwash. 50. Sistan and the Kainat. —Captain H. A. Peek of the Imperial War Graves Commis sion arrived at Zabul on May 6th and left on 7th. Two bodies were removed from the Consulate Cemetery for concentration in a War Graves cemetery. Captain Peek conveyed a message to His Majesty’s Consul to the effect that the Zabul Con sulate cemetery was the best maintained of any he had yet seen in Iraq or Persia. A European engineer, reported to be an American, arrived at Zabul early in May, in connection with the commission which is to make recommendations for the agricul tural improvement of Sistan. It is be lieved that efforts will be concentrated on reviving agriculture in the neighbourhood of Qila Rustum, where a large area previously cultivated is now waste land, owing to inefficient distribution of water. Dr. Bahrami, Persian, another member of the commission, also arrived at Zabul. He is stated to be the Agricultural expert. A rumour to the effect that he would t open negotiations with the Afghans in I regard to the division of the Helmaii water, I is believed to be unfounded. It is known that some preliminary discussions have taken place between the Persian and Af ghan Governments, but the matter is un likely to be taken up seriously until after the report of the commission has been studi ed in Tehran. The commission will as semble under the Presidency of His Excel lency Shaukat U1 Mulk, in the autumn, I PS'iCLOSURE IN 200 UL 1931 i2 after the preliminary reports of the experts have been made. Dr. Bahrami was educated in Germany. He stated that he intended to start an experimental farm before leaving Sistan. Muharram is everywhere passing quiet ly. The usual mourning processions have taken place, but there have been no un toward incidents. The Manager of the National Bank of Persia at Zabul is raising some thousands of silk worms, which are being distributed among the Sardars and instruction is being- given as to their care, by a representative of the Frontier Commissary, Sarhang Murteza Khan. The usual visits of congratulation on the occasion of the Eid-i-Qurban, were paid on Persian Officials at Birjand, Zahidan and Zabul. 51. Persian Military Affairs .—The Gen eral Officer Commanding in the Sarhad is building a summer residence at Irawan, 4 miles from Kwash. He already has a house at Kosha, on the slopes of Kuh-i- Taftan. Only a garrison of 80 men has been left at Iranshehr and Bampur, the remaining troops having been concentrated at Kwash. The health of the troops returned from the operations towards Bemishk is stated to be bad. Over 150 are in hospital at Kwash. Sultan Hamid Nizam, accountant of the Baluchistan Brigade, is accused of embez zling 60,000 Tomans and is being sent to Meshed for enquiry into his accounts. He accuses the General Officer Commanding and Iskander Khan of receiving the money. Sartip Nasir Ud Dowleh arrived from Kerman, at Zahidan and later proceeded to Zabul. He is collecting evidence of sums due to traders for Military purchases, in connection with the above mentioned Embezzlement case. The General Officer Commanding has announced that no motor lorries should in future be hired for transport of Military stores. Only camel transport to be used. The reason is said to be that the lorries are owned by foreigners, where as the employment of camelmen will benefit Per sian subjects. As lorries have generally been commandeered and inadequately paid for, the foreigners concerned are likely to welcome, rather than disparage, the Ge neral Officer Commanding’s patriotism. It is rumoured in Zabul, that the greater part of the troops in the Sarhad will short ly return to that pace, which was their original Headquarters before the operations in Baluchistan took place. 52. Persian Officials. —Samsam Ud Do^. leh, Governor of Sistan, returned to Za J on May 20th. The Reis-i-Sulhieh (Peace Court Judge) transferred his Court from Zahidan to Zabul on May 1st. He contemplates stay ing 6 months in Zabul. Meanwhile there is no court at Zahidan. Agha Mehdi Khan, late Persian Vice- Consulate, Quetta, left Zahidan for Meshed on May 1st. Agha Mirza Hussain Khan who has been, appointed Consul at Karachi proceeded to India via Zahidan on April 30th. It is believed that his political leanings are to wards the Russians. Agha Mirza Abdul Qasim Khan also proceeded to India on April 30th en route to Kabul where he holds the appointment of 1st Assistant in the Persian Legation. 53. Soviet Activities. —It is still rumour ed at Zabul that the Russians intend to appoint a £ Trade Agent ’there. A quan tity of Russian loaf sugar has recently been smuggled into Zabul through Af- ghanistan and is being secretly disposed of in the Bazaars at 10 seers for 8 krans. 54. Afghan Affairs. —Syed Abdullah Shah, son of Syed Ahmad Shah Mudir-i- Wizarat-i-Kharijah at Mazar-i-Sharif, ar rived at Zahidan from Meshed on 5th May and proceeded to India for Kabul. Sardar Abdul Baqi Khan with his son Ahmed Zia arrived at Zahidan from India on 19th and proceeded to Meshed for \ Herat. His wife is a sister of Mahmud I Tarzi, Father-in-Law of ex-King Aman- f ullah. His eldest son named Ahmed Ratib is at Abbottabad and has. been wired to travel to Herat at once. In 1923 Abdul Baqi was Afghan Consul at Meshed and in 1924 Governor of Herat. On relief by Muhammad Ibrahim Khan in 1926 he remained in Herat supervising his estates there. During the disturbances in Afghanistan he resided at Meshed, Sazwar and Tehran. In 1929 he fell sick and went to Lahore for treatment. He says all his expenses were paid by the pre sent King. He stated at Zahidan that he intended to dispose of his property ^ Herat valued at 1,50,000 rupees and to return to India and engage in Trade. He spoke highly of Nadir Shah and com plained of Soviet intrigues in Afghanistan. He announced that the British had lent Nadir Shah 32,00,000 rupees without in terest. After he left Zahidan, a rumour1 I was cuTrent to the effect that the British had permitted the Afghans to construct a Railway from Chaman to Kandahar and ^that work of construction would shortly commence. Abdul Baqi further stated that Afghan troops had been despatched to Turkestan ’ where a rebellion had broken out as a result of Soviet intrigues. Very few Heratis went on pilgrimage via India last season. The majority went via, Russia. It is said that Kabuli Rupees were accepted in payment of fares to Jeddah. Abdur Rahim Khan, Governor of Herat, is reported to be increasing in popularity and to be decidedly opposed to Nadir Shah. He declines to accept any draft issued on Herat Treasury from Kabul or Kandahar. A company called the Shirkat-i-Islah is said to have been formed at Herat for trading with the Russians in wool, and has secured good profits. On the other hand Kandaharis who exported wool to London via India have suffered heavy loss. 55. Movements of British subjects. — Mr. R. B. Mathews and Mr. H. Macquarie, of New Zealand, touring the world in an Austin Seven car, left Zahidan, by road, for India on 7th. Leiutenants A. Gould and G. Milne arrived at Zahidan from Kerman on 29th April and proceeded to India. Prince Buland Jah Mirza Muhammad Askari and party arrived at Zahidan from Meshed on 6th and proceeded to India. The following Officers, on short leave from Quetta Staff college, entered Persia on 12th and left again on 30th, after visit ing Birjand and Meshed. Captain Moorhead, M.C. and wife. Captains J. Whitehead, C. Brunskill and H. Freeman. 56. Movements of Foreigners. — H. Bucher, American Missionary from Saigon, arrived at Zahidan on 5th and proceeded to Meshed. E. Clauss, German, arrived at Zahidan from Tehran on 19th and took charge of the post of Accountant in the National Bank. Frau Fricke, wife of tie Manager, National Bank at Zahidan, arrived via India on 28th. 57. Miscellaneous.— Persian Gov ernment has now sanctioned the export of jewellery by Indian women, provided it is of Indian make. An Indian trader at Zahidan, whose goods were stolen from the Customs House, has been compensat ed by the Customs. The Director at first refused compensation, but gave way when the trader threatened to take the matter to higher authorities. The tax of 3 Krans on each tin of ghee, levied by the Zahidan Municipality, has been abolished. This is probably due to enquiries by . His Majesty’s Vice Consul as to the authority for the tax, which ap peared to be paid only by Indians. Three Lorries driven by Indians, evaded the Persian Customs on 21st May and entered India. The Lorries had been pur chased on the instalment system and had not been paid for. They were stopped by the Baluchistan police. His Majesty’s Consul understands that some smuggled firearms were discovered. At Zabul, where the Head of the police is on leave, several thefts have recently taken place. The Afghan Consul at Zabul, has recently been attended by our Medical Officer. He had contracted blood poisoning from the use of a German hair dye. He left Zabul for Meshed and Tehran about the end of the month. Water having entered the Shileh—the overflow of the Hamun, the Zahidan- Zabul road is now closed to Motor traffic. Passengers have to arrange for cars on either sides of the water. Should the depth of the water increase, it will be pos sible to employ rafts to ferry cars, as is done at Naurab near Zabul. Unusually late rains fell at Birjand and Zahidan during the month. 12 Afghans were arrested at Zabul for smuggl ng arms from Persia into Afgha nistan. The case has not yet been heard. Usual distr bution. C. K. DALY, Major C.FE., His Britannic Majesty's Consul, Sistan and Kain.His Majesty's Consulate, Sistan and Kain. Report on Locusts, May 1931. Locusts are reported to be at Neb and Sbusp. They appear to be the swarms reported last month, as none of the former swarms which came north from Baluchis tan, have been reported as having reached further North than Shusp. No further swarms have been seen in the Zahidan locality and there are none in Kain north of Shusp. Two officials from Meshed have proceeded to Shusp to orga nise efforts towards extermination. Vast numbers of locusts are, however, reported to have entered British Balu chistan between Nok Kundi and Nushki. The weather in Kain has been excep tionally cool and rains much later than in normal years. Ram fell in the last week in May and the temperature has been some 20 degrees Fahr. lower than the normal for this time of year, in the Qainat. It would appear that owing to the exceptional climatic conditions in the Qainat, the swarms which originate in Persian Baluchistan and, in past years have steadily worked North through Kain into Khorassan, have this year avoided the higher altitude and cold in the Qainat and struck out East wards across the hot plains into British Baluchistan. The early swarms reported last month started North in normal weather, but before reaching the hilly tracts of Kain, the weather underwent an abnormal change, high winds being accompanied by rain and fall in temperature. This appears to have arrested the flight North, while following swarms appear to have gone East into British territory. It is understood that steps are being taken by the authorities in India to deal with swarms which have reached Baluchistan. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty’s Consul. 4 MC213FD—15—23-6-31—/i'ec. Date.

IIis Majesty's Consular Officers .— The Headquarters of the Consulate arrived at Birjand on 22nd for the summer. 43. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchi stan. —Sardar Nur Mahomed Yarmuham- madzai died at his home—Gazo—on 10th April. The Ismailzais who emigrated with Sardar Juma Khan’s brother Ahmad Khan, to Afghanistan last year, have returned to Persian territory. Ahmad Khan himself is endeavouring to obtain pardon from the General Officer Com manding and permission to return. 44. Sistan and Qainat.- —H. E. Shaukat HI Mulk arrived at Zabul in connection with the Frontier Commission, but as the other members had not arrived and a good deal of technical work is required before the Commission can arrive at any deci sions, he obtained permission to return to Birjand. It is believed that the Com mission will not now begin deliberations until the autumn. With reference to paragraph 36 of Diary for March. The accused Mir Jamal, ,, who is said to have been lavish with bribes, has been released. The British Indian subject who was involved in the case has been permitted to proceed to Birjand where he has found employment. Attempts were made by relatives of Jamal Jo induce him to return to the village, but on the advice of His Majesty’s Consul he refused to do so. As his knowledge of the crime was considered dangerous by Mir Jamal, it was considered that it would be unsafe for him to return to his former employment. The Branch of the Zahidan Missionary Society which was opened at Zabul last year has been augmented by the transfer to Zabul of Miss Rice from Zahidan. The Mission cannot be said to be popular at abul. 45. Persian Military Affairs.—The Persian Cavalry has returned to Kwasii. The infantry and cavalry were expected to reach that place about the end of the month. The G. 0. C. has returned to Zwash. A successful two-day Kace Meeting was carried out by the Military at Zabul. There was also an exhibition of trick riding by the cavalry. Tie were well handled and in good con His Majesty’s Consul and Staff were in vited and entertained both days. His Excellency Shaukat U1 Mulk and His Majesty’s Consul each provided prizes for the principal events, which were grace fully acknowledged. The local Sardars produced some good animals, but they were entirely untrained and the riders were not capable of getting the best out of their mounts. 46. Miscellaneous. —Contrary to past practice, the Shah’s coronation was not celebrated on 25th, in accordance with instructions from Tehran. The Canton ment Commandant at Zahidan, whose troops had been preparing some display, gave an entertainment to some Indian and Persian Officials and traders. The Governor threatened to report him to Tehran for disobedience of orders. At Zahidan the Customs Officials have caused resentment by searching Indian women leaving the country and confiscat ing their gold ornaments, on the _ plea that export qf gold is totally prohibited. On the night of April 13th a meeting was held in the Sikh Gurdwara at Zahidan. One Bishan Singh put a resolution con demning the action of Government of India in hanging Bhagat Singh and one Beant Singh pointing to a picture said “Behold Guru Govind Singh approach ing with naked sword to tell you to prepare for sacrifices.” His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Zahidan has received a further offensive anonym ous communication posted at Mesned and containing a copy of a 1 Ghadr party poster. The Indo-European Telegraph peons who. were engaged by the Persians have received no pay up-to-date. They ha^e been informed that they will not be paid tor a further four months as the Budget tor this branch of the Telegraph Department has not been determined. A meeting was held on 21st m the Governorate at Birjand to which all medical practitioners were invited to discuss the diagnosis of a disease w. ici has been prevalent for some time i Town. The Municipal doctor was of the opinion, that the d.seaee « typh- but our Sub-AssStanfr-Siwg-eori. state, that u ‘* IS c ' - JAt 135] * Rec : - 22JUNhe has found no indications of this disease; Owing to the activities of the Excise V Department smuggled opium is now diffi cult to obtain and the majority of the 1 persons who hav6 succumbed to various diseases were adicted to opium. The short age of supplies had lowered vitality to a point which renders them unable to resist any serious illness; It was decided that patients should be isolated in order that they could be kept under observation, but no practical steps have been taken to carry out the decision; The Revenue authorities have received } orders from Meshed to dispose of Govern- | ment wheat at Bazaar rates. As, however, the rate was originally reported to be 72 Krans per KhaVar Birjandi, and the local authorities held up stocks, thinking that the absence of rain would cause a rise in price, they are finding difficult in selling now, because good rains have since fallen and the local rate has de j creased.- An attempt has been made to i compel Bakers to purchase, but they are 1 stoutly resisting and insisting that the rate should be lowered. It is anticipated that the Reis-i-Malieh will find it difficult to explain why he did not sell when oppor tunity ofiered. Rain has fallOn at Birjand almost daily Since 20th April. ‘Catch’ crops are in excellent condition, but irrigated crops in the plains are likely to deteriorate from ‘ rust 47. Afghan Affairs—Mifm Ahmad Elian, late Secretary to eir-King Amanullah, passed through Zahidan on 15th. He mentioned that he had been offered a post under the Persian Government at Tehran. Qazi Nasruddin Khan, son of Saad-ud- din Khan Barakzai arrived at Zahidan on 16th from Meshed. He stated he had received instructions from Kabul to Pro ceed to Delhi where he expected to be employed in the Afghan Consulate-General, Muhammad Sadiq Khan, son of Muham mad Hussain Khan, Head clerk of the Afghan Legation, Tehran passed through Zahidan en route Tehran on 22nd.

MC142FD—15—26-5-31—GIPSCONFIDENTIAL His Majesty s Consul, Sistan and Kain, Report on locusts in the Consulate area during April 1931* N Desert locusts, yellow in colour, were observed in the following localities :— 1. On 15th near Koh-i-Taftan Railway Station moving towards Mirjawa. 2. On 17th on the Zahidan-Meshed road between miles 12—25 from Zahidan flying North. 3. On 15th, 3 miles North of Horniuk (on the Zahidan-Meshed road) flying North. 4. On 15th and 21st, small swarms at Zahidan flying North. 5. Swarms are reported to have alighted at Kwash and Sara van (Bakshan) in the Sarhad on 19th. Swarms 1, 2, 3 and 5 alighted and fed on wild vegetation, no Cultivated area was attached. Swarms 4 did not alight. On the day this swarm was observed there was a light and variable wind; Ro action had been taken locally to deal with above. A swarm was reported to have reached Khoshara having come from the direction of Karman on 21st. A report was received at Birjand on 23rd to the effect that hoppers had hatched out in a limited area about 15 miles South of Neh. The Governor of Kain despatched messengers to destroy these by trenching. As in previous years; all these swarms appear to originate in the desert area of Southern Persian Baluchistan early in the year and to move steadily northward as the laying season approaches. No locusts have yet been observed in Kain or Sistan, although the swarm mentioned at 3 above, is variously report ed as having moved North towards Kain and East towards Sistan and Afghanistan; C. K.

Peesian Baluchistan. 21, Persian Officials. The G. O. C. is encamped with 200 men about 120 miles from Iransheher. Troops are scattered disarming the tribes. Idu Khan is at Chahbar assisting the troops to collect arms. 19. Sistan and Kainat. On 25th February a policeman was shot at Birjand while attempting to steal from the Revenue Office. The police in Birjand have long been suspected of thefts and it has been rumoured that they were encouraged by the Police Officer. I Excise officials at Birjand continue to : be very active in discovering illicit stocks | of opium. Municipal Committee has at length been appointed at Birjand. It had been in abeyance since the abolishment of financial assistance from the Central Revenues. avy snow fell at Birjand on 23rd, 25th and 26th, and jain in Sistan fcas exceeded the normal and has fallen exceptionally late in the season. H. E. Shaukat III Mulk arrived at Birjand on 18th. Persian officials took over charge at Duzdap and Sistan (Zahidan and Zabul) from the I. E. T. Department. At Zabul they are unable to operate the instruments taken over and are working on the old sets. Traffic for India is via Tehran and subject to much delay. 20. Persian Military. It is rumoured that the G. O. C. in the I Sarhad, Colonel Muhammad Khan has been summoned to Tehran in connection with alleged embezzlement of Funds. Yawar Iskander Khan is now in Tehran about to be charger! with the same offence and Sultan Hamid Nizam has also been suspended and is proceeding to Tehran. Sultan Abbas Khan Inspector of Police Department held inspections at Zahidan and Zabul during the month. The Governor of Zabul is shortly | going to India and Iraq on a visit. As { he accomplishes nothing whatever in Zabul, he will not be missed. The Frontier Commissary Colonel Murteza Khan will hold charge during the for mer s absence. Murteza Khan is en deavouring to secure a transfer from Zabul. He is disappointed at receiving no recognition of his services prior to the Shah’s visit and as the ‘ New Town ’ hastily built by him to impress His Majesty—at the expense of the inhabi tants—is now alreaay in ruins as a result of heavy rain, he comes in for much abuse. 22. Soviet Activities. The caretaker in charge of the Con sulate at Zabul has received his wages from Meshed. Informers are supplying news from Zabul to the Soviet Consul- General there. Russian newspapers | which used to be distributed here have | been arriving by post, but have been i confiscated by the postmaster. 23. Afghan Affairs. The Afghan Consul declines to issue passports to Hazaras, as he states that such passports are confiscated by the Persians. Similarly the Persians will J not issue them passports to proceed to I India. Many are Indian Army pension-1 ers, over the age for conscription and are I in very bad circumstances and desire to return to Quetta to seek employment. Several have relatives now serving at ' Quetta. It has been rumoured at Zabul at a number of Russians, formerly in the service of Amanullah, have recently been expelled to Russia under escort from Kabul, etc. Tribes ew route were with | difficulty restrained from attacking them. . The Afghan Consul at Zabul has moved into a house near the British Consulate. ENCLCSURc IN INDIA FOREIGN SECR^ARV’S 5 Letter No a 3. j ■ Dated ? APR. 1031 n n *24. Communications. Owing to snow and rain very few lorries have been running on the Zahidan- Meshed road. The Zabul road has been impassable for the greater part of the latter half of February. The Railway is still breached, but passengers are being transferred and the train due at Zahidan on 3rd arrived on 4th. The Sarweshk bridge on the Kwash-Mirjawa road has collapsed. It was originally built by the British and its repair by the Persians is unlikely. 25. Movements of British Subjects. Mr. G. G. Barret, Australian, represen- t tative of Dunlop Company arrived at f Zahidan on 25th. He was detained at 1 Miijawa having neglected to obtain a !' Peisian Visa. He was subsequently allowed to visit Zahidan by car. 26. Movements of Foreigners. H. Gaenzer, Manager of the National Bank at Zahidan proceeded to Germany via India on 26th. Usual distribution. 27. Miscellaneous. A further revolutionary poster was pasted on the walls of the Sikh Gur- dawara at Zahidan on the night of 20/21st. It was removed by a Sikh and burnt. It is believed that a number of the posters is still at Duzdap with the * Sikhs, but the display of them is now due to enmity among themselves—an \ endeavour to involve some of their number in proceedings similar to those j which led to the expulsion of Sewa * Singh. The latter left for India by train on 26th and was escorted to the frontier by three police. On his departure he declared that he would continue his j revolutionary activities in India. The customs at Zahidan in pursuance of orders from Tehran are permitting no goods to be cleared which arrive after 25th. The difficulties in which foreign traders are placed by these constant changes of regulations are causing a very despondent outlook among the Indian traders. C. K.

GIPI’—1132(Cj FAPD--25-3-31-15.CONFIDENTIAL. n Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the first-half of February 1931. 11. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchis tan. —Reference last month’s diary, one of the Afghans arrested at Duzdap has been sent to Kwash as he has confessed that he could identify the Officer who nego tiated the sale of arms. Rumours of heavy fighting in the neighbourhood of Remishk have reached Duzdap but are unconfirmed. It is believed that the Persian troops are disarming tribes on the way to Remishk but are unlikely to attempt to force their way into the defile which is strongly guarded. Owing to the bad climate in that locality serious operations are likely to be postponed until next year. 12. Sistan and Shaukat-ul- Mulk has returned to Birjand. It is known that the Persian have long been endeavouring to persuade him to take some appointment in Tehran, but he is not anxious to do so and rumours to the effect that he has accepted an appoint ment are discredited here. He is likely to be President of a Commission to enquire into the system of land tenure in Sistan. 13. Persian Military Affairs. —Yawar Iskander Khan, mentioned in last diary proceeded to Tehran via Kerman on 10th February. The fact that Head quarters have declined to send an officer in his place is assumed by the G. O. C. to indicate that he will probably be allowed to return to his command. 14. Persian Officials. —Abul Khan has been appointed Reis-i-Sijjrl in Sistan. A number of petty officials in the Malieh Department have been dismissed. 15. Soviet Activities. —Reports are regularly sent to the Soviet Consul-Gene ral at Meshed from Sistan, by an indi vidual who was formerly employed by the Soviet Consul here. 16. Afghan Affairs. —The Afghan Consul at Sistan has been refusing to grant passports to Hazaras. He gives no reasons for his refusal. A few pass ports issued have been recovered. A number of Hazaras who desire to proceed .1 to India are held up on this account as they can obtain no passport without declaring themselves to be Persian sub jects. Many are ex-soldiers of the Indian Army and will not on any account . consider themselves to be Persians. , 17. Miscellaneous. —Siwa Singh of Birjand was arrested by the Governor | and sent to Duzdap under guard to be | expelled from the country. At the same time another Sikh shop keeper and a motor driver as well as a Persian, of whose activities 1 had occa sion to complain to the Governor last year, were also arrested. The Persian was threatened with punishment if he continued to disseminate anti-British propaganda and the Indians were subse quently released after warning that their activities would be watched. The prompt action taken by the Persian authorities has already had a salutary effect. Shortly before Siwa Singh was arrested another anonymous letter was received by H. M. Vice-Consul, Duzdap from. Birjand, which had undoubtedly been despatched by this individual. C. K.

While collecting arms from Sardar Saidu Khan of Ab-i-Khurran a clash occurred and there were a few killed and wounded on both sides. The troops were withdrawn to avoid further bloodshed. Some wound ed were seen on the way to Kwash. Persian Officials. 31. Sultan Taqi Khan from Meshed has proceeded to Zahidan to take charge of the Police there. Hamsam Ud Dowleh, Governor of Sistan 3 left on a tour to Kerbela and Beirut, via India, on March 12th. He has taken a large stock of carpets for sale en route. His clerk is act ing for him—Sarhang Murteza Khan declined the appointment as he hopes to obtain a transfer from Sistan. Abdul Hussain of Remishk has again attacked and looted a caravan on the way from the coast to Bam. Twelve men were killed and 80 loads of goods stolen. Sardar Jihand Khan is still at Robat.” The Nawab of Kharran recently sent him 3 rifles and 4 loads of grain. In return six *303 rifles were sent to the Nawab. Afghan Affairs. 32. The Afghan Consul, Sistan, who has been very remiss in the past as regards calling at this Consulate on official occasions, appears to have had instructions to be more polite and has recently called and made various friendly gestures. Sistan and Kain. 29. Crops are reported to be exceptionally good. The Commission to report on the system of land tenure in Sistan is expected shortly to arrive in Zabul. There are signs of uneasiness among the sardars, who believe that Shaukat-Ul-Mulk, who is to be the Pre sident, will endeavour to lease extensive areas from the Government over their heads and treat them as tenants, recovering the Revenue on behalf of the Government. Shaukat is believed to have attempted this arrangement some years ago. Persian Military Affairs. 30. The Sartip who has been auditing the Military Accounts at Iransheher is said to have discovered that Sultan Hamid Nizam has been embezzling Ts. 1,000 per mensem, which has been shared with the G. O. C. and Yawar Iskander Khan. On the other hand the latter has written to Zahidan from Tehran to the effect that he has been re instated and will return as soon as the G. O. C. leaves for Tehran. It has not yet been decided whether Zabul garrison is to be attached to the Meshed Command or to remain under the G. O. C. Baluchistan. The Military are arranging a two-day Race Meeting at Zabul shortly. H. I. M. the Shah is said to have ordered races to be held annually in future to encourage horse-breeding as Sistan supplies most of the horses for the army in East Persia. Sardar Abdul Razzak Khan, appointed Afghan Consul General at Meshed arrived at Zahidan on 4th. He was delayed 8 days before he could obtain permission to clear his personal car from the customs to pro ceed on his journey. On arrival at Birjand he was accosted by the police and the car tax demanded. He declined to pay until he reached Meshed and could discover whether he was exempt from the taxation. A policeman then threatened him with a loaded rifle and tried to carry him to the Police Station. Finally the Reis of the police intervened and imprisoned the police man, allowing the Consul General to pro ceed in a highly excited frame of mind. The Afghan Consul at Zabul recently complained bitterly to me of the scant courtesy he received at the hands of Persian officials. The recent rapprochement may indicate that they have decided that more co-operation among Consuls may secure better treatment for all. A road construction official together with some police recently forced his way into the small Rest-house maintained by this Con sulate at Shusp, listed the contents and informed the chowkidar that he must vacate the premises in three days. No reference whatever has been made to this Consulate. H. M. Consul General at Meshed has been asked to protest to the Governor General of Khorasan against this highhanded action on the part of petty officials.Movements of British Subjects. 33. Several parties of L E. T. E. P erson ‘ nel and famiHes have passed through Zahidan en route to England. Mr. C. P. Skrine and wife left Zahidan on 6th, proceeding on leave to U. K. via Tehran. L. Kogan, originally Russian, now na turalised B. S. passed through Zahidan on 10th for India. He is a student. His mother resides in Meshed. Miscellaneous. 34. An Indian trader, on clearing some goods from the Customs discovered that the box had been opened and goods val^d Ts. 200 removed. No action has yet bedfr taken by the Customs Department. On arrival of a train from India several bags of sugar were found to be missing. The customs deny all liability, although they admit that the wagon was sealed at Mirjawa and seals were intact when it reached the customs siding. / MC31FD—15—28.4.31—GIB 3His Majesty’s Consulate, Sistan and \ Kain.

About March 15th one Akbar, a well known robber, who is said to have worked with the support of Sardar Malik Muham mad Khan, was reported to have been mur dered in the village of Rindeh. The police who proceeded to investigate learnt that a body had been buried in the garden of Mir Jamal, the headman of the village. The corpse was found and it is alleged that information was given by one Ali Mohd. son of Fateh Din an Indian, of Phullerwan village, district Gujrat, who was em ployed by Mir Jamal as gardener. It would appear that this Indian came to Sistan some 12 years ago. He is not in possession of a passport and has never taken any steps to register as a British subject. He has been brought to the town and is under police protection, as there would appear to be some danger of his being murdered by adherents of the accused, who consider his evidence will be dangerous. The Public Prosecutor from Birjand has arrived at Zabul to investigate the case. The Indian has been advised to leave this locality after the case has been disposed of, and will return to India. for the Persian Officials. • ^Sarhang Ahmed Khan appointed Per- sian Military Attache at Kabul proceeded to India via Zahidan on March 19th, and barhang Ali Khan Karimi who has vacated the post proceeded to Tehran from Zahidan on 20th.

He attempted, un successfully, to obtain financial assistance from H. M. Vice-Consul, on the grounds of hardship sufiered in China and elsewhere. Herr Brose, Manager of the Zabul branch of the National Bank is returning to Ger many. He is dissatisfied with the terms offered him for a renewal of his contract. He informed me that the Bank was doing better than he had expected, but in further conversation it transpired that he was scar cely able to cover the upkeep expenses of the Branch. Herr Schnorr from Zahidan will relieve Herr Brose. Persian Military Affairs. 37. Sartip Nasiruddowleh and party who were at Iransheher auditing military ac counts, have proceeded to Bam. Yawa* Hussain Khan Farezi has been conscripting Baluchis from Bam and Kerman. He is said to have obtained 1,000 conscripts, of whom 500 have been despatched to Kwash. On their arrival conscripts who have completed their term of duty will be discharged.

He is ex porting gum to Karachi. Herr Rudolf Fricke arrived at Zahidan on 21st from Tehran and assumed charge of the Zahidan Branch of the National Bank. 41. The rains have destroyed the tem porary repairs which were made to the Zabul-Zahidan road, for the Shah’s visit last autumn and this road is now in a worse state than has ever previously been experienced. Unless repairs be shortly undertaken it is doubtful whether it will remain passable for cars. 4CONFIDENTIAL. Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the 1. Movements of H.

Sardar Lashkar Khan Gumsbadzai is believed to have applied to the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, for permission to settle at Panjgur. The Baluch Sardars in the Sarhad have now received no allowances for the past eight months. Arrears are said to amount to Tomans 7,200. The G. O. C. has made repeated applications to Tehran for funds. Behram Khan, s/o Mir Kiya-Baluch of British Mashkel has asked the Persian authorities for permission to reside in Persian Baluchistan. Sardars Abdul Hussain and Barkat Khan refused to comply with the G. O. C.’s order to surrender. The former committed several dacoities and the G. O. C. asked for sanction to mili tary operations being taken against him. This was at first refused on the grounds of financial stringency, but towards the end of the month he looted 40 camels from a Baluch caravan and permission was then granted to proceed against him. The G. 0. C. has marched to Bampur leaving only 200 men at Iransheher. He delayed there until the arrival at Iran sheher of 500 Levies raised by Idu Khan to protect Iransheher and Bampur during the absence of the troops. Sardar Abdul Hussain is said to have a force of 300 men of his own tribe— well armed with ’303 rifles. He has also been joined by 30 Bamris of Dehlegan and has received a number of rifles from Barkat Khan Kiyani. Abdul Hussain is believed to have blocked the valley into Remishk—about seven days journey from Bampur. The troops are likely to proceed to Lashkar and to advance in two parties from there, one direct and the other via Dehlegan. The Bamris in Dehlegan have handed in to the Military 100 rifles—all muzzle loading. The Reis-i-Malieh, Duzdap, who visited Khwash in December, told the tribes that in the absence of documentary evidence to the contrary all arable land and spring water at Khwash and Mirjawa would be considered Government pro perty and liable to taxation. The G. O. C. has found fault with the Malieh for issuing these orders without his approval, as tending to disturb the tribes. The order is said to have been issued by the Revenue authorities at Tehran. j The G. O. C. recently learnt that a j Military Officer had sold rifles from the j Government stock of confiscated arms at Duzdap. He deputed Idu Khan to make enquiries. The latter discovered that 30 rifles had been sold to Afghans. It is reliably reported that a caravan carrying 35 rifles was observed on Jan uary oth in the Sarhad proceeding to Afghanistan. Another report is to the effect that, prior to the arrival of the Shah (who ordered all confiscated arms at Khwash to be destroyed while he was there) the G. O. C. handed over 215 rifles to Idu Khan from the Government stock, for sale on his behalf. Idu intended to smuggle these arms to Afghanistan through his brother Shah Beg, a Havildar at Kacha Levy Post. He however thought better of using a British levy for the purpose and subsequently des patched a Baluch with 15 rifles to as certain what price would be offered. It would therefore appear that the energy displayed in tracing sales at Duzdap is not from disinterested motives, it being desirable to cover his own dealings. The G. 0. C, has placed Naib Mahmud Khan under arrest at Iransheher for ENCL'/bUi- mn INDIA FOREIGN SF' Letter 3J Dated 12 MAR. 1S31 Receiveu 30 MAR, 19312 the alleged offence of selling 40 rifles from Khwash. The Officer when charged is said to have replied that he received the arms from Yawar Iskander Khan (brother-in-law of the G. O. C.) and had paid the sum realised to him. Iskander Khan who is at Duzdap denies the story. On January 31st the Adjutant at Duzdap searched the house of one Malik I Muhammad Khan near Duzdap and subsequently examined a Karez near the house and xecovered ten ‘303 rifles. 5 These were apparently buried by Afghans who had purchased them from Mahmud Khan. Eight Afghans who had previously been arrested and released, were re-arrested and severely flogged, but did not confess to com plicity. Eour Baluchis including a Earrash of the National Bank have also been arrested in this connection. 3. Sistan and Kain. —Abnormal floods in Sistan have done extensive damage to the crops. Shahzadeh Mohtazadi has been re turned as the member for Kain in the Majlis. Heavy snow fell at Saddeh and in northern Kain during the early part of January and rains have been more than usually heavy. The rainfall in Sistan has been much below normal. No export of grain is taking place from Sistan—prices have fallen heavily and stocks cannot be disposed ot. Landowners are experiencing great difficulty m raising money to pay the revenue. 4. Persian Military Affairs. — Sartip Nasir-ud-Dowleh arrived at Khwash about January 6th from Tehran to inspect accounts. He refused to dine with, or be entertained by Yawar Iskander Khan. He returned to Duzdap on the 12th. His visit does not, perhaps, augur well for the G. 0. C. whose accounts can scarcely be in good order judging from the reports circulat ing as to his financial dealings. A deter mined attempt is undoubtedly being made by enemies at Headquarters to disgrace Sarhang Mahomed Khan. His position in the Sarhad is probably suffi ciently remunerative to have attracted rivals for the post. Subsequently Sartip Nasir-ud-Dowleh proceeded to Iransheher to enquire into the accounts there. At the end of January Yawar Sikander Khan was suspended from duty. He is O. C. Eauj Zabuli and has long enjoyed Jj a privileged position in the Sarhad being f related to the G. O. C. Their wives a ^ ! sisters. He is proceeding to Tehran n, be tried by Court Martial. He states that he has no knowledge of the chaiges against him, but as has fallen out with his brother-in-law, the latter has reported against him. It may safely be surmised that quarrels have taken place in regard to the division of the spoils—the cash realised by the sale of arms. As he must be well acquainted with every financial peccadillo of the G. 0. C. and will probably disclose his information, the tenure of command of Muhammad Khan in the Sarhad is likely to come to an abrupt end. 5. Persian Officials. —Agha Baigan, Reis-i-Malieh, Sistan, has been transfer red to Khwash. Dr. Hassan Khan has been appointed Municipal Doctor at Iransheher. 6. Soviet. —There is as yet no news of I the appointment of the Trade Represen- ! tative for Sistan. The Soviet Consulate | is in charge of a caretaker. 7. Afghan Aifairs. —A report has cir culated in Sistan to the effect that early in January a fight took place between the Ghilzais and the Durranis in Bar- nozat. There were several casualties and the newly appointed Governor Mirza Malikji Khan who had but re cently arrived from Kabul, lost his life. The Ghilzais resented his appointment as they considered that it should have gone to a member of their tribe. This tribe looted the town and neighbour hood. 8. Lawlessness. —A Persian butcher from Khwash was murdered while out buying sheep about January 16th. Sardar Khan Mohamed Yarmuhammad- zai and eight followers have been arrest ed on suspicion. 9. Communications. —One, Everard— said to be a Russian from Meshed, has been inspecting the Meshed-Duzdap and Duzdap-Sistan roads. He is employed as a road engineer or contrac tor by the Persians. At Birjand this gentleman found himself in need of boot laces. He searched the bazar for some of Soviet manufacture and finding none, purchased a ball of string for his purpose. 10. Miscellaneous. —The Persians pro pose to build a quarantine station atMirjawa. The Dazdap police have received orders not to issue passports for pilgrims to Mecca. Two copies of the Indian revolutionary \ per “ Ghadr ” printed in San Francisco were found in the Sikh Guidwara at Duzdap on the 25th January, and another in the shop of one Ram Singh Mohar Singh. , These had been sent to Duzdap by | Siwa Singh, an actively disloyal Sikh of Birjand. The latter is reported to have been questioned by the Persian Police at Rirjand and to have stated that he receives them direct from America and circulates them. He stated that he was an Indian but not a British subject. He employs a man called Hindi Bhai, who appears to have been in Russia. Akali Narain Singh of Duzrlap is said to have written to Siva Singh warning him against Hindi Bhai, whom he describes as an agent of the Punjab Police. C. K. DALY, Major C. I.

Diary from His Britannic Majesty^ Gonsul^iitan and Kain, for the month of December 1930. A — . His Majesty’s Consular Officers. 112. His Majesty’s Consul proceeded to India on December 9th to attend a conference at Quetta and for consulta tion with the Government of India in I pursuance of instructions received. Captain E. H. Gastrell, I. A., assumed charge of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate at Duzdap on December 2nd. Captain Alban on relief by Captain Gastrell proceeded to India, ew- route Bushire. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. 113. When H. I. M. The Shah visited Kwash a quantity of old arms which had been recovered from the tribes was burnt. Similarly weapons collected at Duzdap were destroyed on November 30th. Jiand Khan and other Yarmuhammad- zai Sardars who had been detained at Meshad were released by the Shah s orders and reached Duzdap on December 1st. They had beer, well primed to complain of the G. 0. C. in the Sarhad, while lauding the treatment they had received at the hands of the Amir-i-Lash- ker Am a nulla Mirza. The latter made strenuous efforts to influence the Shah against Sarhang Muhammad Khan with whom he has long been on bad terms, and it is said that he won over Shaukat-Ul-Mulk to his support by offering his assistance to secure for the latter the Governorship ol Sistan . and the Sarhad if Muhammad Khan could be supplanted. His Majesty is reported to have s h&lt;^vn displeasure with Muhammad Khan, but accounts of this were undoubtedly comur ed by those to whom the wish that he might be found wanting was father to the thought. Muhammad Khan has no doubt done well for himself out of his contro o affairs, but the Shah is not unhkely to have noted that, on the whole he has done very well under most difficult cir cumstances, He has had all the unpleas ant work of controlling the, ^ibes, whi e it has been the privilege of the D. u. u., Eastern Army to deal out the plums m the shape of occasional presents and S 3 7 mpathy with intractable Sardars. The Baluch Sardam in the Sadiad had been advised to complain against the Military Governor (Sa hang Muhammad Khan) and were promised influential support and that the Shah would be sya pathetic. They must have been dis abused however, for none of them were introduced to His Majesty who spoke to nobody, but inspected the Barracks and troops. The Yarmuhammadzai’s Sardars were not allowed to at once proceed to their homes and in consequence were enter tained by the Reki Sardars for a week. They have claimed seven months arrears of ahowances due before they were im prisoned and this has been promised by the G. O. C. Payment for the period they were detained at Meshad has been refused pending instructions from Tehran. On December Hth the G. O. C. sent letters by hand of Ali Dad, Reis Amnieh at Bampur, to Sardar Barkat Khan of Kiyan and Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk ordering them to surrender at Kerman or Kwash, failing which punitive measures would be taken. Ration contractors have been ordered to stock rations sufficient for three months at Iransheher, presumably for the use of a force to be despatched against the above mentioned Sardars should they continue to disobey instruc tions. Sistan and Kain. 114. At Birjand preparations for the iction of a Deputy have been taking ice. It is anticipated that Shahzadeh ffitazadi will be elected. He is sup- rted by the Shaukat-Ul-Mulk. Excise Inspectors have been very tive in Birjand and have raided a num- r of houses, including that ol the | lam recovering opium and opium loking pipes. Efforts have been made to form a unicipal Council at Birjand but have therto failed as non are willing to -ve. The Municipal Doctor has iceived no pay for some months. FG LetterThe mother of H. E. Shaukat-ul-Mulk died on December 1st. She is mourned by the whole countryside, being very charitable. She has for years exerted great influence over Shaukat-ul-Mulk and has restrained him from entering into politics of recent years. She was very well disposed to British interests aid undoubtedly had great influence with her son. The funeral took place at Meshad. Pi :rsian Military Affairs. 115. It is rumoured that the Sistan Brigade will be relieved in the Sarhad shortly, and also that Sarhang Muham mad Khan will command in Kerman. His command has now been made independent of Eastern Army and is directly under the Ministry of War. All Camerly and Cavalry were sent from Kwash to Iransheher on 18th December, subsequently most of the Zabali Fauj was also sent there and the G. 0. C. moved bis headquarters. The number of the Zabali Fauj is sa d to have been altered from 25 to 15, an advancement in seniority as a reward for services in Baluchistan. Persian Officials. 116. There are frequent reports fiom Birjand of the corrupt practices of the Reis Nazmieh there. The new magis trate is however said to be a great improvement on his predecessor and has not, so far, been detected taking bribes. His name is Mirza Musa Khan Godarzi. Sartip Nasirullah arrived at Birjand from Meshad on 9th December and inspected the Police and Military detach ments. Moosa Khan Kesravi Reis Malieh at Duzdap went to Kwash on 28th Decem ber and it is reported that he announced that he had received orders from Tehran to the effect that all tribal lands were regarded as Government property and subject to taxation. This caused a con siderable stir and there were rumours that the tribes would threaten to emi grate if their crops were taxed. Soviet Activities. 117. The Soviet Consulate at Sistan was temporarily closed in mid-December. Ihe s.aff proceeded to Meshad. When at Birjand the Consul’s car was con fiscated by the Police as he has refused to pay the tax for 10 months. He suc ceeded in eluding the Police and left by night, but broke down outside the town and had to return. The car was seized and alt liough he threatened diplomatic action was not released until he paid the arrears of tax. Before leaving Sistan they had, a quarrel with an Indian lorry driver with whom they had made a contract and to whom money had been advanced. Having secured a lower offer they endeavoured to cancel the contract. A compromise was eventually effected, but not before the driver, in the presence of a large crowd, had told them in forceable language what he thought of their methods, and that he hoped they would never again be seen in Sistan. The Vice-Consul is said to have stated that he would shortly return. The Police have intimation that a Trade representative will soon be appointed. Afghan Affairs. 118. The Afghan Consul has been receiving a considerable number of telegram from Kabul. It is believed that the Perso-Afghan negotiations over the boundary and water distribution are not proceeding smoothly. There are constant rumours that Nadir Shah’s difficulties in Afghanistan are increasing and that a party in favour of the recall of Amanullah is gaining strength. The son of the Afghan Consul is shortly proceeding to Kabul, possibly to try and clear up the situation in regard to the boundary dispute. His father has had difficulty in decyphering the mes sages he receives from Kabul. Lawlessness. 119. On December 29th some Ismail' zais attacked the Amnieh post at Kahurak (I. E. Telegraph Station). Firing took place for two hours without casualties. The tribesmen however heard a false report to the effect that one of their number had been killed and in revenge attacked the Amnieh at Nasratabad Sipi. There was no casualties and the attackers left in the direction of Duzdap. On January 2nd the Amnieh post atKundi was attacked. One tribesman was killed and two wounded and one Amnieh killed. It has yet been learnt what steps have been taken to restore order. On the night of 6/7th December a caravan was looted near Lakhshak, on the Kerman road and 30 camels stolen. Later Amnieh with the Assistance of British Levy Corps at Robat recovered 19 camels which were sent to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Duzdap and handed back to the Persian Officials. No thieves were apprehended. Communications. 120. The Temporary repairs executed | on the Sistan road for the Shah’s visit have been destroyed by rain and the road is now as bad if not worse than at any previous time. A sum of 40,000 Tomans is said to have been allotted for the repair of this road. A new alignment is to be made from Qileh Rustum to Hormuck and the existing short cut from the former place to Mukhi Surkh on the Meshad road south of Safidawa is to be put into a pas sable state. It is said that five lorries will be pur chased to carry stone from the hills near Hormuk and Mukhi Surkh. Movements of Foreigners. 121. H. P. Lochenperg, Austrian, arrived at Duzdap from India and pro ceeded to Meshad on December 1st. Stanislav Swiderski, Polish Artist, proceeded to India on the 27th Novem ber. Dr. J. Serbousek, Austrian, with wife and 3 children reached Duzdap from Meshad on December 4th and proceeded to India on the 11th. Messrs Henry and Kurt, Schildmann, Germans, arrived at Duzdap from Meshed on the 6th and proceeded to India on the 11th December 1930. Vladimir Ostoitch, Serbian and Miss S. Helena, Pole, proceeded to India on 1st January 1931. K. Hansen and R. Bugatsch, Dane and Austrian respectively—tourists— arrived at Duzdap on 25th December and proceeded to India on the 1st J anuary. Miscellaneous. Duzdap has been named “ Zahidan ” as a result of the Shah’s visit. On the 27th of December a meeting was held in the Sikh Gurdwara at Duzdap on the occasion of the Birthday of Guru Gobind Singh. A motor driver named Amrik Singh made an anti-British speech. On December 31st His Majesty’s Vice- Consul received two copies of a revolu tionary poster sent anonymously from Birjand. Four copies had previously been found affixed to walls in Duzdap. A report from Birjand was to the effect that a revolutionary notice had been exhibited there in the shop of Sewa Singh, a Sikh who has long been very ! actively anti-British. He was no doubt responsible for sending copies to Duzdap. These posters are printed in America and issued by a revolutionary party in San Francisco. The actual cover in which they were received addressed to Sewa Singh at Birjand has come into the pos session of His Majesty’s Consul. C. K.

His Majesty’s Consular Officers .— His Majesty’s Consul moved to Sistan for the winter arriving at Headquarters on November 6th. The death occurred at Duzdap on November 17th, from heart failure, of Mr. G. E. Moore, M.B.E., who has for ten years served as Confidential Assistant to His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan. Mr. Moore was rejoining his post after enjoy ment of long leave. 102. Visit of H. I. M. The Shah of Persia. —H. I. M. The Shah arrived at Birjand on the 17th November and pro ceeded to Sistan the following day. He arrived at Sistan on the 19th. He left for Duzdap on the 20th where he'remain- ed until the 22nd, on which date he con tinued his journey to Kwash, etc. A separate report is under preparation in this connection. 103. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— Saidar Abul Hassan Khan, Bahramzai, who had accompanied Ali Mohammad and Nowshirawan Khan, on the latters flight into British territory surrendered himself to the General Officer Command ing in the Sarhad. His lands have been restored to him and although he will receive no allowance, it is stated that payment of all revenue has been remit ted. This conciliatory policy has been adopt ed with a view to attract other fugitives to return to Persian territory. It is already rumoured that many of the fol lowers of Ali Mohammad and Nowshera- wan contemplate returning, as they are destitute. It appears that Ali Moham mad has not seen fit to support any of his followers out of the subsistence allow ance wdiich he has received from the British authorities. It is reported that a son and wife, of the late Dost Mohammad Khan who were with Ali Mohammad in Mekran have recently died there. The General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad is believed to be reluctant to commence punitive operations against Abdul Hussain, the recalcitrant S ordar of Remishk. He is said to intend to visit the neighbourhood of Remishk with Idu Khan and to employ the latter induce Abdul Hussain to meet him, under the promise of safe conduct. About the 10th November Faqir Mo hammad son of Sardar Jiand Khan Yar- mohamadzai entered Persian territory from British Baluchistan, at Mirjawa. He came to attend the marriage ceremony of Sardar Mehrullah Khan, Reki. The General Officer Commanding order ed the latter to take him to Kwash The order was not complied with, but they proceeded to Gwarkoh for the maniage festivities. In consequence the monthly allowance of Mehrullah Khan, has been withheld. Sarhang Mohammad Khan, General Officer Commanding and Military Gov ernor in the Sarhad is said to have learnt from a friend in the Mejlis at Tehran, that the Shah has been annoyed by reports indicating that he (the Sar hang) was on friendly terms with His Britannic Majesty’s Consular Officers. The Sarhang states that he has received personal letters from Mr. Skrine, I.C.S., formerly His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan, which he dare not reply to and intimated to a member of our Vice-Consulate staff at Duzdap, that he found such com* munications embarrassing. 50 Pehlavi hats were despatced by the General Officer Commanding to Mir jawa and 200 to Kwash, because it had been intimated that the Shah would be highly displeased should any of the Baluchis appear before him in turbans. 104, Sistan and Kainat .—As a result of the Shah’s visit a commission will be set up consisting of two selected members from Tehran, one irrigation specialist, one agricultural specialist, Hisam-Ud- Dowleh, Governor of Birjand and H. E. Shaukat-Ul-Mulk. The Commission will enquire into and report fully on agricul tural conditions with special reference to the system of land tenure. There are indications that the central authorities are determined to break the power of the hereditary Sardars and to distribute land among the peasantry. Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Com missary, informed His Majesty’s Consul that he had repeatedly urged the neces sity for a ction in this direction, as he2 considered that the absolute poverty of the peasantry was a source of dangev, since they were being continually sub jected to communistic propaganda. Since, however the poverty of the workers has not hitherto led to sympa thetic treatment in any part of Persia, it may be assumed that the policy is directed more at the suppression of the Sardar class and curtailment of their wealth and privileges than to ameliora tion of the conditions of life of the peasants. 105. Persian Military Affairs .—It is reported that the health of the troops at Kwash and Iransher is very bad. There have been a number of deaths. The Amir-i-Lashkar-i-Sharq accom panied H. I. M. The Shah on his visit to Sistan and Kwash. He returned to Duzdap en route for Meshed on the 23rd. He will proceed shortly to France for military study. It is believed that his post will not be filled, but that Brigade Commanders will deal direct with the Ministry of War during his absence. The Shah inspected the barracks at Duzdap at 4 a.h. on the 22nd. The men are said to have complained that they never received full rations. His Majesty is believed to have expressed his displeasure to the G 0. C. Altogether the G.O.C. appears to have been taken to task somewhat severely by the Shah, both for his management of Military affairs and Political control of the Baluch tribes. It is an open secret that the Sarhang is on bad terms with the Amir-i-Lashkar and the latter presumably had the Shah’s ear, having travelled with him from Meshed. Those who know the difficulties the G. O. C. in the Sarhad has had to contend with without adequate support from his superiors, will probably agree that his services in the Sarhad and Baluchistan have been worthy of some recognition. The Shah was very dissatisfied with the condition of the horses of the cavalry at Birjand. These animals were pur chased in the spring in Sistan and arrived at Birjand in fairly good condition. They have steadily deteriorated since. Fodder is comparatively expensive at Birjand and they have been presum ably on short rations. 106. Persian Officials .—The Rais Malieh, Sistan, Mirza Jalai Khan Khizrai has been relieved. His successor arrived with the Shah. He is Mirza Kazirn Khan Baigan. For a year past there have been con stant complaints to Tehran of the Rais’s corruption. It was openly discussed and the Rais himself frequently stated that he was obliged to take bribes, as he could not expect another appointment immedi ately his present term came to an end, and must lay by funds for the interval between appointments. Mirza Ghulam Hussain Khan took over charge of the telegraph office at Birjand on the 28th October from Abdul Aziz Khan. The latter was a quite in efficient youth. Reza Khan Mohamede who was pass^ port officer in Duzdap 1927 arrived at Sistan on 24th October and has been appointed Persian Consul at Chakanasur. 107. Soviet Activities —The activities of the Soviet Consulate at Sistan have been very carefully watched by the Persians. They are suspected of encouraging dis satisfaction among the cultivators of Mainkhangi and of inducing them to emigrate to Russian territory. On the grounds of preservation of public health the townspeople have been forbidden tc hold market in the square outside the Soviet Consulate. It was said that members of the Consulate used to mix with the crowd and disseminate com munistic propaganda. With reference to paragraph 64 of diarj 7 for June and paragraph 76 of the diary for July and also paragraph 87 for August I am informed that this individual, whose name was Rewar or Rival, was a Cheka agent and had been touring different parts of the country inspecting Soviet Consulates. He took out a passport as a Persian subject. This gave the Persians an opportunity to deal somewhat harshly with him. My informant— a highly placed Officer- indicated that a good deal was known of him and that he had been told to clear out of Sistan. He left Sistan quietly sometime in October and is believed now to be in the North of Persia. On the occasion of the Shah’s visit His Majesty’s Council met the Soviet Consul and his staff for the first time. The Consul was quite friendly and com plained bitterly of the conditions of service at Sistan. He said they would like to be able to spend the hot weather at Birjand as in pre-war times.—— istanlawli, J the Pe®[ ; 2ncoura§iB«| cultivator; lucing ritory, Oifi of puhitfe 1 been foil; uiareonisti was said i te used to i isseminato i so paragrafl ; jrmcd th 3 it‘ ; was lew it and W of the cotf ilates, Persian sitf i an oppo*’ fy with to 1 ' placed 01®' deal # ^ j : ; iad heentel t: He left Octoher W 1 a the S* 1 fti^ 1 3 I enquired if they had any intention of spending the next hot weather there. He then informed me in a whisper, having first ascertained that the Vice- Consul was engaged in conversation, that he was unwell, his wife also, and that he had applied for permission to return to Russia. At the interview with the Shah, the latter ask^d him pointedly whether there were any Russian subjects at Sistan, to which query he replied in the negative. Two flays later the Soviet Hospital was closed and a good deal of the furniture of the Consulate auc tioned. It was stated that the Con sulate would be closed, later informa- I lion, from a Persian official source is that a trade representative will be sent here. One Denikin (or Tanikin) was reported to be coming, but this was subsequently cancelled and no other name has yet been communicated from Tehran. The local officials have no intimation that any staff, except the Consul, are leaving but the Doctor and Vice-Consul are reported to be making preparations for a move. In view of the strained relations which have existed for some time past between the Frontier Commissary and the Russian Consul, and the Shah’s query, which must have been inspired by some previous knowledge of the situa tion, I am inclined to the belief that the Soviet have been required by the Per sians to reduce their staff here, on the grounds that they have no legitimate interests to protect. 108. Afghan affairs .—At the reception of the Consular Corps at Sistan the Shah instructed the Afghan Consul to call to see him later in the evening. It is not clear what transpired, but that some thing was discussed which was consi dered of a confidential nature may be inferred from the evasive replies given by the Governor of Birjand (who was present at the interview) Hisam-ud- Dowleh, who described the interview to His Majesty’s Consul in such a way as to leave no doubt that some matter of Political import was discussed, which he was not at liberty to divulge. What is certain is that the Shah spoke about a considerable sum of money which was seized by the Persian Customs at Sistan when it was imported from Afghanistan last year (vide Diary for April 1929) and a^ked the Vice-Consul whether he had received his pay after the fall of Amanullah He replied that he received no pay for several months. The Shah then ordered the money to be given to him and said that as it belonged to the|previous regim6 the present Gov ernment of Afghanistan had no claim to it and the Consul might consider it as arrears of pay of himself and staff. As the sum is said to amount to some 16,000 Tomans the Afghan Consul who has probably not seen so much pay in the whole of his service is reported to be jubilant. It may be added that the “ staff ” of the Afghan Cousul consists of one ne’er-do-well son, who performs the duties of Clerk and Attache and when not drunk has violent quarrels with his father, of a domestic nature. His Majesty’s Consul is led to the belief that the business of the Shah with with Afghan Consul was to enlist his support in some negotiations which may be contemplated with the Afghan Government, with a view to an alteration of the Sistan-Afghan boundary, or at any rate a revision of the distribution of the water of the Helmand, as pre viously settled by the Arbitration Com mission. If this surmise be correct, more will be heard of this when the Commis sion referred to in paragraph 101 has completed its report. If the Afghan Consul should be in a position to assist the Persians, which is doubtful, the fact that his douceur will consist of Afghan money, is not without its humourous aspect. He has not, so far, received the money and payment perhaps will be by results. Should he receive it in due course, he will have his own Government to contend with. Perhaps 16,000 Tomans and re tirement in peace in Persia may even then be preferable to a somewhat un certain future career and very problem atical pension. 109. Laivlessness .—At Duzdap, on the night of the 2nd/3rd November, a Baluch fired at a police sentry, who sub sequently died of the wound inflicted. Two men were arrested on suspicion, but the object of the crime is still unknown. 110. Miscellaneous .—With reference to paragraph 95 (Diary of October). Before the Duzap coining case was investigated there by the Indian police, in 1927, Tayab Ali, a member of the firm of Mohamad Ali Bros, succeeded in secret ing the dies of the coining machine. Both Tayab AH and Hari Chand have for some V c—■ 4 time been under suspicion as Agents of a Foreign Power. As reported in the diary for October, Tayab Ali was believed to have bribed Persian Officials to allow him to leave the country, or to extract the incriminat ing dies from the pipes in which they were found. In due course orders were received from Tehran to the effect that the Governer should hand over the pipes to the court and that they should there^ be opened in the presence of Persian On the 5th of November the court at D”zdap summoned an artificer to open the pipes. The Governor was seen to approach the Judge and to hold a whispered conversation, whereupon the artificer was dismissed and told that he would be summoned again later. In the meantime, however, Tayab Ah had been permitted on the 13th ^ ea ^ e Persia for Karachi, on the plea that he had to attend the court there. Under orders of the Government of India his passport was confiscated by the police on entry into India. On the 13th after the departure of Tayab Ali the pipes were opened m the presence of the following : The Governor, Naib Mahmud Khan of the Police, The Municipal Doctor, and two other Persians. The following dies were found. 1. English Sovereigns. 2. Turkish Liras. 3. Russian Roubles. 4. Persian Kran and two kran pieces. It is believed that the Governor and Judge were both bribed by Tayab Ali. They subsequently feigned ignorance of the fact that he had left Duzdap. They further contend that the “ Foreign Re presentative ” who should have attend ed the opening of the pipes was under stood to mean a “ representative of the Persian Foreign Ministry ” of whom there are none in Duzdap and so that part of the instructions could not be complied with ! A detailed report of this affair is being submitted. Eight Afghans and their families arrived at Duzdap on the 11th from Quetta en route to Herat. They were in possession of Krs. 5,000 whichSthey had purchased in Quetta for their expense? in Persia. T&gt; is Money was confiscated and they were unable to proceed. They were heard to say they would endeavour to return to Quetta by rail and with out taking tickets. The newspaper “ Siyasat ” of Lahore published the following in its issue of November 1st. “ Information emanates from Tehran to the effect that the Persian Ministry have engaged a Japanese Engineer for ^ months for railway work at a salary of Rs. 240 per month ”. The newspaper “ Zamindar ” of Lahore published the attached article about carrying of Consulate mails in Persia. The issue was that of October 22nd. 111.

Up to now Foreign Legations and their Consular Officers in Persia have had the distinctive concession of send ing their mails and reports to their res pective Governments under special arrangements which could not be in terfered with by the Persian Govern ment. Experience goes to show that all politi cal disturbances which have hitherto taken place were due to the existence of this political Dak system. Although the Persian Government has for a long time known of the dan gerous results of this system, still the situation did not allow them to place restrictions over it. Thank God that the Persian Govern ment are now in a position to put an end to this procedure under regulations, and have therefore issued a Farman to the effect that in future the mails be longing to Foreign Legations cannot be despatched under their own arrange ments, but everything will have to be put before the Persian Foreign Ministry, and with their permission will be despatched to foreign countries. The customs Officers on frontier posts have also been informed accordingly viz: —Before handing over the in-coming mails to the Legations or despatch of their out-going mails they should for ward them direct to the Persian Foreign Ministry. In order to exercise full control over the mails of Foreign Bepresentatives a special department has been created in the Persian Foreign Ministry. \ GIPD-m.T!) ;F«fePD~21-12-30-15.i o CONFIDENTIAL. 193 0 v' Diary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain for the months of September and October 1930. Delay in compilation of the monthly report has resulted from the non-receipt of reports from Vice-Consulates. 91. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— Sardars Nur Mahomed and Bijar Khan, sons of Jiand Khan (now in custody) have undertaken not to make further disturbances, but decline to surrender themselves as hostages to be detained at Kwash. On the other hand the General Officer Commanding has promised them that Jiand Khan will be released in about six months if the tribes remain peaceful. It is believed that the majority of the tribesmen who accompanied Ali Mohamed and Nowsherawan are reported to te in straightened circumstances. The former wrote to Syed Abdur Rahman of Dizzak asking him to inter cede with the General Officer Command ing and obtain permission for his return. The General Officer Commanding has ordered him to surrender to the military authorities at Mirjawa and further states that if he does so he will be sent to Tehran. The General Officer Command ing is confident that he will surrender, but it is doubtful if he will do so unless, as may be expected, he will be induced by the offer of a free pardon. Unfortu nately there is little likelihood of the terms of such an agreement being adhered to by the Persians and he would in all probability be imprisoned. From the above mentioned letter written to Syed Abdur Rahman it appears that Ali Muhammad is still unaware of the execu tion of Dost Mohamed since he mentions that he has learnt that he reached Herat safely and had gone to Kandahar. The General Officer Commanding has given 100 maunds of wheat to the families of the Yarmahomedzai sardars who are in custody and has paid them the arrears of the Sardars’ allowances. Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai still adopts a recalcitrant attitude towards the Military Governor but at the end of September a report was received to the effect that Idu Khan had succeeded in persuading him to go into Kwash and early in October he was seen by the General Officer Commandirg who treated him well and paid him part of his allow ance on the understanding that he would try to induce his brother Ahmed Khan and his followers who had fled to Afghan territory, to return to their homes. The \ armahomedzais who had threatened to emigrate are reported to have returned to their homes in the neighbourhood of Kwash. Shahbaz Khan, Bazurgzadeh has been appointed Governor of Dizzak and has been granted the whole of the cultivat- able land of the district. His grand father had originally owned this land but was dispossessed by Dost Mohamed some years ago. Zama Khan, B* mri, of Dehlegan has been appointed Governor of Bampur. They have hitherto refused to surrender their arms and it is said that the appoint ment is a ruse whereby the General Officer Commanding hopes to induce them to part with rifles without the necessity of undertaking military opera tions against them. Tne Gen°ral Officer Commanding is believed to intend to despatch a force against Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk, who has failed to comply with the orders regarding disarmament of his followers. Families of this tribe have been sent away to the hills. Frontier Incident. —About the 23rd of September certain Baluchis of Bakshan raided a Levy Post in British Mekran and looted four or five camels. A Jemadar and 25 Levies went in pursuit as far as Dizzak (in Persian territory). The General Officer Commanding went to Dizzak and eventually recovered the camels and returned them. He appar ently at first attempted to disarm the Levies and states that they covered him with their rifles. He has complained of this violation of the frontier. The matter is being reported to the Baluchistan authorities. It is understood that the General Officer Commanding has submitted a bill for the cost of maintaining the Levies while at Dizzak. Indian Shopkeepers in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. —Early in Septem ber a report was received that the General Officer Commanding had turned f four Indian traders out of Bampur and had given notice to others at Kwash to remove their shops. His Majesty’s Consul asked to be informed as to the ENCLOSUHh 'N ffilA FOREIGN SF Letter * [152 Dated &lt; DEC. 1930 ■ leoeiveo 22fi u2 &gt; grounds for their expulsion. It is believ ed that the Bampur traders had written direct to Tehran claiming that they were due 12 000 rupees from Dost Mahomed when he was fighting the Persian troops. As a result of the enquiry from this Consulate the General Officer Command ing has informed us that he has cancelled his previous orders and will al ow the shopkeepers to remain, having taken guarantees that they will not sell smug gled goods. During the conversation he remarked that he had orders rom Tehran not to allow Foreign traders in localities where there was no Consular \ representative. For some reason which it has been impossible to accurately gauge, the General Officer Commanding | has several times impressed on Dis Maiesty’s Consul the desirability of our having a Consular Agent in the fearhad. • As previously reported our commitments in that area scarcely warrant an appoint ment. 92. Siatan mid Kainat. —In Sistan the officials of the National Bank appear to be obt lining a degree of influence altogether out of proportion to their bn -mess standing. As merchants havo no other source from which they can arrange to finance business they are greatlv in the Bank’s power. r Ihe super vision apparently exercised over the Revenue and Customs Department offi cials has also greatly increased the prestige of the Bank in the eyes of the local officials. Polling took place in the last days of August in the Miankhangi district. The only candidates for the Mejlis was Asadi, who was duly returned. Shaikh Paindeh Khan (holder of the title of Khan Sahib), a former British Indian subject who assumed Persian nationaflty, made over all his property in Sistan to his sons, who are of age and still British subjects, and removed all his belongings and family to Afghan istan. It is said that he intends to complain to the Central Governme’t at Tehran of the oppression he suffered at the hands of Persian officials. Large quantities of barley and flour have been sent from Sistan to Duzdap for the supply of troops in the Sarhad. A gallows was recently erected outside the Soviet Consulate and tw T o men were hanged. A further batch of eight are said to be shortly to suffer the same fate. The Frontier Commissary, Sarhang Murteza Khan, is said to have had somy serious difference of opinion with the Russian Consul. It is possible that the Russians objected to the gallows being erected outside the Consulate gate, and it is generally inferred that the site was selected as a warning to evil-doers of the results of lawlessness, which state of affairs is believed by the Sarhang to have been encouraged by the Soviet Consulate. The impending visit of His Imperial Majesty The Shah to Kain and Sistan is causing some iexcitement. Processional arches were erected at Birjand, but are being demolished under orders from Tehran. At Duzdap all shopkeepers were made to whitewash their premises, but an unexpectedly early fall of rain has rendered the buildings even less pleasing to the sight than before. Gangs of labourers are feverishly carrying out temporary repairs to the Duzdap-Meshed road. In Sistan it is confidently expected that the Shah will give a decision about the system of land tenure and it is hoped that those agriculturalists who have for many years tilled the soil will be given a definite titlejto its ownership on agreeing to pay some of the arrears of revenue over a term of years. The present system of leasing land to the highest tidder every! few years has resulted in neglect of the land, since improvements are liable to result in the occupier being superseded by a higher bidder. Any system which would give the farmers a direct claim to the ownership of land would ultimately benefit the revenue of the district. 93. Persian Military affairs .—150 cons- * cripts from the Kain area were sent to Duzdap and the Sarhad for training m the end of August. Most of the troops from Bakshan and Iransheher have been concentrated at Kwash. It is said that this move took place as they were suffering greatly from Malaria. The probable reason is that a good show is to be made at Kwash lor the Shah’s visit. Similarly alb but a small detachment, of the troops a Duzdap have been sent to Kwasti. Saitip Azizullah Khan, supreme com mander of the Amnieh in Persia visited Birjand, Sistan and Duzdap early m October, presumably to make arrange ments for the Shah’s visit.94. Pei •sian officials .—The Reis-i- Sulhieh intends shortly to leave Sistan and to open his Court at Duzdap. There is no news of any successor. Shahzadeh Nair Mirza has been appointed Chief of Posts and Telegraphs, Duzdap. Mirza Ahmed Khan Qadimi, a clerk in the Persian Legation, Kabul, arrived at Duzdap on the 23rd September and returned the following day to Quetta. The object of this hasty visit was not known. 95. Soviet Activities .—The Soviet Vice- Consul and his wife (reported to be a German) returned to Sistan from Meshed on September 2nd. The Soviet Consulate was not represented at an official dinner party given by the Governor of Sistan to all officials including members of His Majesty’s Consulate staff at Sistan. It is believed that Sarhang Murteza Khan declined to meet them at the party. Predit Echensinj (mentioned in previ ous diaries) with Yoori Bizrofoff and Yoori Workho«ki arrived at Duzdap from Meshed on September 6th. They again described themselves as ‘ Locust Ex perts The passport of Predit Echensinj was found to be time-expired and they were detained pending a reference to Meshed. The General Officer Command ing in the Sarhad reported them as sus pect persons and suggested that they be not allowed to visit Duzdap in future. Subsequently they were permitted to return to Meshed via Kerman. Iskandar Zatishkoff, Soviet Vice- Consul, Sistan, together with the wife of the Soviet Consul, arrived at Duzdap on the i6th September and ret rued on the 18th. He had with him samples of Russian piece goods and endeavoured to secure orders from Persian traders. It is reported that he met with no success. He also offered the Agency for Russian petrol to Mirza Rahullah, Qazurani and Coy. but the offer was declined. The Vice-Consul said that he had been deputed by the Soviet Minister at Tehran to enquire into the working of the Exchange Law at Duzdap. He visited 1 the Director of Customs several times. He also made enquiries as to the where abouts of Predit E^chensinj and his com panions and expressed annoyance at their not having informed him of their departure from Duzdap. 96. Afghan Affairs.—It is believed that the Afghan Consul, Sistan, has received instructions to issue Nationality certi ficates to all Berberis in Sistan. Afghan subjects arriving in Birjand have complained that they have been charged a fee for inoculation against cholera at the frontier. 97. Lawlessness .—Apart from the usual robberies with violence which continue in the Sistan area, the remain der of the Consulate District has been free frym the activities of robbers. 98. Miscellaneous .—Russian petrol is being sold by weight. Drivers complain of short contents of the tins sold by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. ’ A conscription committee has been formed at Birjand. (c) Haji Mohammad Naski has announced that he is the Soviet Agent in Birjand. He recently convened a. meeting of traders to induce them to buy Russian sugar. They offered to do so if cost of freight to Birjand be borne by the Soviet and sales limited to the merchants who were present at the meeting. Mohammed Nasiri said he would have to refer to the Soviet Consul at Sistan. [d The National Bank has opened a branch at Birjand. Herr Auer is at present in charge. I ^ Cholera having ceased in Afghanistan the restrictions on the frontier have been removed. In 1927-28 a coining case was tried in Karachi courts which resulted in .the conviction of most of the members of the firm of Mohammad Ali Brothers of Duzdap and Sistan and also of a Euro pean named Dickson. A press machine was discovered at Duzdap at the time and was sent to Karachi, but before the arrival of the police Tayeb Ali had succeeded in burying the dies in the hills near Duzdap. It was recently believed that one Mohamed Khan, a motor driver had removed the dies in his lorry. He was accused of this by his employer, N. A. Mullick, and confessed that he knew the place of hiding. The matter was reported to the Governorate by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul and troops were sent with the driver. The dies, hidden in two iron pipes were recovered. They are believed to be capable of coining the following :— German coins. Rupees. / Persian kran and two kran piece. Turkish Liras. American dollars and Russian v coins.— * T 4 The Governor has referred to Tehran for orders. He has not yet opened the pipes to check the contents. It is report ed that members of the firm of Tayeb Ali are making efforts to induce the police or Governor to extract the incr' - minating dies from the pipes. Both Tayeb Ali and Hari Chand, who are concerned are suspected of acting as agents of a foreign power and are thoroughly bad characters. Tayeb Ali was the prime mover in the agitation among Indians in East Persia on the occasion of Gandhi’s arrest. It would seem that the Persians would be fully justified in expelling them from Persia even if no more severe action be taken against them. 99. Movements of Foreigners .—The following arrived at Duzdap from Kerman on September 23rd :— (1) Alexander I-ubich—Czecho- Slovac, (2) Rudolf Matous—German, (3) Martin Walter Walke—German, (4) Petro Stoyo Dimoff—Russian. They were in possession of passports vise by His Britannic Majesty’s Consul- General in Tehran available for India. They arrived at 1 a.m. and went straight on by car to Lar, where their conveyance was damaged, and they returned to Duzdap. The following day the police received telegraphic instructions from Tehran to detain 1 and 3 on the grounds that their car belonged to the Fiat Coy. of Tehran and had been taken without authority. No. 4 proceeded on foot to India, but subsequently took the train at Warecha. No. 2 is awaiting a decision about the others. Lubich is an engineer and states that they intend to go to Java and thence to Holland. 1 and 3 after an ineffectual attempt to evade the police and proceed to India, have gone to Tehran to settle their case. 100. Movements of British subjects .— Mrs. Thomp-on, a Russian subject by marriage, arrived at Duzdap and pro ceeded to India on September 24th. C. K.

The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. •—The General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad was at Duzdap for a few days at the end of July. On his return to the Sar had (Kwash) he drew 26,000 Krans from the National Bank. It was said that the amount represented allowances for the sardars, which had been discontinued some pionths ago. His allowance for a period of two months was sent to Juma Khan Ismailzai. It is not yet known whether he has accepted, as he has previously in formed the General Officer Commanding that he would accept no further pay from the Persian Government. As foreshadowed in the previous Diary the following Sardars who have been under arrest for some time past, were brought to Duzdap and subsequently sent upcountry en route to Tehran:— 1. Jiand Khan, 2. Shah Sowar and his son J3. The son of Sardar Nur Mohamed Zabid. 4. Lashkar Khan, Gumshadzai. 5. Izat Khan—motabir. Nur Mahomed and Bijar Khan, son of Jiand Khan, left their homes and encamped in the Dastgird hills. Idu Khan was des patched with 40 Baluchis to induce them to meet the General Officer Commanding at Kwash. The mission failed and at the end of the month ft was reported that Bijar had informed the General Officer Commanding that, as his father had sent to Tehran, he and his followers would leave Persian territory. He is believed to have entered British territory at Mashkel. Troops are being concentrated at Kwash and the intention of the General Officer Commanding is to start operations in Octo ber for disarming the tribes in the Chahbar area, particularly Abdul Hussain of Remishk and Zama Khan of Dehlgan who ha\e hitherto proved intractable. 84. Sistan and Qainat. —Sardar Mahomed Ali Khan has apparently been offered the Deputy Governorship of the Miankhangi district, Sistan. He formerly held this post under the old regime in Persia, and then had full powers to deal with crime m that area. Now it is proposed that Jo powers should be very limited and tha &lt; 'Oiary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and ICain, for the month of August 1930, offenders against the law should be dealt with by means of the Amnieh and Courts. The Sardar expressed his disapproval of these methods, saying that the Amnieh were corrupt and the court, ponderous and ineffective. The method, whereby accused were released on bail, was particularly displeasing, as it was a wild population, and such accused would be likely to take advantage of their release to avenge them selves on him or his followers. A bazar rumour at Sistan, which gained considerable credence, was to the effect that Mr. Ward of the Duzdap Mission, who is now in Sistan, had converted to Christ ianity some 30 of the inhabitants of Bun- jar. and had offered money as an induce ment. The rumours are of course baseless, but are an indication of the popular feel ing in regard to evangelistic work in Sistan. It is extremely doubtful if the authorities will permit the Mission to open a hospital and bring out a Missionary lady-doctor, for which they are striving to obtain per mission in Tehran. 85. Persian Military Affairs. —Feverish attempts are being made to make a favour able impression on His Majesty the Shah when he will visit East Persia in the near future. At Kwash, in the Sarhad, barracks are being hastily repaired, sanction has been accorded to the expenditure of Ton. a ns 7,000 on electrical equipment there, and an Indian has been despatched to India to purchase material. In the present state of the country's finances, and in view of the urgent need for funds to encourage agricul ture, etc., in the Sarhad, such expenditme can only be regarded as a calamity. 86. Persian Officials.- —Ax-Sultan Ali Khan Lashkari (paragraph 40 of Diary for April 1930) has returned to Sistan having been dismissed from the service on release from imprisonment. The Reis-i-Malieh, Sistan, under orders of transfer, has now been informed that his relief has declined to go to Sistan. I he Persian Vice-Consul at Chakansur and the Customs Officer, Sistan, both of whom are anxious to be transferred, are anxiously awaiting relief. 87. Soviet Activities. —With reference to paragraph 76 of Diary for J uly.of the Meshed police was to the effect that the ‘ Jowaz ’ held by Predit Echensmj was not valid, that he is a Soviet Agent, and was to be returned under escort to Meshed. Subsequently the General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad ordered him to return to Meshed, but did not subject him to a Military guard. Reference paragraph 64 of Diary fqr June. Of the two Persians previously mentioned as being Soviet agents, and hav ing been turned out of Kwash by the Genera Officer Commanding, one—named Abui Hassan, son of Naziri—recently again went to Kwash. The General Officer Command ing again sent him to Duzdap and threaten ed to shoot him, if again caught in the bar- bad Meanwhile his companion, Hap Mahomed, had come to Duzdap from Sistan the hope of joining Abul Hassan at Kwash. On learning the fate of his friend he abandoned his intentions and returned to Sistan. Shah Quli Khan and his father of Sistan, well known bad characters, and for some time past believed to be Soviet agents, have become Soviet subjects. No expla nation has been forthcoming as to how they qualified for this change of Nationality, while in their own country. Haji Abdul Wahid, at one time employed by the Russians in North Persia, and now living at Birjand, recently indulged in a good deal of Anti-British propaganda in the town. It is significant that this occur red about the time the Soviet Vice-Consul at Sistan passed through Birjand en route to Meshed, i.e., about August 9th and after. As the result of a severe reprimand by Shaukat-ul-Mulk, this individual has ceased to openly display an interest in politics. A Russian ‘ Locust Expert ’ named Burt arrived at the Soviet Consulate, Sistan, at the end of July and left for Meshed on 2nd August. M. Rowar, the recently appointed Attache at the Soviet Consulate, Sistan, holds a passport which he obtained from the Per sian Legation at Moscow on 8th June 1929, under the name of Mirza Khalil Sat tar. He presumably also holds a Russian pass port for use as required. There are indi cations that at many of the Persian Consu lates abroad passports are issued with very little or no care. The cause for this may be a desire to secure passport fees, possibly a welcome form of income when the month ly pay cheque of the Consulate is in ‘arrears.’ 88. Afghan Affairs. —It appears that the Persians now claim that only those Ber- beris who came to Persia subsequent to the establishment of an Afghan Consulate in the area in which they reside, can be considered as Afghan subjects, all others being claimed as Persians. Some Berberies who held Afghan passports were recently^ called to the Police station at Sistan ano were informed that they would be con sidered as Persian subjects. The staff of the Afghan Consulate at Sistan are experiencing difficulty in regard to receipt of their salaries. Money is stated to be regularly remitted from Kabul and traceable to Chakansur where it ap parently vanishes. Frantic appeals to the Persian customs officer at Sistan for assist ance on the frontier to ensure the safe transit of this money, have so far met with little encouragement. 89. Lawlessness .—Cases of robbery with violence continue to occur with frequency in the Miankhangi area of Sistan. The Frontier Commissary has recently informed the local Sardars that they will be held personally responsible for thefts which occur in their districts. This curious move on the part of Sarhang Murteza Khan is not as Gilbertian as might at first appear. Some of the local Sardars are not above sus picion of affording refuge to robbers or in deed of employing them to do a little work on their account. Another expedient of the Sarhang is based on the ‘ set a thief, etc.’ principle, and he has engaged Allah Dad and Mirza Khan, both most notorious thieves, to act as his informers. A case of counterfeiting of coin came to light at Bunjar. It is said that the false 5 kran pieces shewed very creditable work manship), erring perhaps on the side of too great accuracy. 90. Miscellaneous .—Gustav Auer, Ins pector of the National Bank, visited Duzdap for a few days and arrived later in the month at Birjand to open a new branch of the Bank at the latter place. He is ac companied by a tahvildar, who is a relative of an employee of the Imperial Bank of Persia at Birjand. Shortly after the arrival of Herr Auer, a Persian officer told His Majesty s Consul that he had been informed that telegraphic instructions had been received from Tehran to the effect that all merchants should trans fer their accounts to the National Bank from the Imperial Bank of Persia failing which they would be fined. In Sistan every effort N being made to induce shopkeepers to move into premises on the new Khaiyabans, in anticipation of the Shah’s visit. ■it; ^ 011 at L' le I H\ !Ct8, it tleyfi; e for tlr &gt;.

Later Mahmud Khan, a rela- ot J ^ dl1 Khan &gt; was sent by the General Omeer Commanding to Robat to induce these refugees to return. He was unsuccess ful as also was Idu Khan who was after wards sent on a similar mission. They then shifted to Robat in British territory and have applied for permission to remain. The matter has not yet been settled. Practically all the Yarmuhammadzais have emigrated to British Mashkel. Ser- dars Nur Mahomed and Bijar Khan, son of Jiand Khan, are still at their homes awaiting the release from custody of Jiand. It is said that the General Officer Commanding has repeatedly been instructed to send the latter to Tehran, but hesitates lest such action should definitely decide the remainder of the tribe to emigrate. The General Officer Commanding is alleged to have instructed Idu Khan to ascertain from the Consulate whether the British authorities approved of the continued retention of Jiand in custody as his tribe had at times caused disturbances on the frontier. Idu suspected this as a ruse to discover whether he was in touch with the Consulate and replied that he had no means of approaching British officials. As the General Officer Commanding is not ordinarily backward in approaching the Consulate himself, it is not clear what his object may have been in this move. Din Muhammad Dushtiari is said to be still in custody at Chahbar and his followers are being disarmed. Many are reported to have fled to British territory. An informant alleges that the General Officer Commanding stated that he had previously been told that the British were instigating Din Muhammad to oppose the Persians, but that since his arrest no action has been taken by the British and he now discredits the informa tion.

The General Officer Commanding has admitted that they were the property of the British Govern ment and were given with the approval of he General Officer Commanding at that time m the Sarhad, but has demanded that they be surrendered to him in lieu of arms taken from Ali Mohamed, etc., at Panjgur, which were not returned to the Persian Gov ernment. The matter has not been settled, but meanwhile the Rekis are collecting other arms of the tribe. Sardar Zama Khan Bamri of Dehlegan has refused to surrender arms and has retired to the hills at Rodbar, The General Officer Commanding contemplates action against him in the winter. The General Officer Commanding is re ported to have sent a Baluch (Din Moham mad of Dawar Paneh Dizak) to Panjgur to find out the means of livlihood of Ali Muhammad and his followers and the ex tent of British allowances given them. This man is said to have been sent last year to Karachi on some mission. It is said that he was arrested there as a suspicious person, but was subsequently released on the inter vention of the Persian Consul there. No such information was received in this Con sulate at the time. The Rekis have surrendered about 50 muzzle loading rifles. They are said to be disposing of their good rifles to one Mirza Khan, an Afghan gun-runner who is in the hills near Kwash and is alleged to have Rs. 10,000 for the purchase of arms. A total of 200 rifles in addition to the 71 of British origin are demanded from the Rekis. Juma Khan Ismailzai handed in a further 15 rifles and has completed the demand made upon him.r* I r x ' HP ’i f t*- i A later report is to the effect that the General Officer Commanding has recover the 71 rifles irom Idu and asked for tions from Tehran as to their disposal. He was asked to explain how they , possession of these arms He is *2 ^ replied that on the withdrawal of the Br ™ in 1924 the Bekis road guards had no arm and on the request of Salar-nAmja, , General Officer Commanding m Sl g a “: “ British left these rifles with the Bek' _ enable them to guard the roads. T he 14 tish never having demanded their return t he Bekis now considered them their own pro perty and as such he was justified m recov e ing them for the Persian Government. Idu Khan has collected 20 rifles from the Gumshadzais and handed them over to General Officer Commanding. It to estimate with any accuracy number of arms which have Been recoveied from the tribes, but there can he bttle dou but that with the steady co ^ s ?, atlon ° f and the continued sale to A g ans such confiscation, the tribes of the Saihad have been considerably weakened in matter of weapons. ^ On July 18th the General Officer Com manding informed our Vice-Consulate at Duzdap that he had received a message from Azam Khan, a Sardar of Quetta dis- trict compMnmg tliat he was badly treated by the British and requesting permission to emigrate with his tribe to Persian Baluchis tan The General Officer Commanding said he had deferred giving any reply, but would be obliged to allow them to stay m Persian territory if they came. The matter has been duly reported to the Baluchistan autho rities The individual referred to would ,r to be Azam Khan, brother j&gt;f the Khan of Kelat. ^ Wjtl 4A : An Imperial Farman has been issued for the return of a member for Baluchistan to the Persian Mejlis. 73. Sistan and Qainat.—Some time ago the Manager of the National Bank at Sistan con vened a sort of Economic conference, which was attended by the Persian officials and a few Indians, with a view to discussing means of improving trade and agriculture in Sis tan. Finally it was decided that Gurba- chan Singh, the leading Sikh, who sets up as an expert on all matters, should submit a report which would be forwarded to Tehran with the Bank Manager's comments. His Majesty’s Consul later had an opportunity to see a copy of the report. The recommenda tions if adopted would, at a conservative estimate, absorb the entire revenues of Persia for the next five years : It is interesting to note that, in connec tion with the forthcoming election of a Deputy for Sistan, several of the leading gar bars asked a member of the Consulate staff to name the person who would be ‘ pe&lt;S sona grata ’ to the British Consul They were told that the matter did not interest the Consulate in any way. Under orders from Tehran a Municipal committee has been instituted for Sistan, Competition was alleged to be keen and bribery freely resorted to. It is understood that the following have been elected:— Sardar Muhammad Reza—Malik Mohamad Ali Khan—Abdulla Herate—Haji Abbas Nasirzadeh—Sardar Ali Khan—Haji Shaik ' * H asan Bun]an. It is reported that in refusing applications from traders for Rupee drafts on India, the Manager of the National Bank makes no attempt to disguise the fact that the Per sians do not want goods to be imported from India, This is probably a ruse to cover the absence of available rupee exchange, but it has given rise to a bazaar rumour that the Germans, Belgians and Russians have com bined with the Persians in an endeavour to bring about the downfall of Indian trade. 74, Persian Military Affairs. —Represen tations to the Head of the Amnieh have proved successful and it is said that the Road Guards in the Sistan area will not now be withdrawn. Further conscription in Sistan is to commence in two months. The men will be trained locally. 400 horses are to be pur chased locally. With a body of cavalry, said to be going to Sistan shortly, and the training centre it is estimated that the garri son will be raised to 1,000. All conscripts who were recently accepted by the Revision Committee of those who escaped conscrip tion last year, have been sent to Duzdap. Mirza Ahmad Rod, Assistant Customs Oft cer, who was conscripted, committed smc at Duzdap, after an unsuccessful attempt to evade military duty. Naib Hussan Khan, recently appointed Reis-i-Amnieh, Sistan, has dismisse opium addicts from the service. Some 200 men of Meshad Brigade arnved at Birjand from Duzdap on the IG proceeded to Meshed. Twenty Baluchis have been conscnp e at Duzdap. In connection with the transport of from Duzdap to Meshad the Mi' rities there resorted to a new method ot niandeermg motor transpor . fc . owners were ordered to supply JO lorTlieV demanded Ts 10 per head but were o^ered Ts'8. On refusing this rate guards Were posted on all garages with orders to jnermit no lorries to leave until the rate was &gt; 3 cepted. Lorries are said to have been held up in the garages for ten days, mean while some 200 pilgrims who had arrived from India were unable to obtain transport. At the end of June 6 lorries belonging to In dians took goods to Kwash. They were detained there by the military and sent with troops to Iransheher. On return the frames of two cars were broken, but the other four were again sent to Iransheher. Owing to inefficient arrangements the Reis-i-Malieh of Iransheher and a soldier succumbed to thirst en route. It is said that the lives of all were in danger, but were saved by a Sindi-Hindu trader who was with the party and who knew of a spring in the hills and was able to obtain the help of some Baluchis from a distance of 12 miles. None of these lorries have yet returnd to Duzdap so that full details are still lacking. The following is believed to be the present distribution of troops in the Sarhad and Baluchistan Kwash . , Zabali Fauj Camelry . Artillery . . 400 . 550 . 50 4 guns and 4 machine guns. (Of the cameb fy only 100 are mounted.) Bakshan . Zatah • &lt; 140 Mostly recently con - scripted from Sistan. Gusht . . Zabali . 15 Duzdap . Zabali .

Persian Officials.— Reis-i-Gum- ruk, Sistan (Mirja Muhamad Khan Ghaf- fari) has proceeded on sick leave and is to be replaced from Duzdap. As appears to be the case with all the Customs staff in this area, he was very anti-British. Mirza Quli Khan Farzam, Persian Consul at Chakansur, is shortly to be relieved, having been adver sely reported on by Sarhang Murteza Khan. Mirza Jalal-ud-din Khizrai, Reis-i-Malieh, Sistan, is said to be about to be relieved by Badi-ul-Mumalik who officiated in 1925. It is known that he has amassed a consider able fortune during his term at Sistan. Agha Saulati returned from Tehran and resumed charge of the telegraph at Duz dap. Mirza Baqar Khan, Azimi, Persian Consul General, Delhi, passed through Duzdap en route to Simfa at the beginning of July. At a dinner in Birjand he contrived to give His Majesty’s Consul the impression that he was persona grata with His Excellency the Vice roy, the Foreign Secretary and other high officials in India and was an esteemed mem ber of their family circles. He explained, while declining the offer of champagne at dinner, that he had been forbidden wines by his medical adviser at Simla. This did not, however, deter him from disposing of 14 whiskies and sodas which he freely ordered for himself both during and after the meal. The entertainment was fortunately at the house of His Excellency Shaukat-ul-Mulk, not the Consulate. Agha Mirza Jawad Khan, Persian Vice- Consul at Delhi, arrived at Duzdap from India on the 19th July. 76. Soviet Activities. —M. Rawar (Rival ?) has been appointed Attache at Sistan in place of Jarbegoff (Jarbekian) who left in June. M. Rawar proceeded to Meshad to meet his wife, said to be a German. It is learnt that the General Officer Com manding in the Sarhad has forbidden shop keepers in Kwash to deal in Russian goods. ! ' With reference to paragraph 64 of Diary for June. Predit Echensinj, accompanied by two Armenians again turned up at Duz dap at the end of July. He styles himself ‘ Reis-bMallackh ’ (Locust Expert) and in sists that he wishes to investigate locust invasions at Bampur. When he was turned back from Duzdap in June he had no police permit. On his recent arrival he produced a time-expired permit from Meshad. On being told he could not go to Bampur, he said he would proceed to Kerman (possib ly with the object of getting to Bampur from there). The police have wired to Meshad to ascertain if a permit for Kerman may be granted. The result has not yet been reported. 77. Afghan Affairs. —An individual des cribed as the ‘ Grand Vazir 5 is said to have recently visited Fareh and to have reduced taxation. Sardar Ghulam Ahmed Khan, Mahomed- zai, newly appointed Afghan Consul General at Meshad arrived at Duzdap on 1st July accompanied by the following :— (1) Obaidullah Khan. (2) Sardar Muhammad Akhtar Khan. (3) Sardar Mohamad Amin Khan. During his short stay at Duzdap he was approached by the local Hazaras who asked that Afghan passports might be issued to them. He promised to take up the matter on his arrival at Meshad. A rumour was current at Duzdap to the effect that Abdur Rahim, Governor of Herat, had been supplied with arms by theHhhf 0 Russians to oppose Nadir Khan. It was said that he had called upon the local ^ardars to state whether they would accept him as King and that they replied in the affirmative. 78. Lawlessness .—A report from Deha- nehbaghi indicates that marauding bands of Ismailzais have appeared in the vicinity of the Sipeh-Duzdap road. Sardar Ah bhah Khan, with some Road-guards has taken up a position in the hills twelve miles from Duzdap to watch their activities. On July 5th an Indian Lorry driver was fired at near Shamidar. Seven persons attempted to hold up his lorry, but he suc ceeded in escaping and reported to the Amnieh post at Hormuk whence mounted men were despatched in pursuit of the aggressors. On July 5th the window of a locked carri age standing at Duzdap station was broken and cash in the carriage stolen. 79. Communications .—The Biweekly train service from Quetta to Duzdap has been temporarily restricted to one train a week owing to damage to the main INorth Western Railway line in India with which the Duzdap extension connects. 80. Movements of Foreigners.—-hi. Rawar, Attache at the Soviet Consulate, Si&amp;tan, left that place for Meshad on July 6th. W. Lucas, German tourist, arrived at Duzdap on the 21st July and proceeded to India on the 3rd August. 81. Movements of British Subjects. —Mr. and Mrs. Douglas, Imperial Bank of Persia, arrived at Duzdap from Kerman on the 5th and proceeded to India. Dr. H. L. Clift of Bangalore Mission arriv ed at Duzdap on the 8th July and accom panied by Mr. Ward of Duzdap Mission pro ceeded on a short visit to Sistan. Rev. Malcolm of the Duzdap Mis? ion visit, ed Birjand. He was desirous of visiting surrounding villages for evangelical work but was not granted a pass to tour by the local police and returned to Duzdap. Mr. W. H. Dowling, Anglo-Persian Oil Company, visited Birjand, Duz^lap and Sis tan during the month, from his headquar ters at Meshad, Her Highness Dera Kalan Begum of Khairpur State, with a considerable follow ing, arrived at Duzdap on the 8th and pro ceeded on pilgrimage to Meshad. Lieutenant R. K. M. Saker, 1/1 Oth Ba- luch Regiment, passed through Duzdap for India on the 13th on completion of a tour in Persia. Captain Hamidullah Khan of the same Regiment, who had entered Persia with Lieutenant Saker, returned to Duzdap later, and while there was visited by two members of the Sikh community both of whom are well known to be disloyal. 82. Miscellaneous .—Medical posts have been established at several places on the Perso-Afghan frontier and travellers from Afghanistan are subjected to inoculation. As there is no quarantine station at Duz dap, passengers arriving were sent under military guard to serais in the town where they were permitted to remain, the serai owners being held responsible that they did not leave Duzdap before the expiry of the quarantine period. The military authori ties have caused indignation at Duzdap b}^ seizing all fruit and vegetables imported from Quetta. Some were subsequently handed to consignees, but much fruit was withheld and destroyed. Since Duzdap is dependent for supplies of this nature on imports from Quetta and cholera does not exist there, the action taken seems to have been unnecessary. C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain. MC497FD—20—9-9-30—' # CONFIDENTIAL. 'jDiary of His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, month of June, 1930 i,n, fqt the 59. His Majesty's Consular Oncers.—The Medical Officer and Ex-officio Vice-Consul at Sistan proceeded to Duzdap on June 2nd to meet his family and returned on June 5th. His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan proceeded on a short tour in the Birjand district for five days in June, during the Persian Mu- harram holidays. 60. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchis tan. —Although the Rekis have not yet been definitely ordered to hand in their arms, some of the smaller sardars who are on good terms with the Persians have voluntarily handed in a few rifles. If the sardars now in custody (vide Ap pendix to Diary for April and paragraph 48 of Diary for May) be sent to Tehran, the Yarmohammadzais and Gumshadzais are said to contemplate migration to Afghanis tan. They apparently do not favour British territory because they would be re quired to surrender their arms. Reference paragraph 48 of Diary for May. Juma Khan has handed in 67 rifles. He was instructed to surrender a further thirty- ten magazine and twenty muzzle-loading. Of these he has recently sent in 15. Reference paragraph 36 Diary for April. Subedar Jamuluddin has removed to Af ghanistan accompanied by his family. Juma Khan still declines to visit the General Officer and has said that he neither desires payment of his allowance which is five months in arrears nor will he accept the allowance in future. Sardar Nur Muhammad Yarmuhammad- zai made an unsuccessful attempt to obtain permission to reside in British territory. He has written to Idu Khan that if the latter cannot secure the speedy release of the sardars now in custody, he will take his section with him to Afghanistan. The General Officer Commanding ap« pears at last to be endeavouring to assist bhe tribes towards improving agriculture. V sum of money and implements have been yiven to Beroze Kurd of Sangoon to enable iim to repair the Sangoon Kerez for the ise of his followers. The Persians are ^pairing Sohrabad Karez and have said ;hat on completion it will be handed oyer dC318FD to the Yarmuhammadzais. Money has been given the Rekis to improve Mohabad Karez for the use of the tribe, and they have been told that they will be given funds to enable them to put in order the Siah- Rishak Karez situated about 8 miles from Kwash. Assistance of this nature has been long overdue and will do far more towards tranquilising the Sarhad than all the punitive expeditions hitherto carried out. Objection has been made by the Central authorities at Tehran to the payment of allowances to the Sardars for supplying road guards. It is alleged that since the country has been occupied by regular troops, tribal road guards should be unne cessary. Allowances have therefore ceased. The General Officer Commanding will enrol 60 Amnieh, to be independent of the sardars. When disarmament of the tribes has been completed, he proposes to recommend a few selected Sardars for allowances. The tribal Road Guards have not been paid for the past five months. It is reported that the General Officer Commanding has arrested Sardar Din Mohammed Dostari of Chabar with 20 followers and that they are being brought to Kwash. 61. Sistan and Qainat. —The Amir Shau- kat-ul-Mulk has returned from Tehran. He has been very reticent about what took place there. The visit of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to East Persia, if it mate rialises in the autumn, will probably throw a considerable financial burden on Shaukat- ul-Mulk and his relatives, the heriditary governors of Kain and Sistan. No reigning Shah has visited these localities for nearly 200 years. The Indian ‘ National flag ’ which had been hoisted by Sikhs at Sistan has been removed. Interest in the demonstration there appears to have died down. The son of the Afghan Consul is said to have stated that ££ had Amanullah been on the throne he would doubtless have assisted the Indians at this juncture.” The Persian Newspaper ££ Naubahar ’ has published an article, persumably ins pired, applauding the awakening of the Asiatic peoples to the designs of Great ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREiGN SFor :—» pw.o Letter I r &gt; /W j (Wi t,, i2 Britain in India. It attributes the fall of the Czarist regime in Russia to Rritis intrigues directed to prevent India falling into Russian hands! British Indian subjects in Sistan have recently been interrogated by the Police as to the duration of their residence m bis- tan, extent of their families, their business, etc Passports have also been examined The reasons for these enquiries have not transpired. It is possible that the recent anti-British demonstrations have induced the Persians to think that it may be an easy matter to persuade the Indians, more or less permanently domiciled in East Persia, to adopt Persian Nationality. The Municipal authorities at Sistan made informal enquiries from a member of our Consulate Staff as to whether the Consulate has a record of all the property, with dimen sions, owned by British subjects m Sistan. It appears that a report has been called ior by the Central authorities and accurate in formation could not be obtained from the Revenue Department. The Vice-Consul instructed the Attach^ to reply that the matter could not be put up to His Majesty s Consul unless an official communication was made. This has not been forthcoming and the Municipality is credited with the intention of carrying out the measurement of such properties. The Reis-i-Sulhieh, Duzdap, who is at present in Sistan has been permitted to extend his stay there, as he could not dispose of all the cases pending. Meanwhile Duz dap is without a court and the system of combining both Sistan and Duzdap under one court is most unsatisfactory. The police have shewn renewed activity in prosecuting persons for failure to observe the regulations regarding the wearing of the National headdress and the abolition of Abas. An unusual incident recently occurred at Sistan. The cultivators of Deh Akbar-i- Abbas came to town en masse and protested against the treatment meted out to them by Sardar Muhammad Riza, who farms the lands from the Government. They de manded direct leases. Two ringleaders were imprisoned in the Military Barracks. They subsequently withdrew their allega tions. It is difficult at present to judge whether they had been instigated by Persian officials with a view to bringing about the eventual abolition of the farming system, or whether they had been encouraged by the Soviet Consulate.* Certain it is that they are not likely to have made such a demons tration without outside encouragement. The main crops have been successfully harvested in the Qainat, but Summer crops and vegetables have sufiered severely, in some parts from the ravages of locusts. 62. Persian Military Affairs .—Yawar Sikandar Khan, Officer Commanding Fauj- i-Zabali, has been appointed Cantonment Commandant as Duzdap. He will also be in charge of the troops at Sistan. Owing to the improvement in the situa tion in the Sarhad the posts on the Mirjawa- Kawash road have been removed. 150 troops of the Meshed Brigade returned to Duzdap from Mirjawa on the 7th June. They will move to Meshed on relief by troops of the Fauj-i-Zabali. Reference paragraph 40 of Diary for May. Naib Ali Khan Lashkari has been arrested at Kwash. Yawar Ibrahim Khan, until recently commanding the troops at Chahbar, has been called to Kwash. It is said he will stand his trial at Meshed, being accused of certain irregulartities at Chahbar. It would appear that since Sarhang Muhammad Khan has been given the Inde pendent command of his Brigade, he is determined to improve discipiline among the officers. 125 men of the Zabali Fauj arrived at Duzdap from Khwash on the 14th June. A further 250 are shortly expected. 300 men of the Sistan Brigade recently sent to Galooga to overawe Juma Khan, have returned to Kwash, presumably as a result of Sardar Juma Khan having surren dered most of the arms required of him. On June 17th, 200 men of the Sistan Brigade arrived at Duzdap from the Sarhad. The conscription committee has complet ed work in the districts of Bunjar and Bala Khaneh (Sistan). Recruits are said to number 40 and are of a better class than those hitherto taken from Sistan. It is reported that Sarhang Murad Khan, ormerly in charge of conscription has been uspended and is to be tried at Meshed. York of the Committee was much hamperea iwino- to the census work previously carried &gt;ut having been inefficient. In the Kachan md Mic.nkhangi districts no progress could D6 made, as the young men fled into Afghan territory on the approach of the members the committee. It is reported that the Officer Commanding the Amnieh in Persia has proposed the abolition of Amnieh posts on the Sistan- Duzdap road. The local people have pro tested to Tehran. This road is always hablto raids and the Amnieh have, on the whole done good work in preventing robberies and in many cases capturing thieves. If the ^ road be left entirely unguarded it will undoubtedly become very unsafe for traffic. It passes through the most desolate tract of country imaginable. But for assistance obtainable from the Amnieh posts, motor traffic would often be in danger, as owing to the deplorable state of the road accidents are very frequent. 63. Persian Officials. —The Beis-i-Adlieh, Duzdap, on tour in Sistan for some months past, has had the period of his sojourn in Sistan extended, as he could not cope with the work in the time. Meanwhile Duzdap remains without a court. Sarhang Azizullah Khan Zargham, re cently appointed Commander-in-Chief of Amnieh, is a pronounced Anglophobe. He was in Sistan some years ago and caused His Majesty’s Consul a good deal of trouble. Yawar Shuja-i-Nizam, Veterinary Officer, has been purchasing 80 remounts in Sistan, .which he has taken to Birjand en route for Meshed. Agha Mirza Khan, Attache, Persian Lega tion at Kabul arrived at Duzdap from India on June 3rd and returned to India en route for Kabul via Peshawar on the 4th. The reason for this short visit is not known. Mohammad Kazim Mirza Reis-i-Nazmieh, Duzdap, has been transferred to Birjand. Sultan Muhammad Agha Peis Nazmieh Birjand, has been transferred to Duzdap in the same capacity. 64. Soviet Activities. —It is reported that there is much friction between members of the Soviet Consulate staff at Sistan. The Consul, Attache and Zenshinoff went to Duzdap on May 19th. The two former proceeded to Birjand as reported m Diary for May. They returned to Sistan on May 30th. Zenshinoff returned alone from Duzdap. Nanioff (locally called Bobnoc) Vice-Con sul, left for uzdap en routeior Tehran on June 2nd. There is a rumour that the Attache Jaribegoff (Jarbekian Amenian) is preparing to leave Sistan for good and that Zenshmoi intends to see him away from Duzdap. This man has been in Sistan since the Soviet Consulate was reopened. He has been employed in their relations with certain individuals at Duzdap. It is possible that the friction referred to above has occurred with him and they are anxious to see him # safely away from Duzdap where he might give away information. A. M. Rival has arrived at the Consulate and it is rumoured that he will succeed Jaribegoff. The Soviet doctor Morosoff (he was doctor at Sistan under the Czarist regime) ball ed for the assistance of our Medical Officer in the treatment of his wife, suffering from an ear disease. The treatment was successful and he expressed gratitude for the help. A previous report that Baluchis are being induced to go to Russia, receives some con firmation from a complaint to the effect which has recently been addressed to the Governorate by Sardar Khudadad Khan, who has apparently lost several of his culti vators. The Duzdap Nazmieh have received ins tructions to watch closely the movements of Russians there—it is said that they are suspected of spreading anti-Persian pro paganda among the Baluchis. A few months ago two Persians opened shops at Kwash. There were grounds for suspecting that they were Soviet Agents. The General Officer Commanding ordered them to leave Kwash. One is now in Duzdap and the other has gone to Sistan, where he has a small shop close to the Soviet Consulate. _ On June 17th an individual named Predt Echensinj arrived at Duzdap in a car driven by a Russian named Vagarsehak Sarmisjan. He returned to Meshed on the 20th. He first informed junior police officials that he was employed by the Persians at Meshed and had been sent to make enquiries regarding locusts in the Duzdap District and that he would proceed to Bampur for the same pur pose. On being further interrogated by the Reis-i-Nazmieh, he stated that he was an employee of Russtransit at Meshed and had been sent by them to enquire about the locusts. He engaged a Baluchi guide to take him to Bampur. He enquired from the latter how far the British border was from Bampur, what tribes resided there and names of the Sardars. 65. Afghan Affairs.—The Afghan Consul has instructed all Afghan refugees m Sistan to return to their homes on pain of forfei ture of property in Afghanistan. Ail except Mauladad and Khaliqdad, two minor Sardars who came some time back to Sistan and were given land by the Persians, have agreed to return. 66. Lawlessness. —Four well-known robbers who had been apprehended and confin ed in the Military Barracks at Sistan, contrived to escape. The connivance of some of the troops is suspected.Afghans raided a caravan near Bandan and killed the owners of the camels. 67. Communications. —The telegraph line toJBampur has been completed and is open for traffic. It is said that a sum of 15,000 Tomans has beftn sanctioned for the construction of a road from Chahbar to Iransheher. The work to be carried out this year. A sum of Tomans 50,000 will be sanctioned next year for construction of a road from Iran sheher to Kwash via Karvandar (the line of the newly constructed telegraph) and for repair of the existing Kwash-Duzdap sec tion. If this programme be carried out it will ultimately affect the traffic by the Duzdap railway adversely. 68. Movements of Foreigners.—Rerm Acker and Clauso, Germans, visited Sistan from 20th to 23rd May in connection with organisation of an Agricultural Bank. They proceeded to Duzdap for Bandar Abbas. Herr Wurst of the National Bank pro ceeded to Bandar Abbas from Duzdap on transfer, together with H. Auer, Inspector of that Bank. 69. Movements of British Subjects —Rieut- enant Saker and Captain Hamidullah Khan of the l/10th Baluchis, on leave passed through Duzdap en route for Tehran. 70. Miscellaneous—A Sikh who enlarged on the situation in India in conversation with the General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad, was told that in the eyes of the Persians they were making a very foolish de monstration. This is said to have had a chastening effect on the Sikhs of Duzdap. Indian traders at Duzdap held a meeting and resolved to telegraph to Tehran pro testing against the Exchange Law. The Manager of the National Bank informed them that the Law was being reconsidered and would in all probability be abolished. The Governor at Duzdap received a tele gram from Tehran commending his action in discouraging demonstrations by Indians. The General Officer Commanding was ins tructed to co-operate and supply troops if J necessary to suppress disorder. The Gov ernor has thrown out hints to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Duzdap that he would be gratified to receive approval of his action by His Majesty’s Minister, conveyed through the Persian Government. It is however doubtful if the petty demonstrations at Duzdap warrant our investing the matter with so much importance. He was thanked by His Majesty’s Vice-Consul for his friendly assistance. The Birthday of His Majesty the King was celebrated at His Majesty’s Consulate and Vice-Consulates. The ceremonies were somewhat restricted owing to Muharram. Muharram passed oh quietly in the Sistan Consulate area. All marriages and deaths are to be report ed to the Nazmieh in future. The landowners in Sistan have been called upon to pay all arrears of Revenue for the past two years immediately. They are endeavouring to obtain permission to pay by instalments. Much corruption is said to exist in the Revenue Department at Sistan. The Persian authorities having received information of an outbreak of cholera at Jalalabad in Afghanistan propose to form a chain of military posts along the frontier and introduce quarantine. The co-opera tion of the authorities in India has been sought as regards passengers by the Duzdap Railway. C. K. DALY, Major, C. I. E. y His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, MC318|'P—23-7-30—IPSCONFIDENTIAL. \ ^ Diary of His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the ^ May, 1930, 9 0 i ax' e month on ,L J ? 3 / 47. Majesty's Consular Officers. —His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain paid a short visit to Meshed, leaving Birjand on the 19th and returning on the 25th May, 48. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, Early in the month reports were received to the effect that when Sardar Jiand Khan was arrested he had been severely handled by the troops and was in a precarious condition. Subsequently it was ascertain ed that he had recovered. It is said that he will not now be released, but will be sent to Tehran. Khan Sahib Idu Khan was detained in Kwash by the General Officer Command ing on the pretext that he required medical treatment. Actually the General Officer Commanding feared a general rising should Jiand die of injuries received which at one time appeared probable. Later Idu appears to have been able to satisfy the General Officer Commanding and was re leased. He called a meeting of the Lekis at Kwash to discuss the surrender of their arms and has apparently advised them to submit to orders. It is reported that the Yarmuhammadzais surrender el about 200 rifles during the month and in consequence the General Officer Commanding is likely to release the Sardars of these tribes shortly, with the exception of Jiand, Shah Sowar and Lashkar Khan whom it is proposed to send to Tehran. Juma Khan Ismailzai, it is believed, will also be so disposed of if he can be arrested in the near future. Idu Khan visited the latter at Kila Bed on May 20th, on behalf of the General Officer Commanding. Juma agreed to surrender 100 rifles, but steadfastly declined to go to Kwash. It is considered doubtful whether he could disarm his tribesmen and it is believed he intends to hand in only a store of muzzle loading guns which he has recovered over a number of years from thieves and which his tribesmen have captured in past raids. It is significant that his tribesmen are reaping corn and carrying it unthreshed to the hills. It is doubtful whether the 200 rifles handed in by the Yarmuhammadzais include many serviceable ones,^ aithougn the Persians for propaganda invariably MC254FD announce that they are all of modern manufacture. Reference paragraph 36 of Diary for April, Jamal-ud-Din, with forty rifles, joined Juma Khan recently. With reference to Baluchistan Agency Diary No. 7 of 15th April paragraph 15. The information given therein is not con firmed. No Baranzais have been sent to Tehran. Jehangir, son of Mir Amin is still in Bampur and was present at Kwash for the Coronation celebrations. Similarly there is no confirmation of the information contained in Baluchistan Agency Diary No. 6 paragraph 15. The General Officer Commanding has informed our Vice-Consulate that he has no desire whatever to see Ali Muhammad or Now- sherawan back in Persia. The report that Changez Khan had been appointed Sardar of Bampur is also incorrect. His history is as recorded in this Consulate Diary for April. Reference last portion of paragraph 36 of the Diary for April, Mir Koi has been released, but the arms and money found in his possession have been confiscated. 49. Sistan and the Qainat. —On the occasion of the arrest of Mr. Gandhi, the Sikh traders at Duzdap, Sistan and Birjand closed their shops. At Duzdap a meeting was held at which the usual resolution, including the boycotting of British cloth goods were passed. At Duzdap the seditionist activities of the local Sikhs are to a great extent encouraged by the very anti-British attitude of some subordinates of the Persian Customs. A proposal to take a procession through the town was abandoned owing to a hinHy from the Governor that such proceedings would not be allowed. At Sistan a somewhat similar meeting was held and the ‘National’ flag was hoisted. It is somewhat amusing to record that this meeting, in which a deci sion to boycott British textiles was taken, was presided over by one Gurbachan Singh, who has for some time P as f been importuning His Majesty s Consul to assist him to secure the Agency in Sistan for Manchester exporters. He ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No 0 ^ M. Dat |j( JUL1930 28 JUL193Q i ! M I fwould still doubtless accept such an appointment with alacrity, but is unable to res st the childish desire to appear as a Political hero before the small number of petty traders who form the Sikh com munity at Sistan, and who imagine that such behaviour ^ enhances their importance in the eyes of the Persians. At Birand, the ‘ Hartal was a very tame affair and damaged no one but the Sikhs themselves, who presumably lost some trade as a result. Seth Tyeb Ah, the moving spirit in the excitement at Duzdap, proceeded to Meshed where he arrived about the 2Gth May. Che Gover nor- General of Khorasan appeared to be quite prepared to frustrate any efforts of his to foment trouble among the Ind : ans there. There is a certain amount of uneasiness among the adherents of Shaukat ul Mulk owing to the protracted nature of h'S visit to Tehran. It is rumoured that the Shah received him graciously, but at the same t me it is said that he was offered an appointment in Tehran which he has declined It is thought not impossible that his removal from the Qainat is requir ed in order that his influence, still consi derable, may be the more easily under mined and that if he were to remain long absent the next development would be the removal of his relatives from the Gover- iiorships of Sistan and Qain. Samsam ud Dowleh, Governor of Sistan, is desirous of paying a visit to India of some months duration. If he be per^ mitted to travel, Sarhang Murtaza Khan will act as Governor during his absence. Influential persons have recentw, n conversation with His Majesty’s Consul, shewn themselves extremely critical of the Government. They spoke With a degree of frankness which would have' been quite impossible a year ago. One ■ went so far as to express the opinion that the present regime would not last much longer. The imposition of new taxation and the recent financial regu ations were severely criticised and the failure of the Eailway Construction scheme regarded as a bless ng in disguise, since the country could not afford the burden such construc tion entailed. These views were ex pressed by certain ndviduals who have hitherto been very staunch supporters of the present regime. The impression gathered is that all enthusiasm for the regeneration of the country has died down and that the economic conditions are such as to cause widespread dissatisfaction. These views are interesting since His Majesty's Consul was particularly careful not to agree with the opinions advanced and made several references to the recent improvement in the affairs of the country, which statements were somewhat hot declared to be not in accordance with the actual facts. His Majesty’s Consul was told that ‘ foreigners may, as a result of ♦propaganda, believe that cond tions have improved, but we Persians know better 50. Persian Military Affairs. —Yawar Iskandar Khan, brother-in-law of the General Officer Commanding in Persian Baluchistan, recently visited Sistan where he purchased a second hand electric lighting set from the Governor. It is intended to instal this at Kwash. This is an excellent example of the benefits which the Sarhadis enjoy under the Government. Tire Municipality of Kwash is supported by the funds raised from the Baluch Sardars, very few of whom ever visit that place, and who cannot derive any benefit from the Government offices and Military quarters being lighted electrically. On the other hand they are in dire need of some assistance in their agricultural pursuits, such as advances for seed or loans for irrigation works, since agriculture has been considerably interfered with as a result of the continued disturbances of the last two years. Naib Mansur Khan, accused of embezzle ment of Government funds has been brought to Duzdap under arrest and is to stand his trial at Meshed. Two months’ pay was recently disbursed to troops of the Meshed Brigade on duty in the Sarhad. Pay is still considerably in arrears. The Conscription Committee is still functioning in Sistan, Of the conscripts called up last year, most of whom were sent to the Sarhad for garrison duty, a very high percentage is said to have deserted. 51, Persian Officials &lt;—Lutf Ali Khan, Assistant Amnieh Officer, Sistan, has been relieved by Juma Khan and proceeded to Tehran. Agha-i-Bahlu, officer in charge of measures for locust destruction arrhec a Sistan. Sultan Husain Quli Khan Rahimi, Peis- i-Nazmieh, Sistan, has been relieved by Sultan Hadi Khan Nigahban, who was formerly in Sistan, The former has been posted to Duzdap probably to relieve tne Reis-i-Nazmieh there, who has proceeded to Birjand. He has not however receiv ed definite orders.Sarkar Hisam ud Dowleh, Governor of Birjand, who had been on a visit to inspect his estates in Sistan, returned to Birjand early in the month. ^ A commission now operating in Meshed and enquiring into the efficiency of the various departments, is expected shortly in Birjand. 52. Soviet Activities. —There is some evidence that the local representatives of i the U. S. S. R. have been deeply interested | in the affairs mentioned in paragraph 49 | above, concerning which a separate despatch is under preparation. &gt; One Syed Mehdi Khan Khawji, Editor of the “ Sada-i-Sharq ' recently visited Sistan. The higher Persian Officials were of the opinion that his visit had been instigated by the Soviet Consul, with a view to assistance m propaganda. The Soviet Consul visited Hisam ud Dowleh while the latter was at Sistan, and is reported to have made enquiries as to the possibility of extending Russian trade in the Qainat. The Governor is stated to have told him that there was no opening as Russian goods could not expect to compete with those imported via Duzdap. The Persian “ Locust ” expert is said to have requested the Soviet Consulate to make a contribution towards the expense of combating the locust in East Persia, on the grounds that they would be likely to spread to Russian territory. The Consul expressed his inability to accede to the request. Some time ago he is reported to have offered the services of a Russian expert who is now at the Sistan Consulate. That the Russians are keenly interested appears from the fact that the Soviet Consul at Sistan recently visited Birjand accompanied by a person variously described as ‘ Trade Assistant 5 and ‘ Locust Expert They remained for three days and visited one or two villages in the vicinity of Birjand where they enquired about the locusts and measures taken to combat the evil. The Soviet Consul, Sistan, has made no attempt to resume friendly relations with His Majesty’s Consulate. When asked by an Indian some time back whether he did not propose to call, the Vice-Consul (the Consul was at the time absent) replied that he saw no good in doing so and did not anticipate that it would be long before relations were again broken off. The Medical Officer, Sistan, and the Consulate Attache were recently introduced to the Russian Consul and his staff at a function at the Governorate at Sistan. Their attitude is reported to have been very frigid and far from friendly. Soviet petrol and oil continue to be imported into Birjand. During the fort night ending May 31st, 7,200 gallons of petrol and 50 boxes of /ubricating oil was imported. Russian petrol has been found locally to contain water in considerable quant ties. The Agent has returned the money paid, on receipt of complaints and has endeavoured to secure the silence of the complainants by issuing petrol free in lieu of that complained of. It may be anticipated that the free issues will en courage complaints and defeat his object. 53. Afghan Affairs .—Afghan subjects complain of much unnecessary interference with their trade and travel to and from East Persia There is no doubt that the bearing. The Afghan Consul at Sistan complains that Afghans entering Persia are now deprived of all silver and are not left sufficient cash to continue their journey to Sistan. The Afghan Consul at Sistan works ‘ hand in glove ’ with the Soviet Consulate. He recently interrogated an Indian member of our Consulate Staff regarding happenings in India and accus ed the latter of concealing the true facts. He appeared to be well informed regard ing Indian affairs, but obviously to have been ‘ primed ’ by the Russians. A number of Berberis who have long dwelt at Sistan are reported to have applied for permission to return to Afghanistan. 54. Lawlessness. —There appears * to have been a recrudescence of house breaking at Sistan. A thief was surprised in the Attache’s quarters inside the Consulate, but made good his escape. The police have undeitaken to be more vigilant in the neighbourhood of His Majesty’s Consulate. It is interesting to learn that Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Commissary, who viitually supervises all depaitments at Sistan, is of opinion that the Reis-i-Nazmieh has been personally- interested in recent thefts. At Birjand too, some carpets were stolen in April from His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate and have never been traced. A carpet vas stolen about the same time from a^ garage and the owner complained to Nazimen Headquarters at Meshed. Apparently the local Police Officer was alarmed at this and the carpet was speedly ‘ found ’ The owner has refused to accept it, untilhe be informed as to where it was discover ed. Meanwhile it is said that certa n persons witnessed the tra . nsf + er , of carpet, at night, from the private dwelling of the Polict Officer to his Police Station. It is freely said that the Keis-i-Nazmieh has a ‘ tame ’ thief in jail, who_ is released at night to continue bis activities, the proceeds being shared. The privileged position of the thief, who remains m the lock-up all day, has so far averted public cmcrhpinn from him. 55. Communications. —Nil. 56. Movements of Foreigners. Herr Gunttzer has relieved Herr Wurst as Manager of the National Bank at Huzdap. The latter is said to be proceeding to the Persian Gulf, probably to open a branch at Bandar Abbas. Miss E. Dunbar, American tour.st, arrived at Duzdap on 3rd May from Quetta and subsequently left for Meshed. M. Pitt, American Missionary, from India passed through Duzdap en route to America via Tehran. Madame Graux, wife of the Provincial Director of Pers'an Customs, left Duzdap for Belgium via Tehran. C. Kettaneh and J. Nader, Syrians arrived at Duzdap from Tehran on May 17th in connection with the business ot the Bombay Cycle and Motor Agency. 57. Movements of British subjects.— Mrs. McGrath (Rosita Forbes) arrived at Duzdap on 19th from Kerman and pro ceeded to Meshed on 2.3rd. 58. Miscellaneous.—Rumours to the effect that His Imperial Majesty the Shah wi\l visit East Persia in the autumn continC to circulate at Duzdap, Birjand and Sistan. As a result of a protest lodged a Persian soldier at Sistan who made an unprovoked attack on one of the Consulate sowars was flogged by the Officer Commanding and an apology was received. Floods in Sistan have subsided. The damage is estimated at not less than 3,000 Khawars of wheat and barley. On May the 8th the Sistan Branch of the National Bank was opened. A recep tion was held to which Persian Officials, Consuls and stafis were invited. The Manager, Herr Auer donned a Kulah-i- Pehlavi for the occasion. Speeches laud ing the Shah were made, A motor lorry driven by an Indian overturned recently near Kain and several passengers were injured, one of whom has since died. The driver has been released on bail but is to be tried shortly. The accident is believed to have been due to a broken steering gear, C. K. DALY, Major, C.I.E., His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kan.Note on Locusts in the Sistan Consular Area — May, 1930. Swarms of locusts began to arrive in the Duzdap area early in the month. The temperature at the time was between 65 and 70 degrees. Wind very changeable, but more frequently S. S. W. and N. E. Damage was done to lucerne crops and vegetables. The locusts flew north. Towards the end of May hoppers appeared in considerable numbers. Specimens of tae wdnged locusts, yellow and pink are being fonvarded. Nothing appears to have been done locally to deal with the pest. Mirza Mohamed Khan Fatheh who had previously been in Duzdap in connection with the locust menace, returned to Meshed being apparently unable to deal with the situation. Early in the month large swarms appear ed from Duzdap direction along the hills from Nehbandan up to Safedawa and by 16th and 17th May had reached Shusp, Sarbaisheh and Mudh. They did not remain long but flew north. About 20th dense swarms passed up the Birjand plains still travelling north. They were of the red variety. Little damage was done as they settled at night mainly in the hills and fed on natural vegetation. Locusts also spread in less dense swarms 'inthe areas Nehbandan-Sarchah-Mohamad- abad-Dostabad and towards Kain and Dosht-i-Baiz ; also towards Zarkoh east of Birjand to the Afghan border. Both yellow and red varieties. In the Jolgah-i-Mosina area up to Ahwaz on the Afghan border the swarms were very dence and eggs were laid over a large area. Eggs were also laid exten sively in the Neh and Sarbaisheh dis tricts. The local commission has done all that is practicable by destroying eggs, trench ing for hoppers and poisoning by means of Paris-green mixed with barley flour. Adults have been burnt with Kerosine at dawm. In the Nehbandan area and Sarbaisheh 3DO Birjand maunds of winged locusts are said to have been destroyed and large quantities of eggs. Owing to the existence of considerable amount of natural vegetation, following extensive rains, and to the fact that crops were well advanced, not much damage has resulted. At the end of the month hoppers were hatching in the hills around Birjand and were being destroyed by trenching. No damage is reported from Sistan which area has so far practically escaped. It is probable that extensive damage will occur to crops further north in Khorassan and Turbat-i-Haidari areas, towards which the dense swarms which passed over Birjand and Kain appeared to be making, and where crops are less advanced than in the South.

His Majesty's Consular Officers .— The camp office of His Majesty’s Consul moved to Birjand early in April. His Majesty's Vice-Consul at Duzdap paid a visit of two days duration to Sistan for the purpose of being examined in Per sian in accordance with instructions from the Board of Examiners, Simla. 36. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— Early in April the General Officer Com manding arrested Changez Khan, cousin of the late Dost Mohamed Khan. When Bampur was occupied in 1928 Changez Khan fled with Ali Mohamed and Nowsher- wan to Sarbaz. He later fell out with Ali Mohamed and surrendered to the Per sians and was permitted to reside at Iran- sheher. During the recent attack on Sarbaz he was given the rank of Sultan in the Per sian forces. Later he is alleged, while at Sarbaz, to have communicated secretly with his compatriots in British ter.itory and was therefore arrested together with 25 of his followers. Mir Zaman Khan Bamri, who was ap pointed Governor of Bampur last year, recently fled to Dehlagan. Jamal-ud-Din, a relative of the Ismail- zai Sardar Juma Khan, has recently moved to Jali Robat, within a few miles of British Robat. He is said to have applied to the frontier authorities for permission to reside in British Mekran. This individual was a Subedar in the British Levy Corps prior to our evacuation of the Sarhad. In 1928 he was arrested at Dizak, but subsequently released. During the recent disturbances he joined Ali Mohamed at Sarbaz. The General Officer Commanding visited Duzdap early in April. He is responsible for the information that his troops have collected upwards of 3,000 rifles of which 2,500 are serviceable, in the Sarbaz, Pishin and Irafshan area. In addition 200 rifles were recovered from Magas. He proposes to disarm the Sarhad tribes next year. The Amir-i-Lashkar is said to have asked Idu Khan to collect the arms of the Rekis, but the latter demurred on the grounds that their enemies the Yarmohamedzais ought first to be disarmed. The matter was not pressed. The General Officer Commanding stated that Sardar Abdul Hussain of Remishk would not surrender and that a military expedition against him would shortly be- necessary. On instructions from higher authorities, Changez Khan is said to be about to be released. Eleven of his followers have been liberated. Jalal Khan, son of Mishrab Khan, a cousin of the late Dost Mohamed was. arrested about the middle of April. A letter written by him to refugees in British territory, urging them to return and attack the scattered Persian posts is alleged to have fallen into the hands of the General Officer Commanding. Persian troops at Sarbaz have returned to Kwash and Meshed troops were to return shortly to Headquarters, but recent deve-r lopments will probably cause these orders to be countermanded. At the end of April the Persians arrested certain Sardars of the Yarmohamedzai and during the fighting that took place two Rekis were accidentally killed. Fearing reprisals the Persians have posted troops at Mirjawa and along the line of communi cations to Kwash. There is as yet no indi cation that the Rekis are disaffected, but Jalal Khan, son of the Ismailzai Sardar Juma Khan, who held an appointment as officer of Amnieh has deserted together with his detachment of twenty men from which it may be assumed that they have thrown in their lot with the Yarmohamedzai and unless energetic action is taken the Rekis may later assist them. The General Officer Commanding, Sarhang Mohamed Khan, is dissatisfied with treatment accorded him by the Military Department. He applied last year for an allowance to meet the cost of entertain ing Sardars and was granted Tomans 200 per mensem. This has now been reduced retrospectively to Tomans 70 and the differ^ ence is to be refunded. He has replied that he has spent the money, but if the Central Government insists his property in Tehran may be sold to raise the sum due. It is said that he is under orders of transfer, to take place after three months. He is a capable officer and well disposed to our selves, being always anxious to avoid fric tion on the frontier. He has on several occasions intercepted parties bent on raid ing within British territory. MC12 4FD2 Mir Koi, brother of Jalal-md-Din, above- ment oned, has been arrested in posses sion of 70 rifles and Tomans 800. I he arms had been purchased at Iransheher for one Tini, an Afghan gun-runner, and will be confiscated. 37. Histan and Sarhang Mur- teza Khan, Frontier Political Officer, re cently toured the villages around Sistan and forced the landlords to issue grain to cultivators at the fixed rate at which they had paid Revenue, i.e., Tomans 25 per Kharwar. Much of last season’s grain was exported and prices have risen abnormally causing acute distress among the poor. Extensive floods have occurred in Sistan pwing to the breaching of the Band-i- Lakshak and Band-i-Sistan. Attempts of the Reis-i-Malieh to divert water to the Kurab from Aliabad area led to his being attacked by villagers whose cultivation would have been sacrificed. As it is such action as he succeeded in taking is said to have involved the destruction of 25 pagaos of crops. It is believed that he accepted pecuniary inducement from an influential Sardar to divert the water from his crops to those of less influential cultivators. His Excellency Shaukat U1 Mulk, C.I.E., proceeded to Tehran from Birjand for the iCoronation anniversary. It is said that he received a hint that his prolonged absence from the capital had been noticed. On the occasion of his last visit he pre sented His Imperial Majesty with cash and presents to the value of £fl,000. His cir cumstances are such that he cannot pos-- sibly repeat this, and he appeared anxious in regard to the reception he might receive and whether he would be permitted to re turn to Qain without suffering vexatious delays at the Capital. He is reported to have taken a silver samovar, silver tea-set and carpets and saffron valued at Tomans 800 for presentation purposes. Up till the end of April locusts had not appeared in Sistan and crops are now sufficiently grown there to escape serious damage. Locusts appeared at Duzdap but left before much damage was done. At Fahreh, however, extensive destruction of crops took place. In Qain the pest has been steadily working north from Baluchis tan and eggs are being laid in the hills near Birjand. The usual ceremonial calls were paid by His Majesty’s Consular officers at Birjand, Duzdap and Sistan on the occasion of the anniversary of the Coronation of His Im perial Majesty The Shah. The public has been notified by the Gov ernorate that counterfeit Indian currencv notes have been introduced into Per/ in considerable numbers. As a result of the recent exchange rejm lations trade is at a standstill. DraksA in payment for goods already ordered and awaiting clearance from the Customs at Duzdap cannot be obtained from the Banks Meanwhile demurrage charges are accu mulating and many of the smaller traders will eventually be unable to take deliver? of their goods. The confidence of traders in India has been shaken and in many cases they are declining to comply with orders fearing that there will be undue delay in payment. Several Indian merchants have arrived at Duzdap from India to endeavour to collect money due to them. Traders cannot close down their businesses, because to dispose of their stocks immediately would entail loss, while on the other hand they cannot import fresh stocks of com modities which would sell readily. Unfor tunately the market in India for such goods as could be exported from Persia viz. car pets, dried fruits and wool is dull and exports cannot be made at a profit. It is reported that an Indian trader at Duzdap who wished to transfer his account from the Imperial Bank to the National Bank, thinking that he would be the more likely to receive assistance by so doing, was refused permission to open an account on the grounds that he should have trans ferred his account earlier! From a reliable source it is reported that the Manager of the National Bank at Sistan in conversation with the Soviet Vice-Consul remarked that he was of opinion that the new regulations should assist Russian trade. Rev. and Mrs. Brenchley, members of the Duzdap Mission have recently rented a small house in Sistan. The Soviet Consulate are reported to view this as a Political move on our part and to refuse to believe that it is a purely religious institution. This attitude is probably adopted with a view to exciting Persian opposition to the Mission. 38. Persian Military Affairs. —Conscrip tion is proceeding in the Sistan villages. Recruits are said to be of a very poor type. The General Officer Commanding East ern Division visited Sistan early in April and then proceeded for a short tour to Kwash. He left Duzdap for Tehran m Kerman on the 8th. With reference to paragraph 26 of the Diary for March, Naib Hussain Khan as3 ssistace k i. ion to op 5111 t lie Mk rfer! been placed under arrest. It is believed he will be charged with misappropriation of military funds. This individual was once in the Iraq Levies and has spent some ten years in India. He is extremely anti- ^ British. The Headquarters of the troops in Balu chistan and the Sarhad have been trans ferred from Kwash to Bakshan. Detach ments will remain at Mirjawa, Kwash and Duzdap. 39. Persian Civil Officials. — Nil. 40. Soviet Activities. —Boubonoff, Soviet Vice-Consul at Sistan is credited with the ( intention of applying for a visa to travel to Europe via India. He expressed the opi nion that such a journey would be 4 very valuable ’ to him. The Soviet Consul returned to Sistan from Tehran at the end of the month. His staff had no news of his impending arrival. He is reported to have brought with him an expert on locust destruction, Sultan Lashkari, until recently Officer Commanding Sistan, now in Baluchistan, is about to be arrested, according to a report current in Sistan, It is said that documents have been discovered proving that he was in the service of a Foreign Power, He is believed to have been intimate with the previous Soviet Consul. An influential Persian Official informed His Majesty’s Consul that the Soviet have been encouraging the Sistan Baluchis to emigrate into Russian territory. Every inducement is offered in the shape of free land, agricultural implements, etc. Re cently 400 of the Narui tribe, Sardar Khu- dadad Khan, were about to across into Russia via Afghanistan but were inter cepted and turned back. This official also credits the Soviet at being indirectly con cerned in the breaches of the Bunds which have caused much damage by flooding. He also considers that the Persian Vice- Consul at Chakansur and two of the lead ing officials at Sistan are lending support to the Russians in fostering discontent, as the officer who gave this information has general powers of supervision over all affairs on the Afghan frontier, and has considerable influence with the Shah, As he has reported fully to Tehran it will be interesting to see what transpires. 41. Afghan Affairs .—On April 15th the ex-Officio Vice-Consul Sistan was invited to a reception at the Afghan Consulate in celebration of the re-appointment of the Consul under Nadir Shah’s regime and the shoisting of the Afghan flag on the consulate. He expressed his regrets to a member of our staff for not having called on His Majesty s Consul either at Xmas or the New Year and excused himself on the ground that he was ignorant of the dates, in spite of the fact that all Persian Officials called, 42, Lawlessness .—There have been no serious disorders, apart from disturbances in the Sarhad. 4:3. Communications. —‘Sistan* road has been impassable for varying periods owing to floods. Roads constructed during the last two years in the Sarhad and Baluchis tan are said to have been rendered impas- able by the exceptionally heavy rains of last winter. Repairs were started to the Mirjawa-Kwash road, but coolies not being paid left the work. The General Officer Commanding has reported the construction of a more direct motor road to Iransheher from Kwash via Karvandar and hopes to receive funds shortly. 44. Movements of foreigners. —-W. W. McHarney, American, proceeded to India via Duzdap, having arrived from Kerman on the 16th. Some 13 Afghan officials of the old re gime passed through Duzdap for Kabul during the month, having arrived there from Meshed. J. Tull and Herr Auer, Germans of the National Bank arrived Sistan via Duzdap, Miss A. Curtis and Miss C. Curtis, Ame ricans, arrived at Duzdap on the 1st and proceeded to Kerman by air. V. Vain, American, arrived at Birjand by motor cycle from Meshed having failed in an attempt to get to India via Herat, He had little money and tried to raise funds from the Bank and His Majesty’s Consul, both of which attempts failed as he was unwilling that his compatriots in Meshed should be appealed to, he having already borrowed money there, and did not desire that a reference be made to Tehran where he said he was known. He succeeded later in borrowing money from two Australian tourists who passed through Birjand and left precipitatedly for Duzdap, abandoning a revolver and ammunition which had been conflscated by the Amnieh as he had not taken out a license. 45. Mjvemzn's of British Subjects .—Miss V. Stud! and Miss Hadow, Missionaries, proceeded via Duzdap and Meshed to the United Kingdom. Dr. Shoarburn, Missionary, arrived at Duzdap on 1st from India.4 Mrs. Johnson, wife of the Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, formerly of the Sistan Branch, proceeded to India on the 6th. 46. Miscellaneous.—It is reported from Duzdap that the vernacular paper Akali of Amritsar in its issue of April 1st pub lished an article to the effect that war had broken out between Great Britain and Russia on the frontier and that the British had been repulsed with great loss. Most of the British troops had refused to fight and it was anticipated that the Bolsheviks would shortly enter India. The source of the information was a leged to be Reuter’s Agent, Peshawar, and the article was signed A. P. F. meaning presumably ‘April Fool’ The article caused much excitement amon» Sikhs who apparently did not realise that it was a hoax. C. K.

Sarhad ctyid BoduchistcLyi. —Th.6 CxciiGrcil Officer Commanding, Eastern Army, while in Kwash, sent for Sardar Jiand Khan Yarmahomedzai, but he excused himself. On the 13th the General Officer Command ing, Sarhad, accidentally met the Sardar’s son at Mirjawa and ascertained that he was proceeding to Kundi. He believed that he was going to arrange for permission for his tribe to enter Br'tish territory. The General Officer Commanding then threaten ed the Sardar with arrest if he did not come to Kwash. The Sardar arrived at Kwash on the 25th together with Sardars Allah Rissan and Sah Sawar and Sardar Lashkar Khan of the Gumshadzai. They were accompanied by a considerable follow ing. The General Officer Commanding ordered the arrest of Jiand and fighting took place. Sardar Allah Rissan and two Rekis who were near the scene were killed. The Sardars were arrested and their follow ers escaped. They went to Sangoon and took prisoner Naib Mohamed Khan and an Amnieh. They were however brought in to Kwash later by Beroze Khan, Kurd. Fearing reprisals the General Officer Com manding posted 100 men of Meshed Bri gade at Mirjawa and a similar number along the Kwash road. The latest reports indi cate that the Rekis are neutral but the Yarmohamedzais and Gumshadzais are col lecting and intend to attack military posts. It is considered possible that the Yar mohamedzais may attempt to go to Mish- kel, in British territory, where a number of this tribe already live. Changez Khan and Mir Jalal Khan have been released. The former has been paid two months’ allowance. Several Baluch Sardars have been gwen medals for assistance in the operations against Sarbaz. Persian Military Affairs .—All troops of the Meshed Brigade have left Kwash. In addition to those abovementioned at Mirjawa, etc. 150 have been detained at Duzdap until the situation clears. Movements of Foreigners .—Herr Brose, wife and child arrived at Duzdap via India on 26th. He is t be manager of the Sistan Branch of the National Bank. The Americal motor-cyclist mentioned above whose name now a pears to be Farrest Dubbs, but who passes as Rex Vivian arrived at Duzdap on the 29th en route to Quetta. Movements of British Subjects. —Mr. and Mrs. Bryce, Australians, arrived at Duzdap on the 22nd and are proceeding to Meshed. They are members of the ‘ Armenian Relief Mission.’ G. R.

His Majesty’s Consular Otficers .— Nil. 24. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan .— The General Officer Commanding and Mili tary Governor in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan is reported to have ordered the Sardars of Bampur and Dizak districts to collect the arms of their followers. He isi stated to have promised the Sar- hadis that he would not disarm them in recognition of their loyalty during the recent operations. The tribesmen do not believe this and are said to be endeavour ing to sell their arms into Afghanistan. A report from Mirjawa that orders had been issued for the immediate disarming of the Sarhadis, which had resulted in the tiight of Sardar Jiand Khan, was unfound ed. The Sardar and his followers had left their villages to graze flocks in the hills as is customary at this season. Rifles have been collected to the number of 2,000 from Baluchis of Sarbaz, Pishin, Iranshar and Bampur, but Chahbar, Fanuch, Geh and Gwadur are not apparently to be dealt with until next winter, by which time the General Officer Commanding hopes to get a road constructed from Chahbar to Bam pur and thence on to Kwask. It is believed that the disarming of the Sarhadis will similarly be left till next year, the General Officer Commanding desiring to still further break up the com bination of the tribes. While' in Sarbaz he openly told the Sardars that Idu Khan was ill disposed towards them ; doubtless this was said with a view to undermine the latter’s prestige among the tribes. The Zabali-Fouj has been split up between Pashmand, Sarbaz and Bakshan. It is reported that Ali Muhammad and Nowsherawan hid valuables and furniture near Pashmand before their flight. This has been discovered by the military—Cash and valuables have been confiscated and furniture has been sent to Ali Muhammad through Naib Akbar Khan. Baluchis of Bakshan area are said to have moved up to the Sarhad and state they will not hand in arms unless the Sarhadis are likewise compelled to do so. It is reported that the General Officer Commanding was to meet the Political Agent, Mekran, near Mand at the end of March to settle a boundary question. His Majesty s Consul, Sistan, has no official intimation of this. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRFTAR' .

Bistan and Qainat. —Hisam-Ad- Howleh, Governor of Kain, arrived in Sistan on the 5th on a visit to supervise his estates m Sistan. It is understood that His Excellencv Shaukat-ul-Mulk intends to visit Tehran shortly. The Malia Department, Sistan, has taken over the collection of defaced coin at a reduction of 5 shahis per kran. An attempt was made to compel British Indian laders to accept defaced coins in pay ment of business claims, but without any reduction. Such coins would then be called m by the Malia at the reduced rate. Oii their threatening to bring the matter to the notice of His Majesty’s Consul they were not further pressed. The closing of the Imperial Bank of Persia, Sistan, coupled with the new finan cial regulations regarding exchange, has given rise to a good deal of talk, mostly of a nature disparaging to our prestige. A meeting of Persian officials was held on the 12th March at which the feasibilitv f enforcing the wearing of clothes made ol Persian cloth was discussed. Mnjtalnds of Sistan district have been called upon to produce two photographs each and take out a license entitling them to dispense with the Kulah Pahlevi. A disease called Tab-i-zard (yellow lever) was reported to be rampant in Kain ^ CaU - ln ? 20 deaths a day. It has hrlll t J an T s P lred tha t it was an out- * Inflaenz . a and tbe total deaths during the epidemic were 29. Mi Ji Har y Affairs.—Th* General Officer Commanding, Eastern Army arrived at Duzdap on the 25th and proceeded to Sistan on the 28th. He again left for Duzdap on the 30th March. &lt; f^ la11 part y of tr oops (27) under a Wakil ’ proceeded from Duzdap to Mir- _jawa en route to Khwash on 5th March. • i Litter No Dated [1 MAY. .1930 Received 19 MAY. 1930 M.2 - Naib Mansoor Khan, Wireless Offieer,^ compelled some tune bac o conduct to the notice of the General umct Commanding.

Soviet Activities.— The Soviet Con sul Sistan, has not yet returned, the Consulate is said to be without news as to his whereabouts. During the first half of March the follow ing quantities of Russian oil are said o have arrived in Birjand. Petrol 4,044 gallons It is reported that the Soviet agents intend to open a branch for the sale ol petrol at Khunisk, south of Shusp. There is some evidence that the corres pondence between this Consulate and the Governorate, Sistan, is reported to the Soviet Consulate. Some excitement was caused by an apparent attempt to murder the ‘ Chowki- dar ’ of the Soviet Consulate on the loth March. It transpired that there had been a theft of money from the Vice-Consul and servants had quarrelled amongst them selves about it. 29. Afghan Affairs.—The newspaper ‘ Siyasat ’ of Lahore, 27th March, 19o0, publishes an article on the fall of Amanul- lah. Sardar Amanullah Jan, the Air- King’s uncle is reported to have told a press representative at Baghdad that the British had supported Baeha-i-Saqoo with arms and funds because Amanullan bad visited Moscow against the wishes of His Majesty’s Government. Asked if he him self enjoyed any financial assistance from the British the Sardar is reported to have replied that he had applied for assistance both at Baghdad and in India but it had been refused to him. Mohamed Sadiq Khan Mohamadzai arrived at Duzdap on the 1st en route to Tehran, where he is appointed as Consul. 30. Lawlessness. —At the end of Febru ary the house of an Indian Railway em ployee at Mirjawa was broken into and cash stolen. A lorry owned and driven by an Indian driver was held up at Qila Rustum on the Duzdap-Sistan road and was forced to leave the road for some miles. The goods were looted and passengers robbed, but not otherwise molested. Amnieh followed andp succeeded in arresting two of the robbers, and the remainder crossed into Afghan territory, but have been recognised. The Persian Consul at Chakansur is said to be endeavouring to secure return of the stolen property. 31. Communications.—A road which once existed between Sistan and Jallalabad (Miankhangi District) has been put into a passable state of repair for motors as far as Bun jar. The Persian telegraph in East Persia is very inefficient. Telegrams from Birjand to Sistan often taking nearly a week. 32. Movements of foreign subjects.— L F. Carrier—Dutch—passed through Duzdap for Europe via Tehran on the 11th March. While at Duzdap he engaged m conversation with the Indians recommend ing the continuation of agitation of a communistic nature in India. C. H. M. H. Kleinov—-German—employee of the National Bank at Duzdap, visited Quetta for a few days in March. T. K. Miller—American—Agent for Firestone Tyres, visited Duzdap between the 11th and 16th March on business. 33. Movements of British Subjects,-Mr. J Burrage, Municipal Engineer and Mr. S Stubbs, Secretary, Communications Board, Punjab, passed through Duzdap on the 14th March proceeding on leave via Tehran. Mr. W. H. Newbold, His Majesty’s Con sular Service, Siam, and Mr. A. Gibb passed through Duzdap on the 21st March pro ceeding on leave to Europe. Mr. D. C. Fleming of the Burma Oil Company arrived at Duzdap on the ZAli and is said to be arranging for an Agency at Duzdap. 34. Local News.— Locusts have appeared in Persian Baluchistan and on the Muslim area in British Baluchistan. Eggs are also reported to have hatched out near iNeli. Heavv rain fell in Sistan at the March, a very unusual occurrence at tms season. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.

Critien arrived at Sistan on February 3rd and assumed charge of the duties of Medical Officer and ex-officio Vice-Consul. Captain L. Steveni. Military Attach^, Meshed, returned to Duzdap from India on the 8th and proceeded to Meshed. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. 13. Early in the month Baluchis report ed, with considerable detail, that the General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad had been ambushed and killed near Sarbaz. The report subsequently proved incorrect, but was the result of a small party of Persian troops under a Yawar being ambushed. The General Officer was not present with this Party. Reports received at Duzdap and Mirjawa indicate that the Persian losses in the recent operations leading up to the occupation of Sarbaz amounted to about 250 killed. The General Officer Commanding has been actively engaged in disarming the tribes in the Pishin-Balu Kalat area. He recently wrote that he had recovered 1,200 rifles and that all the sardars had visited him and promised obedience to the Government, with the exception of Abdul Hussain of Remishk. r J he latter had been implicated in the sale, as slaves, of some Persian soldiers (vide paragraph 96 of Diary for December 1929) and was consequently afraid to surrender. The General Officer stated that he had offered him pardon for this act. At the end of the month news was received thp y t the Sardar had fled in the direction of Bandar Abbas and that the General Officer Commanding was pursuing him with a force of about two hundred men. Sistan and Qainat. 14. In Sistan Sarhang Murtaza Khan, Frontier Commissary, has continued to be very energetic in Municipal affairs. Trees have been planted in all the prin cipal Khiyabans and a Public Garden has been laid out. Owing to the considerable rise in the price of food-stuffs great distress existed among the poor, and the number of beggars in the streets always consider able, has recently much increased. Sarhang Murtaza Khan, caused all Persons without means of subsistence to be gathered into a Poor House where they are fed and the able-bodied made to work free for the Municipality. Muni cipal bread shops have also been started and have proved a great boon to the people. Before, this there were no regu lar bakeries and the price charged for bread baked by private individuals was very high. The Nazmieh have again become active in enforcing the wearing of the Kulah Pehlavi. It has been announced that very severe steps will be taken against any offenders, after the com mencement of the Persian New year. It is understood that the status of the Customs Office at Sistan will be reduced from the beginning of the New Year and that the Customs Officer will be replaced by a subordinate official. The news of the closing of the Im perial Bank of Persia, Sistan Branch, has not caused as much interest as was at first expected. The enthusiasm at first displayed towards inducing the National Bank to open a branch, appears to have died down. A good deal of money is made in Sistan by officials, who do not care for the extent of their Bank balance to be known in official quarters, and they apparently distrust the National Bank in this respect. The majority of the officials have transferred their accounts to other branches of the Impe rial Bank ; the Governor has transferred part of his funds and the remainder he has lodged with Indian merchants in Sistan. It is reported that officials in charge of departments at Birjand have been ordered to submit fortnightly reports on the operations of their departments. Persian Military Affairs. 15. In Sistan landed proprietors have been to 1 d that they will be held respon sible for producing their tenants for conscription in future end will likewise be held responsible fo ' desertion of any tenant who has been conscripted.The Amir-i-Lashkar was expected at Duzdap at the end of the month and was said to be about to carry out a tour of inspection to Kwash and Sarbaz. On the night of the 5/6th February the shop of an Indian trader at Mirjawa was broken into and a sum of Ts. 71 stolen. The matter was reported to the Amnieh Officer at Mirjawa and he traced the footsteps of the thief to the Military barracks. On arrival there the Comman dant of the troops refused to allow him to continue his investigations. The matter has been brought to the notice of the General Officer Commanding. Petty thefts from Railway officials and of railway material have been going on for some time at Mirjawa. When His Majesty’s Consul was on tour there in January, the Station Master reported that some soldiers had entered the railway coal store and, in spite of his remonstances, had removed two bags of coal. His Majesty’s Consul caused the Amnieh Officer to make immediate enquiries, and as a result the Non- Commissioned Officer in charge (His Officer was absent at Duzdap) confessed that two of his men had removed the coal and it was immediately brought back. Soviet Activities. 16. The Soviet Consul at Sistan left Tehran on February 5th. It is believed that he has been transferred. It has previously been reported that he was not on good terms with the Vice- Consul. Of the three ladies of the Russian Consulate, one only is said to be the wife of an official. The other two are stated to be secret service agents whose duty it is to make independent reports on the activities of the officials. Gonioff, the Vice-Consul, who is now in charge is reported to be a very keen communist. He is reported to have said to the local Governor that in pre-war days the British consulate had always reported badly about him (the Governor) whereas the Russians had always sup ported him, and were prepared to continue to do so. The Governor is alleged to have replied that under the changed conditions in Persia and in view of the Political changes which had since taken place in Russia, he attached no importance to such matters. The Soviet Vice-Consul has been recently interviewing a person known to this consulate and questioned him closely about affairs in India. He read to him an article in a Russian paper violently attacking British Administration in India. My informant asked him how such an article was possible in view of the recent agreement with His Majesty'*' Government for the cessation of hosti^ propaganda. The Vice-Consul is stated to have laughed and remarked “ We do not attach any importance to that, in fact we consider it will be but a short time until diplomatic relations be again broken ”. No attempt has been made by the Soviet Vice-Consul to resume official relations with this Consulate, although it is known that the Vice-Consul realises that he should call and has heard of the calls exchanged at Meshed. The Governor of Sistan informed a member of this Consulate that the Russians intend to entirely rebuild their Consulate here and had received sanction to the expenditure of Ts. 4,000 for the purpose. He had seen the plans of the proposed new building. The Soviet Vice-Consul was recently seen taking photos, from a distance, of His Majesty’s Consulate. The Sistan market is new full of Russian piecegoods, but they no longer appear to be popular and the merchants are experiencing difficulty in disposing of their stocks. A great deal of trade in such goods is for export to Afghanistan and owing to disturbed conditions there and the rise in the cost of living, very few Afghans visit Sistan for trade purposes. Persian Officials. 17. The Reis-i-Adlieh, Duzdap, is reported to be about to visit Sistan, and to intend to open an office here. Afghan Affairs. 18. A band of Afghan marauders carried out an extensive raid into Kain. The Persian Consul at Herat is said to have protested energetically and as a result a good deal of looted property has been recovered. The Afghan Consul, Sistan, is still without orders or funds, but states that he has seen a circular from the Afghan Foreign Office in which his appointment as Consul was confirmed. The Governorhas refused to recognise him pending instructions from Tehran. Abdul Rauf Khan, son of Abdul Rahman Khan, Sarkatib, arrived at Duzdap on the 8th and proceeded to Meshed. Khair Muhammad Khan, son of Shah Nawaz Khan, late Mustaufi in Herat arrived at Duzdap on the 21st from Meshed and proceeded to Kabul via India. Lawlessness. 19. On the 12th, the Sistan Con sulate Dak sowar was attacked about 12 miles from Duzdap. The camel and mail bag were stolen, as also the camel of a Persian soldier, proceeding on leave, who was accompanying the mail sowar. Fortunately all important mails had, on this occasion, been sent by the hand of a consulate official by car, and a few letters and passports from Duzdap Vice-Consulate only, were in the bag. The matter was at once reported to the Amnieh, who appear to have taken unusually energetic action, for about a fortnight later the camels and the mails were recovered from the neighbourhood of Gunech, thirty miles from Kwash. The thief was not captored, but was discovered to be a member of the family of ore Karam, son of Gulzar, of the Baiuchzai, under Reki Sardar Idu Khan. The matter has been reported to the General Officer Commanding. Apart from the raids mentioned in paragraph 18 there have been no serious outbreaks of lawlessness. The policy of authorising the Sistan Sardars to take their own measures for defence, which was initiated by Sarhang Murteza Khan, appears to be successful and the frequent raids on a large scale from over the Afghan border, have apparently ceased, although petty pilfering continues. Communications. 20. Difficulties again arose over the question of the railway rations at Duzdap. The Provincial Director of Customs, without any warning, suddenly held up the ration train at Duzdap and demanded payment of customs both for the rations in the train and for two years arrears. This official has also previously held up a consignment of nuts and bolts for railway use and a supply of firewood for the pumping engine, but these difficulties had been overcome locally. He declined, however, to allow the ration train to proceed and the matter had to be referred to His Majesty’s Legation. Later in the month the same official proceeded to the Exchange Post Office and impounded the mails for His Majesty’s Consulates in East Persia and removed them in his private car to the Persian Post Office. This action was also taken without any previous notice and in spite of the fact that the existing arrangement, whereby bags from India are opened in the presence of the official deputed by him, and postal matters for the Consulates, which is not subject to Customs duty, is then handed to our representative was made with his con currence. The matter was also referred to His Majesty’s Legation and t’ie previous arrangements have now been confirmed. On the occasion cited the Registered mails for this Consulate were received through the Persian Post in a very delapidated condition. The covers were all torn and a parcel containing two maps was damaged, the maps being torn in half. Inner covers shewed no signs of having been tampered with and the contents were in-tact. The damage was probably due to rough handling en route. 21. Movements of Foreignees. Nil. Movements of British Subjects. 22. Mr. and Mrs. Ward of the Mission at Duzdap proceeded to India of the 12th.

His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Qain proceeded to Duzdap on January 6th to confer with the Division al Superintendent, North Western Rail way with regard to railway affairs at Duzdap. Heavy rain fell from 7th— 11th January and the Sistan road be came totally impassable. The return journey was made on 22nd under great difficulty. Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. 2. Following on the receipt of news of the capture of Dost Mohammed Khan, his relatives at Sarbaz made several minor attacks on Persian troops. Four soldiers were killed at a post between Sarbaz and Bampur. An attack was made on Iransheher but the attack ers withdrew without inflicting casu- alities and the troops did not pursue them. v On January 7th a second attack was j)^ j n Iransheher and the G. 0. C. who was present led out a force to oppose the tribesmen. On the latter discovering that Sarhang Mohammed Khan was himself with the advance party they appear to have made some effort to capture him. He is reported to have beaten a hasty retreat to Iran sheher, leaving the troops to withdraw in their own time. About the same time a party of Mekranis, who had thrown in their lot with the Baluchis of Sarbaz, attacked the Persian garrison of Bakshan and wounded eight of the force, three of whom succumbered to their wounds. On January the 19th the G. 0. C. advanced towards Sarbaz from Magas, with a force of 700 Zabali Fouj and 125 cavalry. In the neighbourhood of Turki-Bint they came into contact with a band of insurgents, said to have been 2,000 strong, but which was probably about half this number. They were unable to dislodge them from their position in the hills and retired to a point 32 miles from Magas, leaving be hind some 10 killed and removing 20 wounded. The Baluchis succeeded in capturing a number of camels. News received at Duzdap from a Persian Officer with the force shews that the morale of the troops was at this time very low and that they despaired of capturing Sarbaz and anticipated that their force would be annihilated unless reinforcements could reach them. No assistance was expected from the Iransheher-Bampur area, because the tribesmen were said to have occupied strong positions which would prevent troops arriving from that direction. The G. O. C. is reported from a reliable source to have wired urgently to Tehran for re inforcements. A few days later however, news was received that the G. O. C. had made a further attack on the Baluch position in the hills, and had succeeded in rout ing them and was advancing on Sarbaz. Nowsherwan and Ali Mohammed re latives of Dost Mohammed were report ed to have fled to Mand, in British Mekran. Early in January, one Syed Abdur Rahman, Afghan of Kandahar, who has resided for many years in Persian Balu chistan, was brought to Duzdap and detained there. He was considered by the G. O. C. to have considerable in fluence and to sympathise with the re bellious elements among the Baluchis. Sistan and Qainat. 3. Great distress exists in the Sistan area. Much grain was exported to Qain, Baluchistan and Afghanistan and the price has risen to an extent which has reduced the poor to a state of starva tion. The Governor of Qain has announced that a committee of enquiry has been appointed in Tehran to enquire into the grievances of the public. Complaints may be sent in seald covers to thjs committee and an official receipt will be granted. Persian Military Affairs. 4. On December 29th, 100 Zabali Fouj under Naib Syed Taqi proceeded from Duzdap to Mirjawa en route for Khwash. ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S No. 2/i M. 6 MAR. 193U Letter DatedOn January 2nd, 275 troops of Meshed Brigade under Yawar Syed Abdullah, arrived at Duzdap. During the month the Sistan conscripts were sent to Khwash. They were given no notice and were marched off early one morn ing, being given no opportunity to bid farewell to their families. On January 5th, the strength of the Persian force in the Sarhad and Balu chistan (excluding Duzdap and Mirjawa where there were 100 of the Meshed Brigade) was reported as under:— Khwash, Bakshan and Iransheher, Zabali Fouj . . • .1,137 Iransheher and Bampur, camelry . 700 Khwash, artillery . • • .137 Meshed Brigade, en route Kwash . 275 Cavalry en route Kwash . . .125 Machine guns at Khwash . . 8 Guns at Khwash .... 8 On January 12th eight lorries left Duzdap for Khwash with ammunition, equipment and 120 troops of Meshed Brigade. On 13th, a further 19 lorries left with rations and 200 of the Meshed Brigade. A number of complaints have been received from British Indian motor drivers. They report bad treatment, forced overloading of their lorries which broke down in consequence, and breach of conditions under which their lorries were commandeered. A separate des patch is being submitted in this conec- tion. The operations in Baluchistan are said to be carried out under the inde pendent command of Sarhang Moham med Khan. Soviet Activities. 5. Satoroff the Soivet Consul is said to be about to proceed to Meshed for a month. He is reported to be suffer ing from Malaria and hopes to obtain leave to Moscow for treatment. A report has been received to the effect that the Soviet Consul, Sistan, is in communication with Nadir Shah’s Governmett at Kabul, via Kandahar. Persian Officials. 6. The Beis-i-Adlieh, Birjand is, from all accounts, rapidly acquiring a for tune. A number of cases are under trial in his court in which British Indian subjects are concerned, and his conduct is by no means above suspicion. Occa sionally complaints are made to the Consulate that an unjust decision has been given and vague accusations, of bribery by the opposing party, are ma*^ On further investigation it invariab.^ transpires that both parties (generally both British Indian subjects) have been guilty of making ‘ presents ’ to the Court officials and the whole proceed ings have become so corrupt that no useful purpose could be achieved by any interference. As long as British Indian subjects play into the hands of corrupt officials and only bring their grievances to the Consulate when they are disappointed at the results achieved by their own contributions to the cor ruption, little can be done to assist them. Had British Indians on the abolition of the Capitulations, resolute ly refused to resort to bribery, and re ported to their Consulates any cases of injustice in the courts, it is conceivable that Judges would have dealt circum spectly, at any rate in cases in which British subjects are involved. There were indications a year ago, that Judges were desirous of producing a good impression on the British Consul, and had evidently had special instructions to deal carefully with the cases of Foreign subjects. Unfortunately the British Indians have been only too ready to fall into the habits of the country and to resort to corrupt methods. This being so, it is not surprising that corrupt officials see no point in dealing with them any more circumspectly than they would in the case of Persians. Afghan Affairs. 7. It is reported that the new Govern ment in Afghanistan is taking energetic measures to stop incursions into Persian territory and that a number of raiders near the Sistan border have been arrest ed and sent to Kandahar. The Afghan Consul is still without orders from Kabul, but states he has heard indirectly that he is reappointed as Consul. The Governor of Sistan has however refused to recognise him in the absence of instructions from the Persian Foreign Office. A small party of Afghans purchased arms in the Birjand neighbourhoad in January and took them to Herat. A number of ecr-officials of the Amanullah regime passed through Duz dap en route to Kabul during the monthLawlessness. 8. On 11th January the Amnieh post between Duzdap and Hurmuk was i attacked by unknown persons, believed ^ to be Baluchis. One Amnieh was killed. Communications. 9. Owing to heavy rains in early January the Sistan-Duzdap road was impassable for wheeled traffic throughout the month. It is still only possible to get cars through with great difficulty and by making lengthy detours. Movements of Foreigners. 10. On 1st January Rashid, son of Umran with family and Ramazan, son of Haji Muhammed, French subjects, pro ceeded from Duzdap to India for Tunis. • Rudolf Lippelt, German, and Rudolf Hofer, Austrian, tourists, left Duzdap for India on 5th January. Movements—British Subjects. 11. Mr. and Mrs. Rudkin, Imperial Bank of Persia arrived at Duzdap, but were transferred before Mr. Rudkin had assumed charge of the Bank, and left via India. Mr. Wright, Imperial Bank of Persia arrived at Duzdap and assumed charge of the Bank vice Mr. Burland transferred to Birjand branch. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.

The efforts of Sarhang Mohammed Khan to undermine the prestige of the Sirdars led him to appoint Habibullah Khan {vide paragraph 84) as Sardar of the Rskis a counterpoise to Idu Khan. This has caused considerable dissension among the tribe. Idu Khan recently sent a message to Duzdap that he had wished to meet Mr. Skrine, I.C.S., when the latter was recently on leave in the vicinity of Khwash, but had been for bidden by the General Officer Command ing. The reason for this, Idu alleged, was that a short time ago he had entrust ed Habibullah Khan with a written message to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Duzdan which contained information about the Sarhad. Habibullah had delivered the letter to Sarhang Moham med Khan who was consequently ill disposed to Idu. He ended his message by saying that if the British authorities would have no objection he would like to • take a holiday at Dalbandin in British territory. The whole story is pure fabrication- In the first place Idu Khan has not supplied any informat ion to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Duzdap for some years, although at the time of the last Sarhad operations he occasionally sent verbal messages. That he should suddenly send a letter and entrust it to his avowed enemy is quite inconceivable. Possibly some non-committal letter was entrusted to Habibullah in the hope that the latter would deliver it at Duzdap and enable Idu to denounce him to the Persians as a British Agent. Idu Khan may have hoped to get permission to proceed to Dalbandin by implying that he had got into trouble by endeavouring to be of service to us. I refer to this petty intrigue merely as an example of the manner in which the Persians, always suspicious, are led to believe that we have a hand in fomenting tribal unrest. Idu, for his own ends, has let it be known that he can always rely on British support for himself. This attitute is most unfortunate from our point of view as we have scrupulously avoided any action which could possibly arouse such suspicion. The real facts are that Idu Khan con stantly intrigues among the Sarhad tribes with the object of disturbing the mind of the Military Governor (General Officer Commanding) thus necessitating his being frequently consulted and asked to assist in quelling unrest of his own making. This behaviour has recently been fully understood by the General Officer Commanding and Idu is apprehen sive of the future. It is stated by a Persian Officer that the General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad wrote to Tehran early in October recommending the release and good treatment of Dost Mohammed, as he considered that he would find little support in Baluchistan, while his deten tion in Tehran provided a convenient excuse for his relatives to play on the feelings of disaffected Sirdars. The General Officer Commanding, Eastern Army is said to have disapproved of the proposal and consequently did not for ward the despatch to Tehran. The news of the escape of Dost Mo hammed reached the Sarhad and Balu chistan early in December. About the same time it was reported that four Persian soldiers who were proceeding on leave from Jask had been captured by Sardar Abdul Hussain, of Remishk (near Mekran) and Barakat Khan, of Bint, who had sold them near Bandar Abbas. It \ INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S 1 i • li 23 JAM. 10 FEB.f2 was said that the General Officer Com manding intended projeeding with a force of 460 regular from Khwash together with tribal levies under Zaman Khan Bamri and Mir Hoti to punish the Sardars in question. Zaman Khan Bamri has recently been appointed Governor of Bampur and Mir Hoti in a similar capacity in Iransheher. Later in December it was learnt from a reliable source that the proposed ex pedition to Remishk was a ruse to dis tract attention from Military concentra tions at Dizak, Iransheher and Bagman, whence it was the intention to make a surprise attack on Dost Mohammed’s supporters at Sarbaz. The General Officer Commanding gave out that he was himself proceeding on tour to place picquets at various points to intercept Dost Mohammed. Posts were in fact established at the following places In Persian Baluchistan* Shurab, Samsur, Ab-i-Reis, Deh Riza. Duzdap-Kerman area. Hurmuk, Kemdi, Sipi Nasratabad, Kemaroo, Shuragaz and Pehra. On 13th December the General Officer Commanding informed an employe of the Duzdap Vice-Consulate that he had in tended to attack Sarbaz, but that when he and the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Army were at Iransheher, they had been visited by most of the Baluchi Sardars who assured him that they had little sympathy with Dost Mohammed and would not support him. He had consequently abandoned the idea of attacking Sarbaz and had removed the various military post established. He further stated that the General Officer Commanding, Eastern Army, had distri buted the landed property of Dost Mo hammed at Bampur and Bakshan among various Sardars and he considered that this action would detach them from sup port of Dost Mohammed. In fact a rumour had recently spread to the effect that Nowsherawan and other supporters of Dost Mohammed at Sarbaz were mov ing to attack Bampur, and without con sulting the Persian authorities several Baluchi Sardars collected men and moved out to oppose the Sarbazis, lest an attack on Bampur should involve them in hostilities with the Persian. Ihey returned to their homes on discov ering that the information was incorrect and that no movement from Sarbaz W taken place. I he General Officer Commanding p: irf allowances for one month to the Sirdar ' They are still however four months in arrears. He also made presents of sugar and cloth to various minor Sirdars. The General Officer Commanding i s credited with the intention cf shortly re turning to the Sarhad to disarm the tribes. Sarhang Mohammed Khan, General Officer Commanding in the Sarhad paid a surprise visit to Jiand Khan Moham- madzai on November 30th. The Sardar is reported to have been alarmed at the visit and various rumours found credence among the tribes. The General Officer Commanding had informed His Majesty’s Consul when the latter was on tour at Khwash in October, that he had so far been unable to win the confidence of Jiand, but desired to do so, as he consi dered him to be straight-forward and a valuable counterpoise to the intrigues of Idu Khan. It is probable that the visit was in furtherance of this policy of de taching him from Idu’s influence. Sardar Din Mohammed, of Chahbar (See paragraph 58) is reported to have announced on his return to Chahbar that the fact that he had been promised a subsidy by the Persians would not deter him from assisting Nowsherawan should the latter decide to revolt. Din Mohammed is an irresponsible talker and heavily addicted to Opium and is unlikely to engage in open hostility with the Government. While at Bampur the G. 0. C. arrested one Mahomed Hashim, agent of Dost Mohammed and in charge of his land there. He is accused of propaganda in favour of Dost Mohammed among the tribes. It is learnt in Sistan that a consider able area of land at Bampur which was previously regarded as Khalseh is to be cultivated under the direct supervision of Government officials and seed grain for the purpose is being despatched from Sistan. Sistan and Qainat. 97^ There have been one or two minor affrays between Afghans and Persians in the Miankhangi district of Sistan as a result of disputes in connection with he distribution of the Helmand water. A few casualties on both sides resulted.Sardar Khudaddad Khan and Sardar All Khan two of the principal Sardars of Sistan have been requested to send I their sons to Tehran for education. They appear to connect this in some way with the recent escape of Dost Mohammed and to believe that the Persians require hostages for the good behaviour of the Baluch tribes of Sistan. They have sent evasive replies to Tehran. A good deal of discontent has been caused during the past ten days by the commandeering of camels by the Mili tary for transport of grain to Duzdap, both for rations for troops in the Sarhad and the seed grain referred to in the preceding paragraph. As is usual in such cases the soldiers sent out to obtain camels have taken bribes freely. Some camels transporting goods to Dtizdap for an Indian trader were seized en route and the drivers were forced to deposit the loads leaving them unguarded by the road, and to bring the camels back to Sistan. His Majesty’s Consul pro tested and the military authorities have caused the loads to be brought in and have undertaken to refund the hire which had been advanced to the camel drivers. At the end of November an enquiry took place at Birjand concerning com plaints that the A nnieh had been taking supplies without making payment. The result of the enquiry has not yet been made known. Sarhang Murad Ali Khan Taimuri, and Wassooq, the officials of the Regis tration Department at Birjand, are said to have collected some Tomans 2,000 in bribes and to have been reported to Tehran by Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Inspector. Wassooq has been suspended and ordered to Tehran. The methods of the Adlieh in Birjand are becoming very tortuous. There have been several cases lately in which British Indian subjects have been concerned and in which the proceedings leave much to be desired. However since the British Indians do not appeal to the Vice-Consulate for assistance, but freely resort to bribery of the Persian officials, nothing can be done to assist them. Persian Military Affairs. 98. Sartip Murteza Khan, Head of the Persian Amnieh arrived in Sistan on November 22nd and returned to Birjand en route for Meshed, the following day. He removed the Reis-i-Amnieh, Sistan from his command on the ground of general inefficiency. As he arrived with his successor in his car, the general opinion is that the fate of the Reis was predestined. He was not in fact any more inefficient than his predecessor. The Headquarters of the Amnieh of this area are to be transferred from Sistan to Birjand and a subordinate officer will command in Sistan. A party of twenty men under a Cap tain (Sultan) arrived at Birjand on November 22nd from Meshed. It was said that they would escort the Birjand conscripts to Meshed for training, and a party of 285 conscripts left in lorries about the middle of December. A number of conscripts who obtained exemption from the Municipal doctor at Birjand have been ordered to be re examined at Meshed. The Municipal doctor at Sistan openly talks of the sum he amassed for giving false certificates while recruitment was in progress in Sistan and has stated that he hopes to make considerably more from the con scripts who are being brought in from surrounding villages. Attempts were made to induce the Consulate Medical Officer to grant certificates. In view of the improper use to which certificates may be put, by transfer or sale to another person, etc., no certificates of any kind will be issued by the Consulate Medical personnel in future. The G. 0. C., Eastern Army arrived at Duzdap from Meshed on December 3rd and returned on 14th. He visited Khwash and Iransheher and conferred with the G. 0. C,, Baluchistan on measures to be adopted in connection with possible disturbances resulting from the escape of Dost Mohammed. One hundred and twenty-five Zabali troops who had been previously sent to Kerman returned to Duzdap on Decem ber 1st. On 18th December 70 men from the Duzdap garrison were sent to Khwash. On December 27th, one Grohan of troops of the Fouj-i-Shapur arrived at Sistan from Meshed. Half are to be employed in the cantonment and half are to proceed to posts in Miankhangi district where there has recently been trouble with the Afghans over water distribution.Soviet Activities. 99. Fuchs, Soviet Vice-Consul in Sistan since It!27 left for Moscow on November 24th. He was said to be suffering from turberculosis. Gonioff, his relief arrived on December 5th. Satoroff, the Soviet Consul does not speak Persian and now that Fuchs has left the work of the Consulate is mainly in the hands of the Armenian interpreter Jarbekian. A party consisting of one Russian, a Yezdi and an Armenian arrived in Sistan on 19th December and put up at the Soviet Consulate. They were said to be a commission touring the country on behalf of the Persian Government col lecting information about locusts. They left the following day. The high rate of exchange continues to hamper British Indian trade seriously and the Soviet appear to be meeting with some success in encouraging the import of goods from Meshed. It is reported from Birjand that British Indian traders there are now mostly replenishing stocks of cloth from Meshed. During the first 10 days of December 7,148 gallons of Russian petrol and 2,164 gallons of kerosine were brought to Birjand from Meshed. A garage called the 4 Palavi ’ has been opened for sale of Russian petrol at Birjand. Sales are reported weekly by telegram. It has been learnt that the Soviet Consul has come to some arrangement with the Indian firm of Mohr Singh Ram Singh, of Duzdap whereby the latter are to import Russian piece-goods for sale in Persian Baluchistan. The slackness in the local carpet industry has been attributed to the high taxes levied by the British on carpets exported through India. Steps have been taken to counteract this erroneous impression which probably spreads from the Soviet Consulate. The Soviet Consulate hospital appears to be meeting with more success and attendance are reported as increasing. A large consignment of medicines is said to have arrived at Duzdap and the Russians have announced that hence forth they will issue medicines free. Persian Officials. 100. The Reis-i-Maarif, Sistan, has left for Baluchistan and the Sarhad to organise schools there. Mirza Abbas Khan Sahari-Reis-i-Adlieh, Duzdap arrived there about 15th December. It was understood he would first proceed to Sistan to deal with pending cases. He has announced that it will be some considerable time before he can start work. Furniture from the Sistan Court has been sent to Duzdap and so far the Reis does not appear to have done more than read old files. The continued absence of any judicial court at Sistan is causing considerable inconvenience and loss to British Indian traders who cannot recover debts. Per sian competitors are not so badly off as they are generally able to enlist the help of the Governor or some other official of influence. This does not of course apply to foreigners who are told that the Governor cannot deal with their cases as he has no legal status. It is probable that a court would have been opened here before but that a certain section of the traders headed by the Governor have repeatedly telegraphed to Tehran that a court is unnecessary here. On the other hand British Indian traders and many of the less influential Persian traders are anxious for the court to be reopened. Sultan Muhammad Qasim Mirza, Jehanzuzi was recently transferred from Birjand to the post of Reis-i-Nazmieh, Duzdap. Sarhang Murteza Khan, Mukri arrived at Sistan from Birjand on December 12th and at once succeeded in galvanising the Governor and other officials into a show of energy. Yawar Hussain Quli Khan Reis-i- Nazmieh Duzdap has been transferred to Sistan in the same capacity. Afghan Affairs. 101. Early in November news was received that Syed Jan, of Kandahar, who now styles himself Syed Ahmed Khan, Naib Salar had been appointed Governor of Herat with Mohammad Anwar Khan previously Governor of Fahreh as his assistant and that both were en route for Herat. New Governors had also been appointed for Fahreh and Chak- ansur. Afghan Officials of the Amanullah regime have been arriving at Duzdap in considerable numbers from Meshed en route for Kabul via India. The Afghan Consul, Sistan has not been performing consular functions but it is learnt that he has just received a* '—mm — lumecesiif tish Mi idmi us for lk im )h fed fei Ami .iknarriffl n Deceilf! idals into s ian U jnsfd^ ae^ ^ luedHift dGoftf a# rel 3i ^ tein^ kl ai' 0 tti t 1 * 1 ' ffl hi' 1 ' &gt;d! telegram to the effect that he should clear up all pending matters in view of JJse appointment of a new Consul who fas not yet been nominated. Lawlessness. 102. The outbreaks of robbery with violence and murders which were fre quent in the autumn appear to have ceased, and the Sistan-Afghan border, apart from recent affrays regarding the distribution of the flelmand water, is now considerably more peaceful. This can probably be ascribed to a certain amount of weariness of unsettled con ditions over the border and to the fact that the Persians have increased the military posts and have followed up certain robbers with a good deal of energy. A number of sheep and horses, the property of Shaukat-ul-Mulk which were stolen [from Kain in the autumn have been traced and are said to be held by the Afghan authorities prepara tory to their return to the owner. Communications. 103. The Nushki-Duzdap Pailway was out of action for several days in December due to breaches following heavy rain. The Sistan-Duzdap road was also impassable for some weeks, partly due to heavy rain and partly to abnormal floods in the Naurab. The road was further flooded as the result of the foolish action of the local Governor who had constructed a bund near Naurab from which he hoped to drive some personal benefit by improving an area of his land. It had long been pointed out to him that the result would inevit ably be the interruption of communica tion with Duzdap. The road would in all probability be still flooded but for the efforts of Sarhang Murteza Khan who on his arrival ordered the immediate destruction of the buad and insisted on the Governor providing labour to repair the road. It is said that the Governor has lost some Tomans 2,000 over the matter, besides having caused consider able damage to the crops of his brother Hisam-ud-Dowleh, Governor of Birjand whose lands were flooded. At one time there was serious risk of Sistan town being flooded and the water reached a village on the outskirts of the town. 5 A report dated December 10th from Birjand was to the effect that the Duzdap-Meshed road was temporarily impassable in the neighbourhood of Sedeh. Reference paragraph 78(ii), diary for period ending September 30th. The road from Dawar Panah (previously known as Dizak) to Jalk has been com pleted and is reported fit for motor traffic. Chevrolet lorries are plying on this road. An extension is also being constructed to within two miles of the British road at Satogen. Movements of Foreigners. 104. M. Hildebrand, Oriental Carpet Company visited Birjand from Meshed on December 2nd. Madame Franke visited Birjand at the end of November from Meshed to attend medically on a member of the family of Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Gonioff, the new Soviet Vice-Consul, Sistan arrived on December 5th. Mrs. T L. Kogan, originally Russian, domiciled at Karachi proceeded to that place via Duzdap on November 27th. Mrs. M. E. Kibbe, American, proceeded to India via Duzdap on November 27th. Mr. G. H. Trull, American, proceeded to India via Duzdap on November 27th. Both were missionaries at Kerman. H. S. King, American, agent of General Motors, visited Duzdap from 26th November till December 1st. He was accompanied by Mr. Cartwright of the same firm who returned to India and Mr. R. H. Walker. The latter proceeded to Meshed and returned on December 18th. Heinz Karel-Jugo-Slav arrived at Duz dap from Tehran and proceeded via India to Java on 18th December. Mohd. Muhsin Beg, Turk of Constanti nople arrived at Duzdap from Tehran and proceeded to Shanghai via India on December 18th. Movements of British Subjects. 105.

The society of the ‘ Red Lion and Sun ’ gave a dramatic performance at Duzdap on 13th December and col lected Tomans 300. The Imperial Bank of Persia, Duzdap received 7 lorry loads of new coins from Tehran on 20th December. Both Duzdap and Sistan the bank has been^ ' collecting mutilated coin on behalf of the Persian Government. Staff has arrived at Duzdap for several new Customs posts which it is said will be opened in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. One such post has already been established at Nawar Chah near Hurmuk, the object of which is said to be to intercept goods believed to be smuggled into Persia via Kundi. C. K.

Reference paragraph 70. Owing to the serious illness of a member of his family Captain De La Fargue proceeded to Quetta at the end of September and it was decided that he should not return to Duzdap. Mr. Moore, Assistant to His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan has temporarily assumed charge of the Vice-Consulate at Duzdap pending the arrival of a perma nent Vice-Consul. His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kam visited Duzdap on October 17th and proceeded, at the invitation of the General Officer Commanding, Sistan Brigade, Commanding in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan, to Kosha, Khwash, Iranshahr and Bampur. A separate despatch regarding this tour is being prepared. The Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. 84. The Reki Sardars assembled at Khwash on October 26th and in consul tation with the General Officer Com manding elected Habibullah Khan as Sirdar of the Rekis in succession to Nasrullah Khan who died in August last. It was decided that Habibullah should retain the allowance of Ts. 50 which he has hitherto received, but that the allowance of Ts. 100 due to the tribal Sirdar should be paid to Mehrullah Khan, brother of the deceased Nasrullah. During October the General Officer Com manding voluntarily recovered some camels which he had discovered had been stolen from British Baluchistan and sent them to His Majesty’s |Vice-Consul at Duzdap to return. His Majesty’s Consul, while on tour in the Sarhad and Bampur was much impressed with the efficiency and zeal displayed by the General Officer Com manding Sarhang Mohamed Khan. The results of his efforts to improve condi tions were everywhere evident. He com plained bitterly of lack of support from higher authorities and ascribed their indifference to the fact that no officers of superior rank had ever visited Bampur and Iranshahr and that there was com plete ignorance in Tehran of the difficul ties under which he laboured. He was particularly handicapped by lack of motor transport. In particular he referred to the fact that he was anxious to placate the Baluchis and assist them to return to the cultivat ed area of Bampur. To this end he considered it highly necessary to provide them with seed grain of which there is a shortage owing to the Military operations of last year. He stated that in spite of the fact that there was much surplus Government grain at Sistan, he had not been able to convince the author ities at Tehran of the necessity of helping the Baluchis, both as a Political measure and in order that crops may be produced this year which would be sufficient for the garrison at Iranshahr and Bampur. Rations for these places are at present to be despatched from Duzdap. The General Officer Commanding pro fessed admiration of our methods of dealing with the tribes in Baluchistan (British) and appears to model his policy as far as possible thereon. His Majesty’s Consul formed the opinion that Sarhang Mohamed Khan was an exceptionally tactful and efficient administrator. A school has been started at Khwash and some 60 Baluchi children attend. Similar schools on a smaller scale have been started at Iranshahr and Bampur. Funds for this purpose were raised by the General Officer Commanding from his Military budget, as he considered that elementary education would have a beneficial political effect and the Baluchi Sardars were anxious for schools to be started. He hoped the Central Govern ment would in future provide funds and His Majesty’s Consul has learnt since, from the Reis-i-Maarif, Sistan, that money has now been provided and that the Reis is to consider these schools as under his supervision. Sistan and Qainat. 85. The selection of conscripts took place in Sistan during October. Out of ENCLiSURE IN Mia foreign secret/j: ettsr 12 , °* ;9d 12 DfcC. Reoei'yed *Ji _0 i m . 0 . LL.— .. ■ a very large number examined very few appear to have been finally selected. A few cases arise in which British subjects had voluntarily taken ‘ Sejil ’ certificates and declared themselves to be Persian subjects. They had generally done so in order to obtain employment in the Amnieh, Maliyeh, etc. When it was discovered that this had the incon venient result that they were liable for conscription they ran to the Consulate demanding assistance as British subjects. As they had quite voluntarily declared themselves to be Persian subjects when it suited them His Majesty’s Consul declined to interfere officially, but sent the Attache to speak privately to the President of the Selection Committee. It was made clear that the persons con cerned having voluntarily accepted Persian nationality, no official represent ation would be made, but proof could be adduced if required that they had until recently, been British subjects and t might be assumed that they did not fully realise the results which a change of nationality might involve, and could hardly be expected to make satisfactory Persian conscripts. The President has provisionally excluded them from the lists of persons liable to conscription and it is believed that they will be allowed to resume their British nationality and the Sejil certificates will be cancelled. His Majesty’s Consul has recovered their passports and it is believed that in due course an official notification of the can cellation of their Sejil certificates will be received, in which case the passports will be returned. Since the abolition of the capitulations it appears that among some of the British Indians, more or less permanently domiciled in these parts, the opinion was formed that there was little use in retaining their British nationality. The introduction of con scription has forcibly brought home to them that British nationality has some advantages. Persian Military Affairs. 86 . While on tour at Bampur His Majesty’s Consul was shewn the fort there. It is an imposing building built on a small hill and is visible for a great distance over the Bampur plain. It is in poor repair but is being put in better order and barracks have been recently built in ^ the interior. As far as His Maj( sty’s Consul could judge the detach ment appeared to consist of some 50 men under an officer. There is Heliographic communication with the headquarters at Iranshahr, some 18 miles distant. The fort was previously occupied by Dost Mohamed. The walls are of immense thickness and it would be a formida^ obstacle except to heavy artillery. Iranshahr is the Headquarters of a Battalion some of whom are mounted on camels. A very fine building existed dating from the time of Nadir Shah. It has been put into a state of perfect repair, and besides Barracks for the men con tains a very good Hospital, stabling for some 80 horses, Officers’ quarters, im mense ambars, a large Hamam, cook house, etc. The whole is planned on a very fine scale, the buildings being sepa rated by wide avenues containing run ning water tanks, and fountains. Sani tation was excellent and the men well turned out in every respect. A Military band was much in evidence and a wire less concert was in progress in the even ing. When it is considered that all sup plies, doors, windows, etc., have been transported from Duzdap over what must be quite the worst ‘ road ’ in Persia, for the most part entirely waterless, the achievement is quite remarkable. The appearance of the men, equipment, etc., was greatly superior to that of the troops at Sistan or Birjand. !t is not yet clear whether conscripts from the Qainat will be trained at Birjand or will proceed to Meshed. Sarhang Mohamed Khan informed His Majesty’s Consul that conscripts from the Sistan area would be sent to Khwash for training. The General Officer Com manding entertained hopes that he would be given an independent command, and enlarged on the difficulties and delay which resulted from his command being under the orders of the General Officer Commanding Eastern Army. Sultan Ibrahim Khan Timuri has been appointed Officer Commanding at Chabar. He proceeded from Khwash via Duzdap and Karachi on October 18th. Soviet Activities. 87. The Rizvi Garrage at Birjand is said to be about to import Russian Motor tyres. 1460 Gallons of Russian petrol was brought to Birjand in October. The price of Russian Kerosene oil there hasbeen reduced from Kraus 22/50 to Krans 22 ]^er tin. The Soviet Consul, Sistan, visited Meshed. He returned on 29th October. % Afghan Affairs. 88 . The flag of the Afghan Consulate, Sistan, is not hoisted. Afghan raids into the Qainat have been numerous and the inhabitants are considerably perturbed and are demanding arms for their defence. Such arms as were available were pre viously issued to certain villages. The military authorities at Birjand are said to have recommended a considerable increase in the strength of frontier posts. Robberies and murders continue on the Sistan-Afghan border, but are of rather less frequency than was the case a few months ago. The news of (he fail of Habibullah appears to have been received with pleasure by the majority of the Afghans in Sistan and the Qainat. Lawlessness. 89. Apart from border raids mention • ed above, good order has been maintain ed throughout the Consulate area. Communications. 90. Reference paragraph 78. The tele graph line from Khwash to Iranshahr had reached Karvandar at the end of October when His Majesty’s Consul was on tour in that locality. Karvandar is some 40 miles from Iranshahr by direct route. The General Officer Commanding hopes to find a more direct motor route from Khwash to Iranshahr than the present road which is via Jauri and Shurab. It joins the Kerman-Iranshahr 4 road ’ about 24 miles North of Shurab. His Majesty’s Consul was informed by the General Officer Commanding Sarhang Mohammad Khan that the Kerman- Iranshahr road was really impassable for cars at present. No water exists between Shurab and Bampur, a distance of some 50 miles. Cars are liable to be held up by heavy sand. Movements of Foreigners. 91. Herr Hellmuth Wurst and an assistant called Clienow arrived at Duz- dap on October 5th to open the National Bank. He has promised to pay 4 per cent, on deposit accounts. Persian officials have been instructed to open official accounts with this Bank. Mr. Harvey, American representative of Goodyear Tyres arrived at Duzdap on 11 th October. Mrs. Jannidis, British by birth, Greek subject by marriage arrived at Duzdap from India on 15th October and pro ceeded to Meshed. Madam Vigornisky, Russian, who had been staying with Shaukat-ul-Mulk at Birjand, left for Tehran on October 25th. It is reported that one Siskhoff, said to be a Russian deserter arrived at Birjand from Meshed at the end of October and stated that he intended to try to proceed to India on foot. Movements of British Subjects. 92. L. Wood, of the Dunlop Tyre Coy: arrived at Duzdap on 18th and proceeded to Meshed. Lt.

IIis Majesty's Consular Officers .— The Camp Office of H. M.’s Consul left Birjand for Sistan on September 6 th. H. M.’s Consul proceeded to Duzdap from Birjand on September 6 th and thence to Sistan on September 24th. Captain D. G. H. de la Fargue assumed charge of the office of H. M.’s Vice Consul Duzdap on 1st September 1929. 71. Persian Baluchistan .—The Yar- mahommadzai, Gamshadzai and Reki Sirdar are reported to have visited Khwash on 26th August and to have demanded payment of their subsidies, then five months in arrears. They re ceived allowances for one month and promises for early payment of the balance due. It is alleged that the Sirdars then met at the house of Idu Khan and dis cussed a plan to invite the G. 0. C. to din ner and effect his arrest, whereupon it was their intention to hold him as a hostage until the release of Dost Moham med had been effected. Ali Mahomed and Nowsherwan declined to join the meeting fearing that Dost Mohammed might be executed as a reprisal. Nur Mohammed Kurd is believed to have reported the in trigue to the G. 0. C. and the latter called upon Idu Khan for an explanation. The latter denied any knowledge of the matter. In this connection the G. 0. C. in con versation with H. M.’s Consul at Duzdap on September 14th asked to what extent the British supported Idu Khan, as the latter let it be known that he always had British support behind him. H. M.’s Consul replied that Idu Khan had done good service for us in the past and it should be borne in mind that he had similarly served the Persian Government well during the disturbances in Baluchistan, and on account of his service we wished him well, but that it was quite untrue that he had any support in his present position as a servant of the Persian Government. The G. 0. C. said he was relieved to hear this, as Idu had constantly implied that he could count on British support and used it as a political lever. He (G. O. C. ) was fully aware of Idu’s services to the Persian Government but it seemed impossible tq satisfy his ambitions and he was not now assisting to keep peace in the Sarhad and Baluchistan but playing solely for increase of his own power. He agreed with me that in any case it would be impolitic to deal harshly with Idu after the good work LcCITFD he had done, and said he would, if an op portunity arose, endeavour to get him transferred from that area by giving him a higher appointment elsewhere, where lie could continue to be of service to the Government without being an embarrass ment. From other sources H. M.’s Consul had already formed the opinion that recent threats of rebellion were being fostered by Idu Khan in order to force the hand of the G. 0. C. and render his (Idu’si servP^s indispensable as peacemaker. The diffi culty is that Idu is dealing with dangerous material in thusv playing on the feelings of the Baluchis, and although I doubt if he has any intention of really causing an outbreak, sooner or later matters will get beyond his control, and he will be unable to put a stop to agitation started by him self for his personal ends. H. M.’s Consul took the opportunity to inform the G. O. C. that under no circum stances would the Government of India allow any Persian rebels to seek refuge in British territory. He expressed himself as very relieved to hear this, as Idu had led him to understand that the tribes would always be in a position to enter British Baluchistan. He now felt con vinced that British authorities were genuinely interested in the maintenance of peace in the Sarhad. 72. Sistan and Qainat .—The Revenue Commission under Mushiri (Majid-us- Sultan) finished work and left Sistan to ward's: the end of August. Mushiri is reported to have collected a considerable sum in bribes. Assadi the Deputy for Sistan paid a visit to Nasratabad (Sistan) at the end of August, It is reported that certain mem bers of the public complained tele graphically to Tehran of his attempts to extract money from them. The selection of conscripts is proceed ing in the Qainat. Bribery is freely re sorted to in attempts^ often successful, to avoid conscription, but there is no active resistance. The initial expenses of the conscription are being covered by forced subscription from householders.

Persian Military Affairs .—Sarhang Murad Khan Temouri has been appointed officer in charge of conscription at Birjand. Six pupils from the Madraseh bhau- kativeh Birjand, have been sent to the Military school Tehran. All the troops of the Kerman Brigade formerly attached to Sistan Brigade have returned to Kerman. The following troops were reported in the Sarhad and Baluchistan at the end of August Khwash .. • • 607 Bakshan and Shastun 314 Gusht .. • • 28 Iranshaher .• 475 Mir jawa Duzdap 1,624. 74. Persian Officials .—In spite of tic queut telegraphic-requests from inhabit ants no Adiieh (Law Court) has yet been /tablished at Sistan or Duzdap. the Reis-i-Adlieh Birjand visited Sistan m early September. Apart from having a violent quarrel with the Reis-i-Naznuea, he accomplished very little beyond open ing the box containing files of case's, pend ing when the last Adlieh was suspended several months ago. The Reis-i-Nazmich Sistan has left for Meshed. It is believed he has been sus pended. In the absence of any court he has been collecting a good deal in biibes. Vakil Rast Taqi Khan of the Amnieh post at Duiuksh, has been arrested for accepting bribes and is to be tried at Birjand. Agha Mohammed Khan Vassoughzadeh, Reis-i-Malieh Baluchistan, who has been for some time at Khwash, has returned to Duzdap and is employed on preparing a report on the Sarhad and Baluchistan. It seems likely that in due course ihc Persians will endeavour _ to collect revenue in those areas, in which case the tribes may unite in resisting collection, since they were promised that no revenue would be demanded. 75. Soviet Activities.—Zarhekmri, ac companied by Morozoff the Soviet Con sulate doctor visited Duzdap from 3rd-vth September, the former stated that they had arranged to sell pieceg’oods in Duz dap and in Persian Baluchistan. Russian voods are being sold at Duzdap in the shop of Ram Singh Mohar Singh and also m his shop at Khwash, in which Idu Khan is his partner. Zarbekian endeavoured to secure Mehdi Arbab and Khalilzadeh. merchants of Duz dap to act as agents for sale oi Russian C. P. goods and petrol, but they declined. Consequent on the opening of the garage Rizvi at Birjand the sale of Russian petrol there is said to be increasing. 5,10? gallons of Russian petrol were brought to Birjand during the first fortnight in September. A Soviet agent in Sistan has induced ten persons to take shops in the new bazaar, presumably to sell Russian goods. The Soviet Consulate Sistan has been spreading propaganda to the effect that the troubles in Afghanistan are due to the. British. They have also endeavoured to exaggerate the fracas which occurred between the Indians and Berberis. The salaries of the s t taff of the Soviet Consulate were, until recently, two months in arrears. The wife of the Russian Vice Consul (M. Fuks) is said to have a brother in India to whom she remits money. 76. Afghan Affairs.—Mahomed Yaqub Khan (see paragraph 63 diary for period ending 15th August) when asked by the Checking Officer at Mirjawa why so many Afghan refugees were going to live at Meshed where the cost of living is high, said they did so in accordance with orders given by mc-King Amanullah. The latter after a short stay in Italy would go to Moscow, where he would require their services, as he had by no means given up the idea of regaining the Afghan throne. It is reported that trade at Herat is almost at a standstill, owing to high cus toms charges being levied. Some traders from there who formerly dealt with Kandahar and Kabul, have recently brought goods to Duzdap for sale. It is reported that certain Afghans who wished to come to Persia from Kabul via India were given passports in which the name of Amanullah had been scored out and that of Habibullah substituted. The Persian Consul Quetta refused to vise these saying that Persia had not recog nised Habibullah’s regime. Mirza Mahommad Khan s|o Sher Mahommad of Kandahar arrived at Duzdap from India on 31st August and proceeded to Meshed. The following Afghan officials passed through Duzdap en route for Meshed on the dates shewn :— (1) Mohammed Isa Khan s|o Qurban 1 Khan. 7th September. (2) Sved Ali Hyder s ! o Mazhar • ‘Hussain. 7th September. (3) Sardar Abdul Hakim Khan sA Hakim Ali. with 26 followers. 7th September. (4) Hissamud Din sjo Shahabud Dim 10th September.( 5 ) Al^ar Molianmied s!o Sultan Mohammed. 10th September. ( 6 ) Gni Mohammed sjo Slier Moham med. 10th September. ( 7 ) Mirza Mohammed Akbar s|o Haji Mohammed Ali Khan, a student. 14th September. Certain ^-officials of the old regime are obtaining passports in which they are described as “ Agricultural Nomads These the Persian Consul at Chakansur has vise to allow of their entering Persia with a view to re-entering Afghanistan via India. 77. Lawlessness. —The situation on the frontier has somewhat improved, although a number of robberies are still taking place. Amnieh posts on the Sistan-Afghan border have been withdrawn and replaced bv military. Two new Amnieh posts have been established on the Duzdap-Sistan road. 78. CommunicatIons —The G. 0. G. Sis- tan Brigade now administering the Sarhad and Baluchistan informed H. M.’s Consul that the Persian Government were keen on developing roads in his area. He had recently completed a road tor motors from Khwash to Magas, but had not yet travelled over it himself. The telegraph line between Khwash and Iranshehr was reported to be nearing completion at the end of August. A road is being made from Dawar 1 ana to Jalk and it is said that it will be con tinued to the frontier of British Mekran. 79. Movements of Foreigners. Herr Wilhelm Rick, German, arrived Duzdap from India and left for Germany via Tehran on 17th August. He had been em ployed in Kabul. Miss F. C. S. Rasmecian, Dane, mis sionary of Kohat, who has been on a visit to Tehran, etc., returned to India via Duz dap on September 1st. Franz Hecker, German, with his wife-, arrived Duzdap from Kerman and pro ceeded to India on 9th September. Said to be making a world cycle tour. 80. Movements of British Subjects .— Nil. 81. Local News .—Owing to canals in Afghanistan being full of sand there is an unusual amount of water in the Sistan area. Owing to the number of complaints in regard to the recent commandeering of lorries at Duzdap, by the Military autho rities, the Civil Governor at Duzdap has notified that the Ministry of the Interior and the War Ministry have issued orders that commandeering is not to be resorted to in future. It is difficult to believe that in the event of another emergency lorries will not again be commandeered under plea of necessity. What is required is that definite conditions be laid down of which drivers can be informed. The rate paid should also be somewhat higher than the normal, in view of the inconvenience and dislocation of work involved. Under such conditions, and provided the drivers were otherwise reasonably well treated, there would be no objection to com mandeering—in fact lorries would be willingly supplied. Quarantine lias been instituted at Duz dap for passengers arriving by train from India. Medical inspection is very per functory and no accommodation exists for 1st class passengers. Consequently quarantine is not being rigidly enforced. 82. Miscellaneous.' — Nil. Sistan, The 1st October 1929. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Nairn Distribution as usual.

He re mained at Duzdap until August 6 th and returned to Camp Birjand on 9th via Sistan. Captain C. C. L. Ryan proceeded to Quetta on sick leave on 3rd August. Charge of the office of His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate, Duzdap, being temporarily held by Khan Sahib Mahmud Gul, Trade Assistant at Duzdap. 58. Persian Baluchistan .—News of the outbreak of lawlessness in the neighbour hood of Shiraz reached Duzdap and Sistan -about the first week in July. The out break was at first commonly ascribed to British intrigues and a rumour was current that a charge of complicity was being made against His Majesty’s Consul, Shiraz. These disturbances encouraged further rumours of the probability of an out break in Persian Baluchistan and that Ali Mohammed, father of Dost Mohammed and ■ Nowsherwan had secured the support of the undermentioned tribes and were await ing a favourable opportunity:— Zaman Khan Bamri of Dehlgan, strength about 500 lashkar. Saidi Khan and Nawab, Lashari, strength about 200 each. Sarbazis, strength about 1 , 000 . Mir Baluch Khan of Irafshan, strength about 500, They did not expect any assistance from the Sarhadis, or the Baluchis in Iranshahr, Magas or Da war Fana, It is known that Sardar Hussain Khan Sheranzai of Geh, Sardar Mohammed Khan of Fanuch and Jan Mohammed of Qasrqand recently paid their respects to the General Officer Com manding at Khwash and are believed to have promised that they would not join any disturbance against the Government. Towards the end of July the General Officer Commanding received order to concentrate his troops in Khwash preparatory to moving them to Kerman and the evacuation of several posts in Baluchistan, in obedience to these, instructions, further encouraged rumours of a probable outbreak of dis turbances. Apart from a small movement MC465FD of troops mentioned under “ Military af fairs ” no troops were openly moved out of Khwash, although small parties are said to have left by night, and as the Shiraz situation became better controlled the situation in Baluchistan in early August tended to improve. There can now be no doubt that the Baluchis are in no hurry again to try their strength against the Cen tral Government, or they would have seized the opportunity when the Shiraz situation, was at its worst, Sardar Din Mohammed of Dashtiari with 9 followers arrived at Duzdap via Karachi on July 13th to negotiate with the General Officer Commanding in regard to the Customs at Chahbar. He said he was formerly in receipt of one-quarter of the customs receipts there, but a few months ago the arrangement was stopped and he was given consolidated allowances of Tomans 200 per mensem in lieu, to which arrangement he was not prepared to agree. He had applied to the Shah who had ins tructed the General Officer Commanding to come to an amicable arrangement with him. On the 19th he met the General Officer Commanding and as a result of the conversations he was offexed, and accepted, Tomans 300 per monsem in lieu of all customs rights at Chahbar. The Sardar is heavily addicted to opium. Imports for Baluchistan from Karachi are landed principally at the following ports ( 1 ) Pasni in British Baluchistan. ( 2 ) Gwadar in British Baluchistan. (3) Chahbar. ( 4 ) Juwani on the Kalat side of Gwet- ter Bay. Goods landed at ( 1 ) pay 3% customs duty and are taken to Da war Fana (Dizak) by donkey caravan, in 8 days. Goods landed at ( 2 ) are charged 3% by the Sultan of Muscat and 3% British Indian customs at Suntsar. They find their way by camel transport to Irafshan, Sarbaz, Pishin, Bahu Kalat and Bampur, within 5-10 days. Rupees 12 per camel load is the freight charge to Bampur. Persian customs at a slightly lower rate than that collected in Duzdap, is charged at (3) andDuzdap Dizak ., Iranshahr Khwash imports are decreasing, being confined mainly to Sindi traders owning shops actually in Chahbar. To avoid customs duties, goods are brought from Muscat by “ booms ” and landed at Kunarak, whence they reach Bint in 2 days and Fanuch in three days. The cost of a packet of 10 Scissors ciga- rettes varies as under :— Annas. 6 2 3 Imports via Juwani (4) are reported to be much on the increase, since Chahbar has been controlled by the Persian customs. Transport is easily obtained there for Persian Baluchistan and goods are subject to the usual 3% duty only. With reference to paragraph 166 of Kerman diary No. 6 information in Duzdap does not confirm this. Indian traders there have, as in the past, advanced money to Baluchis for purchase of wool and are experiencing no difficulties. Sardar Ali Khan Naroi has stated that his brother visited Nowsherwan at Sarbaz on 12 th July, and the latter said he could not revolt against the Persians unless assist-' ed by the barhadis. Jiand Yarmoha^ madzai had promised assistance but he could not rely on him as the Sarhadis w ei e influenced by Idu Khan who would not let them unite with Sarbaz tribes and there is mutual distrust, Nowsherwan is credited with having instigated the robbery of the arms of 30 Qashunis between Iranshahr and Bampur about 8 th August. 59. Sistan and Qainat.—The Afghan frontier in the neighbourhood of Sistan has been and still is very disturbed. Cons tant raids are taking place and murders are of every day occurrence. Further details will be found under paragraph “ Lawless ness,” There is much uneasiness in Sistan owing to the operations of the Revenue Commis-i sion there, under the leadership of MajkK us-Sultana. The Commissioners are em deavouring to obtain signatures to further leases of Khalseh lands, often at enhanced rates. While huge sums of money are still outstanding, and can in fact never be re covered, for the rents for former years, to ean leavour still further to enhance the rent for such lands, seems utterly incom prehensible and unnecessarily disturbing to the cultivators, who by various intrigues are induced to sign contracts which they ean never expect to fulfil. Every endeavour has been made by the Commission to stir up enmity among the local Sardars and to urge them to compete with each other. It is reported that some 100—200 fami lies have entered Persia near Sistan from Afghanistan and have been promised land by the Persians. They were, however not satisfied with the land offered and sub sequently split up among the various oirdars of Sistan. Sardar Khudadad Khan, who has been endeavouring to stiffen the attitude of the land-owners towards the demands of the Revenue Commission, is reported to have been ordered to Tehran. He is accused, among other things, of having been in communication with the rebellious elements m Baluchistan, but this is probably a political manoeuvre, and an excuse to punish him for his attitude in Revenue matters. Up to date of writing this report, he has not left for Tehran and it is being freely said that jobberies, now of such frequent occurrence in Sistan, are due to the activities of his son, who believes that such lawlessness will embarrass the Government and make them cancel the order for his father’s removal from his tribe, fearing further disturbances. The leaders of the famihes which have recently entered Persia from Afghanistan are said to be Khaliqdad and Mauladad who were recently responsible for killing one Shah Mohammed, a well-known Afghan raider. It is believed in Sistan that the Afghan Government demanded from the Persian Government the return of these refugees, but the latter refused on the grounds that they were unwilling to return and they would not resort to compulsion. The ‘ Mustajirs’ of lands in Sistan have appealed to Haji Shaikh Reza, an influen tial Mujtahid of Sistan, now at Meshed on his return from the Haj, to assist them in obtaining more reasonable terms from the Government. On July 9th a fight occurred just out side Nasratabad (Sistan) between an Indian trader and a Berberi, who were travelling together in a motor lorry. The motor-driver ran into the town proclaim ing that the Indian had been killed. There upon the Indians in the Bazaar rushed to the spot followed by various Berberis and a fracas took place between the two parties.A Customs farrash became involved and, it is alleged, was beaten by the Indians. Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Commis sioner, who was in Sistan at the time, took steps to separate the combatants and gave '''orders for a peaceful settlement to be arriv ed at. Some sort of enquiry was held by the Nazmieh, but the Indians declare that their evidence was not fully taken, and have applied to the Vice-Consul, Sistan, for assistance, since they believe the papers have been sent to Birjand. It is difficult to see what assistance could be afforded, since they undoubtedly took the law into their own hands and created a distur bance. It is believed that the matter will be amicably settled in due course. More vigorous and somewhat ill-timed, action has recently been taken by the local Nazmieh officer in Sistan to enforce the wearing of the Pehlevi Kullah. This officer attends meetings and himself removes turbans and takes them to his office. In the villages of Mian Kungi and Deh Dost Mohammed turbans were collected and burnt. I There is evidence that the Government is being much more openly and severely criticised by the public than would have been possible a year ago and that its unpopu larity with the masses is increasing. In Sistan the activities of the Revenue Com- # mission, following on the forced building of new bazaars on the modern Kheyabans together with the artificial regulation of prices by the Municipality is causing very widespread dissatisfaction, 60. Persian Military Affairs, —126 Cam' elry were sent from Khwash to Iranshah r on July 3rd. The troops in Iranshahr were reported to be in very bad health and un able to stand the heat there. The G. 0. C. Baluchistan is responsible for the following information. The Com mand in East Persia is to be re-distributed, The Amir-i-Lashkar’s command will extend to Birjand only. The Reis-i-Tip (Sarhang Mohammed Khan) will have an indepen dent command in Baluchistan including the ports thereof, and may also command in Kerman, Sartip Ali Shah Khan will be relieved as his work is considered un satisfactory. He did not know under whose command the troops in Sistan would fall. The Military Departnent is construct ing four large water-tanks at Khwash, Coolies were forcibly taken from Duzdap for the work. On July 15th, 14 lorries were commam deered at Duzdap for the transport of 250 men (150 of the Kerman Brigade and 100 Zabuli Fauj) who had been withdrawn from Iranshahr to Kerman. By the 15th July Hoshak, Dawar Fana* Jalk and Kila Zabuli had been evacuated by the Persians and the troops concentrated in Khwash, and the G. O. C. said he had been further ordered to evacuate Bampur, Iranshahr, Shastun and Bakhshan, but these orders were presumably later rescinded on the situation in Shiraz improving. The forts at Keshak, Sarjoi and Da war Fana have been demolished by the Persians. Later unconfirmed information is to the effect that about half the garrisons of Khwash and Bampur have been sent to Kerman in small parties and at night in order that the partial evacuation of Balu chistan should not be too obvious. The Rais-i-Sakhlu Sistan, who is can tonment commander has been collecting masons and coolies for despatch to Balu chistan for military work there. In the Qainat forced subscriptions are being levied to cover the “ cost of recruit ment ” of the conscript force to be raised. Conscription being highly unpopular, the levying of a subscription to cover the alleged “ cost of recruitment ” is naturally intensely resented, On 10 th August 130 men of the Kerman Brigade reached Duzdap from Iranshahr and proceeded to Kerman, They were replaced by 350 camelry from Khwash. An unconfirmed report is to the effect that the camelry headquarters is transferred from Khwash to Iranshahr where they will be commanded by Yawar Azizullah Khan. The General Officer Commanding Sistan Brigade, Officer Commanding in Baluchistan was having a house built at Kosha where he recently received His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Duzdap. At the end of July the partially built house was demolished and he left with his family for Khwash. It is reported that he received orders to enrol 2,000 Baluchis for service in Kerman aud that the Sarhadis are providing 500 and Sardar Khudadad Khan and Sardar Ali Khan of Sistan have been instructed to raise the remainder who will be armed and paid by the Persians. The report is as yet unconfirmed but may indicate an attempt by the Persians to keep the Baluchis quiet by employing them. 61. Persian Officials Abdul Wahab Khan Bader, arrived at Duzdap from Tehran on 29th June en route for Karachi where he has been appointed as Persian Consul.% m u ■ Mirza Hussain Khan Mehrdad, Civil Governor designate of Duzdap, arrived there on 18th July. Hussain Quli Khan, Military Governor was however unwilling to hand over to him and the Kais-i-Tip is said to have referred to the Amir-i-Lashkar objecting to the appointment of a Civil Governor. The Rais-i-Tip complained that he had no official intimation of the arrival of a Civil Governor. Mirza Hussain Khan took over charge of the Governorate on 23rd July. He expressed a wish to co operate to the utmost with His Majesty’s Vice-Consulate. Mirza Hassan Khan Karimi, Naib 2, has arrived from Meshed and relieved Mirza Assadullah Khan as officer Com manding Amnieh, Birjand. One ‘ Wagner’ a geologist said to be em ployed by the Persian Government arrived in Birjand from Tehran on July 3rd and toured in the district till 9th when he left for Meshed. Naib Sarhang Murteza Khan resumed his appointment as Frontier Commissioner on 29th June. He is making his summer headquarters at Birjand and will later proceed to Sistan. A party of some 30 Revenue officials and surveyors arrived at Doraksh about 4th July. Their expenses had to be borne by the inhabitants. One Albizadeh a surveyor purchased carpets which he subsequently sent to Hoshimoff at Meshed. Mirza Mohammed Khan arrived at Bir jand from Meshed on 20 th July to take charge of the office of the Reis-i-Maheh. The Rais-i-Nazmieh Duzdap is reported to be acting in agreement with one Abdulla Jan clerk to N. A. Mullick to raise the hire of motor lorries for pilgrims to Meshed. He detains lorries in Duzdap until the hire is raised to a figure which permits of his receiv ing Krans 5 per passenger and an increased hire to N. A.. Mullick’s firm, or his clerk. This action combined with commandeering for genuine military requirements at Duzdap and Meshed caused the rates for goods bet ween Duzdap and Meshed and Sistan to advance 100 per cent, about the end of July. Suleman Khan Asadi, Deputy for Sistan, has been paying a visit to his constituency. He has talked largely of the improvements he is likely to effect shortly in Sistan, but as his performances have never by any means equalled his promises the public is little impressed. The Governor, Sistan and certain officials are alleged to have telegraphed to Tehran that a Court was unnecessary as they could settle everything satisfactorily. Leading merchants have telegraphed a ‘ counter blast ’ to the effect that work is at a stand still owing to there being no court. The fact is that the Governorate and Nazmieh derive pecuniary benefit from the present situation, although they have no means of giving effect to any orders made in settlement of dis putes. 62. Soviet Activities. —Jagorbekian, Ar menian Attache of the Soviet Consulate Sistan was in Duzdap from 27th-31st July. He purchased there a Ford car for the Soviet Consul. The Soviet Consul, Sistan is known to have two informers in Iranshahr. It is reported in Duzdap that the Soviets have been landing goods at Bandar Abbas during the past three months and intend to import via Chahbar and to appoint agents in Persian Baluchistan. Jagorbekian was also in Duzdap from 13th-19th July. He is said to have stated he wished to open an agency in Duzdap for Russian petrol, sugar and cotton piece-goods from Meshed. Attention has already been drawn in these diaries to the constant visits to Duzdap of members of the Sistan Soviet Consulate. There is some recent evidence that they are in communication with Baluch tribal chiefs near Mian Kungi. The Soviet Consul is reported to have or dered the following maps from the Survey of India, Calcutta : Southern Asia Series, ’’j North Persia. South Persia. 3 copies each. Afghanistan and Balu- I chistan. j Sarhang Murteza Khan, Frontier Com missioner, in conversation with the Attache of this Consulate, said that it had been re ported to Tehran that Sardar Khudadad of Sistan had received from the Soviet Consulate two bundles of propaganda papers for dis tribution in Persian Baluchistan. He (the Sarhang) did not beheve this and considered Khudadad too loyal. He volunteered the in formation that he suspected a certain Amnieh Officer (formerly in the Sistan Levy Corps and now a British pensioner and in possession of a British decoration) of being in Russian employ. The Sarhang also stated he had information that the Soviet Consulate were endeavouring to encourage Sarhad Baluchis to emigrate to Bokhara under promise of employment to assist Nabi Khan in a future expedition into North Afghanistan. An unsigned letter (translation attached) has come into my possession. It has not been possible to trace any British official orv , -ll| 'ds fm| eei drm;;- risitstofts; i tefe ffitlttr: uciist#' ■ oliiiite# iriTlfl# Ik* S' lani# s 5# ! traveller as having been in the vicinity of .Daulatabad at the time the letter was written. It may have been prompted by the Soviet Consulate. The writing is said to be that of one Quli Khan, a School teacher in Sistan ..jsho is known to be employed by the Soviet Jonsul. The Soviet Consul is reported to be very active in Sistan in persuading traders to import Russian goods via Meshed, and has called for samples of any cloth required. Certain traders are reported to have given a written undertaking to import Russian goods only. Reports have been received of the des patch of informers by the Soviet Consul to Kandahar and Chaman and the retention of a permanent agent in the Mian Kungi district. 63. Afghan Affairs. —The following Af ghan officials passed through Duzdap from Quetta en route Meshed. 2nd July. ( 1 ) Abdulla Khan s/o Ghulam Mohiud- Din, Mardak, with 16 women and 2 children.

He is said to be endeavouring to obtain a visa for India. The Afghan Consul, Sistan has caused all Afghans there to sign a mutabiat Nameh ” (document protesting allegiance to Habib- ullah) which he has sent to Kabul. The matter was concluded as secretly as possi ble. Sarhang Murteza Khan informs me that he has intelligence that an armed force has been sent near the Sistan frontier by Habib- ullah, but has no officer in charge, although one is expected. Their number is said to be 450. MC465ED • F \ e - ^%han coin imported into Sistan vide diary for April has been lodged there in the Imperial Bank of Persia. Some 1,300 tomans are said to have been deducted owing to defaced coins. 64. Lawlessness. —The state of lawless ness which now exists in Sistan and Qainat and along the Aighan border is illustrated by the following incidents :— On the night of 1st July 5 murders took place near Sistan— 2 at Deh Nuf. 2 near Sharifabad. 1 near Bunjar. About 2nd July, a young woman was murdered near the village of Gauri. On the night of 4th J uly, 1 murder by Afghans near Taqbazi. 2 grain chowkidars killed near Milak and grain stolen. 1 killed and grain stolen near Deh Dost Mohammad. 7th July. —12 cows stolen by Afghans in Mian Kungi. 10th July. —Village of Sharifabad attacked by Afghans. 11th July.—Shah Mahmud and Shah Mawaz well-known Afghan raiders, looted 40 camels from the Maldar tribe of Baluchis.

One man killed at Deh Ali Jaafer. Two men killed at Karku. 14th July. —Two Brahuies killed by Afghans of the Kabdani tribe near Qila-i- Nau and goods looted. 18th July. —Two Amnieh men attacked by Afghans of Rakhshani tribe near Sha- galak.

About 28th July. —Three robbers attacked an armed man accompanied by a girl near Kaud. He killed two robbers with one shot, and the third fled. A number of other robberies have also bem reported from time to time, including robbery of the arms of Amnieh and inter ference with them on duty.65. Communications. —Reis-i-Tip Mo hammed Khan states that Tomans 50,000 were sanctioned for a road from Bampur to Chahbar. He has only Tomans’^S^O' lefKwhicline proposes to utilise for repair ^^e Kejmup^ am^iir road. On com pletion ot tneserepairs he will apply for further funds for the Chahbar road which the (rovernment is anxious to have con structed. He proposes to proceed to Chah bar via Karachi in October and inspect the route from that port to Bampur. The road from Mirjawa to Mirjawa British Fort has been recently repaired and two bridges are about to be built. The contract for conveyance of mails between Duzdap and Meshed has terminated. 1 ersian mails are at present being carried by lorries engaged through the garage-i- Khan, Meshed. The rates for lorries between Duzdap- Meshed and Huzdap-Sistan rose by nearlv [00 / 0 in July partly due to commandeering by the military and partly attributable to dishonest practices of the Nazmieh in 1 )uzdap in conjunction with a clerk employed by N. A. Mullick. The ravages of the 120 days wind in Sistan have done incredible damage to the Sistan-Duzdap “ road It was never better than a bad cart-track but is now almost impassable. His Majesty’s Consul took 7 hours to accomplish the journey Girdi-Sistan in a light car. On account of the bad state of the road and the ngh wind and dust-storms, no lorries had been on the road for a fortnight, and of lose which had ventured previously many were broken down and abandoned. uu. movements of Foreigners. —S.

(C) Register of traders at Birjand.—The Adlieh Birjand has requested Indian traders to have each page of their account books stamped with the Adlieh seal and numbered consecutively, stating that entries on such documents would be accepted as proof of petty claims for which receipts are not taken. It is difficult to see how this would prevent false entries by the trader himself. C. K. DALY, Major, His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain, Camp Birjand : The 17th A ugust 1929.Translation No. 21 {Confidential), dated the 14-5-1307 (6th July 1928), to the Officer Commanding, Sistan Wing. After compliments. —When I was going to Sheb-i-Ab I saw two British Consulate employees with two horses going to Daulat- abad. They said that an officer has come by motor from Duzdap who will go out shooting to Koh-i-Khwaja. I sent a foot man fiom Deh Tuti to ascertain facts at Daulatabad. who on return reported to me, from which I have gathered the following — 1 . The said officer is staying in the garden of Sardar Mohd. Reza Khan and intends to stay for a few days in Daulatabad. Tents and other necessaries for reception were provided by Sardar Mohd. Reza Khan, as tents were pitched by servants of the Sardar a few days before the arrival of the officer. 2 . The persons taking the horses stated that the officer intends to go out shooting to Koh-i-Khwaja. As at present the river is without water and it is not a shooting season, I think the officer has got some other views because he is not goingout for sh oot- ing but will stay in Daulatabad. 3. There are two or three other persons with the officer in the tents, who rarely come out of their tents and have not there fore been recognised. 4. In my opinion this officer has been deputed from Duzdap to remain on the road and see the condition of the military leaving Sistan for Duzdap and report on it. 5. As Bahaduran Awwal-Jambaz is about to leave in 2-3 days time and all the per sonnel are freshly recruited it is requested that instructions may be issued to the per sonnel that owing to the presence of this officer at Daulatabad, they should while passing the said village keep good outward order.

Dost Mohammed is said to have written to his father to the effect that the Shah had appointed him Governor of Persian Baluchistan and that he would be allowed to return “ when he had learnt the work,” and that the Baluchis should obey all Per sian officials, otherwise he would not be allowed to return. Ali Mohammed (father of Dost Mohammed) is reported to have sent the letter in original to the Military Gov ernor of Baluchistan, Sarhang Mohammed Khan; protesting loyalty and denying that there was any foundation for the rumours that he and Nowsherawan Khan have contemplated rising against Persian Rule. Relations between the Military Governor and Idu Khan are believed to be strained, as the latter is no longer trusted by the Per sians. The Governor of Baluchistan published a proclamation No. 2146, dated the 24th Khurdad (14th June) in which he denied that there were any grounds for uneasiness among the tribes as regards the intentions of the Persian Government and affirming that the latter is solely concerned in bringing good rule and order into Peisian Baluchis tan, and that the tribes will be assisted and given every consideration, etc. In conversation with the Trade Assistant, Duzdap, the Military Governor, Baluchistan, enquired whether the detention of Dost Mohammed in Tehran met with the ap proval, or otherwise, of the British Govern ment. He was told it was a matter of indifference, except that the British Gov ernment desired to see law and order established in Baluchistan as it conduced to friendly relations owing fo the absence of dacoities on the frontier. No work has been done on the proposed roads beyond Bampur towards Chahbar and Pishin, but the Governor States such roads are projected but construction is held up for want of funds. The Director of Customs, Duzdap, is believed to have been asked from Tehran whether he could arrange to establish customs posts in Baluchistan. He is re ported to have replied in the negative, and the Military Governor has stated he would; be strongly opposed to such posts being started. Reference paragraph 42 diary for May, last sub-paragraph—Yawar Sikander Khan has postponed his projected visit to Chahbar and is proceeding on leave to Tehran. The telegraph line from Khwash to Dizak is now under construction. Persian Military. 50. Sarhang Mohammed Khan, Reis-i- Tip and Military Governor, Baluchistan, has taken up summer quarters at Kosha.

Zharbik, Armenian clerk in the Soviet Consulate, Sistan, visited Duzdap, 4 th- 6 th June, apparently to purchase foodstuffs and liquor for the Consulate. The fre quency with which members of the Sistan Soviet Consulate visit Duzdap ostensibly to obtain supplies, is somewhat remarkable. It is a long and arduous journey to perform in the hot weather for such a purpose. The Military Governor, Baluchistan states that he has been asked by the Soviet Consul for permission to proceed to Khwash to purchase wool. He was told he could go but the Persian Government would not be responsible if he encountered any diffi culties with the Baluchis. The Military authorities have been instructed to watch and report his activities.

Sarhang were present:— return from dehran he sent a message to declined to take the oath until Sirdar Nowsherawan Khan to the effect that Nasrullah Khan should have allied himself Dost Mohammed wished him to purchase to them. He accused Idu Khan of a car for his use and proceed in it with wishing to oust Dost Mohammed for his Idu Khan to Tehran. Nowsherawan sus- own advancement. One informer report- pected this as a ruse to get him to Tehran ed that an oath was taken, but another and refused to comply with Idu Khan’s report denies that this was so. The meet- wishes. Throughout the early part of ing is said to have become known to the May reports indicated considerable unrest Persian military authorities and Idu among the tribes and that negotiations Khan was suspected of having reported it, were constantly, being conducted with and Sirdar Jiand Khan is said to have a view to effecting alliances against the openly reproached him and threatened that Government, but as much distrust exists he would be killed if he deceived the among the various tribes, some of whom Baluchis. Juma Khan Ismailzai is said had supported the Persians in the opera- to have suggested that any rising should tions in Baluchistan, and as all are now be led by Idu Khan to show his good very distrustful of Idu Khan, there does faith. The unsympathetic treatment meted out allegations may be, it is certain that Idu to them by the local military authorities Khan now has little influence in Baluchis- since the occupation of Baluchistan has |_ an and in the event of a serious rising he undoubtedly deeply offended all the tribal WO uld not be in a position to help the Sirdars. Persians to the extent that he did in the A meeting is reported to have been held last operations. In spite of the numerous on or about the 8 th May at Idu Khan’s reports of disaffection among the tribesall the Baluchi Sirdars and the Sirhadis including Juma Khan Ismailzai and Sirdar Jiand meet the Reis-i-Tip at Khwash and drew their allowances. Sarhang Moham med Khan asked Jiand Khan why he had declined to come to Khwash when sent for previously by him. His reply was to the effect that he had heard that arms were to be demanded from his tribe and to surrender these they would never agree. Din Mohammed, Rind, of Chahbar, a brother-in-law of Dost Mohammed is said to have rebelled and announced his intention of raising a lashkar and joining forces with Nowsherawan. The grounds for this are said to be that Dost Moham med formally levied a tax of Re. 1 per bundle on all goods landed at Chahbar, but this has been stopped by the military commandant there. The Reis-i-Tip has ordered Yawar Sikandar Khan, 0. C. Dizak, to proceed to Chahbar and endeavour to effect a peaceful settlement. 125 infantry are said to have been sent from Dizak by road to Chahbar. 43 . Persian Officials. —Yawar Moham med Sadiq, Governor^ Duzdap, has been relieved by Sultan Hussain Quli Khan and has proceeded to rejoin his regiment at Meshed. Naib Hussain Quli Khan of the Meshed Nazmieh assumed charge of the Nazmieh Duzdap . on 8 th May. Mirza Abbas Khan, Passport Checking Officer on the railway at Duzdap, has been transferred to Tehran and is relieved by one Mirza Ahmed Khan. The former was very helpful to British subjects at Duzdap. There is a rumour that Mohammed Ibrahim Khan (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) may be appointed Governor General of Persian Baluchistan, but it is not confirmed and it is doubtful whether he would accept such an appointment. 44. Persian Military Affairs. —When at Dizak, the G. 0. C., Eastern Division, gave special promotion to 60 ' Qushu- nis ’ of the Sistan Brigade and issued medals for the operations in Baluchistan. Yawar Hassan Khan Fateh, 0. C. Khwash, left for Meshed about 5th May. A party of some 100 cavalry proceeded to Sistan from Duzdap on 10 th May— while a detachment of 120 left the latter place, arriving at Birjand on 27th en route for Meshed.* 100 infantry reached Duzdap from Dizak on May 26th. These small movements are said to be the first of a general movement of the Bampur Brigade (on relief by Kerman Brigade) the cavalry of which will go to Sistan, while the infantry will proceed to Birjand. This information has not been confirmed, but was brought to the Soviet Consul at Sistan by two of his informers from Persian Baluchistan.

Sistan Amnieh posts have been re armed with rifles of Russian manufac ture. 45. Soviet Activities. —The Soviet Consul, Sistan, visited Duzdap from 9th—13th May. His visit is said to be in connection with arrangements for the new building in the Sistan Consulate. ^ , He was visited by the Governor^ who warned him of complaints received from Indians that he or his officials had been in the habit of speaking to Indians with i animosity against the British, and he would be well advised to cease doing so. The Consul denied this, and said he had been particularly chosen by the Soviet Govern ment for this frontier because he was a peaceful man. He said he knew he was always watched when in Duzdap. There was a rumour current in Sistan that the Soviet Consul would shortly be relieved, as a result of a complaint against him made by his predecessor Platte. On 26th May four Russians from Tehran passed Birjand en route for Sistan. Their names were reported as :— Efklis, Grykos, MelikoR and Dalsky. Abraham Minasiantz, Soviet wool agent from Meshed, proceeded from Birjand to Sarbesha during the month but did not purchase, prices being too high. A British Indian trader who went on the same day purchased wool at Krans 400 per Kharvar- Tabrizi. 46. Afghan Affairs. —A party of Afghan officials who had been sent 3 years ago to Europe for military training left Duzdap (having arrived there from Herat via Meshed) for Quetta on 5 th May. The Afghan Consul, Sistan, who is an addict to opium, had a low brawl with his son in some dispute regarding the Consul’s Persian mistress, which caused temporary excitement, the son declaring he would have his father arrested. The matter was some how smoothed over by the intervention of Persian officials. On 13th May a small gang of Afghan robbers under Latif Khan raided Charm.Borne of the gang were arrested by the Amnieh from Darukhsh. TheO. C. Amnieh on the 15th sent for Latif Khan and he ap peared at Masumabad. He and his broth er ere arrested and taken to Birjand. The C. Amnieh then started for Yezdan intending to search the tents of Latif Khan at Patragan, he being suspected of smug gling opium. A fracas occurred in which the Amnieh were worsted and returned to Masumabad, where reinforcements and tribal assistance from Brahui and Bahloli tribes were gathered, mustering about 100 , Meanwhile Latif Khan’s followers estimated at 300 left Patragan for Yezdan neighbour hood. H. E. Shaukat-ul-Mulk under instruc tions from the G. 0. C. Eastern Division sent representatives to endeavour to effect a peaceful settlement. Some arrangement was made and under orders of the G. O. C. rifles were distributed to selected persons of Yezdan to enable them to protect the village from further depredations on the part of the followers of Latif Khan who is still detained in Birjand. The Afghan Consul, Sistan, is reported to have received a telegram through the Soviet Consul to the effect that the Afghan money held in Sistan {vide paragraph 38 of diary for April) is the private property of the ex- King Amanullah. 47 . Miscellaneous. —A further case of small-pox occurred at Mirjawa on 6 th May. Persian Post Offices have been opened in Khwash and Iranshehr. The telegraph line from Mirjawa to Khwash is now completed. The portable wireless set which has been in use in Duzdap has been sent to Khwash and jyill be used there until the telegraph line to Iranshehr is complete. Malieh offices have been opened in Khwash and Iranshehr, but the Baluchis are said to have been told that no revenue will be collected for a year. Efforts, which are not proving effective, have been made to deal with the young locusts, but immense damage has been done in the Kainat and large swarms are hatching out in the Birjand area. A school has been opened at Khwash and has about 70 Baluch children attending. They are fed by the Government. Posts of 6 sowars each, armed mounted police, will be established at Birjand, Duzdap and Sistan from June 20th. 48.

M.’s Consul visited Duzdap from 7th| 10th April. He left Sistan on 23rd April arriving at Birjand on 26th. 33. Persian Baluchistan.—Reference paragraph 21. Sarhang Mohammed Khan accompanied by K. S. Idu Khan reached Fahreh on 15th April Dost Mohammed having been detained at Tehran. While at Duzdap H. M.’s Consul was visited by a nephew of Idu Khan who evinced anxiety regarding the delay in the return of Idu Khan and Dost Mohammed from Tehran. He suggested that Sarhang Mohammed Khan would be likely to oppose their return as he had a personal quarrel with the Amir- i-Lashkar and retention of Dost Mohammed in Tehran would be likely to lead to further outbreaks in Baluchistan which would in volve the Amir-i-Lashkar in difficulties. The argument was not very convincing, inasmuch as Idu Khan was formerly on good terms with the Sarhang and opposed to the Amir-i-Lashkar. The change of front may have been due to the discovery that the Amir-i-Lashkar’s reputation had not been damaged in Tehran by the intri gues of Mohammed Khan and Sarhang Murteza Khan ; and a desire to find a “ modus vivendi ” with the Gr. 0. C. whose position is likely to be more secure than ever. Yawar Sikandar Khan, 0. C., Dizak is. reported to have sent for Mohammed Shah Khan, Sardar of Magas, and Lashkar Khan of Gamshadzai, and to have ordered them to produce some Baluch recruits. They declined to take any action pending return of Idu Khan and were both detained at Dizak. Consequent on the theft of a military camel by a Baluch of Yarmohammadzai tribe the 0. C. Khwash withheld the pay of Jiand Khan, the Sardar, pending return of the camel. The Sardar declined to investi gate the matter until the return of Idu Khan. His pay was subsequently offered him by the 0. C. Khwash but he declined to receive it and threatens to migrate from Persian Baluchistan. Sarhang Mohammed Khan with K. S. Idu Khan reached Khwash during the week ending 21st April. Yawar Hassan Khan Fateh, 0. C. Khwash is said to have been placed under arrest and a secret enquiry to have been held regarding his conduct. Sarhang Mohammed Khan relieved Sartip Ali Shah Khan who has proceeded with his Brigade to Kerman. 200 men of the Kerman Brigade have remained at 1 ahreh. It is reported that Sarhang Mohammed Khan intends to endeavour to get Nowsherawan Khan, brother of Dost Mohammed, to Khwash and to send him to Tehran. A report has been received to the effect that Sardar Hamal Khan of Hushak who opposed the Persians at Dizak was arrest ed at Dizak and shot by Yawar Sikander Khan who stated that he had attempted to escape. Information has been received that Sartip Ali Shah Khan was informed that the British have advanced their frontier pillars between Mekran and Persian Baluchistan by a distance of 65 miles, and that the Sartip reported this to Tehran. 34.

Discipline timong the officers of the Sistan Brigade is reported to have been very bad owing to the quarrel between Sarhang Mohammed Khan and the Amir- i-Lashkar. They openly criticised the latters conduct of operations in Baluchis tan.

Russian Affairs. —Fatehullah Gauhri, Armenian born Persian subject suspected of Bolshevik activities arrived at Duzdap on 26th and proceeded to Bombay on 27th March. He is reported to have arrived at Bombay on 5th April and left for Port Said on 10 th en route to Palestine. He told the police in Bombay that he was a partner in the firm of Amin Azizullahoff of Meshed. This statement is believed to be untrue. Reference paragraph 25. Mizak visited the Trade Assistant Duzdap on 31st March. He complained of bad treatment by the Russians and said his brother had lost Tomans 100,000 by taking wool to Russia on their advice. The wool was confiscated in Russia. He expressed a desire to serve the British. The Soviet Consulate Sistan has received a considerable sum of money during April. Additional buildings are being added to the Consulate and a portion of the present building demolished. Permission to de molish with gunpowder was refused by the Persian authorities. New buildings are reported to be for the installation of a new and larger wireless installation to enable public concerts to be given. It is rumoured that the Soviet Consul is endeavouring to engage Baluch agents ostensibly tor the purchase of wool in Persian Baluchistan. The Soviet hospital Sistan is said to be importing capsules and injections for fretf ) use of the poor in Sistan. A report has been received that the Soviet Consul Sistan has been evincing anxiety about a man wdio was to proceed to Bombay and who had instructions to make purchases on behalf of the Consulate. The individual’s name was not discovered but this may refer to Fatehullah Gauhri (otherwise known as Fatehullah Nasrullah- zadeh) above mentioned. A local Persian who was instructed by the Soviet Consul to find out if the individual had left for India, went to the serai of Mota Singh in Sistan, where one Ibrahimoff, said to be a Jew, is living. The latter had not left Sistan up till 15th April and was presum ably approached as being in touch with Fatehullah’s movements. The messenger was said to be proceeding via Bombay to Jerusalem and must therefore by the man Fatehullah, who it is therefore established (from several sources), is a Bolshevik agent. Reference paragraph 14 ( 1 ) of diary for February 1929. Muhammed Khan Vossoughzadeh has continued to visit the Soviet Consulate on several occasions while in Sistan, and about 19th April a letter is said to have been received from him to the effect that his company was sending him to Meshed. The Soviet Consul remarked that he was not wanted there, but would be of more use in Duzdap or Shiraz. 38. Afghan Affairs. —Afghan marauders named Shah Mahmud and Shah Nawaz are reported to have raided Mohamed Sharif Khan Looch of Deh Marda tribe and killed his two sons-—this raid took place in Kain. Shah Nawaz was in prison at Farah. He was released and in return protected the Governor for some time and later left Farah. The Mirza tribe, Shiahs, of Persian origin applied for permission to enter Persia near Sistan. During negotiations with the local Persian authorities they moved near the border but were forced by Afghans to return to Farah. The sum of Tomans 16,000 property of the Afghan Government referred to in paragraph 26 of diary for March is still held up by the military in Sistan. The Afghan Consul continues pro- Amanullah propaganda, but is apparently without^ any authoritative news from Afghanistan. He left for Duzdap on 21 st April to arrange the reception of Aman- ullah’s sister Nur-us-Siraj who arrived there on 27th and proceeded to Quetta forKandahar on 28th ; She was accompanied by : 1 . Nasr-ud-Din Khan. 2. Abdui Rasul Khan (late Mustashar- i-Wazarat. 3. Mohammed Samijan (brother of Mohammed Umar Khan, late Director of Education, Kabul). Sardar Abdul Hamid Khan who had applied to Government for permission to reside in India, which was granted under certain conditions, stated he would not accept the conditions but preferred to live in Meshed. He subsequently, however, left for Kandahar via Quetta with Nur-us- Siraj. The following passed through Duzdap en route Kandahar on 21st April :— Mohammed Umar Khan. Mohammed Ayub Khan (late Governor Dirawat of Kandahar). 39. Persian Courts and Law Officials — Reference paragraph 28 diary for March. •No court has yet been opened at Duzdap. The Sulhieh court at Sistan was closed on 20th April and records were despatched to Birjand. The closing of this court is apparently due to intrigues of a party opposed to Misbah, resulting in the trans fer, or dismissal of the Reis-i-Adlieh Sistan, who is a son-in-law of Misbah. There is now no court nearer than Birjand* The Reis-i-Adlieh Birjand has also been transferred and the work of that Court is greatly in arrears. 40. Local Affairs. —On 16th April a per formance under the auspices of the ‘ Lion and Sun ’ was given at Sistan in aid of a fund to build a public library. A good deal of ill-feeling resulted between the organisers and the Governor. It was well attended. The leading actor made a tact less speech intimating that ‘ Culture ’ was confined solely to Tehran and that the locals were still uncivilised. Locusts have done considerable damage througiiout Kain, Sistan and Duzdap areas* A ease of small-pox occurred at Mirjawa on 30th March and a second case late in April. 41. Movements of Foreigners .—Armen Chah Mouzadian, Armenian Persian sub ject, a singer, arrived at Duzdap from Tehran on 25th March and proceeded to Calcutta on 27th* The following arrived at Duzdap from India on 2nd April H.

Persian Baluchistan .—Dost Muham- med returned to Duzdap from Sarbaz and proceeded on 18th March to Tehran via Meshed, He was accompanied by Sarhang Mohammed Khan and Idu Khan. The resentment of the Baluchis against the treatment they received at the hands of the Persian soldiery is said to have caused a revulsion of feeling in favour of Dost Mohammed, A Commission consisting of four Colonels under the presidency of Sartip Abdul Kazzaq Khan of Tehran arrived at Duzdap on March 1 st and proceeded to Khwash en route for Fahreh on 2 nd March, appar ently to enquire into the Amir-i-Lashkar’s conduct of the operations in Baluchistan. The party returned to Meshed from Duzdap on March 21 st, 22. Persian Officials .—Sultan Mohammed Agha, Rais-i-Nazmieh, Duzdap, has been transferred to Tehran (March 14th). Isa Khan Rais-i-Police is temporarily in charge of the Nazmieh at Duzdap, Reza Kuli Khan, Persian Consul at Chakansur, arrived in Sistan on March 16th He stated that order was being maintained at Chakansur with great difficulty. He appears to have left, being in fear as to his personal safety. Sultan Syed Mohammed Jebangir (Rais-i- Amnieh) and his accountant arrived m Sistan from Birjand on March 20 th. In conversation with His Majesty s Consul he complained of the difficulty of main taining order on the frontier, which being originally a geographical boundary (and since the shifting .of the Helmand not even that), was no effective ethnological division and tribes on both sides shielded raiders and were loath to give information fearing reprisals by the raiders relatives on their own side. He made haste to affirm that he did not wish to cr + ltlC1 ^ the arbitration awards of the pas • a later interview the same official remarke that affairs in Afghanistan were so involved that it was not possible to foresee what may happen but that if the Afghans obtained any assistance from “ any neighbouring country ”, such assistance would not be afforded for nothing. 'Sultan Syed Mohammed Jebangir had recently accompanied the Sarhang Murteza Khan on an inspection of the frontier and is believed to be in the latter’s confi dence. He has just been promoted to Yawar. Reference paragraph 14 .—Syed Jalal Khan Zamani (Vice-Consul for Chakansur) left Sistan on 31st March for Chakansur. He complained that the Consul Reza Kuli Khan Farzami was too weak a personality to protect Persian interests and he (V. C.) had been selected by Sarhang Murteza Khan to take a strong line with the Governor of Chakansur, and other officials, particularly with regard to the Helmand water distribution. 23. Persian Military Affairs .—Sultan Ali Ashghar Khan arrived at Duzdap from Khwash on 9 th. He had been put under arrest, owing to his having reported Sarhang Mohammed Khan Rais-i-Tip for holding up rations for his troops. The Amir-i-Lashkar had ordered his release from arrest and transfer to Meshed Bri gade. Troops of the Meshed Brigade have been arriving at Duzdap throughout the month en route to Meshed notably on 15th. Yawar Ali Reza and ten other officers with 10 guns, 150 sowars and 514 infantry and artillery other ranks. This party left for Meshed on 25th March. 24. Military Intelligence.—The Officer Commanding, Sistan, has received news of the following raids during the month, by Afghans into Persian territory : (а) 20 Afghans raided near Khamak (Mian Kanghi district) and wounded two Persians and killed one and escaped with loot.

A CONFIDENTIAL. P 35 28 19292 A party of sowars was despatched from Sistan and the Governor of Farah is reported as having en deavoured to co-operate. 25 In fantry sent by him were unable to apprehend the raiders. (c) On 23rd March Tappu Askari was raided and one person killed.. {d) On 26th the village of Takht-i- Shah was attacked. In conse quence of these raids Sarhang Murteza Khan, accompanied by Kais-i-Amnieh visited the Sarhad on 26th, returning on 31st March. The Sarhang is said to be handing over to Yawar Reza Khan (0. C- Sistan) being under orders of transfer to Meshed. He has been very helpful here and is strongly an^’-Russian. His transfer may be connected with the re-instatement by the Shah of the Amir-i-Lashkar r against whom the Sarhang is believed to have reported. There are said to be only 50 cavalry and 20 Amnieh on the frontier, which will be reinforced on return of troops from Balu chistan. A new post has been established at Deh Tilai, where an exceptionally high *' Burj ’ exists. The Amnieh have received a report to the effect that the well-known Afghan raiders Shah Mohammed Khan and Shah Kawaj Khan are preparing to raid the Randan road. 25. Russian Affairs .—Soviet propaganda and espionage. Reference paragraph 14. The following persons in Duzdap are also reported as having had relations with Zahskinchieff —- (1) Shamsher Singh. (2) Sant Ram, Indian tailor., (3) Hassan Ali, Turk. (4) Azim, Indian tailor, formerly part ner of No.. (2), now employed by Malik Mohammed Ali. (5) George and Andrew, Armenian clerks in Customs. (6) Misak, Armenian liquor shop- owner. The wife of No. 6 visited the Russian Vice-Consul (Fuchs), Sistan. on 1st March. She said her husband had sold his belong ings in Duzdap and could not stay there unless given a fixed salary. She asked what work he could do there now the Baluchistan operations are over. She w T as told he would be employed for propa ganda purposes. She then offered the services of herself and husband as Russian agents in Iranshahr (where the Russians are known to be seeking to establish i agent) stating that she knew Sultan Sikandar Khan and could stay with him. Satoroff, the new Consul, is reported to be an indifferent Persian scholar, but knows a little Turkish. He has been visiting freely and has annoyed Persian officials by unnecessary calls at short notice, and unpunctuality in keeping appointments. He asked the Governor to assist him in pushing Russian trade and is said to have received a rebuff. He further said he had useful ideas for the improvement of Sistan, but was told by the Governor that he had better not disclose them until he had some experience of the place. Reference paragraph 14 (ii). The Rais-b Nazmieh, Duzdap, is reported to have re ceived orders from Meshed to the effect that the activities of Zahskinchieff are to be watched, should he again visit Duzdap, in order that evidence be obtained to enable the Nazmieh Meshed, to obtain sanction from 'Tehran to his being' prohibited from visiting that area. Tire Russian Consulate hospital in Sistan has been re-opened. 26. Afghan Affairs .—Sarhang Murteza Khan returned to Sistan on 15th March after his visist to Kandahar by aeroplane. He declined to disclose to local officials what had occurred, but in conversation with H. M.’s Consul he- remarked— “ Siyasat ra burai Hissiyat fida na- mekunem ” (we will not sacrifice practical politics for religious affinities). Remarks made by various Persian offi cials to H. M.’s Consul would imply that Persia is alert to the possibilities of regaining Herat province in return for assistance ren dered to Amanullah but would be unlikely to afford him support until he can first de monstrate that he has a-solid backing in the country—the Persians in fact consider it advisable to “ sit on the fence ” 'pro-tem. Amanullah is reported by a recent arrival from Kandahar to have announced after the Sarhang’s departure that he had been promised 25,000 Persian troops. Aman ullah had also taken an oath on Khika Sharif ” (a holy garment). The Afghan Consul has been assiduously spreading pro-Amanullah “ news ”.On 13th March a sum of Tomans 16,200 was brought to Sistan from Farah, Its export had been previously advised! from Chakansur by the Persian Consul. It was 'Ordered by the Customs to be placed in the Imperial Bank of Persia, but the Amnieh delayed this, and referred the matter to higher authorities, as ; there were said to be other grounds for objection to the importa tion. It is admitted to 1 be the property of the Afghan Government. It is still under guard at the Amnieh headquarters. On 24th March Sardar Abdul Aziz Khan (Afghan Minister, Tehran) arrived in Sistan. He stated that his return to Kabul from Tehran had coincided with the capture of that town by Becha-i-Saqao. He was looted of all his effects and returned to India w r hence he went to Port Said and met Nadir Khan. The purpose of his visit here is not clear. It has aroused much suspicion among Persian military officers.- He left for Meshed on 31st March, whence he* announced he would proceed to Herat. While in Sistan he visit ed the Russian Consul. He did not call on H. M.'s Consul.. 27. Communications. —Owing to flooding of the Sistan-Duzdap road through motor traffic was suspended for about 10 days early in the month. Rafts have since been con structed capable of carrying cars. Reference paragraph 5 diary for January. The following roads have been completed for motor traffic 1. Duzdap-Gwarkoh-Shurab-Fahreh. 2 . Gwarkoh-Khwash. 3. Shurab-Bam. 28. Persian Courts and Law Officials .—like Rais-i-Sulhieh, Sistan, has settled a num ber of cases involving British subjects quite satisfactorily. My predecessor has left it on record that since the abolition of the ‘ Karguzari ’ there has been a distinct improvement in the manner in which the cases of British subjects have been dealt with. From my personal experience of cases which have recently occurred I have noted a marked inclination to deal fairly with British subjects and in petty criminal- cases there has been no attempt to “'make mountains out of molehills No case has occurred in which the safeguards have been violated. The absence of a Sulhieh Court at Duzdap is causing much inconveniene. Budget pro vision has apparently been made but no offi cial appointed. In consequence investiga tions are in the hands of the Nazmieh who . reports to the Sistan Sulhieh and awaits orders : Instances have occurred in Duz dap of British subjects being placed tem- Pg^nly under arrest in Civil suits, thus Dplating the safeguards—action which has necessitated the intervention of H. M.’s Vice- Consul and such persons have been released on remonstration being made, but it is highly desirable that a Court be speeBily established. The Rais-i-Adlieh, Birjan,- at present in specting in Sistan, has also quite satisfac-' torily disposed of certain cases there. It is however reported from Birjand that the Governor has reported to the higher autho rities that the Adlieh is being mismanaged. 29. Local Affairs. —Imam Juma a vene rable mujtahid of Bun jar, died on 3 rd March. H. M.’s Consul paid the customary calls on the occasion of the No-roz, Hie matter of the Kullah-i-Pahlevi does not appear to have been pursued very keenly in Sistan, A few persons of the labouring class were imprisoned for short periods and fined. This had the effect of frightening the villagers of surrounding dis tricts with a result that for some days they refrained from bringing supplies of meat, eggs, etc., to the market.- 30. Movements of Foreigners. —Otto Sperl ing arrived at Duzdap from Tehran on 5 th and proceeded to Kerman on 11 th March. His visit is said to be in connection with the recovery of his car said to have been stolen and brought to Duzdap by his Indian driver. The driver declared he did this as he had not received his pay. The case was compro mised and he returned with his employer. Otto Sperling stated he intended to open a cinema in Kerman. Vasilyi Saderoff arrived at Duzdap from Karachi on 2 nd March and proceeded to Meshed. The following arrived in Sistan on 13th March :•— 1 . Professor Ernst Hertzfeld, Director of Archaeology,- German, 2 . Theador Bartus, German, 3. Fescf Lackner, German, 4. Joseph M. Upton, American, together with 6 Arabs of Iraq. They proceeded to Koh-i-Kwajah to ex cavate. Their discoveries t©' date have not been great, but include some interesting mural paintings of the Sukkur Dynasty circa 1st—3rd centuries, the better preserved parts of which have been removed. The art shows strong Greek influence.An Infectious disease has been rampant in Kain for some time. Dr. Ziauddin from Turbat and Dr. Mehdi Khan of Birjand municipality proceeded to that area to report. Mr. and Mrs. Kieger of the Oriental Carpet Co., Meshed, visited Duzdap and are now in Sistan.

On 13th he came down from Meshed in a Junker monoplane, circled over Sistan as if thinking of landing and went on to Huzdap where he spent the night.

The Afghan Consul, Mir Mohd. Ali, returned from his visit to Delhi and Dahore towards the end of January and has since kept the Consulate open on behalf of the Kandahar Government. The connection between the Afghan and Soviet Consulates is now closer than ever. Frequent couriers pass to and fro between Sistan and Chakansur and the two Consuls are continually meeting. It is known that no funds have been received from Kandahar and it is probable that the Kussians are financing the Afghan Consulate. Pro-Amanullah propaganda is rife, but the feeling in Sistan is general that the Russian cause (such as it w T as) has suffered a serious reverse as a result of recent events in Afghanistan. their whole capital and credit in rolet lorries are faced with ruin.

Needless to say, w hat with the inferior quality of the lorries, the inefficiency w r ith which they are handled, the badness of the roads and the staggering loads which are carried, few r of them complete half a dozen trips to Meshed before breaking down finally and utterly. A Persian Official recently took .22 days to reach Sistan from Meshed, and changed his lorry five times on the way. But nothing stops the sale of Chevrolet lorries, to the exclusion of more worthy makes. The agent of General Motors Ltd., Mr. N. A.

New Year’s Day Celebrations. 1. The usual reception was held on the morning of January 1st at the Sistan Consulate. A difficulty arose about the presence of Persian officials at the annual dinner in the evening. It appeared that some months before confidential orders had been received by the Governor from Tehran that no official below the rank of 8 th grade should attend receptions at foreign consulates without special per mission. The Pinancial Agent referred the question to Tehran and was ordered to follow the circular. Accordingly at a meeting of officials on 31st December it was decided that the British Consul’s invitation should not be accepted, but that as there was no official in Sistan higher than 4th grade, a reference should be made to Tehran recommending that heads of departments should, in future, be allowed to attend receptions at foreign consulates. His Majesty’s Consul, hearing of this, sent verbal messages to the gentlemen concerned cancelling their invitations to the official dinner and asking them in stead to dine privately later in the month. The officials, who were actuated by no hostility to the Consulate but merely by fear of getting into trouble at headquar ters in case interested parties {e.g., the Soviet Consulate) reported against them, gratefully accepted this solution. Rather illogical ly, however, they all with the exception of the Pais-i-Maliyeh attended the morning reception as usual. The only Persian at the dinner that evening was Sarhang Murteza Khan, the Frontier Commissioner, who as a military officer did not regard himself as bound by the circular. Movements of His Majesty’s Consu lar Officers. 2. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Duzdap, Captain Ryan, returned to Duzdap from Sistan on 2nd January. Russian Affairs. 3. Reference paragraph 130. Fuks continues to officiate as Consul. Money appears to be very tight at the Soviet Consulate and little or nothing is being done. No fewer than ten long telegrams of propaganda against the British in connection with the Afghan disturbances were received from Moscow between 20th and 27th January, hut not much use seems to be made of this mate rial. Rupees 30 worth of Survey of India maps have been imported by the acting Soviet Consul from the Map Record Office, Calcutta. One of the staff, Zahskinschieff (refer ence diary for July 1928, paragraph 85) left for Duzdap in a Dodge lorry on 27th January 19^9. The lorry broke down in the desert about half-way to Duzdap and Zahskinschieff is at the time of writing (7th February) still there. 4. Letters have been arriving in Sistan for the hoys at the State school from “ comrades ” in the Soviet school at Polterask (Askhabad). The second master of the local institution informed His Majesty’s Consul that none of these com munications have been delivered to the addressees. Communications. 5. A sketch map showing the following motorable roads under construction or projected in the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan is appended :— (1) Duzdap-Mirjawa-Dizzak-Magas- Fahreh-Iranshahr (Bampur). (2) Duzdap-Gwarkuh-Shurab-Fabreh. (3) Gwarkuh-Khwash. (4) Fahreh-Charbar. (5) Iranshahr-Rahmatabad (Rigan)- Bam. Construction is proceeding rapidly be tween Duzdap and Mirjawa, and between Duzdap and Gwarkuh. In this connec tion it may he recalled that the sum of Tomans 50,000 was sanctioned by the Persian Government in December for road construction in this area (Meshed diary for December 1928, paragraph 209).

The Sarkassiantz contract does not include Sistan, the mails being carried between this place and Duzdap by donkey. The relative speed and regularity of the donkey service compared with the mail motors is frequently com mented on. The contractor’s Birjand agent has been endeavouring without success to obtain petrol on credit from Messrs. Mota Singh Sewa Singh, the agents for the Anglo-Persian Oil Com- pany. Afghan Affairs. 7. Apart from the Parah affair of January 13th already reported, when the Deputy Governor, the Qazi and one or two other officials were killed and the bazaar looted by Nurzais, there have been no disturbances in S.-W. Afghanistan. A well-known bandit named Shah Mohammed, who was liberated by the Nurzais from jail at Parah, collected a gang at Lash Juwain whence for some days he threatened Afghan Sistan, but the troops from Chakansur and Kila Kang, who had left for Kandahar just before the disturbances, turned back and speedily restored order at Parah and elsewhere. There has been four cases of raiding on a small scale into Persian territory, east of Sistan town, and a detachment of troops has been sent out to Milak on the Helmand River to assist the Amnieh guards. Rumours of the disturbances at Sabzawar between Parah and Herai reported by His Maiesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, have reached Sistan, but details are lacking. The latest information to hand from Parah is that Abdur Rahim Khan Barakzai, leader of the gang responsible for the outrages, has been arrested, and that the Muin (Governor) of the district has gone to Kandahar. 8 . Reference paragraph 130. The new Persian Consul for S.-W. Afghanistan is Reza Quli Khan Parzam who was not long ago in the accounts and records branch of the Poreign Ministry. A Vice-Consul, Syed Jalal Khan, has also been appointed. The latter spent some days in January at Deh Dost Mohammed on the Afghan frontier study ing the situation in Afghan Sistan, bat neither he nor the Consul have crossed the border. Local Affairs. 9. Association Football in Sistan .— His Majesty’s Consul’s efforts to organize association football and popularize it among the Persians have met with considerable success. The game has been played in a desultory fashion at the Consulate since 1924, but this winter for the first time a challenge cup has been competed for between regular teams re presenting the Consulate and the town. His Majesty’s Consul has coached the Persian team as well as that of the Consulate on several occasions, and the games have been much more closely contested of late than in the past. On the occasion of the third and last match for the cup on 2nd Pebruary, all the Persian officials and several leadins; traders were entertained to tea, and a large crowd of British and Persian subjects also watched the game with great interest. The result was a win for the Consulate by two goals to one. The Persians play a thoroughly good-natured and “sporting” game, and the excel lence of the effect upon the relations between the Consulate and the town cannot be too strongly emphasized. 10. Another innovation in this line wLich may have lasting results is the introduction of football into curriculum of the State school. The latter institu tion which is situated in the middle of the town has no playing-fields, and it ■would not have been possible for the boys to play if His Majesty’s Consul had not offered to place the Consulate football- ground at the disposal of the school two days a week. The first few times His Majesty’s Consul personally assisted the second master, M. Wahiullah Khan Raoufi (himself a fair player and a member of the Sistan team), to coach the boys, and the latter are making excellent progress. No doubt this “ interference ” by the British Govern ment in education matters will he duly reported by the Russian Consulate to Tehran and Moscow.

He is charged with being on too friendly terms with the Bussian Consulate, but the real reason for his recall is the personal jealousy of Sarhang Murteza Khan, Erontier Com missioner. In point of fact, every measure which has been taken by the latter against Soviet Consulate intrigue has been based on information obtained by Ezazi. 119. Beference paragraph 103, Major B. M. Kharegat returned from his tour on 21st December. In addition to the towns mentioned he visited Barfurush, Tabriz. Urumia, Kazvin, Qum and Kashan. Altogether he covered about 6,000 miles in less than two months and visited practically every well-known archaeological site in Persia. Persian Officials. 120. M.

M.’s Gousul re turned his call at Quetta on 4th December and was subsequently able to help him somewhat from the social point of view by introducing him to some influential Parsis and other residents. * k v • - w ' Persian Military. Operations in Persian Baluchistan. Re ference paragraph 108. 124. The following is a summary of the progress of the Persian troops during the period under report:— 2nd November 1928. —Occupation of Sib and Suran by Persian troops advanc ing from Gusht. 7th November. —Qwptu.YQ of Dizzak. 8th November. —Capture of Hoshak, 10th November. —Commencement of westward drive towards Eahreh and Bampur. 17th November. —Occupation of Magas. 20th November. —Occupation of Fahrek by Sistan and Meshed troops under the Amir-i-Lashkar, and of Bampur by Kerman troops under Sarhang Ali Shah Khan,2lst November-15th December. —Con solidation by Persians of Iheir position in the Dizzak-Bampur region; construction of Military roads ; partial disarming of Baluch ; abortive negotiations with Dost Mohammed Khan through inter- medu ries 16 th December. —Commencement of fresh Persian advance south-east wards into the Sarhaz highlands. At the end of December there were strong rumours, unconfirmed from Persian sources, that there had been an engage ment between the Persian troops and Dost Mohammed’s lashkar, and that the latter had received considerable reinforcements from other parts of Baluchistan. (This latter report is probably Baluch propa- ;anda.) In connection no doubt with the re newed Persian advance the following movements from Duzdap were reported towards the end of December :— 5th December. —2,000 pairs of boots obtained from Cawnpore despatched in lorries to Pahreh. 16th December. —120 infantry of the Meshed brigade, who had returned and were under orders for Meshed, left Pahreh on 30th November for Mirjawa en route to the area of operations. 26th December. —30 infantry (re cruits) left for Pahreh under Yavar Nurulla Khan. 31d December — 30 camelry left for Khwash. 80 infantry and 315 empty camels left for Mirjawa to take supplies down the Khwash-Magas-Pahreh line of communications. 125. Casualties. —Sarhang Khan Baba Khan G.S.O I., to the Amir a lashkar, in formed IT M’s Consul on 27th November that the total Persian casualties up to the occupation of Pahreh and Bampur were 1 otticer and 20 men killed, 2 officers and 30 men wounded. Of the killed, the officer (Sarhang Baqar Khan of the Meshed Brigade) and 8 of the men were sho^t treacherously by the Baluch garri son of Dizzak after the surrender of that fortress, while they were being disarmed by a company of Meshed infantry under the Sarhang. In revenge for the deaths of their comrades the Persians are said to have killed about 140 Baluch, but this is probably ami exaggeration. One of the rebel leaders in Dizzak, f^-Subedar Jamaldin Ismailzai, was afterwards con demned to be shot, but was spared by the Amir-i-Lashkar at the request of thr* Ismailzai Sardar, Juma Khan, brother-in- law of e^-Subedar, Sardar Juma Khan had assisted the Persians throughout, and is known to be well thooght pf by the Amir- i-Lashkar {of General Dyer’s high opinion of him recorded in “ Baiders of the Sarhad ”). 126. The Amir-i-Lashkar is pursuing a wise policy in appointing certain of the Baluch sardars who have helped him against Dost Mohammed as deputy gov ernors of their own districts ; e.g., K. S. Idu Khan has been placed in civil charge of the Sarhad, Maruf Khan Gichki of Nahu. Friendly tribes such as the Rekis are being allowed a year in which to sell their arms, instead of being disarmed at once. The Amir-i-Lashkar is also making a point of treating courteously the Baluch headmen who come to see him. 127. Naib Syed Jalal Shah of the Ministry of War, who arrived in Duzdap on 26th December 1928, has been deputed to report on the situation in Persian Baluchistan. He is in mufti. He asked the Trade Assistant, whom he met at the house of the (military) governor of Duzdap on 28th December, three ques tions :— ( 1 ) What are Dost Mohammed’s future intentions ? ( 2 ) Did he intend all along to fight the Persian troops, or have the latter given him no other alternative ? (3) Is he being assisted {a) by the British Government', (b) by any chiefs in British terri tory ? M. Mahmud Gul disclaimed knowledge on the first two points. In reply to the third question, he gave the Naib a full account of all we had done for the Per sians and were still doing, and remarked that if the British Government had really been helping Dost Mohammed, the Persian troops would not have occupied even Gusht. The only chief in British territory, he said, about wffiom there had ever been any doubt was the Nawab of Kharan, and one of the Persian officers^ themselves had told M. Mahmud Gul that the Nawab had been asked by Dost Mohammed to help him but had refused saying that the British Governmentin mufti, li whom Itr iilitarj) p£ eember, to; d all along hi an troop, ^ given him®* e? assisted (n)y jovernmeitii 1 ' Is in Brii : would not allow him to do so. The Naib appeared impressed. 128. IT. M. the Shah telegraphei t° Shahzada Amanullah Miiza at Pahreh 23rd November congratulating him ^vtnd the troops under his command warmly on their victory and promoting the Shah- zada to the substantive rank of General of Division. Pahreh has been renamed “ Iranshahr ” and Dizzak “Amanabad’’ in honour of the occasion. The event was celebrated by official order in Sistan on 26th-27th November and at Dirjand on 8 th December. Free cinema shows were given on three successive nights at the former place. Subscriptions have been raised (also by order) at both places for the purchase of almonds, raisins and socks for the troops at the front, and three lorry-loads of these commodities have actually been despatched from Duzdap. Russian affairs. 129. Beference paragraph 113. Soviet stock in Sistan still slumps* Comrade Vladislav Platte left for Meshed on 22nd November and will not return. The Frontier Commissioner in Sistan, Sarhang Murteza Ali Khan, who is de facto Governor nowadays makes no secret of his determination to thwart the Soviet Consulate in every way and boasts that his success in doing so has been responsible for Platte’s recall. Two of the latter’s secret couriers on the Chakan- sur line, Mahmud and Nazar Siab, were arrested on 28th November 1928. The Police keep the Soviet Consulate under close'surveillance, and a “ black book ” is kept of persons who have been seen to visit it. 130. For some time r it was understood that Laktionoff, once Soviet Consul, Kerman, was to relieve Platte, but news has now been received by the local authorities that one Asatoroff is coming. H. M.’s Consul is informed on good authority that this person is an Armenian who has recently been Vice Consul at Maku, and that he will be accompanied by a woman (not, of course, his wife) called Arusiak who has been serving for the last five years in Persia as an agent of the O. G. P. IT. in Transcaucasia. Meanwhile, t’;e Vice-Consul Fuks officiates as Consul. - 130. Soviet Consulate Hospital .— Beference paragraph 111 . Dr. Morozoff after some delay opened a dispensary, but very soon closed it again as it was discovered by the local authori ties that he did not possess the requisite permit from the Ministry of Health. It is understood that the matter has been referred to Tehran. Local Affairs, : . '• 131. Introduction of the “ Pahlavi Kulah Meetings for the promulgation and enforcement of the new law relat ing to “ Pahlayi hats” were held at Birjand on 25th October and in Sistan town on i2th November. There is re markably little opposition to the measure in Sistan except from the Say ids, and the only difficulty is that the one hatter Sistan boats cannot turn out enough of the new kulahs to go round. He is making a good thing out of his mon opoly. 132. The Bussians are taking an un healthy interest in the Pahlavi Kulah and its enforcement. At the Sistan meeting Haji Abbas Quli, the chief Bussophile merchant in Sistan and or ganizer of the “ Ittihadieh Coy ”, was the leading spirit. The first question Platte asked on arrival at Birjand on his way to Meshed was whether the Pahlavi Kulah had been introduced there, and how it was being taken. ^ 133. Opium.— Strong measures are being taken by the Police in Sistan to control the use and sale of opium. Many dens have been closed and the pipes used in them confiscated. Notices have been posted to the effect that anyone found in unauthorised possession of a pipe or of a quantity of opium will be fined Krans 52. It is said that the eating of opium will be allowed, but nothing is known as to the quantity which will be permitted or the arrangements which will be made for its sale to the public. On the other hand, the cultivation of opium under Malieh licence has been ex- pliclity permitted by proclamation. 131. The Rebuilding of -Un der the guidance of the energetic Fron tier Commissioner the construction of an entirely new town, occupying a por tion of the north-west quarter of the ex isting “ Nasratabad ” and extending a considerable distance into the surround ing country, is proceeding apace. It is well planned and laid out in a network of alternate khiabans (boulevards) and kuchehs (streets) at right angles to one another. The khiabans are 20 meters and the kuchehs 10 meters in width, and the former are being planted withdate palms. Burnt bricks are being used freely for the street facades and for the construction of various public buildings which are already taking shape, notably the municipal Offices, public baths and girls’ school. It is satisfactory to note that the picturesque palm-fringed ruins of Mir Alam Khan’s citadel are not being destroyed, as was at first proposed, hut '(possibly as a result of earnest re presentations by His Majesty s Consul) are being preserved in the middle of the new town and used to house the Amnieh headquarters. 135. More than 1,000 workmen are employed daily on the work at a rate of kransi'25 (about 6 annas) per diem. In addition to the large sums allotted for the new town, the Municipality has just been granted an increase of Tomans 2,000 in its hitherto ridiculously small budget. Altogether Sistan is at the moment receiv ing an unwonted degree of attention from the capital, a fact which has given rise to rumours that the Shah intends shortly to visit Sistan as well as “ Iranshahr as soon as Host Muhammed has been brought to book. The more thoughtful members of the community not unnaturally comment on the Government’s policy of squander ing the Sistan taxpayer’s money on town- pl^ihing instead of an productive works such as roads and canals. Numbers of poor shopkeepers and others whose homes have been destroyed over their heads without compensation feel even more strongly on the subject. 136. Foreign Travellers .—Of several foreigners who have passed through Duzdap during November-December the only one worthy of mention is M. Andor Parkas, Hungarian, who arrived from Quetta on 11th December. This person stated to the Trade Assistant that he left Hungary on 20th October and travelled via Cairo and Bombay to Peshawar with the intention of visiting Kabul. Owm^ to the disturbances he was not permittea to proceed, so he came round to Quetta with the intention of entering Afghanistan via Chaman. The Afghan passport officer however, refused him a visa and he w T as therefore obliged to return to Europe via Tehran. M. Parkas said that in 1915 he was serving in the Austrian army against the Bussians and was taken prisoner. After only a fortnight in detention he escaped and found his way to Kabul where he re mained for 5 years before returning to his own country. He is now a police officer and a member of the Pire Brigade of his home town, Puzes-gyarmat. He holds letters of recommendation from the Central Committee of the Pire Brigade organization of Hungary and from the Director of the Hungarian National Museum at Budapesth. He states that the sole objects of his travels are ( 1 ) col lection of antiquities, manuscripts, etc., ( 2 ) ethnological study and photography, (3) study of the Pire Brigades in different countries. He appears however to be somewhat politically-minded, for at the house of the Governor in the presence of several Persian officers he expressed strong opinions on the subject of the British being at the bottom of the present distur bance in Afghanistan It will be interest ing to see whether he really goes to Tehran, or whether he makes another attempt at Meshed, with the help perhaps of the Soviet Consul General, to enter Afghanistan.

On 21st October His Majesty’s Consul went to Duzdap and from there on the 30th to Mirjawa in con nection with the Persian operations in the Sarhad. 103. His Majesty’s Vice Consul and Medical Officer, Major H. M. K hare gat, left Duzdap on 27th October on a 1^ months’ leave-tour through Persia. He proposes to visit Meshed, Tehran Amu], Enzeli, K^ermanshah, Isfahan, Shushtar, Shiraz ana Kerman. The object of the tour is maiely archaeological. Persian Officials. 104. Duzdap .—Mirza Mohi. Khan Hadi was relieved of the Governorship of Duzdap on 7th October by Sarhang Khan Baba Khan, Chief of Staff, Pastern Army. The Sarhang proceeded on 21st October with the Amir-i-Lashkar to Khwash, and Duzdap is now ruled by his deputy, Sultan Muhtasim-ul-Mulk. Presumably this military control of Duzdap is only for the peirod of the operations in Persian Baluchistan. 105. Sistan .—Deference } aragraph 93. The Prontier Commissioner is not Sultan Mohd. Hussain Khan Muhajir as reported above, but ]S T aib-Sarhang Murteza Khan, of the Shahpur Begiment, who arrived in Sistan with 30 of his men on 1st October. Murteza Khan, who acted for a short time once as G. O. C., Eastern Army, is a good type of Persian officer, unaffected, intelligent and hari-working. His politi cal views, like thosse of his chief, are un exceptionable. His one ambition at present is to catch the Bussians out in some nefarious scheme for causing trouble between Persia and her neighbours. 106. M. Ataullah Khan, Inspector of Customs at Duzdap died at the age of 36 of dropsy, diabetes and malaria on the night of 24th-25th October. He left Tomans 7,500 in the Imperial Bank of Persia, as well as other property. 107. Naib II Miskat-i-Nizam Nigahban took over the post of Superintendent of Police in Sistan on 20th October. This officer, who like Naib-Sarhang Murteza Khan seems particularly well-disposed to the British, is very proud of having once been called in by the G. O. C. the British troops in Khurasan to assist in the in vestigation of a serious theft which took place at the British headquarters, and of having (according to his own account) brought the culprits to book and recover ed the property after the British military police had signally failed to do so. Persian Military Affairs. 108. Operations in the Sarhad and Persinn Baluchistan —As already report ed, the Sistan Brigade under the com mand of Sarhang Mohd. Khan Nakhjawan marched from Khwash on the evening of 28th October towards Dizzak and, pene trating the Gusht defile by surprise the same night, captured Gusht next day from the lashkar of Naushirwan, brother of Dost Mohammad. At the same time a force under Yavar Shahmurad Khan marched along the Pashkuh-Magas road and de eated another enemy lashkar near Kaleh-i-Duzen. Meanwhile the Meshed reinforcements, which had been in camp at Gwarkuh, moved westward and occu pied Khwash in the rear of the Sistan troops. The latest information is to the effect that Magas has been taken and that the Sistan Biigade is pushing on to Dizzak, making a motorable road as it goes. Once in possession of Dizzak and Magas the Amir-i-Lashkar ought to be master of the situation. Dissensions among the Baluch and the general hatred of Dost Mohammed have already greatly assisted the Persians, and are likely to prove the decisive factor. The two Bussian-manned aeroplanes which have been operating from Khwash have done very good work and have had a tre mendous moral effect upon the Baluch of the Bampur-Dizzak area, over whose country no one has ever flown before. 109.

UO. Transport —Some 1,400 ca™! 5 s have been collected by the Peman mil tary authorities and are workin on t Miriawa-Khwash-Gusht and D 1 Gwarkuh-Khwash lines of communication. 15-201 ton Chevrolet lorries have also been commandeered. In addition to he three or four Bord vans owned by the military. At first only 4i kraus pei tar sakh (about od, per miie) was paid, hu on complaints from the owneis (all of whom are British subjects) H. M. s Vice Consul represented the matter to Amir-i-Lashkar who agreed that the hire should be fixed at 9-10 krans. T i roughly the rate current on the Puzdap Meshed road. In this as in all other matters the Amir-i-Lashkar has shown himself most reasonable and anxious t avoid friction of any sort with the But s ' authorities, to whom he has repeataily i ovnioccfid Vns o-ratitude and goodwill. The lorries have been operating chiefly on the Miriawa-Khwash road, but a con voy also succeeded (at the cost &gt; of several breakdowns owing to sand) in reaching Gwarkuh direct from Khwash ihe ex perience of this convoy led the Amir-i- Lashkar to ask for help in importing two six-wheeled Morrislorries similar to that of His Majesty’s Consul, with which he is much impressed ; unfortu nately, none of these vehicles were available for immediate delivery in India, and the opportunity was lost. Ki'ssian Affairs. 111. Medical Officer for the Soviet Consulate .—The long-expected doctor, one Morozoff, arrived in Sistan on Octo ber 23rd. He does not appear to be starting a charitable dispensary in oppo sition to the British one at piesent, but has commenced private practice. This is not Morozoff’s first visit to Sistan. He worked for a few months in 1913 as medical officer to the Kussian consulate, until his transfer was applied for by the Consul, Colonel Vigornitsky. It appears from the contemporary diaries of this Consulate at the time that he came with a young woman whom he called his wife, but who very soon turned out to be nothing of the kind. This time he has come alone. 112. Soviet Intrigues and Propagan- Having altogether failed to discover any semblance of co-operation between/*' the British authorities and Dost Moham med Horn the north and east, and being unable to explain the obvious assistance in the shape of munitions, etc. which is beino- given by the British Government to the Persian troops, the Bolsheviks are now spreading it abroad that we are sup porting Dost Mohammed Khan with munitions and money from the Persian Gulf, via Gwadur. The news of the cap ture by the Sistan troops near Gusht of four of Naushirwan’s Baluch carrying •303 rifles and two British-service bando liers of cartridges each, already reported to Government by telegram, will doubt, less be hailed with delight in Red circles 113. At the moment, Soviet stock in Sistan is low, thanks (1) t&lt;a the Consu late’s unsuccessful championship of the Mudir’s cause in the elections (reference paragraphs 90-7), (2) to their obvious shortage of cash. The lavish scale on which the Consul and his staff commenced operations last year raised the hopes of the Sistanis, whose disappointment at the Russians’ failure to carry out most of their promises {e.g., to buy wool on a large scale and import large quantities of Russian soods for the bazaar) has been correspondingly acute. At the moment it may be safely said that the Russians have scarcely a single friend who is cot actually in their pay. Nevertheless, their capacity for intrigue and mischief-making must not be lost sioffit of, and their efforts to exploit the present strained relations between Persia and 4P*hanistan need specially careful watching. Two frontier questions in particular, in which the Soviet Consul is interesting himself, are (1) the division of the Helmand water between Afghan and Persian Sistan, (2) the nationality of certain migratory cattle-owning ri es the Chakansur-Mian Kangi border, in both oases the Russians, fo ovin^ their usual policy of posing as champions and protectors of Afghanptan, are insti gating the Afghan Consul m Sistan, an through him the Chakansur authorities, to take an aggressive line, and are ing them with arguments and mforma tion culled from the pre-war records of the Russian Consulate. A P report on these two questions submitted when more information is to hand.General Condition oe Country. 114. An indication of the unpopularity of the present regime even in so remote and isolated a place as Sistan is given by \ recent occurrence. The local Health Officer, who as the only active member of the Municipal Committee has been seized by the prevalent mania for town-planning, obtained powers from Tehran to lay out a new town and began as usual by pulling down the houses of a number of poor people without even promising them any compensation. In the rioting which re sulted, necessitating the intervention of the Amnieh guards, the popular _ slogan was “ Down with the Muleteer {i.e. the Shah) who turns us out of our houses”. The following night a picture -of the “Muleteer” which was shown at the cinema was received in silence, except for the plaudits of the carefully-drilled school boys in the front rows. Immediately afterwards came a “ comic ” featuring a performing chimpanzee, which was received with frenzied applause. 115. Owing to the failure of the spring rains the harvest in the Qainat was light, and there is already considerable scarcity. Government grain has accordingly been despatched to Birjand from Sistan, which has also supplied 1,500 Tabriz! kharvars (12,200 Indian maunds) to Kerman. This grain is costing Tomans 18 per kharvar to send to Kerman by camel across the Lut. Miscellaneous. 116.

The General Officer Commanding Persian Eastern Army arrived in Birjand from Meshed on 20th September and left on the 25th for Duzdap in connection with the expedition against Dost Moham mad. While in Birjand he ordered a military hospital with 10 beds to be opened, and granted Ts 30. from military funds to the Municipal doctor for this purpose. Separate reports have been submitted regarding operakons iu the Sarhad and Persian Baluchistan. Persian Officials. 92.

The administration of justice in Birjand, Sistan and Duzdap is carried on under difficulties for the following reasons, among others :— (1) The chief judicial officer in the district, M. Abdul Hussain Khan Adib, has received no pay for six months and is thereb re obliged to make what he can out of his position. Two or three cases of corrup tion on his part have already been reported by the Acting British Vice-Consul, Bir jand. (2) No Public Prosecutor has yet been appointed. (3) No court has yet been opened in Duzdap. An Adlieh mamur or “Mustantiq” Zia-ud-Din Naqabat has been operating in Sistan for the past two or three months. Numerous old criminal cases have been raked up and trouble has been made for various officials, but nothing definite has been effected. Elections in Sistan. 94. Reference paragraph 89. Owing to the local opposition to Misbah- us-Saltana’s candidacy, orders came from Tehran that he should stand down and his son, Suleman Khan Assadi, be elected. The latter accordingly w r ent to Sistan about the end of July accompanied by the Ins pector, Fatimi, and the election proceed ings began all over again. One of the first things Assadi and Fatimi did was forcibly to deport Agha Sayid Ahmad in a lorry to Meshed. The rival candidate thus safely disp sed of, a new Anjuman-i- Nuzzar (Election Committee), consisting almost entirely of Assadi’s supporters, was appointed. Meanwhile Assadi, who is 27 and full of zeal, energetically can vassed the chief mustajirs and local head men, convincing them without much difficulty that it was useless to oppose the nominee of the Tehran Court. He is stated to have spent not less than Ts. 1,000 in Sistan during the 2 months he was there. None the less, certain classes of the population, led by those mustajirs who had sworn to help the ex-school master, showed a cerlain amount of resistance which culminated in a breach of the peace; five blacksmiths, led by one Mohammad Hassan took bast in the telegraph office against Assadi’s threats to deport them, a ssaulted the _ ENCLOSURE IN India fg;;el n cecretaritelegraphist and abused the Acting Governor and Chief of Police who came to remonstrate with them. Things looke n cr lv for a while, but the troops wei( called in and the recalcitrants arrested. Mohammad Hassan v,as deported and t re opposition to Assadi’s election collapsed. The polling was declared on 20th Septem ber as follows :— Asgadi Agha Say id Ahmad Other candidates . 6,297 294 36 It will be remembered that at both^ the pollings in May when neither Assadi nor his father were in Sistan, practically the entire constituency voted for Agha Sayrd Ahmad and Misbah-us—Saltana did not poll a single vote. 05. According to Assadi, who visited His Majesty’s Consul on bis way to Tehran on 6th October, the following is the inner history of the Sistan elections . The enemies of Assadi s father Misbah us-Saltimr, v, ho has combined the func tions of Mutawalli-Bashi of the Meshed Shrine with those of Majlis Deputy for Sistan for the past three years, reported to the S' ah that Misbah-us-Saltana was misappropriating the shrine funds. An enquiry was accordingly held at the Shah’s order by the Amir-i-Lashkar, who report ■ ed that*so far from maladministering the shrine Mishah had increased its resources, with the result that no less tcan 180,000 tomans h. r d been saved in two years. The righteously indignant Mutwalli-Bashi for hwitli resigned, nor would he with draw his resignation until the Shah had pr( raised him a signal mark of favour in the shape of a Deputyship for his son as w^ell as for himself. It w r as accordingly arranged that Assadi should be elected for Tun and 1 abbas, his father standing for Sistan as he had done for the past t ; ree parliaments. These arrangements were temporarily upset when the ambitious ex-schoolmaster of Sistan, Agha tray id Ahmad contested the Mishah’s constituency and with the help of the latter’s enemies and of the Soviet Consulate got himself elected unanimously in May. The Governor of Sistan, Amir Samsam-ud-Daula (a mem ber of the 'old ruling family of the Qainat), actuated by jealousy of the Mishah not only “ rigged ” the election in the usual w r ay, hut afterwards, when Assadi came posting down to Sistan w-ith orders from Tehran in his pocket cancelling Agha Say id Ahmad’s election, despatched a most injudicious telegram to the Minister of the Interior as follows “The whole population of Sis'an is^ hostile to Mishah’s candidature and in favour of the Mudir (Sayid Ahmad) ; Misbah’s son has come here and is intriguing against the Mudir, but I am taking steps to ensure that noth ing is done contrary to the law.' The result was that a few T days later a telegram came from Tehran ordering the Governor to go on 3 months’ leave, and the May polling was deth itely declared null and void. Mishah, however, thought it would he judicio is to stand down, so it u as arranged with the Minister of Court that Assadi should be “ elected ” for Sistan instead of him. This wms accordingly done, as described above. 96. The extent to which Amir Samsam- ud-Daula and the Soviet Consulate respec tively financed Agha Sayid Ahmad s elec tion campaign is uncertain.

Comrade Platte’s activities continue both injudicious and ineffective. His proteges may well exclaim “ Preserve us from our friends ”. His championship of Agha Sayid Ahmad’s cause in the election struggle cost that worthy not only his chance of victory, but his livelihood, for it undoubtedly assisted Assadi in discredit ing his rival, who had thrown up his appointment under the Ministry of Educa tion in order to stand for election. The abortive attempt to start a reading-room has already been mentioned. The Soviet Consul's latest efforts have been directed towards capturing the school itself for Bolshevism. The acting schoolmaster, M. Waliullah Khan has been a supporter of the Russian cause for some time. Nor long ago Comrade Platte informed the Acting Governor casually at a call that he proposed to visit the school and present it with some furniture. The Acting Gover nor told him that he should first ask per mission to do so, but the Consul without further reference to the authorities went to the school on 16th Septeml e.’ by arrangement with M. Waliullah and pre sented the following articles among others : a globe, a counter (? abacus), a chart showing the evolution of the aeroplane up to date and a chart showing the various processes in the cultivation and manufacture of cotton. At the same time he delivered an address t(\ the boys through an interpreter in which he suggested their corresponding through him wit'n the pupbs of the high school at Polterask (Askabad). The Acting Governor has reported the incident to Tehran. 98. The following foreigners resident in Sistan are in regular communication with the Soviet Consulate : — Seth Fida Husain, brother of Seth Taiyab Ali, head of the notorious firm of Mohd. Ali Bros, and first cousin of Ghulam Abbas lately convicted in the “ Karachi Coining Case. 1 ’ (Cf. Diary for January, paragraph 7.) Tins person occupies large premises next to the British Consulate. Stepanian, Armenian clerk in charge ; of the Indo-European Telegraph Depart- | ment Office at Sistan, whose removal His Majesty’s Consul has been trying to I secure for nearly a year. Stepanian is heavily in debt and is assiduously drink ing himself to death, partly at any rate at Soviet expense. Needless to say, no telegrams of any importance, cypher or othenv;, e, have been despatched through him foi many months by this office. Loss of British Passports. 19. Three cases of loss of passports by British Indian holders since April last have been reported to the Government of India, and a separate reference has been made to His Majesty’s Legation and the Government of India on the subject of the probable connection between these losses and the Soviet organization w r hich is known to exist for the supply of forged and stolen passports to agents bound for foreign countries. In one of the cases the owner alleged that his premises, w hich are close to the Soviet Consulate, were burgled and the passport stolen, together with Krans CO in cash. In another case a motor driver stated that while he was resting at Shusp in the middle of the day a trunk containing his passport and other valuables w r as abstracted from his lorry in the street out ide. Only tw r o losses of passports had previously been reported during the five years which have clasped since the Ind'aa passport system wms appbed to this o .te, and this combined with the fact that HP, Majesty’s Consul General, Meshed has also reported the loss of three British Passports by their owners during the past summer, makes it at least probable that a “ Hidden Hand ” is at wmrk. 100. Reference paragraph 86. It has been ascertained that one of th.3 d i e s of the Sarkaniantz mail lorrie; on the Meshed-Duzdap road is a brother of Yarbekoff, the (Armenian) Attache at the Soviet Consulate. The contractor, at the instance no doubt of the C onsul, is endeavouring to get his contract extend ed to include Sistan. If he succeeds, he will find that he has bitten off more than he can chew 7 , for the “ road in Sistan is so bad that his Benz Lorries, at the pace they are usually driven, will be knocked to pieces in a very short time. Even on the comparatively good Duzdap- Meshed road he has having a great deal of trouble, owing entirely to the reckless manner in which the lorries are driven. 101. The following suspects are report ed from Duzdap :— Sarqol Mohammad Khan .—Arrived from Sistan 5th September. _ Put up at the house of a Persian prostitute named Zarin Taj, who herself came from Tehranl w ' u*i / ft ^ Sistan in the spring and practised there until July. Sarqol appears to be a dentist and is undoubtedly an agent of the Soviet Consul. He has been refused a visa for India. Andrei, George and Fezriec, Armenian clerks in the Customs office. These persons supply the Soviet Consul with news through Misak (paragraph 86 above), but are reported to be discontented owin» to having received no pay for five months° Kalbian, French subject.

Persian Military ^/airs.—Reference paragraph 73. Sarhang Mohammed Khan Nakhjawan proceeded to Khwash from Duzdap on 28th July, Between 11th and 22nd July 678 infantry and artillery with 4 guns left Duzdap for Mirjawa en route ' for Khwash. The troops marched fremi Mir jawa in two columns, 150 and 358 strom&gt;- on 22nd and 25th July respectively under the command of Sultan Sikandar Khan brother-in-law of the Brigade Command ant. 83. There is much dissatisfaction among the officers of the Brigade with Sarhang Mohammed Khan, who is accused of harsh ness and undue misappropriation of mili tary fundsi The morale of the troops generally is none too good, due to the pros pect of service in the hot and unhealthy climate of Persian Baluchistan ; 27 deser tions were reported between 15th and 29th July alone. 84. At the beginning of the month the Brigade Commandant formally summoned the following Sardars of Sistan to come to Duzdap and accompany him to Khwash :— Sardar Khudadad Khan Narui. Sardar Said Khan Brahui^ Sardar Juma Khan Brahui v Sardar Nazar Jan Brahui. Sardar Haidar All Khan Kurd.. The Sardars have however excused them selves and are not accompanying the Sarhang. It is universally expected in Sistan and the Sarhad that the Persian strategy will be to employ the tribesmen as “ shock troops ” in the struggle with Dost Mohammed Khan and keep the regulars in reserve. 85. Russian Affairs. —On 7th July 192$ a new Commercial Secretary named Zahskinsehioff (?) arrived, at the Soviet Consulate from Kabul. He is said to be a Kirghiz and is accompanied by his wife. 86. Reference paragraph 77. The Soviet Consul has been trying through his Legation to obtain permission to establish a printing press in Duzdap, but has hitherto not been successful. He has not yet given up the house rented by him in Duzdap. The institution of the new motor mail service between Meshed and Duzdap, run by the Armenian Sarkanientz (vide Meshed diary paragraph 98);, is a great triumph for the Russians. Sarkanientz ? 's drivers are mostly Russians or Turks and his Duz dap agent is the Armenian distiller Misak who is also the Soviet Consul’s agent.

One oi them told him that the Berberis in Sis tan had all formerly served the British rX er r Ill ?- n * : in the Hazara regiments or the Indian Army) and would do so again i necessary. This valuable piece of evi dence of British intrigue in South East Per sia will no doubt be duly reported to Moscow. Local Affairs. 88. Sistan. —The Governor of Sis tan „ Amir Samsam-ud-Dauleh, went on 3 months leave to Birjand on 10th July. I here has been considerable intriguing over the question of his locum tenons, con tradictory orders having been received from Tehran appointing (I) the Officer Commanding Troops (2) the new Rais-i- Nazmieh, a very junior officer, (3) the Gov ernor’s Secretary, Mirza Ali Khan. The dispute has not yet been settled. There would seem to be a certain lack of coordi nation between the different Departments ot the Central Government on the sub ject. 89. The Elections. —Reference para graph 80. Agha Sayid Ahmad came to Birjand and stayed for some weeks, but has now re turned without coming to any agreement with thg Shaukat-ul-Mulk and the other supporters of Misbah-us-Saltana’s candi dacy^ The Election Inspector from Teh ran, M. Fatimi, left recently for Sistan accompanied by Salman Khan Asadi, son of Misbah-us-Saltana. The result of the struggle between the ex-schoolmaster and his Soviet friends on one side and the Mis- bah with his Tehran backing on the other is awaited with interest. The recent de parture of Teymourtache on a visit to Europe is regarded as a favourable portent for Agha Saiyid Ahmad, who is also un doubtedly assisted very considerably by the unpopularity of Misbah-us-Saltana in Sistan, due to his failure during three suc cessive Parliaments to improve the lot of the Sistanis in any way whatsoever.

The contract for the supply of grain from Sistan to the troops at Duzdap has been given to Seth Fida Hussain, who is the Sistan representative of the notorious firm of Mohammed Ali Brothers and a near relative of Ghulam Abbas and other ac cused in the Karachi Coining Case. 74.

Such an occurrence would be very welcome to Dost Mohammed, the chief object of whose strategy at the moment is to induce the Persians to attack him at his own time— the hot weather—-as well as on his own ground. His Majesty’s Consul has reason to believe that the Persians do not propose \ to fall into this trap, and will not in any i circumstances advance before the autumn, i 75. Persian Officials. —The Passport Offices at Duzdap and Sistan have been abolished, and passports will in future be issued by the Police. 76. M. Abdul Hussain Khan Adib, com monly called Yaghma’i after his grand father, the well-known Radical poet of Biabanak, has been appointed Rais-i- Sulhiyeh (Civil Judge) of the Qainat, Sistan and Duzdap, with headquarters at Birjand. For some months he had been holding the post of Public Prosecutor at Birjand, in spite of the fact that there has been no court for him to prosecute in. M. Abdul Hussain Khan is an unusual type of Persian, having plenty of moral courage and a thoroughly independent point of view which makes him very unpopular in Birjand ; but in_ spite_of his hereditary leanings towards TTemocracy he appears to be a genuine Anglo-phile and goes out of his way to maintain the most cordial relations with Flis Majesty’s Consul. A separate report has been submitted on the state of affairs in this district con sequent on the abolition of “ capitula tions ”. paragraph 69. Small 11 lashkars ” of Dost Mohammed’s men—probably little' more than frontier detachments—continue to occupy the posts at Shurab, Jauri, Karvanda, Erindagan and Gusht along the southern border of the Sarhad. Pending the struggle which he now realizes to be inevitable, Dost Mohammad is doing his best to detach powerful Yarmohdzai (Damani) tribe from their flimsy allegiance^ to the Persians. To this end he is stirring up enmity between the Yar-mohdzai Sardar, Jiand, and Khan Sahib Idu Khan who is now de facto leader of the loyal Rekis. Vhen the Officer Commanding Sistan Brigade visited Khwash in May, Jiand com plained bitterly to him of the preference shown by the Persians to Idu and the Rekis. It is understood that Idu receives Rs. 500 personal pay from the Persians, in addition to the Reki tribal allowances, whereas Jiand draws Rs. 600 altogether for his tribe and himself. The Yarmohdzai Sardar is re- 77. Russian Affairs. —Reference para graph 66. The Soviet Vice Consul, Comrade Fuks, accompanied by the Armenian attache, Yarbekian, proceeded from Sistan to Duz dap on 10th June to vacate on the Consul’s behalf the house which had been engaged by the latter for the hot weather. Cer tain furniture and other belongings left in the house by the Consul were taken back to Sistan. Nothing has been heard as yet in Duzdap of the proposal, reported in paragraph 97 of Meshed Consular Diary for Jpne, to appoint Markoff from Meshed as Soviet Vice Consul at Duzdap. 78. Reference paragraph 68. Kousmin, Tounikoff and Shaibani of the Locust Research Commission returned to Meshed about 15th May.

There were said, to be tour camel-loads of rifles purchased iii Bampoic with the permission of Dost Mohammed who had received a bribe of 100 tomans and an embroidered waistcoat. The persons financing this transaction were Ayaz, an Afghan subject resident _ in Duzdap ; Shahabuddin, a British subject of Pislnn, now in Duzdap ; and Gul Mohammed, s|o Sher Mohammed, Baludi of Quetta, a nephew of Khan Sahib Shaikh 1. ainda Khan. Gul Mohammed went with the Kharoti's to Bampur and arranged the pur chase of the rifles. The above information:was - communicated to the Political Agent, Chagai, and the Frontier Assistant, Mirjawa by telegram the same day. LOCAL affairs; S 1ST ax.. 80. The Elections .—Reference paragraph: 70. The ex-schoolmaster Agha Sayid Ahmad, has been giving out that His Majesty’s Consul was responsible for the cancella tion by the Persian Government of the two pollings held up to date. The plot is alleged to have been hatched at an entirely imaginary meeting between His Majesty’s Consul, Misbah-us-Saltana and His Majesty’s Consul General, Meshed r during May. Steps have been taken to deny these statements and to emphasize the com plete neutrality of His Majesty’s Consu late in the election struggle. That the disgruntled schoolmaster should take British hostility for granted is indica tive of a guilty conscience. There is in fact no doubt whatever that he is being supported and probably financed by the Soviet Consulate, with which he has from the outset been closely connected. The Brigade Commandant recently informed a member of the British Consulate staff that Agha Sayid Ahmad tried to bribe him with Tomans 300 with a view to obtaining his support in the elections. As the Sayid is as poor as the proverbial church mouse, it is more than likely that this and other considerable sums known to have been spent by him in the campaign come- from the Russians, one of whose objects in coming to Sistan was to pose as the cham pion of the down-trodden cultivator against the officials and mustajirs (big land-holders).. The latest development is that the Misbah’s supporters, including the Inspec tor sent from Tehran to control the elec tions, have invited Agha Sayid Ahmad to come to Birjand and talk things over with them. This can only mean that he is to be bought off, possibly with promises of a seat for some other constituency. The Central Government have character istically in this matter. The 'supporters of Agha Sayid Ahmad caused numerous telegrams to be sent to Tehran express ing violent dissatisfaction with the sitting member, Misbah-us-Sultana, who was said to have done nothing whatever for the op pressed peasantry of Sistan during his longterm as “Vakil”'. The Central Government replied assuring the electors of Sistan that they were, at liberty to elect whom they liked. At the same time they telegraphed in code to the. Governor and the Brigade Commandant separately to the effect that as Misbah. was so unpopular,. Shaukat-ul-Mulk had been selected as deputy for Sistan, provided he was willing to stand ; in any case, Agha Sayid Ahmad was not to: be returned. This duplicity has become known to the ex-schoolmaster and his partisans, and we may expect bitter articles in the “ Tufan ” and the “ Habb ul-Matin ” on the subject in due course. Biejand. 81. Shaukatiya School .—His Majesty’s: Consul and the rest of the European com munity were invited to the annual prize giving of the Madrisa-i-Shaukatiya on 14th June. The prizes were given by Mrs. Skrine, and included one presented by His Majesty’s Consul for the best boy in: English. The Shaukatiya School at Birjand is one of the largest and probably the best-run of the schools of East Persia, thanks largely to the liberality and keen personal interest of its founder, Amir Mohammed Ibrahim Khan Alem (Shaukat-ul-Mulk). There are over 360 boys of all ages in the school, and there is also a small but flourishing girls’ school. Scouting is being introduced next season, an officer of the Tehran Boy Scouts having been deputed from the capital for the purpose. His Majesty’s Consul, at the re quest of the school authorities, is import ing 200 scouting poles from India, and has already assisted with literature and advice.

The New Judicial Regime .—The abolition of the so-called “ Capitulations ” was celebrated at Sistan, Duzdap and Bir- jand on the evening of 10th May. The day was regarded as a xrublic holiday and a few hundred krans were spent at each place on the hire of carpets and the provision of tea and sherbet at receptions held by the local Governors. At Birjand His Majes ty’s Consul and the rest of the small Euro pean community were invited ; the proceed ings consisted merely of some quite unobjec tionable speech-making by the Public Pro secutor, the Commissioner of Police and others, and there was no display whatever of anti-foreign feeling. The same applied to Sistan, while at Duzdap two most out spoken speeches were delivered by an Af ghan and a Berberi respectively. The pur port of these speeches was that coiiuption and injustice on the part of the Police and other departments, had been bad enough m the mast, and if such things were done m the green tree, what would be done m 'the dry ? 64. The process of whittling down the new judicial system began in tins almost before the ink was dry on the lanfi: Treaty and other agreements at lemam In the third week of May the pay °t tlm Small Cause Court Judgn (Suiffiyeh) atSn- tan was cut down trom Tomans 100 to lom- ans 60 (£13) per mensem, and ms mountea farrashes were abolished. Execuhon of hm decrees will in future be effected (it at all) through the Police. Birjand has been wit i- out a judge since March, while as for Duz dap, no attempt has been made h&gt; the sian Government to set up any kind of court there at all. “Capitulations” having been successfully “ abolished ” it seems, further efforts to establish an up-to-date but expensive judiciary are superfluous. 65 Commandeering of British lorries at Duzdap .—On 12th May, as a result of alarmist telegrams from Khwash, the Offi cer Commanding, Duzdap, commandeered six light lorries belonging to British sub jects and detained in barracks those of the Indian drivers he could lay hands on. Three of the lorries were released almost immediately. His Majesty’s Vice-Consul reported by telegram to Tehran where His Majesty’s ' Minister took the matter up stron°lv with the Persian Government but in the mean time the Brigade Co ^andant arrived from Sistan and released the three lorries and their drivers on the evening of 13th May.

Much amusement was caused by these post ers, which unfortunately were removed by request of the local authorities before the street-boys of Sistan had had time to illuminate them appropriately. Another i effort which has roused much mirth in mili tary circles is that of Fuks, the Vice-Consul, who asked the Commandant at Duzdap whether he could accompany the Persian troops on their campaign against Dost Mohammed, dressed as a Persian Officer ! Other half-hearted political activities in clude a proposal, not followed up, to start a reading-room in Sistan with a donation of Tomans 100 and two hundred books, and the distribution of leaflets and posters set ting forth the attractions of the Russian route to Mecca. 68. Birjand .—The following Russians (Soviet nationals) arrived in Biriand from Meshed on 24th May, ostensibly under orders from the Ministry of the Interior to carry on researches into the locust menace :— Kousmin (No. 77 on Meshed List), Tounikoff. Alexandroff. Mouris. 66. Russian Affairs .—Reference para graph 49. The Russian Consul has now given up the idea of going to Duzdap for part of the hot weather, and will stay in Sistan with his staff. Major Kharegat, I.M.S., Vice-Con sul and Medical Officer to His Majesty’s Consulate, pays frequent professional visits to the Soviet Consulate where he has been treating the wife of the Vice-Consul, Fuks, for dysentery. Besides paying private fees at full rates, the Soviet Consul has actually donated Tomans 20 to the British hospital, a fact which has created considerable im- pressiop. From all accounts, the Consul, Platte, appears to be an ineffective and colourless person, the rabid Bolshevik of the party being Fuks. 67. Soviet Propaganda .—Judging by their attempts at propaganda, the intellec tual level of the Soviet Consul and his staff is not high. According to the Brigade Commandant, Comrade Platte sent a con gratulatory telegram to Yavar Hussain Khan at Duzdap on Coronation Dav in which he indulged in abuse of the British. On May 10th the following posters were dis played at the gates of the Soviet Consulate, which opens on the central square of the town :— A Persian named Sahibani also belongs to the party. Kousmin and two of the othpr« went to Neh (110 miles S. S. W. of Birjand) on 26th May and returned on 30th on 26th May and returned on 30th. Sh lfT then they have been living at one of tk Birjand garages. Their expenses are ap parently being paid by the Persian Govern ment, but they are doing nothing whatever in the way of locust research, there being in fact no locusts in this neighbourhood for them to study. Their movements are being watched carefully by the Superintendent of Police who will inform His Majesty’s Con sul of anything suspicious. Local Affairs. 69. Nur/md—Early in the month the fol lowing points on the southern border of the Sarhad were occupied, under orders from Dost Mohammed Khan, by small lashUrs of Baluch :— Kuh-i-Safid, 50 miles E. S. E. of Khwash ^ by Nau- I sh rwan Gusht, 55 miles S. E. of Khwash, J Khan. Karvanda, 40 miles S. W. of Khwash, by Changez Khan. Jauri, 45 miles E. by S of Khwash, by Zaman Khan s/o X awab Khan Bameri. These movements caused a considerable flutter at Khwash, and the Officer Com manding, Yavar Hussain Khan Fatih, tele graphed to Duzdap for reinforcements. The Officer Commanding sent somewhat alarmist telegrams to Tehran and Sistan and commandeered 8 lorries, 6 of wdiich be longed to British subjects, for the trans port of men and guns to Khwash (see para graph 65 above). The Brigade Command ant came hurriedly from Sistan and motor ed to Khwash on 15th May. He returned to Duzdap on 23rd May and reported all quiet. Dost Mohammed’s movements were obviously merely a precautionary streng thening of his frontier posts in reply to the considerable increase in the strength of the Persian forces in Khwash. Conservative estimates of the various armed letkhkars, at Dost Mohammed’s dis posal indicate that his total strength is somewhere in the neighbourhood of 1,600 rifles. Separate reports have been submitted re garding the conversations which took place at Meshed during the last week of May between His Majesty’s Consul, the General Officer Commanding Eastern Army and His Majesty’s Consul General, Meshed, on the subject of the Sarhad situation and the forthcoming operations against Dost Mohammed. * 70.

He pulled wires at Meshed and Tehran and got the first proceedings annulled on the grounds of a technical irregularity in the conduct of the election. The voting was held a second time, and the Mudir polled even more votes. The proceedings were there fore again declared null and void, and the elections have been postponed pending the arrival of an Inspector from Meshed who will see that they are carried out properly and the right candidate elected. The schoolmaster, an intelligent but con ceited and over-talkative person of Demo- cratc leanings, has been on intimate terms with the Soviet Consulate ever since the opening of the latter last October, and there is little doubt that he would be a most un desirable person to have in the Majlis from the point of view of British interests in Sistan and the Sarhad. Needless to say, however, His Majesty’s Consulate has taken no part whatever in the election farce. The persons who hold the real power in Sistan have been left to look after their own interests, which happen to coincide with our own. C. P. SERINE, I.C.S., His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.

Movements of His Majesty’s Consul. 44. His Majesty’s Consul moved his headquarters from Sistan to Birjand for the summer on 22nd-24th April. Persian Military Affairs. 45. Movements of Troops .—Reference paragraph 37. The following further troops left Sistan for Duzdap on 16th-18th April:— Cavalry .. 1 Officer, 8 other ranks. Infantry.. 9 Officers, 80 other ranks. There now remain only the cavalry in Sistan. 46. The commandeering of camels, ponies and donkeys (including some of those belong ing to the Consulate dak sowars) described in paragraph 38 above was stopped by the Officer Commanding the Brigade, and His Majesty’s Consul has had no further cause of complaint. 47. The transfer of the Brigade from Sistan to Duzdap and Khwash is causing a certain amount of discontent among the troops, who have exaggerated ideas of the dangers and rigours of life in the Sarhad. There have been a few desertions, and a Naib (Lieutenant) of artillery named Khalil Khan who was sent in charge of the guns from Duzdap to Mirjawa shot himself in the left shoulder with a revolver. Whether it was a genuine attempt at suicide, or merely in order to avoid active service, is not known. The Naib gives out that he tried to kill himself because after a l^ong period of service on the frontier he had received no promotion and had been refused leave to go to Tehran. He is a relative of Shaukat-ul-Mulk, and it is said that the incident has caused much excitement among the Birjand and Qainat elements in the Brigade. 48. Coronation Celebrations. —The anni versary of the coronation of H. R. H. Reza Shah Pahlavi was celebrated in Sistan on 24th April. The Governor held an after noon reception, which was followed by a dinner given by the Officer Commanding the Brigade, Sarhang Mohd. Khan Nakh- jawan. At the latter function His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Major Kharegat, and the Indian Attache met the Soviet Consul and his'staff officially for the first time. Com rade Platte had intended to propose the MC108FD uf 1 health of the Shah, but His Majesty’s Vice Consul forestalled him with a short speech in Persian, to which the Brigade Command ant replied. Comrade Platte afterwards produced a lengthy oration in his own lan guage, in which after the usual diatribes against imperialism and capitalism he con gratulated Persia on having rid herself of the incumbus of foreign influence and politi cal pressure. The speech, as translated by the Armenian interpreter, created an un favourable impression. Russian Affairs. 49. On April 6th the Soviet Consul ac companied Madame Platte and the inter preter Yarbekian, went from Sistan to Duzdap and returned on the 18th. While at Duzdap they were put up by an Armenian distiller called Mishak. The Consul visited Duzdap again on 25th April, returning on the 29th. 50. The first of the above trips was un doubtedly connected with the two renegade Bolsheviks, Bajanoff and Maximoff (para graph 34) regarding whom separate reports have been submitted. His failure to pre vent the “ escape ” of these two men to British India will not, it is feared, improve Comrade Platte’s chances of promotion. The object of the Consul’s second visit was apparently to hire a house for the summer months, during which he proposes to reside at Duzdap. 51. Comrade Platte and his associates will be able to do a great deal more harm to British interests at Duzdap than in Sistan, and His Majesty’s Vice Consul and his staff will watch their movements carefully. Extracts from the Trade Assistant s reports on the Soviet Consul’s doings during his recent visits to Duzdap are a ppended hereto. 52. The following persons at Duzdap. among others, are active sympathizers with the Soviet cause :— (1) Misak, Armenian liquor distiller (see paragraph 49 above). (2) Agha Muhammad Effendi, an Osmani Turk who was at one time connected with the well- known Quetta firm of Rai Sahibs Jwala Singh and Mahan Singh, but is now working as a com mission agcttfr^'-Ono of his- soas...— | ENCLOSURE !N INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Letter No. ’4 ?

In addition, the Armenian clerks em ployed in the Customs offices are pro- Bolshevik to a man, and will doubtless be of c msiderable use to the Soviet Consul (whose o vn interpreter, Yarbekian, is an Armenian) when the latter takes up his residence at Duzdap. Afghan Affairs. 53. Arrivals from Chakansur report that a new Civil Governor of Farah has come to that place from Herat, accompanied by two Russian engineers engaged on telegraph construction. The Herat-Farah line is to be pushed on this summer to Kila Kang in Afghan-Sistan. Local Affairs. 54. Sistan. —It has been announced that the elections for the Majlis will commence on 12th May. Besides the sitting member, Misbah-us-Saltana, who is in Tehran arrang ing for “ re-election,” various local candi dates including the school-master (a Demo crat and pro-Russian), the late Finance Agent M. Abdul Hussain Khan Rahi, and a prominent mujtahid, Agha Sadir, are can vassing votes. The people of Sistan are thoroughly disappointed with Misbah-us- Sultana for having failed to secure for them a single one of the agrarian reforms for which they have been clamouring for years ; but his chances of “ re-election ” are not likely to be seriously affected thereby. 55. Sarhad .—Reference paragraph 28. Khan Sahib Idu Khan and eight or nine other Reki mu’tabars arrived in Sistan from Khwash on 18th. April and renewed their requests to the Officer Commanding Bri gade for military assistance against Naushir- wan with a view to the recovery of the stolen camels. Nothing was decided on this question, but the Khan Sahib succeeded in extracting another Tomans 3,000 from the officer Commanding on account of allowances before he left on 27th April. It will be interesting to see how much longer the Persians continue to subsidize the Baluch of the Sarhad as they have done for the last three years. The idea of pay ing money to, instead of taking it from, subject tribes is so foreign to Persian ideas, and the system of tribal responsibility adopted in the Sarhad is so contrary to Birjand ; The 12th May 1928. Persian policy in other parts of the country, that it is difficult to believe that the present state of affairs will last long. 56. Persian Baluchistan. —The following is the gist of a conversation between the Trade Assistant, Duzdap, and a confidential servant of Dost Muhammad Khan called Juma Khan who appeared in Duzdap on 28th April, apparently on a mission on behalf of his master to the Baluch of Sistan. • Juma Khan said that Dost Muhammad was fully informed of the movements of the Persian troops and was making preparations on a considerable scale to resist them, collecting rifles and ammunition from all quarters and issuing instructions to all the Baluch sardans and mu’tabars who are in his pay. He is full of confidence and his only ,fear is lest the British Government help the Persians, in which case he regards himself as lost. Asked why, if he intends to resist the Persians, Dost Muhammad does not keep on good terms with the Sarhad tribes, Juma Khan said that Dost Muhammad is not afraid of the latter because he knows that only the Rekis are on the Persian side, and that all the other tribes, Yarmohdzais, Gamshadazis, etc., will help him when the time comes. The Rekis, he said, promised Dost Muhammad Khan last summer that they would hand over Khwash to him, and it was for this reason that he came to Erinda- gan last summer (reference diary for Septem ber 1927, paragraph 62). They let Dost Mu hammad Khan down on that occasion, and he has not forgiven them. Hence his refusal to return the Rekis’ camels looted by his brother Naushirwan. 57. The Russians according to their wont are spreading it abroad that the British are supplying the tribes in Persian Baluchistan with rifles. There is little doubt that the Russians are in favour of the Persians under taking their long-delayed operations against Dost Muhammad. If the campaign is successful, Persian Baluchistan and a new section of the Indian frontier will become “ safe for Communism ” or at any rate for Soviet agents and propaganda. If the Persians fail with ignominy, as may easily happen in view of the climate and the nature of the country, the Russians will be able to ascribe this result to British intrigue and surreptitious assistance to the tribes, an explanation which will doubtless be readily accepted by Persian amour-propre.

Aaq The Soviet Consul, Sistan, arrived at Duzdap on the 6th April 1928 with his die and an Armenian clerk and is putting Jp in the agency of Mr. Misak, Armenian liquor maker. ******* In the afternoon almost all the Armenian clerks of the Persian Customs visited the Consul. In the evening the Consul and his clerk went in their car to see the Governor. As the latter was asleep they returned to the agency. Before going out the Consul and his wife were seen distributing krans to Persian boys and beggars. At night about 9 p.m. and again at 11 p.m. the Consul and his clerk with some papers went twice to see the Governor but as the latter was in house for dinner they could not see him. The Consul asked my informer, who is originally from Afghanistan, as to why the British are not on good terms with His Majesty the Amir Amanullah Khan. The informer replied that he does not know because, he said, that he has left Kabul, since long. On being asked, the Consul said that the Bolsheviks are on good terms with the Amir. My Persian informer reports that on the 8th April, about 9 a.m. the Soviet Consul went to see the Kais-i-Malieh where he stayed for about half an hour. The Consul then went to the Persian telegraph office and sent two telegrams, one to Sistan and the other to Meshed. Thence he went to the shop of Tayeb Ali of the firm of Mohammad Ah Bro thers where, it is said, that the Gonsu wanted to purchase motor tyres but^ Tayeb Ali told him that he should not visit his shop and that he would send his man i the Consul wanted anything. The Arme nian clerk went to the shop again at 2 p.m. but found closed. He then went to the shop of Narain Singh Akali but returne to the agency without purchasing any thing. On the same day the Soviet Consul visit ed the Rais-i-Gumrak at 10^30 a.m. and m the evening at 5 p.m., he visited the Gover nor where he stayed for about two hours. 145. On the 9th April 1928, the Gov ernor sent for all the Persian traders at his house at 4 p.m. to discuss the matter of purchasing Russian goods from the Soviet Consul who has decided with the former that he would sell them his goods at reduc ed prices for cash. Mehdi Urbab opposed the matter and therefore no final answer was given to the Soviet Consul. The Soviet Consul visited the Rais-i- Malieh as well as the Persian firm of Ah- media and Khalilzada. The Consul also visited the shop of Tayeb Ali on the morning of the 9th but did not stay there more than five minutes. ******** The Soviet Consul is said to have said that he will work both in Sistan and Duz dap. It is said that he intends to purchase a piece of land on which to build an office near the place where the new Customs is being built. The Soviet Consul did not go out of the agency on the 11th April. On the afternoon of the 12th April, the Soviet Consul went to see Yawar Hassan Khan, 0. C., Persian Military, Duzdap. The Governor also was present. They were all there till about 8 p.m. The Soviet Consul visited Sultan Moham- mad Hussain Khan oi the Persian Military, Duzdap, on the 13th April at 5 p ' M ' e Governor and Yawar Hussain Khan, Officer Commanding also went there.

Two mysterious Russians m a six- cylinder Buick driven by a third Russian arrived in Sistan early in the morning of 14th March and left on the morning of the 17th. They were almost certainly the same persons as Uksoff and Selinoff re ferred to in Meshed Intelligence Sum mary No. 32, dated 14th March 1928, but thev gave different names to the local police. During their stay they did not stir outside the precincts of the Soviet Consulate and spent the time in long dis cussions with M. Platte, who after their departure, according to a Persian official who saw him, was in a very despondent frame of mind. This, so far as it goes, supports the theory of the Military Attache, Meshed, that the hurried tour of these two persons was due to the failure of Comrade Platte to carry out instructions, and that the Soviet Government attach importance to his mission. 36. Since the departure of IJksoff and Selinoff there has certainly been a slight increase in Russian activities. Reports have been spread among the Baluch of the Afghan border that the British are about to attack Persia on account of her friend ship for Russia, and: that the Persian Gov ernment are strengthening their frontier defences on this account. Attempts are being made to organize Sistani merchants on the Central Asia system with a headman (corresponding to the “ Aqsaqal ” of Turkistan) who will stand up to the local officials. Tomans 10,000 has been received through the Imperial Bank of Persia from the Soviet Legation for the purpose of building and furnishing a new Consulate. M. Platte’s plans for the summer include conversion of the track between Sarbisha, his proposed summer headquarters and Duroh on the Afghan frontier into a motor- able road. This will enable him to keep in touch with his friend Ali Khan Barndin, a frontier bandit of some importance in the neighbourhood who is known to have visit ed the Soviet Consul in December and to have been connected with the Bandan Raid in December 24th, 1927 in which British property was looted and Russian left un touched. Persian Military Affairs. 37. The whole of the infantry and artil lery of the Sistan Brigade is being moved to Duzdap this spring, and the camelry irom Duzdap to Khwash. The following p £ 7 v ■! c r C and Kain, for the month of March 1928. troops have already left Sistan for Duzdap up to the time of writing :— Infantry.—128 rank and file—2 - machine guns. Artillery .—35 rank and file—2 moun tain guns. At the moment the following troops re- I T main in Sistan :— \ Cavalry .—100 rank and file. Infantry and artillery .—90 rank and file. rP - K V 4 Field guns. —4. The artillery and infantry will be moved to Duzdap as soon as transport is avail able. Meanwhile the camelry at Duzdap is being moved to Khwash.* 65 rank and file left Duzdap between 6th and 14th March, bringing the strength at that place to about 150. On 25th March there were only 25 camelry' left in Duzdap. It is expected that at least 250 men will be stationed at Khwash during the summer under the command of Yavar Hussain Khan Fatih— (see paragraph 26). Two Chevrolet lorries are being purchased for the Sarhad by the Brigade Commandant, one to be kept at Duzdap and the other at Khwash ; the latter will ply regularly between Khwash and Mirjawa and will take a maxi mum of four passengers at a time on pay ment. 38. The transfer of the Duzdap camelry to Khwash is due merely to the shortage ‘‘ of grazing round Duzdap, which necessi tates a move to the better watered slopes of the Kuh-i-Taftan. The strengthening of the Duzdap garrison at the expense of Sistan, however, may possibly have some military significance. It will be remem bered that the Brigade was only moved down from Birjand to Sistan in the cold weather of 1926-27, the selection of Sistan as headquarters being of the nature of an experiment. 39. There has been a good 1 deal of com mandeering of transport by troops on the road, several merchants complaining of camels carrying sugar and other trade goods to Sistan being requisitioned and the loads abandoned. Two camels belonging to the British Consulate postal couriers were also taken. His Majesty’s Consul has pro tested to the Brigade Commandant who professed ignorance of the commandeering and has ordered the animals to be returned and the ranks responsible to be punished. i «f { yGeneral condition of the country. 40. Outside the Army, which is more or less loyal, there is a general dislike of the present regime among the officials .and landholders of Sistan. There has, how- ever, been no agitation in sympathy with the Isfahan clericals ; the only political questions in which Sistan is interested are its own revenue problems and the vain struggle of the Musta’jirs for a more rational system of land tenure. Communications. 41. An appropriation of Tomans 1,000 per month* has been sanctioned for the continuance of the repairs carried out last year on the Hurmuk-Safidawa section of the Duzdap-Birjand road. No appropriation has yet been made for repairs to the Sistan road between the point where it takes qff the Duzdap-Meshed highway at Khaneh-i-Surkh and Sistan town, a distance of 82 miles. This sec tion has not been touched since the evacu ation of Sistan by the East Persia Cordon, and over most of it the average speed at which motors can travel is barely 10 miles an hour. Efforts are being made to induce the Persian authorities to remedy this state of affairs. The Governor of Sistan’s Cinema. 42. Reference paragraph 116 of 1927. Amir Samsam-ud-Daula’s dream has at last come true, and the Sistan Picture Palace has been functioning with regularity and success for nearly a month. By arrangements with His Majesty’s Consul, M. Pellier, the proprietor of the Empire Cinema and other theatres at Quetta, came in person to Sistan on 19th March with an excellent selection of films and gave the concern a good start. Since then he has been subletting films to the Governor from Quetta, and will continue to do so under an agreement signed at the Consulate until the middle of June, when the theatre will be closed for the hot weather. He has also sent one of his own operators for a month to instruct the Governor’s engineers. Prior to the arrival of this man, the illumi nation of the films was apt to be somewhat irregular, not so much because the Gover nor’s men did not know what to do, because they were inclined to watch the pictures when they ought to have been looking after the arc.

So far, the theatre has not been very well supported, the attendance most nights con sisting almost entirely of soldiers and school-children occupying the cheapest (1-kran) seats at half-price. In a district where ninety-five per cent, of the popula tion live on one kran (44J.) or less per diem, such an enterprise could hardly be expected to pay large dividends. It is hoped, however, that the Governor will not tire of his new toy so soon, for it certainly adds considerably to the scanty amenities of Sistan. Foreign Travellers. 43. The German youth Carl Doll, men tioned in Kerman diary paragraphs 235 and 264 of 1927 and paragraphs 22 and 45 of 1928, where he is described as having supported himself by immoral practices and by begging, arrived in Duzdap from Kerman on 3rd February and put up at the garage of Husain Ali. He appears to bo the illegitimate child of a German father and a Turkish mother in Constantinople. He came to Sistan in the company of a Yezdi on 12th March and is still here. He pretends to have been converted to Islam and calls himself Ghulam Mustafa. C. P. SKRINE, T.C.S., His Majesty’s Consul for Sistan and Kain.

His Majesty’s Consul lel't Sistan on 12th February for Delhi, but owing to severe breaching of the line between Nok Kundi and Ahmedwal on llth February was unable to leave Duzdap until the ISth. Of the next l7i days, 6 were spent on duty at Delhi, 1 at Sibi with the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, 3 at Quetta and 7J in the train. On the return journey His Majesty’s Consul spent two days at Duzdap and arrived back in Sistan on 9th March. 15. Captain L. K. Ledger, I.M.S., Medical Officer and Vice-Consul, left Sistan on the 16th February 1928 en route for England on leave. He has been relieved by Major R. M. Kharegat, I.M.S. Russian Affairs. 16. Reference paragraphs 7, 8. The Soviet Consul and his staff are finding time hanging very heavily on their hands. There are no Russian sub jects in this district and the only persons who visit the Soviet Consulate are the members of the “ Ittihadia Company”, two or three of the minor Persian officials and certain Indian residents whom the Soviet Consul fondly supposes to be dis loyal to the British Raj. The long- exp- cted consignments of Russian goods with which the shops of the Company are to be stocked show no signs of material izing ; they are now promised by the middle of May, but the Sistanis are becoming more and more sceptical. The doctor, too, has not yet arrived. M. Platte and his staff are thus obliged to while away the hours listening in on their wireless set, jolting slowly backwards and forwards along the 3J miles of unmetalled “ road ” which con stitutes Sistan’s only motor promenade, or studying the voluminous archives of the former Russian Consulate which they brought wuth them from Tehran. His Majesty’s Consul understands that.what M. Platte does not now know about con ditions in Sistan towards the end of the nineteenth century is not worth knowing. 17. The Consul’s efforts to acquire more up-to-date information, on the other hand, have not so far been very success ful. Difficulties are placed by the local authorities in the way of his touring among the villages, which he is very anxious to do, and the elaborate ques tionnaires addressed by him to the Finan cial Agent and the Governor have as yet produced no result. He gives out— possibly with truth—that he is writing a book on Sistan wit’ll the epigrammatic title of “ Sun and Water ”, and if he does not collect sufficient material it will not be for w^ant of trying. The following persons are actively engaged in commercial and political intelligence work for the Soviet Consul :— (1) Seth Taiyib Ali {vide paragraph 7 above). (2) Haji Ghulam Husain Sarbeshagi {vide diary for October 1927, paragraph 83)-. (3) (Duzdap) Khan Mohd. Samar- qandi and his relations at the Garage Hussain Aii.

(ii) To arrange for the submission of lists of arrivals and departures, with particulars of the busi ness of each traveller.

(vi) To submit lists of the employees of the Duzdap Vice-Consulate at Duzdap and at Mirjawa. 19. M. Platte has also written direct to Dost Muhammad Khan asking for infor mation on the following points presum ably for his book :— (a) Population of Persian Ba^chis- tan : (1) settled, (2) nomad. (b) Numbers of sheep, goats and came 1 s. (tf) Weight of annual wool clip. (d) To what countries the wool is exported. (e) What customs posts there are in Baluchistan. if) What revenue is paid by the Baluch to the Persian Govern ment. (g) What kinds of cloth the Baluch use. (h) Names of chiefs other than Dost Muhammad Khan. (i) What crops are grown and how much is produced. On the surface, the questions are harm less enough, and are well within the legitimate sphere of a Consul. But the very fact that the Soviet Consul is asking them direct from the formidable lord of Bampur, against whom operations o)ay be undertaken by the Persian Government any moment, is significant. Nor would it really be possible for Russia to trade with Persian Baluchistan except at a heavy loss. She can, and does, buy un limited quantities of wool in Khorasau at cheaper rates than those prevailing in the Sarhad, whence goods must be carried 700—900 miles by road to the nearest station on the Transcaspian Railway. Any trading activities actually engaged in by the Russians in Persian Baluchistan or the Sarhad will undoubtedly be merely a cloak for intrigue with the tribes with a view to accusing us of fomenting trouble for the Persian Government as we are supposed to do in Kurdistan.

The new Persian Consul for South- West, Afghanistan, M. Nasrulla Khan Samii, arrived in Sistan on 14th Pebruary and left for Afghan territory a few days later. He is to reside at Parah, not at Chakansur as at first stated. 22. A Persian Customs Inspector was detailed to Sistan by M. Moreau during the month to investigate a defalcation amounting to some Tomans 750 on the part of Said Ali, the recently appointed Customs officer for Sistan. 2 h of the General Officer Com manding, Eastern Army .—Reference paragraph 2 Amir-i-Lashkar Shahzada Amanulla Mirza went from Sistan to Duzdap on 12th Pebruary and proceeded to Mirjawa and Khwash on the 14th. Two nights were spent at Khwash where the General Officer Commanding held a Durbar attended by most of the Sarhad Sardars and their relations. He returned to Duzdap on 16th Pebruary and left for Meshed on the 18th. Among other measures, the General Officer Commanding arranged for the strengthen ing of the Mirjawa and Khwash garrisons and for the re-establishment of telephonic communication between Duzdap, Miriawa and Khwash. 24. Separate reports have been sub mitted regarding the Amir-i Lashkar’s hints to His Majesty’s Consul, of possible operations against Dost Muhammad Khan next autumn, and their connection with the question of the continuance of the Nushki-Duzdap Railway service. 25. movements of Troops .—A further movement of troops from Sistan to Duzdap took place at the end of the month, 100 infantry arriving at the latter place on 3rd March. The Mirjawa and Khwash3 spector jj| wo inj* ttl®:: ftOonil y app® )|cfr fi -Eefw irarrisons have also been strengthened, Ld consist now of 20 and 75 infantry respectively. The Mirjawa-Khwash road is Warded by about 200 levy camelry, '' ekis and Ismailzais. There are also about 70 camelry at Duzdap. Xt is understood that the remaining infantry in Sistan will be moved to the Sarbad during the hot weather, but that the artillery will remain here for reasons of economy, the price of fodder _ being about a third as much in Sistan as it is at Duzdap. 26. Reference paragraph 10. His Majesty’s Consul exchanged calls at Duzdap on 7th March with Sultan Hussain Khan Fatih, the new Comman dant. This officer, who ought ^ from his age and experience to hold a higher rank than Captain, is genuinely Anglophil and a man of considerable energy and force of character. He is an enthusiastic polo- player, having learnt the g ime from the late Major G. F. Farran, D.S.O., at Kerman where His Majesty’s Consul played with him regularly in 1928. Being art ex-S. P. R. officer, the Sultan is an object of jealousy and mistrust on the part of the Brigade Commandant at Sis tan, Sarhang Muhammad Khan Nakhja- wan, who is of the ex-Cossack Brigade faction of the Persian Army % d 0 Local Affairs. 27. Earthquake at Neh .—A severe earth quake took place in the Nehbandan dis trict on 8th March, about half the houses in the large village of Neh being damaged and four persons kiPed. Preliminary shocks were felt at about 3 p.m. and more severe ones during the night. Luckily most of the population were at prayer in the open when the damage was done, the occasion being the second “ Shah-i-Juma” in Ramazan when the graves of the dead are visited. 2S. Reference paragraph 9. K. S. Idn Khan has written several times to Dost Muhammad Khan of Barn- pur demanding the return of some or all of Mir Rashid Khan Raki’s 100 camels raided by Dost Muhammad’s brother Naushirwan from Isa Tahir, as well as °f the 7 camels taken from the young keki Sardar, Nasrulla Khan, but without result. According to Dost Muhammad, Nashirwan is determined to secure the release of bis four men who were arrested v tbe Mekran Levies last year and are now undergoing imprisonment at Quetta. At Dost Muhammad’s efforts to pacify his brother and induce him to return the Reki camels are unavailing. ^ 29. When the Amir-i-Lashkar visited Khwash 14th—16th February Idu asked him for permission to go with Sardar Juma Khan Ismailzai to Fahreh (Bam- pur) to see Dost Muhammad and negoti ate the return of the camels. The General Officer Commanding did not agree to this, but said that if the Rekis were prepared to fight for their camels, he would support them with a force of 200 regular infantry and a couple of machine guns. It may be taken for granted that Idu Khan is far too astute to fall in with obvious an example of the Persian policy of divid et impera. 30. Birjand .—A raid accompanied by revolting atrocities was carried out to wards the end of January by 18 Afghans on a Bahluri village near Duruh on the frontier east of Birjand. Two persons were killed and two girls kidnapped. A strong party of road guards under the Rais-i-Amniesh, Amir Khan, went out and returned on 13th February after recover ing some of the stolen sheep and goats and . . .so they said . . . inflicting summary pui ishment on the raiders. Three Afghan prisoners were brought back and are in prison at Birjand. Inquiries are being made as to whether the party crossed into Afghanistan or not. 31. The Municipalty of Birjand has been dissolved by its Piesident, Shaukat- ul-Mulk, owing to non payment of wages of its staff by the Finance Department. 32. Trans-Frontier .—Camelmen arriv ing at Duzdap at the beginning of the current month stated that their caravan of ab ut 400 camels carrying asafcetida from Herat to Nok Knndi on the Nushki- Duzdap Railway was robbed at Cha- zart (?) near the British frontier by a large gang of raiders including a numbor of Wazirs and Mahsuds from Kandahar province. Two camelmen were killed and all the camels taken. The name of the leader of the gang is given as Gurgan. It is more than probable that this occurrence is connected with the efforts of the Kandahar authorities to divert the trade of Southern Afghanistan from the Nushki-Duzdap Railway to the Kandahar- Chaman route, vide Political Agent Chagai’s diary for the fortnight ending 25th January 1928, paragraph 11 (extract attached for reference).4 V Travellers. 33. H. G. Zahn, a Dutchman of sus picious antecedents, who passed through Duzdap on his way from Meshed to Karachi last August, again arrived in Duzdap from Meshed on 31st January and left for Quetta on 4th February. The following report dated 8th February 1928 has been received from the Trade Assistant, Duzdap, about him :— “ He stated that he would stay for three days in Quetta and then leave for Cal cutta. After staying there for some time, he would go to Shanghai and thence to Java. He also expressed his intention of going to China. He told me that when he left here on the 31st August 1927, he went to Karachi and thence to Bombay. From Bombay he went on a steamer to Bushire and thence to Tehran via Is pahan. &lt;£ He told my informer that he was trying to find a capitalist to give him money for trade in Tashkent. “ When he left for Karachi in August 1927 he said that he was going there to settle his accounts with Muhammad Ali Brothers, but now, in conversation, he told me that he had settled his accounts with that firm in 1925. He talks in such a way that one would think him a very wealthy trader having business all over the world, whereas he has apparently done no business for a long time “ His past history as reported by the Bombay C. I. D. to C. I. D., Baluchistan, is as follows :— “ Mr. H. G. Zahn, a Dutchman, with his brother G. H. Zahn was in Shanghai in 1918. There they were on the staff of a local paper and were subse quently expelled from Shanghai on account of their being of Bolshevik views. They shifted to the Dutch East Indhs, hotbeds of German intrigues, during the Great War and of Bolshevik propaganda afterwards. “ Under the pretext of trade, H. G. Zahn came to Bombay with his wife. He had apparently no means of livelihood and was dependent mainly upon the income of his wife who visited the brothels”. “ Mr. H. G. Zahn visited Duzdap pro bably in November 1924 and put up with Muhammad Ali Brothers. While return ing to India, he came to the station just a few minutes before the train left and when particulars of his passport were being taken down, he said that he was r s freac a priest. . ; \J Jsr j^.j. “ Early in 1926, H. G. Zahn, with a boy named Casablanco, came to Duzdap [ from Karachi on his w r ay to Meshe/^™* There he is said to have dealt in furs on a small scale, but soon afterwards left for his native place via Tehran returning to Meshed by the same route in the begin ning of 1927- “ Mr. Zahn, according to his own story, was in Bussia when the Great War broke out and later went to China. ‘ c One day H. G. Zahn told me that he was well acquainted with the working system of the Russian secret service but that he was afraid to go there again be cause he was suspected by them of being a spy, but next day, in conversation, he said that he was very tired of business in Persia and that he wanted to trade in Russia because, he said, he could get good profits by trade with Russians. “The Secretary to theHon’bleA. G. G. in Baluchistan was^informed by the Vice- Consul of his departure. “ He was in possession of a passport No. 701796, dated 9th April 1924, issued at Arnhem by the Dutch Consul there and visaed by H. B. M.’s Consul, Tehran. He always obtains visas from Tehran because, he said, His Majesty’s Consul- General, Meshed, refuses to grant him a visa ”. Maxim ff and Bajanoff .—The following report, dated 7th March |1928, has been received from the Trade Assistant, Duzdap :— “ Two foreigners calling themselves Maxi noff and Bajanoff arrived at Duzdap during the last week in custody of a Persian Military guard who released ttem here. “They state that they are “White” Russians and that as they were afraid of the Bolsheviks, they left their homes with the intention of going to Europe via Persia and India. “ On arrival on the Persian frontier, they were arrested by the Persian officials w ho sent them to Meshed because they had no passports. From Meshed they w ere sent to Duzdap. “ The Rais-i-Nazmia, Duzdap, arrested them again on the grounds that their description tallied with certain foreigners wTio are wanted by the Meshed Police. “They are being kept in custody and instructions have been asked for from Meshed as to their disposal.“Maximoff knows only Russian while Bai'anoff speaks French, German and Russian. The Rais-i-Nazmia does not believe their statements and suspects hem of being German spies.” Sistan : 18th March 1928 It is probable that these persons are the same as those referred to in Meshed In telligence Summary No. 30, paragraph 1, and Meshed Consular Diary for January 1928, paragraph 1.

The Government of Afghanistan has recently been taking steps to consolidate its control of the tribes on the Helmand, west of Garmsel. This has given rise to considerable dissatisfaction, and it is stated that Sardar Atta Muhammed Khan, Siujerani, of Chahar Burjak, and Sardar Taj Muhammed Khan, Sinjerani, of Itudbar, who have hitherto controlled their tribes without interference f rom headquarters, have proceeded to Kandahar in this connection. The object of this consolidation is to break down the traffic from the Helmand towards the Nushki- Duzdap Railway and divert it to Kanda har. r lhe customs cordon referred to in paragraph 84 of diary for fortnight ending 25th November 1927 was one step in this direction.

The two latter officers took the train for Quetta on 4th January. Persian Officials. ' 2. Shahzada Amanulla Mirza, Amir-i- Lashkar (General Officer Commanding, Eastern Army) and Amir Mohd. Ibiahim Khan Alem (Shaukat-ul-Mulk) arrived from Birjand on 31st January. The usual difficulty about calls was foreseen and successfully evaded ; the Prince, whose acquaintance His Majesty’s Consul had fortunately made at Meshed in Sep tember, dined quietly at the Consulate the night after his arrival, and His Majesty’s Consul returned this “ call ” the following day. The ice thus broken (largely, it may be guessed, through the good offices of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk) a series of hurriedly-arranged gaieties fol lowed, the Amir-i-Lashkar and his staff mixing daily with the British colony on the most friendly terms. The festivities concluded on 6th Pebinary with a polo match between a team led by the Amir- i-Lashkar and one representing the British Consulate; a hotly-contested game ended in a draw 7 , three all, and interna tional complications were successfully avoided. Aecompaiied by the Brigade Commandant and the Pinancial Agent, the Amir-i-Lashkar left for Band-i- Kohak on 7th Pebruary, but he is ex pected back almost at once and will proceed to Duzdap and Khwash at the end of the w r eek. Amanulla Mirza is extremely vain, both of his personal appearance and of his prowess at games and field sports, but he is saved from fatuousness by a distinct sense of honour, and is undoubt edly both intelligent and energetic. 3. Shaukat-ul-Mulk returned to Bir jand on 5th Ptbruary. He is still offi ciating as Governor of the Qainat, as the substantive Governor , his nephew Hisam-ud-Daula, has unexpectedly pro longed his stay in Europe. 4. Adlieh .—Reference paragraph 108. M. Abdul Hussain Khan Kasravi arrived on 24th January 1928 to take up the post of Sulhiyeh Judge, Sistan Circle. His powers are limited to cases involving not more than Tomans 400, with appeal to the Bedayet Judge at Birjand. M. Kasravi is the brother of Dr. Mah mud Khan, the Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s family physician, and w r as Sulhiyeh Judge at Birjand w hen the courts w T ere closed last spring. Russian Affairs. 5 Reference paragraph 111. The lady w ho came with M. Platte on his return from Meshed was the (Arme nian) wife of his attache Jagarbekian. The Consul’s ow T n wdfe together with Mme. Puks, wdfe of the Vice-Consul, arrived to-day (8th Pebruary). 6. The Soviet Consul is keeping very quiet, and is not indulging in anti-British propaganda or other objectionable ac tivity. Neither the Brigade Command ant nor the Governor are on more than formal calling terms wuth him, but M. Abdul Hussain Khan Rahi, the Pinan cial Agent, an intriguer and busybody of the first water, visits the Soviet Con sulate frequently, and is giving M. Platte lessons in Prench. 7. Seth Taiyib Ali, head of the firm of Mohammed Ali Brothers, of unsavoury reputation and first cousin of Ghulam Abbas accused in the “ Karachi Coining Case ”, arrived in Sistan on a short visit on 28th January. The following evening after dark he went to the Soviet Con sulate and had an interview with the Consul, as a result of wffiich he took an oath on the Qur’an to serve the Soviet faithfully by every means in bis power. He has already returned to Karachi, but stated before leaving that as soon as his cousin w r as acquitted he would return with him to Persia and help to organize a motor courier and passenger service between the Soviet Consulates at Sistan, Meshed and Kerman. It was Taiyib Ali w ho went to Tehran last summer to enlist the aid of the Per sian Gove cousin a the defence of his the coining cdstyrupde ; cor /iwith His Majesty’s Minister’s despatch No. 27, dated 12th August 1927. He is a clever man and a valuable ally to the Soviet cause. His younger brother, Fida Hussain, is the Sistan representative of the firm and runs a steam-driven flour mill next door to the British Consulate. Soviet Propaganda. 8. The Police authorities at Birjand have received instructions from Meshed to look out for and confiscate any copies found of a Soviet pamphlet entitled “ Freedom in Persia Local Affairs. 9. Naushirwan Khan Baranzai, brother of Host Mohamed Khan, has again been on the war-path. On 4th January having cut the telegraph line between Nok Kundi and Ladgasht, he raided near Isa Tahir in the Mashkel district south of the railway and took 70 camels belonging to Mir Rashid Khan Reki. Shortly after wards he stole seven more camels near Panjgur, and then took his lashkar south of Hizzak and raided a caravan of dates coming from Bampur, killing two men and taking J2 camels with their loads. The stolen property is reported to be at Hizzak. The Reki tribe, both the Mash- kei section in British territory and the Lad is section in Persian, are highly indignant and talk of reprisals, His Majesty’s Consul asked the Amir-i- Lashkar during the latter’s visit to Sistan whether something could not be done to keep Naushirwan in order. The reply was that unless and until Host Mohamed is brought to heel, the Persian Govern ment are powerless. Huzdap. 10. Reference paragraph 88. The Amir-i-Lashkar informed His Majesty’s Consul that he had arranged at Tehran for the appointment of Yavar Hussain Khan Fateh as Officer Command ing, Huzdap and the Sarhad, vice Yavar Ibrahim Khan under suspension. This officer was a member of the South Persia Rifles at Kerman, where £His Majesty’s ConsufJ remembeijfej him well in 1917-8. He was a good officer, able and intelligent, butCHis Majesty’s ConsuCheard some years afterwards from an ^-British officer of the South Persia Rifles that when the latter corps was disbanded the Yavar was involved in an unsuccessful plot to seize the arms and ammunition of the Brigade and raise the standard of revolt in Kerman Province. This fact is known to the Brigade Com mandant, Sistan, who has confidential^ requested His Majesty’s Consul to keQ a watch on the Yavar w T hen he comes to Huzdap. The Commandant himself wanted to get a friend of his, Sultan Sikandar Khan from Kerman, for the post. So long as he does not get himself into trouble with his ow T n Government, the appointment of Hussain Khan is a good one from our point of view, as he is accustomed to working with British officers and wull probably be thoroughly friendly. The MAJLis-i-S hura. 11. The wmekly meetings of Committees of officials (Majlis-i-Shura) are a great feature of Persian local politics in these days. At Huzdap the Committee, under the chairmanship of the Governor, does little but discuss the contents of the Tehran papers and the Calcutta Habl-ul- Matin, and telegraph to Tehran such resolutions as the Governor thinks will be acceptable to the Shah and the Minister of Court. This is the sort of thing “ The members of the Majlis-i-Shura of Huzdap do not approve of the treaty betw een Iraq and Great Britain. They consider that Iraq has sold her liberty and her good name to the British. They admire the action of Rashid Ali Beg, Foreign Minister, and Yasin Pasha, Minister of Finance, w r ho, seeing that their country was being ruined by the treaty, resigned their port folios. Thanks to this treaty, relations between Persia and Iraq have become complicated and the Persian Government has been obliged to forbid Persians to visit Kerbala ”. 12. A development which may prove of some local importance is the estab lishment of an Islamic Association with the Financial Agent as President, the schoolmaster as Secretary and five origi nal members consisting of the local Mujtahid, a Customs clerk and three leading Persian merchants. The object of the Association is to discuss at weekly meetings all irregularities in religious*3 official and commercial matters and sub mit them to the Majlis-i-Shura for settle ment. ^ Travellers. 13. An Arab, who arrived at Duzdap from Meshed on 10th January, asked the Trade Assistant for a visa to India on Pilgrim Passport No. 2511-F. issued by the Collector of Karachi on 24th May 1926 to Saleh, son of Hussain. On being asked his name he said at first “ Abdullah ”, afterwards, “ Saleh ”. As his passport was not valid and there was doubt as to his identity, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul refused a visa. When the man heard this he lost his temper, tore up the passport and shouted “ I know these English people, they are always playing tricks. With our help, they occupied our country with all sorts of fair promises. Then they set up a nomi nally Arab Government, and put such tyrants on our backs that we cannot get rid of them. They spoiled our country and now they refuse to let us go our way The man is still in Duzdap and preaches occasionally in the mosques. His move ments are being watched. Sistan : 8th February 1928. C.

Two thousand families are from 3 is tan chiefly the Mian Kangi district on the Aignan tolxer, 1,360 from Afghanistan and 100 from the oarhad. Many more families are expected to migrate this season. The localities colonized include Harakhs, Bandi-Sultan Ilwatan, Turkoman Ailla, Baramali and Haleha. Enquiries from other sources substantiate the ex-Jemadar's statements. There i-s no doubt whatever that the movement, which threatens event ually to denude the already underpopulated Sis tan delta, is directly due to the Persian Government’s jross mismanagement of one of their richest districts. 'CONFIDENTIAL. Q » * i Hr Diary of His Majesty’s Consul, Sistan and Kain, for the month of December 1927. Movements op His Majesty’s Consular Officers. 105. His Majesty’s Consul proceeded to Quetta on 1st December 1927, and stayed from 4th to 8th December at the Resi dency as the guest of Lieut.-Colonel H. B. St. John, C.I.E., O.B.E., Six days were spent at Duzdap on the return journey, headquarters being reached on 16th December. 106. His Majesty’s Consul and party, consisting of Mrs. Skrine, Captain Macann (Vice-Consul, Duzdap), Captains Bruce and Aird Smith, Indian Army (from the Staff College, Quetta), and Mr. L. C. Payne, Imperial Bank of Persia, went into camp in the neighbourhood of Shah- risfan on 24th December, and returned to Sistan on the 29th. 107. New Years Day celebrations .— The usual morning reception was held at the Sistan Consulate on New Year’s Day. It was attended by all the Persian officials, including the Brigade Commandant, and by about 40 British subjects. A dinner party of 19 covers was given by His Majesty’s Consul the same evening. Persian Officials. l^.Adlieh .—Reference paragraph 93. A Head Clerk, M. Hassan Khan Hidayat, arrived for the Birjand Adlieh on 13th December, and the Court has now opened. There is no sign as yet of Courts opening at Duzdap or Sistan. 109. Amnieh .—Serious efforts are being made to extend and improve the road guards. Twenty new r recruits have been taken on at Birjand, and there is talk of levying a local rate of Krans 6 per men sem on the wealthier and Krans 3 per mensem on the poorer citizens for the maintenance of the force. (It may be remembered that in September last the entire remaining military garrison of Birjand w 7 as moved d&lt; ■ to Sistan for the sake of cheapness.) All local officers commanding detachm u -s of road guards have been ordered to 0 etail 8 or 9 men each to Meshed for training; three such details have been called for from Sistan district, one from Birjand and one from Duzdap. The heads of the Amnieh Department at Sistan and Birjand have both visited Meshed lately for instruc tions. 110. Public icorks .—Reference para graph 51. Mirza Abdur Razaq Khan, Engineer in charge of road construction in East Persia, visited Birjand from Meshed on 8th December. Considerable progress has been made with the repairing of the road between Duzdap and Birjand during the past season, though at an altogether disproportionate cost to the Persian Gov ernment, owing to lack of skill and experience on the part of all concerned. Although, as already reported, the attempts at repairs have partially spoiled certain sections of the old East Persia Cordon road near Birjand w r hich were in perfect order, the 200 miles between Duzdap and Shusp which w r ere in a very bad state have been greatly improved, and it is now* possible to cover the distance by car about 20 per cent, faster than six months asm. How lonsr the improve ments, w T hich are of the fair-weather type, w ill last, is another matter. Russian Affairs. 111. Reference paragraph 96. M. Platte spent a few r hours in Birjand on 5th December and had an interview with the Acting Governor, Amir Mohd. Ibrahim Khan Alam (Shaukat-ul-Mulk). He left the same evening for Meshed and returned to Sistan on 8th January, having been delayed on the way by bad w r eather. He brought with him the wnfe of the Vice-Consul, a Russian lady. 112. Reference paragraph 79. The Soviet Consul’s wireless receiving set has not been in use for some time, the Consul informing his visitors that he is awaiting certain parts without which the set does not function satisfactorily. 113. A separate report is being sub mitted to His Majesty’s Minister and the Government of India, regarding certain ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY'S Letter No. .9 M. Dated 2 FEB.1S28activities of the Soviet Consulate. Par ticulars of their much-advertised efforts to open up markets in Sistan and neigh bouring districts of Persia and Afghan istan will be found in this Consulate’s Commercial Diary for November-Decem- ber 1927. Local Affairs. Sistan. 114. Education of the Governor of Sistan’s sons. —Last November Amir Samsam-ud-Daula, hereditary Governor of Sistan, requested His Majesty’s Consul lor a letter of introduction to the Prin cipal of Aligarh Intermediate College for his two sons, Ismail Khan aged 19 and Ali Akbar Khan aged 12, whom he proposed to send t j India for education. It transpired that the elder boy had already spent a year and a half nt the English House, Aligarh College, in 1924- 25, but had derived little benefit there from save an imperfect knowledge of English acquired chiefly during the summer holidays at Naini Tal. His Majesty’s Consul therefore suggested that some place of education nearer home would be preferable to Aligarh, which is separated from Sistan by a five days’ journey by car and train, and it was eventually agreed that His Majesty’s Consul should take the boys wdth him to Quetta and arrange with the Education authorities for their tuition at the Sande- man High School. Thanks to the co operation of the Agent to the Governor- General and the Director of Education in Ealuchistan, the boys were installed in lodgings at Quetta, provided with a tutor in English for the Xmas holidays, and the younger one at any rate promised accommodation in the school boarding house for next term. 115. As one or other of the boys will presumably succeed his father as Gov ernor, if is as well not only that they should he educated in British India, but that while in India they should be seclud ed as far as possible from disturbing political influences. 116. The Governor s cinema. —For an uneducated Persian country squire of the old school, Samsam-ud-Daula is remark ably up-to-date. His steam power-plant and dynamos (British) supply the main streets of the town as well as the British Consulate and his own house with elec tricity, besides driving three flour-mills, a complete cotton-ginning plant and a \ X lathe. His pet dream, however, is a cinema-palace. The building, a solidly- constructed affair capable of holdino 1 about 200 people, is already completed, and the cinema machine and spectators’ seats are on their way from Bombay. The chief difficulty is films. As already reported (paragraph 78) the Bussian Consul is very anxious to provide the Governor with pictures, but the Anglophile Samsam- ud-Daula prefers to get his films from India if possible. Accordingly His Majesty’s Consul while at Quetta inter viewed M. Pellier, the lessee of all the chief picture-palaces of the station, and obtained terms for the sub-letting of films to the Governor at what appear very reasonable terms, considering the expense of transport and the time (4| days each way by pony-courier and train) wasted in transit. a,Ik coi \jiss nowr . Snssians 2 S K% U imnrs stolen goods wdll oe recovered sectior 117 Eaid on Sistan-Birjand road. Early on the morning of 24th December a party of Afghan bandits headed by one Bahim Khan (doubtless members of the gang referred to in paragraph 98) raided a caravan midway between haring and Bandan on the Sistan-Birjand road, and carried off carpets, cloth and tea belonging to three different British firms to the value of krans 22,000 (Bs. 6,100). The worst sufferers were the Standard Carpet Com pany, the Persian manager of which is Lieut.-Colonel V. B. Williams, D.S.O., late Indian Army; they lost Bs. 3,500 worth of carpets and saddle-bags. A large quantity of raw wool be'oncfing partly to the Bussian Consulate and partly to the Acting Governor of Birjand was left owing to its bulk. Two Amnieh men who were escorting the caravan ran aw r ay, and informed the next post, from which four other road guards joined them and followed the raiders exchanging shots at a safe distance as far as the frontier, which at this point is onlv 16 miles away. A party of 30 cavalry of the Sistan Bri gade went out the following day and reached the frontier on 27th December; they were able to do nothing as the raiders were encamped at Naso, about 15 miles on the Afghan side of the border. Toe Afghan Consul has so far shown no signs of co-operating, and His Majesty’s Consul has referred the matter to Tehran and Delhi with a request that the Kabul Government be moved to take action against the raiders. From all accounts, however, the Afghan 'writ hardly runs in a remote frontier district like Chakansur, and there is little hope that any of the im Tw -fell, chi !i the At an h iethis seas I include m Turkon dries fror i le ex-Jem: ismanage i districts.

Miyration of Sistanis to Russian Territory. —Reference paragraph 54. Ex-Jemadar Hayat Khan of Siadak in the Mian Kangi district, late of the Sistan Levy Corps, went to the Turkoman country rid Herat last year v A has now returned to fetch his family and as many of his neighbours as possible. He informed His Majesty’s Consul that the Russians give Baluch and Afghan immigrants land free of revenue and advance them money to purchase stock and seed. Everything is done to en courage immigration into ' Turkmen istan. On examination the ex-Jemadar gave the sectional names and headmen of 3,460 Baluch families belonging to 16 different sections who have settled in Turkmenistan during the last three or four years. Two thousand families are from Sistan, chiefly the Mian Kangi dis trict on the Afghan border, 1,360 from Afghanistan and 100 from the Sarhad. Many more families are expected to migrate this season. The localities colo nized include Sarakhs, Band-i-Sultan, Ilwatan, Turkoman Killa, Baramali and Kalcha. Enquiries from other sources substan tiate the ex-Jemadar’s statements. There is no doubt whatever that the movement, which threatens eventually to denude the already underpopulated Sistan delta, is directly due to the Persian Government’s gross mismanagement of one of their richest districts.

According to an (unconfirmed) report from Duzdap the Yavar has been dis charged for want of proof of the charges against him, and has been re appointed to the command of the troops in the Sarhad. He is said, however, to have refused the post on the grounds of enmity with Sarhang Muhammad Khan, Officer Commanding Sistan Brigade. 120. Customs Assault Case. —Reference paragraph 102. His 1 Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Duzdap, was surprised on 5th January 1928 to receive a letter from the Hirector of Customs, M. Moreau, communicating orders from the bead office at Tehran that the Indian driver, Hafiz Earid, should be fined Tomans 100 and deported at once from Duzdap. In view of the facts :— (1) that Earid was unaware of the rule against taking cars into the station enclosure, it having been agreed only the day before between His Majesty’s Vice Consul and the Director of Customs that such a rule was desirable ; (2) that according to the evidence of all the Indians present at the time, it was Inspector Ataullah who attacked Earid with an iron walking stick and inflicted wounds on his head which were certified afterwards by two Persian doctors ; (3) that Earid was not prosecuted by anyone, either before the Governor, or before the Director of Customs ; (4) that it was Earid who prosecut ed Ataullah in the Governor’s Court, and was’evidently found to have so strong a case that both M. Moreau and Ataullah tried to induce him to with draw it, and (5) that the Governor, after a detail ed inquiry, reported to the Ministry of the Interior that Ataullah was entirely in the wrong and should at least be deported from Duzdap. His Majesty’s Consul has instructed the Vice-Consul not to take any action on the Director’s request and has referred the whole case to His Majesty’s Legation. 121. Apart from^ the question of equity, that of jurisdiction as between the Governor and the Director of Customs will have to be settled. His Majesty’s Consul has been unable to find in the Persian Customs Regulations any authority for the exercise of jurisdiction by the Director of Customs at Duzdap. But the latter has from the outset openly exercised a kind of jurisdiction, holding proces-verbal, inflicting fines and even detaining in custody ottenders against the Customs Regulations. In the present case Article 120 is quoted by the Director. This is to the effect that anyone resisting or attacking a Customs employee in the exercise of his duties will be prosecuted conformement aux lois et eoutumes du pays ”. The law of the country-—what ever the custom at Duzdap may be—is4 that assaults and breaches of the peace in a public place are triable by the civil authorities. In the present case the civil authority^ that is to say the Governor, tries the case and finds the Customs ofiBcial guilty ; whereupon the Customs authorities try the case on their own account and record an opposite finding, which they expect His Majesty’s Vice- Consul to enforce. The situation is a Gilhertian one, but its humour is lost upon the Indian driver and his fellow nationals at Duzdap, among whom feeling against the Customs runs higher than ever. 122. The Customs at Duzdap are no less unpopular among their own com patriots than they are with Indians. The Governor is furious at the casual way in u hich his proceedings have been ignored, and several telegrams have also been sent to the Persian Government by Messrs. Shuraka and other traders complaining against the highhandedness and ineffi ciency of the Customs authorities. An article appeared in the Tehran paper “ Tufan ” on 22nd December in which the latter w r ere pilloried. It appears that this article was inspired by the leading Persian merchant of Duzdap, Arbab Mehdi. Sarhmx 123. An official of the Education Department, Nizam-us-Salam, left Duzdap for Khwash on 22nd December to found a school there for the Baluch.

Agha Mirza Hasan Khan Safai, Mnstashar-nl-MsCmalik, arrived in Birjand from Tehran to take up the post of Bais- i-Adlieh for the Qainat, Gunahad, Sistan and Duzdup districts. A subordinate official, named Abdul Hussain Khan, has been posted to Sistan but has not arrived yet. There will also be a court at Duzdap which wdll work under Birjand. The following extract from the Kerman diary for October relating to a member of the Birjand Adlieh staff is of interest:— “ Munshizadeh, a junior Mirza in the Malieh Department, has received orders to join the Adlieh in Birjand. He has no experience of Adlieh work and knows no law. He is a socialist and his appoint ment is said to he due to the influence of that party. His pay in the Malieh Department was 42 tomans. In the Adlieh it will be 230 tomans ”. Persian Officials. 96. Beference paragraph 77. Neither M. Platte (w ho has the personal rank of Consul-General) nor his staff appear to be concerning themselves with intrigue or propaganda to any great ex tent. Their w^ool-buying operations con tinue, but none of the large stocks of sugar, oil and Bussian manufactured goods promised by the Soviet Consul to an expectant public have as yet materialized. The only members of the official class wffio have so far shown signs of gravitat ing towards the Soviet fold are the Head master of the local school and the ex- Karguzar, M. Samii. The former dis plays the usual leanings towards the left of the Persian Education Department; while M. Samii, who is under orders of transfer to Kuchan, has not yet paid into the Governor’s office a sum of about 4,130 krans deposited with him for pay ment to decree-hob 1 ers in certain mixed cases, and is reported to be trying to borrow the amount from the Soviet Consul. 94. Delations wdth the Officer Com manding Brigade, Sarhang Muhammad Khan, continue to be most friendly. He has been two or three times to the Con sulate already, and His Majesty’s Consul has been able to be of service to him in various small wmys He is not at all of the intriguing, double-faced type (which is not unrepresented in other departments of Sistan officialdom), nor is he afflicted wdth the overweening vanity of his pre decessor.

The Soviet Consul left for Meshed on 2nd December, taking with him two local merchants, Mahmud Agha and Mohammad Hadi, whom he has induced to sample the stocks held by Bos transit wdth a view to importation into Sistan. 97. A German named S. E.

He was at one time in the employ of the Oriental Carpet Manufacturing Company, and w r orked for several years in a Bussian bank. His last employment in Meshed w r as as book keeper in the Soviet store “ Bustransit ”. He is marked as a Bed in the Meshed list and said to be of bad character. He is being kept under observation. j •••ur m I 'NO'* HJKUS'V Sc.CKi: VARY'S Letter No. 3 1 m. Dated 12 JAN. 1920 ReoeM 30 JAM. 1328Afghan Affaies. 98. An agent from Duruh on the Afghanistan'Qainat border east of Birjand reports that a brigand chief named Shah Muhammad, after severe fighting with Afghan road guards, has taken refuge in a hill fastness called Ghaur, or Tihun, on the road between Herat and Earah whence he is threatening caravans. 99. Two Bolsheviks with an escort of 7 Afghan soldiers arrived in Earah from Herat on 28th October on their way to Kabul. 100. Agha Abdur Eahman, General Officer Commanding Herat, arrived in Birjand from Meshed on 15th November, and left cext day far Kabul via India. 101. Agha Muhammad Khan, Afghan Consul in Sistan, arrived in Birjand from Sistan on 3rd November, and returned to Sistan on 23rd November. He exchanged visits with Doctor Abdur Bahim, the Acting British Vice-Consul. The object of his visit seems to have been to arrange for a residence in Birjand next hot weather. His journey to Birjand was performed in one of the Bussian Consul’s cars in company with the Soviet cotton expert, Michael Oritch, who was on his way to Meshed. Local Affairs. Duzdap. 102. Belations between the Indian merchants of Duzdap and the Persian Customs authorities continue to be strain ed. The fault seems to lie chiefly on the side of M. Moreau’s second-in-command, Inspector Attaullah Khan, and his sub ordinates who do everything they can to annoy the me r chants. Unintentional in fractions of obscure Customs regulations are punished with heavy fines, of which a substantial proportion goes by rule into the pockets of the subordinate Customs staff. Importers of goods from India are obliged to attend the Customs office on three or four different days in order to clear a single consignment, and are kept waiting for hours at a time while the clerks smoke cigarettes and twiddle their thumbs. (Ibis particular discourtesy is probably due to the system of payment of overtime pay to clerks for work done out of office hours.) Belations have been Sistan: The 20th December 1927. further embittered by a “ regrettable in cident ” which occurred recently. An Indian driver who drove his car into the station enclosure against a newly-issued order of the Customs was attacked by the Inspector with an iron walking-stick and severely knocked about. The Indian merchants have telegraphed more than once to the Persian Government complain ing against the Customs, and His Majesty’s Consul has decided to place the whole matter in the hands of the Lega tion. Considering that Persian revenues are benefitting to the extent of Krans 308,500. (Bupees 81,520) per mensem from the Customs and other duties collected at Duzdap, at the expense of the Indian ex chequer which loses Bs. 66,600 monthly on the working of the Nushki-Duzdap line, the attitude of the Customs authori ties is, to say the least, ungrateful. The whole trouble is really due to the in capacity of M. Moreau, the indolent and excitable Belgian Director, who speaks no Persian, does no work and is entirely in the hands of his subordinates. Sarhad. 103. Beference paragraph 90. Dost Muhammad Khan returned to Bampur from Dizzak about the middle of the month. He is reported to be im porting rifles in considerable numbers through the Mekran ports. Twelve of these changed hands at his meeting with Nawab Habibullah Khan reported in last month’s diary. 104. The meeting above referred to was probably arranged by Dost Muhammad with a view, among other things, to securing his retreat into British territory in case of defeat by the Persians. Hence the advice given by him to the Kharan Nawab, not to break altogether with the British authorities. There is no doubt that the erstwhile powerful Lord of Bampur is losing his influence and pres tige among the chiefs of Persian Baluchis tan, few, if any, of whom would march under his banner against a Persian invad ing force. The Mu’tabars of Bint and Lashar, Champ and Mashkhutan, Bazan and Irafshan are all reported to be hostile to him, in spite of his efforts to unite them against the Persians. C. P.

(Russian Jew). (3) Head of Wool Depart- (Armenian con- ment. vert to Islam] (4) Head of Sugar Depart- (Armenian). ment. No. 1 left on 1st November for Birjand in one of the Consulate cars, taking the Afghan Consul in Sistan with him, but the staff has since been strengthened by the arrival of a Vice-Consul from Tehran, whose name is reported as Alexander Eox I (? Euchs). There has been no Russian Consul here since September 1926 when M. Bravine, afterwards murdered at Ghazni, left Sistan. 78. M. Platte, who has brought the records of the old Russian Consulate with him from Tehran, has re-engaged many of the servants and agents formerly employed by the Tsarist Consul, and is spending considerable sums on the fur nishing and decoration of the buildings, which have been occupied since Septem ber 1926 by the Afghan Consulate. He has also brought, among other things, two motor cars, a powerful wireless receiving set and a number of cinema films. In the first he offers his Persian friends seats at nominal rates for Meshed and even Tehran; on the second he listens-in nightly to Moscow, assisted by the local schoolmaster, the &amp;r-Karguzar and other sympathizers ; the films he proposes to lend to the Governor of Sistan for exhibi tion in the picture-theatre which the latter intends to open shortly. 79. The energetic Consul is not having it all his own way, however. The “ roads ” of East Persia may be relied upon to make short work of his cheap cars; the Police have protested against his setting up a wireless set and have referred to Tehran for orders; while the Governor, wdio had already decided to purchase his cinema plant in India, has now agreed to obtain his films also through the British Consulate. 80. So far as can be judged at this stage, the Soviet Consul’s more overt ambitions include the following :— (1) To capture the market for the sale of piece-goods, sugar, oil, matches, and certain o her commodities. (2) To buy in advance most of next season’s wool clip in Sistan and the neighbouring districts of Afghanistan, and eventually to corner the wool market. (3) To finance the cultivation of cotton on a large scale for export to Russia. With a view to (1), he has induced a number of local merchants to form a syndicate for trade 'with Russia, pro mising them long-term credits on the joint security of the members. 81. As w r as to be expected, M.

The objects of the visit to Khwash were, (l y to enquire into the charges against xavar Ibrahim Khan of communicating with Bampur, and misappropriating the allowances of the Sarhad sardars and road guards, (2) to see for himself whether the situation in the Sarhad was as dangerous as the Yavar made out in his reports. As a result of the Sarhang’s investigations, the late Commandant at Duzdap has been relieved of his command and left for Meshed on 22nd October. 89. At Khwash Sarhang Mohd. Khan ieasted the sardars and notables of the Sarhad and at the same time treated them to some plain speaking on the subject of■ intriguing with Dost Muhammed Khan, with particular reference to Shahsowar’s recent visit to Erindagan.

A secret meeting took place on 17th October between Dost Muhammed Khan and Nawab Habibullah Khan of Kharan at Jalk, the former moving from Dizzak to Jalk for the interview, and the latter crossing the frontier by night from Ladgasht in Mashkel. The object of the meeting is not known, but it may be guessed that the Nawab of Kharan in voked the aid of Bampur in his dealings with the Kalat authorities. He is re building the old frontier fort of Chakol in Mashkel. Travellers. 91. Reference paragraph 73.

Arpad Ereundlich, Czechoslovakian, and Sandor Eorstner, Hungarian, globe trotters, arrived Duzdap from Tehran on the 16th October. The former wished to proceed to Bombay for medical attendance, the latter stated he was on his way to Japan. Orders were received from the Government of India that they should be granted visas on condition that they were in possession of sufficient funds to ensure their not being a burden in the State. As, therefore, they possessed only Tomans 12 between them, they were refused per mission to proceed to India. They now propose to go to Bandar Abbas, via Kerman, saying that they will telegraph to their homes for money to be sent to Bandar Abbas to meet them. Nothing is known against either, but they should not be given visas for India unless in posses sion of sufficient funds, and without previous reference to the Government of India. C. P.

Yavar Ibrahim Khan, Commanding Duzdap and the Sarhad, was summoned by the new Brigade Commandant to Sistan on 17th September, placed under open arrest and relieved of his post. The charges against him include embez zlement of sums amounting to Ts. 4,800 on account of pay of Baluch Sardars and Road Guards of the Sarhad. There is reason to believe, however, that he had been intriguing with Host Muhammad Khan of Bampur, whose appearance at Erindagan, 40 miles from Khowash, on 9 h September caused considerable excite ment in Persian circles. Ibrahim Khan visited Khwash without orders at the beginning of the month, and compro mising letters addressed to him by Dost Muhammad have been intercepted at Duzdap. He is alleged to have invited Dost Muhammad to occupy Khwash tem porarily, as in 1926—the idea presumably being to secure for himself the credit of inducing the lord of Bampur to evacuate | it again. A separate report is being sub mitted on the above and other Sarhad : affairs. On Yavar Ibrahim Khan’s recall Sultan Ali Asghar was sent from Sistan to in vestigate the charges against him in the Sarhad. Towards the close of the month the Brigade Commandant visited Duzdap in person accompanied by Yavar Lutfi Ali Khan Shuja’-i-Nizam, a former Com mandant at Duzdap who was shut by the Baluch in Khwash in the affair of 1925. It may be that this officer, in spite of his experiences in the Sarhad, hopes once again to be appointed to Duzdap. 63. The entire remaining garrison of Birjand, 120th Mounted Infantry, left for Sistan on 20th September. The Infantry Brigade having moved down last winter. Sistan is now, after Meshed, the chief military centre in East Persia. It is un necessary to look for any deep strategic significance in this change. Rood for men and animals costs, on an average, three times as much as Birjand as it does in Sistan. SISTAN. Karguzari. 64. Reference paragraph 27. Ad interim instructions have been re ceived by the Governor regarding the procedure to be adopted in dealing with cases in wRich foreign subjects are concerned. A resume of these instruc tions is being submitted separately to His Majesty’s Minister and the Govern ment of India. The Assistant Karguzar is working in the Governor’s office and a start has been made with the clearing cff of outstanding claims. Not much hope, however, is entertained of rapid progress; the tendency will certainly be to keep things pending until the appointment of a Rais-i-Adliyeh, if and when that event takes place. 65. A party of three Afghans from Ghazni, one Bismillah Khan and his two sons, engaged in smuggling 15 breech loading magazine rifles from Muscat into Afghanistan, were captured on 13th Sep tember by Persian road-guards between Girdi Chah and Hormuk on the Afghan border. On being interrogated, the men stated that they had left Afghanistan two years before and hsd been engaged in gun- running between Muscat and Bampur ever since. On the present occasion they landed at Minab and passed on the out skirts of Bampur to Kaleh-i-Bid (about 40 miles west of the Kuh-i-Taftan) and thence to Kundi Chah, 20 miles west of Kuh-i-Malik Siah. Here, not know ing the road, they engaged a guide, who was probably in the pay of the Road Guards. Instead of taking them by the ordinary gun-running route via Robat, he led them to Baluch Ab and thence to the dry bed of the She!a river near Nawar Chah, where he left them and informed the road guards at Girdi. The latter communicated with the larger post at Hormak and a combined par ty went out and captured jthe^^^mnnel^ 1 ■ a running fight whjch lasted 28 hofifs. N Utter Ontedl 2 4 ft?[ &lt;&lt;a.

With the approval of the Central Gov ernment, orders prohibiting the export of ghi (clarified butter) were issued on 21st September The exp rt by traders of ghi already in stock is, however, per mitted on license. The object of the prohibition is to reduce prices for the benefit of Nasratabad town, and it will hit Indian traders hard, as ghi is one of the few commodities which it pays to export from Sistan. It will probably hit the Persian cattle- owners, who form an important element in the population, still harder. But the gang of officials who sit in JSasratabad from year-end to year-end can hardly be expected to see beyond the ends of their noses, or to realize that by cutting off the market for local produce they curtail production and impoverish the district as a whole. Land Revenue and Taxation. 67. Reference paragraph 53. His Majesty's Consul had a long and interesting talk at Meshed with Mr. Loomis, the American Einancial Director, on the subject of the Sistan revenue sys tem. According to His Majesty’s Consul General, Meshed, Mr. Loomis has not in the past been at all communicative about his work and has shown sings of resent ing the interest taken by the British in the welfare of Sistan. The resignation of Dr. Millspaugh and the uncertainty of his own future have however, brought about a remarkable change in Mr. Loomis’s attitude. He not only unburd ened himself to His Majesty’s Consul at great length on the subject of Sistan, which he visited last winter, but pre sented him with specially-typed copy of his report on that district. 68. A copy of this report, with com ments, will be submitted to Government during the forthcoming cold weather, when His Majesty’s Consul has had an opportunity to study conditions on the spot. It may be mentioned, however, that Mr. Loomis has little use for the report compiled by his predecessors Major Hall in 1924 in virtual collaboration with Mr. B. J. Gould. He does not ascribe the present state of affairs in Sistan to the iniquitous system of short-term leases sold by the Revenue Department to the high est bidder. He regards the big lease holders (musta'-jirin) as the villains of the piece.^ There are only 140 lease-holders in aU Sistan, and the most important among them are members of the two or three leading families, including the Governor himself. According to Mr. Loomis, these big leaseholders cheat the Government with one hand and the cul tivators with the other; by dint elaborate intriguing they avoid the pa^ - ment of huge arears of revenue, at the same time grasping more than their fair share at the division of produce on the threshing-floor. If about a dozen of the more powerful leaseholders could be eliminated, he says, the Sistan revenue system could be put on a proper footing; then, and not till then, would it pay Government to undertake the big capital works which would double the cultivable area of Sistan, e.g., a permanent dam on the Heltnand at Band-i-Kuhak and a Canal draining the surplus waters of the Hamun into the Gaud-i-Zirreh via the Shela riverbed. It is permissible to guess that Mr.. Loomis, as a hundred-per-cent democratic American, is not altogether unprejudiced on the subject of old ruling families and of landed aristocracies in general. The picture of Sistan handed over to the tender mercies of a host of Revenue officials from Tehran or Meshed, without the counter vailing power and influence of the said ruling families to restrain them, is not one which appeals to the thoughtful observer. Duzdap. 69. M. Hunin, Inspector of Customs in South Persia, left Duzdap for his head quarters in the Persian Gulf on 14th September. 70. Persian Visa Arrangements .— Reference Legation Circular No. 40. As a result of the orders recently issued by the Central Government on the subject of Persian visas on the passports of foreigners entering Persia, the practice whereby the Customs authorities at Duzdap have in the past affixed visas to the passport of travellers who have come without them is to be discontinued. In consequence, a number of Indians bound for Meshed, who were unable to obtain visas at Karachi owing to the sudden resignation of the Persian Consul there, are reported to be held up at Quetta. Pending the result of a reference by His Majesty’s Consul to Tehran, arrangements have been made by His Majesty’s Vice Consul, Duzdap with the local authorities to visa the passports of these persons at the frontier as before.

B. Sheikh Faiz Mohammad of Meshed to Duzdap, over turned it at a point near Sihdeh about 36 miles north of Birjand. ^The man himself escaped injury, hut a Persian cleaner who was with him was rendered unconcious by the fall. Leaving the boy for dead, Sobha Bam ran away into the hills and solaced himself with opium which he obtained by begging from village to village. Finally, either intentionally or otherwise, he took an over dose and died at a village called Kkunik eight miles east of the road. As soon as he heard the news His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Birjand went to Sihdeh and brought in the cleaner, who was merely badly shaken and bruised and has since recovered. The Khunik man in whose house Sobha Bam died had also been brought into Birjand by the Persian police and the case is under investigation. Sobha Bam, who was recently in the service of His Majesty’s Consul-General, Meshed, but had to be dismissed for in competence, is reported to have been weak in the head. There are many such “ drivers *’ on the “ roads ” of East Persia, and until the Persian Government intro duces a proper system of licensing they will continue to be a danger to the public and a handicap to trade. 72. According to a Daruhi agent who is in touch with merchants of Farah, Afghanistan, the people of that district are discontented with what they regard as the subordination of the Herat authori ties to the Soviet Government, and in particular with the construction of a telegraph line through their country. The same agent mentions 14 Afghan frontier posts along the Qainat border east of Birjand, manned by detachments total ling 402 rifles. Few of these posts has it been possible to identify owing to the in completeness of the maps available. The Camp Birjand: The 11th October 1927. largest detachment, 100 strong, is at a place called Islam Killa, regarding the whereabouts of which further enquiries are being made. 73. Karl Wilhelm Hoferle, alias Budolf Hoferle, Austrian, regarding the grant of a visa to whom His Majesty’s Consul- General, Meshed has been in correspond ence with the Government of India, arrived in Birjand from Meshed on 16th September. He lived on the Soviet agent, Hoffmann (wrongly spelt Kaufmann in previous references), for some days and finally, w hen His Majesty’s Consul had gone to Meshed, applied to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul for a visa for India, which was refused. He left for Duzdap on 27th September arriving on the 30th and applied to His Majesty’s Vice-Consul there for a visa. This was refused and the matter referred to the Government of India. If the man is a Soviet agent, he is an extremely inefficient one. 74. Arpad Freundlich, Czechoslovakian, aged 21 and Sandor Forstner, Hungarian, aged 29, students of Ptfrague University, arrived at Birjand on 28th September. Freundlich, who spoke French and a little Persian, informed His Majesty’s Consul that he and his friend were doing a world tour, but had very little money and had to walk most of the way. Between Tehran and Birjand they walked about half the distance and obtained lifts on cars for the other half. Their passports were more or less in order, but their only visa after Persia was for Japan. They appeared to be quite harmless, and their conduct while at Birjand was in no way suspici ous. They left for Duzdap on 8th Octo ber by car, having begged the price of two seats from the Acting Governor, Shaukat- ul-Mulk. The question of the grant to them of visas for India has been referred to Simla. C. P. SKKINE, I.C.S., His Majesty's Consul for Sistan and Kain.

Movements of Bis Majesty's Consular Officers.— His Majesty’s Consul motored from Birjand to Duzdap on lst-3rd August and after a week’s halt proceeded to Sistan on 11th August, taking Captain Macann, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Duzdap, with him. Two days were spent at Sistan, and Birjand was reached by the direct route across the Hamun (which is now dry) on 15th August. On 24th August His Majesty’s Consul with Mrs. Skrine and Captain Macann pro ceeded on a week’s tour to Mud, Chinisht, Abi-tursh, Darmian and Furg among the hills to the east of Birjand. Captain Mac ann returned to Duzdap on 6th September. 37. Persian Officials. — Reference para graph 25. Mirza Mohammad Khan Hadi is not after all to leave Duzdap, the orders , for his transfer having been cancelled. He is a thoroughly untrustworthy though outwardly friendly person, and a syco phant of the first water. Duzdap would probably have been the better for a little new blood. 38. Reference paragragh 26. The Gov ernor of Sistan, Samsam-ud-Dowleh, spent the whole of August at Meshed. It is pro bable that his presence was required there in connection with the Revenue troubles in Sistan (see paragraph 53 below). His head clerk, Mirza Ali Khan, carried on the work of the office in his absence. 39. Sultan Kazim Mirza arrived in Bir jand from Meshed on 14th August and took over the post of Rais-i-Nazmieh, Birjand, which had been vacant for some time. He called on His Majesty’s Consul shortly after his arrival and appears to be an ex ceptionally friendly and pleasant person. 40. Persian Military .—Reference para graph 24. Naib Sarhang Mohammad Khan, the new Commandant, Sistan Brigade, visited Duzdap from Birjand between 10th and 15th August and proceeded thence to Sistan. There seems no doubt that he is a “ live wire ” and also that he is anxious to keep on good terms with the British. It remains to be seen, however, whether he will repeat the malpractices which caused his removal from Kerman. 41. Yawar Ibrahim Khan, Commandant, Duzdap Garrison, proceeded to Mirjawa by train on 27th August 1927. He intends to visit Khwash. 42. The garrison at Duzdap was paid 1 month’s pay on 9th August but are still o months in arrears. The new Brigade Commandant during his visit dismissed 20 sarbazes on the grounds that they were too old and addicted to opium-smoking. 43. Recruiting. —Reference paragraph 16. 50 more recruits left Birjand for Sistan by road on 1st September. Naib Sarhang Mohammad Khan, the new Brigade Com mandant, has approached the leading Sar- dars for recruits for the army, and has promised Sardar Khudad Khan Narui, who complained of the treatment already received by men he had sent, that he would see tha-t they were properly treated. Re cruiting parties have already been des patched to the Mian Kangi district in charge of Yawar Hasan Khan Maufi. 44. Desertions. — Three sarhazes who were on guard duty at the Imperial Bank, Duz dap, deserted on 24th August 1927. Alam Khan, a Baluchi cattle-owner of Shebak, Sistan, has been arrested by the military authorities on a charge of being implicated in the desertion of one of his following from the regular Camelry at Duzdap. The whole of his section, some 200 men, came in to Sistan in the hope of effecting his release, but were met with a very stern front by the military autho rities and escorted from the town. The followers of Alam Khan are now indulging in the usual empty threats of emigration to Afghanistan. 45. British Interests.—Motor Mail Service. —A motor mail service is at last to be instituted between Duzdap, Meshed and Tehran. The postal authorities at Meshed recently called for tenders, and that of Messrs. Sobhasingh Mota Singh has been accepted. The agreement has not been actually concluded yet, but it is hoped that the contract will be signed shortly. The head of the firm, Sardar Mota Singh, received the title of Sardar Sahib in the last King’s Birthday Honours List. Messrs. Sobhasingh Mota Singh are agents for the A. P. O. C. as well as for Morris, Chevrolet and Studebaker cars, and are therefore in a strong position. A twice-weekly serviceis to be maintained between Duzdap and Meshed in connection with the trains. The new service, when it is in being, will supply a long-felt want. At present the Persian post between Duzdap and Birjand travels via Sistan (380 miles) and takes nine days. The journey by car by the direct road (290 miles) takes two days, or about 25 hours running time. 46. British Motor Car Trade .—Reference paragraph 31. The Morris six-wheeled truck imported by His Majesty’s Consul is proving a great success. Carrying a load of 4,000 lbs.—half as much again as that carried by even the worst-overloaded Dodge or Chevrolet lorries—it covered the distance between Duzdap and Sistan in better time than most American vehicles, and the further journey from Sistan to Birjand (224 miles) was performed no less successfully. Only the last 100 miles of this track can be called a ‘ road the rest is cross-country going. The car’s six wdieels render it a most comfortable vehicle for passengers even on the worst surfaces, while its eight gears and exceptionally good “ lock ” enable it to be manoeuvred among boulders in narrow gorges, in and out of steep-sided ravines, etc., in a re markable manner. 47. Owing to the trade depression very few commercial vehicles are being sold in East Persia now, and those only the cheapest. The time is therefore a bad one for intro ducing even a comparatively cheap Eng lish truck like the Morris. Nevertheless, several possible purchasers have already seen and been greatly struck by the per formances of the six-wheeler and His Majesty’s Consul hopes that two or three orders, at any rate, will be booked before the end of the year. If so, the superior lasting qualities and the cheaper and more regular running of the English vehicle must surely in the long run convince Indian and Persian merchants alike that it is a better investment, in spite of its higher price, than its showy but shoddy American rivals. 48. Anti-British Propaganda .—The Per sian schoolmaster at Duzdap, Ibrahim Khan, returned from a visit to Meshed about the middle of the month. He ap pears to have come under Russian influence and he is spreading typical Bolshevik pro paganda reports against the British. It is also significant that he is recommending peoples to go to Polterask (Ashkabadj where he says a man can earn 30 krans (11 s.) daily. 49. Abolition of Capitulations .—Reference paragraph 27. The handing over of the appi in Bel tha records of the Karguzari at Sistan to th&lt;- Governor’s head clerk, Mirza Ali Khan (see paragraph 38 above) has been com pleted. The Karguzar has not yet, how ever, received orders to leave Sistan, he still performing the duties of PLs- ■ Telegr ams port Officer. This favours the theory that P® 3 were ’ ' he has applied for, and will probably get, Ito Tehran ^ the post of Adlieh Officer in Sistan. * Us have 50. Meanwhile, a telegram has been re ceived in the Governor’s office to the effect I that, pending receipt of new instructions ; which have been posted, outstanding claim pis at thal I and other cases against foreigners °are to be dealt with in the same manner as here tofore, and that the Governor should consult ^he Karguzar in all such cases. tis kind 51. Hoads. — Great damage is being done to the best sections of the Duzdap-Birjand road (constructed by the East Persia Cordon in 1918-19) by the so-called “re pairs and improvements ” being carried out by the Persian Authorities. Several parties are at work ; without exception, they are operating on the easiest and smoothest sections of the road, preferably near villa ges, and are leaving the bad parts (includ ing the appalling 72 miles between Hor- muk and Safidawa) severely alone. Their method is to shovel earth and stones to a depth of 1 foot on to the existing road- surface and leave it there, at the same time digging trenches on each side so as to pre vent cars escaping from the “ road ” on to the relatively smooth plain alongside. Where the old British road curved and twisted to ease the gradient, the road “ repairers ” have cut straight across country in ancient Roman fashion. This is in accordance with orders received from Tehran, the idei being presumably that the alignment of Persian roads should be in keeping with the stern, unswerving simpli city of the national character. jf Mamma and retain i .above). 53.

Duzdap .—A meeting attended by al most all the Parsian officials and a few of the merchants of Duzdap was held on 22nd August at the house of the Governor, and resolutions were passed—- (1) congratulating the Shah and the Mejlis on the non-renewal of Dr. Millspaugh’s contract; (2) thanking the Central Government for definitely arranging for the construction of the Muhammarah- Tehran railway, for which no foreign loan will be required “ as the taxes recovered on tea and sugar wilP suffice for the purpose ”; .&gt; can r 1 ‘le A- tr- Ei « S out ^ ut ak (24 j3 (3) approving the Government’s policy in engaging American, German, Belgian and Swiss engineers rather than British for the work. Telegrams conveying the above resolu tions were, of course, despatched at once to Tehran where no doubt flattering refer ences have been made in the Mejliss to the gallant stand made against foreign aggression by the Governor and other offi cials at that outpost of Persian empire, Duzdap. i This kind of (telegraph) wirepulling is typical of the methods by which local officials of Mohammad Khan Hadi’s kidney secure and retain their jobs (see paragraph 37 above). SlSTAN. * 53. Land Revenue and Taxation. —Refer ence paragraph 33. Haji Shaikh Reza, Mujtahid, and Mir Ghulam Kalantar pro ceeded to Meshed at the end of July to lay the case of the Sistan landholders before the Revenue authorities. No information has yet been received as to the trend of the discussions between the Financial Com missioners, the Governor of Sistan and the Sistan delegates, but H. M.’s Consul hopes to hear something about them during his proposed visit to Meshed in the current month. 54. As a result of offical oppression by the Revenue authorities, eighty families from the Mian Kangi district are reported to have migrated to Afghanistan en route for Russian territory. It is hoped that this may be the beginning of a general exodus from Sistan which will teach even the Per sian Government that they cannot squeeze their subjects indefinitely. 55. A deputation of leading landholders waited on the new Commandant, Naib Sarhang Mohammad Khan, shortly after his arrival in Sistan. They were sympatheti cally received and told to report to the Brigade Officer any cases of oppression by the Malieh Department. In view of the gallant Naib Sarhang’s own record at Ker man, it looks as if the Revenue autho rities have encountered a formidable rival. One thing is quite certain, and that is that Sistan cannot stand being “ milked ” by both the Army and the Revenue De partment. Either one or the other will have to go out of business. 56. Baluch Raiding. —It was reported from Lutak (24 miles south of Sistan town) at the end of the month that a party of Baluch under Khan Mohd. Yarmohdzai, a cousin of Sardar Jiand Khan, raided a small caravan at Tasuki, 10 miles from Girdi post on the Duzdap road, and secured loot consisting of 24 bales of cloth, 20 bags of loaf sugar and 650 krans in cash. Confirm ation is awaited. 57. Road Guards. —A reduction of the Road Guards between Birjand, Sistan and Duzdap has taken place. 40 men from these three sections under Sardar Lutf Ali Khan, son of Sardar Ali Khan of Daulatabad, have been transferred to the Mian Kangi district for the purpose of form- ing guards along the frontier at Khwaja Ahmad, Milak, Deh Dost Mohammad Khan, and Takht-i-Shah. 58. Prohibition of export of Ghi. —At a recent meeting of local officials it was decid ed to prohibit the export of Ghi from Sistan. As this is one of the chief commo dities exported at present from the province, the prohibition if enforced will be a further serious blow to British-Indian trade. In 1926-27, 148 tons of this commodity were exported to India, the majority from the Sistan area. These local committees have in former years prohibited the export of Ghi without reference to Tehran, but the orders have been cancelled on representation being made by the Consulate. The matter will be taken up once more if and when orders prohibiting export are published. Sarhad. 59. The usual rumours of military opera tions against Dost Mohammad Khan in the cold weather are again being heard. Yawar Ibrahim Khan, 0. C. Sarhad, has been in correspondence with headquarters at Meshed regarding :— (1) the attitude of the Sarhad tribes in case of such an operation ; (2) the posting of detachments, at Ladis, Siah Jangal and Sangun on the Mirjawa-Khwash road ; (3) a proposal, strongly deprecated by Yawar Ibrahim Khan, to apply conscription to the Sarhad. 60. The Persians have been talking about sending an expedition against Dost Moham mad Khan ever since 1922, and there is no particular reason to suppose that they mean business now. The rumours, which are meant for Dost Muhammad’s ears, are spread abroad by the Persians themselves in the i£ 0 ESBSBB 9 \ \ \ 4 hope that the lord ot Bampur will be fright ened into accepting their terms. These are :— (3) Revenue to be collected in kind from the Baluch by the Persian revenue authorities ; ^ (1) A Persian garrison- to occupy Fahreh, Dost Mohammad confining himself to Bampur; (4)&gt; Dost Mohammad Khan to b appointed Governor of Persia Baluchistan on a fixed salary.

Sarhang Aziz Ullah Khan left Birjand for Teheran on 22nd July 1927. He has been relieved by Naib Sarhang Mohamed Khan who has commanded the Kerman Brigade for the last five years. Naib Sarhang Mohamed Khan took the initiative in calling on H. M.’s Consul at Birjand on 28th July and showed great friendliness. He proposes to visit Duzdap about 10th August, and to take up his headquarters in Sistan in October. He is not at all enthusiastic about his appoint ment and hopes that he will not be kept in Sistan for more than six months. 25. Reference paragraph 19. M. Moha med Khan Hadi, Governor of Duzdap, is being relieved of his post. He is still waiting in Duzdap and gives out he has been posted to Kuchan. His relief has not yet been nominated. 26. Samsam-ud-Dauleh, Governor of Sis tan, left for Birjand and Meshed on 30th July, having been granted two months’ leave. His duties are being performed by his Head Clerk, Mirza Ali Khan. British Interests. 27. Abolition of “ Capitulations ”.—The Karguzar has received official intimation from Teheran that all Karguzaris are aboli shed and that political and confidential files are to be sent to Teheran. He has re ceived no orders as to how outstanding cases, or fresh cases are to be dealt with, and the Governor refuses to take them over unless authorised to do so. The Karguzar is under the impression that extra-territorial rights have already been abolished, and a copy of his official letter to this Consulate on the subject, which he says is the same as received by him from Teheran, is attached as an Appendix. The Karguzar himself is believed to be under orders to proceed to Teheran, but he is staying on in Sistan on one excuse after another and there may be some truth in the rumour that he has applied for the post of Rais-i-Adlieh, Sistan. 28. Similarly, the Karguzar of Duzdap has ceased to function. As the Governor of that place is also under orders of transfer (see paragraph 25 above) the Persian case work of the Duzdap Vice-Consulate is being carried on under difficulties. A re port has been received that an Adlieh official for Duzdap named Farooghi has arrived at Meshed on his way from Teheran. 29. Proposed Duzdap-Sistan Lig ht Rail- build a 2 gauge railway from Duzdap via Garageh to Sistan, which was the subject of prolonged correspondence between this Consulate, H. M. s Legation and the Persian Government in 1925 and 1926, has been dropped by the Persian Government. This fact, ^combined with the Revenue Depart ment’s reactionary policy as regards land tenure in Sistan, shows that the Persian Government has ceased to take any interest in that unfortunate province, and that the continued efforts made by Mr. B. J. Gould and Major G. T. Fisher since 1919 to in duce the Persian Government to develop Sistan and ameliorate the condition of the inhabitants have been altogether wasted. 30. Trade. —Reference paragraph 13. The trade depression continues. Imports from India in June totalled 9,324 Maunds Indian as against 12,675 Maunds Indian in June 1926. The decrease is due to the competition of Russian sugar and to the placing by the Soviet Government of an embargo on the import of green tea from Persia. Sugar to the amount of more than two thousand Indian Maunds has been dumped by the Russians in Birjand during July and is being sold at a heavy loss by the Russian Trade Agent, partly to undercut Indian importers and partly to pay for future importations of Persian cotton and wool. 31. Motor Car Trade. —The weak posi tion of British cars on the Indian market and the strength and persistence of the American tradition, carefully fostered by skilful publicity and somewhat unfair pro paganda, are commonplaces in India to-day, and H. M.’s Consul finds much the same conditions prevailing in East Persia. Every where the old parrot-cries are repeated about British cars being over-priced, under engined, weak-springed, too low in the clearance, liable to boil at the slightest pro vocation, and otherwise unsuitable for hot climates, bad roads and light purses. The successful adaptation of many British models to overseas conditions during the last two or three years, and their increasing cheapness (considering the quality of the materials and workmanship supplied), are ignored even by those who ought to know better. Year after year Dodges, Chev- rolets, Hupmobiles, Studebakers and the like are imported in relatively large num bers, and the fact that these cars seldom last more than a year and are continually requiring expensive repairs, replacements x ^ w r „ and e ven alterations is accepted with the way .—According to information teceivedc Nr (jbrjaidjtiqnaljalalism of the Orient. H. M.’s from His Majesty’s Legation the prqp,q^tp ( ^ E|r ^ot|sjaIisyqnviiLced from personal experience 1-1 Letter No. 0-7 M.that certain British makes, both of touring and of commercial cars, have only to be placed on the East Persian trade routes for their superiority to be demonstrated in the long run. It is safe to say that, ove? a period of years, the number of British cars required to carry the traffic would be half that of the American cars which now hold the market; and they would carry it far more efficiently and regularly. The introduction of British cars would therefore benefit not only the British motor trade but Indian trade generally, to say nothing of the East Persian public. With this object in view (since British representatives should prac tise what they preach) H. M.’s Consul has with the help of the Department of Overseas Trade imported a Morris six-wheeled truck, which has just arrived at Duzdap and is causing considerable excitement. He pro poses to travel in this truck from Duzdap to Sistan and thence to Birjand early m August, and (with the permission of Gov ernment) to visit both Meshed and Kerman during the coming autumn and winter. Local Affairs. Sistan. 32. Afghan affairs.—For some time past, apparently, the Afghan Consul has been issuing nationality certificates to Afghans residing m and around Sistan. The Gover nor, at the request of the late Karguzar, took up the question and pointed out that under the present treaty between Afghan istan and Persia, Afghan subjects residing in Persia were Persian subjects, and requested that the certificates be withdrawn. The Afghan Consul at first denied that any such certificates had been issued by him, but when shown one with his signature and seal, apologised and promised that all others that had been issued would be cancelled. 33. Land Revenue and Taxation. —De ference paragraph 17. It is reported that Camp Duzdap ; Dated the 8th August 1927. M'sbah-us- Saltaneh (Deputy for Sistan) has arrived in Meshed and has requested that the leading owners should meet him there and discuss their grievances. The land holders have decided to send the following:— (1) Haji Sheikh Reza Mujtahid. (2) Syed Husain Chillingi. (3) Mir Ghulam Kalantar. (4) Haji Amir Khan (brother of Sardar Khudadad Khan). Malik Mohamed Ali Khan was also nom inated, but declined to go stating that he had no one to look after his property. The date of the departure of the representatives has not yet been fixed. 34. Cattle Tax.—Reference paragraph 18- A. The Revenue authorities attempted early in the month to compromise with the cattle owners by offering thern a reduction in the proposed scale of taxation, but the owners have refused to accept any increase at all on the old scale, and more telegrams of protest have been sent to Teheran. At the end of the month a strong bazaar rumour gained currency to the effect that three revenue officials had been appointed from Teheran for the recovery of the new tax, with power to call on the military for assistance in case of need. In consequence, many of the cattleowners have returned to their homes thoroughly disgusted, and it is possible that some of them may now carry into effect their favourite threat to migrate to Afghanistan. 35. There is an acute shortage of water in Sistan owing to the low level of the^Hel- mand and the bad state of the Band-i-Kohak and distributaries. Forced labour has been at work for sometime repairing the Band and cleaning out the channels, but it is expected that the water famine will last at least a month. (Sd.)

During the last ten days they have increased their stocks as follows :— Petrol from 1,650 gallons to 4,000 gallons. Kerosene oil from 3,600 gallons to 4,600 gallons. Loaf sugar from 9,360 lbs. to 49,920 lbs. As regards oil products they are in sharp competition now with the A. P. O. C., who have sent 3,376 gallons of petrol to Birjand and are selling it at 8 Krs. per gallon, as against 10 Krs. charged by the Russians. The latter have accordingly lowered their price to 7*9 Krans. Locusts. 14. Reference Diary for April and May, paragraph 3. Unexpectedly, the locust menace has not spread in the Qainat. Considerable damage has been done in the extreme south of the district, but none worth speaking of elsewhere. Persian Military Affairs. 15. Sarhang Azizulla Khan, Commanding Sistan Brigade, came to Birjand with a small staff early in the month for a summer recess. It is confidently predicted in Sistan that he is to be relieved by Sarhang Habib- ulla Khan, his late 2nd-in-Command, who went to Tehran early in May for 3 months’ leave but has already returned to Meshed. It is well known that the Amir-i-Lashkar, Eastern Command, does not like Azizulla Khan and is anxious to get rid of him. The latter, however, has a high reputation (care fully fostered by himself) for piety, patrio tism and efficiency, and is believed to carry a certain amount of weight at Tehran. 16. A draft of 200 infantry recruits raised in the Qainat for the Sistan Brigade left Birjand for Sistan on 20th June under the command of Yawar Hassan Khan. Local Affairs. Sistan. 17. Land Revenue and TWata'cw.—Refer ence Diary for April and May, paragraph 7. The agitation against the new Revenue Contracts continues. The landholders, headed by S. Khudadad Khan Narui, Malik Mohammed Ali Khan and Mir Sher Kalan- tar, have been in communication with the Majlis Deputy for Sistan, Misbah es Sal- taneh, who has advised them not to sign the new contracts and to send to Tehran any documents they possess establishing their title to the Sistan lands as against the Crown. Certain Shahi Firmans and other documents have accordingly been sent, and the Deputy has telegraphed to the agita tors that the Majl^TTnid eYeB DrJMillspaugh, Ho. f-stfep Dated ftecc-V- 28JUL v 8 m. IS AUG 1927 0are now convinced that the land in Sistan rightfully belongs to them. As this finding would involve the abolition of the Sistan Khalisajat and an enormous loss to the State finances, the Deputy’s message would seem to be somewhat optimistic. Two Revenue officials, Majid us Sultan and Mirza Ibrahim Khan, arrived in Sistan from Meshed on 2nd June and at once began to take a strong line with the landholders. Guards were placed on the houses of the two chief Maliks in order to coerce them into signing the contracts ; but the attitude of the other landholders and cultivators be came so threatening that the guards were removed the following day. Efforts were made to organize a large-scale bast at the Consulate, but these were successfully frus trated by H. B. M.’s Vice-Consul and staff under telegraphic instructions from H. M.’s Consul. Majid us Sultan, the senior of the two Revenue officials, returned to Meshed about 20th June, and no further trouble is anticipated in the immediate future. 18. A similar agitation has been in pro gress against the following increased Cattle Tax rates which were promulgated early in May — Camels .. 10 krs. per head per annum. Cows, horses and mules .. 5 krs. Sheep and donkeys 1 kr. Goats • 75 cents. Some hundreds of cattle-owners are in Nasratabad and, like the land-holders, have with difficulty been dissuaded from taking bast in the Consulate. The situa tion is complicated by the fact that many of the agitators are ex-members of the Sistan Levy Corps. There is much talk of wholesale migration to Afghan territory on the part of both land holders and cattle-owners in order to escape the ever-increasing exactions of the Finance Department, and it is just possible that they may yet have recourse to what has been from time immemorial the one remedy of an oppressed Oriental peasantry. Duzdap. 19. H. B. M.’s Vice-Consul has been hav ing a certain amount of trouble with the Governor, Mirza Mohammad Khan Hadi, and the Rais-i-Nazmieh, who appear to have joined forces in several petty attempts to lC twist the lion’s tail ” during the past month. He is therefore trying the effect of a temporary cessation of social inter course with the Governor. Official Duzdap is rotten with corruption of all kinds ; the Health Officer and the Finance Agent ha|;e both recently been suspended, and cP^- plaints against the Governor and the Rais-i- Nazmieh are rife. Everybody seems to be intriguing against everybody else, and the atmosphere is far from healthy. One of the worst intriguers is Yawar Ibrahim Khan, 0. C. Serhad. 20. M. Hunin, Inspector of Southern Customs, arrived in Duzdap from the Per sian Gulf about 20th June. He informed H. M.’s Vice-Consul that he noticed at Kuh- i-Taftan station (a wayside platform im mediately to the east of Mirjawa and just inside British territory) a large quantity of goods being unloaded for Khwash and Bampur, obviously in order to evade the payment of duty. H. M.’s Vice-Consul has been in telegra phic communication with H. M.’s Minister regarding M. Hunin’s somewhat arbitrary action in holding up an entire waggon-load of goods which had been sealed by the Railway authorities and attached to a train about to start for Quetta, in order to counter -verify certain bales of carpets under export by the Standard Carpet Co. which had already been certified free of aniline by the Duzdap Customs Office. 21. Orders have been received from Meshed that all motors leaving Duzdap with passengers are to be inspected, and a British subject named Mohammed Ali has been appointed to perform this duty at a salary of Ts. 30 per month. The fee charged for this inspection is Krs. 5 at Meshed and Tehran, but at Duzdap they charge Krs. 10 on the grounds that the yield would not otherwise be sufficient to pay for the Inspector. Sarhad. 22. Reference Diary for April and May, paragraph 4. A sum of no less than Ts. 20,000 (Rs. 53,333) has been allocated from the Customs revenue as a loan to the Sarhad tribes. Yawar Ibrahim Khan has been negotiating with Sardar Taj Mohammed Khan and K. S. Idu Khan Rekis with regard to the payment of this money, for which he wants the Reki Sardars to stand as sureties. This, naturally, they refuse to do on behalf of the turbulent Yarmuhammadzais and Gamshadzais, and it is doubtful whether the loan will ever be effected. Dost Moham med Khan of Bampur is strongly against iton the grounds that the Sarhad Sardars, who receive allowances and pay no land revenue or cattle-tax, are already spoiled .enough, and will only spend the money on ^Vnuggled rifles. Biejand , The 8th July 1927. Birjand. 23. A notice was posted on 20th June by the Acting Governor to the effect that under orders from Tehran all Deputy Governors were to be dismissed and their places taken by headmen elected by groups of villages.

Skrine, I.C.S., arrived at Duzdap on 8tli April and took over charge of the Consulate by telegram from Major Fisher on the 11th. He proceeded to Sistan by car on 16th April, and from Sistan to Bin and on 11th May, arriving 13 th May. General conditions of country. Trade. 2. Persian and Indian merchants alike complain of an almost complete stagnation of business, which may be ascribed to three main causes: (1) Persian Customs exactions at Duz dap, including the new Road tax ; (2) High railway freights on the N. W. R.; (3) Russian competition, favoured by preferential tariffs and aggravated in its effects by the undercutting tactics of the Soviet trade organi zations. There is little hope of any improvement in respect of (1), but the outlook as regards (2) and (3) is more promising than it has been for some time. As a result of representa tions made at a meeting at Duzdap by H. M.’s Vice-Consul and certain Indian merchants, Mr. Brocken, District Traffic Superintendent, Quetta, promised to recom mend a considerable reduction in freights on the Ahmedwal-Duzdap section of the line. As regards (3), the reports of strained relations between the Persian and the Soviet Governments and of the possibility of a closing of the Northern frontiers against Russian trade are causing great jubilation among the Indian merchants. Locusts, 3. Locusts have already laid waste the Sarhad, and are pushing northwards in ever- increasing masses. The desert from Narma- shir to the southern districts of Kainat is reported to be crawling with “ hoppers,” which are present in incredible numbers within 25 miles of Birjand. The local authorities have turned out the villagers and strenuous efforts are being made to destroy as many locusts as possible in the hopping stage, but the results are a mere drop in the bucket, and Kainat will be lucky if it escapes a serious famine. Apart from tie locusts, the year promises to be a bad one owing to the great shortage of water in the springs and qanats, the past winter having been the driest for many years. Sistan has escaped the plague to a large extent, as the crops are already in, and there is little else in an almost treeless country for the locusts to eat. Nevertheless the Re venue authorities have offered the people 1,000 kharwars of wheat in rewards for the collection of locust eggs at the rate of 6j lbs. per 20 seers. Local Affairs. Sarhad. 4. Yavar Ibrahim Khan continues to have trouble with the Sardars, who periodi cally complain against him to Tehran or Meshed. Matters have been temporarily smoothed over by the payment to them of their allowance in full up to 31st May. The Reki Sardars came into Duzdap about 22nd May to petition the Persian authorities for famine relief, on account of the damage done by locusts. In an interview on 23rd May with H. M.’s Vice-Consul, Khan Sahib Idu Khan hinted that failing relief from the Persian Government, the tribes would be obliged either to migrate to Afghanistan or recommence raiding. Judging by the continuous raiding by Bameris and Sabikis on the Keimin-Bam road during April and May, some of the tribes have already adopted the latter alternative. 5. Dost Mohammad Khan of Bampur is reported to be in communication with those ancient enemies, the Zargham us Saltana of Rudbar and Mir Barkat Khan of Sib, with a view to concerted action vis-a- vis the Persians. He proposes, on the other hand, to send a representative to Tehran in the shape of Mirza Shahab Khan Kermani, his nominee for the Mejliss. This annoys Yavar Ibrahim Khan, who thinks that Eastern Command ought to have the nomination of the M. P. for Persian Balu chistan. Dost Mohammad Khan seems to be pursuing his favourite tactics of playing off Kerman against Meshed. 6. For some time past the Duzdap police have been trying to enforce the use by Indian shopkeepers of Persian weights and measures instead of the Indian ones which have been in use up till mtHV. In vig^ ^; I2 the traditional conservatism of the Indian merchants, a certain amount of opposition was only to be expected, but the shopkeepers are now prepared to meet the wishes of the local authorities if and when they are supplied with official stamped weights and measures. The Superintendent of Police states that these are being procured, and in the mean time he agrees to the use of British weights and measures so long as transactions are carried out in the Persian corresponding Persian ones. SlSTAN. Land Revenue and Taxation. 7. Sistan affords an almost unique ex ample of all that a land revenue system should not be. The land belongs entirely to the Crown and is farmed out by the Revenue authorities on short-term contracts. As each “ lease ” falls in, it is either renewed with the same lessee at the highest figure that can be extracted from him, or sold to the highest bidder. The system effectively discourage improvements and puts a premi um on short-sighted and wasteful husbandry, thus keeping the population in the lowest stage of social evolution. In the cold weather of 1923-24 Major Hall, of the American Finance Commission, paid a visit to Sistan and toured extensively with the Consul, Mr. Gould, wh &gt; placed his own thorough know’e Ige of local conditions at Major Hall’s disposal. Great hopes were raised by this visit among the people of Sistan, and it has been confidently expected ever since that Major Hall's report, which is known to have contained recommendations for sweeping reforms, would bear fruit in the institution of a more equitable revenue system. The long-awaited orders from Tehran were received early in May. Instead of improving matters they have merely ag gravated the evils of the existing system, the chief innovation being an increase of the State demand from the traditional l-3rd of the produce to 2-5ths. Needless to say the effect was most disheartening to lease holders and_ cultivators alike, and the usual telegrams were sent in large numbers to Tehran and Meshed. As the Revenue authorities were unable to obtain the signature of any leases at all on the new terms, they have postponed the introduction of the 2-5th demand and have substituted a “ Survey Tax,” particulars of which are not yet available. The majority of the lease holders have expressed their willingness to sign contracts for this year under the old system with the addition of the survey tax, Birjand, the 4th June 1927. provided that S. Khudadad Khan Narui does so. This influential Baluch Sardar, who has always been at loggerheads ^yith the Revenue Department, has so far ref^d to accept any change. &amp; Small-pox. 8. Early in May a small-pox patient es caped from the Consulate hospital and could not be traced in the town. It was feared that an epidemic would result, and there was a rush to the Consulate for vaccination. The ^Vice-Consul, Captain L. K. Ledger, I.M.S., vaccinated, 1,482 persons during the fortnight ending 23rd May 1927 and had to turn away many hundreds more owing to the exhaustion of the supply of lymph. There have been no signs of the disease spreading as yet. Birjand. 9. The following officials and others are in residence at Birjand : Acting Governor of Kainat; Sarkar Amir Mohd.
