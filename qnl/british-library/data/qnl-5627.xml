CONFIDENTIAL. / y 2 Extract from Report of Proceedings of the Senior Naval Officer and Ships of the Persian Gulf Division for the month of August 1934. 7. HENJAM . On 18th August, the Clerk-in-Charge reported by signal that the Deputy Governor desired to register all boats at Henjam including Admiralty ard Royal Indian Marine Whalers and steamboats. He was instructed to inform the Deputy Governor that registration laws did not affect Service boats, but that the Senior Naval Officer would be pleased to discuss the question with him on board SHOREHAM on latter f s return to Henjam. 8. Needless to say the Deputy Governor did not call, but told Clerk-in-Charge that he had applied to Tehran for instructions. 9. The subject was mentioned to Commander Bayendor at Tunb Island at the end of the month but he replied evasively. 10. The Honourable the Political Resident was informed of the action taken.smm ^ ^ to the mlcMie of the month under r^pSFITtlSTSiSflSn under which the Deputy u over nor had apparently bean chafing beeame too smioh for him, and he threatened to arrest feltoa umleaa the lUI.M* boats war© numbered* BIBSPCtID* who was in harbour, found on enquiry that the Deputy Governor was not going to a^-ait the result of dlpl^mtlo action to 'fehran, and, hav tog had hi a Instructions conf inned by letter, Insisted that either (a) the boats be mtobered, Cb) they Met not be used, Co) they mnt be taken a^ay* 2t CWera were given that the boats were to be used as required, but on senior M&amp;val Officer^ arrival on 20th Doceiyber It was found that the Deputy Governor fully intended. In the face or all arguments to the contrary, to adhere to the above quoted alternatives# On the conclusion of the interview, the staff officer discovered that a number of the police force (five men) were waiting on the pier to prevent the E*l«N» steamboat from running# 3* fhe latter, which was towing store lighters astern, was ordered to slip them well clear of the pier, and was subsequently moored alongside a sloop at nights* 4* A further complication occurred two days later whan information was received that the Deputy Governor intended to hale felles before a Court of Enquiry* Fortunately fellea showed symptoms of malaria, and was at once put sick* fh© malaria did actually develop, fellea was visited daily by a doctor from a sloop, and was not subjected to any Persian inquisition* 5# Iteenwhile H.ii's minister at Tehran was able to obtain an assurance from the Persian Government that ?£# tak f§ the new year, and that instructiomi this effect had been sent to the Deputy - Governor. The latter subsequently informed BMMFQftD %m% mm boat a might run until he received further written instructions from Tehran. &amp; * it is understood that dlplocmtlc discussions will continue early in January, the Persian view being that boat and car registration are very similar. The Admiralty and Foreign Office favour settlement being reached at Tehran and are prepared to sanction the boats wearing English numbers, i.e. E*1*H. 2 etc#, if absolutely no c® scary • 7* Kidlculous though it imj seem, the local effect is that the prestige of Mr # Tellee, the Olcrk-to-oharg®, which had received a setback and been at rather a low ebb since he was prevented from embarking the old guns for use as moor togs, has risen, whilst that of the Deputy Governor has correspondingly fallen. Pinprick® are correspondingly reduced* The mentality and mmXX minded* ness of these people is incredible and cannot possibly be realised except by those who have personal experience of it.P.Z.1865/35. -v 7 /f /A Confidential 4T Extract from Report of Proceedings of the 3.N.O., and Ships of the Persian Gulf Division, covering the period 1st to 31st December 1934. 'V HENJAlvU 5. As already fully reported by signal, further trouble the occurred regarding the registration of/R.I.N. boats. The Deputy Governor threatened to arrest Telles, ordered that the boats must either be taken away, registered, or else not used, and refused to await the result of diplomatic negotiations at Tehran. Steamboat, however, was used as required securing alongside a sloop at night, and at the end of the month the Deputy Governor was told by Tehran to allow boats to run as usual pending receipt of further written Instructions. This has now blown over. It is evident from their action locally that the Persians consider they have been 111 advised to press for the registration of boats. This question of registration follows on the fact that little notice was taken at the time of the Deputy Governor's action when he prohibited the embarkation of moorings (the 300 years old and much rusted muzzle loading guns) on account of the Persian law prohibiting the export of *fire arms *. What is considered to be a little success by the local petty officials, encourages them on to further effortsp.z.557/35 SECRET. EXTRACT FROM PERSIAN GULF INTELLIGENCE REPORT - NOVEMBER, 193^ . 9. Registration of Boats . With reference to paras. 1 - 3 of August Summary, the Deputy Governor said he had received new instructions from Tehran which required all Royal Indian Naval 'boats to he registered at once. 10. He was informed that his authorities at Tehran must have made a mistake as such an order was contrary to international practice, and that as instructions had not heen received from the British Minister to this effect, nothing would he done. 11. His affection for the Senior Naval Officer once more overpowering him, he offered as a favour to delay executing the order for a fortnight, hut it was made clear that such a question did not arise and that nothing could he done until we received instructions from Tehran. This he finally accepted.INDEXED In any further communication on this subject, please quote nd address —not to any person by!name, but to— The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Though I have not seen Minister for Foreign Affairs again I approached Ministry of Foreign Affairs through Oriental Secretary on December 24th, 25th and 26th. ues tion seems to have originated in enquiry from competent department as to views of Minister for Foreign Aifairs of an application of a regulation which already existed for registration of boats on the same lines as regulations regarding cars and carriages. Minister for Foreign Affairs expressed opinion that regulation should apply to boats which b elonged to, or remained permanently in a port, but not to boats belonging to and brought info'port from men of war. Regulations were issued by police who are responsible for their execution. On December 25th the Oriental Secretary was informed that Ministry of the Interior had telegraphed to Henjam for a report' and on December 26th he was told that fact that this enquiry had been made would ensure that local authorities would take no further action until their report had been considered in Tehran and therefore chat nothing would be done during the coming holidays (i.e. up to January 1st). I have been promised copy of regulations.

He says he has several times queried his instructions from Tehran v/hich he states are received from Foreign Office through Minister of Interior. Deputy Governor has been told by Persian Government that law relating to registration of boats applies to Royal Indian Marine boats attached to Henjam depot and that these are to be registered and numbered although flying white ensign. Staff officer informed him that as matter had been referred to Tehran for diplomatic settlement by both of us I could only wait until I received instructions in the usual way. He now says that he must put his orders into force forthwith and prevent Royal Indian Marine boats being used. The steam-boat is necessary for unloading store-ship now in harbour/35 harbour. I have used it for towing lighters and secured it alongside Shoreham when not running. A Persian-owned boat just arrived from Bundar Abbas is unregistered. Neither are public boats of British Government registered in other Persian ports unless very recently. This appears to be a definite attempt on the part of Persian Government to create difficulties at Henjam. Deputy Governor’s last instructions were received by mail a week ago and may possibly be a preliminary to a request for our withdrawal from Henjam. Request that this matter may be taken up as soon as possible as I cannot guarantee to prevent Deputy Governor from taking unfortunate action. Ends.

As otherwise Governor had previously told Mr. Biddulph Ford that he would take serious action against any man using a boat that was not numbered but made no mention of this at interview this morning. Stores landed without incident and steamboat is now secured alongside oil lighter some distance from shore with crew on board. 1 am confident that he is acting under orders from Tehran.
