In his right hand the man grips the handle of a light-coloured umbrella or parasol. On his feet he wears shoes featuring an ornate buckle.The negative has had hand-work applied, causing it to take on a soft-shaded quality in places. In particular, the man’s feet have been over-drawn due to overexposure at the lower left corner of the photograph.Inscriptions:Printed above image, in ink:XIVPrinted beneath image, in ink:‘Sohn des Arztes.’A circular 'British Museum' blind stamp is located in the lower right corner.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Portrait photography</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023619120.0x00001a#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
