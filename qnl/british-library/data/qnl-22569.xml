Mr* Ballantyne called on li+th April and discussed the request made in Mr. Walton's letter of the iJ+th July 1936 for certain assurances in regard to the control of the Bahrein Petroleum Company. (A copy of this letter was circul he interested Departments on 15th July, 1936, and dr mail to the Government of India, Bushire and Bahrein on the 12th September matter careful consideration and quite sympathised with the feelings of H.M.G. as expressed in the earlier part of the letter. Thej* were anxious to give some assurances to H.M.G., hut they did not feel that they were in a position to give the specific assurances requested. They left it to Mr. Ballantyne to work out something which would he satisfactory to H. M. G. and which would also he possible for them to subscribe. He explained that there were certain objections to the specific assurances suggested. In the first place the Standard Oil Company of California and the Texas Company, the present parent companies, are public companies and no control can be exercised over dealings in tneir shares. Any assurance by the Board of the Bahrein Petroleum Company could not prevent changes in the control of the parent companies and therefore an assurance of the Icmd suggested would not be of very much use., secondly, the Board of the B.P.C. would not in any case ieel able to give an unqualified assurance of the kind suggested, principally because, while the 'present Articles Ox Absociaoion of the Company give the Board complete control/ Mr. Ballantyne said that the Companyt control over movements of shares, the articles might 'be changed in such a way as to remove that power. The Board did not feel they could safely give an assurance that the Articles of Association would neve r he altered in this respect - though of course there is no intention whatever of altering them. Thirdly, and this I think was Mr. Ballantyne's main point, an assurance of the kind suggested could easily be got round by the Company if they wanted to do so. For instance, to take the case of the recent mei ^er, tue u., instead oi giving half the shares to the Texas Company, might have made an agreement with then; undertaking to let them have the whole produce of the Bahrein field, or something of that kind. This would really have had the same effect from the point of view of H.M.G., i.e. it would have brought another company very much into the Bahrein picture. If the company had been a Japanese, German or Italian company, H.M.G. might have objected very much to the arrangement, but under the assurances at present proposed they would not have had any right to do so. It was not very easy to follow Mr.Ballantyne's arguments, particularly the legal ones, but his real point io Perfectly clear, viz. that any specific assurances of thu Kind suggested, even if the Company felt that they could safely subscribe to them, would not be really eixecti/e from iI.ivl.Cx. s point of view. He suggested that vnat was really required was a general undertaking by tne Company to respect the special interests of ii. in the rersian Gulf and to refrain from any action which would prejudice them. After some discussion ■ e agi eed that tne simplest procedure might be for Mr. Ballantyne to reply to the letter of 14th July saying that ^cmp«ny were sorry they could not give the specific assurances requested and that we should then write to -r. Ballantyne saying that H.M.G. regretted the Company were/1 were unable to do this, but that the Company should recognise that H.M.G., 'both on historical and strategic grounds and in view of their special treaty relations with ;,ie Arab Rulers, have special interests in the Persian Gulf area and that H.M.G. hope that in dealing with any matters connected with the control of the Company or of its policy and operations the Company would bear in mind these special interests and take care to avoid any action which might in any way prejudice them. The point of this would be that the Company (who would, under this arrangement, acknowledge the receipt of our letter) would have permanently before them a general obligation to respect H.M.G.'s special interests. This would involve consulting H.M.G. in advance if there was any proposal the effect of which might in any way infringe on these rights (e.g. if there were some suggestion of a combination with an Italian firm or the like). If the Company at some future time actually did something which prejudiced H.M.G.'s interests it would be open to H.M.G. to use their political predominance in the Gulf to make the Company's position thoroughly uncomfortable and the Company would not be able to complain in the light of the present correspondence. In fact, instead of having bound the Company with a legal agreement from which they would be quite capable of disentangling themselves if they wished, ii• r/x.G• would have bound the Company with an extra-legal understanding which would enable H.M.G. in the event of any oreach to use the extra-legal weapons which their special position in the Gulf, and particularly in Bahrein, enables them to wield, (e.g. pressure through the Sheikh or through the Political Agent by King's Regulations or the like). I told Mr. Ballantyne I would consult with the other people/people concerned here and talk to him again later. (Sd.) M.J.

Dear Mr.Ballantyne, Would you kindly refer to your letter of the 30tli April and our conversation about that time in ?/hi&lt;-n ^ou asked for the views of His Majesty's Government on the suggestion that the Australian Government might 'be asked to grant an Imperial preference on Bahrein oil products. This question has necessitated various consultations and I am sorry not to have been able to give you an earlier reply. 2. The reply is that the quantity of oil produced in the Bnpire is small and that the seeking or granting o preference on oil products generally has not been the policy of His Majesty's Government. The disadvantages which might arise from any change of policy are likely to be greater than the advantages. For these reasons 'his Majesty's Government, so far as they are concerned, would prefer that the question should not be pursued by the C ompany. 3. The above is, of course, for j^our confidential information. Yours s incerely, • R ' B u: n ^ 3 Lu, Wauci^c*, E.G.3.p.Z. 3963/37. Petroleum Department (Mi ne s De pa rt me nt) Dean Stanley St. Millbank, London,S.W. 1 No.P.D.21/4. 12th June,1937 Iv5j dear Glaus on, With reference to your letter of 18th May on the subject of the preferential rates of duty in Australia and New Zealand for Bahrein oils, while I think it is unlikely that either of these two countries would accede to the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company, I do not think we should allow the matter to be put to the test. As you know, there is no preference in the United Kingdom for Empire oils. Trinidad have applied for a preference on motor spirit on a number of occasions in recent years, but have been turned down. Empire production (apart from Bahrein) is very small and is confined to Trinidad, Sarawak and Brunei, Burmah and India. Burmah production is absorbed in India, Trinidad oil enjoys a preference in some of the West Indian Islands, but that is largely a local arrangement. It also enjoys a preference in Sierra Leone, but the quantity of oil involved is almost negligible. The only cases in which we have endeavoured to obtain preference have been in respect of lubricating oils manufactured in this country. This is a rather specialised trade faced with stiff American competition, the American sources of supply being very much nearer to both the West Indies and tne Australasian markets. Over a period of years we have managed to secure a few improvements in the qualifying conditions in both places. ■B-Uson Esq f .ia Office' Whitehall,s.W.1. Any/'O 2. Any general extension of preference to motor spirit, fuel oil, etc., would not in practice benefit Empire producers. On the other hand, the grant of a preference to Bahrein oil would, in certain countriesj notahly Australia, enable the Bahrein Company to compete on favourable terms with existing British interests marketing oil not of empire origin. This question arose in July last, when the marketing arrangements with the Texas Company were under discussion. On that occasion I mentioned that there were certain advantages from the point of view of our big oil groups in a Company like the Texas handling the oil, since it will then flow into the channels where they normally trade, and thus there would be a minimum of disturbance of markets, which is all to the good from the point of view of British oil interests. (See my letter of 3rd July, 1936, I.O.ref.P.Z,4298/36.) But if the Bahrein-Texas Company is going to get a preference in certain markets, it cannot but prejudice the interests of the Anglo- Iranian and Shell Companies. To take the case of Australia;, I enclose a statement showing the imports of petroleum products in the year 1954/5, from which you will see that the bulk of the imports are obtained from Dutch East Indies and Persia, the Shell Group and the Anglo-Iranian being the principal companies concerned. The latter Company operate through the Commonwealth Oil Refineries,Limited, one half of whose capital is held by the Commonwealth Government. I suggest, therefore, that it should be pointed out to Ballantyne in general terms that the quantity of oil produced in the Empire is small, and that the seeking or granting of preferences on oil products generally has not been the policy of H.M,Government. The disadvantages which might2^ 3 * might arise irom any change of policy are likely to be greater than the advantages. For these reasons, therefore, H.M» Government would prefer that the matter were noo pursued. On the question of assurances to 'be given in regard to the control of the Bahrein Petroleum Company (your letter p .Z. 2544/37 of 28th April), I am inclined to think that the proposal to exchange letters v^ould he the hest way of dealing with the matter, providing, as Seal suggests in his letter of 25th May, that it is made clear that any proposal regarding the transfer of control to other interests will be notified well in advance to H.M.Government. I am sending copies of this letter to Brenan, Bankes- Amery, Clauson and Seal. Yours sincerely, (Sd.) P.O.Starling,CONFIDENTIAL.

Dear Mr. Gibson, As I told you yesterday afternoon, this Company desires to appoint Mr. John Sutherland Black, one of its employees at present in Bahrein, to he Chief Local Representative of the Company in Bahrein in the place of the present Acting Chief Local Representative, Mr. G. W.R.Smith. Mr. Black was horn in 1896 in Edinburgh. He retired from the Royal Navy with the rank of Lieutenant Commander in 1922. Following that he served in various capacities and in various parts of the world until late in 1936 when he was engaged by this Company. Mr. Black has served in Bahrein for just over a year now and has done so to the satisfaction of the Company. The Company have had in mind, for some time past, the appointment of one of its own British employees as a successor to Mr. Smith, the present Representative. Mr.Smith, as you know, is an employee of Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie Co., ' a trading company having an office at Manama. Mr. Black seems to be the right type of person and the Company would like to appoint him to fill the post if His Majesty's Government approve of their doing so. Perhaps you would be good enough to let me know, in due course, the views of His Majesty's Government in regard to the proposed appointment.

Dear Mr. Gibson, I refer to my recent talks with you concerning the treatment of petroleum (crude oil) obtained from the Arabian Mainland, on Bahrein Island. The California Arabian Standard Oil Gompany have recently completed a Well at Dammam on the Mainland which is believed to be capable of producing a substantial quantity of petroleum, and other Wells in the same field are being drilled to determine whether a commercial oil field has been discovered. It will be necessary to produce oil from these Wells for the purpose of conducting satisfactory tests of their capacity. At the present time there are no facilities on the Mainland for storing the crude oil thus produced; therefore, the California Arabian Standard Oil Gompany have arranged to sell it to The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited; it will be barged across to Zellak, thence by pipe to one of the 'field-gathering stations' on Bahrein Island. The tanks constituting the 'Gathering Station' are calibrated so that an exact measurement may be taken of the crude oil entering and leaving the 'Station'. The Resident Manager of The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited is shortly informing the Bahrein Government of their purchase andyproposals with a view to making arrangements satisfactory to that Government for the measurement/ • Gibson Esq., Office, Whitehall, S.W.I./ui' 2. measurement of the quantity of the Bahrein oil which may 'be used in connection with the handling and refining of Mainland Crude ? and other like questions, I think there is no need for the Company to emphasise that these operations arising from the testing of the Wells on the Mainland are not necessarily indicative of further operations of a like nature in the future. What the future holds in regard to the production, measurement and disposal of petroleum obtained on the Mainland (assuming always production of petroleum in commercial quantities) the California Arabian Standard Oil Company cannot even venture to suggest.

Sir, Your most obedient servant.THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED Awali, Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, June 2nd, 1938. a&amp;e subject of isiportlng oil from Arabia was discussed tills moamlng by Mr. Deacon and Mr. Bel grave iB the latter*s office. The question of duties and royalties was briefly reviewed. point was brougkt up tiiat whereas it was agreed the imported oil was royalty free, it is plainly stated in our concession agreement that oil used to refine the imported crude is definitely subject to royalty. Hi© next item to be discussed was the gauging of the imported oil. ISie Company's proposed general plan of handling this oil was outlined as followss- (1) Receive oil in Bahrein Petroleum Ooy. barges at A1 Khobar. (2) transport to Zellaq.. (3) Unload barges at Eellaq into small gauging tanks. (4) Have Government gauges taken. (§) Tmgthe Arabian oil thru to fanks 15S and 153 at Eefinery. (e) Subtract quantity of Arabian oil from the general gauge into tanks 152 and 153 and thus obtain the amount of Bahrein crude released to the Hefine:cy. It was agreed that whereas the crude is gauged in Arabia, still it is subject to some possible loss in transporting it to Bahrein and it should there fore be gauged upon arrival at 2eilaq. It was pointed out that this oil would be delivered from aellaq, direct to the royalty gauging tasks at the Eefinery, using that part of the gather ing system from No.5 tank Battery onwards. On this account the gauging at ZeUaq should be exactly done so that by subtracting the amount of Arabian Crude puisped thru to fanks 152 and 153 from the total amount of crude oil delivered to the Seflnery, the amount of Bahrein crude subject to royalty can be obtained* This procedure was agreeable to both parties, l^e question of correct measurement of the Arabian crude i^to Eellaq. tanks was next brought up. Inasmuch as these are small tanks, and the cost of having Redwoods cf London send a man out to strap these tanks seemed prohibitive, and since it is very probable that Redwoods will be sending a man out later in the year to strap- s - t/ otiier tanks now contemplated, It was agreed that it would be satisfactory to have one of our engineers strap these tanks under the supervision of a Govern ment representative. The measurements secured would then be sent to Eedwoods in London for calculation and pre paration of proper gauge charts. Later in the year when Bedwoods will probably have a man in Bahrein, he will again strap these tanks for a check, and if any discrepancy is found on comparison with the original figures, adjustments would be made to the gauges taken to date, A copy of the foregoing is to be sent to The California Standard Oil Coy. in London, for their views, and a final procedure will be drawn up along these lines, and submitted to the Government and the Political Agent. 4 0. daleimpls belgrav^ d, w. deaci® cwdib.n». 0/423 10/1 The Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to : — The Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Karachi, and has the honour to send him a copy of the undermentioned document (s) The Agency, BAHRAIN, Persian Gulf. / t ,y Dated 23rd June 1938, — This Agency memor / Reference fo previous correipondence: andum No. C/356 dated the 29th May 1938.

C/434-10/1 Bated the 3rd July 1933, Dear Sir Trenchard, I was talking to 'i ?hornbarg the other night about a recent trip he had made northwards from Baamam and he said he would give me a copy of the sketch map on which his Com pany was working from l anifah northwards to the Kuwait Neutral Zone. He has now sent me this map and I enclose it herewith. g # Thornburg tells me that the coast line shown in the Admiralty Charts is distinctly inaccurate and that the line shown on this sketch la correct. The dotted line portion is an exception as they have not yet done a proper traverse there. The pencil line shows his route, and the &lt;ahole journey was done in cars without excessive difficulty, though shortage of water gave them a certain amount of trouble towards the end# 3. The interesting places on the Coast from the point of view of possible port construction are Doha f ^anifa, Jebel ®1 Thaluf and lias al Khafqi. So geophysical survey has yet been done in this area, the Abu Hadriyah structure which sur veyed by the seismic method this last cold weather being off the map In a south-westerly direction. But they will probably be going ahead with further geophysical surveys next winter, since this part of the country becomes the more interesting owing to the Kuwait Oil strike and the discovery of a very fine structure at Abu Hadriyah-. (The latter of course has yet to be proved and may contain no oil whatsoever)# 4# The inlet near Has al Khafqi Is Interesting, and will presumably in due course be part of the boundary between Saudi , lr . , Arabla/- able Lieutenant-Colonel air xreachard Fowls, KCIS, CB*i, Political Resident In the Persian Oulf#Arabia and Kuwait, or at any rate between Sandl Arabia and the Kuwait Neutral 3one. It is fed by salt water springs and holds a moderate depth of water at all states of the tide* 5, This sketch map possibly be of Interest to His Majes ty's Government ^ but perhaps I might have the original back when copies have been taken, ov- ■' ' . 6, The following infonriation also be interesting though I do not vouch for its entire accuracy. I believe that the California Company are negotiating - or intending to negotiate - with Ibn Sand with a view to dispensing with the clause in their concession requiring tbem to construct a refinery in Saudi Arabian territory. The refinery clause in the present concession does not actually state what quantity (or percentage) of crude oil found in Arabia laust be refined there, but I under stand that it so happens that the very next clause requires the Company to supply refined products 'up to the needs of n the Saudi Government, So if the two are read together they pre sumably contain the answer. If this is so then only a very minute refinery has to be constructed there, and it is pre sumably for this reason that the approach is to be made to Ibn 3aud to waive the requirements of this particular clause without actually omitting it from the concession, A remark made was roughly as follows!- 'If Ibn Baud and -Shaikh aamad between them do not force us to build a refinery in Arabia then these coastal surveys will be of interest only for locat ing ports for landing equipment and stores. The reference to Shaikh Hamad of course relates to the struggle for the Unallotted Area. 1 , . Yours sincerely,norrfidential n».

' 'o Subject. Refining of Saudi Oil in the Bahrain Petroleum Company's Refinery(&lt;0 Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman Ganie to s ee me this morning on behalf of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad, who is still rather weak, and informed me that they had been instructed by His Highness to obtain my advice in re gard to certain reservations of land for which the Bahrain Petroleum Company have applied in order to lay a pipe line from Zellaq to their nearest pumping station for the purpose of conveying to the Refinery oil brought in barges from Saudi Arabia to Zellaq, 2, Apparently the object was to ascertain whether it was possible to obtain any sort of assurance or undertaking that production of crude oil in Bahrain woiild not be reduced as a result of these importations of Saudi oil. I pointed out that an undertaking of this sort had been asked for in the original negotiations regarding the construction of a Refinery in Bahrain when the question of importing Saudi oil was first mooted. T reminded the Shaikhs that the Company had, for good and sufficient reason which had been accepted by His Majesty's Government, expressed their inability to guarantee that in no circumstances would there be a reduc tion in the quantity of Bahrain oil produced. I said that I thought there was little to f ear from the temporary arrangements being made to transport oil from ill Khobar by barges to Zellaq (thence piped to the Refinery) since obviously this form of transport over shallow water could not result in more than a limited quantity of oil being imported into Bahrain. T said that it was quite possible for the Bahrain Government to render these arrangements difficult, if not impossible, by Obstructing the reserva tion of the land required for the pipe line from Zellaq onwards, but that I thought this would be a grave error in policy. It was, after all, only a temporary arrangement, providing/-providing only for comparatively small imports; and if at ani ; time the American Companies wished to make more perma nent arrangements for importing very much larger quantities of Saudi oil for refining here, then that would be the time to negotiate fixed percentages between the quantities of Bahrain and 3audi oil to be refined.I also said that T thought i would be well to direct the Company's attention, oy facilitating the present negotiations; to the advantages which they might expect to derive by extending their opera- I tions in Bahrain* No one could of course be absolutely 1 certain what the future might bring, but at least it was worth while trying to impress on the Americans the advantages which Bahrain offered, since it was remotely conteLvable that I ! this might result ultimately in considerable expansion of their refinery operations here, with consequent profit to Bahrain. I made it clear that this was no more than a re mote possibility but that it was at least worth while taking into consideration. On the other hand obstruction in regard to a minor affair such as the present negotiations for tem- i| 'd| Arabia might possibly have the result of focussing American attention on the mainland, and this the Shaikhs should seek to avoid as far as they possibly could, 1 !■?' 3. To sum up, I thought that the Shaikhs would be safe j in facilitating the proposed temporary arrangements for the import of small quantities of Saudi oil, particularly since the scheme proposed was not one calculated to be capable of much expansion in the future; that by so doing a certain amount of good will would be established, which might be a very valuable asset in due course; and that if the Company later wished to make permanent arrangements for larger imports I (which would unquestionably mean either a submarine pipe-line j j porary importations of small quantities of crude from SaudiI or the use of heavy tankers between e.g. Has Tanura and Sitrah) then the question of ratios to protect Bahrain production could be more flilly examined. We were unfortu nately not dealing with certainties but only with possibi lities, but my personal view was ithat it was much to the advantage of the Shaikhs to be reasonably helpful over the present negotiations. Obstruction was possible, though ( it would be against the spirit of the Hefinery agreement, and I was sure it would be a grave error to indulge in it. Shaikh Abdullah and Shaikh Salman appeared to be entirely i satisfied with this point of view and undertook to inform His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad when he is a little better. /rK 4th July 1938#Ne- c/440-10/1 The Political Agent, Bahrain, Presents his compliments to : — 1« His Majesty*a Secretary of State for India, India Office, /hiteliall, London, S. , % 1, 2.

In reply to your letter (P.2.3544/38) of 20th May about the royalty arrangements of the Bahrein Petroleum Company and the refining of Hasa oil at Bahreln» we have examined the documents sent to you hy Mr. Ballantyne, which cover the arrangemonts for assessing the quantities ol oil which are used at the refinery for processing purposes and also for certain miscellaneous purposes connected with the Company's operations, and on which royalty is not payable. Generally speaking these arrangements seem to have 'been carefully worked out on i paper? but what really matters is the manner in which effect is given to the scheme in practice* Naturally with so many exceptions the question of watching over the arrangements becomes more important# But I recognise that this is a matter for the Sheikh and his advisers. When, in 1934, we concurred in the arrangements for measuring the Bahrein crude oil for royalty purposes we felt that it was desirable to have an Independent opinion on the methods which it was proposed to ise (see Redwoods 1 letter of 5th Noverritaor 1934, and my letter to Laithwaite of 3r£ December 1934).

Apparently the Company Intend to submit a meraorandum of their proposals for dealing with these matters in relation to Kasa crude and if they do we shall he glad to look at it.

Lipp, rep resenting the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, were pre sent. Mr. Lipp stated that the Company wished a barge of crude oil to be brought to their Zellaq tanks on the follow ing morning, which would be followed hy further shipments. He explained that the Company required to import this oil into the Bahrain Refinery in order to meet their sales commitments. He explained that the Company had been obliged to request that consideration of the proposals for Royalty Accounting Procedure should be held up temporarily, as they had received a cable to this effect from their London Office He therefore requested that, in view of the undesirability of their work being held up, the Company might be allured to import crude oil from Hasa using the Accounting Procedure already submitted for approval, which had, he said, been verbally agreed to by the State Engineer of the Bahrain Government. Mr. de Grenier said that the Bahrain Govern ment would have no objection to facilitating the operations of the Company by agreeing to this proposal, but that he would have to confirm the agreement of the State Engineer to the methods proposed5 and would inform Mr. Lipp verbally that same evening whether the Company might go ahead with their work. Captain Howes remarked that this arrangement must be understood to he purely temporary and that if sub sequently a different procedure was approved by the Politi cal Resident, it must be applied retrospectively to all translactions carried out under the temporary procedure. Mr. de Grenier and Mr, Lipp were both in agreement.Ko* C/663-10/1 Political Agency, ^shrainj 'the 4't&gt;li 1938 From Captain J.

H# Mpp, representing the Bah rain Petroleum Company during the illness of Mr* Deacon, and myself. The Agency file copy of this conversation has been initialled by Mr, de Grenier and Mr, Lipp, 2. The Bahrain Petroleum Company recently sent me a pro posed procedure for gauging, for royalty purposes, the oil which they intend to bring to Bahrain from Hasa for refining. I was obtaining the views of the Bahrain Government on their proposals, as a preliminary to addressing you on the subject, when the Chief Local Representative informed me by telephone that the Company wished to submit fresh proposals in a slightly different form. Consideration of the previous proposals had therefore been suspended, when the interview recorded took Place. ( p' W- 3. It appeared to me that the consent of the Bahrain Go vernment was the essential factory and that, as the figures could be adjusted if a slightly different procedure were sub sequently adopted, it would be unnecessarily obstructive to delay/-/ delay the Company* s operations until such time as the perma nent procedure were approved. I therefore took the responsi bility of allowing the Bahrain Government and the Company to agree to this temporary measure, and hope that you will approve of my action.

Captain, Offgt Political Agent, Bahrain,THE BAHREIN PETROLEUM COMPANY LIMITED i^L ■t Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, Awali, September 4^, 1938, His Britannic Majesty^ Political Agent Manama, Ba hrein Islands Dear Sir / We are enclosing herewith seven copies of a chart showing the channel that is in general use by The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited launches and barges making our pier at Sitra as well as by other craft proceeding to Qatar etc., The chart shows the present marks and also further channel markers that it is proposed to erect. in view of the fact that the channel is in general use, the Company does not wish to make a reservation of the ground involved, but intends to negotiate through the Bahrein Government for the purchase outright of the fishtrap reservation marked #6 on the accompanying chart. The name of this is A1 Achaiya (Alaichia). In the past it has been the custom for the Company to lease all of the traps numbered on the chart and to sublet them, as a precaution against excessive claims for damage caused by passing Company craft, but it is now felt that with the extra beacons proposed no claims could be made by owners of traps except #6 and the Company does not intend to lease the others for this or subsequent reasons. Further, as others make use of the Channel, the Company does not feel obliged to take all the expense of the trap leases. This decision will be communicated direct to the Land Department. Please inform us at your early convenience as to whether the Bahrein Government is agreeable to the Company marking the channel in the way proposed without making this a Company reser vation. If the reply is favourable we would inform you when the markers were in position and the fish-trap negotiation complete, so that the location of the channel etc., could be promulgated.

For record purposes, certified tank gauges will be taken of royalty measuring tanks Nos, 152 and 153 and of all refinery crude oil storage tanks, and the quantities of all unfinished stocks in refinery tanks ascertained and certified by a Bahrein Government representative, prior to the receipt of the first Arabian crude oil, 3, The measurement of each delivery of Arabian crude oil out of the Zellaq measuring tanks will be witnessed by a Bahrein Government representative and recorded on a delivery ticket certified by the State Engineer, 4, The amount of Bahrein crude oil run from field storage on which the gross royalty payable to the Sheikh of Bahrein will be calculated will be determined by certified runs of the comingled crude oil from royalty measuring tanks Nos, 152 and 153, with a deduction of the exact amount of Arabian crude oil measured and run from the Zellaq tanks, 5, Since the measured quantity of Arabian crude oil deliver ed out of Zellaq tanks will enter into the calculations only in connection with runs from royalty measuring tanks Nos. 152 and 153, all crude oil at any time remaining in the Company^ field storage and pipe lines, including the line from the Zellaq tanks to the juncture with the Bahrein gathering system, will be regarded as Bahrein oil#gage 2. lb the quantity of oil used i+t I f? rield storage Spo?ted U oll. in COnnection wi ^ the^efining of^ ^ ^ the quantity of oil used as^fuel wlli va^ dlrec?^ with the quantity of crude oil being tr^fl Henoe it may be assumed that the total oil so used will be made up of Bahrein and Arabian oils in proportions based upon the respeotive quantities of each handled ^ms is also true with respect to oil used in'tr ori ^-* porting the oomingled crude oil and the nroduotrthere- from.
