Our view is that the commercial prospects of what would in fact be the third air transport company to be set up in Persia would not be good and we do not wish therefore to become involved in its affairs. In any case a third company could only do business at all at the expense of Iranian State Airlines which is the company we have encouraged from the start and to which it is our long-term policy to supply not only aircraft and equipment but also technical advice and assistance, if required. 2. We fear it will be some time before any aircraft of the types mentioned in your paragraph 2 will be available for general sale while as regards staff it is difficult at the moment to meet our own urgent requirements.

I gladly join in urging that the proposed service should at any rate accept traffic on Tehran - Bagdad link. This would link up Tehran with B.O.A.C. main network and other Middle East services. As already stated in my telegram No. 208 I regard it as most unlikely that the Persians will object. Their own airline between Tehran and Bagdad offers only six seats weekly with negigible freight. 2. You are of course aware that there has always been considerable amount of potential traffic between Tehran and the Levant States and Palestine. Whilst appreciating arguments in favour of using Beirut purely as a transit stop I would nevertheless urge from commercial point of view and in order to make proposedproposed service as attractive as possible to the Persians, the advantages of call at Lydda in both directions should not be lost sight of even if it is considered politically desirable to come down at Beirut as well for reasons given in Beirut telegram No. 207 to you. 5. Service as at present proposed would seem to cut out Cairo (unless there will be connecting link from and to Athens), involve a very long [grp. undec. ? stretch] of virtually 'dead” flying and to cater only for through traffic between Tehran and Europe There would be valuable improvement in our bag facilities but service would not help either official or non official passengers having to travel between Tehran and the Middle East posts or India.

Burnett said that the first point to be considered was the route which the proposed air service between Karachi ana Tehran should follow. A/c Runciman said that there were four possible routes namely (i) that following roughly the existing route along the Arabian side of the persian Gulf, i.e. Karachi- sahrain-KUwait- Basra-Tehran, (ii) that following the persian side of the Persian Gulf i.e. Karachi-jiwanl-jask-Bushire- ;Liraz-Ispahan-Tehran. (ill) Karachi-Zahidan or Mli-jawa-Keman-Ispahan- Tehran. (iv) through Afghanistan i. e . Kabul-Herat- .— ~ 1 */........2. p/Q Rimclman made the folj-owlhg coaimeute on the above routes; As regards (i) f this would not be loQpular with the Persians in view ol the fact that it called at Bahrain, to which they thought they had eoiae claims, and also it would duplicate the existing BOAC route. «s regards No.(ii), there was a very bad patch of mountainous country between shiraz and Ispahan. Further North, over the same range, aircraft had at times seen forced up to over 21,000 feet, which was undesirable for a commercial route. Boute No.(iii) was the most direct but suffered from the fact that there were not such good prospects of traffic en route (except at Ispahan) and that the airfield at Ispahan was not good. Furthermore refueling at Kerman, which would be essential, would be expensive, a point in ravou/ of this route was that it lay to the north east of the main mountain mass and experienced generally better weather than aay of the other routes, particularly in winter time. The fourth route was not really worthy of discussion as it was impracticable on both political and geographical grounds. 3. At this point ool.B&amp;rnett said that he wished to make it nuite clear that there was no question at all of oux being able to use the airfields which we had built inipersian territory either for military or civilian purpose except as a result of negotiations with the Persian Government now that the war was over. a/C ivncJman suggested that (subject to any arrangements made by the military Disposals authorities who were responsible for handing the airfields over to the Persians) in these negotiations we might ask for some rights as a quid pro quo for handing over ths/.the concrete airstrips, which we had built, Irae to the persian Government and sir Frederick lymms added that an offer to su contribute towards the maintenance of the fields might be used in our negotiations. 4. sir Frederick lymnis said that although the Karechi-Tehran air service was low down in the Government of India's general list of post-wax air development schemes, on account of the vast amount of Internal work which had to be done in India, this service might well come high up in the list of external schemes, sir Frederick Tymme asked a/C Hunciman if he could give any estimate of the amount of traffic which might be expected on this route; he replied that euiy a very vague guess might be made. ThB alternatives to air travel in persia were extremely uncomfort able and he thought that there would be a fair (mount of official traffic and that the existence of an air service might encourage commercial traffic. He thouf$it that at the beginning it might be possible to fill a Dakota a week each way particularly as over the Ispahan section of the route the aircraft might have to operate light in anytase. 5. The next question considered was the time factor i.e. whether it was preferable that the approach to the persian GoveiUment should be made now or later. a/C Runcimsn. said that the airfields at I'irjawa, zahidan and Kerman were well built and would probably not deteriorate rapidly but that many of the other airfields built and maintained by the Persians would undoubtedly deteriorate fairly rapidly. He said that/\s m0 tr that officially the Persian ooveiment were making no air agreements until all foreign troops were out of * persia; they did not sign the fifth freedom agreement but there were strong rumours that concessions similar to fifth freedom ones might be granted to pan-^nerican airways. # 6. It was generally considered that the present time was not unsuitable for an approach by the Government of India- to the persian Government for the opening of an air service on a reciprocal brsis, as chances of success would tend to oL ^ teriorate as time passed. |/rr. Shoobert added that Council had recently decided that |t*iddle East schemes should be pushed forward without delay. It w^s thought that there was alight advantage in the route no.( iii) although both (ii) and (iii) should be mentioned in the approach to the Persian Government, sir Frederick Tymms mentioned in connection with reciprocity that the Persian Gove:mm*vb should be invited to make use of the air service training schools which are to be opened in mdia^nd also suggested that we could perhaps take some Persians into the Indian Air companies and give thsm training. should definitely press for sixth freedom right in our approach to the persian Government but the decision on this point would be to a very great extent dependent on the Persian attitude towards the Bissians. 7. sir Frederick Tymms stained that he thou^it the Government of India should definitely plan to run a g high class air service to Persia with a high standard of comfort and amenities for the passengers and not go in for a small •hedge hopping' service. He thought that very probably Dakotas would be the most suitable planes. a/c K unclran said that night flying was at present most hazardous/.••••••• • ■ - a.

Burnett said that the persien Government had now sanctioned the inspection of the Government of Indian stations in Persia. A/C hunciman said ttiat tne prohiem as regards aviation was almost entirely a signals matter as at^pi’esent such meteorological information as was availaoie wot always delivered far too late. The Government of India maintained stations along the Gulf and the raFi during the war, had developed a good system serving the Tehran- Baghdad line, the raF had now left persia and the Persian Government proposed to take over the stations but there were In fact practically no Persians qualified to operate them and they had asked for help from India. Mr. sunoooert and s/Lr Bruce-Clayton both mentioned tne difficulty of obtaining qualified Muslim operators, pariis would be our acceptable alternative, cr. Banerji said that the operation of Meteorological Observatories was a highly technic*! process and that he would prefer that the Government of India’s stations should not yet be handed over to the Persian Government. He would prefer that they should open and operate some of their own first and we could see If they were capable of taking of the Government of India's and running them efficiently. It was decided in the end that in the circumstances and in view of the uncertainty of employment under the persian Government, the best plan as regards Radio personnel would be lor the Director General Civil Aviation to recruit them as the cadre of the Aeronautic 1 Radio service which is to be established/*..* established shortly. Ihe grades of personnel contemplated as necessary for this puipose are- 1. regional Hadio Engineer n V 2. station Enginaer. 3. ’Rdio ffecnanlcB They would be seut on deputation to the perslan Sovern:!. 9 iit for a fixed period and the total cost, including special allowances, would oe recovered from the perstan Government by the Government of India. They would serve both meteorological and civil aviation a&gt;mmunication needs. p/C fiunciman agreed and said that it was most • desirable that India should have a l eborological link-up with the viddie East, through Tehran as well as through the Gulf and that the fiddle East authorities we; e very keen on this. Mr. Shoobert added that suc^i a proposal was desirable from three points of view i.e* (i) it would provide additional weather forecasting information for India&gt; (ii) it would assist civil aviation and (ill'it would further friendly relations between Persia and India. It was generally agreed that the Government of India should do everything possioie to help the persian Government in the establishment of an efficient meteorological and aeronautical Eadio services of their own. It was agreed that Mr. Mohd. as lam should proceed to carry out the inspection of the Persian Gulf meteorological stations and than go on to Tehran, timing his tour as to arrive there at the end of January or early in February 1946 by which time the Al r Ktt&amp;che should be back from the united Kingdom, m T8hr«an Mr* Mohd.

It ws* agreed that In further discussions on this subject witi. the Persian Government Air Commodore ainclman should indicate that if an approach were made by the Persian Government to the Government of India for a definite number of meteorological and Radio personnel, the Government of India wouxd do all they could to assist.P*8Lti CO? 6'* [This telegran is ^ hy the authorise \ v* i r of patt$.4i£Lar sjc ^-Te'tfipiehf'Sm /.

These organisations could be directly useful to us and Government of India particularly if the Government of India can transfer to the Persian Government responsibility for meteorological observations along the Persian Gulf, 5.

Before I rejoined this Department advantage was taken of the simultaneous presence of Squire and Tymms in London to liold a meeting on various aspects of Civil Aviation affecting India, the Minutes of which I -enclose herewith. Part A, regard ing the proposed Indo-Afgban services is, I think, of the most immediate importance to us, and as you will see the meeting reached agreement on certain suggestions which you may care to consider. Tynans has already sent the Minutes in draft foxn (which does not differ materially from the present version) to his own Department for action. I am sending a copy of this letter with enclosure to Crichton. Yours sincerely, Sir Olai K. Caroo, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secret .ry to the Government of India in the External Affairs Departnent, New Delhi, India.A Meeting was held in the India Office on 23rd July, consider certain Civil Aviation matters affecting India., represent: _ _' 1 - 19 ^ 5 , to There were Sir Frederick lymms, Director of Civil Aviation, Government of India. • 1/Ir» G,F, Squire, H*M, Minister, Kabul. Mr* N.J.A, Cheetham Foreign Office Mr. W.¥. Burkett Ministry of Civil Aviation Mr. H.A.F, Rumbold, •• India Office Mr. D.M, Oleary India Office Mr, J*P. Ferris India Office A. Proposed Ledo-Afghfai Air Service ; V Mr, Squire explained that the Afghan Prime Minister had asked for a* detailed proposal for a joint Indo-Afghan service, and that the Government of India agreed that the discussions should be carried further, ^The Government of India, however, had only recently enabledthe Legation to put forward financial and technical,details^ and he doubted whether it was yet necessary to consider the allocation of aircraft. If any scheme was to be acceptable to the Afghan Government, a large share of the capital * cost or of any losses would have to be borne by the Government of India, although the operational costs might be less considerable than appeared at first sight, as there was every reason to hope that a weekly Peshawar- Kabul Service would carry a considerable number of passengers. Sir Frederick Tymms estimated the capital cost of service from Peshawar to Quetta via Kabul and Kandahar at Rs. 5 lakhs, exclusive of ground installations; a twice weekly service with Beechcraft Expeditors between Peshawar and Kabul as' an extension of the existing Calcutta-Peshawar service would only cost about Rs, 2-g- lakhs* 2. Mr, Rumbold said that while the Afghan Government primarily desired a circular service joining their four principal towns, Kabul, Mazar**!-Sharif. Herat, Kandahar, the Government of India aimed at an extension of the IJtf.A. Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul and that the^proposed Poshawar- Kabul-Kandahar-Que11a service was mere]y a means of helping the Afghans to agree to the Peshawar-Kabul link# It might help to ride the Afghans off their idea for a circular service, if estimates of the comparative cost of the circular service and of a peshawar-Quetta service could be prepared for the Afghan Government, and it oould be made clear to them at the same time that the former would be for them much the more expensive as the Government of India would not, of course, contribute. The proposals regarding the link service and the share of the cost to be borne by the Afghan Government should be explained to them at the same time, 3* Sir Frederick Tymms said that the Government of India had long determined on extending the Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul after the war. They would also be ready to consider a joint Indo-Afghan service between Quetta Kandahar# It might not be possible at the outset to achieve a regular service at all seasons, but Mr. Squire said the Afghans would not consider this a ‘serious drawback# A. • Mr. Squire emphasised that the Afghans would prefer to work with the Americans in accordance with their general policy of avoiding the.grant of concessions to their neighbours. It was for this reason that theywhad signed the Five Freedoms agreement at Chicago, although by the Prime Minister’s own confession they did not know to what they had conmitted themselves, §nd theyrhs.d spontaneously offered the Americans facilities to- 2 - cross their territory en route to China* They also thought that the Americans would undertake the necessary construction works in Afghanistan without cost to themselves k /ji Timerican route to Kabul would not pay its way as the Government' of India could restrict the extent to which it carried Fifth Freedom traffic to India and indeed could prevent it entering India over the North T/est Frontier - and i^' was desirable to make this clear to the Afghans. This might not, . however, prevent the Americans initiating a service terminating at Kabul. ; ‘ ' : ‘‘ •5* Aigainst Llr. Squire’s suggestion that we might secure American co-operation, it was emphasised that the competition between this country and the U.S.A. in the sphere of civil .aviation generally was very serious indeed and that the Americans would use for wider purposes any opening we helped them to obtain in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, however, we had the advantages of our connection with the Afghan Air Forte and Mr. Squire suggested that we “might perhaps let them have a few small transport planes for staff officers, to encourage air mindedness, as had been done in Persia. ' r 6 . ¥ith regard to personnel, under the .present proposals, the non- Afghan staff at the Kandahar and, Kabul airfields need not exceed half a dozen in all and the Government of India were willing to train Afghans to take over these positions eventually, 7. A necessary prerequisite of the service was a ground survey of the Kabul and Kandahar airfields. The Afghans might not readily agree to someone being sent up from India for this specific purpose, but the R.A.F, pilot instructor with the Afghan Air Force, or the R.A.F. staff - r _r officer, who is understood to be shortly proceeding to Kabul, could easily find opportunities to make the necessary survey. It was agreed that: the matter could usefully be pursued tentatively by' A. H.M, Legation, Kabul, with the Afghan Government, • without any attempt being made at this-stage to present them with cut aiid dried plans. Sir Frederick Tymms might have prepared in the ^ivil Aviation Department rough estimates of the comparative costs of the 'circular” and 'link” services and of the proportion to be borne by the Government of India, in respect of the latter. the suggestion should be put to the External Affairs Department that the Charge d f Affaires at Kabul be authorised to place these estimates before the Afghan Government at his discretion. the Government of India be asked to make arrangements for unofficial ground surveys of the Afghan airfields. B. Afghan refusal of transi t ri ghts for U.S.S.R . Sta linabad-Kho rog A i r Service Mr. iheetham referred to Katodontelegram No. 71 of 17th July, which reported the Afghan refusal, and transmitted a request from the Afghan Government for British advice. Mr. Rudbold suggested that it was a suit able opportunity to explain to the Afghan Government that the U.S.S.R., (i) (ii) (iii) (iv)- 3 - not being a party to the Two Freedoms .agreement were not entitled to transit rights in Afghanistan irlike India, in order thus to emphasise the difference between the Russian and the Indian position. Mr, Burkett said;that the request was far from unreasonable in itself. It was agreed that these .points might be made to the Afghan Government, 'it being made clear that we regarded the matter as entirely one for the Afghans to settle, .. ...... ;■ )f; r C, Proposed Survey of Air Route from India . to Baghdad via Zahidan and' Tehran Mr, Rumbold said that the proposal originated with the Government of‘ India, who had asked Air Transport Command (India) to provide a- military aircraft for the purpose. Sir Frederick Tymms sa;Ld that Air Transport Command had expressed their willingness to co-eperate as long ago as September, but it had proved necessary to consult the Air Ministry, who had refused to agree, on the ground that all suitable aircraft were required for first priority work. It was hoped that, this objection would not be insuperable as it might be the case that owing to the location of aircraft at particular times, a second priority job could perhaps be done without prejudice to first priority work. General Mayne has written to the Vice Chief of the Air Staff stressing the urgency of the project, as it must be completed while British military rights in Persia are retained. It was desirable to use a military rather than a civil aircraft, because this reduced both the necessity for obtaining Persain consent and the danger of Russian objection as they used nominally military aircraft on their service between Tehran and Meshed. 2. The Foreign Office has now asked Sir Reader Bullard at Tehran for his comments by telegraph, particularly on the question of consulting the Persian Government. If it were a question of obtaining their consent, the reasons for using a military aircraft were of course much diminished. 3. It was agreed that the replies to General Mnyne 1 s letter and to the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran must be awaited. If an air survey proved impracticable suggestion of a ground survey of the route might be made to the Government of India, D. Question of Regularising the Position of O.N.A,C, { s Services betv/'een India and China It was explained that C,N,A,C, originally obtained the right to fly a fixed number of services between certain airports in Burma and China in 1939 and that there were supplementary agreements in 1 S 42 , giving them rights at Indian airports. These rights are now being greatly exceeded, first in respect of the airfields from which the service was being operated, and secondly in respect of the number of services. Services had now reached the figure of approximately 2 a day (exclusive of military freight services for the U,S. forces in China, some of which were commercial in character) and were producing an average monthly revenue of nparly Rs.9 lakhs. The Government of India were considering whether it would not be advisable to regularise the position by negotiating a new agreement, 2. In the ensuing discussion, it was agreed that it was impossible to curtail traffic during wartime. It would be possible to negotiate a new agreement giving the Chinese such rights as war conditions may from time to time render desirable, subject to the retention by the Government of India of the right to terminate the arrangement at short notice and the repetition of India*s right to operate a reciprocal service when she wishes. But this negotiation might cause more trouble’ than it was^ T-Pl-I # ' l ■ , ■ ' ■' • T - - worth and the existing agreements were terminable'in respeot of India . at 3 months notice. It was agreed that on the whole, if would probably be easier to leave undisturbed the present informal arrangements. 3. Sir Frederick Tynans said that it was essential that India should obtain reciprocal rights on this very important route after the war. But they had no plans ready at present. -They must, have 'rights for a specifically Indian, not merely a British service. ISC*. Burkett thought that it would be preferable for the British Commonwealth to negotiate, when the time comes, as a unit with China in matters of civil aviation, so that all Commonwealth parties concerned got what each needed dut • of the Chinese. 4. ' It was agreed that the question of regularising the C.N.A.C. service should not be raised with the Chinese Government at this stage unless the Government of India particularly pressed the point.25th August, 1945 Dear Henderson, In continuation of Buimett’s letter of the 15th August, gag in reply to yours of 2nd August, E.5579/23/34 regarding airfields at Kirtnan, Sahidan, and M^rjawa, in Persia, this is to let you know that the B # 0 # A«C* state that it is unlikely that the airfields aientioned will ever be of great interest to the Corporation and they do not wish to depute anyone to accompany the Air Attache in his survey flight. of India is the only party interested, and I am sending a copy of this letter to Humbold.

Sir R. Bull aid's c cements are contained in his telegram 771 of 30th July, and the Foreign Office's views on this in their letter of 2nd August to the Air Ministry.

My dear Mayne, I much regret the delay in replying to your letter No.PSO/MISC/ 23 of ihe 22nd June, 1945 on the subject of the provision of a military aircraft for the survey of a civil air route between India and Persia. 2. There are still strong reasons which prevent us from meeting the Government of India* s wishes. The first is the continuing grave shortage of suitable aircraft in relation to our very large commitments. Another is the American reaction to any detected misuse of lease-lend aircraft. As you know, the large majority of our transport aircraft in S.E.A.C. are American types supplied under lease-lend arrangements, and it is possible that the Americans might seize on the use of a Dakota aircraft to survey a civil route through Persia to prove that our demands for the allocation of these aircraft for essential operational requirements were extravagant. Recently we have pressed them strongly to give their assent to the use of some 12 Dakota aircraft for operating on Indian civil air routes within India. After much argument they have agreed to this provided we will give a positive undertaking that these aircraft will only be employed to carry passengers and loads which otherwise would have to be carried in military aircraft. 3. ^ In addition we are informed that the Foreign Office see difficulties on political grounds in the employment of a military aircraft on the survey. We understand that they are making enquiries of the Ambassador at Tehran. 4* It would seem that the best course would be for the survey to be carried out by a civil aircraft after obtaining the permission of the Persians. If you were to adopt this suggestion you would no doubt wish to take up the matter with the Foreign Office direct. 5. I am very sorry that at present we are not able to be of more help. Yours sincerely. (Sd.) Douglas Svill. General Sir Mosley Mayne KGB., CBjii., DSO., India Office, Whitehall, S.W.l. ADC., f VeCp. I 24 JUL1945 f INDIA OFFICE '1945, to There were ^ m A Meeting was held in the India Office on 23rd July, consider certain Civil Aviation matters affecting India, present: Sx*.- Frederick lymras, Director of Civil Aviation, Government of India. Mr, H.A.F, Rumbold, India Office Mr. G.F. Squire, H.M. Mimister, Kabul. Mr. N.J.A. Cheetham Foreign Office Mr. W.W. Burkett Ministry of Civil Aviation Mr. D.M, Cleary India Office Mr. J.P. Ferris India Office A. Proposed Ij?do-Afghan Air Service Mr. Squire explained that the Afghan Prime Minister had asked for a detailed, proposal for a joint Indo-Afghan service, and that the Government of India agreed that the discussions should be carried further. The Government of India, however, had only recently enabledthe Legation to put forward financial and technical details, and he doubted whether it was yet necessary to consider the allocation of aircraft. If any scheme was to be acceptable to the Afghan Government, a large share of the capital v. cost &amp; of any losses would have to be borne by the Government of India, although the operational costs might be less considerable than appeared at first sight, as there was every reason to hope that a weekly Peshawar- Kabul Service would carry a considerable number of passengers. Sir Frederick Tymms estimated the capital cost of service from Peshawar to Quetta via Kabul and Kandahar at Rs, 3 lakhs, exclusive of ground ins-tallations; a twice weekly service with Beechcraft Expeditors between Peshawar and Kabul as an extension of the existing Calcutta-Peshawar service would only cost about Rs. 2-g- lakhs. 2. Mr, Rumbcld said that while the Afghan Government primarily desired a circular service joining their four principal towns, Kabul, Mazarti-Sharif, Herat, Kandahar, the Government of India aimed at an extension of the Xdtf.A. Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul and that the^proposed Peshawar- Kabul-Kandahar-Quetta service was merely a means of helping the Afghans to agree to the Peshawar-Kabul link. It might help to ride the Afghans off their idea for a circular service, if estimates of the comparative cost of the circular service and of a peshawar-Quetta service could be prepared for the Afghan Government, and it could be made clear to them at the same time that the former would be for them much the more expensive as the Government of India would not, of course, contribute. The proposals regarding the link service and the share of the cost to be borne by the Afghan Government should be explained to them at the same time, 3 * Sir Frederick Tymms said that the Government of India had long determined on extending the Calcutta-Peshawar service to Kabul after the war. They would also be ready to consider a joint Indo-Afghan service between ue a and Kandahar. It might not be possible at the outset to achieve a regular service at all seasons, but Mr. Squire said the Afghans would not consider this a serious drawback, Mr. Squire emphasised that the Afghans world prefer to work with the Americans in accordance with their general policy of avoiding the grant of concessions to their neighbours. It was for this reason that they had signed the Five Freedoms agreement at Chicago, although by the Prime Minister’s own confession they did not know to what they had comnitted themselves, and they^had spontaneously offered the Americans facilities to i j ■ ■ ' r -• 'cross their territory en route to China. They also thought that the Americans would undertake the necessary construction works in Afghanistan without cost to themselves* .an American route to Kabul would not pay its way as the Government' of India could restrict the extent to which it carried Fifth Freedom traffiw to India and indeed could prevent it entering India over the North West Frontier i- and it was desirable to make this clear to the Afghans, fhis might not, however, prevent the Americans initiating a service terminating at Kabul. Against Mr. Squire’s suggestion, that we might secure American co-operation, it was emphasised that the competition between this country and the U.S.A. in the sphere of civil aviation generally was very serious indeed and that the Americans would use for wider purposes any opening we helped them to obtain in Afghanistan. In Afghanistan, however, we had the advantages of our connection with the Afghan Air For*e and Mr. Squire suggested that we might perhaps let them have a few small transport planes for staff officers, to encourage air mindedness, as had been done in Persia* 6 . With regard to personnel, under the present proposals the non- Afghan staff at the Kandahar and Kabul airfields need not exceed half a dozen in all and the Government of India were willing to train Afghans to take over these positions eventually. 7* A necessary prerequisite of the service was a ground survey of the TEabul and Kandahar airfields. The Afghans might not readily agree to someone being sent up from India for this specific purpose, but the H.A.F, pilot instructor with the Afghan Air Force, or the R.A.F. staff officer, who is understood to be shortly proceeding to Kabul, could easily find opportunities to make the necessary survey* It was agreed that: (i) the matter could usefully be pursued tentatively by H.M. Legation, Kabul, with the Afghan Government, without any attempt being made at this stage to present them with cut and dried plans. (ii) Sir Frederick jtymms might have prepared in the ^ivil Aviation Department rough estimates of the comparative costs of the 'circular” and 'link” services and‘of the proportion to be borne by the Government of India in respect of the latter. (iii) the suggestion should be put to the External /iffairs Department that the Charge d f Affaires at Kabul be authorised to place these estimates before the Afghan Government at his discretion, (iv) the Government of India be asked to make arrangements for unofficial ground surveys of the Afghan airfields. B. Afghan refusal of transit rights for U.S.S.R . Stal inabad-Kh orog Air Service Mr. •heetham referred to Katodcntelegram No* 71 of 17th July, which reported the Afghan refusal, and transmitted a request from the Afghan Government for British advice* Mr. Rurabold suggested that it was a suit able opportunity to explain to the Afghan Government that the U*S.s.R., - 2 - —not being a party to the Two Freedoms Agreement were not entitled to^ transit rights in Afghanistan ir.lijce India, in order thus to emphasise the difference between the Russian and the Indian position. Mr* Burkett said that the request was far from unreasonable in itself* It was agreed that these points might be made to the Afghan Government, it ^eing made clear that we regarded the matter as entirely one for the Afghans to settle* C, Proposed Survey of Air Route from India to Baghdad via Zahidan and Tehran Mr. Rumbold said that the proposal originated with the Government of India, who had asked Air Transport Command (India) to provide a military aircraft for the purpose. Sir Frederick Tymms said that Air Transport Command had expressed their willingness to co-cperate as long ago as September, 1944, but it had proved necessary to consult the Air Ministry, who had refused to agree, on the ground that all suitable aircraft were required for first priority work. It was hoped that this objection would not be insuperable as it might be the case that owing to the location of aircraft ait particular times, a second priority job could perhaps be done without prejudice to first priority v/ork. General Mayne has written to the Vice Chief of the Air Staff stressing the urgency of the project, as it must be completed while British military rights in Persia are retained. It was desirable to use a military rather than a civil aircraft, because this reduced both the jiecessity for Obtaining Persain consent and the danger of Russian objection as they used nominally military aircraft on their service between Tehran and Meshed. 2. The Foreign Office has now asked Sir Reader Bullard at Tehran for his comments by telegraph, particularly on the question of consulting the Persian Government. If it were a question of obtaining their consent, the reasons for using a military aircraft were of course much diminished. 3. It was agreed that the replies to General Mayne's letter and to the Foreign Office telegram to Tehran must be awaited. If an air survey proved impracticable suggestion of a ground survey of the route might be made to the Government of India, D. Question of Regularising the Position of O.N.A.C.*3 Services between India and China It was explained that G,N*A.C* originally obtained the right to fly a fixed number of services between certain airports in Burma and China in 1939 and that there were supplementary agreements in 1942, giving them rights at Indian airports. These rights are now being greatly exceeded, first in respect of the airfields from which the service was being operated, and secondly in respect of the number of services. Services had now reached the figure of approximately 2 a day (exclusive of military freight services for the U.S. forces in China, some of which were commercial in character) and were producing an average monthly revenue of nearly Rs.9 lakhs* The Government of India were considering whether it would not be advisable to regularise the position by negotiating a new agreement, 2, In the ensuing discussion, it was agreed that it was impossible to curtail traffic during wartime. It would be possible to negotiate a new agreement giving the Chinese such rights as war conditions may from time to time render desirable, subject to the retention by the Government of India of the right to terminate the arrangement at short notice and the repetition of Indians right to operate a reciprocal service when she wishes. But this negotiation might cause more trouble than it was iworth and the existing agreements were terminable in respect of India at 3 months notice. It was agreed that on the whole it would probably be easier to leave undisturbed the present informal arrangements. 3* Sir Frederick lymms said that it was essential that India should obtain reciprocal rights on this very important route after the war* But they had no plans ready at present. They must have rights for a specifically Indian,not merely a British service. ISr. Burkett thought that it would be preferable for the British Commonwealth to negotiate, v/hen the time comes, as a unit with China in matters of civil aviation, so that all Commonwealth parties concerned got what each needed out of the Chinese* 4. It was agreed that the question of regularising the C*N.A,C* service should not be raised with the Chinese Government at this stage unless the Government of India particularly pressed the point.worth and the existing a, at 3 months notice.

Such an air service would, in their view, serve important political ends and would certainly have commercial Value in the encouragement of direct contacts between India, Persia and Iraq. Prom the political point of view, it might also offset the advantages which the Russians have obtained from the establishment of a civil air service under military 7 guise between Tabriz and leshed. 2. The opening up of such a route was one of the recommendations made in a memorandum dated September, 1944, by the Air Attache to H.M. Embassy, Tehran, on the subject of the future of air transport in Persia. The proposals in the Air Attache's memorandum were endorsed by H.M. Ambassador. 3» Last winter the Government of India asked South East Asia Command to arrange a preliminary reconnaissance flight of the route, making use of our wartime military rights in Persia. The matter wrb referred to Transport Oonmand but the latter replied that the Air Council did not consider that the survey should be carried out in present oircimstanoes in view of the acute shortage of transport aircraft. The matter was taken up by the India Office with the Air Ministry in March of this year, but the latter maintained the vie*v that not oven a single aircraft could be spared for a survey.

For some time the Government of India have been anxious to get a survey made of t^e possible route for a civil air service between India and Persia., The idea has met with considerable support from our people in Persia, as you will see frcm the typed note below. Progress with the idea has, however, been held up owing to the inability of the Air Ministry to make the necessary arrangements, the main ground apparently being the shortage of aircraft. The correspondence took place before V.E.Day and we were contemplating a further approach to the Air Ministry. Doubts, however, have been expressed whether a further approach on a departmental level will succeed, and a suggestion was made in Brigadier Reynold’s note of the 15th that possibly the ground might be cleared by an approach to the Air Staff direct. In order to enable you to sound out the ground, the attached typed Memorandum has been prepared by the External Department and if an approach by you on the lines suggested seems promising, we will follow it up with a letter to the Air Ministry. I think you will agree that your approach at this stage would be on a semi-official or more or less personal level. C-K. P.s. I understand that you are temporarily away from the Office, hut after consulting the Department I though it best to keep the papers for your return.

The A ir inis try state that the work now being done on ~~— . . /ta airfield is on a limited scale, while the work on the 0 &amp; ,, , „ j on this ^ iau Kerman-Zahidan road is only low-grade maintenance. With regard to the future of these three airfields, ^ the Air Ministry do not feel that there is a military case (A for maintaining them. They point out, however, that the future of the airfields is of interest to the Government of India (whom they have consulted in the matter) in view of the possibility that the latter may wish to develop air routes from India to Tehran and from India to Bagdad across Persia, and to the Civil Aviation Department here, which, having under consideration plans for British participation in a Persian air transport company operating services into India, have asked for these airfields to be maintained until they know whether their plans are going to come to anything. It certainly seems desirable that these airfields should be kept up in case they are needed for future civil air routes, but it does not necessarily follow that the maintenance must be carried out by the British military or air forces. It might be preferable, in view of the political CQnsi.d*rations which you naention, to arrange ior their upkeep by the Persian authorities with British or Indian assistance. Ve should therefore like to know whether you think that any scheme for the maintenance of these airfields by the Persians, with British or Indian technical assistence, oan be worked out which could be proposed to the Departments interested in British and Indian civil srviation as meeting their requirements. be should also like to know if you think that it is necessary in the interests of civil aviation to keep up both the Zahidan and the Mirjawa airfields which are so close to one another.

I am afraid there is no background we can supply to the decision we gave to Transport jotTiinand in this matter, expect to repeat that we have not enough transport aircraft for the'-war and consequently we cannot allow an aircraft to be diverted to reconnoitre a route for&gt;civil aviation. We do not understand why the Government of India finds this unconvincing.

The question of civil air service’s between Persia and India also discussed on much the same lines in Tehran Despatch of 29th September,-see in particular Appendix 3» In his subsequent Despatch of 10th October, Sir R. Bullard recommended that immediate attention should be given to the recommendations in paragraph 11 of Air Attache's memorandum. Sub-paragraph(v). of this paragraph recommended that negotiations between H.M.G. and the Persian Government should be associated with a simultaneous approach by the Government of India, aimed at opening up a route from India to Tehran for an Indian concern, using the airfields already provided. Although Sir Reader Bullard stressed the desirability of a speedy decision, the Foreign Office seem to have taken little, if any,action so far. It would seem necessary to arrive at some decision in principle on the questions raised in the Tehran Despatches referred to, before,., any decision is takeru; whether to maintain or abandon the three airfields.* It is perhaps inprobable that we shall need all three for civil aviation purposes, but which we shall need^will be a matter for consideration.

As agreed, I think it would be better if you handled these papers as they concern the external relations of India with I'ersia and as you are already dealing with the question of the retention or withdrawal of British troops from Tehran. I also agree that as ‘'“'this subject will concern both the External and Military Departments of the Government of India that it would be preferable to send your telegram to the Viceroy as suggested. I am not competent to discuss the political factors involved in the retention of the airfields at Zahidan and Mirjawa but I have the following comments from a strategic and commercial aspect which may help to provide background for the subsequent solution of this problem. ^rom the strategic aspect there is little doubt that, in considering the T, raajor danger” to the defence of India in the post-war period, the retention of established airfields in this area will be most desirable,and I am of the opinion that the Commander in Chief will confirm tnTsJJ and recommend their retention. From the commercial aspect, as yet almost undeveloped, it appears likely that airfields in this area may provide useful stepping-stones jxFTa commercial and mail air route from Iraq - Tehran to Baluchistan and India, and I think on these grounds that the retention of these airfields, even if only as emergency airfields, will be of considerable value. In pressing any case for their retention I suggest we should officially concentrate on the commercial a pect as being less likely to offend other countries concerned. Under these circumstances it may well be necessary for these airfields to be nominally under Persian control* t»tit^concessions granted to what ever air line is responsible, for the necessary installations at these places.MWL/DMTS JLj$ Y 3 , H/Extii !

I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, The Under-Secretary of State, India Office, S.W.l.COPY WHITEHALL,S.WJ 10th January,1945. V • I was much obliged to you for your ieT,T,ei the 4th January drawing my attention to the construction and maintenance of airfields in South East Persia, On receiving your letter I at once had enquiries made in the Air Ministry* Zahidan and Mirjawah, which have been completed, were part of a scheme for the close defence of North West India against a possible German threat. Most of the airfields included in this scheme were abandoned after the threat had receded but three of them, including Zahidan and Mirjawah, were completed because considerable work had already been undertaken on them. The airfield at Kerman was started at the request of Air Headquarters India to facilitate communications between The Rt.Hon. Anthony Eden, M.C.,M.P., /Teheran Foreign Office,Teheran and India. The work nov; being done on this • airfield is on a limited scale, probably of a care and maintenance nature. Authority has been given for loy^.y grade maintenance on the road Kerman to Zahidan and we are rather surprised at the suggestion in signal No.1345 that this maintenance s being carried out ”at great cost'. I do not myself feel that there is a strong military case for keeping up any of these three airfields. Before any decision could be given to abandon them, however, we shall have to consult the Government of India. I have, therefore, asked my Staff to arrange for this consultation to take place and I will write to you again as soon as I know the outcome. (Sgd). Archibald Sinclair. -COPY PORBIGN OFFICE, (E 7717/1175/G) S.W.1. 4 th January,194 5• My dear Archie, ^ ^ I should be grateful for your observations on Tv itran telegram No. 1345, of which I enclose a copy, about the construction and maintenance of airfields in South-East Persia. I should in particular b e glad to know v/hether the airfields in this area do in fact constitute a vital link in our air communications with India and the Far Bast. My impression v/as that all air traffic to these destinations was being routed through the Persian Gulf. The remarks in the second paragraph of Bullard’s telegram have much force. It is an important object of our policy toget the Russians to withdraw their troops from Persia as soon as military conditions permit a corresponding withdray/al on our side. By the same token, 7 /e clearly stand to defeat our own ends if we create any avoidable suspicion on the Soviet side as regards our own intentions. The construction of airfields at tnis stage of the y/ar in an area which has never formed part of our zone of occupation can only be expected to arouse considerable suspicition in the Soviet mind. If there is a strong military case for maintaining these airfields, I should therefore like to be in a position to explain it to the Russians, should the need arise. If, on the other hand, the airfields are only being maintained in case they should prove a useful stand-by, or because money has already been spent on them, it is likely that their continued maintenance would hardly prove to be justifiable. In any case, v/e should not be able to continue the military /use The Rt. Hon. Sir Archibald Sinclair,Bt., KT., GMG., M.P..use of Persian airfields indefinitely.

IMPORTANT TOP SECRET My telegram No.1324 not repeated to Government of India. Military attache at His Majesty’s Embassy has drawn my attention to another matter which may well have excited Soviet suspicion as to our motives viz: continuation of work on airfields in East Persia long after they could have been required for use against possible German invasion of Persia. Mirjawa and Zahidan airfields are finished but ’work’ still goes on at Kerman and the road from Zahidan to Kerman is being maintained at great cost as a service road. The explanation given to His Majesty’s Embassy by South ^ast .^sia Air Command viz. ''Airfields originally provided for tactical use against German threat ’but will’ now be available as communication airfields for most direct air route to the middle of Europe' might not reassure the Soviet Government. The Soviet Military Attache recently visited ’Kerman and* Zahidan and I take it for granted that these airfields v/ere among the ’chief objects of interest’ to him. 2. Cases are not lacking where actions which seemed innocent enough to the doers aroused profound suspicion in the Soviet mind, e.g. attempts made by various officers /and • • • •parties in the first year of occupation to enter into the Soviet 'Zone' to make surveys or reconnaissances. Moreover as you are aware inspired defenders of the Soviet Governments demand for an oil concession represent it as prompted by manoeuvres of capitalist concession hunters in Persia. However mistaken and even dishonest the Soviet accusations in such matters may be, we should I suggest, considep&amp;eriously all possible causes of suspicion with a view to their elimination or diminution wherever possible. . * 4I*/ Foreign Office please repeat to Government of India as my telegram No.428.

If there is any traffic at all in Persia, then both routes need services and the operation of a^good air air service combind with reasonable shipping services will tend to route the Persian Gulf ports and present all trade going towards the north). as to aerodromes Kerman and Zaidan have been constructed for India.

I think you will find them not uninteresting reading* The matter was not one which we discussed in so many words at the meeting that was held at Teheran when I was there, but I mentioned it to the Ambassador and it also figured in a note on the Middle East countries around the Persian Gulf as seen from the Indian angle which I gave to him to read when I was there. 2* The minutes are, I think, more or less self-explanatory and I need not add very much except to say that I have since discussed the matter with the Viceroy who had particularly taken note of the introduction of a measure of civil aviation by the Russians on the route Tabriz - Teheran - Meshed under cover of a military service, and had wondered what could be done to offset this development. We had for sometime had in mind here endeavours after the war to extend Indian Civil Aviation via Kabul, Meshed and Teheran to Baghdad, but on that route there are two very difficult doors to unlock for which it is likely to take a long time to find the right key, and these are the Afghan reluctance to open their country to civil aviation and the Russian attitude at Meshed which was brought into relief by their refusal to let me fly to Meaaed theus think of the route mentioned in the minutes Tie Kerman* minutes to you and to Thompson in Baghdad and obtain your -ly comnents on the proposal general/and in particular as to Persian reactions to the introduction of civil aviation^ if 3. There are only two points that I need add at the present *1 atage. The first is of course that from the Indian angle the whole case will depend on the availability of aircraft. If aircraft should become available and Persian reactions were likely to be favourable, we have little doubt that Indian Civil Aviation would be interested in the project. As regards priority, inter-relation of such a service with the development of internal service^ within India would of course need careful consideration and this is a point which you will find mentioned in the minutes. 4. 7/e are asking you separately if any information can be given on a matter reported in a recent Bushire Intelligence bunrnary regarding the opening of a Persian Air Service between Teneran and Bushire, but^if there is really any hope of such a service coming into being, the proposals in the minutes would no doubt have to be related to that service in some degree. I am sending a copy of this letter to Thompson in Baghdad and to Peel in the India Office.

D. 83 04/15/44 of July 8t h^ which^I have taken rather a long time to answer as the Air Attache, whom I was anxious to consult, was laid*up. It was certainly most unreasonable and annoying of the Russians to prevent your going to Meshed. Unfortunately, they are generally unreasonable ana annoying, in Persia at any rate. Y/e did not pursue the question further with therp after you left, feeling that there was no point in doing so; and they never In fact informed us that permission had come through - possibly for the same reason. If I were to,take up the at ter how with them, it is quite safe to asstymp they would not admit to having delayed things 1 111 171' 1 1 iiiih i iVJ^ 1 1 1 I I less to having definitely decided to keep you out. Their answer would be some variation on the well-worn theme* of 'unavoidable delays in communications'; and that would get us no further, as they would not hesitate to do the same thing again. I think the real point is that on this particular occasion they had the excuse of short notice. If an Indian air line ever were in operation via Meshed, and you applied in good time for permission to visit that tov/n, they would find it very difficult to refuse, and probably would not dare to do so, knov/ing that pressure would be brought to bear on them in Moscow if necessary. But they v/ould take their time about it, as they always do. It is only on the rarest occasions that we manage to get a quick decision out of them here. We quite agree, of course, that an Indian lin e through Kabul to Baghdad v/ould be an excellent tiling. (incidentally we are encouraging the Persians ultimately to run a modest internal service from here to Isfahan, Yezd, Kerman and the Indian railhead at Zahidan; this service, if it ever got going, would not, we feel, be a serious competitor, but we understand that British Airways are also toying with the idea of a through service via North Persia and Afghanistan to India). But as long as the war lasts (plus six months thereafter) negotiations with the Russians on a very high level v/ould of course be required for any use of meshed; and to judge by our failure to secure permission to run a through line to Moscow via Tehran we do not feel that the outlook is too hopeful. The Russians are even averse from allowing an occasional'British plane into their sphere; when the Polish Prime Minister and his party came through here the,other day on a Liberator, for example, the Russians firmly transhipped them into a special Soviet Machine for the onward journey northward, and the same sort of thing has often happened before. In short, a rather radical change of Soviet heart and policy is the prior condition, and this can only be engineered, if at all, by pressure applied in Moscow by the Air Ministry and Foreign Office. Meanwhile, as our recent reports have shown, the whole tendency of the Russians here is to increase the restrictions on access to their zone. From six months from the termination of hostilities (we think that the Russians are unlikely, on the whole, to cut down that period as a voluntary gesture) we should, in theory at least, have to deal with the Persians only. I cannot help ir Olaf Caroe, K. C. I. E. , G. G. I. , K, a. , Secret try to the Government of India in the External Affairs department.

The consensus of opinion here is that the Persians, once the Allied occupation is over, are going to be extremely tough and unpleasant - especially where they can' be reasonably sure of Russian backing. It is difficult to foresee exactly whal? cards we shall tien have in our hand. They ought , of c'ourse, to welcome the provision of through air connections with the jjast; but, to pudge by recent Persian history, they are pust as .likely to adopt a xenophobic attitude, knowing that westward air com. .unications with Europe (which are' what, really ihterest them) can always be assured, v/ith Tragi consent, by running a service of their own to Baghdad. I'm afraid this is^ all’ rather gloomy, but we do not honestly.feel that our chances of turning either the present Russian key or the post-v/ar Persian one are particularly bright. On the other hand we have no information concern ing the general'policy of His ilagesty's Government in regard to post-war civil air' lines, and it may be that progress has been made with the Soviet Government of which we know # nothing.

A New Delhi. 8th July Tfic' I have been reminded'* of the Huseian procrastination in giving an answer to the re^utjst that I should be allowed to fly in an R.A.F. aircraft to Meshed by seeing papers here dealing with a scheme for extension of Indian air lines across Afghan istan via Meshed and Teheran and eventually to Baghdad. A passage of this kind, if only we could turn the two difficult keys, that is to say the Afghan key and the Russian key in Meshed, would bo a very profitable and useful extension of Indianair activities over neighbouring countries. But it is not much use getting down to business with the Afghans or ^jaybody else, if we are to be permanently kept out of Meshed by the Russians. J 2* Wa wonder whether it might not bo sorth while to pursue with the Russian Embassy the matter of their refusal in effect v - I to allow me to be flown to Meshed. It may be that the perniission came just after Pilditch and I had left Teheran but, even if this were so, it would always bo open to question whether Ikst it had not been deliberately delayed until the Russians knew that advantage could not be taken of their agreement.

Dear Peel O With reference to your letter (Ext.6270/41) dated 10th October to Herbertson regarding the possibility of operating some of the K.L.M. services along the eas tern side of the Persian Gulf, we are in some doubt as to •HhlT practicability of this at the present time as we do not know whether the aerodromes along this coast have been maintained since Air Prance and K.L.M. ceased operating on this route nor whether the wireless and meteorological arrangements still exist. Until information on these points is available we could not consider asking K.L.II. to operate along this route. provide a report concerning these matters after undertaking a survey flight along this coast with the D.C.2. aircraft which is at present being operated between Karachi and Basra. Given this information we should be prepared to put the proposal to K.L.M. but we should not feel disposed to press them to return to the east coast of the Gulf as it was one of the conditions of our latest arrangement with them for an additional service that they should be permitted to use the Arabian side of the Gulf.

We understand that the Air Ministry’s view, in which the Foreign Office concurs, is that the right to fly everywhere over Persia for any purpose is implicit in the position we are now occupying in that country as a result of military operations, and that there is therefore no need to instruct H.m. oJC Minister ^Tehran to approach the Persian Government v/ith a view to obtaining their explicit permission; and we have so informed the Government of India.

No. 119 Kabul No. 9 Government of India No. 130 IMMEDIATE JJJJJJ Proposal is under discussion here to run an air service from BagdaRL to Tehran with possible extensfons to Baku and Kabul. Main object would be on political and strategic grounds to increase British influence, means of penetration and communication. (a) Service should preferably be British. (b) If this is not acceptable to Iran (Persian) Government, service might be run under Egyptian flag by new joint Anglo-Bgyptian Company to be formed with majority of Egyptian capital but most flying personnel would still be British. (c) It might be more convenient to run the service under Iraq cover company bv similar Anglo-Iraqi company. If Iran air service operates or has right to operate to Iraq, an Iraq company could claim the right to operate to Iran. (d) If none of these are possible, we should consider whether we could work with Iran civil air organisation by forming joint company, lending material and personnel or pooling services. (e) Existing A.I.O.C. charter service might be very greatly expanded. 2. Please let me have your viev/s urgently on likelihood of Iranian Government agreeing to any of the above alternatives. It is not (repeat not) suggested that you should sound Iranian Government at this stage. 3. Please add your observations on the following additional points:~ (1) Any such air service, particularly if extended to Baku or Kabul, would presumably require improved grounds of organisation in Iran, wireless, meteorological etc. Mould Iranian Government agree to this being done by us or under one of the covers mentioned, or could they do it themselves.(2) Would Iranian Government be likely (a) to ask foT. (b) to make use of reciprocal facilities for air services to British Egyptian or Iraqi territory, and if so, would their running such services be dangerous owing to German influence in their civil aviation? If we only asked for transit facilities they also could only ask for transit facilities over allied territories v/hich might be an advantage. (3) Are Iranian Government likely to agree to immediate test flight by British aircraft to Baku or Kabul via Tehran?</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000240_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/2038</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000240</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/2038</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 5/76 ‘Proposed inauguration of a Baghdad-Tehran air service with possible extension to Kabul &amp; Baku; Civil air route between India &amp; Persia (Retention of RAF airfields)’</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1941/1947</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-12-16T23:13:30</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (181 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the last folio with 182; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file is concerned with proposals for the development of civil aviation services connecting Iran (frequently referred to as Persia) with Iraq and India. It therefore includes correspondence related to proposed aerial surveys of possible routes. The question of whether three airfields at Zahidan, Mirjarah, and Kerman – built in consequence of the Anglo-Soviet occupation of Iran – should be retained for future civil use is also addressed by some of the correspondence.Some of the material in the file examines the interest of the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States in Iranian civil aviation.A report titled ‘Air Transport in Persia – 1944 and afterwards’ by Walter Leslie Runciman, Air Attaché at Tehran, has been included: see folios 119-129. An accompanying map illustrating proposed and existing air routes can be found on folio 130. The file also includes a couple of sketch maps: see folios 103 and 143.The most recent correspondence in the file is concerned with the re-establishment of British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) services in 1946 between the United Kingdom (UK) and Tehran.The main correspondents are as follows: HM Ambassador to Iran (Sir Reader William Bullard), officials of the Air Ministry, officials of the Foreign Office, officials of the India Office, and representatives of the External Affairs Department of the Government of India.There is a gap in the file for the years 1942-43 for which no papers have been included.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Attaché, Tehran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">author</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Airlines</topic></subject><subject><topic>Landing grounds</topic></subject><subject><topic>Anglo-Soviet occupation of Iran (1941-1946)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">recipient</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Ambassador to Iran</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Overseas Airways Corporation</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Iran</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Second World War (1939-1945)</topic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000240#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
