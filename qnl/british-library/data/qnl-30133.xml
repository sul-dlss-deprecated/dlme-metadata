T e Sultan apparently was. ratner annoyed when he .first learnt that the Foreign Office had esfed for a detailed case to be made out for the supply of .303 ammunition to Muscat. I explained the situation to him when I saw him and told him that we were preparing for war, though I hoped there would not be one, and that as stocl.s of ammunition were short we had to make uite sure that Muscat T s need was a real one before we supplied any. Subsequently, Mr. oods-Ballard informed ne that the Sultan had agreed that he should make out a case in consul tation with Major Chauncy. T'eanwhile, they are trying to obtain ammunition from the Government of India. They do not propose to make any approach to A.H. ' itchell &amp; Com pany as their ammunition, if they still have any, is probably very old.RESTRICTED. BRITISH RESIDENCY BAHRAIN. 1191/6 16th March, 1951. Please refer to your telegram No.36 of the 10th March about the ammunition due to the Muscat Government under the Civil Air Agreement. I enclose a copy of a letter from Purlonge and of my reply. I will discuss the matter further with you when I come to Muscat, but should be grateful in the meanwhile if you can see how strong a case you can make out for the supply of the balance of the ammunition on political and strategical grounds on the lines suggested by Furlonge. Major P.C.L Chauncy, Political Agent Muscat.A BRITISH RESIDENCY RESTRICTED BAHRAIN 1191/5 16th March, 1951 In your letter EA 1192/4 of the 23rd February you have written about the supply of small arms ammunition for the Muscat Infantry. I trust that arrangements v/ill in any case be made for the very early supply of the 10,000 rounds due under the Air Agree ment as this is an obligation which we can hardly evade. The Muscat Government have, in fact, protested against a request which they received through Kendall for precise details of the purposes for which this ammunition (as well as the other ammunition) is required, and have stated that they feel that such a request should not have been made in respect of this particular ammunition as its supply has been guaranteed by H.M.G. 2 . I will enquire into the purposes for which the rest of the ammunition is required during my forthcoming visit to Muscat and let you have my recommendations. (W.R. Hay) G.W. Furlonge, Esq., C.M.G. , O.B.E. , Foreign Office, London, S.W.l.(EA 1192A) ^ISTiOCTED FOREIGN OFFICE, S.W.1• ' 23r*d February, 1951 Charles Kendall and Partners have asked us recently for support in obtaining from the V/ar Office certain aianunition requirements for the Muscat Infantry. &lt;7e understand that l^endall’s have applied for 120,000 rounds . 303 &gt; 1,000 rounds .45 revolver, 1,000 rounds # 303 tracer, and small quantities of other ammunition. This is in addition to the 10,000 rounds small arms ammunition which we are required to supply under the Air Agreement, and which is supplied by the Air Ministry. 2. The jar Office have rejected the application on the ground that no ammunition is available from War Office Surplus Stocks, and we have told Kendall’s that in the circumstances, and on the iniox-ma ion at r;resent available, we do not feel able to ask the ..ar Office to reconsider the application. 3. It is in fact most unlikely that the /ar Office would consider meeting this requirement, which would have to come out of their own s tocks, unless we were able to ut forward a strong case on political and strategical grounds preferably based on a speci-i a. request x‘or assistance from the Muscat Government. We are doubtful whether a case co^ld be made out, but it is possible that the Mu cat Infantry have local defence plans for .hich they wish to lay inreserve supply of ammunition., If this is so, we should be glad to know whether you consider that there are strong enough grounds on which to support the application. (L.A.C. Fry) Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Rupert hay, K.C.I.E. , C.S.I., Bahrain.Telegram 'R' No. 37, PRIORITY, Restricted. Your telegram No. 36* I have taken action but before arrival of your telegram I had received letter from Eastern Department regarding other ammunition ordered through Kendall. They state that it is unlikely that War Office will meet this requirement unless we are able to put forward a strong case on political and strategical grounds preferably based on a specific request for assistance from Puscat Government. Please try and make out such a case and discuss with me during my tour.
