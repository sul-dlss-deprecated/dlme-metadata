That His Majesty’s Government expect the Shaikh to take all reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own frontier, (paragraph 2 (b)U The letter goes on to explain (paragraph 2 (c)) that His Majesty's Government propose to assist the Shaikh through the Royal Air Force, while para graph 2 (d) covers the air facilities which His Majesty's Government expect should be put at their disposal. It was stated in India Office telegram Ho .585 of the 2nd March 1934 that two landing grounds would be required. In my letter the number is not specified: so if more are necessary they can be used. The last part of paragraph 2 (d) covers the visits of aircraft and Officers to Qatar whenever the Air Officer Commanding considers necessary, while the last sentence of this paragraph covers Intelligence activities on the part of the Royal Air Force. 3 3o Letter Ho.2 recapitulates all the points in connection with jurisdiction. Paragraph 6 limits His Majesty's Govern ment’s support in internal affairs to difficulties arising from the presence of the Oil Company. The last sentence of this paragraph was inserted at the Shaikh’s request and is innocuous. Paragraph 7 mentions what is of course obvious that the arrangements entered into are subject to the Oil Concession being given to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. 4. Letter Ho .3 is from Hamad promising to accept on his accession the Treaty of 1916. 5. Letter Ho .4 is to the Shaikh suggesting that the Treaty of 1916 should be converted into an heirs and successors one, and in letter Ho.5 the Shaikh agrees.-3- 6 . Letter No .6 is from Mr. Ivlylles . Mr. Mylles informed me that the Shaikh insisted on this alteration at the last moment, and has doubtless reported fully to his Company. The effect ol this alteration may be to exclude interests other than the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, e.g. the Ir&amp;q Petroleum Company. However that is a matter for the Company to settle. 7. The delay of 2 or 3 days in signing the Commercial Agreement, referred to in paragraph 3 of my telegram quoted above, was due to the following attitude taken by the Shaikh, which illustrates the almost childish suspicious nature of himself and his son Hamad. At my final interview with him, when I settled our political points,! suggested that the Commercial Agreement should now be signed with Mr. Mylles. The Shaikh said: *No. He wanted his payment-on-signature before he actually signed*. I suggested that Mr .Mylles could telegraph to the bank in Bahrain, and the latter could then wire the Shaikh that the money had been put to his credit. The Shaikh replied ’that this would never do. How could he know if the telegram from Bahrain really came from the bank ? The Company might send the telegram themselves in the name of the bank ani not deposit the money at all • He - the Shaikh - would have to send a man of his own to ascertain that the money was really in the bank*. Finally it was agreed that Mr. Mylles would telegraph to the bank and the Shaikh’s man would be sent to Bahrain to oring back the credit note and show it to the Shaikh. 8 . Some of Mr. lilies'difficulties in dealing with such an individual may be imagined and as I have already saia m paragraph 11 of my telegram Ho.372 of 22nd April ^935 he/c?onducted his negotiations with much patience, tact and skill.

Chas* Mylies• DOHA. Qatar • 11th May 1936.P•Z.3226/1935• At the end of last month after lengthy negotiations With the Sheikh of Q,atr, Mr. Mylles, the representative of the A.P.O.C., who has been negotiating for an oil concession in ftatr on behalf of the Company, reported that agreement had been reached with the Sheikh but that the latter wished to delay the actual signature of the concession until agreement had been reached between hime' and H.M.G. (P.Z.3051/35). The Political Eesident thereup proceeded to Q,atr at the beginning of this month with a view to reaching a final settlement of the points still outstanding between H.M.G. and the Sheikh after Colonel Howie's previous discussions with the Sheikh in April, the results of which were reported in his telegram Ho.372 of 22nd April at P.Z.2854/35. The main questions to be settled with the Sheikh (other than the Sheikh's acceptanci oi the terms of the Government Agreement as overriding, in cases of inconsistency, the terms of the Commercial Agreement - see below) were the protection to be afforded by H.M.G. to the Sheikh in the event of his granting a i j concession to the A.P.O.C. and the jurisdiction to be surrendered to H.M.G. by the Sheikh over British subjects and protected persons and non-Muslim foreigners in the sam^ event. Colonel Powle now reports in his telegram No.T.13' of 11th May (P. Z.3281/35) that he has reached agreement with the Sheikh on the following lines:- (a) Protection . The Sheikh accepts H.M.G.'s guarantee of external protection against serious and n a + + a ovi /3 o o ci o + r\ crv' a n 'h 'hVl P nPfiPSSar 1 I guarantee of external protection against serious ana given by H.M.G. in | unprovoked attacks* and agrees to grant the necessary pursuance of last facilities to the R.A.F. to enable H.M.G. to implement vears Cabinet ■ + v-, t ^vrt-^^ mv&gt;^ ov&gt;^oo-n+ a tt m n i r icision. (P.Z.1399/34). pursuance WJ. j.a.ou xtiuixxuxtJa uu uue n.A.r. uu eiiauxe n.m.u. years Cabinet this guarantee. The Sheikh also accepts H.M.G.'s decision. limited assurance of internal support in any diificulti&lt; arising from the presence of the Oil Company. (The Sheikh's request that H.M.G. should accord himself and his/2 . his son&gt; Homsu!* whsn tih© lailier succssded. him^ full support in internal matters has, of course, been rejected.) ^ (b) Jurisdiction. The arrangements agreed with the Sheikh will be' similar to those at present existing in Koweit, viz. the Sheikh surrenders to H.M.G. jurisdiction over British subjects and protected persons and non-Muslim foreigners except that British protected persons who are subjects of Bahrein, Koweit, and the Trucial Sheikhdoms will remain as in Koweit under his own jurisdiction, subject to the usual arrangements for joint jurisdiction in mixed cases. (c) The Sheikh^ son, Hamad, is recognised by H.M.G. as his successor and promises to accept the terms of the 1916 Treaty with H.M.G. on his accession. The recognition of Hamad as successor does not commit H.M.G. to more than moral support in the event of a disputed succession ( vide (a) above). (d) The Sheikh agrees to convert the 1916 Treaty into an ,T heirs and succesors” one. The arrangements mentioned above may be regarded as on the whole satisfactory and Colonel Powle is to be congratulated on having succeeded in overcoming the Sheikh’s suspicions and reaching such a successful result. The conversion of the 1916 Treaty into an 'heirs and successors' treaty by agreement with the Sheikh is particularly satisfactory from our point of view. It is understood that the Concession Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is now on the point of signature. It is ir jcordance with the Sheikh’s draft (flagged ’B’ on ohe file) with the important omission of the last sentence (in pencil) of Article 18, which would have provided for the settlement of disputes between foreign employees of the Company and any of the Sheikh’s subjects by the Shara (religious) courts (this question is, of course, covered by the agreement reached regarding jurisdiction at (b) above). The Concession (Commercial) Agreement will be signed* by the Company together with a letter to the Sheikh stating that it *It has now been signed. J.C.W. is/2956 6000 7/. 0 l Minute Paper. Department. 3 . is signed subject to the approval of His Majesty's Government in accordance with the Sheikh's treaty obligations. The next step is the signature of the Government Agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government regarding the conditions to be observed by the Company in the event of their obtaining an oil concession from the Sheikh of Q,atr. The draft of this Agreement will be found at flag *a’ immediately below. It is similar mutatis mutandis to the Koweit Government Agreement and contains the usual ’’British' safeguards. The Company and the other Government Departments concerned (the Foreign Office, Admiralty and Petroleum Department) concur in the terms of the draft Government Agreement and it is desirable that it should be signed as soon as possible. When both Agreements are signed they will be linked by means of an e xchange of letters between the Political Resident and the Sheikh in the terms of the drafts flagged ’C’ and ’D* on the file (with possibly certain minor modifications of wording). This procedure is in accordance with the Kowcit precedent. This exchange of letters, the terms of which will also be accepted by the Company, will ensure that the terms of the Commercial j Agreement are subordinate, m an^ 'se of inconsistency, | to the terms of the Government Agreement and will provide for the termination ~ ihe concession by the Sheikh I ’ -K- ; (subject to a reference to arbitration) if the Company fail to observe any of the terms of the Government : Agreement. It is submitted that approval may be given to the r signature of the Government Agreement on behalf of His Majesty’s Government by a member of this Office. Ihe three/three other Government Departments concerned have already agreed to this procedure. (Sd. ) G.E. CRQMBLH1 16.5.35. J The success of Colonel Fowle and also of Mr. Mylles, the A.P.O.C. representative, in their respective spheres in these complicated negotiations is very gratifying. The A.P.O.C., as a result of their stanaing agreement with the other partners in the I.P.C. (i.e., principally the Royal Dutch Shell and the American and French groups), will, we understand, have to give these partners the option of coming in with them as joint holders of the concession. But it is always possible that some of the other partners may not wish to do so, and there is therefore some prospect of the eventual concessionaire company being predominantly British. In any case, there was no possibility of securing a better chance of a majority British holding, because Q,ataj falls within the sphere within vfoich the partner groups in the I.P.c. have agreed that none of them will seek a concession independently of the other groups; and no other substantial British oil company was, so far as we know, prepared to interest itself in Qatar; on the other hand, the Standard Oil Company of California, which has obtained from Ibn Saud a concession on the neighbouring Hasa coast, was known to be deeply anxious to obtain the Qatar concess and the Sheikh was aware of this and was already believed to be indirectly in touch with them. Unless, therefore, t] Anglo-Persian had succeeded in obtaining the concession w&lt; Should have had the choice of either accepting the onus of vetoing the almost certain desire of the purely American Company and the Sheikh to come to terms with one another (m which case, moreover, the concession would have been sterilised) or of admitting the foreigner. The outcome of Colonel Powle-s negotiations on the Purely political q uestions of protection, jurisdiction, internal/2956 6000 7/S4 5 . Vtinute Paper. Department. I ^ IS the top of the ttom file internal support, succession and the Treaty of 1916 i very satisfactory, in view especially of the somewhat unyielding attitude which the Sheikh was at first inclined to adopt on some of these points. The undertakings given to and by the Sheikh and his son Hamad are more fully described in the letters of which we have received copies by air mail (P.Z. 3414/35*). One other question covered by Colonel Fowls's negotiations was the Sheikh's enquiry whether in the case of an emergency he would be permitted to import rifles in excess of the annual quota of 500 allowed to him by the 1916 treaty, and whether he could be permitted to purchase machine gins and armoured cars. Colonel Fowle was autliorised to make replies to these enquiries on the lines of the Secretary of State* s telegram of 9th May at P.Z. 3184/35. The Sheikh has not in the past availed himself of his right to 500 rifles a year, and it was therefore felt that we could reasonably agree not to tie him down to this quota, and that we could promise to deal sympathetically with any request for rifles made in case of an emergency. On the other hand, we declined to commit ourselves on the question of machine guns and armoured cars, and there is no reason to anticipate a situation in which the Sheikh would require such weapons, though, if such a situation arose, we would be prepared to consider representations. The Government Agreement providing for political safeguards in connection with the oil concession has now to be signed, and when this has been done Colonel Fowle has to explain to the Sheikh the letters proposed to be exchanged with him in order to link the Government Agreement jvith the concession Agreement. Colonel Fowle proposes to Return to Qatar for this purpose very shortly (he leaves 3aghdad for Bahrein on 24th May, according to hiapresent programme), and it is therefore a matter of urgency toget the Government Agreement signed. Its terms have of course been agreed on hy the Company and the other Government Departments concerned, except that there is a small point which has been raised by the Company at the last moment in regard to Clause 11. If, as we hope, agreement on this point is reached with the Company and the other Departments, there is no reason why the Government Agreement should not be signed in the course of a few days' time, if this is approved. As the concession agreement has already been signed, the preamble would be altered accordingly. (Sd.) J.C. WALTON £3.5.35.JGS/WB S '. / . ( 59 groups, ) P-g-g „TPHBB of 'JELEBRam.

But it seems desirable again to remind nim that here, as in Koweit, we expect tne sheikh to take reasonable steps lor his own defence ana for maintaining order within Ms own borders. 3-. As regards .recognition. as stated in the telegram, there are precedents for the recognition Oj. an Heir Apparent, though he is by normal practice— not recognised. There is much to be said for adhering to the normal practice in the present case. On the other hand, from conversations which I have haa with IWr. Jfylles, it appears that the sheikh is ageing rapidly ana that effective control is being nanaea over more ana more to Hamad, ‘who is tne real lorce Dehina tne oil negotiations at tne present stage. Hamad, according to fir. fylles, is locally unpopular and is not likely to be a very good ruler, but he is the person with whom we have to aeal at the moment (and with whom we should have to aeal if the Sheikh died/died tomorrow). In these circumstances therefore it may he worth stretching a point. As the Resident says, there can, of course, he no question of our agreeing to promise full support in internal matters either uo the She itch or to HaimcL 4 . Jurisdiction. Here again, the line proposed hy the Resident seems on the whole the right one. But, as stated in the telegram, there is no uniioxiiiity oi practice in the Gulf and if it becomes of real importance to meet the Sheikh on the question, we could do so without departing from precedent, though it will, of course, be preferable to avoid doing this if practicable. 5. j:,n -i It, may be added that it recently came to light that,for some reason which is not quite clear, the Treaty of 1916 with c^atar, which governs all our relations with the State ana on which our position in it is essentially based, does not contain an heirs and successors clause. It will, of course, be a sine qua non of our recognition of any new sheikh that he should accept to the full the obligations embodied in that Treaty and there would on the whole be a great deal to be said for extending it by the inclusion of an heirs and successors clause if possible. ^ &amp; QL*,343(Sa 5000 1.35 Draft Paper.

Yours sincerely, J.G, LAIIHW.AIT2.AIR MINISTRY, ADASTRAL HOUSE, KINGSWAY, W.C.2. 26th April, 1935. '; ith reference to the draft telegram to Fowle with regard to the conclusion of an agreement with the Sheikh of ^atar in return for the agreement of an oil concession to the A.P.O.C*, one gets the impression that l owle is offering to the Sheikh a guarantee of unlimited protection which, as you will appreciate, we could not possibly implement. We know, of course, that in point of fact this is far from being so and that Fowle fully understands the position in this respect and is acting in accordance with your telegrams 583 and 585 of the 2nd March, 1934, to him, since when he has also seen the Air Council letter S.32797 of the 19th March, 1934; so we feel confident that he himself is fully in the picture. Nevertheless we would be grateful if in your reply to him, you qualified paragraph 2 by adding words to the effect that you presume he has impressed on the Sheikh that the limited guarantee of protection which H.M.G. are offering would not absolve him from taking all possible measures to provide from his own resources for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own boundaries. As I mentioned to you on the telephone, we feel there might be a real risk of the Sheikh tacitly assuming that he need no longer bother about defence, and of relying entirely on H.M.G. for protection. We hope also that Fowle will take such steps as he thinks best to acquaint the Sheikh with the^ir facilities that we would require him to provide if our T G.

Object of Sheikh E s queries appeared to be to satisfy himself that in case of necessity His Majesty's Government meant business.-2 3„ I replied verbally (a) that guarantee was against all-comers but naturally referred to serious incursions, not small raids. This Sheikh thought reasonable. (b) that doubtless His Majesty’s Government would use aircraft and other suitable means, which appeared to impress Mm* 4. on this point I suggest that I be authorised to reply in writing, as in 3 (a) and (b) adding that in oxder that assistance, if necessary,, may reach him quickly, landing grounds and.

This will cover the Koyal Air Force Intelligence arrangements, though I do not think it advisable at this stage specifically to mention Intelligence Officers.(1) Sheikh excluded British protected subjects and explained verbally that, while he wished subjects of Koweit, Bahrein and the Trucial Coast to come under his jurisdiction, all other British protected subjects would come under joint reciprocal treatment* (2) He added in his letter that,with regard to the subjects of Moslem foreign powers..he would not be responsible for any objection which might be raised by their Governments* 7. (a) Regarding paragraph No*5 (lh Previous recognition of any particular heir of any Sheikh is against the policy of the Government* (b) Regarding paragraph No*5 (2). This is objectionable as it would involve us to some extent in the internal administration of Katr and in supporting Sheikh, and in his turn Hamad, in any maladministration which they might see fit to carry out and for which we would bear the responsibility and odium* This clause has undoubtedly been inserted by Hamad, who is most unpopular in Katr* (c) Regarding paragraph No* 6 (lh I do not think that we can meet the Sheikh on this point as, inter alia * effect would be bad on other Arab rulers^ whose subjects were concerned* I imagine that main reason for this exclusion on the part of the Sheikh is to avoid his subjects being sued for debt in Doha joint courts by subjects of other Arab rulers, especially Bahrein*SECRET ETP/US/AW, (282 groups) 2224 ft PECYPHBK Qg TELBGRAiiL Prom Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for (COPIES India* CIRCULATED) Dated Risher, 22nd April, 1935* Received 22nd April, 1935, 10 372* Third and last p art« 8* I suggest that I he authorised to write a letter to the Sheikh to the following effects (a) that His Majesty’s Government agrees to a joint court at (? omission) hut that, as Sheikh will realise^ we cannot discriminate between our protected subjects on Arab coast and others, and all such subjects must come under jurisdiction of joint court; (b) that recognition of Hamad cannot be given as such is against general policy of the Government; (c) that His Majesty’s Government cannot accord general support in internal matters since this would involve an undesirable measure of interference in his administration* His Majesty’s Government however are prepared to support the Sheikh and his successors in any difficulties arising from presence of oil company.

Mylles states that the Shaikh regards these two points as vital to his independence as a ruler. We understand from Mylles that the Political Resident is due to-morrow at Dohah, and that Mylles has also informed the Political Agent at Bahrein that the time appears ripe for a declaration by H.M.G. of their policy to the Shaikh. If in that declaration H.M.G. could definitely inform the Shaikh that they would not approve of a concession to any party providing specifically for the purchase of arms for the Shaikh, and for the jurisdiction of the Shara courts over foreigners, we feel that the position should be materially assisted. In that event we would tell Mylles to go ahead and endeavour to clear up the financial position, since in the absence of any reference to this it COPY SENT BY AIR MAIL ffjri r SENT BY- 2 - would look as if Mylles had not yet got to a discussion of cash.

Yours sincerely. Following my conversation with you this afternoon,. we have instructed Mylles to represent to the Political Resident on arrival our objections to specific provisions for the purchase of arms, and to obtain the Resident's support on this point.

A ' Cypher telegram from Secretary of State addressed to Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, at Bahrein, No. 1075, repeated Government of India, Foreign &amp; Political Department No.1076, dated 3rd April 1935. XXX (No.of words: 202 &amp; 201) Your express letter dated 8th March, C-25. Paragraph 7(b). We think it most unlikely that any really substantial and purely British operating company could take up concession in this area and are most anxious not to be laced with repetition of the Traders episode. We wish therefore to leave nothing undone to encourage Sheikh to clinch with Anglo-Persian Oil Company as against negotiating with Holmes and his friends. In these circumstances we suggest that opportunity might be taken before Anglo-Persjai Oil Company option expires of indicating to Sheikh that his interests will best be served by granting concession to a concern which is well—qualified to work it and of impressing on him again that His Majesty's Government will not be prepared to approve grant except to a concern which is at least partly British, 2. With a view to choosing most opportune moment for such action having regard to progress of Mylles’s financial discussions with Sheikh, we suggest you might discuss situation with him on his arrival in Bahrein. 3. As regards Sheikh's redraft of concession, copy of which was sent by the Company to you at Delhi by air mail of 17th March, please see record of conversation with Anglo- Persian Oil CouRpany and Mylles of 28th March, copy sent to you and Government of India by air mail of 29th March. We will/2 . will be consulting you in immediate future on question of jurisdiction referred to therein.P.2.2387/35. Exercise of There is no ^.tar Order in council and no arrangement with the sheikh of ^tar about the exercise of jurisdiction by him over non-Moslem foreigners, whether British or other, it has always been recognised that difficulty was likely to arise on this point in the event or the grant of an oil concession, and the point bulked prominently in the earlier discussions in connection with the attempts of the I.P.C. to obtain an oil concession from the sheikh. 2. It may be convenient briefly to recapitulate the various references v\hich have been made to this point and to state its present position. 3- m November 1933 the Sheikh indicated that he desired that any dispute between a foreign employee of the company and one of the Sheikh's subjects should be referred to him for settlement, m the light of this the A.P.O.C. were warned in December 1933 (P.z.8267/33) that the grant of any oil concession by the sheikh would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionaire's employees. 4. on 4th December 1933 the Political Resident (D.O. No.1869-s) remarked: 'As far as jurisdiction of the shaikh over foreign subjects is concerned, the Shaikh is in une same position as his colleagues of the Trucial Coast. For that area no Order in Council of course exists, (as for Muscat, Bahrein and Kuwait), giving extra- territorial rights to British and foreign subjects, and arranging/2 arranging for tiiese to come under tde jurisdiction of the Political Agent. There is no mchinery, for instance, for settling the claims for debt of British Indian subjects against the local inhabitants, and all the Political Resident can do, when approached on the subject by the cr^ditois, is to try to arrange some sort of compromise through the Residency Agent, and bring pressure to bear on the shaikh - if it i s practicable to bring that pressure, similarly, there is no machinery lor settling criminal matters, and, theoretically, British subjects in Qatar and the Trucial Coast presumably come entirely under the jurisdiction of the local shaikh, and could, for instance, be imprisoned by him. m practice, however, a s far as I know, no such case has eve: arisen. The Shaikhs have never claimed judicial authority over British subjects in their territories, and we have always assumed that they cannot do so. f Ihe of QP-tar will, i think, lay special c/! 3 ress on fhis second point, as doubtless he is afraid with the coming of the Anglo-Persian oil Company, (which ) U SijOlk is regarded on the Arab Coast as a semi-official concern) that his authority will be encroached upon, and that Qatar will become a sort of quasi-British possession. £,ven if he cioes not fear this, but wants to give the Concession to a rival concern, he will make play with tills objection in order to create difficulties. I talked the matter over with Loch and we agreed that if the Shaikh persisted in raising this point, an answer on the following lines might be given him. In case of such disputes, as are contemplated, the matter might be referred/' 3/ 1 ^ referred to the Shaikh, who, in consultation with the local representative of the Company, would endeavour to settle it in an informal manner. If, however, this procedure failed to compose the dispute, and the matter was a serious one, it could he referred to a Joint Court (such as exists in Bahrain) composed of the shaikh and the Political Agent, Bahra:iIl. ,, 226/34 5. On 12th January the Secretary of State, in the No • 114« light of discussion with the Foreign Office, informed the Government of India that his provisional views on this point were as follows:- H 'It is politically most desirable, both because of international character of I*p.c. and uncertainty as to whether we could secure British exploitation and because of possible risk of Americans entering into competition later, to have made it clear well in advance to the sheikh that prior condition of grant by him of any concession (whatever nationality of concessionaire) must be surrender of jurisdiction on lines of Bahrein and Koweit Orders in Council... Compromise on lines suggested in paragraph 4 of Fowle's D.O. of 4th December, 1869-S, might well be easiest temporary solution of jurisdiction if we were dealing with a purely British company, but international character of I*P*C* and risk of American competition are strong arguments for facing surrender of jurisdiction at once. Our general feeling is that despite obvious difficulties this is the juncture at which to put relations with Qatar on more firm footing and that failure to do so now may involve us In much more serious difficulties once oil developments commence.4 431/54. r/34. 493/34. '3. if this view is accepted it would of course be aesir&amp;Dle to handle matter on lines least likely prejudicially to affect A.P.O.C. negotiations. It rni^ao, e.g., be possible to deal with question on general line that we consider that time has now come for bringing dormant articles of Treaty of 1916 into rorce ana that we wish in addition to reach agreement witn him in regard to jurisdiction, which to some extent arises out cf article VEIof 1916 Treaty, and may in any event become important issue if oil concession is granted, (it seems probable that understanding regarding jurisdiction would be essential condition of our approval to grant oy him of any concession, whatever nationality of concessionaire)''. 6- On 17th January the Hesident stated that he would much prefer to avoid entering into 'the complicated and long drawn-out negotiations probably necessary to gain from ohaitcii' inter alia an understanding regarding jurisdiction. 'At present stage essential objective would seem uo be ootaining ox concession for the A..P.O.C ...After we have secured concession for A.P.O.C. points of jurisdiction etc. can be taken up'. ^• On 20th January, the Government ct India (No.127) telegraphed expressing their general agreement with the Resident. In recommending feat an undertaking ■jO ;jio oec u ^.tar by land in the event of the Concession being granted to a company approved by H.Ivl.G., they added 'Inis guarantee of protection would be ostensibly given as quid pro quo for surrender of jurisdiction over foreign/foreign subjects, which should, we consider, he made indispensable pre-condition of consent to any concessions under Article V of-the Treaty. There seems to us no advantage in trying to treat question of jurisdiction on general lines and as unconnected with oil concessions, since sheikh is too cunning to be deceived.' The Secretary of State for India, in the light of the views of the Resident and the Government of India, on 1st 1 ebruar^ addressed a letter to the Foreign Office, discussing the general tactics to be adopted with the Sheikh, in the course of which he remarked: tt 3...(e) sir Samuel Hoare entirely agrees with the Government of India's view as expressed in their telegram No* 127 of 20th January that a surrender of jurisdiction over foreign subjects should be made an indispensable pre-condition of our consent to the grant of any concessions by the Sheikh under Article V of his Treaty. But in the light of their views and those of Colonel Fowls he would be prepared if necessary to await a later stage in one negotiations with the Sheikh before raising this question with him. The first essential is to secure the Sheikh's agreement in principle to the grant of the Qatar oil concession to the A.P.CUC. (I.P.C.). Once that consent has been secured and before the final approval of H.M.G. is given to the concession, the question of jurisdiction can be raised. As much play as possible can then be made with the adverse financial effect on the Sheikh if H.N.G. were forced to refuse approval to the grant of a concession merely because he adopted a recalcitrant attitude regarding- 6 - it; aiid it can be impressed upon him that a surrender of jurisdiction will he an essential pre-requisite to the grant of any concession to any applicant whoever he may be...*. The Foreign Office (letter No. 2 782/81/91 of 7th February 1934, on P.Z.914/34) expressed general concurrence, subject to the views of the other Departments, In the instructions proposed to be sent to the Resident, and the instructions finally sent to Colonel Fowle (India Office telegram 582 of 2nd L&amp;rch 1934 to the Government of India, on P.Z.1399/34) stated that the Resident should at once approach the Sheikh on the lines : wJ) t suggested in the India office letter of 1st February, P.Z. 628/34, to the Foreign Office. uw 1 with v— ^ '^ ie Question of jurisdiction has since this date been dormant. It was not raised with the sheikh by the Political Resident and next emerged when in Ikrch 1935 the Sheikh invited the A.P.O.C. to include in the draft Commercial Agreement which they are endeavouring to negotiate with him a clause providing that cases arising between Qatar subjects and employees of the Company should be dealt with on the basis of the Shara Law. J.G. LAIIHWAITE. 4th April 1935.P.Z.2253/35 INDIA OFFICE. Confidential. QATA R OIL. Note of discussion at the India Office on Thursday, 28th March 1935&gt; with representatives of the A.P.O.C. The Sheikh of Qatar’s redraft of the Qatar Commercial Agreement received under Mr. Lefroy’s letter of 26th March to Mr. Laithwaite was discussed at the 1.0. on the 28th March. Mi'. Lefroy, Mr. Mylles, Mr. Walton and Mr .Laithwaite were present. 2. It appeared that the Company, (subject to the comments which follow), were prepared generally to accept the redraft in the form proposed by the Sheikh, and were in fact anxious to agree to it with as few alterations as possible in order to facilitate negotiations. Article 4 . The Sheikh had insisted on ’’won and saved'. The redraft of this article on which the Company propose to instruct Mr. Msrlles to negotiate is appended to this record. Article 4(a) . It has already been agreed (Mr. Lefroy's letter of 10th October 1934, on P.Z. 6327/34) that signature must he ad referend um and subject to the approval of H.M.G. The point v/as made that in these circumstances it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Company to make the first payment under the agreement immediately on signature. After discussion the best course seemed to be that Mr. Mylles should, immediately before signature and after the financial terms had been agreed, remind the Sheikh that signature was subject to approval and that in these circumstances the whole of the first payment could not be made immediately but that a payment on account of, say, Rs. 50,000 would be made at once, and that the date of signature for the purpose of Articles v, o -i ^ n-nd ( ii) should be the date 4 (b), 4 (c) and sub-paragraph 2 (i) ana (,n; on/2 . on which the concession had been signed, subject to the approval of H.M.G* Article 11 , The Company wkilc desiring not to make a difficulty in their negotiations oy raising an objection were somewhat apprehensive that the Sheikh might endeavour to secure armaments on an unjustifiable scale from them with a s. view to equipping his forces with machine g*na* armoured cars, etc* for the purpose of repelling raids. They would of course be most reluctant to involve themselves in any such commitment, not least because any provision of arms by the Company might expose them to international criticism* It was agreed after discussion that having regard to the provisions of Article 3 of the Qatar Treaty oi 1916 and the fact that the question of what provision of arms, etc* ras 'sufficient' was open to reference to arbitration, the Company could probably take the risk involved in accepting ihe Sheikh’s redraft as it stood* Article 16. Provision that the Sheikh's consent should &gt;e necessary to the third arbitrator. It was agreed to aention this point to the Political Resident. Mr. Mylles felt confident that the Sheikh (or his son) would in practice agree to whatever name the Resident suggested. The history of this proviso was largely that the Sheikh thought that its insertion would make it less likely that the Resident would nominate someone who would he entirely unacceptable to the Sheikh and under the influence of the Company. Ar ticle 17 . The question was raised of what action H.M.G. would take if the Sheikh, for some frivolous reason, were to require the removal of the Chief Local Representative. It was thought that this risk was one which could probably be faced. in practice it might prove necessary in such an event to bring political pressure to bear upon the Shell*.3. Article 18 . Sub-paragraph 2. This was discussed in detail. Mr. Mylles stated that he had informed the sheikh that the matter was one for into which the Company could not enter; that the Sheikh had taken the line that it had better go in the agreement .and that if H.M.G-. objected they could then take it up with him (the Sheikh). The Company were strongly opposed to the acceptance of any such provision and were given to understand that it was obj ectionabk also from the point of view of H.M. G« who certainly could not agree to it. It was agreed that Mr. Mylles should inform the sheikh that the matter had been referred to Government, but that so far as the concession was concerned the Company could not accept a provision on these lines. The India Office representatives intimated that the question of cession of jurisdiction by the Sheikh and a consequent Order in Council would be taken up, the main alternative courses of procedure being: (a) that the issue should be faced with the Sheikh as a condition of the grant of approval by H.M. G. ; that it should be taken up at once prior ' to . , ( } signature of the concession, the sheikh being informed that H.M.G. could not approve the “ ser ^°g S °remarked a condition in any concession. Mr. Mylles remarked that the Shara Law and tbo penalties under it were strictly enforced in Q,atar and that the point was therefore one of importance. 5 . The Company stated that if they failed to reach agreement with the Sheikh within the time of the present option they proposed to withdraw Mr. Mylles and mar.e no application for a further option. They thought on the whole that the Sheikh and his son (who was playing an increasingly iimportant part) were not predisposed to the Company and that they thought that they could expect greater support from H.M.G. with a British conoessionnaire. But tne Jieixn financial demands were extravagant. They had no information as/4. as to who might be behind Major Holmes, but thought it probable that it was the Eastern and General Syndicate again. They thought it most unlikely that he was acting in any way on behalf of the standard. The chances of the latter had not been improved by Ibn Saud’s raising the boundary question, which had stiffened the Sheikh’s attitude. 4 . The Company’s representatives enquired what the attitude of H.k.G. would be if negotiations now broke down and if the Sheikh subsequently intimated his desire to grant the concession to another company on less favourable terms than had been offered by the A.P.O.C. It was pointed out to them that the attitude of H.M.S. to any fresh competitor must depend largely on circumstances; that there were great difficulties in urging the Sheikh to give the A.P.O.C. what would in effect be a continuing out ion on the concession on whatever terms they were at this stage prepared to offer; but that in the first place, so far as the Standard of California were concerned, it seemed most unlikely that an American Company would be prepared to .. ccept the British safeguards which the Sheikh was aware ere a sine £ua non of H.M.G.'e approval to the grant of , ny concession, while so far as other companies who mi^t omply with these conditions were concerned there seemed 10 reason why the Sheikh, if Bis negotiations with the , p. n.n. broke down on the question of finance, should be prepared to accept less company. The 'British universal application. favourable terms from another safeguards' would of course be of India Office, 28th March, 1935.P.Z.2253/1935.

The financial terms have not as yet been discussed at all, and from what we can see they are likely to be difficult, as that old shaikh appears to be a very obstinate man and equally hard up in present circumstances. I am going through this draft with Myiles and thereafter will discuss it with Messrs.

As far as my personal views are concerned, after going through the draft with Mylles the point on which I find most difficulty is the second paragraph of Article 18 relating to the submission of differences between foreign employees of the Company and inhabitants of Qatr to the shara Courts in Qatr. Article 22 required a Petwa of the Qadhi before the Shaikh was able to accept so irreligious a conception. Where2 ^ V/here Mrza Mohammed, has translated 'he justified' we shall probably substitute 'has the right' which he has himself used in some places for the same expression in Arabic. Yours sincerely, L.LEFROY.oHAIKH OF QATR» S DRAFT IV'ARnH' kOHAiviMED. DRAFT OF GfiTR COMCF.K.STOM This &amp;§i'©Gin@nt w&amp;s nicid© on th© ^ Ct jr of 9 corresponding to the 135 between His Excellency Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al-Thani, Ruler of Qatr, (who is hereinafter called 'the Shaikh', and this expression, whenever the contract requires shall include his successors and assigns), on the one part, and Charles Clark Mylles, on behalf of the Anglo-Persian Oil Co. Ltd. (which will hereinafter be called as the 'Company'; and this expression shall, whenever it is required by the contract, include its assigns), on the other part. Agreement is hereby concluded between the Shaikh and the Company as follows Article First.

If the Company discovers, in the course of its investigation and general activities, any minerals other than the substances mentioned in the first article, e.g. gold or iron oxide or any other minerals, it shall not be justified to appropriate the same, but must inform the Shaikh of their discovery; and the Shaikh shall have full right to, and absolute control over, those minerals which have been extracted; and he shall be free in granting concessions for the extracting of those minerals to any Company or Companies or to dispose of those minerals in any manner he considers to be consistent to his interests.

The principality of Qatr means the whole area over which the Shaikh rules and which is marked on the north of the line drawn on the map attached to this agreement. The period of this agreement shall be seventy five years from the date of its signature. Article Third . The Company shall explore the principality of Qatr minutely by any methods which is the best in its opinion to enable it to ascertain the probable existence of the substances. And for the purpose of carrying out its works in accordance with this agreement, the Company shall employ all customary and proper means and shall carry out the examination by methods agreeable to the modern Scientific Knowledge. The Company shall inform H.E. the Shaikh of all its operations in this connection from time to time. The Company undertakes to keep drawings and maps and accurate records of the wells drilled and such like data, whether they be topographical, geological or drilling, as it is customary to keep; and such information as these shall be open to inspection by the Shaikh or by his authorised representative.- 5 - Article Fifth . The Company will measure all liquid matters, at the time of their extraction from wells, either by dipping reservoirs or by means of measuring instruments, and measure solid substances by weighing; and it should supply the Shaikh with a copy of the register if His Excellency so demands. Likewise, the Company shall submit to His Excellency the Shaikh an account of the substances extracted by it for every six months and the authorized agent of the Shaikh shall have the right of inspection thereof at all reasonable times. Article Sixth . The Company may construct, maintain and operate roads and telegraph and telephone installations and their lines and wireless stations, railways, refineries and the ordinary ports situated at Dohah for importing its materials, and pipe-lines and pumping stations, workshops, houses and other things and works which are useful for it, as required for the purposes of its operations, and also the accommodations required for its employees, but excepting the places occupied by the enterprise of their owners, or those which it will be difficult for their owners to part with; and these are exempted. And the Company shall be justified to choose the port which may be suitable for exporting its substances; and it will likewise be justified in using all the means of transport required for its operations in accordance with this agreement, excepting aerial transport, which, on every occasion arising for it, the Company must obtain the Shaikh's permission and consent thereto. And His Excellency the Shaikh shall have the full right to use tnose roads, the electric (telegraph) lines, the wireless installations.4 telephones, and railways for his personal business and for 'governmental purposes, in case of need, free of charge; and the Shaikh shall have the right, also, to use all the ports used and constructed by the Company; and the Company undertakes to afford H.E. the ohaikh all XacilitiGS in this rGspGct* Article—Seventh« The Shaikh grants to the Company the use and occupation of uncultivated lands belonging to the Shaikh himself and which the Company may require for its operations, free, after an understanding is arrived at between the Shaikh and the Company about them, excepting the lands surrounding Riyan, as will be defined by the Shaikh himself. The Company will not be justified to acquire lands occupied by the enterprise of the owners thereof and also houses, places and lands which their owners decline to sell or to rent; and excepting these, it does not matter to use (other lands) if occasion arose. And the Company shall inform the Shaikh from time to time of the lands, houses and buildings which it requires to occupy for its enterprise. And the lands, houses and buildings already acquired by the Company and found by it to be un necessary for it any longer for its business, shall be restored by the Company to the Shaikh free. Provided that all the lands, houses and buildings which have been acquired by the Company shall be handed over to the Shaikh free on the termination or prior to that, on the cancellation, free. Article Eighth . The Company may take any quantity of water which it may require for its operations, free of charge, on the condition that this will not cause any loss or damage to any of the inhabitants. And subject to the same conditions as have been specified, the Company can explore, drill and impound water to satisfy the requirements of its operations. In case of need, the Shaikh’s army or military expeditions can take, free of charge, any quantity of water available under the Company's control, after its requirements are satisfied; and.- 5 - . sw likewise, the inhabitants can take such surplus water for themselves and their animals, free of charge. » The Company can take any earth, mud, gravels, lime, gypsum and stones and other similar substances which it requires for its operations , free of charge , but it will not pre vent the people from taking their customary requirements of these materials. The Company, however, must only take what it requires; and will not be justified in exporting any of these (materials) abroad. Article Tenth . In consideration of the sums agreed upon in the fourth Article, the Company shall have the right to import water, petroleum, fuel, machinery, motor-cars, lorries, aeroplanes, equipments, instruments, wood, utensils, iron ware, building materials, medicines, office equipments, household furniture, and all other things, equipments and goods required by the Company or by its employees for its operations; but not for sale to others; and it shall have the right to export its substances and their deri vatives and things already imported by the Company without Customs duty or import duty or export duty or tax or any other duty. The Company shall, however, pay the ordinary duty applicable to British merchants in the principality of Qatr on all the personal effects, piece-goods, general merchandise and provisions which it imports for the personal use of its employees.- And the Company and its operations, incomes, profits and properties shall be exempt and free, during the period of this agreement, from all the present and future taxes of any kind whatsoever. Article Eleventh . The Shaikh agrees that he will afford the necessary assistance for the enforcement of thio agreement, and that he will use his authority to protect the Company's employees and property as far as possible. But the Company shall also, itself, take the necessary steps in this respect, namely that the Shaikh or his assign will appoint armed guards on his behalf and the Company shall pay the expenses for this and the cost of theirAnd if the said cancellation should take place after thirty five years from the date of signature of this agreement, all the Company's properties within the principality of Qatr shall be surrendered, in that case, to the Shaikh, free of chargej and the wells actually producing at the time of the said cancellation shall be surrendered in a condition which is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they were at that time. On the termination of this agreement at the conclusion of the seventy five years, stipulated for in the second article, or the conclusion of any extension or renewal of its period all the Company’s properties existing in the principality of Qatr shall be surrendered to the Shaikh free of charge^ and the wells actually producing at that time shall be surrendered in a condition vdiich is reasonably considered good and satisfactory, as they used to be at that time. Article Fourteenth . The Shaikh has the right to cancel this agreement in the two cases mentioned below:- (A) If the Company fails to pay the sums mentioned in the fourth article within six months from the date they fall due. Pro vided that if any dispute should be made by the Company in regard to any payment thereof, the Shaikh shall not cancel the agreement until arbitration takes place thereon in accordance with article sixteenth and unless the Company fails to comply with the award of the arbi trators within three months from the date of the said award. (B) If the Company is in default according to the provisions for arbitration set forth in the sixteenth article. Article Fifteenth . The Shaikh shall not hold the Company liable if default should occur on the part of the Company in carrying out or fulfilling the provisions of the agreement by the mere occurrence of force majeure which may suspend operation; but should any dif ference occur between His Excellency the Shaikh and the Company as to the existence or non-existence of such force majeure, the same shall be referred to arbitration, as provided for m the sixteenth article. And the Shaikh stipulates that the force majeure which may- 8 - suspend operation means that which occurs in connection with the Company's operations in Qatr and that nothing else must be taken into ^consideration and must not be used by the Company as an argument in this respect. And the Company shall proceed to effect repairs at the time when any damage, of any nature, takes place; and the period of the said delay, together with any period reasonably necessary for repairing the damage will be added to the period fixed in accordance with this agreement. Article,,Sixteenth. Should any dispute occur between the Shaikh and the Company in regard to the interpretation of this agreement or of any matter arising therefrom or in regard to the engagements obligatory on either of the parties in accordance therewith^ such dispute shall be referred to two arbitrators if no agreement can be arrived at for settling it by any other method, and the Shaikh will appoint one of them and the other will be appointed by the Company. Each of the two parties shall appoint his arbitrator within thirty days after receiving the demand therefor from the other party. The two arbitrators shall thereupon appoint a third arbitrator; but if the two arbitrators or any two arbitrators appointed instead of them are unable to agree upon the third arbitrator within sixty days from the demand for arbitration, the two parties agree that, in that case, the third arbitrator should be appointed by the Political Resident; and the Shaikh makes it a condition that he should agree to the third arbitrator. The award of arbitration shall be consistent with the legal. principles familiar to civilized nations. The decision of the majority of arbitrators shall be final; and the place of arbitration shall be Qatr. On giving any award, the arbitrators shall fix a sufficient time within which the party against whom the award is given, should carry out the said award. And that party shall be considered at fault only when he fails to comply with the award before the expiry of the aforesaid period and not otherwise. Article Seventeenth . The labourers employed by the Company must subjects or from amongst those he from amongst the Shaikh 1 s own- 9 - approved by the Shaikh, excepting technical employees and the managers and clerks whom the Company may require and whom it cannot . -lind in the country. AnA the Shaikh makes it a condition that no official should be accepted whose retention is disapproved by the Shaikh, if the Shaikh notices any irregular acts on his part. And it naturally follows that the wages which the Company pays to the employees from amongst Qatr people shall be reasonable. Article Eighteenth . The Shaikh and the Company declare that they base action upon this agreement on the basis of good faith and pure belief and upon the interpretation of this agreement in a manner consistent with reason. And the Company undertakes to acknowledge the Shaikh’s authority and his rights in his capacity as the Ruler of the Qatr principality and to respect them in every manner. If any dispute or quarrel should take place between any of the foreign employees of the Company and any of the Shaikh’s subjects, their trial shall be held before the Shaikh and in his Shara (Religious) Courts. Article Nineteenth . Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Shaikh in any manner whatsoever from granting concessions to other parties for anything excepting the substances mentioned in the first article provided that the said concessions do not interfere with the rights of the Company or its operations in accordance with this agreement. Article Twentieth . The Company will pay all the sums due to the Shaikh, in accordance with this agreement, into the Shaikh's account in the Bank in and the receipt taken from that Bank shall be a full acquittance of the Company's liability for the sum mentioned in the Bank's receipt. The Shaikh may, from time to time, appoint another Bank or other Banks for the purposes of this Article, and this shall be done in writing.¥ - 10 - ArticlQjienty-First. This Agreement shall be binding upon both the parties and their successors and assigns; and it ha? been written in Arabic and English and all due care has been taken to make the two texts identical in meaning. And if* any difference should arise-as to the meaning or the interpretation of any article, at any time, the Arabic version is to be relied upon. Article Twenty-Second . The expression year, month and day used in this Agreement shall mean what is consistent with the English Solar Calendar and not any other. IN WITNESS whereof the two parties have hereunto set their hands and seals on the day and in the year mentioned in the preamble. Shaikh of Qatr.n C&lt;rfx T!2-. 1 4T) 4 .

Dear Lefroy, Lkny thanks for your letter of the 13th March aoout ( 4 atar Oil and for the very interesting information contained in it. We have sent a telegram to the Resident warning him of Holmes' interest in this question 3 on the lines which you ana I discussea. 2 o We are very ^laa to have a copy of Mirza Mohammed's redraft, which may he useful in the future. Yours sincerely, J.G* LAITKWAITS» L» nef roy , hi sf.*, An^lo-Persian Oil COoLta., Britannic House, Pinshury Circus, a . c 9 2 »5 /a INDIA OFFICE* LONDON, 3 # W # 1. lltii JVIarch 1935. Cfttar Oil. I enclosa copy of a memorandum summarising the corresponaence between Nylles and the A.P.O^C. between 26th February ana 3rd March, which was left with me by Defray on 5th March, we discussed the points arising on the various articles with the following result; Article 1 . No comment, except that it seems desirable that both the A.P#O.C. and the India Office shoula see the redraft. Article 2 . The sheikh’s suggestion that the period must turn upon the financial terms is, of course, a matter of bargaining. Article 3 . Reports on demand. I gather that the Company see no objection. Article 4 . Royalty basis to be won and saved as in previous draft. This is the same point as arose in the/ The Hon’ble Lt.Col. T.C. Fowle, C,B*E#, Bush ire.2 Article 7/ the case of Koweit. it, again, is a case of bargaining. Article 5« Be cords on demand. I gather that the Company see no special objection. Article., 6. If is perhaps reasonable that imports should be through Dohah. If the main oil-bearing structure proves to be in the Jebel Dukhan it would priiiia facie be more convenient that a special port of export (probably with a pipeline, as in Bahrein) should be agreed on that side of the Qatar peninsula and I gather that the Company would not see objection to this. But the terms of the Sheikh’s request are in any event quite reasonable, since the port of export is to be a matter for agreement between the Company and the sheikh. No difficulty arises, I understand, about the use of the Company’s facilities for personal or Government business by the .sheikh, nor does any special difficulty arise as regards aircraft. (Incidentally, if and when the Company obtain their concession and start to operate in Qatar, we shall have to consider securing from the sheikh an understanding in regard to flights over Qatar, etc. similar to those which we have obtained in Koweit, Bahrein and Muscat.3 Article 12/ There need he no Question of any ^ Government pressure in regard to the acquisition of land, etc. I gather that the Company see no special difficulty about agreeing to reversion to the sheikh, free of cost, of land, etc. surplus during the period of the agreement. hrt.inle„B. Artesian wells. I understand from Lefroy that the A#PeChCj think it very unlikely that wells if sunk will produce fresh wafer. But here again I gather that the point is not one of vital importance and that they are likely, if the Sheikh presses the matter, to agree to his request. Article 9 . I gather that no special difficulty arises over this. Article 10 . Imports to he free, hut right to re-export to he covered hy a special payment additional to royalty. This, I gather, will he a bargaining point, and attention is invited in connection with it to the Sheikh* s demands in respect of Article 15 as set out in the summary of the telegram from Qatar dated 2nd torch in the A«P.O.C. summary. Article 11 . I understand that tne A»P»0*o# see no special difficulty about this.Article 12 a This proviso that transferee companies shall Pe subject to approval by the Sheikh, coupled with the intimation on the same Article in the telegram from Qatar of 2nd March that only one subsidiary company will be permitted, is, I gather,, taken rather seriously hy the A#P#0*C#, who are, of course, bound to transfer to the I*P,C, any concession which they may obtain. The question was not discussed in any detail with Lefroy, but I gathered they have in mind the possibility of establishing a Qatar Oil Company which would be a subsidiary of the I,p,C, and to which the concession could be transferred to be worked, with the Sheikh’s approval, once it had been obtained by the A*P*0*C, Article 15 . I gather that the Company have in mind a variation of the Sheikh’s counter suggestion on this to the effect that termination will be possible only within three years of the date of the agreement (which is, of course, a very different thing from the date of the commencement of operations). I pointed this out to Lefroy, but did not go beyond that in our conversation. The sheikh can be relied on to look after his own interests on this. Article 14 . It seems desirable that both we and the A*P*O.C* should see the redraft, though if if is a rt redraff/“redraft without alteration of the sense' no special difficulty need he anticipated. Article 15 . I gather that the Company agree. Article 16 of telegram of 36th February. From the telegram of 28th February you will see that the sheikh has now agreed to the retention of the reference to the political Resident. Article 1 7. The Company, I gather from Lefroy, do not at all like this and feel that if the sheikh is to be at liberty to disapprove of “ary employee' and if the Company are thereupon to be bound to dismiss him, they may find themselves in a difficult position. I said that here, as elsewhere, it seemed desirable for the Company, if they wished to get this concession, to meet the Saeikh on all points that were not entirely fundamental, but that possibly they might think it worth while asking lilies to get a rather clearer definition from the Sheikh of the precise type of employee to whom he wished to be in a position to object He might wish for a completely free hands he might, on the other hand, be chiefly concerned to be able to object to individual Arabs or other native employees. I gather that the Company will probably do this. Article 18/' lcle Here, as in the case of Articles 1 and 14, xo seems desirable that and the A.P^O.C, should see the redraft 3 so as to ensure that there is in fact no alteration of sense. hllkifIP As the result of discussion with the Company it has already been agreed that as the sheikh apparently knows only Arabic and has nobody in his service who has a fluent knowledge of English, there are special reasons for allowing the Arabic text to prevail. 2* ' Question of local refinery . The demand for a local refinery (which would have been very acceptable to the Admiralty) appears to have been dropped (compare telegram of 28th February on Article 16 from Qatar). 3. Telegram from qafar of 2nd March . Article 11 . I said to Lefroy that tha Company, under the terms of this article, were already required to pay the wages of the guards who were to be appointed in consultation with the sheikh; that the sheikh under the terms of his Treaty was precluded from obtaining arms, save with the approval of H.M.G,, but that would raise no objection to arms (after consultation with the Political Resident, being imported in sufficient quantities to equip the guards, but for no other purpose, so long as this/tnis was done through the proper channels. icle 15. I gather that the Company see no difficulty ubouu _iQ.i ce rnajcure involving delay of operations in ^ Qatar only. We see no oh j action to payment in rupees* The question of annual payments in addition to royalty to cover exemption from customs duties, etc. and the right to re-export, is a matter for bargaining. 4. As regards the substantial gift, I gather (though Lefroy will not probably wish to be quoted) that rumours, which are thought to emanate from Holmes, have been spread locally, the most moderate of which is to the effect trut the sheikh of Koweit received 45,000 rupees as a personal gift on the conclusion of his contract, and that this has sent up the sheikh of Qatar’s demands. The Company are, it appears, prepared to* consider a substantial gift rather on Qatar lines. 5. It is most satisfactory that the Company should obtain an extension of the option until 4th May. 6. The Company appear to be a good deal disturbed about Holmes' alleged contacts with the sheikh. Lefroy mentioned (again I am not sure that he will wish to be quoted) that it had been ascertained throu^ the local postal authorities that a letter addressed by Holmes to the sheikh had been received in Qatar and that other letters/letter^ 8,d.Q.iGss6Q to tns s^isiHti tiad 'bssn rscGivGd from Mohamed Yattirn. They attach great importance to preventing him from visiting Qatar if, as ivylles remarks in his telegram, 'repetition of the Koweit experience is to he avoided'. 7.

In the case of (A). The Shaikh will have to be presented with the Political Agreement between Hi© Aajesty' Government and the Company. He may raise some objections to some of its clauses, but having accepted the Commercial Agreement, and beii^ naturally anxious to benefit by its financial terms, his objections should be surmountable. 3. In the case of (B).

Yours sincerely, sd.T.C.Fowle.foreign office, s. w. i. , (E 7017/81/91) ONFIDENTIAL. 3rd December, 1934. DENTIAL, My dear Gilbert, I see from Lefroy f s letter of November 19th to you, of which you sent us a copy in your Printed Letter No, P.Z.7118/34 of November 20th, that he suggests that the Sheikh of Qatar has no intention of undertaking any serious negotiations with the A.P. 0. C. for the Qatar oil concession pending the completion of the negotiations for the concession in Koweit. 2. Had the position in Koweit really been as favourable as we recently imagined when we were informed that only minor points were outstanding between the Sheikh and the Koweit Oil Company, this might not have been a very disquieting state ment. But in view of our new information as to the Sheikh’s commitments to the Hunting group, it seems to me that this indication of the attitude of the Sheikh of Qatar towards the A.P.O.C. is extremely unsatisfactory. Laithwaite, Esq. , 3 Cndia Office.- 2 - 3. I am not quite sure what action you are contemplating regarding the Sheikh of Koweitls commitments to the Hunting group, hut I am inclined to think that what Lefroy says about the Sheikh of Qatar makes it very desirable that a decision should be reached with the least possible delay. 4. As you know I have long felt that our position towards these Sheikhs is anomalous and may at any moment become impossible. These latest developments suggest that we ought perhaps to reconsider the whole question of our relations not only with the Sheikh of Koweit, but with the Sheikh of Qatar also. jui.

Being a Moslem, and, unlike most 'converts', being trusted by his fellow Mohammedans, he is in a position to gauge local Moslem opinion fairly correctly. I was careful to avoid expressing my own opinion and let him talk, which he was quite willing to do. 2. On the subject of Kuwaiti Oil he was definitely of opinion that Major Holmes was the nigger in the wood pile, and for his own ends had assisted the Sheikh to stick out for high terms from the K.O.C. ■'d* n n '.I r&gt; CVi hO uj o He said that the Sheikh would never have adopted such a stiff attitude towards the Company unless he had been instigated thereto by Major Holmes. 3. Qatar Oil . He, Haji Williamson, had gone to Qatar with Mr. My lies of the A«P»O.C. on his recent visit to the Sheikh, and on the whole was rather favourably impressed with the sheikh's attitude, which had improved since the last visit of the A.P.O.C, representatives last year. He thought that the policy of leaving the sheikh alone, and so giving the impression that the Company were not running after him to get the concession, had been successful. He was under the impression that there were some hopes, though, of course, he could not commit himself in any ^ way definitely, that at the end of the new option PV SENT BY A) PY SENT BY AIR MAIL , period/perioa the Sheikh might be willing to abate his Saia that ne nad heara “directly that ^ ^aua s stoc K had somewhat gone down with the aS ' C ° nSeqUenC9 0f evacuation of Hoaeida and the Yemen Littoral without apparently payment of any subsidy on the part of the Mam. ihe sheikh of Kuwait, in the course of r-Qd'^t ~ oi casual conversation with me d Cla ^ ° r tW0 later &gt; aiso expressed the opinion that the final result of the Saudi-Yemeni war was not regarded by the Arabs of the Gulf as by any means too successful from ibn Saud's point of view.

For various reasons it would be some time before they could resume active negotiations v»j.th the Sheikh of Qatar for the grant of a concession. They propose, however, to suggest to H.M.G. that the political points involved in the grant of any concession should in the near future be cleared out of the way by discussion between the political authorities in the Persian G-uli anci the Sheikh. Once these hctci been disposed of it would be possible for the Company to take up negotiations on the basis of the commercial issues only. J.G, LAlIHWAITh. 19th July 1934. INDIA OFFICE.Notes.

Previous papers :— 2730 1000 4.34 Please see the submission at P.Z.2473/34, regarding the Resident's discussions with the Sheikh of Qatar at the beginning of April. The telegram of 24th April, which we sent on that submission, is at Flag G. It will be remembered that we askea the Resident what programme he contemplated for the negotiations with the Sheikh ana wnetner ne intended to visit the latter again in the immediate future. The Resident replied (P.Z.2804/34) that he did not think much was to be gained by his visiting the Sheikh again until the air reconnaissance of qatar, approved by had taken place ana until the Sheikh nad been informed that H.M.G. had tola Ibn Saud that the Blue Line was the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia and that/that the area to the east thereof was a Britisa sphere of influence. The Besloent considered that tne reconnaissance, couplea with tne intiCiation to tne Sheikh mentioned above, would impress the Sheikh with the fact that H.M.G. meant ousinesd. 2. The reconnaissance was duly carried out on 9th may, ana the Political Agent made a communication in writing to the Sheikh about the Blue Line on 10th kay. Prom his interview with the sheikch on that occasion uolonel Loch gathered that the latter was now somewhat more favourably disposed towards giving a concession to the A#P*0*C« and he suggested that the time was opportune for the Company to send an unofficial Arab to have a private taltc with the Sheikh. Yusuf Kanoo, an Arab merchant ana the local Bahrein agent of the A.P.O.C., was selected by the Company for this purpose. He visited tne Sheikh at the beginning of June ana reported that trie sheikh now appeared anxious that the Company's official representatives should visit him again (P.Z.4021/34). The Sheikh also sent a letter to the A.P.O.C. at Abadan, stating that he would be pleased to resume negotiations but apparently indicating that he intenaea to aanere to his previous demands (P.Z.4332/34). 3. These recent indications that the sheikh is getting impatient ana nervous because tne Company have not yet approached him again officially confirm the resident in his view that the policy of leaving the Sheikh alone has been the right one. In this connection please see the extract from the Resident's personal letter to kr. Laithwaite of loth June at Plag^ , where Colonel/says that 'half tne battle with a Sheikh is to make him impatient for another interview It will oe seen that the Resident ana Colonel Loch have in \/iew some indirect means of pressure 1 * on the Sheikh.

The Hesiaent advocated (a) and we were proposing to telegraph approving this when we received the Resident’s latest telegram of 7th July (P.Z.4498/34). Prom this telegram and Mr* Laithwaite’s covering note it will he seen that the A.P.ChC., after discussing the matter with the Shell Company, have deciaed after all to employ Mr. Mylles, one of their test European negotiators, rather than Yusuf Kanoo, to take up at once with the Sheikh the question of an extension and that the Company have authorised him to offer up to Rs.3,000 per mensem. The Company are not yet prepared to discuss the main concession ana think it preferable for the moment to concentrate on the extension of the option, hut Mr. Mylies' conversations with the sheikh will no aoubt give him an opportunity to gauge the prospects of obtaining a definite concession. ^ Ar0C * ^ tr Lk o. i/if- \ Stiujdl 'VJLict ^ Oil crt ’ t &amp;L. # uyJl 04^ ^ YS&amp;iy J^L ^ ^ ^ — V ^ 4 H.n.G. -tir ^ I a. m«e &gt;gKHD, rjb/wb DECYPHBR OF TB ( 64 groups ) (COPIES CIRCU1ATED) From Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to Secretary of State for India 0 Bated Bushire sub, 7th July, 1934 0 Received 3 0 45 pom 0 , 7th July, 1934 0 XXX 62Q 0 Addressed to Secretary of State for India, copy sent hy air mail to Government of India and Koweito My telegram 'y' of 29 th ultimo, 594 c My lies of Anglo-Persian Oil Company has called in here, acting under instructions from the Company to proceed to £atr to obtain from Sheikh extension, for which Company authorise him to pay up to Rs;3,000 per mensemo He reaches Katr July 9th or July 10thoNOT The Resident's telegram No.594 of the 29th June and the Government of India's telegram No. 1467 of 2nd July about Qp'tar Oil were discussed to-day with the Eastern Department, to whom I also showed the extract from Colonel Powle's private letter of 13th June on the file. I said that subject to Colonel Loch's observations we were disposed to agree that course (a) was definitely preferable to course (b) ana tnat on receipt of Colonel Loch's comments, if he also agreed as to this, we proposed to mention the matter informally on the telephone to the A.P.O.C. and, unless they made any difficulty, telegraph approving course (a). 3. Mr. Warner said that he, too, agreed that course (b) was definitely objectionable and that on the whole course (a) was probably the best. The Foreign Office were not, however, entirely satisfied that it would not be better if representatives of the Company were now to proceed to &gt;^atar instead of Yusuf Kanoo. I pointed out that from paragraph 3 of Colonel Powle's telegram it appeared that the sheikh had not asked that representatives should go and added that the local authorities were presumably satisfied that the tactics recommended were the best. The Foreign Office, after discussion, agreed, but suggested that in the instructions finally sent we might add something to the general effect tnat H.M.G. assumed that the Resident ana the Company had good reasons for not suggesting that the train negotiations should go and take up the main negotiations with the Sheikh straight away.Extract from Private and Personal letter from Lt.Col* T.C.W.

I shall probably be wiring you about it to-day or tomorrow. 1 have now had an opportunity of seeing the Report of the Emissary who went down to Qatar on behalf of the A.P.O.C. and of reading his Report. I think the policy of leaving the Shaikh severely alone since my last interview with him, except for the incursion of R.A.F.machines*, has been the right one. Ihe Emissary confirmed, what appears from his Report, that the Shaikh is getting inpatient and nervous at the Company not having approached him again, and half the battle with a Shaikh is to make him impatient for another interview. If the Company*s present option is up in August, which I shall get confirmed, then I think the Company *s representative should not go down to QAtar until after the middle of next month.

Any demonstration over Ikhwan settlement known to exist there mi^it be legitimate but would certainly be regarded as provocative if it came to the knowledge o± the Saudi Government.

You kindly enclosed copies of the two Conventions. The information contained in your letter is being communicated to the Department of State. Yours sincerely, (Sa.) Hugh Millard. G-• W.

FOREIGN OFFICE, 3.W.1. 24th April 1934. Dear Millard, Since we arranged, as a result of your call upon me on 3rd March, that the aircraft, which the California- Arabian Standard Oil Company are going to use for survey work over the area of their concession in eastern Saudi Arabia, should in certain emergencies be allowed to fly from the Hasa coast to Bahrain, we have heard from our Embassy at Angora that your Embassy there have recently made informal enquiries regarding the treaty instruments governing the frontiers, etc., in that part of the world. We have instructed our Embassy to put yours on the track of the relevant agreements. 2. It has occurred to us that the enquiry of your Embassy at Angora may well have been made in connexion with the California-Arabian Standard Oil Company’s concession am proposed aircraft survey. Whether that be so or not, it has suggested to us that, since we have been in correspondence on the subject of the Company s aixerdit, and you may not have had the opportunity ox obtaining full information as to the bounfery between Saudi Arabia and the area under British influence to the south-east of it, you may like to have the enclosed copies of two Anglo-Turkish Conventions,/ . Millard Esq..2 . Conventions, of £9th July 1913, and 9th March 1914, respectively, which i_nter alia cover the matter* o* The 1913 Convention was never ratified, hut you will see that the boundary line laid down in Article 11 of it was re-defined and formally adopted in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on 3rd June of that year* 4* The frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South Eastern Arabia is thus a line running irom the head of the bay immediately to the south oi Zajnuniya -t-sland, a little to the east of U-jair, in a due southerly direction to a point on parallel 20° North in the middle of the Ruba al Khali desert, and thence running south-westwards, at an angle of 45°, down to the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and what is now the territory of the Imam of the Yemen* King Ibn Saud has of course succeeded to Turkish sovereignty on the west and north-west of that line, Saudi Arabia being one of the Turkish succession States* 5* The prohibition in regard to flights of aircraft, to which we have already made reference inthe official correspondence about the Company’s request for facilities for their aeroplane at Bahrain, applies of course to the area to the east and south-east of the above line; and, if you think there is any likelihood of the California- Arabian Standard Oil Company’s survey of their concession (as tc the precise area of which I understand no informatior has yet been published) extending to the vicinity of the boundary referred to above, we should be grateful if you would make sure that they are informed of the position, in order that there may be no danger of their aircraft unwittingly violating the prohibition of flying to the east of/of the boundary, or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line* Yours, &amp;c•, (Sgd.)

We have instructed our Embassy to put yours on the track of the relevant agreements. 2m It has occurred to us that the enquiry of your Embassy at Angora may well have been made in k connexion with the Callfornia-Arabian Standard Oil company’s concession and proposed aircraft survey. Whether that be so or not, it has S K - h , i i Ha suggested/suggested to us that, since we have been in correspondence on the subject of the Company's aircraft, and you may not have had the opportunity of obtaining full information as to the boundary between Saudi Arabia and the area under British influence to the south-east of it, you may like to have the enclosed copies of two Anglo-Turkish Conventions, of 29th July, 1913, and 9th March, 1914, respectively, which inter alia cover the matter. 3. The 1913 Convention was never ratified, but you will see that the boundary line laid down in Article 11 of it was re-defined and formally adopted in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, the ratifications of which were exchanged in London on 3rd June of that year. 4« The frontier between Saudi Arabia and the British spheres of influence in South Eastern Arabia is thus a line running from the head of the bay immediately to the south of Zaknuniya Island, a little to the east of Uqair, in a due southerly direction to a point on parallel 20° TTorth in the middle of thekuba aX Khali desert, and thence running south-westwards, at an angle of 46°, down to the frontier between the Aden Protectorate and what is now the territory of the Imam of the Yemen. King Ibn Sand hes of course succeeded to Turkish sovereignty on the west and north west of that line, Saudi Arabia being one of the Turkish succession States. 5. The prohibition in regard to flights of aircraft, to which we have already made reference in the official correspondence about the Company 1 b request for facilities for their aeroplane at Bahrain, applies of course to the area to the east and south-east of the above line; and, if you think there is any likelihood of the Califoraia-Arabian Standard Oil Company^ survey of their concession (as to the precise area of which I understand no Information has yet been published) extending to the vicinity of the boundary referred to above, we should be grateful if you would make sure that they are informed of the position, In order^order thfct there m&amp;y he no danger of their eircreft unwittingly violating the /-N prohihition of flying to th© east of the boundaryj or of their inadvertently extending their operations in any way to the east of that line.p.z. 2723/34 Enolosure in Foreign Office covering letter, t No. C.2435/1206/91 dated 23rd April, 1934 Bo.171* (176/7/34). British Embassy, ANGORA. 11th April, .1934 Sir, I have the honour to inform you that on the 2nd April I spoke to the United 5trites Ambassador in the sense of the instructions contained in your despatch No.125 of the 22nd March (E.1839/1206/91), relative to the Anglo- Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 regarding boundaries in Eastern Arabia. Mr. Skinner was most grateful for the communication which you had authorized me to make to him. He told me that he had been unable to obtain a copy of the unratified Convention of 1913 from the furkish Govern ment, «ho had searched their archives for it in v in, and said that His Majesty’s Government should realize that matters of private interest, not of State interest wore behind the inquiries whieh his Embassy had under taken, the interest residing in the concession of an important Petroleum Company* 2* It was obvious that my colleague kne . nothing about the geography of the region in question. I emphasized the point that what I was showing him was the south eastern frontier line of Turkish Arabia. His Excellency put no question about what was happening east of that line, so I did not refer to El later. He/ Ihe Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.3.I., K.O.Y.u., etc., etc., etc., r,d@ did enquire vhj the Ottoman GoYernsaent had not ratified the 1913 Convention, end on this point X vyo,s unable to enlighten him* I said, however, that as the 1914 Convention confirmed the frontier in question and indeed also prolonged it further southwards to the previously delimited frontier between the Aden Protec torate i‘,n&amp; the Vilayet of the Yemen, and as that Conven tion had been ratified, the non-ratification of the earlier Convention was hardly relevant to the matter in hand* a* X handed to Mr* Skinner, for retention, the copy of the 1913 Convention enclosed in your despatch, and lent him volume XX of Aitoheson*s fl Tr©aties 51 , a further copy of which he said he would purchase for the use of his Embassy* 4* I am sending copies of this despatch to Hie Majesty 1 e Hspresentatives at Washington and Jedda.

The Political Agent accompanied the Honourable the Political Resident to Q,atar, where they remained from the 2nd to the 4th April in connection with the Oil Concession. (ii) . It will be recalled that the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have permission to explore for oil throughout Qatar up to August 1934. They have, however, experienced much difficulty in negotiating for a concession, because of the offers made by the Standard Oil Company of California. It was discovered, on a previous visit, that Shaikh ’Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani proposed to give to the Standard Oil Company of California the same exploration facilities which the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited now enjoy, and then to play the Companies off against each other. To grant such facilities was clearly, however, contrary to the terms of his Treaty with His Majesty’s Government (which precludes him from granting concessions without their permission),for exploration facilities form part and parcel of a concession. It will, however, be appreciated that once exploration facilities had been given, it would have been impossible,in practice, for the Shaikh to refuse (or for His Majesty’s Government to prevent) a full concession being granted, if favourable terms were offered. It is clear that Shaikh ’Abdullah had been advised to adopt this clever method of getting the American Company into Qatar by the Standard Oil Company of California and King Bin Sa’ud. It was subsequently discovered that Shaikh ’Abdullah had had an interview with an American during his visit to Riyadh and that the Standerd Oil Company had offered 10$ above any terms/2. n (v)/ terms wmoh the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited might offer. (iii). With the authority of His Majesty's Government, Shaikh ’Abdullah, who was manifestly afraid of King Bin Sa’ud, was warned that he must adhere strictly to his Treaty obligations and that he must, therefore, cease to have any relations, the existence of which he admitted, save those of courtesy (for example, ’Id greetings), with King Bin Sa’ud. He was informed that the British Government regarded exploration facilities as being part and parcel of a concession and that he could not, therefore, under the terms of his Treaty, grant such facilities, and would not be permitted to do so. Shaikh ’Abdullah, threatened to leave Q,atar (a dire threat in Arab eyes) and also said that he would give a concession t o no one. He was reminded that if he were to refuse the good money which/as offered, his relations and people would probably give him great trouble.. Shaikh ’Abdullah was further informed that in return for their iiastence on their Treaty rights, His Majesty’s Government were prepared to give him protection by land against the attack of a great enemy or against big raids, in addition to the protection by sea which he already enjoyed. Shaikh ’Abdullah asked that these matters should be put down in writing and an exchange of letters ensued , This assured him that His Majesty's Government were in earnest, and his attitude changed for the better. (iv). The position at present is that Shaikh ’Abdullah has been warned clearly of the attitude of His Majesty’s Government, and is apparently prepared to endeavour to come to terms with the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, but the gulf between his demands and their offer is still wide. The Standard Oil Company of California are, however, apparently making every effort to secure a concession in Qatar and the struggle is by no means over.(v). It has been discovered that a doctor of the Arabian Mission on a recent visit to Qatar tried to have indirect influence brought upon Shaikh 'Abdullah in the interests of the American Company, He also apparently took every opportunity to spread the idea that the Americans are the wealthy people of the world and the British only 'politicians'.CONFIDENTIAL.

I am increasingly disturbed at possibility of two separate conflicts with Ibn Saud over Koweit and area east of Blue line. See paragraph 4 of my telegram 40. Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest Royal slave incident and no Question can be considered without ta,king account of Saudi Yemen situation which may be developm 0 more rapidly than seemed likely three weens ago. If Ibn Saud wins in conflict with Iman in which His Majesty’s Government have done nothing materia,! to help him, he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia. He may be all the readier to do so, tnong this is conjectural, as a result of the establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders talcing part in mission of mediation now here* If he is worsted oy Iman he will think His Najesty’s Government are taking advantage of his difficulties to emoark on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions. I realise that policy in regard to question mentioned in first sentence cannot be altered. It occurs to me, however, that appearance of a double attachon Ibn Ssuci might, be mitigated by a preliminary . communication on following lines if Sheikh of Xoweit abandons his pecuniary claims: Sheikh of Koweit has waived claims and His Majesty’s Government intend to pursue actively question of Koweit blockade settlement of which is imperative* Course of correspondence regarding claims has revealed danger of misunderstanding as a result of direct correspendence between Sheikh and Ibn Baud* In view of their special relations with koweit, nature of which was explained to Saudi government in 1S27 His Majesty’s Government consider matters affecting official relations between Ibn Baud and the Sheikh should be conducted through their intermeclieryo This applies also to the neutral zone, regarding v/hich Saudi government have recently consulted His Majesty’s Government but only after committing themselves very considerably to certain parties on a, matter (oil) which equally concerns ciie Sheikh and therefore His Majesty’s Governmento Latter have also had reasons for perturbation as regards relations between ion Saud and one of the ruler^ (Qato.r) named in the same article of the Treaty of Jedden ^ ne y wish to remind Saudi government that their interest in these rulers depends on specific treaties with tnem and on the fact that their territories lie within British sphere of influence as defined by Anglo-iuikish conventions of 1913 and 1914 which determined eastern boundaries of Nejd as His Majesty’s Government have recently had occasion to explain to United States government in response to an enquiry* Ir- 3o I th: suggestion with clifficlencs* It it were possible to adopt it I suggest form of memorandum from His Majesty communication in s Government as such. It would pave the way for a.ctive pursuit of Koweit blockade question on whatever lines you eontemplatco As regards neu/cral zone it would establish position that Ibn Baud cannot eiqpect His Majesty’s Government merely to bring Sheikh into line with his own premature arrangements with prospective concessioneireso As regards Qatar it would produce effect inter mediate between that of alternatives B and C* It would indicate views of His Majesty’s Government clearly without making Blue line separate immediate issue and would therefore be no more likely than 3 to be regarded as a challenge.

Copy of telegram from the Foreign Office to Sir A. Ryan. (Paper No. M.E.(O) 122). Location of Salwa. Note by the Secretary. (Paper No. M.S.(O) 123).

(Paper No. M.E.(0) 126; . PER. LAITHWAITE stated that there were two questions for discussion. Firstly, the present position of the negotiations with the Sheikh, and, secondly, th~ questio of the boundary, i.e., the U blue line”. The Sheikh’s re-actions were fully given in Colonel Fowle’s telegram (Paper No. M.S.(O) 124) and his air mail letters (Paper No. M.E.(O) 126). The general line taken ty the Resident seemed entirely satisfactory. j-f the Committee agreed as to this, we might approve it sp 3 cally, and might also consult Colonel .Towle as to th- next stage. It seemed desirable to maintain our pressure on she Sheikh, since a further telegram had just been received from Colonel Fowls that a reliable report had been received 3 y the Political Agent, Bahrein, that the Hasa Oil Company lad informed the Sheikh that they would cap any financial offer made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, and that the Sheikh had replied that he would not negotiate with them until the Anglo-Persian Oil Company’s option expired.Gil Company at present held really amounted to an option - and it was diiiicult uo see what value it possessed unless it gave the Company preferential rights for obtaining a concession if they found oil - might it not be possible to take the line with the Sheikh that he was already committed by the terms of. this option to giving the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company if they desired to take it up. Mr. Laithwaite and Mr. Parkinson having explained that exploration licences in India and in Palestine did in fact give the holders preferential claims amounting to option on the concessions concerned, Mr. Rendel thought that these precedents might furnish a useful argument for taking the line with the Sheikh that he could not grant the concession to any other Company until the Anglo-Persian Oil Company had decided whether to take up the concession or not. The fact that we were now telling the Sheikh that we regarded an exploration licence as part and parcel of a concession might be a'further argument in favour of this line. At Mr. Laithwaite’s suggestion it was agreed that Colonel Fowle should be informed that his action was approved, subject to any caveat that might be necessary in the light of further discussion in the Committee as to the Qatar boundary. QUESTION OP On the question of the attitude to be adopted with ''BLUE LINE” 30'JiUiAPY. Ibn Saud over the st blue line” MR* LAITHWAITE stated that Sir On the question of the attitude to be adopted with Andrew Ryan appeared to agree with the course indicated in paragraph 7(b) of the Foreign Office telegram to Jedda No* 36 make an of 27th March (circulated as Paper No. II.E. (0) 122) ^ i.e. 9 to/ anodyne communication to Ibn Saud which would make our posi tion clear without constituting a direct challenge. The Minister considered it dangerous to say nothing, andundesirable to say anything provocative. A tactful communication to Ibn Saud of the United States Embassy’s request for copies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 on the lines discussed at the Sub-Committee's last meeting was thus apparently the best course. The India Office wished, however, to suggest a parallel ecmmunication to the United States Embassy in London with a view to countering the danger, strongly emphasised by Sir A. Ryan* of the possibility of air survey being carried out by the Standard Oil Company of California to the east of the 'blue line'. The Standard Oil Company had recently asked, and obtained, permission, through the Foreign Office, to use Bahrein for flying purposes in the event of emergency. He suggested, subject to Foreign Office agreement, that in connection with this permission, the American Embassy should be asked to ensure that air craft belonging to the Standard Oil Company should not cross the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia* i.e. * the 'bine line' MR. RENDER said that at first sight he was much attracted by Mr. Laithwaite’s suggestion. The possible desirability of making a further communication to the United States Government on the subject of the ‘'blue line , and not merely relying on the United States Embassy at Angora to pass on our views, had already occurred to him, but it would obviously be-preferable to find some such peg as that which Mr. Laithwaite had suggested - i.e. the correspondence about the Standard Oil Company s aircx axt - on which to hang such a further communication. At tne same time, the v/ording of the communication would used veiy carefully working out. The United States -embassy haa. asked for permission for the aircrait (a) to fly to Hasa■4- — 1 JSTRUCTIONS ) HIS ^JHSTY ’ 3 •NISTER, 1DDA. via E owe it and Bcthpein, and (Id) to make direct flights from Hasa to Bahrein in cases of emergency. Neither application involved any real risk of the aircraft flying east of the !l blue line,' and it might possibly he prefer able to address a warning to the United States Government about the ’’blue line', through His Majesty’s Embassy in Washington, with reference to the enquiry of the United States Embassy in Angora, and not to link it on to the question of the aeroplane. In any case he would like to consult the American Department of the Foreign Office and submit the matter to his higher authorities before going any further; but he saw no reason why something on the lines suggested by Mr. Laithwaite should not be done. THE CHAIRMAN suggested that the question of whether the communication was made here or at Washington was really a matter for the Foreign Office. It was accordingly agreed that a supplementary communication should be made to the United States Govern ment, to the effect that aircraft of the Standard Oil Company could not fly to the east of the ”blue line”, and that the method of this communication should be decided by the Foreign Office. The question of what instructions should be sent to Sir Andrew Ryan was then discussed. MR. SEAL oh ought it would be very difficult in practice to tie down Ibn Saud within any definite geographical limits. Ibn Saud had, in fact, expanded to the East of the ”blue line”. We should, therefore, con fine ourselves to our main object of reserving our oil rights In this area.MR. lAITIM/AITS felt some do’abt about the terms of the addition suggested by Sir Andrew Ryan. The less surface we exposed the better. THE CHAIRMAN preferred to retain the original wording of the instructions given to Sir Andrew Ryan, vide paragraph 7(b) of M.E.(C) 122, which was:- 'to take some action which would make our views and position clear to Ibn Saud without constituting a direct challenge to his position. This could be done by merely informing him of the United States Embassy’s request for copies of the Anglo- ^‘’^Rish Conventions of 1913 and if 14 and of cur reply. Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions ccuj.d oe made to Ibn Saud.” MR. RENDER said that, while he was naturally most reluctant to question the recommendation of the man on the spot, it must be remembered that when Sir Andrew Ryan sent his telegram No. 47 of March 30th (M.E.(G) 124) re had not yet received copies of the correspondence with His Majesty’s Embassy at Angora regarding the United States Embassy’s request for information. When Sir Andrew Ryan received that correspondence he would see that it was not quite accurate to say that the United States request 'was understood to have been made in order to ascertain the limits of Saudi territory” etc. The explanations which Sir P. Loraine had now been instructed to give to the United States Embassy would make the position abunaantly clear; and, in the circumstances, Mr. Rendel agreed that it would be better not to add the rider suggested in the penultimate paragraph of Sir Andrew Ryan’s telegram, more especially as such a statement might well be regarded as unnecessarily provocative. MR. LAITHWAITE said that we must take our stand on the 'blue line”, which was our sole legal boundary. I - L v ''- made-6- it clear that we were doing this on international and local grcondo, Ihn oaud would he automatically precluded cm giving an oil concession or taking other active measures in this area. In reply to Colonel Mackesy, Mr. Laithwaite stated that the payments mentioned in Colonel Fowle's letter of the 50th March 1934 (M.E.(o) 126) referred to those made ky Crucial Sheikhs and not by the inland nomad tribes* From Colonel Fowle’s letter it was obvious that these payments were in no way any formal tribute, but were in the nature of the ancient dang geld or the modern blackmail. It was reported that the Murra and other nomad tribes of the Rub al khalil paid occasional, but not formal, tribute to Ibn Saud as 'lord of the sands'. THE CHAIRMAN thought that as it was obviously impossible to provide for every contingency, the less that was said the better. MR. RENDER agreed and suggested that Sir Andrew Ryan had been instructed to inform Ibn Saud, as a mere matter of courtesy, of the United States Government’s enquiry re garding the Convention of 1913, and of the reply returned by His Majesty’s Government thereto, making it clear that His Majesty’s Government regard the^blue line H laid down in the 1913 and 1914 Conventions as remaining operative. It was accordingly agreed that the Foreign Office should draft a telegram conveying instructions on the above lines to Sir Andrew Ryan. s ^iAISSANCE . MR. LAITHWAITE stated that Sir Samuel Hoare, subject to the views of Departments, agreed with the Political Resident as to the desirability of a combined reconnaissance by the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force taking place assoon as possible. lie recognised 5 however ? that no reconnaissance could take place until the communication about the ''blue line' to Ibn Saud and the United States Embassy had been made. The object of the reconnaissance would oe two-fold: firstly ? to ascertain the general nature of the country and too look for possible landing grounds for aircraft and anchorages for flying boats: secondly s a combined reconnaissance by naval and air craft would impress the Sheikh and was likely to have a strong moral effect. COMM/JUDER DICKSON stated that the East coast of the Qatar peninsula was generally accessible to sloops; it was * however ? impossible for these vessels to reconnoitre the West coast of the Qatar Peninsula owing to the very shallow depth of the Dohat as Salwa. GROUP CAPTAIN PECK stated that aircraft continually flew along the East coast of the Qetar peninsula 3 which coincided with a section of the eastern air route. He considered that it would be very useful to obtain further information regarding the bohat as Salwa*) which could be done without Admiralty assistance. Tuis reconnaissance could be linked up with the presence oi any of His Majesty’s ships on the east coast 5 in or^er ^ ^^ 0v&lt; the flag at Doha and the more densely habited part of the country. Should it be decided to hold a reconnaissance, he suggested that the Resident of the Persian Gulf should be asked to work out the necessary arrangements in conjunction with the Air Officer Commanding, Iraq, and the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. MR. RENDEL suggested that it would be well that the reconnaissances if made should be made as soon as possible after the communication to Ibn Baud of our views&gt;1 regarding the U 'blue line” ? 'but before I bn Saud had had time to take up the challenge. If the r econnaissances were mane be!ore we had said anything to Ibn Saud about our views in regard to the frontier ? he might well make a grievance of having had no warning of our attitude 5 while if they were made after he had taken up our challenge (should he do so) they might be regarded as a hostile demonstration and lead to political difficulties,, MR. LAITKWAITE agreed as to the importance of action as soon as the necessary communication had been made at Jedda. On the question of protection 3 he pointed out that our liability to protect the Sheikh of Qatar did not become effective until and -unless a concession was granted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. GROUP CAPTAIN PECK said that the Air Ministry con templated the establishment of an aerodrome at Doha and various emergency landing grounds in the Qatar peninsula 3 to enable them to fulfil the guarantee of protection to the Sheikh 3 if granted. Operations, if necessary, would probably be conducted from Bahrein. Should it be possible to establish a floating base near Lhor al Odeid, as suggested by Commander Dickson, it would be most useful. It was accordingly agreed that the Inciia Of I ice should include in their telegram to the Resident at the Persian Gulf instructions regarding the proposed reconnaissance. FORM OP TELEGRAM TO resident. MR. LAITHWAITE said that subject to the concurrence Of Departments, the India Office would address a telegram to the Resident at the Persian dulf covering the following heads: (a) Genera], approval of his necessary as regards action, with any caveat the boundary question.-9- MINISTERIAL AUTHORITY* ('b) A cross-reference to the telegram which the Foreign Office would, he understood, draft to Jedda, and which would explain the position as regards the intimation to he conveyed to I bn Sand; (c) Reconnaissance; (d) An enquiry as to the time table he contemplated vis-a-vis the Sheikh 5 and the next step. He enquired what, if any, caveat should be included in such instructions on the subject of the Qatar boundary. MR. RENDER favoured some such caveat as he feared that if we allowed the Sheikh’s statement that his frontier ran across the base of the peninsula to pass in silence, we might be regarded as having acquiesced in such a frontier, and that might make it difficult for us even tually to claim that the 'intermediate area' up to the 'blue line' 'appertained' to Qatar. It would never do for us to say to Ibn Saud that we regarded the territory up to the 'blue line' as falling within the sphere of Qa.tar and for Ibn Baud to be able to reply that the Sheikh of Qatar himself repudiated any such claim. MR. LAITHWAITE suggested that the desirability of some caveat should be put to the Resident ior his views. This was agreed. COLONEL MACKESY stated that the communication of our attitude to lion Saud might involve important re actions. He suggested, therefore, that some statement, giving the conclusions of the Sub-Committee should be prepared by the Committee for submission to the Ministers. THE CHAIRMAH said that the telegrams resulting from the conclusions of the last meeting had been approved both by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for India, and had been sent officially to other Departments, who had given-10' *5^ their concurrence. It was, therefore, encumbent on departmental representatives to consult their Ministers if they saw fit. Should any doubt arise, a Ministerial Meeting could then be summoned. He suggested that this procedure should again be followed in the c ase of the telegrams to Sir Andrew Ryan and Colonel Fowle, which would be sent as the result of this meeting. COtrCL UBIOwi THE SUB- ■COMMITTEE agreed:- (i) that the India Office should draft a telegram to the Resident in the Persian Gulf , vhieh should be officially cir culated to s and appro-'■ed by ^ all Departments prior ro despatch* giving him the views of the meeting on the following points:- (a) approval of his action up to date; (b) information as to communication to be made by Sir Andrew Ryan to I bn Saud; (c) instructions as to reconnaissance; (d) enquiry as to time table with Sheikh and next step; (e) asking his opinion as to whether any caveat should be entered with the Sheikh in regard to his southern boundary. (ii) that the Foreign Office should draft a telegram to His Majesty's Minister at jec.da to he officially circulated to 3 and approved by* all departments represented on the suo-coinmittee s prior to its despatch* containing the necessary instructions as to the communication to be made to Ibn Saud regarding the United States enquiry as to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913* and the reply returned by His Majesty's Government thereto* making it clear that His Majesty’s Government regard the 'blue line' laid down in Article 11 of the 1913 Convention * and defined and adopted in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention* as remaining operative.I S’ —cuxuuj_u. consiaer as &amp;oon as possible the question of making a further communication to the United States Government in regard to the ‘‘blue Ime-y and particularly whether such a communication could not successfully be made through the United States Embassy m London$, with reference to the recent correspondence regarding the journey and activities of the aircraft which the Standard Oil Company of California have sent out to the hasa Coast or whether it should be made through His Majesty's Embassy at Washington with reference to the enquiry of the United States Embassy at Angora regarding the 1913 Convention.

The following are the further details promised in paragraph 4 of my telegram* I also enclose herewith copies of the letters exchanged between ShaiMi Abdullah and myself, which form a record of the more important points discussed between us. Shaikh Abdullah, as I have explained in my telegram, requested me to confirm what I had said in writing, which request of course it was quite impossible to refuse since otherwise he would not have believed that I spoke on behalf of His Majesty’s Government. The tone of the Shaikh’s letter borders somewhat bn the truculent in parts but his actual demeanour, especially towards the end of our visit, was quite friendly. 2 ./ Gt.

Thus, for example, I thought it better to omit mention in actual writing, (though I explained the matter carefully to the Shaikh verbally), that His Majesty’s Government’s protection depended on his giving the oil concession to the A.P.C.C. - I.3P.C., and to that end merely wrote that this protection ^ would he forthcoming 'in the circumstances whi ch I had , already explained 1 ’* 1 4. I confined the initial interviews to pointing out to the Shaikh the seriousness of his having broken Clause XV of the Treaty by the 'arrangements' which - as he himself had told me at my previous visit - he had made with Ibn Saud. ^'he Shaikh seemed much perturbed at this and, as X stated in paragraph 3 (b) of my telegram quoted above, in on e breath protested that he had not made any arrangement s at all with Ibn Saud, and in the next that if he had not nade arrangements he would he in danger. 5 . X was careful in my conversations to impress upon the Shaikh that His Majesty's Government, in drawing hi s/t ' ^ -3- his attention to his ‘’arraiTgonents”, had no enmity against His Majesty King Ibn Sand and did not desire that there should he any enmity between him (the Shaikh) arxl His Majesty# All that they wished to emphasise was that Q^tar was in treaty relations with Kis Majesty’s Government and not with Ibn Sand* 6# I’he later interviews were devoted to communicat ing to the Shaikh His Majesty’s Government’s decision that a survey by a Company was part and parcel of a concession, and that therefore he was not within his rights to permit a survey without their sanction# Ihe most significant feature of this part of the discussion was the statement in the Shaikh’s letter, already quoted in paragraph 3 (a) of my telegram, to the effect that he did not wish to do anything to displease government ’’unless he considered it within his ri ght to do so”. 7# Shaikh Abdullah verbally as well as in his letter referred to other places, in conversation he actually cited Bahrain and Kuwait, tfiere the Hulers, though they had similar clauses in their Treaties to his Clause V, had been allowed to give concessions to whom they liked# I replied to this by saying that each place and. case must be considered in its own circumstances. He also tried to argue that Clause IV was not binding on him since at the time of making the Treaty(l916) Ibn Saud was not a power as he had became later. I replied that I could not accept this argument for a moment. 8# With regard to the question of the §,atar boundary/■boundary 1 vas careful to confine my conversation on this point to the query as to what the Shaiim considered to he the Qatar boundary. H e pointed out roughly a line somewhat north of Dohat al Salwa - Khor Odaid, himself mentioning that it was shown on the A.F.O.C. map. He further volunteered the information about the Heutral Zone between himself and Abu Dhabi, unrecognised by Ibn Saud, which I have referred to in my telegrsm. H e stated that there was no Neutral Zone between themselves and Ibn Saud. 9* Throughout these interviews both Lieut.-Colonel Loch and I formed the impression that Shaikh Abdullah was dominated bv fear of Ibn Saud. 10* I found the advice of Lieut .-Colonel Loch, who is an old acquaintance of Shaikh Abdullah, of considerable assistance during our visit. sd.

Shaikh 'All and Shaikh Hamad were present, you have asked me to confirm in writing what I told you on behalf of the High British Government. In the course of my conversations during my visit to you on the llth and 12th of March 1934, you, 0* Shaikh, stated that you had made certain arrangements with His Majesty King Bin Sa f ud. When I asked you what these arrangements were you refused to inform me* I informed the High British Government of this and they have instructed me to draw your attention to the fitst part of Clause IV of the Treaty between you and the High British Government dated the 3rd November 1916, in which you undertook that you would not have relations nor corr- -espond with any other fower without the consent of the High British Government; and the High Brivtsh Govexreaent have also instructed me to inform you that by making these arrangements with His Majesty King Bin Sa'ud you have broken the terms of the Treaty and that the High British Government are very displeased at this; further that any arrangements made cannot be permitted to continue. The High British Government have authorised me to inform you that in the circumstances which I have explained to you, they are prepared to give your pro jection on land, in addition to the protection on sea whicb is already given to you* II also reminded you in our oo nver sat ions on the 11th and 12th March that according to the terms of Clause V of the Treaty you should not giye any concession with*» • out the permission of the High British Government. To tais you replied that if any Company other than the Anglo Persian Oil Company were to apply to you for permisssion A to mafce a survey of your territory, you od nsidered that it was within your right to grant that permission, and that, if after such Company had made the survey, they were to ask for a concession, you would then ask permiss* • ion from the High British Government to give it to them. I have been instructed by the High British Government to inform you that they consider that such a survey would be part and parcel of a concession and that therefore you are not at liberty to give/ permission for a survey* In the course of our conversations, with regard to your arrangements with His Majesty King Bin Sa f ud you did not say what these arrangements were, but you stated that if you did not keep up these relations you feared that there would be serious trouble with the Bedouin* In case of such trouble, however, as I have informed you you can rely on the protection on land which I have mentioned above. I have now made clear the position have informed you, OJ Shaikh, of the views of the High British Government and I hope that, if God is willing, arrange- -ments in these matters will be made between you and the High British Government which will he pleasing to the High British Government and also to you. Usual Ending*Translation of a letter dated 19th Dhil Haj 1352 (4th April 1934) from Shaikh iaHttinyt-^T Abdullah bin Jlasim al Thani, Ruler of Qatar, to the Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf* After compliments* I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your kind letter dated 3rd April, equivalent to 18th Dhil Haj 1352, the contwits of which I have duly taken notice* Your Honour referred to the conversations which took place between us in the presence of Colonel Loch and my two sons Shaikh Ali and Shaikh Hamad in which you said that I asked you to put in writing what you told me on behalf of the High British Government. You again referred to the arrangements which you presumed, that I had made with His Majesty King Ibn 8a f ud. I was surprised to »ee that you had fomed an opinion on these matters, which has no shadow of truth, and have imagined things which have no foundation. Then you referred to Clause IV of the Treaty between me and the High British Government. I am sure that I have done nothing contrary to the terms of the Treaty referred to. The fact that I entered into that Treaty when I was not compelled ( by circumstances ) to do so, but made it of my own free will and faith in the High British Government, who are famous for giving freedom and peace to all their allies and friends, for the protection of their rights and for treating then^ell, is evidence of my honest intentions and reliance on the High Briti&amp;i Government. I am sure that my relations with His Majesty King Ibn Sa’ud in no way infringe the spirit of the Treaty or affects my relations with the High British Government; on the contrary I think that it2 is to my interest as well as to that of the Hi$i Bri fcish Government that I should he cn good terms with his Majesty King Ihn Sa’ud, and very friendly (with him) ♦ You said that the High British Government offer me protection on land in addition to the protection by sea which has already been given me* I an very thankful to the High British Government for their good intentions and care on my behalf, but I would leave matters for decision as they arise. You referred to Clause V of the Treaty and said that I do not have the right to grant pe mission for a survey to any Company other than the Anglo Persian Oil Company who may approach me for such pemission, as you considered that it would be part and parcel of a concession. I will give this matter my consideration and will not act in any manner which might displease the High British Government, unless I consider that it is within my ri $it to do so. I am sure Your Honour is aware that nations possess rights which must be observed and liberty which ought to be respected. Your Honour no doubt realises this duty and pride in giving weight to justice above all consi derations. I therefore sincerely hope that the treatment of the High British Government to their allies and friends will be based on justice and equity and with a view to assuring them of the protection of their interests and the enjoyment of freedom in their internal affairs. Your Honour’s duty, as a noble being, is to act accordingly. I wish to draw Your Honour’s attention to the position of the High British Government in otherplaces ^hich. have closer relations than mine ii?ith the High British Government. Some of than have granted concessions to a Company \foich is not a British one, others are at liberty to grant permission for survey and to negotiate with any kind of Company, atoofc while the High British Government are silent, a fact which I cannot understand when I compare their attitude towards me. BotwithGtanding all these facts I will look into the matter and give it my careful consideration* At the same time I would be glad if the Anglo Persian Oil Company would accept the terns arrived at in dis- -cussions ( with the Anglo Persian Oil Company ). You also mentioned that in our conversations abcut the arrangements which you presumed I have made with His Majesty King Ibn Sa’ud that I did not inform you what these arrangements were. I explained to you in our conversation that there were no arrangements besides those which I explained to you and that the presumption which you told me about was merely your own thought. l#hat I told Jfour Honour was that I keep up the friendship and neighbourly friendly relations with His Majesty King Ibn Sa , ud with the object of preventing trouble which the tribes might otherwise create. I assure you of my best intentions, honesty and sincere friendship for the Hi$i British Government, and will be glad to do that which will strengthen the friendly ties between me and the High British Government.

On the other hand, v/hile this issue may in any event have to he faced before long, His Majesty’s Government are reluctant to risk unnecessarily provoking a major dispute Y/ith Ibn Baud, particularly when he is already in difficulties with the Imam of Yemen, Moreover if, as a result of such a challenge to his position, Ibn Baud, v/hile outwardly maintain ing friendly relations, were to endeavour to stir up desert tribes against the Sheikhs of Qatar or (less probably) Abu Dhabi, the resultinp' situation might be difficult, since His Majesty’s Government, while under no formal obligation to defend them by land, might have to consider lending them assistanceo Pending completion of the necessary organisation in Qatar (which must await general agreement with the Sheikh about oil concession and proposed guarantee of protection) this v/ould be most difficult. There is also danger that Ibn Baud, when faced with possibility of having to accept blue line might intrigue to strengthen his informal influence in Qatar or the trucial Sheikhdoms. Possibility must also not be overlooked that Ibn Baud might react to challenge by intensifying his impenetration of hinterland of Qatar and trucial Sheikhdoms - e.g* by creation of further Akhwan settlements or by asserting his supremacy over desert tribes, although we might he in a stronger position diplomatically m regard to this if we had previously made our view of his eastern boundary clear to him as suggested in paragraph /b below« do n is impossible from here to estimate importance or reality of these dangers, hut it seems desirable to examine them fully in order to leave no possible factor out of account6° Main object of His Majesty 1 s Government is to prevent risk of dangerous misunderstanding with American or other interests in the event of oil being found in areas concerned 9 and to make sure that minor Arab rulers, with whom His Majesty's Government are in special treaty relations, do not lall under ibn maud's domination* Recent report from Koweit on extent of Ibn Baud's influence in Qatar peninsula (see Koweit despatch No * C«17 of January 18th to Political Resident) shows that this danger is serious* 7* Alternatives appear to be:~ a* to take no initiative with Ibn Saud for the present ? but to rely (i) on United States Government informing Standard Oil Company of California of position, (ii) on Company not attempting to extend its sphere of operations east of the blue line, and (iii) on Ibn Saud refraining for the present from attempts further to extend or consolidate his informal influence eastv/ardso bo to take some action which would make our views and position clear to Ibn Saud wit.out constituting a direct challenge to his position* This could be done by merely informing him of the United States Embassy's request for conies of the Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1915 and 1914 and of our reply* Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions could be mad to Ibn Sand© Co to make a formal communication to Ibn Saud on the subject of the 'blue line', which he could not ignore and which he would probably regard' as a challenge and tot j. bound4„ 8 ‘ N ° ne ° f a1:)OTe courses ^ free from diffculty but 1 incline to course t&gt; as offering best opportunity of making necessary communication to Ibn Baud in least contentious manner. Please telegraph your views as to the relative advantages and disadvantages of courses a and b. If course b were adopted, course c (which in any case seems open to serious objection) would presumably be unnecessary. 9. As regards paragraph 5 of your telegram No.40 (of karch slst), I agree that it would be best to describe area east of'blue line' as falling within 'British sphere of influence', but in view of terminology of Article 5 of 1914 Convention and of fact that His Majesty's Government do not claim actual sovereignty over this area, it seems desirable to add the words 'appertaining to Qatar'. Main objection to describing area as falling under 'full sovereignty' of Qatar is that it is uncertain whether Sheikh himself would claim such sovereignty, and embarrassing situation would arise if Sheikh should fail to come up to scratch or should represent to Ibn Saud that he was being obliged by His Majesty's Govern- aient against his will to put forward claim. Moreover, if area east of line is claimed primarily on ground that it falls within -British sphere, His Majesty's Government would remain free to adjudicate if necessary between respective claims of Sheikh of Qatar and oheikh of Abu Dhabi. They have already recognised coastal area up to point immediately north of Khor el Odeid as falling within the territory of the latter. . 10.

Sir With reference to India Office letter No. P.Z.1788/34 of the 20th March regarding the proposed Qatar oil concession, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to request you to inform Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare that he concurs in the first and third of the proposals contained in paragraph 8 of the Political Resident^ telegram No. T/53 of the 14th March, namely that the Sheikh of Qatar should be informed that since His Majesty’s Government regard the granting of a right of survey in Qatar as part and parcel of a concession, he cannot grant such a right without their permission; and, in general, that pressure should be brought to bear on the Sheikh to the end that he should agree, in principle, to the granting of the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company or the Iraq Petroleum Company. 2. With regard to Lieutenant-Colonel Powle’s second proposal, namely that it should be pointed out to the Sheikh that by entering into direct relations with King Ibn Saud he has broken Article IV of his treaty with His Majesty’s Government and has incurred their displeasure and, moreover, that any arrangements which he has made with King Ibn SaUd cannot be permitted to stand, Sir John Simon considers that , in principle, it would be useful in the first instance to know/ The Under-Secretary of State India Office.

Since, however, he understands that in the view of Sir Samuel Hoare it is desirable to impose this veto at once, in order that the Sheikh may he under no misapprehension on this point, he is prepared to concur in the course proposed by Colonel Powle, but suggests that the latter should be instructed at the same time to make an attempt to obtain further information regarding the nature of the arrangements in question. 3.

AIR MINISTRY, LONDON, W.G.2. March, 1934, //ith reference to India Office letter P. 2,628/34 of 1st February, 1934, on the subject of an oil concession in Qatar, and of the proposal to give an undertaking of protection to the Sheikh in return for the grant by him of a concession to ' T ■ a British oil company, I am commanded by the Air Council to state, for the information of the Secretary of State for India, that although the subject has recently received consideration by the dovernment, it seems desirable to the Council to record their views on the question df policy r raised / and their answers to the specific questions asked in the letter under reference, 2, In view of the importance to British interests of retaining the special position of His Majesty*s Government in these regions the Council are in agreement with the proposal that an assurance of protection in suitable terms should be given to the Sheikh, subject to certain safeguards and to the K ■ provision of the facilities necessary to implement it. They regard it as of great importance that any such assurance should not contain an undertaking to do more than could in fact be done with the resources available, 3, In the view of the Council, the contingencies against which protection might actually be required may be summed up as follows (i) Formal attack by Ihn Saud, or by some other Power, with the object of capturing the country, (ii) Large scale tribal invasion from Nejd, either osten sibly unauthorised by Ibn Saud, or such as might occur if Saudi Arabia should disintegrate after the death of Ibn Saud.

INDIA l '; : iSE(iii) Minor raiding. 4, The Council are fully mindful of the deterrent effect which would result if it were made generally known that His Majesty's Government would be prepared to support the Sheikh in the event of his being attacked. They must observe, however, that these contingencies all relate to aggression by land from the hinterland; and that in these circumstances it is inevitable that the protective measures, apart from the provision of such detachments as it might be necessary and practicable to land from His Majesty's Warships for local defence of t owns aid aero dromes, and of such other land forces as it might be found practicable to send from elsewhere, must devolve upon the air forces normally located in Iraq. 5, These forces, however, are situated a long distance from Qatar, to which they would have to proceed by a route where the possibility of delays due to climatic conditions cannot be overlooked. Again, these forces, which are already below the strength which the Council have long regarded as necessary in the Middle East, have to meet an ever increasing number and diversity of calls upon them, including reinforce- ment of distant theatres; and the Council certainly could not undertake that they would he available under all circumstances to deal with contingencies in Qatar. These difficulties would for all practical purposes he overcome if a Royal Air Force Squadron were located at Bahrein, but the Council assume that the importance of the issue involved is not in itself such as to justify the provision of such an additional unit, and there fore do not at present propose to suggest such an increase. 6. * Under these conditions the Air Council take the view that the nature and limits of the protection which might be given if the forces are available, are as follow;- i (i) While of course no attempt would be made to set up any physica.1 barrier at the frontier, the threat of the pressure which, in various forms, His Majesty^Government could apply against Ibn Saud would deter nim from openly launching a large scale attack on Qatar, It is probable that it is against this contingency that the Sheikh of Qatar would most value an undertaking on our part, and the Council consider that in normal circumstances it should be possible to implement a guarantee to this effect. (ii) Given an adequate air intelligence organisation, it is probable that sufficient warning of anything in the nature oi^a large scale tribal invasion would be received in time to permit of British Uaval and Air forces being moved up to take action to disperse it and to strengthen the local defence. (iii) It would not be practicable to prevent raids on a smaller scale by highly mobile raiding parties which might number a few hundreds, 7, fhe Council consider that any guarantee given should be subject to the following safeguards (i) Unprovok ed Aggression . It must be made clear that His Majesty's Government could not permit themselves to be drawn into inter vention owing to lack of proper control by the Sheikh over his own tribesmen or by the adoption of * provocative action on his own part on the pre sumption of support from His Majesty's Government, He must be prepared to follow the advice of His Majesty's Government in his attitude towards his neighbours, (ii) Local Protection . For defence against minor raids the Sheikh should provide the necessary local defence forces and forts or other works necessary himself. It may be presumed, hov/ever &gt; that he already does thip in his own interests in the normal course. Care, however, will be necessary to r ensure that as a result of receiving any promise of support from ourselves he does not relax t^hese protective measures. ( iii } B oundaries . The Council understand that the boundaries of Qatar are not as yet defined and consider that it will be important to define the boundaries to which the assurance of protection is in fact to apply. (iv) Means of implementing the commitment . From the air standpoint it is essential (a) that aircraft should be free to fly over Qatar in order that pilots may be familiar with the country; and (b) that when it is necessary to take air action the aircraft shall be free to attack those objectives most likely to give the required results and shall not be confined within the boundaries of the Sheikh's territory. In order to enable the Royal Air Force to take their 8part in implementing a guarantee of protection it will oe neces sary for the Sheikh to grant certain facilities. Details of these have already been furnished in demi-official correspondence between the Air Ministry and the India Ofxice. 9. Prompt and efficient intelligence is essential to successful air action. At present the necessary intelligence resources in Qatar do not exist and it would he essential that the Sheikh should grant permission for an intelligence officer to reside, if necessary, in Qatar; and in any event to allow him or his assistants freedom to travel in Qatar and to establish and use W/T communications in that country. 10. As regards expenditure, the Council naturally cannot at this stage give a firm estimate. On the assumption, however, T -that no additional units are required, the expenditure would be limited to provision of the minor air facilities and the additional experience, however, of such operations does not lead the Air Council to regard this expenditure as likely to be excessive. 11.

Murra settlements one of which was apparently Sikak were represented at Ikhwan conference at Riyadh in 1928.

There is a danger that in our anxiety not to complicate the draft wire which the Cabinet would have to consider, we may overlook the necessity for making quite clear to Fowle that the facilities are an essential condition and I am quite sure that unless we send him a telegram on these lines, we should not be certain of ensuring that the terms recommended by the Chiefs of Staff, upon which the Cabinet agreed to approve the acceptance of this commitment, are complied with* */ CfrliiLa L'fUiJ, |fUv /o R.UrJ(jJL aM' 4 'U Ut.DRAFT TiSiE GRAM In amplification of paragraph 3 of my immediately preceding telegram (the draft vyire submitted to Cabinet), particulars of the facilities required by uhe R.A*F« to enable them to implement guarantee are as follows* Two landing grounds, storage facilities, e.g. petrol dump, bomb store, moorings; freedom to use W/T and permission for R*A*F. intelligence officer to reside in Qatar if necessary and in any event to have freedom for himself or his assistants to move about the country.

The GhieT oT the Air Staff is anxious that there should, he no misunderstanding as to the intelligence facilities required ty the A.A.F. if they are to implement the guarantee of protection which it is suggested should now oe given to the sheikh of Qatar, The draft telegram to the Government of India which emerged from the discussions in the Middle Sast Committee refers merely to landing grounds dnd '’freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel'. The G»A,S* regards it as essential that the Air Ministry should he entitled to maintain a Special Service Officer in Qatar who could move about the country ireely, anu that there snould also he an under standing as regards the storage of bombs, maintenance of a small wireless, etc. Certain of these points are referred to in general terms in y/ing Commander McClaughry's letter of 39th January, P.Z.727/34, anu are dealt with in my reply of 1st February on the same paper. The Air Ministry agree, however, that there wouio he little point in sending supplementary instructions to the Resident with reference to those communications, since the Air Ministry desiderata were stated in them only in the most general terms and the question of communications in particular is not touched on at all. They ask in these circumstances that we should consider, on receipt from them of a more‘detailed statement of the requirements subject to which alone the C#A.S. states that he could implement any guarantee, despatching a supplementary telegram to the Political Resident.

Please see Sir Maurice Hankey 1 s Memorandum to the Cabinet C.P.58(34) attached, on later protection. The draft telegram attached represents the result of discussion in the Official Middle East Sub-Committee on the cuestion of the precise terms of the guarantee to be given to the Sheikh and on the question of the boundary. On both these points it is, it is thought, self-explanatory. 2. It is arguable that it might have been better had the Middle East Committee included in the guarantee some reference to maintaining the 'integrity' of star. But it is not improbable that the question may have to be considered again after Colonel Fowle has broached the matter with the Sheikh and the formula suggested will perhaps meet the case at this stage. 3* Boundary . The southern boundary suggested in the telegram runs across the base of the peninsula. It is a little to the south of the boundary which the Sheikh at the moment claims. The object is to include within the area of atar certain wells, etc. to which the Air Force attach importance. It represents a maxi urn , and we can if necessary confine ourselves to the boundary suggested by the Sheikh himself. 4• A ca v eat i n the event of oil not being found . Please I presume there isno doubt that see on this the resolution recorded by the Middle East this caveat has been dropped and Committee.

DRAFT TELE GRAM,, 1 . His Majesty 1 s Government are prepared to give the Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression hy land in return for the grant ty him of an oil concession to the Anglo-“per s i an Oil Company (acting for the Iraq petroleum Company), but are anxious to confine it to major aggression, i.e., to unprovoked attack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raids. They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the iron^icr , vdiieh they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids. Moreover, here, as in Koweit, they would of course expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his o,.n aeionce end for maintaining order within his own borders. If, as His Majesty's Government hope, a guarantee vutnn these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms 'That in the event of any serious and unprovoked attack His Majesty's Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of his b t ci o fc&gt; • 2 . H is Majesty’s Government have considered, as an alternative, an assurance on the lines of the Eov/eit formula of 1914, i.e., that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. This seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty’s Government are already in treaty relations -i-■1 v/ith him as en independent ruler, while the term 'protection' thus used might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a protectorate. If , however, the Resident thinks that the Sheikh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he may use it so long as it is clearly understood by the Sheikh that the assurance of protection does not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above. 3 . It would of course be essential to obtain from the Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, the facilities required by the Eoyal Air Force to enable the guarantee to be implemented - i.e., prooably two landing grounds and freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel. We assume that no diffi culty will arise about this and that the eheilcn would be willing to provide, on payment, guards ror aerodromes 4 . The question of the precise boundary to be adopted is already under reference to Jon (see India Office telegram. No. 440 uf 16th February, 1934).

Paper No. 1129-3); and Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India covering memoranda and correspondence on this question (paper No. C.O.S. 321). Paper No, M.E.(0) 111. Conclusions of a meeting of Ministers held on the 22nd February, 1S34. THE CHAIRMAN described the circumstances which had led to the Sub-Committee being called upon to meet at such short notice, and explained that the immediate point at issue was to devise a formula by which His Majesty's Government could offer a sufficient measure of protection to the Sheikh of Qatar to induce him to grant the oil concession to the Anglo-persian Oil Company (acuiug xor the Iraq petroleum Company) without at the same time committing themselves too far. MR. LAITHWA1TE said, that we had already a treaty dating from 1916 with trie sheikh as an independent xulei , under the terms of which we had guaranteed him pxotc^tion by sea and our good offices in tne event cf unprovoked aggression by land. The request made by the Sheixh in 1932 had been for the same protection as was enjoyed by Bahrein and Ko we it, ano. he felt no doubu tna u Vvhat tne Sheikh really wanted was a guarantee oi some sort sgainot - 1 -z - 2 - aggression by 1 and s in other words some rather than financial assurances - tangible guarantee which he could .uce as evidence that His Majesty’s Government were behind him. The threat to the BheiKh’s position might come either from Ibn Sand or from Bedouin tribes in tne s^atar hinter— land, in the view of the India Office, which he understood was also that of the Foreign Office, there was no real risi of a formal attack with regular forces by Ibn Baud. Any such attack would represent a definite infringement of the Treaty of Jebda, and Ibn Baud was, so far as could be judged, most unlikely to face so large an issue. On the other hand, it was, of course, quite possible that Ibn Baud might be by no means reluctant to assert his influence in Qatar by giving tacit encouragement to Bedouin tribes of the desert, which were under his influence in varying degrees, to conduct raids into the Sheikh’s territory* The second and perhaps more probable contingency was sporadic raiding by tribes from the Qatar hinterland, with the object of looting or of levying blackmail on the Sheikh or any oil concessionnaire as the price of immunity. !n so far as such tribes were not under Ibn Sand’s control or settled in his dominions, we could not turn to him for redress and the problem would have to be dealt with on ^ T + was relevant in this connection that other lines. It was icj.evcaiu ~ „ c-n of c oine 40 miles between the southern there w as a gap ox htv _ . r*i aimed by the Sheikh of 0,8tar boundary at present ciaimeu the Blue Line of the Anglo -Turkish Convention of 1913, which we might not improbably think it desirable to main tain as the eastern limit of Saudi Arabia. The Secretary of State for India had originallyproposed the grant of 'full” protection,, The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had thought this too extensive ? and had suggested further consideration of a guarantee on the lines of that given to the sheikh of Kovveit in 1914. Sir Samuel fioare on further consideration was disposed to agree with the Chiefs of Staff but did not regard the wording of the Koweit formula (Koweit M shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection^) as suitable in the case of latar. The Koweit formula had been prepared for use in the case of a Turkish province which was being recognised for the first time in 1914 as an independent political entity under British protection. The case of Qatar was entirely different. We were already in Treaty relations with the Sheikh as an independent ruler; we had already promised him protection by sea and good offices by land and all that was now at issue was an extension of 'good offices' in the event of unprovoked aggression by land to 'protection' in tne same circumstances In considering what formula was to 'be employed it was relevant 3 first $ that the meikb. had appealed in Is ?21 at a time when he thought that Ton Saud was likely to endeavour to absorb his principality 3 our undertaxing of 'good offices' and had been informed in reply c^at this meant no more than diplomatic support, secondly ? ohat in the course of his discussions with Captain brior j.n lio^ he had made it clear that he wished to discuss in detail and to examine clause by clause with a view to determining the liabilities falling on both parties s any undertaxing oi protection which he might receive from Bis Majesty's Government. Thirdly that he might be expected to look to the substance rather than the ’wording of any formula and it would be necessary for the Resident to know preciselyo where he stood and how far His Majesty’s Government were prepared to go 'before he started his discussions with the Ghelkhc while the guarantee might therefore be framed in general terms it seemed important that there should be a clear understanding on our part and that of the Resident of precisely what it covered. In this connection he agreed that it was reasonable that the Sheikh (like the Sheikh o Koweit) should be expected to do what was in his power for the policing of and keeping order within his boundaries. But it should be remembered that on the information available the Sheikh’s military forces were likely to be few in number and indifferent in quality. It would no doubt be impossible, as the Chiefs of Staff had suggested, for His Majesty’s Government to give an absolute assurance that they would protect the Sheikh against minor raids or incidents ? but it seemed important not merely to confine any undertaking given to hostile action on the part of Ibn gaud. The guarantee would probably lose much of its value, if it did not cover at any rate the more important Bedouin raids. He suggested that the Sub-Committee should formulate some instructions within which the Resident in the Persian Gulf could negotiate with the Sheikh. in reply to a question by the Chairman, he stated that in the event of tribes under Ibn Baud’s iniluence causing trouble and then seeking sanctuary to the west of the blue line, i.e., within Ibn Saud's boundary, it could always be pointed out that such tribes could be dealt with by our air forces while crossing the intervening 'no man's land’. TIE CHAIRMAN agreed generally with the views expressed by Mr. Laithwaite. He pointed out that any open action by Ibn Baud against Qatar would constitute aviolation of Article 6 of I'bn Baud’s Treaty with His Majesty’s Government so that His Majesty’s Government would inevitably be involved as it would not be possible for them to allow such a violation to take place without sacrificing their own position with other Arabian rulers* On the other hand ordinary raiding would almost certainly be directed against the Company and its operations, which Eis Majesty’s Government would in any case be committed to protect since the sheikh of Qatar would be unable to give the Company adequate protection and His Majesty’s Government could not contemplate allowing any other Government (e*g. the united States Government) to intervene* He therefore felt that a guarantee against major aggression would not in fact increase the existing commitments of His Majesty’s Government* The precise wording of the formula, however, presented considerable difficulty* COLONEL MACKE 8 Y considered that any formula drawn up must be capable of being implemented. It was clear that while we were in a position to retaliate and exact repara tion for any raids that may take place. His Majesty s Government cannot give direct or immediate protection* MR. GRIEVE agreed and suggested that instructions should be given to the Resident in the Persian Gulf witnin •• which negotiations could be undci ocxken* The formula given in paragraphs 1 to o of the Appendix, in the form of a draft telegram to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, was thereupon drawn up and approved by the sub-Committee. THE CHAIRMAN said that the Sub-Committee had also been instructed to make recommendations regarding the geographical limits within which any eventual guarantee should apply*■■■■ FIR. LAITIHAITE said that the question or the southern boundary of Qatar had been investigated in some detail by the India Office in collaboration with the Foreign Office. A note had been prepared* with the conclusion;: of which the Foreign Office, the India Office ana -no Government of India (subject in the case of the Foreign Office to a cavegit on a minor point, and in every case to the comments of the political Resident and the Minister at jedda) had concurred. The note in question had suggested tnat the southern boundary at present claimed by tx.e Sneikh, ' -t .. r T1 ■ t h.p -hg.ee of the uatar conin&gt;_■ u 1 cs., which ran rougnly aciOoo riie ^ might be accepbeo-. GROUP CAPTAXK PECK wished to ensure that the well at Sakak v/as included within our territory. Kg. LAITIhVhlTE suggested that the boundary bUo '‘ ld be defined as running in a south-easterly axrcction head of the r,ohat-as-Salwa Bay, south of Salwa and of Saitoh, to the north end of Khor-al-Cdeid. As the accuracy of existing maps could not he guaranteed within a few miles he thought it would he better to name definite places which it was wished to include within our boundaries, rather taan to draw any arbitrary -Line. CHAIRMAN considered that any attempt definitely to nf rata” at this stage might lead crystallise the boundary ox ^ta. ,^ t.ihi f houvht it might be to considerable future trouble, he -iou b n t. a. wi. om&lt;* »«&lt;»'&gt; ““ * u “'' » «- “' rtioa , • 0 ra dq +'/1 k Government the precise boundaries of Qatar, h ^ - t . ..j-v, r- 4 - their guarantee would not extend should tell the Sheiim tnat their gucti further south than such and such a line. Prom what had been said ha thought this line should run to the soutu of7- Salwa and Sakak so that the wells might he retained in the zone for the protection of which His Majesty’s Government would he responsible. Speaking personally? however? he much disliked the idea of a no-man f s-land. Tne recent experiences of His Majesty’s Government over the Koweit neutral zone had shown that such indeterminate areas always lead to trouble. Generally speaking he felt that it was far better that that area should be definitely placed under the sovereignty of some ruler who could be held directly responsible for what occurred there? than that questions of sovereignty should be left in doubt. Moreover? it was possible that if we laid down any line across the base of the peninsula which might be regarded as the limit of the Sheikh’s territories? it would be much more difficult eventually to get Ibn Saud to agree to t he ’’blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Agreement. He felt that it might sooner or later be necessary to reach some compromise with Ibn Saud in this area and establish a line with a well-defined sovereignty on each side of it. He therefore considered that anything which was now said about a line should be so worded as to leave His Majesty’s Government completely free to negotiate with Ibn Baud later on about, me area beyond that line. x;e realised? however? in view of the explanations given by the India Office, that it would not be practicable to reach any final settlement of this question at the present stage? and? in view of the uncertainty of the whole situation and the possible necessity of punishing fugitive raiders? he quite realised that there might be certain temporary advantages m continuing on the basis of the existence of a neutral area or no-man’s-land between Qatar and Haudi Arabia for the present at any rate. THE SUB-COMMITTEE agreed that the area to which theguarantee should apply should, for tie present, not he regarded as extending to the south of a line drawn from a point at the head of the Dohat-as~Salwa Bay, passing south of Salwa and of Sakak to the coast immediately north of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet (paragraph 4 of Appendix)* THIS CHAIRMAN then raised the question of the suggestion Cavea t in event of oil not teing foundo which had 'been put forward that a caveat should be attached to the proposed guarantee of protection providing that the guarantee should not apply in the event of oil not being found or, if found, not being exploited. It was explained that the Sub-Committee.were not asked to give a specific recommendation on this point, but after some discussion it was agreed that the point was of such importance and might have so vital a bearing on the question of the proposed guarantee itself, that it could not be left out of account, MR. GRIEVE pointed out that it would be difficult to ask the Sheikh to give the concession to tne I.P.C* ii our guarantee was subject to this condition, which could noc properly be regarded as forming part of the bargain. What we required from the Sheikh v/as that he should give the concession to the Company, noo that he should guarantee the production of oil. To subject the guarantee to a condition dependent on unknown future circumstances would greatly reduce its value in the Sheikh’s eyes. THE CHAIRMAN said that in his view the x^oposed caveat would completely nullify the effect of the guarantee. Moreover the guarantee was not being offered merely in return for the oil but in return for the establishment of a greater degree of British influence and the exclusion of certain other foreign influences. The effect of the proposed bargain withthe Sheikh would he greatly to strengthen the position of His Majesty T s Government in Qatar* We had reached the stage where it was necessary to go forward or backward, and unless the bargain were now concluded it might he very difficult adequately to maintain our influence. On the other hand, the necessity for giving this guarantee oifered an exceptionally favourable opportunity for establishing our influence in an area which, chiefly owing to the development of air communications along the Gulf, was of great potential and growing importance. GROUP CAPTAIN PECK pointed out that if oil were not found / in Qatar there would he less likelihood of aggression, so that it would he less likely that we should he called upon to implement the guarantee* MR* LAITHWAITE stated that full consideration had been given to this question, and as, in any event, it would he of advantage to His Majesty's Government to render the Sheikh secure against aggression, the insertion of a caveat had not been thought necessary. On the information available it was extremely probable that the Iraq Petroleum Company, even if oil was found, might not wish actively to develop it, and it would be important at the same time from our point of view that the concession should go to and be held by them, in order to keep the oil field from passing into the hands of a foreign company. In reply to a question by Captain King, he expressed the view that, desirable as it might be to secure some more positive undertaking from the Iraq Petroleum Company in the event of their securing the concession m regard to local refining of oil found in Qatar, it was extremely improbable that we should be able to improve on the formula which had been accepted by the Koweit Oil Company, after discussion with the interested departments here, in the case of Koweit.THE SUB-COMMITTSE agreed that to put forward or insist on a caveat on the lines proposed would jeopardise the negouiations and greatly impair the value of the proposed guarantee, A recommendation to this effect (given as Conclusion (h)) was agreed to. CONCLUSIONS THE SUB-COMMITTEE unanimously reached the following Conclusions - (a) They recommend that the terms of the guarantee to he offered to the Sheikh, and . the limits of the area to which that guarantee should apply, should he on the lines pimposed in the attached draft telegram (Appendix). (b) The question of a caveo»t providing that the guarantee shall not apply in the event of oil not being found, or, if found, not being exploited, is mentioned in the papers circulated to the Sub-Committee. This point is not directly referred to them for an opinion. It is, however, so closely bound up with that of the terms of the guarantee that the Sub-Committee feel it their duty to record their opinion upon it. They appreciate the arguments in favour of a caveat of this nature, but are of opinion that its addition to the proposed assurance would very seriously diminish the value of that assurance to the Sheikh. It is moreover relevant that the Iraq Petroleum Company, on the information available, may well adopt a very conservative policy as regards the development of any oil found in Qatar. In the opinion of the Sub committee, even to suggest such a cave at would, apart from other consequences,'“gravely jeopardise the chances of securing the con cession for the Iraq petroleum Company, while insistence on it would, in their view, inevitably result in failure to achieve this object. 2, Y/hitehall Gardens, S.W.l, 23rd February, 1934.APV mTDJX . DPJ&gt;? T TEL DQ MM. !• His Majesty 5 s Government are prepared to give the Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression by land in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company ) 9 but are anxious to confine it to major aggression, i.e., to unprovoked attack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raidso They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the frontier, which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in.no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids. Moreover, here, as in Koweit, they would of course expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order Y/ithin his own borders. If, as His Majesty's Government hope, a guarantee within these limits will satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms - 55 That in the event of any serious and unprovoked attack His Majesty's Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of his State 55 • 2. His Majesty’s Government have considered, as an alternative, an assurance on the lines of the Koweit formula of 1914, ii.e», that Qacar shall be recognibe&gt;-t as an independent principality under British protection This seems uniike1y to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty’s Government are already in treaty relations d--ii' with him as an independent ruler, while the term protection’ thus used might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a Protectorate. If, however, the Resident thinks that the Sheikh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he may use it so long as it is clearly understood by trie Sheikh that the assurance of protection does not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above. 3. It would of course be essential to obtain from the Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, the facilities required by the Royal Air Force to enable the guarantee to be implemented - i.e., probably two landing grounds and freedom of movement for the necessary British personnel. We assume that no difficulty will arise about this and that the Sheikh would be willing to provide, on payment, guards for aerodromes. 4. The question of the precise boundary to be adopted is already under reference to you (see India Office telegram No. 4-40 of 16th February, 1934). Subject to your further views His Majesty’s Government consiaer that the area to wnich the above guarantee should apply should for t he present not be regarded as extending to the south of a line drawn from a point at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay passing south of Salwa and of Sakak to the coast immediately north of the Khor-a1-Odeid inlet. tx I* ti e ** ?i W j;9rfi ^C RET .

Proposal to guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar. (Previous C.I.D. Paper No. 1129-B.) Memorandum by the Secretary of State for India. 1 I CIRCULATE for the information of my colleagues a report on the above subject, Paper No. C.O.S. 322,* prepared on my suggestion by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 2. The report is self-explanatory and I venture to trouble my colleagues with it only because no meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence is likely to take place in the near future, and it is urgent to issue instructions to the Political Resident. I am in general agreement with the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff, as summarised in paragraph 13 of their report, save on two points :— (a) the terms of the guarantee to be given to the Sheikh of Qatar (paragraph 5), and (b) the caveat suggested by the Chiefs of Staff in the event of oil not being found (paragraph il). 3. As regards the first of these points I would remark in the first place that Ibn Saud is already committed by his treaties with us to recognising the special treaty relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh of Qatar; secondly, that the protection, a guarantee of which it is now proposed to give the Sheikh of Qatar, will have primarily in view, not the regular forces of Ibn Saud (any attack by his regular forces would bring about an entirely different situation affecting the whole of our relations in the Gulf), but the depredations of wandering Bedouin tribes of the desert. I agree at the same time with the Chiefs of Staff that the guarantee which it was originally proposed to give (“ full protection” against landward aggression) is too widely stated and that a more restricted guarantee would be preferable. But the Koweit formula, to which they refer, is not entirely appropriate to a Sheikhdom such as the Sheikhdom of Qatar. My own provisional view is that it would suffice to give the Sheikh a guarantee of “protection against unprovoked aggression by land,' but I would suggest that I should be authorised, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to prepare a suitable formula on this point for use by the Resident. 4. I appreciate the importance of the second point, but if an offer of protection is to carry weight with the Sheikh it is important that it should not be hedged round with conditions which are likely to deprive it of all its value in the Sheikh’s eyes. Moreover, the Iraq Petroleum Company, if they secure the concession, may well wish to adopt a very conservative attitude towards development of oil found. Here again I would suggest that I should be authorised to discuss the matter further with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to * Xot attached. Already circulated as C.I.1A Paper Xo. 1129-B. [9688]2 fl see to what extent, if at all, it is desirable to accompany any undertaking we may give by a specific caveat. 5. The course of action which I would submit for the consideration of my colleagues in the circumstances described above is as follows : (a) That instructions should immediately be sent to the Political Resident in ^ the Persian Gulf to initiate negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar on lines which have already been agreed interdepartmentally; that he should further be informed that His Majesty’s Government accept the principle of protection, but that the precise terms of the guarantee to be given are under examination, and that in these circumstances he should endeavour (as he has suggested) to lead the Sheikh to raise the question of protection himself, and, if and when the Sheikh does so, inform him that the issue raised is one of such importance that the instructions of His Majesty’s Government must be taken upon it. This will give us time to reach agreement here interdepartmentally on the terms and nature of our guarantee, while avoiding any delay in the initiation of general discussions between the Resident and the Sheikh. . , . . (b) That the precise terms of the guarantee to be given and the reference, it any. to be made to a caveat in the event of oil not being found should form the subject of discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself, with a view to instructions being sent in such terms as we may, after further consideration, consider suitable, the terms of any such instructions to be circulated in due course for information to the Committee of Imperial Defence.

(Also Paper No. C.O.S. 322.) COMMITTEE OF IMPERIAL DEFENCE. PERSIAN GULF Proposal to Guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar. Report by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee. General Situation. THE peninsula of Qatar lies between the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. This peninsula is at present ruled by a Sheikh—reported to be a somewhat obstinate old man— who exercises no effective rule over the hinterland between the base of the peninsula and the territory of King Ibn Sand. The Sheikh is in special relations with His Majesty’s Government which preclude him inter alia from granting an oil concession without their consent. With their approval the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been negotiating for a concession, which they would transfer, if they obtained it, to the Iraq Petroleum Company—a Company registered in Great Britain, whose capital is held by an international group, some 30 per cent, of which is British. Difficulty has arisen over terms, and there is now strong reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, who are purely American in composition, are making overtures to the Sheikh, and will exert themselves to obtain a concession. We understand that His Majesty’s Govern ment consider it most important to prevent foreign interests from establishing themselves in the Gulf Sheikhdoms. In these circumstances the question of possible inducements to the Sheikh to grant a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been under consideration interdepartmentally in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India. As a result it appears that the only inducement likely to turn the scale in favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is an undertaking to grant the Sheikh protection against landward aggression. Question under reference. 2. We have accordingly been asked by the Prime Minister for an expression of our views as to whether the advantage of keeping foreign oil interests out of the Qatar Peninsula justifies the assumption by His Majesty’s Government of an undertaking to protect the Sheikh against landward aggression. Importance of British Interests. 3. We fully appreciate the importance of retaining the special position of His Majesty’s Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, and agree that any concession for oil that may be granted in the Qatar Peninsula should be given into the hands of a company registered in Great Britain. W e have accordingly examined the commitment involved, and consider that certain safe guards are required. These are as follows.mm 2 .0, Extent of Commitment. ^ • n 4 We note that it is proposed to authorise the Resident m the Persian Gulf to nromise the Sheikh, in exchange for the grant of the concession to a British conSed combine the grant of full protection against aggressron by land. It would appear that there is no definite line of demarcation between the territory „ of the Sheikh and that of Ibn Sand, and, consequently, no limit to the area for irh ch responsibility for protection would be undertaken. We consider, therefore, kat some definite boundary should be fixed before any guarantee of protection is made. Terms of Guarantee. 5. As the main object in undertaking this commitment appears to be to secure the Sheikh from aggression, or any attempt at absorption, by Ibn Saud, we suggest that any guarantee that may be given should be expressed m more general terms than is at present proposed. Though the actual wording to be adopted is not our immediate concern, we would suggest that the guarantee of protection should be similar to that given in 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit, namely, that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British ^ If this or some similar formula is adopted, it will be clear to Ibn Saud that any aggression against the Sheikh’s territory would be regarded by His Majesty s Government as a hostile act. Guarantee only Applicable to Unprovoked Aggression. 6. We attach special importance to the guarantee being made applicable only in the event of unprovoked aggression. We consider that the Sheikh should consent to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government in his attitude towards his neighbours, and that he should be categorically warned that the adoption of a provocative attitude or any indulgence in raiding will result in the forfeiture of protection. Local Protection. 7. It is obviously impracticable to guarantee protection, either to the Sheikh’s subjects or even to the oilfields, against the sporadic raiding which we understand is endemic in this region. We consider, therefore, that the Sheikh should be informed that responsibility for law and order in his territory remains in his hands and that he will be expected to provide the necessary means for securing the local protection of the plant and properties of the Oil Company. Facilities for the Royal Air Force. 8. In the event of our having to implement our guarantee by the employ ment of air forces, it would be necessary for aircraft to operate from landing grounds in the peninsula, probably near Doha, the principal, if not the only port. Though landing grounds exist at Bahrein and Yas Island, some ninety miles north and south respectively of Doha, it will be necessary to establish one or more landing grounds in Qatar in peace time, together with the necessary storage and other facilities. Intelligence. 9. In order to enable effective action to be taken, timely warning of any hostile gathering or intended raid is necessary. As our existing intelligence resources in these regions are very limited, we consider that some provision should be made to supplement the existing sources of information and to foster relations with the friendly tribes. We consider that the Sheikh should grant permission for a British Intelligence or Political Officer to reside in Qatar, if necessary, and in any event to have freedom for himself and his assistants to move about the country. Means of Implementing our Commitment. 10. Should it be necessary to implement our commitment, dependence will primarily be placed on the Royal Air Force. In the event of emergency, theSnTccordi'nf flig t ht ? 0m :Doha - woul d be called upon to take action, according to the situation, to disperse any hostile g-atherino^ anrl render any large-scale attack by Ibn Saud’s tribafforces imnossib e 8 ’ ll will h! noted that owing to the accident of water, raiding parS are tied Howl tn ^ p^rmltte^to uL° f air aCh '- 14 essential that aircraftXuld q e permitted to take action against those objectives most likely to give the required results, and that their use should not be confined to whatever boundaries the Sheikh’s domain may eventually be fixed. uounuaries The presence of one of His Majesty’s ships on the coast of the peninsula “ —r “s «- S« g ~ «? a t&gt; an i e , mer ?' enC '’ dev f lo Ped which it was beyond the power of the Navy and Royal Air Force to deal with with the forces available locally, we would suggest that the Government of India should be approached with a view to the provision 01 the necessary troops for the period of the emergency. „ consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can be lulhlled, since with our existing forces it should be possible to deter Ibn Saud from making any foimal attack and to disperse and to punish any major raids Caveat in event of Oil not being found. ll- are n0t yet aware of tile approximate situation of the oilfields, nor even if oil has been located in workable quantities. Wh consider it desirable that some caveat should be entered to the effect that our guarantee of protection is dependent upon oil being found and the concession taken up and worked within some limited time. Reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence. 12. As a matter of procedure, we presume that the proposed commitment will not be entered into without prior consideration at the Committee of Imperial Defence, on which all Government Departments are represented. This, we under stand, would follow precedents already established in the case of the military aspects of the Iraq Treaty, the proposed Treaty with Egypt and the Status of Tangier. Conclusion. 13. Our conclusions may be summarised as follows :— (1) — {a) That the principle of endeavouring to secure the Qatar oil concession for a company registered in Great Britain is in the best interests of His Majesty’s Government (paragraph 3). (&amp;) That as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection, the boundary of Qatar should be decided upon (paragraph 4). (&lt;?) That any guarantee given should be framed in more general terms than those at present proposed (paragraph 5). {d) That it should be made clear that the guarantee applies only to unprovoked aggression, and that the Sheikh must take reasonable steps for his own protection and for the safety of British and foreign personnel (paragraphs 6 and 7). {e) That a landing ground, with the necessary storage facilities, should be provided in Qatar, and that an adequate system of intelligence should be instituted (paragraphs 8 and 9). (2) We consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can, if necessary, be fulfilled, and that there is no objection to a suitably qualified assurance being given to the Sheikh (paragraph 10).

[9698] B9 PROPOSAL TO GUARANTEE PROTECTION TO THE SHEIKH OF QATAR. (C.I.D. Papers Nos. 1129-B and 1133-B.) The Committee of Imperial Defence had under consideration a by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee (C.I.D. Paper Na 1129-B) together witn a Memorandum by the Secretary of State for rmba Papei' . 3 B), regarding a proposal to guarantee protection to the Sheikh of Qatar m the Persian GulU as an inducement to the Sheikh to grant the concession for oil m his territories to a Company registered in Great Britain. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question of what assurance, if any, should be given to the Sheikh had been referred to the Committee of Imperial Defence by the Cabinet (Cabinet 6 (34), Conclusion 3). SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that there were two main points at issue. Firstly, whether any assurance of protection was necessary; and, secondly, whether the commitment entailed was likely to be an extensive one. In ms view it was absolutely necessary to give the Sheikh an assurance of our protection. He regarded it as an axiom of Imperial policy to prevent intervention by foreign Powers along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, along which our Imperial air route now ran. He was convinced that the sole measure which would avoid the grant of a concession for oil in the Qatar peninsula to an American Company —the Standard Oil Company—was an offer to the Sheikh to guarantee protection against landward aggression. If the concession fell into American hands the commitment would still exist, as in the event of trouble His Majesty s Govern ment would be called upon to afford protection to any American or other foreign nationals who were engaged on work in that region. He maintained, therefore, that some guarantee of protection was necessary. He did not consider that this guarantee would involve any more serious commitment than at present existed. There was, in his view, little likelihood of our becoming involved in a war with Ibn Saud, as by the Treaty of Jedda, 1927, Ibn Saud had undertaken to respect the special treaty relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh of Qatar. Any military measures that would have to be taken to implement this guarantee would, he envisaged, take the form of operations by our air forces against the Bedouin tribes in the hinterland. This was the sort of commitment which the Royal Air Force in the Middle East were constantly being called upon to face. He pointed out that the Qatar peninsula was comparatively easy to defend, and contemplated that the sole measures necessary would be an occasional demonstration by air forces or visit by His Majesty’s ships. He noted that the Royal Air Force would require to establish landing grounds and other ground organisation in the peninsula, and pointed out how useful this would be, not only for operations but also in connection with our eastern air route. While admitting that the commitments were uncertain and might possibly be embarrassing, he maintained that very little additional military commitments and expense were likely to be involved. LORD HAILSHAM was not sure that he could accept the contention that the grant of the concession to an American syndicate would still necessitate His Majesty’s Government protecting foreign subjects in the Qatar peninsula. He pointed out that the United States Government gave no protection to His Majesty’s subjects in places, such as Cuba, which might be regarded as within American spheres of influence. He saw no reason why the United States Govern ment should not be told that His Majesty’s Government cannot guarantee to protect American subjects in an uncivilised country like Qatar, and that they came there at their own risk. In the event—which he agreed was unlikely—of war with Ibn Saud, he considered that the defence of the peninsula would prove difficult, and was, there fore, an extensive commitment. He pointed out that the Chiefs of Staff, in their Report, had stated that it was impossible to prevent minor local raids. In his view His Majesty’s Government would be undertaking a liability against formidable attack by Ibn Saud or against raids which could not be prevented. R the concession were granted to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company as a result of ourratiomLj ^ Qatar ill essionfor,;, afld, se»: ie.

In the case of the Bahrein oil concession ffi! Majesty s Government had a good reason for diverting the concession to BHtish interests, as m that case Bahrein was a potential naval base In the case of Oataf P f ch ex . cus , e exls ‘ed. .In his view, therefore, the obligations and risks Hkely L be involved were serious, and he was doubtful whether the importance of rXTnvolved 001106881011 t0 ' COmpany regiStered in Great Brltain Justified the LORD LONDONDERRY stated that he regarded the maintenance of our position in the Persian Gulf of paramount importance. In his view an under taking to grant protection would go a long way towards re-establishing, in the eyes of the local tribes, our prestige, which had recently suffered severely owing to the withdrawal of our air route from Persia and other causes. He considered that the undertaking to afford protection would not involve any great commitment as Ibn baud was unlikely to prove hostile, and, if necessary, effective pressure could always be brought on him. In his view the point at issue was the phraseology in which our undertaking should be given. In connection with this, it should be made clear to the Sheikh that he must be prepared to take measures for his own local protection. In the event of any major raid assistance could be given by our Royal Air Force in the Middle East, who were continually standing by to deal with such contingencies. SIR EDWARD ELLINGTON considered that any organised attack was unlikely. The most probable source of trouble would be from tribes in the hinter land. These tribes were under some form of allegiance to Ibn Saud, and might very well get out of hand and endeavour to convert the coastal Arabs to Wahabi doctrines. In this event the despatch of a squadron of aircraft and some armoured cars to the Qatar peninsula should be sufficient to maintain order. THE PRIME MINISTER referred to paragraph 12 of the Chiefs of Staff Report (C.I.D. Paper No. 1129-B), where it was presumed that the proposed commitment would not be entered into without prior consideration at the Committee of Imperial Defence. He assumed that Conclusion 1 (a), i.e., the principle of endeavouring to secure the concession for British interests, was generally agreed to. In connection with Conclusion 1 (5), i.e., that as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection the boundary of Qatar should be decided on, he observed that, in the event of oil being found beyond the boundary, i.e., to the south of the peninsula, there might still be an obligation to protect whatever Company— British or American—was engaged on this work. SIR SAMUEL HOARE stated that he agreed with the Chiefs of Staff that a definite geographical limit of our responsibility should be settled. He considered that, in the event of the Standard Oil Company, or any other American concern, becoming involved in trouble within Ibn Sand’s territory, His Majesty s Government had no obligation to go to their aid. THE PRIME MINISTER noted that, as regards the form of guarantee (Conclusion 1 (c )), the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had suggested that Qatar should be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. SIR SAMUEL HOARE considered that this wording was too general to be acceptable to the Sheikh. We had already a treaty with him as an independent ruler, and already guaranteed him protection by sea and good offices by land. At the same time, he agreed with the Chiefs of Staff that the formula first proposed had been put in rather too wide terms. He thought that something more specific was required, and suggested that the Departments concerned should work out an agreed formula. SIR ERNLE CHATFIELD stated that the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had viewed the problem from two aspects. Firstly, whether protection be given from any major attack by Ibn Saud. They ha een m orme *a it was possible that Ibn Saud might endeavour to support the efforts of the Standard Oil Company to secure the Qatar concession with a absorbing Qatar. Thev considered, therefore, that what the Sheikh requ ed ^ ^ M . , Government would give him assistance was some assurance that His Majesty s ijrovei nmen t y. in the event of aggression or any attempt at absorption oy Ibn Saud. &gt; [9698] B 2 /thought that the publication of such a guarantee would be sufficient deterrent to any attempt by Ibn Baud. Secondly, there was the question of protection from minor raids, which could not properly be dealt with by British forces. The Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee had been given to understand that it had been suggested by the Resident and the Government of India that the grant of protection should not absolve the Sheilds from taking his own measures, so far as possible, to defend his principality They agreed with this view. THE PRIME MINISTER agreed that the primary responsibility for law and order should fall on the Sheikh himself, and that this should be made clear to him. As the commitments involved were now clear, the main question at issue was the framing, in suitable form, of the assurance to be given. SIR ROBERT VANSITTART stated that the Foreign Office could not admit that there were any areas in which we should be precluded from giving protection to British subjects if trouble became bad enough and American protection for British subjects was insufficient. He mentioned the case of Nicaragua, where we did, in fact, send a ship some six years ago in such circumstances and very much against American wishes. He also pointed out that if the recent troubles in Cuba had happened to become much worse and the United States had completely failed to give any adequate protection, the Foreign Office would very likely have thought it necessary to ask that a ship should be sent there. If, therefore, we had taken such action vis-a-vis the Americans, as, indeed, was the case, we obviously could not count upon the United States to refrain from similar action in the Persian Gulf if we had failed to prevent the concession from falling into their hands. SIR ARCHIBALD MONTGOMERY-MASSINGBERD observed that a guarantee against raiding by nomad tribesmen would entail full protection. SIR SAMUEL HOARE agreed, but considered that a formula could be devised which would make it clear that the Sheikh would continue to be responsible for protection against minor raids. The possibility of action against the Bedouins could not be entirely neglected. The question was merely a matter of degree. LORD LONDONDERRY said that, in his view, His Majesty’s Forces would only be called upon to act in cases where the authority of the Sheikh was definitely challenged. SIR JOHN MAFFEY suggested that it was possible that our ideas of &lt;£ protection ” and the Sheikh’s ideas might be different. Did we yet know what was in the Sheikh’s mind? There were suggestions on our side of sending a Political Agent, creating an Intelligence Service, making aerodromes, &amp;c. Might not these suggestions make the American Company’s terms look more attractive than ours to an independent Ruler ? Perhaps when our negotiators got closer to grips with the Sheikh they might find him willing to define protection in terms of finance, e.g., a subsidy enabling him to increase his Levies. If negotiations could proceed on these lines, we might perhaps avoid more serious commitments and guarantees. SIR SAMUEL HOARE said that the case had been carefully examined by the Government of India, the Resident in the Persian Gulf, who was the expert concerned, and the competent Departments at Home. As the result, he was assured that the measure most likely to induce the Sheikh to grant the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company was a guarantee of protection against aggression by His Majesty’s Government.

Conclusions of the 29*A Meeting of the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East. “ (a) They recommend that the terms of the guarantee to be offered to the Sheikh, and the limits of the area to which that guarantee should apply, should be on the lines proposed in the attached draft telegram. (h\ The question of a caveat providing that the guarantee shall not apply in the event of oil not being found, or. if found, not being exploited, is mentioned in the papers circulated to the Sub-Committee. This point is not directly referred to them for an opinion. It is, however, so closely bound up with that of the terms of the guarantee that the Sub-Committee feel it their duty to record their opinion upon it. They appreciate the arguments in favour of a caveat of this nature, but are of opinion that its addition to the proposed assurance would verv seriously diminish the value of that assurance to the Sheikh. It is, moreover, relevant that the Iraq Petroleum Company, on the information available, may well adopt a very conservative policy as regards the development of any oil found in Qatar. In the opinion of the Sub-Committee, even to suggest such a caveat would, apart from other consequences, gravely jeopardise the chances of securing the concession for the Iraq Petroleum Company, while insistence on it would, in their view, inevitably result in failure to achieve this object. ’ Terms of Guarantee to be Offered to the Sheikh and Limits of the Area to which that Guarantee should apply. Formula agreed to by the Standing Official Sub-Committee for Questions Concerning the Middle East. 1. His Majesty’s Government are prepared to give the Sheikh a guarantee in respect of unprovoked aggression by land in return for the grant by him of an oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting for the Iraq Petroleum Company), but are anxious to confine it to major aggression, i.e., to unprovoked attack by the ruler of a neighbouring State, and to major Bedouin raids. They could not, without establishing a regular defensive system on the frontier, which they cannot contemplate, give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross the Qatar boundary, and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor raids. Moreover, here, as in Koweit, they would, of course, expect the Sheikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining order within his own borders. If, as His Majesty’s Government hope, a guarantee within these limits wdll satisfy the Sheikh, they suggest that it might be in the following terms :— “ That in the event of any serious and unprovoked attack His Majesty s Government will come to his assistance and maintain the independence of his State.” 2. His Majesty’s Government have considered, as an alternative, an assurance on the lines of the Koweit formula of 1914, i.e., that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. This seems unlikely to satisfy the Sheikh, since His Majesty's Government are already in treaty relations with him as an independent ruler, while the term ‘ £ protection thus used might alarm him by suggesting the idea of a Protectorate. If, however, the Resident thinks that the Sheikh would prefer it, either alone or with addition of formula suggested above, he may use it so long as it is clearly understood b} the Sheikh that the assurance of protection does not go beyond the limits specified in paragraph 1 above. 3. It would, of course, be essential to obtain from the Sheikh, in return for any guarantee given, the facilities required by the Royal Air Force to enable ti.e guarantee to be implemented— i.e., probably two landing grounds and freedom of* Not printed. movement for the necessary British personnel arise about this and that the Sheikh would be guards for aerodromes.

Private SeG rfi_tg_rv, #ith reference to the Secretary of State’s note : elor about Qatar protection, I attach a note, which, for convenience, is drawn up in the form of points dealing with (a) ihe importance of accepting this commitment to our interests in the Gulf; (b) Against whom the protection is needed; (c) The extent of the commitment likely to be involved. (General Coleridge has seen the papers and will be ready to go with S/C to the C.I.D. to-morrow. S/C may also wish for a Political Department representative?

These notes will I hope be sufficient for the Secretary of State’s purpose and should convince the Committee (a) that the guarantee is essential and (b) that the military commitment (which, so far as can be foreseen would only involve the occasional use of the R.A.F. against1 ^ wandering tribes) is not serious. Even if no formal guarantee were given we would still have to protect the concessionaire, if occasion arose. If some members of the Cabinet were nervous about undertaking this commitment, we may assume that they will hesitate before accepting the Government of India's proposal to v/iden greatly the Afghanistan commitment. L.J.K. 22.2.34.6/ CF r&gt;; A£A^Ll Miiintenance of special British position on the Arab littoral is of carainalimportance. It affects the air route ana comunications with India ana the i£&amp;©t. It will be still Uiore important if we fail to keep Hen jam and have to concentrate in Bahrein. The geographical position of Qatar, midway between Bahrein ana the semi-barbarous Irucial areas, and hall-way uown the Arab littoral of the Gulf is ol great importance* The establishment of non-British interests in it must sooner or later react unfavourably on our position in Bahrein and on the Trucial Coast. 3. It is vital in these circumstances (the Resident and the Government of India agree) to keep our influence in ,*atar * 4* The present decision Is one of crucial importance* Tie cannot hope to sterilise Qatar from the oil standpoint* The Jt&amp;ndard Oil, who have great political iniluence, are interested* If the a«P« 0*G* do not get the concession it will be most difficult to prevent it from going to the standard Oil. 5* The Sheikh has little military force and can probably ive limited protection only to any oil concessionnaire* IX the Standard Gil get the concession arm the Sheikh cannot defend tnem against Bedouin, etc., indirect liability for giving necessary protection will fall back on H.i.G. If H.m.G* are not prepared to give it, the Standard Gil will either make terms with Ibn laud (that means the establishment of a dominating Saudi-American influence in Qatar) or endeavour to brin^ -hi f*3* forces* Wither would be politically disastrous from our point of view.6. In tliese circumstances the case for our proposal it a strong one. Me would give the jheikh protection against unprovoked aggression hy land. ,e should expect him to take his own measures to far as possible to defend his principality. In return we woulu hope to get an oil concession lor a company registereu la Great Britain with a substantial British element in it, and we would have consolidated our position in an area very important strategically, geographically and politically. 7. .-■gainst whom is protection neariau? a tar is bounded on three sides by the sea. Its southern boundary is uncertain. «e are working on this; the r suit will probably be that we accept a line running across the ease of toe peninsula. Ibn Baud's boundary is also uncertain, but we shall probably take our stand on toe line agreed with toe Turks in 1913, called the 'Blue i-.ine'. if we do, there will be an area of inueteruinate control, largely peopled by Bedouin, between Ibn Baud and ourselves. The Bedouin in that area will be unoer Ibn Baud's Influence, but pnobubl., not unuer his effective control. 3o long as we do not recognise toe area as oelonging to him he wlil certainly be able to disclaim responsibility for toam. ive do not want to give him this area because it will bring his recognised frontier still further east up to the Irucial sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi. a. The Foreign Office and India Office agree that there is no real likelihood of Ibn Baud making &amp; formal attack /.itli regular troops on Qatar.

As the Chiefs of staff point out, there are difficulties in a guarantee of protection against Bedouin. But we must face the fact that if oil in Qatar is going to oe developed protection against Bedouin will have to be given either by us to the A.F.Q.C. in return for the grant of a concession by the sneikh, or by us to the standard Oil so that we can keep our position in - a tar or uy I bn Caua and/or the U. c.

Tne Ghlels of staff contemplate the introuuction of ground troops only in a grave emergency where naval and air forces are insufficient.

Note by Mr. .valton . The main points are that if an oil concession is granted (and it would be very difficult permanently to refuse the Sheikh permission to grant one) we shall in practice be committed to protecting the concessionaire; if the concessionaire is a wholly foreign company the burden of the responsibility for protecting bin will be all the heavier; therefore we might as well give the Sheikh the guarantee, and thereby secure the great advantage of getting the concession for a largely or substantially British concessionaire.10, DOWNING STREET, WHITEHALL. The Cabinet wished the Qatar question to go to the C.I.D. There will therefore be a C.I.D. late to-morrow (Thursday) afternoon, at H in the House of Commons. Some members of the Cabinet were nervous of what quite wrongly they thought to be a serious new commitment. I should be glad if the office could give me any additional points that there may be (perhaps there are not any) to show that (1) the commitment is not likely to be extensive (2) the commitment is quite essential to our interests in the Gulf. S.H., 21 / 2 .Private Secret&amp;ry, The answer to the Secretary of State's questions is as follows:- (1) Instructions agreed interdepartmentally, (a) Resident to approach Sheikh at once personally; (b) Remind him that his Treaties preclude grant of concession without approval of H.M.Government. (c) Warn him that H.M.Government in view of their special treaty relations with him would not be prepared to agree to grant of a concession to a Company not at least partly British. (Foreign Office agree that as I.P.C. contains an American element this could not be represented as shutting 'hpen door' to Americans in Qatar.) (d) Make it clear to Sheikh that H.M.Government want the A.P.O.C.-I.P.C. to get the concession, and hint in general terms at difficulty likely to arise for Sheikh if he does not take our advice. Resident is not however to suggest that Ibn Saud is behind American competitors for Qatar concession or that grant of concession to them ?/ould lead to Sheikh's absorption by Ibn Saud. The first argumentmay frighten the Sheikh; the second get round to Ibn Baud and make him think we regard absorption as a possibility despite fact that by Treaty he recognises our special Treaty relations with Qatar. (2). Need for further action on our part. 1. The A.P.O.C. exclusive exploration licence expires in August 1934. The Sheikh will then be free to entertain overtures from other parties. Standard Oil of California are already understood to be working on him. 2. Sheikh cannot erant concession without our consent But if negotiations with A.P.O.C. break down and Standard Oil make him a really good offer, it will in practice be most difficult to refuse our consent both because of detrimental effect on Qatar finances and because of probable strong diplomatic pressure by U.S.Government. If concession goes to Standard Oil an indirect liability for protection will fall on us. 4e had better by promise of protection to Sheikh now get him definitely to commit himself at once to A.P.O.C. J.G.L. 21 / 2 .Urgent. Please let rae have for the Cabinet the explanation of the following points (1) My memo. para.5 (a). ./hat are the instructions that have been agreed inter-departmentally ? (2) How if (a) the A.P.O.C. have an exclusive exploration license from the Sheikh (b) the Sheikh cannot grant an oil concession without our consent (Para.l C.O.S. Report) Is there any need for any further action on our part ? I should have thought that these two points that seem to be fundamental would have been explained in one or other of the memoranda.

Prom our point of view, for strategical and political reasons, it is important to secure the concession for a company with a substantial uegree of British control. Tne Government of India, and the haslaent agree as to the vital importance of securing the concession for toe I.P.C. They also think that the only bait likely to attract the 'heitcn is an unaertaklng of protection against aggression by lane.

SECRET. ^.P. 49 (34). Copy No, CABINET. Proposal to guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar. MEMORANDUM BY THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. I circulate for the information of my colleagues a report on the above subject, No. C.O.S. 322, prepared on my suggestion by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence. 2. The report is self-explanatory and I venture to trouble my colleagues with it only because no meeting of the Committee of Imperial Defence is likely to take place in the near future, and it is urgent to issue instructions to the Political Resident. I am in general agreement with the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff, as summarised in paragraph 13 of their report, save on two points :— (a) the terms of the guarantee to be given to the Sheikh of Qatar (paragraph 5), and (b) the caveat suggested by the Chiefs of Staff in the event of oil not being found (paragraph 11). 3. As regards the first of these points I would remark in the first place that Ibn Saud is already committed by his treaties with us to recognising the special treaty relations of His Majesty’s Government with the Sheikh of Qatar; secondly, that the protection a guarantee of which it is now proposed to give the Sheikh of Qatar will have primarily in view, not the regular forces of Ibn Saud (any attack by his regular forces would bring about an entirely different situation affecting the whole of our relations in the Gulf), but the depredations of wandering Bedouin tribes of the desert. I agree at the same time with the Chiefs of Staff that the guarantee which it was originally proposed to give (“ full protection ” against landward aggression) is too widely stated and that a more restricted guarantee would, be preferable. But the Koweit formula, to which they refer, is not entirely appropriate to a Sheikhdom such as the Sheikhdom of Qatar. My own provisional view is that it would suffice to give the Sheikh a guarantee of “ protection against unprovoked aggression by land, but I would suggest that I should be authorised, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to prepare a suitable formula on this point for use by the Resident. 4. I appreciate the importance of the second point, but if an offer of protection is to carry any weight with the Sheikh it is important that it should not be hedged round with conditions which are likely to deprive it of all its value in the Sheikh s eyes. Moreover, the Iraq Petroleum Company, if they secure the concession, may well wish to adopt a very conservative attitude towards development of oil found. Heie again I would suggest that I should be authorised to discuss the matter further with the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to see to what extent, if at all, it is desirable to accompany any undertaking we may give by a s^iecific caveat. 5. The course of action which I would submit for the consideiation of my colleagues in the circumstances described above is as follows : (a) That instructions should immediately be sent to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to initiate negotiations with the Sheikh of Qatar on lines which have already been agreed interdepartmentally; that he should fuithei be informed that His Majesty’s Government accept the principle of protection, but that the precise terms of the guarantee to be given are under examination, and that in these circumstances he should endeavour (as he has suggested) to lead the Sheikh to raise the question of protection himself, and, if and when the Sheikh does so, inform him that the issue raised is one of such importance that the instructions of His Majesty’s Government must be takenupon it. This will give os time to reach agreement here interdepartmentally on the terms and nature of our guarantee, while avoiding any delay in the initiation of general discussions between the Resident and the Sheikh. (b) That the precise terms of the guarantee to be given and the reference, if any, to be made to a caveat in the event of oil not being found should form the subject of discussion between the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and myself, with a view to instructions being sent in such terms as we may, after furthur consideration, consider suitable, the terms of any such instructions to be circulated in due course for information to the Committee of Imperial Defence.

Phis question has been under the consideration of the Chiefs of Staff Sub-Committee of the Committee of Imperial Defence, who have recommended that protection should be given of the nature already given to Koweit, subject to certain guarantees. Pheir Lordships therefore do not desire to offer any remarks on this aspect of the matter. Pheir Lordships concur with the views expressed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf in his telegrams numbered 69, 70 and 77 as to the desirability of utilising this opportunity for securing the consent of the Iraq, petroleum Company to the requirements of H.M. Government. Phey are strongly of opinion that an attempt should be made to obtain a more satisfactory refinery clause than has been agreed in connection with the Koweit concession, when, as will doubtless be the case, the question of a-British exploitation clause' is argued with the Company* Copies of this letter are being sent to the Foreign Office, War Office, and Air Ministry. - ■ 1 I am, Sir, EN8L0SURE IN WEEKLY LETTER NO. 8 22,FEB. 1934 Your obedient Servant FROM SECRETARY, POLITICAL AfID SECRET DEPT.

The conclusions of the Report as summarised in 2 para.13 are generally satisfactory. But (a) while it is desirable to limit our guarantee of protection, the form suggested by the Chiefs of Staff in para.5 will hot do.

The I.P.C. may well wish to go slow about development of any oil found. Moreover, if our undertaking is to carry any weight with the Sheikh the fewer avoidable reservations attached to it the better. The extent to which we can safely enter a caveat of this nature can be put to the Resident. (c) it would be desirable in the Cabinet to enter an oral caveat that general acceptance of the conclusions of the Chiefs of Staff does not commit us to acceptance of all the detail of their Report.

This question has been examined by them and the attached Report represents their views. You will note from the conclusion that they agree with the principle of. endeavouring to secure the Qatar oil concession, and consider that, subject to certain safeguards, the commitment can, if necessary, be fulfilled. There is, therefore, no objection to a suitably qualified assurance being given to the Sheikh. I would, however, draw your attention to paragraph 12 of the Report where the Chiefs of Staff assume that, as a matter of procedure, the proposed commitment will not be entered into without being considered by the Committee of Imperial Defence.

PERSIAN GULF Proposal to Guarantee Protection to the Sheikh of Qatar. Report. General Situation. THE peninsula of Qatar lies between the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. This peninsula is at present ruled by a Sheikh—reported to be a somewhat obstinate old man who exercises no effective rule over the hinterland between the base of the peninsula and the territory of King Ibn Saud. The Sheikh is in special relations with His Majesty’s Government which preclude him inter alia from granting an oil concession without their consent. With their approval the Anglo-Persian Oil Company have been negotiating for a concession, which they would transfer, if they obtained it, to the Iraq Petroleum Company—a Company registered in Great Britain, whose capital is held by an international group, some 30 per cent, of which is British. Difficulty has arisen over terms, and there is now strong reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, who are purely American in composition, are making overtures to the Sheikh, and will exert themselves to obtain a concession. We understand that His Majesty s Govern ment consider it most important to prevent foreign interests from establishing themselves in the Gulf Sheikhdoms. In these circumstances the question o possible inducements to the Sheikh to grant a concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company has been under consideration interdepartmentally in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India. As a result it appears that the only inducement likely to turn the scale m favour of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company is an undertaking to grant the Shei . protection against landward aggression. Question under reference. 2. We have accordingly been asked by the Prime Minister for an expression of our views as to whether' the advantage of keeping foreign oil interests out of the Qatar Peninsula justifies the assumption by His Majesty s Government of an undertaking to protect the Sheikh against landward aggression. Importance of British Interests. 3. We fully appreciate the importance of retaining the special position of His Majesty’s Government on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf, and that any concession for oil that may be granted in the Qatar Peninsula should be given into the hands of a company registered m Great Britain. We have accordingly examined the commitment involved, and consider a cer am sa e guards are required. These are as follows. [9661]Extent of Commitment. 4. We note that it is proposed to authorise the Resident in the Persian Gulf to promise the Sheikh, in exchange for the grant of the concession to a British controlled combine, the grant of full protection against aggression by land. It would appear that there is no definite line of demarcation between the territory of the Sheikh and that of Ibn Sand, and, consequently, no limit to the area for. which responsibility for protection would be undertaken. We consider, therefore that some definite boundary should be fixed before any guarantee of protection is made. Terms of Guarantee. 5. As the main object in undertaking this commitment appears to be to secure the Sheikh from aggression, or any attempt at absorption, by Ibn Sand we suggest that any guarantee that may be given should be expressed in more general terms than is at present proposed. Though the actual wording to be adopted is not our immediate concern, we would suggest that the guarantee of protection should be similar to that given in 1914 to the Sheikh of Koweit, namely, that Qatar shall be recognised as an independent principality under British protection. If this or some similar formula is adopted, it will be clear to Ibn Sand that any aggression against the Sheikh’s territory would be regarded by His Majesty’s Government as a hostile act. Guarantee only Applicable to Unprovoked Aggression. 6. We attach special importance to the guarantee being made applicable only m the event of unprovoked aggression. We consider that the Sheikh should consent to be guided by the advice of His Majesty’s Government in his attitude tovvards his neighbours, and that he should be categorically warned that the adoption of a provocative attitude or any indulgence in raiding will result in the forfeiture of protection. Local Protection. oi -J\ ^ obviously impracticable to guarantee protection, either to the feheikh s subjects or even to the oilfields, against the sporadic raiding which we U n d Ta St i and end ? m / c m thls re g ion - We consider, therefore, that the Sheikh v 6 ^ 0Im ®d hhat responsibility for law and order in his territory remains m hm hands and that he will be expected to provide the necessarv means for unng the local protection of the plant and properties of the Oil Company.

In the event of emergency, tlsquadron at bhaibah-3i hours’ flight from Doha-would be called upon to take action, according to the situation, to disperse any hostile gathering and thus render any large-scale attack by Ibn gaud’s tribal forces impossible It will be noted that, owing to the accident of water, raiding parties are tied down to certain definite lines of approach. We consider it essential that aircraft should ^be permitted to take action against those objectives most likely to give the ^ e , sll ^ s ’ a1 ^ their use should not be confined to whatever boundaries the feheikh s domain may eventually be fixed. The piesence of one of His Majesty s ships on the coast of the peninsula would have a great moral value, besides, if necessary, affording some degree of local ground protection. 1 If an emergency developed which it was beyond the power of the Navy and Royal An Foice to deal with with the forces available locally, we would suggest that the Government of India should be approached with a view to the provision of the necessary troops for the period of the emergency. We consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can be fulfilled, since with our existing forces it should be possible to deter Ibn Saud from making any formal attack and to disperse and to punish any major raids. Caveat in event of Oil not being found. 11. We are not yet aware of the approximate situation of the oilfields, nor even if oil has been located in workable quantities. We consider it desirable that some caveat should be entered to the effect that our guarantee of protection is dependent upon oil being found and the concession taken up and worked within some limited time. Reference to the Committee of Imperial Defence. 12. As a matter of procedure, we presume that the proposed commitment will not be entered into without prior consideration at the Committee of Imperial Defence, on which all Government Departments are represented. This, we under stand, would follow precedents already established in the case of the military aspects of the Iraq Treaty, the proposed Treaty with Egypt and the Status of Tangier. Conclusion. 13. Our conclusions may be summarised as follows :— (1) — (a) That the principle of endeavouring to secure the Qatar oil concession for a company registered in Great Britain is in the best interests of His Majesty’s Government (paragraph 3). {b) That as a preliminary to any guarantee of protection, the boundary of Qatar should be decided upon (paragraph 4). (c) That any guarantee given should be framed in more general terms than those at present proposed (paragraph 5). (d) That it should be made clear that the guarantee applies only to unprovoked aggression, and that the Sheikh must take reasonable steps for his own protection and for the safety of British and foreign personnel (paragraphs 6 and 7). (e) That a landing ground, with the necessary storage facilities, should be provided in Qatar, and that an adequate system of intelligence should be instituted (paragraphs 8 and 9). (2) We consider that, subject to the above safeguards, the commitment can, if necessary, be fulfilled, and that there is no objection to a suitabl} qualified assurance being given to the Sheikh (paiagraph 10).

MEMORANDUM BY SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDIA. The Sheikhdom of s^tar lies between the Sheikhdom of Bahrein and the Trucial Sheikhdoms on the Arab littoral of the Persian Gulf. The Sheikh is in special treaty relations with H.M.G. which preclude him inter alia from granting an oil concession without their consent. With their approval the A.P.O.C* have been negotiating for a concession, which they would transfer, if they obtained it, to the Iraq petroleum Company. Difficulty has arisen over terms and there is now strong reason to believe that the Standard Oil Company of California, who are, of course, purely American in composition, are making overtures to the Sheikh and will exert themselves to obtain the concession. 2. On general grounds it is considered most important to prevent American or other ^/foreign interests from establishing themselves in the Gulf Sheikhdoms. In these circumstances the question of possible inducements to the Sheikh to grant a concession to the A.P.O.C. has been under consideration/1£UjL Itl tCC SUaLjAfi. -ij'ccZXv consideration interdepartmentally, in consultation with the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Government of India. As a result, it appears that the only inducement likely definitely to turn the scale in favour of the A.P.O.C. is an undertaking to grant the Sheikh protection against landward aggression. Such an undertaking would admittedly he an importaa t commitment, hut it will not he overlooked thataldy it will in practice prohahly prove impossible to prevent the oil resources of this territory being COjI developed; whoever develops those oil resources, H*M.G. must assume a certain liability for protection, or face the risk, if the concession goes to an American or other foreign company (and it win prohahly he difficult to refuse consent indefinitely to the grant of a concession by the Sheikh to foreign nationals) of an endeavour by a foreign sfispait to make itself responsible for the protection of itsnationals in Qatar. 3. The instructions which it is proposed to send to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf on this subject are set out in the India Office letter to the Foreign Office, No,P.Z.628/34, of 1st February, attached. The views of the Foreign Office on the proposals in question are contained in their letter of 7th February circulated herewith. 4/tv-A * £rv a~^jjL l ^u. CZ^ r ^ *~''tht.

With reference to your letter No. p.z. 628/34 of the 1st February on the subject of the policy to be pursued in regard to the Sheikhdom of Qatar, I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to state that, subject to the views of the other departments concerned, and in particular to the opinion awaited from the Air Council as to the possibility of adequately fulfilling an undertaking to afford full protection against aggression by land, he concurs generally in the instructions which Secretary sir Samuel Hoare proposes to send to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. 2* I am, however, to offer the following observations on subsidiary points. 3* Sir John Simon observes that it is proposed to inform the Sheikh of Qatar that His Majesty f s Government would not be prepared to agree to the grant of a concession of any kind in respect of Qatar to a company which is not at least partly British. Since there appears to be no question of any but an oil concession at the present time.

With reference to the final sentence of paragraph 2 (b) of your letter under reply, I am to state that some controversy with the United States Government seems likely to arise as to the compatibility of the action of His Majesty’s Government in bringing pressure to bear upon the Sheikh to grant the concession to the Iraq Petroleum Company with the doctrine of the 'open door'. Sir John Simon considers however that it should be possible to base a reasonably good answer to the United States Government upon the peculiar political situation in Qatar and upon the fact that the Iraq Petroleum Company is a Company of international composition with United States participation, although he doubts whether the latter argument would in itself be accepted as valid by the United States Government. 5. Sir John Simon concurs in the opinion of Sir Samuel Hoare, as expressed in paragraph 2 (c) of your letter, that Colonel Powle should not suggest to the Sheikh that King Ibn Saud desires that the concession should be given to the Standard Oil Company of California or that the grant of a concession to that Company would be likely to result in the absorption of Qatar into King Ibn Baud’s dominions. 6.

I am answering it as it deals with operations questions and this is my province here. The only point which perturbs me is para, (d) on page 3 of the draft instructions and in particular the reference to 'the grant to the Sheikh of Qatar of full protection against aggressi by land'. In this connection I note you have only addressed the Admiralty and Air Ministry officially on this point and I am inclined to think it would be advisable for the subject to be examined by the Chiefs of Staff Sub-committee. yours J.E. Laithwaite, Esquire, India office.~^7cA^C&gt;-&lt;^ iy^ ^atar ^* , ,|iiii^iLii2.iS£, £ l 'talkod at length and rather confusedly about the Uatar concession. The gist of his remarks was that he did not know how far the .jiglo Persian Oil Company had so far proceeded; that he himself thought that he mi he a very useful agent in securing any concession for them, but that there had been no indication of interest on their part in such a possibility; that so far as he could judge they would have the utmost difficulty in securing any concession, and that he thought their chances were at the moment exceedingly poor. The Standard Oil had made up their minds to get this concession at any price. Any financial offer put up by the Anglo Persian Oil Company would at once be capped by the Ameiican interests. (I understood him to say that royalty figures of Bs.7 or 8, and a lump sum down of a million rupees had been mentioned or hinted at to the Sheikh on behalf of the Standard Oil) . The Sheikh, when he discussed oil with Major Holmes at an earlier stage, had said that ‘he would give the concession to whomever the British Government advised him to give it - in other words the Iraq Petroleum Company. Subsequently his attitude had quite changed, largely as the result of the activities on behalf of the Standard Oil of Mr. Skinner, the present Chiei Local Representative of the Bahrein Petroleum Company in Bahrein, whose instructions were to leave no stone unturned to secure the concession for the Standard Oil, and who had not only one or two local agents in Qatar, but who, by judicious entertainment of members of the ruling family in Qatar, including certain of the Sheikh’s sons, had established himself with them. 6. The Sheikh of Qatar was an extremely obstilicit© and difficult old man said the son most likely to succeed him nad rather similar qualities, lie was well-off, ou b had to pay substantial sums (estimated at £10,00u a year) to Ion Baud. Having/ -7« Having intermitted payment of this rent to Ibn Saud for two yearsj he had been sent for by His Majesty to Riyadh last suiomer and* Major Holmes gathered, had been warned to be careful in disposing of his oil concession. 7. The Sheikh stood in great fear of Ibn Saud and would certainly be much swayed by an instructions or requests he received from him. Ibn Saud on his part kept the Sheikh in his place. As we were no doubt aware the Sheikh of Qatar's southern boundary was rather uncertain, and Ibn Saud had given him clearly to understand that there must be no activities on behalf of Qatar such as investigations by the Anglo Persian Oil Company geologists south of a line v/hich Major Holmes indicated on the map and which appears to be approximately that marked as the south boundary of Qatar on the Iraq Petroleum Company map of which copies have been circulated. He added that the eastern boundary of the Hasa concession ran south from a point approximately at the head of Donat as Halwa to the 23rd or 24th parallels, when it turned at right angles to the East for some distance. (Any such boundary would of comse be inconsistent with the line indicated to Ion Saud oy Sir P. Cox in 1922). f 77° J. Q.

Tiie telegram on that paper consulting the Government of India and Colonel Fowle on the general question of policy in regard to Qatar raised by the proposed grant of an oil concession crossed the Resident’s telegram of 11th January, T.19, the views in which w ere reaffirmed by the Resident in his telegram of 17th January, T.34.

We are now in a position to take a decision as to the instructions to be given to the Resident. Informal discussion with the other interested departments (Admiralty, Air ministry, Foreign Office) snows that, departmentally at any rate, there is substantial agreement on the following points; (a) no effort to be spared to secure tne concession for the A.P.O.C.; (b) in return for this, a guarantee of protection to be given to the Sheikh against aggression by land (the Air ministry do not think that the commitment involved is likely to be very serious); (c) the Resident to take the matter up immediately personally with the Sheih; (d) the questions of jurisdiction, the appointment of a Political Agent, etc., to be left over for the moment until the main issue of the grant of the concession is settled.

The adsorption of Qatar would mean a Preach of the Treaty of Jedda and Ibn Saud is most unlikely to face so large an issue as this would involve. The grant dy him of protection to the east of the blue line is perhaps less easy. But if in the first place we can get the concession for the A.P.O.C. and if we are prepared to grant protection to the operations of the concessionnaires ourselves the point will be of less importance. (f) we nave no evidence whatever that Ibn Saud is behind the Standard Oil of California or that any positive campaign is being conducted by him or them | in connection with Hie Qatar concession. Various rumours or c onjectures have been reported by the Resident or by the P.A., Koweit on this subject in the past few months, but there is nothing so clear as to justify the drawing of conclusions and there is a complete absence of any information from confidential sources which would support the suggestion. The Resident has been further consulted on the matter in our telegram of 27th January. 3.

I am now to enclose a memorandum giving an appreciation of • the various aspects of the problem, sir Samuel Hoare agrees with tne conclusions reached in this memorandum, and, for the reasons more fully explained therein, would propose, subject to the concurrence of the interested Departments, that the instructions to Col.

The 8/S, who is fully alive to the necessity for careful handling of this question with a view to avoiding diplomatic difficulties with the U.3.A, agrees with the Resident that an intimation of this nature could not he represented as a shutting of the 'open aoor' in Qatar, since, as Gol.

It seems clear in the first place that tne political aiiiiculties which might arise from the grant of a concession in respect of Qatar to any company which is not at least pai tly British, ana iron which the requisite safeguards for British political interests cannot De obtained, are likely to he extremely serious. It is now accepted tnat the maintenance of the special British position on the Arab littoral of the Gulf is of cardinal importance, a fact which has been further stressed in recent months by the rapid developments of air communication - likely to develop still more rapidly in the future- and by the possibility that may be unable to retain their naval station at Henjam. The Sheikhdom of Qatar is of particular importance because of its geographical position on the southern littoral of the Persian Gulf. The establishment of a non-British oil company in Qatar, particularly if identical or closely associated with the American company to which Ibn Baud has granted tne Hasa concession, must inevitably sooner or later react unfavourably on the position of H.L.G. in the vitally important Sheikhdom of Bahrein. It will equally inevitably prejudice in an increasing degree as the time goes on tne position of H.L.G. in/semi- barbarous areas of the True ini Coast. H.L.G. have in the past, as a deliberate policy, abstained from interference or the exercise of influence in the internal affairs and in Hie •Vitn the rapid hinterland of those areas2 . development of air coiununication, and the possihility of pressure hy oil interests to ootain concessions, that policy may before very long require reconsideration; and it is essential that in aealing with Qatar nothing shoulu be uone which might place H.m.G. in a weaker position to secure their desiuerata in that event. It is unnecessary to develop the local political difficulties likely to arise in the case of Qatar itself should any concession be locally exploited save by British personnel, or be under non-British control. In these circumstances the course suggested in para.5 of the Political KesidenVs telegram T.19 seems tlie right one to adopt. The wording to be used by Col. Powle in his discussion with the sheikh might be that ,, Hhv,.G., having regard to their special treaty relations with the sheikh, would not be prepared to agree to the grant of a concession by him of any kind in respect of Qatar to a company wnich was not at least partly British'. 2. Ibn Sauu ana the Qatar concession . This raises an important question of policy. The Resident and tne G.of I. have drawn attention to the possibility that Ibn Saud may endeavour to support the efforts of the Standard Oil Coy. to secure the Qatar concession with a view to himself 'absorbing' Qatar; ana to the risks involved in any attempt by Ibn Saud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland to any oil concessionnaire in Qatar. from—3. fctrbo&amp;rf GxHl j tiG-^UP-© ctfiy—±0 6ul— 1111 ylr| '^ l, 1 1' i Y Y.i'llic h ni i r- »'C—i«6 in the tologrorn ot in^fart t^kin-e-'any acticm-^etivo em^~at the 'InoScTrt. 3e that as it iLay, Itn 3auci, hy Art. 6 of the Treaty of Jedda of 1927, has undertaken to respect trie special treaty relations of H.M.G. with the Sheikh of ^atar. Any attempt on his part to 'adsorb' the Qatar Sheikhdom would he wholly inconsistent with the provisions of the Treaty in question, and prima facie it would seem very doubtful whether' Ton Baud would, unless some quiteji^radical change takes plu.ce in the general situation, be disposed to face tne very serious consequences of tne breach with H.k.G. which a flagrant disregard of his treaty obligations would involve. In these circumstances it does not seem necessary to regard very seriously the probability of a formal attempt at absorption. 3. The possibility of an attempt by Ibn Saud to grant ^protection' to an oil concessionnaire - in the hinterland of Qatar is to some extent connected with the difficult question of what eastern limits H.M.G. recognise to Ibn Baud’s authority. The question of the boundaries of Qatar is being dealt with in a separate Note. But it appears probable that the Sheikh recognises/4. / recognises as Ms western and southern 1 boundary line a line running south-south east across the base of the Qatar j peninsula from a point about 12 miles north of Do hat - as- Sal wet to a point some 10 or 12 miles north of the Khor-al-Oaeia. Ion Saud’s eastern boundary has not formal^ oeen Clt: ii n ed in any Treaty engagement with H.M.G. But tne eastern boundary of the Turkish 3anjaq of Nejd as constituted by tne Blue Line of the unratified Anglo- Turkish Convention of 1913 lies well to the west of tne boundary of ^tar suggested by the Sheikh. Malle it is common knowledge that Ibn Baud exercises a strong and even preponderant influence of an unofficial character to the east of the Blue Line, possibly so far to the east as the Bareimi Oasis, it is suggested that any effort on part of to exert or extend an oldieial influence or formally to grant protection east of that line to oil companies or others, should be strongly resisted, ana that if the question a rises Ibn Baud should be informed that H.M.G. regard the Blue Line as his eastern boundary, even if this involves consideration of a claim on the part of H.M.G. that the western boundary of &lt;^atar is so far to the west as the Blue Line. If the adoption of this attitude is approved it should afford a firm basis on which to deal with any effort on the part of Ibn Baud to grant 'protection' in the hinterland of Qatar/ j £rr &gt; . Jp*ant of mtectipn to glheikh gainst ~ession by uU ^ m l x^ Win}, -'-‘°^- a«‘f'F¥'^ Qatar and East of the Blue Line to any oil concessionnaires. 4. The question will, however, he of less importance if H.M.Gr. are prepared to accept responsib ili ty for the defence of Qatar against landward aggression. j It is for the Air Ministry to say whether they would anticipate any difficulty in granting the necessary protection were H.M.G-. to approve its grant m principle^ “snd^to~giveBadso such estimate as may be possible of the probable financial burden of granting such protection. Such information as is available about the area lying in the hinterland of Qatar suggests that it populated by migratory Bedouin tribes who pay an informal and vague allegiance to Ibn Saud, but who, for the most part, are for practical purposes independent, /ere the Sheikhdom of Qatar a rich ano fertile area, with good grazing grounds, there might perhaps be a greater risk of frequent raiding from the desert area. But so far as we are aware, this is not the case and the principle inducement to raiders would be such plunder as could be secured from the raiding of settlements established in connection with oil operations, or such blackmail as could be levied on the oil concession aire or the Sheikh as the price of non-interference. As will be seen, neither the Political Resident nor the Government of India, who have long experience of this quarter, appear to regard the grant of protection in present circumstances as involving very serious commitments. The Air Council, whose officers have first-hand personal experience of the Qatar Peninsula, may be able to throw further light on this point. Subject, however, to any view which/which my b© ©xpresssd by t ein t t»her8 sserfis a, strong case ior the acceptance of liability for protection (since whoever obtained an oil concession in s,atar an indirect liability will fall on and for using to the utmost the very substantial reassurance which this should represent to the Sheikh uo persuade him to grant an oil concession to the A.P.C.C. The grant of protection would not absolve the Sheikh from taking his own measures so far as possible to defend his principality, but it would cover any unprovoked aggression across his southern boundary. If that southern boundary is, at any rate as a temporary measure, fixed at the point which the Sheikh himself at present apparently contemplates, such protection will be necessary against the nomad tribes of the desert. If, for any reason (and it might well be necessary to consider this) it proved necessary to claim that Qatar influence or Qatar territory extended so far to the west as the blue line, there would still be a danger of incursions from the desert area to the south; the population of nomad Bedouin using a Sheikhdom with such boundaries would be substantially increased, and to that extent the undertaking of a larger commitment would be involved. On the other hand it would be possible, if the boundaries of Qatar and Nejd marched, equally to require the Saudi Government, so long at any rate as that Government remains in effective control of Hasa and Nejd, to control any raids by tribes permanently settled in their territory across the boundary of Saudi Arabia.*AIR MAIL. private and personal New Delhi, 16th Jany.1934. Many thanks for your P. &amp; P. letter of the 4th Jany. I have noted what you say about Worth and his wishes will be kept on record and if possible given effect to when he returns from leave. I personally should be very pleased to see a young civilian oosted to the Gulf, and I believe he is a very competent lad. I have been trying to master the rather vol uminous correspondence which has recently been sent to us about oil concessions in the Gulf. Much the most important from our point of view seems to be the ^atar concession and how to deal with the Sheikh. Prior who is at present working as Deputy Secretary on the Political Side has, as you know, a very intimate and personal knowledge both of the Sheikh and of general Gulf problems connected with that region. I have therefore called him into consultation and he assures me that the possibility of the Standard Oil Company securing a concession in Qatar under the aegis of Ibn Saud would react most unfavourably on our whole posi tion in the Gulf. He also stresses very strongly the inevitability of our giving the Sheikh the auM pro offo^lfSt attack from the landward side, if we are to get anything out of him. I had drafted a tele gramtelegram to you on these lines which I Intended to Issue at once, but I have just received a personal telegram from Fowle saying that he will send his comments very shortly; so I am hanging the matter up for a day or two which will also enable me to take His Excellency’s orders after his return to Delhi at the end of this week. You may however take It that any telegram which eventually Issues from here represents not only my views on -feteg subject, with which I have no local acquaintance, but also Prior's views,, which are, I think, entitled to considerable weight. Fowle's telegram No.T/19 of 14th Jany. seems to indicate that his views will correspond very closely to those held here. To me it seems that our main difficulty lies in the contradiction between (1) H.M.G. f s desire to secure oil concessions for British or partly British Companies which they can control and (2) their desire to avoid any appearance of discrimination against American Oil Enterprise. They cannot however have it both ways and the political considerations involved in the Qatar oil conces- too sion appear too important to permit of our being/squeamish about American feeling. Prior tells me that in his opinion the commercial interests of India both in Qatar and in the other ports on the Southern Side of the Persian Gulf are extremely important, but I have refrained from emphasising this in the draft reply, since were I to do soH.M.G. might well try to put on to the Indian Govt, part of the financial or mily. responsibility for the protection,which we propose should be offered to the Sheikh of ^atar, although the naval and air forces which H.M.G. at present maintain in the Persian Gulf should probably be quite sufficient to deal with any situation in that region. I can imagine that with these pro tracted and very complicated conferences you must be having a very heavy time. Please thank Walton for his P. &amp; P. letter to me of the 5th Jany. and tell him that I will send him a reply next week. / J. G.

Having regard to all the circumstances, I am of opinion that next step should be for me to pay visit to Sheikh, which would be in nature of preliminary reconnaissance, 2, I suggest that in course of frank and friendly conversations with Sheikh, I should point out to him, (a), our natural desire that the concession should go to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, (b),. that present terms offered by latter are generous, (o), that it is no secret that Ibn Saud is behind the Californian Oil Company and that result of latter obtaining the concession will be absorption of his territory by Ibn Saud and his disappearance as an independent ruler, 3o If Sheikh {? attaches) value to our protection he will presumably ask for it or throw out feelers and his attitude on this important point will be cleared up. 4. Should Sheikh ask for our protection, in order to enhance its value, I vail assume suitable hesitation and reply that the matter must be referred to His Majesty^s Government. 5. Before, however, I approach the Sheikh, I venture to suggest that His Majesty's Government should for the moment put all other considerations aside and (1) decide whether, if Sheikh gives Anglo-Persian0 - 2 ~ Anglo-Psraian Oil Company concession, we can promise him full protection; (2) endeavour to extract from the Anglo-Persian Oil company-Iraq Petroleum Company, the agreement, suggested in my telegrams e9 and ?0.

The telegramsfon wnich the Secretary of State has noted deal with the endeavours of tne a.P.O.G. to secure an oil concession from the Sheikh of Qatar* The sheikh is precluded from giving a concession without the consent of H.M.G. and with their approval he has given the A.P.O.G, an exclusive exploration licence expiring next August. Negotiations with the Sheikh are very far advanced, Put great difficulty is being experienced over finance and the Sheikh has hinted that unless the A.P.O.G. meet his demands (which are on the large side) in full he may have to turn to the Standard Oil of California, who are operating a concession in the adjoining Saudi province of Hasa, and who, he suggests, are willing to give him the financial terms he wants. 2. Our policy here is to leave nothing undone to get the Qatar concession for the A.P.O.G. and we are in close touch with the Company as to the terms of tins concession and the safeguards to be secured in connection with it from the Sheikh on behalf of H.M.G. 3. One of the most important, from the point of view both of the Company and of H.IVi.G., is securing a surrender of jurisdiction over foreigners by the oheikh in the event of a concession being granted. The development of oil in this small ana uncivilised Sheikhdom will also necessitate consideration of various other points, such as the appointment of a Political Agent, etc.- 2 - 4. The questions which are now for consideration (apart fi om the actual terms of any agreement 'between the Sheikh anu the A.P.G.C.) are what steps, if any, can he taken to prevent the Sheikh from sealing with the Standard Oil, anc what inducements can oe held out to him to secure the Qatar concession for the A.P#O.C. and the connected desiderata of H.M.G. about Jurisdiction etc. ^Resident has suggested that we should remind the Sheikh that he is precluded from giving ^concessions without our consent to any company anUftnaftnat consent will only be given if the concessionaires are at least partly British; that on the other hand, if he grants the concession to the A.P.G.C., he will be given full protection against/Aggress ion 4n his territories. the 6. The Government of India see/international difficulty of taking too definite a line against the standard Oil; agree with the Resident that the bait of protection might be held out; and suggest^ action on the lines of paraaisrHKg^ 4 of their telegram of 20th January. If this fails, the question would have to be considered furtherjand they hint at the possibility of a threat of deposition if the Sheikh refuses to accept our advice. Action on these lines would, however, raise a difficult problem and it is premature to consider it at present. ' If is perhaps fair to add that there is no definite evidence that Ibn Saua is in fact behind the Standard Oil interest in Qatar. So far as tne absorption of Qatar by ibn Saua is concerned, he has, in the Treaty of Jedda, recognised our treaty relations with the Sheikh of atar, and any endeavour on his part to absorb or extend his influence into the Sheikhdom would raise most serious issues/ ■&gt; ... %issues 'between us and him which he is unlikely to wish to face, at any rate at this stage. h+*n-c ||| * / -*l * i Vi ^PJfe/UL 1 rf/''*' (39 groups) *'j s pp&gt;J sr * il^4-Y P H £ R From FILE COPY i i 'iih z.

A preliminary and informal discussion took place at the Foreign Office on the 15th December (see paragraphs 1 to 5 of the record on P.Z.8204/33, copies of which have gone to the Government of India and to Bushire) • Since then the position has been further complicated by the receipt of information suggesting that overtures have been made to the Sheikh by the Standard Oil Company of California and that unless the A.P.O.C. accept his financial terms (which at the moment they are most reluctant to do) the Sheikh may wish to open negotiations with the Standard Oil on the expiry next August of the exploration licence which the A.P.O.C. have secured from him. Our approval is necessary to the grant by the sheikh of any oil concession, and it would equally be necessary before he could enter into negotiations with the Standara Oil. But,(the question of the Sheikh*s own financial interests, which must carry some weight with us,apart, fasasa considerations of Anglo-American relations It would probably fee extremely difficult for us to refuse to allow him to negotiate with the Standard Oil if his negotiations with the A.P.O.C. broke down. 2. The minute which follows discusses in some detail the main questions outstanding between us and the sheikh, the necessity for taking them up with him at this juncture, and the procedure to be followed if, after consultation with the Political Resident and the Government of India it is decided that they should be taken up.AT IT STANDING tiTTHlSTTONS BjaTV^N H. - W PATArt . '-'ITT orl. The instrument governing our relations witl the Sheikhdom of Qatar is the Treaty of 3rd November 1916 flagged below. As will be seen, the Sheikh is precluded by Article V of the Treaty from granting any concessions, save with our consent, and by Article IV from ceding land to any other power or Its subjects either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way whatsoever, without our approval. When the Treaty was signed it was agreed that three of its Articles should not come into force 'until son}e future time when the need for them shall be manifest and the effect will not be given to these Articles without full consultation with you and the obtaining of your consent'. (Appendix A to Treaty). The Articles in question provide that the Sheikh undertakes to (i) '’Allow British subjects to reside in Qatar tor trade and to protect their lives and property' (Article VII). (ii) 'Receive, should the British Government deem it advisable, an agent from the British Government who shall remain at Al-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me and to watch over the interests of British traders residing at my ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions'' (Article VIII).

(v) vVe have been anxious to secure the grant d^/ him of regular air facilities to the hut so far have secured no more than an informal arrangement. 4. The position is as follows:- (i) Article VII of Treaty . It might he argued that the grant hy the sheikh of an oil concession to the A.P.O.C. automatically brought this article Into * force. But, particularly in view of the undertakings it contains as regards protection, it seems desirable, quite apart from the fact that we are committed hy Appendix A to the Treaty of 1916 to the bringing of the aormant articles into force only after consultation with the sheikh and the obtaining of his consent, to reach a formal agreement with him giving effect to it. (ii) Article VIII of Trea ty. It mil probably be of considerable importance that we should appoint a Political Officer in Qatar without delay in the event of an oil concession going through. The matter would perhaps be of less importance, at any rate in the earlier stages, if the A.P.O.C. were to secure the concession, and if an understanding could be reached with them that any concession secured diould be4. exploited solely Py British personnel. Even in thosfe circumstances, however, there would Pe much advantage in having on the spot a representative of H.M.G*, who could not only exercise the jurisdiction over foreigners which we wish the Sheikh to cede (see (iv) Pelow), Put who, from his experience of the Gulf and his knowledge of the general policy of could assist in the maintenance of good relations between the Company and its employees and the sheikh, as welfl as watching over our general political Interests in Qatar. In addition, it will proPaPly Pe desirable, whoever gets the concession, here, as in Bahrein, that, if aid when a concession is granted and a Political Agent established, the dealings of the concessionaires with the Sheikh should Pe conducted by their Chief Local Representative through the Political Agent. The arguments, strong in any circumstances, for having a resident British Political Oifj.cer to discharge the functions described above, would be very greatly strengthened if the A.P.O*C., as is by no means improbable, fail to get the concession and we have to deal with the Standard Oil Company of California. This would be particularly tne case IT it proved impossible to secure from the standard oil our desideratum of local exploitation by British personnel. (iv) Jurisdiction. This is the most difficult question facing us. We have no agreement with the blr ikh about it and fresh ground must therefore be ken. °o far as can be judged we may anticipate difficulty in reaching an understanding (the Sheikb has already asked the A.P.G.C. in the course ne ^ 0 ^^ a ^ : Lons to agree to his exercising jurisdiction in cases of dispute between their employ ee3 Md MtlV8s of ^ ^ they/ P:% Minute Paper Department. tney are not prepared to agree.' in Koweit the sheikh has reluctantly ceded jurisdiction over nonrlvloslem i-oreigners; in Bahrein he has ceded jurisdiction over a-11 foreigners. In hoth states the position is regulated hy Order-in-Council, the general exercise of jurisdiction being vested in the Political iigent. Vi/e ought to aim at a corresponding cession in Qatar (there, as in Bahrein and Koweit, special arrangements can he made to meet the local circumstances In respect of mixed cases). Colonel Powle, in his D.O. Letter No.1869-3 of 4th December, flagged, suggested a compromise arrangement in respect of jurisdiction. That arrangement might well meet the case, at any rate temporarily, could we he sure that we should he dealing with a wholly British company and that the exploitation of any oil concession granted would he solely In British hands* But the I.P.C. is international in character, and while we hope to secure an underst&amp;i from the A.P.O.C. if they get the concession as regards British exploitation, we cannot at this stage he quite sure that we shall succeed. Secondly, if, as is quite . 1 y possible, the A#P#O.C. and the I.P*C. fail to get the concession, we shall at once have to face the issue of the introduction of U.S. personnel. On general political grounds the Foreign Office, with &amp;&gt;me , &gt; reason, are most anxious that we should do nothing which might have the appearance of discriminating against a U.S. company or making it more difficu them to secure a concession in open competition. these circumstances they think it aesirahle that 2119 5000 8.336 . should have made it clear to the Sheikh well in advance of any active entry oj- American interests into competition that an understanding on the matter of jurisdiction must be an essential condition of our approval of the grant by him of an oil concession to any company of v/hatever nationality. The difficultie which might arise in the absence of any understanding as to jurisdiction are patent and need not be developed in detail. (v) Air facilities . This question is of less importance and less urgency. Vis-a-vis any oil concessionaires we are provisionally propose to require, as a term of our approval to the concession, an undertaking that there shall be no Interference with air arrangements, landing grounds, etc., in Qatar. At a pinch we need not raise the question now with the Sheikh. On the other hand, we shall, in the first place, if the suggestions which follow I are accepted, be broaching so many major issues with him that no great harm would perhaps be done by adding air facilities to the list. Secondly, whatever guarantees we may get from any concessionaires, we shall be in a much better position if, before the concession comes into operation, we have actually secured the landing grounds we want from the Sheikh and are in possession of them. la IT ESSENTIAL TO broach 'IHE ABOVE W.UESTTON^ It should be emphasised, in the first place that tne suggestions in this minute are tentative in character and are subject to\the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident in Hie Peisian uulf, though Doth the Foreign Office and the Department are inclined to think that it would beMinute Paper. Department. well in consulting those authorities to make fairly clear, with a view to putting them in the picture, our present provisional attitude in the matter. buoject to Colonel i’owle's views and those of the Government of India, the Department (with whom uhe roieign Office is understood to agree) would on the whole ■udotjop in tho afirirm^tii&gt;^/r~sa?ve possibly as regards (v) (air facilities) in the preceding section. Real difficulty may he anticipated with the Sheikh in securing our desiderata and the methods of bringing pressure to hear upon him (see below) are relatively limited. On the other hand, once oil starts to be developed in Qatar, we shall be strongly urged not to interfere with the prospects of development by making political demands on the Sheikh. There will be the risk that the Sheikh will endeavour to play off the | concessionaires against H.M.G. (especially if the concession ultimately goes to the Standard Oil of California). Certain of our desiderata, such as the appointment of a Political Agent, may well be undesirable from the point of view of a concessionaire as well as from that of the Sheikh (since in his absence the operating company would have a much freer hand). There/'seems a strong case for safeguarding ourselves before matters go too far. The difficulties, great as they may be issw, in consolidating our position in Qatar#' would be very much greater later. 2119 5000 8.33 The Sheikh Is likely to be very difficult to deal/8 . deal with. In his conversations with the A.P.O.G. he has already shown quite clearly that he is suspicious of H.M.G* and apprehensive of a larger degree of interference oy them end hy the Political Resident. us He will prohahle ask/for a quid pro quo. The possibilities are (a) a subsidy or other assistance in kind; (b) a guarantee of protection against external aggression by land as well as by sea. There are objections to meeting him era either. The grant of a subsidy would be a very awkward precedent in the Persian Gulf, all the Sheikhdoms of which suffer from time to time from financial crises of greater or less degrees of acuteness. We have in the past consistently refused to give the rulers of the Arab hinterland any formal guarantee of protection against external aggression by land (though we have accepted a certain liability for such protection in the Case of Koweit). The objections to doing so are obvious - an ill-defined hinterland; the extreme difficulty of conducting operations against marauding tribes from over the adjoining border; the difficulty of lixing responsibility for aggression on the right anoulcers; the very considerable expenditure which might De Solved in operations on any scale; and the difficulty of exercising any effective control in an area which we do not administer and in which we have no political representative to keep us in touch with developments or keep the ruler on the right tract. These objections have been conclusive in the past in th6 CaS6 ° f Qatar &lt; as ^hey would be at the moment in tne case of the Trucial Coast), on the other hand. now tnat we shall be inevitably accepting a certain lability m respect of the whole area of Q^tar by agreeing/ (in# *-0Paper. 9. Department. agreeing to the grant of an oil concession by the Sheikh, it may well be that our attitude towards a guarantee of protection might be reconsidered. Bdt the question is a large one and I suggest that we should not oroach it until we have got the reactions of the Political Resident and the Government of India on the general question of policy discussed above. If they think it desirable to press on with negotiations with the Sheikh to secure the desiderata ; which have already been referred to, the Resident will certainly want some indication as to the extent to * which he can promise any quid pro quo, and the question of guarantees can best be'ponsidered then. 7. MRIHQDS OF PRESSURE ON IHh SHEIKH . If the Sheikh refuses to meet usjif we are not prepared to give him any quid pro quo of the nature discussed in the preceding paragraph,(or if such quid pro quo as we may offer is insufficient), our methods of bringing pressure to bear upon him are mainly two; (a) refusal to allow him to grant an oil concession. This would affect him adversely financially and now that he realises that a concession has a very substantial financial value an intimation of this nature might have some effect upon him. But we should have to walk very carefully, for we shall ourselves he exposed to considerable political pressure, whether the A.P.O.C. or the Standard Oil of California, are concerned, if we interfere heyond a pQint with their prospects of reaching an understanding with the Sheikh. (h)/ 1!c 1 i I i ! f 10. (Id) Hie despatcii ol one or two sloops from tiie Persian Gulf Squadron to stand off the Sheikh’s capital of Dohah. General experience in the Persian Gulf (and our experience with Ihn Saud has been the same) goes to show that the local Sheikhs will obstinately refuse to make concessions (save possibly In return for quite disproportionate concessions on our side) so long as they think that we will not press matters beyond a point. If they are satisfied finally that we intend to secure what we want, irrespective of their wishes,they usually give way sulkily. If the view suggested above that the 3 above desiderata mentioned in paragraph/are really important is accepted, I see no reason why we should be too squeamish in applyingfpressure to the Sheikh of Qatar. 8 - URGENCY . In principle it is very undesirable to rush negotiations with rulers like the Persian Gulf Sheikhs The sheikh of Qatar himself complained of our doing so when we applied lor air facilities a couple of years ago, ana the present Resident has consistently impressed upon us that if we want good results we must feive time, in tne present case our hands have to some extent teen j.orced. The A.P.O.C. are already busily negotiating, and the Standard Oil have started to show s’gns of interest, me sooner in these circumstances we can agree a policy, in consultation with India and the Political Resident, and authorise the Resident to start negotiations^^the shejich, the better.^ A r\ reduce tde further advantage will**buUr justification for any-complaints by U.s. interests that we are discriminating against them. 9/ Palie an Minute Paper.

La^XXXj^ far*** G }s¥t*JL 2* ‘fhe points raised by the Shaikh for definition fj£(Z are awkv;ard. ones, or at least the second one is. The first - removal by the Company of any emplojree objection able to the Shaikh is comparatively simple. If the employee in question is a Qatar subject, the Shaikh can of course do -what he likes with him, and if a foreigner, i.e. a non-Qa+ari, the Company will presumably arrange for his transfer elsewhere, or for his dismissal. 3. The second point, however, that any dispute between a foreign employee of the Company and one of the Shaikh’s subjects should be referred to the Shaikh for settlement, i s more difficult. As far as jurisdiction of the Shaikh over foreign subjects is concerned, the Shaikh is in the same position as his colleagues of the Trucial Coast. For that area no Order in Council of course exists, (as for Muscat, Bahrain and Kuwait), giving extra territorial rights to British and foreign subjects, and arranging for these to come under the jurisdiction of the Political Agent. There is no machinery, for instance, for settling the claims for debt of British Indian subjects against/ J*G.Laithwaite Esquire, The India Office, LONDON.against the local inhabitants, and all the Political Resident can do, when approached on the subject by the creditors, is to try to arrange some sort of compromise through the Pesidency Agent, andjbring pressure to bear on the Shaikh - if it is practicable to bring that pressure* Similarly, there is no machinery for settling criminal matters, and, theoretically, British subjects in Qatar and the Trucial Coast presumably come entirely under the jurisdiction of the local Shaikh, and could, for instance, be imprisoned by him* In practice, however, as far as I know, no such case has ever arisen* The Shaikhs have never claimed judicial authority over British subjects in their territories, and we have always assumed that they cannot do so* 4* The Shaikh of Qatar will, I think, lay special stress on this second point, as doubtless he is afraid with the coming of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company, (which is regarded on the Arab Coast as a semi-official concern), that his authority will be encroached upon, and that Qatar will become a sort of quasi-British possession. Even if he does not fear this, but wants to give the Concession to a rival concern, he will make play with this objection in order to create difficulties* I talked the matter over with Loch and we agreed that if the Shaikh persisted in raising this point, an answer on the following lines mi^it be given him. In case of such disputes, as are con templat ed, the matter might be referred to the Shaikh, who, in consultation with the local representative of the Company, would endeavour to settle it in an informal manner. If, however,/-3- however, this procedure failed to compose the dispute, and the matter was a serious one, it could he referred to a *-oint Court (such as exists in Bahrain) composed of the Shaikh and the Political Agent, Bahrain. 5. Should this solution appear to the India Office to meet the case, you might let me have a brief telegram to this effect, and I will talk it over with Elkington, whom I am hoping to see soon. You could also discuss it perhaps with the Anglo-Persi an Oil Company’s representatives in London* 6. By the way, it had been rumoured that the had Shaikh of Q^atar/some time recently paid as tribute to Ibn Saud the large sum of £ 10,000/-. The truth of the matter appears to be that some years ago the Shaikh was foolish enough to lend Hie Majesty a large sum, whether as much as £ 10,000/- or not I do not know, and one of the objects of the Shaikh’s visit was to try and extract the repayment of the loan. In this, as might be expected, he was unsuccessful: apparently all that he got out of Ibn Saud being a hospitable reception, soft words and a gift of some secondhand cars. In fact Ibn Saud’s usual treatment of importunate creditors. (You will remember that the Shaikh of Kuwait some years ago in a weak moment also lent Ibn Saud money for one of his military expeditions, for which I believe he is still waiting). I am sending a copy of this letter to Metcalfe.PZ. /33. 6 c Text of Treaty, dated November 3, 1916, and ratified on March 23, 1918, with » Sheikh Abdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani of al-Katar. \ Whereas my grandfather, the late Sheikh Mohammed-bin-Thani signed an agreement on the 12th September, 1868, engaging not to commit any breach of the maritime peace, and whereas these obligations to the British Government have devolved on me his successor in Qatar; I. I’ ^bdullah-bin-Jasim-bin-Thani, undertake that I will, as do the friend]v Arab Shaikhs of Abu Dhabi, Dibai, Shargah, Ajman, Ras-ul-Khaima, and Uinm-ai- Qawam, co-operate with the High British Government in the suppression of the slave trade and piracy, and generally in the maintenance of the maritime peace. To this end, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Percy Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, has favoured me with the treaties and engagements entered into between the Sheikhs above mentioned and the High British Government, and I hereby declare that I v ill abide by the spirit and obligations of the aforesaid treaties and engagements. It. On the other hand, the British Government undertakes that I and my subjects and my and their vassals shall receive all the immunities, privileges, and advantages that are conferred on the friendly Sheikhs, their subjects and their vassals. In token whereof, Sir Percy Cox has affixed his signature with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements in the copy granted to me, and I have also affixed my signature and seal with the date thereof to each and every one of the aforesaid treaties and engagements, in two oilier printed copies of the same treaties and engagements, that it may not be hidden. III. And in particular, I, Sheikh Abdullah, have further published a proclamation^ forbidding the import and sale of arms into my territories and port of Qatar; and in consideration of the undertaking into which I now enter, the British Government on its part agrees to grant me facilities to purchase and import, from the Maskat Arms Warehouse, or such other place as the British Government may approve, for my personal use, and for the arming of my dependents, such arms and ammunition as L may reasonably need and apply for in such fashion as may be arranged hereafter through the Political Agent, Bahrein. I undertake absolutely that arms and ammunition thus supplied to me shall under no circumstances be re-exported from my territories or sold to the public, but shall be reserved solely for supplying the needs of my tribesmen and dependents, whom I have to arm for the maintenance of order in my territories and the protection of my frontiers. In my opinion, the amount of my early requirements will be up to five hundred weapons. IV. I, Shaikh Abdullah, further undertake that I will not have relations nor correspond with, nor receive the agent of, any other Power without the consent of the High British Government; neither will I, without such consent, cede, to any other Power or its subjects, land, either on lease, sale, transfer, gift, or in any other way whatsoever. V. I also declare that, without the consent of the High British Government, I will not grant pearl-fishery concessions, or any other monopolies, concessions, or cable landing rights to anyone whomsoever. VI. The customs dues on the goods of British merchants imported to Qatar shall not exceed those levied from my own subjects on their goods, aud shall in no case exceed f&gt; per cent, ad valorem. British goods shall be liable to the payment of no other dues or taxes of any other kind whatsoever, beyond that already specified. 2383 2 12.332 f 1 VII. I Shaikh Abdullah, further, in particular, undertake to allow British subjects to reside in Qatar for trade and to protect their lives and property. VIII I also undertake to receive, should the ^British Government deem it advisable, ap airent from the British Government, who shall remain, at Al-Bidaa for the transaction of such business as the British Government may have with me, and to watch over the interests of British traders, residing at my ports or visiting them upon their lawful occasions. , IX. Further 1 undertake to allow the establishment of a British post office and a telegraph installation anywhere in my territory whenever the British Government should hereafter desire them. I also undertake to protect them when established. X. On their part, the High British Government, in consideration of these treaties and eno-agements that I have entered into with them, undertake to protect me and my subjects and territory from all aggression by sea, and to do their utmost to exact reparation for all injuries that I, or my subjects, may suffer when proceeding to sea upon our lawful occasions. XL They also undertake to grant me good offices, should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar. It is, however, thoroughly understood that this obligation rests upon the British Government only in the event of such aggression, whether by land or sea, being unprovoked by any act or aggression on the part ol myself or my subjects against others. .

Dear Mr.Hearn, ihe revised draft of the concession which the Anglo-J-’ersian Oil Company are anxious to secure in respect of the State of 0,atar which was ccmmunicated to us at our meeting with you and Mr.Fraser on the 11th December has now been examined by the Departments concerned. As you will see from what follows there are certain points on which we are not yet in a position to let you know in detail the views of His Majesty’s Government. But we are anxious to facilitate and expedite so far as possible the course of your negotiations with the Sheikh of Q,atar and we hope that, even if further discussion is necessary between the Company and the representatives of His Majesty's Government on certain points, the information contained in this letter will give you a general idea of the position, and will enable you to give the necessary instructions without delay to Mr.Chisholm. Procedure. We should like in the first place to make certain suggestions as regards procedure. 1 ou will remember that in the course of the discussion on 14th Decemoer the attention of the Company was drawn to His Majesty’s Government’s desire to safeguard certain matters such as air, wireless and telegraphic arrangements, the relations of tne Company with the Sheikh and the local representatives of His Majesty’s Government etc., and the suggestion was made on your side that it would be preferable that matters such as these should not be included in the actual agreement between the Company and the Sheikh and that they might equally satisfactorily/ A,c -Hearn, Esq. , Aftglo-Persian Oil Company, Britannic House, Finsbury Circus, S.C.2.1 2 . satisfactorily be disposed of by a.n exchange of letters between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. As the ^ result of further consideration we now think that the simplest course would be that there should be two agreements, the first between the Company and the Sheikh, the second between the Company and His Majesty’s Government. The Agreement between the Conpany and the Sheikh would be essentially a commercial agreement which would deal with commercial points only and would not include anything of a purely political character. It would, however, contain a clause to the effect that it should not come into force until His Majesty’s Government had given their written consent to it. This would be in accordance with the Sheikh’s treaty obligations and difficulty should not therefore arise sc far as he is concerned in agreeing to it. Subject to this and to the modifications discussed below such an agreement could probably be substantially identical with the ’revised drait agreement' which we are now considering. 3. The proposed second Agreement between His Majesty’s Government and the Company - the completion of which would be a condit-iun of the approval of His Majesty’s Government *o tne first, or Canmercial Agreement between the Company and the Sheikh - would cover points of special interest to His Majesty’s Government. We think on the whole that a formal agreement would be a more satisfactory method of dealing with these questions than an exchange of letters, though on the understanding that legal effect could be given to any undertakings embodied in an exchange of letters and that such undertakings would be binding on any assignee, transferee or subsidiary company formed to operate the Qatar concession, as well as on the original concessionaire, we should not regard the/The the question of form as one of vital importance, matters which His Majesty’s Government, as at present advised, contemplate that such an agreement would cover are ^set out in paragraph 5 and following helow. i ought to make it clear that it is intended that the conditions to be embodied in this Agreement would be c-mditi«ns which would apply not merely to your Company or another British concessionaire, but to any company, of whatever nationality, which may endeavour to secure an oil concession in Qatar. ^* Amendments in ’revised draft concession ’ . For convenience these have been set out in the enclosure to this letter. Save in respect of Article 12, on which, as you will remember, it proved impossible to reach agreement at our discussion on December 14th, and of a suggestion on Article 2, they are substantially identicaJ. with those which were thin provisionally agreed between us and w r hich you have already communicated to Mr. Chisholm, though there are two or three points of minor importance which were not included in your communication to Mr. Chisholm and which, according to our record, were discussed at our meeting. 5. Content of special Agreement between Anglo-Persian Oil Company and His Majesty’s Government . I now turn to the question of the matters to be included in the special agreement or exchange of letters referred t o in paragraph 3 above between His Majesty’s Government and the Company. As already explained the requirements of His Majesty’s Government under this head 'will apply equally to any company, whatever its nationality, which may seek to obtain an oil concession in Qatar* As you will appreciate, certain of these matters involve c onsideration/consideration of points of some difficulty on which it will he necessary to consult the Government of India and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf before His Majesty’s Government can reach a final decision. Partly for this reason, and partly because in the short time at our disposal it has been impossible to be certain that we have exhausted the various aspects of the matters in question, we propose at this stage to indicate them only in general outline. We will in due course, and I hope before very long, let you have a statement in greater detail and possibly in a form suitable for inclusion in an agreement of the nature which we suggest, and we shall, of course, be ready to discuss matters further if on receipt of that statement the position seems to you obscure in any respect or there are any points you wish to raise. 6 . We are anxious in the first place to secure an understanding that any sites which His Majesty’s Government may select for aeroplane or seaplane bases in Qatar in the future (at the moment there is merely an informal arrangement in regard to a particular landing ground at Hohah) shall be secure from interference. As was mentioned in our discussion on 14th December an undertaking of this nature has been given by the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession. The understanding would equally apply to haroours in the perhaps improbable event of His Majesty’s Government deciding at a later stage for any reason to develop a harbour m Qatar, and it would be necessary also to cover the question of wireless and telegraphic communications. 7. Secondly, as you will remember, we have emphasised in the discussions which we have had on the question of5. s ccnoesGi on ijn© vbi*' 7 ' ^p t q i a i -j +• ■? /-•»oi j . . . ^ ^ J - L poll uical conditions of ^ atar# As yoa imo ^» 11 is practically unexplored by Europeans; its hinterland is unadministored, its people axe bacinvard, scattered, and unfamiliar with the elements of ordinary western civilization; of serious political trouble, responsibilit would fall back on His Majesty 1 s y for dealing with wiii ch Government, in connection with the Company* s activities in so far as these might either cause misunderstanding on the part of the local iniiabi uant s or in any way affect religious or similar institutions or buildings, cannot be overlooked, and a further complication arises from the fact that the ooundaries of tnc State of Qatar are undelimited* His Majesty* s Government regard it as most important in these circumstances that there should be a clear understanding with the Gonipany (which would, of course, extend to any assignee, transferee, or subsidiary company working the concession) that they will undertake to pay due deference at all times to the wishes of the Sheikh (which His Majesty*s Government will on their side see are not unreasonable in character) and to the advice of the political representatives of His Majesty*s Government in the Persian Gulf, whether stationed in Qatar or not* 8 . Thirdly, while we are not yet in a position to make a positive proposal to you on this point, it is not improbable that His Majesty*s Government as at present advised will require provision to secure the same degree of British control as has been discussed with you in the case of the parent or of any transferee Company, in respect of any subsidiary companies operating the concession, ox the nature embodied in sub-clause 1 of the tentative redraft ox Article 12 of the revised concession which you drew up at our/6. 6. our meeting on Deeemter 14th. In particular it^v, 7 ill be regarded as essei-tial to secure that the concession is operated locally by British personnel exclusively. Provision would also have to be made in regard to the nationality and position oi the Chief Local Representative of the operating Company (this would of course include tne question of the channel of c cmmuni cation between the Chief Local Representative and the Sheikh), the refining of oil won either locally in C^atar or in British neighoouring territory, and the right of pre-emption in time of war. These are all matters which can, we think, best be included in a separate agreement between the Ccmpany and His Majesty’s Government which would be c cmmuni cate d to the Sheikh but to which he would not be a party: and we feel that, other considerations apart, such an arrangement may facilitate the task of negotiating a ccmmercial agreement with him. 9. I hope the information contained in this letter, incomplete or provisional in character as it inevitably still is on certain important points, will meet your purpose. If there is anything on which you are not clear, perhaps you would be so kind as to let me know. I should be grateful if you would let me know the views o t the Company on the procedure suggested, and if you would confirm that they are prepared to accept the amendments to the ’’revised M concession set out in the enclosure to this letter, and also the understandings suoject to which certain amendments have been inserted or omitted. m one further point, which was mentioned in tne course of our discussions , I ought perhaps to put on recoid '-bav while the draft Agreement, with the modifications and subject to the supplementary Agreement proposed, would in present/present circumstances be generally acceptable to His Majesty’s Government, it would of course be understood that they are not permanently canmitted to the terms in question and that should the present negotiations between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Sheikh break down, or any other material alteration in tne situation take place (such as the appearance of a competing company) they must reserve themselves full liberty of action.

No comment. No comment. (a) If the position of air etc. facilities is safeguarded in the separate agreement or exchange of letters between the Company and His Majesty 1 s Government referred to in paragraph 3 c£ the covering letter it will be unnecessary to make special provision in this article. (b) It is understood thru the words 'or such normal extensions thereof as might be indicated by the Sheikh' reier to religious lands and religious buildings. The following redraft is suggested to make the position clear:- 'or such normal extensions or such religious lands^ cemeteries^ or buildings^ as the Sheikh may indicate....' (c) In addition to the amendments above we should like to suggest the omission or a reference to a map &gt; at any rate at this stage The precise boundaries of G, a t' ar are at the moment under investigation by the political authorities. It is hoped that a very early decision ‘..ill be reached regarding them and a map can best be produced and attached when agreement has been reached on thi^ point. The point could best be met by the omission of the words '(as shown/Article o Article 4. Sii° ;n generally 0 n the nap annexed hereto)', (d) The Con at the end of tie first sub-paragraph 'and any subsequent extensions thereof.' 'riic- Company agreed to consider rliiicaCiOn of this article on the lines O-l Articles 12A and 13 of their Persian concession, subject to certain verbal modifications. We suggest that the article might be revised to read somewhat as follows: - ''a. The Company shall make a thorough investigation of the State of Qatar by such methods as may in its opinion best enable it to ascertain its oil possibilities. In carrying ou o its operations under this Agreement the Company shall employ all means customary and proper and shall exploit its Concession by methods in accordance with the latest scientific progress. 'The Company undertakes to keep accurate Of wells drilled + . plans, maps, records /and such other data whether topographical, geological or of drilling srunir as it is customary to keep and such material shall be open to inspection by the Sheikh or his duly authorised representativ 'The Company shall supply an annual report to the Sheikh of its operations under t hi s A gr e l. me nt. ' It was agreed on December 14th that so long as (a) the financial terms to be given to the Sheikh under this article were such as/I I IP^IMSSPSP' ‘* s ' W ' ' a Article 5« Article 6. as -go give full weight to the fact that the ^oripcjiy Vvould obtain an exclusive concession OY._i t.ie wuole areci of Qatar, which appears to be rather over 3,000 square miles, without oj-.e cific drilling obligations or without any ci.efinite obligation in the event of oil being proved to proceed to commercial production within a given time, and (bj the Sheikh fully understood that the yffecr oi acceptance ofthe royalty formula pro posed would be that royalty would have to be paid only on oil actually exported from or sold for consumption in Qatar and not on the oil production, no modification of this article need be suggested, lie comment. In the 5th line of the Article the words 11 as it may require' appear to have been omitted. The Company agreed at the meeting on 14th I)e c emb e r (a) to insert the words 'subject to the pro visions of Article 7' after the word 'right' in the first line ofthis article; (b) to insert at the end of the first sub- paragraph the words 'but not otherwise' after the words 'for the purposes of its operations'; (c) The question of a special safeguard in respect of telegraphic and wireless installations was discussed in connection with this clause. We do not wish to press that this should be specifically covered in the Commercial Agreement with the Sheikh so long as it is understood that it will be included in one sep^aiate agreemeno oo be concluded between the Company and His Majesty 1 s Government. (d)/jrtiele 7 (d} On a separato point, the Company 1 s representatives were very reluctant to agree to any specific safeguard for the political interests involved or for the position of the Sheikh in the clause, and the suggestion v/as made that it might be possible to meet the difficulties felt by the interested Departments of His 11ajesty’s Government by an exchange of letters in which the Company would undertake to give all due deference to the views of His Majesty’s Government and the Sheikh in the exercise of their rights under this article. To this we understood that tiie Company’s representatives agreed and so long as it is understood that the ^ point will be covered in a separate agreement between the Company and His Majesty’s Government we do not wish to press ror its insertion here. (a) So long as the safeguards desired by His Majesty’s Government in respect of air facilities etc. are dealt with in a separate agreement between His Majesty's Government and the Company, no moaification of the first sub-paragraph of this article to cover this point will oe necesoamj-. (b) The Company have agreed to insert ’’with the consent of and” after the words 'leased by it” in the opening sentence of sub-paragraph 2. : .ve suggest on a point of drafting that in the same sentence bhe words 'but the terms of such purchase or lease shall not be in excess” etc. should be substitutod/ ■■HiArticle S. Article 10 A rticle 11 Article 12, substituted for the words ,r but such conditions shall not be in excess. 11 Sub-paragraph (i). Second sentence. The Company have agreed to insert the words 11 subject to the same conditions' . In connection with this article it was understood at the meeting on the 14th December that the Company would see no objection to the addition of a provision in this article or perhaps more appropriately in Article 6 to the effect that the Sheikh 'shall have the right to use harbours utilised or constructed by the Company, provided that such use in no way hampers the C ompany or int erf eres with the safety of its operations.' It was agreed in connection with this l article that there could be no question of acceding to the Sheikh’s request that rifles should be supplied by the Company. At the meeting on 14th December Mr.Hearn, after considerable discussion, suggested the following redraft, which might, he thought, be acceptable to the Iraq Petroleum Company, but beyond which he was not prepared to go: - 'Article 12. The Company shall have the right to transfer this agreement-to any other British commercial company, but not to any government, subject to such Company being able to fulfil all the duties and obligations of this- agreement. The Company shall inform the Sheikh if it so transfers this agreement. Such other commercial company shall be and remain/6. remain a British company, registered in Great Britain, having its principalplace of business in Great Britain, and the Chairman shall at all times be a British subject, n 'The Company shall be at liberty to form one or more subsidiary companies under its own control should it consider this to be necessary for the working of this concession. Any such subsidiary company shall, so far as they are applicable to its operations, enjoy all the rights and privileges granted to the Company hereunder, and shall assume all the engagements and responsibilities herein expressed, except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause.” The redraft in question has been further considered by the interested Departments of His Majesty 1 s Government. Their position in regard to British control, British exploitation, the position and nationality of the Chief Local Eepresentative, etc. in any oil concession in Qatar is referred to in paragraph 8 of the covering letter, though, as there stated, they are notyet in a position to set out minimum conditions in so many words their So far as the commercial agreement between the Company and the Sheikh is concerned thejr would however be content to accept s.s Article 18 mm xirot two sentences of sub-paragraph 1 or Mf.hearts redraft and sub-paragraph k or the same i e dr aft less the words 'except the engagement expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause” and to omit any reference to Bri uisn control from the comne re i al/commercial agreement with the Sheikh long as it was under c tood that the nuestion would he covered in a separate agreement between H.M.Gr. ana the Company. On ^ point of drafting, it is suggested that the word ^Agreement' be substituted for the word ’'Concession 4 '' in the first sentence of sub-para.2 of the redraft. The Company agreed, subject to discussion with the Shell Company, to the insertion in sub-para 2 of a provision that ^producing wells or borings at the time of such termination shall be handed over in good order and repair and fit for further working' and to make a corresponding amendment in substitution for the words 'in such working condition as the property then is' in sub-para. 2 and We have not yet heard the result of their discussion; but we note that Article 20 (ll) and (ill) of the revised Persian Concession requires wells to be handed over in good order ana that there appear to be no lack of precedents for a provision of this nature (e.g. in the Brunei concession, which is operated by the Shell Company, Clause 19 reads; '19. The Lessees shall (save in respect of any operations of whicn the Lessor shall have sanctioned the abandonment) at the end or sooner determination oi the said term aelivei up8 , Article 15. jrticlc 16. to the Lessor in good order repair and condition ana fit for further working' all productive wells or borings which shall have oeen made by the Lessees urder the liberty and power in that behalf herein- o^fore contained..; while the Iraq concessions both of the I.P.G. and the British Oil development provide that H the Company shall maintain in good working order all wells drilled so long as they are economically productive. H ) It was suggested to the Company, who, it is understood, saw no objection, that the words ‘ v the period of such delay, together with any such period as may be necessary for the restoration of ;/ might be amended, in the interests of the Sheikh, to read 'the period of such delay together with such period as may be reasonably necessary, subject to the approval (or in the view) of the Political Eosident, for the restoration, etc. u It was made clear at the meeting on 14th December that attached importance to the restoration of the Political Ecsident in substitution for the Court of International Justice as the person to be responsible for nominating the third arbitrator. It was understood that the Company saw no objection to this. H.M.Gr., while attaching importance to the modification, see no objection to the Company ra postponing communication of it to the/ Aarticle 17 9. the eheikh until their negotiations with him have reached a more advanced stage. When such a communication is made they are equally willing that the Company should inform the oheikh that the modification is mo.de at the request of H.M.G-., who have intimated that it is in accordance with the practice in other Persian Gulf oil concessions and that they must make it an assent iol condition of any concession granted to any company. (a) Ghe Company agreed, in the second sentence of the article, to add ihe word l 'sui table h oefore the word “labourers !&lt; in line 5, and to delete the words '*ur demand unrcasonable wages. 11 (b) Ghov have also indicated that they would welcome the exercise of jurisdiction ■&lt; by H.M.G. and that they are not prepared to accede to the theikh f s request that he should exercise jurisdiction in disputes between their employees and his subjects. Ghe question of jurisdiction is one which can most suitably be decided in direct discussion between the Sheikh and H.M.G. If necessary a reference can be made to the position in the agreement proposed between the company and H.M.G. (c) The question of the nationality of tho exploiting personnel arises for consideration in connection with this article./ farticle. This, as indicated in para.8 of the covering letter, is a matter which, in the view of H.L1.G-., can most suitably be covered in the agreement to be reached between them and the Company, and on the understanding that it will be disposed of in that connection they do not desire to suggest any modification of the terms of the article. It may, however, be placed on record that the American interests which are operating the Bahrein oil concession have agreed to a provision in respect of the employment of British personnel. Article 20 . It is understood that the Company propose to stand out for an Arabic and an Lnglish text. INDIA OFFICE, 29tli December, 1933.P.Z. 8204/33.

It will, of course, be appreciated that neither Pendel nor I in the conversation in question were able to commit our respective departments, and that, as stated in paragraph 8 of the record, 'the whole question of policy will, of course, have to be considered on the widest grounds ana the points at issue would have to be « submitted to higher authority. 1/ • » H.A.F.

The question of future policy in regard to ^uax, do Ni generally and with particular reference to L-ne Questions raised oy any oil concession that might ud granted tnere, was discussed infernally with Lr.ftenael on the 15th Decemher. t,ne Question of general policy I recalled tho-t one position was that % atar had an a re a of rather ovur 3,000 square miles and a population of some 26,000 ^1917;. Our relations with it 'were governed oy a Treaty (on the general line of the Trucial Treaties) made with tim pic sent SheiKh oy Sir Percy Cox in 1916. We had agree at the time that three articles of that Treaty, viz., Articles 7 (admission of British subjects to Qatar for trade;, 8 (admission oi an agent on behalf of and 9 (establishment of post and telegraph offices in Qatar), should not come into operation for hie present. We had also given the Sheikh an undertaking in general terms to grant him good offices 'should I or my subjects be assailed by land within the territories of Qatar.' 1 (Article 11). In 1921, the sheikh had represented that he was alarmed lest some of his townspeople should become Akhwan and go over to Ibn Saud anu had asked whether H.M.G. would assist him should he be attacked from the interior. He had been informed in reply that H.M.G. were not/not prepared to promise more tnan diplomatic assistance should ne hb attacked oy Ion oauu. Nothing of much conseQuence as ri sealing on general relations witn H.ivnG, had occurred in Qatar between then and 1932, when, after unsuccessful negotiations with tne Sheikh for aerodrome facilities, which had broken down because of our refusal to give him the formal guarantee of protection in all circumstances v/hich he was anxious to secure, we nud marked out a i&amp;naing ground by dropping bags of chalk from the air near Don ah and haa warned him tnat if aircraft using it were molested he would be called to account* out that if he treated them well he would be rewarded• in tne same ^ Q^r uhe A * P • C »a • had, witn our knowledge and permission, entered into direct negotiations with the Sheikh for the purpose of securing an oil concession which, however, if obtained, would have to be transferred to the Iraq Petroleum Company, in accordance with the Group Agreement between that Company and the A.F.O.C. Negotiations were still proceeding, but the Sheikh had adopted an evasive attitude towards the British political authorities in the Gulf in respect of them. The latest information from the Company was to the effect that he had been anxious to secure their concurrence in the exercise by him of jurisdiction in ary disputes which might arise between his subjects and their employees; that ne had asked them to an del uak c to supply hiux with arms for tne defence of their works (a request which strictly speaking was hardly consistent with Article 3 of his Treaty of 1915}; and that he had indicated, in connection with the arbitration provisions to os included in trie concession under negotiation, that he was apprehensive oi the Political resident; was anxious that some international oody such as the permanent Court of International Justice at Tne Hague should be referred to, but disliked tna suggestion that the/tne President of tne Court should be specifically nominated, on the ground that he might be an Englishman, a. There seemed now some possibility that the A,ir#IJ,C# Illignt secure tne concession from tne Sieikh, who appeared to oe actively interested ana it was probably, tnere 10 re, of immediate importance to consider what steps wu should, take to tighten up our general political relations with Qatar. The most important points were: jurisdiction, and the bringing into force of the dormant articles of the Shaikh’s Treaty. If, however, we were going to- raise these major questions we might as well take the opportunity to secure the Air Ministry desiderata hi regard to aerodromes, etc., from the Sheikh. It was, oi course, clear tnat no action coula be taken until we consulted and had the recommendations of the Government of India -no one Political Resident, who are both closely c onc e rn e d with th e question. 4 ’ On the question of jurisdiction it would he desirable; to aim at an agreement on the lines'of those in iorce in Koweit and Bahrein, the effect of which would be to transfer jurisdiction over foreigners in tne state to H.m.G. Much difficulty might be anticipated in persuading the Sheikh, who was an obstinate ana suspicious old nun with a rather narrow outlooK, to agree to any such surrender of his rights; but, particularly if there was to be any risk of an influx of foreign employees, the point was one of real substance. b. The appointment of a political Officer in Qata r might be of rather less urgency. It seemed unlikely to be en inviting place for a European. No European, except for casual travellers, had entered it; it had no large town;I X (the population of Dohah in 1917 was about 12,000);’its population was backward and appeared to be to a large extent nomadic Bedouin, and the ordinary resources of civilisation which were to be found in varying degrees m Koweit, Bahrein and Iwuscatwere entirely lacking. On tne Otner hand, if. there was to be a serious oil development in the country, accompanied by the erection 0 . elaoorute buildings, refineries, etc., ana possibly Dy tne introauction of indiviauals of various nationalities, it would probably be essential to have a polxticao. Officer on tne spot to exercise jurisdiction, ana, once the concession had been negotiated, to serve (as in Bahrein) as the channel of correspondence between nne Company and the Sheikh, clearly, however, large questions oi policy were involved, and it was conceivable tnat it might be necessary in the long run to bring forciole pressure to Dear on the Sheikh to secure our ao slue rata. If it came to that, it was not irrelevant that Qatar, which was a rectangle of which the two long siaes ana one snort side were bounded by the sea, was in some ways almost as open to forcible pressure as an island such as Banre in, although nothing could of course oe done in ths desert hinterland.. 3o much for the general political position. Ine next question to consider was the problems which might arise in connection with the grant of an oil concession to tne A.P.ChC. or any other Company. The Foreign Office had always made it clear that they were anxious to walk very carefully in this part of the world, so as to avoid an oil war with American oil interests over what was on a long view a relatively unimportant are ana haa emphasised in connection with both Koweit and Bahrein/© v 7/ Bahrain 'thuii t&gt;o work on ■ths bus is oi policy s( Co o. Ljfi o ps n qq o r On the other hand the India Oxxico and Aoniiialt.y, while appreciating the Foreign Office point 01 view, had been anxious to uo their utmost to secure that for local political reasons, and in view of our special treaty relations ana responsibilities, any aevolopmeno in these areas should be so far as possible under m itish control. In the case of Bahrein a compromise haa finally been reached which seemed at the moment to be wording satisfactorily, out which was not in itself ideal, under which the American interests concerned had given owitain guarantee;s as regards the employment of British P s - some 1 e tc • -Lllo p 0 olt ion in Ko we it vv d aj. uo op^n ana YvouI u have to uo cuu^ider near future. In the case of a r it 11 a; accepted that the A.P.O.C., if they secured their eCueeociion, .vOUxa xi-aVe uo transf er iu to the i*x'• C#, wnich was an international bo ay containing only a relatively small British element, but no corrxnitment had been entered into as regards the conditions in respect of British representation and control which H.ib.G. (whose consent was necessary to tnegrant b^ the Sheikh of ary concession) would attach to their consent. Ihe representatives of the meeting wnicn had la ken December, of wnicn a ♦ * ^ roc irculated, haa b to enter into any pernanent commitment as regards the British character of the exploitation of any concession granted (although they had responded well to a suggestion that certain connected safeguards might be covered in exchanges of letters between H.LBG. and the Company) ana the point by agreement had be^n left over for further consideration.7. We had now admitted American interests to develop the Bahrein concession ana the door was open to them in Kpweit. On the Tnicial. toast our present policy was to exclude all oil concession hunters, whether British or foreign, on the ground of tne backward character of the area ana the risks involved. No interest nad oeen shown for many years by any company in oil in Mfscato With Hasa we were not ourselves concerned. Ko suggestion could in these circumstances be made that we had refused to agree to an 'open door' policy in the Gull where oil was concerned when circumstances were sucn as to make this possible or had discriminated against trie U. 8 .A. But the position in Qatar was quite peculiar. As already remarked, it was an uncivilised and undeveloped Arab sheikhdom, the boundaries of which wei e unaeiinea; and which non-Asiatic foreigners could at present enter only with the Resident’s permission; with an unadministered hinterland and a scattered population, possibilities of difficulty with which in tne event of their contact with foreign labourers or non-Asiatic subordinate personnel of the wrong type might well be considerable. If any such trouble arose H.M.G. would either have to deal with it themselves or allow it to ce dealt with by the foreign powers whose nationals were affected. To allow foreign powers to deal with it would, of course, be contrary to our general principles in this part of the world, and the Sheikh was, for that matter, precluded by his treaty engagements from having any dealings with foreign powers or receiving their representatives. Assuming, however, that the responsibility7. ior Handling the situation devolved upon us, it was evident that we were faced with a far more difficult prooiem in Qitar than elsewhere. Bahrein was an island and easily subject to pressure from the sea. Pressure, at any rate on the sea front and on the capital could also be brought to bear in Koweit, tnougn the situation there had many points of resernolance to Qatar, and special safeguards on similar lines might have to be considered. Iraq and rersia were both more or less civilised countries with a central authority, with a regular system of government alia without an unaaministored hinterland. But the responsibilities in which we might be involved in the case of Qatar, running as it did back into the desert, -iuL ius aosence oi regular supplies, etc., might be very serious indeed. Having regard to this (assuming that we could not, as on the Iruciai coast, prohioit any oil development) was it quite impossible for uo to adopt the same line in the matter of oil in Qatar as we had along the whole Arab littoral in connection wiuh aix' procedure? There, with the concurrence of the Foreign Office ana trie other interested Departments, we haa aaopted a facade policy, which we proposed, if said when the time came, to apply to Qatar also, securing for ourselves complete control of air facilities, civil or military, behind the facade of the Sheikh, and declining to allow foreigners to use the Arab air route, save on a line laid down by us, or to visit certain areas/8. arsas of fhe Arab coast, on the ground, that the political conditions there v/ere such that we were not prepared to iace the risks involved, responsibility for dealing with which rested with us under our special treaty relations with the rulers concerned, a type of solution which had occurred to me personally as possible was that we should lay it down as a general rule, to apply to any oil company, whether British or American, which might succeed in obtaining a concession in Cyatar, that, for the political reasons which I had just explained, the exploitation of the concession and the local representations of the concessionnaire must be wholly in British hands (no doubt a compromise could be arranged as regards one or two highly expert individuals if it proved impossible to fill their places from British sources). No question of discrimination against American interests would arise and our justification if we were challenged through the diplomatic channel would be that we had dealt with the case on merits; that the political conditions of Qatar were quite special; that while we were prepared to face certain risks in respect of our own nationals we were not prepared to face them in respect of those of aher countries; that we equally intended to hold the Sheikhs to their special treaty obligations to us in the matter of dealing with foreign countries, and that while we did not propose necessarily to stipulate that any company, which, or a subsidiary of which, was operating in Qatar, should itself be under complete British control, we could not agree to exploitation or local representation save by personnel of British nationality ana subject to certain specific/■ ■&gt; 9. specific understandings, e.g. that the Company would in its dealings with the Sheikh or the local inhabitants be guided oy our advice. (The terras of any reply would, of course, turn on whether or not H.M.G. had intimated their readiness to agree to an American or other non-British company obtaining and operating an oil concession and on the terms of any such agreement). 8. Mr.Rendel said that he appreciated the force of the above arguments, and that while the whole Question of policy would, of course, have to be considered on the widest grounds and the points at issue would have to be submitted to higher authorities, his personal first impression was that it should be possible to make a strong case for insisting, as regards Qatar, on conditions regarding British exploitation and local management on the lines suggested. All this would, however, take time, and meanwhile it seemed to him extremely important that nothing should be done to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh, since any such dela.y might well result in a purely American interest (e.g.the Standard Oil cf California which already holds the Hasa Coast concession) coming in as a serious competitor, and possibly acquiring the concession; in which case H.M.G. would be in a far more difficult position than if* they had to deal with the A.P.O.C. or even the I.P. C. 9. Mr. Rend el explained that in his view there were two types of questions involved, i.e. those between the Company and the Sheikh, which would have to be dealt with in the concession no?/ under negotiation, and uhose between the Company and H.M.G. , which might involve difficult questions/10. n questions of policy. The question of the safeguards to 'be insex ted in any oil agreement to preserve the British character of the operating company on the lines suggested above seemed to him to fall within the second category. 10. He therefore suggested that it should he made clear to the Company at once that we should eventually, in view of the peculiar political situation on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf, have to insist on certain safeguards before we could agree to any concession coming into force. These safeguards would be of general application and would apply equally in the case of any concession which the Sheikh might grant. H.M.G. did not wish, however, to delay the conclusion of an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh by holding matters up pending the discussion of the details of these safeguards at this stage. They would therefore suggest that the concession should contain a clause providing that it should not come into force until H.M.G. had given their written consent thereto. This would De in accordance with the Sheikh’s treaty obligations towards us. Our eventual consent would then be dependent on our reaching a separate agreement with the Company, which might be embodied in an exchange of letters and which would contain particulars of any safeguards it was eventually decided to insist upon. 11. This would limit the immediate discussion to outstanding points in which H.M.G. had a direct interest between the Company and the Sheikh, such as the question of jurisdiction etc., but would avoid any risk of the concession being lost or delayed while arguments were proceeding/proceeding on natters winch, did not strictly speaking affect the Sheikh and would in any case be of equal application whatever company was seeking to obtain a c oncess i on . 12. Meanwhile, if we could give the Company any indication of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which we should have to insist upon it would be all to the good. 13. It was agreed that a note of the conversation should be prepared to serve as a basis for further considerati on.h r RCNij'ISKKTIAL.

(1) The meeting after discussion of the line to he taken in the light of the telegram No.606, dated 19th December 1933 from the Polirical Agent, Bahrein, (copies circulated under P.Z.8165/33) on the subject of the intentions of the Bahrein Petroleum Company as regards local refining, concurred in a draft of instructions to the Political Resident (despatched as India Office telegram 3173, of 22nd December). (2) Mr.Laithwaite briefly explained the latest developments in connection with the request of the Bahrein Petroleum Company for the assistance oi H.M.G. in surveying, buoying and lighting certain approaches to Bahi ein in connection with the shipment of oil w.n hy them. As the result of discussion at the Admiralty it had hem thought better, in the interests of avoiding any excuse for the introduction of 0.3. naval personnel to conduct surveys, etc., and of keeping control of any lighting and buoying arrangements in British hands, to give the Company all possible assistance •n a repayment basis. It was now proposed, aft*r discussion with the Company’s representatives, to invite the Government of India, if they saw no objection, to undertake the necessary^work, on a repayment basis so that full control for any buoys laid, would be secured to Government* The Company had intimated that the Standard Oil Company of California had placed an expert party at their disposal who would arrive in London from the U.S.A. on 4th January en route for Bahrein to deal with the question of the laying of the proposed submarine pipeline and the connected questions of laying moorages and floats. The meeting took note of the position* II• Qatar Oil Concession* The meeting resumed consideration of the revised oil concession communicated informally by the A*P*CuCo on 11th December 1933, in the light of the record of the discussion which had taken place with the representatives of the Company on 14th December, (P.2.8212/33)* Mr.Laithwaite said that the A.P*0*C. were pressing for the earliest possible indication of any amendments that H.M.G. might desire, in the interests of facilitating Mr.Chisholm’s negotiations in Qatar, and had been anxious for information before Christmas. That was impossible, but it seemed desirable to let them have a letter early next w#am. The meeting agreed. It was agreed that it would be best iicst to consider the general procedure to be adopted in negot.'uxirig with the Company ana the Sheikh; secondly, the supplementary amendments, if any, to be suggested to the Company m Articles of the revised draft concession othe^ -ham Arti--^ thirdly, Article 12 and the connected questions or British control, exclusive British exploitation of any concession granted (though this point strictly arose on Article l?j, and the maintenance of a British Chief Local Representative of the Company in Qatar. The India Office .consideration in this connection of certain special restrictions, arising out of political conditions in Qatar, which would apply to all Companies applying for concessions whatever their nationality* III. A. Procedure« On the question or procedure, Mr.Lajthwaite said that as the A-p.O.C. were apparently willing to cover certain points of special interest to H.M.G. in an exchange of letters (which must of course he of a character binding on the Company and on any transferees or assignees), the simplest course, in the light of previous informal discussion with the Foreign Office, and subject to the views of the meeting, appeared to be that there should be: (a) an agreement between the Company and the Sheikh which should be purely commercial in character, possio^y on the general lines of the revised draft concession which the Company had now submitted, with such modification of Article 12 and such minor amendments in other articles as might be thought necessary; (b) a subsidiary agreement between the A.P.O.C. ana H.M.U. to cover matters of interest primarily to H.M.G. and tbe Company, rather than to H.M.G. and the Sheihh, or to the Company and the Sheikh, and to deal essentially with political points. This agreement, which should be binding not only on the Company, but on any assignee or transferee company, could be either an exchange of letters or a formal agreement, perhaps preierably the latter. The Company at the discussion on 14th December had indicated their readiness to deal with certain points cf this character in an exchange of letters. Such an ^ rr QPi-fptmards for aerodromes agreement could cover, e.g. saleguaia* _ safeguards for wireless and other seaplane baseo, saxeguaj. nas bv the Company that they wou--^ communications, unaertaKings oy xn pay/pay due deference to the advice of our political representatives and the views of the Sheikh, possibly (a point to be discussed later in connection with Article 12 of the revised draft concession), exclusive British exploitation of any concession, the appointment of a British Chief Local Representative, etc. Apart from the points covered by (a) and (b), closer examination of the problem haa shown that the grant of any oil concession by the Sheikh, whether to the A.P.O.C., the I.P.C., or an American Company, would give rise to difficult political problems in connection with jurisdiction over the concessionnaire’s employees, the grant of protection by H.M.G. in cases in which local conditions made this necessary and the Sheikh for any reason failed to afford it, and, probably, the appointment of a Political Agent to represent H.M.G. and would make it necessary to consider bringing into force certain articles of the Sheikh’s Treaty of 1916 which were at present dormant. Such questions could best be dealt with in a third agreement or exchange of letters between the Sheikh and H.M.G. Considerable difficulty might be anticipated in disposing of them: and if we were to take them up with the Sheikh and try to reach a general understanding with him on political points, it might he thought desirable to take the opportunity also to secure the air facilities in Qatar which the Sheikh had hitherto refused to give save in return for guarantees of protection which H.M.G. were not prepared to undertake. Mr.Rendel said that, speaking personally, he was entirely in favour of a procedure such as had been described. Higher authority at the Foreign Office had not of course yet bem consulted. But action on these lines would, he was confident, be consistent with their general view/5. view as at present advised: which was that, so long as the interests oi -I.k.h. and of the Sheikh were adequately safeguarded ^ nothing snould oe done which would tend to hamper the conclusion Ox an agreement between the Sheikh and the A.P.O.C. in the im^eiiate future# Delay would inevitably increase the risk that tne Standard Cil Company of California might actively interest tne ms elves in ootaimng the concession# Were they once to enter the field, they could rely on the active support of the U.S. Government, and however strong the case on merits for any special conditions which H.M.G. might be anxlous to secure in respect of British control, British exploitation, British local representation &amp;c•, we should almost certainly find it much more difficult to have our way on such points when dealing with a wholly foreign company backed by the U.S. Government than when dealing with a company such as the Iraq Petroleum Company in which there was a substantial British element. The procedure proposed, with an important proviso which the Foreign Office had already recommended to the India Office, would make it possible for the A.P.O.C. to pursue negotiations immediately with the Sheikh with a view to reaching agreement on commercial points, - such an agreement to contain no clauses of a political character such as provision for jurisdiction &amp;c. While those negotiations were in progress, we could separately discuss with the Company the points to oe covered in tne pioposeu Agreement between the Company and H.M.n.: wrile tne local political authorities, after consultation witn il.k.u. and the Government of India, could press on witn a settlement Oj. the points in issue between H.M.G. and the Sheikh. The proviso to which he had referred, and which ii accepted snould xully safeguard the special interests of H.M.G., was that a clause should be inserted in any commercial agreement between the A.P.O.C. and the Sheikh to the effect that the Agreement could not/6 • not come into force until the consent of H.M.G. had been ^obtained to its provisions.. Such a clause merely reaffirna d the Shexlui 1 s existing treaty ODligations and ought not therefore to cause difficulty vith him. Vis-a-vis the Company it w ould emphasize the special position of H.M.G. in the matter. - — • hen del added that in his view it would be desirable that the conditions to be laid down, in respect of British control and exploitation of any concession, in whatever form they might emerge as a result of discussion by higher authority, and if necessary of reference to the Cabinet, should be conditions which would apply not merely to a British concessionaire but to any other Company, of whatever nationality, which might endeavour to secure a concession in Qatar. We had not yet thought out in detail at what conditions it would be desirable to aim, the questions involved were difficult and would need careful consideration, and it might therefore be impossible at once to inform the A*P.0.C. what precisely the conditions would be. But so long as their general outline could be communicated to the Company without delay, and the Company given to understand that whatever detailed conditions were finally laid down would be cf universal application, it ought considerably to reduce their difficulties in negotiating either with the Sheikh or with the I.P.C. Mr. Seal said that, so far as he could judge, uue Admiralty on the understandings stated by Mr. KendeX, were unlikely to object to the procedure suggested. He thong •it that it was essential that the main lines of the agreement wit.. H.ruu. should be canmunicated to the Company in the. very near future, . in order to avoid any suggestion that the Company.had been allowed to proceed with the commercial agreement with the Sneikn on false pretences: also that if any difficulty weie uo experienced/experienced in getting the Sheikh to agree to our terms it would be imo 01 tant uO devise some means of avoiding the irapi e So ion mat pressure was being brought to bear upon him in the interests of the A.P.G.C, * Laith yj a 1 .1e said that the India Office fully agreed with the proviso to which Mr. Bend el had referred, to which they attached great importance. As regards the conditions to be laid down, he tnought that it would be well to give the Company a fairly clear idea of the nature of the safeguards, etc., which His Majesty x s Government would be likely to require when we informed them next week of our comments on the revised draft agreement generally. It was obviously essential that they should have this information before they concluded any agreement with the Sheikh, even if such an agreement covered commercial points only and contained the proviso which had been discussed. It would not be overlooked that the A.P.O.C. could not conclude any agreement with the Sheikh without the approval of the I.P.C, and that it might well be that safeguards such as we had in view mi grit b e o f gr eat i mp or t ance f r orn t h e I.P.C. s t andp o i nt. Mr. Starling said that we must take care that the minimum safeguards ere. which we might prescribe, should not be such as to be impossible for the A.P.O.C. acting as they would be on behalf of the I.P.O. to accept. We must not overlook that, whatever the justification for theip, ix tne conditions laid down by H.M.G. were too stiff, the I.P.C. might oe unwilling to take up, or to proceed with negotiations for, a concession, ana if they were themselves unwilling to take it up a position might arise where the A.P.O.C. could not take it up independently. If that happened we might find ourselves confronted immediately with the Standard Oil of California* He drew attention to the general principles which had been laid down by the Cabinet to govern/1 3. govern tiie grant of oil concessions in British territory and the conditions to he satisfied in the case of such concessions. The most important of these vjere: (1) Registration in British territory; (2) Majority of Employees and if possible Managing Director to he British subjects; (3) 50% of produce to be refined on British territory, and the oil to be suitable for Admiralty use; (4) Pre-emption in time of v?ar. Air. Laithviaite pointed out that the decision in question had had in view British territory only. Qatar was not British territory, nor a British Protectorate. It was an independent Arab State in special treaty relations with H.M.G. The view that the Cabinet decision referred to did not cover the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Persian Gulx, had consistently been held by the India Office in the inter departmental discussions which had taken place in connecuion Ys ! ith the Koweit oil concession. Mr. Rendel agreed and suggested that it had ceen accepted at the time of the assignment to American interest of the Bahrein oil concession that oil concessions to be granted in the Arab Sheikhdoms in the Persian Gulf must be dealt with separately and on their merits. Iu would be necessary to consider in the case of Qatar whether the conditions laid down by the Cabinet to apply in the case of concessions in British territory or more stringent conditions, and if so was z , ^nouj-d Air. Starling/Mr.Starling , reverting to his previous renarks, enquired whether, if we sc stiffened up cur conditions that the I.P.C. dropped out, we should feel quite sure that we could impose the same conditions on an American Company, e.g. the Standard Oil Company of California. Hr.laithwaite said that he thought our general view was that such conditions as may he laid down should apply to any Company, whether British or foreign. The two important points were control and exploitation; and it would have to he decided what our minimum requirements in respect cf them were to he. If H.M.G. decided to lay down the principle that both control and exploitation must he British, whatever might he the nationality of the Company ultimately controlling the concession, and we couud secure acceptance cf these terms fr cm any concessionaire, so much the better. If it proved impossible in practice to go so far, and to secure effective British control, tnen we ought as a minimum to require tnat — ocsi representation and exploitation should he in British nanas. $e could make a good ca,se for this on the ground o- the s^scj-aj. local political difficulties of qatar, where we should he dealing with a State with ill-defined boundaries, a backward and scattered population, hitherto little m toucn with the outside world, and not easily suscepticle to pressure by H.M.G. The Sheikh was precluded by his treaty engagements from dealings with rcreign powers engagements to which it was regarded as desirable to hold him. If foreign subjects were massacrea in qatar by a tribal uprising or the like, responsibility for securing effective punishment would thus fall on H.M.G., ana neve as in dealing with air procedure we might reasonably ta^e the line that while we were prepared to face certair. political/political difficulties where our own nations-ls were concerned, we were not prepared to in the case of foreigners. On the face of it, too, we had a good answer to any American complaint that such conditions represented a refusal to maintain an open door policy in oil matters in the Gulf. The Trucial Coast was closed to all concession hunters, whether British or foreign. The Bahrein oil concession had already 'been reassigned, with our approval, to American interests; and the latest information was that in Koweit, in which American interests had been allowed full liberty to compete, we should in future be dealing with an Anglo-American combine. Our excuse for restricting exploitation in 9,a,tar to British personnel would be the special political difficulties presented by that area. Mr.Starling said that it was relevant, so far as the nationality of exploiting personnel was concerned, that Ibn Baud had agreed that the concession granted in Hasa to the Standard Oil of California should be operated by American personnel. Mr.Kendel said that the question of nationality 01 the exploiting personnel and of the safeguards would clearly have to be considered separately, out frcm tne Foreign Office standpoint it would be easier to impose tercs in respect of these on the I.P.C. than on a purely American Company, such as the Standard Oil Company. Mr. Seal said that the question of safeguards for pre-emption would probably be regarded as more important from the Admiralty standpoint if the ^atar concession were to go to a U.S.Company than if it went to the x.^.C. The fact to be faced was that the Admiralty must have the oil in War, and if the Company were American certain diplomatic difficulties might arise which would be very much/much more easily handled if the agreement provided for preemption. ^■ r • L aithwaht e said that the A.P. O.C. had been warned in the meeting on 14th December that in the event of their failing to secure the c one essi on, or of competing interests entering the field, H.M.G. must not be regarded as permanently committed to approval of whatever terms they might in present conditions think suitable in the case of the A.P. O.C. We could if necessary endeavour to make special provision in such circumstances for pre-emption. Mr.Rendel regarded it as of great importance that any conditions made by H.M.G. regarding safeguards, British control, pre-emption etc., should be of universal application. He thought that if we demanded certain conditions from the A.P.O.C. or I.P.C., but demanded different or stiffer conditions from a purely u.S. Company, our international position would be much more diflicult, since the U.S.Government would certainly accuse us of differentiation. If, on the other hand, we could work out conditions which would be applicable universally - quite irrespective of the nationality of the concessionary Company and could be defended on merits in view of the political situation, our hands would be much strengthened in dealing with possible eventual representations of the U.S. or any other foreign G overrunent. Mr♦Laithwaite expressed agreement as regards the importance of making our conditions universally applicable. He asked what importance was attached to a special safeguard for refin locally ? Hr.Rendel said he had the impression that the A.?.O.C.would object to being required to refine in .,,atar. Mr. Starling suggested that they might be asked to agree to refine in Qatar or in British territory, and this was agreed. After further discussion it was agreed ,subject to the approval of higher authority, (a) to accept in principle the procedure suggested at the opening of the meeting; (b) that a letter (to be concurred in by the Departments concerned)V \ V ‘ w V 12 . concerned) sh.ould oe sent 'by th.e India Office to Mr.Hearn in tiie coarse -ext week, suggesting in the first place the adoption ^of tne procedure which had been discussed as between the Sheikh and tne C anpany, and the Company and secondly, recording the points on which agreement had been reached or which had been raised cut not disposed of in the discussions with Mr. Fraser and Mr.Hearn on 14th December; thirdly, indicating in general terms the nature of the points (including safeguards &amp;c. ) which H.M.G. would desire to see cowered in the proposed subsidiary agreement between the Company and themselves. It would be desirable, in dealing with this last point, not to intimate a dec i si on to the C anpany. The points in question were controversial and - the risk apart of deterring the A.P.C.C. from proceeding with negotiations if they were stated in too categorical terms at this stage - it might be some time before H.M.G. had themselves reached decisions on them. It would probably therefore be preferable to indicate them in outline and say that a more detailed statement would follow; that we should be prepared to discuss them further with the Company if necessary later, but that in the interest of clearing the ground for their commercial negotiations with the Sheikh, we thought it undesirable to postpone ccmmunication of our comment on the draft agreement and on the question of procedure until the special desiderata 01 H.M.G. had been more fully elaborated. B. Amendments in Revised Draft C oncess_i o ri_._ The meeting then considered and approved the amendments which had been provisionally agreed or raised on 14th December with Mr. Fraser and Mr.nearn iu the articles of the revised draft other than Article 12 , and reached agreement as to the supplementary points to be raised with the A.P.C.C. on the articles in question. (These are set out in the enclosure to the draft letter to/13. to the Company attached). Subject to their acceptance and to a satisfactory solution of the problems raised oy .article Lo, the meeting agreed that the revised draft concession which had been submitted by the A.P.O.C. was generally suitable. /N.3. It may be recorded that a point raised for the lirst time in connection with the draft agreement which gave rise to considerable discussion was that of the definition of the Sheikh ? s dominions in article 2 (c). The Southern and Western frontier of Qatar is at present somewhat indeterminate. At the same time it is important that there should be no risk of Ibn Saud being given an opportunity to call in question the line established by the unratified nnglo Turkish Convention of 29th July, 1913, i.e. a line running from the coast just east of Uqair due South to parallel 20 North, on the Eastern boundary of Ncjd. If a map is attached to, or a definition included in, the concession, it will be necessary either to include in or to omit from Qatar as shown on the map or in the definition the territory between the various frontiers of Qatar as described in the Political Resident f s .Despatch No. 41 of 24th Juno, 1933, to the Colonial Office,(P.Z.4642/33) and the 1913 iuiglc Turkish lino, and this would inevitably lead to friction and controversy, particularly in view of the fact that the Standard Oil Company of California are now operatin'' on the Hasa Coast. It was agreed therefore that it would he better to omit the map from the concession and to leave the definition as vague as possible, at any rate penning the further report on the whole question which is awaited from the Political -ucsident in th.. Persian juIi. Ihc position could be frankly explained to the A.P.O.O^/ 0./°* connected rnja^t-inn g , Tii^ meeting than turned to consider Article 12 and the queot^orio aiising out of it. it was agreed that these were; (s.) B r i t i sh c on t r04 (b) Position ana nationality of Chief Local he presentative; (c) Nationality of exploiting personnel; U) pre-emption ana refining arrangements. The discussion on points (b), (c) ana (a) may be briefly suiuiiurised as follows;- .ef^f0n anu nationa1ity 0f Qnjex ^ocal heoresenta tive. ’ It was v^iy important, particularly so long as there was no resiaent Political Officer, that he should (as in Bail re in) he a British suoject who se appointment should tn cppioved by H.k,G.,aod that he should he persona grata tc ii.ivhG. It would he desirable also that if and when a Political agent was appointed, transactions between the Company and the Sheikh should he dealt with through the Political Agenu* ihe Company haa suggested that it might c?a sier to secure our desiderata under this head if we expressed them as a wish rather than a demand. But the point seemed too important to leave open in this way. (c) Nationalit:/ of employees . The case on merits for requiring that, whatever the ultimate control ana nationality of any Company operating an oil concession in Qatar, local exploitation (and representation) should in present conditions he wholly British, had already been developed in the discussions above on procedure. It was agreed that a ruling would have to he sought on the difficult points it raised, pending which we could not commit ourselves to it as a sine qua non in writing to the Company: hut that our lette should refer in general terms to the probability of such a requirement. LilZPre-emption ana Local It /vas agreed tnat an understanding as to tne right 0x x-ueiupoion in time of war was desirable and that uixs should oe indicated to Hie Company. As regards iefining they should oe informed tnat it was regarded as important that oil won should he refined either in ^atar or in British territory ana that: they should he asked j.or an assurance on this. The possibility of Karachi was mentioned. (a) British Control . The meeting considered the tentative redraft of Article 12 which haa been put forward by It. Hearn at the rm ting on 14 th December. The effect was to secure that any company to which the concession might be transferred would be a British Company, registered in Great Britain, Having i^s principal place of easiness in Great Britain, and with a British subject at all times as Chairman, but to give any such company the right to form subsidiaries under its own control to work the concession which, while enjoying the rights ana accepting tne obligations of the parent company under the Agreement, would be unaer no re striction as regards nationality or British control. It was agreed that the first paragraph of the rearaft was unobjectionable so far as it went. The second paragraph was unobjectionable if tne words “except the engagements expressed in the final sentence of the preceding clause' were omitted.

Mr. handel pointed out in particular that if we coula secure our main desiderata by other means, it might well be baa tactics to insist on the strict application of the British c ontrol provisions to subsidiary companies - since this might only further complicate the already delicate position of the A.P.O.C* on the Board of the I.p.C. - while it would probably be possible in practice to secure by other means that subsidiary companies were unaer the adequate control of their parent companies. Questions connected with the registration and nationality of subsidiaries were often based on technical ana finaneial considerations regarding taxation etc. and it did not follow that the non- application of the British control provisions to subsidiaries would in fact mean that those subsidiaries would escape from British control. It was finally agreed that in the letter to be sent to the Company our desiderata should be indicated in general terms and that a door should be left open for the Company to come back, on the ground that it would be unfortunate if, on hearing what our desiderata were, they decided that it would be useless to proceed with their negotiations, secondly that while the terms to be used would require careful consideration we might hint that H.M.G. as at present advised would require British control ciauses/•18, clauses In respect of subsidiary pap-v ri - _ _ _ K coippanras ol tne nature i -^cdibd in sud- clause 1 of T v : r Ro.- y»-« + , ^ . ux x\jl . nearii s tentative redraft 0- uiay 1 ^, togetner with an unierstanding as to British exploitation and the position ol the Chief Local Representative, the right of preemption in time of war, ana tne refining of oil won either locally or in British t-r. itOxj.

The British Government were keen that the concession should be obtained by a British company (APOC) and not by the Americans (Standard Oil Company of California). The oil concession was granted to APOC in 1935.The papers include: discussion of policy by various British Government departments and officials (notably the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Trenchard Craven William Fowle; the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department; and the Foreign Office); the security of Qatar against raids from the Arabian interior; relations between Qatar and Ibn Saud [Abd al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd, King of Saudi Arabia]; the decision of the British Government to offer military protection to Qatar in exchange for the granting of the oil concession to APOC (including discussions by the Committee of Imperial Defence, and its Standing Official Sub-committee for Questions concerning the Middle East); the development of air facilities in Qatar as a means of protecting the state, including correspondence from the Air Ministry; discussion of the Qatar boundary; note of a conversation between the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Haji Williamson (folios 147-148); the surrender to the British Government of jurisdiction over British subjects, British-protected persons, and non-Muslim foreigners in Qatar; the recognition of Shaikh Hamad as successor to the Shaikh of Qatar; British opposition to a request by the Shaikh of Qatar for machine guns and armoured cars, because of the provocative effect this would have on Ibn Saud (folios 33-35); agreement that the 1916 treaty between the British Government and the Shaikh of Qatar should be binding on his heirs and successors; and the terms on which military protection was to be afforded by the British Government (folios 12-14).The papers also include correspondence between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.The papers include one item of an earlier date than the main date range: a copy of the 1916 treaty between the British Government and the Shaikh of Qatar (folios 451-452).The file includes a divider, which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Ministry</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Foreign and Political Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Qatar</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Arabian American Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>King of Saudi Arabia</namePart></name></subject><subject><geographic>Qatar</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Colonial policy</topic></subject><subject><topic>Concessions, Oil, Qatar</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x00016f#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
