It will be observed that the promotion of the Assistant Cotimandant of Police at Kerbela has been suspended for a year. 2. The sanctions taken in this matter have not been severe, but both the British Inspector-General of Constabulary and the Director-General of Police, whose sincerity is not in doubt, are convinced that the police officer in question erred through negligence rather than through malice and that the major part of Khan Sahib Quereish^s sufferings arose out of the execution of the instructions from the central authorities for his transference to Bagdad.

Enquiries carried out proved that this negligence was not directed against the Vice-Consul with bad intention but with goodwill. However, it has been decided to deprive the Assistant Commandant of Police from promotion for a period of one year from the date from which his promotion falls due. In this connection, the Ministry repeat their regret as to what has happened to Saiyid Tahir Hussain and hope that the esteemed Embassy are satisfied that the steps taicen in this behalf are sufficient to repel and punish the Assistant Commandant.

As regards his removal to Bagdad in a lorry at midnight on the 2/3rd May, 1941, it should be noted that that was the only means of transport available at the time as the military forces were in control of all other means of transport; while his removal at night was intended to avert exposing him to bombing from the air by day. As regards his search, this was undertaken by an Assistant Commandant of Police, and an inventory was prepared of the documents and money found on him, in accordance with the procedure followed upon the arrest and placing in custody of an individual. As regards his having been kept without food, enquiries are still in progress with a view to tracing and punishing the official who was guilty of failure in this connexion. His Excellency Sir Kinahan Cornwallis, K.C.M.G., C.B.E., D.S.O., His Britannic Majesty’s Ambassador, ,Jewish to express my own personal regret together, with the deep regret of the Iraqi authorities concerned /for Bagdad.for what has happened to this consular officer.

I note that enquiries are being pursued in the matter of the failure to provide the Vice-Consul with food, and shall be glad to be informed in due course of the result of these investigations. 2. At the same time I desire to place on record my dissent from the thesis advanced in Youf Excellency’s note that the high officials who were directly responsible for the treatment of this consular officer as though he had been a common criminal can be excused their improper conduct on the grounds that orders had been issued at the time for the arrest of all British subjects. In this connexion it is pertinent to remark that of the many British subjects resident in Kerbala a considerable proportion were in fact not arrested and certainly none was subsequently handled by the authorities in so reprehensible a manner.

Xhan Sahib Taher Hussain Quraishi was appointed Protector of Pilgrims in Baghdad in 1928 and in 1939 became British (Indian) Vice- Consul f During the recent disturbances in Iraq he was arrested when on his normal monthly visit to Kerbala for the purpose of disbursing the pensions payable to British Indians resident there. He was ceLained in considerable discomfort and the contents of his suitcase and pockets rifled. Removed to Baghdad in the small hours of the morning he was detained there at the Police Training School, but was given the first food he had had for 21 hours. In spite of representations to the Chief of Police he was confined in the Training School for four days and then transferred to an 'internment camp' in Baghdad West. His Majesty’s Minister, has addressed a note to the Iraqi Minister for Foreign Affairs,and the Foreign Office propose that he should be instructed to ask for an official apology suitable for transmission to the Vice-Consul;and to press for a refund in respect of^material losses sustained by the Vice-Consul and of the official moneys belonging to the Government of India which were in his possession. / ‘ ' ‘ tH.

CLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S LETTER date r^oeiv^d DATE 55- 25- 3 date 25 - 3 3 1-3-1939A Sir, (W j British Consulate, Bagdad. torch 7, 1939. I have the honour to refer to Sir Francis Humphry’s ^ despatch No«42/6/34 of the 7th March, 1934, addressed to His 3^ Excellency the Viceroy of India, relative to the proposed appointment of an Indian Vice Consul at Bagdad, and to request that the Grovemment of India may now be moved to appoint Khan Sahib Taher Hussain Quraishi, Pilgrims Officer at this Consulate, to be Indian Vice Consul, Bagdad. 2. I am aware that my predecessor, whose views are quoted in Sir Francis Humphrys’ despatch under reference, had some doubts about Mr.Quraishi’s sulBtability at that time for the post of Vice Consul and about the increase in his influence and standing with the local authorities which might result from an alteration of title. He was, however, prepared to recommend as valuable in the case of a new incumbent the higher status implied by the desigmtion ’’Vice Consul”. 3. When assuming charge of this post in December, 1937, I inherited various petitions and recommendations on this subject, which my predecessor had left over for my consideration; and I have purposely delayed any action thereon until now, in order to be able to judge &amp;he merits of the case in the light of my own experience. I have no hesitation in expressing the opinion that Khan Sahib Taher Hussain Qurashi possesses the qualifications of character, experience and conscientious devotion to duty justifying the attribution of a higher status. 4. His most important duties, outside the range of his immediate functions as Pilgrims Officer, are Ithose connected with the payment of Covernment of India pensions, with the administration of Indian estates and with the supervision, under myself, of the distribution of the Oudh Bequest. 5. In the latter capacity, he has particularly onerous responsibilities and is, ex officio , an obejct of every conceivable pressure and attack. The designation of Vice Consul would serve to mark the confidence which I feel hehas deserved in his exercise of these functions and it would certainly help him in his day-to-day relations with the local authorities. To reserve this designation for his eventual successor would, in my opinion, be invidious and unjust. 6. I may, perhaps, be permitted to add that I consider the work of the Pilgrims Officer in Bagdad to be not less arduous dr less responsible than that of the Indian Vice Consul at Jeddah, a post of which I have some experience. 7. I am anxious not to prejudice the prospects of favour able consideration for this proposal in India by making any simultaneous recommendation for an increase of salary for Khan Sahib Ifoher Hussain Quraishi. I would not wish, however, to be debarred from making representations in this sense at some later date, whether the conversion of the post of Pilgrims Officer, Bagdad, into that of Indian Vice Consul be approved or not. The Khan Sahib reached in December, 1934 the maximum of the gradeiRs.315-15-405) given him in the late High Conraission, and his responsibi lities since the transfer of the Grovemment of India Agency work to this Consulate early in 1933 have increased far beyond anything envisaged when his grade was established.

F.30(2)-3/33 dated the 29th of January last addressed to me by the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India on the subject of the proposed appointment of an Indian Vice- Consul at Bagdad, the contents of which have had my serious attention. 2. I note with regret that the only appointment in India which could be offered to T r. ^uraishi, the presant Protector of Pilgrims attached to the office of'Kis Majesty’s Consul at Bagdad, is one carrying a salary much inferior to that he is now receiving (Rs.7 5 - 150 as compared with Rs.315 - 405) ; and 1 do no t consider that the offer of such a post is in any v/ay corunensurate with Hr. juraishi f s past services. 3. It will be remembered that in my despatch Ho.45 of the 5th September last, I expressed the opinion that Mr. $uraishi, no doubt on account of his comparative youth, did not possess the requisite strength of character to deal firmly and impartially with the problems of the Cudh Bequest distribution, and was on that account unsuitable . for the post of Vice-Consul. I am informed by His Majesty’s Consul, under whose supervision Hr. ^uraishi has now been working for about fifteen months, that he has of late shown marked improvement in the performance of his duties, particularly in regard to the Cudh Bequest distributions, which are now proceeding quite satisfactorily.

In the case of a new incumbent, however, the higher status implied by the designation 'Vice-Consul* would be of value. 6. I have therefore the honour to suggest that no further steps be taken for the present towardsthe appointment of an Indian Vice-Consul at Bagdad, and that Vr. ^uraishi be retained here in the office of the Protector of Pilgrims* I should be grateful, however, if the Government of India would regard the proposal to appoint a Vice-Consul as being in suspense, not cancelled, and would address to me a further comnunleation should a post in India more fitted to Hr. ^uraishi f s deserts become at any time available, and should a candidate possessing un questionably superior qualifications for the appoint-INDEXED No. N.30(2)-E/33. ■prom The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India» / *V To The Under Secretary of State for India, India Office, London* Dated Hew Delhi, the February 1934.

His Majesty's High Commissioner for Iraq has also proposed that, as is the case at Jedda, the superintending consular officer at Bagdad, should have the assistance of an Indian Vi ce Consul whose especial duties would be to deal with the additional work occasioned by the pilgrimage of British Indians to the Moslem Holy Cities. Sir John Simon understands that this matter has engaged the attention of the Government of India for some time past and that an Indian Protector of Pilgrims was appointed on the 1st December, 1928 and paid from Indian Revenues, to work under the direction of the Consular Secretary to the Residency at Bagdad.

In these circumstances it is suggested that it would be a more equitable arrangement if all supplies of stationery required by the Protector were made directly by the Stationery Office on a repayment basis and the cost of the stationery actually supplied recovered from the Government of India by this Department. If the India Office agrees to this proposal it is suggested that the revised arrangements should take effect as from 1st October 1937. The cost of stationery supplied to the Protector during the period 1st October 1937 to 3lst March 1938 amounted to approximately £4. I am etc., (Signed) N.G.

No. 29. British Consulate, Bagdad. 19th March, 1934. Sir, I have the honour to inform you that I have recently had under consideration the question of the supply of stationery and office requisites used hy the Protector of Pilgrims and his staff working under % my supervision. 2. The system at present in force is that the stationery used in the Protector of Pilgrims’ office is purchased locally, the actual cost 'being debited to the G-overnment of India. The Protector of Pilgrims does not, however, sign official communications: these are invariably issued over my signature. 3. I consider it desirable in the circumstances that stationery of uniform size and quality, as supplied by His Majesty’s Stationery Office, should be used at this post. The quantity of paper and envelopes used for communications to or on behalf of the Government of India is, however, not inconsiderable, and it would not be inequitable to call upon that Government to make sane contribution towards the cost thereof. The budget of the Protector of Pilgrims contains provision for an expenditure of ’Iraq dinars 18/750 on stationery during the financial year ending on March 31st, and this sum is likely to be slightly f exceeded. Allowing for the higher cost of local supplies, I am of opinion that that contribution might be His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State 26 28 JUNi m for Foreign Affaire, Foreign Office, S.4.1 .1IO? be fixed at 1 Iraq dinars eighteen per annum, which sum should, I suggest, be credited to your Department in my current accounts, 4.

It has been ascertained semi-officially that the Treasury would be prepared to agree to the proposal on the basis-of a payment of £18 per annum, subject to review at the end of three years, and if the India Office agree to the proposal it is assumed that arrangements will be made by which the India Office payments to the Foreign Office will be credited to the Stationery Office Vote. For the purposes of the review, demands on the Stationery Office for supplies to the Protector should be endorsed accordingly and the Consul should be asked to keep an approximate record of any issues he may make to the Protector from the Consulate store.
