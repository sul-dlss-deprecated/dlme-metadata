(Brief resume of full summary prepared on 10 Co23 of infoxmiation received since October 1922) . Towards the end of 1922 and in January 1923 anti-British propaganda with regard to Iraq was carried on by a email group of agitators including malcontents recently arrived in Persia from Iraq, Objectionable literature was interchanged between Tehran and Iraq but its circulation led to no very serious consequences and there has since been no revival of agitation. Turkish attempts to win over the tribes of Kurdistan have met with inconsiderable successr, A few reports only on this subject have been included in the summary, 3, With regard to Persia itself the position v/as well stated by Jevad Pasha the Turkish General Officer Commanding on the Jasireh front when, about the end of February, he reported to Angora that it was almost impossible to create a strong pro-Turk nationalist movement in Persia where there was no enthusiasm for the pan-Islemic idea© 4.

The Flkr-l-Azad of 15.11.22. published an anti-British accoimt of an interview with 5. Muhammad Khalisi. In January a printed document in Persianover the seal of Muhammad ai Khalisi was circulated in Baghdad, copies having been posted from Teheran^ It reached the hands of the King against whom it brought charges of subservience to the British and of having at the instigation of these enemies* drawn the sword against the leaders of the faithful and permitted the holy lands to be overrun by infidels. It declared that the Arabs would not accept the Anglo-Iraq Treaty.

The same oody was doubtless responsible for a protest signed 'The High Representatives of Iraq' addressed to 'The High Consul of Great Britain in Iraq' accusing Britain of breach of faith and of having subjected Iraq to unbearable tyranny. On the 24th January His Britannic Majesty* s Minister reported that pamphlets protesting against the British mandate for Iraq had been sent by priests of the lower order from Iraq to Tehran and had been read out in the Medjliss where d etestation of the British had been expressed. The High Council mentioned above had telegraphed violent protests to Europe but their influence was confined to a small group of agitators and could be ignored. Section IV.Pan^slataic and Turkish T)rot&gt;au?anda _in Per3ig.o On the 14th December 1922 the British Military Attxche at Teheran reported the existence in Teheran of a group of political agitators working under the guidance of the authorities at Angora to promote sympathy for the Turks, to assist the anti-British movement in Iraq and to spread pan-lslamic and anti-British propaganda. They had formed two committees for Mesopotamian and Turkish affairso These had amalgamated into one Committee which had an organised but not very satisfactory system of communication with revolutionary organisations in Iraq and India, The Committee had had few dealings with the Russians, Action had been taken Toy the Persian authorities against some members of the Committee and the results attained by the Committee had been practically negligible# There have since been no developments of importance and striking evidence of the non-existence of pro Turkish oi pan-Islamic zeal in Persia is available in the sha^e of a report dated 13,3*23, This stated that Jevad Pasha had recently reported to Angora that too much confidante should not be placed in either tha Persian Government or the Nationalist elements, both being unreliable.
