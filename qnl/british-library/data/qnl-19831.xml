From— L ieutenant -C olonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. At the conclusion of my letter No. 87 of the 8th of January, on the subiect of the Dehai incident,* I stated that I should shortly be visiting ihe Trucial Coast again in connection with the Abu Musa case, and would then have an opportunity of gauging the effect of recent events on the public .mind. *1 have since carried out the visit and now beg to lay the tollowing before the Government of India. 2. On the coast generally I found conditions perfectly normal and the untoward incident at Debaf appears to have had no harmful reaction on the rulers or the inhabitants of the other principalities. Tlje Shaikhs themselves were a o usual principally concerned with their own individual interests and wSnts and if they did take the trouble to make any enquiries from me regarding Debai affairs it was with an air of deference and detachment. They would ask, ^for instance : Did Government intend to appoint a British officer for the coaist ? When ^vas the telegraph station to be installed ? and so on. ^ 3. At Debai itself, outwardly and commercially, the position appeared to be quite normal. When I landed the usual friendly or curious crowd was collected on the beach, and the life of the port seemed to be pursuing the ev&lt;3u tenour of its way; one heavily laden steamer had just discharged cargo, and left: another was discharging during my sojourn, and the British India Steam Navigation Co.'s Agent at Lingah informed me a day or two later of tbe fact that the Company's steamers were at present taking more car^o to Debai than usual. The community of petty Persian traders, who, subsequent to the visit of the Admiral and myself, had temporarily betaken themselves to Lingah and Bandar Abbas,—after sending a mendacious round robin to various vernacular papers,—had all returned and were again plvin 0, their accustomed callings. The British Indians, too, seemed to have quite forgotten the events of two months aso and were solely concerned with the settlement of their petty commercial claims. The only concrete vestige of the recent outbreak lav in the fact that the relations of the List Shaikh of Debai, Makhtooin bin Hashar, who have always been a thorn in the side of the present ruler, and who had openly attributed the trouble with His Maiesty's ship to the ineptitude of Shaikh Butti's rule and averred that it could never have happened under the regime of their deceased kinsman, still remained in camp at an oasis 7 or 8 miles inland. They were, however, ex pected to return after my visit, and I have no doubt have done so ere this. Meanwhile, their presence can well be spared. So much for the general situation at Debai. 4. The attitude of the Chief himself. The main difficulty throughout has been the unreliable personality and self -satisfied incompetence of Shaikh Butti bin Sohail. I do not think that in the abstract he has any wish to be otherwise than on cordial terms with Government and their representative, but provided always that he be left alone to enioy what fevenue falls in his way and be not asked to take any tiresome measures to prevent his subjects conducting themselves in any truculeut way they please. If he is asked to take any action at all inconvenient to himself or to assert his authority as ruler in any particular manner, he has always failed to do so except under the strongest pressure. As an indication of his natural attitude of mind I may quote the following recent instance : As the Government of India are aware, it was the inauguration of the oppressive Persian tariff of 1903 in the Persian ports which made it possible for Debai to supplant Lingah as a distributing centre of merchandise for the Arab coast. This was facilitated by the intelligent policy of the late ruler, Shaikh Makhtoom, who made Debai a free port as tar as customs duty was concerned and contented himself with the levy of a warehouse or wharfage feeon each package landed. During the last few years the imports have continued to increase and the primitive accommodation provided lias gradually become quite inadequate,—specially covered accommodation,—and this has been a frequent source of complaint from British traders at Debai. During the past winter, which has been an abnormally wet and stormj one, a great deal of damage has thus accrued to perishable cargo lying on the wharf, and to mitigate this the drainage of the floor and the provision of more roofing has become an urgent necessity. On my recent visit I was asked to exert influence with the Shaikh to induce him to meet the merchants' wishes in this-,respect and was assured by the traders that all they wanted could be donG for 800 or 400 rupees, but that the Shaikh could not be got to go to the expense. When I pressed tiie matter upon the Shaikh his first rejoinder w^s to the following effect:— ' The rocffed accommodation which I have provided is quite sufficient for tiie Debai cargo. It is true that I take warehouse fees on all packages, but I see no reason why I should spend money on the preservation of cargo which is intended for distribution to other ports. I do not want such cargo here and if traders choose to bring it that is their look out After a good deal of discussion he ultimately promised me to comply with the representations of the traders in such a way as to remove their grounds of complaint, but it remains to be seen whether he will carry out his promise without further pressure. 1 must apologise for this diverson, but it supplies a useful illustration of the type of character with which one is dealing. 5. The appointment of a British Agent. The only apparent and specific outcome of the recent events is that the Shaikh has been astute enough to make use of the ' Hyacinth' incident- as a pretext for a professed inability to answer for the safety of a European at Debai and thus indirectly to suggest to us that the appointment of any British official, whether for political or telegraph work, is not feasible for the present. Thus when just before my visit the British India Company, in the ordinary course of routine, sent a Eurasian employe to relieve the Persian, who was acting as their Agent at Debai, the Shaikh, who had received early information of his coming from the Persian .whom he was intended to replace, had him met on board with a civil letter to the effect that, owing to the resentment still felt by tiie inhabitants who had lost relations in the recent fight, he was unable for the present to ensure the safety of any European ?nd there fore could not allow him to land. It is of course conceivable that the Shaikh's statement might have some foundation, but judging from what I saw and heard myself a few days later 1 cannot help thinking that his professed apprehensions were not altogether bona fide and that he is simply making use of the incident of 24th December, in order to bring about a post ponement of the appointment of the European whom he thought Government might contemplate sending, either to take charge of the existing Agency or to manage the Telegraph Station. 6 Recent happenings have at all events placed beyond doubt what I always to some extent apprehended, namely, that the Shaikh of Debai does not welcome the idea of closer British supervision over the Trucial Coast, and that this sentiment is probably shared by the other Shaikhs. It is naturallv a difficult one for the latter to express frankly to the representative of Govern ment, especially having regard to the considerations on which it is based, but the Shaikh of Debai, seeing that the ' Hyacinth ' incident has provided him with a useful indirect peg on which to air the sentiment, is making the most of the opening afforded him. The grounds underlying it were adumbrated in my telegram No. 115, dated the 3rd March 1909, and are not far to seek. They are undoubtedly based on the fear that whereas at present we are represented by an Arab Native Agent, who, by long residence on their coast and intermarriage with the daughters of the community, has become more or less a member of it; on the other hand, if a British officer were appointed with a more portentious house and flagstaff, the institution would become an ever present reminder to the negro diving fraternity that in the case of realor,Tiression th?y had a ready refuge at hand; with the result that generally speaking the treatment, by the Arab element, of this oppressed class would have to undergo nipelioration. 7 Ten yeurs ago our position on the Trucial Coast was specifically taken into review by the Government of India, and, in the course of the correspondence which then ensued, my predecessor wrote on the 12th December 1902 «For all practical and necessary purposes the Trucial Chiefs may be pomidered to be under our protection and there is no necessity to make this protectorate more formal unless and until future developments in the Gulf make it advisable'. , , . „ n j In the decade which has since passed there have undoubtedly been a good many developments, and, while all around them the maritime communities have made some measure of progress in the direction of civilization, tlie 1 racial Chiefs have practically stood still. There has been no want of effort on the rvn-t of the representative of Government to cultivate and keep in touch with l\ Shaikhs and I personally have been afforded much better opportunities ban my predecessors for doing so. For whereas formerly the personal oaonciation of the Resident with them was as a rule limited to one formal t rt irine the year, my own visits have been very much more frequent. T hive made two extensive land journeys at different times through their WM-land and have had to visit the coast frequently in connection with the collection of material for the Gulf Gazetteer. I know them all well Wlividuallv and in 'questions of succession, and internal politics they olpm to be no less ready than of old to look to the Resident for arbitration in tW disputes and difficulties, and to accept his decisions. But so far as their external relations are concerned and the display of any inclination on their ^rt to-move with the times, I regret that I can see no change at all. They remain in 'the same condition of bigoted ignorance as they did ten years ago and show not the least inclination to emerge from it. « To revert for a few moments to past events. The Government of Tnrlbt are aware that Mr. New was appointed Vice-Consul at Lingah with that we should he able to use him also for occasional sojourns at tTu.; nnd thus make a heginninir for a better order of things. Although I entirely free frommisgiving, I was hopeful when I addressed Govern. ™Hn November that if I took Mr. New down to Debai in the ' Lawrence T tnved there a few days until he bad had time to get on terms with the Iwvh I should be able to induce the latter to make him welcome there for neriod and that this would prepare the way for regular periodical sojourn. a When the attack on the landing party of H.M.S. ' Hyacinth' was 1,1 Ml mv hones in this direction were upset, and it seemed to me either that theidea of bringing about better representation on the coast must be Wished altogether lor a long time to come, or else that the British officer \ tailed as an item of the measures taken by us in connection with must be i ^ ^ blue -jackets. The Government of India considered the i ff I Zurw out of the question, and meanwhile, as was inevitable in any case, latter ton - ^ tl)0 sub j eet o£ much or g a ni S ed misrepresent- the inciue e Turkish and vernacular press, and we seem f i^hM removed than ever from the certainty of being able to instal a British tuitner re f r iendlv means. Moreover as far as Uebai is concerned, and representa • j fear that t|ie sarae considerations will hold, so far as they amlly in regard to the project for the installation of a wireless telegraph station. co nnection I would observe that even if it, were not indispensi- ,, M i fl,„ rlerk in charge of the wireless should be an Englishman, a station ij'^ alllW be in!iu&lt;'iiratpd without a flag to cover it or a guard to p-.otect it, C0 ^ um? existing conditions, sceptical as I am of the bona fides of the Shaikh's and under ex ° doubt w | ietih er it would be wise to attempt to carry the apprenensio . out the disol . et j on a , 1( l wherewithal to use measuie thro g ^ case [ gather {r o m Uis Excellency the Commander- • 'cM-f-that even if the wireless station for Debai receives early sanction.there will he no question of its erection before the beginning of next cold 'weather, so that we have several months before us in which to watch the situation. „ „ « 10. In the meantime, I trust the Government of India will be pleased to take into their wise consideration the whole question of our relations with these Chiefs and the policy which we can best adopt towards them henceforward. I venture to express the personal view that, although many inconveniences will doubtless be attendant upon a tightening of our present easy control over them, the march of events and the developments of the general political outlook in the Gulf region make it advisable, and in any case will ultimately oblige us to take definite action in that direction. Already foreign merchants, e.g., Messrs. Wonckhaus, the German firm, Messrs. Rosenthal, the French pearl dealers, and our own subjects Messrs. Gray Paul &amp; Co. have either sent or desired to send European representatives to embark in the trade of the Trucial Coast; yet at present the Government of India, and the ResuJent as their representative with the Trucial Shaikhs, possess inadequate constitutional and legal equipment for the exercise oi functions which they may at^ny time be called upon to perform. ^ In this connection the enaction of a simple Order in Council would now seem called for. 11. But while, on the one hand, the disinclination of the Trucial Shaikhs to be subjected to any closer British supervision than that which they now eI W' su ^ er f 10m , is largely based on ignorance and on considerations which will not stand the test of examination by the light of present day civili sation;^ and while, owipg to the increasing intensity of that light, our credit as a civilised Government will ultimately oblige us to make our supervision more exacting; yet, on the other hand, we shall doubtless wish to put ourselves, as far as we can, in the shoes of the rulers of these benighted principalities and regard with what sympathy we may their fear of the search-light. At any rate we need to make the process of evolution as easy for them as we can and to let it operate in the way calculated to draw upon ourselves the minimum amount of resentment and unpopularity. As far as I can see at present and havin'- regard to the unreliability of the present Shaikh, any proposal that might be made in the near future for the location of a British officer at Debai, even as a periodical sojourner, will probably be met with opposition, real or engineered and I fear there will be no greater certainty of putting the measure^through by purely amicable means than there was in December last, and that the installation of a telegraph station at Debai with European staff will be a little-less delicate operation. 12 In these circumstances, it occurs to me that the little enclave of Zora, between Ajman and Jdamriyeh, may be considered to otfer us a convenient base and more simple means for the location of our telegraph station and the insertion of the wedge of more effective control. f lhe situation and history of the Zora tract will be found described in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Its occupation has always been such an apple of discord among the Shaikhs themselves that we have been^rbliged to prohibit such occupation. Its position is central, and it possesses a good^Khor on the Ajman side for the use of native craft; while an anchorage could probablv be found at some point off it, which would be no worse than those existing at other ports along that const. On shore we should start with a spacious ancTun- obstructed tract of ground and it seems conceivable that if we were to make the place a free port for the import of merchandise for distribution, we might gradually gather round us a community of peaceful Indian and Arab traders and that the place under our aegis might thus become a convenient centre for the spread of inlluence and civilisation, by example and contact, rather than by any sterner measures. The start would be made by the landing and installation of the staff and guard tor the wireless station, with their gear and the necessary E. P. tents for their accommodation at the beginning' of the cold weather. At the moment of their disembarkation the Shaikhs of Ajman and Hamriveh ' in the first instance, and then the Trucial Shaikhs generally, would 'be ' notifiedpersonally that, in order that the telegraph system might interfere as little as possible with their sensibilities or the populations of their towns, we had decided to locate i-t at Zora, and required tor it from all of them the respect and protectioR to which it was entitled under treaty. Once out telegraph station was installed the rest would gradually follow, automatically, and we should thus be rendered quite independent of the co-operation or opposition of the Shaikh of Debai and his community. The Government of India may perhaps think the idea a visionary one, hut it'seems to me to possess convenient possibilities, and I submit it respect fully for consideration. It will of course be understood that, in the foregoing paragraph, I have merely indicated very roughly the line on which I think we mi-ht proceed, and it goes without saying that should the suggestion commend itself to Government these lines would need to be carefully plotted out. With apologies for the length of this communication, of which I am sending a copy to His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, in that it has a bearing on the wireless question. i r Foreign Office Press~Noi 337^16*5'll—44.No 1202 E.A. From The Deputy Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. To Lieut-Co1one1 P«Z*Gox&gt; Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. Dated Simla, the 26th June 1911- 1 Sir, # I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No 1112 (Confidential) dated the 30th April 1911, dealing with the situation at Debai and the Truoial Coast. 2. The matter is under consideration, and will be shortly submitted for the orders of His Majesty's Government. With reference to the proposed introduction of an Order in Council for the Trucial Coast, I am to say that the Government of India as at present advised, are inclined to think that the question may suitably be postponed pending result of the negotiations between His Majesty^ Government and the Turkish Government for the adjustment of questions relating to the Persian Gulf. Meanwhile, however, I am to request that, with a view to save tljne should it eventually be decided to take the proposed action you will prepare and submit a draft of an Order in Council for ttie consideration of the Government of India. , I have etc, (Sd) E.H.S.Clarhe, Deputy Secretary to the Govt of India.■* Later on^J^.

It will be noticed from the precis that the views of the several Residents on the questio of jurisdiction are somewhat discordant.1 1 is maintained that we exercise jurisdiction on the Arab Coast, but that jurisdiction is^from a strictly legal point o r view, irrepular and arbitrary. Ue exercised similar jurisdiction in the Persian Coast and Islands before the present Order in Council was brought into force and it was to remedy the defect and the re- ^ i Some criminal and numerous Civil cases sultant in- arise at '&gt;he principal ports of Bushire Lingah and Bunder Abbas,and these cases must at all events be looked into; but it is none the less open to any accused or defendant to snap his fingers at a decision and leave an Assistant Resident' to report that endeavouring to dispose of cases without jurisdiction is rather embarrassing and liable to bring him in to contempt'.

The procedure was quite correct from th^ooQocimon law point of view but t] e Hheikh beingbeing unsophisticated would not 'have under stood the true inwardness of it. It was how- / ever in that case possible to execute the de- cree without the intervention of the Sheikh. If his help had been actually invoiced it wouljd have created a wronp: impression on his nind a to tks his powers and jurisdiction over Bri tish subjects and his relations vr ith the Pri- tish Government. This unsatisfactory s^tate of things requires an amelioration and that can only be brought about by an Order in Council.Ill OFFICE NOTE. P.R. Unlssa we are prepared to type out the whole of the Order, 1 doubt if we ahall be able to send anything to Government until printed copies of the Bahrein Draft reabhes us. The words ^Bahrein' and 'Political Agent' occur with fair regularity and would need altering throughout. The other main points for consideration seem to be:- (1) Definition of the 'Limit of the Order'* (2) Whether the native tribunals mentioned in the Bahrein Order -ffteo exist on the Trucial Coast or not. (3). The best means of enabling the Assistant Resldebt to act in conjunction with the various Sheikhs on the Trucial Coast. As regards (l) I put up the following Craft:- 'Excluding the possessions of the Sultan of Muscjat the Sheikh of Bahrein and the Sultan of Turkey, the limits of tlhis Order are the territories! 5 their hinterlands/o^ the Arab {Mcyfe-AMv Ittoral of lands/ cm UK JO the Tor a i an Oulf-including the territoriltlL^J^w^ thereof and any islets within those waters whiclh islands and waters are in this Order (except when the context requires a different construc tion) included in the expression Trucial Coast. It will be noted that this definition would allo^r of juijis- diction being exorcised in Katar if the necessity shoulc ever arise. An alternativo definition might be:- Excluding 5,260.3-105s OFFICE NOTE. IV 'Excluding such territories as fall within the limit^ of the Persian Coast and Islands Order in Council l^O^ the Muscat Order in Council, and the Ottoman Order in Council, the limits o^ th^bn Order are the territories \ t their hinterland^the Arab Coast literal of the Persian Gulf including the territorial waters thereof and any islets within those waters which islands and waters are in this Order (except when the context requires a different construction) in cluded in the expression Trucial Coastr As regards (2) I attach a note by E.A, There is apparently no 'kajlis-el-Urf' and the powers of the Residency Ageni are undefined and vague. Before anything definite can be drafted careful enquiries will I think be necessary regarding the actual procedure at present in force, which would also affect very consider ably point No 3 which it seems to me will be the most difficult to settle. At Bahrein the Political Afeent, The Sheikh and the liti-&gt; gants are all on the spot and it is thus a more or less simple matter to arrange the manner in which any particular case is to be tried. On the Trucial Coast however it wi |.l I should think be a very different matter. There are seyeral Sheikhs to deal and they are scattered over a consider able extent of territory. The Assistant Resident hinself will I take always be m 9£«£-3-9^ less a Court of Appeal, the 'original Court' being\i l (3 OFFICE NOTE. being either a 'Mejlia', a 'Salifah' or the w Kazl'. It will therefore be necessary to decide firstly whether the Assistant Resident's Court is always to be at some central place or whether he is to tour about and try cases on tit© spot as may be necessary. The latter it seems to me would be the most convenient ^or all parties and also a good way of bringing our representatives into touch with the Sheikhs There remains however the question of the 'original' Courts, The communications on the Trucial Coast being what they are I do not see how it will be possible/to follow the 'Bahrein Order' as regards members of the various coijirts being selected with the approval of the Assistant Resident wAtheMJt dEJluyiii^ liiiiBinQsii. Either it seems to me some sort of permanent court will have to be established at each port or selection of the members will have to be left t^) the Sheikh unless a native Agent is to be appointed as representative of the Assistant Resident with each Sheikh which presumably is not intended. I am afraid this note does not bring us much nearer jthe drafting of the new Order but our desire I take it is to stick to existing practice as much as possible and un til we know exactly what that is it is difficult to frapne suggestions. 3.200.3-1© P9/T• &lt; \ 'i N OF KICK NOTK. \&gt; F.A. We have no p.p. in orfice which will give in^^maV tion regsirding the formation and working of the Sal if eh, Majlis-el-Urf or the appointment, of Kazis. iiaji Abdul Rezak whom I consulted tells me that there is no Majlis-el-Urf at Shargah (or at any orf \he j f &lt; v ^\ s \ &gt; Trucial Coast; but there are Salifeh Counts which also A' attend to the cases which in Bahrein go before the Maj1i s-e1-Urf. V w The Salifeh has a permanent President selected b:/ tl^e Sheikh ^fith the concurrence of the native merchants. :iaj Abdul Rezak does not Imow for certain if our Agent has any voice in the selection of the President. The member frequently change. They are appointed by the parties concerned with the concurrence of the Sheikh and our Agent or by the latter two in consultation. The Resi dency Agent apparently does not take an active part in the deliberations of the Salifeh but it seems all decisions in which British subjects are concerned ear- only be enforced with his concurrence. There are Kazis in all the Trucial Coast towns. They are appointed by the Sheikhs with the implied concurrence of their subjects.

With reference to Lord Morley's Secret despatch, No. 11, dated the 21st May 1909, we have the honour to forward, for the information of His Majesty's Government, the correspondence detailed in the annexed schedule in regard to the proposed Order in Council for Bahrein. 2. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has procured from the Sheikh of Bahrein a request in writing r *de enclosure No. 2. that he may be relieved by the British Government of the responsibility of exercising jurisdiction over foreigners in his territory. We consider the •document valid enough for the purposes for which it is required, as it distinctly surrenders all civil and criminal jurisdic tion over foreigners in Bahrein to the British Government. We, therefore, recommend that the Political Resident may be empowered to inform the Sheikh that following thereon, the needlul provision has been made by His Majesty's Government. 3. We also submit, for Your Lordship's consideration, a draft of the proposed Order, and would draw attention to the following specific recommend- , ations made by our Political Resident Viae enclosure No. 4. • xi. t» • /i ir • in the Persian (iulr, viz.:— (а) the definition of the expression ' Foreigner (б) the need for a set of regulations for Registration, and (e) the necessity for the Court of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf being constituted the 'Chief Court' for purposes of Appeals under the proposed Order. As we agree in substance with the views expressed by the Political Resident the Order has been drafted to include provision covering the points detailed above. But in respect of the grant of the powers of a ' Chief Court ' to the Political Resident, in preference to subordinating the Bahrein Courts to the High Court at Bombay, we would, in drawing attention to the views expressed on a similar consideration in connection with Somaliland in paragraph 4 of Lord George Hamilton's Political despatch, No. 28, dated the 8th April 1897, mention that the Political Resident will be instructed by letter that when exercising these powers he must hold his Court within the limits of the Order. Similarly the Judicial Assistant to the Consul-General for Pars and the Coast and Islands of the Persian Gulf, and to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to whom special powers are to be given, will hold his Court, iI—\ when required, -within the limits of the Order. We do not consider that any inconvenience will arise by the adoption of this course as it is not likely that either of the officers will he absent from Bushire together, or that they will be required to hold their respective Courts in Bahrein frequently. 4. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf has further intimated that it would be advisable, if possible, to extend the provisions of ' The Poreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Council, 1910to Bahrein. The point is accordingly submitted for the orders of His Majesty's Government, as also are the views expressed by the same officer, in his telegram No. 367, dated the 19th „ _ April 1911, that the Political Agent, Vtde enclosure I&lt;io. 5. . i i-ii i j n .Bahrein, should he empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public, as was recommended by the Government of the Bight Hon'ble the Earl of Minto in paragraph 5 of their Secret despatch No. 188 (External), dated the 14tb November 1907.

INDIA OF^ICS. 24th July 1911. -r Sir, In continuation of previous correspondence ending . with the letter of this Office dated the 18th April last, communicating copy of the Viceroy's telegram of 13th April 1911, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to v enclose, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, copy of a letter from the Government of Inaia submitting a draft of the proposed Order in Council Foreign Department, Secret, No.67, j for Bahrein. It will dated 8th June 1911 (with copy of J Political Dispatch No.23, dated 5 be remembered that. 8th April 1897, appended). 5 in view of the local peculiarities to be provided for, that Government were requested to prepare the draft in the first instance. As regards what is said in the second paragraph of their letter , ^ am to observe that the Marquess of Or ewe sees no reason to question the capacity o^ the Sheikh to divest himself of his responsibility of exercising juris diction over foreigners in his territory, or the effective ness for its purpose of the document that he has signed as between the Sheikh and the British Government. But the question still remains whether the jurisdiction could safely be exercised over subjects of foreign civilized powers with out the assent given generally or in the particular case of the power concerned. On this point the Secretary of State the will be glad to receive the opinion of/Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs before he proceeds further. The terms of the draft Order will, doubtless, receive the careful attention of Secretary Sir E. Grey, but Lord Crewe as at present advised, sees no reason why they should not be fjgr 331 to, and he accepts the conclusions of the Government of India on the spacial points referred to in 0 paragraph 3 of their letter. He\ I s He v/ould also suggest that, if Sir E, Grey seea no ob ject ^ on, 'the Foreign Jurisdiction (Admiralty) Order in Gourjcnl 1910,' be extended to Bahrein, and the Political Agent be empowered to perform the functions of a Notary Public. Sir E. Grey will be able to judge whether this power will be best conferred on the Agent by the Opiep in Council or by separate notification. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your most obedient humble servant, •? Sd/- R. Ritchie. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.\ (Original In Pile IP/53 P. 27/3.) 39563/11, (COPY) FOREIGN OFFICE. August 31st 1911. The Sir, I am directed by Secretary Sir Edward u-rey to acknow ledge the receipt of your letters of May 23rd and June 15th, relative to the proposed amendment of the Persian Coast and Islands Order-in-Council and of the 24th ultimo, re lative to the proposed Bahrein Order in Council. As regards the former of these two questions, while Sir S: Grey recognises that the suggestions of His Majesty^ Consul General at Bushire, if carried into effect would greatly simplify the complicated system by which British jurisdiction is at present exercised in those regions, he nevertheless considers them merely as palliatives which will leave the situation improvedlindeed, but still far from simple or satisfactory. There is, in Sir E. Grey's view, little to be gained in the long run by such partial amendments to a system which requires more drastic treatment if it is ever to be made to work smoothly and efficiently. The lines on which, in his opinion, this question should be dealt with are to render the political and ju dicial spheres of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf coincident by putting in force a Persian Gulf Order in Council providing for the exercise of jurisdiction in all the territories bordering upon the Gulf in which ad ministrative control is vested in the Resident and con sequently superseding the existing Persian Coast^ and Islands and Muscat Orders and rendering superfluous the contemplated separate Order for Bahrein. Courts should be established wherever officials are to Under Secretary of State, A India Office.to fcund fit to oxeroiao judicial powers and provision should b9 raade to disestablish or vary thera with cojnparative ease. Thero should be a superior court to be held by the Resident or by a person specially appointed for the pur- ^pose, to which appeals should lie from the local courts. The law and machinery of the Order, within the limits of which would be included Muscat, the Trucial States, \_Bahrein and Koweit, would be similar to that provided in the existing Persian Coast^ and Islands Order, but might well include the amendments which have been inserted in the draft Bahrein Order. Sir E, Grey would be glad to receive an expression of the Marquess of Crewel opinion on this suggestion. As regards the proposed Bahrein Order, I am to state, that Sir A, Grey will abstain from observations on points of detail pending a decision of the question whether a comprehensive Order on the lines suggested above is feasible. With reference however to the point raised in the second paragraph of your letter, I am to state that, in Sir E. Grey's view, Bahrein, apart from the treaties into which it has entered with His Majesty's Government, j^s a sovereign and independent State and the Sheikh is thus entitled to oxsrcise jurisdiction over foreigners within its boundaries. He is also entitled to delegate to His Majesty's Government by treaty, jurisdiction over such foreigners and that treaty i would become operative and .vould transfer such jurisdiction whether acquiesced in or accepted by or notified to foreign Governments or not. Sir E. Grey considers that the Sheikh has already, by his letter of July 16th, 1909, the terms of which are quite clear, transferred to His Majesty's Government jurisdiction o : 7er foreigners in his dominions and that, if the Government * ofof any ^oreign Power objaot, the only ground on which they oould base their objection would be the ground that this jurisdiction was not the Sheikh's to grant, while if they failed to show that they themselves had received by treaty a grant of jurisdiction over their own subjects in Bahrein, they could not, it appears, claim that the jurisdiction did not belong to the Sheikh and that he had no power to grant it to His Majesty's Government. I am to aid that Sir E. Grey would be glad to be furnished with copies of such treaty provisions as exist giving-His Majesty's Government the right to exercise jurisdiction over British subjects in Ba?iTttru.

LONDOH, S.W. 2nd April, 1912. Sir, ifith reference to your letter No.30748 dtited 30th Auguat 1911, I urr directed 'by the Secretary of State for India to forward for the consideration of the Secretary of To Grovt. of India 1 Jan. 191E ) State for Foreign Affairs, From do. 20th March. ) copies of telegrams to and from the Government of India regarding the extension of British control over the Truoial Chiefs by an Order in Council. The circumstances that have led the Government of India to regard this course as necessary are fully set forth in the Government of India 1 s telegram dated 20th March; and read in con nexion with the letters from the ITaval Commander-in-Chief of the 26th April 1911 and the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, of the 3Cth idem fcopies of which were sent to your Department on 6th June 1911) they afford, in the Liar que s s of Crewe's opinion, cogent arguments in iavour of it, Kven if the present negotiations with Turkey result in the elimination of Turkish influence from the Arabian coast jouth of Ojair, it seems clear that the increasing attention paid by other Powers torithe Persian Gulf - which will be come still more marked if, as a result of the construction of the Bagdad Railway the Gulf becomes an international highway - has made it necesoary that our somewhat primiti/e methods of dealing with the Trucial Chiefs should be regularised and placed upon a basis that will secure our claims against Effective challenge. Hj^s Lordship is no more anxious than is Sir Edward Grey to extend our responsibilities but recent experience at the head of the Gulf indicates that the time has come when we can abstain from consolidating, and in some measure extending, them, only at the imminent risk of seeing our corresponding rights pass into the hands of others. The Government of i - i.idia s porposals are therefore re-recommended to Sir £•Gray^s favourable consideration^ It __ is presumed that if the Turkish Government is induced to relinquish its claim to El Katr, the Katr Sheikh will he in- ciuded in the new arrangement. The chain of British control will then be complete from Bahrein to Oman. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant, Sd. H.

From—L ieutexant-Colonel P. Z. Cox, C.S.I., C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To~The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I think the following will be of interest to the Government of India, and therefore have the honour to report it. 2. Early in August last, the Agents of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company at Mohammerah had some trouble with a large gang of British Indians whom they had engaged in Bombay as rivetters for fheir pipe line, and who, on arrival at Mohammerah, refused to go on to the Oil 'Works. When pressed to go on board the Karun steamer for Ahwaz, they turned on the Oil Company's European representatives, and one of the latter, Mr. Soane, was severely mauled. After the fracas they all absconded in different directions, some 15 taking refuge in Basrah. 3. The foregoing are the preliminary facts leading up to the correspond ence, of which I now enclose copies and request perusal. The points of it, as I understand them, appear to be these. The British Crown having extra-territorial jurisdiction in Turkey, Hi 9 Majesty's Consul, Basrah, vis-a-vis the Vali, was entitled to arrest and deal with the accused. Properly speaking no question of extradition was involved. The Yali's assistance having been asked, the latter ignores the capitulations and refuses to co-operate because there is no extradition treaty with the British Government. 4. Apparently at first His Majesty's Ambassador thought {vide his tele gram of 20th August) that the Vaii could be obliged to make a surrender in the usual way ; but from His Excellency's later telegram to Sir George Barclay it would seem that the usual practice is now held not to apply to this case. 5. I do not know enough of the law or usage on the subject to understand how it is, seeing that we have extra-territorial jurisdiction in Turkey, the Porte is entitled to go behind the right of His Majesty's Consul at Basrah under the Capitulations to have certain British subjects arrested. But, assuming that it is so entitled, then we are confronted with a very inconvenient situation which is sufficiently explained in Lieutenant Wilson's last communication (Enclosure No. 8). 6. I can do no more than respectfully express the hope that the point now at issue will not be finally conceded without full examination by the Law Officers of the Crown, and that, if it is held that surrender in such cases cannot be insisted on under present provisions, some means of getting round the difficulty may be sought. I am venturing to suggest the following procedure for the consideration of His Majesty's Minister in case it be held to be at all workable : — (i) That all contracts made by the Anglo-Persian Oil Company with their employes should be registered in the Consulate at Basrah, ^ as well as at Mohammerah, and that the Company should keep an agent in Basrah : (ii) That then, in such cases as the present. His Majesty's Consul Basrah, on the complaint of the Company's Basrah Agent, should issue direct warrants himself. He would then, I suggest, not be under the necessity of furnishing the Turkish authorities with ^ information of the nature of that referring to Mohammerah which he had to communicate to Yali Sulaiman Kazif Bey in his letter No. 48, dated 9th August (Enclosure No. 4). If, it would assist matters, there would seem to be nothing to prevent the said employes being registered at our Basrah Consulate as British subjects, as well as at Mohammerah.

Personally appeared before me this day Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, I.A., Acting Consul for Arabistan at Mohammerah (26), and Mr. E. B. Soane (29),in the employ of Messrs. Lloyd Scott and Company, Limited, Mohammerah, and after being duly sworn stated as follows Mr. Wilson duly sworn states:— On 8th, August 1910, at 6-30 P. M., I was standing on the wharf at Mohammerah, I heard shouting, and proceeding to the place whence it came, I saw several Indians, amongst whom were the persons named in the warrant which I have this day issued, attacking Messrs. Walpole, Wright, and Soane with sticks. Messrs. Walpole and Soane received some nasty blows. I observe that the incitement to fight was caused by the exhortation of a Pathan whose name I do not know, but whom I can identify as one of those mentioned in the warrant. The Indians were also beating some Persian and Kurd farrashes in the employ of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company. The Indians were beaten off and ran away. I was told that they fled to Basrah. A. T. WILSON, Lt. LA., Acting Contul for Arabistan. Sub-Enclosure 2 to Enclosure 2. „ ' Mr. E. B. Soane having been duly sworn states :— On the 8th August, at about 6-30 p. m., I was superintending the removal of the boxes of a gang of Indian labourers with Messrs. Wright and Walpole. An assault was made upon us by some Indians as mentioned in the warrant, armed with sticks. As a Jresolt of the attack I received the following injuries:— Finger put out (right hand), • Abrasion Head. „ Shoulder. ,. Right arm. „ Chest. These Indians were brought up on contract by the Oil Company to proceed to Mohammerah or any other place in Persia. They refused to proceed to Ahwaz by river boat as ordered. His Majesty's Consul recommended us to impress their luggage and put it on the steamer, and it was to emphasize their discontent when this was being done that they attacked us. E. B. SOANE. Sworn before me at Basrah this 9th day of August 1910. F. E. CROW, Sit Majesty's Consul. Enclosure 3. Telegram No. 50, dated the 10th August 1910. From—F. E. Crow , Esq., His Majesty's Consul, Basrah, To—-The Embassy, Constantinople. I requested Vali to help me to arrest 15 British Indian fugitives at Basrah charged with aggravated assault on Oil Company staff. Vali declines4 to surrender to me on ground that offence was committed in Persia, and we have no extradition treaty with it. Original warrant Mohammerah Consular Court produced to me, supported by affidavits of British Consul, Mohammerah, as witness, and of employe as victim of assault, taken by me. Documents will be sent to Supreme Court, Constantinople, next post for endorsement. I understand, from Judge's letter to me of February 17th, 1909, that this course is justifiable, though Persia is not grouped with Ottoman Dominions for purposes of Fugitive Offenders Act. In any case I do not think Vali can refuse surrender on grounds given. Enclosure 4. British Consulate, No. 49. Basrah, 16th August 1910. Sir, With reference to my telegram No. 60 of August 10th, I have the honour to transmit a copy of my letter to the Vali, No. 48 of August 9th, and the trans lation of His Excellency's reply, on the subject of the arrest at Basrah of 15 British Indians charged in the British Consular Court at Mohammerah of aggra vated assault, who are alleged to be in the jurisdiction of this Court, and to report as follows ;— On the 9th instant. Lieutenant Wilson, His Majesty's Acting Consul at Mohammerah, appeared at my office with Mr. E. B. Soane of the Persian Oil Com pany and produced a warrant issuod by his Court for the arrest of the persons indicated. He informed me that tl.ese persons were brought out from India under contract to the Oil Company to ser^e in any part of Persia, and, on arriving at Mohammerah, refused to proceed to the place appointed, and, when they were ordered to proceed by the Consul according to the terms of their agreement, and their baggage was put on board the Karun river steamer for the purpose, they violently assaulted with sticks certain English and native employes of the Oil Company, breaking the latter's finger and doing him other bodily harm, and then fled from the jurisdiction of the Court. Mr. Wilson made an affidavit before me as a witness, and Mr. Soane as a victim of the assault. On receipt of the original warrant and affidavits, I ordered an officer of my Court to effect the arrest of any of the persons mentioned in the warrant who were found with in the jurisdiction, and directed him to apply to the local authorities for assist ance. M essrs Wilson and Soane went to the serai with my dragoman and gave the authorities the necessary description of the culprits to aid in their iden tification, and I wrote to the Vali asking him to help me. The Vali communi cated with the Minister for Foreign Affairs by telegram, and replied that we had no Extradition Treaty with Turkey, and that he was instructed to keep the persons named under police supervision, and leave the question of their sur render to me for discussion between the Embassy and the Sublime Porte. The original warrant, order and affidavits were forwarded direct to the Judge of the Supreme Consular Court in my letter No. 70, of August 12th, for endorsement. With reference to an analogous case, in which the Political Agent at Bahrain asked for the surrender of a fugitive from Bahrain charged with em bezzlement in 1909, the Judge of the Supreme Court informed me, in his letter of February 17th, 1909, that although Bahrain was not grouped with the 4 Ottoman Dominions for the purpose of Part 2 of the Fugitive Offenders Act of 1881, I should, in his opinion, be jus ified, provided that I received information which satisfied me that an offence had been committed which fell within section 9 of the Act, and particularly if a warrant had already been issued, in taking the oath of an officer of the Court, founded on the letter or telegram, in which the information was contained, and that the original warrant must be sent to Constantinople for endorsement. The Judge said, as the Ottoman Order in/ ii ■' Q v i Council has been reviaed, lie would consider the advisability of grouping the Persian Gulf with the Ottoman Dominions for the purposes of Part 2 of the Fugitive Offenders Act, but in view of the Judge's letter to me, the course adopted seems to me justifiable, considering the nature of the case, and the probability of its recurrence, owing to the proximity of Mohammerah to Basrah and the large influx of Indian labour for the operations of the Persian Oil Company. As regards the Vali's contention, I was under the impression that Extra dition Treaties were unnecessary with Turkey, as ;far as we are concerned, as capitulation and otherwise the Crown has extra-territorial jurisdiction in the Ottoman Dominions. In view, however, of the Vali's reference to Constantinople, and the telegram from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I refrain from discussing the matter fur ther with His Excellency at present, pending Your Excellency's instructions. I am informed that the Vali has found some of the culprits and is keeping them under police supervision. His Majesty's Consul, Mohammerah, reports that eight are missing, and the rest are at Mohammerah. I have, etc., F. E. CROW. His Excellency The Hight Hon'ble Sir G. A.

I have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the arrest of the following persons, British subjects, is required by the British Consular Court at Basrah :— (Here follow 15 names as per warrant.) These persons are British Indians residing at Mohammerah and are registered there as British subjects. They are charged before the British Consular Court with aggravated assault, and some of them have escaped to Basrah. A warrant has been issued for their apprehension, and forwarded to me for execution. I have, therefore, to request Your Excellency to give me such armed assistance as may be necessary, in order to arrest any of these persons found at Basrah or in this neighbourhood. They should be handed over to this Consulate. Sub -enclosure 2 to Enclosure 4. {Translation.)

If such a demand were put forward by the Embassy and special papers produced it would require the consideration and decision of the Sublime Porte, and I am instructed to limit my action to keeping the persons mentioned under police supervision and to reply to you accordingly.

More than two months have now elapsed, and it appears that His Majesty's Ambassador has been unable to induce the Turkish Government to recede from the position they have adopted. We are, therefore, confronted with the effect that, as things now stand, British subjects charged with offences committed by them in Persia, Bahrain, or elsewhere cannot be apprehended if they take refuge on Turkish territory.3.

Where a person accused of an offence escapes or removes from the Consular district within which the offence was committed and is found within another Consular district, the Court within whose district he is found may proceed in the case to trial and punishment, or to preliminary examination (as the case may require), in like manner as if the offence had been committed in its own district; or may, on the requisition or with the consent of the Court within whose district the offence was committed, send him in custody to that Court, or require him to give security for his surrender to that Court, there to be dealt with according to law. Where any person is to be so sent in custody, a warrant shall be issued by the Court within whose district he is found, and that warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to carry him to and deliver him up to the Court within whose district the offence was committed, accord ing to the warrant. 39.—(1) In cases of murder or manslaughter, if either the death, or the criminal act which wholly or partly caused the death, happen within the jurisdiction of a Court acting under this Order, that Court shall have the like jurisdiction over any person, to whomthis Order applies, who is charged either as the principal offender, or as accessory before the fact to murder or as accessory after the fact to murder or manslaughter, as if both the criminal act and the death had happened within that jurisdiction.

In the Supreme Court, when the accused does not so consent, the charge shall be tried with a jury, unless the Court is of opinion that a jury cannot e obtained. . _. 1 n u ^ ^ h) The Supreme Court may, for any special reason, direct that any case shall be tried with Assessors or a jury, and a Provincial Court may, for any special reason, direct that Iny case Shall be tried with Assessors. In each such case the special reason shall be recorded in the Minutes. .5 (j) Where an accused person is ordered to be tried before a Court with a jury or with'Assessors, he shall be tried as soon after the making of the order as circumstances reasonably admit. j • u n u (2) As lone notice of the time of trial as circumstances reasonably admit shall be given to him in writing , 'nder the seal of the Court, which notice, and the time thereo , shall be recorded in the Muinutes.

Preliminary. Examination. ^^ Where the accused is before the Court, and it appears to the Court that the complaint discloses an offence {a) Which ought to be tried in or reported to another Court j or [h] Which ought to be tried before the same Court with a jury or Assessors ; the Court shall forthwith so inform the accused, and proceed to make a preliminary examination in the prescribed manner. ^ ^ (2) If after such preliminary examination the accused_ is ordered to be tried, the Court shall bind by recognizance the prosecutor and every witness to appear at the trial to prosecute, or to prosecute and give evidence, or to give evidence (as the case may be). 4 q . fi) If a British subject, having appeared as prosecutor or witness at a prelim- inarv examination, refuses to enter into a recognizance to appear at the trial to prosecute or give evidence, the Court may send him to prison, there to remain until after the tna , unless in the meantime he enters into a recognizance. (2) But if afterwards, from want of sufficient evidence or other cause, the accused is discharged, the Court shall order that the person imprisoned for so refusing be also dis charged. # (i) Where the prosecutor or witness is not a British subject, the Court may require him either to enter into a recognizance or to give other security for his attendance at the trial, and, if he fails to do so, may in its discretion dismiss the charge. e 0 . (x) The charge upon which an accused person is tried shall state the offence charged with such particulars as to the time and place of the alleged offence, and the person (if any) against whom or the thing (if any) in respect of which it was committed as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the matter with which he is charged. (2) The fact that a charge is made is equivalent to a statement that every condition required by law to constitute the offence charged was fulfilled in the particular case. f-j) Where the nature of the case is such that the particulars above mentioned do not give such sufficient notice as aforesaid, the charge shall also contain such particulars of the manner in which the alleged offence was committed as will give such sufficient notice. (4) For the purposes of the application of any Statute law, a charge framed under the provisions of this Order shall be deemed to be an indictment. c [. For every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge, and ever /such charge shall be tried separately, except in the cases following (that is to say) :— '' ^ A ' frt) Where a person is accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed within the space of twelve months from the first to the last of such offences, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, any number of them not exceeding three.II [b) If in one series of acts so connected together as to form the same transaction more offences than one are committed by the same person, he may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, every such offence. (c) If the acts alleged constitute an offence falling within two or more definitions or descriptions of offences in any law or laws, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, each of such offences. {d) If several acts constitute several offences, and also when combined a different offence, the accused may be charged with, and tried at one trial for, the offence constituted by such acts when combined, or one or-more of the several offences, but in the latter ca ^ shall not be punished with more severe punishment than the Court which tries him could award for any one of those offences. (e) If a single act or series of acts is of such a nature that it is doubtful which of several offences the facts which can be proved will constitute, the accused may be charged with having committed all or any of such offences, and any number of such charges may be tried at once ; or he may be charged in the alternative with having committed some one of the offences; and if it appears in evidence that he has committed a different offence for ,w r hich he might have been charged, he may be convicted of that offence, although not charged with it. 52. When more persons than one are accused of the same offence or of different offences committed in the same transaction, or when one is accused of committing an offence and another of abetting or attempting to commit that offence, they may be charged and tried together or separately, as the Court thinks fit. 53.—(1) Any Court, if sitting with a jury or Assessors, may alter any charge at any time before the verdict of the jury is returned or the opinions of the Assessors are ex pressed ; if silting without jury or Assessors, at any time before judgment is pronounced. (2) Every such alteration shall be read and explained to the accused. (3) If the altered charge is such that proceeding with the trial immediately is likely, in the opinion of the Court, to prejudice the accused or the prosecutor, the Court may adjourn the trial for such period as may be necessary. ^—(1) No error cr omission in stating either the offence or the particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material, unless the accused was misled by such error or omission. (2) When the facts alleged in certain particulars are proved and constitute an offence, and the remaining particulars are not proved, the accused may be convicted of the offence constituted by the facts proved, although not charged with it. (3) When a person is charged with an offence and the evidence proves either the commission of a minor offence or an attempt to commit the offence charged, he may be convicted of the minor offence or of the attempt. ee (1) If the accused has been previously convicted of any offence, and it is intended to prove such conviction for the purpose of affecting the punishment which the Court is competent to award, the fact, date, and place of the previous conviction shall be stated in the charge. (2) If such statement is omitted, the Court may add it at any time before sentence is passed. (3) The part of the charge stating the previous conviction shall not be read out in Court nor shall the accused be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge, unless and until he has either pleaded guilty to, or been convicted of, the subsequent offence. (4) If he pleads guilty to, or is convicted of, the subsequent offence, he shall then be asked whether he has been previously convicted, as alleged in the charge. (O If he answers that he has been so previously convicted, the Court may proceed to pass sentence on him accordingly, but, if he denies that he has been so previously convicted, or refuses to, or does not, answer such question, the Court shall then inquire concerning such previous conviction, and in such case (where the trial is by jury) it shall not be necessary to swear the jurors again. eg Where a British subject is accused of the commission of an offence the cognizance whereof appertains to the Court, and it is expedient that the offence be inquired of tried, determined, and punished in a British possession, the accused may (under the toreign Jurisdiction Act, 1890, section 6) be sent for trial to Bombay or Malta. The Supreme Court may, where it appears so expedient, by warrant under the hand of the Judge and the seal of the Court, cause the accused to be sent for trial to Bombay or Malta accordingly. The warrant shall be sufficient authority to any person to whom it is directed to receive and detain the person therein named, and to carry him to and deliver him up to Bombay or to Malta (as the case may be), according to the warrant. Where any person is to be so sent to Bombay or to Malta, the Court before which he is charged shall take the preliminary examination, and shall bind over, such of the proper12 witnesses as are British subjects in their own recognizances to appear and give evidence on the trial.
