He describes the role of internet social media like Facebook (the We are Khaled Said page) and YouTube in prompting participation in the 18 Days of demonstrations in January and February 2011.  He claims that online videos of police violence like the shooting of demonstrators prompted many to join the protests; the arrest of his close friend was the reason for his own participation, and he slept in Tahrir Square for almost a week.  ###### discusses how individuals had to balance their family responsibilities with participating in the demonstrations, rotating between protesting at Tahrir Square and looking after the security of their families.  ###### describes Tahrir Square as a place where music and other forms of artistic expression thrived, and speaks about two revolutionary songs he wrote and distributed online.</dc:description><dc:date>2012-10-22</dc:date><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:identifier>20121022</dc:identifier><dc:relation>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution</dc:relation><dc:source>University on the Square: Documenting Egypt's 21st Century Revolution oral histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2012, American University in Cairo.
