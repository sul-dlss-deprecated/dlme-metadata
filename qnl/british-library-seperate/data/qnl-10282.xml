The correspondence includes a copy of an oil concession agreement between the Sultan of Muscat and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company which was signed in 1925.The file also contains correspondence with Shaikh ‘Isa bin Saleh al-Harthi, the representative of the Imam of Oman, asking him for permission in order for the oil company to be able to send a geologist to explore the areas under the control of the Imam.Among other correspondents in the file are the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, and the Foreign Secretary to the Government of India.The file’s core correspondence covers the period 9 September 1921-23 June 1928. The earlier start date given for the file is a result of a translated letter (f 17 ), itself dated 27 October 1913, from the Ruler of Kuwait, Shaikh Mubarak al-Sabah, regarding oil deposits at Kuwait.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Anglo-Iranian Oil Company Limited</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Oman</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Oil</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000250#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000250#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000250#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000250#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
