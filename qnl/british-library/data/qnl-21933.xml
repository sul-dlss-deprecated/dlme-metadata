Political Agency, Bahrain, 12th December 1944. m My dear Belgrave, The Royal Air Force have sought permission to survey Manama Island with a view to establishing a second airfield. I have said that there is no objection to the survey. Yours sincerely. C. Dalrymple Belgrave, Esq., C.B.E., Adviser to the Bahrain Government, Bahrain. I/Msecret / D.O.No.C/21. Political Agency, Bahrain, 6th January 1946. My dear Sir Geoffrey, Group Captain Curtain-Jones (who is the Staff Officer- in-Charge of Administration, Habbaniyah), and has been down y* here with the Survey party mentioned in my telegram No. 1104 dated the 12th December 1944, called to see me yesterday evening. He said that they had selected two possible sites for a landing ground on Manamah Island neither of which were ideal and that whichever of the two was eventually chosen it would prove somewhat of a problem for the engineers. One of the sites is just after the main Manamah-Awali road leaves the palm belt and the other is on the west side of the island between Budayah and Zellaq. According to Curtain-Jones his suggestions will now go to the Air Ministry and nothing will be heard of the project until they have considered the matter. 2. The area required is very considerable. As much as four thousand yards of clear ground being necessary in these days for the main runv/ay, of this approximately three thousand five hundred yards would be made runway. In addition there must be two other runways of approximately two thousand yards. I asked Curtain-Jones to let me have a rough plan of the selec ted areas so that I could make preliminary enquiries regarding the ownership of the land. He asked whether there would be any difficulty in acquiring the land,and I said that as far as I could foresee there would be very little difficulty if the ground were Bahrain Government owned but that in the event of it being privately owned there might be serious difficulties. 3. I asked why an additional landing ground was required and was told that Muharraq was not, in Its present state, sufficiently firm for very heavy bombers, that the work of building concrete runways, though perfectly feasible, could /only The Hobble Sir Geoffrey Prior, K.C.I.E., political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire.2» only be done by gravely interrupting the flow of aircraft eastwards and that this could not be permitted, and that although the iron plating now being put down at Ifuharraq would be protected from corrosion and would take the weight of very heavy bombers there was no certainty that it would do so for an indefinite time. The risk of liuharraq breaking up could not be accepted as the flow of aircraft must not be interrupted therefore some additional site would have to be found. I gathered from Curtain-Jones that he had suggested going to the Has Tanura site while Muharraq was put into a fit state to take all types of craft presumably by concreting runways* 4* The above is the gist of the conversation. I gather ✓ that the Americans are proving as difficult as usual and have announced that the landing ground could be completed by Anextican engineers in six months. cur tain-Jones does not think this possible but I do not agree with him for I feel that with their ruthless methods they could do the work in time but we should have a very difficult time later trying to re-balance the labour market. Tours sincerely, / t'%Telegram S(Pad). ^ ,rom Political Agent, Bahrain# T 0 Political Resident, Bushire# No. 37. Dated the 14th January, 1945. IMMEDIATE . ( TELEX ). , S '3 ' Reference my telegram No.1104 dated 12th December. 2* Air Vice-Marshall Collier, Transport Comiiand, accompanied by Air Vice-Marshall George and Air Commodore Whitney-Straight, together with a number of experts visited Bahrain on the 12th/13th of January. They examined site for a new landing ground between Budayah and Zellaq. I understand that the site is considered satisfactory and that we may expect a request to acquire it in the near future. I was informed th«t it was considered essential that a landing ground capable of taking V.H. bombers must be made available here at the earliest opportunity and that it would probably be equally essential after the war though the Air Ministry had appeared reluctant to commit themselves on the subject of post-war civil aviation. 4. In answer to a question by Collier I said that in my opinion it was essential that the work be undertaken by thev Royal Air Force and that an offer by the U.S.A.T.C. to participate in the construction of the ground should be rejected. I regret that it was impossible owing'to the extreme short - notice of the visit to communicate with you before making this statement. I trust that it meets with your approval. - POLITICAL - R.M. 1' h Political Resident, Bushire. Political Agent, Bahrain. Telegram From To No. 116. Dated the 16th and received 13th January, 1946.

My dear Belgrave, ^ Reference your Demi-official letter No.290-31, dated the 3rd February, 1946. 2. The visit is in connection with a new aerodrome, I believe. I have no details but - believe that Muharraq is not suitable for modern heavy craft and that a new field is required in Bahrain if Bahrain is to be kept on the air route. 3. The above is quite unofficial and as, so far as I can see, Bahrain has all to gain and nothing to lose in the survey I should be grateful for early authority. Yours sincerely.

Among the issues discussed in the correspondence are: obtaining permission from the Shaikh for ground surveys to be carried out at Manama, comments on the viability of laying a new runway that would be 3500 yards long, and the rejection of offers from the USATC [United States Army Transportation Corps] to build the new aerodrome.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x000099#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
