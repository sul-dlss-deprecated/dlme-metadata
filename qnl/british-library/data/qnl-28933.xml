I have taxed the Shaikh with the paragraph published by Mr. Brinton and he vehemently denied that any agreement whatsoever had been entered into with Ibn Saud during his visit to Riyadh or at any other time. I expect it is unnecessary for me to repeat his protestations which followed the usual pattern. 3 . He did, however, add that when in conversation with Ibn Saud they both naturally referred to each other as brothers and to their people (and presumably armed forces) as one: as you know, such talk is only what is to be expected at reunions of this nature. These verbal exchanges were probably the only basis of the reports in the Egyptian press. Yours sincerely, i Sd/- M.P. O'C Tandy, Lt.Col.

No. 72/1182/3. BRITISH LEGATION, JEDDA, SAUDI .ARABIA. January 12th., 1940. My dear Baggallay, I send you herewith a copy of an interesting letter from de Gaury, in which he describes the visit of the Sheikh of Koweit to Riyadh from December 1st. to 20th., 1939. Prom the point of view of personal relations the visit seems to have gone off very well. 2. As for the business side, I fear that little was done: in fact both the King and the Sheikh denied that there had been any business discussions at all. Trott telegraphed to you as soon as he received them the King’s latest reactions about ’’musabala” and about a few other points on which the two sides have not yet come to terms: and nothing further can be done until your instructions on those points reach me. One result of this delay (which is inevitable) is that both sides seem to be putting the blame for the delay on His Majesty 1 s Government and I fear de Gaury was made to look rather foolish through no fault of his own. The two rulers now say 'Now we are such friends we must seal our friendship 'by fixing up those three agreements, if only the British will 'let us'. I hope that it may be possible to satisfy that admirable aspiration soon. 3. I am sending copies of this letter to Bagdad and Bushire. Yours ever, (Signed) Hugh S. Bird. H.L. Baggallay, Esq.., Foreign Office.I Enclosure to Mr. Stonehewer-Bird *s letter No. ! i&gt;f J January 12th., 1940. Copy of letter from Captain de Gaury dated Riyadh December 22nd., 1939, to Mr. Trott. The often deferred visit of the Sheikh of Koweit, when, this month, it as last took place, was a long one from December 1st. to the 20th. It seemed to be a great success, although at one moment, near the end of the visit, the Sheikh did complain to me that life in Riyadh was 'Prison' - that it lacked 'society' and 'amusement'. This however may have been an attempt to draw me into criticising Riyadh, which I avoided, or to make me praise Koweit f s amenities. Everything to please the Sheikh which could be done was done. The King and Court went quite a long way out to meet the Sheikh on the day of his arrival. He was installed in the new guest quarters of the new Murabba Palace. There were dinner parties every night and several banquets, for a hundred people or more. He accompanied the King to the town Palace every a day and s^t with him while he held audiences. They spent most afternoons motoring together and went for a few days to the new agricultural development at KHA.RJ, south-east of Riyadh. Both the King and the Sheikh attacked me separately about the Koweit agreements. His Majesty’s Government were very slow about these agreements. That there was no agreement to be made public, now that they had both met on such cordial terms, would be difficult to explain away. It would be obvious that the delays came from His Majesty’s Government.I was several times asked if I would, like to see the King quite alone - without Sheikh Ahmed - or did I wish to see Sheikh Ahmed alone? Near the end of the visit both separately informed that they had not discussed ’’business ” with the other! After the banquet on the 19th. - as I was leaving the Palace - Sheikh Yusuf, the King's political secretary, drew me aside - into a deserted half-lit reception room - and asked me if, even at this eleventh hour, there was not the opportunity of speaking about the Koweit agreements? Had I nothing to say? The responsibility was mine, if I was silent. I repeated that I had had no new material or instructions. The King and several of his sons accompanied Sheikh Ahmed on the day of his departure as far as Ma f aizila, about forty minutes by car from Riyadh, where there was a ’•picnic' lunch for about eighty people. Sheikh Ahmed’s presents from the King included a Cadillac, a Buick, a Ford, a box Ford and a Ford lorry, arms, clothes, four young negresses and a wireless telephone. His brother Hamoud received a car and two negresses, and a deadly looking automatic rifle from the Amir Saud. A1 Nafisi, the Saudi Agent in Koweit, received a car and a negress (He is about 70). Incidentally he complained to the King, at Ma’aizila, about lack of spare parts and good tubes with his gift car. His Majesty sent for the driver and called for a rifle. He unloaded the rifle, winked at those in the tent, and stalking over to the door suddenly appeared there aiming at his waiting driver. I have never seen a man run so quickly. He was back from Riyadh with new spares and tyres within an incredibly short time! TheThe King several times asked Sheikh Ahmed why he had not brought with him Sheikh Ali al Khalifa, his cousin, who plays a prominent part in the control of Koweit, and who is doubtless more companionable to him than Sheikh Ahmed. On leaving one of the dinner parties he said to the Sheikh 1 s servants, before the Sheikh 'There is no good in you' 'Why did 'you come without Ali al Khalifa'. Sheikh Ahmed looked put out. Before the visit the King had one day begun to give me his opinion of Sheikh Ahmed. It was not at all flattering, and he had called him a bad politician and said he was 'difficult'. Nevertheless while here they seemed to get on remarkably well, and on first meeting the King appeared really well pleased; swinging round to me he said 'I have got him for you at last'. In fact, whatever their private thoughts, the visit must be accounted a successful one.(E 484 /^ 7 /H&amp;). rv My dear Bira f Many thanKa Tor your letter ol tiie lath January in which you enclosed an entertaining report from de oaury on the sheiich of Koweit’s visit to Xhn tiaud. a. ve ere glad tdet the visit was so successful, even though the saudl-Koeeit agreeaents were not even discussed.

He did not take the opportunity X gave to tell me. Colonel Qiokaon of the Kuwait oil Go. Ltd., tells me tJ»t he went further than X did ana asked the shaikh point blank what he and the King discussed. The Shaikh - so Colonel Dickson says - emphatical ly denied any political conversations. I think we may take it that they did discuss politics because, as you are aware, no Arabs of position are capable of being together long and not doing so, but it may be,and probably is,true that it was not the immediate object of the King’s visit ana that any conversations were general and incidental. 2 . It is now publicly known that the shaikh suent Rs. 100,001 on the entertainment of and gifts to his visitors. He says that it was well worth it as relations are improved.

'jHi© Political Agent (Colonel H*B.P.i4ckson) went out some Uttle way to meet his party as it came in. This is courtesy in accordance with local ideas, which tor some obscure reasons or superstition avoids meeting or seeing off visitors at Town gates. f jftie subject of any pri/ate political discussions which raay have talasn place between the shaikh and the King are still undivulged, ho offidU. conversations took place. The King’s visit was generally said to be due to a desire to be near at hand to shaikh Yusuf Yassin, who is engaged In conversations in baghdad in connect ion with the Pact of Kon Aggression (Turkey-Persia^Iraq-caudi Arabia and Afghanistan! and possibly in addition on a side agreement between Iraq and oaudi .^abia only; also to return the visit which was owing to the ohaikh of Kuwait who visited Riyadh in 1932.6* Hurrying couriers passed frequently between Kuwait and Baghdad tiirou^aout the King’s visit, while on the other hand His Majesty and his entourage produced an atmosphere of cordiality ana unexpected brightness in Kuwait* 7. His liajesty seemed particularly well although he alleged a severe attack of some internal trouble while travelling. He was in a quite romping and very lavish mood. 8. His presents included an order for several new Ford cars from Basra for the shaikh. Ks. 1500 to the poor of Kuwait and a very handsome sum to Jassim al Yacoub, the Jhaikh’s Palace *i.gant and the shaikh’s servants. 9 # In return every man of the party which numbered six hundred seventy five (who travelled in 145 motors ) was given his 'KIB.va' , i.e. cloak ana complete outfit and thirty rupees. 10. iwmong the royal party were the .lair Muhammad, son .iair Khalid, son Kmir Mansour, son jimir Baud al ^.rafa, brother-in-law l&gt;r. Fakhri , Bhaikh al ^rdh Abdur Rahman ash Jhuwaish , Chamb&lt;5rlain Ibrahim al Jumaia, secretary. H # His Majesty’s romping mood allowed itself in much jocularity at the various parties he attended and included the throwing into the sea of two IltfUiUS Mollas, who were later suitably rewarded for being victims of this royal horseplay. 12. His Majesty is credited with having married twice during his week’s stay, first to MiUSA, a daughter of the late Shaikh Mubarak of Kuwait and secondly - information is less certain here - to the daughter offered by an iiafisi , t) King’s agent in Kuwait, a girl whose youth ana beauty is said to amply make up for any lack of lineage. 1 $.

The Jhaikh accompanied the King, as a courtesy and in ord^r to hunt with him on and about the frontier. His Majesty expected to reach Jarya al Ilya on about the 9th February, and the shaikh to return to Kuwait about the same day. 16. The general i tpression created by the visit was excellent. The town was en fete and the shopkeepers found it a financial windfall very much to their liking, because this fahhabi party bought up every bottle of scent in the bazaar, much silk, 40 gramophones, every record available, tobacco in great quantity, many maunds of coffee, all Ford spares, and so much petrol that there was none left in Kuwait• 17.

A combined Summary for the whole of January is therefore submitted. 8. VISIT OF H.M. KING ABD T TL AZIZ AL SA1JD TO KUWAIT?, (a) On 29th January, H.M. the King of Saudi Arabia reached a point 70 miles from Kuwait and wan met by Hie iSxcellency the Shaikh and senior members of the family as the result of a wireless telegram. His Majesty had previously intimated that he would spend the night at Ab al Hiran in the centre of the Garaa region, and invited the Shaikh to dinner there but the latter was able to persuade him to camp at Khabrat al Duwish (or Khabrat Jilhim as it is commonly known locally) some 43 miles south west of the Town. From there, the4 $ Shaikh pointed out, it would bo convenient to make formal entry into Kuwait the next day. (b) Cn 3Cth Jiuiuary at 6.3C sum. , the Political Agent accompanied by the leading perbomOlitieH o* the Town proceeded to the frontier Bear Mant.qieh hills and met ih« King and the Shaikhs party as they crossed who frontier. (c) Hie Majesty on seeing the Political Agent graciously descended from his car and greeted him in most cordial fashion after which he received the others and shook hands one by one. (d) The King was accompanied by 145 cars and lorries containing 673 officials and attendants all told. ( e ) The citizens of Kuwait gave His Majesty a genuine and remarkable welcome for surpassing anything the writer has yet seen in the principality. The Town bazaars were gaily and lavishly decor-ted and 45 quite good triumphal arches appeared over night along the whole route from the Jahara gate to Dasman palace. The whole oi this, a distance of miles was lined by armed Bedouin and at intervals tribal dances (arthas) were kept going till the King t s p rty had passed, these then followed the procession, and formed up near the Palace, for the King’s inspection. The whole scene mixed up as it was with numerous war flags, standards, banners war drums and ululating women, was picturesque in the extreme. (f) The King from all accounts was delighted with his reception and the welcome given by the Kuwait crowds, and saluted again and again as he slowly drove along between the crowds. (g) At 3 p.m. the same day the Political Agent called on His Maj sty in uniform, and after a 15 minutes talk retired. (£) On the 1st February, H.M.King Abdul Aziz-5- AT^dul Aziz accompanied *by hi a 3 son8 f 3 nephews» Saua al Arafat Mohained hin Ahdul Aziz 'bin TnrXi Abu Dhi’ai* and five of his staff attended an official Arab banquet at -he Agency. With them came the Shaikh of Kuwait» Sh&amp;i&amp;hs Abdulla al Salim, Hamad al Mubarak, Ali al Salim# Salim al Harmad, Abdulla al Jabir and Abdulla an-iiafisi (Saudi Agent in Kuwait )• (i) Dinner was served on the floor and apart i rom side dishes consisted of seven whole sheep on larje dishes of rice: (3) The King ate a very hearty meal and was most complimentary as to the arrangements* (k) After dinner His Majesty sat for half an hour discoursing on general topics and was joviality itself, chaffing all and sundry and telling story after story* (X) on the arrival of Captain De Gaury from London on Lth February the writer took him to call on the liaikh of Kuwait and the King who received them sitting together in audience. (m) The King left on the 6th February after lunch, the writer and Captain De Gaury going four miles out of the city to bid him farewell. At this final good bye, the King graciously invited the writer to visit Riyath and continue on to Jedda, when he could get the time to do so* (n) Whilst in Kuwait His Fajesty lunched or dined in turn with the leading notables of the Town. He also paid calls or had coffee with many old friends of his Childhood days, an attention very much appreciated* (o) During the latter part of the King’s stay several prominent Basra and Subair citizens arrived and were received in audience. One of them, Seyed Abdur Rahman al Haqib, unfortunately died 24 hours after Ms and/al as a result of a heai't attack. The King, shocked to hear the news visited his brother’s house in the Town personally/- 6 - personally to condole* This kind act was much comiented on* (p) The King among other tilings read certain Iraqi Press correspondents, a sharp lesson in public by asking what some of their papers meant by saying that he. Bin Baud, intended to denounce the Iraq-Nejd boundary treaty of 1923» and also for always trying to create trouble and misunderstmiding between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia* They should know, said he, vehemently, that between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia there was life long friendship and sympathy for both States were one, in blood and origin* Further that should he or his staff ever be in straits he knew full well that the Shaikh of Kuwait and all his people would be the first to come to his assistance, as w mid also he with all his if Kuwait were ever in peril or need* COMPShT* Allowing always for the enthusiasm of the moment, such words bear significance* (q) Before the King left for Riyadh, the Shaikh presented him with Rs* 25,000/- in cash for himself and his children, robes of honour for himself and his Staff, and 673 cloaks, 673 Siboons, and 673 head cloths for the attendants. The whole cost of the visit came in other words to slightly over Rs* 100,000, according to the Shaikh, but as he put it M I thank Almighty God for the King's visit to us, and I do not believe the money has been in any way wasted”. The King in return gave many and suitable presents to all the Shaikh's staff and attendants, and Rs. 10,000 in cash to the poor of the city* He himself distributed much of this last personally, as he drove through the crowds on his departure* (r) Below will be found a list of those who accompanied His ajesty to KuwaitH2.,/0 GOVERNMENT ON INDIA 3.2.36. My dear Laithv;aite , I’m terribly busy, firstly packing up in preparation of De Gaury’s arrival, secondly dancing attendance on the King. B.S. arrived last Thursday and I met him on the frontier 50 miles away. The Sheikh and members of his family went 100 miles into the desert to meet him: Kuwait gave a stupendous and really magnificent welcome to B.S. which surpassed all my hopes and expectations. Apart from general flag decorations, the Sheikh had 45 triumphal arches fixed up on the route inside the town from Jahara gate to Daman Palace: The King seemed genuinely touched with the welcome put up for him and I hope results will be good politically later. I called in uniform the afternoon of the arrival and followed it up with an Arab Banquet in the Agency - The King, his three sons, three nephews (sons of his dead brother Saad), Saud al ’Araba, and all his important entourage were present as also was Sheikh Ahmad and his senior relations. It was a great show, six whole sheep on mountains of rice, not/not including many other delicacies !!! I called again this A.M. (3.2.36) to introduce Scott of the K.O.C. In general conversation with me the King expressed deep sympathy for the Royal Family at home and sorrow at the death of King George but as he said 'We Kings must go and come and probably my turn will come next. The main thing however was to keep the Government strong, and changes of Kings did not matter'. He seemed greatly impressed with the words of the Archbishop of Canterbury at the burial service, and more particularly with the words 'Dust to Dust and Ashes to Ashes, etc., etc.' These were, he said, proper Wahabi sentiments and appealed to the Arabs of Arabia more than anything else. Still no sign of the King’s departure. He has **bC men with him and 100 cars, but Sheikh A. keeps a stiff upper lip and says nothing of how much it is costing him. Very hard luck on him ’. .’ I myself think the King is waiting the results of Yusub Yasin’s mission to Baghdad. He is negotiating some sort of treaty of friendship there. If he (B.S.) hears that all has gone well, I rather think he will ask King Ghazi to meet him at Junraima on the Iraq-llejd f rontier/frontier where the new pilgrim route cuts the frontier.

Ibn Saud’s visit to Koweit is to be welcomed in so far as it may improve personal relations between him and Sheikh of Koweit. But the possibility of political discussions taking place raises questions of some difficulty. I should be glad of your observations and those of Resident by telegraph on following suggestions: (a) Political Agent should be present in uniform on arrival of King and should attend any important function in his honour. He should also take any opportunity of extending courtesy to His Majesty, e.g. by entertainment at Agency. He should, at his discretion, impress on Sheikh desirability of avoiding political discussions except in presence of Political Agent. (b) Smooth working of any settlement that may be reached on Blockade question must depend largely on good will of Ibn Saud and if there were discussion of this question during visit a settlement might be facilitated. It might therefore be undesirable to prevent discussions even if it were practicable to do so, but Political Agent should be in the closest touch with them if they take place.hrDraft Paper Department 2 . / ( / y*' practicable to do so, but t*re,y are particularly aim.1 uus LliaL Political Agent should be in the closest touch y / 7 / with them if'they take place. Apart fact that Ihn saud is weliT aware of H.M'.G. 1 s position in regard to Koweit, th^ N fact \of De G^ury having been present at the (flscussions in Riyadh would constitute obvious argument for his being present in ' 1 similar discussions in Koweit (I presume of couy&amp;e that visit is unlikely to take place before Dickson hands oyer.)

It is probably unnecessary to take any line at Jedda (see/paragraph 3 of Jedda^elegram of 7th January, No.7) yv((r' except to w&amp;lcome it a§/opportunity for still further strengthening friendly personal relations between King and sheikh.

Your Majesty stated that it was your considered view in regard to the camel losses (between the subjects of both states), that when the owner recognized his property, the same should be taken from him (the holder) and restored to him and that the holder Y should then go and se^oh for the seller (loan from whom he bought), as hostilities no longer exist, end full arrangements to restore all spoils lave been made between Your Majesty and other (adjacent ) countries. Thi s your ^lajesty considered as best for the comfort of all. I, your bteehr brother, am pleased with anything that Your Majesty proposes, because^ our two countries and peoples are one and the same. ..nd by your safe existence they will Insha ’^llah remain in peace and tranquility for all time. As to the question of camel losses, I, your brother, have been enforcing this Code (^rafa law) since fa long time: So that when the owner comes with or without a letter, gives evidence as to his nationality and proves his ownership, the camels claimed are restored to him, without further references. The holder is then told to go and search for the seller (man from whom he bought). In my letter dated 9th najab 1354 (7.10.35) forwarded with your servant Ghazi al-Hafta, I informed Your Majesty about the said servant’s camel, that when the latter recognized it with al Jharika, and the latter proved his having purchased it from Al Ha trash, who coulti not produce the seller, I took the camel from him and restored it to your servant: Ha trash is still searching for the seller. The arrangement is, in very fact, a great relief for all. May God preserve you.

The Shaikh verbally told the writer that he welcomed such moire, and the King’s desire to put such problems on an official basis. The King in a separate and cordial letter received at the same time, again thanked the Shaikh for his valuable gift of hunting hawks, and said that if sport this year was poor near the Capital, he intended visiting the borders of Kuwait, to hunt in the Garaa and Dibdibba regions between the.

Fuad knows nothing of this and discredits the report all the more as the Crown Prince has not accompanied the King to Hasa. 2. On the other hand Fuad confirms the news which reached me yesterday that I’bn Baud himself will probably visit Koweit in the near future in response to an invita tion from the Sheikh. His intention is apparently to return first from Rasa to Fiyadh and then go to Koweit. Fuad could not say off-hand whether the visit would be official or unofficial.

Inspite of this being quite a normal procedure one cannot but welcome these friendly advances in the matter by the King. actually the law has for long been in operation and is as old as Abraham, so the King's letter is not xeally understood • 5 ^ Qne thing appears clear, ana that is that the King desires mutual recognition of this particular 'Gesert laW’ by an exchange of friendly official notes: This will be srelcoaed by the Lhaikh.

It 1 b well known to you, my Brother, that the two countries are one and the same, am that there always happen to be claims for camels lost both by your tribesmen against ours, and by our t ibesman against yours. The o ner of the camel lost usually comes from your side and says: 'This is my camel which I know very werl'. hen we make enquiry from the person in whose custody the camel is found, the latter says that he has bought it from the Jhaamar, Dhefir etc. Likewise some of them say they have bought the camel in Kuwait; others in lassa ana so on. This makes matters very difficult indeed. If you approve of it, the best thing for us and our subjects will be to act as follows: .uiy camel that is taicen from tribesmen of Kuwj it anc is sold to our tribesmen or in our territory, (which in real ity belongs to Kuwait persons) ana when the purchaser of such camel cannot say or gi /e the name of the man from whom he bou Rit the animal, then such camel shall be restored to its owner, further the man with whom i t is recognized shall be bound to search for the seller himself, similarly, should a Nejd subject recognize his camel with a Kuwait subject, arti the latter soy he does not kno tt the seller, the camel shall be restored to the cwner, and it shall belea be up to the Kuwaiti to firki out who the seller was. For, now, thanks to God, there are no hostilities: there is an understanuing between us anu the people oi Iraq, ^yjia, Falestino and ;ransJordan, that all looted properties should be restored. hould you consider this suitable, then all depend on God*s decision and yours.

The shaikh has acted quite correctly in showing Ibn Saud’s letter, and his reply, to you. This is what he promised to do when the question of his corresponding with Ibn Saud was raised by His Majesty’s Government - vide paragraph 11 of your letter No.C-125, dated the 6th April 1934, copy forwarded to Secretary of State for India and the Government of India under my Printed Letter No.358-S, dated the 20th P pril 1934. 3.

I hare forgotten the little Latin T ever knew but a few tags remain one of which runei Tlmeo Dana os etc. Since the M Arafa* law, as you point out in paragraph 4 of your letter, has been in opera tion since the time of Abraham, it is not clear why Ibn Saud should now raise the question in &lt;'.D.1935.
