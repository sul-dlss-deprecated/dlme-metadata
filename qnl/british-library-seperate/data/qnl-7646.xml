These requests are entirely from French nationals and are submitted to the Foreign Office on their behalf by the French Embassy in London. One of these requests is for a flight of two French military planes. These requests are then forwarded to the India Office for comment, and occasional reference is made to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. It is noted that such requests have increased due to a recent diplomatic rupture between France and Iran.Letters from the French Embassy are in French.The file includes a divider which gives a list of correspondence references contained in the file by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>French Embassy, London</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Civil aviation</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000234#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000555.0x000234#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
