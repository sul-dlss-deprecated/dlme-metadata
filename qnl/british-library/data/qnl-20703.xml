Khalid-bin-Sultan, whose mother was Arab, resided quietly at Shargah till his death and was respected by the people, who would probably have preferred him to Shaikh Salim. 8. Towards the end of March 1883 Shaikh Salim, unsuspicious of danger, proceeded for change of air to the Island of Boo Moosa, where his horses were kept at grass. His brother, Ahmed-bin-Sultan, at the same time went to Ras-el-Khaimah, and their nephew, Sakar-bin-Khalid, was left in charge of Shargah. 9. Sakar-bin-Khalid, a young man of 20 years or under, took advantage of the oppor tunity, and, with the support of the people of Shargah, proclaimed, himself Chief. 10. Shaikh Salim appealed to the Resident for advice and instructions, but the Resident, seeing no cause for British interference, replied to that efEe and instructed the native Agent at Shargah to maintain friendly relations with all parties,, and to avoid any active interference in party matters.ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 11. In May Her Majesty's Ship Woo visited Shargah and found all quiet .here, and negoeiations on foot between Shaikh Sakar and Salim. The new Chief had been recognized by the other Chiefs on the coast, and was supported by a body of the Na'eem tribe i nder their Shaikh Mohammed-bin-Ali. 12. Shaikh Salim was anxious that the Residency Agent should guarantee the fulfilment eoiKi -ons of an agreement between him and Shaikh Sakar, which, of course, the Agent re- tused : .u Various questions were raised about the Island of Boo Moosa, the horses thereon and so : orth, to which general answers were returned, and the rival Shaikhs were advised to come to an amicable arrangement. ai -.W 1 ' M ; ay Sllaikh Sa,im P aid a visit t0 Lingah, to consult with the Deputy Governor, Shaikh Yoosnf, who is of the same clan. Subsequently Shaikh Salim sent a number of horses from Boo Moosa to Lmgah. M. In .Inly Shaikh Salim having- gone to Debaye, an agreement was effected between him and his nephew, the fulfilment of the terms by either side being guaranteed by the Chiefs ot Kas-el-Khaimah and Debaye. Under this agreement Shaikh Sakar was to allow Shaik Salim a yearly allowance of 600 dollars, and the latter was to retain possession of his private lands and property j whilst Salim engaged to recognize and bear allegiance to Sakar. No mention was made m the agreement of the Shargah dependencies on the Batinah coast. 15 In January 1884, Shaikh Sakar addressed the Resident informing him that Shaikh Salim having failed to adhere to the terms of the treaty, the Chiefs of Ras-el-Khaimah and Debaye had declared themselves absolved from further responsibility in the matter. Shaikh Sakar stated that Shaikh Salim was residing on Boo Moosa, a possession of Shargah, and that it was to be feared this might lead to disturbances by sea. The Resident was asked to take security from Shaikh Salim, binding him not to break the maritime peace. 16. In reply. Resident informed Shaikh Sakar that he was sorry the agreement between him and Shaikh Salim had fallen through; that he did not apprehend any breach of the mari- time truce on Sahm's part, but that if he or others should infringe the rules relative to the sea they would be promptly repressed. 17. Up to the present the ex-Chief of Shargah continues to reside on the Island of Boo^ moosa. Shaikh Sakar governing Shargah. The condition of the dependencies on the Batinah coast is unsettled, and the situation generally cannot be regarded as stable, bui • • re are no signs of Shaikh Salim's cause improving in its prospects. Shaikh Sakar has aJ lie.! himself by marriage with the Chief of Ras-el-Khaimah. 18. The Chief of Abu Dhebbee had several affrays during the year with marauders of the tribes Al-Morrah, Monasir, and Beni Hajir. In August he asked assistance of the Chief of Debaye, who allowed his Bedouin dependants to join the Beni Yas. In October the combined forces defeated the Al-Morrah, killing about 30 and capturing some cattle. In October the Al- Morrah and Monasir made reprisals, and in November Shaikh Za'eed despatched a force of 750 men of various tribes as far as the vicinity of El-Obeyd, where they came on the Al- Morrah and killed 17 of that tribe, and captured over 1,000 camels. Other encounters occurred, but in December the Beni Yas Chief came to terms of peace with the Al-Morrah and other hostile tribes, 19. Heavy gales were experienced on the pirate coast in February and March last and several boats were wrecked. 20. A bad form of malarious fever prevailed during the year, causing many deaths. 21. The pearl-diving was fairly productive, and a new bank was discovered in three fathoms, south of Halool island. 3.—BAHRAIN. 22. The Bahrain islands have enjoyed perfect tranquillity during the year. 23. In June Shaikh Mubarik, of the tribe El-Sabah, one of the Kowait Shaikhs, came to Bahrain on a friendly visit to the Chiefs ; he was very warmly welcomed, hospitably treated, and received numerous pre -.at on leaving. Shaikh Mubarik is sometimes employed by the T irkish authorities in affairs rc n iring diplomatic action, but if his visit to Bahrain had any olyject beyond pleasure, it did no':, r- nspire. 24. In September Her Majesty's Ship WoodlarJc 1 wing cylled at Bahrain on her way to Bushire, Shaikh Eesa-bin-Ali expressed his wish to pay the Resident a visit at Bushire, and ( itain Nesham offered the Chief a parage across, which he accepted.EES1DENCT AJSTD MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 7 2-5. The object of Shaikh Eesa's visit was to make personal representations regarding le renewal of piracy in Turkish waters, and to ask permission to act, himself, against the ratical tribes : such action would have involved the landing of Bahrain men on territory under urkish occupation, and the Resident explained to Shaikh Eesa the ill-feeling and complications /hich such action would necessarily entail. The Chief was also told that the British Govern- nent was constantly urging the Turkish Government to take efficient measures to repress piracy, and the nature of the measures adopted by the Porte was explained. Shaikh Eesa saw jhe inexpediency of his acting in the manner proposed, and expressed himself quite satisfied ho leave the matter in the Resident's hands, for representation to Government. 26. In October the tribe El-Sadah inhabiting El-Hadd of Bahrain, becoming discontented on account of a quarrel with another tribe, and supposed failure of the Chief of Bahrain to do them justice, determined to emigrate to Darein in the Kateef district, and wrote to the Nakeeb at Busrah asking permission to do so, which was accorded. Subsequently, however, Shaikh Eesa dissuaded the tribe from carrying out their intention. 27. The pearl divers had fairly good success in 1883. 4.—-NEJD, EL-HASA, AND EL-KATR 28. Nejd. —Although the Government of the Porte appears to have been under the im pression that close relations existed between the British Government and the ' Ameer of Nejd,' the fact is that we have no direct communications with the interior of Nejd, and it is difficult to obtain trustworthy intelligence from that country. Hostilities were kept up between the A1 Su'ood family, of whom Abdullah-bin Feysal is Chief, and the Ameer of Jebel Shamar, Mohammed-ibn-Rasheed. Both sides appear to have had successes of no great importance, and the political condition of Nejd has not suffered any material change. 29. El-Hasa.—ln June a vessel of Bahrain was seized, some pirates of the Beni Hajir tribe, near El-Kateef, and in the affray the Bahrainee Nakhoda was wounded. He escaped to the shore, but subsequently died at Bahrain. Depositions attesting the facts of the case were prepared and a report of the occurrence forwarded through the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to Her Majesty's Ambassador at Constantinople, by whom a representation was made to the Porte. 30. El-Katr. —The Katr coast has been quiet, and Shaikh Jasin-bin-Mohammed Thanee, though somewhat discontented with his position, has given no cause for complaint. 31. Numerous copies of proclamations, issued in the name of Mohammed Ahmed, the soi-disant ' Mahdi' of Soudan, have been brought through Arabia to the shores of the Persian Gulf, and have attracted, of course, much attention. The wording of some of these circulars shadows forth the purpose of f ' the guided one' to lead his followers to the conquest of Egypt and Arabia. In the latter country there is reason to believe the ' Mahdi' would, if successful, have the support of large numbers of the population. As in Soudan, the sympathy with the « Maihdi' is at present more political than religious, the Arabs looking to him with some hope as the destined instrument who is to restore their independence. An element of religious fer vour is by no means wanting, which, according to circumstances, may either die out or be kindled into a flame. 5.—EARS. 32. No alteration has occurred in the chief administration of the province of Ears. His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan exercises chief control over all its districts, with the excep tion of Lingah and Bunder Abbass, which forts are placed under the Ameen-es-Sultan, who has now general control of the Customs Department throughout Persia. The Ameen-es- Sultan has an agent, Mohammed Hasan Khan, who is invested with authority over Bunder Abbass and Lingah, and also has general control of the Custom Houses at those ports and at Bushire. 33. Under His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, the titular Governor of Shiraz, is his son, the Jelal-ed-Dowlah, but he being too young to exercise authority, the actual administra tor of the Government of Ears is His Excellency the Sahib Diwan. 34. In December His Excellency the Kowwam-ul-Mulk, one of nost influential men in Ears, died rather suddenly, and the title has since been confer- ^ his son, Mohammed Reza Khan, who was Beygler-Begee, or Mayor of Shiraz. T' te Kowwam-ul-Mulk was brother of the Sahib Diwan, and had charge of some of the 1 uctive districts of Ears. His administration of them was singularly successful.8 ADMINISTRATION REPOET OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 35. In the month o£ December died also the ' Mushir-ul-Mulk,' who in former time was the all-powerful Wazeer of Ears. During his administration the Mushir acquired enormou- wealth and numerous villages and landed estates. He spent large sums in building bridges anc caravanserais on the Shiraz-Bushire road. The Kowwam-ul-Mulk and Mushir-ul-Mulk were bitter enemies, and it is commonly said that excitement caused by the welcome news of his rival's death hastened the death of the Kowwam. 36. In August it was reported from Shiraz that some Indian pilgrims had been plundered by highway robbers near Dehbeed. The Government of Shiraz disavowed responsibility, the district being beyond the limits of Fars, and the matter was referred to -His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, with what result is not known. 37. A few other cases of highway robbery occurred near Shiraz. 38. Small-pox raged with great virulence in Shiraz during the autumn. 39. Mr. J. R. Preece, Assistant Superintendent of the English Government telegraph, examined the route from Shiraz to Bunder Abbass and Jask in February, in view to the possible construction of a line of telegraph between those places. 40. A French engineer surveyed the Shiraz-Firozabad-Bushire route in connection with a project for construction of a line of railway between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf. 41. Bushire. —Mirza Mohammed Hoosain Khan, son of the Sahib Diwan, was appointed Governor of Bushire in succession to the Naseer-ul-Mulk, and arrived in June. 42. The wealthiest Persian merchant of Bushire, Haji Babaf died in May, and his grand son and heir, Haji Mohammed Mehdi, received the titles of Malek-ut-Toojar and Rais-ut-Toojar. 43. In January Mirza Mohammed Hoosain Khan, Governor of Bushire, was summoned to Shiraz in view to his accompanying His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan to Teheran. Halji Fazl Ali Khan, son-in-law of Mohammed Hoosain Khan, was sent to act as Deputy Governor of Bushire. 44. In April the period during which exportation of grain was allowed was extended, and the interdict was re-imposed in August. In February it was again removed for a period of :■ months. 45. The revenues of Lingah and Bunder Abbas were managed respectively by Shaikh Yoosuf and Mohammed Hasan-bin-Nasir, both of whom act as Deputies for Mohammed Hasan Khan, the Ameen-es-Sultan's agent. 46. Shaikh Hassan-bin Mazkoor, son of the Khan of Kongoon, who was executed at Shiraz by the Motemir-ed-Dowlah, has fled to Bahrain. In April 1883 he landed at Tahri and caused considerable disturbances in the Gillahdar and adjacent districts, and Fath Ali Khan Gerrashee, Governor of Lar, was ordered to act against him. Some Persian infantry and a body of Baharloo Irregular Cavalry accordingly proceeded to those districts. Hasan-bin- Mazkoor, however, fled and escaped. Subsequently, further disturbances occurred in Gillahdar and Gaobandee from the people refusing to receive a new governor, named Naib Ibrahim Khan, one Ahmed-bin-Saif being the ringleader. 47. Naib Ibrahim having proceeded to Jam with a force of sowars and infantry to suppress a revolt there, serious resistance was made by the people of Jam, and in the affray several of the Baharloo sowars were killed. On this the Persian infantry and the sowars blundered Jam. Subsequently some thirty or forty men of Jam were seized as being guilty of the bloor of the Baharloo sowars, and made over bound to the Baharloos, by whom they were :ut to ] A large quantity of camels, sheep, and donkeys, &amp;c., were taken from the people of Jam. 48 A severe - - 'thquake occurred on 16th October on the Persian coast which was felt at Bushire, Kongoo &gt;, Tahri, &amp;c. Much damage was done at Kongoon and other coast villages, where i 'nued to be felt until October 24th. lingah and bunder abbass. coast between bush i re and lingah. PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 49.

The town is the most populous one in Arabistan, though fallen into decay, and numbers some 12,000 inhabitants. The revenue of town and district amounts to 400,000 krans. 50. MuhammeraJi, —Muhammerah, with its dependent districts, is governed by Shaikh Mizal, whose elder brother, Mohammed, is still detained at Isphahan. Shaikh Mizal seems to have succeeded fairly well in establishing his authority. 51. In May 1883 the Prince Ihtishan-es-Saltanah arrived at Muhammerah with a regiment of Sirbaz, 53, In August the Nasar tribe of Arabs, a branch of the Beni Ka'b, revolted against Shaikh Mizal Khan, and shut themselves up in a mud fort, which Shaikh Mizal besieged. Eventually, after some casualties on both sides, the Hasan submitted and came to terms. This success greatly strengthened Shaikh Mizal Khan's position and led to establishment of tranquil lity and good order in his districts. 53. The revenue paid by Shaikh Mizal to the Persian Government for the Muhammerah district is 450,000 krans. 54. It was proposed to establish a Custom House at Muhammerah under Persian manage ment, and the Sa^ad-ul-Mulk visited Muhammerah in view to arranging the matter. This was, of course, a very distasteful project to the Arabs, and Shaikh Mizal succeeded in having it abandoned for the present. 55.

Skushter, —The town of Shushter, formerly an important one and excellently situated, is now in rains. The Governor is Mirza Asadullah Khan, and the revenue of town and district is 230,000 krans. 60. During the year the notorious sirteep Ibrahim Khan, of Bam, was reinstated as Governor of Bampoor and Persian Beloochistan, and from all districts there came reports of distress, the population emigrating in numbers to India and elsewhere. 61. The claims (referred to in last yearns report) at Charbar for losses caused by the mis conduct of troops under Meer Hoosain Khan of Sirbas were, after firm pressure had been brought to bear by Her Majesty^s Minister at the Court of Persia, paid in full by the Gover nor of Kirman. 62. The Persian authorities of Kirman denied the truth of the Report of the murder of an Indian in Baho, mentioned in last report, but further investigation was promised. 63. The Chiefs of Baho and Dashtyaree were reinstated in their districts, but Meer Deen Mohammed, Chief of Dashtyaree, was fined 6,000 tomans, and had to give his sons as hostao-es or security for payment. He himself went on a begging tour to •'Oman and Sind to raise money to pay the fine. 64. Some annoyances were caused to the Telegraph employes in the district of Meer Hotee, Chief , of Gaih, and steps were taken to compel that Chief to afford satisfaction. 65. In January Major E. Mockler proceeded from Busrah on special duty to Mekran to meet Colonel Sir Eobert Sandeman, whose Mission reached Gwadur in February. 66. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, Political Agent at Muscat, also visited Gwadur in Her Majesty's Ship Dragon in February. 67. Mr. B.

On 7th June a north-westerly gale set in, lasting three days. During the period from 14th May to 10th July the weather, owing to the seasonable ' Barih/' or Arabian monsoon, was comparatively cool for the time of year. After the latter date a month or so of very trying weather was experienced. 76. The autumn and winter rains were unusually heavy, 19| inches having fallen up to April. An unprecedentedly abundant harvest was anticipated, but late and unseasonable rain caused a partial blight. 77.

PoUiicak— N&lt; o; -iug h&amp;d. oeeaiTed during the early part of the year 1883 to disturb the general tranquility o ! Oinan, 1 the official year 1883-84 opened favourably. In M ay the i:-hiq attempted, to renew negoeiations with Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir of the Beni Hma through vn r,mediation of Hamood-el-Jahafee for the surrender of the fort at Nezwa, which Hilal nad pr&lt;.? v i i bef ore to deliver up for a certain sum, but nothing came out of it, and the fort still re . jssession of Hilal. The quarrel that had arisen in the previous year between the ? . r v- yeen and Rehbiyeen on the one side, and the Beni Jabir on the other, aborai tVt© village of Seroor, now broke out afresh, and, in view of the behaviour of the former tribes, the Sultan began to consider whether the subsidy they received for holding the passes should not be trar ferred to the Beni Jabir. Shaikh ; . cd-el-Jahafee sided with the Nidabiyeen in this affair, and His Highness endeavours to entice him into Muscat, where he intended to seize him. But Hamood was stopped ' Senaii, and the plot failed. Offers of money were then made to induce Hamood to rf: e, but ijvjr were refused: shortly after, however, Hamood, after unsuccessfully raiding 1? 1 Beni Jabir, returned to Sharkiyeh. In the meantime the Beni Jabir, aided by a contin- o t from Nakhl, occupied the Nidabiyeen houses in Seroor and cut down their date trees, and ho latter were compelled to sue for a truce. At the end of June the Sultan received letters from His Highness Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali, openly declaring their intention of assisting the Nidabiyeen against the Be Jabir, whereupon, to avoid further complications and to put an end to the quarrel. His Hi nness despatched messengers to Semail to summon the Shaikhs of the Nidabiyeen, Rehbi- s en, Siabiyeen, and Beni Jabir to Muscat with a view to the final and amicable settlement of ^he whole question. On the 6th July, however, the Envoys returned to Muscat unsuccessful and reported that the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen Shaikhs had gone to Sharkiyeh. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee now despatched Shaikh Shamis to his brother Abdul Azeez, desiring him to prevent any rising in the Sharkiyeh, to which Seyyid Abdul Azeez replied that the Rehbiyeen Shaikh had gone with the Haboos to Saleh-bin-Ali to concert an attack on the Beni Jabir, but, as regards himself, he would not interfere if his brother Toorkee desired it. It is now well known that this quarrel about Seroor had been carefully fomented and increased, almost from the first, by the intrigues of Shaikh Saleh, whose subtle mind had perceived that if he could separate the two tribes holding the passes between Sharkiyeh and Muscat from allegiance to the Sultan he would have gained an important advantage in the event of his being able to organize another rising against His Highness. Not only did he succeed in this, but' he managed to make the quarrel itself the pretext for his rebellious proceedings subsequently. The Beni Jabir now expecting an attack by the Sharkiyeh tribes applied to the Sultan for reinforcements, and His Highness prepared to move out to Semail in person. But from this he was dissuaded, and shortly after the Nidabiyeen wrote in to say that they would no longer receive His Highnesses subsidy or hold the passes for him. In July a collision occurred at Barka between the Wahabee garrison and the town^s people, resulting in two men being killed and six wounded. The town^s people having been worsted called in the aid of the Ma^Awalees, who came down and besieged the fort. The Wazeer Seyyid-Saeed, however, was despatched to Barka in the I)ar-el-Salem, and effected a satis factory adjustment of the affair. Early in August it was reported in Muscat that a rising would certainly take place (after the Ramzan E'ed) of the Hinawi tribes in Sharkiyeh to support the Nidabiyeen against the Beni Jabir, and it was expected that the insurgents would not confine themselves to the Semail valley, but continue their march to Muscat. On the 14th August news arrived that Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh, with a large force, had reached the Akk Pass, and two days later His Highness received letters from his brother and Saleh-bin Ali, announcing their intention of coming on to Muscat. Preparations were accordingly made for defence, and the friendly tribes were being called in when news arrived, on the 20th, of t he break-up of the coalition and return o ( ' ohe insurgents to Sharkiyeh. 3r- ■ 18 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL I Shaikh. Saleli wrote a pacific letter to His Highness to the effect that Seyyid Abdul Azeez and himself, having: summoned the Semail tribes, had made peace between them, and that, their object being- thus accomplished, they were returning'home. A similar letter from Seyyid Abdul Azeez was also received. But the rebel leaders were dissimulating and their pretended friendly action in tranquillizing the tribes and withdrawing their mei3 masked an ulterior design. Their apparent abandonment of the enterprise, as later events showed, was intended to throw His Highness off his guard and to mature their plans while watching for a more favourable opportunity. s On the 'Sth September Seyyid Feysal was despatched to Nakh to settle disputes among the Shaikhs at that town, and about the same time Seyyid Nasir-bin-Mohammed, Wali of Mattrah, was employed to adjust misunderstandings among the Beni B&amp;ttash in the Wady Taeen. Both of these missions were successful. So far from the discord iiV the Semail valley having been removed by Shaikh Saleh it had, in fact, become greatly embittered and strength- ened, as he had hoped and intended it should, and the Sultan, being aware of the danger of the continuance of this quarrel, now sent for the Shaikhs of the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen to Muscat, and used strenuous efforts to restore harmony between them and the Eeni Jabir. Seyyid Feysal was subsequently sent to Semail to use his influence with the malcontents there, but his efforts, like those of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, met with an entire want of success. The teaching and machinations of Shaikh Saleh had been too effective j the Nidabiyeen Shaikhs refused to listen to any terms and remained irreconcileable. The rebel leaders meanwhile were not idle. On the approach of Seyyid Feysal to Semail, Shaikh Saleh, with Abdul Azeez, entered the upper end of the valley to counteract his pacific schemes and to prevent any combination of the Ghaffiree tribes in that quarter. Shaikh Saleh was also indefatigable at this time in writing letters to the Hinawi tribes, inciting them to rise,. and Shaikh Jumah-el-Meskeri, who had joined Shaikh Saleh out of a personal grudge he had against His Highness, wrote to the Shaikhs of the Ghaffiree tribes of Jaalan and ''Oman, warning them not to join Seyyid Toorkee in his defence againt the coalition. Shaikh Jumah's letters had in many cases an opposite effect to what he intended, as Arabs are not fond of being dictated to, and several of the Ghafiiree Shaikhs subsequently supported His Highness out of pure opposition to Shaikh Jumah. Rumours of the rising reached Muscat, and some preparations were made to repel attack. But the rebels^ intentions were not known for certain until the 19th October, when the Political Agent received a letter from Seyyid Abdul Azeez, announcing his hostile intentions and desir ing that the British subjects might be removed from danger. On the morning of the 21st the vanguard of the rebel force, estimated at 1,800 men, arrived at Rui, and the main body came up during the day. It was fully expected by the garrison that the enemy would rest that, night in camp and attack Mattrah the next day. But Seyyid Abdul Azeez had devised a more skilful plan, and, while he was supposed to be encamped at Rui he was marching through the hills that encircle Muscat to take the town by surprise. The assault was delivered soon after mid night by the rebels, who were dressed in black to escape observation, and, though the garrison were taken completely by surprise, they received the assailants with such a heavy and sustained fire that the latter were repulsed and driven from the walls with great loss. Seyyid Abdul Azeez behaved with much gallantry, personally leading his men up to the assault, but he was compelled to withdraw when he found the surprise had failed. The next day it was expected that an attack on Mattrah would be made, and, as His Highness had formally requested armed assistance, H. M. S. Fhilomel proceeded thither and threw a couple of shells over the rebels' position, deterring them from advance. For three days after the rebels main tained their position outside the town, threatening attack, and H. M. S. Philomel con tinued an irregular fire at intervals ; but, in the meantime, the friendly tribes summoned by His Highness to his assistance began to pour into Muscat and soon outnumbered those on the offensive. Seyyid Abdul Azeez and Shaikh Saleh, who had made certain of victory, then retired with their discomfited force, which had lost in the attack about 100 killed and 150 wounded, to Sharkiyeh. His Highness now determined to make use of the large body of Arabs who had responded to his call for assistance, of whom there were now about 3,000 in the town, and des patched an expedition into the Semail valley to chastise the two disloyal Ghaffiree tribes who had been the primary cause of these disorders and who had assisted Shaikh Saleh in his inva sion. The force was under the command of Seyyid Feysal-bin-Toorkee, and soon brought the Nidabiyeen and Rehbiyeen to submission, after punishing them by cutting down part of their date groves. Seyyid Feysal, under instructions from the Sultan, then marched to the Wady Ma'Awal, where he reduced that tribe, which had long been disaffected, to sub- ■1RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 19 mission also, and brouglit the Shaikh a prisoner to Muscat. The repulse o£ the rebel force from Muscat and the subsequent operations of Seyyid FeysaFs expedition have completely restored His Highness Seyyid Toorkee^s prestige and have had a tranquillizing effect on the country. The Political Agent proceeded on tour to the Kooria Mooria islands and Dhofar on the 7th November and returned to Muscat on the 26th in H. M. S. 'Philomel. In November Shaikh Bargash, the Temeemeh of the Beni Ghaffir tribe, and a man of some importance, was murdered at Bahila by his two brothers, who stabbed him while he was asleep and then seized the fort. Notwithstanding his late reverse Shaikh Saleh did not desist from in triguing among the tribes and endeavouring to organise another rising against the Sultan. He tried first with the Hejrieen, and then with the Beni Boo Hassan, but failed to induce them to engage in hostilities, and he has since remained tolerably quiet. In February some disturbances arose in Jaalan and a conflict took place between the Beni Boo Hassan and Beni Rasib tribes, in which five men were slain. By the Sultan's intervention a truce was subsequently effected between the parties. Shaikh Nasir-bin-Mohammed-el M a' Awalee, who had been confined by the Sultan at Muscat since his seizure by Seyyid Feysal, was released in this month on payment of arrears of taxes due by him and by a ransom of 8,000 dollars. He was then allowed to return to his country. On the 17th March Shaikh Rashid-bin Hameyd of the Beni Ghaffir was murdered at Bahila by his brother, Nasir. Four months before these two had treacherously killed their elder brother, Bargase, and now the youngest, being eager to get sole possession of the chieftainship and family property, had taken the opportunity to put the second brother out of the way by shooting him in the back while they were riding together. In this month the Bedouins of Dahireh raided part of the Batineh and carried off a quan tity of booty. Official changes. —In April 1883 Major E.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF THE LATE SEYYID SA'EED-BIN-SULTAN IMAM OF MUSCAT, BY LIEUTENANT-COLONEL S. B. MILES. The sudden and premature termination of the career of the Ruler of ''Oman, Sultan-bin- Ahmed in Nqvember 1804, after a reign of ten years, was a calamity to his country. An able and sagacious politician, and strong enough to maintain fair order among his turbulent people, he was well qualified to guide his country through the troublous times on which it had fallen, and, usurper though he wks, he had come to be universally recognised by all parties as their fittest leader. His death was a signal for rivalries and intestine disorders of all kinds, which, after a struggle of three years' duration, were to result in the power falling to the youngest of the many claimants. According to the Arab custom the succession to Chieftainship is ruled by the interests and requirements of the people, rather than by the individual rights of members of the family in which the dignity may be hereditary. This leads to disputed successions, and it usually happens that the longest sword elects the prince. On this occasion the question was complicated by the recency of the dynasty. Barely thirty years had elapsed since the founder had died, leaving a number of descendants, each of whom could fairly claim, as each doubtless deemed himself the fittest for the succession. The situation of the various aspirants to power was briefly as follows :— The Imam Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed had left seven sons, of whom Hilal, the eldest, was already dead, having succumbed to the climate of Sind some years before, leaving a son named Ali, now about thirty years of age. The second and now eldest surviving son, Sa'eed, had been elected Imam on the death of his father in 1775, but, having become unpopular and almost imbecile had resigned power to his son Hamed, on whose death in 1792 it had been usurped by Sultan. Kais, the third son, had been appointed Wali of Sohar by his father, an appointment which had been confirmed by Sa'eed. Being the most active and ambitious of Ahmed's surviving child ren, he took up arms immediately on hearing of Sultan's death, and was first in the field, Seyf, the fourth son, had died in Africa, leaving a son named Bedr, who had rebelled against his uncle Sultan, and who was now to become for a time the de facto ruler. Talib, the sixth son, was residing at Eostak with the Imam Sa'eed, and Mohammed, the youngest, was Wali of Soweyk. The youngest of the competitors were the children of Sultan, of whom, the eldest, Salim, was now barely fifteen, and as they had nothing in their favour but the prestige acquired by their father and the possession of Muscat, which had been made by Sultan the capital in place of Rostak, their chances of success were by no means promising. When starting on his Busrah expedition, in which he lost his life. Sultan had appointed Mohammed-bin-Nasir-bin-Mohammed Eljabri regent and guardian of his sons, and on Moham med now devolved the conduct of affairs on their behalf. He saw at once that he was not in a position to assume the offensive, and that he had no resource but to remain quiet and en deavour to hold the capital against attack. He busied himself, therefore, in putting Muscat and Mattrah into a state of defence, and in calling in the friendly Ghaffiree tribes of Nakhl and Dhabireh to his assistance. The news of Sultan's death had spread rapidly through the country, and Kais, at once resolving to make a bold stroke for power, which he expected to be able to dash from the hands of his nephews without difficulty, lost no time in collecting his forces. In conjunction with his brother Mohammed he marched along the Batineh to Muscat, took Khabooreh on the way, and skirting Mesnaah and Barka moved on to Mattrah, which, being but faintly dffended, he soon made himself master of. His success gained him friends, and Mohammed Nasir finding his position becoming desperate, sued for terms and offered to re linquish Khaboor )h to Kais, and grant him a monthly allowance of dollars 2,000, if he would retire. The terms were refused. Kais, deeming his chance of success good, continued the con test and maintained his hold on Mattrah. From this position Mohammed Nasir could not dislodge him, and, with the advice of Sultan's sister, Moza, and other adherents, he decided to call in the aid of Bedr-bin-Seyf. Bedr was Salim's cousin. His father Seyf had intrigued against the Imam Sa'eed, but unsuccessfully, and, having resolved to try his fortunes in East Africa, set out, with a small lowing, for Zanzibar in the year 1784. The Wali of that town.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 21 Khalfan-bin-Ahmed, having refused to surrender the fort, Seyf laid siege to it and would pro bably have compelled it to yield, had not Hamed, who had been despatched by his father, Sauced, on an expedition to extend and consolidate his African possession, arrived in time to raise the siege. Seyf then retired to Lamoo, where he died. Bedr appears to have inherited his father's stern and ambitious character. No sooner had he reached manhood than he imitated his schemes. In 1803, while Sultan 'was absent on pilgrimage, Bedr entered Muscat in disguise, and endpavoured by stratagem to get possession of Fort Jelali: the plot, however, was discovered by a Baman, who reported it to the Wali, and Bedr fled to Zobara, where he put himself under the protection of the Wahabees and embraced their tenets. He proceeded subsequently to El-Derayeh to obtain aid from the Amir against Sultan, and, on his return from Nejd with a promise of support, heard of Sultan's death and received the invitation from Salim and his ad visers to join them at Muscat. Bedr, feeling confident that if he could once make good his foot ing in Muscat he would be able, eventually, to supplant his cousins, and secure the supremacy without incurring the risk and unpopularity of an open contest for power under Wahabee auspices, eagerly accepted the proposal and set out for 'Oman. He arrived at a critical juncture. Kais was strengthening his position, and the hopes of Sultan's sons were growing fainter and fainter, when Bedr's energy came to their aid and reversed the situation. Bedr at once called in his friends the Wahabees, and the Wahabee leader, willing to facilitate the accession to power of Bedr in the hope that he would thus become bound to them more closely, despatched a force against Sohar. This diversion had its intended effect. Kais was compelled to make terms with Bedr and hasten home. The conditions were that Kais should withdraw his claims to sovereignty and retain as his share Khabooreh and part of the Batineh as additions to his appenage of Sohar. The peace proved a hollow affair, and was but of short duration. A month later Kais found a pretext to renew hostilities and marched on Muscat, which he captured and plundered. He was unable, however, to retain his position there, and, fearing the approach of Grhaffiree reinforce ments to Bedr, was glad to retire with the addition of Mattrah to his former acquisitions, and an allowance of one thousand dollars a month. By this time the rivalship of the other uncles and cousins had melted away before the vigorous measures of Bedr, and Kais alone remained to contend with him for supremacy in the field. Before a year had elapsed Bedr had clearly made himself master of the situation in 'Oman and had begun to show his hand as regards his designs against his young cousins, Salim and Sa'eed, whom he had in fact already excluded from Muscat by sending Salim as Wali to Mesna'ab and Sa'eed to Barka. Bedr's designs in all probability were not penetrated by Salim, who seems to have accepted his position con tentedly enough, but the more subtle and ambitious Sa'eed winced at the way in which he had been set aside and harboured revenge. On the death of Sultan advantage had been taken of the general confusion occasioned by the disputed succession by Moolla Hoossein-el Maeeni, Shaikh of Kishm, to assault and capture Bunder Abbass, and, his hands being free for the time, Bedr now sailed for that port with the object of recovering it. Captain Seton, the British Resident in the Gulf, who had been engaged in blockading the Kowasim pirates, accompanied him with two armed vessels, and succeeded in re-establishing Bedr in possession of the place, in return for which service certain concessions were granted by Bedr to the English. This happened in the autumn of 1805, and Bedr had no sooner returned to 'Oman than he found himself again involved in hostilities with Kais. In making his third and final at., mpt on Muscat Kais procured the support of Moolla Hoosein of Kishni and of the Kowasim, and was allowed to occupy and plunder the outskirts of the town unopposed. Bedr pursued his old tactics of inducing the Wahabees to threaten Sohar, while the young Sa'eed raided and recovered Bidbid and Fauja. The result of the campaign was disastrous to Kais' hopes; he found he had miscalculated his strength and had no alternative but to purchase peace by surrendering Mattrah and his allowance, and retreating to Sohar. Since the death of Sultan, who alone had offered anything like a successful resistance to them, Oman had fallen into a state of subjection to the Wahabees, whose preponderating influence in the country was now complete. The payments of tribute had be ' i forced upon Sultan, but Bedr had for his own aggrandisement submitted to further hnmili tions, and the 'Omanis were galled at witnessing his submission to the dictation of the Wahabee Agent at Muscat. A force of 400 mounted Wahabees had been stationed at Barka in the time of Sultan to overawe the neighbouring country, and was still maintained there, whilst, in addition, the observance of the Wahabee tenet and strict attendance at prayers were now everywhere enforced. The growing strength, pretensions, and aggressive behaviour of the Wahabees had created22 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL a wide-spread feeling of discontent and consternation in the country, and Bedr, who was looked upon by all as the chief cause of their humiliating prostration before the invaders, was very unpopular. The young Sa^eed had long cherished feelings of envy and resentment against Bedr, and, prompted doubtless , by his associates, he resolved at length to make an effort to recover possession of Muscat and to rid himself and country of one who was now a rival and an enemy. To oppose his cousin in the field, however, was out of the question; it offered no prospect of success, and no alternative appeared to remain but assassination. Mohammed-bin- Nasir El Jabri was the person to whom Sa^eed naturally turned for aid in the affair, and it was proposed that Mohammed should proceed to Muscat and dispose of Bedr as he best could. Mohammed, however, was fearful of incurring the vengeance of the A1 Bu Sa'eedis, and declined the enterprise, but he did not refuse to assist in arranging the plot that led to the tragedy of Bedr's death. There are four or five versions of this transaction, and no two Arabs agree in the details, but it seems clear that Bedr was enticed to Barka, and was attacked by Sa'eed during an interview at Na'aman, a village about 4 miles distant. Supported by Mohammed Nasir and his guard, Sa'eed stabbed Bedr, who defended himself bravely and managed to escape from the house, but was overtaken and slain. The Wahabee force at Barka were indignant at the murder and demanded the punishment of the offenders, and Sa^eed was mean and ungrateful enough to throw the blame on Mohammed Nasir. The Wahabees, however, were in danger of being attacked by the excited people, and deemed it prudent to quit the country and retire to Bereymee. Sa'eed immediately set sail for Muscat, sending word of the occurrence to his brother, Salim, who had remained quietly at Mesnaah, and had not been concerned in the murder. This event, which occurred in March 1807, was the turning point in Sa^eed^s career, and placed him at once above all competitors. The deed, so far from being reckoned a crime and reprobated, was applauded throughout 'Oman ; Sa'eed was recog nised and acknowledged on all sides as gifted with true Arab courage and instincts, and as one well fitted to hold the reins of power; he was hailed as the deliverer of his country from the hand of one who had turned renegade and who had been in league with their invaders. Among the first to approve the deed and acknowledge Sa^eed's fitness to govern was Kais, who henceforward admitted his supremacy. Sa'eed was soon joined by Salim, and it was arranged that the two brothers should rule conjointly—an arrangement that was carried out with fraternal affection and without rivalry until Salim's death. Salim was now 18, having been born in 1789 ; he was of a mild and studious disposition and had little energy, but was not wanting in courage and capacity; Sa^eed was a year younger; his mother was Ghanee, a daughter of Khalfan-bin-Mohammed El Wahull Ab Bu Sa^eedi, and, besides his having thus a better title by descent than Salim, whose mother was of a different tribe, his high spirit and energetic character indicated him as more peculiarly fitted to take the lead. This he did from the first, as we shall see, and he must be looked on hereafter as the ruling spirit in the government. The first act of Sa'eed, who dreaded the vengeance of the Wahabees for the murder of their ally, was to write to the Amir Saood and exculpate himself from the suspicions that attached to him. He accused Mohammed Nasir of the crime, declared him a rebel, and requested the Wahabees' aid in attacking him. Sa'eed promised to fulfil all the engagements entered into by Bedr as to tribute, &amp;c., to receive again the Wahabee guard of 400 men at Barkah, and to observe the Wahabee tenets. This letter, which was accompanied with handsome presents, was despatched by a special messenger. The Amir Saood was not deceived by Sa'eed's words. He had been fully apprised by his agents at Muscat of the particulars of the transaction and of the part that Sa'eed had played in it. Saood, however, to conceal his intentions, wrote a pacific reply, apparently accepting Sa'eed's excuses and deprecating action against Mohammed Nasir. The dynastic change and the conduct of Sa'eed appear to have been viewed with disfavour by the British authorities, and Sa'eed began to dread lest he should be left alone in the encounter which he knew was to come with the Wahabees. Sa'eed, who had been impressed by the Napo leonic wars and successes in Europe, was thus led to turn his attention to the renewal of political relations with the French, which had been relinquished by Sultan at the request of the British Government. Since the futile mission of M. Cavaignac in the Atalanta frigate in 1803 the only intercourse had been the occasional purchase by Sultan and Bedr of English prizes captured and sold at Mauritius by the French. Sa'eed, determined on seeking French alliance, now despatched Majid -bin-Khulfan as envoy on a mission to that island to renew the relations which had formerly existed. This mission resulted in a treaty being concluded between Sa'eed and General DeCaen on the 15th June 1807. French influence was now in the ascendant at Muscat for a brief period. In July 1808 a fresh treaty was concluded, the firstBESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 23 one not having been found satisfactory, and M. Dallons was sent to Muscat as Consular Agent. Two years later, however. Bourbon and Mauritius capitulated: English influence became again firmly and finally re-established, and the Indian Ocean remained from that date to the peace of 1815 a mare clausum to the French. By this time the audacity and power of the piratical Kowasim had increased to such an extent that they had become as great a scourge to ^Oman by sea as the Wahabees were by land, and the trade of Muscat was seriously interrupted. With the object of checking them in some degree. Sauced, in concert with his uncle Kais, undertook an expedition against Khor Fahan, where the Kowasim had formed a piratical station. In May 1808 Sauced sailed with a flotilla for that fort, where he was joined by Kais, and, after a sharp conflict the fort was carried by assault and the garrison put to the sword. News of Sa'eed's arrival, however, had been rapidly carried to Ras-el-Khaimah, and Shaikh Sultan hastened to the relief of the place, where he arrived after the massacre of the garrison. He had but a small force with him, yet be easily vanquished Sa'eed's troops and compelled them to fly. Kais was killed in the fight. The troubles of Sa'eed were now gathering thick upon him. Young and inexperienced as he was, for he was now only in his 19th year, he would have succumbed before the prospect of carrying on the struggle with such formidable enemies as now surrounded him, had he not been sustained by an indomitable spirit of self-reliance. The Wahabees had now arrived at the plenitude of their power. The Amir Saood had determined upon completing the conquest of ''Oman, and had announced his intention of personally leading an army to Muscat. The system hitherto pursued by him in 'Oman was one of terrorism. He maintained a Political Agent at Muscat and a strong garrison at Bereymee, the frontier town of 'Oman towards Nejd, and it was from this point that his expedition started when hostilities arose. These excursions were invariably attended by ruthless massacres and barbarities, and the dread they inspired was sufficient usually to keep the whole country in a state of abject prostration. In this plight the cup of humiliation for the 'Omanis was, therefore, nearly full, but they were now threatened with yet greater evils, viz., the direct administration and occupation of the land, and the effacement of the Ibodhi doctrines in favour of those of their oppressors. The 'Oman tribes, however, Sa'eed well knew, had no intention of tamely abandoning their religion, and were ready to respond to any call he might make on them. At this time an episode occurred which enraged Sa'eed's enemies and gave the Wahabee Ameer the pretext he sought for re-opening hostilities. Shaikh Mohammed-bin-Nasir El Jabri, whom Sa'eed had denounced to Saood as the murderer of Bedr, and who was now in possession of Semail, was lured to Muscat and treacherously imprisoned. Sa'eed's object in this was the recovery of the forts of Semail and Bidbid, which he wrested from Mohammed as the price of his liberty. Bitterly resenting this treatment, Mohammed Nasir, who was now as full of animosity towards Sa'eed as he had formerly been full of loyalty and devotion, made his way to El Derayeh, where he sought the aid and protection of Saood. The latter had already, as we have seen, contemplated leading a force to act against Muscat, and now, adopting Mohammed Nasir's cause with alacrity, he despatched his best General, Mutlah El Mutairy, with the advance of his army to 'Oman. In the meantime Sa'eed had undertaken an expedition against the Kowasim pirates, and in April 1809 had set out with a fleet to Ras-el-Khaimah to act in con junction. with a force from Bushire. Sa'eed's allies in the Gulf, however, failed to co -operate; his fleet became dispersed, and he was at one time in a critical situation. The Cornwalis* and another frigate, sent from India to support him, swept the Gulf and captured a number of pirates, who were taken to Bombay, only, however, to be immediately released. Sa'eed returned to Muscat, unable to boast of any satisfactory achievement. The depredations of the Kowasim upon British and Indian commerce in the Gulf had long attracted the attention of the Indian Government, and the necessity had at length been impressed on them of suppressing these piracies. A further consideration that appears to have influenced Government was the defenceless condition of 'Oman in regard to the expected Wahabee invasion, the success of which was anticipated to be injurious to British interests. An opinion prevailed that the Kowasim were urged on in their maritime outrages; by the Wahabees, and it was argued that the suppression of the pirates would act as a cheel on their fanatical instigators. The expedition sailed from Bombay in September 1809, and was com manded by Colonel Smith. It rendezvoused at Muscat to procure the co-operation of Sa'eed, and then proceeded to Eas-el-Khaimah, which was captured and burnt , and all its war vessels destroyed. On the return of the expedition to Muscat, Sa'eed solif^'ed the aid of Colonel Smith against Shinas and Khor Fakan, and a joint expedition sa;': . or the Batineh coast, where the troops landed, stormed and captured Shinas after a cbsp at; resistance on the 4th24 ADMINISTEATION' EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL January 1810. During this campaign Mutlak-el-Mutairy, who had been despatched from Nejd with the advance of the Wahabee army, had arrived with Mohammed Nasir at Bereymee, from whence on hearing of the British expedition he hastened to the aid of the Kowasim at Has-el- Khaimah. Being too late for that affair, he moved across to Shinas, which he reached just after its fall. For three days the small British force awaited the Wahabee onslaught, but Mutlak declined an engagement until Colonel Smith had embarked his troops, when he immediately attacked the ''Omanis, and with such vigour that he completely routed them. On the depar ture of the British, Sa'eed remained at Sohar, which Mutlak, after pillaging the country around and massacring the inhabitants in revenge for the attack on Shinas, began to invest. Sa^eed attempted negociations but failed; he was, nevertheless, soon able to compel Mutlak to raise the siege, and the latter then proceeded with Mohammed Nasir to Semail, which very shortly sur rendered to him. Sa'eed, returning to Muscat, strengthened the forts in the Batineh still remaining to him, but the Wahabees were expecting reinforcements and were indeed already masters of the position. In these straits he was strongly advised by the French Consul, M. Dallons, to compromise with Mutlak, but, trusting in eventual aid from Bombay, Sa'eed declined this advice. The Wahabees now raided 'Oman and harried the inhabitants at will, but Mutlak had evidently found their subjugation a tougher task than he had anticipated. On the other hand, Sa'eed's endeavours to rid the country of its foes were unavailing; his utmost efforts were only equal to maintaining his own independence. He was unable either to assume the offensive against the invaders or to contend with them in the field, and when, in April of the following year 1811, Sa'eed, after repulsing Mutlak from the walls of Muscat, ventured to give him battle in the Ma'Awal valley, he suffered a disastrous defeat. On several occasions Sa'eed sent appealing letters and envoys to the Bombay Government praying for armed intervention and support against his enemies, representing that his alliance with the British in the late campaign had incensed the ^Vahabees against him and made them implacable in their enmity. The request, however, was not complied with, as Government considered it impolitic to offend the Wahabees or to undertake hostilities against them. Sa'eed then turned his attention to Persia. It was arranged that his brother Salim should proceed to Fars and request aid from the Governor-General of that Province. Provided with suitable presents, Salim accordingly made his way to Shiraz, where the influence of Pishkush procured him the promised assistance of 1,500 men. Accompanied by this auxiliary force under the command of Saadi Khan, Salim returned to Muscat early in 1812, and operations were at once renewed against the Wahabees. In the meantime Sa'eed, taking advantage of the Egyptian successes over the Wahabees in Western Arabia, which had compelled the latter to concentrate their forces, despatched his cousin, Hilal-bin-Hamad, against Zobara, and El Bahrein. The expedition was partially suc cessful, and the Wahabee agent, Abdulla-bin-Ufeysan taken prisoner, but no advantage resulted to Sa'eed. The operations undertaken against the Wahabees on the arrival of the Persian con- tingent were conducted by Salim, who, in conjunction with Azzan-bin-Kais and Saadi Khan, marched against the Wahabees at Nakhl and obliged them to retire to Zikki; Semail also fell • but unadvisedly pursuing their successes too far, Salim and his Persians were completely routed by Mutlak at Zikki and driven back to Barka. Mutlak took his revenge by raiding and devastating the Sharkiyeh as far as E-as-el-Had, leaving a bloody track behind him. In the following year Sa'eed made preparations for a second expedition against Eas-el-Khaimah for the purpose of reinstating the Kowasim Shaikh, Sultan-bin-Sakar. This Chief had been carried prisoner to Nejd in 1809, but, subsequently escaping to Jeddah, had been entrusted with a mission to Sa'eed by Mohammed Ali of Egypt, soliciting his aid against the Wahabee Amir. Sa eed, flattered by this notice, had written to Toossoun Pasha, promising co-operation and a small fleet had been despatched with Shaikh Sultan to Bas-el-Khaimah, but had returned unsuccessful. Mr. Bruce, the British Resident in the Gulf, who had arrived at Muscat at this time to make arrangements for the appointment of a Native Agent, was desired by Sa'eed to accompany him to the pirate coast, to lend his countenance to the operations. Mr Bruce having instructions from Government to renew certain treaties with the Arab Chiefs, complied but the operation failed, and Sa'eed returned defeated to Muscat. This espousal of Sultan's quarrel and consequent operations against the Wahabee nominee at Ras-el-Khaimah naturally gave fresh cause of offence at El Dereyheh, and Mutlak. who had for some time suspended hostilities and been residing at Bereymee, received orders to move against Muscat. He accord ingly gathered his forces, quitted Bereymee, and marched along the Batineh as far as Mesnaah' Azzan-bin-Kais made terms with him en route, and Sa'eed, unable to offer opposition arranged a personal interview and induced him to retire by the payment of forty thousand dollars. With this amount Mutlak returned to Nejd, where his action in abandoning the campaign would appear to have been disapproved by the Amir. Another General, named El Azdakah, was4 EESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOB 1883-84. 25 appointed to succeed him and started for 'Oman, but was murdered by the way. Mutlak was then again despatched in command with orders to renew hostilities and chastise the Omanis. In the month of November 1813 Mutlak embarked on his last campaign; he marched through tke Dhahireh to Sharkiyeh, intending to direct his operations against the tribes of this province. He reached, almost unopposed, the country of the Hejrieen, but here he met with a resistance he had hardly looked for. In the first encounter Mutlak was shot in the breast by a musket ball and fell dead. The Wahabees immediately fell into disorder, became dispersed, and retreated hastily to Bereymee. Mutlak's arms and coat ►of-mail were carried to Muscat, and the dark cloud of Wahabee domination over 'Oman was scattered. The hopes of the Wahabee Amir attaining the conquest of 'Oman were lost in Mutlak. To his able and dashing generalship the success of the Wahabee invasions has been chiefly due, and the Amir had no one of similar capacity to replace him. Sa'eed's fortunes were now in the ascendant; he had passed through the period of adversity, and his career henceforward, though not marked by uninterrupted success, was brilliant and prosperous. Early in 1814! the death of Azzan-bin-Kais at Mokha, while returning from pilgrimage, gave Sa'eed the possession of Sohar, and three months later the death of the Amir Saood from fever at Dereyeh was a still more decided turn of fortune's wheel in his favour. Relieved from foreign pressure Sa'eed's restless spirit now sent him on another expedition against Ras-el- Khaimah, the chief stronghold of the Kowasim. He succeeded in establishing Shaikh Sultan- bin-Sakar at Shargah, but the lukewarmness of his Arab allies caused the failure of the chief object of the enterprise, and, after arranging a truce for the sake of appearances, he returned to Muscat. The Ameer Abdulla, who had succeeded his father Saood, now appointed a hew agent at Muscat, the reverses sustained in his wars with the Egyptians having led him to adopt a more pacific policy. Hopes of a permanent peace were entertained and negociations were opened, but they fell through owing to disputes about Ras-el-Khaimah, and hostilities with 'Oman recommenced. The Kowasim also began to display renewed activity at sea and sent a fleet to pirate the Indian trading craft in the Gulf of 'Oman. This fleet, among other exploits, encountered the frigate Caroline of 40 guns, commanded by Sa'eed himself, off Ra- Kuryah, and nearly succeeded in carrying her by boarding ; Sa'eed was wounded by a musket ball, and escaped with difficulty to Muscat, the victorious Kowasim sailing away to the Mekran coast to continue their depredations. For some time after this Sa'eed's attention was engaged by internal disorders in the Nakhl district, where Himyar-bin-Suliman El Yaaraby, the representative of the last dynasty, had in alliance with Mohammed Nasir-el-Jabri seized the fort. Sa'eed attempted to dispossess Himyar, but was defeated in the field, and it was only by treachery that he was able ultimately to entice Himyar within his reach and put him to death. In the beginning of 1816 Sa'eed undertook a third expedition against Ras-el-Khaimah, which he blockaded for four months, but being unable to gain any success over his enemies, the Kowasim retired discomfited to Muscat. Undiscouraged by this failure, Sa'eed now determined on undertaking the conquest of the rich island of Bahrein, an object on which he had long set his heart, and on which he had for months past been engaged in making preparations. The British Resident at Bushire did his utmost to dissuade Sa'eed from this enterprise, but in vain. Sa'eed, however, was destined never to possess that island, although he continued to cherish the hope of its acquisition to the day of his death. In June the expedition sailed from Muscat and was joined by three Persian vessels from Bushire. The Omanis were landed on the island, but were attacked and defeated with great loss by the Attoobees, Sa'eed's younger brother Hamad being slain in the fight. Chagrined at his ill-success, which was due in great measure to the treachery of his allies, Sa'eed sailed away to Congoon, to embark a Persian force that had been promised him, but he fortunately discovered in time that he was being led into snare by the Persians, who intended to carry him a prisoner to Shiraz, and, abandoning his project against Bahrein, returned to 'Oman. It was at this time that Ibrahim Pasha, at the head of the Egyptian army, was marching across Arabia, intent on accomplishing the final destruction of the Wahabee Empire. The Ameer Abdulla had need of every available man to aid in the defence of his country, and not only was every Nejdian soldier withdrawn from 'Oman, but the Arab spirit of clannishness, or perhaps the ingrained hatred of Arab against Turk, induced a large contingent from the Ghafliree, or Maaddie, tribes of El Dhahireh to flock to the standard of the Ameer at Dereyeh. In September 1817 communications were received from the French Governor of Bourbon, proposing a renewal of commercial relations between that island and Muscat, and a favourable26 ADMINISTRATION 'REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL reply having been returned by Sa^eed, a brisk trade sprung up, for the better regulation of which a new convention was signed by Sa'eed on the 30th March 1882. This convention appears fa have remained in force until the negociation of tke French Commercial Treaty of 1844. During this year, 1817, and the next, Sa'eed was entirely occupied with internal disorders , and in contending with his naval enemies, the Kowasim, who attacked and made themselves masters of Khor Fakan. Later on, however, the fall of Dereyeh caused great alarm at Eas-el- Khaimah, and the Kowasim, dreading the approach of the Egyptians, became anxious to make an alliance with Sa'eed against them. Sa^eed was too well advised, however, to entertain such a proposition. The reign of piracy in the Gulf was now doomed. For twenty years the Kowasim, notwithstanding the efforts of British cruisers, had maintained the sway of rapine over maritime commerce, but the patience of the Indian Government was at length exhausted. At the close of 1819 the British expeditionary force under Sir W. G. Keir arrived at Muscat, when Sa^eed offered to supplement it by a land force of 4,000 men and three ships of war. This was accepted by the General, and Sa'eed accompanied the expedition to Ras-el-Khaimah, where the Commander was successful in completely breaking the power iof the pirate chiefs and in arranging by treaty for the future good order and tranquillity of the whole Gulf. A few months later a joint expedition was undertaken by the British and by Sa^eed against the Beni Boo Ali tribe in Jaalan, the immediate cause of which, so far as the British were concerned, was the murder of the interpreter of the Mercury brig, which had been de spatched to El Askhara to enquire into certain piratical acts committed by the tribe. On the termination of his operations General Keir had left a force in the Gulf as a temporary mea sure to ensure the observance of his treaties and to preserve order. Parts of this force, consist ing of six companies of Native Infantry and six guns, was now embarked by the Political Agent, Captain Thompson, who had resolved on immediate hostilities, and taken from Kishno to Muscat. Sa'eed had for some years been at variance with the Beni Boo Ali tribe on account of their having coalesced with the Wahabees and adopted their tenets in 1811, and he had since been seeking for an opportunity to crush them. The expedition was undoubtedly due in part to Sa'eed's instigation and encouragement, and he had been allowed to join it with about 1,000 men. Captain Thompson sailed from Muscat to Soor, and the combined force marched from that port to the Beni Boo Ali country on the 1st November 182-0. The tribes were summoned to surrender, practically unconditionally, by Sa'eed, but refused to give up their arms, and a eon- test ensued, in which the British force was completely defeated with a loss of 6 officers, 270 men, and all the guns. The survivors retreated by way of Sharkiyeh and 'Oman through the Wady Akk to Muscat, where they arrived on the 17th November. Sa'eed displayed great gal lantry and coolness throughout the affair, and was wounded while endeavouring to save a British soldier. In acknowledgment of his services a sword of honour was presented to him by the Governor General. To retrieve this disaster, a large force was despatched under General Sir Lionel Smith from Bombay in January 1821. The General attacked Beni Boo Ali in March, and after severe fighting destroyed the forts and almost annihilated the tribe, which to this day has never recovered its former strength and prestige. Sa'eed was not permitted to take part in this campaign, though he personally accompanied the troops. It was during his absence from Muscat on this occasion that he had to mourn the death of his elder brother Salim, who died of paralysis in February 1821. A large number of prisoners of the Beni Boo Ali were carried to Bombay by General Smith, where they were detained for about two years, and were then released and sent back to 'Oman. By order of the Court of Directors intercession was made with Sa'eed on behalf of the survivors of the tribe, for forgiveness and permission to return to their country. This intercession on the part of the British Government roused Sa'eed's jealousy and suspicion, and, though he yielded after some hesitation, it was only with a bad grace. In 1822 Captain F. Moresby, R.N., Her Majesty's ship Minai, was ordered to Muscat to conclude a treaty with Sa'eed for the suppression of the slave trade. Sa'eed granted all the concessions asked for, which would, if strictly enforced, have caused him a loss of £5 000 or £6,000 a year. Relieved from all troubles, foreign and domestic, and feeling that he had securely consoli dated his power, Sa'eed now undertook a pilgrimage to Mecca. He appointed his nephew, Mohammed-bin-Salim,, Regent during his absence and sailed in the Liverpool fseventy-four, which had been specially repaired for the voyage in Bombay, in March 1824. This journey was performed with great pomp and magnificence, and was most costly to Sa'eed. The Pasha of Egypt, Mohammed Ali, sent officers to meet him, and nothing was omitted by them and the Turkish Governor to give Sa'eed a, fitting reception on his arrival at Jeddah. On his journeyEESIDENGT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84, 27 to Mecca and Medina he was accompanied by a large escort and entertained witli great sumptuonsness. He created everywhere an immense sensation, and his popularity among the people was not lessened by the generosity of his gifts. Notwithstanding his being Akharejite or dissenter, Sa^eed was received with the greatest respect and honour by the Shereef, and on his departure was presented with splendid gifts by Mohammed Ali, Sauced was received on his return to Muscat with loud acclamations) and the rejoicings lasted several days. In July 1826 Sa'eed sent a fleet to blockade Bushire in the absence of the Governor, Shaikh Abdul Russool, though, at the request of the Resident, he refrained, from attacking the town. The Shaikh himself was captured at sea on his way home shortly after and detained a prisoner until the following year, when he paid a ransom of 80,000 dollars and agreed to surrender a Persian princess, a sister of Reza Kolee Mirza, who had been promised to Sa'eed, but had been delayed at Bushire by the Governor, who was desirous of marrying her himself. In November of the same year Sa^eed, having been unable to prevail on the Govern ment of Busra to pay the stipulated subsidy, the arrears of which had amounted to 104,000 dollars, equipped a fleet to enforce his demand. In an engagement that ensued the Turks were defeated and the Pasha carried prisoner to Muscat. Busra was blockaded until the Turks made terms. The following year was spent by Sa'eed in a fruitless war with Bahrein, for which he had made long and expensive preparations. With the object of taking the Uttoobees by surprise, Sa'eed contradicted the rumours prevalent of his intentions, and assured the Shaikh of his pacific feelings until about a month before he arrived there with his fleet, which was in Novem ber 1828. In his attack on the island, however, his force was completely routed and many slain while he himself was slightly wounded. Being thus discouraged in his enterprise, he abandoned its further prosecution and returned to Muscat. A peace was concluded between the belligerents on terms not unfavourable to Sauced in December the following year. In 182-9 the Chief of Dhofar, Mohammed Akil, was murdered at Morbah, and Sa^eed imme diately despatched a force to take possession of that district. This force only remained a few months, for Sa^eed, having done with Bahrein, prepared to visit his East African possessions in order to conquer the district and island of Mombasa, and with this object withdrew the troops from Dhofar. Having appointed his nephew, Mohammed-bin-Salim, Regent, and treacherously seized and imprisoned his cousin Hilal, with a view to keep him out of mischief, he sailed for Mom basa accordingly on the 15th December. The importance of this part of Sa'eed's dominions, which was to occupy his chief attention for the next 15 years, and was to be selected shortly as his permanent residence, will be our apology for taking a short retrospect of the state of affairs there. East Africa had been occupied by the Omani Arabs for many centuries.; they had succeeded the Persians in the domination of the salient points of trade on that coast, and had been in their turn supplanted by the Portuguese. Without going back to those times to observe the wave of history, it will suffice to commence our retrospect from the period at which the decadence of the Portuguese led to the re-assumption by the Arabs of their supremacy at Mombasa. About the year 1655 A.D. the Imam Sultan-bin-Seif, at the solicitation of a deputation of tbe inhabitants, who were tired of the tyrannical rule of the Portuguese, sent a fleet to besiege the place. After a siege of five years he succeeded in expelling the Portuguese and appointed a Governor. The Portuguese, however- soon recovered possession of Mombasa and retained it until 1696 or 1698 A.D., when an Arab fleet, despatched by the Imam Seyf-bin-Sultan, again expelled the Portuguese from Mombasa; the success of the Arabs being followed by a general attack on, and massacre of, the Portuguese along the Coast at Kilwa, Pemba, Patta, Zanzibar, and other places. Affairs at home, however, precluded the Imam and his successors from interfering with East Africa, and Mombasa was left to take care of itself until the year 1728, when the Portuguese Admiral, Luis de Sampaio, appeared with his fleet and again brought the whole coast under subjection to his sovereign. Finding the tyranny of the Portuguese insupportable, the inhabitants soon renewed their solicitations to ■'Oman for deliver ance, and a small fleet was accordingly despatched to their aid. But in the meantime, having found an opportunity, the inhabitants rose and massacred their oppressors, so that the Arab deputed by the Imam to assist in expelling the Portuguese &gt; had nothing to do but to quietly assume the position of Governor. This man was Mohammed-bin Sa'eed El Maamire, For the first time an Arab garrison was placed at Zanzibar by this W all, who appears to have remitted a small annual tribute to 'Oman. In 1739 the then di of Mombasa, Saleh- bin-Sa'eed El Hadrami, was succeeded by Mohammed-bin-'OtLmaii EI Mezrni. Mohammed is 4 A28 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL a noteworthy character j for he was the founder of what may be called the Mezeni Dynasty on the east coast, and his claim to be independent of the A1 Bu Sa'eedis can hardly be said to be relinquished by his descendants to this day. Mohammed was a just and able ruler, and soon gained the respect of the people of Mombasa. Two years later a change of dynasty occurred in 'Oman, the rule being transferred from the Yaareby tribe to the A1 Bu Sa'eedis. This opportunity was seized by Mohammed 'Othman to declare himself independent. To put down this revolt against his authority the Imam, Ahmed-bin-Sa'eed, sent one Seyf-bin Khalaf, to assassinate Mohammed 'Othman and seize the government in Ahmed's name. Seyf was so far successful that he murdered Mohammed and took possession of the fort, but Moham med's brother, Ali-bin-'Othman, escaped from Seyfs hands, and, with the aid of Mr. Cook an English merchant, and some native allies, recovered the fort and government, and decapitated Seyf-bin-Khalaf. This occurred in the year 1745, and Ali-bin-'Othman maintained his inde pendence till his death,—Magdesho, Brava, and Samoo remaining as his dependencies. Kilwa, Marka, and Zanzibar, however, submitted to the Imam, and the latter island received its first Governor, under the new dynasty, in Abdulla-bin-Jaad A1 Bu Sa'eedi. A few years later, Ali-bin-'Othman undertook an expedition against Zanzibar, where he was murdered by his relative, Mesood-bin-Nasir, who then usurped the government of Mombasa. Mesood died in 1774, and was succeeded by Abdulla Mohammed, who died in 1782. Meanwhile, the Imam Ahmed did not interfere in East African politics, nor did his son and successor Sa'eed, until the expedition of his younger brother Seyf in ] 784, when the Imam Sa'eed sent his son Hamad, with a fleet, to follow up Seyf and frustrate his'intentions. Hamud, after raising the siege of Zanzibar, went to_ Mombasa, where he obtained a written acknowledgment of the suzerainty of the Imam, and then returned to 'Oman. East Africa then remained unmolested by Muscat for many years; Sultan was too much engaged in dealing with the Wahabees and with internal troubles to have leisure for distant campaigns and for some years Sa'eed was similarly occupied. Sa'eed's first attempt at interference was in 181^, when he sent a Wali named Khalaf-bin-Nasir, and built a fort at Lamoo. Ahmed-bin- Mohammed died in 1814, and was succeeded by his son Abdulla, a brave and. enterprising Chief, who, resolving to separate from the mother-country, refused to send any tribute to Muscat. Being conscious, however, that this course would inevitably lead to a contest, Abdulla sailed to Bombay, and endeavoured to secure the alliance of the Indian Government. Some time later, in 1817, intestine broils at Patta, the suzerainty over which was claimed by the Wali of Mombasa, compelled one of the parties to call in the aid of Sa'eed. A small force, under Abdul Ali, was sent from Muscat, which established Bwana Shaikh as Sa'eed's vassal. The Wali of Mombasa, however, soon recovered his predominating influence, and matters so remained until fresh dissensions arose, when Sa'eed again was invited to interfere, and, burning with jealousy against the Mezeri Chief, sent a second expedition in 1882, under Hamad-bin-Ahmed, who received the submission of Brava, Patta, and Siwi, while Sa'eed's Wali at Zanzibar, hearing of Hamud's proceedings, seconded him by attacking Pemba and expelling the Mombasa garrison. Abdulla- bin-Ahmed died 1823, and, as the succession was disputed, the people elected Suliman-bin-Ali, the ex- W ali of Pemba, to act as Regent temporarily. Sa'eed was at this time getting ready another fleet at Muscat, and had issued orders that his people were not to trade with Mombasa a measure which, in connection with the recent loss of Pemba, the source of its food supply, did much to weaken Suliman's position. Apprehensive of the result of a contest with Muscat, 8uliman-bin-Ali had written to the Government of Bombay, soliciting protection, but no answer was received to this appeal. It appears, however, that in December 1823 the Eno-lish sloop Barracouta, one of the vessels engaged in the East African survey, anchored off Mombasa. Her arrival was hailed with great delight, and earnest solicitations were made to Captain Vidal by the Wali Suliman and the inhabitants to take the island under British pro tection. This request Captain Vidal decided to refuse, but he offered to transmit their applica- tion to the British Government. A few days after the Barracouta had left, the Muscat flotilla sailed into port and immediately commenced the blockade. Suliman-bin-Ali hoisted the British flag, trusting by it to deter Abdulla-bin-Suleyyim, the Commander of the expedition, from his designs. Matters were in this state, and the flag was still hoisted when the Leven frigate arrived on the 7th February 1824. A similar application was immediately made for protection by the Wali to Captain Owen, who, taking a different view from that of his subordi nate, Captain Vidal, agreed to a convention accepting the sovereignty over Mombasa from Melindi to Pangani on the part of England on condition of the abolition of slavery. The Arab Commander, Abdulla-bin-Suleyyim, at once placed himself under the orders of Captain Owen, and agreed to give up the blockade. Captain Owen appointed one of his officers. Lieute nant Reitz, as Governor, with a midshipman and four men as guard, and sailed on the 13th \EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 29 February for Pemba and Zanzibar, where the Governor, however, Sa'eed-bin-Muhammed El Akhabari (styled by Owen Seyyid LarkLree), refused to surrender Pemba, which had^been a dependency of Mombasa previous to present hostilities. Captain Owen revisited the coast in January 1825, when the people of Brava also solicited British protection, which was accorded to them. He then made an arrangement with the Wali at Zanzibar that no interference should take place on the Walr's part with the East African coasts until the decision of Govern ment became known. In 1826 Suliman-bin-Ali was deposed by Salim, the brother of the late Wali, Abdulla- bin-Ahmed, the British Governor not interfering in the matter, and shortly after the Home authorities, at the instance of the Indian Government, disavowed Captain Owen^s proceedings, and the British Commandant was removed from Mombasa, which was left with Pemba and Brava to settle its own quarrel with Sa-'eed. Sauced lost no time in writing to Salim and sum moning him to surrender. Salim in reply offered to acknowledge a nominal sway and to remit tribute, but refused to yield the fort. This did not satisfy Sa'eed, who, having completed his preparations, sailed in the Liverpool with a large fleet and 1,200 men from Muscat, expectant of an easy victory. The sight of this imposing force riding at anchor before his little island did not terrify Salim; he refused defiantly Sa'eed's demand for submission, and declined to accept his invitation to an interview. He was prepared for defence. A general assault was then made by Sauced, but it was repulsed with heavy loss, and after several ineffectual attempts Sa^eed deemed if prudent to raise the siege and retire to Zanzibar. In the meanwhile serious disorders were taking place in ^Oman. Incensed at her brother's imprisonment, Jokha, the sister of Hilal, seized the fort at Soweyk and razed the Batineh. HamUd also joined in the insurrection, made himself master of Sohar, Khabooreh, and Shinas, and prepared to march on Muscat. Mohammed-bin-Salim, seriously alarmed, sent a vessel to recall Sa'eed from Zanzibar and appealed to Bombay for help. Two cruisers were ordered to support him and to prevent an attack being made on Muscat. The Resident also kept other vessels ready and warned Hamud not to attempt an attack. Sa'eed returned to 'Oman in May 1830, and with his usual duplicity pretended to think that the rebellion had been of an insignificant character, and that he had been recalled without reason. He was unable, however, to recover either Sohar or Khabooreh from Hamud, and had to content himself with the restitution of Shinas. Another expedition against Sohar, in February 1831, was undertaken by Sa'eed, but he was disastrously defeated by Hamud with a loss of 400 or 500 men, and had to retreat with his finances and reputation reduced to a very low ebb. Early in the next year Sa'eed having entrusted the government of 'Oman to his eldest son Hilal, his nephew, Mohammed-bin-Salim, and Saood-bin-Ali of Barka, set out on a fresh expedition to East Africa in the Liverpool with the intention of again besieging Mombasa. His force consisted of 1,400 men in four ships and six bughlos, and, having on arrival wasted three days in fruitless negociations, commenced to bombard the town and forts. This proved unavailing, and negociations were again resorted to. Salim, on receiving hostages, came on board the Liverpool, and a convention was concluded to the effect that Salim should recognise Sa'eed's sovereignty, and should continue to hold the governorship as hereditary in his family, that he should also hold and reside in the fort, which was, however, to be garrisoned by 50 men, appointed by Sa'eed, and that the customs should be equally divided between Sa'eed and Salim. Sa'eed then entered and formally took possession of the fort, and appointed Sa'eed-bin-Khalfan as Akeed, or Commandant. Instead of 50, however, he introduced a garrison of 200 men, and then perfidiously ordered Salim to quit the fort and reside in the town. Before leaving, he repaired the fort and stationed a garrison of 350 men, Beloochis and Arabs, in it, and then set sail for Zanzibar. Sa'eed appears to have already resolved to fix his residence at Zanzibar, for he began to build a palace at Metony and to lay out clove and rice plantations. But he was not destined to enjoy tranquillity there long. He had, in fact, no sooner left Muscat than disturbances of a serious character broke out, and the integrity of his dominions was threatened. These disturb ances were due chiefly to harem intrigues, and to the existing jealousy between Saood-bin-Ali and Mohammed-bin-Salim. Taking advantage of the arrival of Hilal and Mohammed at Barka, whither they had proceeded en route to Bostak, which had been made over to Hilal, Saood seized and imprisoned the pair, and then laid siege to Mesnaah. Hamud-bin-Azzan, Hilalbin-Mohammed, and Sultan-bin-Sakar also took up arms, the last seizing Khor Fakan and Dibba, and the two former beleaguering Rostak. The Seyyideh Moza took the lead on Sa'eed's part, and was joined by Talib and Mohammed Nasir El Jabri, with 1,500 Ghaffiris, at Muscat, while the Beni Naeem at their request made a diversion against SoLr r. To support Sa'eed's rule the Resident at Bushire wrote warning letters to the insurgent, and despatched his30 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL assistant with a naval force to Muscat^ but in the meantime Saood had released his prisoners on payment of 8,000 dollars, and on the arrival of the Assistant Resident at Barka Saood withdrew his pretensions and exculpated himself by saying he had only acted in self-defence. The quelling of this rebellion and the restoration of tranquillity was attributed solely to the prompt support afforded to Sa'eed's authority by the British Government, which encouraged and brought forward Sa'eed's friends, while it effectually checked and dismayed the insurgents. His rule in recent years had led, it was said, to the formation of a very unfavuorable esti mate of the situation of Sa^eed, and it was clear that British influence alone had prevented his immediate downfall. Sa'eed returned from Zanzibar on the 10th September 1832, and after appointing Saood to Rostak on condition of his giving up Barka, solicited aid in re covering Khor Fakan and Dibba, but this was refused by Government, and he was advised to remain at home in future and protect his Arabian dominions. Sa'eed when starting from Zanzibar had ordered Hamud-bin-Ahmed, the Wali of Zanzibar, to reduce Magdesho with the Mombasa fleet. Hamud accordingly bombarded and sacked that town, which then sub mitted. Abdulla-bin-Surveylime was killed on this occasion. His old foes, the Wahabees had by this time again turned their attention towards 'Oman, and much anxiety was created in Sa'eed's mind by their attitude. He was not in a position to offer any effectual resistance to their encroachments, and, under the advice of the British authorities, deemed it his best policy to enter into friendly relations with them. He accordingly agreed to pay them an annual subsidy of 5,000 dollars on condition of the integrity of his dominions being respected. A stipulation was also made that each party should assist the other in quelling rebellions # in their respective countries, but this latter engagement was considered impolitic and was dis approved of by the British as leading to possible embarrassments. The arrival at Muscat at this time of the United States sloop-of-war FeacocJc with Mr. Roberts, who had been appointed Plenipotentiary to negociate a treaty of amity and com merce with the kingdom of 'Oman, was a notable event in the life of Sa'eed. The growing importance of Muscat and Zanzibar as commercial depots had begun to attract foreign mer chants, and improvements in the customs regulations soon became a necessity. The chief part of the trade and customs farm was still, as it had been for centuries, in the hands of Indian traders, whose position was well known and assured, and in whose favour no cause had arisen for England to interfere. The American merchants, however, were in a different position. They had only begun to trade at Zanzibar some ten or twelve years before, and the heavy exactions and constant annoyances to which they were subjected by the Customs House farmer and Indian traders, who were jealous of interlopers, compelled them to make representa tions to their Governments, which thus took the lead in entering into engagements with 'Oman to remove grievances and place its commerce on a secure and satisfactory basis. The treaty which was concluded in September 1833 was of a comprehensive character and well considered in its details, and formed the prototype on which the English and French treaties were subsequently drafted. Sa'eed's engagements with foreign powers had heretofore been confined to conventions with British India and French colonies, and it was with unconcealed pride and gratification that he now for the first time found himself placed on a level with the rulers of civilised States, and, though the capitulations he had bound himself to observe complicated his foreign relations, the treaty, as he probably foresaw and understood, had the effect of raising his position and increasing the trade and prosperity of his country. It was not in accordance with Sa'eed's character that he should allow the opportunity to slip without intriguing to gain some advantage for himself, and, as the conquest of Mombasa was the matter now uppermost in his mind, he offered to allow the Americans, to erect fac tories where they pleased, at Zanzibar or on the East African coast, on condition of their rendering him armed assistance in the prosecution of his plans. It does not appear that the United States Government reciprocated Sa'eeds' views, nor is it likely they would have con sented to engage in such an enterprise, but the news of the proposal was received in India with the reverse of pleasure, and Her Majesty's ship Imogene was soon despatched to observe the state of affairs. Captain Hart reached Zanzibar in 1834 and was able, not only to frustrate the proposed scheme, but to obtain Sa'eed's consent to the negociation of a similar treaty with England. To return to Africa : Sa'eed had no sooner quitted Zanzibar in August 1833 than a rup ture broke out at Mombasa, the result of which was the restoration of Mezeni independence. Sa'eed had instructed the Wali of Pemba, Nasir-bin-Sultan El Meskeri, a bitter enemy of the Mezenit, to proceed to Mombasa and assume the Waliship from Salim. In this demand heEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 31 was supported by the Commandant of the garrison, for tvhom he had probably brought written orders. Salira, however, refused to submit to this violation of the treaty, and ordered Nasir to quit the place in *24 hours. Nasir then shut himself up in the fort and commenced to bombard the town, which had no means of replying. The whole population, however, siding with Salim, blockaded the fort and cut off the supplies, and the garrison, being at length reduced to extremities, were compelled to capitulate after a siege of 7 months. The command ant and his men were allowed to leave Mombasa unmolested, but Nasir was detained and kept in irons. An abortive attempt to relieve the place was made by Sauced, who sent Hamud-bin- Ahmed in the HhaJi Allum to assist Nasir, but he arrived too late. It was not until about November 1833 that Sauced, having arranged terms with the Wahabee General, Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, was able to devote his energies to the reconquest of Mombasa. Having appointed Howeynee his Deputy at Muscat, he set sail in the Bahmanee with the Liverpool (seventy-four), two corvettes and 1,400 men, and anchored off Mombasa Fort. Salim and the Mezinis, fearing the vengeance of Nasir, should the latter ever gain power over them, strangled him in prison, and Sa'eed, enraged at this action, immediately commenced a bombardment. His attacks, however, were repulsed by the Mezinis, who captured and destroyed two bughlos, and Sa'eed, after 8 days'' ineffectual warfare, had recourse to negociations. Sauced pretended to regret his precipitate hostilities, and proposed peace on the basis of the former treaty. This was accepted by Salim, who agreed to acknowledge Sa^eed's sovereignty, but made proviso that the citadel was not to be occupied by Sa^eed's men. Sa^eed induced two of Salinas relatives to accompany him, and, with this appearance of victory, he proceeded to Zanzibar in triumph. Soon after Sauced sent an expedition against Siwi, which had revolted. Salim assisted the people of Siwi, and Sa'eed was defeated with immense loss. At Patta and Siwi, again, farther aggressive movements were equally unsuccessful. Sa^eed^s stay at Zanzibar was again of short duration. His ambitious schemes had no sooner led him to distant shores than intestine troubles at home recalled him to restore order. The mar-peace on this occasion was Hamud-bin-Azzan, who, taking advantage of the murder of Saood-bin-Ali by his cousin Sultan-bin-Ahmed, marched on Kostak and took it, and then prepared to attack Semail, the Wali of which, Mohammed Nasir El Jabri, had lately died. It was feared that Hamud by the acquisition of these forts might be in a position to overawe and seize Muscat, and the British Resident, therefore, in July 1834, with a view to support Sa^eed^s government and authority, moved down to Muscat and informed Hamud that his persistence in rebellion would lead to his being considered an enemy of the British Government. This intervention was effective in checking Hamud^s designs for a time, but a few months later his irrepressible ambition prompted him to take up arms again and seize Soweyk, from which fort, however, he was very quickly dislodged by a force despatched from xMuscat. Hamud^s popularity in the country, nevertheless, continued to increase, and, although Howeynee called in the Kiowasim and the Beni Yas tribes to his aid, he was able to effect nothing against his cousin until the return of Sa'eedfrom Zanzibar in April 1835. Sa^eed immediately took the field and proceeded, against Sohar, but, although this expedition returned with only a bare semblance of success, his presence at home was sufficient to re-establish his authority and put an end to Hamud's hostilities. Affairs in ^Oman for some time occupied Sa^eed^s attentions, but, although pining to return to Zanzibar, he was fearful to leave Muscat while Hamud was unsubdued, as the latter would be certain to take immediate advantage of his absence. Sauced therefore, in 1836, entered into an arrangement with Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak to unite in expelling Hamud from Sohar and Eostak. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak accordingly besieged Sohar by land with 2,000 men, while Sa^eed despatched a fleet and blockaded it by sea. Hamud's position was getting desperate, when he succeeded in arousing Sa^eed^s suspicions as to the intentions of the Wahabees, and Sa^eed, hastily abandoning the enterprise, returned to Muscat. Soon after this a vessel of the Indian Navy, under instructions from Government, who were desirous of promoting a recon ciliation between Sa'eed and Hamud, proceeded to Sohar, and, having received Hamud on board, returned to Muscat, where a written engagement was entered into by the latter that he would not again rebel against Sa'eed or enter upon hostilities against Hilal-bin-Mohammed of Soweyk. The Wali of Mombasa, Salim-bin-Ahmed, died in Marc} 1835, and his death was the signal for rivalry and dissensions between his brothers, Khamis and Nasir. After more than a year spent in contention the succession was obtained by Salim's son, Rashid.32 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL A deputation from some of the tribes at Mombasa, tired of these wars and quarrels, found Sa'eed preparing a third expedition, and, encouraged by this invitation, he hastened his arrange ments and sailed from Muscat in November 1836, arriving at Mombasa about the close of the year. He at once summoned Rashid to surrender, but, receiving no reply, Sa'eed landed his troops and batteries on the north side of the creek and commenced a bombardment. Taught by experience, however, of the futility of this method, he founded his hopes upon intrigue and by lavish expenditure soon gained over a large proportion of those opposed to him, including Khamis and Nasir, the uncles of Rashid. Rashid, seeing the gradual defection of his adherents and finding himself unable to hold out against the power of Sa^eed^s purse, opened negociations, and in February 1837 a convention was concluded in the terms of the original pact by which the fort was to be garrisoned by Sa^eed's men, and the Wali was to reside in the town. Sa^eed then appointed Ali-bin-Munsoor to command the fort with a garri son of 500 men, and sailed for Zanzibar. Shortly after, at Sa^eed^s invitation Rashid paid a visit to Zanzibar and was then offered the Wali ship of Pemba, or a liberal pension, if he would relinquish his title and claim to the Waliship of Mombasa, and quit that place with his family for ever. Rashid declined the preferred baits and maintained his hereditary claim to Mombasa, and Sa^eed failing in his attempt to get final possession of the coveted fort by purchase, devised a plan for the extermination of the family of the Mezeni Chief. Rashid was now honourably treated and sent back to Mombasa with presents. But two months later, Khalid, Sa'eed's second son, was despatched to that fort with secret orders which he carried out with great precision and success. On arrival at Mombasa, where he was received with due respect, Khalid landed and held a durbar in Arab fashion at the fort gate. Rashid and the other Mezenis attended the levee, and, after making their salutations, were desired to enter the fort for the discussion of business. On passing in they were seized one by one and thrown into prison to the number of 30. Suspicions then arose, the alarm spread, and the remainder of the Mezara fled to to the mainland. The prisoners were immediately put on board and carried by Khalid to Zanzibar, whence Sa'eed shipped them to Bunder Abbass in one of his frigates. Some were thrown overboard on the way, and the rest were immured and starved to death. Sa'eed^s wars at Mombasa had been marked throughout by a series of perfidies, and this cruel murder of the gallant Rashid and his companions fittingly completed his conquest. With their death the Mezeni dynasty, which had lasted for over a century, and which neither the Imaum Ahmed nor any of his descendants had been able to overthrow by force of arms, came to an end. The accession of Her Majesty Queen Victoria was an opportunity for Sa'eed to display his loyalty to England, which was not neglected by him. In 1838 he despatched Ali-bin- Nasir as envoy to offer his congratulations, with presents of great value; and Captain Cogan, who brought back the mission to Zanzibar, was empowered to negociate a commercial treaty, which was concluded and signed in May 1839. Very shortly after Sa^eed received letters from the Governor at Bourbon, who had been moved by representations from French mer chants of commercial requirements at Zanzibar, requesting him to receive a French Consul on the same footing as the Americans, and making overtures for a fresh treaty. Sa J eed, how ever, demurred to granting an exequatur to the consul, who had in fact already been appoint ed in anticipation until the treaty had been concluded, and the Consulate was deferred accordingly. Sa'eed returned from East Africa to 'Oman in September 1839, and had no sooner arrived than he was forced to turn his attention to the adoption of measures for resisting the advance of the Egyptians; Mohammed Ali had at this time embarked on his vain career of aggression in Syria and Arabia, and his General, Khoorshia, had in December despatched Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, with a large force and two guns, to Bereymee. There was reason to believe that Sauced had been engaged in a secret intrigue with Mohammed Ali for aid in obtaining possession of Bahrein in return for the payment of tribute to Egypt. But under the advice of the British Government Sauced dropped these schemes and evinced proofs of his determination to act loyally in accordance with the policy of the Government in opposing the invasion of the Egyptian troops. In one of his interviews with Mohammed Ali in April 1840, Colonel Hodges, the Consul-General at Cairo, desired explanations as to the object of the force under Sa'eed-bin- Mutlak ; professions of ignorance and evasions were at first resorted to, but the Pasha sub sequently admitted that the force was part of Khoorshid's army, and was intended for the annexation of 'Oman. He was then informed that the British Government would allow no interference on his part with 'Oman, and would punish any attempt at encroachment. ThoughRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 33 N : ; 'ge. in bitter wrath at the frustration of his schemes, Mohammed Ali was nevertheless compelled the very shortly to evacuate Arabia, and his submission to the Porte in November 1840 relieved tig 'Oman from any further danger in that direction. ^ f The restless activity and acquisitive propensities of the French in East African waters ^ now greatly exercised the mind of Sa'eedj and, writing to Lord Palmerston from Zanzibar, :n g t whither he had again proceeded in the autumn of 1840, he did not conceal his fears that that nation had aggressive designs on his mainland possession. Sa^eed's fears were probably not e d ill-founded. The brig De Messager was despatched from Bourbon on three occasions to obtain b concessions of different sorts, and other indications were not wanting to show that the French to were anxious to obtain a footing on the coast, but Sa'eed had the sense and manliness to resist i. these demands and to decline to enter into any engagements against his interests. In his a | preposterous complaint, however, concerning the French occupation of Nosse Be, which belonged, ie as lie averred, to a Sakalava Queen, who had put herself under his authority, Sa'eed was no doubt actuated by jealousy. Some seven or eight years before he had despatched a mission to Mada gascar with the double object of offering marriage to the Hova Queen and of hiring soldiers for his Mombasa campaign, and he seems then to have cherished the hope of becoming master of the whole or part of that vast island. His matrimonial proposals had been slighted by the Queen, who does not appear to have treated the ambassadors with particular distinction, but Sa'eed had probably not altogether withdrawn his gaze from that quarter and did not look on the French proceedings with entire equanimity. Very soon after Sa'eed had sailed for Zanzibar, his rival Hamud-bin-Azzam of Sohar, who, to show his loyalty and amicable feelings towards Sa'eed, had lately accompanied the latter on a tour of his possessions in the Gulf, seeing in his absence a good opportunity to make another move for the supreme power, set out for Bombay to solicit the neutrality of Government in the forthcoming struggle. Though accorded a courteous reception in Bombay, the reply he received appears to have effectually discouraged him from further hostilities againt Sa'eed, and soon after his return to 'Oman he retired from public life and assumed the garb of religion, appointing, at the suggestion of the lady Moza, his son Seyf Governor of Sohar, and the since famous priest El Khalelee Governor of Rostak. Hamud^s ascetic life and patronage of the learned Khalelee led to an intrigue among the Batineh tribes to elect him Imam, but it was not generally supported and fell through. It was a mere proposal. The situation of affairs at Bahrein in ] 843, where civil war had broken out, revived Sa'eed's long-cherished hopes of including that island in his dominions, and Howejnee began to make preparations at Muscat for an expedition. Before embarking on the enterprise, however, Sa'eed had the prudence to refer to Government for an expression of their views in the matter; and, as it was considered desirable that Sa'eed should, for fear of bringing on complications with the Wahabees and Persians, preserve an attitude of neutrality, the scheme was abandoned by him. 'Oman was at this time again threatened by its old enemies the Wahabees. The Ameer Feysal, having made terms with Mohammed Ali and returned to Reyadh, announced his intention of undertaking the reconquest of 'Oman. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak was despatched to Bereymee with a large force, and a demand was at the same time made upon Thoweynee for $^5,000. On receipt of this news the Resident at Bushire advised Thoweynee to maintain a friendly understanding with the Wahabees, and to accept any terms compatible with his father's dignity. Thoweynee at once requested a truce desiring time to refer to Zanzibar for orders. Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, however, notwithstanding his compliance with the request, im mediately after marched into the Batineh and commenced hostilities. Remonstrances against this action were sent by the Resident to Feysal and to Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak, and this in tervention, coupled with the fact that the 'Oman tribes were gathering in formidable numbers to oppose him, induced Sa'eed-bin-Mutlak to accept terms, and he eventually withdrew his forces for an annual tribute of $5,000, the authorization for which Thoweynee had received from Zanzibar. The invasion thus terminated in a manner more favourable to Sa'eed than might have been expected. The increasing indifference to home affairs on Sa'eed's part was exem plified on' this occasion by his not returning to guide his people in their defence against aggression. He was, moreover, exhausting his resources at this time in his foolish campaign against the town of Siwi in East Africa. For this enterprise he had made extensive and costly preparations, and his force of 2,000 men was despatched in March 1844 under the command of Hamud-bin-Ahmed El Samar. It ended in a terrible disaster. The attack was badly planned, and the natives routed and almost annihilated the Arab army, killing many of the leading Shaikhs, including the commander, and capturing the whole of the artillery and stores. It was in this year that Sa'eed had the felicity to conclude his 'bird treaty with a great power. 534 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL On the 4th November 1844 the French Commodore on the East Indian station, Captain Romain Desses, arrived at Zanzibar in the Crocodile with a draft treaty o£ friendship and commerce. Sa^eed had previously communicated the proposals of the French Government in this matter to the English Foreign Office, and it was with their approval that he consented to negociate. The treaty was signed on the 17th November, and on the same day the first French Consul, who had been accommodated with a passage in the Crocodile by the Com modore, entered on his functions, although the treaty was not ratified until a year later. The treaty was followed the next year by the despatch of a French surveying expedition to Mada gascar and East African waters under the command of Captain Guillain, of the brig Duconedie, 18 guns. One of the objects of this enterprise appears to have been the acquisition of a strate gical point on the mainland coast, that, like Mayette, might act as a counterpoise to the new British settlement at Aden, and with this view Captain Guillain, about 1847, endeavoured to induce the native Chiefs of Lamoo and Brava to sell those ports to the French Government. Sa^eed, however, to whom the ports belonged by conquest, had early news of the intrigue and was able to frustrate it. It was at this time that Hilal, Sa'eed's eldest son, proceeded to England to beseech the intercession of Her Majesty's Government with his father, and it may be convenient here to turn aside from political events a little and glance at the relations in which Sa^eed stood towards his sons. Sa'eed's family now consisted of twelve, of whom the first was Hilal, who was born in 1815. He is described as tall, fair, and handsome, noted for his courage and revered by the Arabs, who deemed him the most shrewd and energetic of all the sons. He was so much a favourite that he would, it is said, have proved a very formidable rival to his father had he chosen to head a rebellion. The knowledge of this by Sauced had not improbably something to do with the continuance of that deep-rooted dislike and aversion which had been manifested towards Hilal from childhood. Hilal had only reached his twenty-third year when his father determined to disinherit him, and three years later, as the estrangement increased, Hilal, who had been Wali at Barka, was recalled to Zanzibar, and was never again allowed to hold an official position. In July 1844 Sa'eed, with the express object of finding out whether he would be upheld in disinheriting Hilal, had written to Lord Aberdeen, saying it wfis his wish that Thoweynee should succeed him in ^Oman and Khalid in East Africa. The reply, however, was a diplomatic one, expressing hopes that Sa'eed would restore Hilal to favour. The supercession of Hilal by his father appointing Khalid to act as Regent at Zanzibar, and Thoweynee at Muscat, during his absence from either place, was a cause of many quarrels, as Hilal was always insist ing on the governorship of one or other of those capitals as being his by birth-right, and indignant, at length, at what he considered his fathers unjust treatment of him, he proceeded to England in September 1845, to represent his condition to Her Majesty^s Government. Having kept his father in ignorance of his intentions,' Hilal was not accorded an official reception in London, but he seems to have gained much sympathy, and strong letters were written in his favour. Sa'eed, however, was exasperated by this visit and consequent exposure of his conduct, and, though for a time more indulgent outwardly, became really more bitter in his dislike, and in November 1849 Hilal was exiled from Zanzibar for ever. Hilal retired first to LamoOj ^nd thence moved on to Aden, where he arrived in destitute condition; but the end was approaching, and, surrounded happily by all his family, his sad story closed on the 28th Sfcptember 1851. The causes of Sa'eed's hatred of his eldest son are obscure and will probably ever remain so. Scandal rumoured that Hilal had violated his father's harem, but the story is suspicious, and it is more probable that the estrangement was due to harem intrigues and to jealousy, as Hilars mother, an Abyssinian, died when he was an infant, while Khalid's mother was an especial favourite, and would naturally endeavour to prejudice her lord in favour of her own son. Khalid was born in 1819 of a Malabar concubine, who had great influence over Sa'eed and did not scruple to use it; he was of a mean and penurious disposition, and was as much despised by the Arabs as he was petted and indulged by his father. His energies were entirely absorbed in trade, by which he had amassed a large fortune, and on account of this he was generally known and spoken of as the Banian. Sa'eed was very desirous that Khalid should succeed him, but fate decreed otherwise, and Khalid after a long illness died on the 7th November 3854. Two years younger than Khalid and born of a Georgian mother, Thoweynee was brave and generous, and much respected by the Arabs. He was greatly superior to Khalid, but could never have held his own against Hilal in 'Oman, and it was for this reason chiefly that the latter was recalled to Zanzibar in 1841. Sa'eed had much faith and confidence in Thoweynee, and had publicly announced that he wished him to succeed as ruler at Muscat.EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 35 The next few years o£ Sa'eed's life were tolerably uneventful, and were spent in the relax ing climate of Zanzibar, where his sensual habits must have tended to unfit him for the active government of his Arab dominions. During his long residence in East Africa Sa^eed^s main employment was to look after his estates and trading ventures, and to continue to add to his already large and unwieldy navy. Reverting now to affairs in ^Oman, we see that Seyf, who had become Wali of Sohar on the retirement of his father Hamud, and who had gradually made himself independent, was at length opposed by a coalition of the Yal Saad and other Batineh tribes, and, together with his uncle Kais, overthrown and put into confinement. From this Seyf not long after escaped and recovered Sohar, but Hamud, angry with him for having dismissed the pious Khalalee, and jealous of his friendship and alliance with Thoweynee, caused him to be assassinated, and then resumed charge of Sohar. This was in 1849. Thoweynee did not fail to represent these proceedings of Hamud to Government, and eventually he was informed that, as Hamud had violated the engagement that had been made through the media tion of the Resident, they would not again intervene in the matter. About the same time Thoweynee received orders from Sa^eed to endeavour to obtain possession of Hamud's person^ and with this object in view he proceeded up the coast in the Feiz Allum frigate and lured Hamud under a show of friendship to Shinas, where he treacherously seized and carried him to Muscat. Here he was confined for a few days in Jelali fort, and then put to death by poison on the 23rd April 1850. Thoweynee did not gain the immediate advantage he expected by this, for Sohar was at once occupied by Kais, who, on being blockaded, called in the aid of the Kowasim and compelled Thoweynee to raise the siege. Kais, moreover, succeeded in capturing Shinas, Khor, Fakan, and Grhalla, and not content with this he arrested Kahtan-bin-Seyf, who had been concerned in the seizure of Hamud, and cruelly murdered him by decapitation with a blunt sword. When the news of these events reached India, the action of Thoweynee was viewed with strong disapprobation by Government, his comduct towards Hamud being characterised as a gross violation of the treaty. Sa^eed, after much urging, at length realised the necessity of his presence in 'Oman, where he arrived on the 16th May 1851. On receiving Thoweynee's report he did not hesitate to approve all his proceedings, as indeed he could not well help doing, for Thoweynee had clearly acted under instruction, though there is some doubt whether Sa'eed had actually given orders for Hamud to be put to death. Sa'eed at once began to prosecute war against Kais-bin-Azzar. He moved first against Khabooreh, which soon submitted, and then with little difficulty recaptured Shinas. Ultimately^ deserted by the Kowasim, Kais made terms and retired to Rostak with a pension of $200 monthly, Sohar being surrendered to Sa'eed, who thus for the second time became its unques tioned possessor. Eager to be at rest again in his African home, Sa'eed, having tranquillised his country, sailed away from Muscat in the month of November 1852. By this campaign and his generally judicious arrangements with the leading Shaikhs and Chiefs of 'Oman, Sa'eed greatly increased his reputation, and his authority became more firmly established than it had been for many years previously. But the reign of peace was short, for scarcely had Sa'eed left 'Oman when the Wahabee Chief, AbduUa-bin-Feysal, with an unusually large force entered the country and re-occupied the old position at Bereymee. The terms he at first demanded were so extravagant that Thoweynee was unable to agree to them, and, proceeding to Sohar, assumed a hostile attitude. By the intervention of the British Resident, however, Abdulla-bin-Feysal lowered his tone, and an arrangement was eventually come to by which the annual tribute to Nejd was increased to twelve thousand dollars. Abdulla-bin-Feysal soon after returned to Nejd, leaving as general at Bereymee Ahmed-el Sadeyree to represent the Ameer's interests. Elated by his success against Kais, Sa'eed, on quitting his native country in 1852, had indulged the fond hope that he might be suffered to spend the remainder of his days in peace in the beautiful island he had chosen for his residence. His health and strength, it is said, had given way greatly in the last few years, and it was natural enough that at his age and with his enfeebled constitution he should seek repose. The recent incursion of the Wahabees, how ever, the vexatious treatment of the Wali Seyf-bin-Nebhan, and the continued aggression by the Persians at Bunder Abbass, forced him to turn his face towards Muscat. On the 15th April 1854, Sa'eed, who was very apprehensive at this time of French designs on his territory in East Africa, and who had been for three days and nights in consultation with the leading Arabs at Zanzibar on the subject, paid a visit to the British Consulate, and, placing the hand of his son Khalid in that of Colonel Hamerton, expressed the desire that Khalid should be guided by the Consul's advice in all his doubts and difficulties during his own absence, adding that, unless 5 a36 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Colonel Hamerton remained to support them neither Khalid nor the other leading Arabs would care to stay there. In token o£ approval and acceptanee of Sa'eed^s words the Arabs present all kissed Colonel Hamerton's hand and promised loyal compliance. Sa'eedthen embarked in the Victoria frigate on the 18th, and, bidding a reluctant adieu to the children and relatives he was never to see again, sailed for Muscat, where he arrived about a month later. Two months after Sa'eed's departure Captain Fremantle, H. M. S. who had been sent on a mission to obtain the cession by purchase of the Kooria Mooria Islands, on which were valuable guano deposits, arrived at Zanzibar. The French had on several occasions endeavoured to get possession of the guano, but their negociations had always failed. Captain Fremantle's eftorts, however, were more successful. Having proceeded on to Muscat, he had no sooner intimated the desire of the Government to acquire the islands than Sa'eed, at once refusino- the offer of purchase, agreed to their transfer, and made them over by a deed of gift, dated^Uth July 1854. One of the first acts of Sa'eed on his arrival at Muscat had been to appoint his fifth son, Toorkee, as Wali of Sohar, a post which he continued to hold for some years. The breach between Sa eed and the Persian Government, most probably with design on the part of the latter, gradually widened and culminated at length in the expulsion of Sa'eed's Wah and troops from Bunder Abbass. This district had been conquered in 1798 from the Bern Maeen by Sultan, and had since been uninterruptedly held in farm from Teheran for an annual rental of 6,000 tomans. Highly incensed at the proceedings of Persia, Sa'eed equipped an expedition and despatched it under Thoweynee to Bunder Abbass, which was soon re-occupied Fresh troops, however, were marched down from Shiraz, and, reinforced by these the Persian commander again expelled the Arabs, and Sa'eed, after an ineffectual blockade, was compelled to abandon the hope of recovering his supremacy over the Persian coast by force of arms Negociations were then opened, and a convention was eventually concluded in April 1856 by which the lease was renewed to Sa'eed by the Shah for 20 years at an increased rental of 16 000 tomans under several stringent conditions, which were very derogatory to Sa'eed's pride Unfavourable as the terms were, however, Sa'eed gladly accepted them rather than relinquish the farm, and he at once retook charge of Bunder Abbass and appointed a Wali and customs farmer to resume control over the territory. At this time the relations between England and Persia were greatly strained in conse quence of the occupation of Herat by the latter, and war was known to be imminent. Sa'eed however, did not wait to witness the denouement. One reason for this was, perhaps, his dis' appointment at not receiving more countenance and support from the British Government in his quarrel about Bunder Abbass, but a more cogent reason was his precarious state of health which made him impatient to get back to his home at Zanzibar. He stayed in Muscat there fore only until the change of the monsoon enabled him to turn his face southwards and then' having appointed his son Thoweynee his Deputy in Arabia, he set sail on the loth September in the Victoria frigate, accompanied by his son Barghash in the Artemise. Nature seems to have warned the aged prince of his approaching end. Before embarking he took a final and affectionate farewell of his old mother ^ Ghann^e, and said he felt confT- dent he would see her no more. He was particular in having a number of planks taken on board the Victoria, and gave orders that in the event of any one dying on the voyage a coffin was to be made and the body placed therein. On no account was it to be thrown into the sea After touching at Soor to transact business, Sa'eed continued his voyage, but on the 18th Sep* tember was taken ill with swelling of the legs and thighs; he continued to grow gradually worse until the 13th October, when dysentery set in, and on Sunday the 19th, at 8| a m his life passed quietly away. The Victoria was passing Coctivi Island at the time, and six days after arrived off Chumba Island in Zanzibar harbour, where she anchored with the Artemise. In obedience to Sa'eed's wishes, the Captain, Hilal-bin-Abdulla, had on his master's decease enclosed the body in a coffin and immediately on news of the sad event being communicated to Seyyid Majid at Zanzibar preparations were made for the burial. The corpse was landed the same night, and in presence of the sons and Arab notables was interred in the little cemetery near the palace, where a plain horizontal slab of white marble without inscription now marks the grave of 'Oman's famous prince. At the age of 66 years and 7 months, and after a reign of nearly 50 years, Sa'eed thus closed a career which can only be described as remarkable. Left an orphan when a mere youth.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883.84 37 his restless and enterprising spirit urged him to step over a cousin^s body to seize with avidity the reins of p'ower at a time when his country was harassed by foreign invaders and torn by intestine commotion. At such a time an abler and more experienced prince might well have shrunk from accepting the burden, but Sa'eed apparently felt himself equal to the position and proved himself to be so. His courage, capacity, and sustained energy enabled him to combat and eventually triumph over all difficulties until he had leisure to devote to the well-being of his own dominions, which he extended and raised to a pitch of prosperity they had never before witnessed. In character Sa^eed was a genuine Arab and possessed the contradictory and irre- concileable qualities common to that race. He was very courageous, and on many occasions displayed exalted personal bravery; he was amiable and gentle, though fiery and vindictive ; generous, yet niggardly; just and lenient, yet too often cruel and perfidious. He appears to have been above the average in general ability of his family, which is unquestionably one of superior intelligence in 'Oman, and he was admittedly unrivalled in the tact and discrimination he exhibited in dealing with the Arab tribes. One does not look for high statesmanship in a prince accustomed to such tortuous methods of rule as Sa'eed preferred, and his frequent failures and ill-considered campaigns are sufficient to disrobe him of any pretension to military genius. But he can claim the distinction that he was the first Arab prince to effect the pacification of the East Coast of Africa ; that he was at one period the first naval power in the East, not ex cepting the British, and that by his encouragement and protection of commerce he made his capital the emporium of trade between India, Persia, and Arabia, and immensely increased the wealth of his country. Whilst still young, Sa'eed had followed the example of his father. Sultan, and engaged extensively in trade, freighting his ships at every port in the Indian Ocean. Attracted by the equity of Sa'eed's government and the superior security of Muscat from piratical neighbours, the merchants of Bahrein, Basra, and Persia soon flocked to the port, which thus became an important entrepot and rose in a few years from an insignificant town to a city of 60,000 inhabitants. The rapid development of East African commerce was equally due to his fostering care and protection, and the wisdom and foresight he displayed in this matter were rewarded by the increase of his revenue, which was mainly derived from customs dues, from 200,000 dollars when he first assumed power to five or six times that amount in his later days. On nothing did Sauced lavish more money and attention than in acquiring and arming ships of war, and as regards number, and so he possessed certainly a respectable fleet. The largest vessel he ever possessed was the Liverpool, a two-decker of 74 guns,* which put to sea in 1826, and was presented by Sa'eed to King William IV about ten years later. In 1847, when his navy was somewhat reduced, it is said to have consisted of 9 frigates and corvettes, of which the largest was the Shah Allam of 54 guns, and half a dozen sloops and brigs. Sa'eed, however, had little real use for his ships, and did not know how to employ them; they were never kept in proper order, but were allowed to lie rotting in the harbour, where the appearance of power served nevertheless to gratify his vanity and love of ostentation in such matters. In 1840, when Mohammed Ali was threatening 'Oman and hostilities were anticipated, the Indian Government had some thoughts of utilising Sa'eed's fleet in their naval operations, until it was represented to them that, as the vessels were neither in seaworthy condition nor properly found, it would require a greater expenditure than was advisable to render them fit for service. Sa'eed's relations with the British Government were from almost the commencement of his career of the most friendly description, and, though this was of course in part the dictate of policy, for on several occasions his rule only escaped collapse by our timely intervention, yet he was unquestionably well disposed to us at heart j and the son who has followed closest in his father's steps in this respect, Toorkee, has been heard to say that Sa'eed repeatedly counselled his children to stand at all times loyally by the British Government, and never to refuse any request that might be made by them. According to Oriental usage the intimate relations existing between the British and Muscat Governments were marked by a constant interchange of presents. In return for the Liverpool Sa'eed was presented with a beautiful yacht called the Prince Regent-, and the magnificent presents despatched by him to Her Majesty on the occasion of her coronation were similarly acknowledged. Sa'eed had altogether three wives, two Persians, of whom the less said the better, and one Arab lady, viz., Azza-bin-Seyf Al-bu-Saudee, whose only child died ydnKg. All his other children, numbering twenty-four sons and about half as many daughters, were by concubines.v 38 ADMINISTEATION BEPOET OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL PART III. TRADE OF THE PERSIAN GULF DURING THE TEAR 1883. Tlie value and fluctuations o£ this trade can be approximately learnt from tlie annexed tables prepared with much care from all the available sources of information by Mr. G. Lucas, Vice-Consul at Bushire. Imports into Persia have continued to increase, and, as the goods imported were much in excess of the requirements of the markets, forced sales were often necessary at unremunerative prices. The increase of imports was most marked in piece-goods, metals, and loaf-sugar. Some of the European firms at Bushire opened branches at Shiraz and Ispahan, in view of supplying the large consuming districts direct, instead of through native agency. This has caused the retirement of some native merchants and the closing of many native agency houses at Bushire. Wheat was fairly abundant, fetched good prices, and was exported on a moderate scale. The agricultural districts benefited and were generally prosperous. The exports of opium decreased, severe losses on sales in China having deterred cultiva tors considerably. The pearl trade of the Gulf in 1883 was again unfavourable. The yield was good, but demand for pearls did not come up to the expectation of the dealers. Trade between the Gulf and Bombay received an impetus owing to the low rates of freight from Europe to Bombay, which enabled merchants to import more cheaply through Bombay than direct from Europe to the Gulf. In May 1883 a treaty of commerce was signed between the Netherlands and Persia, the terms of which corresponded generally with those of the French-Persian Commercial Treaty of 1855. The Dutch treaty provides, however, for the establishment of five Dutch Consulates in Persia,—e.e., at Bushire, Tabreez, Resht, Ispahan, and Mohammerah,—whereas the number of French Consuls have been limited to three. The Dutch treaty likewise provides for re-exportation of goods, on payment of one per cent, duty in addition to warehouse charges, and for the erection of special warehouses to this end at Bushire. The ratifications of this treaty were to have been exchanged at Teheran within a period of four months, but the term appears to have been extended. British merchants do not anticipate much advantage from this concession, as there is at present no re-export trade, and none is expected to spring up.eesidenct and muscat political agency for 1883-84. 39 APPENDIX B to PAET III. supplementary notes on care and culture of date trees and fruit. [ Vide page 43 of Administration Report for 1877-78 In districts where date plantations are large and on extensive scales, the cultivators do not think seriously of the comparatively small loss, caused by the depredations of wasps, sparrows, crows, ' bulbuls,' &amp;c., on the sweet date fruit while forming on the palm, and as a rule do not provide against sugar-loving insects and birds, and grudge them not a share of the fruit. They say that in the good old times the cultivators were more liberal-minded, when the export trade of the date to European countries and America did not exist, and those countries had not acquired a taste for this fruit j that then any number of strangers could go to a plantation and treat themselves ad libitum to any quantity of date fruit they liked, without objection. But times have changed. The demand for the fruit having largely increased, it is more taken care of, and strangers are not allowed to indulge in those liberties. But I believe that all this apparent indifference to the encroachments of the aforesaid creatures cannot be solely attributed to their alleged magnanimity and charitable feelings for them—at least in these days whan the fruit has a market value; but that their indolence and the actual difficulty, perhaps costliness, of the measures to provide against these inroads must explain a great deal. The ordinary wants of these people are few and simple; they are satisfied with what little they get, and are content to live on the same; as a result their inventive faculties are not taxed for devising means against such sources of loss, which certainly cannot be considered of no moment. But if the case was otherwise, and the struggle for life was as great as in European countries, protective measures would doubtless be fast forthcoming, simply because 'necessity is the mother of invention.^ In places where the date palms are few, and some choice dates are concerned, the date bunch is put into a gunny bag and the mouth of the bag closed up and tied securely at the lower part of the date spadix, to prevent the depredations of those insects and birds. At Bustak, Growda, Jenna, and other inland districts on the Persian mainland, where dry hot winds prevail, the cultivators allow the fruit to ripen and dry on the palm, and with a view to protect it from the injurious effects of very dry and hot winds as soon as the date has .become sweet, but before it has commenced to soften and become juicy, they wrap up the whole bunch, the stalk of which being already sufficiently bent down for purposes of easy manipulation, in the leafy twigs of a perennial bush called u salm,' and, securely tying the leafy covering, leave the bunch until jit is finally cut down when the date has ripened and formed. This method gives also a good deal of protection against the inroads of birds and wasps. In some districts, as those of Minab, sometimes bears prove destructive to the fruit; but the cultivator effectually provides against their climbing up by tying a quantity of some thorny bush or twigs of samr (thorny acacia) or koonay(zyzyphus) around the stem of the palm at some height from the ground. Against a flight of locusts he is perfectly helpless; all his attempts at driving them away, by beating about among the palms with dry date leaves, and agitating them to cause a rustling noise, &amp;c., and his burning quantities of hay, tamarisk branches, and other rubbish to create smoke, prove of little or no avail; as, when the locusts alight and squat, they completely devour the fruit and leave the palm, in a short space of time, divested of its leafy appendages. There are two principal forms in which the date fruit is cured and prepared for commercial purposes,—^., (1), 'khoorma,' soft and juicy; (2) &lt;f kharak-pookhta,' dry and firm. The following is the usual mode adopted for preparing 'khoorma' for commercial purposes: — As soon as the dates become ripe and juicy, they are picked off the, tree and gathered into a round chunam tank called 'madibsah,' where they are exposed to the sun and air, and throw off the excess of juice which runs through the aperture at the bottom of the ' madibsah/'' and collects in a separate jar, buried underground to receive it. After two or three days' exposure, when the date has sufficiently hardened and formed, it is removed and packed in date-leaf baskets for exportation. Sometimes, when the owner does not find a ready purchaser, he stores the date baskets in a close-plastered room called 'kandool' in piles of 15 to 20 baskets; the floor is furnished with channels which convey the juice thrown off under the mutual pressure of thd bags, to a large jar buried underground. Sometimes the juice is40 administration report of the persian gulp political slow in draining, then the cultivator encourages the flow by pouring a little warm water on the dates while they are in the madi^aihf But the dates thus treated and forced to give up their juice lose their taste and commercial value, and are not so much esteemed as those which are simply dried. The best method for curing dates is the following:— The fruit, as soon as it has become ' ratab,' i.e., ripe and juicy, is picked off the bunch and spread in an enclosed plot of ground Called (c mustah/' which is previously well beaten to render it firm, and sweeped clean to prevent dust from mixing up with the dates; or, better still, they are exposed to dry on date jowlies spread within the ' mustak' from three to five days, and then collected and packed in baskets. The following are the principal varieties of dates which are cured in the above method :— At Busrah and Moliammerah. —Guntar; Khadrawi; Hallowi; Baraim ; Dairee; Shakar; Sa^ameran; Kabkab; Zahidee Sayer. Sometimes small quantities of the following jjtates which are rare, and usually consumed in the fresh Kharak stage, are mixed with the above: Barhee; Jowzi; Loolooi; Khassab; Hamrawi; Firseej Shirsij Asgar, &amp;c. At'Dashti. —Seesee; Khanaizee; Zynadheeni; Kasp; Kabkab; Kandi; Shakar; Guntar; Hallowi; Muktoom; Shaikali; Kharoo; Sheereeni; Jowzi; Shahooni; Kaidi; Rash, &amp;c., &amp;c. At Batineh and 'Oman coast. —Musalla; Salani; Khanaizi; Hilali; Khassab; Maisali (principally made into Kharak); Barani; Sarashi; Maznaj ; Fardh; Khamri; Naghal; Khalas; Abunaranjah, &amp;c. At El Hasa, Kateef, and Bahrain. —Khalas; Khanaizi; Marzaban; Hilali; Khassab; &amp;c. At Minab, Bunder Ahhass, and Shamildt. —Khanaizi; Murda-sang; Hilali; Marzaban; Azad; Zarrak; Sahkari; Ab-dandan; Mandal; Kalak Soorkh; Malak-Soorkh; Shaikh Kamali; Dang-Safeed; Chattan; Hallow; Ali-mehtari; Soorkh-dang; Mosalli; Mosalla; Naghal; Shahri Sa^Ameran, &amp;c. &amp;c. There are other varieties not well known, and are comprised under the general term ' Kharoo/' At El Hasa the best dates, principally Khalas, are packed in skins of 70 to 120 pounds for export. So also at Busrah dates are packed in skins; the dates are picked for the purpose; the skins are then allowed to dry in the sun and covered with gunny. At Bahrain and Kateef, Khalas and other dates of superior quality are put in small earthen jars and rendered palatable by adding to them small quantities of sesame seeds and ginger powder; the jars are then sewn up in the date-leaf matting. Now, since the European and American firms have commenced to send dates to their own countries, they have adopted the system of packing the best dates— i.e., Hallowi, Khadrawi, Zahedi, and Sayer—in deal boxes of various shapes and sizes, brought ready made from those countries. The average size of a box is about 45 pounds net weight. Hallowi dates are also carefully packed in small cardboard boxes, 10 to X5 of which are then put in a large deal box, which is then nailed over. The best dried dates of sound skin, and specially those which are allowed to dry on the palm, are carefully picked by a large number of labourers, principally women, boys, and girls, employed for the purpose. A certain weight of dates so picked intended to go in a box is taken; the dates are then carefully placed, one by one, in rows, so as to form layers in the box, which is lined with paper and eventually nailed and ready for export. Some people put hoops round the boxes and cover them with gunny, while others do not. These layers are pressed down three or four times during the filling of each box. The dates packed in boxes in layers throughout have now the best repute in the market. Small quantities of dates have lately been shipped from Busrah in fancy baskets, but on account of the heavy freight no sanguine hopes are entertained of this method proving a success. Hallowis keep best, but Zahidis are the brightest in colour, but soon get wormy and spoiled. The cultivator has other modes of curing fresh dates and making preserves of them in small quantities for his personal use and for presents to his friends, and even for sale to a small extent. ' Khoorma-Sheerah' is generally made of Murda-sang and Khanaizi dates- The best dates are culled and further well dried in the sun, exposed on mats or date jowlies, and protected during nights from dews. They are then washed with diluted date juice, of all dust, &amp;c., and put in a jar mixed with sesame seeds, ginger, walnut kernel, &amp;c.; a quantity of good date juice is poured in so as to cover the whole. This is much prized by the natives. ' Khoorma Seh-Roza/ - ' so named from its beiug fit to be eaten on the third day of its being potted. It is a rare and special preparation made at Minab from the Hilali dates. The fresh6 RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1883-84. 41 'ratab' is taken, its skin is removed by the date-leaf spine; then the coarser but soft layer of the pulp; finally the white firm pulp which is left round the stone is further detached and collected in small earthen pots. The mass is rendered more palatable by adding to it a quantity of pistachio and almonds, &amp;c. This is considered a great delicacy. ' Khoorma Post-kandah,' the skinned date.—This can be prepared from all the good varieties of dates, but it is generally made from the Hilali. As above, the skin of the fresh ' ratab ' is removed by the date spine, the stone is pushed out by the same; the fleshy part is gathered and packed in large earthen pots. Moorabba Khoorma' (date preserve).—The ripe 'Kharak of Hilali,' ^.e., before they have become 'ratab' (soft and juicy), are taken; portions from both ends are sliced off; they are then deeply punctured all over by the date spine and well dried in the sun. The stone is sometimes replaced by almond or pistachio. The 'Kharak' thus treated is boiled in sugar syrup to a sufficient consistence, and forms an excellent preserve, and may be bottled and kept for any length of time. ' Matgoogah.'—The sweet and fresh ' Kharak' is broken up and dried in the sun for five or six days. It is then pounded in a wooden mortar; the powder is put in boiling date juice and mixed with sesame seeds and flavoured with cardamoms, cinnamon, &amp;c. The whole mass is then well stirred while boiling, and removed from the fire and further well mixed up, and finally put in jars for use. The second form in which the date fruit is cured for commercial purposes is the ' Kharak pookhta,' the boiled date. It is prepared as follows When the ' Kharak ' has become sweet, but before it has begun to soften, the spadix, with its load of dates, is cut off from the palm and immersed in large copper pots of boiling water, in which it is allowed, to remain for a time, which is decided by the man engaged to do the work. It is stated that the boiling is continued until the stone assumes a reddish colour; when the bunches are removed and exposed to dry in sun on mats for eight or ten days; they are then detached from the spadix, allowed to dry further, and finally put in bags for export. The fruit of all the varieties of the date palm can thus be converted to ' Kharak-pookhtah,' which is dry, firm, and even hard, and does not relish so much as the ff Khoorma,' which is soft and juicy. This may perhaps account for the small quantity of a Kharak' usually prepared. At Busrah ' Kharak-pookhtah ' is prepared in small quantities from Baraim, Sa'Ameran, Kabkab, IMaktoom, and Shakar. Baraim yields the best quality, and is said to be wholly converted into Kharak, as it does not ripen beyond the ' Kharak ' stage ; its price being two or three times more than that of Sa'Ameran Kharak, which is also abundant. The best ' Kharak-pookhtah ' of Minab is from Hallowi in small quantity, but princi pally from Zarak and Sayer. At Lar and its neighbourhood a ' Kharak-pookhtah ' is obtained from the Sha-Khani date. As soon as the fresh Kharak has been sufficiently boiled, it is taken out of the water, its stone removed, and it is strung in long wreaths and hung up to dry j it is yellow and of good taste. Prom various causes a portion of the date-fruit does not attain maturity, and generally drops off in a half-ripe state; becomes dry, skinny, with very little flesh. In this condition it is called ' Salang,' and used as food for sheep and domestic cattle; sometimes it is boiled with date stones and constitutes a nutritious food to the milch-cow. The age of an off-shoot is no reliable guide for its being detached from its parent for pur poses of a successful transplantation. An offshoot sometimes continues at the foot of its parent several years, but under the various unfavourable circumstances of soil, supply of water, &amp;c., it is small and weak, and therefore unfit for transplantation; while under favourable circum stances an offshoot, 3 or 4 years old, is vigorous and large, and does not usually, when trans planted, fail to strike root and survive. Hence the vigour of growth and the actual size of the young plant are taken into consideration. The average weight cf the young plant most suitable for purposes of transplantation is considered to be six pounds ; but larger weights are preferred, as, after striking, the plant grows rapidly, and bears fruit without much trouble and expense to the cultivator. It is averred that sometimes offshoots which have commenced to bear fruit are carefully detached and successfully transplanted. The Thcenix dactylifera, or the Arabian date palm, being dioecious,— i e., the male and female flowers existing on separate plants,—the conveyance of the pollen to the female flowers is essential to fertilisation and formation of the date fruit.42 administration report op the pee si an gulp political The agency of winds and various nectar-loving flies and insects does not seem to be suffi cient to effect tlie necessary fecundation, as in such cases the fruit yielded is stated to become abortive or blighted, with little flesh, without stone, and totally insipid, and is termed ' Shis/'' Consequently human agency is considered essential for a fruitful impregnation. The male spathe, as soon as it has attained its full size and maturity, which is known to the cultivator by certain signs and indications, such as a faint rustling sound, elicited when the central part of the spathe is gently pressed, or a peculiar seminal odour, detected by making a slight indentation in the marginal part of the spathe, so as to expose the flower, which is cut at its root and taken down. The enclosing spathe is slit open and the flower-sprigs are gently detached from the spadix, and carefully preserved in a basket, which is suspended in a spot protected from drafts of wind ; the sprigs are allowed to dry for 20 to 24 hours before being used. As soon as the female flowers have split open the spathe under their growing pressure, the cultivator considers it time to commence the operation of fertilisation. He takes the flower-twigs of the male palm, and deposits one or two in each bunch of the female blossom, lightly binding it up with a strip of date leaf. If the cultivator finds that some of the larger spathes have not split, to save him the trouble of reclimbing, he slits them open and deposits the flower-sprigs in the blossom, as before. Only very small ones he leaves untouched, to be attended to, if necessary, subsequently, when they have attained maturity. But, as a rule, he does not allow all the flower-spathes, which vary from 12 to 24, to remain on the palm and form fruit, because by doing so the fruit becomes small and degenerate, and during the next year the yield of the fruit is lessened. According to the vigour of the palm, which he knows by ex perience, he leaves 8 to, 12 bunches to form fruit. The excess is removed and consumed by his people and friends. The sprigs of the male flower are preserved, in a dry form one or two months and used as occasion demands. They are, however, before being used, slightly moistened with water to prevent the pollen from being scattered and blown away by the wind. It is stated that sometimes, when the male flower is not in sufficient quantity at ' Kharg,' the cultivators import it from Busrah. Pollen of one year cannot, it is stated, be preserved for use during the next year, as it becomes spoiled- When the female blossom has thus been treated with pollen, the supply of water is cut off for a time, varying from one and a half to two months, as excess of water is said to be detrimental to a proper fertilisation. The general method adopted for cultivating the date palm in these parts, where it is grown for economic and commercial purposes, is that it is planted in extensive groves for facilities of tending them and collecting the fruit. Spots are. selected where abundance of water is avail able in shape of river, spring, ' kanat,' or well water ; in other places, where water from wells is scanty, such spots are selected as can be irrigated by rain-torrents during the rainy season. A plot of ground is selected according to the number of palms which it is intended to plant in a grove, which may consist of 80 to 150 or 200 palms, planted in regular rows, with a distance of 12 to 15 feet between them. The grove is surrounded by a high ' bund ' for purposes of admitting and retaining water in the grove, and generally regulating its irrigation, being provided with inlets and outlets to admit and get rid of excess of water, especially that from rain-torrents. For the first two or three months, after the offshoots have been planted, they are watered, each separately, by water carried to them in pots ; great care is taken that no mud gets into the heart, or crown of the young plant, as it proves destructive to it. After the plants have struck root they are watered once a week, a fortnight, or a longer interval is allowed to elapse, but it is essential that they must be well watered once a month. When they have grown up and have attained some age, they are watered once a month during the hot months only. At Busrah, where water is abundant from the river, deep and wide trenches are dug between the rows of the palms, and filled with water. But where water is scanty it is allowed to run down in small channels to the foot of each palm, the ground being previously well dug up, loosened, and turned over to allow of its thorough saturation. Vegetables, lucerne, &amp;c., are grown, as at Bahrain, in these groves, such a cultivation being considered highly beneficial in improving the soil. With this object also the soil is ploughed and turned over once a year to render it soft, porous, and permeable to ai/moisture. In places which border the sea, fins of Awal or Lookhm, a species of Ray-fish, are used for purposes of manuring the palm j two or three bits are buried at the foot of each palm, and it is regularly watered once or twice a week until the whole is absorbed and disappears; orEBSIDENOY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1883-84. 43 these fins are put in, and -wed to macerate in the tank o£ water which feeds the plantation, and the palms are regulai ^ed by water so impregnated. In other places where this is not available, the dung o£ the /, sheep, and goats, &amp;c., and surface sweepings are used. The best spot for extensive date plantations would be 3 as at Busrah, Mohammerah, and Minab, along the river banks abounding in alluvial soil. Excess of water generally is said to spoil the date fruit, and if the plantations become flooded and continue so any length of time by any very unusual rise of river waters, not only is the fruit damaged, but the palms have been known to die. So also damp air, when the fruit is forming, is said to be prejudicial, as a great deal of it drops off in a green state; this green date is called ' Khamal/' and is given to sheep and cattle ; but the poor people consume it with fish. Moderately dry winds are said to be very beneficial. To secure a vigorous growth to the palm, as also to obtain materials for economic purposes, the following points require to be attended to. As the date palm grows each year the lower whorls of the leafy stalks, as their vitality diminishes and they become dry, are chopped off; the long stalks called ' Goorz ^ are made into jowlies for covering sheds, roofs of houses, and various economic purposes. Their lower thick ends, called ' tapool,' are used for fuel, but those which are broad and light are used as floats for fish-nets. The flower spadix and its spathe must also be removed. The green spadix, when well beaten with billets of wood, yields a quantity of fibre useful for rope-making. In a dry state it is used as fuel, but if allowed to macerate and soften in water on being pounded between billets of wood yields fibres for ropes. From the fresh spathe, called ' Tara,' is obtained the ' Tara' water, by distillation. It is of a strong but agreeable smell, and is prepared at Busrah and Bahrain; sold in carboys at one and a half to two rupees each. It is made into a sherbet, and is greatly prized by the Arabs and Persians. The young offshoots sprouting at the base of the palm, if they are not intended for trans plantation, must be removed in the spring of each year, as they prevent it from thriving. In the same way the buds, which sometimes form and grow from the crown of the palm, resembling the offshoots at the base, must also be pulled away, as they weaken the palm. These buds are sometimes said to have grown and yielded fruit when allowed to grow on the palm. (Signed) A, R.

PART I.—GENERAL. 1.—MUSCAT—OMAN. Lieutenant-Colonel Miles' resume of the leading events at Muscat and in Oman during the past official year forms the second part of this Administration Report. 2. Colonel Miles' tour in Her Majesty's Ship Dragon round the south-eastern coast of Oman in December deserves notice as having been a voyage of great interest and utility. A portion of the report on the subject is reproduced as Appendix A to Part II. ^.—PIRATE COAST OF OMAN. 3. The past year has been uneventful for this part of Oman. 4. The Jowasimi Chief Hameyd-bin-Abdullah continues to rule this town and district. An unimportant raid was made by a party of the Ras-el -Khaimah. Monasir into a district of Ras-el-Khaimah in May- Subsequently this quarrel was made up by the mediation of the Chiefs of Debay and Shargah. In June a shock of earthquake was felt at Ras-el-Khaimah. 5. The Chief of this township, Ahmed-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali, having sent presents to the Sultan of Zanzibar, received in return a Umm-el-Kawam. quantity of gunpowder and lead and some clothing. 6. Chief Rashid -bin-Hameyd, Al-bu-Ali. During the pearl-fishing season (June 1884) an Ejmau boat was attacked and fired on by one Seif-el- E3man • Adham, who resides on the island of Sirri, and who had previously behaved in a turbulent manner. The offence, which constituted a breach of the maritime truce, having been clearly proved. Her Majesty's Ship Philomel proceeded with the Residency Agent for the Arab coast to Sirri, and burned the boat of Seif-el-Adham in a public manner. 7. The new Chief of Shargah, Sakar-bin-Khalid, has continued in undisturbed possession. He renewed his request to the Resident that security for Shargah. g 00C [ behaviour might be taken from the ex-Chief Salim- bin-Sultan, who continued to reside in the island of Boo Moosa, and who was likely, the Chief feared, to disturb the peace at sea. To this letter the Resident replied, referring Shaikh Sakar to the previous letter mentioned in paragraph 16 of the Annual Report for 1883-84. 8. The township of Himriyah is nominally a dependency of Shargah, but the Shargah Chief exercises hardly any real authority over the Chief of Himnyah. In April the Chief of Shargah invited Saif-biu-Abdul-Rahman, Chief of Himriyah, to visit Shargah, and on arrival of Saif, the latter's brother, Muhammad, was sent to Himriyah to assume the office of Chief, Saif-bin-Abdul-Rahman immediately returned to Himnyah and expelled his brother from the place. 9. Some disturbances, as is common, occurred in the districts of the Batinah coast, nomi nally subject to Shargah. Hamad-bin-Abdullah, Chief of Fajeyrah, attacked the towns ofADMINISTEATION EEPOET OP THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL Ghareyfa and Bishna, on which the men of Zobarah marched to the aid of Bishna. Hamad- bin-Abdullah then attacked Zobarah, plundering it and killing abaut twelve of the inhabitants. Hamad on his side lost eight men. Ghareyfa and Bishna both fell into the hands of Hamad- bin-Abdullah. 10. In May the Government Agent reported that a moollah, residing at Shargah, named Hoosain-bin-Temeem, was busying himself in favour of the soi-disant Mahdi of the Soudan, advising the people of Shargah to join the Mahdi at Mecca, and causing some excitement amongst them. The Agent was instructed to take no notice of the moollah's sayings, but to caution the Chief of Shargah that he would be held responsible for any annoyance befalling British subjects ensuing on such meddlesome attempts at agitation. 11. In October, a person calling himself Ahmed-bin-Muhammad, Saif-el-Islam, and repre senting himself to be a Shereef of Sana, visited the pirate coast ports and distributed some presents of armour, shields, &amp;c. It was thought that he was an emissary of the Mahdi. 12. The Chief of Debay, Hashar-bin-Maktoom, Al-bu-Falasa, received a visit from Nasir-bin-Mubarik, the Bahrain Sheikh, now residing in El-Katr. Nasir was accompanied by the headmen of the Beni-Hajir and Monasir tribes of Katr, and his object was to effect a reconciliation between the Oman and Katr Bedouins. Debay. 13. In July some Debay men left for the Red Sea, giving out that they intended joinino- the Mahdi if he turned out to be the predicted prophet. 14. Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabbi and head of the Beni Yas, is the most powerful and influential of the pirate coast Abu Dbabbi. Chiefs. 15. In return for three horses presented to the Sultan of Muscat, Sheikh Zaid received a sum of Rs. 2,250 and a present of cloth. 16. During the year the Abu Dhabbi districts were undisturbed. 17. The various Chiefs on the pirate coast behaved on the whole in a satisfactory manner • but the Chief of Debay laid himself open to censure by allowing newly- run slaves from Africa to be landed and sold at his port. The steps taken in the matter will be mentioned under the head of 'Slavery/' 3.—BAHRAIN. 18. Many successive years of tranquillity and security have, as might be expected, brought increase of wealth and prosperity to these islands. The past year was no exception; and although the date crop suffered somewhat from unfavourable condition of weather, commerce was active and the pearl banks yielded a good return. 19. The security of the seas was maintained, and the rulers of Bahrain preserved friendly relations with all their neighbours. Presents were exchanged between Sheikh 'Eesa-bin-Ali and Sheikh Jasim of El-Bida, and the Na'eem tribe continue in close friendly relations with the Bahrain Chiefs. 20. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Ali, brother of the Chief, visited Busrah in September. He had intended to go to Kowait, but gave up that trip. 21. A communication having been received from the Resident at Aden, mooting the question of the release of Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, the Resident consulted Sheikh ^Eesa personally on the subject, and found that the Chief was entirely opposed to such a step, and considered it would lead to disturbance of the peace of his islands. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR. 22. For some years a desultory warfare has been carried on from time to time between the Wahabi Amirs and the Amir of Hayel or Jebel Shamar, Muhammad-bin-Rashid. These hostilities seem to have on the whole resulted favourably for the Shamar Chief. Some reports attributed his success to the possession of a number of Martini rifles, but according to all recent travellers the organization of the Shamar is superior. 23. About May last, reports came to the effect that Abdullah-ibn-Feysal, the Riadh Amir, had made overtures to the Shamar Chief, which the latter was disposed to listen to, provided Abdallah's nephew, Muhammad-bin-Su'ood, were a party to the proposed peace. TheEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-85. 7' latest news received is tliat AbdallaTi-bin-Su'ood was deputed by his uncle and brothers to negotiate terms of peace with Muhammad-ibn-Rashid, and that the principle of uti possidetis had been accepted by both sides and presents exchanged. The intelligence still requires confirmation. 24. Sa'eed Pasha has continued to govern this district El-Hasa. on the part of the Porte, and appears to do so with marked ability. 25. A robbery was committed in August by a gang of Beni Hajir on a boat belong ing to El-Katr whilst lying at anchor at El-Kateef. Some of the Beni Hajir tribe were arrested. 26. In March 1884 it was reported that several boats of Bahrain had been impressed for conveyance of Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Ras Tanoorah. The complaint having been sub mitted by the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to Constantinople., the Crovernment of the Porte denied the truth of the report, on which Her Majesty's Ambassador desired to be furnished with additional proof, so as to be able to convince the Porte of the truth of the allegation. Further depositions of eye-witnesses, attested by a Kadhi, were accordingly furnished in July. 27. The case of a boat belonging to a British Indian similarly impressed was also submit ted, and the Political Agent at Baghdad endeavoured to induce the Wali of Baghdad to afford some compensation. 28. In April Nasir-bin-Mubarik wrote to the Resident, saying he was anxious to maintain ^ ^ friendly relations with the British Government and to act in accordance with their wishes, and expressing a desire to send a messenger to Bushire. A reply was sent to the effect that the Resident would be happy to receive his messenger. In July the messenger, Khamees-bin-Jooma, arrived in Bushire, and it turned out that Nasir-bin-Mubarik's request was that the Resident should obtain resti tution of his groves in Bahrain which were confiscated many years ago. The Resident in formed Khamees that he declined to recommend this proposal to the Chief of Bahrain. 29. In April a branch of the Beni Hajir raided the Katr coast, and killed the son of Ali-bin-Rashid, Chief of Wakrah. 30. In May Sheikh Jasim of El-Bida wrote to the Resident, stating that he had resigned the Government of El-Bida and professing friendly sentiments. 31.. In July the Residency Agent at Bahrain reported that Sheikh Jasim contemplated putting to sea with a force with a view to attacking some of the Beni Hajir residing at Zahran. A letter was addressed to Sheikh Jasim desiring bim to abandon that intention. 32. The adherents of Sheikh Jasim in El-Katr had been for some time at enmity with the 'Ajman tribe of El-Hasa, and great fears were entertained of an attack being made by the 'Ajman on El-Bida. The ■'Ajman, however, abandoned their intention of attacking Katr, and proceeded to a watering station called Booneyzan between Katr and Oman. The 'Ajman were joined by a branch of the A1 Morrah and some Beni Hajir, hostile to the people of El-Katr and the total force was said to be 2,000. They were opposed at Booneyzan by a body of 1,200 Arabs composed of A1 Monasir and rival branches of A1 Morrah and Beni Hajir, and a severe fight occurred, in which the 'Ajman and their allies were completely defeated with heavy loss. As the victors were friends and partizans of Sheikh Jasim, the latter was much elated. 33. It was expected that the 'Ajman would assemble in force in Hasa and attack Katr in view to retrieving their lost prestige and avenging themselves on their enemies, but hitherto no such attempt has been made. Sheikh Jasim sent a present of four horses to the Sultan of Muscat, and received some ammunition in return. 5.—EARS. 34. The arrangements for the administration of the province of Ears, described in para graphs 32 and 33 of the Annual Report for 1883-84, have remained unaltered. 35. Mirza Muhammad Khan, formerly Foreign Office Agent at Bushire, was, in May, appointed Foreign Office Agent for Shiraz, 36. The Shiraz districts have not been free from petty disturbances and robberies, which occurrences are owing to the slackness of the present Government of Fars. The province ofADMINISTEATIOX EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL Pars requires a firm and united administration, and at present dissensions and ill-feeling exist amongst the members of the family clique, who share the central authority amongst them. The present administration of Fars compares unfavourably with that of former years when His Royal Highness the Motemid-ed-Dowlah was Governor General. 37. Sultan Muhammad Khan remains Eel-Khanee, and Darab Khan Eel-Begee of the Kashgai Eeliyats. 38. The Governor of Bushire, Muhammad Husain Khan, son of the Sahib Diwan, was Bushire. granted by the Shah the title of Motemin-el-Mulk. 39. The customs revenues of Bushire and its districts were managed by Muhammad Husain Khan, who is Agent of the Ameen-es-Sultan. 40. In April orders were received by the Customs Commissioner from the Ameen-es-Sultan forbidding him to accept receipts for payment of export duty on grain passed to foreign merchants or their agents by Governors of other ports of Ears or Arabistan. The Governors of Reeg, Deelam, &amp;c., were then told by the Government of Ears to avoid passing receipts for export duty, and to levy the amount under some other name, or in an indirect manner. The matter having been referred to H. M/s Minister, stringent orders were issued by the Persian Government to the Government of Ears to refund all duty levied in excess of 5 per cent, and refrain from exacting double duty in future. In August several such overpayments were refunded, but in spite of all orders and protests, British merchants still complain that in some form or other they are subjected to double export duty on grain purchased for them at outports. 41. In July an affray occurred at Bushire between Persian soldiers and some people of Dashti, who had come with the widow of Muhammad Khan, late Governor of Dashti. In this affray a few lives were lost. The blame rested with the officiating Governor of Bushire. 42. Aga Muhammad Mehdi, the ' Melek-et-Tujar, ' of Bushire, having returned from a tour in Europe, inaugurated some measures of a sanitary nature, and has also undertaken to build a sea wall, to prevent the sea from flooding the plain outside the walls of Bushire. 43. In October Mr. R. C. Keun, Consul-General for Holland, returned to Bushire, having been absent for several years. 44. The coast between Bushire and Lingah has enjoyed quiet during the year. 45. Lingah suffered from great scarcity of water until the autumn, when heavy showers Lingah. replenished the reservoirs. Sevefal shocks of earthquake were felt, but no damage occurred from them. 46.

A violent gale of wind with heavy rain burst over Lingah on 24th Eebruary, destroying and damaging many houses. 48. A quarrel occurred in March between the Chief of Lingah and the Chief of Charak, which, after nearly resulting in hostilities, was settled by mediation. 49. Bunder Abbass has been for the most part governed by Muhammad Husain Khan Bunder Abbas. personally, and his administration was satisfactory. During his absence, however, the proceedings of his agents were much complained of. 50. The Hindu community were much agitated at the conversion of a Hindu fakir to Islam in Eebruary, and for some days they closed their shops. The case has been investigated on the spot, and the convert having been examined at Bushire, it appeared that his conversion was voluntary, and although there was strong suspicion of his having stolen valuables from the Hindu temple, proof of this was not forthcoming. The conduct of the Persian author ities was shewn to have been blameworthy, and at the Resident's suggestion Muhammad Husain Khan promised to remove those in fault. It was thought advisable that the convert should not return to Bunder Abbass. 51. Mirza Ismail Khan, son of Muhammad Khan, Eoreign Agent of Shiraz, was ap pointed Eoreign Office Agent at Bunder Abbass, but left for Shiraz in March. 52. Muhammad Husain Khan, Deputy Governor of Bundar Abbass and Lingah and Commissioner of Customs i resigned his posts in March, and Shahzadah Muhammad Husain Miiza, grandson of his late Royal Highness the Rukn-ed-dowlah, has Been appointed his suc cessor in all his offices.EESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 9 53. The island of Kishm suffered from repeated shocks o£ earthquake, and it is reported that considerable changes have occurred in the soundings in the neighbourhoood o£ Kishm. On 20th May a very severe shock of earthquake caused the partial destruction of upwards of thirty villages and the death of 132 persons, mostly women and children. A large number of the inhabitants left Kishm and much distress existed. On hearing of this His Majesty the Shah ^granted a sum of 1,400 tomans towards the relief of destitute persons and repair of mosques. The current year's revenues were also remitted, and the new Governor, Shaikh Ibra him, prohibited from levying taxes. In order to make up for this the revenues of the salt mines of Kishm were assigned to the Governor. 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 54. The Ihtisham -es-Sultanah was removed from the Government of Arabistan, and the Muzaffir-ul-mulk, Governor of Burojird and Khoramabad, was appointed by H. R, H. Zil-es- Sultan, Governor of Burojird, Khoramabad, Luristan, and Arabistan. 55. Shaikh Muhammad, brother of Shaikh Mizal, Governor of Mohammerah, who had been detained at Ispahan, was released. 56. Shaikh Mizal entertains fears of being compelled, by large pecuniary demands, to withdraw from Muhammarah. 57. The Muzaffir-ul-mulk recently advanced towards Mohammerah with two Persian regiments, and many of the Arab Shaikhs were preparing to move into Turkish territory. 7.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 58. Sirteep Ibrahim Khan died early in the year, and it was reported that many Baluch who emigrated from fear of his oppression were returning to their native land. 59. The alleged murder of an Indian in Baho, referred to in paragraph 62 of last year's report, was further pressed on the Persian Government by Her Majesty's Minister, and orders were issued to the Governor of Kerman to use all endeavours to arrest the guilty person and have him sent to Kerman. 60. In September the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, reported that a man employed as a khalasi in an Indian vessel had been seized at Charbar and taken to Pareg. It appeared that the khalasi had formerly been a slave and had several years ago escaped to Kurrachee, and a Baluch, claiming to be his former owner, now reclaimed him. Meer Hotee, Chief of the district, being appealed to, justified the act, on which H. M. Minister at Teheran was asked to move the Persian Government in view to the release of the man. Ordors to the desired effect have been issued by the Governor of Kerman, and it is hoped the matter will soon be satis factorily settled. 61. Two Indian traders complained in autumn of having been plundered near Jalk, and orders were issued by the Governor of Kerman for strict inquiry. 62. Disturbances have occurred between Rinds and people of the Baho district with loss of a few lives. The Rinds were primarily in fault. The Wali of Gwadur was asked to mediate, but the result is not yet known. 63. The Prince Nasir-ed-dowlah, Deputy Governor of Kerman, proceeded to Bampur and was met by all chiefs of Persi-Baluch districts. Several of the latter are reported to have been imprisoned and fined, but for what reasons is unknown. 64. An inquiry held by Colonel Miles and Colonel Reynolds into the Rind-Gwadur disputes terminated on 23rd March, 65. Mr. B. Ffinch, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, was re-appointed to Political charge of the Mekran Coast in August. 8.—BASSIDORE. 66. This station has continued in charge of a coal agent, and there is nothing of interest to report regarding it. The earthquakes so severely felt in other parts of Kishm island did no damage at Bassidore station. 9.—SLAVE TRADE. 67. In the year 1884 there was a marked increase of the slave traffic from Africa to Oman. 68. In May Colonel Miles reported that he had information that attempts would be made to run many cargoes of slaves from the African Coast, and His Highness Seyyid Toorkee in JuneADMINISTEATION EE POET OF THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL issued a proclamation warning his subjects against transgressing the orders prohibiting this traffic. In October, on information being received of the landing of several large cargoes of slaves on the Batinah Coast, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee issued a fresh proclamation and addressed letters to all the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, asking them to seize all slaves brought by Muscat people to their ports and to punish the importers. . In October the Government Agent at Shargah reported that 54 slaves had been landed at Debay, and that in spite of his protest the Chief of Debay had countenanced their sale at Debay. The Agent was instructed to demand the surrender of all freshly-imported Africans, and a letter was addressed to the Chief of Debay and all the Trucial Chiefs reminding them of their engagement to the British Government, and desiring the surrender of all slaves landed in their districts. Subsequently, Mr. Robertson, Eirst Assistant Resident, proceeded to the Arab coast in H. M. S. Dragon and succeeded in recovering 21 slaves. Four more were afterwards sent onboard H. M. S. Dragon by the Chief of Debay, who was made to pay dollars 70 a head for others he failed to produce, by way of fine. One slave boy was recovered at Shargah, one at Bahrain, and one at XJmm-el-Kawain. 70. On the Persian coast near Lingah an attempt was made to carry off three Africans residing at Bassidore, but through the exertions of the Government Agent at Lingah the Chief of Moghoo obtained their release. 71. The Political Agent at Muscat recovered and released one African kidnapped from Aden, and four other men, considered to have been imported of recent years, took refuge at the Muscat Consulate. It was thought due to the peculiar circumstances of their case to recommend their release and the indemnification of the alleged owners. 72. Two slavers were captured by Her Majesty^s containing 205 Africans chiefly women and children. The slave dealers captured were imprisoned by His Highness the Sultan. 73. Seyyid Toorkee was thanked by the Government of India for his friendly action regarding slave traffic. 74 Four fugitive slaves took asylum at the telegraph village at Jask, and subsequeotly got on board H. M. S. Dragon and were landed at Karachi. 10.—OFFICIAL CHANGES AND HER MAJESTY'S SHIPS. D , 75 -, In v July th !

V ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-1885. 3en Political, —The close of the year 1883 saw the re-establishment of His Highness Seyyid leit Toorkee's prestige and the vindication of his authority by the suppression of his brother's te^ rebellion. In the present year under review. His Highnesses position has been still further strengthened by the recovery of two fortresses, one on the coast and the other in the interior, fes which had been for a long time in the hands of disaffected Chiefs. In April 1884, the Sultan being dissatisfied with the conduct of Sheikh Muhammad-bin- ere Nasir, El Ruahy, invited him to Muscat, intending to replace him at Zikki by a more obedient ars and devoted adherent. Sheikh Muhammad came as far as Semail, but having his suspicions at aroused returned thence to his fort. In this month the Beni Battash, a powerful tribe in El Sharkiyeh, which had for some ins time been estranged, became reconciled to His Higkness, In May a second attempt was made to induce Sheikh Muhammad Nasir to visit Muscat, and this time with better success. Having received a promise of safety, and believing the word iin of the envoys, he presented himself before the Sultan, by whom he was immediately imprisoned, he Sheikh Muhammad then agreed to surrender the fort of Zikki on certain terms ; but on these Qd being made known to the tribe, the latter became indignant at the treatment of their Sheikh, and repudiated the agreement. ls On the 22nd May, the most learned and influential Metowwa or priest in Oman, Muham* ^ mad-El-Gharibi, died at Khudthra in the Batineh. On the 26th, letters and rumours reached Muscat of an intended rising on the part of the Sharkiyeh tribes under the leadership of Sheikh Saleh. A raid on the Batineh coast was also contemplated by Sheikh Hamood-El-Jahafee; but these mischief-makers failed to receive the support they expected, and their schemes ultimately fell through. jy On the 26th June, the Political Agent proceeded to the Batineh in Her Majesty's ship Dragon, to assure himself of the safety of Indian British subjects residing on that coast. In July, a serious conflict took place between the Harth and Mesakereh tribes of El Shar kiyeh, which are constantly at feud, in which about 20 men were killed and wounded. The Sultan received a visit on the 27th of the following month from Sheikh Tahnoon- bin-Zaeed-bin-Khalifa, who arrived from Abuthabee by sea. After several ineffectual missions and much correspondence, the negociations with the Beni Ruweyheh for the surrender of the fort at Zikki, were at length brought to a successful d termination through the mediation of the people of Nakhal, and Sheikh Muhammad was released from confinement on the 4th September. By agreement the tribe received a sum of ^2,500 for giving up the fort. The fort was entrusted by the Sultan to Suleiman-bin- Suweylim, who was despatched from Muscat with a garrison to receive charge. In this month the Wazir, Seyyid Saeed, proceeded to Soor in the Dar-el-Salaam and effected an arrangement with the Jenebeh about the payment of customs duties and for the erection of a wall round the town. On the 4th October, the fort of Soweyk was yielded up to the Sultan by Saood-bin-Seyf, Beni Ruweyheh on payment of $500. About the same time Sheikh Hilal-bin-Zahir of Nezwa raided the Jenebeh at Rakkeh in the Province of Oman, and inflicted a loss of ten killed on that tribe. On the 31st October, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf arrived at Muscat and ' had an interview with the Sultan on the subject of Gwudur affairs. The Political Resident left Muscat to return to Bushire on the 3rd November. In November, negociations were renewed with Sheikh Hilal for the surrender of the fort at Nezwa, but they failed as before. Sheikh Hilal consented to receive the sum offered him; &lt;but on the officers appointed by His Highness to receive charge of the fort appearing, they were refused admittance. The Sultan's son, Muhammad, having expressed a desire at this time to be relieved of his governship at Sohar, Seyyid Hamad-bin Nasir was appointed to relieve him, and Seyyid Muhammad returned to Muscat on the 6th December.18 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL On tlie 10th December, the Political Agent proceeded to Ras Fartak in Her Majesty's ship Dragon to present rewards to the Sultan of Kisheen and the Chiefs of Nishtoon and Tibboot for their services in succouring the shipwrecked crew of the S. S. Any the previous year. In the same month the new Sheikh of Kas-el-Had was murdered at the instigation of the former Sheikh, and the Dar-el-Salaam was despatched with a small force to punish the offenders and restore order. In January, Seyyid Abdool Azeez wrote to the Political Agent from Semed, saying that His Highness Seyyid Toorkee had made certain proposals to him, and he desired the mediation of the Political Agent in the matter. A correspondence accordingly ensued. In February, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was laid up with an attack of fever and was attended by Surgeon-Major Jayakar. Some disturbances occurred at this time in the vicinity of Sohar between the Beni Ali and Mokabil tribes, and the mediation of the new Wali of Sohar, Seyyid Hamad, was sought by both parties. On the 3rd March, the Political Agent and the Wazir Seyyid Saeed proceeded to Gwadur in Her Majesty's ship Ranger to join a Court of Enquiry assembled there to investigate claims existing between Arab subjects and the Rinds, subjects of His Highness the Khan of Kalat. The inquiry occupied about three weeks, and the Political Agent returned to Muscat on the 25th March in Her Majesty's ship Ranger. On the 30th March a hurricane struck the Batineh coast between Seeb and Mesnaah and extended inland as far as Rostak, destroying many thousands of date trees and causing a loss of several lives. Heavy rain fell simultaneously all over Oman, causing immense damage to houses, crops, and trees. Slave Trade. —During the year 1884, owing probably to the removal of Her Majesty's ship London at Zanzibar, there was a general revival of the East African slave trade, and a large number of slaves were imported into the Gulf. On the 14th October, Her Majesty's ship Philomel \)XOVLgh.i into the Vice-Admiralty Court for adjudication a slave dow and 154 slaves she had captured near Ras-el-Had, and on her way to Aden shortly after she seized another dow with 51 slaves near Maseera island. Her Majesty's ship Br agon also brought into the Muscat Court 22 slaves she had recovered on the pirate coast. All these slaves were con demned to Her Majesty. S. B. MILES, Lieut.-Colonel,. H. B. M.'s Political Agent and Consul, Muscat.EESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 19 ''s id Qs APPENDIX A TO PART 11. VISIT OF POLITICAL AGENT, MUSCAT, TO EAS FARTAK. On the 16tli August 1883, the S. S. Airy, laden with wheat and bound for Port Said from Bombay, ran aground at Ras Nishton near Cape Fartak and became a total wreck. The crew, however, got safely ashore in the boats and were hospitably received and entertained at by the Mahras, who forwarded them shortly after in a bugla hired for the purpose to Muscat. The Government of India, on receiving a report of the circumstances, sanctioned the pre sentation of rewards, to the value of Rs. 500, to the Sultan of Kesheen and the Chiefs of Nish- as ton and Sihoot for the kind treatment and hospitality shown by them to the shipwrecked seamen, and the Political Agent was instructed to convey these presents personally and dis- ll| tribute them. lit The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, having arranged with Captain Anson for a passage in Her Majesty^s ship Dragon, the Political Agent left Muscat on the 10th December 1884, g and.proceeded first to Kesheen, where he arrived on the 15 th December. us On landing, the Political Agent accompanied by Captain Anson, had an interview with it. Sultan Abdulla, and after thanking him on behalf of the Government of India for his friendly lie action in affording protection to the crew of the S. S, Airy and arranging for their trans mission to Muscat, the Political Agent presented him with the gifts that had been prepared 1( j for his acceptance. of * „ Sultan Abdulla said that directly he heard of the wreck he had sent orders by his nephew, to Abdulla-bin-Muhammad, to Dhaboot for the crew to be properly cared for and to be conveyed to Muscat as soon as a bugla could be procured, and he was glad that his action had merited j g the approbation and notice of Government. a The Sultan stated at the interview that the whole Mahra tribe were^his subjects, and ip that his rule extended along the coast from Mesenaat to Ras Tharbat Ali. He promised 55 that shipwrecked crews of any nationality should always find protection and hospitality from !r his people within his territories. ie From Kesheen the Dragon proceeded to' Sihoot, where a visit was paid to Sultan Saad- bin-salim, who was in charge of the town during the absence of the Governor, Sultan Muhammad-bin-Omar. The latter is the son of the last Sultan of Kesheen, Omar-bin-Towari, who was visited by Captain S. B. Haines and was the rightful successor, but he was too young at the time of his father's death to assume power, and it passed on to his cousin Abdullah, the present Sultan. Sihoot is a long straggling town, larger than Kesheen, and more busy and thriving. It has 250 houses and about 2,000 inhabitants, a very large proportion of whom are negroes. The exports are frankincense, salt-fish, barley, sardine oil, and shark fins ; and the imports in cloth, &amp;c., are considerable, as Sihoot is the main dep6t for the supply of the populous Wady Maseelah. There are four banian traders from Cutch here, who keep shops and appear to be doing well. * Changing course at Sihoot, the Dragon steamed back to Ras Fartak, near the extreme point of which there is a fishing village named Khesheyt, a place frequented by Zanzi bar slavers for landing cargoes intended for the Hadhramant market. The Governor or Makaddam of Khesheyt and of Wady, a town 5 miles inland, is Ali, a nephew of old Sheikh J Eesa mentioned by Haines. After visiting Khesheyt, the Political Agent proceeded to Nishton. The ancient Greek writers named this promontory Syagros, having apparently confounded it with Ras Sankireh, another large headland further to the east. The Mahras name it Farteyk. It is the most striking and, after Ras Sajar, the largest promontory on the southern coast of Arabia, and forms a very remarkable natural feature. On the western side the rise is somewhat gradual, the range behind the maritime plain of Kesheen coming to a sudden termination at this point. On the eastern side the land turns abruptly to the north, the cliff rising sheer from the sea and presenting a perpendicular escarpment 2,000 feel in height and 6 miles in extent. But though apparently a smooth precipice, it is in fact a series of narrow horizontal terraces or ledges corresponding with the strata and indented with numerous caves inhabited by Mahras, who gain a precarious livelihood by fishing. Descending to the lowerwtmmmmmammmmm 20 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL shelves, they rig out poles by means of which they fish for sharks ; but it is a dangerous occupa tion, and several are said to perish annually by falling-off into the sea below. At night the fires lighted in the caves by the natives give the promontory a singular appearance, and it is the only indication of the face of the cliff being inhabited, as the terraces and caves are invisible from the sea during the day-time. At Nishton, where the Dragon next anchored, one of the headmen was found to be •Salim-bin-Barukeyn, the Mahra who had succoured the Knight of the Bath's crew in June 1883 near Has Sankireh. The old man expressed himself as being grateful for the liberal treatment he had received from the owners of that vessel and the attention shown him in Bombay, and observed that from being a poor fisherman he had become a merchant and a headman of his village. The fame of Salim-bin-Barukeyn's good fortune has spread ever\^ where along the coast, and has had an excellent effect; it is believed that the Arabs will be more inclined in future, after observing the liberality shown in these two instances^ to succour any Europeans who may happen to be wrecked on the shores of Southern Arabia. The Airy appears to have struck on a bank or reef off the point of Nishton Bay in about two fathoms, and to have subsequently rolled off into deeper water; the crew, having suffered from drinking the brackish water at Nishton, were carried on by the Arabs after a few days to Dhaboot, 9 miles further to the north, where they remained until they embarked in the bugla for Muscat. The Makaddam of Dhaboot, Sheikh Awadth, is a fine-looking old man, and seemed much gratified at the recognition by Government of his kindness to the sailors. Two of the headmen of Nishton, Sheikhs Muhammad and Moosa, who happened to be here, received their presents at the same time as Sheikh Awadth. A few miles further up the Bay of El Kamar is Gheither, a small village of 30 houses, but where a good deal of trade is done, as it is the terminus and depot of an important road leading to the interior of Hadhramant. From Gheiter to Tereem passing through Ainat is counted fifteen days' journey, and the chief halting-place is Minar, about 60 miles from the sea. The road is level all the way. Damkot, the next place visited by the Dragon, is a small Mahra town of about 100 houses built at the foot of a ravine at the bottom of this bay. There are about 300 inhabit ants, and there is some little trade, but the people seemed very poor; they have no dates or corn, and possess only a few camels, goats, and cattle. The exports are frankincense, ghi, and sardine oil. The Makaddam, a decrepit old man, said he remembered the boats of the Palinurus being Engaged in surveying the coast half a century ago. and had seen no ship here since then None of the people had ever seen a steamer before, and they had in fact shown evident signs of alarm at the Dragon's approach, some clustering together, and others scampering away up the hills at the back; but they were soon reassured. The ravine or gorge which is named Showeyta divides the town into two parts and forms below a long lagoon or creek, the upper part of which is sweet, becoming salt as it nears the sea. The ancient burial-ground lies between the town and the sea; it is very extensive and believed to be pre-Islamitic. The graves are nearly circular and 10 or 12 feet in diameter. Passing Has Sajar, which marks Ahe southern limit of the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, the Dragon arrived at Sallala and anchored off there on the 19th December. The district of Dhofar, according to some, includes the whole tract lying between Has Resoot and Has Noos, consisting of a maritime plain 85 miles long, enclosed by the lofty range of Jebel Samhan, which touches the sea at these points. But the application of the name is more usually restricted to the rich alluvial plain between Eesoot and Thakah. This plain, which is of half- moon shape, is 80 miles in length, with an extreme breadth of about 14, and is formed by the curvature of the hill range ; the coast-lines subtending this arc lying due east and west and having a sharp turn or bay at Resoot and Merbat, which form sheltered harbours for vessels in the south-west and north-east monsoons respectively. It is one of the most fertile and favoured districts on the southern coast of Arabia, and its chequered history shows that it has ever been a coveted possession. Extensive ruins of towns and forts scattered over its surface are an attestation of a former populousness and importance that have long since passed away. Dhofar contains at present five separate towns, all of them near the sea—Okad, Sallala, El Hafah, El Dahareez, and Thakah. The Governor and his garrison reside at Sallala. Numer ous wadies or water-courses intersect the plain, some of which are well wooded and grassy while others form small fresh-water lakes. The range about Merbat rises to an elevation of 3,000 or 4,000 feet, and is thickly wooded to the summit with tamarind and acacia, frankin cense and bdellium, dragon's-blood and other gum-resinous trees, and affords pasturage to herdsEESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 21 of cattle and camels, and flocks of sheep and goats. But the western portion of the range behind Dhofar is neither so high nor so well clothed with vegetation, the upper part being almost bare of trees. The soil of the plain is light and rich, and excellent water is found every where at a few feet from the surface. Cotton, jowari, bajri, pulse, lucerne, and cocoanuts are grown, but to a limited extent only. The trade of Dhofar is chiefly in the hands of Khoja merchants, who are agents for houses in Bombay and Moculla. The imports are rice, grain, dates, sugar, cotton cloth, and oil, the cloth being mostly indigo-dyed stuffs from Bombay, and may amount to $50,000 annually. The exports are frankincense, ghee, hides and skins, wax, &amp;c., brought down from the hills by the Gara Bedouins, besides cotton, sardine oil, and shark- fins, &amp;c. The Samhan hills are known to be rich in balsamic, rubber-producing, and other useful trees, but they have never been properly explored. The rubber tree grows to the height of 15 or 20 feet; it is called Isbak by the Arabs and Tishkot by the Garas. Specimens of the product have been sent to Muscat, but it has not yet become an article of trade. The inhabitants of the plains of Dhofar are mostly Katherees. This Hadhramant tribe, under Sultan Bedr Ba Towarek, invaded and overran Dhofar about 300 years ago and made El Dahareez their capital. They were in turn dispossessed by others, but subsequently regained supremacy j they still form the bulk of the inhabitants and number altogether about 1,500. The total population of the plain may be 2,000. The headmen of the towns and the Kazis all came to Sallala to visit the Political Agent; they are on good terms with the Governor, and expressed themselves as being well satisfied with the rule of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. The Garas are an extremely interesting and peculiar race, and are but little known. They are allied to the great Mahra tribe of whose language they speak a dialect. They are taller than, and of a different physique and physiognomy from, all the Arab-speaking tribes of Yemen and Oman, and, though they claim to be Hymyarites, have probably a separate origin. The area occupied by the Garas is a very circumscribed one, extending only from Rakeyoot, a village 12 miles west of Has Sajar to Hasek, and not reaching inland more than 40 miles from the sea. In habits they are pure Bedouins, but are not nomadic; they may rather be styled Troglodytes, and their cave-haunting propensity is one of their chief singu larities. The hills appear to be honeycombed with these caves, some of which are of prodi gious dimensions, and afford space and accommodation for a whole family with its possessions in cattle and goats. A cave near the sea explored in the preceding year was 100 feet broad, 60 feet deep, and 8 feet high, and was double-storeyed, a second smaller chamber existing over the roof of the larger. This cave was entirely natural, and was a comparatively small one. The sub-tribes of the Gara are 10 in number and are thus distributed: At Rakyoofc Beyt Shemasa and Beyt Elsa; at Dhofar—Beyt Saeed, Beni Kattan, Beyt Jesjyon, Beyt Tebbook Beyt Keshoop, Beyt Jahbool, and Beyt Maashinee; at Merbat—Beyt Makheir. The streno-th of the whole Gara tribe does not probably exceed 3,000 souls. Among the ruins with which the plain is interspersed the most extensive and interesting are those on the shore between El Hafah and El Dahareez, covering a space 2 miles in length. These ruins, now known as El Baleyd, are believed by Sprenger to be the remains of the ancient Mansoora, but this name is unmentioned now in local tradition. The citadel, towers and mosques are still standing in part, and the town wall and ditch can be distinctly traced! They have been measured and fully described by Carter. According to local tradition this city was founded by the Mainjooi or Nejui dynasty, which rose to the height of its power in the fifth century of the Hijra. The existence of this dynasty has been discredited by European orientalists, but without reason. The tombs of the Sultans near El Robat, a few of them exquisitely worked and inscribed by Persian or Sanaa artists, have been examined and copied. The prosperity of Mansoora was doubtless owing in great measure to the existence of a copious stream of perfectly sweet water which encircled the town on three sides. This stream, which is 4 or 5 fathoms deep, formerly communicated with the sea and formed a most excellent creek or harbour for dows and boats. It is now closed by a sand-bar, but this only requires to be removed to render the port again available for native vessels. About half a mile from the ruins of El Baleyd lies the principal Moslem shrine at Dhofar, the tomb of the Zamorin, known as Abdulla-el-Samiry. He was the Raja of Cranga- nore in Malabar and was converted to Islam in the beginning of the third century of the Hijra, circa 210. Being compelled to leave his kingdom, he embarked in an Arab dow and came to Dhofar, where he died four or five years afterwards in the odour of sanctity. He is reputed to have first brought rain to Dhofar by his prayers, and his tomb is still visited by numbers to beseech his intercession in time of drought. The tomb is enclosed by an unroofed wall of mud 322 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL and stone 25 feet by 10; it is 18 feet long bj 4 broad, and lies north by south, with a broken headstone of black basalt. The inscription is imperfect and there is no date. The recent history of Dhofar may be said to commence from the seizure of power by the famous pirate Muhammad Akil, who established order and ruled with a strong- hand until his murder by the Garas in 1829. On hearing of his death, His Highness Seyyid Saeed, the Imam of Muscat, immediately sent a force and took possession of the place, although Muhammad's brother, Abdul Rahman, who was then a merchant in Bombay, desired and intrigued to obtain the government. Seyyid Saeed, however, was at that time engaged in his unlucky enterprises against Siwi and Membasa in East Africa, and could ill spare the troops required for garrison ing Dhofar. They were consequently withdrawn soon after, and the district fell into a state of anarchy, from which it did not emerge until the arrival of Seyyid Fadhl, the Moplah. In the year 1870 the Wali at Baghdad, under orders from the Porte, which at that time had designs on Southern Arabia, despatched a quasi-scientific expedition along this coast, and a liberal distri bution of presents and flags was made to the various chiefs. Dhofar was one of the chief points visited by the steamer, and Turkish flags were landed here, but this tentative move was not followed up by Turkey. Seyyid Fadhl endeavoured to emulate the career of Mahammad Akil, but though he had the support of Mecca in his enterprise, he lacked the capacity for rule; and his follower^, who seem to have been a band of ruffians, roused the people against them by their villainy and oppression. The general confusion became so great at last that the Katheerees and Garas were compelled to unite and expel him. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was then invited by the natives to occupy the country, and they have since remained contented and fairly prosperous under his rule. At the time of the Political Agent's visits in Her Majesty's ship Philomel in Novem ber 1883, the Gara Bedouins were not on good terms with the Governor owing to a dis pute about taxes, and a collision had occurred shortly before between the garrison and Sheikh Fankhor-el-Maashinee. At this visit the Political Agent found that the Garas had since submitted, and that friendly relations had been re-established. From Sallala the Political Agent visited El Dahareez and Thakah, and from the latter place the Dragon steamed on to Merbat. Merbat is a town of about 300 inhabitants, situated in a little bay which forms an excellent and secure anchorage during the north-east monsoon, at the western extremity of a narrow plain 25 miles long by 7 broad, extending under the Samhan range. There are two forts—one in ruins, constructed by Muhammad Akil in 1806 ; and a new one built by the order of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee four years ago, which has a garrison of 20 men. About half a mile from the town lies the tomb of Sheikh Mahammad Ali, who died in 556 A.H., now a famous shrine. The principal export of vegetable origin from Southern Arabia is olibanum or frankincense, the country producing which, the libanophorus region of the ancients, extends from the WadyMeyfa and the Himyar range in longitude 47 0 3a'E. to Hasek in longitude 55° 20' E., an area embracing the whole of Hadhramant and part of Oman. Westward of Eas Fartak the tree is found but sparingly, and the collection of the gum is neglected by the Arabs, the work being left to a great extent in the hands of Somalis, who come across for the purpose and pay for the privilege. The trees are most abundant on the limestone surpmits of Jebel Samhan, where the gum is gathered in May and December by the Garas, who call it Shlhat. The termination of the limit of the tree at Hasek and Wady Rak6t is very afcrapt, *nd it is not found further to the east. The average annual export of the gum from Dhofar is about 30 tons, and the local value $60 per ton. Two young trees were brought to Muscat in Her Majesty's ship Dragon and are now thriving. From Merbat the Dragon proceeded to Hasek on the 23rd. The old town here, now completely in ruins, is situated on the left bank of the Wady, where it was protected by two circular towers. The more recent inhabitants appear to have been of the Ba Malah tribe, who were attacked by the Kowasim or Beni Yas about three quarters of a century ago, and the women and children carried off into slavery. There is now no trade whatever at Hasek, and Arab craft seldom or never call here, Hellaniyeh, the largest and only inhabited island of the Kuria Muria group, was next visited. The inhabitants of this island, 34 in number, subsist on fish and goats' milk, with a little rice and dates which they procure from passing dows by selling dried fish. Their habitations are of the most wretched and primitive description. Generally round or oval, 6 feet in diameter, and the height of a walking-stick, they are built of loose stones with a scanty rcofing of mats laid over sticks and fish bones. Miserable as is their condition, their posseesionseesidency and muscat political agency foe 1884-85. 23 ten are ^ nevertheless, coveted by others, and they are sometimes ill-treated and robbed by the Kowasim and Beni Yar Arabs. He Hellaniyeh was occupied as a station in 1861 for the Red Sea and Karachi lelegraph, Hs but was abandoned on the failure of that cable in 186£. The guano, for the sake of which the am cession of these islands was obtained in 1854, has long since been removed, and vessels now rarely touch here. The last place visited by the Dragon was Ras Sharbedat. This part of the coast is inhabited by the Jenebeh tribe, who wander here during the cold weather with their flocks and on. herds for convenience of pasturage, and return to Jaalan in the summer. There are three 3 of fresh-water lakes in this neighbourhood. The Political Agent returned to Muscat on the 28th December 1884. ion tri.

The Portuguese in Eastern Arabia, by Lieutenant-Colonel 8. B. Miles. It was very early after the Portuguese had commenced their career of conquest in the East upon the discovery of the Cape route to India, that they turned their attention to the Persian Gulf. When Albuquerque returned from his first voyage to India in 1504, he advocated a policy of conquest and aggression, and appears to have been the originator of that scheme of extensive annexation and occupation of the Indian seaboard which the King, Dom Manoel was eventually induced to adopt, and which Albuquerque himself was selected to carry out' This scheme was not adopted without much opposition from Saldanha and others, who propounded a more cautious plan for the maintenance of the new commerce. The future policy of the nation m the East was indeed hotly discussed at Lisbon, and the King's decision was for a long time doubtful. There was one point, however, on which all parties were agreed, and that was the im portance of obstructing the old lines of commerce by the Arabian and Persian Gulfs and of securing the entire monopoly of the trade by diverting it to the new route; and to this end immediate and determined efforts were resolved on. In the year 1306 three fleets were despatched from Lisbon to the East, one of which consisted of sixteen vessels nnder Tristan da Cunha with Alfotso d'Albnquerqne as second m command. The instructions given to do Cunha were to proceed to' the Island of Soeotra and there construct a fort, which, while protecting the Christians supposed to inhabit that island, should also serve as a dep6t for the use of the fleets destined to oppose the Egvpto- Venetian confederacy and to blockade the Red Sea. On the completion of the fort, da Cunha was to proceed to India with his share of the fleet leaving Albuquerque with a small squadron to attack Jeddah and Aden, and to obstruct the Moorish trade. ■ 1 Albuquerque had, no doubt, at once perceived the uselessness of Socotra for the purpose intended and was well aware that his flotilla was too small for him to attempt capture of Aden. As will be seen presently, therefore, he thought fit, after the departure of Tristan da Cunha, to deviate somewhat from his instructions, and sailed away to the north-east intent upon the capture of Hormuz, then the chief emporium of commerce in the Persian Gulf.' ■ 1 P dld ' ot re&lt; l u i r e the genius of an Albuquerque to perceive that the acquisition of this island would, by giving him the entire command of the Persian Gulf route, be of greater Sab. the temporary blockade of the Eed Sea and the bombardment of , .

By reason of their isolated and remote position, the ideas of the Arabs about foreigners are extremely vague and erroneous, and owing partly to their habit of ^ a confounding all Europeans under the appellation of Nasara or Christians, and partly to their 116 of being best acquainted of late years with the English, it has happened that the doings of the N, Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries are by the vulgar often ascribed to us. The dread inspired by the wars of Albuquerque and his successor was preserved by oral ^ tradition, and we may be sure that these traditions lost nothing by the additions and em bellishments which time provides, and which hate and fear never fail to suggest. isfdt The undisputed supremacy of the Arabs at sea in the Indian Ocean which existed at the commencement of the sixteenth century fell at once from their grasp on the appearance of the Portuguese, and was never subsequently regained by them. Let us hope it has passed away J ^ £ or ever, for the revival of Arab power would be merely another name for piracy, pillage, and the slave trade. Tristan da Cunha sailed from Lisbon on the 6th of March 1506, and after many adven ed tures and some losses anchored safely at Soko, the port of Socotra, in the middle of the year ewj following, having on the way been joined by the Flor de la Mary commanded by Captain )cotra j oa 5 da Nova, who had proceeded to India with a former fleet, and who afterwards proved such a thorn in the side of Albuquerque at Hormuz. ^ At Soko da Cunha found a different reception awaiting him from what he had expected. The island was in possession of Sultan Ibrahim, son of the Sultan of Kisheen, who resolutely )ftte rejected the Admiral's demand for surrender. The fort was accordingly besieged by the Portu- stnict guese, and in spite of a valiant resistance, assaulted and carried, the Mahra garrison being put to the sword. The fort was then rebuilt and named St. Thomas, and Alfonso deNoronha was appointed to the command. It was the end of July 1507 before affairs were finally arranged lreo l at Socotra, and the time then arrived for da Cunha and Albuquerque to part company and to ■ i[u pursue the course of action prescribed for each respectively by the King. nteil{ The squadron allotted to Albuquerque by the chief captain consisted of— (1) The Cirne, the flagship of Albuquerque. (2) The Ruy Grande: Captain Francisco de Tavora. ^ (3) The Flor de la Mar : Captain Joao da Nova. ' eatei (4) The Bey Fegneno : Captain Manoel Telles Barretto. ^ (5) The Sam Jorge Transport; Captain A. Lopes da Costa. (6) The Bspirito Santo: Captain A. do Campo. ) tlie Having completed his arrangements, Tristan da Cunha sailed away for India on the 1st August, nised leaving Albuquerque free to decide on and carry out his plan of operations against Moorish 3 Ills commerce. Albuquerque had doubtless already fully determined on his course of action with regard to Hormuz; but he seems to have thought it prudent to call a council of war and to discuss the matter with his captains. At this council it was resolved that as provisions were running short and the south-west monsoon still prevailed, the expedition against Jeddah ^ should be abandoned in favour of a short cruise to pick up Moorish vessels coming from the ^ Red Sea, after which the fleet should proceed to Muscat, where they could decide what to do ower next - On the 10th August, accordingly, the little fleet set sail from Soko for the Arabian coast, • intending to commence the cruise at the Kooria-Mooria islands. These islands, however, were passed without being sighted by any of the ships, and Albuquerque then determined to give up the cruise altogether, as he feared to run out of supplies, and he had only agreed to the plan in ig, deference to the opinion of his captains. rich Sailing on to the north-east, the fleet appears to have anchored for the first time in ^ive Oman waters near the island of Maseera, from whence, on the following day, they proceeded on .jyal until they had weathered Ras-el-Had, inside of which Albuquerqne anchored in smooth water a ta and commenced hostilities by firing all the Arab vessels he found lying in Khor Hejareh, some 30 or 4?0 in number. The next place, Khor Jerameh, was explored in the boats by the master of the transport, who sounded seven fathoms in the lagoon. Here four more vessels were given to the flames.26 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Passing Soor, which is described as a small fishing village, the fleet, sailing close and followed by a large concourse of people along the shore, next arrived at the city of Kilhata where Albuquerque ordered his ships to come to an anchor with as much noise and display as could be made. This was the first appearance of Europeans in ships in the Gulf of Oman since the days of Alexander, eighteen centuries before. And from the ready submission of the people of Kilhat, the appearance of the fleet seems to have been viewed with no little terror and dismay, the Persians here having doubtless heard of the proceedings of the Portuguese on the Indian coast and of their warlike character and superiority. At the time of these events the Arab Prince in power in Oman was the Imam Muham- mad-bin-Ismail-el-Ismaili, who was elected in A.H. 906 (A.D. 1500) and died in A.H. 942 (A.D, 1535). His capital was el Rostak, where he usually resided. He held sway, however, only over the interior portion of the country, the coast line being still, as it had been since A.D. 1270, subject to the Persian King of Hormuz, whose chief Governor was at Kilhat. No communication was held the first day with the city, but on the following morning a boat was sent on shore with two officers and an interpreter, who were civilly received, and were informed that the town belonged to the kingdom of Hormuz, and that anything required for the fleet would be willingly supplied. On the next day, further communications took place between the Governor and Albuquerque, to whom a present of fruit, &amp;c., was sent on board by the former. The present, however, was not accepted by Albuquerque, who required the unconditional submission of the town and the transfer of allegiance to the King of Portugal. The Governor being unprepared for resistance resolved to temporise, and humbly depre cating the opening of hostilities and the destruction of the town, besought Albuquerque to pro ceed to Hormuz and make terms with the King, promising that whether peace or war might result there, Kilhat would nevertheless yield subjection to the King of Portugal. This evasive reply was fully understood by Albuquerque; but as he was in urgent need of provisions he took the advice of his officers and accepted the position until a more convenient opportunity. Before leaving, Albuquerque gave a written guarantee of safety from attack by other Portuguese ships in the name of the King Dom Manoel to the Governor, but he did not scruple to make prize of an Aden dow of 200 tons lying in the harbour which was held to ransom. On Sunday, the 22Qd August, Albuquerque weighed from Kilhat and sailed for Teywee, which he had supposed to be a large port, but finding it merely a watering place he passed on to Kooriyah, where he anchored for the night. The next day no boat came off from the shore, and it was seen that the inhabitants had prepared for resistance. Albuquerque accordingly reconnoitred the place in his boat and arranged his plan of attack for the following morning. It was ascertained that the Arabs had two batteries, on one of which they had mounted four mortars, and the attack was consequently concentrated on these points. The struggle was long and severe, but the natives were ultimately driven out of their defences and pursued half a league by the Portuguese, who slaughtered indiscriminately all the men, women, and children they could reach. Some prisoners taken in the town had their ears and noses lopped off to signalise the victory, and Kooriyah was plundered and set on fir 3. Twenty-five firelocks, besides spears, bows and arrows, &amp;c., were captured, and 38 vessels, large and small, lying in the port, were burnt. Muscat, the next scene of destruction, was reached in four days after leaving Kooriyah, and was found to be a very formidable and well-fortified place. It is also described as being the principal port on that coast. The inhabitants had heard of the fate of Kooriyah, and were disinclined to expose their city to a similar catastrophe; they therefore did not wait for a summons to surrender, but immediately on the arrival of the fleet sent off two of their chief men to Albuquerque, offering submission to the King of Portugal, and promising to agree to any terms that might be demanded. Albuquerque, finding they were unprovided with written power to treat from the Governor, sent them on shore again, desiring them to return on board the following day. In the mean time he sounded the harbour and reconnoitred the fortifications. It was found that the Arabs had constructed a rampart of wood and earth from hill to hill above the beach in front of the town and had mounted thereon a number of mortars. On the two Sheikhs visiting Albu querque next day, they were informed that they were required to pay an annual tribute and furnish his fleet with supplies and water during the operations against Hormuz. Compliance with the requisition for provisions was made at once j but during the night the inhabitants wereRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 27 reinforced by a powerful Sheikh from the interior, and felt strong enough to withdraw their submission and defy the Portuguese. Albuquerque therefore resolved on reducing the town without delay, and having ordered his ships to take up positions, commenced to bombard the stockade and batteries. The fire of the guns, however, had little effect, owing probably to the distance of the ships, and Albuquerque thought it best to call a council of war to decide on what was- to be done. The captains, who had already begun to get restive under the iron rule of their commander, seeing that Albuquerque had made up his mind as to the course he would pursue, and dreading perhaps the strength of the place, declined to discuss the plan of operations, or express an opinion, and informed him simply that they were ready to obey his orders. Being now free to act, Albuquerque no longer hesitated, and gave directions for an assault on the morrow. He divided his force into two, giving command of the right division against the stockade to Captains deTavora and daCosta, while he himself took charge of the left. The landing was effected under the fortifications; and although an obstinate defence was made, the walls were stormed and carried at both points. A junction was then effected in the streets between the two attacking parties, according to previous arrangement, and the enemy was then gradually driven through and out of the town. The Sheikh, whose arrival had caused such rejoicing and had inspired the people to oppose their invaders, escaped after a long pursuit, but the slaughter of the Arabs was very great, and included the Persian Governor of the town and a number of women and children. In the slaughter of the women, the two captains who subsequently mutinied and deserted their leader, viz,, Antao doCampo and Joao daNova, seem to have particularly distinguished themselves ; but Albuquerque^s conduct is equally deserving of reprobation, for after the rout of the Arabs was complete and the scattered Portuguese soldiers were collected in the town, he proceeded to massacre most of the remaining inhabitants, men, women, and children, without distinction. After guarding against surprise, the town was occupied and pillaged, and the men were allowed to retain their loot and remove it on board, as some compensation for the hardships they had undergone. Among the spoil were thirty guns, bows and arrows, lances and other weapons used by the Arabs. Albuquerque spent eight days here, and took the opportunity to refit his fleet and victual it with provisions and water. Having done this he was preparing to evacuate the town and set it on fire, when the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on the heights above, guessing his intention, despatched an Arab with a flag of truce to beseech him to be content with having slain the women and children, and to spare the town and ships from the flames. Albuquerque replied to the envoy that he regretted the destruction of the city, but that the inhabitants had broken faith with him, and he could not consequently admit their claim to forbearance. He consented, however, to hold the city to ransom, which he fixed at 10,000 Ashrafis in gold, to be paid the next day at noon. This amount the Arabs were unable or unwilling to pay by the time appointed, and the town was therefore destroyed by fire, together with 34 dows and many fishing boats. The mosque, described as a very large and beautiful edifice constructed of wood elaborately carved, also fell a prey to the flames; and it is related that three Portuguese engaged in hacking at the carved wooden pillars were crushed and buried by the sudden collapse of the building: all believed they had perished; but as they emerged unhurt, the commander at once returned thanks to the Holy Virgin for her miraculous interposition in their behalf during their pious labour. Albuquerque gives the following curious description of Muscat at that time :— 'Muscat is a large and very populous town flanked on both sides with high mountains, and the front is close to the water's edge; behind, towards the interior, there is a plain as Jarge as the square of Lisbon, all covered with salt-pans. Not that the tide reaches there, bat the springs are salt and salt forms there. Hard by are many pools of fresh water of which the inhabitants make use, and there are orchards, gardens, and palm groves with wells for watering them by means of swipes and other engines. The harbour is small, shaped like a horse- shoe, and sheltered from every wind. It is the principal entrepot of the kingdom of Hormuz, into which all the ships that navigate these parts must of necessity enter to avoid the opposite coast, which contains many shallows. It 'is an ancient mart for the shipment of horses and dates. It is a very fine town with many good houses, and supplied from the interior with much wheat, millet, barley, and dates for lading as many vessels as come for them. This city of Muscat forms part of the kingdom of Hormuz, and the interior belongs to a king called the Benjaber, who had two brothers. Between these brothers was divided the country which extends as far as Aden. On the north it is washed by the Persian Sea, and from thence it stretches as far as the vicinity of Mecca. The Arabs call this country the Island of Arabia, because the Persian Sea turns inwards, opposite to the Eed Sea, in such a manner that the country is circular and is almost surrounded by water, that is, by the Red and Persian Seas. It is a very small country, and is called on that account the Island of Arabia. It had formerly been all reigned over by a King, called the Benjaber, and this man had three sons, to whom, at his death, he left the land to be divided among them, and the eldest afterwards retained the name of Henjaber as the father had done. The other two acknowledged him as their lord. This Benjaber has dominions over Fartak, Dhofar, Kilhat, and Muscat, and his boundary reaches to the land of the Sheikh of Aden ; the other two dwell on the coast of the Persian Sea, and one of them had taken from the King of Hormuz the Island of Bahrein, where there is a pearl28 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEES IAN GULF POLITICAL fishery, about five days' voyage from the Island of Hormuz, and had also taken Kateef, an island held originally by the King of Hormuz on the Arabian coast. ' In this country of Benjaber there are many horses which the farmers breed for sale ; there is also greaf abundance of wheat, millet, and barley, and great flocks and herds, and there are many who hunt with falcons about the size of our goshawks and take by their aid gazelles, smaller than ours, training very swift hounds to assist the falcons in catching the prey.' Previous to the departure of the fleet from Muscat, the first open rupture took place between the chief Captain and Captain Joao daNova of the Flor de la Mar, Albuquerque had information that daNova intended to desert him here and slip away to India, and he therefore summoned him to his ship, and convened a council. DaNova did not deny the charge; and the officers having supported Albuquerque, daNova submitted and was ordered to continue with the fleet under severe penalty. Passing the Deymanieth islands the fleet anchored in due course off Sohar. A message was immediately despatched by the Governor to Albuquerque informing him that the city belonged to the King of Hormuz, and intimating that if he landed he would meet with a differ ent reception from what the other towns on the coast had given him; at the same time the messenger pointed to the troops on shore, where as much display and parade were being made as possible. Albuquerque replied shortly that the Governor had better re-consider his deter mination and own allegiance to Portugal, otherwise the fortress would assuredly be taken from him in the morning. The sight of the imposing force of infantry and cavalry on shore had a pacific effect on the other captains in the fleet, but Albuquerque knew his strength better, and, as soon as the messenger had gone, commenced his preparations for the attack. All was ready by noon the next day, and the boats were about to shove off, when a deputation from the town arrived and stated that the Governor had just dismissed a force of 7,000 men which had been sent by the Benjaber to his aid, and that as the King of Hormuz had not sent the succours he had promised, the Governor was ready to submit to the King of Portugal, and to deliver up the fort. Albuquerque said he was glad that the Governor had changed his mind, and intimated that he would accept the submission of the town on condition of its paying a yearly tribute. The envoys, alarmed at the preparations they had seen on board, agreed to this, and having con^ eluded a convention, returned to the Governor. Due arrangements having been made, the Portu- guese standard was carried to the fort in state and hoisted on the highest tower under a salute. On seeing the strength of the place, Albuquerque was inclined at first to retain possession of it, as he would thereby gain complete command of the Oman coast, but on second thoughts he decided to entrust the fort to the Governor for the present, and accordingly placed him in charge, appointing the yearly tribute fixed for the town for the payment of the Arab garrison. A written acknowledgment of allegiance to the King of Portugal was then executed by the Governor, and a guarantee of protection was given by Albuquerque in return; and matters having thus been adjusted, Albuquerque weighed the next morning and steered his course for Khor Fakan. The inhabitants of this place had received news of the fleet's approach by a boat from Sohar, and made a great display of horse and foot on t he beach, hoping to deter the Portuguese from attack by mere bravado. This continued the whole of the first day; and as Albuquerque received no message or offer of submission from the Governor, he determined to attack early the following morning, and made his signal two hours after midnight. After clearing the beach bj the guns in the boats, the troops landed and marched up pursuing the Arabs, who hastily retired to the gates of the fort. As they entered pell-mell, some of the Portuguese, headed by Albuquerque's nephew Noronha, managed to press in with them, and being soon supported by Albuquerque himself, found themselves, after a long and stubborn fight, in possession of the town and fortress, which were occupied and guarded. One of the elders of the town, who was too old and infirm to escape, and had concealed himself in a cellar, was captured and brought before Albuquerque, to whom he gave important information respecting the kingdom of Hormuz. He also gave Albuquerque a Persian history of Alexander, and in consideration of this was honourably treated and released. Some days were spent in getting provisions and water on board, the prisoners being used as slaves in this work; and meanwhile the Arabs made repeated attempts to regain possession of the town, but without success. As the fleet had approached Khor Fakan, the Portuguese had observed several vessels sailing away in the direction of Cape Mussendom, and they now learned that these dows contained the Hindu traders from Cutch, escaping with their property : very little booty consequently was found in the town, much to the disappointment of the victors. Numerous captives, however, were taken, who appear to have been released with the customary mutilation of ears and noses.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-85. 29 Khor Fakan is described by Albuquerque as being situate at the foot of a very high mountain, and almost impregnable on the land side. It was a large town with many Baman merchants, and was a dependency of Hormuz. The climate was temperate and healthy, and there was extensive cultivation of wheat and millet, with oranges, limes, dates, plantains, and figs. The harbour was good, being protected by two small islets. Horses were extensively exported hence to India and the interior belonged to Benjaber like the other parts. Khor Fakan was the last scene of Albuquerque's exploits on the Oman coast, and he had as little compassion on this as on former places. The town was set on fire and destroyed* and the conquistador, elated by his victories, and confident in his strength, signalled to the fleet and made his way direct to Hormuz. The capture of Hormuz was the principal object of Albuquerque's expedition as before remarked, and his operations and exploits here were characterised by the same distinguished ability, valour, and success that had marked his previous career. Owing, however, to the disaffec tion of his officers and the desertion of two of his ships, he was compelled to retire before the finish had been put to his conquest by the completion of the fort which was to overawe the town. He sailed away to Soeotra, where his arrival was most opportune, for he found the garri son in great distress from famine and the enmity of the natives. He soon put affairs in order there ; and his fleet having been increased by two ships that had arrived from Portugal to join him, he weighed from Soko on the 15th of August 1508 to return to Hormuz, intending on the way to reduce the city of Kilhat in retaliation for the assistance rendered by it to the King of Hormuz, in violation of agreement, during the war. On anchoring off Kilhat, Albuquerque sent his nephew Noronha in a boat to reconnoitre. Near the shore Noronha met an Arab bringing presents from the Governor, on which he turned back and accompanied the man to the flag-ship, where Albuquerque questioned the Arab as to the Governor's name and the force at his disposal. Having elicited the required information, Albuquerque despatched Noronha to the shore again to see the Governor, Sherif-ul-Din, and if possible to entice him on board which Noronha endeavoured to do by representing Albuquerque as an officer who had just arrived from Portugal with reinforcements to support Albuquerque at Hormuz. Sherif-ul-Dm was polite, and offered the new commander a hospitable reception on shore, if it pleased him to land, but he was too wary to trust himself on board a Portuguese ship. On his nephew's return from his ineffective mission, Albuquerque made preparations to attack the town, which is situated on a declivity under a high and steep cliff. The struggle for the possession of the place did not last long. The Persians, terror-stricken by the vigorous onslaught of the Portuguese, were driven in confusion out of the town, and Sherif-ul-Din was obliged to retire to the heights behind the city, from whence he watched the proceedings of the in vaders. Albuquerque, having posted guards on the gates and ramparts against surprise, gave the place over to plunder, whereon the vigilant Sherif-ul-Dm, after three days, seeing the Portuguese dispersed intent on pillage, deemed it a fitting opportunity to attempt to regain the town. Fol lowed by 500 men, he accordingly made a descent from the hills, and tried to force one of the gates. At first the guard posted there was driven back, but having speedily rallied the men, closed with the Persians, and after a valiant fight, routed them before Albuquerque could come to their assistance. After sacking the town and transporting on board all the provisions and valuables he could collect, Albuquerque gave it to the flames, making a point of destroying the famous Jami Masjid, to the great grief of the inhabitants. Albuquerque's description of this mosque accords with that of Ibn Batula, who had visited the place about two hundred years before, and from these accounts the edifice appears to have been a very fine specimen of Persian architecture. It may be remarked here that no cut or squared stones are to be found at the present day among the ruins of Kilhat. The houses there, and doubtless this mosque also, were built of limestone and coral. The destruction of it, however, has been so complete that no ves tige of it now remains to point out the spot where it stood. Albuquerque here obtained important information from the Arab who had brought off the presents from the Governor Sherif-ul-Dm, and who had until now been detained on board the flag-ship, respecting the condition of affairs at Hormuz, and the man was dismissed with gifts. He then gave orders to burn the Arab shipping in the creek, and after consultation with his officers resolved to proceed at once with the expedition. The fleet accordingly sailed the follow ing day, and having watered at Teywee, where he anchored for two days, and which Albuquerque represents as a port with a river near running between lofty hills and forming on the shore a lake surrounded by palm trees, continued his voyage up the gulf towards Hormuz. The first act in the drama thus terminated in the destruction of Kilhat, and a lull succeeded the stormful visits of the conquistador, whose path along the Arab coast had been marked by30 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL a trail of blood and flame. For five years the Arabs appear to have been left unmolested by their new foes, and in the meantime they had leisure to rebuild their towns, and to watch, as they doubtless did, with interest the proceedings of their ruthless invaders at Hormuz and in India. In 1512, Diogo Fernandes deBega, who had been sent to demolish the fort at Socotra which had been found useless for.the purpose it was intended to serve, came to Hormuz and Muscat to receive the tribute agreed upon with the King. It had been the intention of Albuquerque, who had in the meantime become the second Viceroy of India, to return to the Persian Gulf this year with deBega, but circumstances prevented his doing so until two years later, when he sailed from Goa with a fleet of 14 sail of the line and 13 smaller vessels. On the 21st March 1515 he sighted land near Ras-el-Nad, and four days later arrived at Kooriyah. Here he found an armada from Hormuz on the look-out for pirates, and deciding not to molest it he moved on to Muscat, where he anchored for two days to take in provisions and water. The Persian Governor or Agent here at the time was Rais Hamed, a nephew of Rais Noor-ul-Din one of the oflacers of the King of Hormuz, and Albuquerque was much exercised at observing his tyrannical behaviour over the people. He appears, however, to have behaved civilly enough to the Portuguese, having doubtless a lively recollection of what had occurred seven year s before. Having completed the conquest of Hormuz, the Viceroy prepared to turn his face southwards, and appointed his relative, Pedro d^Albuquerque, commandant of the fort with a strong garrison to overawe the city. It was the last important act of his life, for he was very ill when he set sail, and as it turned out on his death-bed, and the 'terrible Albu querque, ' as he was called, died the day of his arrival off the bar of Goa, his end being hastened by the news he had received of his supersession and recall by the King. DeBarros gives a curious and detailed account of the revenue and expenditure of Hormuz at this time. He says that on the coast of Arabia the chief town was Kilhat, the Governor and Customs Master at which overruled those in the other towns in the principality. The reve nue collected and remitted by Kilhat to Hormuz was 19,200 Sheraflns, equal to 5,760 dollars, which was contributed in the following proportions: Kilhat paid 11,000 Ashrafis, Muscat 4,000, Sohar 1,500, Khor Fakan 1,500, Dibba 500, and Lima 700. The Julfar district, or Pirate coast, also paid 7,500, and in addition to the above the boats engaged in the pearl fishery, which were compelled to go to Hormuz to take out passes, contributed 1,500 Ashrafis. The Oman revenue thus came to 28,200 Ashrafis. The total revenue of Hormuz is said to have been 198,078 Ashrafis, or $59,423. The same writer also gives us a glimpse at the political state of Oman at this time, from- which we learn that the Imam Muhommad possessed undisputed spiritual and temporal power in all parts, and that the chief cities in Oman proper, which was the most populous district were Manh, Nezwa, and Behla, each of which was fortified and had its own ^^-independent King who ruled iu a sort of republic. These chieftains had formed a league to protect them selves against the Benjaber, a predatory tribe and the most powerful in Arabia, who used to raid Oman every year at the date season. The Imam had to buy them off from plundering his territories by an annual tribute. Intermediate between the above towns and the seaboard were other Sheikhdoms who were continually at feud with the Persian garrisons, a state of distraction which of course operated in favour of the Portuguese. Who these Benjaber were that appeared so formidable is an enigma that remains unsolved. After the subjection of Hormuz, three places on the Arab coast—Kilhah, Muscat, and Sohar,—became stations for the Portuguese factors and merchants who were appointed and controlled from Hormuz. They were sufficiently protected by the visits of the King's ships from India which touched at these places on their way to Hormuz and Bahrein, and as no vessel under a native flag was suffered to cross the ocean without a pass, they had practically the control of all seaborne commerce, and thus commanded the markets. But it does not appear that any garrisons were yet stationed on the Oman coast. In the year 1519 the first check to the Portuguese prestige in the gulf occurred at Kilhat, and was due, as such things usually are due to an unwise meddling in local politics. The King of Hormuz happening to be incensed against the Governor of Kilhat, Reis Shehab-ul-Dm, and being unable to get him into his power, be sought the aid of Dom Garcia deContinho, the Portuguese commandant. Dom Garcia accord ingly directed the Captain-Major or Naval Chief of the squadron, Duarte Mendes DeVascon- cellos, to arrest Shehab-ul-Dm and bring him to Hormuz. This order, however, Duarte MendesEESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 31 found himself unable to carry out, as Shehab-ul-Dm was too vigilant aud well guarded, until the arrival of Jorge D'Albuquerque, who, being on his way out from Lisbon with a fleet of ten ships, had received instructions at Mozambique from the Viceroy to meet him at Muscat, and who at this juncture put in at Kilhat. A stratagem devised by Duarte Mendes was agreed to by Albuquerque, and a small force having been landed in the town, the Governors house was attacked in the night. The plan, however, failed. The Portuguese were repulsed by the Persians and overpowered, and the house in which they took refuge was set on fire. After a severe struggle aud heavy loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners, they were rescued by a fresh party from the fleet. Shehab-ul-Dm remained uncaptured and triumphant. Shortly after, in the beginning of the following year, 1520, the Viceroy, Diago Lopes de Siqueira, anchored at Muscat, and after an enquiry censured and condemned the whole proceed ings, and put Duarte Mendes in irons. The Viceroy then proceeded on to Hormuz with a few galleys, leaving Albuquerque in charge of the major portion of the fleet at Muscat. Fifteen Portuguese, who had been taken prisoners and carried inland from Kilhat, were recovered by Albuquerque in wretched plight, but no attempt seems to have been made to avenge the disaster. In the next year, only seven years after the fall of Hormuz and the death of the great con quistador, a concerted insurrection took place at Hormuz and along the Arabian shores from Bahrein to Kilhat, and the garrisons were taken so completely by surprise that it was only by chance and by their own marvellous valour that their entire annihilation was not accomplished. The cause of this revolt, according to the Portuguese officers on the spot, was the dissatisfaction felt by the King at their interference in the arrangements of the Customs House and general supervision of the revenue, a measure lately introduced under orders from Lisbon. By this control a number of favourites and parasites lost their sinecures, and a good deal of wasteful expenditure and peculation was no doubt prevented. But the proximate and predominating cause was without question the greed, insolence, and oppression of the Portuguese officials, who made no scruple of taking advantage of their strength and of helping themselves as they pleased. The plan of the massacre was elaborately worked out and decided upon by the King and his ministers, and when all was ready, letters were despatched to the Persian Governors of dependencies on the Arab coast with orders to rise against the Portuguese in their towns on the appointed day and spare none. The rising was therefore general, and from its taking place simultaneously, there was no opportunity of the Portuguese fleeing from one point to another. A stratagem was devised to get rid of the Portuguese armada constantly stationed at Hormuz to support the Commandant. The King, pretending that the dependencies on the Oman coast were being ravaged by pirates, requested Dom Garcia to despatch the armada to protect them ; this was on the eve of the rising, and the Commandant unsuspectingly issued the necessary orders to the Captain-Major, Manoel deSouza Tavares. The latter, however, took two only out of the four ships at his disposal and set sail for Muscat. The revolt occurred on the 30th Novem ber 1521, and commenced with an attack by the Shah Bandar on the two vessels left in the harbour at midnight. The crews were overcome, and a fire signal having been lighted in board the captured vessels, a massacre ensued of the Portuguese residents in the city, who were asleep on their beds, unsuspicious of evil. About sixty Portuguese were slain and captured by the Persian troops and populace, and the remainder took refuge in the fort, which was bravely defended by the garrison until succour arrived from India. In the dependencies the King's plan was faith fully carried out by the Governors. At Bahrein the Christians were attacked, and the factor Buy Bale was tortured and crucified. At Sohar very few, if any, escaped the massacre that took place. In Muscat alone the Portuguese found friends and protection. The attitude of the Arab Governor, Sheikh Rashid, who was favourably inclined to them and doubtless foresaw their ultimate triumph, kept the Persians in check and prevented a rising; and when the chief factor of Kilhat, Vas deVeiga, arrived shortly after, he threw off his allegiance and declared for the Portuguese, in which he was joined by the chief Arab inhabitants. At Kilhat the Portuguese appear to have received warning from the Commandant of Hormuz of the revolt, and, collecting their valuables, made a start for their boats in the harbour, but they were inter cepted by the Governor and the Persian garrison, who attacked and.killed several and captured others. The factor, T. Vas deVeiga, then set out for Muscat, where be found Captain-Major Manoel deSouza Tavares, with whom he sailed at once for the relief of Hormuz. At Hormuz, immediately on the occurrence of the revolt, the Commandant had hired a vessel which he entrusted to Joao deMeira, and directed him to sail at once to India with the news for the Viceroy, and to touch at Muscat and Kilhat on the way. This Joao deMeira did, and was thus instrumental in warning his countrymen at those two places of the intended massacre. The number of Portuguese killed in this insurrectionary movement was about 120.ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL The Viceroy at that time, Dom Duarte deMenezes, on hearing the new from deMeira despatched Dom Gon Calo in advance to encourage the garrison at Hormuz, and to intimate the speedy setting out of a fleet under Dom Luiz deMenezes to their assistance. The arrival of Dom Gon9alo seems to have turned the tables entirely in favour of the Portuguese, and to have restored their predominant position through the dread of retaliation for the atrocity that had been perpetrated. In the meantime Manoel deSouza, the Captain-Major, had been sent back by the commandant to try and recover the prisoners in Oman. On anchoring at Muscat he found the place deserted, owing, as he learned, to the fear entertained by the Sheikh that the new Persian Governor of Kilhat, Reis Delamin Shah, was about to attack the town. On hearing of M. deSouza Tavares' arrival, however, the Sheikh presently returned to the town and solicited Portuguese protection. Having no reason for delaying here, M. deSouza deTavares proceeded to Kilhat where his demand for the surrender of the captives met with a decided refusal from the Acting Governor, Khoja Zein-ul-Dm, who said he had a letter from the King Toorun Shah for Dom Luiz deMenezes, and that he would wait for the latter's arrival. It was in February 1522 when Dom Luiz deMenezes set out from Chaul with a flotilla of three galleys, four fustas and one caravella to avenge the massacre and restore order, having already despatched in advance the new Commandant of Hormuz, Joa6 Rodrigues deNoronha, to relieve Continho, whose three years tenure of office had expired. Dom Luiz anchored first at Kilhat, where his first demand was for the surrender of the captives, now reduced to 26 in number. The Governor replied by sending off the King^s letter addressed to Dom Luiz, which contained nothing but a series of complaints against the present and former Portuguese Com mandants of Hormuz, but he evaded the demand for the delivery of the prisoners^by saying that he had no authority, and must await the new Governor. Dom Luiz being in want of water for his ships, proceeded to Teynwee, where a collision occurred with the Arabs, in which the latter were defeated, and in revenge for which they murdered seven Portuguese they had m their hands. While at this place, Dom Luiz received a message from Sheikh Rashid reporting the approach by land to Muscat of Reis Delamin Shah with a large force and be i seeching armed support. Dom Luiz accordingly detached the caravella for Muscat with orders to support the Sheikh from the sea as far as the guns of the vessel would reach, but to under- take no operations on shore. The Sheikh, nevertheless, obtained the aid of five Portuguese volunteers, and attacking the Persians in the Great Wady completely defeated them, their leader Delamir Shah, being killed in the fight. Dom Luiz arrived at Muscat two days after this affair, and having congratulated the Sheikh, rewarded him handsomely for his loyalty and nrotection to the Portuguese during the revolt. He then stationed a fusta as security for the port .and apparently for the first time established here a garrison of 20 men for the defence ot the town. After a stay of four days, during which time he was joined by two more vessels from Goa, Dom Luiz set out for Sohar, where there was a large Persian garrison. The Arab chief ■n the neighhourhood of Sohar at tins time was Sultan-hin-Mesood, who dwelt in the interior near the hiUs and whose army was composed of 250 horse and 3,000 foot. Another neighbour Innn f . Husem-bm-Saeed, the Chief of the great tribe Ben Jabra, who had 300 horse and 4 000 foot. These Ben Jabra were Bedouins, and possessed more than 600 leagues of country. Sheikh Husein was therefore the lord of all the interior as well as the Island of El Bahrein and the entire coast as far south as Dhofar. Dom Luiz having information about these two important personages, who being Arabs were always at war w.th the Persians of Hormuz, determined to seek their alliance, and accordingly wrote to them, offering to put them in possession of Sobar if they would aid him in ousting the Persians To this proposal the two Sheikhs readily agreed, but Dom Laiz was detained on tisway to Sohar by contrary winds, and in the meantime, by an untoward incident which occurred off the Batineh coast, Sultan-bin-Mesood became estranged. Dom Lmz's plan was that the Arabs should surround Sohar by land while he attacked it from the sea; but on his arrival there on the llth March 1522 he found Sheikh Husein only W1 th bis force in position, Sheikh Sultan having retired in dudgeon. The gallant Pereian Governor, ReisShehah-u-Dm, moreover, had already effected his escape, leaving his garrison 1 m 0 ^ might 1)0111 Luiz arran ^ d *0 a «acb the place at once, but the garrison, deserted by their leader and dreading the resentment of their enemy nls Ilni r , ^ ^V and havin ° bribed the Arab3 were allowed to n tr f tl, i ^ mp in the darkne3s - The Portuguese troops on shore hearing of this, sealed the walls and entered the fort, and having massacred or capturedEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 33 leiij 5| e the inhabitants and sacked the town_, set it on fire, much to the surprise and indignation of aloj their General, Dom Luiz, who, being on board his vessel, had not been kept informed of what ^ had occurred. The Arabs, who had not been present at, or partakers in, the plunder, were not unnaturally H enraged with Dom Luiz for what they considered a breach of faith on his part, but he made atlie what reparation he could by giving up to them the captives and some of the loot; and finally tie having declared Sohar independent of Hormuz, he appointed Sheikh Husein-bin-Saeed aii» Governor on behalf of Portugal under a convention. After leaving a Portuguese scrivener as aiij Political Agent to note the revenues and expenses of the place, Dom Luiz weighed with his ioiq fleet and set sail for Hormuz. In 1526 another revolt occurred at Muscat and Kilhat, both it| s of which were at this time still subordinate to Hormuz. These disturbances were due, it is said, like the former ones, to the oppression and exactions of the Portuguese, and chiefly of Diogo deMello, the then commandant of Hormuz. The provisional Viceroy at Goa, Lopo Vaz deSampayo, accordingly proceeded to the Gulf in May y 1527 with five ships, and by promising to redress wrongs and to punish Captain deMello, suc- ^ ceeded in pacifying the coast without having recourse to coercion. Dom Lopo took the a 1 opportunity of increasing the garrison at Muscat and of ordering the erection of the huge a ( pile of buildings to be used as a factory, and which, as usual in those days, comprised the Gov- ^ ernors' residence, soldiers' barracks, warehouses, and chapel. This factory appears to have been ^1 completed about four years later. In later days it has served as a residence for the Seyyids or ^ Lords of Oman, and though now somewhat dilapidated, is still a fine building, and one of the • chief monuments of the Portuguese occupation on this coast. Among the Arabs it retains the ^ name of Gareza, a corruption of the Portuguese Egreja,' a church. Dom Nuno da Cunha, who succeeded Lopo Vaz de Sampayo as tenth Viceroy, made a tour of the Portuguese possessions soon after his assumption of office, and on his way to Hormuz anchored at Kilhat on the 10th May 1529, where he met Captain Aires de S. da Magalhaes who had been despatched from India with a fusta and two brigantines to cruise against the 108' * , . pirates. m | The factor of Kilhat at this time was Gomes Ferreira, servant of the Duke of Braganza, and he appears to have caused a good deal of ill-feeling against the Portuguese among the ^ Arabs by his arbitrary conduct and extortion. They therefore seized the opportunity to lay jlij their complaints before the Governor General, who thereupon issued a manifesto that he had gj come to redress grievances and would enquire into disputes, the result being that several ^ Portuguese officials who had wronged the natives were degraded and removed to Hormuz. This policy of justice and integrity on da Cunha's part gave great satisfaction to the people and had a very salutary effect in reducing the insolence of the Portuguese officers and improv ing their relations with the people, but unfortunately the good done was but transitory. Nine days later daCunha was at Muscat where he was also engaged in putting affairs ^ in order. The Governor, Sheikh Rashid, at once implored his protection against Reis Shereef, the King's Wazir at Hormuz, who had tried to murder him in revenge for the death of his brother, Reis Delamir Shah. DaCunha, who had been informed of Rashid's former services, promised him his protection and subsequently took him with him to Hormuz, where he obtained ity his appointment as Wazir in place of Reis Shereef, who was despatched to Lisbon in irons to rein answer for his alleged crimes before the King. The current of affairs on the Arab and Persian coasts appears to have flowed on now for alis some years with tranquillity, during which period Sohar and Kilhat, and perhaps other places, and were occupied, fortified, and garrisoned. The system adopted by the Portuguese in these places was to retain their political supre- macy by holding the citadel or fort which overawed and commanded the town, but they did not interfere with the internal administration, and the people were left to govern themselves in all respects as they pleased, even in the towns which had Portuguese garrisons. For some forty years the all-powerful Turks had striven (spasmodically to destroy the growing power and commerce of Portugal in the East, but they do not appear to have extended i 3 ' their operations to the Persian Gulf until the year 1546, when four Turkish galliots, after destroy- i oD ing Kesheen and Dhofar, anchored at Muscat and bombarded the town. After throwing cast- iron shot of a prodigious size into the place and causing terrible consternation, but not much Sj damage, they sailed away again without venturing to land their men. Some days later a vessel arrived from Dhofar bringing envoys from the ruler of that place to complain of the od Turkish proceedings in having battered their town and built a castle there, and to implore the 434 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL protection of the Portuguese. This protection it was deemed politic to grant, and orders were eventually issued for the vessels engaged in cruising to intercept Moorish traders at Bab-el- Mandeb to touch occasionally at Dhofar. The second appearance of the Turks was in 155^, six years later, when a more formidable fleet, under Piri Pasha, Capudan of Egypt, which had been despatched from Egypt by the Sultan in retaliation for the assistance rendered by the fleet under Dom Antao deNoronha to the rebel Arabs at Busrah the year before, anchored in the port of Muscat. The instructions given to the Piri Pasha had been to proceed direct to Busrah, and from thence, in conjunction with the force awaiting him there, to sail to Hormuz and reduce it to submission. The com mandant of Hormuz, Alvaro de Noronha, on hearing of the intended expedition, despatched one of his men in disguise to Shehr to collect information; the spy confirmed the report, whereupon Noronha ordered two vessels to watch Kas-el-Had, and on sighting the Turkish fleet to set sail with the news, one for Goaand the other for Horrauz. Piri Pasha after some months of pre parations set sail from Suez in July 1552, his fleet consisting of 30 sail,—galleys, Bashderder golletas, and galleons. On nearing the Gulf of Oman he sent forward his son with five ships to reconnoitre; this advanced guard nearly captured Noronha^s two vessels, but they managed to escape and carried the news to Goa and Hormuz. In the chase of one of these vessels, Piri^s son had been led as far as Has Mussendom, and on turning back he found bis father had already arrived with the rest of the fleet and had anchored at Muscat. The commandant of Muscat at this time was Dom Joao Da Lisboa, who had been sent out specially by the King of Portugal with orders to erect a fortress to command the town and harbour. This fort had only been commenced about three months previously and was still unfinished ; the Governor, however, well knowing that the Turks would attack him, hastily pro visioned it and threw himself into it with his little garrison of 60 men, after sending off his wife and other ladies in a boat to Hormuz. The first action of the Turkish Admiral was to sack the town, which was undefended. He then turned his attention to the fort, which, as it was too strong for assault, laid siege to and managed to bombard by hauling one of his guns up to a height which commanded it. For eighteen days the Portuguese defended themselves vigorously, but provisions and water having failed, the Governor was induced by a renegade named John deBarrea in the employ of Piri Pasha to open negociations for the surrender of the fort. An interview was accord ingly arranged between Piri Pasha and the Governor, at which the Pasha solemnly guaranteed the life and liberty of the garrison on the condition of immediate capitulation, declaring that the honour of capturing a Portuguese fort was sufficient for him. The faithless Turk, however, did not abide by his promises, for, after massacring the other prisoners, he treacherously chained da Lisboa and part of the garrison to the galleys. Piri Pasha having shipped his booty and the Portuguese gims, sailed for Hormuz, where he landed and plundered the town without resistance, The fort, however, held out, and the Pasha, after bombarding it for 20 days, and finding he could make no impression, was obliged to raise the siege. An offer made by the Pasha to hold his Muscat prisoners to ransom was declined by the Governor, Alvaro deNoronha, but the Turk nevertheless generously released the wife of Dom Joao daliisboa, who had been captured off Khar Fakan, while endeavouring to effect her escape. The delay caused by the protracted operations at Muscat had afforded an opportunity to the merchants of Hormuz of removing their families and property to the Island of Kishm, of which full advantage had been taken : thither accordingly Piri Pasha now steered his fleet, and was rewarded by the discovery of immense booty. He took many captives, including a Spanish Jew named Solomon, who was reputed to be the richest merchant of Hormuz. Meanwhile the Portuguese fleet despatched from Goa had arrived in the Gulf and soon chased the Turks up to Basra, but Piri Pasha, fearful of losing the treasure he had acquired, abandoned his command and fled to Egypt with three galleys, where he was immediately seized and put to death, a report of his conduct having reached the Sultan from Basra. In August the following year, 1553, another expedition left Basra under the command of Moorad Beg, formerly Governor of Katuf, who had instructions to proceed to the Red Sea to oppose a Portuguese fleet which was then cruising off Jedda. The Turkish movements, how ever, had been closely watched by the Captain-Major Diogo deNoronha, who intercepted Moorad Beg's squadron of 15 galleys and two barges between Mussendom and Henjam, and almost annihilated it. After a desperate engagement the Turkish remnants escaped in the night and hurried back to B^sra.EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 35 The Turks could now no longer conceal from themselves the evident superiority of the Portuguese at sea; their efforts against them hitherto, so far from breaking up the Portuguese power, had bad, on the contrary, the effect of extending its prestige. Had the Turks been able to foresee more clearly the dire results in the future to their empire from the change in the course of trade effected by the Portuguese they would doubtless have put forth the utmost of their strength in the East and combined with the Asiatics to expel their rivals from India. Being then in the plenitude of their strength, they might thus possibly have kept Europeans out of the Indian Ocean for many a year to come. The battle of Lepanto had not yet been fought, and the Turks were still supposed to be invincible at sea in Europe; but not even the genius of Suliman the Great, who now reigned at Stamboul, seems to have grasped the vital importance to himself of crushing the Portuguese enterprise in the East. He struck one final blow at them, however, before relinquishing the contest and leaving the Portuguese to enjoy the fruits of their discoveries and monopoly. It so happened that this final struggle was also the most hardly contested and decisive sea fights in which the Turks had till then been engaged. It foreshadowed the disasters of Lepanto, and is described by the Turkish historian as a greater affair than the battle between Barbarossa and the allied fleet under the Spanish Admiral Andrea Doria, fought off Prevesa in the Mediterranean in 1538. The remainder of Moorad's ill-fated squadron formed the nucleus of the new fleet, the organization and command of which were entrusted by Sultan Suliman to the Capudan of Egypt, Sidi Ali-bin-Hoosain. At the close of the year 1553, having arrived at Basra by way of Aleppo and Mosul, Sidi Ali at once commenced his preparations, and in July 1554) set sail from Basra. The Governor of this city, Mustapha Pasha, who had been despatched by the Porte with a frigate to Hormuz, had informed the Capudan Sidi Ali that the infidels had only four ships, and the Capudan, expecting an easy conquest, pressed on in eager search through the Straits of Mussendom. The Portuguese fleet was first sighted by him off the port of Khor Eakan; but it was much larger than he had been led to anticipate, for it consisted of three galleons, four barges, six guard-ships, and twelve golletas. The story of the fight that ensued is thus told by Mitchell from the Turkish of Hajji Khalifa :— ' The Moslems immediately hoisted their colours, weighed anchor, and got in readiness all their warlike machines. With flags hoisted and sails spread, and looking in confidence to the Supreme Being, they set up Muhammadan shouts an'd commenced an attack the fierceness of which baffles description. By the favour of God their fire struck one of the Portuguese galleons, which was wrecked on the Island of Fak-al-Asad. They fought bravely till nightfall, when the Capudan hoisted the lights. The infidels, however, fired a gun as the signal of retreat and fled to Hormuz. Thus by the favour of God the victory was left to the Moslems, who, favoured by the winds, departed next day for the city of Khor Fakan, where the troops took in a supply of fresh water, and after 17 days' sailing arrived in the neighbourhood of Muscat and Kilhat. ' On the morning of the 26th Earnzan (26th August 1554) the Captain of Goa, the son of the Governor, left the harbour of Muscat, and with his barges, guard-ships, and galleon, with their mainsails spread and colours flying, sailed against the Moslems, who, still trusting in God, remained near the shore prepared for battle. The enemy's barges first came up and attacked the galleys, when a sharp fire was opened on both sides and a furious engagement ensued. The infidels then began to shower down their hand-grenades from the maintops upon the galleys, one of which and a barge which was near it they burnt by throwing a bomb into the galley: five galleys and as many barges were driven ashore and lost. Another barge was driven ashore by the violence with which the wind beat against it and was lost. At length the sailors and the troops on both sides were exhausted, the former being unable to pull at the oars and the latter to work the guns any longer : they were obliged there fore to cast anchor ; but even in this position they fought for some time with springs to the cables. They were finally obliged to abandon their boats. Elmshah Reis Kara Mustaifa and Kalfat Mumi, the commanders of the lost galleys, and Durzi Mustaffa Beg, the commander of the volunteers, with about 200 Egyptian soldiers, reached the shore in safety and afterwards returned to the fleet, bringing with them many Arabs to the assistance of the Moslems. The infidels also recovered their men who were in the barges which had been driven ashore. This battle was even greater than that between Khair-ud-Deen and Andrea Doria. Few soldiers are known to have ever been engaged in such a fight. At last, when night approached, a strong gale began to blow, and each of the barges threw out two stream anchors; but the men on board were so overcome,with fatigue that they were obliged to stand out from the shore and sail before the wind. In this way they came to the coast of Bar Jask, where, finding plenty of sea, they succeeded in reaching Bunder Shahbar in Mekran. Here they took in water, and by the direction of a pilot reached Bunder Gwadur.' The Turks, in short, were completely defeated, and there was no mincing matters. The decisive effect of the victory is shown by the fact that they never more confronted the Portuguese Navy in the Indian Ocean. Sidi Ali, after some adventures, was wrecked in a storm and had to abandon his vessels at Surat, from whence he returned to Constantinople overland four years afterwards. This notable sea-fight took place off Fahil, a rocky islet about 6 miles from Muscat, which was henceforth called by the Portuguese the ' Island of Victory.'36 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GTJLF POLITICAL From this time maritime affairs appear to have gone on pretty smoothly in the Persian Gulf; the Portuguese remained undisputed masters of the situation, and the utter rout of the fleet of the Grand Turk doubtless had a sobering effect upon the logical minds of the Persians and Arabs, for we have no record of any exciting events for nearly thirty years. In the year 1580 news reached the Gulf that an expedition was being prepared at Aden for the purpose of ravaging Muscat. The rumour was not credited by the Governor of Hormuz, Dom Gongales, but he nevertheless gave warning to the garrison at Muscat to be watchful and ready. The Governor of Muscat, on the other hand, was fully convinced of the truth of the report, which had been confirmed to him by the Arabs; he knew also that the scheme had emanated from the neighbourhood of Muscat itself; his enemies having conveyed intimation to the Governor of Yemen, a renegade Italian named Mirat-al-Zaman, that immense booty would reward the enterprise. He therefore made due prep arations for defence and stationed a swift vessel off Ras-el-Had to bring tidings of the corsairs. The filibustering expedition, consisting of four galleys under the command of Meer Ali Beg, left Aden at the end of August 1580; in passing along the Arabian coast one of the galleys foundered, but the rest continued the voyage, and giving Ras-el-Had a wide berth, by which they eluded the vigilance of the scout Alvaro Murato, arrived off Muscat on the evening of the 22nd September. Instead of entering the harbour, however, Ali Beg proceeded to the little bay and village of Sedab, where he quietly landed with 150 'men and sent the galleys round to Muscat with instructions to appear before the city at dawn and commence an imme diate bombardment, making at the same time a feigned attempt to land to distract attention. During the night Ali Beg with his band of robbers made his way over the Sedab Pass to the walls of the town, and having posted a party at each of the three gates, waited patiently until the morning broke, and the guns of his galleys in the harbour gave the signal for attack. Meanwhile the inhabitants, having received no warning from Alvaro Murato, and half doubting the threatened danger, had refrained from sending their wives and gOods to a place of safety, and were now slumbering in their houses unconscious of their danger. An accident revealed the presence of the enemy. A merchant named Diogo Machado, desiring to bury his treasure outside the town, came to one of the gates in the night, and passing through it was stabbed by the robbers and relieved of his bag of ducats ; his servant fled back in the town and gave tbe alarm, and almost simultaneously the three galleys entered the harbour and opened a cannonade. The Portuguese residents in Muscat at this time numbered altogether, it is said, about 500 souls, of whom 70 were able to bear arms. At first the utmost confusion prevailed, then, while some hastened to the gates to oppose the Turks, others fled out of the town with the women and children over the Eiam and Kalboo Passes to Muttrah, where they took refuge. It cost Ali Beg little trouble to overcome the feeble resistance of the Portuguese^ and he was then at leisure to sack the town, which he did effectually with the hearty assistance of the Arabs and slaves of the Portuguese, who no doubt cordially detested their masters. Ali Beg spent the day in the work of pillage, and having taken possession of three Portuguese vessels that were lying in the harbour, loaded them with his booty and set sail for Aden. Directly Dom Gonyalo deMenezes heard of Ali Beg's attack on Muscat he sent Luiz d Almeyda with a squadron consisting of a galleon, a galley, and six smaller vessels to intercept and destroy Ali Beg's flotilla. But Almeyda, either not cariug to face the enemy, or led away perhaps by hopes of enriching himself with plunder, sailed to Mekran, where he looted Pussnee, Gwadur, and Teez. Ali Beg's success was the cause of his ruin. He began to undertake piratical expeditions against the east coast of Africa, and in 1589 was captured at Mombasa by Thome deSouza Continho, who sent him a prisoner to Lisbon, where he turned Christian and died. In this year, 1580, Portugal passed under the domination of Spain, and although the decadence of Lusitanian power in the East is usually ascribed by Portuguese historians to the indifference of the Spanish Court, it is nevertheless true that the fortresses at Muscat and Sohar were erected by orders from Madrid. The exploit of Ali Beg had shown that Muscat was unprepared for an attack by sea, and that she would be exposed to similar blows in future unless further means of defence were afforded. It was surmised, moreover, that the Turks had an eye on this port, which commanded the Straits of Mussendom and would have given them all advantageous position in protecting the Basra trade. The Viceroy, Manoel deSouza Continho, therefore received instructions on leaving Lisbon to build a powerful fort without delay, and the commission was entrusted to Belchior Calaca, who commanded one of the ships at Muscat, and who erected it on an eminenceEESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 37 to the east of the town on the site of an aacient tower. It was completed in 1587 and called Sam Jao, now known to the Arabs as Jelali. The fort left unfinished by daLisboa thirty years before^ on the west side of the town, was brought to completion in the following year, 1588, and was named Fort Capitan. Its present name is Merani. In the year 1616 a force was despatched from Goa against Sohar to act in co-operation with an Arab Chief, the Ameer Umeyr-bin-Himyar,who had sought the Portuguese alliance and had probably instigated the enterprise. Besides a land force from Muscat, the expedition was joined by a number of ships from Hormuz laden with stores and munitions of war. After some indecisive skirmishing between the Arabs in front of Sohar, the Portuguese landed their men and guns and commenced to bombard the fort, using gabions stuflPed with cotton for the seige batteries. The walls were soon breached, and the fort was then carried by assault, the Arab garrison routed and dispersed, and the town burned to the ground. The Portuguese henceforward remained in undisputed possession of the place, and the Ameer Umeyr, having gained his object, retired to Nakhl. This took place on the 16th March. The Portuguese now found themselves confronted by foes of a different calibre to the Asiatics they had hitherto had to deal with. The Dutch and English had appeared in the East to contest the supremacy by the sea, to grasp their share of the commerce, and eventually, as it turned out, to overthrow their Eastern Empire. Many and severe were the engagements that ensued between these three nations, but the Portuguese power had already begun to wane and could not long sustain the unequal contest. The oriental navigations of the English commenced towards the close of the sixteenth century, and it was not very long before they felt strong enough to venture into the Gulf as rivals with the Portuguese for the Persian trade. In 1613, the ship Expedition, of 260 tons, with the Ambassador to Persia, Sir Thomas Shirley, on board, arrived at G-wadur, from whence Sir Thomas proposed to march up to the capital, Ispahan, overland. A plot of the treacherous Belooches to murder the whole Embassy and crew of the Expedition was, however, fortu nately discovered in time, and the vessel proceeded on to India. On the way they captured a terada of 15 tons having a pass from the Governor of Muscat, which was transcribed as show ing to what subjection the Portuguese had reduced the maritime trade of the Gulf, allowing no vessel, large or small, to navigate the sea without their pass. The first encounter between the English and Portuguese, in the Gulf of Oman, appears to have taken place in 1620, in which year a fleet, consisting of the London 800 tons, Rart 500 tons, Roebuck 300 tons, and the Eagle 280 tons, sailed from Tilbury Hope for Surat, from whence two of the ships, the Rart and Eagle, set out for Jask. Here they found the Portuguese fleet, sent purposely from Lisbon to oppose the English trade with Persia, waiting to intercept and attack them, and, judging themselves unable to cope with it, were returning to Surat for reinforcements, when they met the London and Roehuch on the way to join them. The four ships together then steered for Jask, where they arrived on 15th December 1620, having captured on the road, on the 21st November, a Portuguese ship of 300 tons bound from Muscat to Chaul with a cargo of horses. The Portuguese fleet consisted of two galleons, one of which was larger than the London, two galleots and ten frigates under the command of General Dom Ruy Frere daAndrada, the Vice-Admiral being Joaa Boralho. There were also two Dutch galleons, one commanded by Ant. Mesquitta and the other by Balthazar deChaves. On the 16th the English were engaged in fitting up their prize as a fire-ship, but as it fell calm d.uring the day, they were only able to exchange long shots with the enemy. The breeze springing up the following morning, the Portuguese, who had the weather gage, weighed and closed. The battle began at 9 a.m ., and continued without intermission for nine hours -, the two fleets manoeuvering and exchanging broadsides until night coming on, the smaller Dutch ship, pressed by the RoehucJc, turned tail and fled, and was soon followed by the rest of the Dutch and Portuguese fleet, which disappeared in the darkness. The English ships anchored for the night in the road. The prize that had been fitted up as a fire-ship had been fired early in the day, but had failed through mismanagement. The advantage, however, remained with the English, who lost only one man, and had but little damage done to their ships^ while the Portuguese lost their Admiral Boralho and thirty men in one ship alone. The next morning the Portuguese were discovered in the offing, to the eastward, from whence they made no attempt to renew the engagement, but remained there during the next ten days watching the English, and occupied in obtaining supplies and reinforcements from Muscat, their object being to harass and delay the English and prevent them prosecuting their trade with Persia. This Fabian policy suited them well, as Hormuz, their base of operations, was near at hand, while the English had no port nearer than Surat to retire to.38 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL 111 the meantime the English landed their cargoes at Jask, and on the 28th December, having determined on renewing the contest, anchored within a cable and a half of their opponents and opened a heavy broadside fire. The action continued until 3 p.m ., when the Portuguese cut their cables and steered off. The English then remained in undisturbed possession of Jask, the Portuguese being no more seen. In the following May the English fleet left Surat, whither it had proceeded in February, to pass the monsoon at the Island of Maseera, where they arrived on the 2nd June 1621. On the 6th July they heard that the London was lying at Soor, having watered at Teywee, where they had lost their Surgeon and Chaplain^s servant, who had been surprised and taken prisoners by the Portuguese and Arabs. The Hart and Roebuck therefore left Maseera aind joined the London at Soor on the 6th August, from whence they all returned soon after to Surat. On the 14th November of the same year another English expedition, consisting of five ships and four pinnaces, was despatched from Surat to the Persian Gulf to encounter the Portuguese fleet and to obstruct their trade. This fleet arrived in sight of Hormuz on the 23rd Decem ber, and the result of the expedition was the capture of that fortress and entrepot in conjunc tion with a Persian army on the 23rd May 1622. This important event was a staggering blow to the Portuguese and commenced,the disruption of their empire in the East. The Persians had no sooner possessed themselves of Hormuz than they turned their attention to Muscat and Sohar. The occupation of the latter place appears to have been easily accomplished, but for the capture of Muscat the aid of a maritime power was requisite, and negociations were accordingly set on foot with the English commander. Being reluctant to enter on this service he demanded exorbitant terms; these were that Hormuz should be given over to the English with half the revenues of the Customs House and city, the English to maintain four ships there for the protection of trade in the Gulf. The terms were not acceptable to the Persians, who were as jealous of the English as they had been of the Portu guese, and preferred to see Hormuz ruined and desolate rather than flourishing in the hands of infidels. The negociations accordingly fell through, but the English commander was ready to sell to the Persians, who had determined to carry on the war in Oman alone, a small frigate which was damaged and of no use to himself. The Persian expedition against Muscat appears to have taken place in March 1623, for in the next month we find that the Viceroy at Goa de spatched Ruy Frere deAndrada with six ships to the relief of Muscat and arranged for further reinforcements to follow from Chaul and Diu to continue the war against the Persians, Ruy Frere was not only successful in relieving Muscat, but felt strong enough to assume the offensive and attempt the recovery of Sohar. He proceeded thither with sixteen ships, and, having landed his men, assaulted the fort, which had been in the meantime strengthened by the Persians. The first attack was repulsed-with a loss of 21 men and 4 officers; he neverthe less continued to besiege it, and at length the Persians were compelled to capitulate and marched out with the honours of war. Sohar was razed, and Ruy Frere then sailed on to Khor Fakan, also held by the Persians, which he soon stormed and took, putting the inhabitants to the sword. Ruy Frere now determined to proceed with the chief object of his expedition, the recap ture of Hormuz. He accordingly established a blockade of the island, which he maintained with great vigour and persistency for about six months, and, notwithstanding the inadequacy of his force, reduced the garrison to such distress from want of provisions that they were almost on the point of capitulation. Meanwhile the Viceroy at Goa was engaged in collecting an increase of armament for the re-conquest of Hormuz, designing, as rumour said (and the slowness of his preparations lent colour to the slander), to arrive in time to reap the glory of its capture after Ruy Frere had reduced the defenders to straits. The Viceroy J s scheme, however, over-reached itself, for he pro crastinated so long that Ruy Frere, being unsupported and in want of provisions himself, was compelled to raise the siege and retire to Muscat. In April 1624, the first squadron of the great armada against Hormuz, consisting of ten ships, left Goa for Muscat under Sancho de Toar, and shortly after five more vessels were despatched. Besides these, 3 galleons were ordered from Mozambique to join Ruy Frere. Ruy Frere remained at Muscat waiting for the reinforcements, but before they could arrive he despatched Michel Pereira on the 24th April with 12 ships to recommence the blockade, and on the 24th August started himself with 25 galleots and many boats to take command.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-85. 39 The siege was prosecuted vigorously by him, and Hormuz would no doubt soon have fallen again into the hands of the Portuguese had not a fleet of ten English and Dutch ships arrived to relieve it. This changed the aspect of affairs, and Ruy Frere was a second time compelled to withdraw his hand when the fruit was almost within his grasp. He retired first to Larek, and from thence to Khor El-Shem, intending to wait for the expected main body of the flee from Goa.. He was doomed to disappointment. The European enemies of the Portuguese were now too powerful in the Gulf to permit them to regain their old supremacy, and all hopes of the re-conquest of Hormuz had to be abandoned. But although Hormuz was lost, Muscat still remained, and no efforts were spared by the Portuguese to force the trade of the Gulf to this place and to raise it to the same commercial grandeur as Hormuz. It was all in vain; for their reputation was against them, and while the native merchants feared, to trust them, the English, who were rapidly gaining the ascend ancy in the Gulf, did their best to concentrate the trade at Basra and Gombroon. The popu lation of the town, however^ became at once largely augmented, and the Arab tribes in the vicinity, who had always been kept on good terms by the payment of subsidies, were further propitiated. By the fall of Hormuz the connection existing between that island and the Oman coast which had existed for three and a half centuries came to an end, though it is related that Muhammad Shah, the nephew of the old King of Hormuz, was brought to Muscat by the Portuguese, who endeavoured to compel the coast Arabs to recognise him as their king. Among the improvements undertaken at this time in Muscat were the rebuilding of the town wall extending from Booma Salih to Bab Methaib, and the excavation of the fosse beyond; a new customs house and a landing-place and dock at the creek. Further protection also was afforded to the town by the erection of the towers at the passes of Kalboos, Riam, and Sedab, In 16^3, the Governor of Muscat was Martino Alfonso deMello; this ofiicer resided for the most part of the year in the factory or ' Gareyza,' but during the hot weather he occupied Fort Capitan, which was at this time deemed of more importance than Fort Sam Joao (Jelali), the former citadel. There were two churches, one of which was the see of the Vicar, generally an Augustinian friar and dedicated to the Virgem del Rozario; and the other, called Delia Gratia, was the property of the Augustinians, four of whom resided in it. As Hormuz had been lost to Portugal during the vigorous reign of a great king. Shah Abbass, so Muscat and the Oman coast were wrested from her grasp by the force of a national impulse, engendered by the rise of a new dynasty. After ten years of anarchy, Nasir-bin-Murshid-el-Yaareby, one of the strongest rulers Oman ever had, was elected Imam in 1624. He soon made himself master of, and tranquillised, the interior, and then set to work to expel the Christians. He first sent his troops against Muscat, but was defeated and obliged to retire. Shortly after, the Portuguese assisted the Chief of Lawa, Saif-bin-Muhammad, with troops and stores against the Imam's forces. In this affair the allies of the Portuguese were worsted and the Imam captured the fort. The Imam then collected another army, in command of which he placed Mesood-bin-Ramzan, whom he ordered to march against Muscat. The author of the annals of Oman states that the Arabs captured and demolished the high towers of Muscat, and that the Portuguese sued for peace and agreed to the conditions imposed on them. But it is clear that the Arabs were in'fact repulsed. After driving the Persians and the Portuguese from Ras-el-Khyma, the Imam ordered Hafiz-bin-Saif to erect a fort at Sohar against that held by the Portuguese, which he vigor ously besieged for some time with a force composed of the Beni Khalid, Beni Lam, and El Amoor tribes, but apparently without success, for the Kazi, Khamis-bin-Saeed, soon after pro ceeded to Muttrah to treat for peace with the Portuguese Governor, and agreed to abandon the siege of Sohar. This was in July 1633. In the same or following year the Imam attacked Soor and Kooriyat, and recovered both those places, by which he made himself master of the whole of Oman, except Muscat and Sohar. Even the latter town, however, fell ultimately to the arms of this energetic prince, and at his death, in April 1649, Muscat alone remained in the hands of the Portuguese. The Imam Nasir was succeeded by the Imam Sultan-bin-Saif, who is said to have waged war on the Christians in Muscat, and to have personally conducted the operations against them until God gave him the victory. It seems, indeed, that he undertook the campaign immediately on his accession, and that he was engaged in it for about two years. The circumstances and date of the struggle, however, do not appear to have been recorded by the Arab chronicler; and as the Portuguese historians are also silent on the subject, they remain matters of40 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL conjecture, which will not be finally cleared up probably until the archives at Lisbon have been made to disclose their secrets. The only two contemporary authors I know o£ who mention a date are the Editor of Hajji Khalifa's Geography and the Wazeer o£ Sanaa. The former, in his edition of the ' Jehan Nama,' says ' The Portuguese had long been in possession of this fortress, Muscat, but towards the year 1070 (1659), a fakeer with his followers took it from them and made slaves of all the Portuguese in it, and possessed himself of their ships. Since then the prince of Muscat has been always at war with the Portuguese.' The Wazeer in his Diary says :— ' In the year 1052 (1642) a number of merchants set out on a venture to Hasa, Bahrein, and Basra, and when they had passed the sea of Fars and had reached Bunder Muscat, which was then in the hands of the Franks, they were plundered by the latter. People became afraid therefore to pass that way. The Ocean also became closed to seafarers and remained so until the Omanis possessed themselves of Muscat, as will be recorded presently. When the Moslems occupied Muscat, trade was re-opened to merchants and they obtained security against those wretches. And in the year 1054 (1644) the rulers of Om^n, the Kharejites, the Ibadhis, became possessed of Muscat, which is on the coast of their country, and had been up to that time in the hands of the Franks. They had no idea they would be able to take it, but they ordered every one in it to be slaughtered with knives which they had concealed for the purpose. All that were in the forts were accordingly killed.' It will be seen there is a difference of fifteen years between the dates given in these accounts. In 1672, the French traveller, Dellon, visited Muscat, and remarks that the Portuguese had lost Muscat by the avarice o£ a Governor who sold provisions to the Arabs at an exorbitant price, but he mentions no date. Hamilton, who visited Muscat towards the close of the seventeenth century, says in his new account of the East Indies that Muscat was captured in 1650, and he gives a very circumstantial account of the siege and surrender of the town and forts, which he states he received from the mouth of one of the survivors, a very old man. Niebuhr, in his travels, merely observes that Muscat was taken by the Portuguese in 1508 and held for 150 years, while the Abbe Raynal states that the Portuguese lost it in 1648. Dr. Badger, author, tells a romantic story about the stratagem of a traitorous banian whose daughter the Portuguese Governor wished to espouse. One of several objections to this story is that the banians have never brought their wives to Arabia, much less their unmarried daughters. Another local tradition, mentioned by Ross in his annals of Oman, is that the Arabs entered Muscat in the guise of peasants, with their arms concealed in bundles of firewood and that they took the opportunity of the garrison being at chapel to attack and massacre them! This account seems to coincide with that given by the Wazeer of Sanaa. It is impossible to reconcile these conflicting statements or to decide between so many authorities, but I am dis posed myself to accept the version of Hamilton and to agree with Dr. Badger'in fixim? the date at 1651. &amp; The few Portuguese that escaped the massacre that ensued on the capture of the towa and forts took refuge on board the vessels in the harbour. Two of these, however, were captured by the Arabs, and the rest retired to Kalbnh, the guns in the forts of Capitan and St. John, which were now turned against them, preventing their stay in Muscat cove. Kalbuh, being of no use except as a point from which to annoy the Arabs, was soon after aban- doned, and with their retirement from this village closed the eventful career of the successors of the great Albuquerque in the Persian Gulf. No expedition to recover Muscat seems ever to have been despatched from Goa or Lisbon, and its loss after the greater disaster at Hormuz was no donbt viewed with resignation as an inevitable consequence For many years afterwards vessels continued to be sent occasionally from Goa to war with the Arabs and destroy their trade; but these efforts were quite desultory and bad no effect in restoring the prestige of the Portugnesc.

A summary o£ political events at Muscat and in Oman during the past year by Lieutenant- Colonel E. Mockler forms the second portion of the report. 2.—PIRATE COAST OP OMAN. 2. This part has been somewhat disturbed during the past year, and hostilities have occurred between the tribes on land. 3. In May the son of the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain, Ahmed-bin-Abdullah^ of the tribe Al-bu-Ali, quarrelled with his father and fled to Ejman, the Chief of which place, Rashid-bin- Hameyd, refused to give him up. The Chief of Umm-el-Kawain then allied himself with Sheikh Sakar-bin-Khalid, Chief of Shargah, with the intention of attacking Ejman. 4. Shortly after the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain despatched two buggarahs, with 50 men and munitions of war, to a place between Ejman and El-Hajrah. The contents of the bugga rahs were landed partly at El-Hajrah and partly at Shargah, in support of the Chief of Shargah. 5. The Assistant Resident, Mr. Robertson, visited the Pirate Coast in her Majesty's Reindeer in the month of November, and touched at Umm-el-Kawain, but Shaikh Ahmed-bin- Abdullah evaded coming on board the vessel. 6. The Resident subsequently wrote to Shaikh Ahmed, saying that the Residency Agent had been instructed to demand from him a formal writing binding himself to abstain from the irregular conduct complained of, and that on his passing this paper his conduct would be leniently viewed. 7. In August the Residency Agent successfully mediated and brought about a renewal of the treaty of friendship between the Chiefs of Ejman and Hamriyeh, which was made by them two years ago, on the conclusion of hostilities arising out of the murder of three Hamriyeh subjects by some of the Ejman people. 8. About the end of November the Chief of Debay, having had some differences with the Chief of Shargah, united with the Chief of Ejman and raided the districts of Shargah and Ras-el-Khaimah. 9. Raids continued to take place between the people of Shargah and Ejman, and between the townships of Umm-el-Kawain and Hamriyeh, and the animosity among the tribes increased until January, when the treaty of peace between Shargah, Umm-el-Kawain, and Ras- el-Khaimah on the one side, and Debay, Ejman, and Hamriyeh on the other, came to an end^. 10. On the 20th of that month the Chiefs of Debay, Ejman, and Hamriyeh, with about 1,000 Arabs and a field-piece, arrived at Shargah, and a battle ^nsued in which the people of Shargah were completely defeated, with a loss of 40 killed and 25 wounded, the assailants losing 5 killed only. 11. The Residency Agent interfered for the protection of the lives and property of British subjects, and held the Chief of Debay, Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, personally respon sible for their safety, B6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 12. At the request o£ Shaikh Sakar -bin-Khalid, and on his written promise to abide by the terms agreed on, the Agent then mediated between the parties, and peace was established on the basis o£ Shargah renouncing the alliance o£ Umm-el-Kawain. 13. In December the Chiefs of Eas-el-Khaimah and Shargah undertook a joint expedi tion against Shaam, a village which had revolted. The place was attacked and looted, and the people being unable to offer opposition solicited terms and agreed to pay an indemnity of 1,600 dollars, part of which was paid down at once. 14. The Chief of Bokha, having broken the maritime peace by proceeding with an armed force by sea, was written to and warned by the Residency Agent at Shargah. 15. Result of the pearl fishery on the banks fished by the Pirate Coast people last year was poor, and 250 divers are said to have died from deep diving. 16. In January the Sultan of Muscat expressed apprehensions concerning the intentions of the Chief of Abu-Dhabbi, Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, who, it was rumoured, intended to raid the Batineh Coast; and the Residency Agent at Shargah reported that Shaikh Zaid had placed himself in communication with the Sultanas enemies in the Sharkiyeh with a view to disturb the peace of Muscat territory. Subsequently, however. Shaikh Zaid disavowed any intention of acting aggressively towards the Sultan, and professed continued friendship for His Highness Sayyid Turki. 3.—BAHREIN. 17. In June a banian trader at Bahrein was assaulted by one of the sons of Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, who was fined S 100 for the offence. 18. Portions of Moharrag and Manameh were flooded by the sea during unusally high tides, and most of the houses along the sea-coast were destroyed, 19. Owing to continued complaints about theft of cargo landed from mail steamers. Shaikh Isa has been urged and has promised to erect a landing-place and godowns for the accommodation of merchandise, 20. In February 1886 Muhammad-bin-Saud-bin-Feysal arrived at Bahrein on a visit to the Chief and remained about a month. After receiving presents he returned to Umm Hawaiz on the mainland. 21. The result of the pearl fishery of Bahrein last season was unfavorable, compared with that of the previous year, 22. The Chiefs of Bahrein maintained friendly relations with all their neighbours during the past year. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR. 23. In April, Ibn-Rashid attacked two sub-tribes of the Ejman who were encamped at the waters of Owaineh to the north of El-Hasa and plundered their houses and cattle. 24. The Ejman tribe, having subsequently received reinforcements, pursued Ibn-Rashid, E1 _ Hasa and succeeded in recapturing some of their horses, and killing others. This incursion by Ibn-Rashid is said to be due to the Ejman tribe having some time ago attacked some people under his protection. 25. In November, the new Turkish Governor of El-Hasa, Nazih Beg, arrived at Katif from Basra to relieve Said Pasha. 26. Said Pasha is considered to have been the ablest and most conciliatory governor who has ruled El-Hasa since its occupation by the Turks. 27. In April a boat belonging to Wakrah was wrecked off Foweyrat and her cargo of El-Katr. dates plundered by the people of that place. No redress was Voided. In May it was reported that the Turkish gun-boat MernM had arrived at Foweyrat, and that the Captain had given a Turkish flag to the in habitants with orders to hoist it on Fridays. 28. The MerriJch afterwards proceeded to El-Bida. 29. Ill-feeling continued to exist between Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah and Shaikh Jasim-bin- Thani of El-Bida, and several raids took place on either side ; both parties were reported to have made active preparations for hostilities, but no actual collision occurred during theRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGLNCT FOR 1885-86. 7 30. In October, in consequence o£ a quarrel with Ali-bin-Rashid and Jasim-bin-Thani, some o£ the inhabitants of Wakrah bel6nging to the tribes of Al-bu-Ainain and Al-Jiran, and numbering about 1U0 men, in ten boats, left that place with the object of settling else where. 31. They ultimately settled at El-Ghareeyat in Katr. 32. In October, Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani wrote to the Eesideut stating his intention of settling at Odaid. In reply, the Resident informed him of the orders of Government regard ing that place, and requested him to renounce his intention of going there. Shaikh Jasim having written again about this matter, the warning was repeated. 33. Subsequently, in November, on the visit of the Assistant Resident to El-Bida, in Her Majesty^s Reindeer, Shaikh Jasim gave him to understand that he wished to submit himself to the British Government in all things. 34. A complaint was received from some banians who had gone to Bida, that Shaikh Jasim had asked them to pay R700 each, in refund of the fine of R8,000 levied from him by Government. Shaikh Jasim, in a letter to the Resident, admitted his having done so, but stated he had not yet taken the money from them. He was reminded of his promise to pro tect the banians so long as he remained at El-Bida, and informed that it would be a breach of agreement if he made the Hindus refund the fine, and that he would be held responsible. 35. In December, Shaikh Jasim sent a force to raid El-Gahreeyat. The village was plundered and four men killed. 36. At present Katr is in a somewhat disturbed state. 5.—EARS. 37. The Administration of the Province of Ears has continued to be in the hands of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, the titular Governor of Shiraz to whom the Sahib Diwan is subordinate. 38. Dissensions between the Sahib Diwan and the Kowam-el-Mu)k resulted in the for mer tendering his resignation in April to the Zil-es-Sultan. The resignation was not accepted by His Royal Highness, and the Sahib Diwan and the Kowam-el-Mulk subsequently became outwardly reconciled. 39. His Majesty the Shah announced his intention of paying a visit to Ears, and officers were sent to the various districts to collect provisions. Owing to the bad harvest this unusual demand on the resources of the people caused much distress and gave rise to disturbances. In August, however, news was received that His Majesty the Shah had postponed his contem plated visit to Shiraz. This greatly relieved the public mind and caused a fall in the price of grain. 40. Much distress prevailed this year in the Shiraz districts owing to the partial failure of the wheat crop. The price of bread rose high and serious bread riots occurred in that town. Some bakers were punished by the authorities, but the persons chiefly to blame were the influential grain-holders who withheld their large stores in hope of profit. 41. Owing to the feebleness of the government of Ears, disturbances were rife throughout the province during the past year. 42. In April the Shahzada Muhammad Husain Mirza, who had been appointed Deputy Busllire Governor of Bunder Abbass and Lingah, arrived at Bushire en route to Bunder Abbas. 43. The Persian Government steamer Persepolis, carrying three guns and commanded by Captain Wolkowitz, arrived from Bremen in May. 44. In June the Motemen-el-Mulk tendered his resignation of the Governorship of Bushire, and Shahzada Nowzer Mirza was appointed in his place. 45. This appointment was subsequently cancelled, and Haji Muhammad Mehdi, Malek-ul- Tujar, was made Governor of Bushire and its districts. 46. An embargo on the exportation of grain was imposed from the 11th September. 47. In December the laying of a new submarine cable between Jask and Bushire was successfully completed under the superintendence of Colonel Champain, R. E., and Sir Henry Mance. 48. In January disturbances occurred at Baraz Jun in connection with the collection of revenue from the Khans of Dashtistan, necessitating the despatch of a force from Shiraz. b18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 49.

Lingah continued in a very unsettled state until September, when Shaikh Kathib applied to the Kowasim Chiefs of Oman for armed assistance. The Residency Agent at Shargah, however, warned the Chiefs of Shargah and Ras-el-Khaimah against interference in matters relating to the Persian Coast, and nothing resulted from Shaikh Kathib J s action. 52. Shortly after the Governor of Bunder Abbas, Shahzada Muhammad Husain Mirza, arrived at Lingah and confirmed Shaikh Kathib as Governor, fixing the yearly revenue at 190,000 krans. 53.

Early in the year the British bugla Nasree was driven ashore at Jask during a gale of wind, and part of the cargo was saved through the assistance of the telegraph ofiicers, who subsequently received a present from the owner as salvage. 62'. The abducted slave Doshambeh, whose case was mentioned in paragraph 60 of last year s report, was surrendered in June by Mir Hoti j but as the slave elected to remain where he was, the case was dropped. 63. A disturbance occurred in August, in a village near Jask, in which some of the sepoys of the native infantry detachment stationed at Jask were concerned. An enquiry was held, and resulted in the ringleader being dismissed the service, and some of the non-commis sioned officers being reduced to the ranks by the military authorities. 64. The case of murder of Ali Bakhsh Khoja has been settled by deceased's brother accept ing S408 from Abdul Nabbi. 65.

A T^siiMe of what has hevn done in the Pevsian Gulf as regards the introduction of the Arabian date-palm in India^ hy Khan Bahadur A. 72. Hakim, L.M.^ Assistant to Political Resi dent, Persian Gulf, The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 4020, dated 18tli September 1868, Lueknow, wrote to the Government of Bombay soliciting assistance in pro- curing from the Persian Gulf, through the Resident there, a quantity of all varieties of the date-palm seeds, especially the El-Hasa dates described by Mr. Palgrave in his book of Travels through Central and Eastern Arabia. Copy of this letter was forwarded to Colonel Pelly (now Sir L. Pelly, M.P.) as per Gov ernment Resolution No. 2635, dated 1st October 1868, with a request to meet the wishes of the Chief Commissioner in Oudh. Accordingly Colonel Pelly, having procured the following nine varieties of date seeds,— viz., Sisi, Khanizi, Zynadhini, Kasp, Kakab from Dashti, and Khedrowi, Gantar, Sameran, and Hallowi from El-Busra,—despatched them to India, advising the Bombay Government, as per his letter No. 141, dated 31st December 1868, of his having done so, and adding that he will be happy to assist in any further way he may be able in this interesting experiment. In his letter No. 2015, dated 18th May 1869, Lucknow, the Secretary to the Chief Com missioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government reporting that all the seeds of the date- palm sown in Oudh had germinated and were thriving; and requesting that directions be given that a further supply of the best kinds of stones be furnished annually to the Province of Oudh, and despatched so as to reach Lucknow in the month of January of each year. The Bombay Government forwarded a copy of the above letter to the Resident in the Persian Gulf, as per Government Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869, requesting him to take the necessary steps to effect a compliance with the request of the Chief Commissioner of Oudh. On the 21st August 1869, Colonel Pelly wrote to Mr. P. J. C. Robertson, then a Vice- Consul at Busrah, requesting him to send a quantity of the best date stones obtainable. In reply Mr. Robertson wrote saying that 'the palm is produced in this district by planting the offshoots which sprout around the foot of the female tree. It rarely vegetates from the stone, or should a single leaf spring up, as is sometimes the case, it getierally withers on attaining the height of one or two feet. The stones being deemed valueless are not preserved, and they are consequently un procurable for the moment in any quantity. If you will kindly let me know by telegraph the number of either stones or plants you desire, I shall forward them to you by the first opportunity. The latter are extremely hardy and may remain for eight or ten weeks exposed without injury; their average weight is about 6 pounds.^ In reply to Government Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869, Colonel Pelly wrote, per his letter No. 187, dated 9th October 1869, that he had forwarded the required date seeds, and enclosed a precis on the cultivation of the date-palm compiled by Mr. J. C. Edwards, then the Uncovenanted Assistant Resident. The following twenty varieties of date seeds in their pulp obtained principally from the Dashti districts, were made into separate packets of 8 IB each, and sent to Bombay packed up in a box, together with two bags of date seeds, 7 and 6 lb each, from Bahrein, and one bag of seeds from Tangistan—Khanizi, Kabkab, Kandi, Shaker, Gantar, Hallowi, Maktub, Khush-kha-rek, Shaikh Ali, Shirinu, Kharu, Jowzi, Chehel-Gezi, Khatu-Shehabi, Nirid-Heni, Shahuni, Kayedi, Sisi, Rash, Kharek-Gutu. In his letter dated 27th October 1870, Bangalore, the Conservator of Forests, Mysore and Coorg, requested Colonel Pelly to aid him in introducing the Arabian date-palm in Mysore, adding that the palm would flourish in parts of Mysore, which were then overgrown with date-grass, a useless shrub, and that he was anxious to try whether this date-grass could not be replaced by the edible Arabian date, &amp;c., &amp;c., and further requesting to be furnished with any information on the mode of culture. Colonel Pelly, in his letter dated 3rd December 1870, replied that he would be happy to aid the Conservator of Mysore and Coorg Forests to introduce the date-palm into the Mysore country, and asked what number of male and female plants would be required. In icply the Conservator wrote, as per his letter No. 1216, dated 7th January 1871, that 20 male and 40 female plants would be sufficient for the experiment.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 17 Accordingly a consignment of 20 male and 40 female date plants was procured from Busreh and despatched per B. I. S. N. Co/s steamer Penang to Beypore for transmission to Bangalore, and the Conservator was advised, as per No. 272-151, dated 12tli March 1871, of this consignment, and further on the 2r2nd April of that year Colonel Pelly sent him copy of a report submitted by him to the Bombay Government on the 9th October 1869, on the cultiva tion of the date-palm. The Consevator, in his letter No. 450, dated 14th June 1871, intimated that the plants had arrived alive and had been planted in Bangalore. * Tlie Chief Commissioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government, as per No. 3303, dated 13th July 1871, intimating that the experimental cultivation of the date-palm was so successful in Oudh, that a supply may be sent annually as requested in his letter dated 18th May 1869, and further adding that no seeds were received in 1870. Copy of the above letter was sent to Colonel Pelly, as per Government Resolution No. 3638, requesting him to comply with the requisition of the Chief Commissioner in Oudh and to explain why a supply of stones was not sent to India in 1869-70, as directed in Gov ernment Resolution No. 1785, dated 3rd June 1869. Colonel Pelly, in his reply. No. 1010-260, dated 12th September 1871, explained the cause of the non-transmission, discussing some points connected with the propagation of the date-palm by offshoots, &amp;c., and requested that the Chief Commissioner might specify what samples he desires a further supply of, that the same might be sent to him; and further, on the 13th October 1871, he sent a bag of dates to Bombay consigned to the Secretary to Gov ernment for transmission to the Chief Commissioner in Oudh. In his reply. No. 5119, dated 7th November 1871, the Secretary to the Chief Commis sioner of Oudh wrote to the Bombay Government requesting that an expression of the Chief Commissioners thanks be conveyed to Colonel Pelly for the great trouble taken by him in securing information about the cultivation of the date-palm, and begging that an annual supply of such sorts of seeds as reach the ' Khoormah 33 stage be furnished without the pulp. He further requested a supply of 50 offshoots of the best sort, and forwarded Dr. Bonavia^s report No. 275, dated 31st October 1871, having reference to Colonel Pelly^s letter No. 1010-260, dated 12th September 1871. In sending the above letter and enclosure to Colonel Pelly, the Bombay Government desired, as per Resolution No. 5912, dated 7th December 1871, to send the offshoots and naked seeds to India required by the Oudh Administration. The Bombay Government further sent, as per their Resolution No. 6355, dated 30th December 1871, the Government of India Resolution stating, ' that so far as the experiment of introducing the superior varieties of the date-palm into Oudh has yet proceeded, it appears to promise ultimate success, and that it is desirable to ensure, for some years to come, a regular supply of seeds and offshoots of the better kinds in view of extending the experiment.' On the 29th of January 1872, Colonel Pelly advised the Government of Bombay his having despatched, per steam-ship Cashmere, oi about 1041b, consisting of the under mentioned kinds of seeds from Busrah required by the Commissioner of Oudh :— Hallowi . . . . • • • • • • • • . 24 ft Khedrowi . ... . ........ 24 „ Sayer ........... ... 16 „ Zahedi .............. 13 « Gantar . . . . . • • • • • • • • . 22 „ Various sorts 5 „ On the 13th February 1872, Colonel Pelly advised the Secretary, Bombay Government, his having despatched, on the 2nd of that month, 96 offshoots per steam-ship Bagdad to his consignment for the Oudh Administration. The Bombay Government, as per Resolution No. 1904, dated 27th March 1872, sent to Colonel Pelly copy of papers including Dr. Bonavia's report conveying the cordial thanks of the Government of Oudh, for the trouble in forwarding the offshoots and date seeds, which were received in good condition, and requested that he would meet with the wishes of the Oudh authorities with reference to the supply of further batches of the date plants required. Dr. Bonavia's report of the 23rd February 1872 stated that the plants were planted in the Lucknow Horticultural Garden, and that a 'seer' of each kind of date seeds had been sown in the said garden, while the remainder was distributed among the district officers of Oudh. In accordance with the wishes of the Department of Agriculture, Revenue, and Com merce, which were communicated as per Bombay Government Resolution No. 4207, dated18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 15th July 1872, Colonel Pelly having procured 30 date offshoots of the following varieties from Aboo-el-Hasib (Busrah):-— Khedrowi No. 5 Hallowi . . . . . . . . • • . . . „ 5 Gantar . . . . . . • • • • • &gt; j 5 Sa'meran &gt;» 5 Shaker 5 Male plants 5 through Mr. Robertson, Consul at Busrah, sent them on to Bombay per steam-ship India, advising the Secretary, Bombay Government, as per his letter No. 1388—378, dated 21st August 1872, of this consignment. The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 4246, dated 30th September 1872, to the Bombay Government, enclosed a memorandum, dated 23rd September 1872, from the Superintendent, Department of Science, Oudh, acknowledging the receipt, in good condition, of the above offshoots, and his letter No. 4481, dated 15th October 1872, conveyed to the Bombay Government the Chief Commissioner's request that, as previously promised by Colonel Pelly, at least 70, if not the whole hundred plants, might be sent to Lucknow to enable them to set on foot a nursery in view of stocking the whole province; and he further added that no more date seeds were required. Accordingly a supply of 100 date plants, as follows,— Sa'meran 24 Gantar .............. 22 Hallowi 21 Khedrowi .............. 25 Kabkab .............. 1 Male plants. . • . . .7 being procured, they were shipped on board the British India Steam Navigation Company's steamer Cashmere on the 14tli December 1872, to the consignment of the Secretary, Bombay Government, who was advised of this despatch and requested to intimate whether a supply of 100 plants would be annually required. The Bombay Government, as per Resolution No. 797, dated 6th February 1873, sent to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, copy of a letter from Dr. Bonavia, Superintendent, Department of Science, informing him that an annual supply of 100 date-palms would be sufficient. The Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh, in his letter No. 481, dated 29th January 1873, to the Bombay Government, stated that the date plants from the Persian Gulf had, with two exceptions, been received in good condition. The Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh forwarded, as per his letter No. 4187, dated 4th September 1873, to the Bombay Government Dr. E. Bonavia's report, dated 19th August 1873, on the state of the culture of the date-palm in Oudh, soliciting that date offshoots should be sent from the Persian Gulf only once a year so as to arrive in Lucknow in September or at the latest in October. The above papers were sent to Colonel Ross, the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, by the Bombay Government, as per Resolution No. 6131, dated 8th October 1873, with a request to give the necessary orders for a compliance with the wishes of the Superintendent, Department of Science in Oudh, and Colonel Ross despatched 100 date plants per S.

The Junior Secretary to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh acknowledged in his letter No. 5076, dated 15th September 1874, receipt in good order of the above 100 dates. During the period of six years the cultivation of date-palm having made considerable progress, the Personal Assistant to the Chief Commissioner of Oudh wrote in his letter No. 3261, dated 17th September ±874, to the Government of India, and forwarded a copy of Dr. E. Bonavia's report No. 389, dated 8th September 1874, on the cultivation of the Arabian date-palm in Oudh, expressing the Chief Commissioner's opinion that no further assistance was required, for the plants they had were sufficient for propagation, and were progressing satisfactorily.EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 19 Dr. Bonavia's return showed that the total number of Arabian date-palms—i.e., the offshoots and seedlings—alive on the 31st of August 1874 amounted to 5,230 in the various districts of Oudh. The greatest height which some of these plants had then attained was 9 feet, this being in the Lucknow garden; and some plants in various districts had fruited^ but for want of pollen the fruit did not come to maturity. Copy of the above papers was sent for in formation of the Resident, Persian Gulf, as per Bombay Government Resolution No. 5964, dated 14th October 1874. In March 1878 a consignment of date offshoots was despatched at the instance of Colonel Ross by Mr, Robertson, Her Majesty's Consul at Busrah, to Bombay, whence they were forwarded to Agra by the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company. In August 1879, the Honorary Secretary, Agri-Horticultural Society, Madras, requested Colonel Ross for a supply of date offshoots and any information on the cultivation of the date-palm. Copy of the Secretary's letter was sent to Mr. Robertson at Busrah, with a request to send about 50 offshoots direct to Madras; and in reply the Secretary was informed of the steps taken, and a memorandum of extracts from previous correspondence on the subject of the date- palm cultivation was sent to him. Mr. Robertson, in answer to Colonel Ross's letter, informed him that he himself, as also the Agents of the British India Steam Navigation Company, had received similar communications, and that the latter had replied that they would be glad to supply the Society with as many offsets as were wanted, and that, therefore, he thought it as well to leave the matter to them, their facilities for executing the commission being peculiar. Mr. Robertson further added that if the Resident still wished him to forward the plants he 'would be most happy to do so. Copy of this letter was sent by the Resident to the Honorary Secretary, Madras Agri-Horti cultural Society, requesting to be informed whether, under the circumstances, he still wished date offsets to be sent by Mr. Robertson, In his reply, dated 14th November 1879, the Honorary Secretary thanked the Resident for the trouble, and enclosing the Resolution of the Committee of the Society, informed him that he had asked Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co. to collect and forward to him 200 date plants- The Commissioner, Central Division, India, in his report No. 2400—R., dated 1st July 1881, on experimental farms, suggested, as regards experiments in date-growing, that at least 100 well-selected young plants, male and female, should be obtained from Bushire through Colonel Ross ; and the Government of Bombay, in Resolution No. 4942, dated 27th August 1881, desired the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, to obtain and send 100 well-selected date plants. Accordingly Colonel Ross, having requested Captain J. H. Newill, then the Assistant Political Agent and Consul at Busrah, to obtain the required number of plants and transmit them by mail steamer to Bombay, wrote as per his No. 97, dated 23rd September 1881, acknowledging the above Government Resolution and advising despatch of the plants; and enclosed some memoranda on the subject of date cultivation and transplantation prepared by Mr. J. C. Edwards, Assistant Resident in 1878 and 1879. Colonel Ross further sent on the 23rd February 1882 some information furnished by the Residency Agents in the Persian Gulf, regarding transplantation of offshoots of the date-palm, to the Bombay Government. On the 12th May 1884, the Secretary to the Government of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh wrote, as per his Nos. 369-1—107-7, of 1884, to the Political Resident, Persian Gulf, saying that the cultivation of the Arabian date-palm had been tried in the Horticultural Gardens in Oudh, and there were large numbers of date-palms which had made such favorable progress in their growth that the experiment was regarded as a success j that as the palms were then approaching a fruiting age further information was required in regard to their cultivation, &amp;c., and protection of the fruit from insects; and he enclosed an extract from Dr. Bonavia's letter dated 16th April 1884, containing certain queries on the subject of preservation and curing of date fruit, fertilisation and transplantation of young shoots, and general method of cultivation adopted in the Persian Gulf, and requested to be furnished with information on the points required. In his reply. No. 262, dated 1st July 1884, Colonel Ross submitted a memorandum on the subject prepared by Khan Bahadur, A. R. Hakim, L.M.

ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY POR THE YEAR 1885-86. Political. —At the commencement of the official year, tranquillity reigned throughout the country. In April the Sultan's Waliof Zikki suffered a reverse at the hands of Hilal-bin-Zahir near Fark, a fortlet in the possession of Hilal-bin-Zahir, the inhabitants of which place, it was said proposed to hand over the fort to the Wali of Zikki, who had therefore marched to Fark to take it over; but was engaged by Hilal, defeated, and forced to retire on Manh. The district of Jaalan was also reported to be somewhat disturbed, and an attack was made by the Beni-bu Hassan on Sineysileh near Sur, in which one 9f the Beni Sinan was killed. In May, the fortress of Behla (Wali Nasir-bin-Hameid-el-Ghafri) was besieged by Sheik Salim-bin Bedr-el-Ibu in conjunction with the Yaarabeh, but being too weak to take it, they soon raised the siege. In June, news was received that an insurrection had taken place at Dhofar, which was confirmed in October by the Wali Ali-bin Suleiman together with the Arab garrison eominc to Muscat; they having been expelled by the inhabitants of Dhofar, from whom, however, letters were at the same time received, in which their friendship for, and allegiance to, His Highness Sayid Turki was expressed, while stating that they had been unable to endure the oppression of his Wali. In July, it was rumoured that Sayid Abdul Aziz, the Sultan's brother, intended to attack Muscat after the Ramazan fast was over, but he was unable to collect a sufficient force for the purpose, and the intended movement collapsed. In the same month the Beni Hina were attacked by the Awamir, with whom they were at feud, in the vicinity of Sib, and three of their number killed; they retaliated by destroying some $20,000 worth of'date property belonging to the Awamir at Khoth; upon which the Awamir, assisted by the Wali of Masnaa Ali-bin-Salim A1 Amiri, and the Wali of Barka, Saud-bin Khanis-al-Amiri, again attacked the Beni Hina, but were repulsed with a loss of 7 killed. On the news reaching Muscat, His Highness Sayid Turki sent his son, Sayid Feysul, to Sib to enquire into the matter / but before his arrival a truce for one year had been arranged by the Sheiks of Semael. In August, Sayids Feysul and Fahd proceeded in the S. S. Bar es Salam to Sur to endeavour to obtain payment of certain customs duty from the Jenebeh, but were unsuccessful. In the same month, a party of Mokabil raided the district of Majaz near Sohar and lifted some camels, but were promptly followed and reduced to submission by the Wali of Sohar (Hamad-bin-Nasir). In September, a serious collision occurred between the Beni Ghafir and Ibriyin in Wadi Sahtani, in which 25 of the former and 45 of the latter were killed. In November, a man was killed at Kuriyat by a party of Beni Battash,for which deed the tribe agreed to pay blood-money. In this month a serious collision occurred in the Sharkiyeh between the Mesakereh on the one side, and the Harth, Hijrieen Rejeybi and al Wahibah on the other, in which 60 or 70 men were killed. Ali-bin-Salim al Amiri was despatched by His Highness the Sultan to mediate between the parties, in which mission he was successful. In December the Political Agent (Colonel Miles) made an interesting tour of 20 days through Oman and the Dhahireh country, and was received everywhere with great courtesy and cordiality. In January 1886, His Highness Sayid Turki was informed that Her Majesty had been graciously pleased to create him a K.G.C.S.I. In the same month an attempt was made to assassinate the Minister, Sayid Said-bin-Muhammad, who was wounded in the jshoulder by a pistol-bullet; the would be-assassin escaped, but several slaves were arrested on suspicion. The occurrence was taken advantage of by Sayid Abdul Aziz to indite a letter to the Minister, in which he endeavoured to seduce him from his allegiance to His Highness Sayid Turki. In the same month the Khoja traders of Khabureh complained of oppression at the hands of the Wali of Sohar; the matter was enquired into by the Political Agent and redress obtained. .

His Highness's ^retey Suhman aud Shaikh Sa^m-bm- Hamid, also accompanied the party, which consisted altogether of 23 persons. We left Muscat on the 11th December, slept at Wateyah the first night and at lanp on the second, and on the 13th December, after halting at Semail for two hours, reached Seyieh, a town of the Beni Jabir in the Wady Bern Bnweyheh. • The storms and floods of March 1885 did immense damage in the Semail valley, and the people were still lamenting their houses washed down, their date trees and cattle swept away, and their crops spoilt; the river rose 24 feet, and the marks of its highest point we^sdl visible on the banks. Some of the few surviving members of the last dynastic family, the Yaarebeh, are living in retirement at this town, Seyjeh, whither they have taken refuge from the persecutions of their successors the Al-bu-Saidis. .c ji t » . December 14U. —I had sent to Nasir bin Muhammad, the head Shaikh of the Benj Ruweyheh, immediately on arriving here, requesting him to accompany me as far as Zikki, and soon after starting this morning we met him on the road with two other Shai s. e resides at Obal, a village three miles from Seyjeh, and was anxious we should pay him a visit there, but I declined from press of. time. Obal is a picturesque spot; it appears like a white hill surmounted by a tower and skirted by a dense grove of date palms. Aw ^ to our left ' nust opposite Obal, is the Nejd of Wady Akk with its three spurs branching off to the soath, forming the valleys of Semed, Andam, and Ibrah. The Wadi Beni Ruweyheh is here very narrow with high ranges on either side. About half way we reach Mezbemyeh, which is considered the Nejd br highest point of the valley, and has an altitude of 2,200 feet. From hence the road runs level or slightly descending to Zikki. Passing Wady Meteh and Wady Karoot we reached Zikki at 2 p.m ., and I put up in a Sabla outside the fort, which I did not enter this time as I had examined it thoroughly on my former visit ten years before. It was rebuilt in the early years of this century by Muhammad Nasir-el-Jabri, and having since stood several sieges is now in a very dilapidated state, but still strong. The circumstances under which Shaikh Nasir surrendered this fort to His Highness Sayid Turki about a year ago were fully reported at the time. The present Wali on behalf of the Sultan is Shaikh Muhammad bin Sinan. The town is inhabited by two rival tribes who occupy separate walled enclosures or Hujrahs, and maintain almost incessant warfare with each other. They are divided by the broad bed of the Wady Halfain, the Nizar dwelling to the south of the stream, while the Yemin Hujrah, as well as the fort, stand on the right bank at the edge of a cliff some 200 feet high, December 15tJi. —Having obtained fresh baggage camels I proceeded to-day to Mann, which was reached at noon. Descending the steep cliff into the Wady Halfain, we rode along the left bank for a mile until we came opposite to Zikkeyt, a small quadrangular walled village of the Beni Riyam, and then crossing the stream traversed a wide and level plain having a gentle declivity towards the south to Manh. The Wady Halfain is here a broa but shallow river, bub soon loses itself in the sand, though it is said after heavy rain to reac the sea at Mahot. The bed is a highway for caravans from Oman to the Ghubbet Hashish, and is inhabited by numerous Bedouins, as water is found^ everywhere near the surface. ^ e frontier town of Adam is, like Zikki, occupied by two hostile tribes, and hearing here that a collision had lately occurred between them, I determined to leave half my party with t e baggage at Manh and push on with the escort only, to which I here added six Jenebe maaBmRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 23 Bedouins. After a halt of two hours we started for Izz, a village in the direction of Adam and about 5 miles from Manh, where we camped for the night. Od the following day, the 16th, leaving Izz at 7-30, we rode over a level but gently descending plain, at a good pace, to Adam, which we reached at 1-30; direction nearly due south, a little east. At half an hour we passed the Wady Kalbuh, a fine stream of water which rises above Nezwa, and after running almost parallel to Wady Halfain, falls into the Ghubbet Hashish. The plain we are crossing is quite uninhabited, and we met not a single traveller on the road. There is plenty of game, however—houbara, partridge, and sandgrouse rise up on all sides, while gazelles and hares start up occasionally from the dwarf mimosas and bunches of desert grass about. As we approach Adam two low hills rise up in front, one on each hand of the road. The one to our right is Jebel Sulakh and the other Jebel Mushmar; they are both perfectly arid, and appear to be about 800 or 1,000 feet in height. As one approaches it the appearance of Adam with the dark lines of its extensive date groves is very refreshing to the eye after the glare and monotonous aspect of the plain we had traversed : it is a true oasis in the desert. I was greeted very civilly here by all parties, and having been invited to visit the town and forts I spent the whole afternoon in seeing what was to be seen. A cousin of our leader Sayid Hamood took us first to the quarter of the Al-bu-Saidis, a walled enclosure named the Jami, inhabited by about 150 families. The chief object of interest here was the house in which the Imam Ahmad, the founder of the present dynasty, was born. He was of low origin, being a camel driver like his father before him ; being a man of energy and courage, however, he rose to be Jemadar of the garrison and then Wali of Sohar. He was subsequently elected Imam by the people in gratitude for his expulsion of the Persians. Taking leave of the Al-bu-Saidis at Jami I went over to the quarters of the town occupied by their enemies, the Moharik, which are five in number, and over which I was shown successively by their Shaikh, Hamid-bin-Khamis, and by the Temimeh of the Jenebeh, Saif-bin-Hamud. There are two other quarters occupied by the Shaibani and Beni Wail tribes, making eight in all. As I visited one section after another, I was somewhat surprised and amused at the intense curiosity exhibited by the Arabs here. They not only lined each side of the road in great numbers as I walked through the date grove from one quarter to another and blocked my path to stare at me, but after I had passed them would scamper round another way to get in front again and so gain another gaze at the stranger. They were all perfectly well behaved and did not attempt to offer the slightest rudeness, but I never saw the like of their open-mouthed curiosity. There is a large fort here originally built by the Imam Ahmad and repaired by the Imam Azzan in 1869, but it is hardly cared for and weakly garrisoned, for in truth the Adamites are too distant from other tribes to be concerned in the usual intestinal wars of Oman, and reserve their powder and lead for each other. The population as near as I can guess numbers 4,600, composed of five tribes, the Moharik, Al-bu- Saidis, Sheyabina, Majabera, and Beni Wail, of which the most important is the Moharik. The elevation of Adam above the sea is 850 feet, being 500 feet lower than Manh and 1,300, lower than Zikki, which is 2,150. No other town of Oman lies nearly so far south as this the outlying picket, as it were, towards the great sand desert which stretches away to the Yeman and the Hejaz, and which is known here, as well as to all the Bedouins of Southern Arabia, as the Boba-el-Khali. Looking towards the south and east, neither hill nor habi tation meets the eye, the line of horizon is as unbroken as the sea; while northward in the distance rises the grand pile of Jebel Akhdar which towers up to a height of 10,000 feet. Most of the Bedouin tribes, which inhabit the border of the huge wilderness on the edge of which we are standing, contribute contingents who roam over it with their camels, but the number of these wanderers is necessarily very small, for the ohly water found is that left in pools in the water-courses after rainfall and some springs of brackish water welling up here and there. Animal life is not entirely absent,—the oryx, the wild ass, and two species of gazelle are found everywhere, and the ostrich is met with in the northern and western part of the desert: it does not approach Oman. The soil is said to be everywhere saltish or nitrous. 17th. —I returned to Manh during the day and encamped here in one of the gardens near the fort. Manh is rather a scattered town with a population of some 2,000 souls of mixed tribes. It has been well described by Wellsted, who cannot suppress a cry of admi ration at the extent and luxuriance of the diversified cultivation around. He says : — tf Minna differs from the other towns in having its cultivation in the open fields. As we crossed these, with lofty almond, citron, and orange trees, yielding a delicious fragrance on either hand, exclamations of astonishment and admiration burst from us. Is this Arabia ? We said, this is the country we have looked on heretofore as a desert ? Verdant fields of grain and sugar-cane stretching along for miles are before us j streams of water flowing in all directions intersect our path, and the happy and contented appearance of the peasants agreeably helps to fill up the smiling picture D 124 ADMINISTRATION EE PORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Manh did not wear quite so fair a dress at the time o£ my visit, but tlie district is undoubtedly a well-watered and fertile one. All the springs here, as they are at Adam and Bahilah, and indeed at most places in Oman proper, are hot; the temperature varying from 102 to 112 degrees Fahrenheit. There is no Wali here on behalf of the Sultan; the leading man and dispenser of justice is the Metowwa Muhammad-bin-Mesud, who is reputed to be the most learned man in Oman. decided to move on to Bahilah to-day, because though it would have saved us a day's journey to visit Nezwa first, as my Arab companions did not fail to represent to me, I was desirous of exploring the country between Manh and Bahila. We left at 8 a.m . and at 9 reached Karsha, a small hamlet of seventy houses. At 9-30 we crossed the W. Kalbuh, and at 10-45 halted for coffee at Timsa, a picturesque village under a hill with a large date grove. An hour later we came to Khamaili, a mystic pool of water famed throughout Oman as the source of all magic and sorcery. The fable is that a man lies im prisoned by enchantment deep down under the water, which has become red from his blood. Any one venturing to drink it becomes enchanted immediately and falls under the magi cian's spell. I drank some nevertheless and found it very sweet and good. After a long ride over a stony plain covered with low black hills we came to Fut, a small hamlet to our left, and soon after the singularly situated town of Bahilah comes into sight. The first view presents a long white wall with bastions at intervals enclosing a large extent of cultivated ground with a huge white fort and lofty tower standing on an eminence in the centre, picturesquely overlooking and commanding the town beneath. Its appearance indeed is more striking than that of any other town I have seen in Oman. From the time we had been sighted on the road, the garrison had continued to fire guns at intervals from the walls as we approached, and as we drew nearer the Shaikh with a party of horsemen, and followed by an immense concourse of people, issued from the gate and rode down the bed of the Wady to meet us. We then halted while the Shaikh and his followers exhibited their skill in horsemanship, galloping round in a circle and firing off their matchlocks at full speed, running races with each other, &amp;c. After this was over we formed procession and rode slowly on through the gate into the town, where we were lodged in a pleasant house and garden. After receiving a visit from Shaikh Nasir-bin-Hameyed I occupied the rest of the day i u examining the space within the walls and the town. On the following morning I paid a visit to the Shaikh at his fort, where he received me very courteously. He is a heavy-featured, unprepossessing looking young man of 22, with much decision of character and evidently complete master of the position. He has obtained some notoriety lately by his murder of his two elder brothers, Barghash and Rashid, the circumstances of which have been reported. I learned here that Shaikh Barghash had long suspected Nasirof sinister designs against him and had prohibited his entering the fort. Nasir, however, managed to persuade Rashid to join in a plot for killing Barghash, and having by the help of three slaves concealed himself one night in Barghash's apartments, he shot the latter dead while asleep. Nasir then proclaimed Rashid Shaikh of the tribe, in place of Barghash; but Rashid was incompetent and soon allowed all matters to fall into the hands of Nasir, who, some months later, becoming tired of the situation, quietly shot his brother through the back one day while they were riding out to Yabrin together. No disturbance ensued, and Shaikh Nasir has since re tained possession, but, though undisputed ruler of Bahilah and nominal Wali on behalf of the Sultan, he has not yet been recognised as Temimeh of the Beni Ghafir in place of Barghash. The fort is a very large building with two towers, one of which is named the ' Burj-el-Rih,' is very lofty, and commands a'splendid view of the whole valley. Our guide. Shaikh Nasir-el- Kelbani, who is the Wazir of Bahilah, told me that the fort was named Hisn Tamah from the Nabhani who built it. I was allowed to photograph the fort from different positions. The upper part, or Alaya, of Bahilah is chiefly occupied by the Beni Ghafir; the lower town, or Sifala, being inhabited by the Beni Shekeyl, Ibriyeen, Beni Ghafir, and others. The whole town is divided into 20 separate enclosed haras or quarters, and contains a population of 6,000 souls. The outer wall embracing the town and cultivation is an irregular parallelogram cover ing an area of about two square miles. I observed no cultivation outside of this wall, which is traditioned to have been built by a woman named Gheitha 600 years ago. Inside were fields of wheat, jowari, barley, lucerne, sugar-cane and cotton, besides extensive date groves and orchards of other fruit. The manufactures here are brown cotton cloth, loongies, goats'-hair cloaks, matting, and hulwa. Bahilah is believed to be a very ancient town, and it was the capital of Oman under the Nebhani dynasty in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. It is the ' Barler ' of Wellsted, who has somewhat misplaced it on his map. The people here have goodRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 25 houses and seem well off and contented; they were still lamenting, however, the damage done in the great storm of March 1885, when the river rose many feet and carried off many houses and date trees. I was much pleased with the general reception I met with here and was glad to have seen so interesting a place. The elevation of Bahilah is 1 ,550 feet. In the afternoon, accompanied by Shaik Nasir-bin-Hamid, who insisted upon showing me every attention in his power, I started for Yabrin, which is four miles distant, and which was reached before sunset. The Shaikh and his followers amused themselves by galloping about and running races with each other all the way. Yabrin is merely a small fort, garrisoned by six Arabs, without any dependent township, and there is no settled population here. Formerly it was of more importance, and in the days of the Imam Belarab bin Sultan El Yaareby, who built the fort about the year 1690 A. D., it was the capital of Oman. As the sun set here it revealed in all its glory and distinctness of outline the huge mountain called Jebel-el-Kor? which lies to the westward of Bahilah and forms the geographical boundary between the Pro vinces of Oman and Dhahireh. It is quite detached from the Jebel Akhdar range, and appears to have a height of 6,000 or 7,000 feet. The chief road from Bahilah to Dhahireh runs to the south of this mountain and is called by some the ee Nejd-el- Makliarim/'' by others the ' Nejd-el- Dhahireh.' The northern road is steeper and more difficult, and is known as the 'Nejd-el- Barak. J After consulting with the Arabs I resolved after leaving Nezwa to cross over to Dhahireh by the northern pass, and as it turned out it was fortunate I did so. SOU. We despatched a Kossid early to give notice to Shaikh Hilal at Nezwa of our ap proach, and started about 8 a.m. ; we passed a hamlet in the Wadi Masalla, reached Tanoof at £, and at 3-30 came to the outskirts of Nezwa. As we passed the outlying watch towers commanding the various approaches, the men therein fired their matchlocks, and as we came nearer, the fort took up the firing with its big guns. Descending into the bed of the Wadi Kalbuh, we rode through a dense crowd of people until we met Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir, who re, ceived us very civilly and conducted us to a subla near the gate. I was then taken to the resi dence allotted to me, and an hour later was visited by Shaikh Hilal^ who informed me that the house 1 was in belonged to a brother of Sayid Nasir-bin-Ali, who was the Governor of Muscat, and was murdered in his house there during the time of Sir B. Frere's visit in 1873. Shaikh Hilal is a dignified and powerfully built man for an Arab, with a broad, expressive countenance, showing much firmness and intelligence. He is now one of the most prominent men in Oman; his artful diplomacy in turning every move in the intrigue against the late Wali a few years ago to-his own advantage and in gaining possession of, first, the fort, and then the government, of Nezwa, drew general attention to him, and he is now looked on as second only to Saleh-bin-Ali himself as a leader. He gave me the idea of being the same sort of man that the Imam Ahmed bin Said was—able, resolute, and capable of any villainy to compass the end he had in view. 21 sf. Shaikh Hilal paid me an early visit; and we had a long geographical talk, during which he gave me an account of the watersheds of the country. He said very little cotton was grown at Nezwa and no cloth made whatever, but that indigo was largely cultivated and used to dye American cloth brought from Muscat. Nezwa was famous for its copper and brass work. After breakfast I took a walk through the town and environs, and was surprised at the prosperity and populousness of the place. Nearly all the tribes of the country seem to be represented here, the predominating ones being the Beni Riyam, who occupy Alaya* and the Beni Hinah, who have been introduced extensively by Shaikh Hilal since he assumed power here. Sifala has six haras, viz.,— &lt;e Akr,' in which stands the fort and which has a fine gate to its enclosure; ' Saal,' unwalled; ' Khorasin/^ walled and contiguous to ' Akr/^ ' Khorasitin,' ' Haret-el-wady/'' and another. The two Wadies ' Kalbuh ^ and 'Abyad' divide the town and join near the fort by the market. Abyad has a more abundant supply of water than Kalbuh, and consequently supplies more felejes. The fort consists of two parts, the ' Kila ' and the Hisn.^ The latter is a quadrangular enclosure, at one corner of which stands the Kila, a huge circular tower 80 feet high, and considered by the Arabs to be by far the strongest fort in Oman. I did not enter it, but Wellsted says that three-fourths of the height, which he gives at 150 feet, are filled up solid with earth and stones, and that the narrow passage inside, leading up from the doorway and forming the only entrance, has seven iron doors to it. Leaving Nezwa at 4-30 I marched to Tanuf, a distance of 8 miles, the same evening, having promised Shaikh Suliman bin Saif bin Suliman-el-Riyami, who had intercepted me on the road the day before, to spend a night in his town. It is a compact and substantial-looking place, fortified with a wall, on which are mounted two guns, and there is a large date grove in the ravine at the back. This ravine is the Wady Hyin, and up it lies the road from Nezwa to Rostak known as the 'Tareek-el- Shas.' *26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 22nd. —Having procured fresh baggage camels we rode to-day in the direction of the Akbat-el-Barak, by which we intended to cross over to Dhahireh. Our road led over a stony plain crossed by numerous water-courses and very barren. We passed several villages/— Homreh, Ghumriyer, and Belad Sait, &amp;c.,—the inhabitants of which were in a very excited state and usually fired at us on our approach, but they quieted down very easily always when Shaikh Nasir Kelbani had explained who we were. The cause of the panic was that a troop of Jenebeh had ridden by in the night; we could see the footprints of their camels; and as they are at feud with the Beni Hinah, who occupy these villages and are the predominant tribe in these parts, it was expected that the Jenebeh were on the war-path, and that their object was to raid the district. We heard to-day also that a band of seventy mounted marauders, coming from Dhahireh to raid the outskirts of Manh, had crossed the Nejd-el- Makharim and camped near Yabrin the day we had left it, and our party congratulated themselves that we had not gone by that road. We now enter the Wady Ghol, which unites with the Wady Shams lower down to form the Wady Bahilah, and ascend its broad bed, here tolerably well wooded and inhabited by shepherds, for two hours, until we reach a hamlet called Mithar, near which we halt and bivouac for the night at an elevation of 2,600 feet. 2Srd, —The crossing of the pass to-day took us nine hours, and the camels were rather tired when we reached our destination in the Wady Ain at 4 p.m . Continuing to ascend the Wady Ghol, which becomes gradually rougher and steeper, we reach the summit about 11 a.m ., and find that the barometer indicates 3,700 feet. From this point we look down a small valley running south, called the Wady Seifam, and then commence to descend the other side of the Akbat-el-Barak, the Jebel-el-Kor here towering 3,000 feet above us. After crossing a small stretch of level ground, the road falls into the Wady Ein, a large and seemingly important valley, with a running stream trending westwards. At 2 p.m . we arrive at Hail, a village of the Beni Hinah, under a jagged, square, perpendicular cliff called Jebel Misht, or Mount Comb. Our approach threw the villagers at El Bin into some trepidation, and they fired a volley at us, one of our camels having his leg grazed by a bullet. They afterwards apologised and explained that they were not accustomed to see so large a party enter their valley. It appears to be the fashion at the larger towns for the soldiers to salute distinguished strangers with blank cartridge j at the smaller and more defenceless places, they sometimes salute you with bullets, but Arabs are so skilful at missing with their quaint matchlocks, that there is very rarely any harm done. The people here gave me the names of several hamlets existing in the ravines and valleys formed by the spurs of Jebel-el-Kor, viz.,—' Shedait,' 'Nadan,' ' Sint,' &lt;f Sunt/ J &amp;c. Early the next morning we continued our journey down the Wady Bin for some way, and then turned off to the right to Bat, a village of the Beni Kelban, with two towers and four hundred inhabitants, where we halted for an hour; distance about 12 miles. We then proceeded on to Wahaireh, at which place the watchmen maintained a desultory fire on us for some time until we expostulated, and mutual explanations resulted in a treaty of peace. the people then came out in procession to welcome us and insisted on our staying with them for the night, which we agreed to do, and they treated us very hospitably. There is a good stream of water here, and the cultivation around includes wheat, indigo, sugar-cane, jowaree, plantains, mangoes, lucerne, dates, limes, &amp;c., &amp;c. 25th December. —Left Wahaireh early and rode to Dereez, a town 8 miles farther on where the Shaikh and his people came out in a very friendly way to greet us; those on horseback running races with each other, while the others stood around chanting their war songs. There is a small tumble down fort here with two guns; population about 1 200 all Beni Ghafir. After a short halt I left Dereez and rode on to visit the fort of Einein a famous bone of contention in this country for many years past. It is merely a large house flanked by two towers, and did not appear to me a strong place. There is a large date grove near, watered by three felejes which are commanded by the fort; but there are no inhabitants. After Einein we passed Iraki, a village of the Ibriyeen, and then Ghabbi formerly a large town, now in ruins, having been destroyed by the Beni Ali in local wars some ten years ago. At 2 p.m . we reached Obri, and soon after one of the camel- men came in and complained of having been looted by robbers on the road. He had lagged behind and had been cut off by two scamps who had taken his matchlock and dagger and a bundle of clothes belonging to my servant, but had not touched the photo graphic kit and other baggage on the camel. The camelman was a native of this place and had imagined the thieves would not molest him, but they are no respecters or persons. On enquiry it turned out that the two robbers were part of the band of seventy who had gone on a marauding expedition to Oman as mentioned above. They had attempted to plunder aRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885.86. 27 village there, but had been attacked by the people, and in the scuffle two robbers and three villagers had been slain. The band had just returned and were scattering to their homes, and the two scamps after overhauling our camel had decamped to a distant village. The Sheikh here was unable to do anything in the matter, and so I got no redress. Obri has by far the largest and most frequented market in El-Dhahireh, and it is besides the thieves^ bazar of the province, where all the loot' collected in Oman and the Betinah is brought and sold by auction. There are 62 shops in the bazar displaying all the commodities usually required by Arabs, and I noticed goldsmiths, blacksmiths, carpenters, and other tradesmen in it. The Sheikh Muha- mad-bin-Abdulla-el-Yakeebi was very friendly and agreeable and accompanied me all over the town; he was very particular in showing me the Jami mosque, which the inhabitants are very proud of, as it is one of the largest and best in Oman. He told me Obri was a famous place for fruit, and that limes, mangoes, dates, peaches, apricots, figs, &amp;c., were largely exported. There is a small fort here with a high tower, but I did not go over it. Obri was visited by Wellsted and Whitelock of the Indian Navy in March 1836. They were here two days ap- parently, and the spot where their tent was pitched was pointed out to me. Their visit was badly timed, as the Wahabees were then marching through, and the two officers were hissed and stoned out of the town and compelled to return to the coast. There are 16 haras or quarters in the town, and the population is about 3,000, composed of many different tribes- The elevation is 1,180 feet. On the 26th, riding due north for 26 miles, we reached Dhank at 4 p.m . After cross ing the Obri range, which has an average height of 400 feet, we traversed a level plain all the way, with low hills away to the right, stretching up to the high range known as the Hajar. To the left or westwards there are several villages, but no sign of a hill breaks the level line of the horizon. It rained heavily to-day, and the air was bitterly cold, so by the time we reached Mazun, a Belooch town 18 miles from Obri, we were all shivering. The people at Dhank were very civil and well behaved, but not demonstrative; they said they had not seen a European here before. The number of souls here is about 4,000, composed of four tribes—the &lt;f Naeem,' ' Washasha,' f&lt; Azeez, ' and Al-boo-shamis.'' They make cloth here. The Wady Dhank and the Wady Boo Karba both join the Wady Safa, a large water-course in the ramool or desert, running to Abuthabi almost parallel with the Wady Ein; the u Jebel Okdat of Wellsted is purely mythical there is no hill range in that direction whatever, except Hafeet, near El-Beraimi. 27th, Lucerne grass not being grown at Dhank, our camels had nothing for supper last night but dates and barley. Starting at 8, we wind up the narrow stony bed of the Wady Dhank until we emerge from the gap in the low hills through which it flows, when it rapidly widens out to a breadth of half a mile with a fine stream of water in the middle. The banks are here about 100 feet high, and it is on this expanse that the famous battle of Dhank was fought between Sayid Turki and Sayid Azzan-bin-Kais in 1869, in which Sayid Azzan was completely routed with a loss of 300 killed. His force consisted of 4,000 men and a field- piece, but Sayid Turki's force, though numerically very inferior, was more skilfully handled and sustained but slight loss in the engagement. Sayid Azzan never recovered the prestige he lost in this contest. After four miles we come to the village of Doot, and seven miles farther is Fida, with a very long though narrow fringe of date-palms along the Wady. Both these places belong to the Beni Zeed. Five'miles further is Yenkal, which I was unable to visit as our road at Fida branched off to the right and led us across a barren plain to Aridh, where we were to halt for the night. This place, like Makiniyat, belongs to our guide, Sheikh Nasir-el-Kelbani, but the people are a mixture from the Beni Shekeyl, Omar,and Kelbani tribes. There is a small tower here but no fort. 28th.—We left Aridh at 7-30 and reached Muskin at 12, the ground rising gradually Muskin is in the Wady El-Kebeer and belongs to the Beni Kelban. Its elevation is 2,750 feet. The Hajar range, like the Jebel Akhdar, slopes gradually to the desert on the western side, but on its seaward or eastern face falls abruptly and presents a precipitous aspect. From noon to dark we continue to descend the eastern face of this range, winding down in a S. E. direction among narrow ravines and steep declivities until we reach Mahbeh, a small hamlet in the W T ady Bani Ghafir, where we camp for the night. To-day the high peak of Jebel Shoum was seen by me for the first time. 29th. —For some hours we descend the Wady Beni Ghafir until we came to Dahas, a walled town with a fort in the centre on an eminence. Farther on we came to the Wady Sahtan of the Beni Ghafir, who have recently wrested possession of it from the Ibriyeen, and at 4 p.m . reach Rostak, where we are hospitably received by Syed Hamad bin-el-Imam in the28 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL absence of Sayid Ibrahim-bin-Kais, who had gone to Hazam. We sat down at Sayid Hamad's house to rest ourselves, and while there up came Sayid Saud, the second son of the late Imam Azzan, a bright, intelligent youth of 18, his face beaming with smiles to find so strange a party in his out-of-the-way, quiet old town. They were all surprised to see us here, as Sayid Hamad said they imagined I was still on the other side of Jebel Akhdar. Sayid Sand lives with his uncle Ibrahim in the fort, a dilapidated mediseval castle, said to be of pre-lslamitic days and very ancient. Rostak is the second largest town in Oman, Semail being the first; there are 15 villages in fief to Eostak, and the population including these is 14,000. There is a good bazar of eighty shops here. The upper part of the valley in which Rostak is situated is called Wady Auf, the lower part is Wady Farah. Its elevation is 800 feet. On the 30th we rode down past the towns of Mansur and Jemmeh to Burka, 4(5 miles and the next day rode in along the coast to Muscat.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1885-86. 29 PART III. REPORT ON THE TRADE OF THE PERSIAN GULF FOR THE YEAR 1885. Exports, The rainfall in Southern Persia during the cultivating season of 1881-85 was unprece- Cerealg dentedly large, amounting to 29 inches. After great hopes in the earlier months of a large harvest, the excessive rainfall caused partial failure of crops of wheat and barley by rust. Exportation of grain was conse quently prohibited by the Persian Government, and on this occasion very properly. The price of bread rose to almost famine prices in Shiraz, and much distress prevailed there. This was alleged, and is generally believed, to be owing not so much to actual scarcity of grain, as to large quantities being stored up by influential officials as a speculation. Some wheat was certainly imported into Persia from India; but the quantity was inconsiderable, and it was thought that had the stores referred to been freely sold, any importation would have been unnecessary. Distress in the interior from dearness of food naturally depreciated piece-goods, &amp;c., and importers of Manchester goods sustained heavy losses; and trade generally throughout South Persia has been much injured and depressed. Whether it will recover depends greatly on the harvest of 1886, the prospects of which are at present (March) favorable. Owing to the conflicting interests of the Custom House and the governing authorities^ much difficulty is experienced in preventing levy of export duty twice over on grain purchased for British merchants at Bunder Kig and Dilam and brought to Bushire. Refunds have been obtained in most cases, but the evil is not wholly removed. The opium crop was fairly good, and at the opening season was in good demand, but Opium and Tobacco owing to a decline in the China market, the demand up - country fell away, and the remainder of the crop commands lower prices for the London market. Quantity of Persian opium of 1885 is somewhat inferior to that of 1884. Tobacco was exported in fair quantities. Imports. The year 1885 was very unfavorable to importers in Southern Persia. Could they have Manchester oods foreseen the course of events, their operations would have been greatly restricted and heavy losses avoided; as it was, the quantity of goods imported was as large as the previous year. For at the beginning of the year there was a good demand for Manchester goods, and Persian merchants contracted freely with importing houses at Bushire for forward delivery. Later in the year the rise in the price of bread caused a corresponding fall in Manchester goods, and these have been selling at a loss to importers. The market being thus overstocked, there will probably be a great decrease in this trade in 1886. A good deal, however, depends on the result of the wheat harvest. Another source of loss to importers was the steady decline in the value of silver ; those who speculated on a rally of the rupee must have suffered. At present the pound sterling equals 34 krans against 27 krans a few years back. The decline in value of copper in the home market induced many native dealers to Co pp er speculate in that article, which, however, fell in Persia also, and has never been known to be cheaper than at present. The once brisk trade with Java in sugar finally ceased in 1885, being supplanted by Mauritius and beet sugar manufactured in Europe. The French sugar was backed by bounties, but is now suffering from competition of German loaf-sugar manufactured chiefly in Itzhac in Holstein. This sugar is being sold in Persia 5 or 6 per cent, cheaper than French sugar, whilst it is equally valued. It is to be remarked that the importation of French sugar is increasing at Bunder Abbass, and a Russian firm of Marseilles has established an agency there. Resources The attempt to work the naptha springs at Daliki mentioned in the last report has been abandoned.30 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Asbestos of fine quality has been found in considerable quantity in the neighbourhood of Kirman, but the expense of carriage to the sea will probably prevent the mines being profitably worked. Persian ports have not contributed much to the demand for tonnage during the past year owing to the interdict on exportation of cereals. Freights Shipping. f or outward cargoes have not altered, but homeward freights have steadily declined. The French line of steamers, Messrs. Poing, Destere, Mesmer&amp; Co., has been discontinued, and a new English Company is projected to run between England and Busrah. The exchange on Bombay was rather higher than in 1884, Exchange. being from 250 to 262 krans per 100 rupees for cheques. There was a decline in the export of pearls. Pearl trade. S. B.

PAET I—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—MUSCAT STATE. During the first portion of the year under review, that is to say, until the end of October 1886, Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles was in charge of the Persian Gulf Political Residency, and had the honour in July of presenting His Highness the Sultan of Muscat with the insignia of Knight Grand Commander of the Star of India. The impressive nature of the ceremony, and its significance, were enhanced by the announcement made on the occasion, to the effect that His Highness Seyyid Toorkee could rely on the support of the British Govern, ment against unprovoked aggression during his own lifetime. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler, who hfld charge of the Muscat Political Agency during the first half of the official year, has furnished the summary of events in Oman which forms the second part of this report. 2.—PIRATE COAST OF OMAN. The following are the independent districts or townships of the so-called Pirate Coast of Oman, with the ruling Chiefs who are parties to the maritime truce • (1) Ras-el-Kheimah.—Shaikh Hameyd-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe El-Kowasim or J owasim. (2) Umm -el-Kawain.—Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali. (3) Ajman.—Shaikh Rashid-bin-Hameyd, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali. (4) Shargah. Shaikh Sakar-bin-Khalid, of the tribe El-Kowasim. (5) Debay.—Shaikh Rashid-bin-Maktum, of the tribe Al-bu-Falasah. (6) Abu-Dhebbi.—Shaikh Za^eed-bin-Khalifah, of the tribe Beni-Yas. During the year the several Chiefs observed their engagements to the British Government and no breach of the maritime truce occurred, but, as usual, petty disturbances, the result of tribal jealousies, were not wanting on land. In the winter of the previous year the townships of Ras-el-Kheimah, -Rae-el-Kawain, and Shargah were leagued against Debay, A]man, and Himriyah, the latter township being originally, and still nominally, a dependency of Shargah, but now disavowing allegiance. On the.defeat of Shargah by the latter coalition, the Chief of Shargah agreed to renounce the alliance of Umm- el-Kawain and came to terms with his enemies. This truce, however, only affected Shargah, and the hostility between Debay, Ajman and Himriyah on the one side, and Ras-el-Kheimah on the other, continued. In April it was reported that Debay bad incited the Shaikh of Kumzar, the people of Bokha, and some of the tribe El-Shuhuh to annoy Ras-el-Kheimah, and that raids had occurred in consequence. The ill-feeling so arising has continued throughout the year and is still active. Between Umm-el-Kawain and the rival neighbours, Ejman and Himriyah, petty raids and forays were of frequent occurrence. An attempt made by Shaikh Za'eed-bin-Khalifah of Abu-Dhebbi in April to effect peace by mediation, failed through the obstinacy of the Umm- el-Kawain Chief. In retaliation for a raid made by Himriyah in May, the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain made a sudden attack on the town of Himriyah, the greater part of the men of which place weie6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL away on the pearl banks. The Umm-el-Kawain force entered Himriyah, which they pillaged and fired, carrying off twenty-five slaves and some cattle and booty. The Chief of Himriyah shut himself up in his fort, and the Umm-el-Kawain force withdrew. A few men and women were killed on this occasion. To avenge this disaster,, Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, the Chief of Debay, took the field, in June, with 35 horsemen and 400 camel-riders, and proceeded against Umm-el-Kawain, being joined on the way by contingents from Himriyah and Ajman. When in sight of Umm- el-Kawain and awaiting expected reinforcements, the Chief of Himriyah proposed to destroy certain date-groves belonging to Umm-el-Kawain, but to this the Debay Chief would not consent. The Himriyah Chief then proceeded to make petty raids towards Umm-el-Kawain, and falling in with two men of the Beni-Katab made them prisoners and slew a man of the Alali tribe, who was leaving Umm-el-Kawain. The Chief of Debay disapproving these pro ceedings broke up his camp and returned home. The ex-Chief of Shargah, Shaikh Salim-bin-Sultan, thought the time was favourable for an attempt to regain his position at Shargah, and visited Ajman with this view. His hopes being disappointed he returned to the island of Bu-Musa. In June a feud broke out between Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Ali of the El-Noeym of El- Bereymi and the El-Jowasim, owing to the Noeymi^s dissatisfaction at his treatment when on a visit to the Chief of Shargah. Some raids were made by the El-Noeym towards Shargah, and an attack on that town or on Ras-el-Kheimah was apprehended. In September, Shaikh Sakar-bin-Sultan of Shargah preceeded on a visit to the Chief of Debay to renew the treaty of alliance they had formed^ and to endeavour to induce the Debay Chief to join with him in attacking Ajman. The cause of the renewal of hostility between Shargah and Ajman was as follows A respectable merchant of Ajman named Khalifah-bin-Masabbah, being displeased with the Chief of Ajman removed to Shargah, whereupon the Ajman Chief seized Khalifah's house and property, and detained his boat and crew prohibiting the latter from joining him at Shargah. The Shargah Chief remonstrated, and requested Ajman either to allow the crew to join Khalifah or to pay the amount of the latter's claim against them. This request not being complied with, divers began to desert from Shargah to Ajman and vice versa. Shargah having consulted Umm-el-Kawain as to the propriety of attack- ing Ajman, the Chief of Umm-el-Kawain tried to effect a reconciliation, advising Ajman to settle Khalifah-bin-Masabbah's just claims, but the Ajman Chief declined, and sought the alliance of Umm-el-Kawain, but without success. Eventually, by the intervention of the Residency Agent, the crew of Khalifah-bin-Masabbah's boat were restored to him. On the 22nd November 1886, Shaikh Hashar-bin-Maktum, Chief of Debay, died. The choice of his successor lay between the late Chiefs son Maktum and his brother Rashid. Each had supporters of nearly equal numbers, but eventually the elders of the tribe prevailed on the people to decide the matter peaceably, and Shaikh Rashid-bin-Maktum was elected Chief. The election being open to no objection was recognised by the Resident. The pearl fishery on the Oman Coast having been unsatisfactory, and the last take of mother-o'-pearl in the Red Sea having been considerable, some 200 boats have gone from Oman to the Red Sea for this season's fishing with more numerous crews than usual 3.—BAHRAIN. These islands have enjoyed peace and prosperity during the past year, and there is no thing of interest to add to their history. Shaikh Eesa-bin-Ali, continues to maintain intimate friendly relations with the Na eem tribe of the mainland, to whom, and to other Arabs of the mainland, he makes yearly presents of considerable value. Indeed a large portion of the revenues of Bahrain are dissipated m this manner without any ostensible compensating advantage. In the early part of the year the Moteserrif of El-Hasa wrote to Shaikh Eesa accusing him of having caused the secession of certain Arab tribes from the Governor of El-Bidda, and also of having aided the Chief of Abu-Dhebbi in his movements against El-Katr. Shaikh esa e 18 ©tter to the Acting Resident, who advised him to reply in courteous terms that the reports which had reached the Turkish Governor were unfounded. In the summer, robberies were committed on Bahrain boats in the Turkish port of Eb , ^d remonstrances were duly made. These annoyances have ceased of late. In August Abdullah-bin-Su'ood-bin-Feysal visited Bahrain, probably in hopes of receive ncr-rvrfiSftTirs trom tnp (ihiAf 1 J rRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-87. 7 About the same time a messenger arrived in Bahrain from Fath Ali Khan, Persian Governor of Lar, bearing presents for Shaikh Eesa, but the articles were returned unaccepted. The pearl divers worked on the banks from 6th August to 9th October, when operations ceased. The season was not a successful one. The Sublime Porte having made representations to the British Government, interceding for the release of Shaikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah from Aden, in view to his retiring to spend the remainder of his days in the holy places of Arabia, the Government of India decided to release the Shaikh on the 16th February, on the occasion of the celebration of Her Majesty^s Jubilee, and this was accordingly done. It does not appear that Muhammad- bin-Khalifah personally cared whether he resided at Aden or at Mecca, his only wish being to return to Bahrain—a wish which could not well be acceded to. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR. The Province of Nejd appears to have been singularly tranquil during the past year, and no news of any interest has been received Neia - thence. An uneventful year in El-Hasa. Nazeeh Pasha, ElrHasa. the Muteserrif, was relieved in March by Saleh Pasha. Interest in the events of this district chiefly centres about El-Bida'a and its vicinity, El Katr and the differences between Shaikh Jasim-bin- Muhammad Thani and his Bedouin followers on the one side, and his quondam adviser, Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, and certain seceding coast Arabs on the other. Dissensions have, during the past few ^ars, been rife amongst the Arabs residing under the jurisdiction of Shaikh Jasim of El-Bida^a, and bodies of seceders first settled at El-Foweyrat on the Katr Coast, where they are to some extent under the protection of the Noeym tribe who maintain intimate friendly relations with the Chief of Bahrain. In the year 1885 a body of the Wakrah Arabs consisting of about 100 men of the tribes Al-bu-Ainain and Al-Jehran, owing to disputes with their own Chief and with * Ghareyah or Ghareyat. Shaikh Jasim, left Wakrah and settled at a place named El-Ghareyah * in Katr. A coalition has thus been formed to resist Shaikh Jasim, and during the past year Muhammad-bin- Abdul Wahab, having quarrelled with Jasim, identified himself with the opposing faction. A conference took place between Jasim and Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab in presence of the commander of a Turkish gun-boat at El-bida'a, when the Turkish officer suggested that Jasim should let the people of Ghareyah remain in peace under Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab. Shaikh Jasim was much annoyed at the proposal and incited his adherents to attack El-Ghareyah, but they were beaten off with the loss of a few men of the Beni-Hajir. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab entered on a course of intrigue with the Turkish officials of El-Hasa, apparently with the object of ousting Shaikh Jasim and obtaining for himself the post of Kaim Makam of El-Katr under the Turkish Government. He is said to have advised the institution of a Turkish custom house at El-Bidk, a measure which seems to have been favourably considered by the Turkish officials whilst the inhabitants warmly protested against it. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had transferred his residence from El-Bida'a to Ghareyah, proceeded on a visit to El-Hasa, whence he returned in May, via Ojair, accompanied by a body of about 50 Turkish gendarmes, of whom 20 were said to be for the protection of Ghareyah and the rest for the relief of the garrison of El-Bida. It was reported that the Muteserrif of El-Hasa had proclaimed Ghareyah to be Turkish territory. Subsequently the commander of the Turkish gun-boat Zofiaff landed at Ghareyah, and made notes of the leading inhabitants, &amp;e. Shaikh Jasim greatly resented the position assumed by Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, with the aid and support of the Turks, of Governor of Ghareyah, and threatened to withdraw from El-Bida^a with his adherents and to commence hostilities against Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab. In July it was reported that Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab has visited Shaikh Jasim at El-Bida^a, and that terms of reconciliation were arranged between them with the cognisance of the Turkish commander. The Turkish corvette Zohaff fired a salute of 21 guns in honour of the occasion, but the terms agreed on were kept secret.8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL In August two Hindu traders were attacked and slightly wounded by Bedouins during the absence of Shaikh Jasim. Khan Bahadur Abdur Rahim Hakim proceeded to the spot in H. M. S. Kingfisher and investigated the matter. There was strong suspicion of eollu- sion on the part of Shaikh Jasim; but as it was not proved that he was concerned, and as he disavowed having had any hand in the outrage in a very solemn manner, it was not consider ed necessary or advisable to take severe steps against him. During the autumn several eases of petty piracy occurred on the coast of Ei-Katr. Small parties of Beni-Hajir Bedouins seizing small boats lying on the shore put out in them and robbed passing vessels. In view to checking these disorders H. M. S. Sphinx proceeded to the Katr coast carrying the Residency Confidential Agent, Aga Muhammad Rahim, who had interviews with various headmen, delivered the Residents letters to them, and obtained verbally and in writing assurances of their co-operation in endeavouring to put down these irregularities. Several robberies took place on boats of Bahrain in the waters of El-Kateef, the Turkish officials showing their usual apathy and indifference. Reports of these incidents were for warded, as usual, to the Political Resident in Turkish Arabia. Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab, who had continued to keep up an active correspondence with the Turkish officials of El-Hasa and Turkish Arabia, visited Bahrain in winter. He was there met by the El-Jehrain from El-Gherayah, about 250 in number, and it was arranged that these people should settle at Darain inthe Kateef District, where Muhammad-bin- Abdul Wahab would join them later and become their leader. He obtained permission of the Governor of El-Hasa for this settlement. Probably, indeed, it had been preconcerted for some time. By this migration El-Ghareyah has become nearly depopulated, whilst Darain appears on the fair way to becoming a village of some importance. 5.—FAilS. The administration of the province of Ears has undergone no change since the last report was written. In former years the whole province, extending from Bushire to the Mekran coast, along the sea coast, was under a Governor-General whose seat of Government was the central town of Shiraz. At present the Government of Shiraz is subordinate to His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, who resides at Ispahan, and the sea-ports of Lingah, Bunder Abass and dependencies are severed from the Government of Shiraz and are under theAmeen- es-Sultan, Minister for Customs, &amp;c., who administers these districts from the capital. At Shiraz the titular Governor is His Royal Highness the Jelal-ed-dowlah, now entered ShiraZi on adolescence, but His Excellency the Sahib Diwan continues to be the virtual administrator of that portion of Ears which is still under the Government of Shiraz, and his rule during the period under review was singu larly unfortunate. Although the rainfall of 1885-86 was abundant, the crops were again attacked by 'rust' and the harvest was consequently scanty. Great distress prevailed in Shiraz culminating in a severe bread riot in July. On this occasion the Persian Telegraph Office was entered by the mob and wrecked, and the persons of the Telegraph officers were for a time in considerable danger. Througliont the districts of Shiraz much disorder prevailed and robberies and outrages were very frequent. The Kashkai and other Eels were completely out of hand, and plundered without fear and with impunity. This state of things was intensified by quarrels between the Eel-Kham, Sultan Muhammad Khan, and the Eel-Begi, Darab Khan, neither of whom col- lected or paid the State revenues. 1 . d ; ssensions also existed between the Sahib Diwan and his nephew, the Kawwam- ul-Mulk, which, doubtless, contributed much to keep up disorder in the town and districts. The strife between the relatives has recently led to the downfall of the Kawwam-ul-Mulk, who was taken to Ispahan and put in chains. The Eel.Begi, Darab Khan, has also encountered similar fate, and the affairs of the Kashkai Eels have been entrusted to the Eel-Khani. . ^(-'ffic'; Agent at Shiraz, Mirza Muhammad Khan, Motcmin-el-Wazai'ah, having been transferred to the same post at Bushire, was succeeded by Haji Mirza Aga Khan, nephew of the Sahib Diwan. 6 Her Majesty's Jubilee was celebrated at Shiraz on 16th February. Haji Muhammad Mehdi, the Malek-et-Tujar, who was Governor of Bushire at the Bushire and Districts. opening of the year, resigned in May and was replaced in the Government by Haji Fath Ali Khan. Subsequently HisRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-87. 9 Excellency Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk was appointed Governor of Bushire and its districts, whilst Mirza Husain Khan, Motemin-ul-Mulk, was made Governor of Behbahan. Serious disturbances took place at Borazjan in April. A French vessel of war, the Sane, visited Bushire in April and proceeded to Mohamme- rah, where they embarked M. and Madame Dieulafoy, who had been excavating the ruins at Susa and carried to France a large ' Trouvaille.' The U. S. frigate Brooklyn visited Bushire in November, and the Captain and several officers visited Shiraz, where they were hospitably received and entertained. Chevalier R. C. Keun de Hoogerwoerd, Consular Representative of the Netherlands in Persia, returned to Bushire from leave in February. Shaikh Kadtheeb has remained in charge of Lingah as Deputy Governor, contracting to farm the revenues. Lingah (as well as Bunder Abbass) is under the Ameen-es-Sultan. The Arab population of Lingah are in favour of Shaikh Kadtheeb, preferring an Arab to a Persian Governor, but the Shaikh's tenure of office is precarious. The Government of Bunder Abbass is administered locally by persons of no rank or stand ing. These persons are selected by the Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire under the orders of the Ameen-es-Sultan. The system is eminently unsatisfactory as regards British commercial interests, as responsibility is shifted at convenience from one official to another. The Shaikh of Kishm, by name Ibrahim, was arrested by the Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire and sent in chains to Teheran subsequently. His cousin Shaikh Hasan was appointed Shaikh of Kishm. Shaikh Ibrahim was accused of allowing the Shias of Kishm to be assaulted by Sunnis during the Moharram, and had paid a fine of 2,000 kerans on that account. As a matter of fact, he appears to have taken measures to protect the Shias on the occasion. Colonel Ben. Williams, Director of Remounts for India, assisted by Veterinary Surgeon Rayment, was engaged in purchasing horses for Government in South Persia during the summer and autumn, and succeeded in collecting several hundred serviceable animals. This was the first experiment in the way of purchasing direct in Persia. 6.—ARABISTAN. This province has been undisturbed during the past year. Shaikh Miza'al Khan retained the government of Mohammerah and its districts undisturbed. Lieutenant-Colonel and Madame Dieulafoy made very successful excavations at Susa, and carried off to France a large and valuable collection of antiquities. 7.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. In May 188B a raid was made from Kalat territory on the small village of Firozabad near Sirbaz on the Persian side of the frontier. One Yar Muhammad Rind, a cousin of Mir Mowladad, Chief of Sirbaz, and himself a Persian subject, had retired from the Persian side to Mand, where he collected about 150 men, whom he led against Firozabad, and in the fight which took place a few men fell on both sides, Yar Muhammad subsequently fled to Karachi, where he was arrested, and Colonel Reynolds was directed by the Government of India to investigate the case. At Gwadur, Colonel Reynolds was met by General Zeyn-el-Abidin, Persian Governor of Baluchistan, Mir Mowladad, and others and the matter was gone into. The Persian Government pressed for the surrender of Yar Muhammad to their officers, but this demand was not complied with. The Baho district under Muhammad Ali is reported in a lamentable state owing to excessive taxation, the result of Persian pressure. The sea coast village of Gwetter has been deserted by the inhabitants who have mostly settled at Jewni in Kalat territory. Many of the Baho people have emigrated to Karachi— solitudinem faciunt. A native of India was murdered in Baho, and the suspected man was arrested by the Persian Governor and brought to Gwadur, where Mr. Ffinch investigated the charge and evidence. There seemed no reason to doubt the man's guilt, and General Zeyn-el-Abidin promised to dispose of the case according to Shara law, but on return to Baho the man was released. Mr. Ffinch was of opinion that this was done because of the refusal to hand over Yar Muhammad Rind to the Persians. A fort has been built at Pishkan, the western boundary of the Gwadur district, by order of His Highness the Sultan of Muscat.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Mir Hoti, Chief of Gaih, the most extensive coast district of Mekran, died at Eampur on the 2nd of February 1887. It is not known who the successor will be. The last seasons rainfall in Mekran was fairly good. In December the Persian Government sent an Agent to Gape Jask with orders to estab lish a Government House and Custom House there, and to furnish minute reports of the proceedings of the English officials at that place. It appears that alarming reports had reached His Majesty the Shah of the doings and designs of the British in that quarter, which had greatly disturbed the Eoyal mind. The facts were as follows:—In accordance with a convention between the British and Persian Govern, ments, dated 1868, the Government Indo-European land line of telegraph was extended from Gwadur to Cape Jask and the latter place became the terminus of land line and sub-marine cable. The rocky and then uninhabited promontory of Jask was, with the assent of the Persian Government and authorities, fixed on for the erection of the necessarily somewhat large telegraph station. At that period, as now, Jask was under the Government of Bunder Abbass, but the Persian authorities took little active interest in the Baluch districts and the petty Chiefs were left much to themselves. In pursuance of the system which had been observed in view of securing the telegraph line from wilful injury at the hands of the Balueh inhabitants along the coast of Mekran, the headmen of the districts near Jask^ namely, Mir Abdul Nubbi and Mir Ali, were assigned subsidies of R40 and 30, respectively, in consideration of their promising to protect the wires, &amp;c., from injury in their districts. In course of years, and in absence of interference of the Persian authorities, a village grew up in the vicinity of the telegraph buildings, and in the year 1879 a company of sepoys of the Bombay Marine Battalion being compelled to leave Bassidore on account of its unhealthiness was placed at Jask, and quarters erected for their accommodation. Subsequently, on a detach ment being removed from Gwadur, it was transferred to Jask, bringing up the strength of the Jask detachment to about one hundred. The Persian Agent, who was sent to Jask last December, not only corroborated all the sinister reports which had reached the Shah^s ears, but drawing on a naturally fertile imagin ation, considerably improved on them. He represented the Baluch tribes as having thrown off their allegiance, the English as exercising sovereign rights, and eventually reported having recovered seventeen townships for the Persian Government, for which imaginary exploits he was rewarded. The Malek-et-Tujar of Bushire was next deputed by the Persian Minister to Jask in the Persian Government ship Persejoolis, it being thought that an official of his standing would furnish more faithful reports. This, however, was a mistake, as the Malek-et-Tujar on the whole confirmed the reports of his subordinate, and, in order to make a tangible impression, seized Mir Abdul Nubbi and Mir Ali, the two principal Shaikhs of Jask, and carried them in chains to Bushire. The former of these Chiefs, Mir Abdul Nubbi, was actually the Local Governor of the Biaban district, a man of character and energy, who had been usually troublesome to the British officials of Jask. The other, Mir Ali, is an old man of eighty years, quiet, inoffensive, and of the best Baluch family of the district. Neither of these persons had been guilty of any disloyalty to Persia, or committed any offence to deserve the treatment they received, but they were receiving British pay, and it suited the agitators to represent them as traitors and malefactors. These, with other prisoners, were subsequently sent heavily chained from Bushire to Teheran, any intercession of British authority in their behalf being considered only likely to corroborate the suspicions entertained. . Tii e general question of the position of the British at Jask having been discussed by Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires at Teheran, a satisfactory arrangement was come to by which the Telegraph Department are assigned liberal limits. There was of course never any question of denying the right of the Persian Government to establish a Government and Custom House at Jask, nor of maintaining a military guard there against their wish. It was arranged accordingly that the Persian Government Agent should establish himself outside the telegraph limits, and that the military guard should be withdrawn. 0 Mirza Nasrullah, the First Agent, was recalled, and Mirza Hedayet appointed in his stead. 8.—SLAVE TRADE. Four Majesty's ships, viz., Reindeer, WoodlarJc, Kingfisher, ^ Sphinx were en gaged from 25th April 1886 until 18th June m the spring operations against slavers from the Atncan coast.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-87. 11 About 200 dhows were met with and boarded, but only one vessel was found carrying, slaves. This dhow, which had twenty-one slaves on board, was captured by Her Majesty's Ship Woodlarh on 16th June. Most of the dhows examined were found to be in ballast, and accounted for this by saying that they had landed their cargoes further south at Socotra, Makallah, &amp;c. This was probably the truth, and 'it is more than probable that in many instances the cargoes consisted chiefly of slaves. There can be no doubt that a large number of slaves were shipped from the coast of Africa during the year, and, by means not fully, ascertained, a considerable number reached the Batinah coast and other parts of Oman. Her Majesty's ships Woodlarh and Kingfisher cruised from July to 28th October, when operations ceased. An extensive ' khor ' or creek was discovered by Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher near the village of Sowaih-Beni-bu-Ali. 9. OFFICIAL APPOINTMENTS AND NAVAL ESTABLISHMENT. Lieutenant-Colonel S. B. Miles held charge of the Residency during the first half of the official year, and was relieved by Colonel E. C. Ross on 30th October. Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler acted as First Assistant Resident from 1st November to 16th January, when Mr. P. J. C. Robertson relieved him. Her Majesty's ships served on the station as follows :— Her Majesty's ship Reindeer joined the station 30th August 1885 and left 2nd June 1886. Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher joined 26th April 1886, proceeded to Bombay 7th July, and returned to Persian Gulf station 10th August. Her Majesty's ship Sphinx joined. the station 8th May, proceeded to give leave 1st August and returned 6th September. Proceeded to Bombay to recommission on 5th March 1887, and has since returned to the station. Her Majesty's ship Woodlark joined 2nd June and left 11th December. Her Majesty's ship Osprey joined 25th January. Captain Rainier, Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher&gt; was senior naval officer until he left in April on promotion, and the duties of senior officer devolved on Captain Gissing of Her Majesty's ship Osprey. Rear Admiral Sir F. Richards, K.C.B., visited Muscat and the Persian Gulf in April, and was received with due courtesy and attention by the Muscat and Persian authorities. 10.—OBSERVATORY—CLIMATE. The usual observations have been recorded, and the results are shown in the annexed tables. The rainfall of 1886-87 has been very scant, but the harvest will probably be equal to that of the previous year, which was at the last much damaged by u rust.' The ' Barih ' shemal blew from May to 10th July, after which extreme heat was expe rienced for about one month. The winter was very fine and few heavy gales blew, but the autumn and early winter season was sickly in Bushire, and rate of mortality unusually high. CELEBRATION OF HER MAJESTY'S JUBILEE YEAR. In accordance with orders received from the Government of India, Her Majesty s Jubilee was celebrated in the Persian Gulf and at Muscat on 16th February by illuminations and ceremonial observances. The enthusiasm displayed by all classes on the occasion was gratify ing, and in many cases Arab and Persian subjects joined in testifying their hearty good-will. v b1RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-87. 19 PART 11. ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1886-87. political. —At the commencement o£ the official year, affairs in the Sharkiyeh were in a somewhat t disturbed state and in other parts of the country there were various small matters requiring adjustment. In April—Muhammad and Marash, sons of Nasir-bin-Seif, former Shaikh of the Beni Riam, were put to death by their uncle Suleiman-bin-Seif at Nezwa, he fearing that they would wrest from him the Shaikhdom; the other two sons made their escape. In May—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee received the present of a steamer, the S. S. Sultanee from his brother, the Sultan of Zanzibar. Muhammad-bin-Shinas Shaikh of the Beni Battash, was seized on his entering Muscat and put to death by order of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee j he is said to have been a turbulent character, and his tribe had for some time past been giving trouble. Muhammad-bin-Adi was the nominated Shaikh by the Sultan. In June—The Al-bu-Saeedees living at Heil Ghaf came into Muscat, fearing reprisals by the Beni Battash on account of the death of Muhammad-bin-Shinas. In July—On the I3th instant His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was presented at a Darbar held in his palace with the Insignia of a Gr.C.S.L, conferred on His Highness by Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen-Empress by Colonel Miles, Acting Resident in the Persian Gulf; and on the same occasion a promise of active support from the British Government to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee during his lifetime against unprovoked aggression was announced to His Highness. Most of the principal Chiefs of Oman were present at the Darbar, but his brother, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, to whom an invitation had been sent, after accepting it and coming to within a few miles of Muscat, demanded a guarantee of safety from the British Political Agent in addition to that already given him by the Sultan, which was refused and he returned to Semed without attending the Darbar ; his people killed three Siabiyeen on their way back, and the Siyabiyeen a few days after killed three Shibul in retaliation. On the 28th instant His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, accompanied by his son Seyyid Muhammad, started for a trip into the interior and was absent for a week. His Highness had not visited the interior for many years. In August—A dispute arose between the Awamir and Beni Jabir which resulted in loss of life, and appeared likely to lead to much trouble. Shaikh A.bdullah-bin-Salim, formerly Temee- meh of the Beni-bu-Ali, came to Muscat with a large following on a visit to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. In September—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee, accompanied by his sons, Seyyids Faysal and Fahd, visited Kuriyat and Soor in the S. S. Sultanee and was absent a week. At Soor His Highness deputed Suleiman-bin-Sweilim to effect a truce between the Hijveen and the Beni-bu-Ali and Hishm, in which he was successful. It was reported that the Hinaweens had determined to rise, with the object of establishing the Sultan's brother, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, at Soor, or making war on the Ghafree tribes of Jaalan; it was also reported that Seyyid Abdul Aziz had gone with a party of the Haboos to the Beni Battash country. The Beni Battash attacked the fort of Kuryat, but were repulsed with loss; they looted the store-rooms of a Bania of about &lt;$250 worth of goods. Reinforcements were sent to Kuryat under command of Seyyid Bede-bin-Seif. Shaikh Rashid-bin-Ali Murrab Aamaree, formerly 'Wali at Gwadur, was killed at Seeb by a man of the Zakawanee tribe named Seif-bin-Hamad whom he also killed. At the end of the month letters were received from Salim-bin-Hassan at Rahabee, stating that Saleh-bin-Ali had sent a messenger to him demanding passage through the Kahaza pass for the Hinawees who had determined to attack Muscat. In October—The truce which His Highness Seyyid Toorkee had proposed to the Shar kiyeh tribes, was in danger of being rendered impossible at the outset, through an attack by some of the Beni-bu-Ali on a village of the Hijreeen in which two slaves of the Hijreeen and an Aamaree were killed; the difficulty was, however, got over. The Beni Battash having become divided in their Councils, Seyyid Abdul Aziz, who had gone to their assistance with some of the Haboos, left their country, and on the 13th instant letters were received by the cl20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Wazir, Seyyid Saeed-bin-Muhammad, and otliers from Seyyid ALdul Aziz^ who was then at Hajar, demanding an interview with them under threat of destroying their date-groves at that place. The S. S. Sultanee was at once despatched to Kuryat to bring the forces collected there to Muscat, which having arrived on the following day, and being augmented to a total to 700 men from Muscat and Muttrah they started at once for Hajar j at Karahee they were opposed by a small advanced party of Seyyid Abdul Aziz's followers whom they routed, but not following up their success sufficiently quickly, Seyyid Abdul Aziz made good his escape to Semed, and the force returned the following day; this operation, though not as successful as it might have been, was of value to the Sultan's prestige. Three days later a force of some 1,200 men, which was subsequently augmented with 25 horses and one gun, were sent by sea to Kuryat under command of Seyyid Eede-bin-Seif and the Sultan's sons to coerce the Beni Battash. On the 23rd instant news was received that the force had been opposed by the Beni Battash at Mizfah who had been routed with a loss of seven men. The force subsequently destroyed the town of Mizfah and razed Mazara, the principal fort of the Beni Battash, who tendered their submission and offered to pay a fine of |10,000. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee sent a present of six horses to Her Majesty the Queen-Empress. In November—The force sent against the Beni Battash returned bringing with them the Shaikh Adi-bin-Nasir and six others, who were immediately on arrival imprisoned until the fine should be paid; they were subsequently released on payment of $4,000. A threatened collision between the tribes of the Batineh and Dhahireh averted by the mediation of the Howasineh and Abbu-Rashid. In December—His Highness Seyyid Toorkee sent seventeen horses, a number of camels and other presents to his brother, the Sultan of Zanzibar. Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Suleiman walad Fana Al-bu-Saeedee deputed to Dhofar as Wali with him Seyyid Abdul Jalil-al-Zawawee and seventy men. A disturbance occurred in the Jaalan between the Jenebeh and other tribes in which three men we're killed. In January 1887—Two serious raids by the Awamir, Beni Kattab and other tribes of the Dhahireh in the vicinity of Shinas and Sohar, in which they committed much depredations and Caused some loss to British subjects, which was however subsequently made good by His Hio-h- ness Seyyid Toorkee. Seyyid Hamad-bin-Ham ad Wad Samar, appointed Wali of Sohar in place of Seyyid Hamad-bin-Nasir recalled. Death of Seif-bin-Hamad Temimeh of the Jenebeh re ported to have occurred at Aden, and his son Nasir elected in his place. One of the murderers of the Shaikh of Eas-al-Had was killed by relations of the Shaikh. Three of the Beni Hina killed at Khoth by Siabiyeen. In February—Two men killed at Beeren, and a slave carried off by Beni Sheheyn. Death of Muhammad-bin-Ali, Shaikh of the Naeen, reported. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee held a grand Darbar in honour of the Jubilee of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress, at which a letter from His Excellency the Viceroy of India to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was read by the Political Agent. A salute of 101 guns was fired from the forts, and at night the town was illuminated and fireworks let off. S. S. Sultanee sent to Sohar with gunpowder and money, a raid by the Bedouins being reported by the Wali as impending. Yaarab-bin-Kahtan, Wali of Shinas died, and was succeeded by his son. Kahtan-bin-Yaarab Seyyid Suleiman-bin-Hamad appointed Wah of Khabooreh. Letters received from new Wali of Dhofar that he had taken charge of the district. In March—Shaikh Musalim-bin-Bedwi, former Wali of Sohar, imprisoned on arrival at Muscat for having refused to deliver up the torts for three days. Party of the Beni Kattab on their way to raid in. vicinity of Sohar dispersed by the new Wali. A Persian Seyyid ran ''amuck/' at Muttrah, and was shot by the Wahabi soldiers after he had killed two Baluch- a Wahabi soldier had wounded the Wall's son. Beni-bu-Ali tribe in Jaalan reported to have quarrelled amongst themselves. Shaikhs of the Beni-bu-Hassan from Jaalan came to Muscat on a visit to His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. Bear Admiral Sir F. Richards, Commander-in-Chief, Indian Station, visited Muscat in April in H. M. s S. Sphnx on his way up to the Persian Gulf, and called in again in May when re- turning. His Excellency also visited Muscat in H. M.'s S. Baodantein November on his way trom Aden to Bombay. In April 1886—Lieutenant-Colonel Miles, on being appointed Acting Resident in the Per- Official changes. s ^ an vue Colonel Ross, C.S.I., appointed Acting Resi- , . , „ . , , dent at Hytoatad, Deccan, made over charge of the Politi cal Agency and Consulate at Muscat to Lieutenant-Colonel Mockler, and resumed charge in r^iovember or the same year. °RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1886-87. 21 Mr. Louis Maguire o£ Messrs.

In the report for year 1885 it was stated that owing to partial failure of the grain crops, and consequent scarcity, trade generally had been much injured and depressed in South Persia, and its recovery or otherwise would depend greatly on the harvest of 1886, the prospects of which were, when the report was written,* favourable. i. e. } in March 1886. Notwithstanding a good average rainfall of 15^ inches, there was again a partial failure of the crops, especially in the Shiraz districts, and the result of this has been a further depression of trade which was increased by the unfavourable rates of eKchange. The year under review has accordingly been most unfavourable, and in no previous year has so unsettled a feeling and so much want of confidence prevailed. The consuming classes have been impoverished from high prices of food, and are unable to purchase other articles of import to the customary extent. Many of the smaller Persian merchants have failed. And all who have continued to transact business have had to do so without reckoning on profits, and what with depressed markets and decreased confidence, no headway has been made. The prospects for 1887 are still uncertain; the rain came late and has been partial only, but reports from Shiraz districts are not unfavourable. Exports» During the early part of 1885 shipments of wheat were permitted and made, but the quantity was limited to a few hundred tons. The quality was very good; the prices of grain were during this period so low as to allow a profit even on the low prices ruling in Europe. After the hot weather prices rose, and in September embargo was placed on exportation of grain which continues in force. The opium crop was about equal to that of the previous year, but the China and London markets were very bad, and there was no demand until Sep. Opium. j i t ember. The tobacco crop was smaller than usual, owing to its being injured by frost in winter, and prices were correspondingly high. Tobacco is an im portant export of Persia, and the trade has attracted attention f Note.—it is understood this project of late. The Persian Government have decided to institute a is abaudoned. regief for Persian tobacco under the control of the Amin-es- Sultan, now head of the whole of the customs of Persia. It is thought that this measure will unfavourably affect the trade. The decline of the import trade in cotton goods would have been still greater than it ,, , , actually was, had it been governed by the law of profits. A Manchester goods. , i-n j- -.i t • • i. decrease cnietiy occurred m printed goods. It was in point of fact impossible to import from Europe at a profit, and importers lost heavily, many native speculators of small means having failed. There was a steady decline of other leading articles, such as metals and sugar. The com- , , petition between French and German susrar continues, and it Metals and sugar. t , , r. . is generally expected that the former will gam the market. Large imports of Marseilles loaf sugar were made, but markets owing to the impoverishment of the people are overstocked and holders of stocks apprehended loss. The French line of steamers resumed running, but the number is reduced to two, and these are under the management of an English firm. Freights from England to the Persian Gulf and Busrah remained unaltered. But in Freights. consequence of keen competition homeward freights fell to 16«. per ton to England and R6 to Jeddah. Towards the end of the year freights recovered somewhat, and are expected to keep firm for the present.REPORT ON THE ADMINISTRATION of the // j Y c »i« » fop ■! r j PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL RESIDENCY and MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY for 1887-88.

ROSS, Colonel, Political Resident, Fersian Gulf,administeation eeport of the PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and muscat political agency for 1887-88. P art I.-GENEEAL SUMMAEY. I.—MUSCAT STATE. 1. The Political Agency at Muscat continued during' the year under review to be under Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler, but owing 1 to the deputation of that officer on special duty to Baghdad, and his subsequently obtaining privilege leave^ the annual report of the Agency has been drawn up by Surgeon-Major A. S. Jayakar. 2. It will be observed by those who may'peruse this report that a very dangerous combi nation against the Sultan was nipped in the bud and entirely frustrated by the rapid and decided action taken by the Political Agent, Colonel Mockler, and myself, with the sanction of the Government of India, on the occasicn of the capture of Soweyk by Seyyid Ibrahim-bin Kais. The speedy settlement of this matter had a very beneficial result. In acknowledging the detailed report on the subject, the Secretary to Government conveyed the satisfaction of Government in the following terms : a I am to inform you that your proceedings in this matter are approved by the Government of India.' 2.—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. 3. The petty independent States situated on the north-western coast of 'Oman, with which we have intimate relations, arising from treaty engagements in connection with the maintenance of peace and order on the seas, are six in number :— (1) Ras-el-Khaimah, ruled by Shaikh Hameyd bin 'Abdullah, who belongs to the tribe El- Kowasim, commonly pronounced Jowasim. This tribal patronymic is derived from an ancestor named Kasim, whence Kasimi the adjective form, and the collective plural El-Kowasim. The substitution of J for K is a local vulgarism widely employed. The Jowasim have been a powerful tribe in their day, and are now to be found on the Persian mainland about Lingah, where they enjoyed a position of much consideration. Up to the year 1887 the position of Deputy Governor of Lingah was virtually hereditary in the family. Umm-ul-Kawain [Vulg: Gawain, said to be of semi-Arabic, semi-Persian derivation) has for Chief Shaikh Ahmed bin 'Abdullah of the tribe Al-bu-Ali. (3) 'Ajman, under Shaikh Rashid-bin Hameyd, also of the Al-bu-Ali. (4) Shargah (more correctly Sharkah) under the Kowasimi Shaikh Sakar bin Khalid. (5) Delay, ruled by Shaikh. Rashid bin Maktoom, of the tribe Al-bu-Falasah, which is cognate with the greater Beni-Yas. (6) Ahu-Dhelhi, under Shaikh Za'eed bin Khaleefah, Chief of all the Beni-Yas, and the most powerful and influential of the ' Trucial' Chiefs of 'Oman. 4. The several Chiefs, on the whole, gave satisfaction as regards their engagements to Government, and the only troublesome case which occurred was the plunder of some boats,6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL which were lying at anehor in the sheltered bunders o£ Hasiyan, Ghantoot, and Ghanadhir, by Bedouin Arabs, who swam off and attacked the vessels from the shore. Two of the boats which were plundered in the Bunders of Hasiyan and Ghantoot belonged to subjects of the Chief of Shargahj and the third, plundered in Khor Ghanadhir, belonged to Ras-el-Khaimah. The assailants were said to be Bedouins of the Monasir tribe, and from the fact of the places named being admittedly situated within the strip of coast nominally under the Chief of Abu Dbabbi, it was a question whether Shaikh Za'eed should not be held responsible for the outrages. It was alleged that the Monasir tribe are amenable to the authority of the Beni-Yas Chief, and that if he chose to exert himself he could exact reparation for the outrages referred to. The point was a nice one in itself, but I felt that it should not be considered solely on its merits, but that the general political situation and contemporary occurrences in other parts of the Persian Gulf should be kept in view. It has not appeared to me clearly established that the Monasir, who were accused of the outrage, are really subject to the authority and control of Shaikh Za'eed, and it must be borne in mind that similar robberies have been frequently happen ing in places under the authority of the Turkish Government, without any attempt at redress. It has appeared to me that it would be impolitic, in these circumstances, if not unfair, to adopt a harsh course towards the Chief of Abu-Dhabbi in this matter. Beyond an appeal to his pride and sense of justice no further action has been taken. 5. The ' Trucial' Chiefs remained at peace one with another during the year, but Shaikh Za^eed of Abu-Dhabbi, was, in May 1887, engaged in hostilities against a section of the Dhowa- hir tribe of Bereymi, who had opposed themselves to his influence at that place. The Beni- Yas Chief was victorious and returned to Abu Dhabbi in May, bringing with him as prisouers Shaikh Sa'eed Bin Ali and another Shaikh of the Dhowahir tribe. 6. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee endeavoured to send succour to the Dhowahir in the shape of money and ammunition, but his action was taken too late in the day. 7. In the month of September a band of marauders of the Monasir tribe made a raid in the vicinity of Shargah, and carried off eight women and children and several camels and horses. 8. The year 1887-88 was remarkable, inter alia, for the activity of certain officials and agents of the Persian Government in the Persian Gulf, and it became apparent from observation of the proceedings of these agents that an extension of Persian influence, at the expense of Bri tish naval preponderance, was in contemplation. The phenomena inducing this conclusion, so far as affecting the 'Oman coast, have now to be noticed, and the steps taken in consequence to be described. 9. In the month of August, whilst engaged in dealmg with troublesome disorders in the vicinity of Bahrain, I received information that the Persian Sirtip (General) Haji Ahmed Khan was about to visit Abu Dhabbi and other places on the Pirate coast in the Bombay and Persian Gulf Steam Navigation Company's steamer Calder. Considering the expense entailed by this trip, and the season of the year at which it was undertaken, I suspected that the object in view was not, as given out, merely to pay a friendly visit to old friends, but must be of a more serious and important nature. The Residency steamer Lawrence was despatched with the First Assistant Resident to Abu-Dhabi to observe the movements of the Sirtip, and to endeavour to ascertain his purpose. It appeared that Haji Ahmed Khan landed at Abu-Dhabi in full uniform and remained with the Chief a few days, after which he went to Debay, whence he again returned to Abu-Dhabi and finally sailed in a native vessel to Lingah. 10. The precise nature of Haji Ahmed's communication to the 'Oman Chiefs was not ascer tained at the time, the Haji having obtained promises that they would not divulge them to the British authorities. The Chief of Debay however, whilst adhering to his promise literally^ considered himself free to inform the Sultan of Muscat of Haji Ahmed's proposals, which were framed with a view to the establishment of close political relations between the independent Chiefs of'Oman and the Persian Government, to the exclusion of the present predominance of British influence. In whatever quarter the idea originated, it is certain that those who are now entrusted with the reins of power and practically direct the policy of the Persian Government, have nourished an ambitious dream of replacing British by Persian supremacy over the shores and islands round the Persian Gulf. The action of certain local Persian authorities, including Haji Ahmed, was calculated to arouse suspicion of some such scheme being afloat, and attention once drawn to these proceedings, observation served to establish the correctness of the surmise, after which the proceedings of the Persian agents at first puzzling, became intelligible, and acquired a meaning and an interest. In the circumstances I deemed it prudent and advisable in order to safeguard our position in relation to the Trucial Arab Chiefs of 'Oman, as well as to impress on their minds their own obligations to the British Government, to obtain from thoseRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 7 chiefs written assurances of their intention of maintaining the existing status, which it was the object of Persian intrigue to disturb. Accordingly all the six chiefs, mentioned at the com mencement of this section, addressed to me letters containing assurances to the British Govern ment that they would neither correspond with, nor form engagements with, any other Foreign Governments, and would not, without assent of the British Government, consent to admit to reside in their territories, agents of any Government but the British. 11. In January last .Sirtip Haji Ahmed Khan, having supplied himself with a number of Persian Government flags left Bushire on a special mission. On this occasion the Sirtip pro ceeded in a native vessel to a place on the promontory called Kas-el-Bibal, or Cape Musendim and desired to land, but was warned off by the Arab inhabitants. Subsequently, accompanied by the Shaikh of Kishm and some armed men, he visited Umm-ul-Kawain, causing much excite ment amongst the Arabs of that coast. Haji Ahmed gave out that his object in visiting 'Oman again was of a personal nature, but his real purpose was no secret. He was utterly unsuccess ful and returned in disappointment to Bunder Abbas. The Persian Minister, under whose orders the Sirtip was acting, on being questioned by Her Majesty's Charge d'Affaires, promptly and positively disavowed all knowledge of the Sirtip's proceedings, and volunteered to reprimand him for his action. The Arabs of the Pirate Coast, being considerably fluttered by Haji Ahmed's appearance and conduct, were informed by the Commander of Her Majesty's Ship Osprey, which vessel was despatched for the purpose to the coast, that the Persian Government had disavowed and disapproved Haji Ahmed's proceedings. The presence of the Osprey and the disclaimer of the Persian Government bad a re-assuring effect on the minds of the Arabs of the Pirate Coast. It may be mentioned that Sirtip Haji Ahmed was subsequently presented with a sword of honour by order of the Persian Minister. 12. In the month of September, the Residency Agent at Lingah reported that Haji Ahmed Khan Sirtip had sent a small party under Shaikh Hasan, the Chief of Kishm, to the island of Sirri with orders to erect a flagstaff and hoist the Persian flag thereon, and Her Majesty's Ship Banger reported that the Persian flag was flying on the island in question. 13. The Islands of Tamb, Sirri and Bu-Musa, situated midway between the Persian and 'Oman Coast, have been for generations hereditary possessions of the Jowasim Arabs, those of the tribe who settled on the Persian Coast, having always iDeen admitted to share in the rights attaching to these tribal possessions. The island of Sirri has been hitherto superintended by the principal Jowasimi Shaikh of Lingah, who has been usually Deputy Governor of that port and district under the Persian Government. l^. It was always understood that the Jowasimi Shaiks of Lingah administered the island of Sirri in virtue of their position as Shaiks of the Jowasimi tribe, not in consequence of their office of Deputy Governor of a Persian district. The hoisting of the Persian flag at Sirri, therefore, constituted a complete alteration of the status as regards that island, and the Arab Chief of Shargah lodged a protest and remonstrance against what he considered annexation by Persia of an Arab possession. The whole question was referred to Her Majesty's legation at Tehran and has continued to be the subject of diplomatic correspondence. 3.—EL-BAHRAIN. 15. The Islands of Bahrain did not wholly escape from the disquieting influence at work in the Persian Gulf during the year under review. 16. Owing to the attitude assumed by the Chief of El-Bidaa, Shaikh Jasim bin Mahom- med bin Thani, and the virtual encouragement given by him to his turbulent dependents of El-Katr, cases of piracy commenced to occur off that Coast in the month of July, chiefly on vessels belonging to Bahrain. Simultaneously the Beni Hajir robbers, who have been so long the pest of the seas and coast adjacent to Bahrain, recommenced their depredations on Bahrain vessels in the waters about El-Kateef, within the jurisdiction of the Turkish authori ties. For years bands of Beni Hajir robbers, harbouring chiefly in the districts under Turkish territory, have preyed on the native craft plying between Bahrain and El-Kateef, occasionally extending their operations further to the eastward, always hitherto with entire impunity. ' Armati mare exercent, semperque recentes juvant praedas, et vivere rapto' ' armed they harass the sea, ever delighting in fresh robberies, and living on the spoil.' 17. During the past summer the policy at first adopted by Shaikh Jasim encouraged bands of these marauders to sally out to sea from the Katr Coast, as well as from the recognised Turkish territory, and the matter became serious. About half a dozen piracies were reported off the Katr Coast and as many more in the Turkish waters. The latter cases were reported to the Turkish authorities through the* British representative in Turkish Arabia,8 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL and although it needs not saying that no redress or compensation was obtained, still the persistent remonstrances of the Ambassador at the Porte eventually stimulated the Turkish Government to sbow some signs of activity, thougb not in the precise direction or manner desired, and hitherto with no good result. 18. As regards tbe piracies occurring off El-Katr, it appeared necessary to adopt some more direct measures in order to check the progress of those disorders. The Chief of Bahrain, Shaikh Esau bin Ali, in August addressed me a letter complaining of the injuries and losses suffered by his subjects from these piracies, and begging for protection and enforcement of security by sea, failing wbich he asked to be allowed a free hand to avenge himself on the robbers. 19. In the month of July, during my visit to Muscat and the Batineh Coast, I had deputed Khan Bahadur A. R. Hakim to El-Bidaa, in Her Majesty' Ship Sphinx, to make certain inquiries into the conduct of Shaikh Jasim, and on my return, having received Mr. Hakim's report, I decided to despatch the First Assistant Resident in the Residency steamer Lawrence to El-Bidaa, with orders to remove thence all British Indian subjects, and to warn Shaikh Jasim I would hold him responsible for disorders and outrages occurring within, or by persons issuing from his district. 20. I also requested the senior naval officer to keep one vessel of war stationed at Bahrain. 21. On receiving the full reports of the investigations conducted by the First Assistant and the Native Agents on the Katr Coast and Bahrain, it appeared to me obvious that the outrages and disorders which had occurred were the result of the attitude of Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thani, who, for his own purposes, had desired and brought to pass the unset tled state of affairs on land and on sea, and it appeared to me highly necessary, firstly that some decided action should be taken to restore confidence, and, secondly, that such action should touch Shaikh Jasim's personal interests, otherwise it would be ineffectual. 2'Z. On the 17th of August I proceeded to Bahrain in the Lawrence in order to consult the Chief and concert measures. Having received information that certain specie and pearls, to the value of some S20,000, was then in Bahrain, 1 asked the Chief if he would be willing to lay an embargo on the consignment at my requisition. The Chief immediately assented, and the property was formally sequestrated, and the First Assistant proceeded in Lawrence to El- Bidaa, and informed Shaikh Jasim of this measure, and my reasons for taking it. 23. As soon as Shaikh Jasim realised that unpleasant consequences to himself were likely to ensue from the disorders he had encouraged, he bestirred himself, and in a short time the piracies were stopped and order restored. 24. Eventually Shaikh Jasim appointed an Agent (his son-in-law) with powers to con clude terms with an Agent appointed by me for the settlement of British and Bahrain complaints against him. A sum of Rs. 6,390^ having been paid by Jasim's Agent in compen sation to the British Indian and Bahrain sufferers from piracies and other outrages committed by Shaikh Jasim's dependants, his property under sequestration was released, and he was informed that the previously existing friendly relations would be resumed. These proceedings were approved by the Government of India. 25 The islands of Bahrain have from time to time been claimed or coveted by the more powerful Muhammadan powers having possessions and interests in the Gulf, whether Turkey, Persia, or Muscat. During the past year the Turkish claim to sovereignty was openly renewed, whilst designs against the independence of the islands were harboured by Agents of the Persian Government, designs which, had opportunity been afforded, would doubtless have been put into execution. 26. In November the Mutaserrif, or Governor, of El-Hasa addressed the Chief of Bahrain in reference to the detention of Shaikh Jasim's property, and, asserting in this communication that Bahrain is a portion of the Turkish province of Nejd and Hasa, desired him to produce any ' sanad ' from the Turkish Government he might hold exempting Bahrain from the juris diction of the Government of El-Hasa. The Chief of Bahrain was advised to refrain from replying to this communication. 27. Mr. Robertson, having subsequently shewn to His Excellency Nafiz Pasha, Wali of Busrah, the letter of the Mutaserrif above referred to. His Excellency disavowed the action of the Mutaserrif, but upheld the latter's views as regards Turkish suzerainty over Bahrain. Later, the Wali wrote to Mr. Robertson distinctly claiming the islands of Bahrain as Turkish territory.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 9 28. It was somewhat to be feared that His Excellency, a bold, capable, and influential Governor, would take steps to give effect to his views, and it was considered prudent to keep vessels of the Royal Navy constantly at Bahrain during the winter and spring. 29. The most curious communication perhaps in this connection was a letter addressed by Muhammad Salih Pasha, the Turkish Governor of El-Hasa, to the Chief of Bahrain in January, in which the Chief was informed that orders had been received from the Governor of Busrah in which it was ruled that the proper name of the island of Bahrain was ' Awal/' and that after receipt of this communication the Chief of Bahrain must notify to all persons under his authority that the islands were on no account to be otherwise designated. 30. It appears that the Turkish authorities have been shewn some ancient maps (such as Niebuhr's), on which the name 'Bahrain' is shewn as co-extensive with El-Hasa, and the Turks propose to revive this supposed ancient application of the name to the province of Hasa, in order to strengthen their theory that the occupation of El-Hasa constructively carried with it a right of sovereignty over the islands of Bahrain. 81. ' Awal/'it may be here explained, is the distinctive name of the largest Bahrain ~ /— \ tlt * ^ v . /ox ^ o island, and the word is by some authorities* considered as * (1) Niebuhr. (2) V. Sprenger. , . , £ ^ * i n r. i j i i denvea trom an Arab conqueror, Awal-]bn-ltabee ah, by others from the name of an idol worshipped by the tribes 'Bekr' and 'Taghlib,' of which idol there may have been a sanctuary or temple in Bahrain. 32. The Chief of Bahrain, having consulted me regarding this communication, was recom mended to take no notice of it, and it is probable Muhammad Salih Pasha had exceeded his instructions in addressing Shaikh Esau on this subject. 33. On the 19th February, His Excellency Nafiz Pasha, Wali of Busrah, appeared off Bahrain in the Turkish corvette Zohnff and anchored for one night. No communication was held with the shore and the vessel proceeded to the Katr Coast the following day and did not again visit Bahrain. 34. The attempted intrigues of certain Persian Agents with respect to Bahrain were of a more secret nature, and I refrain from describing them here. 4.—EL-KATR. 35. Circumstances combine to render our relations and dealings with the chief Arab authority residing on the Katr Coast peculiarly unsatisfactory and delicate. In the first place the Chief referred to. Shaikh Jasim bin Muhammad bin Thani, who is regarded by the British Government as an independent Arab Shaikh, to a certain extent bound to respect the regu lations for maintenance of peace by sea, is by character and disposition a most troublesome person to deal with. Secondly, he usually avows himself a subject and officer of the Turkish Government, which has appointed him Kaim-Makam,' or Deputy Governor, of El-Katr. Like the notorious Shaikh Muhammad bin Khalifah of Bahrain, Shaikh Jasim has coquetted in turn with the various powers in his neighbourhood, according to the whim of the moment, or pressure of circumstances. 36. In the summer of 1887 Shaikh Jasim appeared to be much dissatisfied with his Turkish patrons and their proceedings, and intimated that he had withdrawn from El-Bidaa, and taken up his residence at a place called Dha^ayen, near Semeysamah, and exercised no further authority in El-Bidaa. 37. It soon appeared, however, that there was no sincerity in this statement, as Shaikh Jasim, through his sons and relatives, continued to exercise a baneful influence over the affairs of El-Bidaa, which eventually culminated in disturbances and outrages. 38. Shaikh Jasim, weary of the interference of Turkish officials, and alarmed at a proposal to establish a custom-house at El-Bidaa, was anxious to diminish the importance of the port and, with that end in view, planned to get rid of all the foreign traders, British Indian and Persian, hoping by this means to eventually rid himself of the presence of a Turkish guard and Turkish officials. 39. At the given signal the Bedouin Arabs of the vicinity entered the bazaar of El-Bidaa and plundered the shops of the Persian dealers residing there, driving them all from the place. The British Indian traders on this occasion were protected by Shaikh Jasim's relatives, but their turn was to come. 40. In the month of August two Indian traders were wantonly and cruelly wounded by the Bedouins in El-Bidaa, and immediately afterwards piracies commenced off the coast of Katr. B10 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 41. In the summary of Bahrain affairs .t has been stated how these disorders were eventually checked, and it is only necessary here to remark that compensat.on to the wounded Indians was included in the amount levied from Shaikh Jasim. . . 42 No redress has been obtained by the Persians for the losses sustained by them daring the plunder of Bl-Bidaa, when all the Persian traders were forced to remove from the place; but an appeal on the subject was made by the Persian to the Turkish Government. 43 The first wish of Shaikh Jasim's heart is probably to be rid of the Turks altogether, and if it were possible to restore him to a position of independence he would doubtless 1* readily amenable to British influence. But the course o events dunng the past year has tun in the opposite direction, the tendency being for the Turkish grasp on El-Bidaa to t.ghte D rather than relax- . 7 /* • , The Wali of Busrah, Nafiz Pasha, visited El-Bidaa in the corvette Zohaff m the mouth of February and promised Shaikh Jasim a title and decorations. A supplyofcoal also has been sent to El-Bidaa by the Turkish authorities, and the Turkish guard at that place 18 about to be strengthened. 45. The usual petty and desultory warfare has occasionally been kept np between Shaikh Jasim's adherents in El-Katr and the Monasir and other Bedouins of the border land of Oman. 5.—NEJD AND EL-HASA. 46 Subordinate to the Turkish 'Wilayet' of Busrah is the somewhat pretentiously termed Government of ' Nejd.' The Mutasernf holding Ne j d - this post has his head-quarters at Hoofoof, the capital of El- Hasa, and his charge is really restricted to the province bearing the latter name. To the westward between El-Hasa and Nejd (or the 'uplands') intervene the 'Dahna' or ' Nafood ' the great red sand dunes, and at present these mark the limit of Turkish authority. To the north-west of Eiadh, the capital of Central Nejd, is the flourishing province of 'the mountain,' Jebel Shammer, ruled by Muhammad ibn Bashed, who more or less owns alle- giance to Turkey. The Wahabee Amirs of Riadh have long been weakened by family dis- sensions and isolation from the seaboard owing to the Turkish occupation of El-Hasa. 47. Up to last year, Abdullah bin Feysal was recognised as Amir, or head of the Al- Su'ood family, but his authority was limited to Riadh itself. 48. Last autumn intelligence was received that his nephews, the sons of Su'ood bin Feysal, had seized and imprisoned Abdullah, and there were rumours of an intended assem- blage of tribes in view to an attack on the Turks in El-Hasa, 49. Letters were written by Muhammad bin Su'ood to the Chief of Bahrain and to the various Arab Shaikhs of 'Oman, announcing his accession as Amir of Nejd. But the triumph of Muhammad bin Su'ood was short-lived, for the more powerful Amir of Jebel Shammer, Muhammad bin Rashed, speedily marched against him up to the gates of Riadh, which place capitulated after a short defence. Abdullah bin Feysal was then released and re-instated, and Muhammad bin Su'ood retired to El-khorj. It seems, however, to have been arranged that Abdullah should accompany Muhammad bin Rashed back to Jebel Shammer, his younger brother Muhammad bin Feysal acting as Governor of Nejd, assisted by an Agent of Ibn Rashed. 50. Thus, the authority of Muhammad bin Rashed has apparently been extended over a large portion of Central Arabia, and is now supreme from the confines of Syria to the great red sand desert east of Nejd. 51. The forces of Ibn Rashed are too formidable and well appointed to allow of any sue- cessful resistance on the part of the adherents of the Wahabi Amirs, and it is of some importance to note that the Shammer Chieftain is, nominally at least, the vassal of Turkey. He at once communicated the news of his victory to the Turkish authorities, by whom it was received with the utmost satisfaction. 52. The Mutaserrif, or Governor, of El-Hasa during the past year was Muhammad Salih Pasha, whose offensive communications to the Chief of El-Hasa. Ba,hrain have been noticed in another place. This Governor has been dismissed and his successor is named Rufa J at Beg. 53. An attempt has been made to establish a commercial port for El-Hasa at a place called Darin, not far from El-Kateef, and to induce steamers to land goods there, thus avoiding transhipment at Bahrain. Owing to the intricacy of the navigation it is doubtful if this project will prove successful.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 11 6.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. 54. Up to the month of February the province of Fars generally continued to be under the supreme control of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan. At Shiraz that Prince s son, the Jelal-ud-Dowlah, was nominally Governor of that town and the dependent districts, the administrator being the Sahib Dewan. Behbahan, Bushire and districts, Lar, Darab, Jehium, &amp;c., remained subordinate to the Central Fars administration, but Lingah and Bunder Abbas, with their dependencies, were separated from the rest of the province of Fars, and entrusted to the supreme control of His Excellency the Amin-es-Sultan, Minister for Home Affaiis, Finance, &amp;c., and virtually the Prime Minister of Persia. 55. In February it was announced that His Royal Highness the Zill-es-Sultan had been deprived of all his governments excepting Ispahan, and orders were received at Shiraz direct ing His Excellency the Sahib Dewan to make over his duties and repair to Tehran with His Royal Highness the Jelal-ud-Dowlah. 56. It appeared that the entire province of Fars had been transferred to the Amin-es- Sultan, who had nominated His Royal Highness the Ihtisham-ud-Dowlah Governor of Shiraz and the central districts of Fars, whilst the seaports and islands were entrusted to Muham mad Hasan Kban, now promoted to the title of Sa^ad-ul-Mulk. 57. iThe outlying districts of Bushire (Dashti, Dashtistan, &amp;c.) have been given to Prince Nowzer Mirza. 58. The districts about Shiraz have been in an unusually unsettled state during the year owinsr to the mismanagement of the Sahib Diwan and of Slliraz ' , • ,1 .. , • , ,yr n his son, the Motemin-uI-Mulk. 59. There was a bitter feud between the Sahib Diwan and his nephew, the Kowwam-ul- Mulk, and in May the Kowwam-ul-Mulk was summoned to Ispahan by the Zil-es-Sultan, and immediately imprisoned. Subsequently he was subjected to detainment merely, and released on payment of a sum of 60,000 tomans. 60. Dissensions also broke out between the Sahib Diwan and his brother Haji Nasir-ul- Mulk, who for a short time held the Governorship of Bushire and its districts. 61. On the fall of the Government of Fars last spring, both Kowwam-ul-Mulk and Nasir- ul-Mulk were taken into favour. The former proceeded to the capital and was made much of and decorated, and eventually returned to Shiraz with the newly appointed Governor His Royal Highness Ihtisham-ud-Dowlah. The Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk became Peshkar, or Minister, for the province, and it is probable that disorders and disturbances will now be everywhere suppressed. 62. In August an Eeliat, Chief of the ' Koti ' Arab Eeliats, named Reza Khan, who had been imprisoned in Shiraz, was rescued in a very daring manner by his relatives with two or three hundred armed sowars. An officer and several of the prison guards were shot down and Reza Khan pulled over the wall by ropes, let down, and carried away clear of the town. Various expeditions were sent to capture Reza Khan, but all were discomfited and returned un successful. He has lately surrendered himself to the Ihtisham-ud-Dowlah and been pardoned. 63. Two pitched battles occurred in Jehroom and Darab districts between Arab and Baharloo tribes, the latter being aided by a battalion of Sirbaz and two guns. These disturb ances were originated by the Motemin-el-Mulk, son of tlie Sahib Eiwan, and about 150 persons were killed on both sides. 64. The Eel-Begi of the Kashgar Darab Khan was in May arrested and taken to Ispahan on a donkey, laden with chains, and subjected to extreme ignominy. After being kept in manacles for some time at Ispahan he was released and presented with a dress of honour. The nature of his offence did not transpire. 65. In December a party of miscreants attacked a clerk of the English telegraph depart ment and his wife close to the wall of Shiraz soon after dusk, and wounded the latter severely. Many arrests were made, but it was very doubtful whether the real culprits were ever reached. The object of the outrage was undoubtedly to discredit the Sahib Diwan and his administration, and attract attention to the misgovernment of the province. Eventually a sum of five thousand kerans was paid to the injured parties as compensation, by no means a satisfactoty termination of the affair. 66. At the commencement of the official year His Excellency Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk was Governor of Bushire and its districts, but he shortly after- Bushire and Districts. wards proceeded to Shiraz, leaving Haider Kooli Khan as his Deputy at Bushire. The latter, who made a favourable impression, was soon after appointed b a12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Deputy Governor of Behbahan, and the current duties of the Bushire Government were there upon, in May, entrusted to Haji Ahmed Khan Sirtip, whose name has figured in preceding sec tions of this report. 67. Owing to the previous yearns scanty harvest, prices rose at Bushire to nearly famine pitch, and the outtying districts were in an unprosperous, consequently an unsettled condi tion. This was aggravated by intrigues conducted from Shiraz, in view to compassing the dismissal of Nasir-ul-Mulk from his position of Governor. 68. In the course of these differences several changes of District Zabits were made, and serious disturbances were at one time apprehended. 69. In July His Excellency Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk returned from Shiraz to Bushire by the Firozabad route, bringing in his train Jemal Khan, Chief of Dashti, and having an escort of 400 sowars and 200 infantry soldiers. 70. The Nasir-ul-Mulk^s stay on the coast was, however, brief. The intrigues of his brother, the Sahib Diwan, and the other influential members of his family prevailed, and His Excellency had no choice but to resign the Government and hasten to Shiraz. Whatever com plaints may have existed against Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk, I am bound to acknowledge his invari able personal and official cordiality and obliging assistance to myself and to this Residency. 71. His successor was Prince Nowzer Mirza, grandson of Hasan Ali Mirza, Pirman- Firma of Fars, who, on the death of his father Fath Ali Shah, became an aspirant to the throne of Persia. This new Governor arrived at Bushire in August, and established cordial relations personally and officially with this Residency ; intrigue was speedily at work against this Prince, who in October left the town and tendered his resignation on account of strong- censure telegraphed by the Amin-es-Sultan on mendacious information. He was, however, persuaded by His Royal Highness the Jelal-ud-Dowlah to remain at bis post for the time. Subsequently, on the recall of His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan, and consequent change of Government in Fars, His Excellency Nowzer Mirza was recalled to Shiraz to make wav for the newly appointed Governor of the seaport Towns and Districts, Muhammad Hasan Khan, Sa'ad-ul-Mulk. 72. In the month of November Mirza Muhammad Khan, Motemed-el-'Wizarah, the Agent of the Persian Foreign Office at Bushire, having become entangled in matters of custom house accounts, was imprisoned in his house, and deprived of food for two days, by ar local official placed over him. In fear of his life the Foreign Agent managed to force the guard placed over him, and fled to the British Residency, where he took ' bast,' or sanctuarj', pending appeal to his Chief and Government. After much delay and correspondence, it was arranged that he should proceed to Tehran for investigation of his case. He was dismissed from his post, and his successor is Najaf Kuli Khan, a person of no standing nor of much experience. 73. Bushire was visited in October by the Austro-Hungarian training corvette ' Fasana,' and in December by the Italian despatch gun-vessel Rapido. 74. In the spring of 1887 Captain Yonblumor, a Russian officer of Cossacks, now in the Shah^s employ, visited Ispahan, Shiraz, and Bushire on a tour of inspection. 75. A Russian ex-officer of Cossacks, named Notovitch, visited Bushire in the winter, and caused some excitement in Persian circles by his free utterances of alleged designs of Russia against England, and the projects entertained by that power in concord with Persia for acting against us in the direction of the Persian Gulf, on the expected early occurrence of war between the two greater States. 76. In March a jewelled sword of honour was formally presented to Haji Ahmed Khan Sirtip in presence of several Persian officials, on which occasion a Royal Firman was read. The nature of the services performed by the Sirtip to the Persian Government will be gathered from perusal of other sections of this report. 77. In the previous year's report it was stated that, although the population of Lingah Lingah and Bunder Abbas and were in favour of their Arab Deputy Governor, Shaikh Islands ' Kadtheeb, his tenure of office was precarious. So it proved. The Persian authorities, in pursuance of a recently adopted policy, had resolved on the abolition of the system of Arab Governors at Lingah, and the abasement of the ruling Arab family. 78. Haji Ahmed Khan was entrusted with the task of capturing Shaikh Kadtheeb, and on the 11th September succeeded in surprising the Shaikh and effecting his object with very slight loss of life. 79. Shaikh Kadtheeb was carried to Bushire, and the property of the family virtuallv con fiscated. A Persian official has been since placed in charge of the ordinary administrative duties at Lingah. The present Agent is Mirza Hedayet Khan, a man of moderation and sense.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 13 80. Barracks were erected at Lin^ah an«l a body of 200 Persian Regular Infantry placed there, much to the distaste of the inhabitants, some of whom prepared to leave the place and settle in other parts of the Gulf. A considerable number of families actually migrated to the adjacent coasts and islands. 81. In July a person named Yakub-bin-Bashir, wlao had been placed at Lingah in the capacity of ' Mufettish,' that is collector of intelligence or informer, by the Persian authori ties, preferred false accusations of a serious nature against the British Government Agent at Lingah, and also forwarded misrepresentations of my own action in the matter of claims against divers at Sirri Island. The Persian Government adopted the reports of this Agent, and made formal complaint to the British Legation. The absolute falsehood of the charo-es against our Agent were proved beyond question, and eventually the matter was allowed'to drop. 82. The annexation to Persia of the Island of Sirri, which was effected from Lino-ah, has been noticed, under Arab Coast affairs. 83. The Persian authorities proposed placing garrisons of Persian soldiery on Kishm, Larek, and other islands, as well as at Lingah and Bunder Abbas, and so much alarm was caused to the inhabitants that many Arab families fled from Henjam. The intention of the Persian Government was, however, abandoned as regards the islands. 84. The administration of Bunder Abbas was during the past year very unsatisfactory Bunder Abbas. and discouraging to trade, the introduction of Persian soldiery to the place was unpopular and unnecessary, but the Sirbaz have recently been withdrawn. The Foreign Office Agent at Bunder Abbas, Mirza Ismail Khan, was relieved by Mirza Ali Khan. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 85. Shaikh Mizal Khan, Governor of Mohammerah, being engaged in a feud with the ' Nassar' Arabs, obtained the assistance of the Persian Government vessel ' Persepolis' 86. Proposals have continued to be made to various quarters in view to opening the river Karun to navigation, but no progress has been made. 87. A new Persian Governor has been appointed to Arabistan. This personage was formerly entitled the Sa'ad-ul-Mulk, and has now been promoted to the title of Nizam-es- Saltanah. 88. The friends of the present Arab Shaikh and Governors have misgivings for the future. Like the Shaikh of Lingah their position may be precarious. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 89. At Gwadur the Wali or Governor, Saif-biu-Sayid, was removed by His Highness Seyyid Toorki in January, and Muhammad-bin-Suleiman appointed in his stead. 90. Government lost a trusty and valuable servant by the death of Mir Jehangir, Native Assistant at Gwadur, on the 17th November. From long personal acquaintance and official relations with Mir Jehangir, I can testify to the great and wholesome influence he exercised in Mekran, where he was universally respected. A man of his stamp is usually not to be re placed. Munshi Abdul Rahim was appointed on probation to carry on the duties of Native Assistant. 91. In the matter of the Firozabad raid of 1886, mentioned in last report, it was decided by Government, on the recommendation of the Agent to the Governor-General, that no com pensation need be paid the Perso-Beluch complainants; but some articles of loot which had been recovered were tendered to Mir Mowladad, Chief of Sirbaz, and rejected by him with a protest against the alleged injustice of the decision referred to, and a threat of reprisals on the Rinds. 92. A complaint has been made by the Chief of the Perso-Beluch district of Bahu that a person, named Mir Nawab Sadazi, residing at Mand, had raided into Bahu, and carried off a number of camels and buffaloes, and subsequently plundered a Persian caravan on the road to Sirbaz. The value of the property stolen is estimated at R375, and the last-mentioned out rage is said to have occurred in October. Reports were made by Mr. Ffinch to the Political Agent, South-Eastern Baluchistan. 93. Two cases of plunder of Hindu traders in Persian Baluchistan are still unsettled: the first, which is called the Sirhad plunder case, occurred in 1884. The complainants were desired to proceed to Kerman to lay their case before the Persian authorities. They did so, but with no result other than incurring additional loss through their expenses in travelling.u ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Bahu. Dashtyari. Geh. Rudbar. 94. During tHe past year, a Hindu trader of Dizak, named Dhormu Mulchand, was stripped of all his property and flogged by order of the Persian Governor of Baluchistan, Abul Fath Khan, and his female and other relations carried off and imprisoned at Bampur. This case, which has been taken up by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, is still pending, 95. In April 1887 Zeyun -ul-Abidin Khan Sirtip, Governor of Persian Baluchistan, was dismissed, and Abul Path Khan Sirtip succeeded him. 96. It appears that the Chief of Dizak, Dilawar Khan, has been seized and imprisoned at Bampur. 97. The following are the present recognised Chiefs of districts :— Mir Mowladad Sirbaz and Kasrkand. Mir Muhammad Ali . Mir Din Muhammad Mir Sayid * Khan , Mir Hussain Khan 98. The inhabitants of Gwetter, who had mostly emigrated on account of oppression, have returned, and the place is as thriving as of yore. 99. At Jask the Persian Governor Mirza Hidayet, who had given every satisfaction to the English Telegraph Department, was replaced by Mirza Ali Khan, who is also conciliatory. 100. In February, the Malek-et-Tujjar of Bushire visited Jask with a detachment of troops and the Persian flag was hoisted and saluted. A large guard of Persian Regulars were posted at Jask, but owing to difficulty in rationing them they were withdrawn, and at present there is a guard of Irregulars only. 101. In October Mr. Ffinch reported much increase of wilful damage to telegraph material in the Jask districts owing to the hostility of the people to Persian authorities. 102. In the same month an affray occurred at Jask owing to some Baluchis of the neigh bourhood refusing to pay tax on produce. They were overpowered and made prisoners, and there was some panic owing to threats of a rescue. Eventually the Baluchis were punished aud released. 103. Since then matters seem to have gone on quietly at Jask. &lt; 9.—OBSERVATORY. 104. The usual tables showing the meteorological observations during the year at Bushire are attached. The hot weather was not severe and a good ' Barih' Shemal was experienced in June and July. Smart earthquakes occurred at Bushire on 14th and 24th November. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. 105. Her Majesty's vessels on the Gulf Station made the usual efforts to intercept slavers running cargoes from Africa to 'Oman, but without success. It appears that a small number of vessels manage to elude the cruisers and to land cargoes of slaves on the 'Oman Coast, but most of the slavers (small craft), land the slaves far to the south-west, where no cruisers patrol, and the slaves are subjected to the long march thence overland, thus adding to their hardships. 11.—OFFICIAL APPOINTMENTS &amp; NAVAL ESTABLISHMENTS. 106. 16tk April 1887. —Mr. A.

The Sultan, to prevent the Beni-Yas from being established in power at Bereymi, sent thejphowahir assistance in the shape of money and ammunition, but unfortunately the a Dar- as-Salam &gt;y which carried it, arrived too late at Sohar to thwart Zaeed in his object, and he suc ceeded in carrying off two of the Dhowahir Shaikhs as prisoners to Abu Dhabbi. In the early part of June Shaikh Suleiman-bin-Seif, with the assistance of the Nizari Arabs of Ziki, and principally through the treachery of one of the garrison, seized the fort at Birket-al-Moze, drove out the Wali Saeed-bin-Sultan at Ameyri, and, taking advantage of his unopposed position, proceeded immediately to Ziki. On the news of the fall of Birket-al- Moze reaching Muscat, the Sultan had three Nizar Shaikhs, who happened to be here at the time, seized and thrown into prison, and anticipating Suleiman^s advance on Ziki sent rein forcements and provisions for the garrison there, under Seyyid Hamud-bin-Nasir, but Shaikh Suleiman had taken the precaution of garrisoning the principal places on the road, so as to prevent the much-needed help from reaching Ziki, and Seyyid Hamud had consequently to fall back upon Somail. Notwithstanding these marked acts of disloyalty Suleiman-bin-Seif excused himself to His Highness the Sultan by pleading the oppression of the Wali against the widow and sons of Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Hilal, as a plea for his capture of Birket-al- Moze, and His Highnesses action in imprisoning the three Nizar Shaikhs as his plea for advanc ing on Ziki. While affairs were progressing in this unfavourable manner in 'Oman proper the dis affected tribes of the Sharkiyah, as usual under the leadership of the Arab rebel, Shaikh Saleh- bin-Ali, were trying to form a general coalition of all the Hinawee tribes, and now, en couraged by the success which Shaikh Suleiman had met with. Shaikh Saleh, not only opened an intriguing correspondence with that Chief, but actually had an interview with him with the object of gaining him over to the general Hinawee cause. The plan of action, had it suc ceeded, was evidently to aim a blow at the Sultan's authority in several places at the same time, and to harass him and weaken his power, so as to enable the rebels, among whom Seyyid Abdul Aziz, tlie Sultan's brother, was one, to dictate their own terms. As a prelude to this general plan, Seyyid Ibrahim bin Kais took by surprise the town and fort of Soweik on the Batineh coast on the night of the 1st of July, and was threatening to take the town of Mesnah, when the Sultan, fearing that the force he had sent with his three sons and Seyyid Bedr-bin-Seif, would not be sufficient to arrest his progress and to oust him from his position, and having therefore requested the help of a British man-of-war, the Resi dent arrived from Bushire on the 9th with orders of Government to afford Seyyid Turki's force the required support, if necessary, and, proceeding to Soweik, demanded on the following day the unconditional surrender of the place from Seyyid Ibrahim. Seyyid Ibrahim, who was at first not aware that the Sultan would be granted this assist ance, now finding his position awkward, although expressing his readiness to abide by the wishes of the British Government, begged hard to be allowed to retain Soweik if only to avoid the disgrace consequent on such an easy and unconditional surrender, but, seeing that the Resident was prepared to support the Sultan actively in recovering the place, promised to evacuate it and to retire peacefully, the Resident in return for his friendly assent agreeing to request Seyyid Turki, conditional on his maintaining a friendly attitude towards the Sultan, to restore his subsidy, which had been stopped some months ago for several acts of disloyalty. His Highness the Sultan, being grateful for the Resident's action, expressed his willino-ness to restore Seyyid Ibrahim's subsidy, and the Resident returned to Soweik on the 12th, when the place was handed over to the Sultan's garrison at night, the Resident proceeding imme diately afterwards to Bushire. This demonstration of our policy had the desired effect, for soon afterwards news was received that the scheme for a general Hinawee rising had failed, but Shaikh Saleh, now dis comfited by his failure in this direction, turned his side altogether and wrote to Muhammad- c 220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL bin-Maswa of Manh, offering his services to His Highness the Sultan in rising against Sulei man-bin-Seif-er-Riyamee. This offer was neither accepted nor needed, for on the release of Seyyid Nasir-bin-Muhammad from the prison at Muscat, Shaikh Suleiman left his position at Ziki, which he had fortified evidently with the eventual object of laying a close siege to the fort there, and retired to Tanoof. On the 25th of July Her Majesty's ship Banger arrived from Eas al Hadd with two Hindus from Sur, who, having complained that the Awlad Kasib, originally a Fakheedeh of the Jenebeh but now under the protection of the Beni-bu-Ali, had carried off one of their community and severely beaten anothef, the Sultan took immediate steps in the matter, but before his letter demanding the immediate surrender of the Hindu, and the punishment of the offenders could reach Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim and Muhammad bin Majid of the Beni-bu- Ali, they had, on hearing of the outrage, out of friendly feelings for the British Government and for His Highness the Sultan, of their own accord imprisoned five of the Awlad Kassib and restored the kidnapped Hindu to his community at Sur. The murder of Shaikh Muhammad bin Majid, the Tameemeh of the Beni-bu-Ali, in the month of August, by a man of the Sinadeh section of the same tribe, followed immediately after by the murder, in revenge, of Shaikh Yusuf bin Ali of the Sinadeh by Hamud bin Majid, was an event disastrous both to the tribe and to the interests of the Sultan. They were among his staunch and tried friends, and ever ready with their swords in his cause. Shaikh Yusuf took a leading part at the siege of Muttrah in 1871 on behalf of Seyyid Turki, and could always be depended upon in an emergency. Fortunately for the tribe. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salinas house being a fortified one, he was able to ward off an attack made by the Sinadeh in revenge for the murder of their Shaikh, but the tribe could ill afford to lose two such powerful Shaikhs as Muhammad and Yusuf at any time, whilst just then the relations with the Beni-bu-Hasan were so highly strained that His Highness, feeling greatly concerned at this unsettled state of affairs in Jaalan, deputed Seyyid Nasir bin Muhammad and Hamid bin Nasir, who succeeded in pacifying the Beni bu Ali, and effecting a peace between them and the Ben- bu-Hasan. Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim was elected by the former as their Tamimeh. The peace, however, thus hurriedly concluded between these two most important tribes was not destined to last long, for in the mouth of September the Beni-bu-Hasau, having killed one of the Awlad Kasib in retaliation for the murder of one of their number, fresh hostilities com menced between them and the peace of Jaalan was once more disturbed. They have now agreed to a truce arranged between themselves, which it is to be hoped may have a more lasting effect. In the month of October fresh rumours of an intended Hinawee rising reached Musca^ but as they were principally due to Seyyid Abdul Aziz's sudden visit to Shaikh Saleh at Bidiyyeh, which had evidently no political meaning, they soon subsided on his return to Samad. His Highness Seyyid Turki, who had lately suffered a good deal from one of his old complaints, left on the 13th November for Gwadur, and returned on the 2nd of December, having somewhat benefited by the change. The distant possession of Dhofar, which has always been a source of trouble to the Sultan, once more showed signs of disloyalty, and early in January a letter was received from Suleiman bin Hamid, the akeed of the garrison in the fort there, who was left in charge of the place by the Wali Seyyid Muhammad bin Suleiman on his departure for Muscat in September, stating that on trying to seize a murderer for punishment the people had resisted him, and that he had eventually to retire into the fort. The Sultan lost no time in preparing an expedition, consisting of 200 men, which left on the 13th in his steamer Svltani with his two sons Feysal and Fahad, Seyyids Nasir bin Muhammad and Bedr bin Seif, Shaikh Shamis bin Hasan and Suleiman bin Suwelim, the newly appointed Wali; but by the time the Sultani arrived at Dhofar affairs had resumed a peaceful aspect, and, instead of meeting with any resistance, the Muscat party on landing found a very cordial reception, so that the only task left for the expedition was to seize five of the Shaikhs, the ringleaders of the disaffected party and to bring them as prisoners to Muscat. On her return voyage the Sultani had to take shelter at Has Madrikeh owing to her supply of coals being exhausted, and the delay thus occasioned in her return caused His Highness the Sultan to be so extremely anxious about the safety, of bis sons, that the Political Agent requested Captain Brackenbury of Her Majesty's Ship Turquoise on the 22nd of February to proceed in search of her. The Turquoise, after giving the necessary help to the Sultani to enable her to resume her voyage, returned to Muscat on the 27th of Febiuary, and the Sultani } with the main body of the expeditionary force, follow ed on the following day.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 21 On tfie 4th of March His Highness Seyyid Bargash bin Saeed, Sultan of Zanzibar, arrived for the benefit of his health, but after a profitless stay of more than a week at Gala, near Bosher, returned to Muscat, and left for Zanzibar on the 17th of March at the recommendation of the Civil Surgeon, whom he had consulted about his disease. He lived only six hours after his return to Zanzibar, and, the news of his death having been received on the 30th of March, general mourning was observed for three days. During his short stay here the late Sultan of Zanzibar made a present of R50,000 to his brother Seyyid Toorki. The Resident visited Muscat on the 9th of June, and a second time in July, on the occasion of Seyyid Ibrahim's capture of Soweik. Official changes, —Lieu tenant-Colonel S. B. Miles, on being appointed Political Resident at Udaipur, handed over charge to Lieutenant-Colonel E. Mockler on the 16th of April; and the latter, on preceding to Bagdad on special duty, handed over charge to Surgeon-Major Jayakar on the 26th of February. Slave Trade. —On the 22nd May 1887, the boats of Her Majesty's Ship Kingfisher seized a slave-dow off Muscat, which was brought in for adjudication. There were four slaves on board, but they were all landed at Kurryat before the seizure. A court was held on the 25th and the dow was condemned. The number of fugitive slaves that sought redress or freedom at this Consulate during the year was 37, of whom 28 have been liberated under the provisions of the Treaty of 1873, and 9 were dismissed.

SKETCH OF THE CAREER OF SEYYID SULTAN BIN AHMED OF MUSCAT. B Y COLONEL S. B. MILES. The present dynasty in J Onian—the A1 Boo Sa'eedy—succeeded that of the Ya^rebeh about the middle of the last century, and originated in the gratitude of a freedom-loving people to a man, who, rising from ao humble position to be their leader in the hour of danger, had, by his patriotism, talents, and courage rescued his country from the humiliation of foreign conquest, and restored it to its dignity as an independeoi State. It was in 1741 or 1742 that the Imam Saif bin Sultan, the Ya^arebeh, having been deposed by his relative Sultan bin Murshid, sent to Persia to beseech aid in dispossessing his rival and recovering his throne. Nadir Shah, who had long entertained the notion of annexing El Bahrain and ^Oman, and of extending his power over the Persian Gulf, and who, with this design in view, had already commenced the creation of a navy by the purchase of ships from the Dutch, and by causing others to be constructed at Surat, eagerly embraced the opportunity now afforded him of inter ference in the affairs of ^Oman, and he lost no time in making preparations for the invasion of Eastern Arabia. The Governor of Shiraz, Mirza Taki Khan, was entrusted with the command of the Persian fleet, and he at first pretended to loyally assist the ex-Imam, Saif bin Sultan. Having gained possession of Muscat however, he attempted to conceal his object no longer, and commenced operations for the reduction of 'Oman to obedience. He succeeded in over-running the country, and fought a great, but indecisive, battle under the walls of Sohar, in which Sultan bin Murshid was slain; but his efforts to reduce that fortress failed. After spending the greater part of the year 1743 in contesting the supremacy with the Wali of Sohar, Ahmed bin Saeed, whose conspicuous skill and ability had given him the general lead of affairs, Mirza Taki Khan, becoming hopeless of the final success of his enterprise, and disappointed in his expectation of enriching himself, made a truce with Ahmed and returned to Persia early in the year 1744. The garrison left in Muscat soon after surrendered and was treacherously massacred, and the liberation of ^Oman from the Persian yoke was then complete. The result seemed to be due solely to the genius of Ahmed, and for the service he had rendered no reward appeared to be too great; the former dynasty was ignominiously thrust aside, and Ahmed bin Saeed was elected Imam by general acclamation. Some time previous to his death, the Imam Ahmed had nominated his eldest surviving son, Saeed, to succeed him, but as Saeed was known to be of a soft and retiring disposition, the selection was not universally approved of, and some of the younger sons were emboldened by their fathers increasing feebleness in his later years to rebel against him. In the month of February 1781, Saif and Sultan, who were uterine brothers, having gathered a small following, succeeded, by seducing the commandants, in getting possession of the forts Merani and Jelali, at Muscat, the guns of which they turned on the town, and soon laid in ruins the houses of the Governor and principal inhabitants. The Imam marched down from Rostak to restore order, and began by removing the tra- deis and their goods to Muttrah for safety. He then invested the forts, but his sons, being well supplied with provisions, and in expectation of aid from the pirate Chief of Ras-el-Khyraa, Shaikh Rashid, continued to hold out. In this assistance the brothers were disappointed, although Rashid appears to have been sincere in his promise of help, and after a siege of three months, during which the Hindoo and other traders sustained a loss of nearly three lakhs of rupees, the forts were surrendered to the Imam, on his granting an amnesty to the garrisons. On the 26th December of the same year Saif and Sultan rose again in rebellion. They proceeded to Burka with a few adherents and slaves, surprised and captured their brother Saeed, brought him down in fetters by boat to Muscat, and threw him into a duno-eon in Fort Jelali.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 23 The old Imam had no sooner heard of this outrage than he started from Rostak to procure his son's liberation, reached Naaman on the 1st January 1782, and marched on to Muscat, where he accomplished his object without much difficulty; but the graceless youths Saif and Sultan again went unpunished for their offence. On the 15th December 1783, the venerable Imam Seyyid Ahmed died at Rostak full of years, after a calm and uneventful rei^n of nearly forty years. He was succeeded by his son Saeed, who was elected Imam without opposition. This election was a bitter disappointment to Saif and Sultan, whose mother was of the Jiboor tribe, and who consequently deemed their claim to the succession greater than Saeed^s. Disgusted at the turn of events, and doubtless fearing Saeed's resentment at their past treatment of him, they resolved at once to quit ; Oman and remain away until better times should dawn for them. Whereupon Saif sailed away to East Africa, from whence he never returned, while Sultan retired to Mekran, where he is said to have resided for some years. Saeed had not long assumed the reins of Government, when disorders and disaffection broke out, and his utter incapacity to rule became manifest to all. Within two years a meeting of Shaikhs and Kadhees was held at Mesnah, where it was resolved to elect Kais in his stead. But this scheme was foiled by Saeed's elder son, Hamad, an energetic and able man, who thenceforward assumed charge of political affairs, and conducted them with firmness and suc cess until his death in 1792. Saeed, though content to leave power in the hands of his son, did not care to resign it to his brothers, and on Hamad's death desired to resume control, and perhaps for some time did so. But Sultan, who was then residing at Burka, and whose influence and prestige in the country were undoubtedly superior to those of his brethren, felt that his opportunity was now come, and he was not the man to let it slip by him. With a sudden spring at Muscat he got possession of that town before Saeed or Kais could march out of Rostak and Sohar to oppose him, and having the general voice of the Ghaffirees in his favour he was soon master of the situation, but the game was not yet ended. The brothers united their forces and made a vigorous attempt to recover Muscat, but without avail. The struggle, however, continued for many months, the Ainawis generally sup porting the Imam, while Sultan had the Ghaffirees on his side. Eventually, a conference of deputies assembled at Burka, where a convention was concluded, by which Saeed retained Rostak with his title of Imam. Kais was given the appanage of Sohar, whilst Sultan was to have Muscat, Burka, and other forts, with the direction of the political affairs of the country. The date of this arrangement, which restored tranquillity to the country, is somewhat uncertain, but it probably took place early in 1793. Seyyid Sultan was born about the year 1755, and during his childhood had dwelt among the Bedouins. His mother was a relative of Muhammad Nasir el Jabri, who was at that time looked upon as the leader of the Nizar, and this explains the cause of Sultan placing his chief reliance upon that faction, although his own tribe was Yemani. Sultan, on assuming power, at once fixed as a residence upon Muscat, the unrivalled posi tion of which in 'Oman as a port, and as a natural fortress against external and internal foes, made it a far more suitable capital than Rostak, Nezwa, or Sohar. He accordingly took up his abode in the Gareyza, or cathedral, a large and substantial building erected by the Portu guese in 1530, and here for the next seven years he resided. When Sultan left 'Oman in 1784, after the succession of Saeed to the Imamate, he had sailed to Gwadur on the Mekran coast, from whence he had proceeded to Kalat to implore the protection of Nasir Khan. This had been accorded to him, and he had been presented with the village and half the revenues of Gwadur for his maintenance. Here he had remained until a reconciliation had been effected some years later with his brother Saeed through the intervention of the latter's son Hamad, when he felt it safe to return to 'Oman. Almost his first act after coming to power was to despatch a Wali with a suitable force to Gwadur to occupy that place on his behalf and to build a fort. The name of this Wali was Saif bin Ali, who, in accordance with further instructions he received from Sultan, subse quently surprised and took possession of the village of Charbar, about a hundred miles to the west of Gwadur. With his ambition fed by this success, Seyyid Sultan's next enterprise was a naval expedition against the Beni Maeen of Kishm and Hormuz, which he appears to have24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL commanded in person. In this war the Maeen were completely defeated and compelled to submission, the sovereignty of Seyyid Sulcan over the two islands being fully acknowledged. At this time, and for some years previous, the Shaikh of the Maeen was the Governor of Bunder Abbass and its dependencies, the revenues of which he had farmed from the Persian Govern ment for a fixed yearly rental. The result- of the war was thus doubly advantageous to Seyyid Sultan, for he now assumed the position of the Shaikh as regards his relations with the Persian Government, and, after some negociation, obtained a firman in his own name from the Shah by virtue of which and of successive firmans Bunder Abbass remained a dependency of Muscat for three-quarters of a century. As Persia and 'Oman were at this time (1794) on bad terms, Seyyid Sultan had, no doubt, to submit to pay heavily for this concession; the peace now concluded, however, lasted until 1797, when a rapture took place, and Baba Khan stfnt orders to the Shaikh of Bushire to collect a land force to be shipped at Mohammerah for an expedition against Muscat. Beyond desultory skirmishing nothing appears to have resulted from these orders, as the Shaikh probably had no means of carrying them out. In December ] 798 Seyyid Sultan commenced hostilities against the Pashalic of Basra, and with a view to preserve his territories from insult during his absence from 'Oman on this expedition, made a truce with the Kowasim of Has el Khyma, with whom he had been for a long time past at war. The Pasha of Busra heard of the preparations at Muscat with apprehension, having no ships at his disposal capable of contending with the Arab fleet. He, therefore, solicited from Mr. Samuel Manisty, the British Resident, the assistance of two English cruizers in protect ing his town from attack, promising in return certain advantages in the way of trade. The Indian Government, however, were at this time not in a position to forsake their attitude of neutrality, or to make enemies of any of the Gulf powers, and they, therefore, instructed the Resident to refrain from doing more than offering good offices in bringing about an amicable settlement with the Ruler of 'Oman. Mr. Manisty accordingly mediated, and shortly after was able to effect a reconciliation. Seyyid Sultan, during his career as Ruler of 'Oman, had to perform no more important act than to make his choice, which he was at this period called upon to do, between the two great rival European powers then contending for the mastery in India, France and England. In the time of the Imams Ahmed and Saeed, French influence, owing to the brisk trade and constant communication that took place between 'Oman and Mauritius, as well as to the personal influence of Monsieur Rousseau, the well-known French Consul-General at Bagdad, who had long maintained friendly relations with Rostak, was predominant in 'Oman, and the Governor of the Mauritius, M. Malartic, took care to maintain this ascendancy by sending valuable gifts of cannon, &amp;c., to the Imam. The harmony of this entente had been interrupted for a time by the unjustifiable capture, in June 1781, of the Imam's 50-gun ship, the Salih, by Captain Desohiens, commander of a French privateer, but on the Imam's repeated representa tions, a small vessel had been despatched by King Louis in 1790 in charge of Captain Mac- namara of La Thetis in substitution of M. Deschien's prize, an act of courtesy which had completely re-established friendly relations. On his usurpation of power Seyyid Sultan continued this friendly intercourse and for some years appears to have been guided in political affairs by his French physician. The Great French Revolution, however, which occurred at this epoch, diverted the atten tion of that nation entirely to home affairs and their prestige declined in the east until the middle of the year 1798, when the sudden appearance of a French army in Egypt and the brilliant conquest of that country by the young General in command again drew the eyes of Orientals to their deeds. The Egyptian expedition appeared to give Napoleon Bonaparte the opportunity he had so long and ardently sighed for, of satisfying the cravings of his ambition, and he allowed his imagination to run riot in dreams of eastern glory. One o£ these dreams was to lead his army back to France through Constantinople and Austria, annexing the one and crushing the other on the way. Another scheme was to march across the Syrian desert, Mesopotamia, and Persia, like Alexander to the frontiers of India, to conquer that Empire for France or for himself. It was in pursuance of this latter project (which he continued to cherish for years afterwards) that General Bonaparte despatched emissaries and letters to various Oriental potentates, among whom were Tippu Sahib and the Imam of Muscat, with a view to gain allies and assistance in the enterprise. Twelve days before he started from Cairo on his Syrian expedition, he wrote the following letter to Seyyid Sultan, enclosing one to Tippu, in which he promised to deliver Mysore from the iron yoke of England, This letterRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 25 was the favourable answer to his constant appeals to the French Government for aid against the English which the misguided Tippu had been for so many years expecting. But it was too late, Tippu was now at the end of his career, and, as it happened, the despatches never even reached Muscat, for they were intercepted on the way by an English man-of-war. Dated Cairo, the 25tli January 1799. To— The Imaxjm of Muscat. I write you this letter to inform you of the arrival of the French army in Egypt. As you have always been friendly, you must be convinced of our desire to protect all the merchant vessels you may send to Suez. I also beg you will forward the enclosed letter to Tippu Sahib by the first opportunity. (Sd.) BONAPARTE. The alarm felt by the Indian Government at the undoubted influence of the French in 'Oman, the dread lest it should extend over the Gulf, and the apprehensions everywhere inspired by Napoleon Bonaparte's military genius and restless activity, led the Governor-General of India, the Marquis of Wellesley, to instruct the Resident at Bushire, Mirza Mehdi Ali Khan, to enter into a political engagement with Seyyid Saltan, having, for its object the exclusion of French influence from 'Oman territory. Mirza Mehdi reached Muscat in September 1798, and the Treaty which he negotiated was signed on the 12th October following. It comprised seven articles and contained, besides the engagement to exclude Frenchmen from the Imam's territory and French ships from his ports during the prevalence of war between English and French, provision for the establish ment by the East India Company of a factory at Bunder Abbass with a guard of 7 00 or 800 Indian troops. Though it was not mentioned in the Treaty, Seyyid Sultan further made a special request that an English officer should be sent to reside at Muscat on behalf of the Com pany as his adviser. Seyyid Sultan was thus the first Prince in the peninsula of Arabia to enter into political relations with England, and it is satisfactory to note that the friendly relations then initiated have from that day to this continued to strengthen and increase. During the year 1799 Seyyid Sultan was engaged in consolidating his power in 'Oman and in dealing with internal dissensions. Among the tribes that were disaffected to wards him were the Daroo of El Sharkujeh and the Beni Naim of El Dhahrieh, both of which he succeeded in subduing and bringing back to allegiance. Having at length tranquil- lised his own country, he was able to turn his attention to foreign enemies, and, first of all, he resolved to concentrate his strength against the Uttoobees of El Bahrein, who had refused to pay any longer the tax levied upon all vessels passing from India to the Persian Gulf. This tax had for one and a half centuries been paid to Muscat by all craft, foreign as well as home, sailing through the Straits of Mussendom, and as the revenue it used to bring in was consider able, Seyyid Sultan was not inclined to allow the refusal of the Uttoobees to pay the impost to pass without chastisement. He accordingly sailed in the Gun jaw a frigate, with three square-rigged ships and sixty bughlas, to attack El Bahrein, and in a sea-fight that took place shortly after captured three of the Uttoobee vessels. In the meantime the Uttoobees, being aware of their inability to resist the naval power of 'Oman, had hastened to place themselves under the protection of Persia by paying the Shah the tribute for El Bahrein for the preceding year. Seyyid Sultan heard of this action on the part of the Uttoobees at the time when he was preparing to land his troops on that island, and he lost no time in entering into negociations with Persia himself. Being foiled in his attempt on El Bahrein, he occupied the island of Karrack, which he offered to farm from Persia at a yearly rental and pay five years in advance. This offer, however, was declined by the Persians, who continued to take the part of the Uttoobees, and Seyyid Sultan eventually relinquished further operations against the tribe on payment by them of a portion of the arrears of tax due. The failure of this expedition appears to have caused the abandonment of the tax, which we do not afterwards hear of. Not long after the conclusion of the Treaty by Mirza Mehdi in 1798, reports reached the Government of India to the effect that, notwithstanding his engagements, Seyyid Sultan had resumed friendly intercourse with the French, and the interception of General Bonaparte's26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL letter seems to have been looked on as affording proof of this. The immunities in favour of Arab trade with India that had been granted to Seyyid Sultan were accordingly suspended for a time, and Captain John Malcolm, who had been selected to conduct a Mission to Persia, was instructed to call at Muscat on his way thither, for the purpose of renewing the Anglo-'Oman alliance, and concluding a second treaty confirming the provisions of the one of 1798. Captain Malcolm sailed from Bombay in the Bombay frigate, commanded by Captain Selby, and arrived at Muscat on the 8th January 1800. Besides the staff attached to the Mission to Persia, Captain Malcolm brought with him Assistant Surgeon Bogle, of the Bombay establishment, who, in compliance with the request, made by Seyyid Sultan to Mirza Mehdi Ali, had been appointed to act as Resident on behalf of the East India Company at Muscat. On anchoring in the harbour, the Bombay was visited by the Governor of the town, Saif-bin-Muhammad, who came to call on Captain Malcolm, and stated that Seyyid Sultan was absent at the time on an expedition against the Uttoobees, and that his return was uncertain. Captain Malcolm returned the Governor's visit the following day, and then, having landed Dr. Bogle and installed him in his appoint ment, set sail for Hormuz in search of Seyyid Sultan. On the 18th January, Captain Malcolm sighted and boarded the Gunjava off the island of Henjam, and having produced his credentials and delivered his presents, proceeded at once to explain the purport of his mission. He told Seyyid Sultan how much the Indian Govern ment regretted he had leagued himself with the French, and hoped he would see that it was his best policy to ally himself with the English, pointing out that, as all the ports of India from Surat to Calcutta were in the hands of the English, Muscat could, without difficulty, be excluded from all participation in the Indian trade if the British Government were so disposed. Seyyid Sultan did not take long to decide. Placing his hand upon his breast, he said he desired nothing better than to cement an alliance with the English to the exclusion of their enemies, and he offered to sign then and there the treaty that Captain Malcolm had been empowered to conclude. The treaty thus entered into bears in fact the same date and con sists of only two articles, one confirming the engagement of 1798, and the second providing for the residence of a Political Agent. It was in this year, 1800, that the warlike tribes of Nejd in Central Arabia were first seen in ''Oman. These tribes, impelled by the fanaticism engendered by the doctrines of a religious reformer, Shaikh Abdul Wahhab, after whom they are now called Wahhabees^ had already overrun and conquered nearly the whole of the rest of the Peninsula, and the Amir Abdul Aziz, eager to expurgate the heresy of Ibadheeism from the land of 'Oman, was now pre paring to turn his arms eastward and spread his views of the true religion by the sword. After taking El Hasa and Katif his troops crossed the Sabkhah marsh and pushed on to- El Bereymi, subduing or scattering the Bedouin tribes on the way. The leader of this expedition, which consisted of a large camel force and seven hundred cavalry, was El Harik, a bold and skilful General, who immediately began the erection of a fort there, to serve as a basis for his operations and campaigns against the inhabitants of El Dhahireh and of the rich valleys and lowlands of the Batineh. This invasion of their country by the dreaded Wahhabees created intense excitement throughout all 'Oman, and Seyyid Sultan, with his usual energy and spirit, lost no time in assembling the tribes and moving up to oppose their advance. Having allied himself with Shaikh Saki the Kasimi, he marched through the Wady Jezze as far as El Bereymi, but in the contest that ensued with the enemy the 'Omanis appear to have been worsted, and Seyyid Sultan, finding he could not expel the intruders from ll-l Jow, made a truce with El Harik and retired to Sohar, where he dismissed his troops. In 1801 the island of El Bahrein, which has ever been on account of its rich pearl fishery the chief bone of contention for the peoples round the shores of the Persian Gulf, was again the object of Seyyid Sultan's ambition, and was invaded, and this time successfully, by a grand naval expedition from Muscat, the Uttoobees being driven out, and the island occupied by the 'Omani troops. Saif bin Ali, who had already done good service on the Mekran Coast, was appointed Governor and Commandant. An attempt was then made by Seyyid Sultan to capture the town of Kowait, where the Uttoobees had taken refuge, and homage was demanded from the Shaikh, but the enterprise was a failure. Nor did El Bahrain remain long in the possession of Muscat; a few months later it was retaten from Seyyid Salim bin Sultan, then a boy of twelve, who had replaced Saif bin Ali as Governor, by the Uttoobees, who succeeded in surprising the garrison.%£) RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1887-88. 27 In this year Assistant Surgeon Bogle was succeeded by Captain David Seton, of the Bom bay Army, who was appointed to act under the title of Resident at Muscat, and who assumed charge of his duties towards the close of the year. The expulsion from El Bahrein was a disappointment to Seyyid Sultan, whose ardour for military enterprises appears to have been unquenchable, and who now resolved upon prosecut ing the Uttoobee war in earnest. Saif bin Ali was again despatched with a strong naval force to the island, which, in part, he succeeded in re-occupying. But, though he made good his footing, Saif could not entirely expel the enemy, and Seyyid Sultan, feeling his strength unequal to their subjugation, supported as they were at this time by the Wahhabees, now determined to call in the aid of Persia. With this object he despatched as envoy one Shaikh Ali, by way of Congoon to the Prince Grovernor of Shiraz, with costly presents, to procure the cooperation of that Ruler in a great expedition against the Uttoobees. Seyyid Sultan wrote also to Shaikh Nasir, the Wali of Bushire, requesting him to use his influence with the prince in obtaining the required assistance, and enclosing a blank sheet of paper with his (Sultan's) seal on it, to be filled up with any conditions the Persians might impose in return for the military assistance they were to give. Seyyid Sultan, however, did not wait for these re-inforcements, but early in June 1802, having determined on conducting operations in person, set sail with a formidable fleet of ships and bughlas for El Bahrein. Landing in force, he attacked the Uttoobees vigorously but without gaining much success, until two months later, his appeal to Shiraz having been favourably received, a body of 200 horse and 2,000 foot embarked at Bushire to join him. The result of the combined forces acting against the tribe was that the latter were com pelled to submit and acknowledge the supremacy of 'Oman; the aggressive attitude of the Wahhabees at this time, and the consequent necessity of withdrawing a large portion of his army for home defence, alone preventing Seyyid Sultan from prosecuting the war until he had completely expelled the Uttoobees from the island. His navy, however, had the satisfaction of so far destroying the Uttoobee war craft that by the end of October 1803 their piratical depredations were entirely at an end. In May 1802 Captain Seton was compelled by ill health to return to Bombay on twelve months' leave, the Company's native broker being left in charge of affairs. Captain Seton returned to Muscat, and resumed charge as Resident in June 1803. Though it was as much as he could do to protect his own country from the Wahhabees Seyyid Sultan was too magnanimous to refuse an appeal which appears to have been made about this time to him to aid in repelling the Nejdeans, who had invaded the Hejaz, and were threatening the Holy Cities. Taking with him presents of money and munitions of war for the Shereef, he embarked with Shaikh Muhenna El Yaareby and others on board one of his ships in January 1803, and set sail for Jedda. A small military contingent appears to have been also prepared and despatched to Jedda at this time, but if so, it was not commanded by Seyyid Sultan, whose object in going himself was to perform the pilgrimage at Mecca, which he duly accomplished. The Regency appointed to act during his absence was composed of his elder son, Salim, his relative Muhammad Nasir El Jabri, and Muhammad Khalfan. Soon after his departure, his nephew, Seyyid Bedr, who was then residing at Hibra, a village near Nakhl, proceeded to Muscat with a few followers and concealed himself in the house of Seyyid Majid, the brother of the Wali of the town, and endeavoured therefrom to seduce the commandant of Fort Jelali from his allegiance. In this intrigue Seyyid Majid, who was disaffected, lent his aid, but the attempt failed, and Seyyid Bedr, having been denounced, was barely able to effect his escape. Tradition relates that he was being smuggled into Jelali in a large box, but was detected by one of the Hindu traders, who reported the matter to Seyyid Salim. At all events Bedr got clear off, and made his way, first to Ajman, from whence he pro ceeded to Zobura in Katar, and sought protection from the Wahhabees, whose tenets he adopted. With their help he subsequently, on two occasions, made an attempt on Muscat, but, failing in this, he at length determined to mate a journey to Nejd, where, in 1804, he had an interview with the Amir Saood, who gladly received him. Though the small force despatched to the Hejaz could have done but little to help in stemming the tide of Wahhabee invasion, the knowledge of Seyyid Sultan's act of hostility and the presence of the 'Omanis in the ranks of his enemies so exasperated the Amir Abdul- Azeez that on his return from the campaign he declared war against Muscat, and despatched d 228 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL orders to El Bahrein, Koweit, andRas El Khyma to fit out their fleets to scour the Gulf against J Omani commerce. To these orders the Uttoobees and Kowasim demurred, as the pearl fishery season was now commencing, and all their men were engaged, and they accordingly represented to the Amir that they could not abandon their occupation, but the commands were repeated in so peremptory a manner that the tribes no longer hesitated to obey, and the pearl fishery that year was abandoned in favour of piracy. The news of the Amir's intention to extend his aggressions by sea, as well as by land, induced the Persian Government and the Pasha of Baghdad to ally themselves with Seyyid Sultan against him. In the naval war that followed Seyyid Sultan personally took an a ctive part, and did his utmost to protect his own coasts and commerce from the insults and ravages of the piratical fleet ,• but his success was not great. His allies had, after some show of assistance, left him in the lurch, and he was now threatened with an invasion by land. In this critical position, Seyyid Sultan deemed it best to try and propitiate his enemy. He accordingly despatched a mission to Derayeh, and purchased a truce for three years by the payment of a large sum of money, the promise of a yearly tribute of 1^,000 dollars, and the establishment of a Wahhabee Agent at Muscat. The Amir, however, had no intention of relinquishing his grasp on 'Oman, even on these humiliating terms. He took advantage of the truce to re-intorce El Harik at El Bereymi, and, shortly after, perfidiously broke it by ordering his General to march. El Harik at once poured down into the Batineh, where he committed unspeakable atrocities, and easily overpowered the resistance he met with from the disunited tribes in his path. Seyyid Sultan, on hearing of El Harik's movement, hastily gathered as large a force as he could muster, and a battle took place in Wady Heimali above Soweyk, in which the Omanis were routed by the Wahhabees. This was the first great disaster experienced in 'Oman at the hands of these fanatics, and Seyyid Sultan was constrained by the alarm felt everywhere to call a council of war at Barka to discuss a plan of operations. The Shaikhs of tribes of both actions assembled there agreed to combine against the common enemy, and it was arranged that each tribe should contribute its quota and assemble at Khabooreh on a certain day. El Harik after, the affair at Heimali, retired towards Sohar, to which he laid siege, and there quietly awaited the advance of the army of defence Seyyid Sultan was raising, and which soon numbered 12,000 men. At this juncture the news of the death of the Wahhabee's Amir Abdul Aziz, who had been assassinated at Derayeh in October, reached El Harik at Sohar, and the advices he then received of affairs at home induced him to raise the siege and retire without delay to El Bereymi, Helieved from the pressure of their exacting masters, the Kowasim speedily made peace with Seyyid Sultan, and the 'Omanis, unacquainted with the real cause of the sudden dis appearance of their foes, ascribed it to their own superiority in numbers or to the success of the negociations that had been carried on by Seyyid Sultan with El Harik. When the death of the Emperor Paul dissolved the treaty for the joint Franco-Russian invasion of India overland, Napoleon determined that the substitution of French supremacy for English in India should follow as a natural consequence upon the subjection of England itself, for which purpose he at once began to make preparation. With this grand scheme before him Napoleon, towards the close of the year 1802, while the treaty of Amiens was yet in force, selected one of his ablest Generals, Decaen, to be the Captain General of the French possessions in the East, and despatched him with Admiral Linoi's expedition, which sailed from Brest on the 6th March 1803. The mission of General Decaen was to observe closely the position of the English in India in their relation to the Native Princes, and to prepare the way for the French conquest and occupation of India by procuring full information as to the state of affairs and extent of armament required. After visiting Pondichery, General Decaen fixed upon the Island of Mauritius as his head-quarters and post of observation, and on establishing himself there immediately despatched M. de Cavaignac in the Atalanta frigate to his destination. This M. de Cavaignac had been appointed by Napoleon Agent and Consul for France at Muscat, and as his mission had the same object in view as that of General Decaen, to whom he was subordinate, it may be as well to transcribe here the concluding paragraph of the long letter of instructions written for the General's guidance by Napoleon, which indicates clearly enough that the scheme for the conquest of India had not been relinquished, and that Decaen might possibly be entrusted with the enterprise— 'The mission of the Captain General is, in the first instance, a mission of observation, political and military, &amp;c., but the first Consul, well informed by the Captain General, upon whom he relies for the punctualRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 29 execution of these instructions, may perhaps place it in his power to acquire a great glory which prolongs the memory of men beyond the duration of ages.' The Atalanta frigate, a famous ship in her day, was painted a bright yellow colour with white mouldings, and was one of the swiftest and handsomest vessels of her class in the French navy. She. sailed from Mauritius on the 5th September 1803, and reached Muscat on the 3rd October. On anchoring in the cove she was boarded by the Wali, who, on being made acquainted with the purport of M. de Cavaignac's mission, informed that gentleman that Seyyid Sultan was absent in the interior, being engaged in operations against the Wahhabees; he promised, however, that immediate intimation should be sent to him of the Atalanta s arrival, and, in the meantime, offered M. de Cavaignac the hospitality of a house on shore. At this time the Resident, Captain Seton, was absent on duty, having sailed in the Ternate • in the beginning of September for another part of the Gulf, and^the French envoy, therefore, had a fair opportunity of making friends with the leading Arabs, and of pressing the advantages of a French alliance. It was in his favour also that the commercial intercourse so long existing with Mauritius had caused the formation of a strong French party in the town, as he was able to depend on the influence of these partizans at the palace, and it was from them that he first learned of the existence of the treaties of 1798 and 1800. Congrataluting himself, therefore, on the opportune absence of his adversary, the English Resident, M. de Cavaignac entertained for some days high hopes of procuring a favourable reception and of succeeding in his mission. Seyyid Sultan returned to Muscat on the morning of the 12th October 1803. He had been engaged in contending and negociating with the Wahhabee General, but on receiving his Waifs letter had started at once for Muscat, firmly resolved upon the course he would adopt with Napoleon's agent. The captain of the Atalanta, on hearing of Seyyid Sultan's arrival, sent two of his officers to convey his respects and compliments, and to ask for an interview. The officers were civilly received, and on being questioned as to the object of the Atalanta's visit replied that it was desired to establish a French Residency at Muscat, and that an officer appointed to act as Consul by the French Government was on board the vessel. The same afternoon Seyyid Sultan sent two Arab officials on board, with instructions to acquaint the Captain and M. de Cavaignac that His Highness could not receive a French Agent and Consul on account of the engagements recently entered into with the English, and that he declined an interview to discuss the subject; but that, as he wished to remain on friendly terms with the French, his harbours would always be open, as before, to their vessels, and that * he would be happy to listen to any proposals they had to make on commercial matters. In dictating this diplomatic message, Seyyid Sultan was no doubt actuated by a keen regard for his country's interests. While fearful of offending the French, the remembrance of Captain Malcolm's arguments and the momentous events that had occurred since his (Malcolm's) visit, such as the evacuation of Egypt by the French army, and the triumphs of Lord Lake in India, had created a deep impression on the Prince's mind, and must have convinced him more than ever as to the incomparably greater importance to the Arabs of the English over the French alliance. The tone of the message must have shown M. de Cavaignac the hopelessness of argument and representation on his part, as he does not appear to have again sought an interview, but it was a bitter disappointment to him, for his Arab friends had made him sanguine of success, and he had doubtless been anticipating in his mind the approbation of Napoleon. Reluctant, however, to abandon so easily the mission with which he had been charged, he waited in the harbour for one more day and then, under cover of the darkness of midnight on the 13tb, the Atalanta 3 % broad sails bore her out of the port, and by the morning she was nowhere to be seen. This attempt closed for the time French' political intercourse with Muscat, and it was not renewed until Seyyid Saeed sent a mission to the Isle of France after the murder of Seyyid Bedr in 1807. But the French privateers nevertheless did not cease to make Muscat a rendezvous and base for their operations against British shipping in the Persian and 'Oman Gulfs, and great was the depredation committed by them. During the ten years of Seyyid Sultanas reign, from 1793 to 1804, the loss inflicted on British trade in the Indian Ocean was not less than 250 lakhs of rupees, or about three millions sterling.30 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Ssyyid Sultan and the Muscat merchants had agents at Port Louis specially to purchase English goods and prizes, and many were the ships thus brought to the Gulf or taken to Calcutta for resale, for it was not until 1806 that the Marine Insurance Offices in India interfered to check this traffic. Many contests also took place about this time between French and English cruizers in Arab waters. In November 1800 the Intrepid of 10 guns, commanded by Captain Hall, encountered a French privateer of superior force off Muscat, and after a long combat succeeded in beating her off and chasing her away. In 1803 La Fortune, commanded by Captain Lememe, a daring and successful privateer captured the Indian Marine brig Fly of 14 guns, and shortly after took the Viper of 14 guns belonging to the same service. Lememe then proceeded to the Mauritius, but returned to the Gulf early in 1804, and committed great havoc until November of that year, when he was himself captured by the English frigate Concorde, which had been sent out in search of him. Seyyid Sultan was well aware that the suspension of hostilities on the part of El Harik was only temporary, and though the large force collected in the Batineh dispersed on the retirement of the enemy from before Sohar, he began at once to make fresh preparations against the renewal of the storm. With the object of re-opening negociations with the Pasha of Baghdad for an alliance, and of concerting operations with the Turkish Commander, Seyyid Sultan despatched one of his ships to Busra under the command of Ibrahim Mulla Ali, but before he could learn the result of this move he found himself already engaged with the Wahhabees by sea and land. The Amir Saood bin Abdul Aziz had adopted his fathers scheme for the complete eon- quest and annexation of 'Oman, and had on his accession issued orders to El Harik to push on again to the Batineh. At the same time, November 1808, the war fleets of the Uttuk and Kowasim were sent abroad to sweep the Gulf against the Muscat trade, and began by making a descent on the Island of Kishm, which they overran and pillaged. It does not appear that Seyyid Sultan's mission to Baghdad resulted in any joint action with the Turks. The Pasha was profuse in his promises of assistance and co-operation, but though equally desirous to see the Wahhabees crushed, he preferred to wait and see the 'Omani Prince exhaust himself in opposing them. Seyyid Sultan's appeals to the Government of India were similarly unsuccessful. He was left to bear the brunt of the war alone. Under a weak ruler 'Oman would almost certainly have succumbed to the invader, but Sultan never relaxed his efforts nor spared his resources in the defence of his country, and his indomitable courage and activity infused a spirit of resistance into his countrymen that enabled them for years to keep their foes in check. Until his untimely death in the following year, Seyyid Sultan seems to have been engaged in an almost continual struggle with Saood's troops, and though he was able to pre vent their advance up to the capital, he could never dislodge them from their main post at El Bereymi nor expel them from the country. It was in September 1804 that he left 'Oman for the last time on a naval expedition in the Gulf. Having collected a fleet of thirteen other ships and war dows, he embarked on board the Gunjava and cruized in search of the piratical fleet that had done so much to injure his commerce. He then sailed for Busra, where he wished to ascertain the extent of the military pre parations being made by the Turkish Pasha in accordance with his promise for operating against the Wahhabees. Disappointed and indignant, however, at his reception there, he did not remain long, but turned his face homeward and set sail down the Gulf. On his way he transferred himself to an Arab boat, or bateel, in order to land at Bassidore, and while in this almost defenceless position was attacked by three piratical dows belonging to Ras El Khyma, before any of his fleet could discern his danger or come to his assistance. His assailants were Kowasim, at this time in league with the Wahhabees, and, as usual, at war with Muscat, but that they attacked with the set purpose of taking the life of the 'Omani Chief is somewhat doubtful. Seyyid Sultan fell at the first onslaught, with several of his attendants, and the pirates, on finding what they had done, fled at once to escape the vengeance of the Muscat fleet. The various dates mentioned for this event are the 14th, 17th, 18th, and 20th November 1804, but the exact date is not of importance. He is said to have been buried at Lingah.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 31 The news of Seyyid Sultan's deathjcaused, as may be imagined, intense dismay throughout ; Oman. 4 Threatened as the country was by external foes, the people seemed to be stunned by the loss of their great leader, and for some little time the attitude of all parties was one of expecta tion. But such a condition of affairs could not last, and it was not long before Sultan's brothers, Kais and Muhammad (for the Imam Saeed had died the previous year), rose in arms against their nephews, Salim and Saeed, the only point in whose favour was the possession of Muscat. Sultan's death, however, affected not only his own country ; it created a great alteration in the state of politics over the whole Gulf. The general consternation at the disappearance of the warrior, who had alone actively opposed the common foe and disturber of public peace, caused every Chief to prepare to defend himself, not knowing his friends from his enemies, while the Kowasim and Uttoobees, being no longer held in check, became more daring than ever. At this time, November, the pirate fleet consisted of eleven war dows and thirty-three trankeys, to which were soon added two brigs, the Trimmer and Shannon, taken from the English. A month later the pirates rose to the audacity of attacking a vessel of war. This was the Mornington cruizer, which had been despatched from Bombay to protect the English trade in the Gulf, and though she succeeded in beating off her assailants it was not without difficulty, for they were superior in force. In character Seyyid Sultan is said to have been resolute and energetic. Fond of military expeditions, and always open-handed, he was universally admired by his people and his pres tige in the country equalled that of his father. He seems to have been quite as able as his better known son, Saeed, and was certainly of a more noble and less sensual disposition. Seyyid Sultan's claims to the gratitude of his countrymen were certainly great. In addition to his efforts to keep the Wahhabees at bay, he had made his country more respected abroad than it had been for a century and a half, and had greatly extended his dominion by the acquisition of territory on the Persian Coast. He was, moreover, unceasing in his endea vours to develop the commerce of 'Oman, and by fixing his residence at Muscat had done much to raise that city to the position of being the chief emporium of trade in the Persian Gulf. In East Africa Seyyid Sultan had little opportunity of extending his rule, as he was too much engaged in home affairs to be able to pay attention to it, and matters there remained in the same state as they were left by Seyyid Hamad on his visit to that coast in 1784. Zanzi bar Island had continued to be governed direct from Muscat, while Mombasa remained in dependent and undisturbed, though the Wali, Ahmed bin Muhammad, wrote in 1793 to acknowledge Seyyid Sultan's suzerainty.m mmasammBammmmmm r 32 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL p art iii—bepoet on the trade op south persia for the year 1887. Owing mainly to great dearness of grain in South Persia, the year 1887 opened with trade in a state o£ stagnation. The rainfall in the autumn of 1886 and spring of 1887 was unusually scanty (about 5| inches at Bushire), and the grain harvest of 1887 was consequently short and irtadequate, the prices of wheat rising to krans 14 per 124 pounds, and of barley to 12 krans for the same quantity. This led to the regular importation of wheat, barley, and flour from India. In these circumstances trade in all articles of import and export was dull and unremunerative during the first-half of the year. A native firm of some importance in Shiraz having stopped payment, it was feared that many smaller merchants, already weakened by the depressed state of trade, would become bankrupt. Fortunately, however, at this juncture, matters took a more favourable turn, and the increase in prices of opium helped to avert further misfortune. The diminished amount of importations of piece-goods, sugar, &amp;c., doubtless caused favourable fluctuations in the native markets, and the latter part of the year was more satisfactory to merchants than anticipated. Probably this does not imply so much a material increase of profits as a saving of losses, owing to reduced and more cautious operations, but towards the end of the year considerable sales of Manchester goods were made at improved prices. The year 1888 opened with much more hopeful prospects in every way, a good and seasonable rainfall justifying expectations of an abundant harvest this year. Exports. The opium crop was one of the smallest recorded for several years, and owing to a brisk . demand in the European and China markets prices increased considerably, the results to those engaged in this trade being highly satisfactory, and proving the saving of several Persian merchants. The adulteration of Persian opium, formerly extensively practised, has now greatly decreased, and when lots are rejected it is probably from lack of skill in the manipulation or other causes. The tobacco crop was fairly large. This cultivation is gradually increasing, but hitherto Tobacco a large proportion (nearly one-third it is said J of the crops is spoiled by early rains and bad weather. To avoid this serious loss the cultivators are having recourse to early sowings with some success, the crops being gathered at a correspondingly earlier season. The grain crops in South Persia, as well as in Turkish Arabia, having been so scanty, prices remained very high, the interdict on exportation of grain was kept on, and, as before mentioned, supplies were imported from India to Persia. So far as the chief ports were concerned, the embargo was observed, but the petty chiefs of districts north of Bushire found it to their interest to prevent the cultivators of their districts from sending their wheat and barley to the Bushire market, and compelled them to use Bunder Reeg, whence quantities of the grain were shipped to Busrah and other ports. This, of course, enhanced the scarcity and dearness of grain, generally. The cotton crop in South Persia was comparatively large Cotton. and prices higher than for some time past, owing to a good demand in Bombay. Imports, The returns show again a decrease in the import of these goods, but an improvement set Manchester goods. in duriD g tlie latter months of the year, which is expected to continue and strengthen during the current year. A decline is also visible in the importation of loaf sugar. This is understood to be due g ugar to two causes—firstly, the large losses sustained on shipments in previous years ; and, secondly, large arrivals of sugar from Russia, which reached as far as Ispahan, a market hitherto supplied from Bushire. The competition between English and Mauritius sugars on the one hand, and Russian and other beet sugars on the other, may possibly be affected by the abolition of bounties, if the measures contemplated are observed as regards Persia. Large losses were experienced inEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1887-88. 33 importations of French sugar, and the agent of the Russian firm of Marseilles at Bunder Abbas has closed his office. The importation of sugar from Germany has been discontinued. In the two previous years a decline in the trade in copper was noticed. A Syndicate Metals&lt; in London having established a &lt;f cornerin this article, prices in Europe and other parts of the world have been sent up to a remarkable degree, and of course this has affected the Persian trade. Owino-, however to large stocks on hand in Persia, prices did not advance to a corresponding extent with those in Europe, and sheets of copper have actually been re-shipped from Bushire to Bombay and London. Persian dealers doubt the durability of the Syndicate, and hesitate to speculate until the stocks of copper in Persia have been disposed of, hence the failure to force up prices in Persia to the level ruling in Europe. Eicei Owing to scarcity and dearness of grain, there has been a larger importation of rice from India than usual. Shipping. The number of steamers for Persian ports was unusually small. Owing to there beino- no exportation of grain, the regular vessels plying sufficed for general trade, and few other steamers would have called at Persian ports but for the demand at Busrah on account of the date business there. Pilgrims also were less numerous than usual, probably owing to distress from depression of trade; but a large proportion went overland, instead of by sea, Freights were fairly good and steady. IE jc change. Exchange, on the whole, ruled lower than in 1886, fluctuating between 33^ krans and 35i krans per £ sterling. The value of the kran in relation to the rupee has improved. The value of rupees averaged under 245 per cent., a less rate than in the preceding year. This is thought to be due to the Herat krans having been sent out of the country. The Malek Et Toojjar of Bushire farmed the customs of Shiraz, Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas with the district revenues of the last two places for the year 1887-88 at krans 21,50,000. These were sublet as follows :— Krans. Shiraz customs 2 80 000 Bushire . . Lingah . a Bunder Abbas .

In connection with the trade between India and Persia conducted through Bunder Abbas, I subjoin some interesting notes furnished to me by Lieutenant H. B. Vaughan, 7th Regiment, Bengal Infantry, dated Yezd, 3rd March 1888. The advantage which would accrue to British commerce from the establishment of an agent at Yezd to protect British commercial interests at that centre, is urged with justice by Lieutenant Vaughan, and has been referred to in previous reports :— Population. 'Since the introduction of the Telegraph and Post Office Yezd has become an important centre of trade, its population, inclusive of ad jacent suburbs, being about 100,000. « The government of the district is farmed out for 250,000 tomans, and the customs for 47.000. The imports are Indian goods, as well as English, of all descriptions, amongst which are yarns, piece- Imports. goods, prints, sugar, sugar refined, copper sheets, thin slabs, lead, iron, condiments, chinaware, glassware, spices, green tea, Indian tea, and Singapore tea. 'These imports come chiefly from Bombay through Bunder Abbas, and after a sufficient quantity has been taken here for local use, the remainder goes on from this city to the following placesMeshed, Tehran, Kushan, babzawar, Birzand, Toon, Tabas. Exports. ' The exports of Yezd are opium, cotton wool, madder root, cummin seeds, almonds, walnuts, pistachio-nuts, &amp;c.34 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL ' There are about 15 naturalised British subjects living here, Parsees and Mussulmans, and it is through their hands that almost all of the trade of this place with Bombay through British subjects.

The Annual Report of the Muscat Political Agency for the past official year has been prepared by Lieutenant W. Stratton, and forms Part II of this General Report. 2. The year 1888 will be memorable in the history of 'Oman from the death of Seyyid Turki bin Sa'eed bin Sultan after a reign of seventeen years. 3. In the middle of May Surgeon-Major Jayakar telegraphed that the Sultan was dangerously ill, and not expected to recover, and that an immediate struggle for power would occur on his decease. I thereupon proceeded at once to Muscat in Her Majesty's ship Kingfisher, and visited Seyyid Turki, who, though still ill and weak, had so far rallied that the Civil Surgeon did not apprehend an immediate termination of his life. I therefore returned to Bushire. 4. Information having been received of the death of Seyyid Turki on the 4th of Jane, I proceeded again to Muscat, and personally conveyed to the sons of the late Sultan the condolences of Her Majesty the Queen-Empress and His Excellency the Viceroy of India, in accordance with instructions received by telegraph. 5. Seyyid Turki left three sons, Seyyids Mohammed, Eeysal, and Eahd, all grown-up young men, and all of an African mother. The eldest, Mohammed, is somewhat disqualified by appearance, manner, &amp;c.j from becoming ruler of the Muscat State, and was, more or less with his own acquiescence, put aside, and the second son assumed the government of Muscat, apparently with the general consent and approval of the population and tribes of 'Oman. 6. At my last interview with the late Sultan in May, His Highness evinced more interest in the future fate of his eldest son Seyyid Mohammed than in that of the two younger sons. He was aware that the latter would combine to put aside Seyyid Mohammed, and seemed to take it fo r granted that Seyyid Eeysal and Seyyid Eahd would make good their position in 'Oman after his own decease; but I think His Highness also took it for granted that his sons would receive active support from the British Government.6 ADMINISTEATIOH REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 7 sevvid Abdul 'Azeez -bin-Sa'eed, a younger brother of the late Seyyid Turk 'has'for many years resided in Central'Oman m a straitened condition, Hving' in hopes of eventually sueeeeding to the Sultanate It was naturally expeeted that this aspirant would speedily appear in the field, and attack hw nephews. But ' the unexpected ' once more prevailed. Either from want of money or of the support of the Sharkiyah tribes, or from unknown causes, no movement of the sort has hitherto occurred, and, as time went on, the adherence nf Salih bin Ali El-Harthi and others, with absence of any opposition to Seyyld^Peysal, seemed to indicate that the latter was practically the elect of the people, and had thus fulfilled the conditions qualifying him for formal recogmtw^n as SnUan-n hy Seyyid Feysal against bis cousin Ibrahim-bin-Kais, its failure, and his failing to oome to or keep to terms with Ibrahim are circumstances which have damaged Seyyid Eeysa s prestige and weakened his position. He has further neglected to strengthen himself by gathering round him persons of weight, and seeking counsel of experienced advisers Erom his assumption of power until May 1889 His Highness appointed no one to be his Wazeer or Minister, transacting all business per- sonally or through writers of no standing. 9 Having visited Muscat in April 1889, it appeared to me that, owing to circumstances, such as above indicated, Seyyid Eeysal's position bad become more insecure than at the outset, and that his formal recognition had better be postponed. This alteration in the opinion previously expressed hy me was con sequent on information received at Muskat. 10. The death of Seyyid Turki is felt to be a misfortune to Oman; tor, altboueh his rule was by no means vigorous, he was well skilled in managing Arabs, and usually mild and liberal. His loyalty to the British Government was sincere and unswerving. Whatever his vacillations in other matters, fiom this nolicv he never departed, namely full trust in, and devotion to, the British ± J , ,, • J 1 TT™ IV/Tr\ci4'Tr nrmfpvnno' power. This well-known loyalty was recognized by Her Majesty conferring on His Highness in 1886 the Grand Cross of the Star of India, and at the same time the British Government undertook to afford him active support during his life-time, in case of insurrections and attacks on Muscat. This announce ment ensured the maintenance of peace at Muscat so long as Seyyid Turki should continue to reign, and makes his loss the more felt. 11. During his later years Seyyid Turki suffered much from ill-health, and his sufferings impairing his mind and judgment rendered him prone to superstition, and the painful suspicions arising therefrom embittered his last days. 2.-'OMAN PIRATE COAST. 12. Shaikh Hameyd bin Abdullah, El Jowasimi, continues to rule over this petty independent township, the most northern of Kas-ei-Khaimah. the six so-called ' Trucial ports.' The people of' Ras-el-Khaimah were during the year on bad terms with the tribes of El-Haboos and El-Shehooh, and several persons belonging to Ras-el-Khaimah were mur dered by their enemies in the outlying date plantations. The Haboos also de stroyed about two hundred date trees at Khat, a village under Shaikh Hameyd. 13. A vessel belonging to Has-el-Khaimah having been seized illegally by the Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas, representations were made to Persian authorities by the Residency, which led to the payment of compensation by the Deputy Governor. . 14. The only occurrence to be noticed is tne umm -ei-Kawam. death of Mohammed, son of Shaikh Ahmed -bin- Abdullah, Al-Bu-Ali, Chief of this district.EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1888-89. 15. Much animosity had existed for a considerable time between the Chief ' Ajman. j man j Shaikh Rashid-bin-Hameyd, Al-bu- Ali, and the Shargah Chief; but in the early part of 1889 the Chief of Debaye effected a reconciliation between 9 Ajman and Him- reeyah on the one side, and Shargah on the other. This mediation was due to, apprehension of an attack being made on the Hinawee Chiefs by Shaikh Jasim of El-Bidaa, and the desire of the Chief of Debaye to be in a position to draw succour from ' Ajman and Himreeyah in case of danger. 16. Shargah, in the centre of the group of^Trucial States,' is the head- Sliar ah * quarters of the Residency Agent on the Pirate Coast. The Chief is still Shaikh Sakar-bin-Khalid, El-Jowasimi. 17. Hostilities were on the point of breaking out between Shargah and 5 Ajman, and the Chief of Shargah engaged mercenaries on the Persian Coast and called on his friendly Bedouins to furnish a contingent to aid him. The war was, however, averted, and peace effected by the mediation of the Chief of Debaye. 18. Much excitement and discussion was caused on the Pirate Coast by the threatened invasion of ' Oman from Nejd and El-Katr. The Chief and inhabit ants generally of Shargah are Wahhabees in religion, and Shaikh Jasim of El- .Katr addressed communications to the Chief as if to a friendly neighbour on whose assistance he could count. 19. The Chief of Shargah in July informed the Residency Agent that he had received letters from Shaikh Jasim bin Mohammed Thani, announcing the approaching invasion of 'Oman by ' Ibn Easheed ' and e&lt; the Imam' Abdullah-bin-Feysal, and expressing hopes of receiving assistance from the Shargah and the other Ghafiree Shaikhs. Jasim again addressed the Chief of Shargah in November, requesting permission to land stores at Shargah for the use of the Nejdean Forces. The Chief was advised to excuse himself. 20. In the early part of the year much soreness existed between the Chiefs of Shargah and Debaye, but the latter eventually took alarm at the attitude of the Katr Shaikh and thought best to make it up with Shargah, and prevailed on the ex-Chief of Shargah, Salim-bin Sultan, to engage to refrain from in trigues against his nephew, the Chief of Shargab, in return for the restoration of the allowance he had formerly received from his nephew. Salim-bin-Sultan had, be it explained, proceeded to Debaye for the purpose of requesting the Chief of Debaye's aid in recovering- possession of Shargah. 21. Debaye, which is now the most populous port on the Pirate Coast, D ebaye . is ruled by Shaikh-Eashid-bin-Maktoom, of the Al-Bu-Falasa, a Hinawi clan. Although tribally connected with the Beniyas, in the early part of the year under review the Chief of Debaye appeared extremely hostile to Abu Dhabbi, and it was thought he was meditating a league with Shaikh Jasim against Shaikh Za'eed. It is probable that Shaikh Rashid was merely temporizing as regards Jasim's overtures, as latterly he has thrown his lot in with the Beniyas. In July Jasim sent the Debaye Chief a present of a mare, and wrote to assure him that neither he, (Jasim) nor the Turkish Government would molest Debaye, and that the divers of that place might visit El-Katr in safety. 22.^ Subsequently Shaikh Jasim wrote expressing his wish to visit Debaye. The Chief, having consulted me on the subject, was informed that I considered he would act unwisely to receive Jasim or to become involved in the affairs and schemes of that Shaikh, and he was recommended to make suitable excuses.8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 23. Shaikh Kashid in August visited Seyyid Peysal biu Turki at Muscat and received a present of a mare, arms, clothing, and Bupeea 1,500 cash. 24 Towards the end of 1888, Shaikh Bashid concluded an alliance wrth Ahu-Dhabhi, after which he received a letter from Shaikh Jasim, in which the latter threatened to invade the Debaye territory, and so fort . 25. The town of Abu-Dhabbi itself is smaller and less flourishing than the neighbouring ports of Debaye and Shargah, but the Abu-Dhabbi. Chief Shaikh Za'eed -bin-Khaleefah, the head of the numerous Benivas tribe, is the most important personage in Western 'Oman. The iurisdiction of this Chief extends along the southern shore of the Persian Gulf, as far as 'Odeyd, his western limits thus marching with those of El-Katr and El-Hasa, and numerous Bedouin clans ranging the plains between that frontier and El-Bereymi are dependents, or allies, of the Chief of Abu-Dhabhi. Some twelve years back quarrels commenced between the Shaikh of El-Katr, (Jasim -bin-Mohammed) and the Abu-Dhabbi Chief, and for the feud which sprang up, and subsequent bloodshed and plundering, I think Shaikh Jasim was chiefly to blame. During this period of years the contending parties and their dependent clans and allies have engaged in frequent raids and counter- raids, after the fashion of Arabs. 26. In March 1888 the Manaseer tribe, dependents of Shaikh Za'eed, suffered severely from a foray made by Jasim, and the Abu-Dhabbi Chief prepared to make reprisals on El-Katr. 27. In May Shaikh Za'eed sent a body of 250 Bedouins mounted on camels, under the leadership of Shaikh Mohammed-bin-Saif, and accompanied by the Chiefs son, Khaleefah-bin-Za'eed, to raid on El-Katr. This force sur- prised the followers of Shaikh Jasim in the vicinity of El-Bidaa, and slew up wards of thirty men, amongst whom was Ali-bin-Jasim, the favourite and most promising son of the Katr Shaikh. This occurrence has greatly embittered the feud, and frustrated any hopes of reconciliation between the rival Chiefs. 28. In the month of August Tahnoon, son of Shaikh Za'eed,.proceeded to Muscat on a visit to Seyyid Feysal, and accompanied His Highness during his expedition against Bostak. 29. Border warfare has continued in the stretch of low country between Katr and Abu-Dhabbi without any signal success to either side. The reports of the intended advance of a Wahhabi force from Jebel Shammar and Nejd towards 'Oman naturally caused apprehensions, but the Beuiyas Chief kept a bold front and was prepared to offer resistance. The alarm has passed away for the present, but the warfare between Katr and Abu-Dhabbi may possibly assume a more serious aspect in the near future. 30. The Chief of Abu-Dhabbi had cause to be displeased with the Na'eem Chief (Mohammed-bin-Ali of El-Bereymi), who failed to comply with a summons to arms and intimated his intention to submit to the expected invading force, and it was thought that Shaikh Za'eed would attack the Na'eem Shaikh. 31. In January, Shaikh Jasim personally led a force towards 'Oman and surprised and massacred a number of defenceless ride Katr. persons, including women and children. This has exasperated the Beniyas and their allies, who burn to be avenged on their Katr enemies. 3.—EL-BAHRAIN. 32. The most noteworthy event of the year in Bahrain was the death of Shaikh Ahmed-bin-Ali, younger and only brother of the Chief of Bahrain, from small-pox in the month of October. Shaikh Ahmed, in accordance with an old custom in Bahrain, enjoyed one-half of the revenues of the islands, and exercised a considerable amount of power and authority. He was a man ofRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR 1888-89. 9 some ability and strength of character, and his loss is calculated to weaken the hands of the Chief. Shaikh Ahmed was very fond of sport, and went on hunting excursions to the mainland every year. He was reputed sensual and somewhat harsh, and was more feared than liked. He has left a numerous progeny. 83. In June, Shaikh Jasim-hin-Mohammed Thani of El-Katr made over tures to the Shaikhs of Bahrain for a reconciliation with them, and Shaikh Esau consulted me on the subject. I recommended him to meet Shaikh Jasim's overtures in a friendly spirit, and not' to place difficulties in the way of a friendly understanding, provided it did not affect his own rights, interests, and obligations. Shaikh Jasim subsequently sent his son Abdullah to Bahrain, and terms of amity were vaguely arranged. 34. It is probable that Shaikh Jasim sought the friendship of the Bahrain Shaikhs because of his war with the Beniyas. He also probably wished to be once more in a position to place money in deposit in Bahrain for mercantile and other transactions. 35. Mohamed-bin-Khaleefah, uncle of Shaikh Esau, and for many years a political detenu at Aden, having been allowed to proceed to Mecca, intimated that he would no longer accept the allowance provided for him by the Chief of Bahrain, as he received an allowance from the Turkish Government, sufficient for his wants. 36. In Julypt was reported that the Turkish authorities of El-Hasa con templated rebuilding the town of Zobarah on the mainland opposite Bahrain, and establishing a military post there. It was stated by the Chief of Bahrain that Shaikh Jasim had permission from the Mutaserrif to commence building and was about to do so. 37. Shaikh Esau protested against the occupation of Zobarah by Jasim, on the ground of his ancient rights there, and of the menace to Bahrain which such a proceeding would involve. Government decided that both Shaikh Jasim and Nasir-bin-Mubarik might, if necessary, be warned that they could not be permitted to form a settlement at Zobarah. The project, however, was abandoned, and no further action became necessary. 38. In September, the Chief of Bahrain wrote to complain of the increase of disorder and insecurity on the sea, and dwelt on the inability of the Turkish Government to suppress piracy. The Chief alluded chiefly to the robberies of vessels in Turkish waters about El-Kateef. 39. In the spring of 1889 Mr. and Mrs. Theodore Bent arrived in the Gulf from England, having come out for the purpose of examining the ancient tumuli at Bahrain under the auspices of the British Museum. They received every assistance in carrying out their work from the Chief of Bahrain, and succeeded in excavating two of the largest tombs, but no inscriptions were found to fix the period of this ancient necropolis. 4. —EL -KATR. 40. The political condition of El-Katr continues to be unsatisfactory, but irregularities by sea were fewer than during the preceding year on that coast. 41. Owing to a severe defeat experienced by the followers of Shaikh Jasim at the hands of the forces of the Abu-Dhabbi Chief in the month of May 1888, in which affair Shaikh Jasim's favourite son, Ali, was slain, the energies of that notorious Shaikh have been mainly devoted to measures for avenging himself on the Beniyas and their dependants. 42. Jasim had himself headed a somewhat successful raid on the enemy in March; in which it is said he seized about 500 camels, which were distributed amongst his followers. c10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GUJiF POLITICAL 43. But in May a body of about 600 men, under Khaleefah bin Za'eed, son of the Beniyas Chief, arrived in the vicinity of El-Bidaa. The men of El-Bidaa appear to have sallied out to meet the invaders in scattered detachments, with- out order or discipline, and a feint retreat of the enemy led them irito an ambush, when they were attacked and put to rout, losing 34 men killed, includ ing Ali-bin-Jasim, and having many wounded. Shaikh Jasim was not present during the fight, being at his residence, Dha'ayan, and only arrived at El-Bidaa when the affair was over. 44. Between anger and grief. Shaikh Jasim became well-nigh distraught, and gave his whole mind to compassing his revenge upon the Abu-Dhabbi Chief and people. He addressed letters and messages to the Turkish authorities of Basrah and Hasa, appealing to their sense of honour, and pointing out the ad vantages they might reap from an invasion of 'Oman. He also wrote to certain persons in .Constantinople in the same sense, and applied to the powerful Chief of Jebel Shammar, Mahomed Ibn Rasheed, commonly known as ' Ibn Easheed J ,, for assistance against Shaikh Za'eed. Shaikh Jasim also commenced to spend money freely in purchase of arms, provisions, and in subsidizing Arab tribes. 45. It appeared at first that these measures would lead to important results. The action of the Porte and Turkish local authorities cannot be stated, but ' Ibn Basheed ' freely promised to lead or despatch a force into 'Oman, and his advance in the cool weather was fully expected. It is probable that the communications made by Her Majesty's Government to the Porte led to the abandonment of the project. At all events Shaikh Jasim's sanguine hopes have ended so far in disappointment, and lie has been unable to strike any signal blow at Abu-Dhabbi. In Eebruary of this year, indeed, Jasim led a raiding expedition and succeeded in surprising some unfortunate Arabs, said to be dependants of Shaikh Za'eed, at Leewah, and a number of these, including some women and children, were put to the sword in a very merciless and bar barous manner. 46. The Beniyas of course prepared to despatch a retaliatory expedition, but hitherto no serious engagements have occurred. 47. In 1888 the Sublime Porte addressed a complaint to Her Majesty's Government regarding the coercive measures adopted against Shaikh Jasim to obtain redress for his ill-treatment of British subjects, &amp;c. In reply, the Porte was informed that Her Majesty's Government approved of the proceedings in question, and could not admit the right of the Porte to interfere in the matter. 48. During the summer of 1888 the Turkish detachment at El-Bidaa was increased to about 250 regular infantry,- and a Turkish steam-launch has been placed at that port. 49. Two serious irregularities by sea occurred off the coast of El-Katr: One was the plunder of a Bahrain vessel close to El-Bidaa, and the other the deli berate murder of two men of the tribe Amamerah, residents of Bahrain, by a number of the Al-bu-Kawarah tribe of El-Katr, in pursuance of a blood feud. The piracy case was settled between the Chief of Bahrain and Shaikh Jasim on their coming to a friendly understanding, but the Al-bu-Kawarah have still to be brought to account. 50. In October I proceeded to El-Bidaa in Her Majesty's Ship Sphinx, and had an interview with Shaikh Jasim, who seemed chiefly intent upon retaliating on Abu-Dhabbi, but promised to respect the maritime peace and neutrality. 5.—NEJD AND EL-HASA. 51. In the report for the preceding year it was stated that, under the auspices and support of Mahomed Ibn Basheed, Amir of Jebel Shammar,RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR 1888-89. 11 Abdullah-bin-Feysal had been re-instated as Governor of Eiadh, and his nephews, the sons of Sa'ood-bin-Feysal, had been compelled to retire to El- Khorj, An a^ent of Ibn Rasheed, howeyer, was placed at Eiadh, and was practically Governor of that part of Nejd on the part of the Jebel Shammar Amir, whose power was now established over all Nejd. Abdullah-bin-Feysal, who is connected by marriage with Ibn Easheed, proceeded to Hayil and took up his residence there, his brother Mohammed residing at Eiadh as nominal Chief. 52. In the month of August 1888 three of the sons of Su'ood-bin-Feysal, namely] Mohammedj Saad, and Abdullah, were put to death in El-Khorj by Ibn Nebhan, the agent of Ibn Easheed. Accounts vary as to the reason for this massacre, but it seems probable that their uncle (Abdulla-bin-Feysal) instigated the murder of these princes. The eldest, Mohammed-bin-Su'ood, was much beloved in Nejd on account of his chivalrous and liberal disposition. Eor months the Bedouin Arabs refused to. credit the news of his death, and rumours were everywhere prevalent that Mohammed had escaped, and was living amongst Bedouins in the desert. Only one son of Su'ood survives, Abdul Azeez, and he is residing at Hayil, as is also his uncle, Abdullah-bin Eeysal, now styled the ' Imam'' in Nejd. 53. The power of Mohammed Ibn Easheed is now paramount throughout Nejd from the confines of Syria to El-Hasa. In the time of the Amir of Nejd Eeysal-bin-Toorkee, Abdullah-in-Easheed, father of the present Amir of Shammer, was appointed ' Muhafidh,' or warden of the frontier, by the Wahhabee Chief, and, later, Mohammed Ibn Easheed was befriended by Abdullah-bin-Eeysal, and owes to the latter his accession to power in Hayil. Now, owing chiefly to family dissensions, the Wahhabee princes have lost their authority, and the relative positions have completely changed. Appendix a. ^ sketch of the family history of the Jebel Shammer Chief will be found appended. 55. During the summer much apprehension existed of an invasion of 'Oman being undertaken by Ibn Easheed, and he had in fact promised Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mohammed Thani to march eastwards in the cool season, and sent summonses to the various Arab tribes, but, as has been .mentioned, for' some reason the design was abandoned. 36. The Wali of Busrah, Nafiz Pasha, having been relieved by Hedayet Pasha, the Mutaserrif of Hasa, Rufat Beg, has also been removed and has been succeeded by Akif Pasha, a Military Officer. 57. Several robberies of native vessels, as usual, took place in the shallow waters about El-Kateef, but of late there have been fewer complaints. 58. The attempt to establish a commercial port at Darain, near El-Kateef, which was mentioned in last report, has not proved successful. 6.--FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. 59. His Eoyal Highness the Ihtesham Ed-Dowlah, Governor of the Central Districts of Ears, has succeeded to the title held by his late father, namely ' Motemed-Ed-Dowlah.' 60. His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk remains Governor of Bushire and of the Persian Coast of the Gulf, and the districts of Dashtistan, Tangistan, and Dashti have been under Prince Nowzer Mirza. Nejif Koolee Khan was appointed Agent at Bushire for the Persian Foreign Office. 61. In July the new Oriental Bank Corporation opened a branch bank at Bushire, one having been previously established at the capital. 62. The Eoyal Proclamation issued by the Shah promising respect for the liberties and rights of his people, and permitting the formation of companies, c 212 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL &amp;C., for the improvement of roads, commerce, &amp;c., was posted at the principal telegraph stations. The effects of this measure are not yet palpable, hut, owing chiefly to increased intercourse with Europeans and interchange of ideas with them, there-is a gradual amelioration of the condition of the people in progress, and the Eoyal Proclamation* is a sign of the times * Appendix B ' at all events, and may yet bear fruit. 63. The French Government have established a Vice-Consulate atBushire, and M. Piat has been nominated to fill the post. 64. The Dutch Government have decided to withdraw their Consulate from Bushire. 65. Exportation of grain from Persian ports was prohibited from 5tli December 1.888 by notification from Tehran. 66. In March a British merchant steamer, the Transition, got aground oil the island of Kais,' and much trouble was experienced from the rapacity, of the Governor of Charak and Kais. H. M.'s S. Kingfisher proceeded to the spot and rendered timely assistance. The Transition floated undamaged and proceeded on her voyage, but the conduct of the Persian Governor of Cliarak will become the subject of discussion. 67. In several districts of Ears an epidemic disease of a severe type has destroyed large numbers of the cattle; in some places, it is said, nine-tenths of the oxen and cows died, causing much distress. 68. Mirza Mohammed Ali, who was formerly Eoreign Ofiice Agent at Bunder Abbas, was appointed Deputy Governor of Lingah. The Persian troops were withdrawn from that town and the Arab Shaikh Kadheeb, formerly Deputy Governor, was sent in chains to Tehran from Bushire. 69. A disturbance occurred in Lar between a body of Kashkais and inhabitants of Lar, in which affair many lives were lost on both sides. 70. Shaikh Ibrahim, who was formerly Chief of Kishm, and who was taken to Tehran as a prisoner, has been released and allowed to return to Kishm. 71. Mohammed Hasan Beg was re-appointed Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas, and the Persian troops have been mostly withdrawn from that place, as well as from Lingah. 72. Captain Tate, Bengal Cavalry, was deputed by the Government of India to buy mules and donkeys in Persia, and visited Shiraz and Ispahan. At the latter place he succeeded in purchasing over three hundred animals of a suitable kind, and at moderate prices. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 73. In the month of October 1888 the Persian Government intimated to Her Majesty's Minister at the Court of Persia that His Majesty the Shah had decided to open the river Karun as far as Ahwaz to the commerce of the world, under certain regulations and conditions, which Appendix c. would be intimated and published later on. A translation of these rules will be found appended. 74. Simultaneously with the above intimation, orders were despatched to the Governor of Arabistan, the Nizam-es-Saltanah, to allow the passage of commercial steamers and sailing vessels of all friendly powers between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. Above Ahwaz the right of navigation was reserved to the Persian Government, 75. A steam-launch, belonging to Messrs. Gray, Mackenzie &amp; Co., was immediately despatched from Busrah to Ahwaz, as pioneer, and to estab lish the right of way; and Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co.'s river steamer Blosse LynohRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1888-89. 13 followed, and has since continued to ply (necessarily at a heavy loss) about' once a fortnight. 76. The Persian authorities have placed a small river steamer of their own, named the Susa, on the Upper Karun, but it is not a suitable vessel, and it is badly managed. A new stern-wheel steamer has reached Busrah, and will eventually be placed on the upper river. 77. Meantime Messrs. Lynch &amp; Oo.'s agent has obtained the consent of the Persian authorities to employ native craft through Persian agency, and cargo is forwarded in that way between Ahwaz and Shushter. 78. During the winter a Commission of Persian Surveying Officers, the chief of whom was the Nejm -ul-Mulk, was sent from Tehran to Arabistan to report on the repairs necessary to roads and other works, including the proposed reconstruction of the dam at Ahwaz, for purposes of irrigation. This Commis sion has returned to Tehran. 79. In January, Mirja Kazim Khan, Sirteep, was appointed to reside at Mohammerah as agent for the Persian Eoreign Office, and an official was posted to Ahwaz to exercise similar functions under the Ameen-es-Sultan's Depart ment. 80. Some mat-huts have been erected at Ahwaz for storing goods, and these were let to Messrs. Lynch's agent at a rent of 600 krans a month, from which fact it will be gathered that the Persian officials hope for good results from the opening of the Karun. 81. Materials have been collected for the' construction of warehouses, „ wharfs, &amp;c., at Mohammerah, and substantial * The post below the dam of Ahwaz is now named«Bander-i-Na- buildings are to be erected at Ahwaz,^ wuere an Biri ' agent of Messrs. Lynch &amp; Co. is residing. 82. It will be seen that, owing to the prompt manner in which the conces sion was acted on, real progress has, in the course of a few months, been made towards opening up the new route for traffic. The difficulties which have to be encountered and surmounted can only be realized by those on the spot. The utmost patience, perseverance, and tact are required in dealing with them, and the results already obtained are creditable to the agents employed. 83. In connection with the opening of the Karun, it was considered useful to examine the Bahmishir river, which formed the old channel of the Karun, and in December the Eesidency Steamer Lawrence ascended the Bahmishir for about 20 miles. Subsequently, Captain Butter worth descended from Moham merah to the sea by the Bahmishir in a launch and took soundings. This river is navigable for some 30 miles from its mouth by ocean steamers of light draught; but the channel leading to the mouth is tortuous, and there is a shallow sand-bank to be crossed to reach it. 84. In the spring of 1888 the Bakhtiyari country was in a very disturbed state, and the disorders spread partially to Arabistan. 85. The Bakhtiyari Chief, Hazi Imam Kooli Khan, having been deposed from the post of Eel-Khani, refused to recognize his brother, Reza Kooli Khan, who was appointed Eel-Khani by the Persian authorities, and prepared to oppose the Persian forces. 86. The Nizam-es-Saltanah marched from Ispahan with a force, accom panied by Hazi Eeza Kooli Khan, Eel-Khani, and Isfandiyar Khan, son of the late well-known Eel-Khani, Hazi Husain Kooli Khan (Isfandiyar Khan had been appointed Eel-Begi of the Bakhtiyari's), and attacked and defeated Imam Kooli Khan, who was eventually forced to surrender. Decorations were be stowed on the Nizam-es-Saltanah and Beza Kooli Khan, and Isfandiyar Khan was honored with the title of &lt;s Samsam-es-Saltanah.'' These events led to the restoration of tranquillity in the Bakhtiyari country and Arabistan.u ADMINISTRATION REPORT OP THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 87. Shaikh Mozel Khan, Governor of Mohammerah, was confirmed-in that post for the current year, and received the title of ' Mu'azz-es-Saltanah,' but this and the various visits of the Persian Governors have cost him 20,000 tomans beyond the ordinary payments on account of revenue, 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 88. The new Governor of the Persian Gulf littoral, the Saad-ul-Mulk, brought in his detenus from Tehran—the two Baluch Shaikhs of Jask, Meer Abdul Nubbi and Meer Ali, whose seizure and imprisonment was mentioned in the Annual Report for 1888-87. Meer Ali was released and allowed to return to his home, but Abdul Nubbi was detained at Bunder Abbas. 89. Shaikh Ibrahim of Kishm, who had also been seized by the Maleket Too jar, has also been released, and has returned to his native place. 90. A guard of twenty Persian Serbaz has recently been placed at Jask. 91. The cases of plunder and ill-treatment of Hindu traders in Persian Baluchistan alluded to in the last report have been settled by payment of compensation by the Persian Governor, Abul Path Khan Sirteep. Credit is due to Mr. Pfinch for this result, which was only possible with the powerful and energetic support and action of Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 92. In July, it was reported that a party of Piinds, under one Nawab, had attacked and plundered a caravan in Persian territory. It is understood that Mr. Crawford, who personally inquired into Rind outrages at Mand, succeeded in getting hold of Nawab, who was residing in Baho. 93. The Persian districts of Baluchistan have, on the whole, enjoyed tranquillity. 9.—APPOINTMENTS, ESTABLISHMENTS, &amp;e. 94. Captain C. W.

NOTES ON THE ' IBN RASHEED ' FAMILY OF JEBEL SHAMMER, AND PRESENT POSITION OF MOHAMMED 'IBN RASHEED.' The works of Mr. Palgrave and of Mr. and Lady Anne Blunt have rendered the names of Jebel Shammer and its capifal, Hayil^ familiar to. many readers of travel, and in the past year a more elaborate book was published by Mr. C. Doughty, containing a very full description of Central Arabia, and much valuable information. Indeed, Mr. Doughty's book must take rank as the standard English work on Arabia of modern times. Mr. Palgrave visited Hayil about 15 years ago, when Telal ; eldest brother of the present Chief, was Emir. Mr. Doughty travelled in Arabia from 1876 to 1878,and the Blunts in 1879. Since the latter date the power of ' Ibn Rasheed ' has been extended, and is now paramount in Nejd. The word ' Neid,' as is well known, means ' high ' or f^ table-land/ , and according to Arabian geographers the region so named comprised all Central Arabia from Hejaz to 'Irak. Whilst the power of the Wahhabi Emirs lasted, El-Hasa was, in a political sense, a portion of Nejd, and now that a Turkish Governor resides in El-Hasa that Turkish administration is called by the Turks the ' Government of Nejd.' At one period, it may be, Nejd was held to mean the provinces ruled by the Wahhabi; but, however that may be, the name should now be regarded as a geographical expression, including in its scope Jebel Shammer and all the prov inces of Central Arabia lying within the tracts of red-sand deserts [ Dahna or Nefood ]. The Shammer tribe which is connected with the Kahtan has risen to importance in Nejd. within the last half century. Some sixty years back the family of the Shaikhs of the Sham mer was divided into rival branches,' the Al-'Ali and the A'l-Rasheed. A contest for supre- premacy, as usual, occurred, which ended in the extermination of 'Al-'Ali, and Abdallah-Ibn ■'Ali-lbn Rasheed became Shaikh of the Shammer, with Hayil for his residence, circa 1835 A.D. It is said that*Abdallah succeeded through the aid of the Wahhabi Emir, Feysal Ibn Toorkee. He had also a staunch and able supporter in his brother 'Obeyd. 'Abdallah Ibn Rasheed, as he was commonly called, a man of rare ability^ inaugurated the policy which, followed by his successors, has led to the establishment of the supremacy of the Shammer Chief over a large portion of Central Arabia. By the Wahhabi Emir, 'Abdallah was nominated ' Muhafidh,' or' Warden of the Marches,' and thus was in the position of a Frontier Governor under the Wahhabi, Jebel Shammer at that epoch being a province of the Wahhabi Empire. Until his death 'Abdallah-Ibn Rasheed remained a vassal of the Wahhabi Emii*. In the year 1846 Abdallah Ibn Rasheed died, and was succeeded by his eldest son Tilal, whose name became so well-known through the eulogies of Palgrave. Tilal became wholly independent of the Wahhabi Chiefs of Riadh, and governed with consummate skill and caution until A.D. 1867, when, tortured by some internal malady, perhaps fearing loss of reason, he committed suicide by shooting himself. Tilal was succeeded by his brother Muta J Ab-Ibn 'Abdallah, who lacked the prudence and skill of Tilal, and behaved harshly to his nephews, the sons of the latter. Two of these nephews, Bandar and Bedr, conspired against Muta' Ab and succeeded in putting him to death in the year 3868 A.D. ^ • Bandar-Ibn-Tilal then assumed the reins of Government at Hayil. At that time Mohammed Ibn Abdallah, younger brother of Tilal, and now Emir, was residing at Riadh as a fugitive, and was kindly treated by the Wahhabi Emir Abdallah-Ibn Feysal, who effected a sort of reconciliation between Mohammed and his nephew Bandar. Mohammed became the leader of pilgrims, and it was when entering Hayil in that capacity that he suddenly stabbed his nephew Bandar to death. This event, which occurred in 1868, was immediately followed up by the slaughter of all the remaining children of Tilal, and Mohammed Ibn Abdallah, or, as he is now generally called, ' Ibn Rasheed,' became Emir and Muhafidh in Hayil. A full account of the circumstances attending the accession of the present Emir is given by Mr. Doughty in his work Travels in Arabia Deserta.'16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL The reigning e&lt; Ibn Rasheed ' is said to be now about fifty years old and vigorous. jj e has the misfortune^ for such it is accounted^ to be childless, but he is on the best terms with his able cousin Hamood Ibn Obeyd and that branch of the family, and Hamood is at present the most likely successor. The Government of Mohammed Ibn Rasheed is firm and popular ; his subjects boast of it as the best in the world. He may be reproached by enemies as the slayer of his kin, but by tha majority of the townspeople he is respected and feared, and .the security and prosperity enjoyed under his rule ^certainly appreciated. As to foreign policy Mohammed Ibn Rasheed has hitherto shown the same prudence and circumspection as his predecessors. His neighbours are the Turks on one side, and the Ibn Su'ood princes on the other. After years of fit-ful warfare Ibn Rasheed has crushed his 'Wahhabi rivals and established his supremacy over Bl-Ared. The slaughter of the sons of Su^ood in Khorj last year is recounted in another place, and the partizans of the Al-»Su'ood appear to be utterly crushed. Ibn Rasheed is fully aware how necessary it is to ' menager ' the Turkish Government, and some semblance of recognition of the suzerainty of that power is accorded, but the small tribute paid to the Shereef of Medina may be regarded as having more a religious than a political significance. At the present time Ibn Rasheed wields paramount power from the confines of Syria to El-Hasa, which is the residence of a Turkish Governor. An Agent of his resides at Riadh, and is virtually the Governor, but, with the caution of his race, Ibn Rasheed has not wholly dismissed the Wahhabi family from the scene. Perhaps out of gratitude for former aid, perhaps from other motives, Abdallah-bin-Feysal is still honored by Ibn Rasheed with the title of Imam, that is to say, religious head of the Wahhabi sect of Mohammedans. It may be regarded as almost certain that Ibn Rasheed will not undertake any important enterprize without full deliberation or without making sure of the approval of the Sublime Porte. E. C.

JPolitical. —At the commencement of the official year there were slight internal disturbances in' Oman. In April an affray took place between the Hikman and Yal Bede tribes near Barkah, regarding an old boundary dispute, in which six lives were lost. Peace was speedily restored between the two tribes by a deputation sent from Muscat by His Highness the Sultan. A demonstration was also made by Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir at the head of 500 men against Manh, but the fort being well-guarded, the expedition failed, and Shaikh Hilal returned to Nezwa without having attained any political object. Reports from Sohar stated that the Shahook and the Nakbieen tribes, whilst on their way to attack the forts of Dibba and Kore Eakkan, were oppos ed by the Sharkieen and Sultan-bin-Muhammad, the encounter resulting in the death of 13 men of the Sharkieen. No action was taken by the Sultan in regard to the above quarrel. In May, His Highness Seyyid Turki took an important step in the dis missal of his Minister Sayyid Sa'eed-bin-Muhammad, being convinced that his long -continued ill-health was due to sorcery practised by his Wazir, although assured by Dr. Jayakar that his disease was in no way connected with that art. Attempts at a reconciliation failed, and finally Seyyid Sa'eed, who stated that he went in fear of his life from the Sultan, was ordered to quit the neigh bourhood and left in a native boat for the island of Kishm. It appears that the dismissal of his minister was owing tp no sudden change in tlie Sultan's feelings towards him. Dislike and distrust had been growing in Seyyid Turki's mind for -some years past. Matters were in this position at the death of His Highness Seyyid Turki, which occurred on 4th June 1888. Dr. Jayakar, who was then in charge of the Agency, reported as follows :— The late Sultan had been suffering from chyluria for many years, and although for a long time the disease was in abeyance, the last relapse of the disease, which proved to be a serious and a continuous one, came on about a year ago. He never recovered from this attack, and about the end of April, owing to the great weakness caused by the disease, he had to take to his bed. On 15th May, owing to repeated attacks of syncope and palpitation, he was in such a critical state that I bad to telegraph to you.* - After Resident. your departure from Muscat on 23rd May he seemed to improve a little, but the improvement was only of 'a temporary nature and the weakness con- tiaued to increase, although almost to the last moment he was able to conduct the affairs of the State. Besides this. His Highness suffered from other chronic diseases, and his health therefore had been in a precarious state for several years. 0 The death of Seyyid Turki was fortunately not followed by disturbances of any kind in Muscat, although it was considered advisable to take precautionary measures with regard to British subjects owing to the- possibility of an out break. The position of Sultan was forthwith assumed by Seyyid Feysal, the second son of Seyyid Turki, who wrote to the officiating Political Agent, desiring a continuance of the friendly relations which existed between the British Govern ment and his father, and praying for their protection and favour. Seyyid Eey-24 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL sal received letters from the most important Chiefs in J Oman, containing p ro , fessions of friendship and good-will towards him, and the news of his accession seems to have been favourably received throughout the Province. A week after Seyyid Turki's death, Colonel Ross, Resident in the Persian Gulf, arrived in the Lawrence and paid a visit of condolence to the three sons of the late Sultan, which they returned the following day. Colonel Poss left Muscat the same evening. About the end of June Seyyid Sa'eed, the ex-Minister, having heard of Seyyid Turki's death, returned from Kishm. This action was strongly dis approved of by Seyyid Feysal who deputed his brother, Seyyid Pahad, to meet Seyyid Sa'eed on landing, with instructions that the latter was to consider himself under restraint during his stay in Muscat. Seyyid Sa'eed thus virtu ally became a prisoner in his own house. He was shortly afterwards compelled to leave the place, and started for Bunder Abbas on 1st July. During the month of June there were some slight intertribal disturbances in the district, but these were not dependent on the events taking place at Muscat. In July, four Banians arrived from Burkah with a complaint that they had been assaulted by a party of Beni Jabir whilst drawing water at Burkah. The case was represented to His Highness the Sultan, and an enquiry resulted in the imprisonment at Muscat of the. ringleaders of the offending party. A proposal was made by His Highness to collect ' Zekat' (taxes) from purchasers, on produce arriving from the interior at coast-towns. This, being contrary to treaty, was disallowed. Eighting again occurred at Burkah between the Yal Bede and Hikman tribes, in which six men on each side were killed. A fight also took place in the Wadis, Ghafir and Shatan between the Ghafree tribes, Meyayihah and Ibriyeen, in which some 50 men were killed and an equal number taken pri soners. Peace was restored by the mediation of Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis, of Rostak. * • In August His Highness Seyyid Abdul Aziz wrote to the Political Agent, stating that he felt himself called upon and impelled to reform the Province of 'Oman by force of arms, and enquiring whether the British Government would assist him in his plan of reformation and conquest. He added that, if he could rely on the support of the British Government, he could, no doubt, mature his schemes 'easily and without bloodshed,' This letter was referred to the Resident at Bushire, and under his orders Seyyid Abdul Aziz was to be inform ed that he had already been made acquainted with the views of Government, and that no other amplification thereof seemed necessary. Letters were received from the Wali and towshfolk of Awabee, the former stating that the latter were in league with an agent of Seyyid Ibrahim-bin- Keis, named Ibrahim-bin-Sa'eed, to' deliver up the place to him. The Wali stated that he had frustrated this design by his watchfulness and had destroyed the watercourses of the townspeople by way of punishment. The people, on the other hand, complained that they had been unjustly punished, and that the story had been invented by the Wali out of spite towards Ibrahim-bin-Sa'eed, who had been imprisoned. Seyyid Eeysal sent orders to the 'Wali of Nakhl to proceed to Awabee to enquire into the affair, and directed that the people should be allowed to re pair their watercourses. About this time a fight occurred at Khasab between the Kumzar and the Beni Hideeyah. Seyyid Peysal deputed his brother Seyyid Pahad, Seyyid Bede-bm-Seif and Sheikh Shamis-bin-Hasan to settle the quarrel. The de-RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1888-89. 25 putation proceeded to Eas-el- Klieimali in the JSultanee on 23rd August and returned to Muskat on 29tli idem, bringing as prisoners four Sheikhs of the Kumzar and three of the Beni Hideeyah, who, on arrival, were confined in Eort Jellali. Meanwhile, news had been received that Seyyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis was on the point of starting to seize Awabee. Seyyid Feysal wrote to the Ibriyeen to defend Awabee, and to the Wali of Nakhl to give any assistance in his power. The Ibriyeen, however, had been gained over by Ibrahim-bin-Keis, and re mained aloof from the struggle. Awabee fell on 2nd September after a stout resistance, in which the son of the Akeed Ali-bin-Seif El-Ibree was killed. On hearing of this, Seyyid Feysal determined on an expedition against Eostak, the stronghold of Seyyid Ibrahim, and wrote to the tribes to assemble at Burkah. War materiel was despatched in the Dar as salami under Seyyid Hamad -bin-Nasir and an escort of Arabs to reinforce the garrison at Burkah. Seyyid Ibrahim had written by this time to explain his seizure of Awabee. He stated that the inhabitants had asked him, to expel the Governor for his oppression towards them, and, as he considered Awabee to be one of his own forts, he had acceded. It seems that Awabee had originally been held in his interests by the Ibriyeen, who had afterwards delivered it over to the late Sultan. On 18th September, accordingly. His Highness started for Burkah in his steamer the Sultanee, accompanied by his brother Seyyid Muhammad, Sheikh Tahnoon-bin-Za'eed-bin-Khalifah of Abu-Dhabbi and all the principal Al-bu-Sa'eedees of Muscat, except Seyyids Hilal and Muhammad-bin-Azzan # The expedition, however, proved a failure. Almost from the first there was defection in Seyyid Eeysal's army, the Chiefs with him preferring to try and arrange a peace between him and Seyyid Ibrahim to fighting. Want of money to pay the troops further operated to this end. It appears that, on landing at Burkah, His Highness proceeded to Washeyl near Rostak, where the people of the surrounding country tendered their submission to him. A fight took place between the two forces which resulted in Seyyid Feysal establishing him self in the Mizarse bastion, after which he proceeded to shell the fort of Eostak. The Yal Saad tribe had in the meantime risen, and were attacking Scyyid Peysal's line of communications with the sea. This led to a request that Her Majesty's Ship Turquoise might be sent to the Batinah Coast to make a counter-demon stration, which, however, was not acceded to. The Sultan's army now became completely disaffected, refusing to fight any longer, and Seyyid Peysal was compelled to make peace. His Highness returned to Muskat on 17th October, after a fruitless absence of a month, and Awabee remained in the hands of Seyyid Ibrahim, to whom also hopes appear to have been held out for the renewal of the subsidy enjoyed by him during Seyyid Turki's life-time. In December, the Yal Saad, who rose against Seyyid Feysal during the Rostak expedition, sent messengers to Muskat to ask pardon for their action. His Highness accepted the apology and pardoned the tribe. A letter was received by His Highness the Sultan from Sheikh Saleh-bin- Ali and Joomah-bin-Saeed, in which it was proposed that Seyyid Abdul Aziz should be sent to the East Coast of Africa, there to assist the local tribes in repelling the advances of the Germans in that quarter. Such a course, if successful, they said, would result in honour and fame to the Sultan, and even, if not successful, the absence of Abdul Aziz from 'Oman would be ensured. The writer suggested that, if necessary, the British Government should be consulted on the point. Seyyid Feysal replied in very short and decisive terms that he did not care to entertain the proposal for a moment, and that SeyyidADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Abdul Aziz was well aware of the terms offered him, viz. that he should receire a subsidy from the Sultan on condition of residing in India. Reports were received in Muscat during the month of a contemplated rising of the Nejdean tribes against 'Oman. This expedition was to be con ducted by Ibn Hasheed in conjunction with Sheik Jasim-bin-Thani of El-Bidaa and to be on a larger scale than any hitherto attempted. Nothing, however occurred to disturb the general tranquillity of the Province. No further events of importance occurred before the close of the official year.

The hopes of an abundant harvest entertained at the early part of 1888 were realized, and, on the whole, there was an undoubted improvement ob servable in trade at the Persian ports. Froduce, Large shipments of wheat and barley were made up to October, when the Persian Government re-imposed an embargo, which, however, was imperfectly maintained. The Persian wheat raised was of good quality, but the quantity of barley mixed with it before reaching the market was often excessive, amounting in some cases to 50 per cent. The export trade in wheat was unusually profitable owing to a certain degree of failure of English and European crops which caused a rapid advance of prices in the Home markets,—10 to 13 per quarter. As this rise was more slowly felt in Persian markets, early shipments realized handsome profits. Wheat was chiefly shipped to London, but a portion went to India and the Red Sea. The English and other merchants in Bushire engaged in the grain exportation trade consider that the imposition of embargo in October was unnecessary, and complained that this measure unduly crippled and ham pered trade, generally to the advantage of the few, who evaded the prohibition or reaped a profit therefrom in other ways. This alleged evil of constant re currence, is, however, a most difficult one to deal with, and it cannot be advan tageously discussed in a public report. At the commencement of 1889 the prospects for the current year as re gards the grain trade were good; a considerable portion of the last crop remained in the country, and there was every hope of a good harvest in 1889. Unfortunately later on, the rainfall was so scanty as to cause a partial failure of crops, and in April the Persian Government announced a prohibition on the export of grain owing to scarcity. The opium crop of Central Persia was an average one. The London market being stagnant throughout the. year, the bulk of the 1888 crop was shipped to Hong-Kong, where in July and August a marked advance in prices occurred, and the early shipments returned good profits. Later in the year large shipments of the drug from India lowered prices in China. The export trade of tobacco seems to suffer check Tobacco * from fall in prices in Syria. It is well known how the recent wars in the Soudan and isolation of those tracts have affected the supply of gum. The effects of this are now being felt in Persia, where gum is now being extensively collected from the wild almond, ' gavan,' and other shrubs and trees, and measures are being taken to prevent the whole sale destruction of such woods. Eirewood and charcoal are consequently expected to become scarcer and dearer in Persia, and Bushire has received some supplies of the latter article from Karachi of late. E 128 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The ordinary description of Persian wool exported is coarse and uncleaned Woo] A well-informed firm in BusMre calculate that 3,125,000 pounds of wool are annually exported from South and South-TTestern Persia, of which about a quarter goes to Bombay and the rest to Busrah, where it is cleaned and mixed with superior sorts fro^ Baghdad and thence shipped to Prance, England, and America. The quantity of Persian wool thus exported is considered small for the area, but of course a -considerable quantity is taken up in the manufacture of carpets, felts, and other stuffs. Steamers and Freights. The number of steamers employed in the Gulf trade was, owing to the abundance of grain, large, and freights which were low in the early part of the year rose to 40s. and upwards to London. Imports. The improvement in this trade which was observed at the close of the year 1887 became more marked in the opening months of 1888. Assurance of a good harvest caused a more hopeful feeling in the bazaars, and stocks of goods which importers, especially in districts affected by previous failure of crops, had found difficulty in selling began to move off more quickly, but owing to high rate of exchange (krans 37 to 374 £) profits, if any, were small, and in mauy instances losses were sustained. This activity lasted until the hot weather, when the usual slackness recurred and demands for goods fell off considerably. In August however, improvement set in and sales were made on a larger scale and at higher prices, but not sufficiently high to compensate the &lt; importers for the increased prices ruling in Manchester, owing to the action of the cotton ring. Exchange, however, became more favourable, having fallen to krans 34 so the position of importers became more satisfactory. In evidence of the im- provement of this trade in 1888, it is noticed that failures were few and insigni ficant. No doubt, the alleged scarcity of grain in the present year will un- favourably affect this import trade. As a rule, Manchester goods hold their place and the tendency has been to receive more costly goods, but at Bunder Abbas, Russian red chintz has superseded that formerly imported from India, the traders alleging that they obtain an equally good stuff at cheaper rates from Russia. The Copper Syndicate having succeeded in maintaining prices at Home at copper. a kigh level, profitable import was impossible, and the stocks on hand in Persia appear sufficient to meet present demands. Large consignments of sugar continued to arrive from Marseilles, Persian Loaf sugar. merchants being the principal importers, owing to the fact that the scale of duty in force for native merchants in this article is more favourable for them than foreigners' rates. The prices have been low. An active competition has been going on in the markets of Bushire and Petroleum. Busrah between the Russian and American oils, both descriptions being imported from Bombay and Karachi by native merchants. The cheapness of the Russian oil enables it to compete against the superior American qualities. During the past year a cargo of American oil was run direct from New York and landed at Bushire and Busrah.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1888-89. 29 Banking Agencies. A remarkable feature in the history of Persian trade was the establishment of banking agencies in Persia in the year 1888. A branch of the New Oriental Bank Corporation has been established in the capital, and another in Bushire. It is thought that this measure will supply a much-felt want and tend to the advantage of trade interests. Opening of the Karun River to Navigation. The most important event of the year was undoubtedly the consent of the Persian Government to throw open the Eiver Karun, as far as Ahwaz, to vessels of all nationalities. The ulterior object is of course to develope the shorter route for traffic between the sea and Central and Northern Persia, and at the same time to open up to trade the grain-growing districts contiguous to that route. The project in itself is feasible and promising, but its success must largely depend on the measures adopted by the Persian Government to improve roads and secure their safety, to remove undue restrictions and taxation and allow commerce fair play generally. The route was promptly inaugurated by Messrs. Lynch fy Co. running their Steamer Blosse Lynch between Busrah and Ahwaz experimentally. The arrangements for traffic above the bund of Ahwaz are hitherto unsatisfactory, and organization is required. Persian merchants of Shiraz have taken alarm at the inauguration of a new trade route which, they represent, will injuriously affect that town. The success of the Karun route will doubtless cause some redistribution of trade in Persia, but it may safely be predicted that the general prosperity of the country will be increased, and there is no good reason to suppose that the Province of Pars will suffer exceptionally. Pearl Fisheries. The pearl-dinng season of 1888 was successful. Pearls were exported from Bahrain and the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf to the value of about B60 5 00,000, being about R10,00 5 000 in excess of the export in 1887. In this rough calculation the exports from Lingah are not counted, as the yield of the Arab Coast and Islands is mostly included in the Lingah exporta tion. E. C.

Paet I.— general summary. 1—OMAN-MUSCAT STATE. The Annual Report o£ the Muscat Political Agency for the past year has been prepared by Surgeon-Major A. S. Gr. Jayakar, and forms Part II of this compilation. It may be convenient to add here that His Highness Seyyid Feysal-bin- Turki was, on the 6th of April 1890, formally recognized as Sultan and ruler of the Muscat State, under orders of the Government of India. 2.— OMAN-PIRATE COAST. During the year, a coalition was formed by the Chiefs of Shargah, Umm- , ^ v el-Kawain, and Ras-el-Khaimah in opposition to Ras-el-K-haimah Chief, Hameyd-bm- x . Zv . 'd Abdullah Jowasimi. Abu Dhabi and Debay, and in March the Eas-ei- Khaimah Chief paid a visit to Shargah. The Chief of Ajman called at Shargah at the same time, and, being to a certain extent nentral, was asked to mediate in view to the maintenance of peace between the rival States; this office he however, declined. „ In the early part of the year correspondence went on between the Ohiets ot , Abu Dhabi and Umm-el-Kawain, the former nrg- Ab'i~u ' ing the latter to join him in an expedition against Shaik Jasim of El-Katr, who, on the other hand, wrote to Ahmed bin-Abdullah claiming his assistance. This Chief decided to take no side in this quarrel, but later he'joined the Shargah coalition against the two southern States. In April 1889, Shaikh Eashid proceeded to El-Bereymi, where he mediated between two factions of the Naeen tribe and effected Aimahu Chief, Rashid-Bin-Hameyd Ai-Bu-Mi. a reconciliation. Shaikh Rashid remained on friendly terms with the Chiefs of the Shargah confederacy, but from having been asked to mediate between them and their southern neighbours, he appears to have abstained from active part in the q In the early part of the year (April 1889), Salim-bin-Sultan, ex-Chief of , Shargah, organized an attack against the place, jowS? ^ S '- Khaha which fell through. Subsequently the Chief, Shaikh Sakar, became reconciled to his uncle Salim, and received him into favour and made him his Wazeer.ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL As regards the warfare betweeil Abu Dhabi and El-Katr, the Chief of Shargah decided to remain neutral. In the summer the seeds of a quarrel between Shargah and Debay were sown by raids committed by some Bedouins of the Manaseer tribe who are in some degree dependents of Debay and of Abu Dhabi. In Eebruary some camels belonging to Debay were mutilated in Shar^ah limits, and redress being refused, relations between these two States were broken off. By means of the good offices of the Residency Agent, hostilities were averted and a meeting took place between the rival Chiefs in Eebruary, when an agreement was concluded. The quarrel, however, was renewed the follow ing month. On this occasion Abu Dhabi made common cause with Debay and Shaik Zaeed marched with a force to the assistance of the Debay Chief and encamped at Semeyyah between Abu Dhabi and Debay. The Chief of Debay has latterly allied himself with the cognate Beni Yas Debay chief, Rasheed-bin-Maktoom tribe of whom Shaik Zaeed of Abu Dhabi is head Ai-Bu-Faiasa. ^ Consequently he has incurred the hostilitv of Shaikh Jasim of El-Katr, who has forbidden the people of Debay, as well as of Abu Dhabi, to land on the Katr coast, for trade or other purposes. The Persian authorities of Bunder Abbas complained that Persians resid- ing at Debay were not kindly treated, and requested that the British Affent might be instructed to protect thera. Orders were issued to the Residency Agent to exert his influence with the Oman Chiefs to induce them to treat all classes of persons residing in their territories kindly and justly, so that no cause of complaint should occur. The border warfare between the Beni Yas Chief and his allies on the one leefoh'ii^ni Ya8 hie ^ Kha - ^ aild Shaikl1 Jasin i on the other, continues un- abated. ^ A v pri ', Shai it Z r d led a f0rc ' e towards El-Katr and advanced to Karah. near the borders of Bl-Hasa, and there plundered the Bedouins friendly to Jasim of a number ot horses and camels. Prom Karah the Beni Tas force marched to Hojair, a fort in which a number ot the Karah Bedouins had taken shelter but the place was not invested nor attacked. Shaikh Zaeed decided not to advance to Katr, and returned to Abu Dhabi. Very few lives were lost in this expedition on either side, but the Beni Yas captured a considerable number ot camels. Reprisals were of course made, and in June Hameyd -bin-Mana, El-Man- soon, a follower of Shaikh Jasim, led a marauding expedition towards Oman and carried off some camels belonging to the Deroo, and Al-Bu-Shamis tribes, allies of the Bern Yas. cessful^ 11 ' 11 JaSim alS0 lieaded an OXpedition in the SUI1 imer, but it was unsuc- bv comrfacf^tr 118 '' 161 ''?

The Residency-Agent at Shargah has furnished the following estimate of the number of pearl-fishing boats sailing from Pirate Coast ports: — Ramss . , . . . . . . . 10 Ras-el-Kliaimah . Jezirat-el-Za^ab . Umra-el-Kawain • Himriyah . Aj man Shargah, Hijrah, and Khan Debay and Jumeyra A.ba Dhabi and dependencies 3b 25 55 20 40 350 950 355 T otal . 1,840 The various Chiefs derive the chief part of their-income from taxes levied on the boats and their crews. These taxes are of two kinds called ' Taraz ' and 'Nowb.' The former is a sum varying from four to seven dollars, levied from each individual of the crew and divers of pearl boats. By the ' Nowb' the Shaikhs receive one-half of the profits of every boat sailing from their ter ritories. Boats proceeding to the Red Sea fisheries pay one sum varying from 30 to 60 dollars. 3.—EL BAHRAIN. The islands of Bahrain have continued to enjoy tranquillity and pros perity under the rule of Shaikh Eesa-bin-Ali. A number of families of the Naeem and Salateh tribes crossed from El- Katr and have settled in Bahrain. In the last year's report allusion was made to the excavations of Tumuli of the ancient necropolis on Awal Island by Mr. and Mrs. Bent who, it may now be remarked, consider that their researches went to confirm the statements of ancient writers that the Bahrain Islands were the original home of the Phoeni cians. These islands have peculiarities, such as the warm springs and bright running streams, in contrast with the neighbouring arid deserts, which we may easily conceive to have peopled the groves with deities and caused them to be regarded as the 44 Holy Islands.'' A celebrity of the sort would account for the growth on Awal of the vast necropolis referred to. 4.— EL-KATR. The feud between Shaikh Jasim-bin-Mohammed, Bin Thani, and the Chief of Abu Dhabi, has continued unabated, and the former's eagerness to strike a blow at his enemy led him to despatch some boats, with armed men and muni tions of war to El-Sila, a place without the recognized boundary of Katr. Shaikh Jasim, when called upon to reply to this charge, attempted to justi fy his action by asserting the place to be within his jurisdiction. Under orders of the Government of India, Jasim was warned that a repetition of similar irregularities would lead to serious consequences. The Turkish garrison of El-Bidaa was, during the year, re-enforced, and it is understood that'the commandant has orders to repel any attack on the town by Shaikh Jasim's enemies, but not to operate beyond four hours' march from the walls. Shaikh Jasim has the title of ' Kaim-Makam ' or Local Governor of Katr, on the part of the Turkish Government, and is supposed to be under the orders8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL of the Muteserrif of Hasa. In July the latter official, Akif Pasha, visited El- Bidaa in a Turkish gunboat, and the first interview between His Excellency and Shaikh Jasim took place in the house of Mohammed Bin Abdul Wahhab. Jasim came, attended by a force of about six hundred armed men on foot, and sixty or seventy horsemen and camel riders, many of whom carried Henry. Martini rifles, which were ready loaded. The Muteserrif had only his personal attendants with him, the Turkish soldiers being within their fort. A second interview of a more private description occurred at Shaikh Jasim's residence, and on this occasion the Muteserrif informed Jasim that Katr being Turkish territory His Excellency desired to introduce a proper administrative system, and establish a custom house. Jasim opposed these measures, and threatened to resign his office of Kaim Makam if the Muteserrif persisted, on which the latter asked for a written resignation, which Jasim at once furnished. 11 appears that Jasim complained of the want of support he received from the Turkish Government, especially with reference to his coercion on certain occasions by British authority. He also handed over to the Muteserrif all the correspondence with the British authorities. Attempts of the Turkish authorities to establish quarantine at El-Bidaa were opposed and prevented by Shaikh Jasim. In October, messengers from ' Ibn Eashid, ' Emir of Shammer, arrived in Katr, bearing a present for Shaikh Jasim, consisting of horses, mares, and camels. It appeared that Ibn Rashid's object was to induce Jasim to operate against the Almorrah Bedouins, whose conduct has displeased him. The principal raids and counter raids between Katr and Oman have been mentioned under the previous heading. There seemed reason to believe that Jasim had become somewhat weary of the strife and would welcome mediation for peace. The Cbief of Bahrain w r as moved to sound him, but the result was unfavourable. One piracy attended by loss of life was committed off the Katr coast on a Bahrain boat, the culprits being of the Beni Hajir, residing in Katr. Shaikh Jasim recovered the property plundered, but the robbers were not arrested. The Chief of Bahrain has not considered it expedient to press the matter further. 5.—NEJD AND EL-HASA. The Emir Mohammed ' Ibn Rashid' exercises paramount authority over all Nejd. In the autumn Abdallah-bin-Eeysal was permitted to return to Riadh, but later it was reported that both Abdallah and his brother, Abdur Rahman, had died at Riadh. Needs not to be said what impression this created. The Muteserrif or Governor of El-Hasa, Akif Pasha, is energetic in his administration, and his active measures have greatly repressed robberies of caravans by the Bedouin tribes. A notorious freebooter known as Ibn Rezey- zan was surprised and put to death between Ojair and ELHasa. Several robberies of boats lying in Kateef Harbour occurred during the year, for which, of course, no redress could be obtained. 6.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. The Government of Ears has remained in the hands of His Royal Highness the Motemid-ed-Dowlah s with Haji Naseer-el-Mulk as his 'Pishkar.' Shahzadah Nowzer Mirza having resigned the Government of Dashti and Dashtistan, Mohammed Hasan .Khan Sirteep was appointed to the vacant post.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1889-90. 9 Those districts, were during several months, in a disturbed state, owing to feuds between local Chiefs, notably those of Borazjan and Angali. His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk has continued to hold the Government of the Persian Gulf Ports and Islands, including Jask. Chevalier Keun de Hoogerwoerd, Consul-General for the Netherlands at Bushire, proceeded to join a new appointment at Bankok in May, his acting successor being Mr. W. Groeneweg, of the firm of Hotz and Son. M. Piat, Yice-Consul for France at Bushire, proceeded on leave to Erance, leaving the Vice-Consulate in the charge of Haji Mirza Hoosain, the Dragoman. The Imperial Bank of Persia having effected an arrangement for the with drawal of the new Oriental Bank Corporation branches from Persia, has opened a branch in Bushire, and the new Oriental Bank Corporation has closed busi ness there. Mirza Ismail was appointed Deputy Governor of Lingah, and Mirza Hadi, of Bunder Abbas. A detachment of 50 soldiers was stationed at Lingah. Major E. Bruce, Bengal Cavalry, arrived for the purpose of buying mules for Government and succeeded in obtaining over 800 animals, mostly pur chased at Ispahan and Tehran. In the summer epidemic cholera having appeared at Bussorah and Moham- merah, some cases were imported into Bushire by Captain Hughes, of the Bombay and Persian Steam Navigation Company's steamer Mobile, before quarantine could be established. Owing to the exertions of Surgeon-Major T. Efrench Mullen aided by Mr. Apothecary Rodrigues, the disease was pre vented from spreading, and subsequently the Persian authorities, advised and assisted by Dr. Mullen and subordinates, established quarantine which saved Bushire, and probably most of Persia, from the epidemic. An interesting memorandum, prepared by Dr. Mullen on this and previous outbreaks of cholera in Persia, &amp;c., will be appended to this report. 7.— PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The steps taken during the year towards the establishment of the commer cial route from Mohammerah to Central and Northern Persia have still been chiefly of a preliminary nature. Nevertheless, the progress made, though, as anticipated, slow, is real. The position of the English commercial agents in Arabistan and Shushter is improved, and the good relations they have suc ceeded in establishing are highly creditable to themselves and advantageous for trade. At Mohammerah the Governor of Arabistan, the Nizam-es-Saltanah, has built a Government house, a landing place, and a public bath. At Ahwaz (Bunder Nasiri) buildings are in course of construction, and at Shushter a large amount was spent in repairing the great bridge of Valerien, but unfortunately the arches which had been repaired were swept away by a flood of the river (Shateyr). A Company has now been formed in London which will undertake the construction of roads from Ahwaz to Barujird, and Tehran, with a branch to Ispahan, and a tramway is to be made from Bunder Nasiri to Ahwaz. The stern wheel steamer Shushan has been presented to His Majesty the Shah by Messrs. Lynch and is now running on the Upper Karun. There is every reason to expect that merchandize in considerable quantities will soon be sent by this route. Two cases of piracy on British Indian vessels occurred in the Shat-el-Arab river, and all attempts to trace the perpetrators failed. B10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Mohammerali suffered severely from epidemic cholera, which also visited Arabistan generally, and Shushter. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. During the absence from Persia of His Majesty the Shah last summer, a serious insurrection occurred in this province. It appears to have arisen from the cruelty and misconduct of the Governor of Baluchistan, Ahu\ Eath Khan, who seized several Baluch Chiefs in a trea. cherous manner and offered outrage to their women. For some time the Chief town, Bampur, was in the hands of the insurgents, and the Persian Governor besieged in a neighbouring fort. Acting on information conveyed through Her Majesty's Legation, tlie Amin-ul-Mulk, who had been left in charge of affairs at Tehran, ordered the Persian Governor of Baluchistan to be deposed, and Sirteep Zeyn-el-Abedeen was appointed to relieve him. Every opportunity was taken by the British officials to urge the disaffected Baluch Chiefs to avoid committing themselves to revolt, and eventually quiet was restored. The petty Governments are still in a somewhat unsettled condition, and it is difficult to ascertain what persons are really in authority in the various dis tricts. About Jask, disturbances have been created by certain relations of Meer Abdul Nubbee, who is still a prisoner in the hands of the Persian authorities at Bushire. 9.—SLAVE TRAFFIC. A considerable number of fresh African slaves yearly reach the northern coasts of Arabia, both by sea and by overland routes. During the past year a few Africans were liberated from slavery through the exertion of our Native Agents. Three were brought by sea to Umm-el-Kawain, and being demanded, were handed over to the Residency Agent by the Chief and liberated. At Shargah, a Nakhoda attempted to carry two female Africans in slavery to the Persian Coast, but the Agent interfered, and eventually both women were sent to Muscat and liberated. In September information was received that seven fresh African slaves had been imported to Lingah from Soor. Every effort was made to get hold of these persons and have the importer punished, but the action and attitude of the Per- sian officials completely frustrated all attempts. Curiously enough, the dallal, who imported the slaves, died immediately after the inquiry was instituted, from the sting of a hornet. His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk subsequently issued a notification to the effect that persons engaging in slave traffic will be punished, and the farmer of customs was enjoined to bring all cases of importation to the notice of the authorities. In October the Hesidency Agent at Bahrain reported that persons, returned from the Mecca pilgrimage, had brought a larger number of slaves than usual, some by sea and some by land. This was brought to the notice of the Chief of Bahrain, who acted loyally and traced 15 slaves, 8 males and 7 females, who had been freshly imported. The Residency steamer Lawrence was despatched to Bahrain for these Africans, who were manumitted at Bushire. 10.-—.ROYAL NAVY VESSELS.

The epidemic ceased in Persia, but passed across Europe, reaching England in October, It is held by some authorities that this invasion of Europe was not due, as I have above described it to be, to an advance from India, through Persia and South Russia, but to an advance from Mecca, where the disease had been brought by pilgrims from India by way of Egypt and Turkey in Europe and thence across the Continent. 1845. —Cholera raged in Central Asia and Bokhara, and ta^'Herara^MraM 1 thf1829 Cabul suffered very heavily in 1844.

There seems to have^ been no advance of this epidemic beyond Lingah on the Persian Coast of the Gulf; I have no record of what followed the outbreak at Kassab on, the Arabian Coast.16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The above History may be considered as that o£ the Persian Gulf offshoot of the 1863-64 epidemic started from Bengal. There was another and more important offshoot of the same epidemic, which burst into life at Mecca and Medina in the end of May or beginning- of June of this year, havino' l) eea carried to those places by pilgrims from India. The outbreak was a severe one. Returning pilgrims carried the disease with them Reyah, the capital of the Wahabi country, suffered heavily, as did Aneyza and other towns there. The epidemic moved on by Jahr or Jaharah, and on the 25th or 26th August broke out at Duaseh, on the right bank of the Shat-el-Arab, some 40 miles below Bussorah. On the 8th September cholera appeared at Basra and soon became very severe; it was said 5 pe r cent, of the population died of it! Koweit and its neighbourhood suffered severely about the same time as Bussorah. The epidemic passed up the Euphrates through Syria to Aleppo and up the Tigris to Diabekr and throughout Turkish Kurdistan. This is precisely what occurred in the epidemic of 1846. In October the epidemic became dormant. i&lt;S££.—The epidemic of last year which ceased in October, broke out in March of this Entered Persia by Urumia and pro- y ear &gt; an ^ advanced over two routes.

The great ' Hurdwar epidemic' occurred on the 13th and 14th of April of this year and from Hurdwar was carried by returning pilgrims far and wide. Entered most probably by the Herat 1868.-—-Iti the spring of this year cholera and Meshed route as in 1829 and 1845. various parts of Persia. Up to the middle of 1868 cholera had moved across Persia in a direction from west to east, This was probably the Hurdwar that is to say that from its entry in 1866 by Urumia aud cholera of 1867. beyond Tabriz it passed steadily across to Meshed. In July a reverse movement set in : a body of pilgrims returning westward from Meshed in that month carried the disease with them and it soon covered all Northern Persia and spread into the Baghdad Pashalik. Cholera was at the same time prevalent in Northern and Western India and in Afghanistan. Faurel and some Russian writers hold that the reversed movement,—that from Meshed westward above alluded to, was simply a carrying back by pilgrims of the cholera of 1866-67. The far more probable theory is that this cholera moving from Meshed in July 1868 was in fact a new invasion. The great outbreak at Hurdwar, where 2 millions of pilgrims had collected, occurred on the 12th to 15th April (really one might say only on 13th and 14th) 1867; the pilgrims scattered panic-stricken on the 15th April and carried the disease with them in all directions (Bryden laughs this idea to scorn but, nevertheless, it is widely believed in). They carried it into Afghanistan, where it raged from July to September, and it seems most likely it was the cholera becoming dormant in September 1867 which sprang into life again in the spring of 1868 and following the usual route via Herat, appeared at Meshed in July. Macnamara holds, I think, that the Tehran cholera of 1867 was an offshoot of the Hurd war epidemic, but an examination of the dates and facts above given seem to me to show he is mistaken and that the story as above given is the true one.UESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1889-90. 17 1869. —In the spring, cholera broke out at Kum (south-west of Meshed) and at Kashan All Persia suffered (between Ispahan and Tehran).

In May a Turkish expeditionary force, collected at Bussorah, suffered from cholera. It took cholera with it to Koweit, whence it spread through and across Arabia as I shall tell lower down. In June cholera deaths were reported on the 28th as occurring at Lingah. In July, the last week of, there was a small outburst of cholera at Bushire. In August cholera was bad at Bahrain and amongst the pearl fleet; the disease was said to bave been brought by the Turkish force before spoken of. The cholera brought from Bussorah to Koweit, as above related, in June 1871 spread through Eastern Arabia. It appeared at Hay el in Northern Arabia in the middle of June. From Hayel it moved southwards to Khaiber and thence to Medina and Mecca, reaching the former in September and the latter in November.

The official year now under report was rather an uneventful one in the Political. Political history of Oman. The rumours regarding a probable rising of the Hinawee tribes, headed by Sayid Abdul Aziz against the rule of the Sultan, which prevailed towards the end of the previous year and which seemed to subside for a time, took a more definite shape about the end of April, so that the Resident, who arrived here on the 26th of that month for the purpose of recognizing His Highness Sayid Eeysal as Sultan of Muscat, had to postpone doing so, under the unsettled state of affairs then existing. Nothing, however, resulted from this attempt of the Sultan's uncle to invite the Sharkiyyeh tribes to join his cause, and excepting an intertribal quarrel between the Beni-bu-Ali and the Jenebeh at Sur, the province of Oman seemed to be tranquil again. About the end of the year 1888, His Highness the Sultan was compelled, owing to the strained relations existing at the time between the Beni-bu-Ali and the Jenebeh at Sur, to send a deputation with the object of effecting peace between the two tribes. Eor a time they remained on peaceful terms, but the latter having killed one of the Beni-bu-Ali, fresh hostilities broke out between them in May 1889, which resulted in a fight of some importance. His High ness Sayid Eeysal lost no time in sending his steamer ' Sultani ' with Say ids Badr-bin-Seif and Nasir-bin-Muhammad, and Shaik Shamis-bin-Hasain to the scene of action, and in inviting both parties to Muscat to settle the dispute between them amicably. Shaik Abdullah-bin-Salem, the Tamimeh of the Beni- bu-Ali refused for a time to accept any terms short of the surrender of four lives of the opposite party, but eventually agreed to a truce for a year, the question of compensation remaining unsettled. The state of political tranquillity which was reported to exist at the begin ning of June was not destined to last long. On the 13th of July Sayid Abdul Aziz wrote to the Political Agent and the Resident expressing his intention of attacking Muscat shortly, but nothing occurred till the end of the month to show that he would succeed in making an attempt to carry it out. Aided, however, by some of the Hijrin, he managed at last to collect a few men with whom he marched to the Kahza Pass where he was repulsed by the .Sultan's garrison ; the little invading party having in consequence dispersed, Sayid Abdul Aziz had to fall back upon Samad. After this defeat and discomfiture of Sayid Abdul Aziz, the aspect of political affairs seemed again to take a tranquil turn; and although owing to his restless nature vague rumours of another attempt on his part were in circulation, no event of any importance occurred until the 24th December, when the Political Agent reported of an affray having taken place in the Dahireh between the Beni Kelban and the Naeem on one side and the Beni- Ali on the other, in consequence of the latter having some time back waylaid a party of the Beni Kelban and killed eight of them. Although no reliable in formation could be obtained as regards the actual severity of the fight or the numbers of the killed and wounded, the result of the fight seems to have been decidedly against the Beni-Ali.24 ADMINISTRATION KEPOUT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL About the same time fresh rumours of another projected rising of the Sharkiyyeh tribes reached Muscat and Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali, who, strange to say, has remained faithful and friendly throughout to the present Sultan, wrote on the 26th of December warning him of their design. His Highness Sayid Eeysal, now believing in the rumours, lost no time in reinforcing the garrisons of Muscat and Muttrah whilst Shaik Saleh sent a direct message to the Chiefs in charge of the several passes to prepare for the enemy. As it was supposed at first that Sayid Ibrahim-bin-Keis of Eustak would join the coalition of the tribes, and lend his assistance to the scheme, the Sultan made his prepara tions accordingly, so that about the end of January he had nearly 2,000 men at his command. In the meantime, Shaik Hamud-al-Jahafi who seems to have been the prime exciter of this revolt, proceeded with about 150 men from the Sharkiyyeh and reached Rustak on the 7th of January, where he evidently pre vailed upon Sayid Ibrahim to give countenance to the cause by sending his nephews, Hamud and Sa'ud, the sons of the late Iman Azzan-bin-Keis, with 15 men to join the party. It was evidently Sayid Abdul Aziz's intention to take a more direct route to Rui near Muttrah, where by a previous arrangement he was tb join the advanced party headed by Shaik Hamud, but after making fruitless at tempts at all the passes leading to the Batineh, he had to retire discomfited once more to Samad. While Sayid Abdul Aziz was making these vain attempts, the failure of which was mainly due to Shaik Saleh's friendly assistance and the energetic and unwearied efforts of Rashid-bin-Aziz the Wali of Samail, Shaikh Hamud, now aided and countenanced by the presence of the two sons of Sayid Azzan in his camp, marched through the Batineh, attacked a hamlet near Burkeh on the night of the 10th of January and afterwards set about raiding and plun dering the country around. He then arrived at Gobra where he encamped awaiting Sayid Abdul Aziz's arrival. Directly the object with which Rashid-bin-Aziz had been despatched to the front to watch the several passes and to inspire courage and zeal into the minds of the garrisons guarding them, was accomplished by Sayid Abdul Aziz falling back upon Samad, he was recalled to Muscat to deal with the danger nearer home. Rashid returned to Muscat on the 16th January, bring ing with him 500 men of the Yal-Waheebh who were now posted at Wattayeh partly to watch and partly to keep the enemy's force in check. The short sightedness of this policy was however soon apparent, for on the one hand the new reinforcements refused to fight or take any serious action against their own tribesmen on the opposite side, and on the other the leading Gafree tribes sta tioned in Muscat were afraid to leave their post and march against Shaikh Hamud, lest their departure might give the Hinawis a chance of forming a coalition against them and placing the Sultan in a worse position than ever. This state of inactivity soon came to an end for Sayyid Abdul Aziz, now taking advantage of the absence of Rashid-bin-Aziz from the passes, suddenly made his appearance with 17 men in the Samail Valley near Eanjah and was reported to be on the 20th of January fairly on his way to join Hamud's party. The Sultan was therefore compelled to adopt a more active course, and accord ingly on the 26th, whilst he sent his younger brother Sayyid Fahad by land, himself proceeded in person by sea to Seeb where the enemy was supposed to be quartered. The news of these measures had, however, already preceded their being carried out, so that on his arrival at Seeb the Sultan found that both Seyyid Abdul Aziz and Hamud had proceeded more inland; he therefore returned to Muscat, leaving the land party now commanded by Seyyid FahadRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1889-90. 25 to deal with the enemy, who kept on retreating as the other party advanced. The development of this new feature in Omanee tactics was not calculated upon by the advancing party who had to carry on the pursuit till the enemy found himself within the friendly precincts of Eustak. As it seemed pretty certain now that although Seyyid Ibrahim had given a friendly refuge to Seyyid Abdul Aziz and his followers at Kustak, he had no intention of co-operating with him or of giving him any active support, and accordingly as no reason remained for maintaining such a large force to watch any further development of Seyyid Abdul Aziz's scheme, the Sultan wisely paid off and dismissed most of the men and directed his brother to leave Jimmeh where he was encamped and to fall back upon Burkeh whence he could as easly watch the enemy's movements. Eor the next few weeks the situation remained unaltered, and, although various rumours were in circulation, nothing beyond a few intertribal raids, mainly incidental on the disturbed condition of the country then existing, occurred. About the beginning of February the Eahabiyin attacked a Hinawi caravan consisting of men and property belonging to the Yal-Wahibeh, the Habus and the Duekeh, in retaliation for the raid committed on them by Hamud-al-Jahafi on his first advance to the Batineh. In this encounter the Eahabiyin succeeded in killing six men and in carrying off 40 camels. This incident might have led to serious complications, had not His Highness the Sultan succeeded in time to effect a truce between the parties. When Sheikh Hamud-al-Jahafi first visited Eustak, it was more than surmised that he had succeeded in winning Sayid Ibrahim over to the cause, and as under those circumstances in all probability, the latter would have first attacked Sohar or any other Batineh Ports, it was necessary to reinforce the garrisons in all these places. The Wali of Sohar, Sayid Hamud Bin Nasir, in vited the Nairn to his assistance, but by the time they could arrive Sayid Abdul Aziz and Sheikh Hamud were gradually retreating towards Eustak, and it was apparent that Sayid Ibrahim had no intention of attempting to at tack Sohar or any other place. The Wali, Sayid Hamud, finding himself now freer to act, led the new reinforcements to Wadi Kasim with the object of co operating with Sayid Pahad with whose party he was eventually ordered to fall back upon Burkeh. The Naim, however, rather suddenly left that place and found back their way to Sohar, plundering the Yal-Saad on the way and committing raids near Sohar itself for which reason Sayid Hamud had to be sent by sea to quiet and dismiss them. After the retreat of Sayid Abdul Aziz and Sheikh Hamud from the Batineh, the former remained at Eustak till about the end of March when he left for the Shamal or the Pirate Coast with the object of visiting Sheikh Zaid- bin-Khalifeh at Abu-Dabi. Sheikh Hamud, however, not contented with the share of plunder which had already fallen to his lot in the Batineh, occu pied himself with his usual pursuit of raiding until being deserted by most of his followers and unable to retrace his steps to the Sharkiyyeh in safety with out an escort, on Sayid Abdul Aziz's departure for the Shamal, tendered his submission to Sayid Badr-bin-Seif who was left in charge at Burkeh after Sayid Eahad's return to Muscat. His Highness the Sultan deeming it advis able to accept it allowed him to return to the Sharkiyyeh in the company of a Gafri Chief. Thus the close of the official year under report saw another effort of Sayid Abdul Aziz's to incite the people of Oman to revolt against the present Sul tan and to accept him as their ruler instead, and, like its predecessors, in frus tration, a result which, while it clearly indicates the weakness of his own cause,26 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL also strengthens the belief that His Highness Sayid Feysal has now fairly earned the loyalty and support of his subjects. There were no seizures of slave dhows during the year. The number of fugitive slaves that sought freedom at the Consulate during the year was 51, of whom 35 have been liberated under treaty stipulations of 1873, and 16 were dismissed. Lieutenant W. Stratton held charge of the office of Political Agent and Consul from 1st April to 4th September when hp Official changes. , . , , . proceeded on privilege leave, and again on his return from leave from 20th October to 16th December when he was relieved by Major 0.

The year 1889 was a comparatively prosperous one for South Persia in its commercial aspect. Not only was there marked increase of the volume of trade, but good profits were, on the whole, realized by those engaged in it. As one instance in proof of the increase referred to, it may be mentioned that the Bushire customs yielded a revenue of about 40 per cent, in excess of that of the preceding year. Much attention has been directed to Persia as an outlet for European manufactures by the opening of the River Karun to international traffic, the visit of the Shah to Europe, and the formation of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Possibly the attention so attracted may have led to the shipment to this country of goods on a scale somewhat disproportionate to the present actual consumption, and some check may be anticipated unless new forces at work in the country add speedily to its general prosperity. Imports. There was a considerable increase in the import of cotton goods, chiefly of British (Manchester) manufacture, but, on the Cotton goods. -whole, results were not so satisfactory to merchants as in the year 1888. Owing to a ' corner ' in cotton, prices in Manchester rose considerably, and for a time no corresponding rise occurred in Persia. On the collapse of the cotton &lt;t ring' , in 1889, the position improved, and the market became firmer. The piece-goods imported were largely of the costlier descriptions, and towards the end of the year the markets were somewhat overstocked in more than one article of staple goods, and it was feared that re-action might ensue in the cotton trade during the current year. However, the good harvests of 1890, and consequent increased prosperity amongst peasantry and nomads, may avert that evil. My attention has been drawn by Messrs. Malcolm, of Bushire, to the re marks on Russian red chintzes, contained in my last trade report, which re marks require correction. Eor it appears that the so-called ' Russian ' chintzes are really of English manufacture, and acquired the name of efi Russian ' from having been originally introduced into Persia through Russia. In the same way, there are chintzes known as ' Austrian ' which are entirely of Manchester manufacture. The fact of the so-called ' Russian' goods being imported through Bunder Abbas is accordingly, if anything, a favourable indication. I am informed by a leading English merchant that he recently observed Man chester goods in the bazars of Tehran which, bearing Indian marks, had un doubtedly reached that capital via Bombay. Indeed there seems every reason to believe that a larger proportion of British goods make their way to Tehran from the south than in former times. With improved transit, the results must be still more satisfactory. Copper and other metals were imported in largely increased quantities, a m , i fall in prices having occurred in Europe. The collapse of the Paris Copper Syndicate released large stocks of that metal, and a sufficient portion was taken by Persia with satisfac tory results. d i28 ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The quantity of sugar imported early in the year was comparatively small, and this, combined with enhanced prices abroad, caused for a time a considerable rise in prices in Persia, but towards the close of the year, freer arrivals at lower rates caused a fall in prices. It appears that Erench loaf sugar (beet) keeps the lead, thougli both German and Austrian sorts are freely taken. It is observed that the large quantity of candles imported is chiefly from „ „ Holland, from which it would appear that Endish Candles. . manufacturers are unable to provide a suitable article at a cheap rate. A decline in the price of gold threads having occurred, inferior qualities are said to be supplied, and Russian gold threads have acquired a superiority in the markets over those of other countries. Gold threads. JExports. A considerable area was under cultivation in South and Central Persia, but the grain harvests of 1889 disappointed expect, ations owing to scanty rain-fall in the latter months. The quality of wheat brought to Bushire was inferior in colour and in size, and the admixture of barley was excessive. Owing to low prices in European markets, cultivators in Persia realized but small returns. The prohibition on export of grain imposed in the autumn of 1888 was never entirely withdrawn, and shipments could only be made on payment of special ' fees ' in addition to the regular duty. Capricious and unnecessary prohibitions of exportation of grains from Persia are of frequent occurrence, and tend greatly to hamper trade, not only in this particular branch, but in all others. Such embargos have also an inju rious effect on the country and population. If they were strictly enforced the results would be ruinous to all, and, in absence of satisfactory regulations, it is necessary in the general interests to pass without remonstrance irregularities which add to the incomes of the official classes. If some more satisfactory system could be introduced and enforced, it would be a boon to trade generally, and relieve it of a burden and constantly recurring annoyance. It is obvious how convenient the present system is to local officials. The opium crop of 1889 was a good one, but the demand for the drug in q pium Europe has fallen off, and most of the Persian opium was sent to China. Prices in Hong-Kong were uni form throughout the year, and profits moderate. The tobacco trade of South Persia has been chiefly in the hands of Syrian Tobacco. merchants. It was by no means remunerative, by all accounts, in 1889, and some losses were in curred. It is understood that an English or European Company has acquired a concession for a tobacco 'regie' in Persia. The quantity of wool exported was up to the average. Some shipments WooI were made to Bombay, London, New York, and Marseilles, but most of the wool was sent to Bussorab. The exporters paid high prices to the Persian sellers and farmers, but the tran sactions led to losses to the exporters. The cotton trade is on the increase in South Persia, and is chiefly in the Cotton&gt; hands of Persian merchants who ship to Bombay, where the Persian cotton is bought for mixing with finer Indian qualities destined for Europe,RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1889-90. 29 The carpet trade receives more attention from European exporters than formerly, and the manufacture in certain districts Carpets. is controlled by European supervision, with good results. The stimulation of the trade in Persian gum which was mentioned in my report for 1888, has been arrested in consequence of larger supplies of good qualities being obtain able in Egypt and the Soudan. The Persian article has been scarcely inquired for. 1? earl-fisheries. The Arab population of the shores of the Persian Gulf and its islands look forward to the period of diving operations (about 100 days of the hot season) as the chief event of the year. To them the pearl-take is their harvest, and in this all classes, from Chiefs to domestic slaves, are personally interested. During recent years these ' harvests ' have been abundant, whilst at the same time prices of pearls have been rising. Consequently there is a visible increase in the prosperity of the Arabs of this littoral, and larger vessels are built than of yore. I reckon that in round numbers nearly 2,000 boats of all sizes are engaged on the pearl banks from the Pirate Coast, from Bahrain say 1,500 and from El-Katr, Koweit, &amp;c., about 1,000—a total of 4,500 boats. It is not an excessive estimate to suppose that 30,000 men are thus employed. The take of pearls in 1889 about equalled that of the preceding year. Tonnage and freights. During the first part of the year, whilst exportation of grain continued, there was a moderate demand for tonnage in London, but later, the prohibition on the export of grain, coupled with the outbreak of cholera in Bussorah, limited the quantity of cargo obtainable. Freights ranged from 30s. to 35s. at Bushire during the grain export operation. Exchange, Exchange on London varied from 34^ to 36 kerans per pound sterling j and was not subject to any violent fluctuations. Kerans fluctuated from 230 to 252 per one hundred rupees. Banking Agencies, The branch of the new Oriental Bank Corporation in Bushire is reported to have done a fair business. The Imperial Bank of Persia opened at the capital is about to establish branches in other towns including Bushire, buying out the Oriental. Opening of the Karun Biver route. Considerable progress has been made on the Karun, and the relations between the commercial agents and Persian officials and people are much improved. A suitable river steamer is now on the upper river, and a company has been formed to construct roads for wheeled carriage and bridges from the Karun to Ispahan and Tehran. Impediments and requirements. In the first of this series of reports (for the year 1873), as well as in sub sequent trade reports, allusions have been made to the difficulties which are experienced by foreign merchants carrying on business in Persia generally, and to certain measure^ which seemed requisite in order to place British and British Indian trade in the south of Persia on a fairer footing.30 administration b-epoet op the persian gulp political Amongst the suggestions then being considered were: The opening of the Karun River Route; establishment of a British Agency at Yezd; revised commercial treaty; administrative reform, in view to facilitate recovery of just claims from Persian debtors. The two first of these proposals are in fair way of realization, and other measures not thought of in those days are now fails accomplis. With the advance of trade, however, the need for administrative reform is becoming still more strongly felt, and in this respect no progress has been made, and the terms used to describe this want more than fifteen years ago are still applicable. The evil threatens to assume dangerous proportions, from the increased tendency to fraudulent declarations of bankruptcy, under the facilities afforded by the venality of officials. These, as often as not, are selected for their absorbtive qualities rather than for administrative qualifica tions or high character, and when a dishonest Persian debtor decides to free himself from his liabilities to foreign traders on easy terms, he finds his own officials ready with sympathising though not disinterested assistance. In such cases, and unfortunately they are common, all efforts to obtain full justice must fail, for you find the Judge leagued with the accused and custodiam quis custodiet ? If any method can be devised to provide for the just hearing and speedy settlement of claims of foreigners against Persian subjects, it will greatly benefit trade generally. Increase of Trade. Notwithstanding all difficulties, during the last twenty years (a compara- tively dark period before the light of European enterprise so suddenly and recently shed on Persia), the trade of the south of Persia has steadily increased. Judging from our returns, the value of imports and exports of Bushire in- creased in fifteen years (from 1873 to 3888) by about five millions of rupees. In a period of 10 years (from 1878 to 1888) the trade of Bunder Abbas in creased to a similar extent. Prom the present time a fresh departure maybe reckoned, the old order changes, and more rapid progress may be anticipated. E. C. ROSS, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and H.

After a tenure of office extending, with only two breaks, over a period of more than eighteen years, Colonel Ross was relieved by Major Talbot on the 26th March last and proceeded to England on two years' furlough. 1.—'OMAN-MUSCAT STATE. The annual report of the Muscat State has been drawn up by Colonel Mockler, and forms Part II of this compilation. The chief events of the year have been the plunder of a caravan in November, by some tribes of the Semail valley, which resulted in the closure of the trade routes from the Sharkivah for several months, and the destruction by fire of a portion of the Khaboorah bazar in February last; the circumstances of this latter incident are under reference to the Government of India. A new commercial treaty with Muscat was signed towards the close of the last official year. The export returns show that the unsettled state of the country has affect ed trade, for, excluding a larger specie remittance than usual, which swells the total, the value of produce shipped is markedly less than in the previous year. A destructive cyclone in June, accompanied by a high tidal wave, did much damage to the town of Muscat, and many houses are still in ruins. 2.—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. The confederacy between the Chiefs of Ras-ul-Khaimah, Um-ul-Kawain, and Shargah, mentioned in the last report, was still in force at the commence ment of this year, when the three former Chiefs visited Shargah. They were joined by the Chief of Ajman, who was believed to intend taking a more active part than hitherto in the support of the Jowasim against Debay. The Chief of Eas-ul-Khaimah, in concert with some of the leading men at Shargah, endeavoured to arrange terms of peace with Debay, the Chief of which had recently sent a declaration of war against Shargah. This, however, was against the wishes of the Chief of Shargah, and the Residency Agent, who had been consulted by them in the matter, was unable to move in it. ^6 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GUM POLITICAL The Chief of Um-ul-Kawain wrote with a similar ohject to the Chief of Ahu Dhahi to solicit his good offices in negotiating peace, but at first met with an unsatisfactory response ; later on, however a meeting was arranged hetweea them, when terms were temporarily settled between the contending factions, hut not until after a series of border raids on both sides, in which seme lives were lost, date-trees cut down, and honses destroyed. Intercourse was not at once resumed, and the claims of the Beni Yas, to which Abu Dhabi and Dehay belong, remained unsettled. Later in the f ™ v f of Delay had remonstrated with his ally Zaid-bm-Kbalifab. o Ahu Dhabi, for his lukewarmness in procuring a settlement of the former s claims against Shargah, and that Shaikh Zaid had pledged himself to march against Shargah and compel their adjustment by force of arms. Towards the end of January last both Chiefs were reported to be collect- ing a force for the purpose, but no decisive action was taken. Amongst minor disturbances may be mentioned a raid on Ras-ul-Khaimah by the Sahu tribe, who were, however, repulsed with a loss of eleven men, while only one of the defenders was killed. The Beni Harar, whose villages were annexed some years ago by Shaikh Zaid -bin-Khalifah, retook them towards the end of 1890, with the help of the Nairn tribe, who sent emissaries to the confederate Chiefs on the coast to enlist their support in the event of their being punished by the Abu Dhabi Chief. Early this year the Sultan of Muscat suggested that they might be reached by an expedition to the Batineh, and the Chief of Debay, whose help had been solicited by the Chief of Abu Dhabi, was preparing an expedition for action in that direction when it had to be abandoned in consequence of rumours of a formidable raid by Jasim-bin-Thani's brother. Early in March last a raid was made by some of the Awamir tribe on a party of camel -tenders belonging to Abu Dhabi, two of whom were killed and forty camels were carried off. The gangs were overtaken and by some stratagem brought to Abu Dhabi, where they were imprisoned. Amongst them was a man of the Nairn tribe, and on application for his release being refused, the tribe decided on hostilities against Abu Dhabi and applied for assistance to the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman, while the Chiefs of Abu Dhabi and Debay were reported to have taken the field and to be busy collecting troops. Nothing serious, however, resulted, and although the relations between the 'trucial' Chiefs continued to be thus unsatisfactory, no decided advantage seems to have been gained by one over the other, and no breach of treaty relations with the British Govern ment occurred. The pearl-fishing was only moderately successful this year, and the demand for pearls fell off owing to the dulness of the Indian market. Many divers from the Arab coast had gone to Ceylon the previous year, and they reported better results there than at the Red Sea fisheries, the result being that their example was followed by a number of others this year. Locusts appeared at Shargah in May 1890, and did much damage to the date gardens and other cultivation. Influenza was prevalent there in the spring, and several deaths occurred from it. On the 11th January last a heavy storm passed over the coast and did much damage at Shargah, where numbers of houses were unroofed, some 600 date-trees were blown down, and 10 beached boats were destroyed. In a heavy storm at Um-ul-Kawain on the 1st Eebruary two boats were wrecked, in one of which was a case containing 25 Martini-Henry rifles for the Chief.lis'' RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITIC AT, AGENCY FOB 1890.91, 3.—BAHRAIN.

In May it was reported that the Mutasarif of El-Hasa had written to Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab, declaring his intention of appointing him Gov ernor of Zobara and several other projects were attributed to the Mutasarif acting under orders from Constantinople. Amongst these were the appoint' ment of Mudirs, and the erection of buildings at Zobara and Odeid; the nomina- tion of a deputy to Jasim-bin-Thani, Kaim makam of Katr, on the plea of his frequent absences, and in the hope of establishing more control over El-Katr • the rebuilding of the Bereymi and Bel'Alat forts, and the construction of a large mosque at Ojair; also, the organization of a force of 600 police, mounted on camels, to keep m check the Bedouins, the despatch of two steamers to run between Kate and Ojair and Katif, the appointment of a harbour master at Katr to levy aues on native craft, and the stationing there of a force of cavalrv and infantry. ^ It was also reported that the Turks intended establishing a custom-house at J^l-Uidaa, and a Government building was to be erected; taxes were also to be levied on divers and pearl merchants. Muhammad bin Abdul Wahab declined the offer of the Governorship of Zobara, but in September it was reported that Asif Beg, Khalaf Effendi and Muhammad Beg had been nominated at Busrah as Mudirs of Zobara and Odeid and assistant to the Kaim-makam of Katr respectively. These proceedines were made the subject of a reference to the Government of India. Jasim-bin-Thani is believed to be dissatisfied with the turn affairs have taken, and to resent the action of the Turkish authorities. Towards the close of the y^ r ^ lf P asha . nuiasarif of Hasa, to whose incentive these attempts to ex end Turkish influence and jurisdiction were ascribed, was compelled by ill- health to leave El-Hasa, and is said to have since died on his way home. At the end of January last the officials mentioned above as having been appointed to Odeid, Zobara, and Katr arrived at Bahrein, and were said to intend proceeding first to El-Bidaa to deliver certain orders to Shaikh Jasim-bin-Ihani regarding the building of forts at the two former places. j. ,, The tra ' Sf f of .

The Nizam-us-Sultaneh was replaced by Haji Ghulam Hussein Khan, ' Shehab-ul-M ulk,' as Governor of Persian Arabistan in March this y a. Trade on the Karun has not increased as rapidly as might have beenexpected. the chief difficulties being connected with imperfect armngemcn s storage of goods, and for the levy of duty at the port of destina ion ontte for the interior. This latter impediment to the growth of a through teffi has now been removed, and it is hoped that there will be sufficient inducement to British ships to call in larger numbers than hitherto at Mohammmh. A company has been formed under the direction of the Mum-u - uj jaro to work the Upper Karun, and the N a steam launch 63ft. long, has placed by the company on the Lower Karun to run in connection with /SVmsAcrw above Ahwaz. , The Mniz-ns-Sultaneh was confirmed in the Chiefship of Mo am ^ er for another year. He is believed to have entered into partnership wi Muin-nt-Tujjar, and would have joined the Nizam -us-Sultaneh in construct the necessary buildings for warehouses, &amp;C., had the latter been re ame office in Arabistan. A Vice-Consul was appointed to Mohammerah in the autumn of las ^ ' and Mr. W. McDouall, of the Indo-European Telegraph Departmen , w selected as the first incumbent of the post. 7.—PARS AND PERSIAN COAST. There has been no change in the Government of Tars during the past year, and the province is still administered by His Royal Highness the Motami Dowlah, with Haji Nasir-ul-Mulk as his Pishkar.idioi^ RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1890-91. 9 His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk continued in office as Governor of Bushire and the Persian ports and islands. Shahzada Nowzer Mirza was appointed Governor of Behbahan. Muhammad Hasan Khan Sirteep continued to be Governor of Dashti, Dashtistan, and Tangistan, and no changes were made in the charge of Kankari Bowanat, and Kazeran. The Il-Begi of the Kashkai tribes was conferred on Abdulla Khan, eldest son of Darab Khan, who was detained at Shiraz. A number of families of the Baharloo clan, whose Chief, Hussain Khan, was for some time imprisoned at Shiraz, but afterwards escaped, were reported to have fled to Mazanderan to escape the exactions of the Kawam-ul-Mulk. This example was followed by Asad-ullah-Khan, one of the Ketkodas of the Arab tribes, who, with his following, retired to Yezd. ,rhe s ° ns of Eath Al1 Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar, rebelled against their father and seized the forts of Jerash and Parweeza, but after some resistance surrendered to him. In April, last year, an embargo was placed on the exportation of grain but, these crops bavin- proved to be good, the interdict was shortly afterwards removed. • j * The opium crops in Ears were poor this year; locusts also appeared in vari ous places and did considerable damage. There were several severe shocks of earthquake, and atJahrum some thirty lives were lost. Kamarij, Khisht and a were also visited by several shocks, but no great damage was done. In November Captain Kmentt, of the Austrian Army, with two Austrian assistants and four workmen from Galicia, arrived to prospect for petroleum at t , in the Geesakun hills, on behalf of the Persian Bank Mining Rights Corporation. So far the experiment has not been successful; indications of oil ave been found, but not in any quantity, while the workings have been flooded with water. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. Zein-ul-Abidm Khan was appointed Governor of Baluchistan by His Royal Highness the Prince Governor of Kerman. v ., the spring of this year His Eoyal Highness marched into the lately disturbed districts of Persian Baluchistan, and punished the ring-leaders in the revolt which had occurred during the absence of His Majesty the Shah in England. everal were executed and others imprisoned ; their relations, with a number of followers, afterwards came to Jask, and a disturbance seemed possible; but they were quieted by a re-assuring telegram from the Persian Government. Hussem Khan Baharloo, on his escape from Shiraz, fled to Kerman, and, on his request for pardon being refused, joined another political refugee. Shah Murad Khan, at the fort of Mazeejan. He was afterwards captured and brought back to Shiraz Murad Asadullah Khan Arab lost two sons in a raid on certain villages m the district of Lassa, whereupon he seized and executed a number of the headmen and marched on Kerman, accompanied by some eight hundred Arab families. He was, however, induced to return to Darab without having caused any serious disturbance. 6 9.—SLAVE TRAFPTC.

An attempt to introduce twenty-five slaves into Muscat on a Prenoh mail steamer from Aden to Karachi was enquired into at Muscat, and six Arabs, shown to have been implicated in the matter, were imprisoned by the Sultan. The letter to the trucial Chiefs referred to above was followed by the discovery and release of several Africans in captivity on the Pirate coast. Two men swam to the steamer Calder at Lingah and claimed protection as British subjects from Aden; they also gave information regarding the whereabouts of three other Africans in captivity on the Arab coast. One of these has been since released; the other two are known to be at Hinjam, and their release will be insisted on. On the Persian side the Governor of Bushire, in response to a request from the Residentj issued orders forbidding the traffic, which was most brisk at Charak and Kais, the inhabitants of which refused to allow the Deputy Gover- nor of Lingah to make any enquiries. The question of the increasing frequency of the importation of raw slaves into the countries bordering on the Persian Gulf has been brought to the notice of Government. Many of the 'Omani boats are said to fly the Prench flag and carry Prench papers, under cover of which they are able to practise their trade in slaves with impunity, and various suggestions for efflbtually putting a stop to the traffic have been made, which will doubtless receive consideration. 10.—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS. H.M.S. Mariner left the Gulf in the middle of June and was relieved at Muscat on the 10th September by H.M.S. Sphinx. Up to that date Com- mander Arbuthnot was Senior Naval Officer. He was succeeded by Com mander Groome, and, on the latter officer's promotion, he was succeeded by Commander Hart Dyke. 11.—POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS. Besides the change in the office of Resident, mentioned at the beginning of this report, that of Pirst Assistant was filled by Lieutenant Stratton until his transfer to Bussorah in March 1890. Captain Chenevix-Trench relieved Mr. G. Lucas, who had held temporary charge, on the 15th August, and was suc ceeded by Lieutenant C. A. Kemball on the 26th March 1891. Surgeon-Major D. E. Eoss returned to his post of Eesidency Surgeon on the 28th April, his locum tenens, Dr. T. Pfrench-Mullen, proceeding to India. 12.—OBSERVATORY. The results of the daily observations are embodied in a tabular statement, marked Appendix C. There was an exceptionally good rainfall in the winter, and but for the ravages of locusts in some parts, the crops would have been excellent. A. C.

The first event of importance which occurred during the official year Political. under report was the departure of His Highness Sayyid Abdul Aziz (uncle of His Highness Sayyid Feysal) from 'Oman in April: his many attempts to obtain the throne of Muscat during the last fifteen years are well known to Government. It is to be sup- posed that, himself destitute of the funds requisite for a serious undertaking) and finding that for the time being the people of 'Oman were unwilling to help him at their own expense to oust a Sultan whose rule was practically unfelt for one whom they knew by former experience would expect and endeavour to enforce obedience to his mandates, he considered it better to endeavour to ameliorate his circumstances, if possible, in other directions, and accordingly in April proceeded to Abu Dhabi to his friend Shaikh Zaid-bin- Khalifah and thence to Bushire, where he interviewed the Resident, Colonel Ross, and then went to Bombay, where he still is. His family are, however, in 'Oman and were invited by His Highness Sayyid Eeysal to come to Muscat, but refused, as might have been expected. During the same month the Resident at Bushire came to Muscat in Her Majesty's I. M. Ship Lawrence, and communicated to His Highness Sayyid Peysal the recognition by the British Government of His Highness as Sultan of Muscat. Hamud-ab-Jahafi (Yah Wahiba), who had been raiding for some time past in the Batina, returned to the Sharkiyah. Rear Admiral Ereemantle also visited Muscat in his Flagship the on his way to Bushire. In M[ay His Highness Sayyid Feysal, with his brothers, went to Soor in the Sultanee, and arranged matters between the tribes in the vicinity. In June a cyclonic storm visited Muscat and the neighbouring region, causing much damage to date plantations, native shipping, and the town of Muscat, with the loss of many lives. Fighting also took place in the Wadi Beni Ghafir between the tribes inhabiting it, in which there was some loss of life. A settlement was, however, made between them by Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Keis, of Rostak. In September a small party from the Sharkiyah attacked some of the Ghafir people near Jemmah, in theSemail valley, and killed three of the Yaara- bah, and wounded one of the Beni Harras, in retaliation for the murder by one of the Beni Harras of a Sharkiyah man under his protection, which matter having been referred by His Highness Sayyid Feysal to Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali for settlement, by whom the Beni Harras were granted very favourable terms which were repudiated by the Sharkiyah people in the manner above described' His Highness' abstention from intervention on their behalf was looked on by the Semail valley people as a slight and grievance, and gave rise to much trouble later on. In October a collision occurred between the Awamir and Beni Eivam which was subsequently arranged by Shaikh Hameid-bin-Nasir, of the Beni Ghafir. Some complaints of assault were made by British subjects at Soor durinff this month. 516 administration retort op the tersian gulf political In November a khafila of eighty camels, laden principally with goods be- longing to the Harth tribe of the Sharkiyab, was attacked and looted by a patty composed of members from various tribes of the Semail valley, principally Beni Jabir, Beni Harras, and Yaarabab, the khaflla was under protection of a man of the Masakirah (Ghafri) tribe named Hameid-bin-Sahm (nicknamed Kurta), which therefore became involved. Sayyid Nasir-bm-Muhammad, a man of weight, was sent by His Highness Sayyid Feysal to Tow to get back the looted property, but he narrowly escaped being, fired on and returned discom fited. Subsequently tbe Maskarah Kurta, with a party of some twenty men, closed the roads leading from the Sharkiyah, committing murders almost within sight of the walls of Mattrah and Muscat, nearly paralysing trade up to the end of the official year. A truce was made by Eashid-bin-Uzeiyez between the Eabbiyeen Midabi- yeen and Ab-Waheebah for one year. In February 1891 Shaikh Hamud-bin-Majid of the Beni-bin-Ali (Razik section) was treacherously murdered by a relation of Shaikh Yussuf-bin-Ali (Sinadah section), whom Hamud had killed in 1887; a truce was effected between the parties by the mediation of Sayyid Nasir -bin-Mahomed (Ab-bu-Sadi). In the same month the bazaar of Khaboorah was destroyed by fire, the losses sustained by the British merchants amounting to some $35,000. The fire was undoubtedly lit by members of the Howamid section of the Howasinah tribe instigated thereto by the Wali of Sahar, whose declared policy in reference to that tribe received His Highness Sayyid Peysal s approval. On 19th March 1891 a new Commercial Treaty with the British Govern ment was signed by His Highness Sayyid Peysal. In May Her Majesty's Ship Cossack brought for adjudication the case of a dhow captured by her near Eas-Gameilah j and destroyed after her crew had fired on the ship's boats : the dhow was condemned. Id September twenty-five African slaves arrived at Muscat in the British India Steam Navigation Company's Steamer Kistna from Karachi in charge of some Arabs. They were, after enquiry by the Acting Political Agent, liberated with the assent of the Sultan and sent to Bombay; their release, however, called forth strong remonstrance from Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali to His Highness Sayyid Peysal. During this month the Resident at Bushire made a representation to the Political Agent regarding the wholesale importation of slaves into the Persian Gulf from Soor and the Batineh coast. During the year thirty-two fugitive slaves taking refuge at this Consulate were freed under the Treaty of 1873. The following men-of«war visited Muscat during the year. Her Majesty s ships Boadicea, Grifin, Cossack, Mariner, and Navy. Sphinx. Surgeon-Major A. S. G. Jayakar held charge of the office of Political Agent and Consul from 1st April to 30th November, when he was relieved by Colonel E. Mockler on return from furlough, who held charge from that date to the close of the official year under report. E.

The trade of South Persia during the year 1890 has not been so satisfactory as that of the previous year. Two causes have contributed to this somewhat unfavourable result. A short harvest, owing to late and scanty rainfall, and the violent fluctuations in the price of silver, resulting from legislation in the United States. Imports, Piece-goods were, it is true, imported in large quantities, and the north of Persia, especially the markets at Tehran and Yezd, Piece-goods. appear to show increased demand, but, as regards the south of Persia at least, the results have been unfavourable, not to say disastrous. In the pre vious year there were indications of a glut in the markets and continued large importations of cotton goods served to increase this evil. The advance in silver caused stocks to be pressed heavily for sale, and the Persian dealers, who thought they had bought at cheap rates, found goods offered at still lower rates falling week by week. The result in a market where credit is the rule and where native buyers are in general without reserves was inevitable, that is to say, cancellation of engagements became frequent and in many instances native dealers became insolvent. The demand has heretofore been principally for grey Mexicans and shirt ings, white shirtings, mulls and jacconets, there being little sale in the south for mors expensive goods. Imports of sugar were on an increased scale, and in excess of demand, leading to low prices and heavy losses. German loafsugar is not successful, and will probably be abandoned in favour of the Erench article. Erench and German granulated sugars, mostly beet, compete-successfully with Mauritius sugars, being imported at somewhat lower rates. The European sugars are imported to Persian ports in British steamers direct from London. Copi)er Copper was imported in less quantity than in the previous year, owing to high prices ruling in Europe. Exports. The quantity of grain exported was less than in 1888 and 1889. Advance Grain of silver quite stopped business for a time, prices in Persia not following that movement. In the early autumn home prices improved, and shipments were resumed and kept up steadily, though in small quantities, until the close of the year. The crop of opium was the largest on record, the total export from Bushire 0i)ium being 4,817 cases, of which 306 went to London and the remainder to Hong-Kong. The China market was, however, over-stocked, so that prices were too low to allow of profits, and in some cases heavy losses were experienced. The new American tariff has affected the demand in London, and it may be expected that growers will realize only lower prices in the ensuing season. Tobac co. Exporters have suffered losses in this article.18 administration report of the persian gulp political Owing to deficiency of grass in spring the wool clip was but poor in Wool quantity and quality, but what was exported to London sold well. In cotton the exportation was unsatisfactory. The large American crop Cottoii reduced home prices, whilst the rise in the rupee kept Bombay prices low, and shippers from Persia had to face heavy losses. Some trials have been made in shipping hydraulic pressed bales direct to London instead of, as usual, to Bombay, to be mixed with other qualities. It is thought that direct shipments to England will prove successful. A considerable trade was done in sweet-almonds, and it is expected that, Almonda with the opening of the new route connecting Sul- tanabad, Barojird, and Kermanshah with the sea this trade will be considerably developed. Preight . s Freights to England varied from 22s.6d. to 32sM. per ton. Exchange declined from krans 36 in the beginning of the year to krans 29 Exchange. P er P oun( i sterling, and subsequently recovered to krans 34. The Imperial Bank of Persia, having arranged with the New Oriental BankSi Bank Corporation to withdraw from Persia, secured the whole field for itself, and has opened branches in the most important centres of commerce. The first annual report has been encouraging and indicates favourable prospects. The mining rights of the bank have been sold to the Persian Bank Mining Eights Association, and this company has commenced work in the south. The mountains east of Bushire called the Gesikoon range were examined at a place called Naristan for coal but unsuccessfully. Machinery has been set up at Dalike to bore for petroleum. The plant has the latest improvement, and is suitable for boring to a depth of over 1,000 feet. The direction is entrusted to an able and energetic Austrian officer, with much experience of such work in Galicia, and if the success which is hoped for attends the interprise, it will be a source of much prosperity to the country, and particularly to the port of Bushire. Another company has acquired a tobacco monopoly for all Persia, and it is expected operations will be commenced from the approaching ' Nowroz,' Persian new year, which falls on 21st March. This concession will probably not be regarded with a favourable eye at first, and it will require tact and skill to overcome the difficulties which will be experienced in the working of details, but it is expected to be a remunerative undertaking.

P ART L- GENEEAL SUMMARY. 1.—'OMAN-MUSCAT COAST. The Report has been drawn up by Surgeon-Lieu tenant-Colonel A. S. G. Jayakar, and forms Part II of this compilation. Greater tranquillity has marked the past year in this State than has been known for a considerable time. This is ascribed by the Political Agent to the withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz, and to the loyal adherence of Shaikh Saleh- bin-Ali to the Sultan's party. The Sultan held himself aloof for the most part from the quarrels of tribal Chiefs; where, however, he stepped forward he was in most cases successful in bringing about a reconciliation. The Political Agent s report shows that, with the exception of a severe fight about the end of March 1891 between the Beni Omar and the Howasinah, in which a good many lives were lost, there has been less bloodshed amongst the tribes than usual. The caravan routes from Sharkiyyeh, which were closed to trade owing to the quarrels between the Sharkiyyeh and the Ghafri tribes in the Semail Valley, were re-opened in the year under report with material benefit to the export trade of Muscat. The fire in the Khaboorah bazar, resulting in heavy losses to British Indian subjects, mentioned in last year's report, was found to be the work of incendiaries of the Howasinah tribe. His Highness promptly agreed to the finding of a committee assembled to assess the losses which were finally fixed at $12,739, and payments are being made in monthly instalments. His Highness intends recovering about two-thirds of this sum from the Howasinah, some of whom have been imprisoned. The export trade shews a large increase; there is, however, a falling off in imports as compared with the previous year. The ratifications of the new Commercial Treaty were exchanged at Muscat on the 20th February 1892. 2.—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. The past year has been markedly free from disturbance, owing partly, perhaps, to fear of the coalition mentioned in last year's report as having been6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL formed by some of the Chiefs, and partly, perhaps, to the length and productive ness of the pearl fishery season. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khaimah opened a custom-bouse for the taxation of imports in June 1891. The Chief of Um-ul-Kawain being unable to obtain satisfaction for the claims of his followers, threatened to march against Ras-ul-Khaimah; its Chief, however, besought the aid of his kinsman of Shargah, and thus warded off an attack. In the early part of the year the Chief of Um-ul-Kawain showed some signs of indifference to his engagements with the British Government, but on a reference being made to him through the Besidency Agent, he acknowledged and promised to fulfil his obligations. Early in April 1891 Rashid-bin-Homaid, the Chief of Amjan, died. Inter ference was threatened by both the Um-ul-Kaiwain and Shargah Chiefs, the former of whom wished to see his son-in-law and the deceased's brother, Abdul Aziz-bin-Homaid, in power in place of the son of Homaid, and the proposal was favoured by the Shargah Chief. It was however frustrated by Homaid's form ing an alliance with the Chief of Debai and his succession was not further endangered. The British Government notified that as the Ceylon pearl fisheries were a failure, Arabs should not proceed there. All the Chiefs were warned, and but few of their dependents proceeded to Ceylon. Pearl diving commenced about the middle of May, or a little earlier than in the previous year, when the fishing was interrupted by 'Ramzan ' falling after it had begun. The result of the fishing was more than usually remunerative, and each boat is said to have earned more than $1,000 per voyage. Through the good offices of the Residency Agent the Chief of Shargah remained on friendly terms with Debai. The headmen of the Al-Murrah, tired of the oppressive action of the Chief of Debai, went to Shargah with some 400 men and induced the Chief to receive them and to send a vessel to their divers, telling them to close the season at Shargah. The Debai Chief endeavoured through the A1 Bu Falasha to per- suade them to return, but they declined to do so. Before leaving Debai they begged the good offices of the Al-Bu-Masa in obtaining for them better treat- ment by the Chief, but without any good result. The Agent is now endeavour ing to mediate a settlement of the claims of the Al-Murrah against Debai, and vice versa. In April 1891 the Chief of Abu Dhabi marched to Bereymi and was joined there by Hashir-bin-Maktoom from Debai with 300 camelmen and 30 horsemen. He then stormed and re-took the village of 'Ain from Saood-bin-Harar. Early in June the Shaikh proceeded on a visit to the Sultan of Muscat. The oppor- tunity was taken to arrange a difficulty that had arisen owing to the omission of the Sultan's Wali of Sohar to give the customary presents to certain visitors from the Beni Katab and Naim tribes. In former years under such circum- stances these tribes would have invaded and plundered the country until their claims had been satisfied. Owing, however, to the good offices of the Chief of Abu Dhabi, the Bedouins abstained from their usual course of action. Peace was established between the Chief of Abu Dhabi and the 'Al-Bu-Karuban sec tion of the Naim at Bereymi, and he married the daughter of the bolder of that fort. AH the Beni Ghafri tribes, including some hitherto considered as Jowa- simi, such as ^ the Beni Katab and the Beni Kaab, are said to fight now under the Abu Dhabi flag. Two Erench merchants, Messrs. Chapuy and Tramier, made trips across the Gulf from Bundar Abbas to the 'Oman Coast, apparentlyRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 7 with the idea of buying mother-of-pearl and also, perhaps, of taking part in pearl diving, but the latter intention, if entertained, was not carried out. A M. Pierrepoiut, said to have been a former partner of Messrs. Chapuy and Tramier, also visited tbis coast, ostensibly to buy mother-of-pearl, but was com pelled by an attack of fever to proceed to Europe. The rainfall was very small at Shargah, and hence cattle suffered from want of pasturage. 3.—BAHRAIN. There has been no change in the Government of these islands. Influenza broke out in Eebruary, and several deaths occurred. Small-pox. was prevalent and frequently fatal. In October 1891 a Mr. Strasburgner was sent out by an Anglo-Erench syndicate to report on the possibilities of the Persian Gulf pearl banks. He visited Bahrain and other ports with a view to obtaining information as to the methods, etc., of the Arab divers, but the result of his enquiries was not favour able to the introduction of European capital. In December 1891 the Shaikh gave a concession to a British firm at Bushire for the exclusive right to export shells, but withdrew it on the protest of the inhabitants and merchants of Bahrain on the understanding that it would not be re-granted elsewhere, and that the purchase and sale of shells should be free to all. The Chief, however, has imposed a heavy duty on the export of these shells, and it remains to be seen whether the trade can bear it. The date crop was excellent, and it was a good season on the pearl banks. 4.— EL -HASA. The new Mutasarif Said Pasha, who has twice before administered the district, arrived in May 1891. His policy is said to embrace the conciliation of the Bedouins, the restoration of their subsidies forfeited by his predecessor, and the removal of grievances previously allowed to pass unchecked. Arrangements have been made whereby the caravan route between El- Hasa and Ojair has become safe, and travellers free from molestation by Bedouins. Diarrhoea and influenza were rife during the year, and resulted in many deaths. 5.—EL-KATIF. Piracy, as carried on by the Beni Hajar in boats which they managed to surprise at anchor in various harbours and creeks, was very rife on these shores within Turkish jurisdiction, and a general feeling of insecurity prevailed, which was not allayed by any vigorous action on the part of the Administration. In fact, not a single capture was effected at sea, and any success against these rob bers on land was obtained by Arabs under Mahomed-bin-Abdul Wahab. Great discontent was said to exist at El-Katif owing to the introduction of new laws by the Turkish Government regarding land tenures, the succession to estates, and probate duty. Small-pox was prevalent at El-Katif also. 6.—NEJD. Affairs in Nejd appear to have undergone a decisive change during the year under report, as the once powerful Al-Saood family, who have hitherto maintained some hold on Nejd in spite of Mahomed Ibn Rashid's constant attempts to dispossess them, seem now finally to have lost it.8 administration kbport on the Persian gulp political Early in 1891 Mahomed Ibn Rashid suffered a severe defeat at Kasim, the people of which espoused Ahdur Rahman's cause. In March 1891. howeyer. having again assembled a powerful following, he attacked and defeated them; the Chief of Aneiza and his headmen were killed, and the Chief of Boreyda taken prisoner, and eventually died of wounds received in the battle. Maho- med Ibn Rashid thereupon appointed a Governor to rule the district in his name; and Abdur Rahman seeing things going against him retired to Bahrain for safety, leaving Nejd to Mahomed Ibn Rashid. In the meantime Mahomed Ibn Rashid's Governor at Kharj, after looting a band of pilgrims from El-Hasa, was defeated and slain in an attack on a party of El-Ajman. AMur Rahman seizing the opportunity of Mahomed Ihn Rashid's return to Jabal Shammar advanced on Karj and Riadh, capturing both places, and his affairs took a more promising turn. His triumph was, however, short-lived, for he was very shortly afterwards surprised and totally defeated by Mahomed Ibn Rashid, and had to seek safety in flight together with all the remaining members of his family. He subsequently tried to obtain the support of the Turks at El-Hasa, and in this he has been partly successful, for the Wali has applied for a pension for him from the Turkish Government. The Al-Saood, who in the time of their prosperity numbered some four score men, are now reduced to less than a score of broken fugitives. Abdur Rahman has since been living a wandering life among the Bedouins of El-Hasa and Hatif, being always in fear of capture by Mahomed Ibn Rashid's adherents. Mahomed Ibn Rashid by this victory seems to have broken the last opposition to his complete supremacy in Nejd, which it is said is now undisputed. 7.— EL-KATR. Reports from El-Katr showed that Jasim-bin-Thani still persisted in his refusal to obey any directions of the Turkish authorities at El-Hasa. It was currently reported all along the Arab Coast that they intended sending troops to coerce him, but so far this idea has not been carried out. At the commence, ment of the year a fight occurred between the Al'Ajan and the Al-Murrah, Beni Hajir. and Manasir, in which each party lost a few men. Some of the Beni Hajir seized a boat at Wakrah, and cut out six boats of the Al-Kubeisat, a tribe under Abu Dhabi, at the Island of Rarah, during the pearl season. Redress was sought by the owners from Jasim-bin-Thani, but he declared him self powerless to restrain the Beni Hajir. Early in this year a raid was made past, but at some distance from Abu Dhabi, by some of Jasim-bin -Thani's men. They were pursued from Abu Dhabi but escaped. 8.—PERSIAN A RACIST AN. The ' Shahab-ul-Mulk ' was confirmed in his post as Governor of Arabis- tan for another year from the nauruz. In May 1891 disturbances occurred amongst the Arab tribes near How- eizah, owing to the selection of an unpopular Governor for that place, the Beni Truf being the principal offenders. The Government sent troops to coerce the rebels, who were defeated in a sharp action outside Howeizah, and their Shaikh soon afterwards tendered his submission. These disturbances are now attributed to the intrigues of the Mustaufi or Treasurer of Arabistan, who was recently made a prisoner and sent in irons to Shushter. Arabistan generally was in an unsettled state, and the Anafijah Arabs under Shaikh Eerhan increased the feeling of insecurity by an attack on a caravan near Shushter in October last, in the course of which they carried off some rifles.&lt;&amp; RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 9 The Shaikh eventually made his peace with the Government and matters soon quieted down. During the past year the British India Steam Navigation Company's mail steamers commenced calling at Mohammerah, both on the up and the down voyages, their example being soon followed by other lines. Trade on the Karun has shown no signs of improvement, and in July 1891 Messrs. Lynch disconti nued running the Blosse Lynch, substituting for her a launch with a barge in tow. Through cargoes have lately been shipped from Bombay, and these may work a change for the better. The difficulties regarding accommodation at Ahwaz for goods temporarily stored there still exist. An arrangement between Messrs. Lynch and the Muin-ut-Tujjar, by which the latter was to build them convenient premises at Ahwaz is under discussion; and although it will probably be considerably altered in detail, if ever sanctioned by the Persian Government, some practical result will, it is hoped, be reached before long as the outcome. A Persian post office was opened at Mohammerah in Eebruary last, and a British post office will be established in the Vice-Consulate as soon as that building is complete. It is hoped that it will be finished in July next, but difficulties, now surmounted, regarding the site and estimated cost hindered the progress of the work for several months. A line of telegraph from Mohammerah to Ahwaz, Dizful, and Shuster was completed in August last year, and communication has been recently estab lished between Ahwaz and Bushire. An embargo was placed on the export of wheat from the Upper Karun districts but was subsequently withdrawn, as was also the embargo which had existed for some time on the Lower Karun. In January I paid a visit to Ahwaz, accompanied by Captain Kemball. His Excellency the Shahab-ul-Mulk received us with much cordiality, and discussed in a most friendly spirit the various questions which required attention. From Ahwaz we proceeded in the Shushan with Mr. Dicey, Messrs. Lynch's agent at Busrah, and Messrs. Holland and Gaskin, the agents of the firm at Shustar and iUrwaz, as far up the Diz as she could be safely taken. This was her second trip, the first having been made in August last. Though navigable in high rises to within a comparatively short distance of Dizful, the river is too rapid and tortuous to be a safe or easy means of transport, and the surrounding country too sparsely populated to supply much trade, most of which must con tinue to find its way by land to Band-i-kir. From Shushter the land carriage is shorter, and the river Shateit above Band-i-Kir easier of navigation than the Diz, so that probably this will continue to be the main route. 9.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST, It was the intention of His Imperial Majesty the Shah to visit Fars at the end of 1891, but owing to the prevailing scarcity which the presence of a large following would have increased, the idea was abandoned when prices began to fall. In February of this year the government of Fars was entrusted to His Royal Highness the llukn-ul-Dowlah in place of His Royal Highness the Motamid-ud-Dowlah, who was recalled after administering the province for about five years. Haji Samsam-ul-Mulk was appointed Deputy Governor. His Excellency the Saad-ul-Mulk was replaced as Governor of Bushire by his brother the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, previously Governor of Arabistan, and proceeded to Teheran where he has since remained.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Muhammed bin Abdullah bin Hasan was appointed the first Turkish Con. sular Agent at Lingah. No changes of importance took place among the minor Governors of districts. In May 1891 the Il-Khani was placed in charge of tbe Kashkais, Darab Khan, the former Il-Begi, dying the following month. The Il-Khani did not, long survive him, and died in January last; the headship has since been con. ferred on Nasr-ullah Khan. It was supposed that the Government in. tended dividing the tribe into four sections and appointing a Ketkhoda for each, but this has not been done. Husein Khan Baharloo having escaped from the fort of Jerash whence he was imprisoned, began raiding the villages of Darab and Fasa, many robberies being also committed near Shiraz by men of the Baharloo tribe. A force was sent against him from Shiraz, and a portion of it deserted to him, but he was eventually captured and taken to Shiraz, where he still is. In# December 1891 a disturbance took place on board the British India Steam Navigation Company's S.S. Kilwa from Bushire to Lingah, some Arab syces attacking the officers of the ship. She fortunately overtook H.M.S. Redbreast, whose commander sent an armed party on board and removed the ringleaders who were afterwards tried at Bombay and punished. In January 1891 a bugalow owned by British Indian subjects anchored near Kishm, the greater portion of the crew going ashore. During their absence $528 and $1,070 were stolen. The Persian authorities on receipt of a complaint suspected the Arab crew of a boat belonging to Hanriyeh on the pirate coast. They were arrested and sent to Bushire. After some delay the case was referred to the Shara Court at Lingah which acquitted the prisoner^ so they were released and their property was returned to them. It was after- wards asserted, apparently not without reason, that some of the crew of the bugalow were the thieves. In spite of an excellent harvest in the plain country the export of grain, from Pars and its ports was prohibited in June last, but all contracts entered into before the passing of the order were allowed to be carried out. An attempt was made by the customs farmer to levy ground rent on goods detained more than fifteen days in the custom-house, but it met with strenuous opposition from the merchants of Shiraz, and had to be abandoned. The prohibition against the importation of arms and ammunition into Persian territory was reiterated in July last, a large trade in rifles for sale in the interior having been apparently discovered by the Persian Government. The native merchants at Shiraz started an opposition to the Imperial Bank of Persia, but without any prejudicial effect on the Bank. Strong opposition having been manifested in various quarters, chiefly by the Mollahs, to the tobacco concession, it was withdrawn by the Persian Gov ernment in December 1891. In consequence of reports of cholera at Mecca, quarantine was imposed on arrivals from the Hedjaz and Yemen. A quarantine station was established, and cargo from Jedda was fumigated. Fortunately the epidemic did not visit Bushire. Influenza and small-pox were very prevalent in the island of Kislim, and many deaths occurred. Locusts have appeared in large numbers in Kirman and other parts. The crops in the plain districts have been very poor, and the price of grain has risen; it will probably do so much more, and the general outlook is gloomy.i KESIDKNCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 11 Early in the year representations were made by British Indian merchants at Meshed regarding the unsatisfactory manner in which customs fees were levied from them. They asserted that the 5 per cent, leviable by treaty did not suffice to clear their goods in transit through the interior, where they were sub- jected to various local impositions up to a total of 8 or 9 per cent. Similar com plaints were received from the merchants at Bundar Abbas, where an attempt was made by the Governor of Bushire to introduce the treaty rate of 5 per cent, at the port of debarkation, instead of the old rule of paying 3J per cent, at the port and 1^ per cent, at destination. The effect of this, without special arrange- ments with the various Governors en route, would have been to impose an extra IJ per cent. duty. The matter is now under discussion between Her Majesty's Legation and the Persian Government, with a view to the prevention of further dues being levied up-country after payment of the authorized 5 per cent, at the port of debarkation. It is still undecided as numerous vested interests have to be considered before any uniform system can be introduced. His Imperial Majesty the Shah sanctioned the establishment of a tidal observatory at Bushire, and the necessary excavations are being made prepara tory to placing the instruments in position. 10.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. In July 1891 Mir Abdul Nabbi Khan, the headman of the Jask district, who has been responsible for the telegraph line in his district from Sadeck to Jask, commenced levying the tax on grain and date produce on the plea that he had not been'paid his dues by the present farmers of the district. The Governor of Bushire thereupon sent the Naibs of Minab and Shamilah with 2,000 men to collect the revenue and to capture Abdul Nabbi, but they were unsuccessful. In January 1892 Abdul Nabbi again obtained the control of the country round Jask from the Deputy Governor of Bundar Abbas. The holders at first refused to give up the district, and some desultory fighting occurred, but with no definite result. Locusts proved very destructive round Charbar and Geah in July 1891. Mir Abdulla Khan son of Sirdar Dilawar Khan having refused in August to pay the Persian Government taxes unless his father, who was imprisoned at Kerman, was released, a force marched against him but was beaten off. Ab dulla Khan then took post in a fort in Dizak whence he tried, but without suc cess, to obtain terms, the only Sirdar siding with him being Mir Path Maho med Khan, Sirdar of Bampusht. In September he was captured and sent to Dizak. 11.—SLAVE TRADE. No slave dhows were captured during the year by Her Majesty's ships. Some reports of the importation of fresh slaves into Kishm were declared by the Governor of Bushire, after enquiry, to be without foundation. Information that several cargoes of slaves had passed up the Shat-ul-Arab for disposal in the villages along its banks and at Busrah was not confirmed on further enquiry. A dhow with twenty-nine negroes on board was detained at Pao by the Mudir, and they were sent to Busrah. The Wali, however, satisfied himself that they were not slaves, and they were allowed to return to the dhow. In the course of the year the Turkish Consular Agent at Lingah received from his Government a proclamation against slave traffic, issued in accordance with the Slave Trade Treaty between the British and Ottoman Governments, for publication amongst Turkish subjects at that port. ^12 • • administration report on the persian gulf political 12,—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS.

The dih July 1892,P art II.—ADMINISTRATION BEPOET OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONSULATE FOE, THE YEAE 1891-92. The general political condition of 'Oman during the year now under report, p ol ; tical which was one of continuous tranquillity, marred only occasionally by inter-tribal quarrels and blood feuds of a more or less important nature, contrasts strongly with the almost constant acts of rebellion and disquieting rumours of risings on the part of the Sharkiyyeh tribes against the ruling power, which used to occur in former years. The withdrawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz in the beginning of the previous official year from the sphere of 'Oman politics, and the loyal adherence of Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali to the cause of the present Sultan, have no doubt con tributed principally towards this peaceful state of affairs, almost unknown for many years in the annals of 'Oman. It is doubtful, however, if with this continued tranquillity of the province, the Sultan has improved or strength ened his position, for while the tribes of the Sharkiyyeh have all along held aloof from the central power at Muscat in the management of their own affairs, there are others%hich, though not actively opposed to it, have already shown indications of asserting their independence. The official year 1891-92 opened with rather a gloomy prospect for the trade of Muscat, on account of the caravan roads leading from the Sharkiyyeh having been closed by the coalition of the Ghafri tribes of the Semail Valley, • and the diversion of trade from that part of the province to Soor. As men tioned in the last Administration Eeport, a large kafileh from the Sharkiyyeh had been attacked and plundered by the Ghafri tribes of the Semail Valley, principally the Beni Jabir, and as the offenders refused to surrender the plun dered property, both the parties assumed and maintained a hostile attitude towards each other for a long time, but the Sultan, who at first showed a cer tain amount of indifference as to the result of the quarrel, having been even tually prevailed upon to intervene by Shaikh Saleh of Al-Harth, who were the principal sufferers by the raid, sent Shaikh Eashid-bin-Aziz and Sayyid Muhammad-bin-Masowd as his representatives to negotiate an amicable settle ment between the several tribes concerned in the dispute. This intervention and negociation on the Sultan's part resulted in an arrangement being made by which the Ghafri tribes were to pay the Harth $1,800 for all their losses, and had the desired effect of re-storing peace and re-opening the roads from the Sharkiyyeh to Muscat for traffic. In connection with the fire at Khaboorah referred to in last year's report which resulted in the loss of property belonging to several British subjects residing there, the Government of India having expressed an opinion that it was deliberately caused and held the Sultan primarily responsible for the pro tection of the property and persons of British subjects in His Highness's terri tory, and a committee having been appointed to enquire into the losses, it was decided that the sum of $12,739 was a fair estimate of compensation pay able to the sufferers. This amount the Sultan has agreed to pay in monthly instalments of $1,000 .each, and the Government of India expressed their satisfaction at the readiness with which His Highness accepted the award of the Punchayet. In order, however, to recover this indemnity from the Howa- sinah, the most influential tribe at Khaboorah, His Highness imprisoned four of their Shaikhs, two belonging to the Sawalim section, and two to the Hawa. mid. An arrangement was eventually effected with the prisoners, by which18 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL the two sections of the tribe were to pay His Highness $ 8,739, and the Sawalim prisoners having paid their share of it, namely, half that sum, have heen set at liberty, whilst the two Hawamid Shaikhs still continue to be in prison. Inter-tribal quarrels, resulting in many instances in open hostilities, are of almost constant occurrence in 'Oman. Several of them took place during the year. The first, and judging by its result the most serious one, occurred about the close of the last official year, when the Beni Omar tribe having attacked the Howasinah near Khaboorah, were repulsed with a loss of 170 killed, and 20 taken as prisoners, the latter losing only 16 killed. This was followed by hostilities between the two sections of Al-Naerm tribe of Dank and Bereymi, and subsequently between the Beni Alee, the N'asem, and the Beni Kelban tribes of the Dahireh, in which several men were reported to have been killed. The only other quarrel of any importance was between the Beni Shikeil and and Beni Hina tribes of 'Oman Proper, which, arising from the simple cause of Shaikh Hilal bin, Zahir of the latter, attempting to erect a fortified building over a piece of land purchased by him from the Beni Shikeil, threatened at one time*to assume a very serious aspect; but through the friendly mediation of a Shaikh of the Abrieen, the two tribes have now amicably settled the difference between them. In the month of July an affray took place betwee* the Khojas of Matrah, many of whom are British subjects, and some Arabs at Gala, which place the Khojas are in the habit of visiting in the hot season. The dispute seems to have arisen at first over the hire of a donkey, but the general affray which resulted from it might have ended more seriously had not the Wazir Sayyid Muham mad bin Azzan, who happened to be living at Boshar then, intervened in time and effected a reconciliation between the parties. A threatening letter, however, was sent by some Arabs near Ziki some months afterwards to the principal Khojas with regard to a claim they had on account of the death of a slave belonging to them, which they alleged was due to injuries received during this affray, but on a proper representation having been made to the Sultan, His Highness gave the Khojas every assurance and promised to take steps to pre vent any further complication. The Saltan's younger brother, Sayyid Pahad, proceeded to Zanzibar in the month of November for the purpose of marrying one of the daughters of the late Sayyid Bargash bin Saeed, and returned with his young wife about the end of March. The Resident visited Muscat in the month of Pebruary for the purpose of ratifying and exchanging the new Commercial Treaty with the Sultan. He arrived here on the 19th in Her Majesty's I. M. S. Lawrence, and left in her on the 21st. There were no seizures of slave dhows Slave Trade. , . .. during the year.

During the past year trade did not diminish in volume, hut was not alto gether satisfactory to those engaged in it. The tendency to import goods in excess of the probable requirements of the country, to which attention was drawn in recent reports, was more marked than ever. Increased competition, pushed too far in the hope of driving rivals out of the field, resulted in re peated accumulations that could not be rapidly worked off, and in no little loss. More than one European firm suffered from failures amongst Persian mer chants, but these, whether caused by imprudent speculation or arising under more suspicious circumstances, were not extensive, and they have probably served to teach British firms a not unneeded caution in fixing the limits of the credit which they are prepared to allow to native dealers. At the time of writing this the prospects of profitable trade are far from bright. Owing to the recent decline in the value of silver, added to the glut caused by previous over-importation, large stocks of piece-goods up-country are unsaleable except at a heavy loss, nor does there seem to be any immediate hope of an improvement in exchange. Several steamers that usually load for the Persian Gulf have been taken off the line for the time being. Export business also appears likely to be much restricted for some time to come, as the usual embargo on the export of grain is not likely to remain altogether a dead letter this year, in which the crops in Southern Persia are very poor. Imports. Arms and Ammunition. —Strict orders prohibiting the importation of these in any form were issued by the Persian Government, but were not probably enforced with much strictness, as no corresponding reduction was made in the demand from the customs farmer. Candles. —The business done in this article was normal, but is said to be hardly remunerative. Cotton Goods, —Demand was brisk for the first quarter of the year, but slackened as time went on ; and by the end of the summer, owing to over-im portation and a rise in exchange, business had become unprofitable, continuing so to the end in spite of a steadily falling home market. The smaller native dealers had been a good deal crippled by the adverse exchange of the previous year, and some failures occurred; but, as stated above, none of great import ance. European firms however would do well to consider the question of credit to native traders who are not, apparently, very scrupulous in fulfilling their engagements, and are with difficulty brought to account when they have evaded them. Glass and Glassware. —The trade in these articles, the latter of which mostly comes from Austria, steadily increased during the year. Gold Lace and Thread. —The demand fell off. This is said to be due to the importation of inferior kinds from Prance, whereby superior qualities from Germany are driven out of the market. Metals. —The trade in copper was dull, and only such quantities as were actually needed were bought. Iron, on the other hand, both rod and bar, was largely imported from India as well as from Europe. Large stocks were still c 2V 20 administration report on the persian gulp political on hand at the close of the year, and could not be disposed of profitably at market rates. Sugar. —The market in loaf sugar was overstocked at the beginning of th« year, as the result of the large imports of 1890 and shipments were in conse- quence restricted. Rates improved in the summer, and after a temporary fall recovered again at the close of the year, when they were fairly remunerative. The bulk of this sugar comes from. Marseilles, and German loaf sugar now finds no market here. In soft sugar the importations from Europe were smaller than usual. The Mauritius supplies the greater portion, and it is received, shipped through Bombay, in better condition than that from London, Tea. —A taste for Indian in preference to Java tea has sprung up, and though Java tea, which replaced China varieties some time ago was still im. ported, there was a still greater demand from Calcutta. Exports. The wheat and barley crops in the south of Persia were excellent, although owing to the rain ceasing early in the season, the grain was smaller than usual. The export was large and continuous, and probably exceeded that of any pre vious year. Shipments were made both to London and to Indian ports, where remunerative prices were obtained in consequence of short crops in Europe and the enhanced value of sterling, even in spite of the large quantities of grain offered for sale. Eventually, however, rates fell, and the Jews, who were then the chief exporters, lost considerably. The export of cereals has been steadily increasing of late years, showing that the area of cultivation must be also widening. The usual embargo was placed on the export of grain—shipment only permitted on the payment of special fees. As remarked earlier in this report, it is not improbable ttiat this embargo may be enforced this year, both because the crops are not good, and also because the administration of Ears has passed into other hands and different views may prevail. Cotton. —Persian cotton, owing to false packing, imperfect cleaning, etc., is not in high repute in the London and Liverpool markets, and the year's transactions were hampered by low prices both in India and in Europe. The crop itself may be profitable to the grower, but is not so to the exporter who buys from him, considering the risk to which he is exposed of a constantly fluctuating market. There are considerable stocks now on hand, and these will have to be shipped in order to realise, even if there is but little improvement in prices. Opium. —The opium crop was unusually large, but owing to the persistent fall of prices in China, speculators were heavy losers. The scale of shipment? however, varied very little, being slightly larger to London where it is usually sent by European firms for use in the preparation of morphia, and smaller to China. The- fall in prices has been as marked as it has been rapid. Only two or three years ago shippers could obtain §500 a chest in China, and £14 a pound in London. Now the prices obtainable are $350 and Is. Qd, respec tively; and as this article has been often exported to the extent of 7,000 chests, it is obvious how many interests are affected by these fluctuations in value. Wool. —This is generally exported by Persians, and is sent first to Bussorah where there are facilities for cleaning, sorting, and pressing it, ? it is not highly thought of, and the trade in it is said not to be profitable. Most of the wool goes to London, and a fair amount was shipped, but prices did not encourage exporters.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1891-92. 21 Tobacco. —The monopoly obtained by the ' Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia, Limited,' last year, was withdrawn by the Persian Government this year, and export on acconnt of private firms is again allowed. It is understood that the exclusive right to import Persian tobacco into Turkey, where it is mostly consumed, has been given to a ' Societe du Tombac,' and it remains to be seen whether shippers will be able to export on favorable terms. Almond kernels. —A considerable trade was done in this article during the early part of the year, but large crops in Europe sent prices down, and the exports from Persia ceased to be profitable. Gum. —This was exported in fair quantities, chiefly by Persians, and fetched good prices. Woollen goods, —Carpets from Sultanabad are now exported by the Bagh dad and Bussorah route as being cheaper. Freights, —Freights varied from 27s. 6&lt;i. per ton in the spring to 86^. in October, and closed at 305. after an intermediate fall to 25s. The demand for tonnage to London was steady, and a much larger number of steamers than usual loaded from the Gulf. Tonnage for India was also freely taken up, whilst grain shipments were active, but fell off afterwards, and the state of the Bombay market does not encourage the hope that there will be much enquiry for it at present. Exchange. —Exchange was not so unstable as it had been in 1890, until quite the close of the year, when there was a sudden marked rise from krans 31 to krans 38, and it has since risen still further, completely checking imports and increasing the difficulty of working off existing stocks. Minerals, —The boring for petroleum at Daliki has been continued during the working months of the past year, and a depth of 620 feet was reached. The work progressed more slowly than before owing to blocks in the bore-hole, but the engineer has now reached a depth of 1,000 feet, and the indications of oil are said to be more favourable. Work has been stopped as usual during the summer. A leading American firm having retired from Busrah, the importation of kerosine oil from America ceased, and Russian oil from Batoum was im ported direct by steamer. A. C.

TALBOT, Lieut.'Colonel, Folitical Resident, Fersian Gulf,ADMINISTRATION REPORT op the PERSIAN GOLF POLITICAL RESIDENCY and MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY for 1892-93. P art I.—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—'OMAN MUSCAT COAST. The Report has been drawn up by Major J, Hayes Sadler, and forms Part II of this compilation. The political affairs of 'Oman have been markedly quiet. Since the with drawal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to Indiaj no attempts have been made against the Sultan of Muscat. But His Highness has unfortunately been unable to pre vent old inter-tribal quarrels between the Hinawi and Ghafris from breaking out afresh. The small fights that continually occur when these tribes are at feud, though not causing great loss of life or property, yet engender a sense of insecurity among the more peaceful inhabitants of the towns situated on the trade routes, and so re-act seriously upon the commerce of the principal 'Oman ports. During the latter half of the year 1892, the routes from the Sharkiyeh were closed against the Hinawi caravans until January 1893, when the Sultan negotiated a peaceful settlement of existing disputes. The robber chief, Shaikh Hamud-al-Jahafi, who in 1884 was the cause of considerable trouble to Sayyid Turki, suddenly appeared in the Batinah during October 1892 with seventy followers. His unexpected arrival occasioned some concern, but being taken ill at Manh, he retired to the Sharkiyeh. . Sayyid Abdul Aziz is still in India. His Highness the Sultan has not yet come to terms with his uncle for his permanent residence there. The total value of the trade of Muscat for the year under report shews a decrease as compared with that for the preceding year, which is attributed by the Political Agent to the disturbances in the Sharkiyeh. These have not appa rently affected the import trade which shews a large increase. The consent of the Sultan was readily given to the construction of a tidal observatory at Muscat in February 1893. 2.—'OMAN PIRATE COAST. In November the Resident proceeded in H.M.S. Sphinx accompanied by fl.M.S. Cossack and the R.I.M.S. Lawrence to the 'Oman Coast for the pur-6 ADMINISTHATION UEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL pose of exacting penalties imposed on the Chiefs of Dehai a Shargah, Himriyeh and Ras-nl-Khymah, for breaches of the slave trade treaties. In July last the Chief of Abu Dhabi forwarded some correspondence which he had with the Wali of Bussorah, showing a disposition on the part of the Turkish officials to connect him with the attack on a caravan by the Manasir tribe between El-Hasa and Ojair in which $90,000 were said to have been plundered. In reply to the Wali's letter, which was couched in threatening language, Shaikh Zaid disclaimed all responsibility for the misdeeds of this wandering tribe. The transfer of the Wali shortly afterwards made it unneces sary to pursue the subject any further. The opportunity, however, was taken to suggest to Shaikh Zaid that, although he appeared to have a complete answer to the accusation of the Wali, it would be well if he used his influence with the tribe to dissuade them from acts of violence even beyond his own territory. The Shaikh, however, on this as on previous occasions asserted that the tribe were, in no way, under his control. So far back as September 1891 it was reported that seven boats belonging to Abu Dhabi had been attacked by ten pirates from Wakrah and robbed of the pearls they contained. Enquiry was rendered more difficult by the Chief's omission to furnish particulars. The Agent afterwards proceeded in person to Abu Dhabi, but without any useful result, and the case is still unsettled, as no further evidence has been produced by Shaikh Zaid, The conduct of the Chief of Debai has not been altogether satisfactory during the past year. In September last a boat with twelve armed men was sent from Debai to the assistance of the Ajman Chief, who was then in fear of an attack by the Chiefs of Shargah and Cm-ul-Kawain. As this was a breach of an undertaking to forbid the transport by sea of men and munition of war, it was marked by a fine, which was levied during the Resident's visit in November, A good deal of trouble was caused in the settlement of claims against and by the Al-Murrah tribe, referred to in the last year's report, as having migrated from Debai to Shargah on account of alleged ill-treatment by the former Chief. These claims were eventually adjusted through the mediation of the Hesidency Agent with the exception of a sum of $293, part of an old account already settled, of which the Debai Chief evaded payment until required to make restitution without further demur. It is understood that the Chief has still some claims outstanding against the Al-Murrah. The Chief himself was absent during the Resident's visit in November, but the opportunity was taken to impress upon the person in charge of the adminis tration the necessity for considerate treatment of British subjects at Debai,, some of whom had complained of having been threatened by the Chief. In September last the Chief paid a visit to the Sultan of Muscat, returning overland thence to Bereymi, where he married into the Al-bu-Shams sept of the Naim tribe. At the end of December he became seriously ill, and it was at first supposed that he had been poisoned, but his illness now appears to have been a stroke of paralysis. In March 1892 a party of Debai subjects crossed over to Sir Abu Muair island, which belongs to Shargah, and prevented people from Siri, who are Jawasims, and therefore of the same tribe as the Chief of Shargah, from fishing there, and disarmed them. The Residency Agent was therefore directed to require the withdrawal of the intruders and the surrender of the arms. The Chief of Debai was also recommended to obtain permission in future from theI RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1892-93. 7 Chief of Shargah before using the island as a fishing ground, and he agreed to do so. In September the Chief of Shargah, accompanied by Sultan Ibn Muhammad Naimi, visited Debai and renewed with the Chief's representative the truce between the two Chiefs, which events at Ajman had contributed to impair. The Chiefs of Shargah, Debai, and Ajman, who have succeeded to their Chiefships since the conclusion of the agreement of 1879 between the trucial Chiefs regarding the rendition of absconding debtors, have now subscribed to it. In September last Sultan Ibn Muhammad, Chief of the Nairn, and Abdul Aziz-bin-Homaid, uncle of the Chief of Ajman, again laid schemes to depose him, and were joined at Shargah by the Chief of Um-u]-Kawain. The idea, however, was abandoned on the receipt by Ajman of timely aid from Debai, and an understanding was effected between the rival parties by the Chief of Shargah. The Chief of Ajman subscribed to the regulations forbidding despatch of armed boats by sea. The action of the Chief of Himriyeh, a feudatory of Shargah, in allowing slaves to be landed in his territory, was brought to the notice of the latter Chief, who, however, professed his inability to compel his feudatory to fulfil the requirements of the slave trade treaties : while therefore a fine for a breach of these treaties by Himriyeh was recovered from the Shargah Chief as the head of the tribe, the Himriyeh Chief was required to submit to the authority of Shargah, and during the Resident's visit in November an arrangement was made between the two Chiefs which it is hoped will obviate further contumacy on the part of Himriyeh, The Himriyeh Chief, who is a busy-body, is the frequent cause of jealousy between the Shargah and Debai Chiefs, with the latter of whom he is very intimate. The Chief of Ras-ul-Khymah was conspicuous amongst the trucial Chiefs for his disregard of slave trade treaty obligation, and was accordingly punished by a heavy fine in November last. The Chief has complained of losses to Ras-ul-Khymah subjects at Bander Abbas and Khargu, Enquiries are being made, but, so far, the Persian author ities deny the alleged facts, 3.—BAHRAIN. In April last the Chief, apparently by advice of the person then Kazi, one Shaikh Jasim, issued an order appropriating one-third of the property of de ceased persons. This order, however, gave rise to a good deal of dissatisfaction, and was subsequently withdrawn. Piracies by the Beni Hajir continued during this year's pearl-diving season. Several boats belonging to Bahrain were attacked and plundered by them. After one of these robberies, in which cargo and specie, amounting to $2,000, was plundered, the Mutasarif of El-Hasa sent twenty soldiers from El-Katif to Bahrain as an escort for boats plying between Bahrain and Ojair, and they continued for some time to perform this duty, of course in their own boat. The vigilance of the Turkish authorities in their own territorial waters was not sufficient to prevent attacks on Bahrain boats plying between Bahrain and El-Katif, and several of these petty piracies went unpunished. In August last fears were entertained by the Chief of Bahrain of an attack on the island by Shaikh Jasim-bin-Muhammad-bin-Thani and Nasir-bin-8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Mubarik, who had met and were reported to be collecting forces in the north of El-Katr. The alarm became so acute that the British Indian subjects at Bahrain embarked their property in boats in the harbour. Warning letters were addressed to both the Shaikhs, and the Turkish authorities at Bussorah promised to order their local officials to prevent any ex pedition against Bahrain from the mainland. The idea of such an expedition, if really entertained, was abandoned, and Nasir-bin-Mubarik went to El-Hasa. From there he was reported to have gone to Kowait with the object of obtaining funds from the Shaikhs of that place, for the settlement of the Beni Hajir in some fixed place. The Shaikhs were said to have proposed, as conditions, that four principal men of the tribe should reside in Kowait itself, and the rest near it, with the Ajman tribe, and that the Beni Hajir should be responsible for any disturbance by sea or land. The negotiations seem to have fallen through, and no terms were arranged. Towards the close of the year the Porte having raised a question of the right of the British officials to take up the cases of Bahrain subjects, who had suffered by the piracies of the Beni Hajir, was informed that Bahrain was under British protection. The Resident visited Bahrain in July last in R.I.M.S. Lawrence. 4.—NEJD. There is nothing special to report regarding the doings of Abdul Rahim- bin-Eeysal during the past year. In August he was living with Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, and was afterwards given a house in Al-Bidaa, which he had selected as his future residence, on receiving an allowance from the Porte. His family joined him there from Bahrain. In November he went to El-Hasa at the invitation of the Wali of Bussorah, and is said to have been assigned an allowance of 33 liras a month, on condi tion of his living at El-Hasa. 5.—EL-KATIF. In March 1892 it was reported that the Kaim Makam of El-Katif had received instructions to appoint officials at El-Katif, Ojair, and El-Katr, to levy port-dues. This report proved to be correct as regards El-Katif at least, for in December the Chief of Bahrain represented that port-dues were being levied there on Bahrain boats. Enquiry, however, showed that this tax was levied on all boats entering El-Katif harbour and not on those of Bahrain alone. The Beni Hajir pirates carried on their depredations at El-Katif itself and close to it. In May last two boats were reported to have been seized by them at Ramus to the north of El-Katif. They were pursued, and put to flight, by Muhammad-bin-Abdul Wahab who recovered one of the boats. In the following month another band of twenty-five Beni Hajir seized a buggalow at El-Katif and put to sea in search of plunder. The Turkish -soldiers, who were sent in pursuit, failed to overtake the huggalow^ which a little later came up with a boat belonging to a El-Katif merchant, with a cargo valued at RljSOO. The Beni Hajir, after plundering her of everything, including her gear, restored her to the nacoda with three bags of dates, a little water, and a small sail. The Turkish soldiers after cruising in search of the pirates without success returned to El-Katif.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOK THE YEAK 1892-93. la September a party of Beni Hajir were reported to have boarded a Persian boat from Hasineh wbich was beached at El-Katif. They killed the nacoda, wounded two of the crew, and carried off $700. Troops were sent in pursuit by the Kaim Makam, and ten of the robbers were said to have been captured, but none of the booty was recovered. About the middle of October the Wali of Bussorah, accompanied by two Turkish gunboats and a regiment of infantry, arrived at El-Katif, route for El-Hasa. The troops were disembarked and sent in boats to Ojair to march with His Excellency to El-Hasa. The Wali, soon after his arrival, was stated to have arrested the Kaim Makam for some unknown reason, and he was afterwards taken as a prisoner to El-Hasa. His successor appears to have inaugurated a more active policy, for proclamations were issued by him at El-Katif, doubtless by the authority of the Wali, declaring Bahrain and 'Oman to be within Turkish jurisdiction, and Turkish flags were offered to the nacodas of Bahrain boats, who, however, refused to accept them. Under these circumstances there was at first a suspi cion that the troops with the Wali might be used against Bahrain. The Porte, however, disclaimed any intention of so employing them. 6.—EL-HASA. In May 1892 it was reported that a caravan proceeding from El-Hasa to Qiair under an escort of twenty-five Turkish soldiers was attacked on the 14th idem by some three hundred Bedouins of the Manasir, Bern Hajir, and Al- Murrah tribe, who were reported to have killed fifteen and wounded ten persons ; carried off booty estimated at $50,000 in cash, and $20,000 m goods, and plundered some forty pilgrims with the caravan. They were said to have sent the booty to El-Katr, their place of refuge, with Jasim -bin-Thani, for sale there, Various robberies in the neighbourhood of El-Hasa were also attributed to the Beni Haiir and Al-Murrah, and the townspeople were said to travel in bands of a score or so of armed men under the escort of a Bedouin whose presence insured their safety from the tribesmen. The first action of the Wali on arrival at El-Hasa appears to have been to take security from the principal people of the town and neighbourhood, as he had done at El-Katif, to have no dealings with the Beni Hajir, Al-Murrah, and Manasir, who thereupon retreated into the desert. A number of the Arabs of El-Hasa were appointed to convoy caravans between it and Ojair, thus leaving the Wali free to employ the whole of his force against the Bedouins. The troops appear to have made one or two raids against the tribe, and carried off a number of cattle and camels, but no serious encounter took place. In Eebruary the Wali marched from El-Hasa taking with him the regi- ment of infantry which accompanied him from Bussorah, and three hundred cavalry who had marched via Kowait. The two gunboats were ordered to meet him at Al-Bidaa. 7.—KOWAIT. Abdullah-bin-Sabah, Chief of Kowait, died in May 1892, and was succeeded by his brother Muhammad-bin-Sabah. The latter is said to have received orders from the Ottoman Government to consider the country between Kowait and El-Katr and also the sea coast as being under his jurisdiction, and to arrange as he thought best for its security from Bedouins. No steps, however, appear to have been taken by him to give effect to any such instructions.10 ADMINISTRATION EEPOUT ON THE PERSIAN OULE POLITICAL In March 1892 another member of the family of Mubarak-bin-Sabah attacked an encampment of the Beni Hajir, killing four and carrying off a number of their camels and sheep. The Beni Hajir retaliated later on by surprising a Kowait boat at night, killing two of the crew, and making off with $200 in cash and the weapons on board. In Pebruary 1893 Shaikh Mubarak-bin-Sabah received orders from the Wali of Bussorah to march to El-Hasa, which he reached some time in March with a force of Bedouins estimated at one thousand eight hundred men. 7.—EL-KATR. The piracies by the Beni Hajir were not confined to Bahrain and El-Katif waters, but extended also to Wakrah, near which a boat belonging to a tribe under the authority of Jasim-bin-Thani was attacked and carried off, being finally abandoned near Zobara. A second boat belonging to Shaikh Jasim was boarded near Dhaayen by Beni Hajir, who killed two and wounded one of the crew, and made off with the pearls on board. Shaikh Jasim started in pursuit, but failed to capture the pirates. A gang of the same tribe under Salman-bin-Yatimah were con. cerned in an attack near Wakrah on a Persian pearl-boat from Jezza, in which they killed ten of the crew, wounded thirteen, and carried off the pearls on board. The same band seized another pearl-boat belonging to Shargah and carried her off to Khor Shajij, about fifteen miles north of Al-Bidaa. Shaikh Jasim sent men in pursuit both by land and sea, and succeeded in capturing the pi- rates with the property, which, with the boat, he made over to the crew. The robbers after imprisonment for a time at Al-Bidaa were released at the inter cession of the elders of the tribe. The Turkish gunboat S. S. Sahir was said to have captured twenty-five of the Beni Hajir pirates in September last—twenty of them near Al-Bidaa, who were made over to Shaikh Jasim, and five near El-Katif. There has been no official confirmation of this report. The Wali of Bussorah appears to have arrived at Al-Bidaa towards the end of February, with the object of calling Shaikh Jasim to account for his suppos ed complicity in the doings of the Beni Hajir, Manasir, and Al-Murrah tribe. His Excellency wrote to Shaikh Jasim, who was at Wajbah about four hours' march from Al-Bidaa, to come in and pay him a visit. Shaikh Jasim declined to do so on the plea of his fear of arrest, and the Wali, on the other hand, refused Shaikh Jasim's proposal that they should meet at some place in the desert, attended by small escorts, to discuss matters. After refusing all Shaikh Jasim's offers for a settlement which would not involve his personal surrender, the Wali imprisoned Shaikh Jasim's brother Ahmed and twelve of the principal men of Al-Bidaa, and marched out to sur- prise Shaikh J asim at Wajbah. In this he failed, the tribesbeing on the alert, and in the action which ensued, the Turks lost, it is said, about one hundred and fifty men, the Arab loss being more than four hundred ; and the remainder of the Tur kish troops fought their way back to the fort at Al-Bidaa, the Arabs being kept at bay by the fire of the gunboat S. S. Mirrikh, to which the Wali himself retired. Shaikh Jasim now seized the wells on which the water supply of the town and fort depends, and was thus able to dictate terms for the release of his brother and the other Arabs. The Wali was compelled to sue for the safe conduct of his cavalry overland to El-Hasa and for the protection of the troops in the fort of Al-Bidaa,Spending a reference to the Ottoman Government The events that have happened since the commencement of the current official year will more fittingly find a place in next year's report. (HESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY POR THE YEAH 1892-93. 11 8.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The Sahab-ul-Mulk continued his government of Arabistan throughout the year, but was replaced in Marcb of this year by His Royal Highness the H isam -u s-Sultaneh. The crops between Ahwaz and Shuster and on the Lower Karun were very poor last year, and this, combined with the weakness of the Governor, contri buted, no doubt, to the lawlessness that was from time to time reported to be prevalent in the province. The Jazali section of the Beni Truf Arabs near Ahwaz and the Sagwand Lurs on the Dizful and Shuster roads were the principal offenders. In April 1892 the Governor arrested the two Il-Khanis of the Bakhtiaris, Imam Kuli Khan and Reza Kuli Khan, and invested Isfandiyar Khan with the Ohiefship of the Bakhtiari. The deposed Il-Khanis were summoned to Tehran in August last. The present year's arrangements, through which the control of the Bakhtiaris has been separated from the Governorship of Ara bistan and made over to His Hoy al Highness the Zil-us-Sultan, have resulted favourably to the two Il-Khanis, who have been placed in charge of the tribe. Isfandiyar Khan in turn journeyed to Tehran. A fortnightly Persian postal service was organised between Mohammerah, Shuster, and Dizful. The interchange of mails has been arranged between the Persian post office at Mohammerah and the Turkish post office at Bussorah. A Persian post office will be built at Mohammerah this year. A British post office was opened in the Yice-Consulate at Mohammerah in July 1892. The Persian Foreign Office Agent was at first disposed to be obstructive until necessary orders for the recognition of the post office were received from the Governor of Arabistan. The Persian telegraph office at Mohammerah was undermined by high tides in May last and collapsed. The working of the line between Bushire and Ahwaz during the year seems to have been satisfactory. If a sufficient number of telegrams from Bussorah could be counted on, the Persian Government would consider whether the line could be worked for English messages as well. Early in the year the S. S. Shushan was taken down to Bussorah for repairs, and she was unable to re-cross the rapids owing to lowness of the river until December last. The Persian Government was asked to permit the use of a launch and barge on the Upper Karun so as to keep up communication with Shuster until the S.S. Shushan could be taken over the Ahwaz rapids, but it was considered by the Persian Government that this would be a violation of the regulation for the navigation of the Karun, and the request was refused. Trade on the Upper Karun was therefore monopolized by the Naseri Com pany, which took advantage of the opportunity to raise its rates of freight. Messrs. Lynch have recently built and placed on the Lower Karun a powerful paddle-wheel steamer the S.S. Malamir of the same general design as, but slightly smaller than, the steamers on the Tigris. She seems to have already attracted a larger passenger and goods traffic. The position of the Muez-es-Sultaneh, Governor of Mohammerah, as an owner of steamers on the Karun and also customs farmer, gives him a great advantage in competition with Messrs. Lynch, as he is always able to offer native merchants a reduction on freights in order to attract their custom. There is b 212 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL still a much heavier charge on goods carried by steamers to Shuster and thence to Dizful, as compared with that levied on goods sent by caravan, and until this disparity 'is reduced by lowering and amalgamating the various local charges, it is not to be expected that the river route, in spite of its greater speed and security, will receive any great development. The question of accommodation for Messrs. Lynch at AhwaZj referred to ia last year's report, is still undecided, but has now reached a point at which a speedy settlement may be hoped for. The influx of arms into Arabistan still continues, and about a thousand Martini Henry rifl.es were imported at Bunder Mashur by native merchants^ from Kowait. In March last the Resident and First Assistant proceeded on tour up the Karun and Garghar rivers as far as Shuster. Erom Bund-i-Kir they ascended the Diz in the 8^. Shushan in order to ascertain whether this, the third of the three rivers meeting at Bund-i-Kir, was navigable for purposes of direct trade with Dizful. The S.S, Shushan arrived within sight of Kut Abd-us-Shah, which is 24 miles from Bizful, and this is the furthest point to which the river has been navigated. There had recently been a high rise, but the rapidity with which the water fell on the numerous shallows found in the higher reaches compelled the speedy return of the S.S. tfhushan and would effectually prevent any use being made of the Upper Biz as a trade waterway. P.-FAES and PERSIAN COAST. The Nizam-us-Sultaneh continued as Governor of Bushire until early m September last, when he was succeeded by his nephew Reza Kuli Khan as Deputy Governor for the remainder of the year. This year he has been appointed Governor-General of Ears in place of His Eoyal Highness the Rukn-ud-Bowlah/ The Saad-ul-Mulk has been again appointed Governor of Bushire. Haji Nasrullah-Khan, in spite of some opposition in the tribe, continued as Il-Khani of the Kashkai. His Eoyal Highness the Rukn-ud-Dowlah commenced his rule by dealiog severely with the Kawam-ul-Mulk, a powerful but unpopular Shiraz noble, who is the chief landed proprietor in the province and virtually controls the Arab tribes. The Kawam-ul-Mulk shortly afterwards proceeded to Tehran whence he was directed to retire to Meshed. The revenue collections are believed to be largely in arrears, while the state of the districts has been most unsettled; robberies and murders by the Arab nomad tribes being frequent. One of these tribes, the Baharloo, aggrieved at their treatment by the Governor of Darab, went into outlawry in October last. Troops were sent against them from Shiraz under the Il-Khani, and they moved with their families towards Bander Abbas, closing the trade routes, plundering caravans, and spreading the greatest alarm by their depreda tion almost up to Bander Abbas. H.M.S. Cossack was ordered from Bombay for the protection of British subjects at Bander Abbas, where she remained until all danger of an attack was over. Persian troops were sent from Bushire and other coast ports in the S.S. JPersepolis, and the Prince Governor of Kir man was ordered to intercept the rebels trom the north. The Arabs retreated and no fighting took place. The troops have now returned and traffic on the caravan route has been resumed. It is (RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOU THE YEAH 1892-93. 13 understood that a pardon has been offered to the Baharloos by the new Gover nor-General on condition of their future good behaviour, and probably the return of their patron, the Kawam-ul-Mulk, from Meshed contributed to their pacification. The Governor of Darab has now been arrested. The epidemic of cholera, which raged virulently in the northern parts of Persia, did not penetrate further south than Shiraz. It first showed itself at Iklid, six stages from Shiraz, having followed the caravan road from Meshed : thence it spread gradually to Pasa and Niris. Comparatively few cases occur red at Shiraz itself, but it was not until December that the disease finally died out. The mortality at and round about Easa is said to have been one thousand five hundred; at Istabanat and Shiraz two hundred each. Disturbances occurred in the Bushire district owing to feuds between Khan Ali Khan of Bander Rig and Muhammad Khan of Rudhilla, and to the discontent of both with the Governor, whose policy it was to play off one against the other. Muhammad Khan of Angali, however, was murdered in a blood-feud, and his rival appears to have made his peace with the Government. In December Jafar Khan, the Zabit of Dilam, was said to be evadino- o payment of revenue, and thirty soldiers were sent by the Deputy Governor of Bushire to arrest him. The townspeople rose in his favour and a fight ensued in which the soldiers were worsted. Jafar Khan was afterwards replaced by the Zabit of Eeshire. The Indian observatory, mentioned in last year's report as being in course of erection at Bushire, has been in working order for some months past. In April 1892 Muhammad Hasan Khan, Deputy Governor of Bander Abbas, w 7 as appointed to the charge of Lingah also. In May some fighting was reported in Lar between the Governor Path Ali Khan and one of his sons. There was a renewal of the disputes between them early this year, but it is not known with what result. In October a British Indian subject from Bahrain reported that he had been robbed of about 26,000 hrans at Naband by some of the Beni Malik tribe. Orders have been issued from Tehran for the restoration of the stolen property. In June 1892 a Bahrain boat lying off Kasr Konar was plundered by eleven armed men at Bander Tibbin, and cash and goods, valued at R880, were stolen. Application for redress was made to the Prince Governor of Pars, but so far without result. In August 1892 a determined attack was made on Kasr Konar by the A1 Bu Pakhara, who formerly farmed it, but were supplanted by another tribe and immigrated to El-Katr, where they have resided for the last eighteen years. According to the accounts received seven of the inhabitants of Kasr Konar were killed and property valued at 70,000 hrans was carried off. In retalia tion the Kasr Konar people shortly afterwards seized three boats belonging to El-Katr. A complaint of this was made by Shaikh Jasim-bin-Thani, but he was informed that unless he prevented such outrages by people within his juris diction, he must expect reprisals. The case is still pending. A disease, supposed to be cholera, broke out at Eadan near Bander Abbas, and thence spread to Minab ; it does not, however, appear to have been of a severe type. It is hoped that the Persian Government will construct a telegraph line from Bander Abbas to Jask; during the recent disturbances at Bander Abbasu ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL such a line would have been very convenient both to the Persian Government and to the Residency in supplying early news of what was happening. The customs question at Bander Abbas and Meshed referred to in last year's report has been finally settled ou the basis that the treaty rate of 5 per cent, should be paid on both imports and exports, and no dues be levied in the interior. 10.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. Owing to a blood-feud Sardar Wali Muhammad Khan's followers besieged twelve Dashtiyari families in the Parak fort, the first telegraph line guard's station from Jask, and stopped their water supply. The besieged after losing a child by thirst surrendered, and the feud was terminated by their giving a man to their enemies. Mir Abdul Nabi, the farmer of the district about Jask, was reported to have overtaxed the people, and to have been opposed at Sireg by Mir Haji, son of Mir Yusuf of Biyaban. Subsequently Mir Ali Khan collected troops to march on Biyaban, the people of which had refused to pay the taxes he imposed upon them; nothing further, however, seems to have resulted from this dispute. Mir Haji was afterwards appointed Governor of Biyaban. In September last complaints against Mir Abdul Nabi were received from him and from Mir Kambar, who had been placed in charge of the district between Khu-i-Mubank and Ohileak, that he was stirring up people against them and preventing the collection of revenue. Both parties were warned against creating disturbances. After a long correspondence with the local Persian authorities regarding the abduction of two women, mother and sister of the lineman of the Tele graph Department at Jask, the case was referred to Her Majesty's Minister, Tehran, and orders have been issued by the Persian Government for their release and return to Jask. There was a serious outbreak of small-pox at Gwadur in March, April, and May 1892. Every effort was made to induce the friends of those attacked to allow their isolation but without success ^ the Hindu and Khoja merchants refusing to permit their removal to hospital. In October it was reported by the Wali of Gwadur that the Kinds de manded the surrender of seventy slaves who had absconded to Gwadur, and threat ened in case of refusal to create a disturbance. The Wali was informed that the surrender of the slaves would be contrary to the orders of the Govern ment. The Political Agent, Southern Baluchistan, was also communicated with, and a warning was conveyed by him to the Rinds. They have lately renewed their demands and as a precaution the Sultan of Muscat has strength ened his garrison at Gwadur by twenty men. The matter is receiving attention. Some cases of black-mailing caravans by the Rinds of Mand have been brought to notice, but none of importance. A troublesome case of cattle theft occurred at Gwadur in which eight head of cattle, the property of Government servants at Gwadur, were stolen with the connivance of the headman of the Nagore district. After a long investigation the Sultan of Muscat eventually agreed to pay the value of the cattle, recover ing it afterwards from those concerned in the theft. Sirtip Zain-ul-Abadin Khan was Governor of Bampur during the year. Mir Abdullah, cousin of Sardar Muhammad Ali Khan, Governor of Kowtah^ having been murdered by the Hots of Bahu Kalat, the Sirtip and Sardar surrendered Bahu in October last. The dispute was settled by the Hots paying 55,000 and giving a marriageable girl, and exchanging the fort of Balm for one at Chaker.

There were no captures of slave dhows by Her Majesty's ships during the year under report. The visit of the Resident to the pirate coast in November last to exact penalties for breach of slave trade treaty has already been mentioned. The principal offender was the Chief of Ras-ul-Khymah, who, with his relation and subordinate, the Chief of Khor Eakan, had sheltered the importer of thirty- three slaves from Zanzibar. A few cases of importing slaves into Persia were brought to notice during the year; in most instances the slaves were traced and given their freedom. Three freshly-imported slaves were discovered by the Residency Agent on the Arab coast, and were forwarded in due course to Bombay. 12.—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS. Commander Hart-Dyke, r.n ., H.M.S. Sphinx, was Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf Division, until Pebruary 1893, when he vacated his command on promotion and was succeeded by Commander J. H. Pelly, r.n. H.M.S. Cossack was on the station as Senior Officer's ship during Octo ber 1892, and, at the end of January, was detailed for duty at Bander Abbas, where she remained about a fortnight, leaving the Gulf again early in March 1893. H.M.S. Sphinx proceeded to Bombay to pay off in the middle of March, and was relieved at Muscat by H.M.S. Brish. 13.—POLITICAL APPOINTMENTS. Captain Kemball, First Assistant, left for Baluchistan in the beginnino* of May 1892, and was succeeded on the 21st idem by Lieutenant Beville, who was transferred to Bussorah on the 30th July. Captain S. H. Godfrey arrived on 11th November and continued as Pirst Assistant until the end of the year. Surgeon-Captain Duke was in medical charge until the 29th January 1893, when he proceeded to Meshed as Residency Surgeon. He was succeeded on the 7th of February by Surgeon-Major G. M. Giles, F.R.C.S., who held charge for the rest of the year. Mr. B. T. Ffinch, Director, Persian Gulf Section, Indo-European Telegraph Department, who had for many years held a political charge on the Mekran coast, relinquished office on the 31st March last on promotion as Director-in- Chief. He has been succeeded in the Directorship by Mr. J. Possmann. 14.—OBSERVATORY. The results of the daily observations are recorded in a tabular statement marked Appendix A. The summer was long and trying; during the past winter, gales have been frequent, and one, on the 17th November, was accom panied by a hail-storm of exceptional severity which did a good deal of damage.

The year under report has been one of comparative tranquillity for 'Oman; Poiit;ca] no coalition of tribes against the central authority took place, and the general peace was only disturbed by those inter-tribal quarrels and feuds from which the country is rarely, if ever, free. Poremost amongst these in its effect on the trade of Muscat was the re opening of hostilities between the Ghafri tribes of the Semayil valley and the Hinawi tribes of the Sharkiyeh. Rumours had been current since the commencement of the year of an intended coalition of the Ghafri tribes with a view to cutting off the communications of the Hinawi of the Sharkiyeh with Muscat and Matrah, and it was known that the Haboos were by no means satis fied with the award made by His Highness last year. The peace then concluded was not expected to last. No collision, however, occurred till the middle of August when the Haboos raided on the Rahbiyeen and made off with seven hun dred goats ; the latter tribe not being able to obtain satisfaction, the Ghafri tribes of the Semayil valley joined together and blocked the roads leading to the capital against Hinawi caravans from the Sharkiyeh. Matters remained in this state for some months, no actual fighting taking place; several attempts made by His Highness to bring about an understanding failed, and trade with the Sharkiyeh was at a standstill. In the meanwhile eight hundred of the Nidabiyeen, the Rah biyeen and the Beni Jabir leaving the passes blocked marched on Masfa, burnt the village and cut down two hundred date-palms belonging to the Tamimah in reta liation for a murder of a Nidabi who was answerable for the safe conduct of a small party of the Beni Harth, Beni Amr, and Beni Hadram on their return journey to the Sharkiyeh when they were attacked by the Tamimah. About the middle of January His Highness came to the conclusion that he could no longer with due regard to his own prestige hold aloof from the affairs of the Semayil valley, and that more active measures than he had hitherto employed had become necessary; he accordingly set out via Seeb to personally settle the differences between the contending factions; he was certain of the co-operation of the Ghafris, but it was questionable whether the Shaikhs of Haboos would come in. After some negotiations these Shaikhs met the Sultan, and peace was concluded on the condition that the Haboos should pay their opponents $1,200 as compensation for life and property. As this compensation was in reality to be defrayed by the Sultan, the Haboos accepted the terms, and after the conclusion of the negotia tions returned to their homes, taking the opportunity on the way of looting some cattle from one of the tribes with whom they had just made peace. A truce for one year was also effected between the Yal Waheebah and the Ghafri tribes of the Semayil talley. Turning to the Batinah we find the Yal Saad, the strongest tribe in 'Oman in point of numbers but not remarkable for courage or warlike qualities, estab lishing a blockade of the routes from the Dhahirah to the sea in consequence of successive raids made on them by the Ahl Dhahirah. This brought about a coalition of the Yaakib, the Beni Kelban, and the Beni Shikeil, the principal tribes of the Dhahirah against the Yal Saad. An advance on each side was driven back, and in January the coalition of the Ahl Dhahirah broke up, their differences with the Yal Saad remaining unsettled. Repeated raids were c a20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GrXJLF POLITICAL however still made on the Yal Saad, nearly all resulting in loss to that tribe in life and property, on one occasion two caravans aggregating seventy camels being cut off. In Eebruary this tribe turned the tables on its opponents by pursuing a party of eight men who had carried off some of their goats and killing them to a man. About this time it was reported that Ibrahim-bin-Kais had espoused the cause of his old friends the Yal Saad and offered to mediate between them and the Ahl Dhahirah, being ready it was said to join in an attack on the latter should they refuse his mediation. Later information since the close of the year under report is to the effect that these negotiations fell through, and that no further raids have taken place. Of other collisions between the tribes the following may be noted:— Early in the year the Harth raided on the Haboos at Mudeibee in the Sharkiyeh, and attempted to destroy their water-courses. In August an en gagement took place between the Beni Boo Ali and Beni Boo Hasan in Jaalan, in which nine men were killed. A truce for eight months was effected by Shaikhs Jooma-bin-Sayyid-al-Maskari and Hamud-bin-Sayyid-al-Jahafi, which was broken by the Beni Boo Hasan killing a slave belonging to the Bern Ali, who thereupon made a raid on the former tribe. This was followed by the plunder of a large caravan of a hundred camels belonging to the Beni Shikeil o£ Nezwa by the Beni Hasan of Wadi Boshar. A short truce was subsequently brought about. Certain differences between the Jinbeh and the Hinawi tribes of the Sharkiyeh were settled in September, and a peace for one year was concluded through the mediation of ilashid-bin-Uzeiz, the Wali of Semayil. In October that troublesome character Shaikh Hamud-al-Jahafi appeared suddenly in the Batinah with seventy followers, evidently with the intention of marauding. British subjects at Seeb were warned to be on the alert, and, if necessary, to move into Muscat with their property. Whatever plans Shaikh Hamud may have formed were cut short by his being taken ill at Manh ; he subsequently returned quietly to the Sharkiyeh. The question of an allowance to be paid to Sayyid Abdul Aziz on condi tion of his remaining quietly in India was again discussed with the Sultan. The matter is still under reference. On the 12th November the Besident visited Muscat and exchanged visits with His Highness the Sultan. In May 1892 a party of seven Africans were landed at Matrah under suspi- 01 m , cious circumstances by an Arab by name Slave Trade. o, .« , . , i j Seif-bm-Khatir. The party was stopped, and an euquiry was held, from which it appeared that the Africans were the house hold slaves of two Arabs in Melindi. Before the completion of the enquiry the Africans left the Consulate at the instigation of Seif-bin-Khatir and went into the interior. Although the local authorities were at once warned, proper measures to pursue and recall the party were not made, and repeated applica tions since made to the Sultan to trace the Africans have hitherto produced no result. A report in the case was submitted to the Hesident on the 16th March 1893. No seizures of slave dhows were made by Her Majesty's cruisers during the year. (% RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1892-93, 21 Sixty-four fugitive slaves appeared in the Consular Court during the year under report to claim freedom.

General Remarks. —The marked decline in the trade of the ports of Southern Persia for the year 1892 s as compared with that for the preceding year, may be chiefly attributed to three causes, viz., the glutted state of the markets owing to the accumulation of stock referred to in last year's report, the failure of the crops occasioned by a scanty rainfall, and the decline in the value of silver. Minor considerations assisted in rendering the commercial state of affairs still more unsatisfactory. A rebellion of the Baharloo Arabs has considerably interfered with the trade of Bander Abbas both by re ducing the receipts of the people, and by preventing the transit of goods to and from that port. The Tobacco Corporation not only disturbed the amicable relations previously existing between Europeans and Persians, but made it impossible for native merchants to do the usual lucrative trade in this article, and added to this, previous losses by failures of Persian merchants had shaken credit, and the European firms considerably reduced their transactions in this line of business. The bad harvest too not only affected the export trade and consequently the shipping interest in reducing the demand for freight, but also considerably diminished the purchase power of the districts affected. At the beginning of the year there were heavy stocks of all kinds in the interior. While these were being worked off exchange went from bad to worse, so that on nearly every transaction the profits on the sale were made away with by the loss in exchange. It was impossible to rectify this by raising prices in propor tion to the fall in silver for the Manchester markets were quoted lower every week, and importers preferred selling in the hopes of replacing their stocks later on at reduced prices. Towards the end of the year, however, a decided improvement set in. Advices from America gave higher quotations for cotton, and there was a sharp rise in Manchester. Prices here then steadily rose, and most people have been in a condition to recoup the losses previously sustained. The growing influence of the Mullahs has not been without its effect upon commerce. It is reported from Ispahan that the inhabitants applied to them for protection against what they considered ill-treatment on the part of European firms when the latter raised the prices of their goods. Meetings of the Mullahs and merchants were held and matters were eventually arranged between them. One cause, calamitous as it was for the districts concerned, has operated favourably for the trade of the southern ports. The epidemic of cholera, dis organising trade in the north of Persia and hindering communications along the routes affected, has caused the wants of Tehran and places further north to be supplied by imports through Bushire. It is hoped that the depression of trade is temporary only, and that the causes are mainly local, for the figures of the Bahrain trade and the returns of the principal articles of export and import of the ports on the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf for the past year show an increase in the commerce done there. The outlook for the trade of 1893 is encouraging. The rains have been good and they have commenced early, and thus enabled a larger area of land than usual to be brought under cultivation. At the time of writing, the local harvest is reported to have been the best that the country has seen for the last sixteen years.24 administration repobt on the persian gulp political It has been noted that Russian enterprise is endeavouring to open new fields for their cojnmerce, by means of the Societe pour le commerce et Vindus. trie en ]?erse et Asie Centrale. This Company, established in Tehran, is said to be looking southward for an extension of operations, and to be contemplating the opening up of trade from the Black Sea and through the Suez Canal with the Persian Gulf. An important incident in the Persian trade of 1892 is the establishment, by the Imperial Ottoman Bank, of correspondents in the important towns of Persia. I mports. Arms and ammunition. —The prohibition against the importation of articles under this heading has possibly been carried into effect with more strictness at Bushire during 1892, than in the preceding year, for the returns now show a total of 25 packages only as against 296 for 1891. There has probably been a diminution in their import; but information obtained from the Karun districts makes it clear that large quantities of Martini Henry and other arms and ammunition find their way into Arabistan, probably smuggled through Kowait, Mohammerah, and Hawaizah. The Arabs inhabiting the banks of the Karun and Diz have large numbers of Martinis which are only bought when sold with some hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Candles. —Business in this article followed the general depression. High rates of exchange are reported to have prevented its being remunerative. Cotton goods. —When the year opened, stocks in the hands of middlemen and retail traders were large and no new business was in consequence entered on. The prices ruling did not rise with the rates of exchange. The demand just before the Persian Nauroz (21st March), always the best season of the year, was scarcely appreciable, and as the Bamadthan, the month of fasting, approached, the bazars were practically closed. When business was resumed retail traders unable to dispose of old stock were naturally unwilling to embark on fresh ventures. In June a little more activity was visible, but prices did not rise to the level required by the adverse exchange, and business again slackened. The markets continued dull till the close of the year, when reports of the failures of the American cotton crop and consequent advances in Man chester first costs had the effect of hardening prices, but the advances obtained here were not parallel to the rise in Manchester nor even to those obtained in the Northern markets. A profitable business is usually done by retailers despatching mixed parcels to agents in the outlying districts, but owing to discouraging reports, the known scarcity of money, no inclination to venture appeared this year. An important feature in this trade has been the reported diminution in imports by Europeans and its comparative increase by Persians. Glass and China ware. —Trade in these articles was neglected. Gold lace and thread. —Trade in this has fallen off and continues to be dull. Indigo. —There was a much larger import of this article during the past year, which shows that the native industry of printing and dyeing, which has hitherto been languishing, owing to the competition of Manchester, is increasing* Metals. —The trade in copper has been dull and without fluctuations. The bazar people unwilling to pay higher prices bought only for immediate re quirements, and as the price of this metal kept at about the same level in Europe during the whole of the year, there was hardly any speculation. There was a considerable decline in the import of rod and bar iron during the year. / vresidency and muscat poltticai agency toe, the year 1892-93. 25 Owing to the outbreak of cholera in Russia and the consequent closing of the trade routes in the north of Persia there was a brisk demand for Marseilles loaf-sugar, and large orders were sent to Marseilles, whence the sugar was shipped to the Gulf and forwarded to the interior of Persia via Bushire, Bussorah, and Baghdad, Later on the imports increased to such an extent that mule hire from Bushire to Shiraz, 167 miles distant, rose to krans 1*20 per maund or one-third of the value. Stocks of sugar in the south are now very large and prices are declining. The extraordinary rise in the prices seems to have attracted the*attention of Russian refineries, and importations of Russian loaf- sugar in Tehran are reported. It is said that the Marseilles loaf-sugar will in future compete successfully with the Russian article, which may have to recede from the Tehran market, if not further north. Mauritius sugar was also im ported in large quantities. Tea. —This article continues to be imported in large quantities, India and Java being the principal suppliers. Exports.

The business in this article during the past year was chiefly restricted to native merchants who bought for the Bombay market, European firms exporting only a very limited quantity to London. The trade in this article fell off during 1892. Cereals. —Owing to a scanty rainfall the harvest was very poor and yielded barely sufficient for local requirements. Export therefore was im possible, and at the end of the year prices were so high that several cargoes of barley and wheat had to be imported from Bussorah and India. The little that was exported at the commencement of the year belonged to the previous year's stocks. It is said that much of the dissatisfaction that prevailed among the inhabitants last year was engendered by dearth and the general depression in trade. Cotton. —Owing to the dulness in foreign markets, a limited area was cultivated, and what little was grown was partly destroyed by locusts. When therefore a demand arose in the English markets owing to the failure of the American cotton crop, Persia was only able to dispose of its old stocks. Persian cotton is shipped to Bombay, where it is used for mixing with other kinds. Direct trade with Europe is hardly ever remunerative. The business in this article was solely confined to the Persians. A smaller quantity than usual was planted in the south of Persia and exports were on a reduced scale. Gum. —Exports of this article to India and London increased in 1892. There was a good demand the whole season. The export is chiefly to India, whence it is said to be re-exported to Europe. Opium. —This article, in which every well-to-do Persian merchant likes to invest a good part of his capital, was not in great demand in Europe or in China, and prices obtained in Hong-Kong and London were low. At the end of the year higher quotations were telegraphed from China and some good business was done by holders of stock, but prices have again come down to their former level and business is now dull. Shells. —A large quantity of shells was gathered along the Persian Coast, but were much inferior to the ordinary sorts usually sent. Tobacco. —As mentioned in the Report for last year the Imperial Tobacco Corporation of Persia has had to stop its operations. But as this Corporation26 administration bepout on the persian gulp political had previously purchased large quantities of the tobacco of the country exports for native account have been very small. Ihese, however, ar 0 now on the increase. Wool.'*—Export of wool took place on about the same scale as last year. Miscellaneous. Exohdnge. —There was a continued rise in the rate of exchange, the value varying from krans 36 per £ sterling at the commencement of the year to krans 40^ at its close. This was in conformity with the Bombay-London rate which ranged roughly between ]§. and Is. 2^d. per rupee. Freights. —These ruled very low and are the best criterion of the contempo raneous condition of trade. During 1891 freights varied from £1 7s. 6^. to £1 16s. During the year under report they hardly ever exceeded £1 10s., while they declined to as low a figure as fifteen shillings from Bussorah. The avail able tonnage for London was in excess of the demand, although several steamers which usually loaded to and from the Gulf sought employ elsewhere. It is improbable that there will be much improvement until the new harvest is ready for shipment. Mule hire. —A most important item in the trade of Persia, especially in the import branch, is the rate for which transport by mule caravans can be secured. # of 7| fb each. The year opened with a quotation of 1 167 miles. krans 55 per 100 Tabriz * maunds to Shiraz f and this steadily declined till, towards the beginning of April, the rate stood at krans 38, and this rate continued with a rise of up to krans 5 until October. Transport then rose to krans 52 and again 62. The year closed with a quotation of krans 80. JPetroleum. —The Imperial Bank Mining Rights Corporation have not apparently been successful at Daleki, and although a depth of 1,600 feet is said to have been reached, no oil has been found. It is said that the boring there will be stopped, as it would hardly pay to raise the mineral from so great a depth, if any should be subsequently tapped. This Corporation has also started boring at the Island of Kishm. The opinion of the people on the spot however seems to be that the chances are against success. Local demand continues to be met from Russia only. A. C. TALBOT, Lieut,-Colonel, Political Resident, Persian Qulf, (SELECTIONS FEOM THE RECORDS OF THE GOVERNMENT OF INDIA, FOREIGN DEPARTMENT.

The Keport for the year, forming Part II of this compilation, has been prepared by Major J. Hayes Sadler. Political tranquillity has generally prevailed as regards the Sultan's authority, which has not, however, been sufficiently strong to suppress inter-tri bal feuds. These have been active and have led to numerous raids and repri sals, resulting in a good deal of bloodshed. In an attack by the Yal Saad on the Ahl Dhahireh at Mubrah early in the year, the loss in killed and wounded on the two sides amounted to about 160. Hameyd-bin-Salim, a marauder, better known as Kurta, began raiding in the Sharkey eh in September, and in February advanced towards Kurryat. The force there was strengthened by His Highness, and the tribes having closed the passes, Kurta turned back and subsequently sued for pardon. The definite refusal of Sayyid Abdul Aziz to accept the pension proffered to him was communicated to His Highness the Sultan in October. Sayyid Abdul Aziz has, however, continued to reside in India. Notwithstanding the strenuous efforts made for their recovery, no trace Las been found of the seven slaves mentioned in last year's report for Muscat as having been imported from Africa. Trouble was threatened in the outlying Muscat dependency of Gwadur whither a large number of slaves of the Rinds of Mand in Mekran had fled for refuge from their masters. The presence of these refugees being a source of danger, as likely to incite their former masters to violence for their recovery, their removal to India was in every way encouraged, and a large number were accordingly conveyed there. An attempted breach of the maritime peace was visited-with a fine on the offending Shaikh, who had carried an armed party by sea to prosecute a claim to certain property at Shaam; and in a case of the kidnapping of an African passenger m a native craft, the vessel was confiscated and the nakhoda im prisoned, the kidnapped man being released.6 ADMINISTRATION BEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL A. very plGasing incidGnt in ttiG a/nnals of Oman was th.6 prompt and effective action taken by His Highness the Sultan for the relief of the victims in the loss by fire of the S.S. Khiva off Marbat, on the South Arabian Coast, in April. His Highness's humane conduct has received the recognition of the Government of India. To it and to the shelter and protection afforded by the local Shaikhs and friendly tribesmen, the safety in life and property of over 1,000 persons was largely due. Excluding specie, an increase appears in the total value of the trade of Muscat. As regards imports and exports, the position of the preceding year has been exactly reversed during the year under review, the imports, especially from India, having decreased, while the exports have largely increased. 2.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. This coast was visited in the end of April by the Kesident in H. M. S. Sphinx. Cholera spread from the interior to the coast at the end of the hot season, and though its prevalence was not for very long, there was considerable mortai- ity, especially at Eas-el-Khymah, Shargah, Debai, and Abu Dthabi; it had disappeared by the end of October. An interference with the disposal by the Hindus, according to their reli- gious rites, of the body of one of their community who had died at Abu Dthabi was brought to notice. The Chief endeavoured to justify the action of his son while in temporary charge of affairs during his absence. This conten tion could not be admitted; and the Chief being required to make restitution of the fee which had been levied, refunded the money to the Hindus. At the instance of the Chief of Abu Dthabi an attack was made on Hair, \ one of the towns of the Kowasim, by the Shoohooh tribe. After some of the \ people of the town had been killed, its fort was destroyed. Debai has been at enmity with both Shargah and Eas-el-Khymah. The trouble between the two tribes, in connection with the Marrars, which was re ferred to in last year's reports, continued, and the efforts to arrange matters through the Residency Agent were unavailing, the Shargah Chief being in a large measure responsible for the failure. Other differences arose and resulted in openly declared hostilities in November, into which the people of Ajman were also drawn on the side of Debai. Both parties finally had recourse to the good offices of the Chief of Abu Dthabi, who, in March, effected a reconciliation, arranging for a settlement of their mutual claims, and appointing agents to carry it out. The claims concerning the Marrars were excluded from this settlement, and were left to be dealt with under the authority of the Resident, The Shargah Chief had not evinced a conciliatory attitude with regard to this case with Debai, and appeared disposed to avoid meeting the Resident. An assembly for a full investigation of the claims was, however, insisted on, and at this, under the firm and judiciously exerted influence of Mr. Gaskin, Assistant Resident, a satisfactory adjustment was made. Advantage was also taken of this visit to exact from the Shargah Chief the balance of a fine imposed on one of his subjects for importing a slave in November 1892. The conduct of the Chief, altogether, had not been quite satisfactory, and the complimentary gifts usually bestowed on these visits were withheld. A complaint was made by the Ajman Chief of his boat having been fired upon by the people of Haireh. The charge was denied, and it has not been possible to fully substantiate it. There is, however, reason to believe that some demonstration of the kind was made, and as such an act would be a breach of the maritime truce, a serious warning was given. (&gt;n RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 7 '% — Eas-el-Khymah territory was liable to raids from Debai in consequence of the hostilities between the latter and Shargah, which have been referred to. ^ It was also threatened with an attack by the Chief of Bokha in the same con- Niljj nection. No redress has yet been obtained in the complaints by Eas-el-Khymah subjects referred to in the last report; the Persian Government has not even furnished a reasonable answer to these charges of outrage at Bunder Abbas and Khargu, which, there is reason to believe, are well founded. 3.—BAHRAIN. A new tax on divers and pearl boats, imposed by the Chief of Bahrain, caused much discontent. The result of the year's pearl-fishing showed a great decline, the take being only about one-third of the average. This was mainly due to the outbreak of cholera, which appeared in July and soon became very severe, the mortality rising at one time to 150 daily. The epidemic had ceased by the end of August, when some 7,000 persons in all are said to have fallen victims to the disease. This number is probably exaggerated. In August the Kaim-Makam of El-Katif again caused notices to be posted up at that place asserting Turkish sovereignty over Bahrain ; and the Wali of Busrah, on a protest being made against such pretension, appeared disposed to support the Kaim-Makam's action. The Porte, however, withdrew from this position, claiming only to treat the people of Bahrain as Turkish subjects within Ottoman territories. On this point the right to extend British protection to the subjects of the Shaikh, whenever occasion might demand, was maintained. H. M, S. Lapwing was sent to Bahrain to restore general confidence in November^ There were some complaints of the treatment of Bahrain boats visiting El-Katif. Shaikh Salman, son of the Chief of Bahrain, died near Eiadh in August while on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca. In March last heavy rain fell in Bahrain and caused much damage to pro perty and houses, six or seven men being killed by the fall of houses. 4.—EL-HASA AND OJAIR. In consequence of the reports in June of a large tribal gathering of the Beni-Hajar, Al-Murrah, and Manasir, to attack the Beni-Khalid, it was necessary to provide a guard ot Turkish troops to escort the El-Hasa caravan for Ojair. The projected raid collapsed, the tribesmen returning with little booty. In Eebruary 1894 the Bedouins of the Dowasir tribe raided a caravan on the road between El-Hasa and El-Katif, and carried off some goods ; on learn ing, however, that the caravan was escorted by a man of their tribe, the robbers made restitution. 5.—EL-KATIF. Cholera broke out at El-Katif and lasted for over a month in July and August. At the commencement of the outbreak, the death rate was 10 to 15 daily ; it subsequently rose to 50 or 60 daily. The Wali of Busrah visited El-Katif on his way back to his head-quarters from El-Bidaa in May. The people of the place having petitioned against the Kaim-Makam and complained against his malpractices, he was removed from his post in July.8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL The new Governor, Raouf Effendi, did not, however, assume charge of the duties of his post till January. In January, the Turkish gun-hoat Mujdeh-Resdn arrived at Katif with 90 military reliefs ; 30 of these were landed at Katif for Ojair, and the re. mainder were conveyed to Katr. In September 1893 a Kowait boat, which was beached at Katif, was at tacked by fifteen robbers. In the struggle which ensued the crew were wounded and put to flight, and one of the robbers was killed. The robbers then seized the arms and effects of the crew, together with Rs. 50 belonging to the nahhoda, and decamped. They were pursued by the Customs people of Katif, who, however, failed to overtake them. 6.—EL-KATR. In last year's report, the action fought near Wajbah between the Arabs under Shaikh Jasim and the Turkish troops under the Wali of Busrah, was noticed. According to the information obtained, the Wali marched on the night of the 25th March with the object of surprising Wajbah, where Shaikh Jasim was residing. In this he failed, and the Arabs collecting, attacked and defeated in detail the Turkish troops, who had scattered in pursuit of small bodies of the enemy. The Turks were finally obliged to retreat; and after considerable loss, reached the shelter of the fort at El-Bidaa under the guns of the Merrihh, which afterwards fired on the town. The total Arab loss, including women and children, who, being driven out into the desert, perished from exposure, has been stated at 420, which is probably an outside estimate. On the Turkish side the loss has been set down at 40 to 100 ; and as both parties may be sup posed, though from different motives, to be inclined to reduce the number, the higher figure is perhaps not very wide of the mark, excluding some of the wounded sent to Busrah. Por the collision the Wali would seem to have been responsible, he having attempted to carry matters with a high-hand, and to have found himself un equal to the crisis he had provoked. After these hostilities the Arabs, abandoning El-Bidaa, dispersed into vari ous villages, and Shaikh Jasim returned to the fort at Wajbah. The Turkish gun-boat Merrikh remained off El-Bidaa, and a punitive expedition on the part of the Ottoman Government was expected. Affairs being in this position, the Eesident was instructed to proceed to the spot in view to arranging, if possible, a settlement, and arrived off El-Bidaa in the end of April. Yisits were exchanged with the Wali, who, how ever, in the absence of instructions from his Government, declined to discuss affairs or to recognize any intervention. Meantime, the R. I. M. S. Lawrence, arriving with news of the dismissal of the Wali, Colonel Talbot felt no longer under the necessity of consulting him, and proceeded to Wakrah, where he had an interview with Shaikh Jasim. The attitude of the Shaikh was very temperate ; and while maintaining that he had been forced into hostilities, he undertook to accept any settlement that might be arranged for him, and urged that this might be brought about as early as possible, in order to prevent the loss of the whole pearling season. fortunately, temperate and pacific counsels prevailed with the Ottoman Government ; the Nakeeb of Busrah, a friend of Shaikh Jasim, was deputed to Katr and being the bearer of very moderate demands, was able to arrange matters satisfactorily. A sense of security was thus restored, the Arabs return ed to El-Bidaa, and pearl-fishing was resumed.RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY POR THE YEAR 1893-94 9 The final result of these events has been the replacement of Shaikh Jasim as nominal Kaim-Makam by a Turkish official. With regard to the garrison at El-Bidaa, Shaikh Jasim has objected that it has been maintained at a strength largely in excess of what had been promised. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. His Royal Highness the Hisam-us-Sultaneh remained throughout the year as Governor-General of Arabistan, and was re-appointed in Pebruary last for a further period of one year. His administration has been, on the whole, successful, and the country has enjoyed comparative tranquillity owing to his tact and moderation in the treatment of the tribes* Timely concessions to the wishes of the tribes of the district averted hostilities in the early part of the year. The principal Chaab tribes had deposed Shaikh Abdullah Khan, Governor of Ealahieh, and appointed Shaikh Jafir Khan in his place ; but the Muez-us- Sultaneh, Governor of Mohammerah, who is not well disposed towards them, tried to support the deposed Governor; and the Prince Governor, who was un aware of the tribal feeling, re-appointed him. In the face, however, of the hostile attitude of the tribes, His Royal Highness cancelled the appointment ; and in January last, when he visited Mohammerah, confirmed Shaikh Jafir in the appointment. The crops between Ahwaz and Slmster, and on the Lower Karun, were good, but the export of grain was prohibited. There were several outbreaks of epidemic disease: cholera, small-pox, and remittent fever prevailed at Mohammerah and on the Upper Karun between June and October 1893, and considerable mortality attended them. Quarantine was maintained at Mohammerah against arrivals from Busrah and other places in Turkish territory during the months of June and July 1S93. Early in 1892 the Turkish authorities at Busrah had proposed to estab lish a quarantine station at Eao, to prevent the evasion by travellers for Busrah of quarantine fees by landing at Mohammerah and proceeding by land or river. The proposal was opposed by the British and Russian Delegates on the Board of Health at Constantinople, and the question was finally suspended until the assembling of the Commission for the revision of the Sanitary tariff. Since October 1893 the Turkish Customs authorities at Eao have con stantly stopped native craft bound for, or sailing from, Mohammerah, claiming duty on their cargoes at the same rate to which goods imported into, or exported from, Turkey are liable. Among the victims of these exactions, which are contrary to the second article of the Treaty of Erzeroum of 1847, were two British Indian boats which were bound for Mohammerah, and which paid the duty under protest. The whole question has been made the subject of re ference, but the Turkish authorities still refuse to recognise the anchorage off Mohammerah as under Persian jurisdiction. The question does not appear to have received at Tehran the attention that might have been expected, possibly because the Turkish Customs authorities at Eao have not, apparently, enforced their demands in a regular or systematic manner upon all boats, but upon such only as have submitted to their exactions. In May 1893 the Naseri Company publicly announced that they had opened the river Diz to traffic and had placed their steamer 8uza on it. The Suzat however, made only one trip to Kut Bunder, a place about ten hours' distance from Dizful by caravan. On the return voyage the vessel was nearly wrecked, and had to leave behind a barge which she had taken in tow.10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL In July 1893 there was a fanatical demonstration against Messrs. Lynch's house at Shuster. The day of this occurrence was the 10th day of Mohurrum, and the consequence might have been serious, as about 3,000 people sur rounded the house, threatening the lives of the inmates. The Prince Governor being informed took prompt measures by the despatch of an armed force which quickly dispersed the mob, and a catastrophe was thus averted. Some sort of complaint appears to have been made by those responsible for this riot, but it can only be regarded as an attempt to avert blame by anti cipating it with an accusation. An enquiry, conducted by the Vice-Consul of Mohammerah, ascertained the true facts, and a written disclaimer of any cause of complaint against Messrs. Lynch's Agent was given by the Deputy Gov- ernor of Shuster. In November 1893 cattle-disease of a mild type prevailed on the Karun from Mobammerah to Ameirah ; it travelled to Palahieh and the islands of Abadan and Khezr, and to the Turkish side of the Shatt-ul-Arab. In December 1893, a gale, accompanied by heavy rain, passed over the dis- trict about Ahwaz, where the river rapidly rose 20 feet, overflowing and flood ing much of the country. The telegraph poles were blown down in several places, and the line interrupted for a week. The river subsided about the early part of January last. The question of accommodation for Messrs. Lynch at Ahwaz, which had been long pending, was decided, and an agreement was drawn up in February between the representatives of theNizam-es-Sultaneh and Messrs. Lynch, and was forwarded to Tehran for ratification. In March last the Resident, accom panied by the Extra Assistant, proceeded on tour up the Karun as far as Shuster, and at Ahwaz saw the ground marked for the buildings. The traffic on the Karun is slowly increasing; and though steamers seem to have done slightly better than in the previous year, they still work at a loss; and until the land communications in the interior above Shuster are improved, and more carrying capacity is provided on the upper river, the volume of the trade can hardly be materially increased. 8.—FAES AND PERSIAN COAST. The Mzam-us-Sultaneh was Governor-General of Ears throughout the year; his brother, Saad-ul-Mulk, was Governor of Bushire and the Gulf ports, but spent but a small part of his time within his jurisdiction, only returning to Bushire in January after a long absence at Shiraz. The year closed with the re-appointment of His Royal Highness the Rukn-ud-Dowlah as Governor-General of Ears, and of the Kawam-ul-Mulk as Governor of Bushire and the Gulf ports. The arrival of the latter, however, being delayed, Haji Mirza Abdulla Khan was appointed as Deputy Governor, and reached Bushire to take up his duties after a short delay. An embargo on the export of wheat was published in May, and continued nominally in force till the following January, when it was removed. This measure, which is of periodical recurrence, though injuriously affecting the regular operations of the more important merchants, who are Europeans, is very generally recognized as being practically ineffectual. Any real restraint on export from the rich corn-producing sea^board tracts from Bushire towards the mouth of the Euphrates would be most difficult ; and even if seriously intended or attempted, would be hardly practicable, in view of the fact that scarcely any other means than by sea are available for disposing of the pro duce. A thinly veiled and ^Mem -surreptitious export is understood to be car ried on at Bushire itself during these embargoes. (RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1893-94 11 In July a scheme for the taxation of foreigners engaged in retail trades and industries was announced by the Persian Goyernment, and has since come into force. The districts near Bushire were again subject to some trouble and disorder. Khan Ali Khan of Bunder Eig having farmed Angali and other villages in Dashtistan was resisted by the inhabitants, and Angali holding out after the submission of the others, was attacked with the support of a gun from Bushire. In Tangistan there was a still more serious conflict, and Hyder Khan, though assisted by a detachment of Persian soldiers and a gun, failed against the Tangseri tribe who, armed with Martini-Henry rifles, compelled the soldiers to retreat under their steady fire. Cholera prevailed in various parts and seriously threatened Bushire. It appeared at Busrah in May and later at Mohammerah, and spread on the Arab coast as well as on the Persian side of the Gulf and its islands^ Prom ^ the coast it advanced to the places on the route leading from Bushire to Shiraz, and thus Bushire became liable to invasion by the disease both by land and water, its communications by both being very active. Quarantine was established against Busrah in June, and subsequently against arrivals from any infected port, and, though the measures adopted were framed with the utmost consideration for the interests of trade, was eminently successful. , In consequence of the spread of the epidemic to the neighbouring dis tricts, quarantine was imposed on arrivals by land in September. Special pre cautions were also taken to secure the purity of the water-supply, t e condi tions of which—drinkable water being obtainable only from a limited number of wells at a distance from the town—lent themselves to these efforts. The re sults were remarkably successful, only one case of the disease occurring m the town and a few on board ships or at the quarantine stations and this not- withstanding that a very severe type of the disease prevailed at Ahmedi, on y 20 miles distant, and at other places along the Shiraz route. It is noteworthy that the entire responsibility of devising and controlling the measures to protect perhaps the most important port of Persia against a lerrible danger, was resigned to a foreign element for it was solely with Surgeon-Captain Lnmsden, Residency Surgeon, and his subordinate, that this burden, in a professional sense, rested, no other medical aid being provided The Pe sian authorities readily accepted the suggestions made, and supported the measures declared to be necessary, and the Residency Surgeon s report has recorded that they 'have given every assistance m carrying out the quaran- iue work effectively and withont friction.' The highest praise was also given to Haji Ali Dubash, one of the Port officials, for the excellent work done by him in carrying out quarantine regulations. , His Excellency Rear-Admiral W. R. Kennedy visited Buslure ™ route to Busrah and Baghdad in March, and was received with salutes on ainval by H IMS VeJpolis, and, on landing, by a battery onshore. His Excel lency was visited by the Saad-ul-Mulk, whose visit was returned. _ Affairs in Sbiraz and the neighbouring districts continued in a very disturbed state. It appeared that at the beginning of the year order had SStl'S I, the newly .pp.i.ledBegta-Begi Messed popular excitement broke out again in an acute form in the12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL high against the Kawam-iil-Mulk; and the people, not satisfied with the as surances they received of his departure, assumed a threatening attitude Matters quieted a few days later on the departure of the Kawam-nl-Mulk • but continued high prices soon again caused a ferment, and threats were posted up that the Telegraph Office would be again beseiged. Some fear of a riot was again revived in November. Locusts made their first appearance in spring and were followed by larger flights; the injury they did to the crops about Shiraz is said to have been very extensive ; the wheat indeed was reported to have been almost destroyed Young locusts again appeared in November, and very great damage was done to the crops during the early spring of this year. Much trouble was caused by the turbulence of the Baharloos, who were noted in last year's report as having gone into open revolt, and by other Arab and nomad tribes. The appointment of the Seham-ul-Mulk to the position with these tribes formerly occupied by the Kawam-ul-Mulk, was very unwel come to them ; but he appears to have dealt with these unruly spirits with a strong hand. He conducted an expedition which surprised the camp of Eeza Khan by night, killing several of his followers and capturing others; Reza Khan himself, who escaped wounded, died the next day. Two robberies of the Persian post were reported. Very great damage was caused by heavy rain and floods in Shiraz and districts. In the middle of December the rain is described as heavier than iiny remembered in recent years; the houses in Shiraz were much injured and the district of Abadeh to the north suffered terribly. In the Easa district south-east, the effect of the floods was still more severe, some villages bein^ almost annihilated. Towards the end of February, Shiraz and the neighbom- hood were visited by an earthquake which caused some injury to life and pro- perty. This was followed by a deluge of rain, which destroyed a very lar-e number of houses in the city. 3 At Lai in May a colporteur of the British and Foreign Bible Society was maltreated, and all his books were burned by order of the Mujtabid against whom the Governor declared himself powerless to obtain redress for the victim. The case of a British Indian subject who was robbed of some 26,000 aus worth of property, chiefly pearls, at Naband, was noticed in last year's report. Pearls to the value of about 3,388 Krans were recovered, and after much needless delay and complication, were handed over to the owner named Maghu. The result of the dilatory proceedings taken by the authorities is that up to the present, notwithstanding the orders of the Government, the efforts to obtain more complete indemniflcation for the unfortunate man have been iruitless. A Pathan caravan, some of the leaders being British subjects, was at- tacked by the Baharloos and robbed, and four men killed. This occurred before the beginning of the year; but up to the present about half of the camels only have been recovered, no further compensation for the loss of life and pro perty having yet been obtained. a severe tyP e a pp6ared near Bassidore in November, and caused a ou n ty eaths. Heavy rain at the close of the year did much injury to houses and date groves. Failure attended the boring operation for petroleum of the Mining . s orpM'&amp;tion, a depth of over 700 feet being reached without a trace of oil being found. (RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE YEAR 1893-94. 13 Survey operations in view to connecting the Telegraph at Jask with Bunder Abbas were undertaken in pursuance of the desire of the Persian authorities for telegraphic communication with Bunder Abbas; the Surveyor, however, encountered some obstruction in the Bashakird country, and it is believed that the work has not been completed. A charge of most oppressive and unwarrantable treatment in the case of a boat from Ras-el-Khymah, on the Arab coast, was made against the then Deputy Governor of Bunder Abbas just before the beginning of the year. Another outrage on a boat from Eias -el-Khymah was complained of as having been committed at Khargu, where a young slave lad was violently carried off. These cases were alluded to in last year's report, but redress has not yet been given. Cases of this kind are very likely to lead to reprisals on the part of the Arabs, and the delay and difficulty in getting justice is therefore much to be regretted. Other outrages were the plunder or capture of Bahrain boats off Bisatin in April by the Bani i-Malik tribe, and off Bistano in September by the followers of the Chief of Assalu, both occurring within the jurisdiction of the Governor of Lar. In both these cases, as also in the case of piracy at Bunder Tibbin mentioned in last year's report, no result has yet attended the application for redress. In April the huglah of a British Indian subject, which was wrecked near Minabj was plundered by the local Baluchis; the Persian authorities at Bushire professed to have recovered a portion of the plundered wreckage and paid compensation for the rest, but it is feared that this has not been done. The difficulties connected with the Customs question at Bunder Abbas, in relation to Kerman and other places in the interior, were revived, and there have been constant complaints of demands being repeated on the transit of goods to inland jurisdiction, notwithstanding the payment of the full treaty rate of duty at the port of entry. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN. Bampur continued under the Governorship of Sirteep Zain-ul-Abadin Khan during the year. Sirdar Muhammad Ali Khan, who had for many years been Governor of Bahu and Gwetter, was removed from his post and replaced by Mowladad Khan; but not long afterwards he intimated to the Native Assistant at Gwadur that the Persian Governor of Kerman had reinstated him. The difficulties arising out of the mutual complaints of raids and violence on both sides of the Perso-Baluch frontier were dealt with in the course of the tour in Mekran by the Political Agent, South Eastern Baluchistan, who obtained from the Rinds an undertaking to refrain from all raids over the border pending an enquiry into, and settlement of, the matter at issue between them and their neighbours. The Persian Government was asked to restrain its subjects from aggression in pursuance of the arrangement that had been arrived at. Shaikh Hassan, Zabit of Minab, took a large force aided by Mir Abdul Nabi, Chief of Jask, against the small Tahirzai tribe inhabiting Khotak in the Biyaban district, which had become very lawless. The tribe was attacked at Surag on 31st August, with trifling loss on both sides, and subsequently secured immunity, and permission to reside at Khotak, on payment of 400 tomans. Later they emigrated to Bashagird. In September an affray occurred at Jask between the fishermen of the place and the Persian troops; and the former being joined by the other inhabitants, beleaguered the fort in which the soldiers took refuge. Eurther violence was averted by the intervention of the Assistant Superintendent of11 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the Telegraph, who induced the fishermen to retire by promising to report the state of affairs; and on his representation, the desirability in the interests of peace, of the removal of the Deputy Governor Ghulam Reza Beg, having been brought to the notice of the authorities at Bushire by the Resident, that official was replaced by a Military Yavar. A most unwarrantable interference by the local Persian authorities of Dizak and Bampur in the affairs of certain British Indian subjects had a de. plorable result. A Guru, who is also a trader, having claimed a Hindu girl i n marriage, seems to have appealed for aid in securing her, to the Persian autho rities, and Sardar Muhammad Khauof Dizak thereupon caused the girl and her family to be seized and carried to Sib, where the former was made over to the Guru. The unhappy girl died the same night, and the circumstances have a very grave aspect. Sirteep Zain-ul-Abadin of Bampur would seem not to be free from suspicion of concern in the proceedings in this case. Enquiries have been made as far as possible; Lieutenant Sykes, who was travellino-i n those parts, investigated the matter, and the Guru was summoned to Karachi for examination. The accounts furnished by the Persian authorities have been recklessly contradictory, and it has not been possible to clear up the facts attending the girl's death, which has been attributed to poison given by the girl's mother, to hardships in the course of the forcible abduction to Sib, and to natural causes. There seems little prospect of sufficiently trustworthy evidence being obtained for formal proceedings against the Guru. No result has been reached in the case of the abduction of the mother and sister of a Telegraph line-man at Jask, notwithstanding the orders noted in last year's report as having been issued by the Persian Government. The difficulty of finding Dadullah, who was guilty of the abduction, has constantly been put forward to account for the failure in this case. The women have not been restored. A destructive fire in April 1893 rendered a thousand persons homeless at Gwadur. The loss of property, chiefly belonging to Arab subjects, was esti- mated at Rs. 78,000. The position with regard to the escaped slaves who have sought refuge at Gwadur, has continued to be a source of anxiety to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and his Wall at Gwadur. The demands of the Rinds for the resto ration of these refugees have constantly been renewed, and have at times been threatening; but the force at the disposal of the 'Wali having been strength ened, he has been enabled to resist the demands made upon him, without a resort to violence. At the visit of the Political Agent for South Eastern Baluchistan, the Rinds were required to desist from their violentfclaims for the surrender of their slaves, who, as a matter of expediency, and in order to remove all cause of irritation, have been, as far as possible, conveyed to India. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. There were no captures of slave dhows by Her Majesty's Ships during the year under report. There were a few cases in which slaves appealed to the Residency for freedom. Where it was found that importation into Persia had been recent, manumission was granted, and if the freed slaves desired it, and it was possible, they were conveyed to their former homes. 11.—ROYAL NAVY VESSELS.

WILSON, Colonel, Political Eeddeni, Persian Gulf.P art II.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY AND CONSULATE EOR THE YEAR 1893-94. There is but little change to record in the Political history of Oman since p olifcicaL year's report was written; no events of political importance occurred during the year under review, and the collisions between the tribes were local and did not affect the general peace of the country. The policy of the Sultan towards the tribes is not marked by that energy and firmness which they would wish to see their ruler exercise towards the settlement of the feuds and quarrels which so frequently break out between them. Interference in their internal affairs they are very ready to resent, but they have been accustomed to look to the central authority for a decision in the matter of their differences with their neighbours, and in this respect the action of the Sultan is often neither timely nor sufficiently assertive. On the other hand, the Sultan's hold over the tribes is but slight, and aggressive or coercive measures might lead to inconvenient reprisals. Oman has enjoyed a period of tranquillity for the last five years which is perhaps without a parallel in the annals of its history, and to this Sayjid Eeysal's mild and little-felt rule has, in a measure, contributed. But other causes have been at work—those who have it in their power to cause mischief are either absent or disinclined to move; no new leader has risen, round whom political intrigues could focus, and the Shaikhs remember that in their attempts against Muscat in the reign of Sayyid Toorkee, the Sultan received assistance from the British Government. Inter-tribal raids and feuds between the rival Hinawi and Ghafri factions were rife as usual, but they did not lead to any general rising or coalition of the tribes. Early in April a party of 80 of the Beni Hina under the leadership of Badr, a son of the Tameemah, Hilal-bin-Zahir, raided on the Yal Khamis, who reside at Hail under the protection of the Beni Umar and Beni Kelban; they killed seven of the Yal Khamis and made off with a quantity of camels and goats and some household property, losing four of their number in the encounter. On their return they were pursued by 700 of the Beni Umr and Beni Kelban; 20 of the Beni Hina were killed in the affray that ensued on their refusal to give up the plundered property, and the rest, with the exception of their leader, who managed to make good his escape, were made prisoners. At the request of the Tameemah, Hilal-bin-Zahir, Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais sent his nephew, Sayyid Saood-bin-Azzan, to open negotiations for the redemption of the captives. Later on in the month the Beni Hina were attacked at Ghafat by the Beni Shekeyl, who set fire to the place. Amongst other casualties, Ghusn, the eldest son of the Tameemah of the Beni Hina, with two of his companions, was killed, and Muhammad-bin-Ali, one of the principal Shaikhs of the Beni Shekeyl, was carried wounded off the field. This quarrel owed its origin to the Beni Hina persisting in erecting a fort on a plot of land they had bought from the Beni Shekeyl. Hostilities again broke out between the tribes later on in the year; in September Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali induced them to come to peace, after the Beni Hina had been credited with the murder of a former Kadhi of Muscat and his wife in retaliation for the death of the son of their Tameemah, the Kadhi having taken an active part in supporting the Beni Shekeyl against the Beni Hina. Shaikh Hilal-bin-Zahir subsequently c 220 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL showing signs of desire to break the peace, a caution from Shaikh Saleh-bin- Ali produced the required result. Hostilities between the Yal Saad of the Batineh and the Ahl Dhaliireh were renewed early in the year. On this occasion the Yal Saad were the first to assume the offensive. They attacked Mubrah with a force said to consist of 4,000 men; further reinforcements were expected, but they did not wait for their arrival. The attack was repulsed, the Yal Saad losing 117 in killed and wounded, the defenders, 7 Shaikhs and 42 men. An attempt at mediation made by the Sultan produced no result. After several minor raids on both sides the Yal Saad prepared in November for a fresh advance on Mubrah. Sayyid Ibra- him-bin-Kais then interfered and at once brought about a cessation of hos tilities. A month later the leading Shaikhs on both sides met before Sayyid Ibrahim-bin-Kais and settled the terms of peace. An old feud between the Beni Mukeem and the Sulooh of Tewee was renewed in May, the Beni Mukeem being the aggressors. They made an expedition against Tewee and set fire to a large house in which powder was stored; 14 of the Sulooh were killed by the explosion and the fire of the attack which lost three men. An ineffectual attempt was made by the Sultan 's younger brother, Sayyid Fabad, to bring about a reconciliation. Subsequently Shaikh Saleh put a stop to further hostilities. In June collisions occurred between the Beni Umar and the Hawasineh of Khaboorah, in consequence of the murder by the Beni XJmar of the Shaikh of the Beni Saeed, a tribe being under the protection of Hawasineh. In the same month the Sultan sent a force under Sayyid Badr-bin-Seif to take possession of Mansoor and oust the garrison of the Beni Harras from the fort: the expedition was ill-planned; and a war-cry being raised, the Sultan's party had to beat a ^ precipitate retreat. His Highness had taken up his quarters at the time in the fort of Nakhl awaiting the arrival of Shaikhs Suleiman-bin-Seif of the Beni Jabir and Khalfan-bin-Humayyan of Nakhl, whom he had summoned to his presence; but hearing that these two Shaikhs were preparing to obey his summons with a force of between 400 and 500 men he left Nakhl suddenly and returned to Birkah. The Beni Jabir then proceeded to cut down some date trees belonging to two of His Highness's officials in the vicinity of Nakhl. In September Hameyd-bin-Salim, commonly known as Kurta, a well- known marauder, commenced raiding in the Sharkey eh ; in consequence o£ rumours that he intended proceeding against Kurryat, the Sultan increased his garrison m that town. Apparently Kurta found enough to occupy his atten tion in the Sharkeyeh for some time, for it was not till the end of February that he began to move towards Kurryat. His Highness sent orders to the tribes holding the passes leading to the coast to block his way, and at the same time sent a further reinforcement to Kurryat. Finding his advance checked at the passes, Kurta opened negotiations with the tribes to Jet him through; failing in this, he returned to his country and sent a humble letter to His High ness, begging for forgiveness. The Beni-Bu-Ali carried on a desultory war with their hereditary foes, the Beni-Bu-Hasan, for some months : no general engagement took place, and the casualties on both sides were few. A truce was effected between them by Shaikh Saleh-bin-Ali. Collision also occurred between the Yal Wahibah and the Jenebah. In February 1894 peace was made between the Harlh and the Ahl Bashar through the instrumentality of Shaikh Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, the Sultan's Wali in Wadi Semmayil. This official was deputed, at the same time, to settle theRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY PGR THE YEAR 1893-94 21 differences between the Ghafri tribes of the Semmayil Valley and the Ahl Boshar; but when the Ghafri Shaikhs came to Muscat to receive the indemnity which had been agreed upon, the Sultan declined to pay the full amount. The Shaikhs refused to accept a reduction, and left Muscat feeling much aggrieved. This refusal of the Sultan to abide by the terms of the decision which it was understood he had authorised his Wali to make, led to further trouble and loss of life after the close of the year under report. A peace was concluded between the Harth and the Beni Jabir. In October His Highness the Sultan was informed that His Highness Sayyid Abdul Aziz had definitely refused to accept a pension from the Sultan on the condition that he should quietly reside in India. The attitude assumed by the Binds of Mekran in the matter of their claims for the restitution of their slaves who had taken refuge at Gwadur, was a standing menace to that out-lying portion of the Sultan's dominions for some months during the year. Several hundreds of these fugitive slaves had col lected in Gwadur, the first arrivals coming in early in the preceding cold weather. In May intimation was received of a threatened attitude on that town in consequence of the refusal of the Wali to return the slaves to their former masters, which the Sultan was bound not to do by the terms of the Treaty of 1873. This threat was repeated at intervals, but was not carried into execution. The garrison at Gwadur was reinforced, and correspondence took place between the Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, and the Government of India. It was evi dent that the Sultan was not expected to provide a permanent refuge for these fugitive slaves in Gwadur, and that they could not be allowed to take up their residence there in such close proximity to their former masters. They were accordingly advised to leave for Karachi and other British Indian ports, which they did, some of them receiving assistance to enable them to reach their port of destination. One case of breach of the maritime peace of the Gulf occurred, in which the Sultan was advised to inflict a fine of Rs. 50 on Mehdi-bin-Ali, the Shaikh of the Kamazarah tribe of Khassab, for proceeding with a party of armed men by sea to Shaam with the object of prosecuting a certain claim his wife had against the estate of her deceased father. After some months' delay, the attendance of the Shaikh was enforced at Muscat and the fine was recovered. The Telegraph station at Gwadur was closed in September, the Post Office was maintained, and a telephonic circuit Genera1, was established connecting Gwadur with the telegraph line at Ormara and Charbar for the use of the Native Assistant. A fire broke out in Gwadur in April, which caused considerable damage to house and other property. The loss suffered by British subjects was esti mated at Bs. 3,000. Nothing further has been heard of the seven Africans to whose case allusion was made in last year's report. The slavetrade - reputed owners of the party, who have property both in Melindi on the East Coast of Africa and in Oman, were sent for when they arrived in Oman, and were interrogated; they stated that the Africans were not their slaves and denied all knowledge of them. It is understood that further enquiries are in progress by the officials of the Imperial East Africa Company to test the truth of the above statements. A bold case of kidnapping occurred in Eebruary 1894), by which one Muftab, an ^ Mean freeman, who had taken passage in a buglah at Lingah on his way from Busrah to Zanzibar, was landed by the nakhoda of the22 administration report on the persian gulf, etc., 1893-94. huglah on the Batineh coast and sold into slavery. Information of the fact was given by the friends of the African on their arrival at Muscat; on a representation being made to the Sultan by this Agency, steps were taken which resulted in the release of the kidnapped man and his restoration to his friends. It is satisfactory to add that the nakhoda's craft was confiscated and that he is at present undergoing a term of imprisonment in one of th Muscat forts.

J. HATES SADLER, H. B. M.P aet III.—EEPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OE THE CON SULAR DISTRICT OF BUSHIRE EOR THE YEAR 1893. General remar'ks, —The general depression from which trade in Southern Persia suffered so severely during 1892 a proved destined unfortunately, despite confident anticipations to the contrary, to be prolonged and even intensified during the past year. Yet it cannot be said that the year 1893 opened under unfavourable auspices : the wheat harvest of the Persian Gulf littoral was most abundant, and the activity which was observed in certain important branches of commerce towards the end of 1892 gave reason for hope that a general revival of trade was about to be inaugurated. Before many months had elapsed, however, it became evident that this hope was not destined to be realised. Exchange, which, it was hoped, had in 1892 reached its lowest limit, pursued its downward course throughout the year, and with its close the Kran had decreased in value by 15 per cent. Early in the year, more over, reports were received of the appearance in the districts about Shiraz of swarms of locusts, which had begun to create havoc among the crops; and in June there was added to these misfortunes an outbreak of cholera with its attendant dislocation of all commercial transactions. Under these adverse conditions, it is not a matter for surprise that trade should have suffered severely. The cotton crop, which at the commencement of the year gave promise of an excellent yield, was in part destroyed by the locusts. Nor were their ravages confined to cotton only, but were extended impartially to cultivation in general. Opium, as is well known, has now be come one of Persia's most important exports; and the great injury inflicted on the crop of 1893, by the same agency as that which so adversely affected the cotton yield, was a severe blow to Persian commerce. The wheat crops of the Persian Gulf littoral were so fortunate as to escape the general de struction ; but in the grain-growing districts of Ears, the harvests gave lamen table results. The price of grain at once rose, and the difficulties of the situation were aggravated, it is said, by operations aimed at the realisation of a profit by buying up and storing grain in anticipation of a further rise of price. How far these operations were attended with success is not known, but prices undoubtedly rose and the evils of widespread scarcity ensued. In May the threatening attitude of the people, more especially in Shiraz, where it was feared they would be driven to acts of violence by their un fortunate condition, led to the imposition of an embargo on the exportation of wheat from Bushire—a measure the advantage or efficacy of which is open to great doubt. Operations in tobacco, moreover, which was formerly exported in considerable quantities to Turkey, have, during 1893, been greatly restricted owing to the monopoly enjoyed by the Turkish Regie or Societe du Tombac, to which now belongs the exclusive right of importing foreign tobacco into Turkey. Persian tobacco can therefore be only imported in to Turkey through the agents of the Societe, and this trade, which at one time was exceedingly lucrative, has greatly declined. An effort has been made to counteract this loss by a combination under strong religious sup port, for the purpose of restricting and controlling the production; the prospects of success in this attempt can hardly yet be gauged. It might naturally be supposed that the decline in the value of the Kran, and the distress prevailing in parts of Southern Persia could not fail to have a serious effect on the import trade. Such has not been the case, however, to the extent that might reasonably have been anticipated, and while the import trade of 1893 cannot be described as entirely satisfactory, the24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL imports under certain heads shew a marked increase in volume when compared with those of 1892. One of the chief difficulties with which trade has to contend in Southern Persia, and indeed throughout the country, is the unsatisfactory state of the routes, for it would be impossible to call them roads. There can be no doubt of the vast gain which, in the interests of the development of trade generally, and the consequent diffussion of prosperity throughout the country, would result from an improvement of the means of communication ; but the responsibility in this connection is one which, in practice certainly, if not in theory, appears to be entirely ignored, and such efforts as have been made to remedy the evil, liave been due to the enterprise of European Companies. An instance of this is to be found in the Eoad Company which has laid down a carriage road be. tween Tehran and Koom, and placed a service of vehicles upon it. The scheme contemplated an extension to Ispahan and Shuster, but without more encourage ment, and better prospects for the security of the profits in the undertaking than the present condition of things affords, the extension seems doubtful. An important event of the year was the withdrawal from Persia of the Agencies of the Ottoman Bank, and banking operations in this country are now practically a monopoly in the hands of the Imperial Bank of Persia. It would be vain to deny that the commercial outlook generally is at present far from encouraging. The decline in the value of silver, which appears still unarrested in curtailing the purchasing power of the country, must injuriously affect the import trade, and the result is perhaps aggravated; certainly an evil is added to it by the encouragement on the part of certain of the priesthood of a belief among the people that the inevitable rise in prices is due only to an arbitrary enhancement imposed by British traders. IMPORTS. Indigo. —Trade in this article continues to increase. Consequent on the rebellion of the Baharloo tribes in 1892, the trade routes between Bunder Abbas, Yezd, and Kerman were regarded as unsafe during the greater part of 1893, and a considerable portion of the indigo ordinarily imported through Bunder Abbas was diverted from its usual channel and sent through Bushire. Glass and China-ware. —Trade in these wares was dull. Arms and Ammunition. —Notwithstanding the prohibition against the im portation of arms, which still remains in force, considerable quantities were, it is stated, imported during the year into Bushire, whence they were de- spatched to Persian Arabistan, where a good market is found, or re-shipped with the Arab coast of the Persian Gulf as their destination. Gold lace and gold thread. —There was little demand for this article, and only a small quantity was imported. Cotton The year opened auspiciously in this branch of trade, and for some months there was a strong demand for cotton goods, fair prices being realised. As the year advanced, however, the gradual but persistent fall in the exchange value of the Kran began to make itself felt, and adversely affected the market. The appearance of cholera, the destruction by locusts of the crops in many of the grain-growing districts, and the widespread distress that ensued, caused a still further depression of trade. These adverse conditions produced the most disastrous effects in this branch of trade, and the imports for 1893 show a decrease in value of no less than £90,000 on those of the previous year. Candles. —Candles have been imported in large quantities during the year, and good prices have been realised.residency and mttscat political agency for the year 1893-94. 25 Sugar. —Marseilles sugar was imported in large quantities during the year, although it was reported that there was a brisk trade in Russian sugar from the north. The heavy cost of transport between the Gulf ports and the north of Persia constitutes the chief bar to a really successful development of the trade in Marseilles sugar, and it seems probable that the present revival in the Russian sugar trade is but the first step towards a resumption by the latter of its old ascendancy in the northern markets. The imports of Mauritius sugar show a considerable increase on those of the previous year. 2^. It is gratifying to be able to record that, notwithstanding the difficulties with which trade in general has had to contend during 1893, the imports of tea show a marked increase on those of previous years. The tea which is import ed into Persia from the south comes almost exclusively from India and Java, and there can be no doubt that it finds favour in the Persian markets. Judging by the figures of the last few years, it would certainly seem as if this trade was capable of considerable expansion. Metals.— There has been a marked renval of activity in the trade in copper, and imports have been largely in excess of those for 1892. On the other hand, there has been a great decrease in the demand for iron. Woollen goods, —Trade in woollen goods appears to have been exceedingly brisk during 1893, and imports were heavy. Lamps and lamp-ware.—There has been an increased demand for lamps and lampware during the year. Exports. Cereal—There was an abundant grain harvest in the Bushire districts in 1893, and no inconsiderable portion of the yield, which was largely in excess of local'requirements, was, notwithstanding the high cost of transport, attracted to the interior, where, in many localities, owing to the destruction of the crops by locusts,' the price of grain was very high. In consequence of the general distress prevailing in Shiraz and the surrounding districts, owing to the high price of grain, an embargo on the exportation of wheat was imposed by the Go vernment in May, and was still in force at the close of the year. The export of cereals previous to the adoption of this measure had been, however, msigm- flcant owing to the unremunerative rates ruling in the European markets, which, moreover, remained unfavourable for transactions in wheat throughout the year. Tobacco. The chief market for Persian tobacco is to be found in Turkey, but exports to that country during 1893 were much restricted owing to the mono- poly enioyed by the Turkish Company &lt;c La Societe du Tombac', which had, m 1891, succeeded in obtaining a concession from the Porte of the exclusive right of importing foreign tobacco into Turkey for a period of 25 years dating from April 1892 Persian tobacco can therefore only be imported into lurkey through its agents, and many Persian merchants, who were formerly m the habit of exporting largely to Turkey, have been obliged to suspend operations The partial destruction of the opium crops by locusts was a heavy blow to Persian commerce. The yield for the year was very poor and the value of the total export shows a decrease of £132,000 when compared with the ex- port of 1892. &gt; l f Almond Semens—European crops were again large, and exports from Persia to Europe were accordingly inconsiderable. Heavy shipments were, it is stated, made to Bombay by Native merchants with satisfactory results. Shells. —Owing to the heavy exports of the inferior description of shells during recent years, the English markets have been overstocked, and prices ruledi?6 administration report on the persian gulf political very low. A fresh outlet has, however, been found for this branch of trade Since the introduction of the Mackinley Tariff, an important industry in button- making has sprung up in the United States, and large quantities of Persian shells have found their way there. Gum.—HlhQ yield of 1893 was excellent, but the high prices ruling locally left but a small margin of profit to the exporter. Wool. —The wool export of 1893 was not large, and was of inferior quality. Carpets. —There has been a striking development of the carpet industry during the year, and exports have been extensive. Shipments were made chiefly to Europe and Egypt, where good prices were invariably obtained. Cotton. —The swarms of locusts that appeared and ravaged the cotton-fields soon dispelled any hopes that might have been indulged in, early in the year, of a really plentiful crop. The yield was, however, larger than might have been expected under the circumstances, and exports were heavier than in 1892. It is reported that Ispahan cotton has commenced to find a good market in Russia, and the cotton trade with Russia, it is believed, might be made to assume con. siderable proportions. Miscellaneous. Exchange. —There was a steady rise in the rate of exchange throughout the year, the value of the £ sterling varying from Krans 40 at the commencement of the year to Krans 47 at its close. Freights, —'During 1893 3 freights ruled very low; they varied from 17/6 to 25/ per ton. The unfavourable prices ruling in the European grain-markets at the com mencement of the year, and the subsequent embargo on the export of wheat from Persia, caused a sensible diminution in the demand for tonnage, and the number of steamers entering the port of Bushire during the year shows a de. crease of 11 when compared with the figures for 1892. JPetroleum. —The winding up of the business of the Imperial Bank Mining Bights Corporation was announced early in the year, resulting from the want of success attending their boring operations at Daliki and on the island of Kishm. Mule hire. —The rate at the commencement of the year was 80 Krans per 100 Tabriz maunds from Bushire to Shiraz. In March it fell to 37J Krans for the same distance, and with some fluctuations rose to 56 Krans, at which figure it stood at the close of the year. EBED. A.

P art I.— GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—OMAN-MASK AT COAST. The Report forming Part II of this compilation has been prepared hy Captain F. G-. Whyte. Its Interest centres in the serious rebellion against the Sultan's power, accompanied by a treacherous attempt on his life, which occurred towards the close of the year, and of which an account is given in the report. The previous ten months of the year were not marked by any events of importance; and tranquillity, greater perhaps than is the normal lot of Oman, but tempered nevertheless by some of the usual inter-tribal feuds and aggressions, generally prevailed. Serious rioting took place at Mattrah in June between the Seedees employed by the Khojah traders and Baluchis, There was a sharp conflict also between the Beni-Riyam and Beni-Hina at Nezwah, in which many were killed and wounded. In June a sad incident occurred in the death by suicide of Seyyid Eahad, younger brother of tbe Sultan. The motive for this unhappy act was ascribed to domestic and personal troubles. Uneasiness was caused during the last half of the year by Sheikh Saleh's movements and the rumours regarding his intentions; this influential Sheikh apparently acting quite independently of the Sultan's authority in arbitrating in inter-tribal quarrels and meeting out punishment. It was under his influence, as is supposed, that the tribes holding the passes into Oman proper closed them against all caravans about the beginning of November. The passes were shortly re-opened; but there were, about this time, disquieting rumours of Sheikh Saleh's designs against Maskat. These were abundantly justified by the event; for there can be little doubt that he had long contemplated the formid able attack which followed in Pebruary 1895. In this connection may be noted as significant, the return in May of Sheikhs Abdullah-bin-Saleh, Mohsin- bin-Amir, and Amir-bin-Salim, from Zanzibar, in the S. S. Avoca belonging to the Sultan of that place, with valuable gifts and marks of honour from His Highness. These three were actual leaders in the hostilities against Maskat; the first named being the son of Sheikh Saleh,6 ADMINISTBA.TIOK REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL The year was marked by the establishment of a Vice-Consulate for the French Republic at Maskat; Monsieur Paul Ottavi arriving on the 8th November to assume the office. Early in the year a high rise in the exchange value of Indian copper coin in relation to the dollar, leading to its extensive export, and the consequent scarcity and general inconvenience thereby caused, induced His Highness to import machinery and set up a mint. The institution suffered severely at tlie hands of the rebels, but will probably be restored. In the case of a Persian hagla which was wrecked off Mahout on the south-east coast, and the crew of which were set upon and robbed by the Bedouins, eight negroes of their number being reduced to slavery. His Highness took prompt and effective action, resulting in the recovery and release of most of the enslaved men. The trade returns for Maskat show a satisfactory result. Excluding the movements of specie, the total volume of trade is greater than for the preceding year, the increase being mainly in the imports. 2.—OMAN PIEATE COAST. In April the Resident visited this coast in H. M. S. Sphinx, An outbreak of dengue fever in the early part of the pearl season prevented many of the divers from going, as usual, to the pearl banks. This reduced the take of pearls, which was therefore rather below that of the year before. The Chiefs of Shargah and Eas-el-Khymah proposed to rebuild Hair, a town of the Jowasmis, the destruction of which was noticed in last year's report. The Shoohpohs, however, who had destroyed it, opposed the restoration. The Ras-el-Khymah Chief accordingly contemplated an attack on that tribe with the aid of Shargah, but the project remained in abeyance. A defensive alliance was entered into by the Sheikh of Um-el-Kawain with the Kutub tribe inhabiting the vicinity. By the mediation of Sultan-bin-Muhammad, Chief of the Naeem tribe,a reconciliation was effected between the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman, each side agreeing to forego his demands in respect of grievances against the other. An amicable settlement of the incident noticed in the last report, when a boat with the Ajman Chief on board was alleged to have been fired upon from Haireh, was included in the above arrangement of differences. Sheikh Bashid, the Chief of Debay, died on the 7th April, and his nephew. Sheikh Makhtoom-bin-Hashar, succeeded him in the Chiefship. The sons of Sheikh Rashid formed a conspiracy against the new Chief; but the latter seized and imprisoned them for five months. On their release, they took refuge with the Chief of Shargah, who has given them an asylum and a small compassionate allowance. In January the Manaseer and Al-Murrah tribes raided the inland dis- tricts between Abu-Dthabi and Ras-el-Khymah and carried off about 400 camels and 100 horses. The Chiefs of Abu-Dthabi and Debay accordingly made preparations to check them, and ordered th^ir subject Bedouins to move to the coast. The Chief of Abu-Dthabi has also moved troops to protect the Beni-Kutub tribe, who possess large herds and have applied to him for assistance. In November 1894 a Banian was robbed of cash and pearls to a con siderable amount at Dalmah, an island belonging to the Chief of Abu-Dthabi. The action of the Chief and his deputy at Dalmah were not satisfactory, and the Resident addressed a letter of remonstrance to the Chief, who answeredRESIDENCY AND MA.SKA.T POLITICAL AGENCY FOE, THE YEAR 1894-95. 7 in April that he was making enquiries but had not yet been able to discover the thieves. The enquiries are still proceeding. 3.—BAHREIN. Sheikh Esa, the Chief, suffered from a severe attack of small-pox, and was at one time dangerously ill, Hia recovery in June was hailed with marks of general rejoicing. Rumours of a projected attack on Bahrein by Nasir-bin-Mubarik, the restless and intriguing menace to its peace, were revived in October. Such an attack could only be possible with the assent and support of Jasim-bin- Muhammad Thani, to whom a warning was accordingly addressed. Two years ago an acute panic was reported as having been caused by the rumoured threatening move of these two Sheikhs. In March an unfortunate quarrel arose between the Ohief and the Al- bin-Ali, one of the tribes subordinate to him, owing to a somewhat violent act of the Chief's brother and an affray which took place afterwards. The tribe conceiving themselves aggrieved, removed in a body to the Katr coast opposite, where their leader. Sheikh Sultan-bin-Salamah, promptly entered into relations with Sheikh Jasim. The latter ostensibly made efforts to effect a reconciliation, and these failing—possibly their success never being really intended—the seceding tribe, with the countenance and support of Jasim, resolved on a settlement at Zobara, a place claimed as a hereditary possession by Sheikh Esa, but which, as a matter of policy, and in order to obviate the cUuiu of collisions on the mainland, he had been required to ' leave unoccupied. An alien settlement at Zobara would be a standing danger to Bahrein, leading to a constant repetition of the fears of attack such as those above referred to, and it was well known that it would on no account be permitted. It was evident, however, at the end of the year that there would be difficulty in arranging the matter. British Indian traders of Bahrein exporting dates from Katif to India have been subjected to great extortion during the last three years. Com plaints were made in 1893 that a5 ,615 had been exacted over the treaty rate of 1 per cent, and, after a very long delay, the explanation was given by the Turkish authorities at Baghdad, that their customs system required the deposit of 7 per cent, over the treaty rate—such excess to be refunded on the production of certificates by the Turkish Consul in India, of the due arrival of consignments there. Meantime shipments for 1893 had been made on ||| an excess payment of K9,719, and certificates in both these cases could not be produced, owing to the delay in intimating the necessity for such certificates. Excess duty to the extent of 114,174 was again exacted in 1894, and the certificates insisted upon being in this case produced, a fresh excuse for maintaining the extortion was found in a demand for the receipts for the amounts originally paid. As receipts had been consistently refused, a fact of course perfectly known to the Customs authorities, the device has up to the present enabled them to resist refund of exaction, which, added to those for the two previous years, bring the total to over E19,500. , lii 4.—NEJD. In March Muhammad-ibn-B/ashid having attacked and plundered the Ajman tribe near Sooloo, the headmen appealed to the Turkish Governor at El-Hasa, claiming protection as they paid taxes. The Governor ordered an expedition against Muhammad-ibn-Hashid; but the Commandant of the Ml8 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL forces refused to move without superior orders, and the Governor then wrote to Muhammad-ibn-Eashid; the latter replied that his action had been in the interests of law and order as the Ajman were robbers. A n interview, which Sheikh Jasim had requested, was declined by Muhammad-ibn-Eashid for fear of giving offence to the Turkish Government. 5,—EL-HASA AND OJAIR. In April Saeed Pasha, the Mutaserrif of El-Hasa resigned, and Ibrahim Pasha, formerly of Hodeida, was appointed in his place. 6.—EL-KATIP. A struggle was maintained almost throughout the year between the peo- pie and the authorities, in regard to the enhanced assessment of the date produce for export, caused by the fall in silver values, the injustice of the mode of assessment, and the exactions of the customs master. Two or three deputations proceeded to Basreh to appeal to the Wali in the matter, but though a commission was appointed to arrange the matter, the grievances remained unredressed. An appeal to the Supreme Government proving also unavailing, the mer. chants and others began to seek refuge at Bahrein, and in January 1895, the number of these refugees amounted to about 130, and a further exodus was reported in Pebruary. A demand for arrears of the duty for the two previous years, added to the general discontent, which was still further aggra vated by the high-handed exaction by the Turkish soldiery, of krans at the exchange rate of 5^ for the dollar. Pinally, in March 1895, the Governor of El-Hasa, while still refusing the concessions asked for, having, upon instructions from Basreh, promised a better arrangement for the ensuing year, and having also dismissed the tax collector, who bad made himself obnoxious to the people at Katif, those who had taken refuge at Bahrein were induced to return. 7.—EL-KATR. In April 1894 the Assistant Kaim-Makam of El-Bidaa and his wife were murdered by two Turkish soldiers, at the instigation, as was afterwards alleged, of the Commandant. The murderers escaped to Wakrah, but were afterwards arrested, and the Commander of the Mujde Eessan,' when off that coast, made an enquiry into the case and recorded the depositions of the soldiers for transmission to Government. Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani resigned the Kaim-Makamship of El-Bidaa in August and proposed to appoint his brother Ahmed to the post. Jasim appeared to be somewhat disturbed at the delay in removing the relieved Turkish garrison of El-Bidaa after the new reliefs of 200 men had been landed in December. A quarrel between the Al-Ajman and Beni-Hajir tribes in October led to a raid by the latter on some of the northern villages of the peninsula. Both tribes being dependents of Jasim, he exerted himself to effect a recon ciliation. At the close of the year a prospect of troubles appeared on the west coast of Katr, owing to the emigration there, in a body, of the Albin -Ali tribe, who held themselves aggrieved by the Chief of Bahrein. The move ment had the support of Sheikh Jasim.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 9 8.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. His Eoyal Highness the Hissam-es-Sulianeh was re-appointed to the Governor-Generalship before the close of the year 1893-94, and: held it through out the past year. In March 1895, the Nizam-es-Sultaneh was nominated for the ensuing year. Luristan was in a very unsettled state, much disorder prevailed, and the road from Dizful to Koremabad was unsafe for caravans. Operations were carried on against the Direkwend Lurs by His Eoyal Highness Hishmet-ud- Dowlah, who, in May, captured a large number of the tribe and deported them to Pusht-i-Kuh ; the Bakhtiaris assisted in these operations. The road, however, still remained unsafe, and caravans had to avoid it. The Bakhtiaris also were at feud with each other for a time, and robberies were committed on the road between Shuster and Dizful. The Chaab Arab tribes, who last year insisted on Sheikh Jafir Khan as their Governor, appear to have turned against him, and Sheikh Abdullah, who had been rejected by them, was re-appointed Governor, as the result of a movement in his favour. Difficulties, however, arose about the arrears of reve nue, and though a compromise was apparently effected, a combination was made against Sheikh Abdullah, and before the close of the year, his rival was re-appointed to the Governorship. There was trouble also at Howeizah, where the inhabitants rose in resent ment against the Military Commander. Again, in December, two sections of the Beni-Truf tribe were in hostile array, the one against the other, and the Prince Governor was obliged to proceed there, the matter not being settled till the fort held by one of the parties had been destroyed, with the help of the Government troops. Mutual aggressions were committed by the Arab tribes on the opposite side of the Perso-Turkish frontier near Howeizeh. The Arabs from the Persian side raided the districts over the border, in retaliation for alleged previous ao-oressions, and it is said that complaint having been made to the Turkish authorities by their subjects, they advised their subjects again to retaliate. At any rate a raid was afterwards made from the Turkish side on the village of Buwarim. Complaints were made to Tehran by the Turks in connection with these matters and an official was deputed by the Governor-General to enquire into them. Sheikh Mizal, however, declared that the offenders on the Persian side were Turkish tribes residing over the border. A want of firm control exhibited itself at Bunder Nassery (Ahwaz), and relations between the Persian soldiery and Arab inhabitants were strained. On one occasion when the Muin-et-Tujjar's Agent endeavoured to enforce the landing fees against certain boats with the help of the soldiers, a violent demon stration against him was made by the Arabs. The postal arrangements between Mohammerah and Shuster collapsed, cwino- to want of funds for payment of the service, and early in November the post office at Mohammerah was closed, communication with the interior being closed* Trade has been satisfactory, the export of wheat from the Karun, owing to a good harvest and low prices, increased. In imports, notwithstanding the diversion of a part of the transhipment trade for Koweit, and increased vigi lance against smuggling into Turkish territory, there has been a small increase. Messrs. Lynch maintained their service on the lower Karun and ran a steamer fortnightly between Mohammerah and Bunder Nasser^ (Ahwaz); at times a barge was also towed, when cargo sufficed. On the upper river, the B10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN gulp POLITICAL S.S. Shmhan managed by Messrs- Lynoh on behalf of the Persian Government carried goods for Shuster. The buildings for the Company, which had so lon» been the subject of negotiation, have been completed and occupied. 9.—-FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. His Royal Highness Rukn-ud-Dowlah, brother of His Majesty the Shah who had been appointed Grovernor-General of Fars in March 1894, held this high office throughout the year. The Kawam-ul-Mulk had at the same time been given the subordinate but still very important Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf ports. His Excellency did not, however, arrive at Bushire, the head- quarters of his charge, till the middle of July, the duties in the interval being carried on by Haji Mirza Abdullah Khan. The beginning of the year saw a revival of the vexatious and useless embargo on the export of wheat. The action taken was sudden ; it was unex pected also in view of the fact that the previously existing embargo had only been removed three months before ; indeed, everything connected with this mis chievous measure was irregular, capricious, and uncertain. Difficulties at once arose in regard to stocks for export already purchased or contracted for, and were not arranged without much trouble. British merchants protested and the newly appointed Governor, immediately on his arrival, sought our support in representations at Tehran against the measure on the ground of its use- lessness as regards its ostensible object—the relief of scarcity at Shiraz,— which the miserable state of the road and the cost of transport praotically barred, and the injury to the producers in view of the abundant harvest in the coast districts. A certain remedy for the situation after Persian methods was soon found in an extensive evasion of the edict, considerable shipments being made with very transparent secrecy, with the result that export ,to the value of over £21,000 was effected during a year over three- fourths of which the embargo rested. So good a harvest would, however, doubtless have produced a heavier export under normal conditions, as the un- certainty and vexatious demands to which the trade was liable could not but operate to materially restrict it. In February 1895 a stricter enforcement of the passport system was noti fied by the Persian Government, under which foreigners, not provided with passports duly vised by Agents of the Government abroad, on entering the country from the sea board, are required to have them vised by the passport clerks, as on other frontiers, upon payment of fixed fees. Dengue fever, which had not for very many years troubled these regions, made its appearance at Bushire during the summer. Shiraz again suffered from many troubles, the result of natural causes aggravated^ by misrule; disorder, violence, and crime, in which the Persian troops or Sirbazes were said to have a share, were rife in and about the city at various times, and there was much discontent and suffering. His Boyal High ness the B/ukn-ud-Dowlah did not arrive at Shiraz to assume the personal control of affairs till more than four months after his appointment to the Governor-Generalship, and the elements of confusion thus received encourage ment. Towards the close of the year, the uncertainty as to the prospects of the re-appointment of His Royal Highness, and the future of the Government, pro duced their usual ill-effects. The nomad tribes, unchecked by any firm control, again resorted to violence and plunder, and added to the general sense of fear and insecurity. Two members of the Kashkai tribe were executed at Shiraz, possibly rather as an arbitrary measure of severity than an act of firm justice.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE, THE YEAR 1894-95. 11 In October the Legation courier was robbed near Abadeh, between Ispa han and Shiraz, and the Persian mail was also plundered on the outskirts of the province. Scarcity and high prices generally prevailed, and distress was due not only to the cost of food, but was at times acutely felt owing to the great difficulty in procuring fuel, an evil which was increased by the high-handed interference of the soldiery, in securing the supplies entering the town, in the interests of certain dealers. Locusts appeared in April, committing great ravages and caused a further rise in the price of grain, though the injury done by them finally proved somewhat less serious than had at first been feared. At the close of the year, the reported discovery in several of the districts of large quantities of the eggs of these ravagers again raised the price of food-grains. In the beginning of the winter, there was heavy rain, which did much harm to crops in the milder parts of the province. Abadeh, which last year was reported to have suffered so severely, and which had been rebuilt, was so unfortunate as to be again much damaged by heavy rain. A heayy snowfall in January is said to have destroyed many houses in Shiraz, and to have added much to the distress by raising the prices of food and fuel. A severe epidemic disease broke out in the summer among the cattle, horses, and mules in the districts about Shiraz, and caused serious mortality. This combined with the scarcity of fodder, high price of barley, and probably other causes led to an unprecedented rise in the rate for transport between Shiraz and the coast. This of course added to the already effectual obstacles preventing any appreciable relief of scarcity inland by importing supplies from the coast districts. Observations for the telegraphic determination of longitudes, with the help of the cables and land lines of the Indo-European Telegraph, were con ducted at ISushire and Jask in connection with Karachi. 10.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN. Sirteep Zain-el-Abadin was again Governor of the province. On the death of Sardar Din Muhammad Khan, his eldest son, Abdi Khan succeeded to the Chiefship of Dashtiyari. An expedition, under Duran Khan, marched against AH Eeza Khan, one of the Eashakird Chiefs, who had refused to pay the revenue demanded of him. He fled, but the claim was enforced against another of the Chiefs. In December Din Khan, Chief of Sirbaz, and his son, were killed by two of the customs farmers of that place, who then fled for refuge over the border to Mand. The Governor of Bampur thereupon wrote demanding their surren der or liberty to effect their arrest by force. He was, however, induced to resume the matter to be dealt with at the forthcoming visit of the Political Ao-ent of Southern Baluchistan. On this occasion, a very satisfactory adjust ment of the outstanding feuds, which had been carried on for many years by the Baluch tribes on both sides of the frontier, was arrived at. . The sudden and mysterious disappearance of a Hindu trader from Gwettar was reported in December. Foul play was suspected, but though the local authorities professed to have instituted a thorough search, no trace of the miss- ins man was found. , , , i • The country round Jask was much disturbed by a quarrel, with serious results, between two of the neighbouring Sardars. In aarising out of au attempt to settle a dispute by the seizure of certain camels, the son o Mir All vL .wi hv the riartv of Mir Abdun Nabi, whose arrest was ordered by the X referred to the officers of the Telegraph. Mir AU B12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL asking for help in the way of ammunition which was refused. The Sardars were later summoned to Bunder Abbas; but Mir Abdun Nabi having been attacked en route and a fight ensuing, in which a few were killed, refused to continue his journey, and was subsequently deprived of his authority. The subsidy allowed by the Telegraph, for the protection of their line, was couse. quently transferred to Mir Haji Yusuf, whose appointment had been intimated The long continued grievances of the exaction of dues in transit between Bunder Abbas and Kerman, on goods which had already paid the full duty at the port of entry, was at last redressed. A refund, in one case, was obtained through Her Britannic Majesty's Legation at Teheran; in others, repayments appear to have been made through the local authorities, and the complaints oa this score have ceased. Some difficulties in connection with the escape of fugitive Rind slaves to Gwadur and their deportation thence continued, and threats, and even violence were resorted to by the owners. A slave belonging to two brothers was kid' napped after many years' residence at Gwadur, and it was only after the stop.' page of the. subsidy enjoyed by one of the brothers from the Telegraph, that the man was freed. One Din M uhammad Hind proceeded to far greater lengths in the way of reprisal, and seized an Indian bunniah, whom he carried off from the road between Pasni and Gwadur. He also sent messages, threatening further acts of violence in retaliation for the deportation of his escaped slaves. The bunniah was released after a month or two, on the security, it is said, of another Bind. A telegraph station was re-established at Gwadur as a combined post and telegraph office; the telephone, which had been tried, having been found to be a failure. 11.—SLAVE TRADE. There were several cases of importing and dealing in slaves on the Arab coast. A fine was imposed on the Chief of Ras-el-Khymah for his neglect of treaty obligations in respect of an attempted importation of slaves into his ter ritory from the Maskat coast. In ^ ne CaSe, ^ negroes were captured from a vessel wrecked on t e south coast of Arabia and enslaved by their Bedouin captors. His Highness t le bultan of Maskat acted most promptly and energetically and succeeded in rescuing nve. There were a few cases of importation of new slaves on the south coast of ersia, in mos cases the slaves were traced and given their freedom. Two slaves took refuge in the Besidency at Bushire and two in the Lingah 0 . . ea - C ,, ace 0]ae was m ^umitted, and the other not coming under , e treat y was restored to the local authorities, under promises of future good treatment by the masters. 12.— ROYAL NAVY VESSELS. fr!i ri ! f H ' M ' S .* ?F hinX P roceeded t0 India on relief by H.

The year under report will be chiefly memorable for the rebellion which p olifcical broke out in Maskat in February 1895, and which first declared itself in a treacher ous attack on the Sultan's palace, followed by an attempt to assassinate him. The rebellion, its causes, and its probable effect on the politics of Oman, have already formed the subject of an exhaustive report to the Government of India; but its chief incidents are briefly related in the body of the narrative below. The poli tical history of Oman during the ten months preceding the rebellion, does not present many features of interest; nor are there many events of importance to record. A serious outbreak of hostilities in the Semail valley, which, had it occur red, would have probably entailed a general inter-tribal war, was threatened early in the year, the Ghafiri tribes having intimated to the Ahl-Boshar that they would attack them after the Bed on April 8th. A sharp skirmish actually took place between the Hinawis who were supporting the Ahl-Boshar and the Ghafiris, while small parties of the Ahl-Boshar were on several occasions attacked by the Nidabiyeen, a section of the Ghafiri tribe. Further fighting was, how ever, averted by the personal intervention of the Sultan, who succeeded in effecting a settlement of the differences between the tribes, and in inducing them to agree to a formal peace. In May, Sheikh Abdullah, son of Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali, the Tamimeh of the Harth, Sheikh Mohsin-bin-Aamir Al-Harithi and Sheikh Amir-bin-Salim, one of the Sheikhs of the Beni-Boo Hassan, arrived at Muscat in the Sultan of Zanzi bar's S. S. Avoca, It was stated that they had been on a visit to Zanzibar and had been received with great honour by the Sultan, who, besides other valuable gifts, had presented them with three field-pieces and a considerable supply of gunpowder. Early in June there was serious rioting at Mattrah between some of the Seedee servants of the Khojah residents of that place and a party of Baluchis. The opposing factions twice met in conflict on the beach, and order was with difficulty restored. On the 20th of the same month the inhabitants of Maskat were greatly shocked to learn that Seyyid Fahad, the younger brother of the Sultan, had on the previous night committed suicide. Seyyid Fahad had recently been divorced from his wife, and it was supposed that his domestic troubles had so weighed on his mind as to drive him to put an end to his exist ence. The Political Agent on being informed of the sad occurrence, paid the Sultan and his elder brother an official visit to express his sympathy with them in their loss, and some days later, in obedience to instructions which had been received from India, he personally conveyed to the two brothers a message of condolence from His Excellency the Viceroy. Towards the end of June it was reported that Sheikh HamoodAl-Jahafi, who has been for many years a fruitful source of trouble to the ruling power in Oman, was endeavouring to excite dis affection in the interior, and that it was his intention to head a rising against the Sultan. The report did not appear to gain much credence. July was an uneventful month; but in August the Sultan received news of the murder of Sheikh Hilal-bin-Zahir of the Beni-Hina tribe by Seif-bin- Hamad, the eldest son of the late Seyyid Hamad-bin-Seif-bin-Amir of the Yal- Boo-Said, who was Wali of Nezwah during the reign of Seyyid Toorkee.16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Bevenge for the confiscation of the property of his family by the murdered Sheikh was supposed to have been the motive of the murderer who fled for refuge to the Beni-Riyam. At the beginning of September Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, the Wali of Semail, who had been sent to Nezwah, reported to the Sultan that Sheikh Badr-bin-Hilal-bin-Zahir, who was in possession of that town, was prepared to hand it over to His Highness if he would repair thither in person. It was at first the Sultan's intention to proceed to Nezwah ; but on receiving later inform ation which gave him reason to doubt the sincerity of Sheikh Badr-bin -Hilal 's offer, he abandoned the idea. The next event of sufficient importance to call for remark was the arriyal of Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali at Samad. Towards the end of October the Sultan received a letter from this Sheikh, who wrote that he was visiting Samad for the purpose of settling the differences which had arisen amongst the Hinawi tribes residing there, the Haboos, the Zakawineh, and the Wurood, He added that he had also hoped to make peace between the Haboos and certain of the Ghafiri tribes with whom they had been at war, but that during his sojourn at Samad a serious disturbance had taken place, and he had in consequence declined to negotiate between the Hinawis and the Ghafiris. The latter had since taken their departure. The Sheikh's letter was followed by a rumour that the Ghafiri tribes holding the passes into Oman proper had closed them to Hinawi and Ghafiri caravans desirous of coming from the interior to Maskat. They had been directed to take this step, it was asserted, by Sheikh Saleh who was much incensed against the Sultan, on account of the marked favour which he had been latterly showing to Sheikh Saeed-bin-Ali of the Harth tribe, with a view Sheikh Saleh believed, to undermining the latter's influence in the Sharkiyeh! The rumour proved to be true, and a messenger was immediately despatched by the Sultan to summon the chiefs of the tribes implicated to Maskat; and on their refusing to comply, he seized and imprisoned the two sons of one of their number who happened to be at Mattrah. On the 8th of November Monsieur Paul Ottavi, who had been appointed Vice-Consul for the French Republic at Maskat, arrived in the mail steamer from Karachi, and a week later Lapwing, with, the Political Resi dent in the Persian Gulf on board, anchored in the harbour. The Political Resident landed, and after a stay of a few days during which he exchanged visits with the Sultan, left in R.I.M,S. Lawrence for Bushire. Meanwhile disquieting reports were abroad regarding Sheikh Saleh's movements; he had collected a large force, it was stated, with the intention not, as he himself gave out, of punishing the Beni-Shehem and of investing Wadi Idmah, but of attacking the capital. His subsequent punishment of the Beni- Shehem and capture of Wadi Idmah testified, however, to the truth of his announcement; but he was still believed to be contemplating a move against Maskat, and the arrival of his son with a considerable following in the Wadi Tiyeen gave colour to the report. These repeated rumours appeared to make no impression on the Sultan who refused to believe either that Sheikh Saleh had hostile designs against himself or that the closing of the passes by the Ghafiri tribes was to be ascribed to his influence. In the third week in November he received a second letter from Sheikh Saleh in which he was informed of the punishment inflicted by the Sheikh on the Beni-Shehem, and in which it was stated that the Ghafiris would shortly re-open the passes. Sheikh Saleh also expressed a hope that the Sultan would, on the re-opening of the passes, release the two Ghafiris whom he had seized as hostages; and on authentic news reach ing Muscat some days later that the passes were no longer closed, the two youths were given their freedom. In the last week of November Rashid-hin- TJzaiz, 'Wali of Semail, arrived in Maskat from Semail, and reported thatRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1894-95. 17 u' ^ had been concluded between the Rahabiyeen and Al-Jawabir, a branch of the tribe of the Al-Haboos. *%i Sal J' News of a more unpleasant nature was received in December to the effect n that there had been a sanguinary conflict between the Beni-Eiyam and Beni- i]^' Hina residing in Nezwah. The disturbance appears to have commenced with ^ ' an attack by the Beni-Riyam on a mosque situated in the quarter called |||| As -Snweik, and the massacre of fifteen of the Beni-Hina who were inside. On hearing of this outrage the Beni-Hina, headed by Badr-bin-Hilal flew to arms, and in the encounter which ensued twenty-five of the Beni-Riyam were killed ^ and fifty wounded. The disorder reigning subsequent to this disturbance was apparently brought to the notice of Sheikh Saleh, for, in January 1895, he de- spatched his son Sheikh Abdullah to Nezwah with orders to make peace between Sheikh Badr-bin-Hilal and the Riyami faction. Early in February the Sultan received information that Sheikh Abdullah, w | 10 had been joined by Sheikh Hamood Al-Jahafi, had left Nezwah, and that both Sheikhs were on their way to Maskat to visit and interview him regard ing the condition of that town. They arrived at Maskat, each with a small following, the former on Eebruary 11th, accompanied by Sheikh Mohsin-bin- Amir Al-Harithi; the latter on February 12th. The three Chiefs were received with hospitality by the Sultan, who, after according them an audience, dis missed them on the evening of February 12th with the usual presents, and they intimated their intention of leaving Maskat on the same night or early on the following morning. Subsequent events clearly demonstrate that such was never their intention, for after dark a number of their followers who had not been allowed to enter Maskat, made their way into the town in parties of two's and three's, not without exciting the suspicions, however, of the Hydrami and Wahabi soldiers of the Sultan. The latter hastened to inform their master, who thus had ample warning of the treacherous designs of his visitors. The warning was entirely disregarded, the Sultan refusing to believe that, so long as the Chiefs and their followers were in the town as his guests, they could be guilty of so grave a breach of the rules of Arab hospitality as to take advan tage of their position to attack their host. He was speedily undeceived, for, at daybreak, on the morning of the 13th, his palace was suddenly attacked and the rebels, having overpowered the few guards on duty, proceeded in the direc tion of his sleeping apartments with the intention of taking his life. The alarm had, however, been given, and the Sultan supported by some of his fol lowers offered a determined resistance; but, after keeping his assailants at bay for some time, he was eventually compelled to take refuge with his family and adherents in Eort Jellali, his brother Seyyid Muhammad-bin-Toorkee, who had t; also taken flight from his residence, finding a similar refuge in Fort Merani. Early intelligence of this serious state of affairs was brought to the Politi- s cal Agent, who at once took such steps as were possible for the protection of :i British life and property, and addressed a letter to Sheikh Abdullah, the rebel ifl! leader, intimating that he would be held responsible for any injury that British |S subjects might suffer at the hands of his followers. f 1 - The followers of the Sultan meanw^hile, supported by a vigorous cannon- ^ ade and rifle fire from Eort Jellali, made a determined attempt to recover pos- ^ session of the palace, which proved, however, unsuccessful, and a lull in the # fighting followed, neither party being in sufficient force to take the aggressive. P The rebels who, simultaneously wdth the attack on the palace, had seized the # town gates, were now masters of the greater part of the town; but they con- itiiS : tented themselves with taking up as strong a defensive position as their sur- c lrf roundings admitted of, and quietly awaited the arrival of re-inforcements. c18 administration hepobt on the persian gulp political Their proceedings were orderly from the outset; the inhabitants of the town British and Arab, were not, as a rule, interfered with or molested, and it was publicly proclaimed by their leaders that the sole object of the rebellion was to dethrone Seyyid Feysal who, by his weak rule, had shown himself unfitted to govern Oman, and to replace him by a Sultan whose power would make itself felt throughout the country. It was further announced that the force of rebels in the town was but the advance guard of a much larger force which under the command of Sheikh Saleh was advancing on Maskat, and was hourly ex pected to arrive. Early on the morning of February 14)th, the mail steamer from the Per sian Gulf was sightedj and on her arrival about an hour later she was sent without delay to Charbar with a telegram from the Political Agent reporting the outbreak of the rebellion to the Political Resident at Bushire, and request ing that a man-of-war might be despatched as soon as possible to protect British interests at Maskat. On February 18th H. M. S. Sphinx arrived and, as there had been severe fighting that morning in the quarter of the town chiefly occupied by bunniahsi the Political Agent considered the moment opportune to require a temporary cessation of hostilities in order to enable British subjects to leave the town. In compliance with the request of the Political Agent a truce of a few hours for the purpose indicated was agreed to by both belligerents, and advantage was taken of it to arrange for the removal of British subjects to a place of safety. At 2 p.m . on the same day K. I. M. S. Laiorence arrived, having on board the Political Resident who assumed thenceforth the general direction of affairs, and a third British ship, H. M. S. Bramble from Bombayj reached Maskat some days later. Of the subsequent progress of the rebellion there is but little to record: a desultory warfare extending over a period of some three weeks ensued, carried on by the opposing forces with varying success and interrupted only by a truce of three days demanded by the Political Resident with a view to enabling British subjects, who complained that their shops were being looted, to remove their property from the town. The fighting appeared to be throughout of a half-hearted character, and this was especially noticeable in the Sultan's forces who, although re-inforced during the war by strong detachments of the Beni- Boo-Ali, the Beni-Rasib, and the Hishm, and considerably outnumbering their adversaries, made no determined effort to expel the rebels and recover the capi tal for their sovereign. The evident apathy of his followers had eventually the effect of producing in the mind of the Sultan a feeling of despair of achieving success by their agency, and he had recourse to other and more successful means to bring the war to a conclusion. Negotiations were opened with Sheikh Saleh, the rebel leader, and on March 9th it was announced that peace had been concluded. The town was evacuated the same evening by the rebels who set fire, as they left, to the Ohorah Bazaar, and it subsequently transpired that they had received some thousands of rupees as the price of their retire ment. With the evacuation of Maskat the rebellion ended, and during the few weeks that remained to the close of the official year the peace of the capi tal was not again disturbed, nor was any occurrence of importance reported ■If' from the interior. In April His Highness the Sultan, influenced by the heavy shipments General of copper coins to Bombay and their consequent scarcity in Maskat, had in contemplation the promulgation of an order prohibiting their exportation. He was dissuaded, however, from taking this step, but in order to meet the want felt, he imported the necessary machinery for striking his own copper coin. On its arrival at Maskat a mint was established and the work of coining cohi- menced.2 RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1894-95. 19 In August when the date season was at it its height, His Highness saw fit to adopt a measure which was the cause of considerable inconvenience and loss to British subjects trading at Mattrah. Without previous warning to those chiefly concerned instructions were issued to the customs master for the removal from Mattrah of the scales for weighing dates, and exporters were in formed that, during the remainder of the date season, the scales at Maskat H\, would alone be available for the weighment of dates for export. On October 5th the Telegraph office at Gwadur, which had been closed since September 1893, was re-opened, and it was announced that the office would thenceforth be maintained as a combined post and telegraph office. The case of the seven Africans, referred to in last year's report, has again slave trade ^ een ^ le repeated references to His Highness the Sultan; but none of their number have as yet been recovered. The terms of the agreement which had been concluded with the Rinds of Mand by the Political Agent in Southern Baluchistan on behalf of the Government of India in January 1894 were in July communicated to His Highness the Sultan. One of the clauses of the agreement was to the effect that the runaway slaves of the Binds taking refuge at Gwadur would not be allowed to remain, but would be deported elsewhere as quickly as possible. His Highness was accordingly requested to instruct his Wali at Gwadur to afford every facility for their deportation, the cost of which would be borne by the Government of India. There were no seizures of slave-dhows during the year. Eifty fugitive slaves took refuge at the Consulate; of these forty-four were liberated and five were dismissed, being held not entitled to their freedom under the Treaty of 1873, while one left the protection of the Consulate during investigation of his case. Her Majesty's ships Sphinx, 'Pigeon, Lapwing, and Bramble, and the R. I. M. S. Lawrence touched at Mas- Navy ' kat. Maskat was also visited by the Italian man-of-war Cristoforo Colombo with His Royal Highness the Duke of Abruzzi on board, by the Turkish gun boat Sahir and corvette Merrikh, and by the French man-of-war Troude, In July, a Persian hagla belonging to Abdul Kadir and Ibrahim-bin- „ . Abdul Wahid of Lin^ah, was wrecked on Marine. 0 the south-east coast of Arabia at a place near Mahout. The nakhoda and crew reached the shore in a boat; but on land ing they were at once set upon by the Bedouins and robbed of all they pos sessed ; while eight of their number who were negroes were carried off into slavery. The nakhoda and the remainder of the crew made their w^ay to Maskat and reported the circumstances to His Highness the Sultan. Measures were immediately taken by His Highness to effect the liberation of the negroes, and five of them were subsequently recovered. Of the remaining three two were believed to have been ransomed by an inhabitant of Lingah, and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was addressed with a view to the necessary en quiries being made, it being also suggested that these men if traced might be able to furnish information regarding the fate of their missing companion. Major J. Hayes-Sadler held charge of the Political Agency and Consulate official changes. throughout the year. J. F. WHYTE, Major, E. B, M.'s Folitical Agent and Consul, 'Maskat, c2P art III.—REPORT ON THE TRADE AND COMMERCE OF THE CON SULAR DISTRICT OF BUSHIEE FOR THE YEAR 1894. The year 1894 showed welcome signs of reaction from tbe depression under which trade had recently laboured. At the three ports—Bushire, Bunder Abbas, and Liogah—the value of im ports increased by over sixty-two lakhs, and that of exports by over twenty and a half lakhs, as compared with the preceding year. This large increase has taken place in spite of serious drawbacks both in the case of imports and exports. Some of these drawbacks have been removed ; but others unfortunately still remain. In exports the increase as regards Bushire is mainly due to extensive transhipments of arms to Bahrein, which had no place in the returns for the previous years; to large shipments of wheat; to improvement as regards wool and carpets; and to a rise in the price of opium. Specie exports were also considerably higher. These items were more than double the decrease in the case of cotton, almonds, shells, silk, and tobacco. In imports, cotton goods showed the largest increase, as against the falling off in sugar and metals. At Bunder Abbas by far the most conspicuous item of improvement was tea, the imports of which were considerably more than doubled. Cotton goods and twist were also imported in larger quantities, w 7 hile wool contributed the largest item of increase to the imports. The chief difficulty in the way of exports was that w^hich is affecting all countries which have a silver standard of currency, namely, the depreciation of silver. The standard coin of the country, the kran, was at the commence ment of the year at an exchange value of 451 to the pound sterling. In April it had risen to 51J, and though in August it fell for a short time to 49^ it soon rose again and continued to do so steadily till the end of the year by which time it had reached to 67 to the pound sterling. The other difficulty against which imports had to contend during the year was an abnormal rise in the rate of transport between Bushire and Shiraz. In the first three months of the year the rate varied from krans 55 75 per 100 mans, but fell in April to from krans 80—35. In October it rose to krans 100, and in November the rate rose to krans 195 for piece-goods and krans 200 for loaf-sugar and case goods. This price has never been touched before, and naturally completely paralysed all trade between Bushire and the north which goes solely by this route. It is not easy to account fully for so extreme a rise. Several causes no doubt contributed to it, the most important being a very heavy mortality from a severe epidemic among transport animals, and the high prices for grain and fodder. It was also said that transport was attracted by the demands of trade, to lines further in the interior of the country, and this doubtless added its effects in raising prices between the coast and Shiraz. The increased imports of piece-goods and Indian teas are very favourable to British and British Indian trade. Of the exports which showed a decrease, the falling off is greatest in raw cotton, shells, and tobacco. The reason for it in the case of cotton was that22 administration report on the persian gulf political the cultivators being afraid of the return of the locusts which had ruined their previous year's crop, were very sparing in the amount they laid down, and the crop was proportionately small. The export of tobacco was impeded by the fact that the Turkish Society du Tombac, which is the best customer of the Persian producers, was unable to purchase owing to the opposition of the Mullahs and the pressure they brought to bear on the producers. The Societe has now managed to break down this opposition, and there should be no impediment in future to the export of tobacco. W ith regard to another cause which would ordinarily be regarded as of paramount efficiency in restricting export, a strangely contrary result is dis closed, shipments of wheat having, in spite of the embargo which was in oper ation for three-fourths of the year, increased enormously. The ' Clan Line ' of steamers instituted a service during the year between London and the Persian Gulf, and the results are said to be sufficiently satisfac tory to induce them to continue it. The increased competition among the carrying companies had the effect of lowering the rates of freight from 28 and 30 shillings per ton in January to 18 shillings per ton at the end of the year, so that a continuance of this stimulus to trade may be anticipated. As far as can be foreseen now there seems reason to hope for a fairly prosperous import trade this year; but unfortunately prospects as regards exports are not much improved. The locusts have made their appearance again and done much damage, and the embargo on wheat is again in force, to produce possibly less favourable results than those which attended it last year. Imports. Cotton goods, —A distinct improvement on the previous year is noticeable in this branch of trade, statistics showing that the value of cotton goods im ported has increased from £471,781, the figures for 1893, to £592,962, or nearly 25 per cent. It is asserted, however, that, owing to the abnormal rise in the rate of mule hire between Bushire and Shiraz which touched 200 krans per * One Tabriz man is equal to 7|B). approximately. Tabriz mans in the months of Nov ember and December, bales of cotton goods in large numbers were left lying at Bushire either within the custom house precincts or stocked in their owners 7 godowns whence they would not be removed until conditions more favourable to their despatch up-country presented themselves. Prices during the year are described as being good ; but the persistent fall in the exchange value of the kran rendered the^ealisa- tion of a profit a matter of extreme difficulty. Copper and /nw.—High prices occasioned by the fall in the exchange value of the kran and enhanced rates for mule transport caused the demand for these metals to be restricted. Imports did not in consequence come up to the average of former years. Candles. —The trade in candles has not flourished during 1894, and a marked decrease in the value of the stocks imported is noticeable when the year's results are compared with those for 1893. Unfavourable exchange, and increased cost of mule transport have no doubt contributed in a large measure to bring about this result. Arms and Ammunition.—k. vastly increased importation is believed to have been made during the year. It is very difficult, however, to obtain re liable information on the subject of this trade, as there is theoretically an embargo on the importation of arms and ammunition into the country/buthesidency and ma.skat political agency for the yeae, 1894-95. 23 that a large and profitable business is, doapit© this fact &gt; carried on, there can be very little doubt. Tea. —There has been a strong demand throughout the year for Indian and Batavian teas, which seem to be steadily supplanting the China teas in favour with the Persian consumer. Heavy consignments, chiefly from India* were received by native merchants, who found no difficulty in disposing of them at a good profit. It was, however, at the port of Bunder Abbas that this trade received its most vigorous impulse, the imports being more than double that of the previous year. This largely increased import was probably, to a great extent, due to an effort to take advantage of a favourable opportunity for supplying the demands of regions beyond the north-east frontier of Persia. Gold Lace and Gold Thread. —There was but a slight demand for these articles, and business in them was slack. Indigo. —Indigo appears to continue in strong demand in Persia, for, although the imports of 1893 were above the average of former years, they have been exceeded by those of 1894, an increase of £5,916 in the value of the indigo brought into the country being reported. China*ware. —-There was an advance in the demand for these articles, and it was imported in large quantities. Glass and Glass-ware. —An average market was found for these articles. Kerosine Oil. —The year opened with a strong demand for kerosine oil, and imports were very heavy; the demand subsequently declining, this result ed in the market being overstocked to such an extent that importers have found it necessary to re-export cases of this oil in large numbers to Basreh for sale in Turkish Arabia. Loaf-Sugar. —The heavy importation of 1893 proved to be in excess of the demand and large stocks of loaf-sugar remained on the importers ,- hands at the close of the year. This circumstance, together with an augmented importation from Russia and the abnormal rise in mule hire, had the effect of seriously diminishing the volume of trade in this produce vid the Gulf ports. Mauritius Sugar. results of the year have been far from satisfac tory for the Mauritius sugar importers, the same combination of circumstances which so adversely affected the loaf-sugar trade rendering a large importation impossible. E xports. W r ool— r \h.v good prices realised in 1893 gave an impetus to the wool trade, and shipments from Persia were accordingly heavy during 1894. The demand had, however, the effect of raising prices in Persia, and prices on the London market having in the meantime receded, wool exporters did not obtain the satisfactory results anticipated. Opium. —Owing to the strong demand for this drug in the China markets and the good prices ruling, a brisk and profitable business was carried on with China throughout 1894. On the other hand, the opium trade with London is reported to have languished until the close of the year when an improvement was noticeable. The results of the trade with China would have been still more satisfactory had it not been for the fact that opium growers having lost heavily in 1893 owing to the low prices which the drug commanded, had, in the following sowing season, materially curtailed their sowings with the result that in 1894 the supply of opium was not equal to the demand. The price of , . ,, t t opium in Persia varied from krans* * One kran is equal to 4^ pence at the present rate « i • • of exchange, viz., krans 57-19 to the £. 3,200—3,300 per chest at the beginning of the year to krans 4,100 at its close.24 administration report on the persian gulp political Shells. —As prices in 'London offered no encouragement to the importer, the export of shells from Persia was very greatly reduced, and fell to quite an inconsiderable figure. Gum. —In spite of the fact that the London market was well stocked with gum and that considerable quantities remained unsold, native traders exported largely. Prices have been firm through. * 124 Ihs approximately. . ,, 0 „ 0 out the year at krans 30—35 per Hashem maund.* Horses. —The number of horses shipped to Bombay shows a slight decrease on former years. Good prices were not realised and the season is not believed to have been a profitable one for horse exporters. Cot!on. —There has been an extraordinary decrease in the export of cotton from the Gulf ports during the past year. This may be partly ascribed to the fall off in the supply occasioned by the curtailed sowings of the cultivators who, it is said, dreaded that the visitation of locusts which had such disastrous effects in 1892 and 1893 would be repeated. But there has been, so it is assert ed, a still more powerful cause at work. It was stated in last year's report that there was reason to believe that the Persian cotton trade with Russia might be made to assume considerable proportions; this prediction has now found its verification, for a considerable quantity of the cotton which was con signed by Ispahan merchants in former years to Bombay, is reported to have been despatched during 189^ to Russia, finding in that country a favourable market. This exportation to Persia J s northern neighbour naturally entailed a proportionate diminution in the amount exported via the Persian Gulf. Dates, —The yield was less than normal, accompanied by a fall of prices in India. Dates form, however, an unimportant item in the Persian export trade. Almonds, —Fall of prices in Europe, increased exportation to Russia, and enhanced cost of transport in Southern Persia may be specified as the chief causes which brought about a large decrease in the export of almonds from the Gulf ports in 1894. Silk. —The production of silk was much below the average of former years, owing to the prevalence of disease among the silk-worms, aggravated by the neglect of the breeders. A considerable decrease in the amount exported as compared with the results for 1893 is consequently noticeable. Wheat.—In spite of plentiful crops, the embargo on the exportation of wheat which had been removed by the Governor of Bushire in January was in April re-imposed by order of the Persian Government, who feared, it was said, a renewal of the bread riots of 1892 in Shiraz, where the price of grain was abnormally high. Shipments from the Gulf ports were nevertheless carried on with the most transparent secrecy under the cognisance of the local authorities, with the result that the export enormously exceeded that of the preceding year| the figures for the values being £21,299 as against £1,157. Tobacco. Tobacco was exported in greatly reduced quantities during 1894. The attempted interference with the purchase of tobacco in Persia by the Turkish ' Societe du Tombac^ mentioned in last year's report, has ended in failure, and the free sale of tobacco to the agents of the Society is now allowed. Carpets. Exports have been very heavy, and results, most satisfactory to the exporters, are reported. M iscellaneous. Exchange, The year opened with exchange at 45f krans per pound ster ling, but rose steadily until it touched krans 51J in April. This rate was main-RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1894-95. 25 tained until the end of August when there was a slight fall to krans followed by a steady rise to krans 52 until the end of November when it sud denly advanced to krans 56, advancing again to krans 57 at the close of the year. Mule hire, —The rate of mule hire between Bushire and Shiraz varied from krans 55 to 75 per 100 mans during the months of January, February, and March; in April it fell to krans 30—35 for the same weight, to rise again in October to krans 100. In November it reached the unprecedented figure of krans 195 for 100 mans for piece-goods, and 200 krans or loaf-su gar and case goods, a rate which, while it lasted, is stated to have paralysed all trade between Bushire and the north. Freights.—1 l \ iq rate of freights at the commencement of the year showed a considerable improvement on the rates ruling at the close of 1893. During the months of January and February 528^—30 per ton was demanded and obtained; but the keen competition between the steamship companies despatching vessels to the Gulf which ensued had the effect of reducing this rate to E20 per ton and finally to R18 per ton. Several steamers of the ' Clan Line ' ran for the first time to the Gulf ports and Basreh during the year, and it is stated to be the intention of the Directors of this steamship company to establish a regular service of steamers between England and the Gulf.

P aet I,—GENERAL SUMMARY. 1.—OMAN MASKAT COAST. At the opening of the year Oman had barely emerged from a serious convulsion. A treacherous and very formidable insurrection against the Sultan had reduced him to dire straits, when, shut up in the forts which dominated a part of the town, His Highness had to submit to the presence of the rebels in his palace and to their possession of the greater part of his town for nearly a month. The report for the past year has been compiled by Major J. H. Sadler, and follows as part II. The repair of the damages caused by the hostile occupation, improvement of the defences, and a strengthening of the armament of the forts was the first matter demanding the attention of the ruler. On our part it was necessary to examine into, and to determine as closely as might be possible, the losses intlicted on British subjects during the outbreak, and to consider the means for indemnifying them. The loss and injury had been great, there had been pillage which was not confined to the acts of the Sultan's enemies, and wanton destruction had been caused by incendiarism. The enquiry into these matters was very laborious and resulted insn assessment of over seventy-seven thousand dollars as the total amount of the losses sustained by British subjects, and to meet these the Sultan was authorised by Government to impose on the produce of the tribes, to whose excesses and violence it was due, a punitive tax to provide compensation, the term for the complete liquidation of which was fixed at three years. The working of this tax was very far from satisfactory, the proceeds came in slowly and fell far short of the estimate that had been framed, every device was adopted to evade the tax y the despatch of the date produce to the coast for export was delayed, part of it was shipped at Sur to escape payment and much of it w^s doubtless as loudly complained of by the Sultan, passed through the customs at Maskat and Muttrah as the property of friendly tribes. These causes no doubt accounted for a large part of the failure, but the general weakness of His Highness' authority, his inefficient customs organisa tion and a want of firm and energetic effort were also responsible in a great measure for the unsatisfactory result. The Sultan's attitude throughout this matter has not been commendable. His Highness appeared unable 0 to realise the extent of his responsibility for the disastrous injury to the important British interests resulting from the defects of his rule, and seemed to regard his liability as confined to the results of his attempts however feeble to recover indemnity from the actually offending tribes. A2 ADMINISTEATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL The first note of impending trouble at Dhofar on the southern coast of Arabia was sounded in the beginning of the year, when it appeared that the Moplah outlaw, Syed Eadhl bin Alawi, contemplated a revival of his former pretentions to that place. The Sultan was advised to take measures to secure the safety of this remote part of his territory, but neglected to do so. In November the fort was attacked and captured by the ALKathir trihe from the neighbouring upland country, and the son and nephew of the Sultan's Wali, who was himself absent at Maskat, were killed. An expedition despatched by the Sultan for the recovery of Dhofar and the re-establishment of his authority failed owing partly to the Shanifereh tribe declining to co operate as had been hoped, and the Sultan at ooce appealed to Government to help him, and to check the movement which he alleged to be on behalf of the Moplah Syed Fadhl. The Political- Agent was then authorised to proceed to Dhofar in H. M. S. ' Brisk' in order to effect the best settlement possible under the authority of the Sultan. This mission also failed, the rebel Shaikh and his following being found implacably hostile to Maskat and the Sultan's rule as exercised by his Wali Shaikh Suliman bin Suweilam having incurred much odium. The Turkish flag had been hoisted by the rebels, but the concern of the Moplah outlaw with the movement was not clearly estab lished. The Sultan proposed to be ready to send reinforcements to recover Dhofar if supported by us and was informed that the advance of his troops would be covered by the fire of the guns of H. M. S. 'Brisk' from the anchorage. The condition of this proffered aid being that in the future arrangement of Dhofar affairs our advice should be followed. Much apathy and delay was however evinced in the preparations, and shortly after the close of the year under report the Sultan finally decided against the expedition, giving as the ground for rejecting the aid proffered by Government, that he could not bind himself to follow our advice in the future arrangements at Dhofar without being informed what that advice would be. Nezwah, the former capital, and therefore enjoying a certain prestige, was recovered for the Sultan, who had long desired its restoration. The ac quisition was probably a costly one to His Highness. Sayyid Saood bin Azzan made an attempt on Sohar in the Batineh, but the timely despatch of small reinforcements by a steamer which happened to be present sufficed to frustrate the attack. Trade has been satisfactory. The returns show a substantial increase, excluding specie, on the figures for last year, the improvement being nearly equally divided between exports and imports. 2.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. Reports having been received of an importation of slaves at Abu Dthabi, the matter formed the subject of investigation in a visit which the Resident made to the coast in February in the R. 1. m. S. £&lt; Lawrence' accompanied by H. M. S. 'Lapwing. ' It was difficult to obtain exact details, there being a general reluctance to give evidence as to specific facts or figures, Erom the enquiry, however, the conclusion was clear that there had^been importation by sea, and that a considerable number had been brought to Abu Dthabi, some being probably passed on to Katr and other places? The chief could not deny the fact that there had been an importation, but, in admitting the fact of the traffic, sought to defend himself by alleging the general prevalence, without check, of the traffic, and its long continuance with the knowledge of every person on the coast, and asserting 3 that only a part of the slaves brought to the coast reached Abu Dthabi, after a number had been disposed of at the intermediate ports touched at. It being impossible to fix the number of slaves for the importation of whom the chief was respon sible with any exactitude, while it was evident that it could not be small, it was taken at forty, and a fine of dollars 2,100 was imposed upon the chief, after a deduction on account of nine slaves whom he produced and delivered. These,, together with another who effected his own escape, were taken on hoard and carried to Bushire, where they were set free.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAT. 1895-96. 3 No confirmation of the allegations of the chief of Abu Dtliabi regarding the participation by ports other than his own in the trade, by sea, in slaves was forthcoming. It is to be feared, however, that the other towns are not exempt from the responsibility of a share in it and the existence of a trade over land from the Batineh Coast of Maskat, was generally admitted ; the oppor tunity was therefore taken to address a serious warning to the various chiefs in the course of the tour. The trade in slaves overland is beyond our reach, but if means could be found to put an effectual stop to the importation from Africa to Sur, whence slaves are carried to the Batineh, and thence distributed by sea and land to places further up the Gulf, a heavy blow would be struck afc the root of this atrocious evil. In August a party of the Manasir tribe started from Katr upon an expedition which was rumoured to be a pillaging-raid. Timely notice of the movement enabled the Shaikhs to make preparations for resisting them, and the enterprise assumed a more peaceful character. Debai, Shargah and Um-el- Kawein were visited and gifts received from the Shaikhs. At Hamraniv eh, however, the Manasir managed to get the people off their guard and to carry off a number of their animals and a few slaves. A Turkish subject proceeding down the Ajman creek to embark in a vessel outside was shot dead from the bank by a watchman who, on challenging the party, had failed to get a reply. The act, though perhaps culpably rash, was not of the nature of an intentional murder : the watchman w T as at once appre hended by the chief and the Residency made a representation of the facts through the Assistant Political Agent at Busrah with the object of preventing reprisals on Ajman subjects visiting Busrah. A Shura court decided that the chief was free from all liability which rested on the watchman alone, but did not fix the amount of compensation to be paid, it being ^understood, however, that redress of this nature should be given. ' As the result of communications with the Turkish Vice-Consul at Bushire the relations of the deceased waived all claim against Ajman and the matter ended. At the close of the year the chief of Debai, together with the son of the Abu Dthabi chief, visited the Sultan of Maskat. The object of this visit, though there were certain rumours about it, was not divulged. A serious fire occurred in Debai in August, some sixty houses in the suburbs being destroyed, and one life lost. 3.—BAHRAIN. In the report for last year the troubles which threatened Bahrain at its close were noticed. These increased and became serious, the A1 bin Ali tribe being supported in their contumacy and resistance to their chief by Shaikh Jasim bin Mahomed Thani with whose countenance they obstinately insisted on maintaining the obnoxious settlement at Zobara, in defiance of the clearest warning that this would in no case be permitted. Shaikh Jasim and the A| bin Ali tribe under Shaikh Sultan bin Salamah were encouraged in the aggressive attitude they had assumed towards Bahrain by the provincial Turkish officials, the gravity of the situation being there by much increased. Warning and remonstrance being unavailing, it became necessary to adopt measures of coercion, and H. M. S. ' Sphinx ' accordingly under the instructions of Government seized some of the boats of the rebellious tribe. But this step which in ordinary course should have sufficed to bring the A1 bin Ali to reason, failed in its object, owing to the vigorous outside support given to this tribe, who, after their cause had been taken up by Shaikh Jasim and the local Turks, were probably not quite free agents. A number of boats sent from Bahrain to Zobara to bring over the family of one of the leading members of the A1 bin Ali who had made his peace with the chief of Bahrain, were accordingly seized and detained at Zobara under the auspices of Shaikh Jasim. • A few Turkish troops with a minor official had some time before been established at Zobara and the Ottoman flag had been hoisted, and a serious com plexion had thus been given to what in its origin had been a difference betweea4 ADMINISTRATION BE PORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL the Bahrain chief and a tribe on that island, which admitted of no rmfoM interference. A small Turkish war-vessel also appeared on the scptib j remained some time off Zobara; her presence, notwithstanding the declared ohWf of the commander to protect Bahrain, undoubtedly tending to enconrs °„ + k : hostile attitude. The situation daily became more strained and the combination against Bahrain more threatening, till in August the Mutaserrif of El ]),!» addressed a bombastac letter to the Resident reasserting Turkish pretension and intimating that failing a restoration of the boats seized by H M S « an attack would be made by the tribes of the Katr peninsula on Bahrain frL which British subjects should accordingly be removed within seventeen day^ Before this H.M.S. « Pigeon' had also proceeded to Bahrain and on beino-' despatched to Zobara received an order from the petty local official to depart under threat of attack and intimation that the large fleet of Arab craft IviL fLl was prepared for an attack on Bahrain. Matters had now reached a crisis 1! the date named by the El Hasa official for hostilities against Bahrain had arrived. Instant action for the safety of Bahrain was thereupon decided nn lw the benior Naval Officer as necessary, and after due warning both shins onenprl fire on the hostile fleet, of which about 40 were disabled. Shaikh Jasim ttte following morning offered full submission, and in compliance with CantS Belly s demands some 120 more of the boats at Zobara were surrendered and removed to Bahrain. ana After this severe but most necessary lesson, the A1 bin Ali tribe with the exception of bhaikh Sultan and a few adherents returned to Bahrain and t! their aliegiance, under assurances of indulgent treatment and the conditions of lite tliey had previously enjoyed. The final proceedings in connection with this matter were only completed at the close ot the year. Shaikh Jasim was informed in February 1896 nfth* decision of Government, to the effect that as the main instigator of these disturbances he was fined hirty thousand rupees, failing payment of which the captured boats would be destroyed. He however repudiated responsibi- lity in the matter, sheltering himself behind alleged orders for all his acts from the Turkish authorit es and professed to have resigned the g^^-officfal aS^ n y he held from them in Katr, and his own real personal influence In these circumstances an opening to redeem their own boats, b T pavincawo. por ionate share of the indemnity, was offered to the tribes and was availed of to the extent of one-third of the amount; the remaining boats were destroyed a few days after the close of the year. ut^uoyea T .

Disorder and insecurity on the trade routes were caused by the predatory raids of the Ajman, A1 Murrah and other tribes under the nominal suzerainty of the Turks. In June the caravan traffic between Neid and Eowait was thus interrupted, and in October Mahomed Ibn Rashid appealed to the Governor of El Hasa to guarantee the safety of the roads to Nejd and Kasseem, failing which ho claimed discretion himself to chastise the tribes named, as tusturners of the peacR of his territories^UEStDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOK THE TEAR 1895 98. 5 5.—EL HASA. The Governor of El Hasa with the object of gaining credit with his Government, undertook an expedition for the purpose of establishing a more effective and profitable Turkish control over the Ajman, A1 Murrah and other tribes, who had hitherto paid only a nominal tax. The Ajman while admitting' his demands pleaded their inability to pay without recovery of their property ^pillaged by the Muteyr and seized by Mahomed Ibn Rashid. The Governor accordingly attacked the Muteyr with the help of the Ajman and other tribes, capturing some of their animals. He was then summoned to Busrah, and after his return was active in encouraging the hostile attitude taken by Shaikh Jasim bin Mahomed Thani in support of the A1 bin All resistence to the Bahrain chief which has already been noticed. 6 —PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The Nizam -es-Sultaneh was appointed to the Governor-Generalship in March and held the office throughout the year. Notwithstanding that the harvest was favourable, one of the earlier mea sures of the year was the imposition of an embargo on the export of grain. The notice given of the enforcement of this vexatious prohibition was too short for the reasonable requirements of trade operations, the local conditions necessita ting arrangements considerably in advance, for the purchase and transport of o-raln, the securing of freight and other matters, an extension of it was there- fore, though with some difficulty, obtained. / The proceedings in connection with this obnoxious measure were uncer tain and irregular and were so devised as to entail the maximum of restriction on straightforward foreign trade while failing in an effective realisation of the ostensible object, the retention of the grain in the country. It was evaded by the conveyance in native craft of grain to Busrah, whence it could readily be exported f the transit overland from the Howeizah district to the river at Busrah was open, and shipment from the port of Mashur which taps the Ram Hormuz district was unrestrained. The sale of their produce to the best advantage by the people on the lower Karun was however no doubt to some extent prevented, and the Shaikh of Mohammerah and the Arabs under him complained of the difficulty of meeting their taxes. Complete uncertainty prevailed as to the probable duration of the embargo, the indication being that it was governed by arbitrary and interested consider ation, and after a while indeed that its relaxation would depend on pecuniary aw- ran cements with the authorities. Foreign merchants accordingly continued their purchase of wheat in the district; but this obviously would not suit the projects for forcing the merchants into a permanent arrangement pecuniarily advanta geous to those interested, and purchases as well as the collection of purchased stocks and their removal for storage were prohibited. In January there was an open though still quite irregular relaxation, the Governor-General permitting the export of certain stocks, at the same moment that the Central Government proposed to admit it, on condition that no fresh purchases should be made till the next crop should be assured. The facts that the Karguzar, Agent of the Foreign Office, repudiated the authority of the Governor-General, while the Shaikh Gov ernor of Mobammerah claimed to levy a gain on his own account the duty which had already been paid to the Govern or-General, shows the utter confusion and conftict of authority in all the irregular proceedings in this connection. The Central Government overruled both these obstructors. In March the Governor- General again capriciously stopped export, though by that time there could hardly be a doubt of the abundance of the approaching harvest, and finally soon after native and foreign merchants were freely shipping and the embargo was tacitly at an end, though, as far as official notification is concerned, it remained m full force as originally promulgated. Some attempt to open up and improve the safety of trade routes inland from the upper Karun and Diz rivers was made ; the results however by no means came up to the hopes founded on the Nizam-es-Sultaneh's earlier pro fessions.

THE YEAH 1895-96. 7 clear orders, but it gradually became apparent that the cause of the malcontents gained ground. Eirst the Hamal Bashi, who had been allowed to draw into his own hand altogether too many functions and too much power, and who had become the object of very general resentment, suddenly fled, and this was followed early in March by the resignation by the Kowam-ul-Mulk of the Governorship a fortnight before the Vernal equinox from which all changes and new appoint ments in Persia date.^ Temporary and imperfect arrangements for the divided control of public affairs were somewhat tardily made, but these nevertheless owing to the fact that the popular party was in the ascendant, sufficed to maintain order. Haji Mirza Abdullah Khan, who had long been Karguzar, and had also latterly held the Deputy Governorship of Bushire, died in June 1895. During the year under report Shiraz has not been exempt from the evils from which it has suffered in late years—the results both of natural causes and maladministration. The oft repeated tale has continued throughout the year of disorder, plunder, and the laying waste of cultivation by various sections of the nomads; of general lawlessness, resistence to authority, and risings against petty local Governors; of attacks by one tribe on another, and of punitive expeditions or raids directed by the authorities to recover revenue or to coerce the refractory. The Kushkais generally and the Yekdar section of that tribe in particular were prominent in disorder. In October an arrangement, in the usual spirit of Persian dealings with the nomads, was reported to have been arrived at with the lawless tribe, and appears to have taken the form of a com promise of the terms of revenue to be paid, and the presentation of a khillat. The Baharloos also have been very turbulent. An expedition for the arrest of one of the leaders was sent under the conduct of another chief of the same tribe in May ; there was a collision between the parties, and immediately afterwards it was reported that orders from the Central Government for assur ances of safety to the leader whom it was sought to arrest had been received. A little later the leader of the arresting expedition himself fled, and, assuming open hostility, took to pillage and violence. An example of the lengths to which, under the method of the Govern ment, arbitrary violence under the guise of authority can proceed, appearf in the measures for the arrest of an offender of the Soorkhi tribe. The Command er of the Governor's bodyguard being sent on this duty was reported to have attacked the people of the tribe, and indiscriminately plundered their property to a very large amount, thus driving them into outlawry. A case of oppression of a Russian (Shirwani) subject called forth a most vigorous remonstrance from that Government, with the result that the Perrash Bashi who had seized and beaten him in enforcing a demand for taxes was sent with the usual apparatus to the house of the victim, and only escaped severe public punishment by the grace of the outraged party on an ample apology being made by two high officials. Some insecurity prevailed on the road near Shiraz and towards Ispahan. In June the courier with legation despatches for Bushire was shot by robbers ; he finally recovered. The Persian post was three times attacked towards Ispahan, parcels to a large amount being plundered, and the posthorses were carried off close to Shiraz. Locusts appeared in spring and complaints of their ravages near Shiraz and in other parts of the province continued till July. The districts included in the Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf ports were not free from disorder. In Dashtistan an attempt to transfer the sole charge of a tract to one of the two chiefs who had hitherto shared it, was resisted by the other, Ahmed Khan, who shot his rival dead. A punitive expedi tion was then organised under instructions from the capital, a detachment with a small naval gun being sent out. Ahmed Khan being joined by some of the people of Tangistan and Shabankara was able to maintain his resistance, till a small reinforcement was despatched, and at the same time, orders to effect an amicable settlement. He was then induced to present himself atADMINISTRATION EEPOE/T ON THE PERSIAN OULE POLITICAL Bnshire with a strong armed following and received a firman from the Gover nor investing him with the authority in dispute. At Tahiri on the coast Shaikh Ibrahim resisted by force the transfer to another of the post he bad held and maintained his position in the fort, necessitating the despatch of a con siderable force for his expulsion. At Lingah some alarm was caused by the violence of one Syed Yusut' who, having killed a man, evaded the attempt made to arrest him, and brought a party to the attack of the fort. A more vigorous attempt at his arrest under the direction of the Kawam-ul-Mulk also failed, as did an effort to induce him to return to Lingah. In the early part of the year there was much uneasiness in Bushire in consequence of the frequent acts of robbery and violence in the immediate neighbourhood. Grain export again lay under a nominal embargo throughout the year. It was freely evaded for most of the period ; indeed one of its objects would appear to be the opportunity afforded by it for the levy of an illegitimate cess for connivance at its evasion without an open violation of the treaty rights governing the duties in foreign trade. The rainfall for the winter of 1895-96 was remarkably deficient in the Bushire district, ooly 4*75 inches being registered, or a little over one-third of the normal fall. There was also serious failure of rain at Bundar Abbas and Lingah. The distress which at the latter place was becoming acute was relieved by a copious fall which filled the reservoirs at the very end of March. No epidemic visited Bushire and the public health was on the whole good. Fever prevailed to a somewhat greater extent than in the preceding year, but was not of a severe type. Shiraz suffered much from fever of a more viru lent nature, from which the greater part of the population suffered; it caused a good deal of mortality. There was also a rather serious epidemic of cattle disease, from which many animals perished. A postal service was established between Bushire and Arabistan. The series of observations for the telegraphic determination of longitudes was resumed in March between Tehran and Bushire, the final link connecting India with Greenwich being thus completed. 8.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MAKRAN. Sirteep Zain-ul-Abedin continued to hold the Governorship of Bampur. He appears to have made a vigorous effort to increase the revenue derived from Dashtiyari; the people complained loudly and in January it was reported that | two thousand of them had emigrated. The British India traders of the district I and of Charbar joined in these complaints, alleging that their trade was being ruined owing to the exactions of the Governor and the depopulation of the | country. The peace of this region was also disturbed by a conflict between the I two brothers, Abdi Khan and Mahomed Khan, owing to the authority of the f former having been^transferred to his brother on account of his misrule. There was a very unfortunate case of the disappearance of a Hindu trader at Gwetter under circumstances which pointed strongly to foul play. A servant of the Hindu was sent to the native assistant at Gwadur by Sirdar Mahomed Ali, the local Persian authority, who had obtained a confession that he had mur dered his master. The confession was of a most doubtful character, and the servant implicated two men of Sirdar Mahomed Ali who had denounced him as being themselves the actual murderers. The evidence in the case was of a most unsatisfactory nature being confined to the discredited statements of per sons probably connected with the act, and it is to be feared that there is little hope of justice being reached. Several of the Baluch leaders from the neighbourhood collected at Jask in April with large followings, and there was some excitement; their object appeared to bj the nomination of a responsible chief for the district, and they agreed to k ep the peace if the Governor of Bundar Abbas would meet their wishes. Abdul Nabi, headman of the Jask district, who had long received a sub sidy for the protection of the telegraph-line, but had lately lost it owing to his having been involved in a serious feud with a neighbour, died in December.EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY 'FOR THE YEAH 1895-96. 9 9.—SLAVE TRADE. There are many indications of a considerable and perhaps indeed an increased activity in this nefarious traffic recently. In the course of the intimate concern with the affairs of Bahrain, involved in our support of it, through the trouble with which it was threatened from Zobara, many circumstances came to light showing that slaves were imported. On the Oman Pirate Coast there was evidence of a brisk trade, as has been noticed in the section on that coast. There is the strongest reason to believe that Sur—low down on the Maskat coast—is the source for supplying the demand for slaves throughout the Persian Gulf. There is undoubtedly a considerable importation to that place, whence slaves are carried to the Batineh, and distributed to the Arab, and even to the Persian coast. The presence of a gunboat off the south-east corner of the Arabian coast, during the slaves running season, would seem the most effectual mode of striking at the root of the evil. Several slaves appealed to or sought refuge in the Residency ; these cases were examined and dealt with on their merits, freedom being secured in some six cases out of eleven. A large number, over forty slaves, sought freedom at Bahrain ; in almost all these cases manumission certificates were obtained from the chief, but the slaves consented for the most part to return and work for their former masters as free men. 10.—PIRACY. During the general disturbance caused by the Bahrain troubles with Zobara some cases of piracy occurred. A peculiarly bold one was under taken singlehanded by an Arab, who obtaining a passage in a bania's boat returning from Katif to Bahrain, suddenly made a most savage and treacherous attack on the bania, who escaped, with the loss of his hand and other serious wounds, by jumping overboard. The Arab then caused the boatmen to land him on the coast and disappeared with the bania's valuables, estimated at Rs. 40,000. Another British Indian vessel was boarded near Katr, one of the crew was killed and others wounded and the property found was carried off. A number of piracies were committed off the mouth of or within the Shat- el-Arab, and also off the mouth of the Bamishir, the old outlet of the Karun river. Both Turkish and Persian authorities mutually sought to affix the responsibility for these outrages each on the opposite side, but the Arab populations on the two banks have frequent intercourse with each other, and it is in the highest degree probable that they shared in these atrocities. The victims were Persian and Arab, as well as British Indian vessels, and some of the attacks were of a most savage and murderous character, in one case a derelict boat being found with only corpses on board. One of the most serious cases was that of the British Indian buggla ' Haripassa ' from Kathiawar, when four men were killed, three wounded and a large amount in money was plundered, but though urgent representations were made to both the Persian and Turkish authorities no effective result was reached. 11.—ROYAL NAVY.

Administration report of the MasJcat Political Agency for the year 1895-96. Political. —The political history of Oman during the past year does not present many features of interest, neither are there any events of importance to record. Shaikh Saleh bin Ali, regarding whom many wild rumours were spread during the year, does not appear to have led any active opposition against the Sultan, possibly by reason of want of money. In the month of April a party of the Harth tribe arrived from Zanzibar in a British steamer. His Highness the Saltan demanded that these persons, who belonged to Saleh bin Ali's tribe and hence enemies of His Highness, should be handed over to him, but there being no proof of the persons in question having committed any offence against His Highness, the request was not complied with. In order, however, to prevent complications, the persons jn question were taken on to Bundar Abbas and landed there. During this month rumours were current that Saleh bin Ali intended making a demonstration towards Semail with the object of alienating the Gha- firi tribe from the rule of the Sultan. Many of the Shaikhs from the Semail and Sur came to Maskat during the month of April to visit the Sultan and in order to obtain from him recognition, in the shape of money, of the services rendered to His Highness by them in the rebellion. Amongst others, the Shaikhs of the Jenebeh of Sur, the Beni Boo Ali, Beni Hina, Hishem, Beni Boo, Hasan Beni IJmarj Naeem, Beni Basib Hijrieen, Beni Oomer visited Maskat during the past year, with the object of obtaining money from His Highness the Sultan. This system of subsidising the Shaikhs outside Maskat, which was instituted by Seyyid Turki is a source of great weakness to the Sultan, as naturally the Sheik's demands continue increasing and so payment to them of subsidies without effecting any great good tends to keep the Sultan impoverished. During the month of May and June several small disturbances occurred in the interior, but none of these disturbances exceeded the normal inter-tribal disputes of past years. The only importance to be attached to these inter-tribal disputes is that Saleh bin Ali on several occasions tried to turn these disputes to account but not successfully. One of the more important of these inter tribal disputes was the one that occurred in June between the Kazar assisted by the Beni Bian and the Yemen with the Beni B/uwahah at Zikki. This dispute at one time threatened to lead to a general rising and much bloodshed and as Saleh was endeavouring to turn this to account, His Highness deputed his elder brother Seyyid Mahomed bin Tarki to proceed to Semail and effect a settlement, Seyyid Mahomed left in June under an escort of Hinawis and returned in July after restoring tranquillity. In the month of July the Beni Boo Hasan attacked the Beni Boo Ali at Jalaan, but no very serious consequences ensued. Tunitive tax on rebel tribes, —In the month of August His Highness the Sultan decided to impose a punitive tax of 10 per cent, upon the produce of the rebel tribes imported into Maskat and Muttrah, both as a means of punish ment and of meeting the claims of foreigners who suffered losses during the rebellion. The chief loss naturally fell upon the British Indian community, and a committee assembled for the purpose of investigating claims under the presi dency of Surgeon-Colonel Jayakar, found that the claims amounted to over seventy-seven thousand dollars. The fact of this tax being imposed naturally led to resentment amongst the tribes of the Sharkiyyah, and Saleh bin Ali used his best endeavours to turn this to account by attempting to induce the tribes to forget their inter tribal troubles and jealousies, and to combine against the Sultan. In this however he was unsuccessful.14 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Owing to tlie murder of a Rawahee by a Hadramee in September tlie peac&amp; of the Semail valley was again disturbed and fighting ensued between the Gha- frees and the Hinawis. Nothing further occurred in Oman to break the peace until Novembn- when Sheikh Badr bin Hilal bin Zahir of the Beni Hina was assassinated J Nezwah by the Beni Shikeyil, This occurrence induced His Highness the Sultan to send Suleiman bin Su- weilim, Wali of Dhofar, by the Sur road to Nez wah to attempt a reconciliation between the opposing factions, and to induce the Beni Hina in Gbafat to eva cuate Nezwah, and to obtain possession of this, the ancient capital of Oman, for the Sultan. With a view to bringing pressure to bear upon the Beni Hina Suleiman bin Suweilim obtained possession of Ghafat. This act was naturally viewed with apprehension by Saleh bin Ali and Saood bin Azzan who moved in the direction of Nezwah, but before their intrigues could be of any effect, Su leiman bin Suweilim had already obtained possession of Nezwah by the simple expedient of buying out the garrison. Having successfully accomplished bis mission, Suleiman bin Suweilim returned to Maskat at the end of February where he was received with great honour by the Sultan who attaches much importance to the town of Nezwah, and thinks that its possession will be of considerable political importance to him. The garrison now holding the town on behalf of the Sultan is said to number about thirty men. Dhofar. —In the month of November trouble was experienced in Dhofar The Wall of Dhofar, Suleiman bin Suweilim, was very unpopular locally owinff to his exactions and unjust government. He having unjustly ordered the imprisonment of a member of the A1 Kathir tribe, sixteen men of the tribe sud- denly appeared in Dhofar, attacked the Naib Wali and killed him together with some other persons, and obtained possession of the town. The Sultan accordingly despatched an expedition in December to Dhofar via Merbat. The expedition was under the command of Seyyid Seif bin Hamad and consisted of 180 men Up to the close of the year under report, this expedition had not moved from Merbat and no steps had been taken to regain possession of Dhofar. , Sohar. In the month of December reports were received that Seyyid Saood bin Azzan was making preparations to attack the town of Sohar in the Batineh Saood had collected a considerable force from amongst the Yal Saad, Mawasineh' Beni Saeed, Makabil and Beni Nairn tribes. The Sultan seeing the necessity for prompt action, despatched a force of 120 men under the command of Shaikh Hamood bin Nasir, in a steamer which happened to be in the harbour at the time The arrival of these reinforcements enabled the W T ali to repulse the attempt of baood to seize the town, and Saood was forced to retire.

The year 1895 unfortunately has not continued the improvement in trade which was begun in 1894, there being a falling olf in imports of over 24 and in exports of over 6 lakhs of rupees. The chief causes of this falling off were the depreciation of the kran (during the greater part of the year) both in relation to the pound sterling and to the rupee, large accumulations of stock of the previous year which failed to go off, locusts, high rates of transport, the general poverty throughout the Shiraz district caused by repeated bad years, and in the case of some exports, the fall in market prices. Among the imports an increase is shown in the case of arms and ammuni tion, candles, cotton goods, iron and kerosine-oil and a decrease in glassware, gold lace, indigo, copper, chinaware, sugar, tea, and woollen goods. In exports there is an increase in the case of dates, almonds, wheat, rose- water, shells, tobacco and carpets, and a decrease in horses, arms, cotton, gum, hides and skins, opium, silk, and wool. Details in each case are given below. During the year the Clan line of steamers discontinued running and two new lines commenced—the British and Colonial and the Messageries Maritimes. This latter line, which is French, is running entirely under orders of the Erench Gov- renment and the company are not even attempting, seemingly, to make it pay commercially. Preights have not been affected and continued steady throughout the year ranging from 22^. Qd. to 21s. A feature in the freight market was the change of the tonnage scale for bagged wheat, from 20 cwt. to 18 cwt. per ton. A German firm, Joh Werth &amp; Co., tried to start business in Bushire, but their methods seems not to have recommended themselves to the Persians and their venture has resulted in the bankruptcy of the firm and a strong prejudice against Germans among the Persian merchants here. Thou 01 !! 1895 cannot be considered even a fairly good year the prospects of 1896 are very much worse, and there seems every likelihood of its being one x)f the worst years on record. It opened badly and continued worse and most of the firms here tell me that there is nearly literally nothing doing. I mports. Arms and ^.--Theoretically this trade is prohibited by the Per sian Government, but like all similar prohibitions in Persia, this practically only substitutes an arbitrary impost for a fixed duty, and the large increase in the values shown are mainly due to higher valuation caused by the raising of this import by the local authorities, though there was also a slightly increased demand in Dashti and Dashtistan. Candles. There was a greater'demand for candles in Shiraz and Ispahan and the imports consequently slightly increased. Cotton goods. —In spite of a certain amount of accumulation at the end of last year owing to dearness of transport, the low prices in Manchester led to large imports of cotton goods during the year, and the large advance recorded last year has been still further increased this year by over 7 lakhs of rupees. Copper and iron. —Owing to the scarcity in Shiraz and dear exchange the imports of copper fell off by 3i lakhs of rupees, but iron showed a small increase. Chinaware.—l&amp;Q market was dull and the imports fell off by rather more than f of a lakh. iE18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Glass and glassware. —Prices fell in Shiraz and Ispahan and caused a decrease of J lakh. Gold lace and gold thread. —Importers have been importing inferior qualities, and prices have accordingly fallen 3 which accounts for the slight fall ing off in these articles. Indigo. —The depreciation of the kran affected this article and caused a decrease of over 2^ lakhs. Kerosine-oil. —There was an increased demand for this article and also a rise in prices which resulted in a slight increase. Sugar, loaf and soft. —There has been a falling off of 2 J lakhs in the case of loaf and also in that of moist sugar, the causes being the depreciation of the kran and a rise in prices in Europe. Tea. —The strong demand which there was last year was not kept up, chiefly owing to the deprecition of the kran and the year shows a decrease of J lakh. Thread and twist. —Cheap prices in Manchester caused a small increased importation. Woollen goods. —Dearness of exchange caused a falling off of over lakhs in the imports of this material. E xports. Horses. —Owing to the larger exportation of horses from Busrah and less demand for Persians in the Bombay market not so many horses were shipped this year as last. Arms and ammunidon.-JVhese are really only transhipped in Bushire, but are usually kept a short time before reshipping owing to restrictions on account of the nominal embargo on guns; these restrictions were slightly increased and more arms imported direct to Maskat and the other market's on the Arab coast usually fed from Bushire so that business fell off 89,000 rupees. Cotton. —The locusts again ravaged this crop which had besides been kept small from fear of thier re appearence, so that the decrease of over 1J lakhs is not surprising. Dates. —An increase of a few thousand rupees occurred in the export of dates, the increased demand being ia the Indian market. Almonds. —In this article also the Indian market showed an increased demand and nearly one lakh's worth more than last year were exported. Wheat. —In spite of embargoes the export of wheat made a further ad- vance of 8J lakhs owing chiefly to the greater demand in England and partly to some of the stocks which usually go to Busrah being diverted to Bushire by the better prices ruling there. Gum. —Large exports were made last year on an already glutted market, so that this year the demand was very small and a decrease of nearly | lakh is easily accounted for. Bides and skins. —The market in these articles, too, was much overstocked, and the exports this year consequently show an appreciable falling off of 78,000 rupees. Opium. —Prices in China were bad, which added to the depreciation of the kran, caused a heavy fall of 12^ lakhs in the amount exported during 1895. Hosewater.' m ' m *Aji increased demand in India caused a slightly increased exportation. Shells, —Next to none having been exported last year, European market recovered itself and exporters got rid of rather more than a lakh's worth more than last year.residency and maskat political agency for the year 1895-96. 19 Silk, —Poor markets in India caused a small falling off of some 3,000 rupees. Tobacco shows an increased export of over two lakhs worth, but this really represents the accumulated stocks of three years, which were shut up owing to the opposition of the mullahs to the Societe du Tombac referred to in the previous year's report. This opposition was broken down towards the end of last year and the societe were able to buy freely with the above result. Wool —The bad prices realised in 1894 and a scarcity of the article caused by reckless waste of ewes killed to procure astrachan caused a falling off of 1,19,000 rupees. Carpets. —The Syrian market showed an enormously increased demand which led to an increased exportation to the extent of over 5 lakhs. Miscellaneous. JExchange was bad throughout the year. It opened at 57| krans per found sterling and fell to 53 krans in the middle of the year and closed at 53^ krans. It was lightest in February at 58J krans and lowest in November at 52 krans. Mule-hire at the commencement of the year was 200 krans per 100 mans (775 tb), but fell in March to bO krans and again rose in April to 115 krans, closing at the end of the year at 75 krans. Freights remained steady throughout the year, varying only from 215. to 22s. 6d During the year shipowners changed the tonnage rate of bagged wheat from 20 cwt. to 18 cwt. per ton. The Clan line' which started running in 1894 discontinued doing so, but two new lines— cs the British and Colonial' and the 'Messageries Maritimes '— commenced to run. The &lt;e Messageries Maritimes ' only run one boat which they put on the run against their own will at the orders of their Government, and they do not seem to be anxious or likely to cause much competition against the older lines.

Paet i.—general summary. i.—oman-maskat coast. The current of events in the Sultanate has, on the whole, moved fairly smoothly during the year. Captain E. G. Beville, Political Agent, has drawn up the report which follows as Part II of this conipilation. In order to counteract the very general evasion of punitive tax imposed on the exported produce of the tribes, whose rebellion in 1895 had caused such serious losses to British Indian subjects, the Sultan considered the question of its more universal application, and finally decided, without weighing with sufficient care the probable effects of the measure, to extend it in a modified form, so as to include the produce of the loyal Ghafiri tribes. The ostensible grounds for this measure were solely that much of the produce, specially aimed at by the tax, had contrived to escape under cover of the trade of friendly tribes ; but it seems also possible that there was a hope of thus establishing an additional permanent source of revenue. Discontent naturally resulted, of which Sheikh Saleh bin Ali was prompt to take advantage, to promote a coali tion of the rival factions against the Sultan. In an unimportant chance con flict which ensued, this restless and turbulent Sheikh, who had been the moving spirit in the late rebellion, and who, despite his advanced age, still wielded vast influence in Oman, and was the most formidable and persistent opponent of the Sultan's authority, was killed. This event was a serious blow to the spirit of resistance, which was further weakened by timely concession in regard to the contemplated general tax, and w^hich thus became limited mainly to the Beni Ruaheh tribe. After needless delay, a somewhat ill-advised and ill- organised expedition was directed against this tribe, but resulted only in a further impoverishment of the Sultan's already strained resources. No improvement was secured in the unsatisfactory working of the tax on the original footing, as noticed in last year's report, and the available collec tions only amounted to some $ 20,000 for the period of twenty months, since its imposition in August 1895. A lease of the proceeds of the tax for $15,000 annually which was finally effected, though falling considerably short of the originally estimated yield, offers better prospects than those hitherto secured.6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Last year's report explained how the Sultan, after some hesitation and capriciousness, had finally decided to decline the aid of a war vessel, proffered by Government under certain conditions, towards the recovery of Dhofar A few months ago, however, His Highness' desire for the restoration of his authority in the revolted province was revived, and, notwithstanding the crip, pling of his finances which the futile attempt to coerce the Beni Uuaheh had entailed, an expedition was resolved upon. The Government of India assented, at His Highness' request, to give the aid of a man-of-war to support the Sultan's troops, upon the same terms as before, waiving, however, under cer tain conditions, the insistence upon the exclusion of Sheikh Suleiman bin Suwailim from the Waliship. Complete success attended this enterprise. The Political Agent proceeded to Dhofar in H. M. S. Cossack, and the Sultan deputed his brother Seyed Mahomed bin Turki to accompany the Resi dent in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. Captain Beville, conveying a letter from the Resident to the representatives of the rebels, explained to them, in a personal interview, the terms oifered, and gave them assurances, on the part of the Sultan, of pardon for the past, and just treatment in the future; negotia tions followed, and frequent communications passed, till the opposition was gradually overcome. Some time previously, the Maskat troops had been assem bled at the nearest to the coast of the small group of villages constituting Dhofar, off which H. M. S. Cossack was lying. Just before the expiry of the period granted by the ultimatum which had been communicated to the mal contents, the flags which had defiantly been flown were struck in sign of sub mission, and the satisfactory solution of a formal restoration of the Sultan's authority was thus secured without a resort to force. In pursuance of his cherished policy, the Sultan subsequently sent Sheikh Suleiman to replace the Wali who had been provisionally installed, but accord ing to the latest report, just after the close of the year, had again recalled him in consequence of a disturbance which it is hoped may prove insi^ni- fieant. Indications of an increased activity in the slave trade have been apparent, and it is to be feared that a large number of slaves have been carried frorn the African coast to Sur, and thence distributed inland and up the coasts of Oman and the Persian Gulf. In May the Political Agent, in the absence of any war vessel, personally effected the capture of an Arab Dhow with 28 slaves on board. This very creditable enterprise was successfully carried out by Captain Seville, with great promptitude and courage. Captures were also made by H. M. SS. Lapwing and Sphinx the two vessels seized by the latter being under French colours, the regularity or validity of which seemed open to some doubt, were made over to the French Vice-Consul. A group of Baluchis of the Batineh, who had for long kidnapped and sold Mekranis into slavery were brought to account, and after trial before the Political Agent and a representative of the Sultan, were punished with imprisonment. Trade has shown very satisfactory results. In dates there was an increase m the export of over a lakh of dollars in value, compared with the preceding year, notwilhstanding gloomy prospects at one time. The figures show a very large increase in the total volume of trade; allowance must, however, be made ior a great undervaluation of the arms imported in the year 1895-96, and making a further deduction on account of the movements of specie, there still remains a substantial improvement in the value of trade, of over three lakhs of dollars. In arms, even after the liberal allowance made for undervaluation in the previous year, it is evident that the trade has been considerably more active.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 7 2.—OMAN PIRATE COAST. In July the murder of one of their tribesmen in Eejeyreh caused o-reat resentment among the Kowasimis, and serious trouble was threatened. The excitement was not appeased by the death of one of the offending tribe who had been seized and confined, and the Sheikhs of Shargah, and Kasel Khymah as Kowasimi Chiefs, led an expedition against Eejeyreh. The feud was finally settled by the payment of blood-money to the relatives of the man who had been killed. About the same time a very calamitous fire occurred at Shargah ; 400 houses were destroyed, and the loss in property was estimated at $30,000. Fortunately only one life was lost. In November a severe storm caused the wreck of many of the boats of the pearl divers, many of whom perished with their boats. Disastrous fires occurred also at Abu Thabi and Debai. In the first of these, 170 houses were destroyed, but the loss and injury did not end here, for the Beni Yas tribe took advantage of the occasion to plunder the property which the owners contrived to rescue from the flames. At Debai the calamity was of a terrible character; half of that town, together with the whole of Dairah which adjoins it, were reported to have been completely wrecked, and the loss thus caused was very heavy. Owing to failure of rain the date crop around Shargah was very scanty. In the middle of the cold season, the assemblage of a considerable force by the Chief of Abu Thabi, with the alleged object of punishing the Beni Katb and Awamir, caused grave anxiety on the coast and especially at Shargah, where preparations for defence were made. The offending tribes had raided in Abu Thabi territory and killed some of the people, and had then sought shelter in the vicinity of the coast towns about Shargah. Resisfance was not, however, offered to the punitive expedition, and the Chief of the Beni Katb readily met the overtures made by Sheikh Zaid of Abu Thabi, and secured peace by engag ing to return the plundered property. These terms having been settled. Sheikh Zaid warned the Beni Katb that the more distant Manasir tribe from Katr, which in the preceding year had threatened the peace of their coast, had also prepared a punitive expedition against them. With this timely warning and some material assistance from Shargah, the Beni Katb and Awamir were enabled to meet their foes, who in spite of superior numbers were defeated with some loss in a sharp engagement which ensued. The Manasir were incensed against Sheikh Zaid, on account of the reverse thus inflicted on an expedition under taken, as they alleged, at his instigation. The balance of the fine noted in last year's report as having been imposed on the Chief of Abu Thabi, in consequence of extensive slave importations which had been allowed to be carried out at that place, was recovered on the occasion of a visit by H. M. S. Sphinx to the coast in June. It was reported that Sheikh Zaid had designs against the life of the Besidency Agent on the Pirate Coast, on account of the exposure by the Agent of these slaving operations. The charge was denied, but independent enquiries gave it some colour, and the commander of the man-of-war was requested to convey a suitable warning to the Sheikh. In June hostilities were reported between the people of Shaam and Rams, both tributary to Eas-el-Khymah. At the close of the year under report, the Sheikh of Ras-el-Khymah was stated to be seriously ill.8 ADMINISTBATION EEPOBT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 8.—BAHREIN. Beyond some not very serious signs of disaffection, which were the natural result of the failure of Sheikh Esa, Chief of Bahrein, to call the Amamireh to account for the act of certain of that tribe in killing Sultan bin Salamah referred.to in last year's report, the course of events in Bahrein has been on the whole smooth and peaceful. Ali, son of Sultan bin Salamah, supported by a Bedouin following, tried to incite some of the A1 bin Ali to aid him in reprisals against the Amamireh at the pearl banks. The Chief warned the A1 bin Ali against lending themselves to these schemes of vengeance, and the attempt generally failed. A part of the A1 bin Ali, however, sympathizing with feelings of their late Sheikh's son, and dissatisfied at the immunity permitted to those who had caused his death, went over to Katr where they joined Ali at Gbariyeh. They subsequently attacked and plundered a Bahrein boat, carrying off pearls and money amounting to over a thousand rupees. Sheikh Esa wisely refrained from interference with the departure of some A1 bin Ali families who after- wards desired to join the men who had seceded. In November the prospect of scarcity caused the Chief to prohibit the ex port of food-grains. About the same time the restoration of friendly relations with the Katr peninsula was notified, and a proclamation was made in the bazars that traffic with that district might be resumed. 4.—EL-HASA. A post runner with the Turkish mail from Katif for El-Hasa, was way laid and robbed in April 1896 by a party of the notoriously predatory A1 Murrah tribe. A pursuit by mounted troops from Hasa, resulted in a somewhat curious complication. Before the mounted party could overtake the A1 Murrah, the latter had^ in their turn, been attacked and plundered by a party of the Dowasir, and the troops encountering these last, whom they took to he the original robbers, fell upon them. The troops, however, lost two men killed and two wounded in the attack, and the Dowasir retreated with three horses which they captured. 5.—KATIF AND KATR. The appearance of small Turkish war vessels in these waters was rather more frequent and continued than has been usual. One of these arrived in May, and was followed by a second. It was reported that an offer was made of lurkish colors for the Katr boats engaged in pearling, but was declined by bhmkh Jasimbm Mobamed Iham, whose recollection of the misfortune to winch he had been brought by his reckless interference with, and menaces against, Babrem, at Turkish instigation, the previous year, was doubtless too tresh to encourage him to repose any confidence in such protection. He is said also for the same reason to have later requested the removal of the Turkish vessel stationed off Katr ostensibly, but quite unnecessarily, for the protection of tte boats engaged m pearling. In October the Turkish garrison of El-Bidaa was relieved by 400 troops conveyed there m the Turkish gunboat Zuhaf % f* i Th f -? 6111 H ? ar P ursued their habitual course of robbery.

This demandRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 9 was promptly complied with, and a threat from Sheikh Jasim of a general attack upon the Beni Hajar, failing their restoration of the plunder, had the desired effect. In December Haji Esa Effendi was replaced in the Kaim Makamship of Katif, wbich he had held for six months, by Mohamed Eakib Be 01 o * 6.—KOWAIT, Sheikhs Mohamed A1 Sabah and Jarrah, the former being the ruling Sheikh of Kowait, were assassinated about May by their brother Mubarec, who had failed to get their recognition of his claims on the joint family property. The sons of the murdered brothers effected their escape, and a report of the incident in due course reached, and is said to have caused some stir at, Constantinople, where pretensions to a sovereignty over Kowait appear in some sort to be maintained. Mubarec would appear to have found little difficulty in meeting the enquiries of the Turkish authorities, if any were made, and in satisfying their scruples in respect of his act, and the Porte is understood to have decided to ignore the case of assassination, and to recognize Mubarec's assumption of the Sheikhdom, 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The tracts included under this title have been seriously disturbed, and the year has witnessed much disorder and violence. At the opening of the year the Nizam-es-Sultaneh was continued in the Governor-Generalship which he had held, and remained in office until events compelled his recall some months later. Tribal conflicts were rife, and the irregular operations which the Governor- General had, at the close of the previous year, directed*against the Eeni Truf of the Howeizeh district, led to continued hostilities. These included the Beni Saleh who were also in arms against Syed Kaamahj. the instrument of the Governor-General, and the situation became more strained, till the influence of Sheikh Mizzal, Muez-es-Sultaneh, was invoked to procure a temporary truce, in order that the harvest might be gathered in. In November and December Sheikh Mizzal again intervened on these tribal conflicts being resumed. Complete disorder and revolt prevailed for some time in the tracts about Dizful and Shuster, the Arab tribes under various Sheikhs joining in a com mon resistance to Persian authority. In June the Bakhtiari II Khani, who had been employed by the Nizam- es-Sultaneh to coerce the insurgents, was defeated by them, and panic ensued in Shuster, where the people, seeing the Governor helpless, proposed, in concert with the rural population around, to pay their revenue to the Arabs, on the ground that the Government was powerless to afford protection. The Lurs helped to swell the tide of disorder, raiding the country towards Dizful, where the Governor's representative was quite unable to check them. Shuster and Pizful were themselves the scene of faction fights and colli sions with authority. At Ahwaz there was an affray between the people and the soldiery, who, at that place, have notoriously been the cause of frequent disturbance, rather than the supporters of order and authority. In fact the tale of anarchy, conflict, and violence, is well nigh continuous. In June a midnight attack, of a most brutal and murderous character, was committed upon Mr. Tanfield, an employe of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, by a Persian in his service, the final escape of the victim with life, though fearfully10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL mutilated, being almost miraculous. Such an incident might no doubt have occurred, even under the condition of a reasonably good government, and would in such case have demanded no exceptional treatment. A public and fanatical character was, however, given to the outrage, by the savagely inhuman popular demonstration of the following day, when a mob assailed the party conveying the wounded man to the steamer, with yells and the pelting of stones. Beyond taking the would-be murderer into custody, no sort of reparation was made by the local authority. Indeed it was only a month later, that under the stress of the notice attracted by this last savage outrage, the tardy payment of compensation, afforded the only reparation for an equally murderous but entirely public assault, by the State soldiery at Ahwaz, on a party of English gentlemen, eight months before. In this case the miscreants most actively guilty, though actually soldiers of a Persian regiment, entirely escaped punishment. It can hardly be doubted that the impunity previously permitted, contributed to the present outrage, at least in its public and popular aspect. After considerable delay the assailant was carried to Tehran, and there imprisoned, and the removal of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, and the Saad-ul-Mulk, Jus brother and Deputy from Arabistan, was ordered^ the former was shortly afterwards invested with high office at the capital. Nor was the tale of the rancorous and unchecked animosity of Shuster against the foreigner yet complete. In January of this year a strong mob after pillaging a caravan of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, in transit between the town and river, a few miles distant, attacked and completely sacked the office of Messrs. Hotz in the town. No redress for these outrages has yet been given. Ala-ed-Dowleh, who was appointed Governor-General in place of the Nizam- es-Sultaneh, after a very deliberate progress, arrived in Shuster in February 1897, that is to say, eight months after the violence of which his appointment was the ostensible consequence. With the help of Bakhtiari levies and some troops he had brought with him, he entered upon the coercion of the refractory town. The Shusteris, however, true to their traditions, vigorously resented the attempt to call the guilty to account, and despite the considerable armed support the Governor had, there was open defiance and revolt. Brisk firing was carried on for some days, the Government having the advantage with the help of a few cannon and the fort, and some of the truculent towns people were killed. Some sort of terms were then patched up, but, needless to say, these did not include the punishment even of the rioters guilty of the robbery of Messrs. Lynch's goods and the sack of Messrs. Hotz' office. Since then, the fanatics of Shuster have notoriously plumed themselves upon their successful repulse of the feebly attempted coercion by their Government, and have been encouraged furthermore to set up a claim to negotiate, on their own part, the terms of settlement with the injured British firms. It is an open secret that even such very moderate vigour as was exhibited by the Ala ed Dowleh did not commend itself to the Persian Government, and to this is probably in a measure due the indecisive result of his proceedings. At any rate, abandoning active measures, he resigned his office, and apparently, without awaiting the acceptance of his resignation by Government, left the country. His retirement was the signal for that also of his Deputy, the Shahab- es-Sultaneh with his Bakhtiari following, from Shuster, which was thus left without any representative of the Government authority, and with its bigoted populace triumphant, no European has yet been able to return to the town. The events of the year have undoubtedly been adverse to British trade and influence, in a region in which high hopes of their development have been entertained, and for this result^ broadly speaking, the Persian Government, byRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 11 its absolute neglect of the most ordinary obligations of a ruling power, and its apathy in the face of gross and unprovoked popular outrages, must be held to be entirely responsible. The embargo on the export of wheat, though not officially suspended, remained, as reported at the close of last year, virtually in abeyance. Its enforcement was again notified in July by the Governor-General, only to be followed immediately by an intimation from the Government, through Her Majesty s Legation, of its removal. The harvest gathered in the spring of 1896 was abundant, but prices nevertheless rose after a few months, the average for the year being more than double those for the preceding year } owing mainly to the short crop in Mesopotamia. Prospects for the coming harvest were doubtful, and in January of this year a general prohibition of the export of food-grains was notified, to take effect in March; it was, however, unnoticed by the local authorities on the Karun till April. Exceptionally high floods on the Tigris in the spring of 1896 caused a considerable rise of the Karun, and damaged the date crop, of which the yield was consequently poor; prices were therefore considerably higher than usual. Trade generally was satisfactory, the returns showing a large increase in the total volume over the previous year. Owing to the Turkish authorities having declined to recognize the Consular Agent appointed at Pao, in order to check the serious abuses which had grown up there in the illegal interference with British Indian vessels trading with Mohammerah, the despatch of a man-of-war to the river was found necessary in the autumn. This measure had the desired effect, and there is reason to believe that the Turkish claim to forcibly detain Indian vessels bound for a Persian port, and thus subject them to the extortions of unscru pulous officials, under cover of quarantine, tobacco regie, customs and other pretexts, will now be dropped. 8.—PARS AND PERSIAN COAST. The supreme and tragic event of the year for Fars, as for Persia in general, was the assassination of the Shah. Within a few days of the celebra tion of the Jubilee of the fiftieth year of his reign, the preparations for which were in a forward state. His Majesty Nasr-ud-Din Shah was shot on the 1st May at the shrine of Abdul Azim which he was in the habit of visiting, a few miles distant from Tehran, Death followed almost immediately. Moulah Reza, the assassin, declared himself a follower of Sheikh Jamal- ed-Din, a professed reformer, who after acquiring some notoriety in Persia, where bis restless proceedings had also brought him into trouble, had retired to Europe. Several years previously, Moulah Eeza had been a sufferer in the severe measures of repression, directed against certain persons regarded as being connected with the Babi movement, and had for long languished in prison. He was not without sympathizers in his last desperate act, and some were disposed to think that the enforcement of the extreme penalty would hardly be ventured upon in his case, a view which received some encouragement from the long delay in bringing him to execution, which was not carried out till the 12th August. Others there seemed to be, who ventured to indulge the hope that good might result from evil, and to cherish an idea, which how ever, was perhaps more common with foreigners, and outside the country, than among Persians themselves, that a happier era might dawn for Persia, and that the gigantic mass of corruption, with the universal misgovernment, oppression, disorder, and violence fostered under it, the growth of ages, but12 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL strengthened and systematized in a remarkable degree in the course of the recent long regime, might be, though not altogether swept away* yet sensibly diminished. Such hopes were doomed to disappointment. In Ears one of the earliest results following on the news of the Shah's death spreading, was a general outbreak of the Nomad tribes, commonly known as Turk and Arab^|which wandering through the tracts from the sea coast to the confines of the Ispahan province, sojourn according to the seasons in the warmer or cooler districts. These Nomads, in pursuance of what seemed very generally to be regarded as precedent, though a continuous reign of half a century, with its attendant circumstances of increased foreign intercourse, influence, and trade, might reasonably have been expected to have weakened any such precedent of a more barbarian age— were prompt to seize the occasion to inaugurate a high festival of license, rapine and violence, of which foreign and native commerce, and the unhappy rural population were impartially made the victims. I Far more ruinous was the injury inflicted on the miserable settled popu lation, hundreds of villages with their crops and herds being ruthlessly ravaged, and all the household goods of the wretched people plundered ; the consummation • of the ruin by fire even was not unknown.) An estimate of the approximate Toss thus suffered is not possible; it has been put at an enormous figure which is probably exaggerated, but there is no room for doubt that it has been terrible, far exceeding indeed the aggregate value of the merchandize robbed from caravans, both British and Native. It is only fair to add, that there are good grounds for believing, that some of the villages themselves have been by no means immaculate, and that there have been cases of villagers seizing the opportunity afforded by an epidemic of license, to vent their animosity on their neighbours, or even to secure for themselves a share of the profit in the plundering which was rampant. In Shiraz itself which, in recent years, has been constantly liable to turbulence, disorder and the other concomitants of maladministration, the crisis produced dangerous excitement, attended with attempts at violence. There was a general panic, shops were closed, private houses secured, and business completely stopped; the price of bread rose to three or four times the ordinary rate. j The measures adopted to meet the crisis were highly characteristic: certain f prisoners of the Arab tribes, who had been in confinement since long before the Shah s death, and whose offences, whatever they may have been, were abso lutely unconnected with current events, were brought out and publicly executed. But the special measure devised to strike terror among the disorderly, and to restore the popular confidence, was a revival of the old time-honoured practice of building malefactors alive into masonry. Accordingly the prison was indented upon for a further batch of the unfortunates before referred to, and ! these men, absolutely innocent as they necessarily were of all part or concern | in the disorder which it was desired to check, were built into five pillars, set up i along the broad approach to Shiraz on the Ispahan road. His Eoyal Highness Rukn-ed-Dowleh, brother of the late Shah, retained the Governor-Generalship of the Province at the annual spring settlement. His rule had, however, become intensely unpopular, and especially so after his misman agement of the crisis on the Shah's death, and the weakness combined with op pression of his subsequent proceedings in that connection, the general discon tent accordingly found expression in vigorous intrigues against him. A society with somewhat revolutionary aims, entitled the Mejlis-i-Mohteram, was formed of the principal ulema, landholders and merchants, the sanctuary of one of theRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 13 chief musjids of tbe town was resorted to, petitioDs were addressed to the new Shah and to the Government, and a general resort to the protection of the Re sident, who at the time was residing in Shiraz, was contemplated. In the end of July, orders, dismissing the Prince from the Governor-Generalship, were received amid universal satisfaction. The new Governor-General, Nazim-ed-Dowleh, did not, however, reach Shiraz, to assume the charge of the administration, till late in October. Pars fully maintained its normal character for unrest, quite apart from the consequences immediately following the Shah's death. Depredations and wan ton destruction by the Nomads were reported from the Niriz district, and plundering in the direction of Pasa before that event. General disorder was frequently complained of, the Nomads in the autumn migration were more law less than ever; in Pasa especially, crops were ravaged and the villages pillaged. In Niriz the people rose against the local Governor, and, having successfully encountered the troops sent to support him, turned him out and compelled him to flee to Shiraz. The province suffered again from the ravages of locusts, though the direct injury caused by this plague was lessened by the precaution which appears to have been largely adopted, of substituting the cultivation of barley for that of wheat, as barley ripening earlier than wheat, and before the power for mischief of the insects is fully developed, enjoys immunity from their attacks. While there was a scarcity of wheat therefore, the barley crop was reported to be abundant. A climax was reached in the evil results of the reckless inflation of the copper currency, which, with the hope presumably of an utterly illegitimate profit, had been permitted of recent years. The value of the copper &lt;e pul ' fell four-fold in Shiraz, or from 20 to 80 for the kran. The dislocation of the monetary system thus entailed had to be met by calling in a part of the copper and fixing the rate provisionally at 30 Shahis for the kran, and the consequent loss must have gone far to swallow up the profit of the original ill-advised mea sure of inflation. His Royal Highness Hissam-es-Sultaneh, who, on the fall of the Kowam- ul-Mulk at the close of the year 1895-96, was appointed to the Governorship of Bushire and the Gulf Ports, proceeded in a very leisurely manner to the seat of his authority, not arriving at Bushire till the middle of June. His earliest difficulty arose in connection with the transfers of certain of the coast districts and villages from the authority of Khan Ali Khan to that of Hyder Khan, a step which was strenuously resisted by the former, whose death however a few weeks later tended to smooth matters. In autumn Hyder Khan was afforded the aid of troops, with guns from the Persian gunboat Fersepolis to coerce his people and recover revenues, and later, further reinforcements followed. There was a collision between the opposing forces, and a deputation of the people then came in, and a compro mise with the authorities was effected. Hyder Khan being himself pressed for a payment under this compromise, a month later, presented his pistol at the delegate, who thereupon returned, followed by the troops and guns to Bushire. The Hissam-us-Sultaneh's rule was marked by an utter neglect of all the duties and obligations of his office. Tbe arrangement in its financial aspect, as regards the payment of the revenue, with which alone in this as in similar cases the central Government concerned itself, having been taken up by the mercantile coalition which had1 V e Q-r I \V I N ADMINISTflATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL ousted the Kowam-ul-mulk, the only incentive to the Governor to burden him self with public afPairs, largely disappeared. Power was accordingly wielded by others, with all the abuses and disadvantages which attach to authority covertly exercised. Nor was this the only evil, for His Highness Hissam-us Sultaneh's tenure of office was itself constantly in jeopardy, the result of financial difficulties, with the Government, and in December he officially notified his resignation to the Residency, and declined to transact business. The difficulty not only of conducting official business, but of securing redress in cases urgently demanding it, was perhaps never more acutely felt than during this regime; irresponsible secretly exercised influence aggravated the malpractice and abuse ordinarily existing, and the ill results were exhibited in many directions. Loud complaints were made by the mail steamer agents of extreme diffi. culty and delay in the discharge of cargo in September, followed by a ioint protest by all the British firms against the injury thus suffered. N um . berless appeals to the Governor on this and other subjects produced no result^ and the steamer agents' complaints were constantly repeated, till aggravation of the evil called forth another joint remonstrance from the mercantile com munity in March. No reason for this scandal could be assigned, other than the malpractice and rapacity of those exercising veiled authority, and the utter indifference of the Governor, In January the Indo-European Telegraph Station at Reshire, 5 miles from Bushire, was the scene of a serious mob outrage. After some premonitory menaces, which, as usual, were utterly disregarded by the local authority, a mob consisting of several hundreds, of whom many were armed with guns, assembled close to the buildings, and, sending an ultimatum threatening death to all who resisted, rushed to the destruction of the bench marks of the recentlv completed longitude operations, close to the main building. Resistance was out of the question, and the mob, after effecting the wreck of these marks, pro ceeded to the tidal observatory by the sea, where they similarly destroyed the tidal level record. The outrage which was instigated by the Syeds was in pur suance of a vulgar superstition, that these record marks had been the cause of the deficient rainfall. A certain number of ignorant villagers were caught and punished, but the ringleader Syeds were permitted to evade all punish ment, and the Governor showed no disposition to afc ord adequate redress for the gross outrage, affront, and danger which had been wantonly caused. It was only after his departure, and the close of the year that the mutilated scientific records were formally replaced. In the early cold weather the appearance of the plague at Bombay neces sitated the adoption of quarantine precautions. The resources of the Persian Government were of course quite unequal to the inauguration of even partially efficient measures, and the whole onus according to precedent, devolved on this Residency. But though the Government was profuse in assurances, and prompt in the delegation of ostensibly full authority, confusion and contradic tion marked the orders issued by the central to the local authorities, of which the latter took the fullest advantage, to thwart the measures of the Residency Surgeon and to cause vexatious annoyances. It was a long and difficult task to evolve order out of the chaos of conflicting Persian orders, and much credit is due to the Residency Surgeon and his subordinate for the success achieved. Quarantine was eventually placed on a satisfactory and efficient footing at Bunder Abbas, Lingah, and Mohammerah, for which the services of Assistant Surgeons were lent by the Government of India, as well as at Bushire. Laristan was the scene of much disorder. Sheikh Ibrahim, aforetime Governor of Tahiri, attacked the place with his followers, but lost heavily andRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. was repulsed. The Baharloos and Nomad Arab tribes also attacked Jam and spread violence and rapine throughout the district. An attack on Lingah was threatened, and some fears appear to have been felt even at Bunder Abbas. Kishm Island was visited by a terrible calamity. On the night of the 11th January an earthquake laid the town in ruins, only two musjids and three or four other buildings being left standing. Sixteen hundred bodies were reported to have been recovered from the ruins, besides those of strangers which were not identi- fied. Shocks were felt as far as Lingah to the west, and on the neighbouring Island of Larak where some loss of life was also reported. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN AND MEKRAN. Disorder was rife in the Kerman districts in May and June, there being continuous reports of the depredations of the Baharloo and other Arab tribes, who plundered the country extensively. The Samsam-es-Sultaneh was des patched by the Shah to endeavour to check these raids. Further eastward, towards the Indian frontier and the sea coast, affairs were in almost worse confusion, and Persian authority more hopelessly discre dited than in other parts even of Persia. The feuds so constantly liable to occur on the border, broke out between the Askanisof Pishinand the Binds of Mand. Attacks and reprisals were made by both sides; some men were killed and camels and flocks raided. At Charbar there was serious and long-continued trouble regarding rival claims to the subsidies paid by the Telegraph Department, in consideration of protection for their land line. The superior provincial authority at Bampur, being itself at one time contested and in doubt, the subordinate local Chiefs who are the recipients of the Telegraph subsidies, were in conflict in regard to the title to the payments as derived from one or other of the contending superiors. The position was by no means an easy one for the Telegraph Superintendent, on whom the rival demands were constantly pressed with insolent menace, and even a resort to violence against the persons and property of British Indian traders. Some of these were seriously wounded, in the course of one of these importunate attempts to secure payment of the Dashtiyari subsidy in August. It became necessary to despatch H. M. S. Sphinx to Oharbar to prevent a repetition of this violence, but an appeal through Her Majesty's Legation to the Government at Tehran only elicited the fact of the utter powerlessness of the State authority in these regions. The matter was shortly afterwards settled for the time, by payment for the half-year up to June 1896, being made to Mohamed Khan, one of the claimants, whose title seemed to be the most in order. In February of 1897 there was a recrudes cence of the same dispute, and it was necessary, in order to avoid the risk of mischief, to make the next payment to another candidate, who appeared to have substantial support. In January the Resident visited Charbar in the H. I. M. S. Lawrence at the desire of His Majesty's Minister, in the hope of being able to bring some influence to bear on the turbulent local Chiefs, who were practically quite beyond the control of the Persian Government. None of these leaders were, however, found at Charbar at the time of the visit, and an interview was thus impossible. Independently of the question of the claims to the Telegraph subsidies, the position in South Eastern Persia was deplorable, hardly a vestige of regularly constituted authority being discernible. A general belief in the fulfilment of an old prophecy, to the effect that the dynasty would end with the late Shah, was reported to prevail, and this belief was said to be confirmed in the minds of the people by the absence of any ruler16 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL of weight or position at Karman, from which the Firman Firma, a more than usually vigorous Persian Administrator, had, soon after the Shah's death, be taken himself to the capital. The popular voice accordingly affirmed that the fulfilment of the prophecy had come, and that no Shah in fact existed. This same belief was curiously heard of later, as prevailing around Jask also. The effects of uncertain and divided authority, and the powerlessness of the Government, were aggravated by gross oppression.. Discontent, of which the indications had at intervals long been apparent, became most acute, and found voice in an urgent appeal by Sirdar Hussain Khan of Geh to the Shah, through the British, whose intercession with His Majesty he invoked. He declared that the country was being ruined by the harsh oppression of the Sirteep Zain-ul-Abadin Khan and his brother Ibrahim Khau, and that with their continuance in power, anarchy must continue to desolate it. The same Sirdar had previously put forward a plea for British annexation and protec tion. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. An increased activity in the slave trade has already been commented upon above. This unhappy result is at least in part, indeed it may perhaps more truly be said, largely due, to the facilities afforded by a more liberal grant of the French flag, to Oman Dhows trading with the west coast of Africa; and not only has the flag appeared more frequently in Sur, but it has been seen also over buglahs of the Batineh Coast. Several minor slave transactions of a local and unimportant character came to light. In one of these a small party of Baluch slaves, for the most part boys, who had probably been kidnapped, were shipped at Wadam on the Batineh Coast, a place of evil repute in this connection—for Lingah. An adult of the party there made his escape, and the remainder were carried to Debay, where two more after escaping fell into the hands of the Arabs of Khan, a dependency of Shargah. These were recovered and sent to Maskat, where on the clue furnished by Feroz's evidence proceedings were taken result ing in the conviction of a large number of slave dealers. An attempt at re-enslavement of a liberated slave on the Persian coast was reported, he was recovered after some months at Lingah, and handed over to the Commander of H. M. S. Sphinx, Six slaves who, after effecting their escape from Shargah, had managed to reach the Telegraph Station at Jask, were brought to Bushire, and being there liberated were conveyed to Maskat at their own desire. A more serious case was the kidnapping of-17 men on the South Arabian Coast, by an armed party of the Yal Saad, who carried them by boat to the Batineh Coast, and thence sent them by land to the Pirate Coast or the in terior. This act was committed in February 1896, but the facts did not come to light till the beginning of the year under report, on the information of one of the slaves who had escaped. The Sheikh of the Yal Saad who was directly implicated was imprisoned by the Sultan, and later died in confinement. Only one other of the party was traced in the possession of the Bedouin, and as it was impossible to obtain his freedom without ransom, the disbursement of the sum required was sanctioned by Government. 11.—PIRACY. Some piracies were committed by the Beni Hajar robber tribe in Bahrein waters.besidenct and maskat political agency for the year 1896-97. 17 Vigorous action for the suppression of piracy at tlie mouth of the Shat-el- Arab was pressed on the Turkish and Persian authorities jointly by the British Consular authorities at Busreh and Mohammerah atthe urgent instance of the British Officers, both sides, while still maintaining each that the liabi lity rested on the other, agreed to adopt measures of prevention, by appointing posts along the river, where vessels should anchor at night under adequate protection, and by arranging for the nightly patrol of the river by armed boats. A visit of inspection to certain of these posts was made by the British Consuls, in company with Sheikh Mizzal, the Perso^Arab Governor of Mohammerah. The effect of these measures was very satisfactory, and the British Indian boats visiting the river for their usual cargo of dates in autumn enjoyed immunity from the danger to which they had previously been exposed. In April of 1896 a bold piracy was committed on a boat from Koweit, off the mouth of the river, the Nakhuda being killed, two traders wounded, and some 3,000 rupees worth of goods and cash being plundered. In the ' Harjpasa' piracy, noted in last year's report, no satisfactory result has been reached, notwithstanding the urgent pressure brought to bear on Sheikh Mizzal, by Her Majesty's Vice-Consul at Mohammerah. The Sheikh, while promising to take effective action in respect of certain suspected persons, made only one arrest, and showed himself distinctly unwill ing to take the vigorous action necessary to bring the guilty to justice. 12.—ROYAL NAVY. H. M. S. Lapwing was on the Persian Gulf station at the opening of the year under report, and was relieved in May by H. M. S. Sphinx, In the autumn H. M. S. Lapwing was stationed in the Shat-el-Arab, and was later relieved by H. M. S. Redbreast 9 which finally left the Gulf at the close of the official year. IS.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. There was no change in the personnel of the Eesidency during the year. Lieutenant C. Ducat, First Assistant to the Resident, was absent on two months' privilege leave, from the 14th November, his duties being conducted by Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Extra Assistant, who in turn obtained three months' privilege leave on the 2nd Pebruary. Bushire ; 10th June 1897. P. A. WILSON, Colonel, Political Resident, ^Persian Gulf,18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL PART II.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MASKAT POLITI CAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. The past year was one of considerable importance to the Sultan, death by violence having removed the bitterest opponent the rulers of Maskat have had for the past 25 years. Since the imposition of the punitive tax upon the Hinawi in August 189D, Sheikh Saleh-bin-Ali al Harthi had used his best endeavours to turn this circumstance to account. In May 1898, Saleh found his opportunity. The Sultan, partly with a view to carrying out the wishes of the Government of India in regard to the completion of the indemnity to British subjects for losses incurred, within the period fixed, and which he considered impossible upon the basis originally decided upon, and also partly with a view to reple nishing his empty exchequer, decided to impose a tax upon the produce of the Ghafiris as well as upon that already imposed upon the rebel Hinawi. Saleh at once seized the opportunity thus offered him and effected a coalition between the Beni Ruaheh (Hinawi) and a portion of the Beni Jabir (Ghafiri), and proceeded to attack Seja which was held by the Beni Hadram and by such of the Jabir as remained faithful to His Highness the Sultan. Saleh himself, though upwards of 75 years of age, assumed command of the allied tribes. During one of the petty skirmishes that ensued, a stray bullet deprived 'the rebels of their leader, and ended the life of the bitterest and the most able opponent of the ruling house. Had the Sultan at once seized the opportunity the death of this famous leader gave him, and attacked the rebels, there seems to be no doubt but that he would have been successful. Saleh was killed early in September, and it was not until late in October that the Sultan with a force of about 7,000 men left for the interior. As soon as the Sultan heard of the opposition that would be raised against the increase in taxation, he cancelled the orders imposing a tax upon the produce of the Ghaflris, and he thus was able to detach the Beni Jabir from the coalition consisting principally of the Beni Ruaheh. The long delay that took place prior to a start enabled the Beni Ruaheh to overcome their first panic at the loss of their leader, and they were accordingly in a position to oppose the Sultan's advance. The difference between the opposing forces was that the Beni Ruaheh were fighting for their homes, whereas the Sultan's troops were mercenaries, who like most Omani Arabs show extreme valour so long as they receive their pay and are not within striking distance of the enemy. As a natural result of relying only upon such troops, the Sultan at the critical moment was deserted by most of the Sheikhs who had, though really friendly to the enemy, professed allegiance to His Highness, and be returned to Maskat, without having accomplished anything beyond the expenditure of about $60,000. Owing to a dispute between two factions in Nakhl, there appeared to be fears of an outbreak in that district in the month of June. The Sultan accompanied by a few hundred men proceeded to the place and was able to restore order without further trouble. With the above exceptions, and the usual petty intertribal disputes which appear to be a necessity of existence in Oman, the country was not in a disturbed state during the year under report. At the close of the previous year, the Sultan's rule had ceased in Dhofar, although the Shanafareh were favourable to him, and Merbat was still garrisoned by His Highness' men.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 19 In the month of January of the present year, the Sultan, having decided to attempt to regain possession of his lost province, solicited the assistance of a British vessel of war with a view to enable him to carry out his design. Government having agreed conditionally to this request, the Political Resident, together with His Highness Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Turki and Seyyid Hamed bin-Nasir, left for Dhofar in the Indian Government vessel Lawrence. H. M. S. Cossack which had been placed at the disposal of Government for the purpose also proceeded to Dhofar. The Sultan's troops numbering about 400 men advanced to Hafa inhabited by the friendly Shanafareh, and after parleying with the rebels for some days, Seyyid Mahomed-bin-Turki, actin 0 * upon the advice of Colonel Wilson, accepted the submission of the A1 Kathir upon the terms offered, and the Turkish flags which the rebels had hoisted were hauled down, and various forts in their possession were handed over to the Sultan's troops. Seyyid Hamed-bin-Nasir was left as Governor temporarily until Sheikh Suleiman-bin-Suweilim, the Sultan's nominee, arrived. Without recourse to absolute force the Sultan thus regained one of his outlying provinces which had been in a state of rebellion for some eighteen months. The proceeds of this tax, which His Highness imposed upon those tribes responsible for the losses incurred bv Punitive Tax on the Rebel tribes. - a * i i . .British and other foreign subjects during the rebellion in 1895, has not, for various causes, reached the estimate which was originally formed. During the past year a sum of about $20,000, repre senting 20 months' collection, was paid to the Consulate for distribution amongst the claimants. With a view to obtaining better results the contract for tbe collection of the tax has been farmed out for a sum of $15,000 per annum, and it appears therefore that a period of five years will be requisite since its first imposition for the proceeds of the tax to meet all claims. The Political Resident visited Maskat in January in order to discuss g i various questions with the Sultan. He again visited Maskat in March upon the occasion of the Dhofar expedition. Owing to the prevalence of the plague in Bombay and Karachi, His High ness decided to impose a quarantine of nine days against these ports. Up to the time of writing this measure has had the effect of keeping the disease out of the country. Maskat was visited during the year under report by Her Majesty's ships Brisk, Lapwing, Sphinx, Bedhreast and Cossack. Foreign navies were represented by the French gunboat Surprise. In the month of May, there being no vessel of war upon the station, the d Political Agent had to personally seize a slave vessel with 28 slaves on board when some little distance off Maskat. A few days afterwards, H. M. S. Lapwing arrived and within a few hours of her arrival was enabled to seize a slave vessel with 14 slaves on board. Three days after the first capture, above noted, a further capture of a vessel with two row-slaves was made by the Sultan at Jisser, upon information given to His Highness by the Consulate. In September of the year under report, H. M. S. Sphinx brought in two vessels flying French colours, for the purpose of verification of their colours by the French Consulate here. The right of the vessels to their colours was found to be correct, but upon examination by the French authority, the vessels were found to have about 175 slaves on board, and were accordingly detained.V 20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL After carrying on their trade for several years, a gang of Baluchis resident in the Batineh, who were in the habit of kidnapping Mekrani Baluchis and selling them as slaves on the Pirate Coast, were seized in December. A Court consisting of Seyyid Badr-bin-Seif, on behalf of the Sultan, and the Political Agent, tried the accused upon 34 charges of slave dealing. The accused with one exception were found guilty, and the Sultan gave them various terms of imprisonment and also imposed fines upon them. During the year under report, 74i fugitive slaves took refuge in the Con. sulate. Of these, 70 were liberated and 4 dismissed not being entitled to free dom under the stipulations of the Treaty of 1873. Colonel Sadler was relieved by Captain Beville on 16th April, and the latter officer continued to hold charge of the Political Agency and Consulate until the close of the year. Official Changes. F. G. BEVILLE, Political Agent and II* B, MSs Consult Maskat,RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1896-97. 21 P ART IV.—TRADE. The total trade of Maskat for the year 1896-97 is returned at $4,788,800 against $3,708,210 of the previous year, making an increase for the year of $1,080,590. Of this increase, however, a sum of at least $450,000 must be deducted as the under-estimated price of arms and ammunition imported in the year 1895-96, It is to the advantage of the Customs authorities to under-estimate the returns of imports, as the customs are farmed. In the present year, how ever, iodependent information has been obtained as to the quantities of arms and ammunition imported, and hence the necessary correction in the figures of the year previous. The total increase of trade for the year 1896-97 may, there fore, be estimated at $630,590. Of this gain, imports are responsible for $141,000 and exports for $490,000. The imports, however, exceed the exports by $970,200, and it would appear, therefore, that the balance of trade is against the country to this extent. This, however, is not the case, for, owing to its situation, Maskat serves as the port of entry for certain goods, arms in particular, which are destined for the Arab Coast and other parts of the Persian Gulf. Of the eight lakhs worth of arms which arrived during the past year, at least six lakhs were for other countries, which have not proper facilities for importing arms direct. The payment of these arms is made in direct export from these places, as a reference to the Bushire Residency Returns for the Arab Coast will show. In addition to the above, about a lakh and a half worth of rice and piece goods, etc., are also re-exported to these places, and hence of the deficit of $970,000, about $750,000 have been accounted for. The balance remaining appears to be the deficit against the country, which from the returns appears to be made up in specie payments. Of the total increase of $630,000 shown, imports give a net gain of $141,000, made up as follows :— Increase. Arms . • Cereals • Oils Ghee • • Piece goods .

Instead, therefore, of grain being exported, there was not sufficient to meet the require ments of the countries bordering on the Gulf, and large importations of food-stuffs have taken place during the year under report. The famine in India prevented mucb grain coming from there, and Burma has been the chief source of supply, quantities of rice being imported from that country. In spite of heavy importations, prices went very high, and the comparative statement given in the margin will show that food-stuffs have cost much more during the past twelve months than they did in the famine years of 1871-72. It is a proof of the increase in prosperity of Bushire during the past 25 years, that in spite of these high rates there has not been actual famine, and that it has not been necessary to provide public relief. At one time, however, things looked very bad; the rains did not come as early as usual, and, though there was a fall of some 2*25 inches in December and early part of January, it ceased entirely after the 16th of the latter month. The rain held off, and the crops were getting yellow and burnt up, while there was no prospect of fodder for cattle, horses, and mules. Early in March the outlook was exceed ingly gloomy; but good falls of rain, which have, I am glad to say, been general, on the 9th and again on the 21st March and subsequent days, revived the dying crops, and brought up the grass, sufficiently to ensure a fairly good harvest throughout the south of Persia. Less land had been sown than in ordinary years, and I am doubtful if there will be much grain for export; but there will, I am informed, be sufficient to meet local requirements. The rain was too late to do much good in Persian Baluchistan, and there will certainly be much suffering there, as it is the third bad harvest in succession. The fail ing of the crops during the past three years has undoubtedly affected trade. When grain was largely exported, imports rose proportionately, and they have languished during the recent bad years. It is to be hoped, however, that the worst is now over, and that a period of prosperity is about to commence. If the rainfall during the coming year is normal, it is probable that there will be surplus grain for exportation, and that the money thus obtained will be employed to increase imports.

The arrangements have been in the charge of Surgeon-Captain P. Lumsden, who has carried out his difficult duties in a thoroughly satisfactory manner. Quarantine interferes with trade, and with the comfort of individuals, and the efforts to evade it are unceasing. Dr. Lumsden and those working under him deserve much credit for the manner in which they have enforced the regulations laid down by the Venice Con ference, in the face of much opposition. I am glad to say that up to the end of the year under report no case of plague has occurred in the Persian Gulf or at Maskat. In May 1897 the Turkish Government deputed two Turkish doctors to Kowait, to inspect the quarantine arrangements between Maskat and that place. Anniversary of Her Majesty's accession. —The anniversary of the sixtieth year of the accession of Her Most Gracious Majesty the Queen-Empress was duly celebrated at Bushire, Maskat, Mohammerah, Shiraz and other places on the 22nd June 1897. Demand of Persian garrison for arrears of pay and rations. —In July the Persian garrison at Bushire took ' Bust ' under the Residency flagstaff, and demanded our assistance in obtaining arrears of pay which had not, so they stated, been paid for five months. After a time some arrangement was arrived at, and the men returned to their own quarters. Mail rohheries. —There was some unrest among the tribes between Shiraz and Bushire during the past year, and several robberies occurred on the trade route. Among others was the robbery of the Legation Kossid with despatches for Bushire, who was attacked at a defile, called the Tang-i-Turkan, about 20 miles south of Kazeroon. The bags were taken, and some of the contents were destroyed, the remainder being recovered. The day after this occurrence the Persian post was also robbed, and the Commandant of the body-guard of the Governor-General of Pars was sent with a small force to arrest the robbers. The action taken by this official is instructive. It is stated that he and his followers looted the surrounding villages to the extent of 10,000 to mans, about R30,000, but failed to arrest the real culprits, and compensation has only lately been awarded, since I came to Shiraz and took up the matter with the Governor-General. Consular changes.—In November 1897 Dr. Robert Hauck, the newly appointed Consul for Germany, arrived at Bushire. This appointment indicates the intention of Germany to extend trade relations in the Gulf; but at present there cannot be much consular work for a German representative. In June 1897 M. Perrand arrived as Prench Vice-Consul at Bushire. He remained till the end of October, when he left for Siam. He was succeeded by M. Bryois, who took over charge of the Consulate in Pebruary 1898. My relations with all these gentlemen, and also with Mr. Vanderzee, the Consul for the Netherlands, have been most cordial and friendly. Changes in the Governorship of Bushire. —There have been numerous changes in the personnel of the Governor of Bushire. When I arrived the Iktedar-us-Sultan was Governor; but in September he was deposed, and an interregnum ensued, during which the Amir Panj, or Commander of the troops, held charge. This official has since died, when employed against the murder- ers of Mr. Graves in Persian Baluchistan. It was then stated that the Mujir- us-Sultaneh would have the post; but, as it was discovered that he is a near relation of the Saad-ul-Mulk and Nizam-us-Sultaneh, the brothers, who had failed so conspicuously to protect British interests in 1896 when Messrs. Taylor and Tanfield were attacked (vide Administration Reports for 1895-96 and 1896-97), and who had in consequence been declared ineligible for employment in Southern Persia, the appointment was annulled, and the Mujir-us-Sultaneh returned to Tehran from Shiraz, whidb he had reached on his way to Bushire, Soon after it was announced that His Highness the Pirman Pirma had obtained the Governor-Generalship of Pars, the Nazim-ud-Dowleh returning to Tehran; and that the Kawam-ul-Mulk had obtained the Governorship of Bushire, deputing his son the Itemad-us-Sultan, better known as the Beglar Begi, to be ■EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. ? his deputy. The Itemad-us-Snltan arrived at Bushire in November 1897, and resigned the post in February 1898. His term of office was hardly a success. The enforcement of the prohibition against import of arms into Persia, and the confiscation of those already in the place, affected the profits he expected to have made, and induced him to resign. On the other hand, his rule was weak and ineffective, and crimes of a violent nature became prevalent. These matters will, however, be dealt with separately. On the departure of the Beglar Begi, the Malik-ut-Tujar held charge for a short time, and, in March 1898, the Imad-i-Nizam, a servant of the Pirman Eirma, came to Bushire as Governor. He has in turn been succeeded, first, by the Saeed-us-Sultan, and, since, by the Muzuffur-i-Nizam, who has lately been removed. As the Iktedar-us-Sultan, the Governor, when I reached Bushire in June 1897, had only relieved the Hissam-us-Sultaneh in March 1897, it will be seen that there have been no less than eight changes in the Governorship of Bushire during a period of fifteen months. This cannot be advantageous for the Government of the place, from a Persian point of view, and certainly renders it difficult for the representatives of Her Majesty's Government to look after the interests of British subjects. A Governor takes the Government on contract, and does his utmost to avoid meeting any obligations—such as paying compensation for damage done to subjects of foreign powers, etc., which the contract entails. He endeavours to put off complying with any demands that may be made on him during his incumbency of office, and on his departure he takes all records away ; so that his successor is able to express his entire inability, from a want of knowledge, to deal with cases which have occurred in the time of his pre decessor. The Persian Government, if a reference is made to them, generally reply that the Governor who held the contract at the time of the occurrences is responsible for payment, and refer to him. But as he has left, and took care not to pay when he was in office and could be approached, the settlement of any claim generally takes a long time. Something may be done by personal intervention with the Governor for the time being ; but to make this effectual it is necessary that the British Resident should have more personal knowledge of each individual Governor than is possible when such rapid changes go on, and it is to be hoped that some more permanent arrangement for the Governor ship of Bushire may be made in future, 2.—OMAN—MASKAT COAST. Nothing of special importance has occurred at Maskat during the past year. Captain Beville was Political Agent at the beginning of the year, and went to India on leave, on the 10th June, at the same time that I relieved Colonel Wilson. Captain Beville obtained an appointment in India, and did not return to Maskat at the end of his leave. Surgeon-Lieu tenant-Colonel Jayakar held charge of the Political Agency from the departure of Captain Beville to the arrival of Major Pagan on the 15th September. I visited Maskat twice during the year under report, first in June 1897, when I was on my way to Bushire, and again in January 1898. On the first occasion I did not land, as there was at the time quarantine against arrivals from Karachi; but at the second visit I spent some days on shore, and had several interviews with His Highness the Sultan. Major Eagan, the Political Agent, has drawn up a report on Maskat affairs for the past year, which accompanies as Part II of this compilation, and as it contains an account of everything of importance that has occurred, it seems unnecessary to recapitulate his observations here. 3.—OMAN —PIRATE COAST. In September a severe storm caused the loss of many lives at the pearl fisheries, and it is reported that about 100 fishing boats were wrecked. There has been a rise in the price of pearls owing to the fact that the take was less than usual. The reason for this has not yet been given. There was some alarm felt in consequence of the movement of the Chief of Abu Dthabi; but nothing important occurred.8 ADMINISTRATION EE PORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL During the summer several fires broke out at Debaye, and the people became alarmed, fearing a repetition of the disastrous conflagrations which had occurred during the previous year,, A slave woman was, however, caught in the act of firing a house, and confessed that she was doing it at the instigation of a relation of the Chief. She was executed for this crime, and another woman, who was afterwards detected, was also suitably punished. Small-pox was very prevalent on this coast during a portion of the year. In April 1897, the Mutaserrif of El-Hasa invited the people on the Katr Coast to join in a general contribution collected on behalf of the Turkish Government towards the expenses of the Turko-Greek war; but Sheikh Jasim bin Thani replied that the people could not afford to pay anything towards it. 4.—BAHREIN. There have been no changes of importance at Bahrein during the past twelve months. Sheikh Esa has been the Chief, and has continued to enjoy good health. In November he sent his son, Sheikh Hamed, to visit me at Bushire, and in February I visited the islands, remaining there a few days. In May 1897, the Chief appointed Sheikh Hamed to be Governor of Maharrak, and during my visit to Bahrein he expressed a wish that the British Government would recognise him as his successor, whenever his own death occurs. In September I deputed Mr. Prideaux, the First Assistant Resident, and Mr, Gaskin, Extra Assistant, to visit Bahrein and enquire into various complaints against the British Agent, Agha Muhammad Rahim. There were also complaints of high-handed conduct on the part of some of the Sheikh's officials, which Mr. Prideaux went into, and which the Sheikh disposed of afterwards at my request in a satisfactory manner by punishing the parties concerned. In January, the Sheikh placed an embargo on the large stocks of arms and ammunition at Bahrein, belonging to Messrs. Fracis Times, an English firm trading in the Persian Gulf, who had employed Agha Muhammad Bahim as an agent. The action of the Sheikh in this matter, and the disposal of the arms in question, are still under enquiry. 5.—NEJD. Muhammad Ibn Eashid, the Amir of Jebel Shammar, died on the 3rd December 1897, after nominating his nephew as his successor. This was after wards duly accepted by all the Sheikhs and leading men of Nejd. 6.—KOWAIT. Sheikh Mubarek, whose assassination of his brothers is mentioned in last year's report, continued to be ruler of Kowait, and has on various occasions received British officers in a friendly manner. Closer relations with the Sheikh of Kowait appear desirable. The port is a good one, and its situation may make it one of the most important places in the Persian Gulf in the near future. There were constant rumours of intended attacks on Kowait by the sons^ of the murdered brothers of Sheikh Mubarek, who were said to have obtained the assistance of various important Arab Sheikhs. Nothing important occurred, however, and Sheikh Mubarek assured the British officers who saw him, that he is strong enough to resist all attacks. The concentration of a large Turkish force at Basrah at the close of 1897, was supposed to be aimed at Kowait; but if this was the original intention the design was not carried out. 7.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. The great event ot the year in Mohammerah has been the murder of Sheikh Mizzal Khan bin Haji Jaber, the well-known Arab ruler of Arabistan. He was assassinated on the 3rd June, when landing from his boat opposite his own residence at Falin, The actual murderers were three negroes, who areBESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1897-98. 9 supposed to have been instigated to commit the crime by the Sheikh's cousin, Selman bin Mansur, the Chief of the Mohaisin tribe. It was feared at first that the sudden death of Sheikh Mizzal would give rise to trouble; but nothing particular has occurred. The Governorship of Mohammerah and of the tribes was assumed by Sheikh Mizzal's brother, Sheikh Khazal, after tribal election, which has subsequently been confirmed by the Persian Government; and he appears to have conducted the Government in a proper manner, avoiding difficult situations, which at one time seemed likely to arise. The Ala-ud-Dowleh relieved Haji Il-Khani in February 1897, and on his arrival at Shushter proceeded to arrest several men, who had been engaged in the attacks on the premises and caravans of British firms. A general rising ensued, and would probably have ended badly, but for the timely arrival of some 3,000 Bakhtiaris. With their assistance, the Governor-General was able to subdue the revolt, after twenty days' desultory fighting, in which 25 of the rioters and 5 of the Governor's men are said to have been killed. Ala-ud-Dowleh was succeeded by Saad-us-Sultaneh, Sirdar Akram, who has held the post for the rest of the year. An embargo was put on the export of cereals from Arabistan, as the harvest there had been so bad. This affected British firms, who had given advances to the cultivators, and, after some trouble, an exception was made in favour of the export of sesame seed. The embargo^ still continues in force, but will, I hope, soon be withdrawn, as the harvest in Arabistan^ has been very good, and the Arabs wish to sell their produce, so as to obtain money to replace the flocks and herds, which perished during the recent drought. In July an attempt was made by the Persian Government to establish a Persian Customs House at Mohammerah, but this fell through in conseoupnce of the opposition of Sheikh Khazal. Owing probably to want, consequent on bad harvests, there has been a considerable amount of crime in Arabistan, and the roads have been unsafe. Complaints have been sent in by British firms, Messrs Lynch and Messrs.* Hotz, complaining of losses sustained. In December 1897, a French exploring party under the direction of M. Jenguir, with whom was Mme. Lampre, ascended the Karun, where they were subsequently joined by M. de Morgan. 8.—FARS AND THE PERSIAN COAST. The Nazim-ud-Dowleh was Governor-General of Pars during the early portion of the past year, and was succeeded in October by His Royal High ness the Pirman Pirma, a near relative of the present Shah. Though reported to be apathetic in the discharge of his duties, the Nazim-ud-Dowleh was undoubtedly popular, and his removal from office was regretted. It is too early yet to pass a judgment on the administration of his successor, who has had to encounter many difficulties from the outset of his term of office. The failure of the winter rains pointed to a famine, and at one time Bushire was crowded with starving people from the interior. The timely fall of rain in March renewed the hopes of the people, and the harvest has been a ffood one, though, as less land than usual has been brought under cultivation the output will be below the average. Had the rain not fallen, an attempt to again destroy the Longitudinal Bench marks at the Telegraph Station would probably have been made. The superstitious idea that these marks in some way control the rainfall still holds good, and it is not improbable that fresh attacks will be made on them when ever the ram holds off. There was a great deal of crime at Bushire and its neighbourhood during toe past year, ihe high prices prevailing and consequent distress were the chief causes of the disorders that prevailed; but they were also fomented by local rival aspirants for power, who wished to discredit each other. Another source of ^ us } llre 18 the neighbourhood of the Tangistanis, a tribe inhabiting the hilly broken country which lies between the lofty tableland of Iran, and the flat strip of sandy shore between the foot of the hills and the sea. Tan- gistan, as its name implies, consists of a succession of if Tangs ' or defiles, and B10 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GUIF POLITICAL is an almost impossible country for regular troops to enter. Sir James Outram forbore to pursue the defeated enemy when they had retreated into this region, after the victory of Khushab, and the thorough conquest of the tribes &amp; who occupy it would be a difficult undertaking, especially now that they are gene rally armed with breech-loading rifles. The Tangistanis played an important part in the defence of Reshire Fort in the campaign of 1856-67, and they have for many years been employed as irregular troops by the Persian authorities. The Malik-ut-Tujar had several in his pay, and it has been the practice amono* the Persians to play off one tribe against another, and to employ one leader to coerce another. Accordingly, towards the close of 1897, Hyder Khan, a Tangistani leader, was deputed to punish Ali Khan, another who had not paid his revenue. Hyder Khan being successful, his opponent came to Bushire and took te Bust' or sanctuary at the Imamzada, a shrine near Reshire. He had a large number of followers with him, and it is said that they committed many of the numerous violent crimes that took place in the early part of 1898. As there were reasons to apprehend that an attack would be made on the Telegraph Station, and on Europeans generally, a small party of Blue-jackets was landed in March, and were retained till an addition to the Resident's escort of 25 sepoys arrived from Bombay. The position of affairs at Bushire at that time gave rise to some anxiety, as the small garrison had been reduced by the despatch of some 150 regulars to the Makran Coast, and the Governor-General was directed by the Persian Government to send a force from Shiraz to coerce the Tangistanis. After considerable delay some 800 men were sent under the command of the Saeed-us-Sultan, an officer on the staff of the Firman Firma. As this expedition was carried out after the end of the year I propose reserv ing an account of it till later, but it is not out of place to mention here that the greater part of the troops employed, as well as their commander, have returned to Shiraz, and that little appears to have been effected as far as the punishment of the Tangistanis is concerned. It is satisfactory to be able to report that the Persian Government, after much discussion, made good, during the past year, the losses incurred by British Firms whose property was robbed when in transit to the interior during the troubles which ensued on the assassination of His Majesty the late Shah in 1896. This result is, I believe, chiefly due to the efforts of the British Legation at Tehran, which was then in charge of the Hon'ble Charles Hardinge, during the absence of Sir H. M. Durand. One claim, that of Messrs. Livingstone Muir for £1,000, was not pressed along with the others, and when Mr. Muir brought it to my notice, I was afraid it was too late. The Legation, however, took it up, and the Persian Government discharged it in full. 9.—-PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. The state of affairs on this Coast has been unsatisfactory for some time, and has been referred to in previous reports. Nominally forming part of Persia, the littoral, from the entrance to the Gulf to the border of British Baluchistan, is occupied by a number of Baluch clans ruled over by their own headmen, who yield but a reluctant and passing submission to the central Government at Tehran. The Persians keep no regular troops permanently in the country, and their rule is maintained by periodical raids to levy revenue, in the course of which the country is laid waste, and cultivation destroyed, innocent people being killed or ruined. The Baluchis have in Consequence a deep hatred for the Persians, and the history of the country, of late years, consists of successive revolts followed by successive conquests by the Persians, who are always able to overcome the Baluchis, who can never unite to resist attack, but are, on the contrary, always ready to betray each other, should a favourable opportunity offer. The events of the past year, though exceptional in some respects, have passed on the same general lines. There were many causes for discontent. The rainfall, usually scanty, has either failed entirely during the past three years, or the crops, when there has been rain, have been destroyed by locusts. The result has been general and widespread distress. Though the harvests have failed, the Persians have enhanced the revenue demand, and this led last year to the revolt of Husain Khan, the Chief of Geh,EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1897-98. H who has been the Baluchi Governor of the District, and is obliged to pay a fixed revenue to the Persian Government. We are interested in the fate of Makran inasmuch as some 258 miles of the land portion of the Indo-Euro pean Telegraph pass through it, and there are two important Telegraph stations at Jask and Charbar, which are worked by Englishmen, who have, in many instances, their wives and families with them. Eor the protection of these s stations, and of the line, subsidies have # Geh 3,000 for many years been paid to the local Dushtiyari .... 1,000 Baluch Chiefs,* who have in return, until recently, protected our people and the line in such a manner that danger was never anticipated. Besides the members of the Telegraph Department at Jask and Oharbar, there are some British Indian traders carrying on trade at the various small ports, who are entitled to our protection, and these men, along with the employes of the Telegraph Depart ment, have suffered during the recent troubles. I have already given the causes for discontent against the Persian rule, to which must be added the prevalent idea that, on the death of His late Majesty the Shah, in 1896, the Persian Government had come to an end, and that the time had come for every one to take what he could lay his hands on. These causes led to the rising against the Persian rule, in which Husain Khan, already referred to, was the leader. This ambitious man undoubtedly wished to establish an independent Baluch Chiefship, like Kalat and would have been glad to have obtained British protection. He has on several occasions made overtures with this object, but was invariably informed that he was the subject of the Shah, and no commu nications could be held with him while he was in a state of revolt against the authority of his lawful ruler. There does not appear originally to have been any hostile feeling against the English, and I am of opinion that no permanent dislike to us exists among the Baluchis. Last year, however, was one of much excitement in the Muhammadan world, and the Baluchis, who are Sunnis, and profess to regard the Sultan of Turkey as their head, undoubtedly felt the effects of the wave of fanaticism, which passed over the tribes on the North- West Erontiers of British India. The hatred of the Persians and contempt for their authority, followed by exaggerated ideas of the recrudescence of Muham madan power, gave the opportunity for attacks on Europeans and their property, which culminated in the murder, on the 2nd December, of Mr. Graves, the Inspector of the land line in Persian Baluchistan. Anticipations of plunder no doubt were at the bottom of each particular crime, but the perpetrators would never have attempted to commit them if the condition of affairs had been normal, and if the prestige of Europeans had not fallen to some extent. It is only necessary for me to refer briefly to the steps which were taken to avenge the murder of Mr. Graves, and to restore order. It was decided from the first that the necessary measures must be taken by the Persians, and that we should only interfere to the extent of establishing the facts of Mr. Graves' murder by a suitable enquiry held on the spot. This was done by me in December 1897, and the enquiry I then made indicated that the murder had been committed by a gang of Kirwanis, a tribe who live near the Rapch river, on the banks of which Mr. Graves was encamped at the time of his death. The evidence I then obtained implicated fivef important 11. Maiik-hind bin shahbeg, Kirwanis as having been leaders of the I:Shahi Gnlbeg, S 1 ' 1 ?' alld this 1138 sinCe Confirmed 4. Sabair bin Suguraiiab, and by the statements of two of them, who 5. Sbahgui bm Yar Muhammad. were ca ptured in April. Of the five men whose names are given in the margin, one, Malik-hind, was killed on the 5th April in an encounter with a party sent to arrest him. Shahi Muhammad was publicly executed at Jask, and Sabair is now in chains at Bushire. The two other leaders are still at large, but the son of Lulla has been captured, and is being kept by the Persians as a hostage for his father, who will, I hope, be secured during the coming winter. Though the capture and death of some of the murderers took place after the end of the official year, it is necessary to refer to it in this report, to explain what has been done. The Persian Govern ment sent the gunboat Persepolis soon after the news of Mr. Graves* death was received, with a small force to the mouth of the Rapch, and the Persian Admiral, the Darya Begi (Lord of the Sea), remained near the scene of the B 212 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL murder from December till the end of May, when he withdrew, the heat having become very trying, and there being no prospect of further results. I myself left the Coast, at the end of December 1897, returning for a few days in April, but throughout the five months that the Darya Begi and his party were on the Eapch, Mr. Campbell of the Indo-European Telegraph Department remained with him, and carried on the duties of Political Officer. A strong escort, sometimes consisting of Blue-jackets, and sometimes of sepoys from the Marine Battalion, was kept on shore for Mr. Campbell's protection, and was also very useful as a support to the Persians, who would otherwise have certainly withdrawn. The Persian Government arranged that a force should be sent from Kerman, simultaneously with the landing of the Darya Begi and his men on the Coast. Before the murder of Mr. Graves, it had been arranged that I should meet the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, the Governor-General of Kerman, at Charbar in February, and arrange personally with him for the settlement of the numerous questions which were then pending. When, in December, the state of the country became still more disturbed, the Asaf-ud-Dowleh was ordered to proceed south without delay, with sufficient force to ensure the pacification of the district, and the capture of Mr. Graves' murderers. The Governor-General, however, appears to have delayed and procrastinated, and the time that was allowed to elapse before he reached Bampur, undoubtedly encouraged the disaffected, and seriously hampered the efforts of the Darya Begi. Those who would have thrown in their lot at once with him, if the Persian advance from the north had taken place in good time, became disheartened by rumours that the Governor-General was not coming. The Asaf-ud-Dowleh eventually reached Bampur, but got no further, returning, when the weather got hot, to Kerman. He was able, however, to send one of his officers, General Lutfullah Khan, to join the Darya Begi, and he appears also to have sent out parties to collect revenue. The Governorship of the district was taken away from Husain Khan, who was reported to be captured. This has since been contra dicted, and it is now stated that his son is in the hands of the Persians, who are keeping him as a hostage till Husain Khan has paid up a heavy fine. Hu sain Khan's rival, one Mauladad Khan, has been made Governor in his place, and it is probable that his power has now been broken. Next cold weather should see the complete restoration of order in Persian Baluchistan. The operations against the Kirwanis were somewhat slow and protracted, and the tribe might perhaps have been punished more speedily if the British parties on shore had been allowed to undertake offensive operations. This would, how ever, have relieved the Persians of the responsibility, which undoubtedly attached to them, and would probably have led to serious complications, out of all proportion to the advantages to be gained by a speedy punishment of the Kirwanis. I am of opinion, too, that the display of force which we made, and the long retention of our troops on the Makran Coast will have a much more lasting effect than any hasty expedition into the interior would have had. As it is, the hostile Baluchis have suffered far more from the prolonged resi dence of the combined force at Rapch, than they would have done had an at tempt been made to follow the murderers into the hills ; and they are now aware we can easily land troops whenever we wish to punish them, should they dare again to interfere with our people. I do not anticipate any further ' serious troubles on the Makran Coast; but it is desirable to maintain for the present a small force at Jask and Charbar for the protection of British subjects. It is worthy of notice that the Telegraph line between Jask and Charbar was never touched, though in British Baluchistan several miles were wrecked when the rioting occurred there. In February, Captain Sykes, Consul for Kerman, was sent to meet the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, with the object of urging him to expedite his movements. Captain Sykes went from Bunder Abbas, but failed to join the Asaf-ud-Dowleh, as his health gave way, and he decided therefore to return to the sea without completing his mission. He eventually arrived at Charbar early in April. 10. SUPPEESSION OF THE ARMS TRAFFIC. One of the most important duties that occupied my time during the past year has been the suppression of the traffic in arms. This trade had of lateEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAK 1897-98. 13 years attained enormous proportions, great quantities of arms and ammuni tion being brought to Maskat and to ports in the Persian Gulf from which they have been distributed among the various lawless tribes living in Arabia, Persia, and Turkish Arabia. It was thought that this route was also employed to supply the Afridis and other tribes on the North-West Frontier, with whom the Government of India have been carrying on hostilities during the past year. This has not yet been established, but even if arms and ammunition from the Gulf do not penetrate as far as our North-West Frontier, the general arming of the populations bordering on the Gulf was an undoubted source of danger to all settled G-overnments, and, therefore, to British trade. The Persian Government some years ago prohibited the importation of arms, and this prohibition, though not properly enforced, has never been cancelled. In November, however, the Government resolved to avail itself of this prohibition, and, early in December, a quantity of arms and ammunition were seized at Bushire. Subsequently the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf Steam Ship Company's steamer Baluchistan was stopped at Maskat and a quantity of arms and ammunition originally consigned for Bushire were taken out of her. This capture was effected by Her Majesty's ship Lapwing on behalf of the Sultan of Maskat, who had agreed to co-operate with the British and Persian Governments in putting an end to the arms traffic. More arms were seized at Bahrein by the Sheikh in January, and the total seizures amounted to 15,733 rifles and 2,456 ,7741 cartridges. The various questions arising out of these confiscations are still unsettled, and cannot therefore be dealt with in this report. 11.—SLAVE TKADE. There have been no important captures of slave-carrying vessels during the past year ; but some minor transactions have been brought to light and dealt with. The question of the employment of French flags by Maskat vessels is still under consideration. Three slaves took refuge in the Bushire Residency, of which one was manumitted, while the claims of the other two are still under consideration. 12.-PIEACY. Three acts of piracy in the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab took place in May. The victims were Kowait boats, from one of which goods and cash to the extent of Krans 17,000 (equivalent to about Bs. 5,500) were carried off and a member of the crew was killed. In September when the Lawrence was in the Shat-el-Arab, information of an act of piracy on the high seas, near the entrance of the river, was received. The pirates were captured and were made over to the Persian authorities, all the parties being Persian subjects. The pirates received six months' imprisonment, and their boats and effects were sold, the proceeds being handed over to the injured persons who had been badly wounded. An outward bound Kutch sailing boat was attacked and plundered in the Shat-el-Arab in December between Fao and Mohammerah. Two of the crew were killed. 13.—ROYAL NAVY. During the early part of the year Her Majesty's steamer the Sphinx, Commander Baker, was the only man-of-war in the Gulf. In June, the Figeon, Lieutenant-Commander Mowbray, passed up the Gulf to Basrah, where she remained almost continuously till December when she proceeded to the Makran Coast, and landed a party who took part in the expedition made with the object of investigating Mr. Graves' murder. The Figeon was subsequently put on duty connected with the suppression of the traffic in arms, and eventually went to Bombay. The Sphinx as usual went to Maskat and Bas-al-Had for the summer, and in November left the Gulf for Bombay, where she remained, undergoing annual repairs, till January 1898. Besides the Sphinx and the Pigeon, the Cossack, Commander Fraser, the 'Redbreast, Commander Martin, and the Lapwing, Lieutenant-Commander Carr, were employed at various times during the winter on duties under the14 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET ON THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL general direotion of the Resident in the Persian Gulf. The Lapwing, as already noticed in this report, effected the capture of the arms and ammunition on board the Baluchistan, and has in consequence been almost entirely employed in the neighbourhood of Maskat, outside the actual limits of the Persian Gulf. 14.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. Colonel F. Wilson was Resident and Consul-General up to the 10th June when I relieved him. Lieutenant C. Ducat was Pirst Assistant Resident up to the 17th July, when he left Bushire to take up an appointment in India. Lieutenant F. B. Prideaux arrived at Bushire on 21st August. Mr. J. C. Gaskin held charge of the duties of First Assistant between the departure of Lieutenant Ducat and Lieutenant Prideaux's arrival, 15.—OBSERVATORY.

The past year has not been productive of any events of import ance in the political history of Oman Political. and there are fewer inter-tribal disturb ances than usual to record. The gen eral quiet has been brought about by the excessive price in food-stuffs which has had the effect of engendering a general desire for peace and a fuller appreciation of the advantages of free gifts of food-stuffs from the Sultan. In May rumours were current of unrest amongst the Beni Ruwaheh and Beni Jabir fomented by Sheikh Rashid, the Sultan's Wali at Semail, who, for purposes of his own, was endeavouring to set these tribes against one another. Quiet was, however, restored. In June a disturbance occurred at Nakhl, Sheikh Khalfan bin Thenayan, a very troublesome personage, being the aggressor. Pifty men were despatched with the Wali of Barka to restore order and to arrest Khalfan bin Thenayan, but the latter evaded capture by flight and has hitherto succeeded in retain- ing his liberty, notwithstanding several attempts to effect his capture. In December the Beni Ruwaheh attacked Seyma, a place belonging to the Beni Hadram and took it with a loss to the defenders of three men killed and six taken prisoners. On hearing the news Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, Wali of the Semail, interceded between the parties and succeeded in effecting the restoration of Seyma to the Beni Hadram. Suleiman bin Suweilim, the Governor of Dhofar, arrived at that place on Dhofar the 15th April and took over charge of his duties. In April and May, two bodies of men belonging to His Highness's gar- nson at Dhofar, numbering in all about ^5 menj deserted and returned to Maskat. •^i 0r ^ a ^ er ® u ^ e i man bin Suweilim's arrival at Dhofar in April 1897, ^ J a 'i^ants^ of Hafa attacked those of Salala with the result that one t a * was killed. In this affair Suleiman favoured the inhabitants of Hata, and was strongly suspected of being the instigator of the quarrel between the parties. On the matter being reported to the Sultan, His High- ness sem; letters Bombay and Aden recalling Suleiman and appointing Seyyid Self bin Yarab as Governor in his place. Suleiman did not obey the order of recall till the end of Pebruary, and when he did so, he brought back with him the Sultan's nominee, Seyyid beit bin Yarab, and left his Nubian slave, Noobie, an illiterate and abso lutely worthless individual, to act as Wali in his place. In November 1897, the Wali's nephew and an Arab who accompanied iiirn, were attacked and killed by the Kara hillmen. In May 1897, an attempt was made by the Sultan to insist that all bags of rice imported into Maskat should be General - of one uniform weight. As such an and fn Wnflf i, j ^ or(ier was calculated to hamper trade revoked this order m WaS re P rese:ilted to His Highness who finfV 116 ^ J une '. t,le Jubilee, in eommemoration of the completion of celeEted 76 '^ 0f Her M V esthe Queen-Empress, was duly thp nopqcmn o /j fu ^ rei ^ n representatives offered their congratulations on their loyalty to n Her e Majesty 0f ^ ^ BaniaH commuilitie8 testifled wardp^n^ffri S 6 in Charge of the Makran Coast for- p i n rom the British Indian traders at Gwadur, representing18 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL that an attempt was being made by the Sultan to levy exorbitant taxes on the fish yards owned by them, and suggesting that the taxes should be reduced by two-thirds. Personal enquiries made by me on the spot showed that the complaints of the owners of the fish-yards were well founded, and that the taxes which it was sought to levy were out of all proportion to the profits made by these individuals, some of whom had already closed their yards in consequence of its imposition. On the matter being represented to the Sultan, His Highness was at first indisposed to make any change, but ultimately he was induced to agree to the proposed reduction. In January 1898, the Sultan agreed to co-operate with the British and Persian Governments in the suppression of the illegal importation of arms into Persia and British India and issued a proclamation on the 13th of the same month authorizing British and Persian vessels of war to search, in Maskat waters, vessels carrying the flags of the British, Persian, and Maskat Govern ments, and confiscate arms and ammunition found in them intended for Persian and British Indian ports. As a result of this arrangement, the Anglo-Arabian Persian Steam Navigation Company's steamer Baluchistan was searched by H. M. S. Lapwing and 210 cases of arms and ammunition intended for Bushire were seized. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Maskat in June in the R. I. M. S. Lawrence, and again in January in the same vessel. The quarantine imposed by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat on account of the prevalence of plague in Bombay and Karachi, remained in force through out the year. It was reduced to five days in June, but in consequence of the recent recrudescence of plague at Karachi, it was again increased to eight days. The measure was effective and kept the disease out of the country. The tide-gauge which was erected in February 1893, was dismantled in March by Mr. Belcham, the Extra Assistant Superintendent, Survey of India Department, In August 1897, a collision occurred between the Bombay and Persia Marine Steam Navigation Company's steamer Mobile and an Arab dhow from Sur which resulted in the latter being sunk. All hands were saved by the boats of the Mobile. The owner of the dhow brought an action against the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company, but the enquiry showed that the accident was caused by the negligence of the Nakhoda in not taking the ordinary and proper precautions to avoid such an accident. The following men-of-war visited Maskat:—H. M. S. 'Redbreast, 'Pigeon^ Navy. Sphinxi Lapwing, and Cossack. The Indian Government Telegraph steamer Patrick Stewart also visited Maskat with Mr. Pfinch, the Director-in-Chief of the Indo-European Tele graphs, on board. Eoreign Navies were represented by the Erench gun-boat Gabes. During the year 43 fugitive slaves took refuge in the Consulate. Of these slave Trade ^ Were f ree( i under the Treaty stipula tions of 1873, and the rest dismissed, not being entitled to freedom. Commanders Baker of H. M. S, Sphinx and Carr of H. M. S. Lapwing, liberated, respectively, under the Brussels Conference Act, 3 and 5 slaves who had taken refuge on board the vessels under their command. In July, the Residency Agent at Lingah was directed by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to send to this Consulate two Africans from the Batineh who had taken refuge at the Lingah Agency and who had been kid napped by two Arabs. The Arabs made their escape on their way to Maskat, and the Africans who could identify them having also absconded on arrival at Maskat, the case was allowed to drop. The long standing case of the seven Africans which gave rise to volu minous correspondence was brought to a close by the release of the threeKESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1897-98. 19 surviving Africans, one of whom, by name Saadu, elected to return to Africa; while the other two, named Seyanoo and Juma, elected to settle in Maskat.

As anticipated in last year's report, trade to and from the Gulf has not been as flourishing in 1897 as in recent previous years. In spite, however, of a recrudescence of the plague in India and a poor harvest in Southern Persia, due to a very scanty rainfall, the year shows an improvement on 1896 to the extent of an increase of E7B,23,602 in imports, and of E2,MA32 in exports. The poorness of the spring harvest in 1897 compelled people to resort early in the year to the stores of grain preserved in underground granaries from pre vious years, and, when these were exhausted, food-stuffs had to be imported from India and Basrah. Prices of food-stuffs in August and September were higher than they are remembered to have been in any former year, and when during the latter months of the year, rain persistently held off, fears were generally entertained that a worse famine than that of 1871-72 was inevitable. These fears have since fortunately been dissipated by the excellent rainfall wdiich occurred in March 1898; and the harvest is reported to be good, though less land than usual has been brought under cultivation. The old-established shipping companies, the British India, the Bombay and Persia, and the Anglo-Arabian and Persian Gulf, had the field to them selves in the Persian Gulf throughout the year, and with the exception of a short interruption in the service of the first mentioned, consequent on a strike amongst its officers, on the eastern run, all three services worked very regu- larly. The new German firm alluded to in last year's report, which trades under the name of Deutsch-Persische Ha^dels-Gesellschaft, continued its operations at Bushire throughout the year, besides starting Agencies at Shiraz and in one or two of the lesser ports in the Persian Gulf. Many merchants and manufacturers in Germany and Belgium have com menced soliciting orders from the Persian traders, and their eagerness to aftord facilities will probably sooner or later open up fresh lines of commerce, though, for the year under report, the competition thus offered has not been seriously felt by the old-established firms here. The deputation of Dr. Hauck, formerly of the German Legation at Tehran, as Consul in Bushire, to institute a German Vice-Consulate here, is significant of the endeavours to expand her trade w^hich Germany has lately begun to make all over the world. I would invite special attention to this matter, as it is certain to affect British trade ere long, and efforts should be made to main tain our present supremacy, A small native banking establishment, conducted entirely by Persian merchants, and with a capital of £20,000 in shares, opened this year under the style of the Bushire Trading Company. Similar institutions have also been started in Shiraz, Ispahan and Tehran, and it is claimed for these companies by their supporters that they have rendered important services to the general public. The Imperial Bank of Persia is, how'ever, strongly protesting against their existence, on the ground that they infringe the concession made to the Bank. Towards the close of 1897, the prospects for the present year seemed decidedly gloomy. The sowing season, which commences in November, opened under such unfavourable circumstances as a heavy mortality amongst the cattle and plough animals, scarcity and high prices of seed, impoverishment of the cultivators, and tardy and scanty rain. Added to this were the misfortunes of internecine quarrels, and the loss by shipwreck of many able-bodied men who had gone to Basrah on the annual mission to purchase dates for the year's con sumption, and for distribution amongst the peasantry. The removal of theseBESIDENCY AND MA SKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1897-98. 21 persons in such a sudden way must, along with other causes I have mentioned, have materially diminished the extent of the area placed under cultivation in the districts to which they belonged. Later on, however, favourable reports were received from the interior of the good done to the crops by the late heavy fall of rain, and of the prospect of a good harvest in consequence. In spite, therefore, of the fact that the opium crop is not likely to be a large one, and that fruit-trees, particularly almonds, have been damaged by frost and locusts, there is reason to hope that the volume of trade in 1898, if hardly up to nor mal standard, will show a great improvement upon the year under report. ■ Imports. Arms and ammunition. —This trade was carried on unchecked until the beginning of December when the Persian Government suddenly announced its intention to stop it once and for all, and, in consequence thereof, proceeded to enforce the prohibition, which has existed since 1881, by seizing and confis cating every rifle and cartridge which could be found for sale in its seaport towns and territorial waters. Although the importation of arms was carried on for only about eleven months of the year under report, the imports nevertheless showed an increase over the whole previous year's figures of about two lakhs of rupees, thus show ing how rapidly it was increasing. Candles. —There was a general falling off of the demand for this article, due to the dearness of living, and transactions in it consequently resulted in loss to the importers. Coffee. —The use of coffee is said to be dying out in Persia, and the little trade done in it resulted in loss. Dearness of the staple food-stuffs also contri buted to diminish the demand during the past year, with the result that the decrease of the import has been about 18 per cent, as compared with the pre vious year. Cotton goods. —Transactions in the interior on the whole are said to have been unremunerative, but in the seaport towns a profit of about 10 per cent, is reported to have been made on imports, the value of which exceeded that of 1896 by nearly 50 lakhs of rupees. Drugs and Medicines. —There was a good deal of sickness in the interior, notably at Shiraz, where influenza and fevers were very rife and caused many deaths. Consequently imports, influenced by demand, increased about 20 per cent., and trade in these articles was very lucrative, profits recorded being 10 to 15 per cent, The condition of the market, however, at the close of the year leaves the prospect for 1898 somewhat unfavourable. Glass and glass-ware. —The total import shows a small increase, owing to a demand having arisen in Lingah and Bunder Abbas, where there was none before. In Bushire the demand has considerably decreased. Gold lace and thread. —Trade in this line is still feeling the competition noticed in last year's report, viz., the introduction from the north of a better class of goods and the increase, therefore, over the figures of 1896 is hardly appreciable. Hardware and Cutlery, —There was a decline of R25,200 in the value of these goods, due to dearness of food-stuffs. Indigo. —Calcutta indigo is said to be getting into disfavour, and cheaper sorts are being sought after, more suitable for supplying the wants of the country. The trade, however, has revived considerably from the depression caused in the previous year by the Indian famine, and the imports show an increase valued at E2,72,102 over 1896. Matches. —The decrease in the import of this article was due to the supply of last year having exceeded the demand. Metals, —The imports only show a small increase over those of last year, but the trade is reported to have been generally profitable and more especially in yellow metal sheets for which an increasing demand exists.22 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL t OH, Kerosene,—The dearness of food-stuffs is probably the cause of the falling off in the import of this article. Shipments made direct from Russia are said to have been more profitable than those from India. Porcelain and China-ware. —The money returns of these wares show a further improvement of a few thousand rupees over the figures of the previous year, and it seems clear that importers, having been induced in 1896 to import less of the cheap Indian and more of the more expensive and better European article, have now realised the fact that better business can be done in the latter. English and Continental makes are getting more into favour, and have pushed their way even as far as Tehran, competing there with Russian goods. Imports from China have at the same time as those from India materially decreased. ^ Provisions and Stores. —The value of the import of these articles has been almost as great as in 1896, and 1^ lakhs greater than in 1895. Enormous • Calcutta and Buma. quantities of rice have been imported into Bushire from India,* showing that the cause of the abnormal import was the failure of the harvest in Persia. Sugar, loaf, —The figures this year show a large increase of nearly three lakhs of rupees m value over the previous year. The imports from Erance and Germany, however, are reported not to have afforded much satisfaction or profit. Sugar, soft. There has been a large falling-off in the import this year, probably due to the inability of the poor classes, the principal buyers, to indulge largely in its use. The trade in Mauritius sugar was less satisfactory than that in the German article which is imported vid London and Bombay. Tea.—The import of this article was smaller in value than in 1896 by £9,58,980. The reason is the same as that given in the case of sugar (soft). Timber and Wood.—The demand continues to increase both for Indian and Singapore sorts, and very good profits are said to have been realised in these articles. Woollen Goods.—The figures for 1897 show a further fall of R26 160 beyond those for 1896, but notwithstanding this, the demand is reported to' be increasing, and considerable profits were made by importers. The reason for the falliog-off is the same as that given for 1896. Exports. Horses. There was a considerable fall in this trade during 1896, due to plague and famine in India. This year, on account of the recrudescence of the plague the market in Bombay was said to be so dull that only 10 horses were exported during the year, and consequently a further fall of ^42,870 is recorded. Arms and Ammunition.—The import of these into Bahrein, which used to be effected through Bushire and the other Persian ports in the Gulf, was carried on direct this year; hence the falling off of £59,904 in the exports. iQLC\c^i.^ n ' ^ ^ ur ^ er ^ ar &amp; e of Rl»30,729, compared with the figures of 1 o 9 d , took place in the export of this commodity. This is attributable, partly to the same cause as prevailed in 1896, namely, the poorness of the cotton crop, and partly to the bulk of the produce finding its way to Russia, where better prices are now obtained than in India. Dates, The increase in the export of dates occurred principally at Lingah. r r ^ Almnnds.—There was a slight increase in the export of this commodity, but prices realised were said not to be good, as the demand in India was small. Wheat. There was an entire absence of export of this grain from Bushire, and the increase of the export from Lingahand Bunder Abbas only means that gram was sent from there to other Persian ports, where prices were actuallyresidency and maskat political agency for the year 1897-98. 23 Q um ,—Bushire has hitherto been the only port from which this product has been exported, but favourable markets in England and India not only induced an export from Bushire of more than double that of the previous year, but also encouraged shipments from Lingah. The advance recorded amounts to over a lakh of rupees, and considerable profits were realised, both on local sales and on shipments. Rides and Skins. —There was a rise in the exports of these articles amount ing in value to about R38,923. Opium. —The decrease in the export is due to a poor crop. Rose-water. —The demand for this article fell considerably in India, proba bly on account of the recrudescence of plague. Shells. —Export this year exceeded that of 1896 by Rl,21,102, and the trade again proved exceptionally remunerative, in spite of the wages paid to the divers being raised in rates. This is a trade in which European and the better class of Persian merchants hesitate to engage, the persons concerned in it being notorious for their fraudulent practices. Silk. —The slight fall in the export of this article was due to the recrudes cence of plague in India. Tobacco. —The heavy fall in the export of this commodity is said to be due to the opposition of the priesthood of Persia, who regard with disfavour the monopoly held by the ' Societe de Tombac ' from the Persian Government. IFool. —A large increase of this article, worth El,17,849, has been exported, but as shipments to the United Kingdom are said not to have been profitable, it is hardly likely that the rate of increase will be maintained. Carpets. —A bad market in Egypt prevented large exports being made, and a fall of B 1,04,584 resulted. M iscellaneous. Exchavge. —Sterling exchange stood at Krans 51J at the commencement of the year, and fell gradually to Krans 56J, which figure it reached in October. It rose again to Krans 53J in November, and at the close of the year it was 55 Krans. Exchange between rupees and krans fluctuated more than in the previous year. Opening at Krans 320 to the E100, the rate rose in August to Krans 345, and still continuing to rise, at the close of the year was Krans 355 to E100. Mule hire. —This was fairly moderate and steady throughout the year. It opened at the rate of Krans 80 per load, and excepting a fall in March and April to Krans 65, the rates ranged between Krans 80 and 95 till the close of the year, when they stood at Krans 105 per load. Freights. —Freights to London ruled at 25s. per ton throughout the year except in May when they fell to 23s. and 22s. 6^. Shipping, —The shipping trade of the year under review shows a small decrease when compared with the figures of 1896, and a considerable decrease on 1895. Ninety-three steam vessels, aggregating 101,394 tons, entered the port of Bushire, a very great majority of which carried the British flag. M. J.

Hawfall and harvest, —It will be remembered that a timely fall of rain in March 1898 saved the crops last year. Less area than usual had, however, been sown, and there was not, therefore, grain for exportation, nor did prices fall appreciably during the summer, or indeed until the rainfall in the winter assured the coming harvest. The rains this year commenced in the middle of November, and, though there was immediately afterwards a prolonged break, they recommenced in December, and continued off and on till the beginning of March, when they ceased entirely. It clouded up several times in March, and a good ' Nao Roz' rain was confidently expected, but, unfortunately, none fell, and the crop has not, therefore, been quite so good as was at one time expected. The late-sown fields required more rain to bring them on, and even the early ones would have benefitted. On the whole, however, the harvest has been a good one, a great deal of land Prices in 1897-98. has been cultivated, and prices, as will wteatKrs. 21 to28perHashiminaand of 124 lbs. be seen from the marginal statement, Eice ey Krs.' lo to 50 ' ' ' ' have fallen greatly.

The present Sadr Azam is not powerful, and if he removed the embargo his enemies would probably say that he was allowing grain to go out of the country which was wanted to feed the subjects of the Shah, and, although the distance from the south to the north of Persia is so great that grain could never be sent there for sale, the charge would probably be believed by starving people in the north. The Mullas are said to be opposed to the withdrawal of the embargo, and, lastly, it is said to be a source of profit to local Governors and officials who are generally considered to wink at the evasion of it, as they do at that of other prohibitions. British firms complain that grain is being freely exported by native merchants, who can gratify the local authorities, while they are obliged to abstain absolutely from a profitable trade. I trust that ere long the Persian Government may see its way to remove this prohibition, which is doing much injury to the trade of Southern Persia. The effects of the plentiful rainfall were seen on the Bushire plain, and changed its ordinary parched and dried up surface into a green sea of young corn, interspersed6 ADMINISTSATION EEPOET ON THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL with masses of wild flowers, for which, according to the old sailino- direction« Buslnre has always been famous. Early in the year fields of narciZ* scented the air, and these, later on in February and March, gave place to a profusion of other flowers, poppies, larkspur, wild stocks, lilies etc whioh mingled with the green of the wheat and barley, were very pleasant to th eye. The want of rain in March shortened the spring, and by April the nkin had resumed its normal aspect. ^ Changes in the Governorship of Tlicre have been five Governor of Bushire during the year under report, (1) the Imadi-Nizam, (2) Saepdnc Sultan, (3) Muzzafer-i-Nizam, (4) Muez-ul-Mumalek, and (5) the Daria Begi, or ' lord of the seas,' the high-sounding title of the Persian Admiral The first four named were deputies appointed by the Firman Pirma who wa&lt;i then Governor-General of Pars; but later on, when the Gulf Ports were taken from the Pirman Pirma and given to the Mujir-es-Sultaneh tho Muez-ul-Mumalek stayed on as the deputy of the last-named official ' whn is the nephew of the powerful brothers, the Saad-nl-Mulk and Nizam es Sultaneb, whose conduct was so questionable during the riots at ohushter' in 1895. The Persian Government then promised that they were not again to be given any Governorships in Southern Persia. It was ascertained that the Mujir-es-Sultaneh was the nominee of his uncles, who, it was said had found the money for the purchase of the Governorship of Bushire, and in conse quence of strong representations at Tehran the appointment was cancelled the Mujir-es-Sultaneh having to turn back in August from Shiraz which be bad reached on his way south. The Daria Begi obtained the Governorshin in September, the following month, and has held it ever since. Public peace and tranquility.—It is pleasant, after the record of 3897-98 to be able to report a comparatively quiet year at Bushire and in its nei'bbom&gt; bood. There have been few cases of violent crime, and the English com munity have not suffered at all. This improved state of things is no doubt' chiefly due to the good rainfall, which provided plenty of agricultural work for everyone, and to the consequent fall in prices. Other causes, I think are the stoppage of the arms traffic and the punitive measures taken during the spring and early summer against the Tungastanis. As mentioned in last year's report, a small force of Cavalry and Infantry, with a field gun was sent by the Pirman Pinna in Aprill898 from Shiraz to Borazioon where I saw them. They were under the command of the Saeed-us-Sultan 'and were about 800 strong. It is not necessary to enter into a detailed account of his proceedings, and it is sufficient to state that little was done beyond harrvine the country and levying revenue. A few men were executed, but the popular opinion is that they were not the real criminals, and ransoms were taken from wealthy persons who fell into the hands of the ' Army '. The expedition is believed to have been financially a success, but it is doubtful if it bad much lasting effect on the Tungastanis, or if any punishment reached those really to blame for the troubles which occurred in the early part of 1898 The Saeed-us-Sultan came to Busbire on the 20th May, and took up the post of Governor. He was recalled, however, immediately afterwards bv the Governor-General, and returned to Shiraz with the greater part of his troops It will be remembered that the Tungastani leader, Ali Khan, was believed to' be the instigator of the attacks on the Bushire Residency, and on Mahmoud the Jemadar of the Telegraph Department, whose relatives were killed and whose bouse was looted in March 1898. Immediately after these crimes, All 11 nan tied trom the Imamzada where he had been in &lt;{ bust' and returned to Tungastan. His enemy Hyder Khan joined Saeed-us-Sultan, and having made a valuable present to him was confirmed in his position of Tungastani Governor. Ali Khan hearing of this fled to a port bio-her up tbe coast, with the intention of going by sea to Basrah. No attempts bein^ made, however, to seize him, be returned to Tungastan, from where he conT- menced writing, to Mahmoud, and to the Residency, declaring his innocence and threatening that, it the efforts which were being made against him were not relaxed, he would come in and take « bust ' with Mahmoud. It should here be explained that this custom of taking ' bust' is carried in Persia to such a length that an accused person can enter the house of his accuser, who is bound to receive him, and unable to take any steps againstRESIDENCY AND MASK AT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-1 him, while he is in ' bust ^ Ali Khan did not eventually go to Mahmoud's house, but applied to the Residency Authorities, stating that he would come in and surrender himself, provided he received a fair trial, and that a promise was given him that he would not be handed over to the Persians. I was at that time away from Bushireat Shiraz, and Mr. Prideaux, Assistant Resident, agreed to Ali Khan's proposal. He came in accordingly, and an investigation, which was held, pointed strongly to his connection with the crimes which occurred while he and his followers were staying at the Imamzada. Claims therefore of 4,000 Tomans were put forward by the Residency as compensation to those who had suffered. Ali Khan would probably have paid the amount, but he wished to be assured that he would not be molested afterwards by the Persian Government. This assurance we were unable to obtain, and I told Ali Khan, on my return from Shiraz, that as he had come in on the safe-conduct of a British Officer, he was free to leave the Residency, where he had been living for six months, whenever he pleased, but that as he had not paid the compensation demanded, we would now endeavour to recover it through the Persian Govern ment, to whom he is subject. A formal demand has recently been made by cur Minister at Tehran, and I hope the money will be recovered in due course. Ali Khan owns considerable landed property on the Bushire Island, and the outrage on Mahmoud originated in a dispute over a water-way. It had not, I now think, a political object, and Mahmoud, was attacked not because he was a British protege, but for personal reasons. Quarantine and public health. —Quarantine has continued to be adminis tered at the request of the Persian Government by the Government of India, who have given the services of Assistant Surgeons to supervise the arrange ments at Mohammerah, Lingah and Bunder Abbas. At Bushire itself quaran tine is managed by the Residency Surgeon, an Assistant Surgeon and a Hos pital Assistant working under him. No case of plague has appeared in the Gulf during the year under report, but two imported cases have been discovered at Maskat since the 1st April. The victims were promptly segregated, and subsequently recovered. There have been no further cases. Ten days' quaran tine is enforced against all ships from Karachi, the nearest infected port, and where the ship is herself infected she has to do ten days' quarantine from date of arrival. The only instance in which plague has occurred on board a ship coming up the Gulf is that of the ' Patna' who lost a stoker at Karachi. Her passengers had, in consequence, to do ten days' quarantine on arrival here. The general health of the country bordering on the Gulf has been good, no epidemic having occurred during the year under report. Currency, —The currency of Southern Persia has fallen into a very unsatis factory condition. The silver Kran, which is equivalent to about 4 annas 6 pies, and which is almost universally used in commercial transactions, has been much depreciated. There are, too, several distinct mintings, the Krans of which have different values. In Bushire alone some 18 different kinds of Krans containing different quantities of silver and having different market values are in circulation. New Krans, which are almost the only kind which the Imperial Bank of Persia and the Customs House will accept, have been sent in large quantities up-country, with the result that it is difficult to obtain them in the Bushire market, and merchants have been put to much incon venience in consequence. The matter is now being considered by Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. The inconvenience experienced from the defective state of the currency has been enhanced by the action of a native company called the ' Bushire Trading Company', who flooded Bushire with ' Bijecks ' or notes made &lt;e payable to bearer '. This syndicate appear to have collected a quan- tity of good Krans, and sent them up-country, paying their bills in their own notes, which their constituents, generally petty dealers, could not refuse to accept. Similarly, British firms who had dealings with Persians have been obliged to accept &lt;s Bijecks ' or bad Krans in payment of their claims, and have subsequently experienced much difficulty in getting rid of them. As the issue of these ' Bijecks ' appears to be a breach of the Bank's monopoly, they protested, with the result that the Persian Government have recently issued orders, directing the Bushire Trading Company ' to call in all their8 ADMINISTRATION RBPOET ON THE PEESIAN GOLF POLITICAL 'Bijeoks and declaring them illegal tgnder after the 1st of June. This should have a beneficial effect, especially if the Shah's Government can call in all the old Krans, now in circulation, and re-mint them. In August last thp Persian Government issued a proclamation forbidding the importation nf copper coins into Tehran and their transport from place to place. Transfer of Customs to Imperial Bank of Pema.—The Residency had an unusually busy time at the beginning of the year under report, in eonnectC with the arrangements for the management of the Bushire Customs bv the Imperial Bank of Persia, who had given a loan of £50,000 to the Government on the condition that they would be given the management of the Customs at Bushire and Kermanshah. In April 1898 orders were issued for the transfer of the management to the Bank, who thereupon sent their representative to the Customs House. This gave rise to some excitement amongst certain inter ested parties, as it was declared that a uniform rate of 5 per cent, would be levied in future, and as the native merchants feared that they would suffer in conse quence. The 5 per cent, levied on goods belonging to*' European firms carries them everywhere in Persia, and no further payment can be demanded. Native owned goods, however, though they pay less than 5 percent, at Bushire, are liable to further taxation at various places in the interior, and the native merchants believed that, if the duty they had to pay at Bushire was enhanced, it would not free their goods from further,taxation elsewhere. It was also understood that food-stuffs would-be taxed,'and 'strenuous efforts were made to oppose the Bank, the Mullahs being induced to declare that the arrangement was contrarv to their religion. To prevent any outbreak at the Customs House, the Resi- dency steam-launch with a crew of blue-jackets from H M. S. 'Sphinx' was anchored off the Customs House, in case it became necessary to protect the property of British firms collected there. The presence of this party undoubt edly prevented a serious riot from occurring, and the Bank gradually took up the functions of managing the Customs. The Persian Government withdrew its order insisting on the 5 per cent, duty being levied on goods of native mer chants, and in doing so acted, I think, properly, as it was undoubtetliy a hardship to suddenly enhance the rates without gVing those concerned any* warning that it would be done. This concession having been made, the Bank proceeded with the management of the Customs. Their rule was popular, and would have been more so as time went on. Unfortunately the loan had only been given for a few months, and when the period expired in August tile monev was unexpectedly forthcoming. There is little doubt that the £60,000 were supplied by Russia, who was not pleased to see a^British Institution like the Bank, obtaining the prestige which the control of the Customs gave.' Tours during the year.— I visited Maskat in April 1898, returning to Buslure at the end of the month. Soon after my return I started on a pfo- longed visit to Shiraz and other places in Pars, returning to the coast in October. An account of this trip, which enabled me to avoid the summer heat in the Persian Gulf, will form the subject of a separate report. In January I visited Kharj Island, Koweit and Mohammerah, and in the follow ing month went to Maskat, where I remained till the end of Pebruary when I visited Bahrein, returning finally to Bushire on the 6th March. I sent Mi. P. B. Prideanx in December to enquire into some pending cases at Ijinffah Bunder Abbas and on the Makran Coast, which has also been twice visited by Mr, Sealy, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraph Department, and Political Officer for the Coast. Settlement of claims for compensation.—A good deal has been done during the past year in disposing of claims by British subjects for compensation on account of thefts, robberies, etc. Great difficulty is always experienced in dis- posmg of these cases, becanse they are theoretically supposed to lie against the official who is the Governor at the time they occurred. The Governor- ship, bke every other appointment in Persia, is sold to the highest bidder, and the Governor is really, therefore, merely a contractor, who endeavours to make as much as he can out of the revenues and emoluments of his post. He is theoretically responsible for the maintenance of law and order, and, according to the custom of the country, has to make good losses sustained within his jurisdiction by subjects of Poreign Powers, if he cannot punishRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. 9 the criminal engaged and recover the stolen property. The consequence is that, unless a Governor sees his way to squeezing more than the property claimed out of somebody else, he udll do nothing to substantiate a claim for compensation, and does all he can to delay payment if the claim is clearly established. With the incessant changes of Governors there have been of late, it has been very difficult to prevent these % tactics from being successful, for once a Governor has been relieved it is almost impossible to gelb anything out of him, and my predecessor, shortly before he left, was obliged to send the files of 23 claims for compensation to Her Majesty's Minister at. Tehran, with the hope that he would be able to press them on the Central Government. Nothing appears to have been done, however, until I addressed the Minister again on the subject in July last, when the Sadr-Azam agreed to the cases being investigated by the Daria Begi, the Governor of Bushire, who was told to go into each claim and report on it to the Central Government. Accordingly the files of all the cases were taken to the Charborj and an enquiry was com menced. No result, however, has as yet been arrived at, as the Daria Begi was obliged to leave Bushire soon afterwards and proceed to Lingah, where he has been ever since. The amount claimed for thei-e&lt;23 cases comes to Krans 19,678, and they will be pressed on the Daria Begi's return. Since I toolc over charge in June 1897, there have been 30 claims for compensation aggregating Krans 3,04,564. Nearly all these have been disposed of and the claims either compromised or paid in full. While I was at Shiraz, I managed,* with the assistance of Captain Sykes, Consul at Kerman, to dispose of 17 cases in direct communication with the Eirman Pirma. The amount claimed was Krans 32,275, and a compromise was arrived at for Krans 19,6^6, which was distributed amongst the various claimants. In August last a serious robbery took place from a lighter bringing piece- goods from the S. S. 44 Farran ' to the Customs House. The lighter was supposed to have capsized during the night, but in reality her cargo Was removed and handed over to certain Persian merchants, who actually des patched a portion to Shiraz, where I was at the time. Fortunately the crime was discovered and traced home, with the result that the guilty persons were punished and obliged to make good the value of the stolen property, which came to about Krans 1,50,000. The lesson has been a very beneficial one, as it has probably put an end to a system of fraudulent jettisons, which are generally believed to have been going on, and which were causing the Insur ance Companies much loss and annoyance. The assistance given by the Governor in the disposal of this case deserves special notice. Claims on behalf of the Telegraph Department for Government and other property taken at the time of Mr. Graves' death have been made good by the Persian Government, who have recently remitted Krans 16,841, which have been handed over to the Department. Mr. Sealy's recent visit to Charbar on the Makran Coast has resulted in the partial settlement of a number of claims for compensation put forivard by British Indian subjects there. Mr. Sealy met the Mamoor, who represents the Persian Government, and Mowladad Khan, the new Baluchi Governor of Persian Baluchistan, and came to an understanding with them, which will probably result in a complete settlement of these questions during the coming year. Generally, out of claims aggregating Krans 3,16,947 at Bushire, Krans 2,02,190, equivalent to about Rs. 56,164, have been recovered from the Persian authorities, leaving a sum of Krans 1,02,108 still recoverable. This, however, includes Krans 40,000 on account of the outrages committed at the house of Mahmoud, the Telegraph Jemadar, and at the Busliire Residency in March 1898. and, as already stated, a formal demand for payment has recently been made on the Central Government. This was delayed as it was hoped that the money could be recovered direct from Ali Khan, but, as this has been found impos sible, we have been Obliged to go to the Persian Government, w ho will now b e obli ged to take active measures against the culprits. Mail rohhenes.-~T\\Q Persian Post Kossid, who left Bushire for Shiraz on the 8th of October 1898, was attacked and killed near Khan-zanyan. The robbers, who belonged to the Rai-Rahmat tribe, carried off all the parcels and10 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL cash. The Governor-General of Fars sent about 40 sowars under an officer to punish the robbers, but beyond recovering some of the parcels nothing was done. &amp; 2.—OMAN—MASK AT. Major C. G t P. Fagan, I.S.C., was Political Agent throughout the year and his report, which accompanies as Part II of this compilation, gives a fuli account of everything of importance that has occurred at Maskat. As recent events have been reported elsewhere to the Government of India and Maskat affairs are still unsettled, it seems undesirable for me to say much about them in this report. 3.—OMAN—PIRATE COAST. Affairs appe3r to have proceeded quietly on this coast during the past year, and there have been no casualties among the trucial Chiefs, I fully intended visitiog the coast during the winter, but more important work elsewhere prevented my doing so. It should, however, be visited next year as no Eesident has been there since 1896. It is reported that the uncle of the Sheikh of Shargah has given a long lease of some oxide mines to Baji Ali Dubash, also known as Nakhoda All Who is a resident of Bushire, where he got into trouble and had to leave. He is said to have already exported 400 tons of oxide, and a further enquiry into the concession will be made*when an opportunity offers. 4,—BAHREIN. Sheikh Isa has continued to be ruler and has enjoyed good health. I visited the place towards the close of the past financial year, and endeavoured to induce the Sheikh to improve his finances by adopting a better system of working his customs. Nothing definite has as yet been settled, and it is to be hoped that the Sheikh will eventually see his way to asking for the services of a British customs official. The position of the American-Arabian Mission at Bahrein gives cause for some anxiety, as some of its members do not appear to be as discreet as they should be, and there seems to be a feeling against the mission, probably due to the instigation of certain Turkish subieots who have settled in the place, and who have unfortunately acquired much influence over the Sheikh and his subjects. Although the members of this mission are not British subjects, it is impossible not to view their position without anxiety, or not to feel that the position we occupy at Bahrein obliges us to do what we can to protect them against danger. While I was at Bahrein, I took the opportunity to visit some remarkable mounds at a place called Ali about seven miles from Menamah, the chief town on the large island. There are apparently some hundreds of these mounds, of which a few have been partially explored. They are supposed to be pre-historic and to date back to early Phoenician times. I have not been able, however, to obtain much information regarding them, and an. organised scientific examination might give interesting results. 5.—NEJD. Abdul Aziz, a nephew of Mahomed bin Kasheed, the Amir of Jabal Shammar, succeeded his uncle at the end of 1897. It was stated that the sons of the late Sheikh of Koweit had enlisted the Shammar Sheikh on their side, and that he intended making a descent on Koweit with the object of ousting Sheikh Mobarek. In January last, Abdul Aziz was reported to be within three marches of Koweit itself, and his movements were watched with some anxiety by the people of the place. He appears, however, to have become involved in hostilities with some of the Bedouin tribes of that part of Arabia, and to have come to some understanding with Sheikh Mobarek, the latest accounts being that he is returning towards Nejd. Little is known of the present state of affairs in that part of Arabia, and it would be useful if and RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1898-99. 11 officer could be deputed to travel there and obtain information of what is going on. 6.—KOWEIT. Sheikh Mobarek has continued to be the ruler during the year under report. 'When I went to Koweit in January last, I had an interview with him at his house, and found him to be a venerable looking Arab Sheikh, of, I should say, between 55 and 60 years of age. It would, I think, be an advan tage if the British India steamers could visit Koweit, as the trade of the place has now to be carried to Mohammerah and there re-shrpped. This small independent Ghiefship will probably become a place of much import ance if the projects for railways connecting the Gulf and the Mediterranean, accounts of which have appeared in the papers, are carried out, and it seems desirable that British lines should be first in the field. The town is fairly clean, and as it is the chief outlet for the trade of that portion of Arabia, it may become a flourishing place in the near future. 7.—PERSIAN ARAB I STAN. Prom Koweit I proceeded up the Shat-el-Arab to Mohammerah, and had two interviews with Sheikh Khazal, brother of the late Sheikh !M!izal, whose death was referred to in last year's report. The present Sheikh received the title of Muez-es-Sultaneh from the Persian Government in April 1898, and he appears to have governed his district, on the whole, in an able manner, and has earned the good opinion of British firms trading to Mohammerah, who say that their interests are better looked after now than they were in the days of his brother, Sheikh Mizal. The Sheikh has been engaged, during the year, in various expeditions against Arab tribes within his jurisdiction, the most important of which was that against the Bawi tribe of Nasri, whose insurrec- tion at one time gave rise to some uneasiness. Sirdar Akrem continued to be Governor-General of Persian Arabistan throughout the year, but has since been relieved by Ain-ed-Dowleh. A riot occurred at Dizful early in the year, when several persons were killed The residents of one of the quarters of the town attacked the Deputy Governor of Dizful, who, however, was able to defeat them but had to leave Dizful soon after to avoid further fighting. The members of the Trench Mission at Suza have continued their explo rations, but appear to have suffered from the hostility of the Arabs of that vicinity. They went last summer to Ispahan, and intend spending the coming hot weather in the mountains north of Suza. Messrs Lynch Brothers were engaged throughout the year in the con struction of the road which is to connect Ahwaz with Ispahan. It will be a mule track and will shorten the land journey very considerably. Messrs. Lynch have various claims against the Persian authorities, but, on the whoie, their affairs are progressing favourably. 8.—PARS AND PERSIAN COAST. His Uoyal Highness the Airman Pinna, a near relation of the present Shah, was Governor-General of Pars when I visited Shiraz, and I had an opportu- nitv of seeing a good deal of him. He is an enlightened and well educated man, and his government o£ Pars was at first vigorous and successful, bub- sequently, however, the return to power of Mirza Ah Asghar Khan, the present Sadr -Azam, who is not favourably disposed to the Firman Pirma disgusted the latter, who repeatedly asked to be relieved of his post, and to he allowed to return to Tehran. This however did not suit those in power, and the Firman Krma remained at Shiraz for some months longer than he himself wished. Latterly he seems to have taken little interest in the conduct of affairs, with the result that disorders were nfe and iustice could not he [obtained. In January last, he was at last relieved by the Nizam -ul-Mulk, and came down to Bushire in February on his way to J B 212 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Kerbella, where he is gone nominally, on a pilgrimage, but really I believp into a sort of honourable exile. He proposes to remain there for some time ' The harvest in Pars was better this year than it has been for some timp back, as the locusts did not appear as early as usual. It is hoped that tli^ period of agricultural depression, which has now lasted for several years k about to end, and that a period of prosperity will succeed. Qnlf Ports. —There is not much to mention about the Gulf Ports with the exception of Lingah, the history of which has been interesting during 1898-99 Lingah was originally founded by the Jowasimi Arabs, whose Sheikhs ruled if* yielding more or less submission to the authority of Persia. Eventually thp Persians succeeded in obtaining the complete control of the place, and in 1887 the Sheikh of that time was captured and sent to Tehran, since which Lin^ah has been under Deputy Governors appointed by the Governor of Bushire. Last year, however, Sheikh Mahomed, a descendant of the former Arab Sheikha attacked Lingah, and easily got possession of it. No damage, to speak of* occurred to our subjects in consequence of this revolution, and it seemed likelv at one time that the Sheikh would establish himself finally in place of his ancestors, and that the Persian Government would accept the situation and acquiesce in the restored Arab rule. Such was not, however, the case as the Persians appear, throughout, to have been resolved to re-assert their authority Accordingly, in February last, the 'Persipolis ' went to Lingah conveying tliP Dana Begi and a small force. The Sheikh was led to believe that his obiect W J a \ t0 i re 1 C0Ver 1 f. rear s of ^venue, and when he had paid up the amount demand- ed, he believed himself safe and dismissed the greater portion of his followers An attack was then suddenly made and Lingah re-taken by the Persians* The Sheikh, however, made his escape, and has since been causing a great deal of anxiety to the Persians, as it is understood that he intends in turn to re-take the place, and it is probable that he may be assisted by his Arab kin^ men from the pirate coast. This will probably cause complications, in which we may be involved, as the Jowasimi Arabs comprise thesubiects of the trucial Chiefs, who are under our protection. The Persian attack on Lin^ah is said to have given rise to much looting in the bazars, and numerous claims for com pensation have already reached me. An incident which occurred daring the recent attack on Lingah requires notice. I allude to the removal by the Daria Begi of a flagstaff which had been erected over the house of an Agent recently appointed by the French. ! ^ ^ re - erected b y Haji Mirza Husein, the Dragoman of the Irench Vice-Consulate at Bushire, who went to Lin^ah for the nnr pose. 0 ^ The British India Steam Navigation Company, before the attack on Liu- gah, had made some arrangements with a contractor for the landin' of caraws at special rates. This clashed with the contract held by the old Hamal Bashi acd m the confusion which resulted from the capture of the place the company seems to have been put to some inconvenience. 1 believe, however, that matters are now on a better footing. ^P ort . ant case re garding the Island of Hormaz has recently been settled. contains valuable mines of red oxide of iron, and both Messrs. A. and T. J Malcolm and the Moin-ut-Tujar endeavoured to obtain a concession for working them. Both parties appear to have obtained the support of influential persons at Tehran, and to have spent a good deal of money in obtaining firmans and grants. Eventually the island has been given to the Moin-ut-iujar, who has had to pay Krans 98,000 to Messrs Malcolm as compensation. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. j D ^ tllave P 1 ' 0066 ^ more quietly during the past year than in 1897-98, and there is little to record. Asaf-ud-Dowlah, Governor ol IVorrnan, returned to that place from Bampur before the summer without etteoting much, but there has not been any further trouble amongst the Baluehis themselves. It was decided to make a fresh distribution of theHESIBENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1898-99. 13 subsidies by giving more to the headmen over whose lands the telegraph line actually passes, and less to the Chiefs. It was found that in the case of Geh, for instance, the Chief, who received Es. 3,000 a year, did little or nothing to protect the line, which runs through the property of various smaller men. It is hoped that the new arrangements will result in the lesser Chiefs considering themselves personally responsible for the safety of the line, which passes over their land, as well as for that of the telegraph employes and other Europeans who may have to go there. A Baluchi Chief, named Mowladad Khan, who has been appointed by the Persian Government as the Baluchi Governor of the district in place of Husein Khan, the Chief of Geh, as I have already men tioned, met Mr. Sealy at Charbar, when arrangements were made for the payment of claims of British Indian traders. Mir Abdi Khan, of Dashtiari, who gave so much trouble last year, and who repeatedly threatened to attack Charbar, was seized by the Persians and removed to the interior of Persia. The present District Officer, Mowladad Khan is a near relation of Abdi Khan, and he has made the release of the latter a condition for the payment of our claims, he, on his part, guaranteeing Abdi Khan's good behaviour in future. The matter is now being considered by the Legation. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. Little has been done in the way of seizing slave dhows during the past year, only one vessel was taken by the ' Sphinx ' in June 1898, and she had to be subsequently released on enquiry. The Sultan of Maskat has been advised to see that his subjects use a dis- tinctive Maskat flag, as there has been reason to think that some of them have been taking advantage of the protection of the flag of another European Power while engaged in carrying slaves. If His Highness succeeds in enforc ing the prohibition against the use of any flag other than his own, it should enable Her Majesty's ships to deal more efficiently with the slave trade than they have been able to do of late. There has been a good deal of correspondence regarding the manumission of slaves, and 14 persons applied to this Kesidency for manumission during the past year. Some of the applications are still under consideration. We are also arranging for the return of freed slaves to Africa. II.—PIRACY. No piracies took place on British Indian vessels during the year under report. This was chiefly due to the special measures adopted by the Govern ment of India in stationing a gunboat in the Shat-el-Arab during the date-sea son, when the Indian craft come up to buy dates. Owing to these measures, the Turkish and Persian authorities appear to have also stirred themselves, and special patrolling parties were organised for the safety of the river, with good results. 12.—ROYAL NAVY. During the early part of the year H. M. S.« Sphinx and' were in the Gulf. Both these ships left the Gulf in May, the former for Karachi and the latter for Trincomalee, H. M. S. ' La/punny^ taking their place. The ' Sphinx ' returned to the Gulf m June, and remained until Octo ber, when, on being relieved by H. M. S. ' left for Bombay for usual repairs. From Bombay she again came up in December, and was on the station up to the close of the year. The c ' Redbreast ' returned to the Gulf in October, and was placed on special duty in the Shat-el-Arab during the date-season.

Meade was confirmed in the post of Resident in the Persian Gulf on the 10th March 1898, and there have been no permanent changes in the personnel of the Residency during the past year. Captain P. Lumsden, I.M.S., Residency Surgeon, took furlough to England in ^May 1898, and Captain E. Wickham Hore, I.M.S., has acted for him, remaining at Bushire during the remainder of the year. In November 1898, Mr. J. P. Sequeira, the Uncovenanted Assistant to the Resident, went to India on two years' leave, and Mr. P. Candhy, the Head Clerk and Dragoman at Busrah, took his place. Lieutenant F. B. Prideaux, First Assistant Resident, took short leave to India, and the Residency Surgeon, with the approval of the Government of India, carried on his duties during his absence. 14.—OBSERVATORY. The results of the daily observations are recorded in a tabular statement marked appendix A. I M. J. MEADE, Political Bezident in the Persian Gulf,24 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL P art II.—ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MASK AT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. POLITICAL. The year under report has been one of exceptional tranquillity in the interior and is remarkable for the comparative absence of internecine wars among the tribes. Seldom has Oman enjoyed so long a period of tranquillity With the exception of a few murders in satisfaction of old blood f M i,u and the political murder hereafter alluded to, loss of life by violence W been rare. This quiet is partly attributable to the removal by death of several of the most troublesome of the tribal leaders, notably of Saiyid Ibrahim bin Keis, ot Rostak, and partly to the increase in the number of breech-loadiTiy weapons now in use in the country which has made raiding too daneerous an amusement to be lightly indulged in. s us an Fortune has favoured the Sultan by removing from his path his mnet dangerous and powerful enemies, but His Highness has failed to take advan- tage of the opportunity thus afforded him of improviag his position and strengthening his hold over his unruly subjects, and the few attempts he has made to interfere in the internal affairs of Oman have only resulted in loss ot prestige and in the exposure of his weakness and inability to exert his authority. Thus, for instance, in May news reached Maskat that Saiyid Ibrahim bin Keis was dead and that his son Saiyid Saeed had succeeded him but that he had been treacherously deprived of the Fort at Rostak and had been compelled to take refuge in tbe Hazm Fort, whither he was pursued and besaeged by Saiyid Saood bin Azzan, the second son of Imam Azzan bin Keis whom the Arabs and Sheikhs of the Rostak district had elected as their chief.' The Sultan supported Saiyid Saeed bin I bahim with money and sn™i;«. and directed Sheikh Kashid bin Uzaiz and War Suleiman bin Suweylim to proceed forthwith to he Batineh to restrain the Yal Saad and otl^T Hinarvi tribes residing m that neighbourhood from joining Saiyid Saood's force at an!' « u 86 ^ m tlle dis P ers al of the followers of Saiyid Saood and the Sultan would have been well advised to have remained satisfied with his success. But instead of doing this he unwisely allowed Suleiman bin Suweylim thi« nW t s i ? P ^ S T 0n of. R ostak on His Highness's behalf. To effect this object Suleiman bin Suweylim summoned tbe Ghatri tribes of Fania and ow to march towards Rostak, while he himself moved in the same direction from Hazm, but no sooner did the news of Suleiman's intentions reach he SSt ad wh^ ^\ W ^ a V ribeSthen , theyr0Se ^d poured into KosLk,and the Yal Saad ^10 had hitherto remained passive spectators showed si^ns of restlessness. Wall Suleiman was in consequence forced to forego his original intention and to remain on the defensive at Hazm. It is morally certain that the tribes whom this unwise policy had collected at Rostak would not under ordinary circumstances have returned to their homes without first looting the country ot other tribes residing in that neighbourhood, and it is unlikely that the Batineh would have escaped a similar fate. t &gt; 1 Th ^ r Sulta , n himself realized the danger and reinforced the sarrisons of Burka, Mesnah and Suweykh, but fortunately for His Highness the crisis was verted by the sudden death of the notorious Sheikh Hamood bin Saeed al Jahafee, one ofthe leaders at Rostak, a man who had taken part in every OnThe^ death nf Ti, 011 '?- th , e Sultans of Maskat for the .past 28 years. On the death of this individual dissensions arose amongst the remainino- Sheikhs, and as they could not come to any agreement respectinc their future movements the tribes gradually dispersed. 0 Saiyi ? 1 was 1 not fate( i to ™le long at Eostak, for on the 13th March Saiyid Hamood! 1 thlS chief liad been ordered by his elder brother,EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1898-99. 25 The Sultan's next intervention in the internal affairs of Oman was also unsuccessful. In July His Highness proceeded on a tour to Semail with the object of quietly effecting the seizure of the Sheikhs of the Mdabieen and Siahieen who have been defying his authority. After a protracted stay the Sultan issued a friendly invitation to the Sheikhs to pay him a visit, hut they were too wide awake to obey the summons, and the Sultan had eventually to return to Haskat unsuccessful and with great loss of prestige. In October Suleiman bin Suweylim, Wali of Sohar, extorted upwards of 7,000 dollars from the people under his jurisdiction. This high-handed action created much discontent at Sohar and the neighbouring places and was severely criticised by the principal Arab inhabitants of Maskat. In August the heads of the Khoja community waited on the Political Agent with a report of an outrage committed by certain Arabs on two British subjects on their way from Galla to Gobra. Eepresentations were made to His Highness Sayid Muhammad bin Turkee, in the absence of the Sultan in the interior, but without success, and no steps whatever were taken to arrest the culprits and bring them to j ustice. Between October and the close of the year frequent robberies took place in the towns of Maskat and Matrah, but no recovery of the stolen property could be effected in any instance owing to the defective measures adopted bj the local authorities to trace the culprits. The following incidents, regarding all of which special reports have been submitted, occurred during the year under report:— Mising of the Jeneheh at Sur. —In March 1898, Suleiman bin Suweylim, Governor of Sur, arrived at that place from Dhofar, and after summoning the Sheikhs of the Jenebeh he informed them that he did not intend in future to respect Jchafir (a system of safe conduct in vogue amongst the tribes). He then dismissed the Sheikhs and proceeded the same day to Maskat, leaving his son, a youth of 12, in charge of the Governorship. The Jenebeh were much incensed at the Suleiman's averred intention to disregard the ancient custom of khafir, but it is improbable that they would have taken any active steps to show their disapproval had reasonable tact been shown in dealing with them. But subsequent high-handed acts on the part of the Suleiman's son 5 coupled with an attempt on his part (under instructions from his father) to build a fort on a spot commanding at one time the water-supply of the town and the caravan route leading to the interior, so incensed the Jenebeh that the various sections of the tribe combined to protect their own interests. Their efforts in this direction were, however, marked throughout with commendable moderation. They commenced by sending a petition to the Sultan praying His Highness to stop the building of the fort and to remove Suleiman's son from the post of acting Wali. No notice was taken of thi# petition by the Sultan in the first instance, but subsequently His Highness sent his head writer Hamed to Sur to endeavour to effect a settlement. Hamed's mission proved a failure, but negotiations continued to be carried on till September, when the Jenebeh, finding their repesentations of no avail, took the law into their own hands and cut off the supplies of the garrison at the fort. On the 4jth October the tribe obtained possession of the fort by the surrender of the garrison, who with tne Wall's son were accorded all the honours of war, being escorted to the coast and shipped to Maskat. On receipt of this news the Sultan at first determined to equip an expedi tion for the punishment of the rebellious tribe, but finding that this would be impracticable on account of the expense of the undertaking and the strength of the Jenebeh, he ultimately acceded to their wishes and sent a new Wali and a fresh garrison to Sur, which were duly accepted by the Jenebeh, and the affair was thus peaceably settled. Imprisonment of Dhofar Chiefs.—On the 12th May a report was received that Sheikh Salim bin Hamad al Mahrooni had been treacherously arres ted at Dhofar and had been brought to Maskat and placed in irons in Fort Jellaly (Haskat). It was further reported that the arrest of this Sbeikh had\ 4 ' I 26 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL been instigated by Suleiman bin Suweylim out of revenge for the death of his son, who was killed by the Dhofar tribes in the late rebellion, which it will be remembered was quelled by the active assistance afforded to the Sultan by the Government of India. Eepresentations were made to the Sultan on behalf of the Sheikh and His Highness was reminded of the promise of pardon for past offences made in his name by his brother Saiyid Muhammad bin Turkee,. and it was pointed out that it was on this condition alone that the rebels had consented to return to their allegiance. In June a further report was received of the arrest at Dhofar of Sheikh Oomer bin^ Abdulla al Mahrooni, cousin of Sheikh Salim bin Hamad, also at the instigation of Suleiman bin Suweylim and for the same reasons, but on this occasion the prisoner was taken to Sohar^( Suleiman's head-quarters) and incarcerated in the fort there. Further representations were made to the Sultan on behalf of both these men, but for a long time without success. Both these men were, however finally released in December. Attempts to levy a punitive tax.~~ln July His Highness the Sultan notified to this Agency his intention of levying a punitive tax of 5 per cent, on the date produce of the tribes residing at Eostak and Wadi Maawal as a punish ment for the trouble they had been giving to His Highness for some time past. Three days later the proclamation regarding the extra tax was issued. As soon as the tax began to be levied complaints at once began to be made by British subjects, and on enquiry it transpired that the whole produce of these districts had already been bought up and paid for by certain Banians and that the proposed tax would fall not on the tribes whom it was desired to punish but on British traders. It was explained to the Sultan that a tax of this sort could only be levied after due and sufficient notice to traders had been given. His Highness at first remained obdurate, but ultimately after a corre spondence which lasted for some months, the obnoxious tax was repealed in September and the excess dues returned to those from whom they had been levied. Raid on British India traders at Shinas. —In March two British Indian traders, Khushaldas Mewaram and Seokhram Jessenmal, residents at Shinas, reported at this Political Agency that a raid had been made eleven or twelve days previously by a band of about 100 or 150 of the Beni Katab tribe, who had looted the complainants of $ 3,480 and $ 651J respectively, in cash and jewels, besides seriously wounding two of their servants. The Political Agent at once proceeded to the place in H. M. S. ' Sphinx' and found on enquiry that the complainants' statements were substantially correct, that the Naib Wali, Seif bin Mubarak Jebbari, and the garrison consisting of only two men had taken to flight as soon as the first shot was fired, and that although the complainants had sent early information of the occurrence to Suleiman bin Suweylim, Wali of Sohar, in whose jurisdiction Shinas lies, no notice whatever had been taken of the complaint nor had any attempt been made to institute enquiries into the matter. A communication was made on the 21st March to the Sultan, who was asked to state what steps he proposed to take to punish the offenders, to procure the restitution of the property robbed from the British Indian traders, and payment of compensation to the two wounded servants or, in the event of their death, to their families. No reply has as yet been received, GENERAL. On the 13th April a fire broke out in one of the shops in the bazar. Information was brought to the Political Agent. Prompt arrangements were at once made for the despatch to the spot of the detachment of the 21st Bombay Infantry on duty at the Agency and a party of blue jackets from H. M. S. ' Lapwing' by whose exertions the fire, which at one time threatened to be come serious, was soon got under.EESIDENCY AND MASK AT POLITICAL AGENCY FOi* THE YEAR 1898-99. 2 7 On the 23rd May another fire was reported to have taken place afc Bun der Jisseh, which resulted in the destruction of the whole village with the exception of seven huts. On the 3rd June a disastrous cyclone passed over Maskat and the adjacent country accompanied by heavy rain. Great loss occurred amongst the small craft at Matrah and other towns on the coast. Thousands of date and other trees were uprooted by the violence of the storm, and some damage was done to property in M askat and Matrah. The Political Resident in the Persian Gulf visited Maskat early in April in the R. I. M. S. 'Lawrence ' and again in February in the same vessel. The imposition of six days' quarantine on account of plague in India remained in force throughout the year, and though the arrangements made by the Local Government were very defective, the country is nevertheless still free of this scourge. NAVY. Maskat was visited during the year by Her Majesty's ships 'Sphinx,' 'Figeon' ' Redbreast' and Lapwing'' Eear- Admiral Douglas also visited Maskat in February in his Plagship the' Eclipse.' „ j Foreign navies were represented by the French Gunboat u Scorpion and German Cruiser cs Arcona.' SLAVE TRADE. In June a pearl-fishing dhow, bound from Khaburah to Bahrein, was seized by Commander Baker of H. M. S. 'Sphinx ' and brought in for adjudica tion in the Consular Court at Maskat, having Vice-Admiralty jurisdiction The Court on enquiry found that there was no evidence to prove that the Nakhoda was aware at the time of his departure from Khaburah of the slave's presence on board, and he and his vessel were released. The slave was duly liberated and his owner handed over to His Highness the Sultan for punishment. In December an African slave-boy, Ferooz bin Mabrooh, who had been liberated at this Consulate, was reported to have been re-enslaved by a Persian subiect named Abdul Hasul bin Ibrahim, of Bunder Abbas. Further enquiry confirmed the truth of the report, and steps were taken which resulted m the boy being again set at liberty. At the same time the matter jas repo^ed/o the Political Resident with a view to punishment being meted out to Abdul Basul by the Persian authorities. During the year under report 105 fugitive slaves took refuge in the Con sulate. Of these, 89 were manamitted underthe stipulations of the Treaty of 1873, and 16 left the protection of the Consulate and fonnd their way to Africa or India before their cases were enquired into by His Highness the Sultan. ~~ Commander Baker, H. M. S. 'Sphinx,' freed under the Brussels Conference Act two slaves who had taken refuge on board the vessel under his command. OFFICIAL CHANGES. Major C. G. F.

Until th,e export of grain is permitted, trade must languish, but if the prohibition is withdrawn, there is certain to be a marked and rapid revival of trade, as the condition of the country is undoubtedly fairly pros perous, and, owing, no doubt, to fall in prices, crime of all sorts has apparently decreased, the routes to the interior being safer than they have been tor some time back. It is to be hoped, therefore, that the Persian Government will shortly remove the prohibition, and permit the exportation of food-stuns. The Governorship of JBushire. —The Darya Begi has held the Governoi- ship during the past year, and our relations with him have throughout been friendly. There has, however, been great difficulty in disposing of claims for compensation, both here and at other ports in the Persian Gulf, the Governor having steadily evaded compliance, on one excuse or anotner, with our demands in this respect. The farming out of the ' Hamal-Bashiship 3 and of preventive measures against the introduction of plague, has given rise to many abuses, m regard to which, it has been almost impossible to obtain any satisfactory settlement from the Governor. It is said that he is financed by the well- known Moin-ut-Tujar, who is said to have regained much of his former influence at Tehran. Public Peace and Tranquillity.—The past year has again been remarkably free from violent crime, and there is little to record in this respect. On the 29th of April the Persian post was attacked near Shiraz and plundered at theADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL instigation, it is said, of Soelat-es-Sultaneb, the Il-Regi of the Kashkai tribe of Nomads, who were then encamped near Shiraz. The robbers were, however Icrcepted and the mails were recovered. On the 27th of May the Persian post was attacked near Dalaki by a party of Tangistanis, who carried away the parcels, but not the letters. The robbers exchanged shots with the mail guards, one man being killed on each side. A third attack was made on the Persian pos' near Shiraz, early in November, when a considerable amount of money and supply bills are said to have been taken. I have not heard if anything has been recovered in these two last cases. Beyond these isolated instances, the road between this and Shiraz has been free of serious crime. Public Health and Measures to prevent the Introduction of Plague and Cholera into the Persian Gulf. —The past season has not been altogether a healthy one, as plague appeared at Bushire, and there were severe outbreaks of cholera during the summer at Gwadur and Maskat, to both of which places the disease appeared to have been brought from Karachi, where it appeared in a severe form in May, June, and July. Subsequently cholera broke out at Basrah, and reports were received of occasional cases in various parts of Arabistan. It has disappeared entirely in this part of the Gulf, and no cases occurred at Bushire itself, but it still lingers on the Oman Coast. Plague was discovered at Bushire in the beginning of June, and there is reason to think that there were several cases before that, as the death-rate was considerably above normal during the time that it is supposed to have been present. It will be seen from the statement given in the margin that for the mouth In Juue 1899 there were . . .53 deaths. ^reported deaths, from all 37 „ causes, were 53, that in July they had fallen to 37, and in August to 31. In the three succeeding months there was a slight rise, probably due to change of season, and fever in consequence ; but in Janu- July August September October November December January . * , * * * * ' ary and February, the number of deaths leil again, and the average death-rate for Bushire appears to be about 34 per mensem, or 408 per annum, which, as the population of Bushire is supposed to be about 20,000 souls, gives an annual death-rate of 21 per mille. These gures are only approximate and not reliable, no census having ever been taken, and all deaths certainly not being reported. The information we now have will, however, probably be useful in future, should any abnormal rise in the death-rate indicate the presence of plague or other disease. The summer lie at put an end to the plague, of which no suspected cases have been heard of th^^th 6 August ksf 1 ^' JSusll ' e was ^ orma % declared free of plague on There was a good deal of sickness in Bushire amongst Europeans towards the close of the hot weather, and several cases of fever of a malignant type u e ir no deaths amongst adults except in the case of Mr. Campbell, Manager of the Imperial Bank of Persia, who succumbed to an attack of fever on the 12th September. Mr. Campbell's early death was a great loss to the small European community of Bushire. Pla y™ e , ® l ° ts 0 \ When the Besidency Surgeon discovered early ll t P la ? u ® had appeared in Bushire, he recommended that measures should be taken with the object of stopping its spread, and, if possible, stamp- mg it out m those quarters where it had already gained a footing. Captain ilaimer, l.M.b and two Assistant Surgeons were deputed from India to assist in the preparation of a scheme and in its execution, if approved, by the Persian Government. The knowledge of these measures, while in contemplation, excited considerable opposition among the Muhammadan population of the place, an a ie en o J uly, an organized demonstration was got up to oppose them. People closed their shops, and assembled daily in the mosques, while they Were r- 'by the Mollas. Some ill-feeling was shewn against such members ot the Eesidency as were supposed to be taking an active part in lorwardmg plague measures, and at length this feeling took the form of a demonstration being made against the Eesidency itself, by a party of boys and ads e by a few well known unruly characters, who had fomented the oppositionRESIDENCY AND MASK AT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1800. 3 to plague measures in the hope of obtaining plunder for themselves. The mob were dispersed by the Governor, who subsequently punished the leaders in various ways; but there is some reason to think that he did not, at first, dis courage the opposition to plague measures as strongly as he might have done, as he was afraid that, if carried out, they might entail considerable cost to himself. Preventive measures for keeping plague out of Bushire have been throughout in hands of Captain E. Wickham Hore, I.M.S., who has done his utmost to have them efficiently carried out, in accordance with the spirit of the Venice Convention. A disinfector, with a disinfecting apparatus, has been obtained from Bombay, but there has been considerable delay in its erection, and, though it arrived at the end of September, it is not yet working. This delay is partly due to the procrastinating habits of Persians, and the difficulty in getting the Government to sanction the necessary expenditure, but it has also been due to the views expressed by the Governor, who seemed doubtful, at first, if its erection would not lead to further disturbances. The structure on the quarantine island, where the machine will be worked, is now nearly complete, and I am in hopes that it will shortly be in full use. In the mean time, passengers' personal baggage has been disinfected, as far as possible, by exposure to the sun and wind. Soon after preventive arrangements were started here, we were asked by the Persian Government to quarantine cargoes, and, though numerous representations have been made through the Legation, pointing out that such a course is unnecessary, except in the case of susceptible articles we have not up to the present been able to get the order withdrawn, and all cargoes are kept under supervision till the full period of quarantine has expired. This has, no doubt, been insisted on, as fees are levied from each package, the collection being farmed out as is done with every similar impost in Persia. The matter has repeatedly been brought to the notice of Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran. Detention of arrivals at Bushire has caused a great deal of inconvenience and hardship to Europeans, as the Persian Government made no suitable arrangements for European passengers, who have been exposed, at times, to the extremes of heat and cold with very insufficient protection. In July, it was decided, under the orders of the Government of India, that it was unnecessary to send 1st and 2nd class passengers, arriving by mail steamers, to the island and that it would be sufficient if such passengers were merely called on to present themselves daily for examination. The distinction between 1st class and 2nd class and deck passengers excited, however, some feeling amongst the Persians, and in consequence of representations made to Her Majesty's Representative at Tehran, the arrangement was allowed to lapse, all passengers having to go to the Quarantine Station. Currency.—1 regret to sa^ that nothing has been done to improve the currency of Southern Persia which remains in the unsatisfactory condition noticed in my report last year. The ee Bijecks ' or notes issued by the Bushire Trading Company, having partly been called in, there appears to be some prospect of the Bushire Trading Company being eventually put an end to. Arrangements of the Custom Jtlouse, —I reported last year the assumption by the Imperial Bank of Persia of the management of the Bushire Customs and the subsequent withdrawal of the Bank control in consequence of the repayment by the Persian Government of the loan made by the Bank. Since then the Customs have been farmed by the Darya Begi, who has sublet the Hamal-Bashiship, or control of lighters and porters, to various individuals, whose sole object has been to make as much as they can out of their conces sion ; the result has been that complaints of thefts and pilferings have been incessant, and it has been very difficult to obtain any satisfaction from the Governor, whose creatures the Hamal-Bashis are. On the 21st of March 1900 the control of the Customs were taken under direct management, being worked by Belgian officials serving under the Persian Government. It is stated that they will not, at first, enhance the rate for native-owned goods, or interfere with vested interests, and if this is the case, the new arrangements may turn out satisfactory and increase the revenue of the Persian Government, without exciting much opposition. Settlement of Claims for Compensation, —I regret to report that, in spite of incessant efforts, we have been able to do very little towards the settlement4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL of the numerous claims against the Persian Government on the part of British subjects and proteges, some of which have been pending for years. I have addressed the Government of India and Her Majesty's Minister at 'Tehran on this subject, as my experience shews that it is hopeless to expect the local authorities to dispose of these claims in a satisfactory manner, unless they receive distinct orders to do so from the Central Government. T urs during the year. —After my return from Maskat and Bahrein in the beginning of March 1899 I remained at Bushire till the middle of August, when I was allowed to go to Karachi, from which 1 returned on the 20th September. In October I went to Bahrein, and at the end of -that month left for Ahwaz, where I met Her Majesty's Minister, Sir H. M. Durand, who had travelled down from Tehran to inspect the Ahwaz-Ispahan route. Soon after wards I started on a tour along the Arab Coast, visiting Bahrein a second time, and meeting nearly all the Trucial Chiefs and the Sultan of Maskat. On my return journey I visited Bunder Abbas and Bassidore. I have recently paid a short visit to Mohammerah, and saw Sheikh Khazal and Mr. McDouall, the Vice-Consul. 2,—OMAN—MASKAT. Major C. G. TV Fagan, I.S.C., was Political Agent up to the 27th September, when he was relieved by Captain P Z. Cox, who has held charge for the rest of the year. Captain Cox's report has not yet reached me : but will follow in due course, and, as the records of this office contain exhaustive reports from both officers, I may mention that the principal events at Maskat have been briefly as follows :— At the beginning of the financial year, the Sultan's subsidy was being withheld in consequence of certain events which had taken place during the previous year, and payment was not renewed until November, when the subsidy for the previous month was paid by Captain Cox, in consequence of His Highness's improved relations with the British authorities, and the difficul ties which he was experiencing for want of ready money to meet urgent calls upon him. I visited Maskat in December, and was able to recommend the prospective renewal of the subsidy which has been in consequence sanctioned by the Government of India. There have been constant negotiations goino* on between Her Majesty's Government and that of the French Republic with' the object of deciding a site for a Erench coal-shed in Maskat harbour. This point is still unsettled. The question of the right of certain Maskat dhows to fly the Prench flao 1 has also formed the subject of much enqni£j|^nd discussion of late. No definite arrangement has, however, yet been^rrived at, and it is not unlikely that the flag of the French Republic is usedjio protect those engaged in the slave trade, as well as in the traffic in arms. There has been a considerable importation of arms into Maskat during'the past year, and there is reason for thinking that they are imported thence to Pundsr Abbas and other places in Persia as well as to Koweit and various otlffer ports on the Arab side of the Gulf.^ It has not, up to the present, been found possible to entirely put an end to this traffic, but the measures taken two years ago have undoubtedly reduced it to a very great extent. The arms seized from the S. S. ^Baluchistan have been lying at the Consulate throughout the year. They will probably be handed over shortly to His Highness the Sultan. Maskat and the neighbouring districts have suffered greatly from the ravages of cholera, and there has also been some plague, the first reported cases of which occurred in April 1899. They were imported, and the disease at that time could gain no foothold in the place. Recently, however, it has re appeared, and it looks as if it would establish itself on the Oman Coast, Every effort has been made by the British authorities to assist the Sultan in dealing with this important matter, and it is to be hoped that the efforts being made will prove successful. Cholera appears to have been brought to Maskat from Gwadur, where it was virulent in July and the beginning of August. There is considerable trade between the two places, and it was not likely that MaskatEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1899-1900. 5 would eventually escape, thoush at first it did so. Unlike plague, an outbreak of cholera is, as a rule, sudden and spreads with rapidity from the first, and reports show that the epidemic in Maskat, Matrah, and the surrounding districts in the interior, was, from the first, a severe one. About 500 deaths are reported to have occurred at Maskat and Matrah, and it is said that some thousaDds have perished in the interior. The exact number will, of course, never be known. 3.—OMAN—PIRATE COAST. T was able to visit this portion of my political charge during the winter, and, after interviewing Sheikh Ahmed bin Thani, a brother of the notorious Sheikh Jasim, at El-Wakra, a town close to El-Obeyd, the Turkish head quarters on the El-Hasa peninsula, I went to Shargah and subsequently met the Chiefs of Shargah, Debay, Ras-el-Khyma, and Um-el-Kowain. I did not see the Chief of Abu Thabi as he was ill at the time, but met his sons, and Wazir, or Secretary, with whom I discussed various pending cases in which Abu Thabi is concerned. The most important question pending at present on the Arab Coast is con nected with the expulsion of the Persians from Lingah by Sheikh Muhammad, which was mentioned in last year's report, and the subsequent re-capture of the place by the Darya Bogi.^ Sheikh Muhammad, and his principal adviser, Saiyid Yusuf, effected their escape and took refuge with their Jowasimi kins men. The Persian Government declare that a fresh descent on Lingah is contemplated by these Arabs, and they have asked us to arrange for the surrender of Sheikh Muhammad and his followers. There is nothing to show that any such intentions exist at present, bat the Jowasimi Arab Sheikhs complain that, after the re-capture of Lingah, much property of theirs, which had nothing to do with Sheikh Muhammad, was confiscated by the Darya Begi. The matter is still under consideration. A curious case has arisen on this Coast in consequence of the discovery of a pearl of great value in one of the pearl banks near Kumzar. It appears that it was sold^by the finders for much less than it realized subsequently, and important questions of Muhammadan and local commercial law have been raised in consequence. The Sultan of Maskat and several of the Arab Sheikhs are interested in the matter, which seemed likely at one time to give rise to serious complications, and is, in fact, not yet settled. Small-pox has been prevalent on the Arab Coast; but there have not, as far as I am aware, been any ^ises of cholera or plague. None of the Trucial Chiefs have died during th^feai- under report, and there is nothing special to mention regarding them. 4.-BAH REIN. The attitude of Sheikh Esa, of Bahrein, has not been altogether satisfactory. He objected to the adoption of precautionary measures against plague when it appeared in Bushire, and has shewn himself averse to obtaining our assistance in the management of his customs, which are farmed out to a Syndicate of Banias, for much less than they would bring, if properly managed. The Sheikh promised that he would not enter in any fresh arrangement with the Banias without first consulting the Residency, but I found, when I visited Bahrein last, that he had given them a further lease for two years. In Sept ember, a serious outrage was committed on some British Indian subjects by the Sheikh's writer, a man named Sharida, who, with his son, wounded two Banias. The Sheikh, at first, was averse to dealing with this case, but eventually fined the culprits R 1,000, and banished them from Bahrein. Considerable difficulties have been experienced in the discharge of cargoes from the mail steamers of the British Indian Steam Navigation Company, and much pilfering of property lodged in the Amara or Customs godown has been complained of. The Government of India decided, in consequence of these alicl other questions, they should be better represented than heretofore at Bahrein, and it6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL was intended to send an officer from the Political Department there in place of Aga Muhammad Rahim, onr Native News Agent, whose health was failing, and who had exceeded the age limit of fifty-five years. Before this could be done, however, Aga Muhammad Rahim died at Bushire, where he had come to obtain medical advice, and under the orders of the Government of India, Mr. Gaskin, Extra Assistant to the Resident and Yice-Consul, has been deputed to Bahrein, as a temporary measure, without vacating his permanent appoint ment. Aga Muhammad Rahim had done much useful work for the Residency, but he had been for some time in failing health, and could not attend properly to his duties. 5.—EL-NEJD. We have heard very little of the state of affairs in that part of Arabia, a nd I would repeat the observation made in last year's report, recommendino' that some one should be deputed to travel there and obtain information of what is going on. 6.—KOWEIT. In August last, it was understood that the Ottoman Government intended establishing their authority at Koweit under the guise of preventive measures against plague. It was stated that a Turkish Harbour Master would be sent to Koweit, but the Sheikh objected, and the matter was not^pressed. Lately Koweit has been visited by German and Russian officials. The German party consisted of the Consul-General at Constantinople, and a survey party con nected with the projected railway to Basrah, which, it is believed, will be prolonged to Koweit,,. which is the best harbour in the Persian Gulf. The Germans marched overland and returned the same way; but the Russians who have subsequently gone there, used a Russian gun-boat Gilyak, which has recently been visiting various parts of the Persian Gulf. I have not been myself to Koweit during the year under report, but it has been visited occa sionally by British men-of-war, and by the R. I. M. S. Lawrence. The Sheikh appears to have enjoyed good health, and nothing particular has occurred. 7.—PERSIAN AHABISTAN. I went to Ahwaz in November, and met Sir H. M. Durand, Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran, who had travelled via Ispahan over the new trade route connecting that place and the Karun river. I was accompanied by Mr. W. McDouall, Her Majesty's Vice-Consul, Mohamnierah, and Mr. A. B. Taylor' one of the partners of Messrs. Lynch Brothers, who had met the Minister on his way, was also present. Various questions connected with the navigation of the Karun and the opening up of the river and land routes were discussed Sir Mortimer Durand had interviewed all the leading Bakhtiari Chiefs, through whose territory the road passes, and had explained the advantages which would probably result to them and their people from it, when it is once in full use. I gathered that the want of forage is at present an obstacle, and that the* muleteers, who are now plying on the Ispahan-Shiraz and Bushire route, are reluctant to adopt a new one, on which it seems doubtful if they will obtain supplies for themselves, and their animals, and protection against attacks by the wild mountaineers who inhabit the Bakhtiari country. After a few days at Ahwaz, Sir H. M!. Durand proceeded in the Persian river boat, the Shushan to Shuster, from which he returned vid Dizful to Tehran. At the same time' I returned to Mohammerah, and took a message from Sir Mortimer Durand to the Sheikh, who had not been able to meet His Excellency at Ahwaz. The Sheikh was anxious about his position, should the Persian Government decide on establishing a Custom House at Mohammerah. This forms part of the general scheme for improving Customs arrangements throughout Persia, which have been placed under the control of some Belgian officials, employed by His Majesty the Shah, and it is not clear how Mohammerah and the Karun can be exempted. Some of the Belgians referred to arrived from Europe towards the end of February, and, as it was reported that they would commence working the customs from the 21st March; the Nove-rooz, or Persian NewRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 7 Year's Day, the Sheikh became anxious and consulted Mr. McDouall, who informed me, and I have, in consequence, paid another visit to Mohammerah, and ascertained the Sheikh's views. From our point of view, any action on the part of the Persian Government which may disturb the existing state of things is undesirable, as it may give rise to a condition of affairs which would hamper, if it did not entirely put a stop to, our trade with the interior. I am o-lad, therefore, to hear that no steps will be taken for the establishment of a Custom House until His Majesty the Shah returns from Europe. At present the prospects in Arabistan are exceedingly flourishing, and if the embargo on export of wheat is removed, the prosperity of the district should rapidly increase. 8.—FARS AND PERSIAN COAST. The Eirman Eirma was succeeded as Governor-General of Ears by the Kizam -ul-Mulk who has remained in power throughout the year. There have been the usual quarrels and complaints of mal-administration from Shiraz, but there is nothing particular to report regarding affairs there # which have been on the whole normal. Gulf Forts, —Lingah has remained in the hands of the Persians through out the year, and nothing special has occurred there. We have been endeavour ing to obtain compensation for the losses sustained by the British Indian subjects during the attack on the place, but up to the present no satisfactory settlement has been arrived at, and the matter has been referred to Tehran. Some attention has been drawn of late to the important harbour of Bunder Abbas, and Lieutenant Hunt, I.S.C., has been appointed Political Assistant and Her Majesty's Yice-Oonsul at that place. Lieutenant Hunt, after landing at Bunder Abbas on his way up the Gulf, came here to receive instructions for starting his Vice-Consulate. He is now living at Bunder Abbas, but will pro bably spend much of his time in the interior, as his Consular jurisdiction extends from Bunder Abbas to Yezd and the trade route will require much attention. 9.—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. There has not been much to record on this Coast during the year under report, but the death of Mowladad Khan, who was murdered in June last, has delayed the settlement of our claims for compensation. It is generally supposed that Mowladad Khan's death was instigated by his rival, Husain Khan, the Chief of Geh; ,but nothing very definite has transpired. Mr. Sealy visited the Coast when making bis final tour of inspection in December last. He was relieved of his appointment of Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, in the beginning of January by Mr. H. Whitby-Smith, formerly of the Indian Telegraph Department, who has recently been up the Gulf in the Patrick Stewart. Mr. Whitby-Smith visited Charbar and saw Said Khan, son of Hosain Khan, who professed himself willing to seize the two murderers of Mr. Graves, who are still at large, provided his subsidy is paid. It was explained to him that the subsidy would, in future, be reduced to E1,000 a year, the balance going to the local headmen, and Said Khan expressed himself willing to take that amount, provided he received a paper to the effect that he is not getting any more. He explained that the Persian Government make the local Gov ernor pay the subsidy he receives from the Telegraph Department to them, and that it appears regularly as an item of income. As the Persian Government receive E12,000 from the Department for the general protection of the line, it seems unreasonable that they should also take the allowances given to the petty Chiefs, and I have addressed Her Majesty's Minister at Tehran on the subject, recommending that the Central Government should not interfere in regard to the arrangements between the Telegraph Department and the Baluch Chiefs. Mr. Whitby-Smith is at present visiting the Makran Coast on his way to Karachi, after having discussed all matters of importance with me at Bushire. I have not yet received a report of his proceedings.8 ADMINISTRATION EE PORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL There have been rumours of an intended revolt against the authority of the Shah in Persian Baluchistan, but no definite information has reached me and I should say that it is doubtful if any combination of the Baluchi will be carried out. Their interests are too antagonistic, and the Persians are adept at playing off one tribe against the other. Mir Abdi Khan, of Dashtiyari, whose arrest was reported last year, has returned to his district, and has given assurances of future good behaviour. It is probable that he will be re-instated in the Chiefship, as he is the most influential person in that part of Makran. 10.—SLAVE TRADE. No capture of slaves has been made during the year under report, but several slaves have received manumission from the British authorities. The question of a distinctive flag for Maskat dhows is still unsettled. 11.—PIRACY. Four cases of piracy occurred during the year. The vessels attacked were British Indian, Persian, and Bahreini, and the crimes were committed on the Arab Coast, not far from Bahrein itself. Enquiries, I made, showed that they were not, strictly speaking, piratical attacks at sea; but were committed by Bedouins, and other landsmen, when the dhows attacked were stranded on the Coast. A portion of the property takeU has been recovered through the instrumentality of the Sheikh of El-Wakra, who promised to endeavour to get the rest. This matter should not be lost sight of. Owing to the efforts of Sheikh Khazzal of Mohammerah, and the presence of British gunboats in the Shatt-el-Arab, there were no cases of piracy in that river or in the Karun. 12.—NAVY, There have been several British men-of-war in the Gulf during the past year. At first the Sphinx remained at Maskat and the Lapwing was at Bushire. Subsequently they changed places, and the Figeon also arrived at Bushire, remaining here till the beginning of September, during which time her crew suffered greatly from the heat, and a number had to be landed at the' Telegraph Office at Beshire. Thewhich had gone down to Maskat. for a change, then relieved the Pigeon and remained till the arrival of the cruiser Melpomene under the command of Captain J. Denison, R.N., who was Senior Naval Officer of the Persian Gulf Division till January, when the Pomone under Captain Simons relieved her. At present the ships in the Gulf are the Vomone, the Sphinx, the Lapwing, and Pigeon. The only foreign man-of-war that has entered the Gulf during the year has been the Russian river-gunboat Gilyak, which has visited Bunder Abbas, Bushire, Mohammerah, Basrah, and Koweit. It is, I believe, the first appearance of a Russian war-ship in these waters, and her arrival excited some comment among the Persians. 13.—OFFICIAL CHANGES. Lieutenant-Colonel M. J. Meade, C.I.E., held charge of the office of the Resident, Persian Gulf, during the year. Lieutenant F. B. Prideaux, First Assistant, was relieved by Mr. W. S. Davis on the 17th March, and, as Captain P. J. Lumsden, Residency Surgeon, has been transferred on his return from furlough to an appointment in India, Captain E. Wickham Hore, LM.S., was confirmed in the post of Residency Surgeon. Mr. J. C. Gaskin, Extra Assistant Resident, has been deputed, as a temporary measure, to Bahrein. Mr. P. J. Gandhy, while continuing to officiate for Mr. J. P. Sequeira, still on leave, was appointed Head Clerk in place of Mr. A. Paes, who resigned the service, in consequence of ill-heath. Captain N. Rainier, Indian Medical Service, was specially deputed to assist the Residency Surgeon in dealing with plague questions about which he had obtained considerable experience at Karachi and elsewhere in India. He arrived at Bushire on the 28th June with two Military Assistant Surgeons, Messrs. Beale and Kirkpatrick, and drew2&gt;i' RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1899-1900. 9 up a detailed scheme for dealing with plague. As the disease has died out, Captain Banner's services not being required here, he returned to Karachi on the 19th February. 14.—CHANGES AMONG FOREIGN REPRESENTATIVES. The personnel of the Consular representatives of other European Powers has been completely changed during the year. Dr. Robert Hauke, the German Consul, went on leave to Europe in June, and was succeeded by Dr. Reinhardt, ^ho came here from Egypt. Dr. Eeinhardt went to Shiraz for the hot weather, and has made a trip to the Karun during the winter. He contemplates pro ceeding shortly on furlough to Europe, and it is doubtful if the post will be immediately filled up. M. Bryois, the French Vice-Consul, went to France in August, and has not yet returned. The work of the Consulate has been carried on by the Dragoman, Mirza Husain. Mr. H. C. Vander Zee, of Messrs. J. 0. P. Hotz &amp; Son, who was Consul for the Netherlands at Bushire, has been trans ferred to Ahwaz, Mr. Moesmann, of the same firm, taking his place. 15.—OBSERVATORY.

The year under report has been marked by little or nothing worthy of record in the political annals of Oman. During the first-half of it, rumours of the rising of tribesmen and the restlessness of Bedouins generally in the interior were indeed from •time to time rife, but as is so often the case, they proved to be bubbles which one after another burst harmlessly, and the second-half of the year happily passed off with unprecedented tranquillity, owing perhaps to the fact that the decimating ravages of cholera and small-pox all over the interior and the subsequent prevalence of plague in Maskat turned the atten tion of the population generally to the preservation of their own lives, and had a sedative effect upon the capacity of the turbulent for preying upon their neighbours. On the 1st April the Sultan instructed Sheikh Suleiman bin Suweilim, his Wali at Sohar, to undertake an expedition against the Beni Katab who had a short time before, as mentioned in last year's report, raided the small port of Shinas on the Batineh Coast, and had maltreated and looted two British Indian traders. The object of the expedition was both to punish the marauders and to obtain from them compensation for the losses sustained by these British subjects. The Sultan's intention, however, reached the Beni Katab in time to enable them to enlist the aid of the Naeem and Mokabil clans, and as Suleiman bin Suweilim's force was not strong enough to cope with the above combina tion, the expedition proved abortive. It is satisfactory to note, however, that the Sultan has since paid without question the whole of the amount of compen sation (4I31| dollars) claimed by the two Banians. On the 4th Sheikh Eashid bin Uzaiz, the Governor of Semail, reported to the Sultan that he has re-appointed Sheikh Khalfan bin Thenayan, Sheikh and Wali of Nakhl. The Sheikh, who was deposed in 1897 for certain disturb ances referred to in the Administration Eeport for 1897*98, had eluded the pursuit of the men sent by the Sultan to arrest him and had since continued to make trouble at Nakhl. The Sultan acquiesced in his re-appointment, how- ever, apparently because it enabled him to withdraw the 130 Wahabis whom he had sent to garrison Nakhl and whom he could ill spare from Maskat. On the 11th April the inhabitants of Nezwa petitioned the Sultan to recall his Wali on the ground that he was practising oppression and injustice, and a short time afterwards news was received that the community were preparing to rise against the Wali unless action was speedily taken from head quarters. The Sultan, therefore, after enquiry into the trufh of the accusations against his official, dismissed him and appointed Sayyid Nasir bin Muhammad in his stead ; the garrison, however, mostly consisting of the relatives of the dis missed Wali, refused to surrender the fort to the Sultan's garrison sent in advance of Sayyid Nasir bin Muhammad, the newly appointed man. The Sultan considering it inexpedient to eject the garrison by force, and bemgade- quately assured of the future good conduct of the garrison and the ex-Wall, retained them and reinstated the latter and recalled Sayyid Nasir. On the 16th news was received to the effect that Sheikh Suleiman bin Seif er Eiami Sahib of Jebel Akder had been murdered by his nephew Sheikh Hameyr in revenge for the murder of the latter's father and mother some fifteen years before by Sheikh Suleiman. This was followed by the news on the 25th instant of the murder of Sheikh Sultan bin Saeed of the al-Wahibeh by the Jenebeh of the ed-Dahireh in retaliation for non-payment ot some blood money due to them. Both these Sheikhs were most influential and exercised great power for good or ill over the tribesmen of the interior. eir exit from the stage of Oman politics will have an important effect in insuring tranquillity in the interior. In May persistent rumours of a rising of Sharkiyeh tribesmen were current; the Sultan therefore increased the garrison at Seeb and recalled ail the Wahabi garrison of the Coast towns to Maskat. On the 2/th, he b lei18 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL of the al-Wahibeh having written to the Suitan that should His Highness discontinue to give his tribe their usual presents they would raid on and loot any place they could lay their hands on, the Sultan sent a further re-inforce- ment of armed sowars to strengthen the garrison of Seeh which it was supposed would be the rendezvous of the mal-gontents. Nothing, however, occurred till the 22nd July, when a handful of Sharki- yeh Bedouins with the aid of some of the Siabieen, though not strong enough to attack the town and bazaar, raided the house of a wealthy Balooch merchant killed its owner and looted the premises before the Sultan's garrison appeared on the scene. The latter put the marauders to flight killing four of their number and five camels, while the pursuers had one of their ifien killed and two slightly wounded. At the request of the Sultan who feared a more serious raid on Seeb, the British subjects were directed to remove themselves with their valuables for a time which they did. His Highness at the same time provided the garrison with a large supply of ammunition. Nothing further however, occurred to disturb the peace of the place. On the 29th June news reached Maskat that some Bedouins of the Sharkiyeh under the leadership of a notorious robber named Muhammad bin Suleiman Muskaree had committed a raid on the bazaar at Kurriyat, 18 miles south of Maskat, the previous day, and on 30th four British Indian Banian traders arrived at the Consulate and confirmed the news. The Sultan imme diately sent a large force to punish the raiders who, however, had left the place with their loot before their arrival. The claims of the traders after careful verification were presented to the Saltan by the Political Agent on 11th December 1899, and were settled by him forthwith. On the 15th July the Sultan ordered the levy of punitive tax upon the produce brought to coast towns by the Rahbieen who were known to be defeat ing the object of that tax by passing into Matra as their own tax-free produce, the goods of persons under the ban. The Eahbieen thereupon closed Akk Pass to all Kafilahs to and from the interior, and were soon imitated by the Siabieen who closed Khaza Pass in retaliation for the imprisonment of six of their tribes men who had shortly before been arrested by the Wali of Kurryat and sent in irons to Maskat. The trade routes being closed trade came to a practical standstill by which the Customs farmer was a heavy sufferer: he therefore threatened to throw up the Customs farm unless the Sultan arranged to open the roads. The Sultan accordingly ordered Sheikh Rashid bin Uzaiz, the Gov ernor of Semail, to arrange for the opening of the passes, which he succeeded in doing by giving the Sheikhs their usual presents. On the 18th July news was received that Wali Suleiman bin Suweilim had been wounded and two of his men killed in a fight with the Mokabil, which had been brought about by the latter refusing to surrender two of their tribesmen who had escaped from confinement in the fort of Sohar. The Moka bil were aided by the Beni Ali and the Wali therefore cut down a number of date trees of the latter. A month afterwards the Beni Ali mustered in great force near Sohar and threatened an attack on Wali Suleiman, and at the same time sent a letter to the Sultan informing His Highness that they have only risen against the Wali to recover the damages done to their date groves, and unless they obtained redress they intended to have recourse to force to compel compliance with their demands. The Wali, however, was prepared for the hos tility of the tribe, and had taken measures to forestall any attack that might be made upon him. The result was that both parties sat waiting their oppor tunity and neither would take the offensive, and the situation became so intoler able to the unoffending public that on 8th September Sheikh Sukkur bin Zaeed bin Khaleefah was persuaded to attempt mediation. Wali Suleiman, however, would brook no interference, and eventually the Sultan hearing of the state of things sent two trusted envoys to counsel Suleiman and get him to put an end to the strife by accepting any amicable arrangement which Sheikh Zaeed a ^ e ^ )r ^ 11 ® about. The latter succeeded in arranging the matter, and wan Suleiman thereupon left for Maskat to get his w^ounded foot treated and remained to the end of the year. On 3rd December a serious brawl resulting in some casualties took place at beeb between the Awamir and the Beni Hina. The Wali at once intervened.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 19 and the Governor of Semail arranged peace between the two tribes before the arrival of Seyyid Badr bin Seif who had been deputed by the Sultan for that purpose with a small armed force. This district continued in disputed and divided possession of the two cousins, Sayyids Hamood bin Azzan Keis and Saeed bin Ibrahim Keis, The rivals assisted by the Beni Euwaheh and the Yal Saad, respectively, tried to steal a march on each other, but failed. On the 8th September, however, Sayyid Saeed bin Ibrahim took peaceful possession of the fort of Awabee w r hich the Beni Kuwaheh evacuated on receiving 2,000 dollars from the Yal Saad. The latter tribe fearing that the fort might fall into the hands of the Sultan who was believed to be negociating with the Beni Buwabeh garrison for its surrender advanced the money and secured the fort for Sayyid Ibrahim. The Sultan on his part tried his utmost to wrest the district from the two competitors by seizing the fort of Hazm which commands the roads to Eostak, and by taking peaceful possession of Eostak fort; his attempts, however, failed as by some means or other His Highness's plans reached the ears of the owners of the forts and put them on their guard in good time. Moreover, the garrison of Rostak, which had previously arranged to surrender the fort to His Highness on pay ment of a considerable sum of money, changed their mind and declined to do so when His Highness's men appeared on the scene. This district continued under the administration of Wali Suleiman bin Suweilim who w 7 as accused of practising oppression and extortion upon the com munity entrusted to his charge, and fears were entertained that the Soor incident would be repeated and that the ryots would take the law into their own hands and rise against the Wali. The Sultan strongly reprimanded the Wali, and intimated to him that unless he adopted measures of justice and a more conciliatory attitude towards the public he would be recalled. This had the desired effect, as no complaint came from Sohar to the Sultan. On 16th December Sayyid Seif bin Bedr was appointed Wali of Soor. This once high and important office is only a name now. The Jenebeh emboldened by the successful rebellion they waged last year defy the authority of the Wali who represents the Local Government at Soor, and at one time even assumed a disloyal attitude towards the Sultan. As an instance of this I may quote the following incident. The Sultan proposed to adopt a distinctive flag for his State, and with this end in view summoned the iSheikhs of the Jenebeh in July last who own most of the Maskat craft to consult them on the advisability of the measure. The Jenebeh replied that they were French subjects and that any communication His High ness might have to make to them should come to them through the French Consul at Maskat. There is some reason to hope that the Sultan is gradually becoming alive to his obligations to himself and his Sultanate in this connection. Early in April the Naib Wali reported that the Bedouins of the interior contemplated an attack against him, and Dho£ar * asked for re-enforcements from. Maskat. Private letters received in the town confirmed the seriousness of the situation. The Bedouins twice looted the supplies sent to an inland fort by the Wali, the latter therefore, while sending provisions for the third time, planned an ambus cade and succeeded in killing nine Bedouins when they attacked the convoy. This caused the Bedouins to rise en masse against the Wali, but the Sheikhs of Merbat and the well-disposed inhabitants of Dhofar with Shaikh Salim bin Hamed ai-Mahrooni who was released last year at the instance of this Agency from imprisonment in Maskat sided with the Naib Wali and supported his action in punishing the evil-doers as he had done.

M. S. Redbreast and wounded two other persons with the same bullet, an Arab and a Seedi, subjects of the Sultan. The Sultan at once expressed his regret at the sad occurrence and graciously complied with the representations made by the Commander of Eedbreast for compensation to the deceased's widow. A similar accident took place at Semail on the same day when another Wahabee shot a comrade' by accident in the same way. EPIDEMICS. Maskat had been free from epidemic disease for so many years that the community had begun to believe that the climate was proof against any serious outbreak of disease. The events of the past year, howeverj have rudely dis abused them of the illusion. Cholera after beginning insidiously in Matrah probably early in September Cholera. was glared epidemic on 30th of that month, and continued to spread throuo-h- out Oman until it finally died away towards the end of January. The mor tality in Maskat and Matrah is believed to have been about 600, and in Oman generally it is estimated that 12,000 persons fell victims to its ravages. An interesting report on the subject was drawn up by Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar, I.M.S., Agency Surgeon, and is attached to this report. Hardly had cholera begun to die out when plague made its appearance. p laguei It has never been ascertained satisfac torily how the infection was brought to Maskat, but as it commenced in the Khoja community who are in constant communication with Karachi, it is probable that it was imported from thence. Maskat was declared infected on 10th January 1900 and was not declared free of the disease till the 26th May. It is difficult to give any reliable statistics as to the deaths and cures. x As in the case of cholera, the disease first went its course in Matrah, and then as it began to die out there, it took root in Maskat. The fact that a severe form of fever and influenza prevailed at the same time, and that the populace generally were very slow to come forward and report their sick, in fact did their best to conceal them for fear of beino' subjected to undesired attentions of the local authorities, made it difficult to know what amount of the extra mortality was due to plague and what to ordinary fever, but it is probable that many of the deaths reported as suspi cious were really due to plague. Segregation was adjudged to be impossible m a community such as that of Maskat, but disinfection and inoculation were carried on, and the Sultan had hospital sheds built in Maskat and Matrah for such as could be persuaded to use them. Some 400 persons in all were inocu- lated with M. Haffkine's serum. The Sultan's arrangements for the welfare of his community in a medical and sanitary respect are, as of old, most meagre, but he did in this case shew some readiness to accept advice and rise to the occasion, and went so far as to engage a medical practitioner from Bombay experienced in plague work together with an assistant, especially to assist m combating this epidemic. He was also arranging to entertain a trained native nurse for the same purpose when happily the advent of hot- weather brought the epidemic to an end. I am glad to say that, so far as is known with the exception of one or two suspicious cases reported, there was no spread of the disease to the interior as was the case with cholera. NAVY.

During the year under review, no slave dhows were captured by any of Her Majesty's Cruisers of the Persian Gulf Squadron. Out of a total of 43 slaves who applied during the year to this Consulate for protection and free dom 41 were manumitted under the stipulations of the treaty of 1873, one left of his own accord while his case was under investigation, and one was dismissed not being entitled to freedom. Six Africans were givren manumission by Lieutenant-Commander Moubray of H.M.S. Figeon and one by Lieutenant- Commander Travers of H.M.S. Redbreast under the provisions of the Brussels Act all of whom had taken refuge on board these vessels. A batch of eleven slaves recently imported, three of whom were manumitted by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and sent here for repatriation, was despatched in a bugla to Zanzibar to the care of Her Majesty's Agent and Consul-General at Zanzibar on 2nd February 1900, under the orders of the Government of India, with a view to their being employed on plantation work there.

REPORT ON THE RECENT EPIDEMIC OP CHOLERA IN MASKAT AND MATRAH, WITH A FEW GENERAL KEMARES ON THE EPIDEMIC IN OMAN. Althou^li the recent epidemic of cholera may be considered, at least as regards the towns of Maskat and Matrah, to have practically terminated some weeks ago^ occasional cases of the disease, thoug-h a few only in number, have continued occurring principally in Matrah until lately, so that it is only bow* that a sufficient interval has elapsed to warrant the assumption that the disease has died out. This cannot, however, be said in regard to some of the distant parts of the province of Oman, to which the disease has only recently extended, and though the danger of its revival in Maskat through a fresh source of infection must exist until the whole province is clear of it, I do not deem it to be so great as to necessitate any further delay in the submission of this report. That Maskat, and for that matter the whole province of Oman, has hitherto enjoyed a considerable amount of immunity from cholera cannot be disputed. The great Arabian Desert which forms one of the natural boundaries of the province and effectually isolates it from the rest of the peninsula, has undoubtedly proved to be a great barrier against the advance of any epidemic disease towards it by land, whilst by sea, which is the only practical channel of communication with the rest of the world, the means of intercourse, which until recently have been principally restricted to dhows and other kinds of sailing vessels, have been necessarily of a slow nature, thus reducing considerably the chances of a disease like cholera invading Oman. Thus it is that during the nineteenth century Oman has been visited by only three great general epidemics of cholera, including the recent one, and the disease has been imported in every instance by sea. There may have been other limited local outbreaks in some of the coast towns, but they must have been of too insignificant a nature to deserve any record. The first epidemic in the nineteenth century occurred in 1821, and was evidently of a very Bpidemio of 1821. virulent type. There is no mention made any- where as to how and whence the disease was im ported, but as it prevailed in an epidemic form about that time in India, the presumption is great that it came from there either directly from Bombay or by way of Sindand the Mekrau coajst, in both of which places it was then prevalent. Macnamara, in his Article on Cholera Asiatic in Quain's Dictionary of Medicine, says :— ' The disease was communicated from Bombay via the Persian Gulf in 1820-31, and travelled northward, but did not extend into Europe.' The great severity and malignity of this epidemic may be guessed from the remarkable suddenness with which death ensued, as is mentioned by Aitken in his Science and Practice of Medicine— (i When the cholera reached Maskat instances are given in which only ten minutes elapsed from the first apparent seizure before life was extinct. ' Muhammad bin Ruzeik, in his History of the Imams and Sayyids of Oman (translated by Gr. P. Badger), in giving a general description of the disease, also says — ' Some who are seized die at once, others after two or three days; and only a few survive. Great numbers in Oman fell victims to it.' The mortality appears to have been very considerable, and the only striking meteorologi cal condition present at the time was the great and almost unsupportable heat, a condition not altogether unusual at the time of the year when the epidemic prevailed. Dr. Ruschenberger, in his Narrative of a voyage round the World during the years 1835, 1886 and 1837,' quot ing the Asiatic Journal for 1822 as his authority, says that:— In June 1821, when the cholera carried off 10,000 of the Sultan's subjects, the heat was almost unsupportable, and the wind was like a flame of fire. At midnight the thermometer stood at 104°/' The next great epidemic that swept over almost the whole province was in 1865, and appears Epidemic of 1865 to ^ ave ^ rol£en out Maskat on the 20th of May of that year. The disease was reported to have been imported from Zanzibar by a bngalow on which it broke out after leaving Lamoo, so that out of 85 souls only 35 reached Maskat; but it may be noted here that it was also prevalent in Bombay in 1864-65, and therefore, the possibility of an additional and nearer source of infec tion ought not to be overlooked. By the 20th of June there were 600 deaths in Maskat alone, and on Soor on the coast no less than 1,700 deaths had occurred. The disease then extended northward and westward, and had evidently not disappeared from Maskat Provinces on the 27th September. I regret the want of any historical record of this epidemic and have had to compile the above details, poor as they are, from the official records in tlie office of the Politi cal Agent here. * This report was begun about the end of February, but could not be completed until now owing to pressure of work on account of the prevalence of plague and influenza.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 23 This epidemic, like its two predecessors, was preceded by an epidemic in India. The ■o -a ^ /-if i rqq disease appears to have originated at Karachi in 1)1 eml ' the Mekranee lines in May and to have raged there with great severity for nearly two months. It was thence introduced into Gwadur in the month of August, when great apprehensions having been felt of the disease extend- ino* to Maskat, the local authorities were repeatedly advised to adopt stringent measures for keeping it out. But the local authorities failed to wake up to the danger, and it was, there fore, no wonder that in the absence of even the ordinary precautions, as anticipated, the disease broke out in the neighbouring sea-port town of Matrah in the month of September. Although no precise date or mode ot importation can be fixed upon, it may fairly be concluded that the disease had been in existence for some days, or even, perhaps, some weeks before its presence came casually to my notice. In a place like Maskat, where there is no systematic arrangement for obtaining informa tion regarding the health of the population, the difficulties in the way of tracing the origin and history of an epidemic disease, as may be easily conjectured, are great, but when to them is added the persistent hostile attitude of the people themselves in regard to any inquiry on the subject, the task becomes a hopeless one. The fact of the disease having first broken out in the Jabru suburb of Matrah, which is mostly inhabited by Mekranis, points to its having been imported by some Baluchi passengers from Gwadur or Karachi, and as about that time no small sailing craft arrived from either of the places, the great probability is that those passen gers arrived here by one of the mail steamers. This assumption would appear to be consider- ahly supported by the fact that all quarantine arranirements were suspended in Maskat from the 15th July to the 16th August, so that the passengers arriving here during that period did not undergo even the formal inspection or restraint which they would have done under other circumstances. The fact also that the epidemic developed gradually and insidiously even in the original focus of infection without exciting any suspicion or drawing attention to it lends support to it. In fact even after the existence of the disease was a well-recognised thing, the attacks were so few at first that I am of opinion that the first case of cholera occurred long prior to any suspicion of its presence. Barring the fact that the hot and dry winds which usually prevail during the months of ... , Juneand July were protracted and unusually severe, the^utbreak! a other conditions preceding ^ ^ / othin / abnormal U1 the con diti 0 n o£ the atmosphere. 1 During the period immediately preceding the epidemic, namely, the month of August and early part of September, the weather, as usual at that time of the year, was damp, in conse quence of a strong south-west monsoon wind, charged with moisture, and although people here would seem from their experience of the epidemic of 1865, to have an impression that a humid condition of the atmosphere such as exists during the prevalence of the south-west monsoon favours the spreading of the disease, there was no peculiar atmospheric condition found during the recent epidemic, to favour or retard its progress. Nor was there any abnor mal circumstance noticeable in connexion with the soil of the place. It is, however, a notorious fact that the sanitary condition of Maskat and Matrah had been entirely neglected, and heaps of rubbish and putrefying organic matters not unfrequently attracted attention both inside the towns and in the suburbs. But this was by no means an unusual circumstance for the place as it had been in existence for years, nor do I hold the belief that filth by itself alone can cause cholera ; still there is no denying that these dung hills and insanitary centres had a powerful influence as a predisposing cause on its propaga tion; what share they took in it may be judged by the fact that the greatest incidence of attacks occurred in localities quite close to them. What I wrote in 1876 in my a Medical topography of Maskat' has in this respect come to be true :— ' Maskat has undoubtedly been entirely free from the disease (cholera) since then (I860) ; but the sanitation being so very defective, some of the predisposing causes are always in exist ence, and the introduction of the specific poison will excite an epidemic of great virulence and severity.'' The first case that made me suspect the probability of the appearance of cholera in Matrah . was that of a Sunnee Persian boy named Abdur The first cases that came to my notice. Rahman bin Muhammad, about 12 years of age, living in the Mazi Meya quarter of the town, who was reported to me as having died suddenly on the 19th of September. An inquiry into the cause of his death elicited the fact of his having suffered from vomiting and purging two days previously and of his having been in bad health since then; he was found to be unconscious and to have passed a large watery motion just before his death. This was followed in a few days by the news of the death of a Shia Persian girl, named Mannee, about 12 years of age, living in Jabru, one of the suburbs of Matrah, on the 2Srd, from choleraic symptoms, and on inquiry it was ascertained that her young brother, about nine years of age, living in the same house, had suffered from similar symptoms two days previously and had recovered. Some more cases then came to my notice as having occurred within the next few days in the suburb of Jabru. The disease would thus appear to have originated in Jabru to which it was at first principally confined, particularly as there seems no difficulty in tracing connexion between the first case, namely, that ot the boy Abdur Rahman, and that suburb, provided the possibility of his having visited that locality or or his having drunk water from a probably infected source of supply there be kept in view. Besides24 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL when the boy Abdur Rahman died, the epidemic in my opinion had fairly started though I was ignorant of it at the time. 3 On the 27th of September a case was reported from the hamlet of Mateireh quite close Progress of the epidemic in Matrah. to Matrah but in a direction opposite to Jabru, and while the disease was racing in the latter place it appeared also in the Baluchi quarter inside the town wall of Matrah. Most of the houses in that quarter being at the time supplied with water from the same well (named Zarrafee in Jabru) as the one from which the people of Jabru drew their supply, there would seem to have been a more intimate connexion between the two localities than their mere vicinity to each other would surest. In fact, the history of the first few cases in the Baluchi quarter strongly favours the opinion that the infection was conveyed by drinking water. By the end of the month the disease had advanced to the suburb of Tuyan and other quarters of Matrah, and though at first only a few scattered cases came to ray notice from the newly infected localities, the epidemic soon became general and assumed a wider range, so that by the 4th of October it had fairly advanced on its way to the interior, and by the middle of October no part of the town and the adjoining suburbs and villages could be considered free from it. It may be safely asserted that cholera travelled to Maskat from Matrah, the two places Origin and progress of tie epidemic in Maskat. 'f''g in constant communication with each other. Although about the end of September strong rumours were current of isolated cases of a suspicious nature occurring in Maskat, no definite information could be obtained regarding them, and the progress of the epidemic supports the opinion that the disease was directly imported from Matrah, for whilst the epidemic in Matrah attained its climax as judged by the mortality due to it on the 12th of October, that in Maskat did not attain it until the 3rd November, when the disease had fairly entered upon the stage of decline in Matrah. The first case of which any information could be obtained occurred on the 6th of October, in the person of an Arab woman (Nasra, wife of Nasir-bin-Shinein) living in the brokers' quarter in the suburb of Tuyan, which, however, cannot be looked upon as the first centre of infection, for undoubtedly cases had been occurring before that date, but no information could be obtained about them. Besides, the very next day there were three cases, two of which were in two different quarters of the same suburb and the third one in a totally different suburb. These first cases were followed, on the 9th, by a case in the town itself in the Waljat quarter and a group of cases in the Jalali fort. The disease then began to spread rapidly, soon assumed a general epidemic form, and extended to the village of Sadab on the 17th of October. It attained its maximum about the beginning of November, began to decline about the beginning of that month, and finally disappeared about the end of January 1900. Before proceeding to remark on the nature and character of the epidemic I consider it The limits of Maskat and Matrah adopted for 4 desirab ' e to state the 'ransrement that was made the purpose of registration. t p register cases regarding which reliable informa tion'could be obtained and to convey some idea of the suburbs and quarters of Maskat and Matrah, and the villages and hamlets in their imme diate vicinity included in this report. From the first it was seen that unless myself in Matrah and my Assistant at the Hospital in Maskat undertook to obtain all the available information of cases and record it, no reliable data could be subsequently forthcoming for the compilation of a report such as this. I, therefore, decided upon dividing the work by including under Maskat the neighbouring villages of Sadab and Kalbhu and under Matrah the hamlets of Riyam, Mateirah, Falaj and Arbak, and the village of Darseit; and directed 1 st class Hospital Assistant Muhammad Hosain to register all cases coming to his knowledge in the first three places, whilst I myself undertook the registration of cases occurring in Matrah and the places included under it. The reason of my grouping these villages and hamlets with the two towns would be clear to any one having a knowledge of their topography, for though they are separated from Maskat and Matrah by small hills they are so close to them that in a practical point of view they may be looked upon more as suburbs than independent centres of habitation. That the task was not an easy one, cannot be denied, particularly as we laboured under difficulties which in a more civilized place would have had either no existence or would have been overcome by means of more enerffetic measures on the part of the local authorities. It is true that His Highness the Sultan had appointed two officials for the purpose of making an inquiry in Maskat and reporting the cases there to my Assistant, who, however, informs me that the assistance they gave was not as satisfactory as might have been expected and that he had on many occasions to supplement the record through other channels, whilst in Matrah I had entirely from the beginning to the end to depend upon my own personal influence and exertions to obtain the necessary inform ation. Although these difficulties were not insurmountable as might be judged from the result now embodied in this report, I should have scarcely felt justified in passing their existence over in silence. The town of Maskat being small in area, though divided into several quarters, is, for the Localities included under Maskat. sake convenience, shown in this report as only , , ' one locality. The village of Sadab lies to the Tf 'i k'u ea f- ^ as kat from which it is separated by a small hilly pass, and the village of Jla bnu lies to the west of Maskat, the two places being separated by a small pass similar toRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 25 ,1 pass. The locality shown in the statement No. Ill as Makalla is the small cove •th harbour,*on which is situated the Coal Dep6t belonging to the British Government; it ••h bfted at certain seasons by a colony of the people of Socotra, who periodically visit M 1 k t for the purpose of fishing. I have shown all the suburban localities, though us only under two general names, Takia and Tuyan, which are the two natural nomero^ ^ ^ suburban area, all the places of minor importance in their vicinity being luded under one or the other of these two divisions. The population of the whole of this oTMaskat area may be roughly estimated at about 10,000 persons. The hamlet of Riyam, which stands on the road from Maskatto Matrah, being nearer the latter town, is included under it. Mateireh, or Localities included under -Matrah. email Matrah, is a hamlet quite close to Matrah and av be looked upon as a part of it, whilst Arbak, which is situated in the direction opposite to Mateireh may be looked upon as the other extremity of the town of Matrah. The village of Darseit and the hamlets of Shietifee and Falaj in the immediate vicinity of Matrah are ghown by their proper names. As in Maskat several localities forming the suburban area have distinctive names, but I have included them all under the two general names of Jabru and Tuyan, the former being the northern suburb and the latter the southern one, the two beino- separated by a high projecting hill which forms a natural barrier between them. Tbe population of all these places included under Matrah may be roughly estimated to be about 15,000. As regards Maskat and Matrah the epidemic set in so slowly and insidiously as hardly 0 .j • to arouse any suspicion at first; in fact so gradual Nature and characters of the epidemic. waS ^ development that its very existence was for some time doubted and denied by the local authorities. Its slow origin is all the more remarkable as in its subsequent advance through the interior of Oman it broke out in many of the places suddenly and with great violence. The individual attacks, however, were even in the early stage of the epidemic mostly sudden and unpreceded by any preliminary diarrhoea. Owing to the difficulty of fixing the date of the first case, it^ would be safer in my opinion to allow at least two weeks for the existence of the disease before the occurrence of the first case which came to my notice; counting, therefore, from that time, the epidemic may be considered to have extended over a period of five ^ ont ' :is - . Ju dgmg by the mortality as recorded at the time, it attained its maximum m Matrah m about five weeks and in Maskat between four and five weeks from its commencement. Ihe period ot decline, however, differed greatly in the two places; in Maskat the decline commenced m about a week from the maximum period and continued steadily till the disease finally dis appeared. Matrah, however, was situated differently, for being in direct communication with the interior and the north-western coast, where the disease was then prevailing, it was more exposed to fresh sources of infection, so that the epidemic was not only later in entering upon its final stage, but there was also a recrudescence of it about the end of November, which lasted through the whole of December, the final decline not being reached till the middle of January; the total duration of the epidemic in Matrah was thus nve mont s. The epidemic was characterized especially at its commencement by the occurrence of cases in which the illness set in acutely without any previous warning, and though the premonitory diarrhcea was absent in most of them the subsequen a gi e s a^e was neither rapid in its supervention nor very severe in its nature. As the epi advanced, there was a greater preponderance of cases in which profuse evacua io 0 , . , by early collapse formed an important feature of it. In the majority of eases in which collapse was a* prominent symptom, its duration was generally short, being on y , but instances of prolonged collapse, though not common, were 6 • such cases came under observation and are remarkable in the fact of eir i f nr recovery.

Of the other symptoms characteristic of this stage of the disease ^eat and cramps in the extremities were neither common nor very severe P amon&lt;? the and a sense of burning in the stomach were more common and constant among the symptoms. The reactionary or febrile stage was mostly of a mild character and d e ^mv entirely absent in some of the cases. The temperature among the cases fiom^licoted personal observation was, as a rule, not high, bnt in two o£ the cases which were .»mphcated with cerebral meningitis and which ended fatally it continued to be g &amp; »26 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL whilst in one case, which also ended fatally and in which the evacuation stage was immediately followed by a severe febrile stag^e, the temperature a few hours before death rose to 106*6 P Suppression of urine in a more or less degree was a very common symptom, but was rapidly overcome in the majority of the cases thai came under treatment. The epidemic may, upon the whole, be considered to have been one of only a moderate severity, for whilst, on the one hand, the incidence of attacks in proportion to the general population of Maskat and Matrah together was in as high a ratio as 5*3 per cent, which was enough to stamp it as one of a very grave nature, on the other it never attained that great degree of intensity as indicated by the rate of mortality, which was its most prominent charac ter in its advance through the Simail valley. At Suroor alone the first place of any importance in the interior it visited, it carried away 470 persons out of a population of 1,000 and at Simail nearly a thousand persons out of a population of about 5,000. The total number of attacks in both Maskat and Matrah together may be approximately Attaeks. stated to have been 1,339. Of these 449 took place in Maskat alone, giving a ratio of 4*5 per cent, to the population. Viewed in a racial point of view the greatest incidence of attacks was among Baluchis with whom I have also grouped Jotgals who, though racially distinct from them, are socially and in their domestic habits so much like them, that the two cannot be easily separated. Their habitations are mostly in the filthiest localities and themselves most regardless of the commonest rules of personal hygiene, so that it is no wonder that they suffered most from the epidemic. A little more than half the total number of attacks, namely, 240, occurred among them alone. The next in order to suffer were the Africans among whom there were 111 attacks, and next to them were the Arabs who are proportionately a small com munity in Maskat and who had 95 attacks among them. The least of all to suffer were the Indians among whom there were only three attacks, two being among the Muhammadans and one among the Hindus, whilst the Indo-Portuguese, who are, however, a very small commu- nity, had no attacks among them at all. This remarkable instance of the almost absolute immunity of the whole Indian community may be attributed partly to the fact of many of them having adopted prophylactic measures and partly to the fact of all their habitations, which are situated inside the town of Maskat, being far away from the greatest centres of infection. Considered in relation to age and sex, adults suffered considerably more than children, the total number of attacks among the former being 406, whilst among the latter only 43, and males suffered slightly more than females, though the ratio of deaths to attacked was much greater among the latter than among the former. There were 214 attacks among males against 192 among females. The localities that were most severely visited by the epidemic were such as contained closely packed and overcrowded huts with the most unsanitary surroundings and as were inhabited entirely by Baluchis or Jatgals or both. Many such spots exist in both the suburbs of Maskat, and it was there that the disease was most rife. Whilst the whole town of Maskat contributed only 99 cases, there were 205 in Tuyan and 83 in Takia. The total number of attacks in Matrah may be approximately stated to have been 890, giving a ratio of nearly 6 per cent, to the population. This ratio was slightly higher than in Maskat partly on account of the larger population and partly on account of Matrah being more exposed to sources of infection, as explained above. The greatest incidence of attacks was, as in Maskat, among the Baluchis who alone had among them 335 attacks, being more than a third of the total number. The Arabs come next in order, having had 290 attacks among them, or nearly a third of the total number. There were 166 attacks among the Africans and o9 among the Persians, The remaining 40 attacks were distributed among the three Indian communities—Khojas, other Indian Muhammadans and Hindus. Of these the Khojas, though now domiciled here, live aloof from the rest of the population in a separate place of their own, called the Khoja fort and may be estimated to be about 1,000 persons; there were altogether 31 attacks among them giving a ratio of a little more than ^ ® en ^* number here given is slightly different from that shown in statement -^ 0 *J^lj &gt; aS0rie attacks having occurred in the person of a Khoja who lived outside the l^hoja iO l 't, is excluded from it, whilst two attacks which occurred among the Africans m the Khoja fort are included in it. The other Indian Muhammadans who are principally goldsmiths, carpenters, memons, etc., also live inside the town amidst better sanitary surroundings than those found in the Baluchi and Arab quarters; they had only 7 atta«ks among them. The smallest number of attacks, namely, two, was among the Hindus, and it may be noticed here as a strange coincidence that they were the very last two attacks in the epidemic. Examined in relation to age, the attacks in Matrah were about five times and a half more in adults than in children, the total number among the former being 752 against 138 among the latter. As regards sex, from an early stage of the epidemic there was a general impression among the people that women were suffering more than men, which is now seen to have been rightly formed, from the statistics the attacks among females, namely, 456, being nearly double of those among males (296). This great preponderance of attacks among temales occurred principally among the Baluchis and Arabs in localities almost en tirely occupied by them, and m ay partly be accounted for by the fact that the duty of nursing the sick generally devolved on the fair sex. It would be needless to reiterate theKESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1899-1900. 27 that the localities most severely affected were those in which the most unfavourable enic conditions both of the persons inhabiting them and their surroundinofs abounded, if^selv -peopled huts with barely any ventilation in them and situated in the vicinity of 611 evards and mounds of rubbish and filth including human and other excreta in all stages ^composition, such as exist in the suburbs of Jabra and Tuyan and in the Aryaneh 0 rter of the town contributed the largest number of victims to the disease.

This ratio of deaths to attacked was slightly more than the usually accepted average of 50 per cent, and appears, in my opinion, to have been somewhat influenced by the nature of the treatment that was adopted m tbe majority of the cases, for iudging from the result of the comparatively few cases for which medical relief was sought either' at the hospital or with me in Matrah, which gives a ratio of only 28*8 per cent, of deaths to attacked, there is reason to think that a more favourable result might have been obtained had it been possible to induce the friends of many more of the attacked persons to call for medical relief instead of their trusting to irrational remedies and measures. Even in the case of such of the attacked persons as were treated by us, a further reduction in the ratio of mortality might have been looked for had their friends been more prompt in calling for medical relief and more persevering and regular in reporting the progress of fuc I i cases, for in many instances it occurred that after the receipt of the first medicine or medicines no further report was brought. The number of deaths in Maskat was 274 giving a ratio of about 61 per cant, to the attacked and one of 2'7 percent, to the general Deaths in Maskat. population. The rates of mortality in proportion to the attacked among all the three principal classes were very close to one another, the Arabs having had it in the ratio of 63'1 per cent., the Baluchis 60-4 per cent., and the Africans 61*3 per cent. The slightly higher rate of mortality among the Arabs may have been to some extent due to the practices of branding and bathing in cold water as remedial measures more commonly resorted to by them than the other races. There were so few attacks among the two Indian communities—the Muhammadans and Hindus—that it would not be fair to compare the rates of mortality among them with those among tbe other races. As regards age, the rates of mortality among the adults and children weiV3 much about the same, having been in the ratio of 61 per cent, among the former and 60'4 per cent, among tli3 latter. In a sexual point of view, however, the mortality among men (6o-4 per cent.) was by far the largest, that among women having been only 56 % per cent. Although the number of attacks in the village of Sadab, which is principally inhabited by fishermen and lower classes of Arabs, was smaller than in some of the other localities, the mortality in it was proportionately much higher, giving the highest ratio of 80 per cent, to tbe attacked. Makalla, inhabited as it is by poor fishermen from Socotra, with only a few attacks, gave also a high, rate of mortality, namely, 75 per cent,, whilst Takia and Tuyan principally inhabited by Baluchis were nearly alike in the ratio per cent, of mortality, the former havino-had 67-4 per cent, and the latter 65*3 per cent. The smallest rate of mor tality in proportion to the attacked was in the town of Maskat itself, which may be accounted for partly by the fact of more attacked persons there having had recourse to our treatment than in any other locality and partly by the fact of the people living in it being or a class in better circumstances and therefore better able to command the necessary attendance and comfort. The ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked in Matrah compares rather favourably with that in Maskat and is as near tbe average rate ot Deaths in Matrah. cholera mortality as it can be. There were in all 45^ deaths giving a ratio per cent, of 50*7 to attacked against 274 deaths and a ratio per cent, of 61 in Maskat. It is not easy to account satisfactorily for this great difference in the rates of mortality in the two places, situated as they are so close to each other, and I can only suggest in explanation the circumstance of tbe epidemic taken as a whole having begun and ended in Matrah. It is a well-known fact that during the commencement and decline of an epidemic of cholera particularly the latter cases often recover even without any treatment. Besides, although the hygienic conditions in some of the localities, particularly in the suburbs, in both the places are very much alike, Matrah being much opener has the advantage over Maskat of obtaining more benefit from two of nature's greatest disinfectants light and heai&gt;.28 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL But notwithstanding this great difference in the ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked in i\ two places, there was only a very slight difference in the ratio por cent, of deaths to th general population, so that whilst in Maskat out of every hundred persons 2*7 died f 6 cholera, in Matrah 3 out of every hundred persons died from that cause. The greatest rate^of mortality in proportion to attacks was among the Persians who live principally in the subu h of Jabru. Next to them in the order of ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked come the India Muhammadans other than Khojas, among whom, however, the attacks were so few that it would be unreasonable to compare their result with that of the attacks among the other races in the same manner as it would be unfair to include in the comparison the result of the two' solitary attacks among the Hindus, which beside being so few occurred at a stgo-e of the epidemic when most of the oases recover. Just as the general ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked compares favourably with that in Maskafc, so also do the rates of mortality araono* the principal racial classes excepting the Africans who had 8 percent, more deaths amo&amp;s- them in Matrah than in Maskat. The Arabs had only 36 *5 per 'cent, of deaths against 63 -1 per cent, in Maskat and the Baluchis 52'2 per cent, against 6(H per cent, in Maskat. The only reason that I can think of in explanation of this great difference is what I have alreadv suggested above when dealing with the general cholera mortality in Matrah. I q reo-ard to age and sex, the ratio per cent, of deaths to attacked was much greater among children than in adults, and also much greater among men than among women, which latter circumstance is remarkable in the face of the fact that the attacks among men were fewer than amono- women It appears, therefore, that the severity of the disease as indicated by the rate of mortalitv was much greater, as in Maskat, among men than among women. In regard to the localities, the highest rate of mortality actually occurred in the suburb of Jabru, the original centre of infection, which is inhabited principally by the two poorest classes —the Mekrani Baluchis and Persian beggars, though the alarming rate of 1U0 per cent, is shown against Matrah Harbour in the statement No. VJ, which circumstance needs a little explanation as it is likely to give an erroneous idea. The only three cases noted ss havino- occurred in harbour were registered from information received when the dead bodies were brought for burial on shore, but as there was no registration of cases occurring on board the vessels in the harbour no information is available in regard to such cases 0 as may have recovered. Nazi Moya and Takia, two of the quarters of the town mostly occupied bv African?, also show a very, high rate of mortality, whilst the bazar and Kitleh quarters and the K'noja fort, in each of wbich the ratio of deaths to attacked was only 25 per cent, show the lowest rate of mortality. In the case of the Khoja fort it may be noted that beside beino 1 inhabited by a community in good circumstances, all the cases in it were under my direct treatment. As no account of the mode of treatment of cholera adopted by the Arabs of Oman has Treatment. hitherto been given, I think that a short note on the subject may not be considered out of place here. Actual cautery, the great Arab panacea, occupies, as may be expected, a foremost place in the treatment of cholera in the same way as it does now in the treatment of plague and the instrument generally used in carrying out this therapeutic measure is as primitive in its conception as the measure itself. A small sickle, such as gardeners use, is heated in the fire and with its back two lines, each about two inches in length* are marked out horizontallv 5 one a little above the navel and the other a little below it ; a similar line is then marked antero-posteriorly on the top of the head in its middle. It would seem as if the Arabs are practically aware of the beneficial effects of acids in cholera, for soon after the above operation of branding, a draught composed of the juice of three or four fresh limes, about two drachms and a half of the powder of dried safar leaves [Zafaria multiflora), a pinchful of charcoal ashes and a little water is given to drink; when fresh iimes are not procurable, dried limes are pounded with a little water and substituted for them. Following this Arab idea, I found the administration of the juice of fresh limes mixed wilh a little water and sugar as often as the patient required it, a very agreeable and beneficial remedy for the intense thirst present in the early stage of the disease. The satar in the draught acts as an aromatic and carminative but I fail to see the value of ashes j in fact I should think that the ashes would partly neutralize the acidity of the juice of limes. This draught is repeated after every evacuation until five or six doses are given. Sherbet made with rose-water is given repeatedly and in large quantities to quench thirst, and when at the end of the evacuation stage, great restless ness and sense of burning in the stomach supervene, repeated bathing in cold water, even in the stage of collapse, is resorted to. For suppression of urine the most common remedy is a decoction of the leaves and broken pieces of the stem of gawzalan known to the Arabs by the v&amp;mQ ci lisan-uthfhawr [Caccinia glauca) m&amp;die by boiling about three drachms and a half of the drug in 7 ounces of water, which dose is repeated, if necessary, after two hours. Another common remedy for suppression of urine is a cold poultice made of the fresh bruised leaves and fine branches of the lucerne plant and a little common salt, which is applied over the region of the bladder and kept there for about two hours. Sitting in hot water is also occasionally resorted to for causing the flow of urine, and arhulheef (essence of the male flowers of the date-palm) made by boiling the flowers in water is administered internally in doses ot about two ounces and a half, either alone or mixed with water, for relieving the burning sensation in the stomach. During the recent epidemic civet was also employed as a remedy for suppression of urine, a little of it being applied to the meatus urinarjus.BESIDENCT AND siASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1899-1900. 29 '^~^rTZ^l^)racticable from the beginning to organize any system for coaveying • i I f to the sufferers, we considered it advisable to adopt some method ot routine medical reliet ^ ^ w ithin an easy and immediate reach of the attacked persons.

Soon after the disease had assumed an epidemic form in Mtrah and in fact before it had spread generally all over the place, it broke out on or about +1^ 4tli October with great suddenness and violence at Suroor, which lies on the highway to th 6 Sharkiyeh or the Eastern District of Oman and Oman Proper, having: been conveyed thither by a caravan returning from Matrah, The suddenness of the invasion and the /ruling rate of mortality there caused the people to be almost panic-stricken and to flee in aU directions, the infection thus spreading to the neighbouring villages and hamlets and eventually to the town of Simail itself. The Wadi Beni Ruwaheh being a continuation of the 'Wadi Simail was directly infested from the latter place, the course of the advance of the epidemic being still in the westerly direction. From Suroor the disease also advanced in a northerly direction to al-Khode, where the first case occurred about the 17th of October, and which then became the centre for the diffusion of the disease to Nakhl on the one hand and to the Batinch Coast on the other. When th^ disease reached Nakhl first, the outbreak being more of the type of cholerine than true cholera, was attended with hardly any mortality, but the second or subsequent outbreak, which occurred about 20 days after the first one, was one of a very severe nature causing 450 deaths and giving the high ratio of 15 per cent, of deaths to population. A remarkable circumstance in connexion with its advance to Nakhl is the fact of its having followed the course of greatest communication, namely, through al-Khode instead of taking the shortest course from Simail over the hills which are a ramification oi the Green Mountains. From Nakhl the epidemic advanced in succession to Wadi Muawal, al-Awabi, and ar -Rustak and from al-Khode it spread first to as-Seeb and thence to the whole of the Batineh Coast in a north-westerly direction, the last place to be infected there being Sohar. It spread from the Wadi Beni Ruwaheh in a westerly direction to Oman Proper and also to the Sharkiyeh in which, however, Samad, Rawdeh and other places close to the Simail ^ adi were previously infected through the disease advancing direct from Suroor. It may here be noted, that the hamlets in the Akk pass through which the caravans passed on their way from Suroor to the Sharkiyeh enjoyed absolute immunity throughout the whole course of the epidemic. The disease appears to have spread to Wadi Hatat from Matrah through the village or Rui whilst to Teiwee and Kalhat on the south-eastern coast from Masqat. The total number of deaths due to cholera in Oman, as far as I have been able to ascer tain and as may be seen from the accompanying Mortality in Oman. statement No. VII, which has been compiled partly from information kindly supplied by His Highness the Sultan of Maskat, but prin cipally from information through other channels, may be approximately stated to be 12,231, I regret to have to state that the statement is incomplete in some respects, but I submit it as it is with the hope of its being able to give a fair idea of the extent and severity of the epidemic in the interior. This enormous mortality was due in a great measure to the intensity of the epidemic in many of the places it visited in its course, and the determining cause of that intensity is easily found in the general practice which obtains in the interior, of washing the dead quite close to the aqueducts. It must be remembered that with the exception of some of the places in the Sharkiyeh which contain wells as an additional source of water-supply, the principal means of irrigation are aqueducts fed by springs, all the supply of water for domestic purposes being also obtained from them. When a dead body is removed to one of these aqueducts for washing, a breach is made in the masonry of the aqueduct quite close to the place where the body is, and the water allowed to run over it, some of which evidently runs by the side of the aqueduct and eventually pollutes it Cholera germs in abundance had thus an easy access to the water supply of most of the places and gave rise to those sudden and violent explosions which in places like the Simaii valley and Teiwee resulted in such alarming rates of mortality. This assumption is strongly supported by the fact that on the Batineh Coast and at Maskat and Matrah where the supp y of water for domestic purposes is drawn entirely from wells and where the dead are wasned in houses, far away from the sources of water-supply, the rates of mortality were proportion ately much less, that for the former or Batineh Coast being in the ratio of l'^ per cent, ana for the latter or Maskat and Matrah together 2*9 per cent. It may thus be seen that the recent epidemic of cholera with its heavy mortality ing as it did an unusually severe epidemic of small-pox, which alone carried away over , souls, has had a highly deleterious effect on the health of the Province, which, i 1 ® to be regretted, is likely to suffer still further from an early visitation of plague shonld tne epidemic, which is now raging in Maskat and Matrab, extend to the interior, M askat ; ■) A.

CALCUTTA: WCE OP THE SUPEEINTENDENT OF GOVEENMENT HUNTING, INDIA. 1901.ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY TOE 1900-1901 P art I.—GENERAL SUMMARY. Rainfall and Harvest. —The rainy season of 1900-1901 set in early and 1- General, the rainfall was at first satisfactory. There was, however, an unusually long break in the rains during the months of January and February, and consider able anxiety was felt. Timely rain in March has much improved the pros pects, and it is now believed that the harvest will be a fair one. The rainfall in Bushire during the season amounted to 8 inches 83 cents against 14 inches 21 cents in 1899-1900. The embargo on the export of wheat was removed in July, but it was re-imposed in November. At Mohammerah, however, and in the Karun dis tricts, the order of the Persian Government removing the embargo remained a dead letter in so far as European firms were concerned, the Shaikh of Moham merah, acting, as he said, under the orders of the Governor-General of Arabistan, refusing to allow exports to be made. Representations made to the Persian Government were practically useless, and the consequence was that British firms were able to do very little business in grain during the year. Native dealers, however, managed successfully to evade the embargo. The harvest of 1900 having been a good one throughout Southern Persia, the embargo was quite unnecessary, and the policy of the Persian Government in allowing it to remain in force must necessarily put a stop to the increase of cultivation and seriously interfere with the development of trade. The Governorship of Bushire. —The Darya Begi has held the Governor ship of Bushire throughout the year. He has, it is understood, been confirmed in the appointment for the coming year. Now that the management of the Customs has been separated from the Governorship, the emoluments of this post have been very largely curtailed, and it is understood that the appoint ment is now hardly worth holding. His Excellency was presented with a sword of honour by the Government of India in recognition of the services rendered by him on the occasion of the murder of Mr. Graves. The presenta- i tion was made by the Resident on the 4th June. In the month of December His Excellency received a Russian decoration. Public Peace and Tranquillity year under review was a fairly tranquil one. At the beginning of the year it was feared that the assumption of the Customs management at the various Gulf Ports by the Belgian Adminis tration might give rise to trouble, but, so far as Bushire was concerned, beyond the closing of the shops for a few days and the abstention of native merchants from business for a short while, no excitement was manifested, and business soon resumed its normal course. At the other Gulf Ports no trouble was experienced. At the end of May another murder was committed at Bushire near the Telegraph offices. The man killed was a Persian subject and a relation of B2 ADMINI8TEATI0N EEPOUT ON THE PEESIAN GULP POLITICAL ^Mahmud, the Jamadar of the Telegraph Department. The perpetrators of the /'crime have not, so far as is known, been brought to justice. |On the 31st August a serious outrage was committed at the British Residency at Sabza - bad! In the middle of the night a party of men surrounded the Residency and commenced a fusillade. The firing lasted only a few minutesi and fortu nately occasioned no loss of life, although there musi ^undoubtedly have boen some narrow escapes, as the Residency and the servants quarters were struck by bullets. One of the horses belonging to the Resident's escort was killed. Strong protests were at once made, and the Darya Begi, who had reported to his Government that the outrage was committed by certain members of the Tangistani tribe instigated by a merchant of Bushire known as the Nazem-ut- Tujar and a notorious intriguer, was ordered to lead an expedition against the Tangistanis. The expedition appears to have been conducted in accordance with the usual Persian methods. Having collected a large force from among the warlike tribes in the vicinity of Bushire, the Darya Begi set out against Tangistan. The greater portion of the tribe appears to have submitted to him without delay, but he experienced a certain amount of opposition from some of the sections of the tribe who were notorious for their bad conduct. This opposition was overcome without much difficulty, and having pillaged and laid waste the country, His Excellency returned to Bushire. Two or three of 5 the Tangistanis were killed, but most of those who were 6&lt; wanted ' on account of their complicity in the attack on the Residency and other crimes managed to effect their escape into the neighbouring hills, where a secure refuge may always be had. There is no doubt that the tribe has received a severe lesson, in proof of which may be noted the fact that the road through the Tangistan district, which had been closed to caravans for some time past owing to the \ lawlessness of the tribe, has now become safe. How long this more tranquil condition of affairs will last, it is difficult to say. With a weak Governor of Bushire (the tribesmen now have a wholesome dread of the Darya Begi), trouble is at any time possible. Thanks to the efforts of certain merchants of Bushire, who have imported arms of recent years in such large quantities, the tribesmen in the vicinity are all well armed and are quite capable of mischief, should a suitable occasion offer. I can bear personal testimony to the extent to which the population of this part of Persia has become armed with breech-loading rifles of recent years. Ten years ago, a Martini-Henry rifle was rarely seen. Now, even in the town of Bushire itself armed men are constantly seen, and in the adjacent villages there can hardly be a man who does not possess a Martini-Henry rifle. It is satisfactory to add (that the Nazem-ut-Tujar has been expelled from Bushire. Apart from his supposed complicity in the outrage on the Residency, he had succeeded in making himself obnoxious to the towns-people of Bushire, and it is to be hoped that he will not be permitted to return. He has, however, influential friends, and his expulsion was not obtained without difficulty. Fuhlic Eealth.r-^hQ past year has been a healthy one in Bushire. The summer, though long, was comparatively mild, and no epidemic or contagious disease occurred during the year. Telegraphic information was received about the middle of April that plague had broken out in the Ardelan province, north of Kermanshah, near the Turkish frontier, and caused some 200 deaths. The Turks, therefore, impcsed quarantine on arrivals from Persia. Small-pox of a severe type appeared at Shargah in the first week of April, causing, it was reported, about 500 deaths. Early in May reports were received from Bandar Abbas that an abnormal death-rate prevailed on the island of Kishm, and the Assistant Surgeon on duty at Bandar Abbas, in connection with the plague preventive operations, visited the island and reported the outbreak of plague. The disease, however, soon disappeared. The Residency Surgeon visited the island early in June to supervise the opera tions undertaken to prevent the spread of the disease. The Residency Surgeon was in charge of the sanitary arrangements in the Persian Gulf throughout the year, but the financial control, which had hitherto been in the hands of the local Persian authorities, was transferred to the Belgian Director-General of Customs in Southern Persia. This arrangement has proved satisfactory, as arrears of payments due in connection with theEESIDENCT AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900.1901. 3 expenditure on plague preventive operations have been paid up, and there is no longer any difficulty in obtaining payment on account of current expenses The buildings on the quarantine island have been put in good order, and furniture provided for the house set apart for first and second class passengers. The fees recovered from passengers have been raised, and now amount to lis. 5 for first-class, Rs. 4 for second-class, and Rs. 3 for third-class passengers. Currency. —No appreciable improvement has taken place in the currency. | The ' Bijecks,^ however, referred to in the last year's report, have been entirely 1 suppressed, and the new^ kran coinage is more available than heretofore. A supply of new nickel coins, minted in Belgium, has been imported to augment the current copper coinage. Administration of the Customs in the 'Persian Gulf,—On the 21st March 1900 the control of the Customs was, as stated in last year's report, taken under the direct management of the Persian Government. M. Simais, formerly Commercial Attache of the Belgian Legation at Tehran, arrived in Bashire and took up his appointment as Director-General of the Customs of Fars,' acting under the orders of M. Naus, the Belgian Minister of Customs at Tehran. Other Belgian officials arrived, and the administration of the Customs at Bushire, Lingah and Bandar Abbas was formally assumed. As was only to he expected, the new administration, which interfered with so many vested interests, experienced at the outset considerable opposition. At first it was intended to impose a uniform import duty of 5 per cent, ad valorem on all goods imported into Persia by the native merchants instead of the hitherto prevail ing specific rates. This proposal, however, was stoutly opposed, and the native merchants of Bushire and Shiraz refused to clear their goods from the Customs House. Eor a month or more business was entirely suspended, and goods imported remained uncleared. Both in Bushire and Shiraz the excite ment was considerable, and it was feared that serious disturbances would occur. The Persian Government, therefore, decided to introduce a new tariff on a sliding scale, which would be more favourable to the native merchants than the proposed 5 per cent. rate. This tariff was also opposed, but the Persian Govern^ ment remained firm, and by the first week in August the new tariff came in force. Since then matters have progressed smoothly, and at the time of writing this report the Customs Administration have succeeded in bringing into force the 5 per cent, rate for all native-owned goods. Native merchants and foreign ers are now, therefore, on the same footing as regards the payment of duty, but it is rumoured that, before long, the Persian Government intend to take steps to alter the existing Treaty under which the rate of 5 per cent, was fixed for foreigners, and to increase the tariff in their case so that the native merchants may be placed on a more favourable footing. So far as the interests of European merchants are concerned, the establish ment of the Belgian Customs Administration at the Gulf Ports has been, 1 believe, entirely beneficial. The glaring abuses, formerly so prevalent in the Customs House, appear to have entirely ceased, and various improvements have been effected. In course of time, under the present able and energetic management of M. Simais, many other desirable improvements will undoubtedly be effected. The orders of the Persian Government against the importa tion of arms and ammunition are now being energetically carried out. At the smaller ports, however, where the new administration has not as yet been able to assume control, the smuggling of arms still continues. It is said, however, that the Persian Government are considering the question of purchasing two small gunboats for the purpose of patrolling the coast of the Persian Gulf with a view to put a stop to the smuggling. M. Simais tells me that he has seized and confiscated more than 1,000 rifles and 200,000 rounds of ammuni tion during the year. From the point of view of the Persian {xovernment, the new system of Customs management has resulted in a large increase of revenue. Piom s return, which the Director^General was good enough to give me, his admims^ ration in the Gulf has succeeded in bringing in an income of 3,9475000 kians, a co nsiderable increase over the sum of krans 2,400,000 for which the Customs were formerly farmed. When it is considered that for about two months at he beginning of the year business was practically at a standstill, owing to e 0 Pposition which the new administration experienced, that the trade otV 2, O man Maskat. 4 ADMINISTEATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Bandar Abbas has shown a great falling off, and that there are several minor ports where the Belgians have not yet succeeded in establishing their control, it will be understood how profitable, from the point of view of increased revenue, the new system is likely to prove. Settlement of Claims for Compensation, —During the past year the long outstanding claim of Messrs. David Sasson &amp; Co., amounting to tomans 6,053, on account of goods missing from the Customs House in Bushire, has been settled, as also the claim of Messrs. Lynch Brothers for tomans 600 on account of robbery of specie. Owing to strong representations made by His Britannic Majesty's Minister at Tehran, His Imperial Majesty the Shah has decided to send a special dele gate to Bushire to inquire into the numerous claims of British subjects against the Persian Government. The delegate has not yet arrived, but is expected shortly. Russian Activity in the JPersian Gulf —The year under report has been /remarkable for the number of Russian travellers who have visited Southern J Persia and the various ports of the Gulf. Some of these travellers appear to have been engaged in survey operations, whilst others, it is believed, had com- .mercial objects in view.? One of tbe proofs of increased Russian interest in /these parts was the arrival, towards the end of March, of the Russian merchant steamer Korniloff, bringing a large cargo of kerosine oil, sugar, piece-goods, and other commodities for Uushire and other Persian Gulf ports and Basrah. The Russian Consul from Ispahan arrived in Bushire shortly before the arrival of the Korniloff, and was very active in his efforts to induce the local merchants to take up the cargo. His efforts, however, do not appear to have met with success, and there is Kttle doubt that the present venture will be, in a commercial sense, a failure. ? Some Russian merchants arrived in the Korniloff, and it is said that a Russian Consul is soon to make his appearance here, and that a branch of the Russian Bank Tpill be opened. The Bushire branch of the Dutch firm of Messrs. Hotz &amp; Son, a firm doing a large business in Persia and hitherto enjoying British good offices, has now declared itself under Russian protection, and Mr. Moesmann, the Bushire representative of the firm, has undertaken the agency of the line of Russian steamers, which, it is said, will come up the Gulf monthly, and of which the Korniloff wzs the first. It is clear that the Russians intend to establish a footing in the Gulf. Demise of Her late Majesty Queen-Empress Victoria. —The melancholy news of the demise of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen-Empress Victoria was received in Bushire with universal sorrow. The principal officials of the Persian Government, the representatives of Foreign Governments and most of the British and British Indian subjects living in Bushire called upon the Resident to express their sorrow and condolences, and the Armenian commu nity held a special memorial service in their church. from Bahrein also, and from other places in the Gulf, numerous expres sions of sorrow were received. Tours. —I visited Bahrein on several occasions during the year. I also visited the Arab Coast in December and met the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman. The Chief of Abu Dhabi was away in the interior, but I saw his son and other principal men. In January, I visited Mohammerah and made the acquaint ance of Shaikh Khazal. Later in the year I visited Ma skat and the principal Persian Gulf ports. Mr. W. S. Davis, my Pirst Assistant, paid a visit to Shiraz in June, returning to Bushire in October. Captain P. Z. Cox was Political Agent throughout the year. His relations with the Sultan have been most cordial. A satisfactory issue to the negotiations between His Majesty's Government and that of the .French Republip regarding the site of the French coal shed in the Maskat harbour has been arrived at, a portion of the site hitherto used by us for the storage of coal having been made over to the French. The plague epidemic, to which reference was made in last year's report, died out entirely in the beginning of May, and there has been no recrudes cences. The Political Agent's report of the principal events in the Maskat State during the year forms Part II of this compilation.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. 5 In the beginning of the year, an intrigue was set on foot by the Darya ^ Bed with Shaikh Zaid-bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abu Dthabi, its object being to Coast • detach the Chief from the other Trueial Chiefs. The Darya Begi's action had evidently some connection with the recent expulsion of the Arab rulers from / Linffah, and took tangible form in the presentation, by the Persian Govern- ment through the Darya Begi, of a firman and other presents to Shaikh Zaid s who further took upon himself to introduce a special flag for Abu Dthabi. Shaikh Zaid has been warned that it is improper for him to have direct relations with the Persians, and be has been told that he should revert to the usual flag prescribed by Treaty for all the Trucial Chiefs. In May 1900 the Chief of Abu Dthabi repeated his request for permission to send provisions by sea to the Sudan tribe under Sultan-bin-Nasir, to whom he bad accorded his protection, and who wished to colonize Zaora, a place in close proximity to the territories of the Chiefs of Ajman and Shargah. As this permission had been previously granted, though not hitherto taken advantage of, and as it was understood that the' Chiefs of Shargab and Ajman, who claimed the ownership of Zaora, had no objection to its occupation by the Sudan tribe, the Eesident gave the required permission. Later on, however, it appeared that the Chiefs of Shargah and Ajman strongly objected to the appearance of the Chief of Abu Dthabi at a place so close to their territory, and as it appeared possible that the permis sion granted to Shaikh Zaid might be the cause of disturbances, the permission granted to the Chief of Abu Dthabi was revoked, and he was advised to give/ up his project with regard to Zaora. On the 8th July 1900, Abdul Aziz, the uncle of Shaikh Humaid-bin- Rashed, Chief of Ajman, attacked Ajman, and Shaikh Humaid having been killed, Abdul Aziz assumed charge of the government of the place. Shaikh Humaid -bin-Abdulla, Chief of Eas-al-Khaima, died at an advanced | age on the 2nd August 1900, and the government of the place was assumed f by the Chief of Shargah, who now rules both Shargah and Ras-al-Khaima. So | far his authority has not been disputed by the other claimants to the Chiefship. The Resident, in the interests of the general peace, found it necessary to intervene in the dispute mentioned in last year's report regarding the pearl of great value. An amicable settlement was arrived at, the claim of the Sultan of Maskat to a share in the value of the pearl being admitted. It is hoped that the settlement will shortly be, if it has not already been, carried into effect. The pearling season along the Arab Coast has not been at all a satisfactory one. No cases of piracy or disturbances at sea occurred during the year. Mr. Gaskin has been confirmed in the appointment of Assistant Political 4 Bahrein Agent, and has remained at Bahrein throughout the year. He appears to have exercised a very satisfactory influence over the Chief. Shaikh Isa's health has not been entirely satisfactory during the year. At his request his eldest son. Shaikh Hamid, has been recognized by the Govern- \ ment of India as his successor. The Chief was very grateful that his request had been complied with, and the announcement of the recognition was the occasion for much public rejoicing in Bahrein. It was reported from Bahrein that the Turks have sent two new guns tor the fort at El-Bida on the Katr Peninsula. oi, -i i, a i A serious incident occurred on the 3rd December, when Shaikn fealman- hin-Diaij, a cousin of the Chief of Bahrein, and a person of influence in Bah- rein, with his son and nephew and 23 followers, were attacked and murdered by Bedouins belonging to the Behah section of the Almurrah tribe. The murder, took place on the main land, where the murdered Shaikh with his followers had gone, in accordance with his usual custom at this time of year, on a hunting expedition. The incident was a cause of great concern to the Cliie o Bahrein. It is too early yet to write the history of the struggle which has been in 5 * §^ eit and progress during the past few months between SHaikh Mubarak and the Amir of Nejd, and which has thrown this part of Arabia into ^ ri:ia 1 0 J; 0 ? e time it seemed not improbable that fortune would favour Shaikh Mubarak, and that he would succeed in reinstating in Nejd Abdul ^hman-bm-F^sal, of the Saud dynesty, the former rulers of the country. Up till t e mi e o March no lighting of any importance had taken place, though it was knownADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL 6. Persian arabistan. 7. Fars and Persian Coast, 8.

Towards the end of March, however, reports reached Bushire that Shaikh Mubarak had experienced a decisive defeat. Details are not yet forthcoming. The Wali of Easrah succeeded in inducing Shaikh Mubarak to pay his long promised visit to Basrah in November last. I visited Koweit on two occasions during the year, and I had an interview with Shaikh Mubarak on the first occasion. At the time of my second visit he was absent from Koweit. H. M. S. Sphinx has also visited the place. Erom reports which have reached the Eesidency, affairs in Persian Arabistan appear to have been quiet during the year. His Royal Highness the Ain-ud-Dowleh, who was Governor-General, proceeded to Tehran about the end of December to spend ' Eamazan ' there. He has since been appointed Governor of Tehran, and is succeeded by His Royal Highness Salar-ed-Dowleh as Governor-General of Arabistan, Luristan, etc. It was confidently expected that the Persian Government would take over the direct management of the Mohammerah Customs, placing the same under the control of the Belgian Director-General at Bushire. The income derived from the Mohammerah Customs has, for years, formed one of the perquisites of the Shaikh of Mohammerah, who pays an annual tribute to the Persian Government. The direct assumption by the Government of the control of the Customs will be a very unpopular measure, from the point of view of the Shaikh and the Arab tribes acknowledging his control, and may possibly give rise to serious trouble, but it is not likely that the introduction of the measure will be much longer delayed. Towards the end of May, the Bakhtyaris were building the Dupalan bridge on the Ispahan road, and three Ispahan Kafilas had arrived at Ahwaz with almonds and dried fruits for sale, and purchased goods for the return journey. More caravans were said to be on the way, and a number of pilgrims for Meshed travelled by the new route early in June. His Royal Highness the Moayid-ud-Dowleh was Governor-General of Pars during the year. He appears to have been somewhat weak, and Shiraz and the districts were in their usual disturbed state. The Kowam-ul-Mulk appears to have maintained fairly good order among the Nomad tribes. Nothing of particular interest occurred at Lingah during the year. At Bandar Abbas, Lieutenant Hunt remained as British Vice-Consul during the year. Trade at this port has greatly declined during the year, the reasons given being that the new trade route from Quetta via Nushki and Seistan has diverted a good deal of the trade which used to find its wav to Bandar Abbas, and also that Russian imports into Khorassan have increased, Shaikh Hassan, the Zabit of Kishm, has been removed and was succeeded hv Shaikh Abdulla. y Mr. Whitby-Smith, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, who is in nolitical charge of the Makran Coast, visited the Coast in November last. It had been arranged through Major Sykes, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Kerman, that a Persian official should meet him at Charbar to inquire into, and, if possible, effect a settlement of the numerous outstanding claims of British subjects, The official left Kerman, but did not go any further than Bampur, whence he returned to Kermah. His failure to come to Charbar was probably due to Mir Hashim Khan, the Sartip of Bampur, against whom various British Indian subjects are very loud in their complaints. The failure of the official to come to Charbar and the conduct of Hashim Khan have been brought to the notice of the British Legation at Tehran. Twelve slaves took refuge in the Bushire Residency during the year, and were, after the customary correspondence with the Persian authorities, granted their freedom. Three of them were, at their own request, sent to Zanzibar, and the remainder stayed in Bushire where they were able to find employment. Three piratical outrages took place within the Gulf during the year, only one of which was of a really serious nature, a Bahrein boat which was engaged in pearl-fishing off Ras Tanura, near Katif, being attacked by robbers from Darain in Turkish territory, and property of the value of Rs. 3,924 being carried off. The case was reported to the Turkish authorities, who appear to have acted with a certain degree of energy, and to have arrested some of the robbers and obtained the restoration of a portion of the stolen property. /( 2 '9 RESIDENCY AND MASK^T POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. A disturbance took place off El-Wakra between some boats of the Al-bin- Ali and Amamera tribes who were engaged in pearl-fishing and were driven by a storm to take shelter near the coast. Luckily the disturbance had no serious results, but in pursuance of the policy of the British Government, which views with disfavour the occurrence of any disturbances at sea, the case was i taken up by the Kesident, who, after an inquiry, decided to inflict a fine on the tribe which was held to be at fault. During the date season, owing to the vigilant watch kept by the Moez-es- Saltaneh, the Shaikh of Mohammerah, and also to the presence of one of His Majesty 's ships in the Shatt-el-Arab, no case of piracy was reported, though, later in the year, on 25th January 1901, a Bahrein boat was attacked near Maamer on the Turkish side of the river. The pirates have not been traced. H.M.S. Sphinx left Bushire for Maskat on the 16th April. In July shell. Navy, visited the Arab Coast and Bahrein, returning to Maskat. She again returned to Bushire in January and also visited Basrah. H.M.S. Bedbreast arrived in Bushire on 23rd September and proceeded to Basrah on the 26th idem. She left the Gulf in the end of December for Bombay. H.M.S. Cossack arrived at Bushire on the 23rd November and left a^ain for Maskat on the 12th December. H.M.S. Highflyer, with His Excellency Rear-Admiral Bosanquet on board, arrived in the Gulf in March and visited Bushire and Bandar Abbas. Of Foreign Navies, the French Store Ship, the Drome, was the only ship which entered the Gulf during the year. She called at Bandar Abbas, Lingah and Bushire, and also visited Koweit, Mohammerah and Basrah. Lieutenant-Colonel M. J. Meade proceeded to Bombay in the E.I.M.S. 12. official Lawrence on furlough and made over charge of his post as Political Resident, chan g© s . Persian Gulf at Bombay, on 7th April 1900, to Lieutenant-Colonel O, A. Kemball, who arrived at Bushire in the Lawrence on 26th April, and held the post of Resident for the remainder of the year. Mr. Davis was First Assistant throughout the year, and visited Shiraz during the summer months, leaving Bushire on 10th June and returning on 23rd October. Captain E. Wickham Hore, I.M.S., was Residency Surgeon during the year. He went on three months'privilege leave to India on 10th July, and rejoined his post on 13th October. During his absence. Assistant Surgeon J. A. Loho, I.S.M.D., acted as Residency Surgeon. Mr. J. P. Sequeira returned from furlough on the 14th November, and Mr. Gaskin having been posted to Bahrein, assumed charge of the post of Extra Assistant to the Political Resident and Vice-Consul. During Mr. Gaskin's absence and until the arrival of Mr. Sequeira, Mr. P. J, Gandhy was acting Uncovenanted Assistant and Vice-Consul, after which he was appointed Superintendent of the Residency Office. Dr. Reinhardt, Imperial German Consul, held charge of the German Vice- 13. changes Consulate in Bushire up to the 24th April, when he went on furlough, being ' relieved by Herr Roesler, who remained in charge of the Vice-Consulate until pr March, when Dr. Reinhardt returned to Bushire.

Out-doorRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901. 15 P AR T II .-ADMINISTRATION REPORT OF THE MASKAT POLITI- OAL AGENCY FOR THE YER 1900-1901. 1. During the year under report, the internal polities of Oman have given Political. His Highness the Sultan little or no cause for any serious anxiety. Reports current 5 at the beginning of the year, pointing to an imminent rising against Maskat, probably had little foundation, and the other breaches of inter-tribal peace, which have occurred during the period, have been of the ordinary nature inseparable from Oman, politics. 2. Early in April persistent rumours continued to reach Maskat to the effect that a combined rising of the Sharkiya and Ghafari tribesmen against Maskat was imminent. The Sultan himself always expressed great doubt of the possi bility of these two diverse elements making any effective combination, and as a matter of fact the time of the year (the non-date season) was the least favourable for the movement of a large force. The prospect of an attack on Maskat or Muttra was nevertheless for some time seriously discussed by the native public, and resulted in some uneasiness among the trading community. In order to be prepared for eventualities, the Sultan arranged to increase the garrisons at Kurryat and Seeb, his two most vulnerable points on either side of Maskat, and summoned a number of his loyal Ghafari adherents from the Batineh Coast to strengthen his hands locally. Saiyid Saeed-bin-Ibrahim-bin- Kais, the holder of the fort of Rostak, a brother-in-law of His Highness, immediately on hearing rumours of an intended attack upon Maskat, also moved towards the capital with between 300 and 400 men to support the Sultan. On the 13th of April, however. Shaikh Rashid-bin-Uzaiz, the Governor of Simail, who had been instructed by the Sultan to carefully watch the move ments of the restless tribes, sent in a report to the effect that there was no serious foundation for the rumour that the Hinawis and Ghafaris were com bining, and that he did not believe that any rising at all was contemplated. A few days later the Sultan received reassuring letters from other loyal friends in the Sharkiya, which served to put an end to any remaining uneasiness. The cause generally assigned to this expected rising at the time was the lengthy protraction of the punitive tax in force for the indemnification of sufferers in the last attack on the capital. Happily this burden on the date industry has since been eliminated. 3. The incidents which follow are of a less important character, but deserve to he chronicled On the 25th of April information was brought in that some of the Siabieen had fired upon a party of Mowalik in the vicinity of Bidbid, about 40 miles from Maskat, under the supposition that they were men deputed by Saiyid Saeed-bin-tbrahim on behalf of the Sultan to expel the garrison of the Bidbid fort who were suspected of being in treacherous correspondence with His Highness's enemies. The Mowalik, not unnaturally, prepared for imme?' diate retaliationj but the matter was satisfactorily settled by the intervention of the Sultan and an adequate apology from the Shaikh of the Siabieen. Early in May news was received that Shaikh Nasir^bin-Hamed was medi? tating mischief and had asked the Beni Ruwaheh to let him make use of their passes into the Simail valley. The latter, however, on behalf of the Sultan, closed their roads against Shaikh Nasir, who then attempted an attack on Nezwah, in which he signally failed, as the Sultan's Wali in that town was pre pared for him and put his force to rout, recovering at the same time some fifty camels which had been looted by them. The cause of Shaikh Nasir's display of hostility against the Sultan appears to have been due to the stoppage of black mail formerly paid to him by His Highness but of late discontinued owing to the recipient's disaffected attitude. Soon 9/fter the incident above reported the Shaikh wrote a disrespectful letter to the Sultan, threatening mischief if not subsidized as of old, but no notice was taken of the missive. . 4 Shaikh Khalfan-bin-Thenayan, who was referred to in last year's Admi^ Wstration Report as having been re-apppinted Wali of Nakhl by the Governor ofv. 16 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Simail on the latter's own authority and as having been reluctantly confirmed in that post by the Sultan, again became a source of trouble, in that, according to report, he incited some evilly disposed persons to kill a man of the Khumud tribe in the precincts of the town itself. On hearing of this the Sultan dis patched a party of Wahabis under the Wali of Burka to arrest this recalci trant official and to bring him a prisoner to Maskat. The Shaikh again cleverly eluded the men sent to arrest him, and for some time remained in security; being, however, friendless and homeless, he was finally reduced to claiming sanctuary in the Sultan's palace and abjectly begging pardon for his past misdeeds. On the 12th of August a serious brawl took place in the bazar at the port of Seeb between the Beni Haiyieh and the Awlad Hadeed, which resulted in some loss of life. Fortunately, however, effective measures were taken before the disturbance gained any serious proportions; howbeit the bazar was closed for some days by reason of it, and the contending parties continued to behave riotously when opportunity off ered. In the absence of the Sultan in the interior, Saiyid Mahomed-bin-Turki, who was in charge of affairs at Maskat, on the receipt of the news at Seeb (which is but 20 odd miles from Maskat), promptly dispatched 50 Wahabis under Saiyid Badr-bin-Seif to put down the disturbance and make peace between the combatants. Mean while the news had also reached the Sultan at his camp in the Simail valley, and he hurriedly marched from thence to Seeb to settle the matter himself. A day or two later 13 of the ringleaders were sent into Maskat by him for incarceration. 5. In October Shaikh Isa-bin-Saleh-el-Harthi, son of the leader of the rebel lion of 1895, in company with his brother Hamed and Shaikh Mohsin-bin-Amr, brother of Hilal-bin-Amr abovementioned, arived at Simail ostensibly with the object of paying complimentary visits to the Shaikhs of the Beni Ruwaheh and Beni Jabar, but in reality to make overtures for the active support of these two tribes in the event of any move being made by the Sharkiya tribesmen against Maskat. The emissaries, however, signally failed in their errand and were not even able to secure a promise of neutrality, owing no doubt to the fortunate fact that the Sultan in his recent tour in the Simail valley had managed to win over to his allegiance Shaikh Saeed-bin-Abdulla, a powerful leader of the Beni Ruwaheh and son of the famous Kalili, who in 1869 assisted Azzan-bin-Kais to assume power in Maskat and thus break the line of succes sion of the descendants of the great Saiyid Sultan. Having failed in his object, Isa-bin-Saleh endeavoured to whitewash himself by addressing a letter to the Sultan through the Wali of Simail conveying his respects to His High ness, and asking permission to pay him a visit at Maskat. The Sultan, not believing in his professions of amity, sent him a civil reply, thanking him for his good intentions, but at the same time discouraging him from coming into Maskat at present. Shaikh Isa and his companions thereupon returned to their head-quarters in the Sharkiya. 6. In November Saiyid Saeed-bin-Ibrahim Kais took upon himself to dam the irrigation canals used to convey water to the date groves of the Ibrieen at Awabi, on account of the nonpayment by them of the ' Zakat' or land tax. The Temimeh of the Ibrieen thereupon assembled his tribesmen, and supported by 300 of them blockaded the fort of Awabi, then in the possession of Saeed- bin-Ibrahim, who at once applied to the Sultan for assistance in men and money to enable him to beat off his assailants. In response to his call the Sultan ordered Mahomed-bin-Hamed to proceed at once to Awabi and endeavour to bring the parties to a settlement without bloodshed. On arrival, however, Saiyid Mahomed found the garrison much pressed and the besiegers in no mood to come to terms. He reported to the Sultan accordingly with all dispatch, and thereupon His Highness at once started for the Batineh in person, but on arrival at Seeb he met runners from the scene of action with letters for him to the effect that the Ibrieen had taken possession of the fort, the garrison having fled without a fight. The Ibrieen now offered to make over the fort to the Sultan or to hold it for him; but the latter thought it wisest not to put faith in their promises, but to garrison it with Wahabis, which he accordingly did. 7. In December dissensions arose between the Beni Byam and the Yemen of Zikki, the former being the aggressors. The reason for the collision proved to be that the Beni Eyam had attempted to build a new fort at Zikki, which wouldEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAE 1900-1901. 17 in fact givo them control over the roads leading to that place and constitute a permanent menace to the members of the Yemen also residing there. Any alteration of the status quo was equally injurious to the interests of the Sultan also and he accordingly addressed the Beni Buwaheh and enjoined them to take the advice of the Wali and revert to the old order of things. A few days later he was gratified to receive from his Wali a letter reporting that he had succeeded in establishing peace between the parties, and that the newly-built fortifications had been demolished. Before this satisfactory settlement had. been arrived at, some slight casualties had occurred. Prom January to the end of the official year, with the exception of one or two isolated cases of murder on sudden provocation or in payment of old scores, but which have had not tribal significance, complete tranquility has prevailed in Maskat and Oman. 8. In the distant province of Dhofar no events of any importance have been Dhofar and reported. Walj Sulaiman-bin-Suweilim still continues in nominal charge of the Sohar - district, but administers it through his Negro Deputy while he himself continues to rule the Sohar district, which also experienced a year of undisturbed quiet. 9. This port of Oman was in evidence a good deal at the beginning of the Sur. year owin^ to the Sultan's visit there and to incidents connected with the use of thePrench flag by some of the Jenebeh and Beni Abu Ali, dhow-owners of that port. Though Sur is but 80 odd miles from Maskat and one of the largest outlying ports in his territory, strange to say the Sultan had never previously set foot in the place since he succeeded his father Saiyid Turki twelve years ago, and his relations with his Suri subjects had always been of a strained and unsatisfactory nature. On the occasion of his recent visit, however, which took place opportunely at the season (June) when all the dhows are back from their peregrinations in the Indian Ocean and lie beached upon the banks of the Sur Creek for their annual overhauling. His Highness was extremely well received by the community, and on the news of his arrival reaching the near interior, the Chief of the Beni Abu Ali, Abdulla-bin-Salim, hurried in from Jaalan with a force of 1,200 armed men to do him honour. During the few days of the Sultan's sojourn all the holders of French flags and articles, some 45 in number, put in his hands a written expression of their intention to cease from sailing under the French flag from that date; and they undertook to make rendition of their flags and papers during the next season's voyage of their craft to their respective ports of registry. This period will be coming to an end in a few weeks, and it remains to be seen how far they will adhere to their intention. Be that as it may, His Highness seems now to realise that the indulgence with which he has treated this community in the past has had effects altogether prejudicial to his interests, and to be determined to assert his authority over them more effectively in the future. 10. During the year under report His Highness the Sultan moved about in his Sultan 's Tours territory, whether on long or short excursions, more frequently and to a greater extent than he has ever done in the past, and I am assured by natives with knowledge of what is passing in the interior that his increased energy in this regard has resulted in some enhancement of the practical respect with which he is held in the interior. I am also of opinion that the restoration to the Vazirship of his old family .retainer Saiyid Saeed-bin-Mahomed and the consequent benefit of the latter's experienced counsels have also tended not a little to improve His Highness's position and relations with his subjects of the hinterland. In any case it is certain that he shows more inclination to leave his capital from time to time and move about among his subjects in the inte rior than has hitherto been his habit, and this can hardly fail to extend and strengthen his influence among them. 11. The Political Agent during the year visited the ports of the Batineh ^° 1 *^ 1 tourg Coast, viz.) Seeb, Burka, Suweik, Kkaboora, Sohar and Shenas, and to the south of Maskat, Kurryat and Sur. The communities of British Indian traders at those places seemed to be prospering and contented. There were indeed a few com plaints of the Sultan's Walis being unable or disinclined to enforce for them the payment of acknowledged debts by their Arab customers, to which the Sultan s attention was drawn, and there was the general complaint that Customs duty was levied in full from them while Arabs from the interior paid or not as they chose. The Sultan is endeavouring to better the state of things in this respect, at all events at the larger ports, but the difficulty is one which has alwaysV 18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL General existed and which only time and the gradual strengthening of the ruler's administration and influence will effectively eliminate. 12. Customs. —An interesting feature of the year under review has been the administration of the Customs by the Sultan's own arrangements. Erom time immemorial it had been the habit of the rulers of Maskat to sell annually to one of the Banian traders the right to collect &lt;c Customs ' at Maskat and Muttra, and this individual practically became banker to the local Government for the current year. This was a convenient arrangement from some points of view, but on the expiry of the last contract His Highness, being in a prosperous financial position at the time, determined to try the experiment of levying the Customs dues himself, and it is satisfactory to know that after a complete year's experience he finds his revenue increased, after paying expenses, by about 20,000 dollars. Considering that this is the first year of a new organisation, the levy has been carried on with reasonable efficiency and consideration by the Sultan's Hindustani officials, but there can be no doubt that the Customs revenue of the port would still reach higher figures if His Highness were to appoint a fully qualified official of some standing to the charge of its administration. 13. Indemnity tax, —The balance of the indemnity due to British subjects for losses suffered in the rebellion of 1895 s has been at length liquidated by the Sultan, and almost all the parties concerned have appeared to claim the balances due to them. 14. Pearl dispute. —A remarkable dispute, in which the Sultan was in terested, connected with the discovery and sale of a pearl of extraordinary value, which had been going on for more than a year and from time to time threatened to assume very serious proportions, has at last been amicably settled by a committee consisting of certain of the Trucial Chiefs assisted by experienced Muslims. The case seems to have been a test' one, and difficult questions were involved affecting the rights of the owner of soil and the sovereign, one of whose subjects was the fortunate finder, to a share in the profits on the sale of the gem. The latter was a Kumzar subject of the Sultan of Maskat, and His Highness was, it is understood, awarded a third share in the value of the pearl. It is said, how ever, to be still deposited with some banker in Bombay and unsold though mortgaged, so that it is not impossible that the last has still to be heard of it. 15. Arms traffic, —As the trade returns demonstrate, not only does the traffic in arms show no signs of abatement, but the value of it has more than doubled itself during the past year (the direct London-Maskat steamers calling much more frequently than heretofore) and has returned practically to the same figure at which it stood in 1897-98, previous to the Baluchistan seiTAJiVQ. This year's figures received from the Sultan may be considered reliable, as the Customs collection having been in His Highness's own hands his official has taken pains to make sure of the exact contents of each case with a view to the correct levy of duty. It is doubtful if the traffic has even yet reached its culminating point, for the demand seems to grow with the supply. The import is still mostly in the hands of British traders, but foreign subjects have embarked in it during the year and others are expected to follow. The following details in round figures give some idea of the destination of the weapons:— T otal imported from Europe during the year (a) Arms. 25,000 Ammunition. 3,225,000 (5) Numbers for which the Sultan has been asked to issue passes for re-export by sea to the ports of Batineh Coast up to Has Mussendim . . , • Proportion which has left Maskat by sea without passes or gone into the interior by land from Maskat 13,000 1,059,000 12,000 2,166,000 25,000 3,225,000 With regard to («), it is known that the demand for arms at the Batinen Coast and Northern Oman Ports is very small indeed, and it follows from thisRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1900-1901, 19 that the greater part of these quantities bave been deflected to other markets in the Gulf. 16. Visit of the Bishop of Lahore, —On the 1st of December the Bight Ee- verend G. A. Lefroy, Bishop of Lahore, paid Maskat a short visit, his primary obiect being to visit the grave of the late Bishop Erench who died here in 1891 while labouring as a missionary. His Lordship read the Consecration Service at the European cemetery in Shaikh Jabar Cove and also at a new burial ground recently granted by His Highness the Sultan near the American Mission house primarily for the burial of members of the Native Christian community. 17. Though the epidemic dealt with in last year's report just ex- Epidemics, tended into the current year, Maskat was declared free in May, and has happily remained so up to the end of the year. Maskat may still be considered very fortunate, however, if an outbreak does not occur before the great heat of May brings comparative safety, for one or two cases have already occurred on the Gulf steamers, and with the disease so bad in Karachi and Bombay it is not to be wondered at that mail steamers are arriving in a suspicious condition. Preventive measures. —Our immunity so far must be in no small measure due to the careful and painstaking execution of the preventive measures in force by Captain E. A, Smith, I. M.S., the Agency Surgeon, to whom His Highness has wisely entrusted his arrangements. 18. News of the grievous calamity which fell upon the Empire in the death Death of Her of Her late Gracious Majesty the Queen Empress Victoria reached Maskat Majesty the mih. practically no previous warning on the 25th January and caused the most v?c 0 t e oria mpre8S universal consternation among all classes. His Highness the Sultan, who evinced every possible mark of respect for Her Majesty's memory and sympathy with Her subjects, caused 101 minute guns to be fired from his saluting battery on receipt of the news and caused the shops in the bazar to be closed and the Mahomedan Id festivities, which were then in progress, to be suspended in respect to Her august memory. His Highness, the representatives of Eoreign powers and representative deputations from the British Indian communities paid visits of condolence at the British Consulate. 19. His Excellency the Naval Commander-in-Chief, Rear-Admiral D. H. Kavy. Bosanquet, visited Maskat in his flagship H.M.S. Highflyer on 14th March, having previously touched at Sur en route. The usual cordial exchange of visits between His Highness the Sultan and His Excellency took place, Maskat was visited during the year by H.M.S. JPomone, Lapwing, Assaye^ Sphinx, Cossack, Redbreast, Figeon, 'Racoon and the flagship Highflyer. foreign Navies were represented by three Erench men-of-war, Drome, Catinat and Acheron, 20. No slave dhows were brought in for adjudication at Maskat by any of slave Trade, the cruisers of the Persian Gulf Squadron. Eifty-three fugitive slaves applied during the year for protection and freedom, out of whom three left the protection of the Consulate during the investigation, four were dismissed not being slaves, and forty-six were given freedom under the Treaty stipulations of 1873. Seven Africans were sent direct to Zanzibar, in accordance with the orders of Government, for repatria tion of such of the liberated Africans as may be suitably employed on planta tion work at Zanzibar. 21. Captain P. Z. Cox, I.S.C., held charge of the office of the Political official Agent and Consul throughout the year. &gt; j changes. Lieutenant-Colonel Jayakar, Agency Surgeon, on completion of six months' extension of service granted to him, retired from the service after nearly thirty years' work in Maskat, and was relieved on 2nd May 1900 by Captain ^ A.

P art L—GENEEAL SUMMAEY. Bainfall and Harvest, —The season in Bnsliire was very unsatisfactory. The l. General, rains set in late and have been very deficient, only 2 inches 83 cents having been recorded. The prices of foodstuffs, at the close of the year, were very high, wheat selling at krans 25 and barley at krans 18 per Hashmi man of 124 lbs. In Bushire and its immediate vicinity, the crops have failed almost entirely, but in some of the surrounding districts, the rainfall has been more favourable and a fairly good harvest is expected. At Lingah there has been practically no rain for fourteen months, and a good deal of anxiety is felt as to the water-supply. At Shiraz the late rains have been good, and it is understood that the crop pros pects are at present satisfactory. On the Karun the rains came very late, but the late rains have been good, and towards the close of the year the price of grain declined considerably. The GovernorsUp of Bushire and Gulf Forts. —The Darya Begi resigned Ms appointment and left Bushire for Tehran on the 7th April, in obedience to the orders of the Persian Government. His successor, the Salar-i-Mo'azzem, nephew of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, was appointed on the 18th August 1901, but did not arrive in Bushire until the 23rd December. His deputy, the Moiz-el- Mumalik, arrived in Bushire on the 21st September. Fuhlic Teace and Tranquillity. —The year under review has been unevent ful. Subsequent to the departure of the Darya Begi affairs in Bushire were more or less disturbed, but no incident of any importance occurred, Tangistan appears to have been in its usual lawless state. Tublic Eealth.—ThQ past year has been a healthy one.^ A good deal of small-pox prevailed at Mohammerah, but appears to have died out now; and there have been cases in Bushire. The measures for the prevention of plague have been efficiently carried out under the superintendence of the Residency Surgeon. Currency. —The old krans and copper coins have been withdrawn from circulation, and new krans and nickel coins are now in general use. Administration of the Customs in the JPersian Gulf. —Ihe management of the Customs in the Gulf has remained in the hands of the Belgians, who have succeeded in extending their control generally throughout the Gulf. The Customs at Charbar and Gwettur, which were hitherto farmed by British Indian subjects, have now been taken over by the Belgian Administration. The port of Dilam also has been taken over, but Hyder Khan of Bandar Big has, it is understood, hitherto refused to hand over the control of the Customs at that port. The Shaikh of Mohammerah, and the Arabs who acknowledge hiin as Chief, are very averse to the abandonment of their ancient rights connected with the customs at Mohammerah and on the Karun river, and the Belgian Administration has not BADMmSTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL 4. Bahrein. 2. Oman- Mask at. 3. Oman Coast. S. Koweit and .Nejd. yet succeeded in extending its control in this direction. Negotiations on the subject are, it is understood, now proceeding at Tehran, where the Shaikh has sent a representative to lay before the Persian Government his views on the subject. At Bushire and the other Gulf Ports a transhipment fee of ^ kran per package has been introduced for goods transferred within the harbour, and j kran per package on goods landed and kept in bond and subsequently re-exported. A limit of twenty days has been fixed within which such goods may be re-exported, but this limit may be extended at the discretion of the Customs Administration. Availing itself of tbe prohibition which exists against the export of provi sions from Persia, the Customs Administration has lately seen fit to impose a 10 per cent, duty on barley, wheat, and rice and other articles of provisions, notwith* standing the fact that these may have paid the 6 per cent, import duty. This duty has been enforced in the case of provisions sent off to British ships within Persian waters. At-Lingah, which is an important port of transhipment for the opposite coast of the Gulf, this recent regulation is very unpopular, and it is probable that the prosperity of the place will suffer in consequence. I have not been able to ascertain the income derived from the Customs in the Gulf, as the Director-General is not allowed to communicate the figures. It is probable that a large increase of revenue over last year's figures has resulted, as various new charges have been introduced and the control of the Administra^ tion generally extended. Settlement of Claims for Compensation. —The Special Commissioner, Hissam-el-Vizareh, alluded to in last year's report, arrived in Bushire on the 29th April. His mission proved to be a total failure, as he had no sufficient authority from his Government to enable him to enforce his decisions, and consequently the local authorities gave him no assistance whatever. Major P. Z. Cox, I.S.C., was Political Agent throughout the year. Tran quillity has generally prevailed in the Sultan's dominions. His Highness suffered a great loss in the death of his faithful Vazir and adviser, Sayyid Saeed bin Muhammad. The Political Agent's report of the principal events in Maskat during the year forms Part II of this compilation. The past year has been unusually tranquil and nothing of any importance has occurred. The pearling season was satisfactory, and no cases of piracy or disturbances at sea took place. I visited the Coast in Eebruary, and saw most of the Trucial Chiefs. Hebay appears to be increasing in size and imports ance. Owing to the policy of the Customs Administration at Lingah, more steamers have recently visited the Coast, and landed goods direct, which would otherwise have been transhipped from Lingah. Mr, Gaskin was Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein throughout the year. The pearling season was satisfactory, and altogether the year has been a pros perous one. The Bedouins on the mainland have been giving a good deal of trouble, and the caravan route between Ojair and El-Hasa has been very unsafe. No piracies have occurred near Bahrein this year. The Turkish authorities have, as yet, taken no steps to punish the Behaih tribe who were responsible for the murder of the Chief's cousin, Shaikh Salman- bin-Diaij, alluded to in last year's report. The new Mutasserrif for El-Hasa arrived at Bahrein, on 3rd September, en route to Ojair. The Turkish authori ties, fearing trouble from the Bedouins, have taken steps to strengthen their position at Katif. The B. I. M. S. Investigator carried out, during the winter, a detailed survey of the Bahrein harbour and neighbouring waters. There appears to be no doubt that the defeat sustained by Shaikh Mubarak at the hands of the Amir of Nejd, on the 17th March, near Aneyza, was decisive. As is not unusual in Arab warfare, he was deserted in the hour of need by certain Bedouins of Nejd who had espoused his cause and who went over to the Amir's side, thus changing the fortune of the day. Mubarak's loss was very heavy and included his brother Hamud and other notables. The Amir's losses appear to have been considerable and to have included some leading men. After this defeat. Shaikh Mubarak returned to Koweit, and the Amir of Nejd, after inflicting punishment on certain tribes who had espoused M ubarak's cause, also returned to his capital. Towards the end of September, however, the Amir moved out and encamped for some time on the confines of Koweit, whence he kept up communications with the Turkish authorities at Basrah, demandingn^SID^XCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCt FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 3 their assistance for the purpose of exacting redress from the Shaikh of Koweit for his aggression on Nejd territory. Por three months he remained in the vicinity of Koweit, which was kept in a state of constant excitement. Early in January, apparently finding that he could expect no active support from the Turks, he returned to his own country. About the middle of January, an event of great importance occurred in the capture by Abdul Aziz, the son of Abdul Rahman-bin-Feysal, of Eiadh, the old Wahabi capital. Abdul Eahman is the brother of Abdullah-bin-Eeysal, the last of the Wahabi Amirs, and it was he who headed the revolt of the partisans of the A1 Saud dynasty against Muhammad Ibn Eashid, the Amir of ^ejd, in 1891, which met with no success. Up to the present, the Amir of Nejd has taken no active measures against Abdul Aziz, who has strengthened his authority at Biadh and gained many supporters. His Royal Highness the Salar-ed-Howleh was Governor-General of Arabistan, 6. Persian Luristan, etc., throughout the year. The Azam-es-Sultaneh was Lieute- Arabistan * nant- Governor of Arabistan from the middle of July to the end of the year. With the exception of the districts controlled by the Shaikh of Mohammerah, the country has been in a state of marked disorder. His Royal Highness the Shoa-es-Sultaneh, second son of the Shah, was 7. Fars and .appointed Governor-General of Fars, and arrived at Shiraz towards the end of Persian oast, April. He soon fell out with the Kawam-ul-Mulk, from whom he demanded a large sum of money, payment of which was refused by the K a warn, who took sanctuary in a mosque, subsequently proceeding to Tehran with his son, the Begler Begi, in response to a summons from the capital. The Shoa- es-Sultaneh ruled Fars with a strong hand and kept good order in the country. He does not, however, appear to have been popular. In January the Kawam returned to Shiraz and intrigues appear to have been soon set on foot against the Prince. Early in March, the state of affairs was very disturbed : the Prince was summoned to Tehran and left about the middle of March, the Kawam, who had also been summoned, following him a few days later. A new Governor-General, Asaf-ed-Dowleh, has since been appointed and is now on his way from Tehran to Shiraz. No political event of particular interest occurred at Lingah during the year. Lieutenant Hunt, the British Vice-Consul and Assistant Resident at Bunder Abbas, was invalided and took leave to England early in the year. Major Phillott, who was appointed to act as Consul at Kerman, in June, was placed in charge of the Bunder Abbas Vice-Consulate. Captain E. H. S. Boxer was appointed to the post in January. Mr. Whitby Smith proceeded on leave on 16th April, returning to India on 8. Persian Baiu- the 23rd December. During his absence, Mr. R. H. New officiated as Director, c lstan ' Persian Gulf Telegraphs, and was in Political Charge of the Makran Coast. Affairs in Persian Baluchistan have been at times very unsettled during the year,—Mir Mahmud Khan, brother of Abdi Khan, Chief of Dashtyari, having given a great deal of trouble, threatening to attack Charbar and looting in its vicinity. Hashem Khan remained as Governor at Bampur and appeared to be quite unable to maintain order in the district. Twelve slaves were given manumission certificates during the year. Four 9. Slave Trade. Africans, who had taken refuge at Bassidore and were living there, were, at their own request, sent back to Zanzibar. During the year under review, four cases of piracy on British Indian sail- 10 ' Piracies, ing craft occurred in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab bar. The Shatt-el- Arab itself is well patrolled by the Moez -es-Sultaneh, and the pirates, who come from places on the river, watch the opportunity of vessels being^ becalmed on the bar or waiting for the tide, to carry on their piratical operations. The difficulty of dealing with these piracies is that the authority within the river ^ is divided, one bank being Turkish territory and the other Persian, and each side throwing the responsibility on the other. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy have been in the Gulf at various n. Navy, times during the year:—H. M. S. Ufavctthou, JPoTyiouBi Fox, PevscuSi Cossctchj Pigeon, Lapwing, Redbreast, Assays, and Sphinx. t i t » i • Of Foreign Navies, the Russian cruiser Varyag arrived at Bushire on 15th December. She left for Koweit on the 21st and, on her way down the b a4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Gulf, visited Lingah and Bunder Abbas. The Prench cruiser Catinat arrived at Bushire on 15th February, having visited Bunder Abbas and Lingah on her way up the Gulf. She proceeded to Koweit on the 19th, returning to Bushire on the 23rd February and left for Maskat on the 27th. 12. official Lieutenant-Colonel C. A.

During the past year, there have been no serious upheavals in the in-Political, terior of any political consequence, or calculated to cause the Sultan personal anxietv; and with the exception of one locality, Oman generally has enjoyed a satisfactory measure of immunity from the petty intertribal wars which tend so much and so frequently to hinder the agriculture and prejudice the trade of the country, and Maskat itself has been free from the usual scares of attack by Bedouins. - 2. Wadi Manwal. —The exception above mentioned is afforded by the tract comprising the Wadi Maawal and Nakl, i .e., the hinterland of the small port of Barka, 40 miles west of Maskat, which has been much disturbed for the last seven or ei^ht months from the results of an internecine feud, which though not extending to a wide stretch of country, has nevertheless from time to time made travelling so unsafe in the area affected, as to bring caravan traffic to and from that neighbourhood to a complete standstill. Such feuds are generally prosecuted in the slack season, after the date crops have been safely gathered, when the fire-eating elements of rival clans, freed from the cares of husbandry, and in want of useful employment, seek diversion in preying upon their neighbours or reviving old quarrels. The present case was no exception to the rule, and the spark necessary to light the fuse of tribal discord seems to have been generated at the end of August, when news reached the Sultan that a party of Beni Euwaheh inhabiting Nakl had killed two men of the Beni Eiyam, and that intertribal hostilities had been declared in conse quence. Shaikh Eashid-bin-Uzaiz, Governor of Semail, was forthwith deputed to proceed to the locality and endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties before matters' had assumed serious proportions, and this official returned to Maskat in due course, reporting that his mission had been successful. Within a few days of his arrival, however, hostilities broke out afresh, and he had to return and repeat his efforts, but with no better success than before. During the months following, the Shaikhs of one party or the other repeatedly addressed communications to the Sultan, stating that they were anxious for the cessation of hostilities, and requesting him to send a repre sentative of his own to arbitrate between them ; and His Highness as often com plied with their representations, deputing at one time Shaikh Eashid before men tioned, and at another, Sayyid Badr-bin-Saif, the military member of his council —but all to no purpose. Truces were no sooner arranged and signed by the elders than they were violated by some headstrong tribesmen and a revival of general hostilities inevitably resulted, and during the despatch of the Sultan s last peace mission to the tribes concerned, an unfortunate incident occurred, which merits passing notice. # * -r. -i i i i The deputation in question left Maskat in a large party for Barka by land, intending at that place to pick up ' Khafeers,' or protective guides, to conduct them in safety to the rendezvous. They persuaded the aged Kazi of Barka, a venerable and much respected greybeard and himself a Maawali, to accompany them in this capacity, hoping no doubt that his religious influence would assist HG^otiations ' The cavalcade had lost touch with Barka on their outward journey and was just entering the Wadi Maawal, when it was ambuscaded by a body ot Maawalis and Beni Euwaheh, who (whether by design or mistaking them for enemies has not been satisfactorily ascertained) opened fire upon the party and emptied the saddle of the unfortunate Kazi at the first discharge, killing him on the spot. Apparently they soon realised that they had killed an elder of their own community, for they ceased firing and did not molest the deputation further. The latter, however, did not proceed on their way, but returned to Barka with the Kazi's body for burial, and in order to communicate the news to the Sultan.8 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL This incident, regrettable as it was, seems to have had the effect of bringing the parties to their senses, for hostilities practically ceased from that time, and on 4th March, the welcome news was received of the conclusion of peace. As the hot weather and the date season are fast approaching, there are some grounds for hoping that this present settlement will be more lasting than its predecessors. What seems to be wanted under such a set of circumstances, is that the Ruler should make the quarrel his own when once a truce, negotiated by his intervention, has been violated, and that he should come down with a heavy hand on the offending party. This, however, in practice entails a costly expedition, and hence it is, no doubt, that the Sultan prefers within limitations to leave the tribes to tilt at one another until they tire of the game, and to hold aloof him self until circumstances force him to interfere. On the score of temporary con venience and economy, such a policy may have its advantages, but it cannot ultimately be for the best interests of the country, the commercial prosperity of which must naturally bear a direct ratio to the degree of 'tranquillity prevalent in the interior. 3. Sohar. —Towards the end of the hot weather, Suleiman-bin-Suweilim, the Sultan's 'Wali at Sohar, created a little diversion by a small expedition on his own account, his objective being the Port of Beit-el-Ainein in the Dhahireh country, about 80 miles south-west of the port of Sohar. Owing to its being advantageously situated from a strategic standpoint, this stronghold has always been a coveted possession among the tribes, and during the last century has many times changed hands; but for some years past it has been held against all comers by the Miyaiheh section of the Beni Ghafir, and on the present occasion Suleiman-bin-Suweilim seems to have come to some personal arrangement with the Beni Kalban tribe, by which they agreed to assist him to wrest the fort from the Miyaiheh and hold it for the Sultan. ^ It is believed that responsibility for the inception of these operations rested orginally with Suleiman-bin- Suweilim personally, but once they were started His Highness had to give the expedition his countenance, and to respond to Suleiman's appeal for assistance in the direction of money and commissariat. The venture proved abortive, however, the Wali and his adherents being obliged to desist after losing heavily; and the Sultan, then realising that the fort could not be reduced except at a heavy cost in men and money, sent orders to his Wali to return to Sohar. ! Before quitting the subject of the politics of Oman, it must be noted that during the year under review, the Sultan's eldest son, Sayyid Taimoor, has begun to enter into public life and to help his father in small matters of internal government. 4. Sur and coal deposits in vicinity. —This year again the port of Sur has been the centre of a good deal of interest, arising from a variety of causes, in cluding two expeditions in the neighbourhood connected with the examination of certain coal deposits reported to exist there. These deposits had in fact been known to exist for some years, but had not hitherto attracted any serious atten tion^ and the Sultan, having no expert information at his disposal as to the quality of the coal or the probable quantities available, was consequently uncertain as to what attitude he could most wisely adopt towards private enter prise suggested to him in connection therewith. On the matter being referred to them, the Government of India consented to afford His Highness the neces^ sary assistance in determining the value of the seams, and decided to depute a mining expert to examine and report upon them. The two expeditions subsequently undertaken having already been reported upon in detail, it seems unnecessary to record more here than a short outline of what occurred. ( E iest E xpedition.) On the first occasion, the Geologist deputed was Dr. A. Von Krafft, Ph. D., of the Geological Survey of India, who arrived in Maskat on 10th April. After waiting three days in the hope that the arrival of one of His Majesty's ships for duty in Maskat would have enabled us to get down to Sur expeditiously, we were eventually obliged to leave by dhow on 14th April.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 9 In the first locality which we visited, — Kalhat, about 60 miles south-east of Masqat,—we were received in the most friendly way by the local tribesmen, but from the moment we entered the Musharifeh country near Sur we met with the utmost hostility and obstruction. It appeared that the disaffected community at that port had circulated among the Shaikhs of the Sharkiyeh, fantastic and sinister misrepresentations of our motives in exploring the country, and the Sultan's old enemies, Aysa-bin-Saleh (son and successor of the rebelleader who led the operations against Maskat in 1895) and Hilal and Mohsin, the sons of Amr, partly perhaps believing these stories, and partly no doubt perceiving that a good opportunity was afforded them for giving play to their enmity to the Sultan and making things unpleasant for him, came down with a following from the Sharkiyeh, and preached a petty Jehad against us among the ignorant Musharifeh Bedouins through whose country our route to the coal seams lay. Among the various canards circulated, was one to the effect that the Sultan was in collusion with the British Government to sell Sur to them, and that the coal-hearing tract was being exploited in connection with a railway to be con structed from Sur, and thence round through the Sharkiyeh to Maskat. A whole month was spent in the most trying negotiations and in patiently endeavouring to overcome, first the suspicions of the tribes, and subsequently the cupidity of Aysa-bin-Saleh and his companions. At last, with the assistance of the Sultan, who was good enough to come down to Sur by mail steamer to assist us, and to depute his son Sayyid Taimoor to accompany us throughout, we managed to reach the goal, but not until we and our escort had been ambus caded and fired at, just as we were entering the hills in which the coal is found. Once having been permitted to set foot in the tract, it might have been expected that we should have been left to continue our work unmolested ; but the tribal feeling among the ignorant Musharifeh had been roused to such a pitch of inflammability by the malevolent preaching of the disloyal Hinawi fehaikbs, and rifles were emptied on such slight provocation, that it became impossible under such conditions to conduct any sustained geological examination of the district, and we were obliged to content ourselves with a superficial examination of the deposits, and a collection of samples of the coal; returning to Maskat with the Sultan on 25th May after an absence of seven weeks. (S econd E xpedition.) On receiving Dr. von Krafft's report, the Government of India felt that the evidence obtained of the extent and quality of the deposits, was not of a sufficiently complete nature to enable them to give satisfactory advice to the Sultan in the matter; it was therefore decided, as soon as the cold weather set in, to despatch another expedition, and Dr. von Krafft was again deputed. Unfor tunately, he died very suddenly when on the point of starting from India, and Mr. R.'D. Oldham, also of the Geological Survey of India, took tip the work in his place. On this occasion, profiting by the unexpected experiences^ of the first expe dition, it was possible for the Sultan to take measures a long time in advance m order to come to a thorough understanding with the tribes concerned, who, more over, in the interval which had since elapsed, had come to realise that on theaormer occasion they had been used by Aysa-bin-Saleh for his own private^ ends, and that in reality, so far from having anything to lose by the exploration of their country, they had everything to gain by the prospect of a possible trade m coal which it offered them. On this occasion, the Political Agent again accompanied the party, and, to save time, arranged to rendezvous with Mr. Oldham at Khor Jerama near lias-el-Haad, from which point it was decided to make a start, tne road being reported better for transport than that leading from Sur. Captain H. H. Dowding of the Essex Regiment, who happened at the time to be starting on a tour in the Persian Gulf, was also permitted, with the Sultan's concurrence, to accompany the expedition which marched out trom Khor Jerama on 3rd November. , . ^ w t -p Sayyid Taimoor and Sayyid Mahomed-bm Nasir the Wall of Muttra, accompanied us on hehalf of the Sultan, together with a large escort of Beni Abu Hassan and Musharifeh, and no difficulties were experienced beyond the10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL ordinary slight inconveniences incidental to travelling in a barren and waterless country with, a large caravan. Mr. Oldham's investigations occupied about a fortnight, and he left Sur for Maskat and India on 21st November. JPrima facie, the opinion which he came to with regard to the coal seemed to be, that it did not exist in sufficient quantities to repay the cost of working in such a difficult country, but up to the conclusion of the year his official report has not come to hand. After the departure of Mr. Oldham and his Native miners. Captain Dowding remained with me in Sur, in the hope of my being able to arrange to return to Maskat by land through the Sharkiyeh. Arrangements for this were in progress, and I think the journey could have been carried through, but the contemplation of it seemed to cause His Highness the Sultan a considerable amount of anxiety, and therefore, in deference to his express wishes, I felt bound to relinquish the project for some other occasion. It was arranged, however, that we should land at Daghmar near Kurriyat, and return to Maskat, via the Devil's Gap, the 'Wadi Tyin, and the Semail Valley. Accordingly, disembarking from His Majesty's S. Lapwing at Dagh- mar, on 1st December, we reached Maskat on 10th idem, after an interesting journey of 150 miles. 'We were most hospitably received by the tribes on our route, except at one of the small villages in the adi Tyin, named Akda, inhabited by 30 or 40 of the Beni Uifiar Battash. We had two Shaikhs of the tribe with us, as ' Khafeers,' and in the other villages of this tribe had been made welcome, but this particular hamlet seems to be inhabited by a community of ignorant and turbulent characters, who turned out en masse with their matchlocks, and barred the way to our caravan and baggage guard, which was winding peacefully along the Wadi Tyin, waiting for orders to halt for the night. No harm had resulted when we arrived on the scene, but the villagers, with the fuses of their matchlocks lighted, were in a very excited state, and had one rifle been discharged, on purpose or by accident, it would have inevitably resulted in a general fusillade and a good deal of bloodshed. As it was, after an houi's delay, we passed through to the next village of the same tribe, where the inhabitants made us welcome and were profuse in their apologies for the behaviour of their neighbours, who were also subsequently said to be craving for pardon. The excuse given was, that the villagers had received no previous warning of our approach, and were alarmed and suspicious at the arrival of such a large caravan in their midst. Such a plea might have been accepted for a momentary scare, but was no adequate reason for their maintaining their offensive attitude after the arrival of their own tribal elders on the scene, and the villagers of the adjoining hamlet, where we camped for the night, were told to let their comrades know that the matter would not be allowed to rest where it was. Such incidents as the above are inseparable from travel in an unsettled country like Oman, and it is undesirable to attach too much importance to them; but, as it turned out in the present instance that this village of Akda had treated Colonel Miles' caravan in precisely the same way when he passed through the Wadi Tyin in 1884, His Highness Sayyid Eeisal agreed with me that the offence could not be considered as condoned by the mere apologies of the, tribe concerned, and that further notice must be taken of it, and I am able to report, that at the time of writing one man of the village implicated is in durance vile in Maskat, and that action will be taken against others when they or their goods appear at the coast. 5. The French Flag. —I can hardly dismiss Sur from notice without touching upon the important subject of the Trench Flag in Oman waters— a question of vital consequence to the Sultan, which, it is to be hoped, will soon arrive at a definite adjustment. In last year's report, mention was made that an undertaking had been given to the Sultan, during his visit to Sur in June 1900, by which the Erench flag-holders among his subjects voluntarily engaged to cease from flying the Prench Plag over their dhows and to return their papers at their respective ports of registry before a certain date, and in conclusion it was observed that the period will be coming to an end in a few weeks and it remains to be seenRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 11 how f an* they will adhere to their intention.' As was anticipated from subse- auent events, the Suris broke faith, and so far from, making any rendition of their ' Titres de Navigation,' they were at pains to get them renewed, and then resumed their former defiant attitude towards the Sultan. A fresh instance of the form which this attitude takes was recently afforded. Profiting by the presence of the Sultan himself at Sur-el-Bilad, in connection with the coal exploration, the Customs farmer at the port of Sur took the opportunity of complaining to him personally against a number of his Suri sub- iects, for non-payment of moneys alleged to be due by them on account of Customs duty not paid. The Sultan sent the complainant into Sur with a letter to the chief Shaikh, to whom he gives a regular stipend, instructing him to confront the parties, and if a settlement could not be arrived at between them, to send them out to him, or words to that effect. . _ . . The next day the Shaikh replied to the Sultan that he had communicated with the parties, and that certain of them had gone over their accounts and settled the Customs farmer's claim, but that the others, who were holders of TVench Hags, had informed the writer that they refused to make any reply to the claim which they intended to refer to the French Consul. This incident occurred to the Sultan himself ; but similar situations constantly present them selves to his Wali, whose authority is altogether undermined thereby. It is not surprising, therefore, that such a state of things should be intensely gallmg to the Euler of Maskat, and should make him determined to lose no effort to put an end to it by such constitutional and dignified means as it is in his power as an independent sovereign to employ. , . ... . The French Government, it must be taken for granted, has not hitheito realised the practical results, as above set forth, of the distribution of the tri colour among the members of such a community. . • „ , ,. In treating of the question generally, the suggestion has from time to time been made, and perhaps not without circumstantial grounds, that these flags are accepted by the Suris to enable them to carry slaves under cover thereof, with an impunity due to the fact that the GovernmentoftheRepublic hasnevei ratified the Articles of the Brussels Act dealing with the flight of Search though in the Protocol to that Act, dated 2nd January 1892, it was plainly stated that ratification was only £&lt; provisionally reserved P e ^ in ^ agreement.' The above complaint is doubtless a difficult one to prove, from the very fact that no search is permissible. 'What however is aUogether beyon d s- pute, is the fact that Sur has been from time immemorial, andstiU ^thechief centre for the distribution of enslaved negroes all over the Gulfs of Oman and Persia, and that the Sur community generally are by habit and tradition sup- g~l ot the mwnbera of such a fratermty (even supposing the practice to be compatible with the principles of LtrSnallaw! which 'the Sultan of Maskat by no meansadmis, the French Government not only give colour to the patronizing, and thus indirectly encouraging m their operations a ary slave-dealers or slave-owners, but are at the same ^ difficult territorial authority of the sovereign of the sol ^. and h f^^? s ^ered into with for him to fulflUhe obligations imposed upon him by Treaties entered other powers for the suppression of the traffic. ,, , n-nvernment When this practical aspect of the case is broug Sultan of Maskat of the Republic, as sooner or later it seemingly mus '. x i | 1V them in a no doubt confidently hopes, that the question ^i diotite in the inter- manner which the traditions and dignity of a great nation ests of civilisation and of a friendly if weaker btate. _ 1 . . , . . 6.

His extended absence at Sur likewise left the Sultan little time for touring elsewhere, and on the one or two occasioos on which he has made arrange ments to absent himself from Maskat for a few days, they have been upset by some unforeseen urgency calling for his presence in the capital. While on the subject of the Sultan's absences from Maskat, I take the opportunity to express my appreciation of the cordial and effective assistance and co-operation always rendered to myself and the Agency Surgeon by Sayyid Mahomed-bin- Turki, when carrying on the government for his brother on snch occasions. 7. British Indian subjects in Maskat and Oman. —During the year, the Political Agent made two sea trips to different ports of the Oman littoral, visit ing the small communities of British Indian traders residing at Sib, Barka Khabura, Luwa, Kurriyat and Sur. Unless it happens that the visit is in connection with some particular occur rence needing investigation, there is little to be done on shore during these visits; but the mere fact of the Political Agent putting in an appearance occa sionally, or even the sight from time to time of a British man-of-war in the near offing, is sufficient to give our small British-Indian fraternities in such isolated situations a greater measure of respect and security, than they might otherwise be accorded by their Arab neighbours. During the year robberies have been committed on the premises of British subjects at Luwa, Sur and Barka; also one trader was waylaid and looted on his- way back from the interior, where he had been to recover debts; and one bania of Mesnaa complained of wrongful confinement and ill-treatment by the Wail of that port. In all^ these cases the Local Government has shown a commendable disposition to see justice done. In the more important case, that of wrongful confinement at Mesnaa, the Wali was removed for that and other misdemeanours, and his deputy, who'was immediately responsible for the incident, imprisoned. In the theft cases, the value of the stolen property having been investigated and assessed by a commit tee appointed jointly by the Sultan and the Political Agent, compensation to the amount arrived at has been recovered from the culprits, or disbursed by the Local Government. A second case of theft at Barka is still under investigation, and a committee has not yet been formed, but it will shortly be disposed of. General. # 8. Customs. —It will be remembered that last year the Sultan for the first time took the Customs Administration under his own control, instead of farming it out to a contractor, the result being a satisfactory increase of revenue to His Highness. This year the revenue assessed on the value of trade, according to figures furnished by the Customs Superintendent, amounts to some Jfts. 4,000 less than last year, but this difference is more than accounted for, by the untoward fact that during the year 2 vessels with valuable cargoes bound for Maskat have never been heard of a and presumably foundered at sea; one being the clipper sailing- ship County of Forfa owned by residents in Maskat, and 'bound from Calcutta with cereals, and the second the S.S. Basuto from London, with arms and ammnnition. There have been occasional complaints from merchants, of incon siderate treatment at the Customs House by the Sultan's officials, sometimes well founded, sometimes not; but I have always found His Highness anxious to remove * causes of complaints when brought to his personal notice, and to meet merchants half-way as far as lies in his power. The great desideratum at present is, undoubtedly, the improvement of the Cus tom house, wharf and premises, which are not a credit to the State, but I am glad to report that the Local Government has lately started work in this direction, which.EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 13 it is hoped, will be carried to completion. It is interesting to record here that the satisfactory pecuniary results of his Customs Administration at Maskat, have prompted the Sultan to assume the direct control at other ports in Oman, of which hitherto the Customs have been ' farmed'. Barka, Mesnaa and Suweik on the Batineh coast have already been taken in hand, and also Sur to the south of Maskat, and it is expected that other ports will follow as time goes on. In order to facilitate the collection of dues at Sur, where the inhabitants have always been very difficult to deal with in this connection, it was His Highness's lirst idea to build a wall on the land side, so as to restrict all import and export caravan traffic to the use of certain gates where Customs guards w r ould be sta tioned. On going into the matter on the spot, however, he realised that owing to the difficulty of obtaining materials and labour at Sur itself, the building of a wall of effective length would take a year or more to complete, and he therefore chose the more economical and speedy alternative of creating a line of block houses on the hills between Sur-el-Bilad and the port of Sur, commanding the caravan routes to and from the interior. These were completed during his recent sojourn at Sur in November. This is decidedly a step in the right direction and will suffice for present purposes, but now that His Highness has taken the Customs collection of the port into his own hands, it is to be hoped that as the administration improves and increased revenue comes in, he will see his way to build a suitable Customs wharf at the entrance to the creek. In connection with the above block-houses, 100 extra sepoys have been engaged for garrison purposes at Sur. 9. The Arms Traffic. —It will be seen from the trade returns appended, that there has been a considerable decline in the quantity of arms and ammuni tion imported into Maskat during the year, the decrease being roughly 8,000 rifles and 1,400,000 cartridges. The difference is in some measure accountable for by the loss of S.S. Basuto before mentioned, and also by the fact that at the time the Customs House Returns were furnished by the Superintendent, delivery on all the cases received by the last two steamers had not been taken by the consignees, and duty had not therefore been collected on them. During the Political Agent's tours in the neighbourhood of Sur, and subse quently in the Wadi Tyin, nearer home, it was noticed that modern breech-loading rifles were comparatively few and far between in the first named, or Jaalan dis trict, but this was less the case in the Wadi Tyin. It is also worthy of note that the Bedouins are gradually learning to recap and reload their own _ cartridges ; in fact, a demand is beginning to spring up for new empty cases ; riflemen evi dently realising that it is more economical to load their own cartridges, often no doubt with home-made powder, and that the light empty cases are less trouble to transport from the coast. 10. Fearl Dispute—ThQ longstanding dispute mentioned in last year's report, which has been dragging on for more than two years, has at last been brought to a close. It will be remembered that the representative committee which was appointed to assess tlie shares of the several parties interested, awarded His High ness the Sultan 30,000 dollars, representing a one-third share of the value of the pearl in question, and a document was passed and signed by the Chier oi Snargan and others in ratification of the award. This sum was not forthcoming, however, owing to loss meanwhile sustained by the holders, who had evidently been spe culating with money borrowed on the security of ^ the pearl, and the Hesiaent after visiting Shargah, having informed His Highness that in his opinion Es. 12,(500 w r as the most he could hope to realise, Sayyid Eeisal wisely deferred to his opinion and expressed his willingness to content himself with that amount, taking into account the fact that in this typical test case, he had effectively proved his title to a definite royalty on the value of such prizes. 11. Death of the Vazir Sayyid Saeed -hin-Mahomed. Sayyid Saeed-bin- Mahomed-bin-Salimin, the Sultan's Vazir, who had for many years been promi nently identified with the political history of Maskat, died very suddenly on the 14th October 1901. Though he complained of a heavy cold m the morning, he was present at a Darbar at the palace in the evening, when the Commanders of Hisu ADMINIStliATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLlTIOAL Majesty's sliips Perseus and issaye visited His Highness the Sultan officially, in company with the Political Agent. Soon after the Darbar broke up, however, he sent for the Agency Surgeon, who only arrived to see Sayyid Saeed fall down dead after rising to greet him; apparently from an aneurism of the heart. It will be useful to record here a short outline of the late Vazir's career, which, needless to say, was chequered by those vicissitudes of fortune, which are ever characteristic of service under an oriental Government. Of Al-Bu-Saidi stock, his forbears had lived in Maskat for several generations, and the deceased himself, born in tlie reign of Sayyid Saeed-bin-Sultan, the present Sultan's grand father, received all his teaching and training at the capital, which, except for a few brief absences, he never quitted during the sixty odd years of his life. Sayyid Saeed was one of three brothers, the sons of Mahomed-bin-Salimin, one of whom died young, and the eldest, Thuwaini, became Yazir of his namesake Sayyid Thuwaini-bin-Saeed, in whose service Sayyid Saeed also first entered public life, being appointed to the charge of the Sultan's commissariat and trans- port arrangements. Subsequently, the two Thuwainis, Sultan and Vazir, became estranged to an extent which ultimately terminated in the deposition of the latter, w r ho was deported, or at any rate obliged to migrate, to Zanzibar, and was suc ceeded in his master's favours by his younger brother; and although Thuwaini returned to Maskat two or three years later, he was never again employed by his namesake, up to the time of the latter's assassination at Sohar in 1866. Following upon this event came four stormy years, during which Salim- bin-Thuw^aini and the Eostak pretender, Azzan-bin-Keis, each in turn held the reins of Government for a brief period, and Saeed-bin-Mahomed seems to have served both one and the other. At last, in 1871, Sayyid Turki returning from exile in India, possessed himself of the Sultanate, and appears at first to have taken both brothers into his employ ; but a few months after his accession the elder Ihuwaini was shot dead m the streets of Maskat, in retaliation, it was believed, for a previous murder in which the ex-Vazir was suspected of com plicity. For the next fourteen or fifteen years, Sayyid Saeed's life seems to have been uneventful, and he continued to pass his days peacefully in the service of Sayyid Turki. Towards the end of the latter's reign, however, relations between the Vazir and the Sultan, who w^as at this time a chronic invalid, seem to have under gone a marked change, and matters gradually went from bad to worse, until in May 1888 Sayyid Saeed was deposed, and compelled, much against his will, to leave Maskat; whereupon he took up his temporary abode, first at Kishm and later at Bunder Abbas. Meanwhile Sayyid Turki's state of health became suddenly critical, and in July, information reached the exile of his late liege's death at Barka, on receipt of which new r s he w r as emboldened to return to M askat in the confident hope that Sayyid Feisal, w^ho had now succeeded his father and whose interests he has always supported, w 7 ould welcome him back. In this however he was disap pointed, for in pursuance of some undertaking given by Sayyid Turki's three sons to their father on his death-bed, the new Sultan refused to sanction his remaining in Maskat, and obliged him to return to Kishm or Bunder Abbas. Later on, and partly owing to the fact that the British authorities exercised their good offices in his behalf, he was allowed to return to his home and pro perty in Maskat. Meanwhile his distant kinsman, Mahomed-bin-Azzan, had become Vazir. This functionary, having got into disfavour in 1896 for corresponding with the Sultan's enemies in the interior, was in turn deposed and heavily fined. Then Sayyid Saeed's chance came again and he was re-appointed. Sinister influences were at work, however, which brought about his second downfall in October 1898 ; but in May 1900, on the representations of the Political Agent, he was once more taken into favour and appointed Co-Vazir, and from that date up to the time of his death he remained in harness. . A man of masterful disposition and pronounced views which he did not hesitate to give expression to, it was not within the nature of things that he should have been a generally popular personality; but while on the one hand it is doubtful if the present Sultan ever had any personal regard for him, it is none the less certain that His Highness fully recognised the fact that in all mattersresidency and maskat political agency for the year 1901-1902. 15 lying beyond the scope of parochial politics the statesmanlike perspicacity of his kinsman was a valuable asset to himself. The friendly sentiments which Sayyid Saeed always evinced for the British Government and its representative, were no doubt, strengthened and enhanced by his experiences at the Delhi assemblage in 1877, on which occasion he was one of the deputation which His Highness the late Sayyid Turki sent to represent him at the pageant; and on many occasions, when issues of importance or delicacy have been pending between Government and the Sultan, the Political Agent's efforts have derived material assistance from the fact that as a medium of com munication with the Local Government, he had in Sayyid Saeed, the most able of the Sultan's retainers, and a man who, imbued with a firm belief in the bene volent intentions of the British Government towards the Mask at State, had the strength of character to speak his mind fearlessly in indicating to his master the path in which he believed the latter's best interests to lie. On the day of the Vazir's demise, the Sultan's Elag was half-masted and the several Consular representatives followed suit as a mark of respect to deceased's memory. They also paid visits of condolence at the palace, the Political Agent being directed to convey to His Highness expressions of regret on behalf of His Excellency the Viceroy and of the Eesident in the Persian Gulf on hearing of the loss which he had sustained. 12. On 26th November 1901, the telegraph cable, which had been extended from Jask across the Gulf of Oman to Maskat, was opened for traffic—an important event in the annals of Maskat. When the question of the extension was under consideration it was not estimated that the takings would amount to more than Rs. 1,000 per mensem, but the average of the first four months of its working is found to be about Rs. 1,500. 13. Maskat has enjoyed complete immunity from epidemic disease. The duties of Health Officer of the port were last year entrusted by the Sultan to the Agency Surgeon; and this year also, the preventive arrangements under his supervision have been carried out most satisfactorily and with an entire absence of friction. On the transfer of Captain F. A. Smith, I.M.S., to India just before the end of the year, His Highness wisely continued the same arrangement in the case of his successor, Captain J. W. Grant, I.M.S. 14. No slave dhows were brought in for adjudication during the year by Slave-Trade, any of His Majesty's men-of-war, and it is to be noted that for the last three seasons there has been no slave cruising under Admiralty orders. Fifty-four fugitive slaves applied to this Consulate during the year for protection and freedom. Of these one absconded while his case was under investigation ; three were dismissed as not being slaves, and fifty were given freedom with the con currence of the Local Government. The Africans were sent direct to Zanzibar, in accordance with the orders of Government providing for repatriation of Negroes. 15. Maskat was visited during the year by His Majesty's ships Cossack, Navy. Pigeon, Assaye, Sphinx, Perseus, Marathon, Fomone, Lapwing, Fox and Redbreast—audi by the Royal Indian Marine Steamers Minto and Investigator. Foreign navies were represented as under ;— French.— Jean JBart, Infefnet, Qatinat, Chasseloup Louhat, Russian.— Korniloff. —Note .—On the first voyage of this ship the Com mander informed the Sultan that he was an officer of the Russian Navy, and saluted the Port with 21 guns and asked for the salute to be returned. On her subsequent voyages she has passed as a mer chantman, and does not now salute the Sultan. 16 Captain F A. Smith, I.M.S., was transferred to India and handed over changes, his duties to Captain J. W. Grant, I.M.S., on 14th February 1902. Monsieur P. Ottavi, Consul for the French Republic, left for Europe on 5th July 1901, and was relieved by Monsieur R. Laronce. P. Z. COX, Major, Folitical Agent, Maskat. Maskat j The 2nd April 1902.

Exchange. Currency. Specie. The improvement in trade, both in import and 'export noticed in last year's report, soon declined owing to the partial failure of crops caused by the insuffi cient rainfall, and the year under review has not been a favourable one for trade operations. Although the statistics show a considerable advance in the extent of imports over the previous year, the result cannot be said to have been due to the transactions in any particular class of goods having proved remunerative, but rather to overspeculation encouraged by some firms who allow long credit indiscriminately to traders of little or no means. The total imports into Bushire during the year, excluding specie, amount to Rs. 2,01,70,511 or an increase of Rs. 16,22,229 on the previous year. The imports into Lingah also show an increase of Rs. 16,30,614. The increase is noticeable in almost every article imported into Bushire, specially in cotton piece-goods, glass and glassware, hardware and cutlery, kerosine oil, provisions and tea, all of which show an advance of over 50 per cent. Indigo shows a heavy decline of nearly two lakhs of rupees. Other articles showing more or less decrease are gold-lace and thread, metals, porcelain and chinaware, loaf and soft sugar and woollen goods. The class of goods which show an increase in imports into Lingah are yarn and twist, drugs and medicines, kerosine oil, provisions, loaf and soft sugar, tea and woollen goods. The exports from Bushire declined by Rs. 14,27,404 which is made up by a decrease under all the principal articles exported from this port. The only articles which show an increase are horses, hides and skins, rose-water, tobacco and wool. The exports from Lingah improved by Rs. 13,15,735, the chief items being pearls and shells, the former of which alone records an increase of Rs. 1'2,63,000 and the latter of Rs. 41,000. Owing to a scanty rainfall, the grain and other crops failed to the extent of about 50 per cent, and famine prices had actually to be paid for bread stuffs. Had it not been for the partial relief which was afforded by the abundance of fisheries in the Gulf and the plentifulness of the date crop in Turkish Arabia, the effect on the poorer classes would have been most disastrous. No shipments of wheat were made to the United Kingdom during the year, prices on this side being far too high. Towards the close of the year the embargo was reimposed and prices rose still higher and large quantities of grain were imported from India. Sterling exchange rates varied between krans 53 per pound sterling in January and March and krans 55 in September and December. Rupee exchange was lowest in May at krans 356J per Rs. 100 and highest in December, when it reached krans 367^ per Rs. 100. Bar silver to the value of over Rs. 30,00,000 was imported into Bushire during the year for transmission to Tehran and specie to the extent of four millions krans (Rs. 11,42,857) was sent up-country by caravan. The introduction of the nickel tokens mentioned in last year's report has had a very beneficial effect on the currency of the country and the complica tions arising from the debased copper currency in the ordinary market transac tions, have been finally removed. The only copper coin now seen in the market is the 2.shahi piece which is now accepted for ^-shahi. The old -J- shahi and 1-shahi pieces have entirely disappeared. The old silver coinage has also been withdrawn with the exception of ^-kran pieces which are still in circulation. The silver coins now current in the market are the 2-kran and 1- kran pieces minted by the Imperial Bank of Persia. Ihe total amount of treasure imported into Bushire wasRs. 43,01,661 or an increase of Rs. 14,24,007. The principal countries which contributed to the increase are United Kingdom^ R,s. 30,00,000, Turkey Rs. 9,60,926 and Persian ports Rs. 3,17,587. The specie imported into Lingah was Rs. 25,1^,000 or an increase of Rs. 7 ,06,000. In the export of specie from Bushire there was a decrease of Rs. 6,22,930, while from Lingah there was an increase of Rs. 6,76,000.EESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 17 During the beginning of the year, mule hire for Shiraz stood at krans 95 Mule hire per 100 maunds of 775 lbs. It went down to 80 krans in April, but in the latter part of May and during June and July the rate rose to kraus 100. Since then it has steadily risen till the quotation at the end of December stood at krans 110. One unsatisfactory feature in the transport of goods to the interior and which calls for serious attention on the part of the Persian Goyernment, is the obnoxious practice resorted to by its officials of impressment of pack animals on various pretexts of public emergency. This practice not unfrequently causes serious dislocation in the transport of goods entailing loss and annoyance to the merchants. To secure this impressment, the petty officials start in all directions to catch and blackmail all caravans which may come within their reach. The muleteers who are thus caught, are forced to unload their goods and to work for the officials without any remuneration. Some muleteers, in order to escape the impressment, pay heavy fines, while others, in order to avoid the harsh treatment, abandon the laden merchandise in any part of the road and fly to the hills. Meanwhile the abandoned goods lie for an indefinite period exposed to all sorts of risks. When the news of the impressment spreads, all caravan traffic ceases for weeks until the oppression subsides. Freight.— to London for the first six months of the year gradually dropped from 25s. to 23$. 'While in July it further fell to 19s., at which rate it remained standing until December, when owing to competition with a Russian steamer it declined to 15s. Shipping—One hundred and twelve vessels with a tonnage of 130,273 entered the port of Bushire during the year. Of these, 109 were British and 3 Russian. l%is, as compared with last year, shows a decline of 2 British, 1 Austrian and 1 Turkish vessels of the tonnage of 9,804, and an increase of 3 Russian of the tonnage of 4,513. The number of vessels which cleared from Bushire is 111 with a tonnage of 132,854. This shows a decrease of 8 British vessels of the tonnage of 3,938 and 2 Austrian of the tonnage of 3,827 and an increase of 3 Russian vessels of the tonnage of 4,513, or a net decrease, as com pared with the past year, of 7 ships and 2,687 tons. The number of vessels which entered the port of Lingah is 83 with a tonnage of 91,300 which shows an increase of 3 vessels and 3,300 tons. Of these, 81 were British and 2 Russian. Of those which cleared from Lingah, 45 were British with a tonnage of 49,500 and 3 Russian with a tonnage of 3,300. This shows an increase of 9 vessels and 9,900 tons over the figure of the previous year. It appears likely that British shipping will suffer from more serious competition in the future than has been the case in the past, and although the result of the Russian steamer which took cargo from the Gulf to London could not have been very advantageous to those con cerned, it is likely that when trade improves further attempts will be made in this direction. The heavy subsidies which it is said are paid to the Russian steamers will enable them to persevere in their attempts to obtain a share of the trade. Russian Commerce—k. new feature in this year's trade is the establishment of a direct line of steamers between Russia and the Persian Gulf, inaugurated by the two voyages of the S.S. Korniloff brought loaf sugar, kerosine oil, gold-lace and piece-goods, etc., of which the statistics are not available. Customs jldministrcttiofi. —The imposition of o per cent, customs duty on both imports and exports for European and native merchants was introduced in the beginning of the Persian official year commencing from the 21st March 1901. This of course met with a good deal of opposition at first on the part of the native merchants. The measure was, however, carried out and has worked smoothly, without having had any appreciable effect on trade. The landing and shipping companies which the late Director of Customs was endeavouring to introduce came to an untimely end by his premature death, and it is unlikely that the project will be renewed again. The facilities for landing and shipping cargo are still inadequate when more than one steamer is in port, and it is very desirable that the customs authorities should take early steps to put the matter on a satisfactory footing. In this connection it may be desirable to mention that until the control of the Gulf port customs was assumed by the present administration, the levy of the customs duties at Jiingah was regulated according to a special tanii which was18 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL in vogue from the time when the port was under Arab Governors. The com mercial importance of the port of Lingah is entirely dependent on the fact that it is used as a distributing centre for the Arab coast, and merchandise imported into Lingah for re-exportation abroad, whether it broke bulk or not, paid a nominal transhipment duty at so much per package. At the beginning of their control, the Belgian administration adhered to the former practice, but of late they have been more strict and a regular 5 per cent, duty has been levied on all goods imported into Lingah, and a similar rate at the time of re-exportation when the goods have broken bulk. If this is persisted in, it is possible that the British and other traders who deal with the Arab coast will send their merchandise direct, instead of by transhipment at Lingah, which will no doubt tell upon the prosperity of the place. Administration of Justice. —British merchants still suffer from the inatten tion of the Persian Government to their claims against Persian subjects. With reference to the remarks under this head in last year's report, one of the leading merchants and a gentleman of great experience in Persia writes that, taking into consideration the social, religious and political conditions of the country, he doubts the possibility of any improvement in the way of the administration of justice. He rather advises British merchants to exercise more caution in their dealings, and to avoid giving indiscriminate credit. Cotton Goods, —The increase shown is Es. 37,41,515 which has been due rather to over-speculation facilitated by a long credit system, than to actual increase in demand. In many cases cost prices have not been realized. Drugs and Medicines. —The increase (Es. 68,637) shown is not real but is specially due to the shipment of opium made abroad having been •returned on account of the drug being largely adulterated and not suited to the requirements of the market. Matches. —The increase of Bs. 36,289 shown under this head is due to over- speculation, and prices realized were greatly under cost. Kerosine Oil. —Owing to keen competition between rival firms in Bushire, prices have gone down considerably. Formerly there was only one firm which used to import, on a large scale, directly from Batoum and was in a position to regulate its own price. In 1900, the average price of a case of kerosine oil was Es. 4-8, while during the present year it went down to Es. 3, owing to large shipments which were brought by the S.S. Korniloff. Frovisions. —The increase of Es. 1,66,934 is chiefly due to a large quantity of flour and grain having been imported from India owing to high prices ruling in the the local market for wheat, etc. Loaf and Soft Sugar. —The decrease under this head is Es. 3,42,655 owing to the market being overstocked in the previous year and heavy shipments having arrived in the early part of the year under review, the prices fell very smartly and business was very much reduced. A steady decline in Marseilles, however, led dealers to operate again, but the arrival at the latter part of the year of 4,000 cases again sent prices down. Tea. —The increase of Es. 3,16,705 is simply due to speculation, and in the majority of cases, native merchants who had given large orders, declined to accept the consignments under some pretext or other, owing to the market being dull. Horses. —The increase under this head is Es. 22,520. The number of horses exported, though yet small compared with previous years, was an improvement on 1900. Cotton. —This article shows a decline of Es. 1,79,284 due to a 'canty crop and also to a dull market abroad. Almond Kernels. —There has been a large decrease of Es. 4,0^,870. The price of almond kernels which went up very high in the previous year, fell to 60^. in the present year, and there has been no improvement since. Persian sellers on this side having been misled by an unprecedented price of the previous year, invested this year at enhanced prices and did not care to sell unless they could cover cost. Thus a large stock has been left in the country unexported for want of inducement in the consuming markets abroad.RESIDENCY AND MASK AT POLITICAL AGE N C Y FOR THE YEAR 1901-1902. 19 Wheat. —The decline of Rs. 1,59,472 is due to no shipments having been made abroad owing to a partial failure of the crop and heavy prices ruling in the local market. Q um ,—The decline of Rs. 1,14,234 is owing to a dull market abroad and large quantities lying uncleared in London did not afford sufficient inducement to shipments being made to any considerable extent. Hides and Skins. —Trade in this article which had dwindled to a consider able extent due to plague and quarantine measures in India, is again regaining its old proportion, and this year the increase recorded is Es. 2,64,970. A large quantity was exported to India and to the United Kingdom. The shipments to India are, as a rule, intended for transhipment abroad. Qr)ium The^decrease under this head is Es. 5,30,575. Prices in China having J fallen heavily, merchants have been unwilling to part with their stock and a 5 large quantity is accumulated in the country. It is said that this fall in price is principally due to adulteration of the drug being carried on to a consi derable extent; and unless some supervision is exercised in the preparation of the drug, Persian opium may eventually be discredited in China. The attention shewn by Japan to Persian opium, is likely to promote exportation to that country. Two Japanese gentlemen, experts in opium, visited the principal opium centres in Persia to study the conditions of the trade and methods of the preparation of the drug. The decrease under this head is Es. 37,490 due to high prices ruling in the local market, and the markets abroad being overstocked. The export has been in the hands of regular shippers. Tohacco.—Wiz increase of Es. 67,890 is merely nominal. In reality the tobacco crop has been a failure, specially in the Ispahan district, where it is largely cultivated. It is said that the Societe-du-Tombac has sublet its conces sions to a syndicate of Turkish subjects in Beyrout, who have sent a representa tive to Ispahan. This monopoly continues to be distasteful to Persian merchants, but as the Societe pays a certain subsidy to the Persian Government, the priests and the merchants are unable to free themselves from the yoke of the foreign monopolists. Wool —Though the statistics show an increase of Es. 55,640, yet operations have been 'disappointing. The expected prices which led to the shipments were xicxt Carpets —The decrease of Rs. 2,63,384 is due to the overstocked state of the markets abroad, in consequence of which, shipments fell considerably. 0.

KEMBALL, Lieut-Col., Offg. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY EOR 1902-1903. Paet i.—geneeal summary. Eainfall and Earvest— Generally throughout Southern Persia, the rainfall I.-General,, during the winter of 1902-190B has been good, and the prospects of the harvest are better than they have been for many years. Locusts have done some damage to the crops in the districts adjacent to Bushire. In the Karun districts the crop prospects may be said to be excellent, and at Shiraz there is every hope of a really good harvest. The prices of foodstuffs have fallen and are likely to fall very considerably later on. In Bushire, at the close of the year, wheat was selling at 25 Krans and barley at 18 Krans per Hashmi Man of 124 lbs. 2. The OovBTfiOTship of Bushive and Gtulf FoTts, —His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim has been Governor throughout the year, and it is understood that he will remain in office for the coming year. 3. Fuhlic Peace and Tranquillity.—Good order was maintained in Bushire and its neighbourhood during the year. In January 1903, the^ Governor sum moned to Bushire Zayer Khader, the Zabit or Headman of Tangistan. Eelying on the assurances given to him, Zayer Khader complied and came to Bushire, but on the 3rd February, as lie was leaving the Governor's residence after an apparently friendly interview with His Excellency, he was arrested. A scuffle ensued between Zayer Khader's men who had accompanied him and the Gov ernor's, and three of the latter were killed. Zayer Khader, however, remained in custody where he still is. It was thought at one time that local troubles would arise on account of this incident, and threatening letters were addressed to me and other Consuls in Bushire by Zayer Khader's following in Tangistan who came to the Imam Zada m Eeshire. Nothing, however, resulted and matters are apparently now quiet in Tangistan. , 1 ^ 1 Eour lame guns of position with carriages and ammunition were landed at (Omittrdin BusMrTfrom the S.S. Tigris on the 21st July. They were, it is said, shipped at Antwerp and are, it is believed, of Austrian make. The Persian Government have stated that it is intended to use these guns for saluting purposes at Bushire, Lingah, and Bunder Abbas, but they are still lying in the Customs wharf where they will probably remain some time longer. 4. Public Health.—K very severe epidemic of small-pox occurred in Shiraz during the summer months and a large number of children fell victims to the disease. In BusMre small-pox broke out during the winter and many persons succumbed to the disease. Cholera in epidemic form appeared m J y at Gwadur and lasted until the end of August. During this period 265 persons are reported to have died. In October the disease again appeared and lasted for a month carrying off 256 persons. On the 18th December a report was received from the Telegraph Station at Jask that cholera had broken out there. The disease originated in some villages in the vicinity of the Telegraph Station. By the end of the month the disease died out, but during this period, according7 11.—Oman— Maskat. 2 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULEVPOLITICAL to the report received from the Assistant Surgeon at Jask who supervised the observation camp in the neighbourhood of the station, 52 cases with 29 deaths occurred. The disease also appeared about the same time at Minab, 50 miles from Bunder Abbas. No authentic details regarding the progress of the disease at this place have been received, but many people are said to have died. The epidemic died out towards the end of January. The measures taken by the local authorities at Bunder Abbas in accordance with the advice of Assistant Surgeon Kirkpatrick were successful in keeping the disease out of Bunder Abbas. The measures for the prevention of plague throughout the Gulf have been efficiently carried out under the superintendence of the Residency Surgeon. 5. Administration of the Customs in the Tersian Gulf. —On the 23rd Sep tember 1902, a satisfactory settlement having been arrived at between the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the management of the Customs at Mohammerah and on the Karun was taken over by the Belgian Customs Administration, and was placed under the charge of the Director- General in Bushire. In February 1903, the Customs Department at Moham merah was separated from the Gulf Customs Department and placed directly under the Minister of Customs at Tehran, Monsieur Waffelaert being the first; Director-General of what is now termed the Arabistan Customs Department. Customs Houses have now, it is understood, been established at Bunder Nasri on the Karun and also at Dizful and Sbushter. On the 14th February 1903 the hitherto prevailing duty of 5 per cent. ad valorem on imports and exports was abolished and a new specific tariff was introduced. It is too early as yet to say for certain how the new tariff will affect trade generally, but the first impression was that the Indian tea trade would receive a serious check. I, however, am inclined to doubt if this will be the case, as the commodity, although the duty has been considerably raised, is a cheap one and its consumption has taken a hold upon the people of the country. The heavier classes of Manchester cotton goods may, it seems, be adversely affected. Export duties have generally been abolished; but the duty on opium, which is the most important article of export from Persia, has been largely increased. The introduction of the new tariff caused much consterna tion amongst the native merchants throughout Southern Persia, and telegrams were sent from Bushire and other places to the Shah and to the Minister of Customs praying for a postponement of the tariff for a period of three months to enable the merchants to dispose of their goods then lying in the Customs Houses and on the way to Persia. The request was refused and consequently for some time goods were not cleared from the Customs Houses and there was much talk of a general agitation against the Government. At Shiraz the excitement seems to have been greater than elsewhere in the south. At the close of the year the agitation seemed to be generally dying out though goods belonging to up-country merchants still remained uncleared in the Bushire Customs House. The importance of Lingah as the port of transhipment for the Arab Coast ports has declined, and steamers of the Bombay and Persia Steam Navigation Company now make regular callings at Debaye which has now become the distributing centre for the Arab Coast. 6. Settlement of Claims. —Notwithstanding the efforts made by His Majesty's Legation and this Residency, the settlement of our claims against the Persian Government and Persian subjects has made no progress. The Special Commissioner alluded to in last year's report left for Tehran, having effected nothing. A new Karguzar has recently arrived with special orders to take these cases up. 7- Coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII. —The Coronation of His Majesty King Edward VII was celebrated on the 1st January 1903 at all the places in the Gulf within the jurisdiction of this Residency. Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., was Political Agent at Maskat throughout the year. 'With the exception of occasional inter-tribal quarrels, the Sultan's terri tories continued to enjoy peace and tranquillity. In December His Highness the Sultan sent his eldest son Saiyid Taimur to represent him at the Delhi Coronation Darbar. The Political Agent's report of the principal events in Maskat during the year forms Part II of this compilation.residency and maskat political agency foe the year 1902-1903. 3 The pearling season was a good one and high prices generally ruled. The p^aT^coasr peace at sea has been maintained and no case of piracy or disturbances at sea occurred. A disturbing element however in the politics of the Oman Coast has lately arisen owing to the renunciation by the petty Sheikh of Eujeyrah on the Batineh Coast of his allegiance to the Joasmi ruler of Shargah. All efforts to bring about a satisfactory arrangement between the Pujeyrah Sheikh and the Chief of Shargah have failed, and it is owing to this matter that the Chief of Shargah has fallen out with his neighbour, the Chief of Debaye, who is suspected by the Shargah Chief to be encouraging the Sheikh of Eujeyrah. Mr. J. C. Gaskin has been Assistant Political Agent throughout the year, I v.- Bahrein, which has been, so far as the internal affairs of the islands are concerned, exceptionally quiet and prosperous. The new house for the Assistant Political Agent was completed towards the end of September. Sheikh Kashid, the third son of the Chief of Bahrein, died of consumption on the 16th December. Two Frenchmen, Messieurs Dumas and Castelin, arrived in Bahrein in .February for the purpose of opening a business there. A German Assistant to Herr Wanckhaus also arrived in Bahrein during the year. One serious case of piracy occurred in August off the Coast of Katr on a Bahrein boat, property of the value of 5,400 dollars being carried off. The leader of the pirates was the notorious Ahmed bin Selman originally from Bahrein and an outlaw from that place. Ahmed bin Selman returned with the booty to Turkish territory where he now is. Eepresentations were at once made to the Turkish authorities at Basrah through His Britannic Majesty's Consul, but so far the pirate has not been captured. The only news of importance from El Katr is, that in October last, the Mutassarif of El Hassa wrote to Sheikh Jassim bin Thani, the Chief of Katr, expressing a wish to make his acquaintance and desired him to go to El Hassa or else to send his brother, Sheikh Ahmed. Both declined the invitation. This part of Arabia under Turkish rule has been, as usual, in a marked v.-ei Hassa state of disorder. The caravan route between Ojair and El Hassa was unsafe atl ' for the greater part of the year and three large caravans were attacked and plundered by the Arabs. One of these caravans which left El-Hassa for Ojair on the 29th April was escorted by 120 cavalry, 80 mounted irregulars and 30 infantry and was attacked by a part of the A1 Murra, A1 Safran and Beni Hajir Arabs. It is said that nearly all the escort was killed and the few who escaped were held as hostages for the safety of the Arab tribesmen who were in Turkish custody at El Hassa. The new Mutassarif of El Hassa, Saiyid Taleb, son of the Nakib of Basrah, who took up his appointment in July, is said to have restored a certain amount of order in the districts, and it is understood that a series of posts are to be established between Ojair and El Hassa, each to be garrisoned by Turkish cavalry and infantry. Constant and conflicting reports have been received during the year regard- vi .-Koweit ing the progress of the fighting between the Amir of Nejd and the partisans of the Wahabi dynasty. In last year's report the capture of Eiadh by the latter was mentioned, and there appears to be no doubt that all the efforts of the Amir of Nejd to turn the Wahabis out of Riadh have so far failed. Abdul Rahman bin Eeysal has, it appears, gained influence and supporters throughout the country-side and it is generally thought that the power of the Amir of Nejd is on the decline. In the early part of 1903, the Amir was reported to be within a few marches of Koweit where he was joined by Yusuf bin Ibrahim of Dora, the well known enemy of Sheikh Mubarek of Koweit and the espouser of the cause of Mubarek's nephews. Koweit itself was never actually threatened, though Mubarek complained of raids committed on his tribesmen. Towards the close of the year the Amir drew off towards El Kaseem. He has been followed by Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman bin Eeysal, and it was generally expected that a decisive battle would have been fought ere this. No reliable news however of any encounter has as yet been received. His Royal Highness the Salar-ed-Dowleh was Governor-General of Arabis- vii . T Per8ian tan throughout the year, with Azem-es-Sultaneh as Lieutenant-Governor. The Arabistan, province has generally been in a disturbed state. On the night or the 5th September a party of Arabs belonging to the Binat section oi the Khasra] tribe b a4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL attacked the S. S. ' Shushan ' at Shelailieh near Shushter, killing a hoy, wound ing one of the crew and carrying off some goods. In October a party of Arabs looted a barge of the Moin-ut-Tujar at Uriss and afterwards attacked a caravan. On the 3rd February the Ferahan Eegiment, some 800 strong, while on the march from Khoremabad to Dizful, was attacked in the hills by a section of the Pishkuh Lurs. After some resistance in which the regulars are said to have lost 80 men, the remainder surrendered. The Lurs took their rifles and ammunition and other stores, and also looted the caravan, which was marching with the troops, of goods said to be of the value of 40,000 Tomans (equal to about Bl,15,000). The Bakhtiaris were ordered to levy a force to chastise the Lurs and it is believed that the punishment has been carried out though no reliable report has been received. His Excellency the Muez-es-Sultaneh, Chief of Mohammerah, was, in August, given the exalted rank and title of Sardar Arfa and a jewelled sword. His son Sheikh Chaseb was also decorated and given the title of Nasret-el-Mulk. The Beni Truf tribe have given trouble during the year and the Sardar Arfa had prepared an expedition to deal with them. They however came in and submitted before operations against them were undertaken. In November the Turkish Government reduced the export duty on horses at Basrah. Consequently fewer horses were taken to Mohammerah for shipment. Persian^cfoastCO His Excellency the Assaf-ed-Dowleh was Governor-General ersian coas . ^ p ars during the year. A new Governor-General was, however, appointed on the 21st March, or Persian New Year's day, and the Assaf-ed-Dowleh left for Tehran, the Ala-ed-Dowleh being then on his way to succeed him. The Assaf-ed- Dowleh though generally liked by the people of Shiraz, was not a strong ruler, and was quite unable to maintain order amongst the turbulent tribesmen of the districts. The roads were generally unsafe, highway robberies were frequent and the Persian Post between Shiraz and Bushire was stopped and robbed on three occasions. The Legation Courier on his way from Tehran to Shiraz was stopped by Kashkais in the Tangi Bulaki in the neighbourhood of Sivand and stripped of every thing. The robbers, however, restored to him the letters which he brought in to Shiraz. During April and May the city of Shiraz was in a state of considerable excitement owing to the scarcity of bread. The bakers closed their shops and there was every fear of disturbances. The timely arrival of the Assaf-ed-Dowleh on the 23rd May somewhat allayed the anxiety of the people and arrangements were made for the bakers' shops to be opened and for bread to be sold at lower prices. Later on, the harvest being a satisfactory one and new grain being brought into the place, prices fell considerably and all anxiety was removed. The Kowam-el-Mulk, who, as reported in last year's report, had been obliged to leave Shiraz, was allowed, as a special concession consequent on the death of his wife which occurred in Shiraz on the 6th July, to return to his home for a short period. He arrived in Shiraz on 2nd August and left again for Kerbella, where he h^d been ordered to take up his abode, on the 20th Septem ber, He was later on in the year pardoned by the Shah and received His Majesty's permission to return to Shiraz. The new Residency building at Shiraz was completed during the summer. I visited Shiraz in May and remained there during the summer, returning to Bushire in the end of October. There was an exceptionally severe winter in Shiraz. (2) Zar.—The district of Lar has been in a disturbed state. About the middle of January reports reached Lingah that Haji Ali Kuli Khan, Deputy Governor of Lar, being on bad terms with Baker Khan, Deputy Governor of Ishkanan, invaded the latter province with a large force and sacked the village of Biram. Later on a reconcilition was effected. Baker Khan agreeing to pay the Government revenues for the Gilahdar, Ishkanan and Shib Koh districts. During Haji Ali Kuli Khan's absence, his two nephews created a disturbance and killed two Saiyids who were in charge of the Government affairs at Lar. They then, with their father, hearing of Haji Ali Kuli Khan's approach, took refuge in the fort at Art. The fort was invested and subsequently surrendered, Haji Ali Kuli Khan pardoning his rebellious brother who was, however, fined 16,000 Tomans, one of his nephews being kept as security for the payment.(&amp;&gt;) RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. (3) Lingah. —Agha Muhammad Amin who had been Eesidency Agent at Lingah for many years died on the 3rd August. His son, Agha JBedr, has now been entrusted with the work of the Agency. On the 22nd August it was reported that Saiyid Yusuf Mehrkani, a partisan of Sheikh Muhammad Joasmi who seized Lingah a few years ago but was soon expelled by the Persians, had arrived from the Arab Coast at Dooan on the Persian side. A few days later it was reported that he had seized and burned 40 packages of dates which belonged to the Persian Government and were being brought to Lingah from the interior. The Deputy Governor of Lingab took steps to defend the place and the latest news received about Saiyid Yusuf was that he had left Persia and crossed over to Katr. His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim arrived in Lingah on 17th Octo ber in the Fersepolis and landed with some troops from Bushire and a ship's gun. He is said to have recovered a fine of 6,000 dollars from Sheikh Yusuf bin Ahmed of the Bu Smeit tribe and his brother whom he had arrested on tbe charge of having favoured the cause of the rebel Saiyid Yusuf and to bave then released them, taking from them a paper in which they declared their allegi ance to the Persian Government. (4) Bunder Abbas. —Captain E. H. S. Boxer, Assistant Besident* and Vice-Consul, died suddenly at Bunder Abbas on the 4th June from hyperpy rexia consequent on an attack of bilious remittent fever. He was succeeded in August by Captain W. G. Grey. Owing to the scarcity which prevailed during the year the districts round Bunder Abbas were in a very disturbed state. The routes to Kerman and Yezd were very unsafe and frequent robberies were committed by the Baharloo and Bashkirdi tribes. The Persian Post from Kerman was robbed on three occasions and the village of Sultanabad between Bunder Abbas and Kerman was sacked towards the end of April by Baharloo raiders who are said to have killed some 15 of the inhabitants. In May and June Minab was raided by Bashkirdis and frequent reports were received of robberies and disturbances. Severe shocks of earthquake were felt at Bunder Abbas and Kishm on the 9th June and continued for some days. Many of the houses suffered and two lives were lost at Bunder Abbas. The damage at Kishm was, it is believed, more serious than at Bunder Abbas. Mr. H. 'W hitby Smith was in Political charge of the Mekran Coast during Persiaa the year. a The districts of Bahu and Dasbtyari were at the close of the year 1901-1902 in a disturbed state owing to the misdeeds of Mir Mahmud Kban. At the instigation of Saijid Khan of Gaih this same Mahmud Kban was appointed by Sardar Hashim Kban, Governor of Bampur, to be Chief of Pashtyari, Mir Abdi being driven out of the place. Kepresentations were made by His Majesty's Legation to the Persian Government regarding the state of affairs prevailing in those districts and the arrest and punishment of Mahmud Khan and Saiyid Khan were pressed for, but without success. In July, how ever, tbe new Governor of Bampur, Murteza Kuli Khan, who succeeded Hasbim Khan, arrested Saiyid Khan who was released in November after a large sum of money had been taken from him. No steps have been taken for the arrest of the principal offender Mahmud Khan who still remains at large and con tinues to do mischief. Owing to the long continued drought, much distress bas prevailed during the year in all the districts between Gwettur and Jask. Sixteen slaves were manumitted during the year: of these three took refuge x.—Slave Trade, in Bushire, three in Lingah, and ten in Bahrein. On the 8tb April a Bahrein boat bound from Bahrein to Basrah in X1, piracies ' ballast was attacked near the second buoy on the Shatt-el-Arab bar by a party of 16 Arabs who carried off Bs. 400 in cash and other property. The matter was represented to the Turkish authorities who arrested a few suspected persons whom, however, the Nakhoda of the boat could not identify. On 27th May, a Koweit boat was attacked off Bubyan island near the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab by pirates who are believed to be in the employ of Yusuf bin Ibrahim of Dora. Much property in cash and kind was carried off and one of the crew was killed. The next day another Koweit boat was attacked in the Hindyan creek and 4,000 Krans in cash besides other property were6 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL carried off. Representations made to the Persian and Turkish, authorities produced no result, but Sheikh Mubarek visited the Chief of Mohammerah in connection with these piracies, and it is not known what arrangement was come to between the two Chiefs. Early in September an expedition was organized at Dora by Yusuf bin Ibrahim, with the object of either attacking Koweit and getting rid of Sheikh Mubarek or else of committing piracies on Koweit boats. The Commander of H.M.S. Lapwing having received news of the expedition made a search for the dhows. On 6th September two dhows containing some 150 armed men were discovered in the Khor Abdulla and were ascertained to be the suspected dhows. Lieutenant and Commander Armstrong gave chase in four of the ships' boats. The Arabs finding that they could not escape, ran their dhows ashore on the Persian side of the entrance to the Shatt-el-Arab. The Lapwing's boats which were in hot pursuit came up and a fight ensued between the boats and the Arabs who had got ashore. After a sharp fight, in which one blue jacket was killed and two wounded, the Arabs fled, losing, it is believed, some six men killed and several wounded. The dhows were captured and later on destroyed. The gallant action of Commander Armstrong and his men in pursuing and capturing these dhows, is deserving of the highest praise. Several of the men belonging to the dhows were subsequently arrested while trying to cross the river to the Turkish side and were detained in custody by the Chief of Mohammerah. In consequence of the representations made to the Turkish authorities, Yusuf bin Ibrahim has been ordered to leave Dora and it is understood that he has left the place. On the night of the 26th November a Maskat buggalow owned by two British Indian subjects was pirated in the river while she was lying off Maamer on the Turkish side. One of the crew was killed and the Nakhoda wounded, 400 dollars in cash and other property being carried off. In February another Koweit boat was attacked in the Khor Musa. A passenger and the Nakhoda and four of the crew were killed and a large amount of cash and property was carried off. The Turkish and Persian authorities are being pressed to take action against the pirates who have of recent years done so much mischief in the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab. Sheikh Mubarek invariably charges Yusuf bin Ibrahim with responsibility for the piracies, but with the exception of the Lapwing incident no definite proof against the man has been adduced. xn.-Navy.

Saeb. Awabi. 1. The internal politics of Oman during the past year have displayed little or no divergence from the prevailing type. In the spring, and again in the autumn, the usual rumours were rife regarding a supposed intention on the part of the tribes of the Sharkiyeh to raid the small coast-ports near Maskat, hut no developments ensued and it is doubtful if the rumours had any serious foundation. At the same two seasons there were signs of unrest among the tribes of the Upper Semail Valley, the outcome, in a great measure, of the drought which has been prevalent for the last three seasons and has reduced some of the tribes to sore straits. 2. Beyond the foregoing little has transpired calling for special remark except that, on two occasions, when incidents have occurred calculated to lead to further trouble if not specially dealt with. His Highness the Sultan has found it advisable to proceed in person to the scene. The small coast town of Seeb, 30 miles from the capital, where many of the well-to-do inhabitants of Maskat own date-groves, to which they migrate in the hot weather, afforded the first occasion calling for his presence. The town is inhabited by a motley assortment of Arabs and Baluchis, but the tribes most strongly represented are the Beni Hina, Beni Hadid and Beni Awamir, who, in a desultory way, are perennially at feud with one another. In recent years these three communities, partly for self-protection and partly with a view to being in a better position to annoy their neighbours when any quarrel is in progress, have, as opportunity offered, quietly built themselves fortified towers in their respective parishes, if I may use such a term, and when any incident occurs affording sufficient pretext for a rupture of the peace they are in the habit of taking cover in their towers and exchanging random shots with their adversaries or picking off individuals among them who expose themselves unwarily. As their tribal settlements are a considerable distance apart promis cuous long range practice of this kind naturally disturbs the general tranquillity of the place and endangers the lives of unoffending inhabitants and on this account the tribal Sheikhs have been repeatedly ordered by the Sultan, through his local Wali, to vacate or dismantle their fortifications. The Sheikhs, howeverj were contumacious, owing to the orders not being backed by any show of force, and continued from time to time to break the peace and paralyse the trade of the port. Accordingly His Highness the Sultan taking advantage of an occasion when hostilities of the nature described were in progress, owing to the murder of an Awamir man by a negro belonging to the Beni Hadad, set out for Seeb in the month of April for the purpose of demolishing the objectionable towers. Accompanied by a small force taken from the Maskat garrison, he carried out his plan without any opposition to speak of and returned to Maskat on 14th idem after 10 days'absence. The murderer was captured and put to death and a heavy fine imposed upon the Sheikh primarily responsible for the outbreak of hostilities. 3. The Sultan had hardly settled down when he was called away a second time. In this case Awabi was his objective, an inland town about 70 miles away to the south-west, near Eostak, one of the ancient capitals of Oman. Here much bad blood appears to have arisen between the Wahabi garrison of His Highness's fort and the male population owing, it is believed, to the intrigues of some of the former with women of the village; and eventually local feeling ran so high that some specific disagreement over the hire of a donkey having given the villagers a pretext for open hostility the garrison were set upon in the bazaar and two of their number killed on the spot. Leaving Maskat on 24ith April immediately on receipt of his representative's report, and arriving at Awabi three days later, the Sultan proceeded to incarcerate three of the principal greybeards of the town pending production by them of the actual culprits. After some procrastination one man was produced, and together withRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. ll the chief Sheikh, was brought back to Maskat. The murderer was subse quently executed, on 6th May, but apparently on further inquiry the Sheikh was found not to be implicated personally and was released. A punitive fine was however levied in cash. 4. Later in the year an unfortunate incident was reported from Nezwa. Nezwa. Saiyid Seif bin Hamed the Wali of this important town, who is by birth an Al -Bu-Saeedi (i.e., of the same stock as the ruling house) and having risen to his present position under tragic circumstances, now leads an insecure existence within the confines of the Nezwa fort, had reason to suspect a plot against his life among a party of Jennebeh tribesmen visiting the town and ordered his Negro guard to effect their arrest. The guard proceeded to do so, but the Jennebeh shewing fight the Askaris used their rifles and killed four of them. A good deal of consternation was caused by this regrettable occurrence when the report, which lost nothing in the telling, reached Maskat, and it was feared that it might result in a general rising of the Jennebeh and an attack in force upon the Nezwa fort. Indeed, if matters had so turned out, there would have been small cause for wonder, but the Sultan lost no time in dispatching a deputation to the vicinity to pacify the Jennebeh, and fortunately with a successful result, no further bloodshed ensuing. This took place in October. Later on as soon as matters had subsided sufficiently to enable him to travel with any degree of safety, the Wali journeyed into Maskat to present his report personally to the Sultan, and has since returned to Nezwa. 5 The affairs of this appanage of the Oman Sultanate have been a good deal Gwadur. in evidence during the past year owing chiefly to the results of a change of Walis. There were, no doubt, at the time of his transfer, a number of petty complaints against the late incumbent, and, as he had been there many years, the Sultan thought it expedient to give him a transfer. His successor has how ever shewn himself unfitted for such a responsible post and it is confidently hoped that now the Sultan realises that Gwadur affairs are not working as smoothly as thev ouffht, he will definitely decide to try a new man or reinstate his former representative, Saif bin Saeed, whose return seems to be generally desired by the public at Gwadur. , . . It must not be overlooked that His Highness is in a difficult position m suoh matters owing to the extreme paucity among his Arab subjects of officials upon whom sufficient reliance can be placed when they are deputed to positions of authoritv awav from head-quarters. For this reason he naturally hesitates to make changes in appointments until thoroughly convinced that no other remedy is left open to him. 6. The Political Ageat was absent from Maskat during the year under Pomacal^^ report on four occasions, as follows: U) On the 6th April 1902, he proceeded to Bushire on H.M.S. Redbreast to confer with the Resident on various matters, and from thence, under instructions from the latter returned to Euieyrah, on the Oman coast, north of the Batineh, to endeavour Pujeyrah. to bring Sheikh Hamid bin Abdullah, Chief of the Sharkiyyeen, to reason in regard to the actively hostile attitude which he has latterly assumed towards the Joasmi. _ The stubborn old veteran, however, refused to be convinced. His case is still engaging the attention of the Resident in the Persian Gulf, in connection with the Pirate coast questions, but it nevertheless clai^ passing mention in a chronicle of Maskat affairs, in that tsheikh Hamid, at an earlier stage of the case, applied to the Sultan for assistance against his alleged oppressors, the Joasmi. _ On the advice of the Resident, however, His Highness has wisely abstained from espousing his cause or otherwise participating m the quarrel. 7 En route to Puieyrah H. M. S. Redbreast touched at the islets of Parur Nabi-ul-Parur, Sirri, Abu Musa, Nabi-ul-Tanb and Tanb and it was noticed that the Persian flag was still flying over the mam Arab village on the p eraianFlag &lt; island of Sirri, as it was in lb87-1888, ^ S 81111 for that year. The fact was duly reported to the Resident m the Pcisian it.12 ADMINISTRATION HEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GtJLI 1 POLITICAL Ab UrD Th h'T 8 ' After leaTiri § ^ujeyrah the Redbreast cruised round to Abu Thabi on Maskat ^ he VimtQ coast where the Political Agent was landed on 30th April and journeyed to Maskat by land, a distance a little over 400 miles. The utmost assistance and hospitality was afforded to him by Sheikh Zaeed- bin-Khalifa, Chief of Abu Thabi, without whose cordial co-operation the first portion of the journey could not have been performed; and on disembarking the Political Agent, H. M. S. Redbreast returned to Maskat with a despatch requesting the Sultan to be so good as to send his trusted Lieutenant Sheikh Eashidbin-Uzaiz, Governor of Semail, or some other influential Sheikh, to meet the Political Agent at Ibri in the Dahireh. His Highness cordially and promptly responded and Sheikh Eashid duly kept tryst at Ibri on 14th May. Some portion of the country passed through in the Dahireh district had not been visited before by a European, so far as is known, and of the remainder of the route much had not been traversed for many years. t The principal places visited were Abu Thabi, Bereymee, Hafit, Dthank, Ibri, JSTejd-ul-Makharim Gabrin, Bahla, Nezwa, Tanoof, the villages of the Jebel Akhdar range, Semail, Saroor, Bidbid, Pinjah and so on to Maskat which was reached on 29th May. No serious opposition was offered to the Political Agent's progress and when the difficulties and occasional risks of first contact had been got over, and his identity and credentials made known, the villagers and Bedouins met with were uniformly friendly. The chief impediment to the security of travel in Oman, as in other parts of Arabia, is the suspicious nature of the bucolic Arab, who is ever ready to believe any exaggerated or lying story that may happen to get abroad regarding the identity and motives of the stranger sojourning in his country. The peasants were found to be much better armed in this, the Northern half of Oman, than they are in the South; in fact obsolete rifles were altogether at a discount. 9. (5) On 8th^ June His Majesty's 1st class Cruiser Amphitrite, 11,000 tons, Captain O. Windham C.V.O., arrived at Maskat fromEngland and, in the absence of the Eesident at Shiraz, the Political Agent accompanied her on her cruise in these waters, returning to Maskat on 25th June. (&lt;?) On 11th July he proceeded to Simla on duty and returned on 13th August. (c£) On 13th December he left for India to attend the Coronation Durbar at Delhi with the deputation of His Highness the Sultan. 10. The latter was cordially invited by the Government of India to attend this great pageant himself as the guest of Government, or to send a deputation in the event of his own inability to avail himself of the invitation. Unfor tunately His Highness did not feel able to absent himself from Maskat for the period which his presence at Delhi in person would have necessitated, and there fore sent his eldest son Saiyid Taimoor to represent him, attended by Saiyid Yusuf Zowawi, a close friend and adviser of the Sultan, and Saiyid Muhammad bin Ahmed bin Nasir, Governor of Muttra. The Political Agent accompanied the deputation as Political officer. On arrival at Karachi Saiyid Taimoor was received with his father's salute of 21 guns and was escorted on shore by the Port Officer. He was accorded similar honors on arrival at and departure from Delhi, and was in all matters treated as representing His Highness the Sultan. In spite of the severe cold the party kept good health and were able to attend all the preordained functions and to enter heartily into other pleasures during the progress of the festivities, which they thoroughly appreciated and enjoyed. During the fortnight Saiyid Taimoor and his companions had an interview with His Excellency the Viceroy, taking with them a set of handsome gold chased articles of local pattern and workmanship which the Sultan had had made for His Majesty the King and which His Excellency the Viceroy had kindly undertaken to have forwarded to their destination. During the interview Saiyid Taimoor delivered messages of congratulation and friendship from his father, and His Excellency expressed his pleasure at being able to honour the occasion by the presentation to His Highness the Sultan of 2 guns as an arma ment for the steamer which he has lately purchased, through the good offices of the Government of India, for his own use. Delhi Coronation Durbar.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. 13 Before the Durbar broke up the Government of India were pleased to de corate Saiyid Taimoor with the Gold Delhi Durbar Commemoration Medal. After leaving Delhi on 12th January Saiyid Taimoor and party proceeded direct to Bombay, where a fortnight was spent while communications passed with His Highness the Sultan regarding a proposed tour to Agra, Aligarh and Calcutta. In the meanwhile, at his father's wish, Saiyid Taimoor visited his great uncle, Saiyid Abdul Aziz, at Poona, and Saiyid Abdul Aziz subsequently journeyed to Bombay for a few hours to return his nephew's visit. On 26th January the party left for Agra where three days were spent seeing the sights of the neighbourhood. Erom Agra a short excursion was made to Aligarh, Saiyid Taimoor having been invited by the Principal and Council to pay a visit to the Saiyid Ahmed M. A. 0. College. A long morning was spent there and the party were received with much kindness and distinction by the College authorities, and appeared to be greatly interested and impressed by what they saw; in the afternoon a start was made for Calcutta, where another week was spent and various places of interest visited, by the end of which it was time to think of returning to Maskat, which was reached safely on 18th February. It is certain that the whole party thoroughly enjoyed their tour, especially Saiyid Taimoor, who displayed much intelligence and good sense under the novel surroundings, and there can be no doubt that besides the pleasure which he derived from what he saw both at Delhi and afterwards his experiences have opened his mind considerably and will leave upon him a lasting impression for good. On his safe return His Highness the Sultan fired a salute of 21 guns as a mark of his acknowledgments to Government for their entertainment of his deputation and this was followed by a salute of 13 guns in honour of Saiyid Taimoor. At Maskat Durbar Day was appropriately celebrated. A salute of 101 guns was fired and the Union Jack flown from the Sultan's saluting battery from sunrise to sunset and His Highness with his usual suite called officially at the British Consulate to offer his congratulations, as did the representatives of Foreign Powers. The members of the British Indian Communities closed and illuminated their shops in honour of the occasion and deputations of the several persuasions called at the Consulate to express their congratulations and loyalty to the crown. A telegram was at the same time sent by them to the Govern ment of India for favour of transmission to His Majesty the King conveying similar expressions of congratulation and loyalty. 11. Customs—His Highness still continues to administer his own Customs General, and has during the year under report resumed the direct administration of the Gwadur Customs also. The revenue of the Oman Customs has this year touched the highest figure that has yet been reached, there being an increase of one million dollars in the value of the trade as compared with last year. The items which have mainly contributed to this substantial improvement will be seen from the trade statistics. It is worthy of remark here, however, that the large increase in the date export was mainly due to the Turkish Arabian crop having been a poor one, resulting in the transfer of part of the Gulf demand to Maskat. It is satisfactory to be able to report that the work inaugurated last year in connection with the improvement of the Custom House premises has been continued by the local Government. The wharf, which was quite inadequate for the accommodation required, has now been enlarged by taking in more of the foreshore and roofed sheds have moreover been erected on it for the better protection of merchandise from the elements. At the same time suitable offices, and warehouses for the storage of goods are in the course of erection^ and when finished will much improve the appearance and utility of the premises ^ (which have for years lain in a most dilapidated condition), to a very considerable degree. Owing to the difficulty of obtaining suitable^ building material locally and also no doubt in order to carry on the work with as little financial strain upon himself as possible, progress cannot be as^ rapid as the Sultan would wish, but he is to be congratulated on the inception of a work of real public utility.

ADMINISTitATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GITLE POLITIQAL as mentioned earlier in this report, has been acquired by him primarily for use in facilitating the Customs Administration of his smaller Oman ports and will, it is hoped, serve its purpose and indirectly recoup its owner for its cost and upkeep. It is at present undergoing alterations in the Government Dockyard at Bombay, but is shortly expected at Maskat. Apart, however, from questions of revenue, the power which the possession of the vessel will pat in the Sultan's hands, and which he does not now possess, of appearing at short notice, and with force at his back, at any given point on the coast line and consequently in the hinterland of his territory, should prove of very material assistance to him in keeping, a tight hand upon his more distant possessions. 12. There has been a further decline in this trade, the value of which is about 1,70,000 dollars less than that of last year and 50 per cent, less than it was in 1897-1898. The foundering of Messrs. Bucknall's ' Cam ' en route to Maskat contri buted to some extent to this result but a similar catastrophe occurred last year in the case of the ' Basuto' so it must be presumed that the decline in the imports represents a falling off in the demand. It may also be in a measure due to the fact that British merchants have for one reason or another been less energetic in this branch of trade; and it was noticed too that probably by reason of the scarcity of money in Persia owing to drought, fewer persons than usual hailing from Persian territory appeared at Maskat. In this connection it is to be noted that while the value of arms imported from the United Kingdom has decreased 40 per cent., that from Marseilles or other foreign ports has increased 30 per cent., which means that the trade is quickly passing into the hands of persons over whose operations we can exercise no check or supervision. The reception of the arms on arrival accentuates this aspect of the question, as the following figures will show. Of the total number of cases of arms and ammunition landed at Maskat during the course of the year 22 per cent, were taken delivery of by British subjects, 10J per cent, by Arab subjects and 67J per cent, by foreign subjects. Other details of the trade are furnished in the separate Trade Report. 13. Maskat has been quite free from epidemic disease of any sort and this must be regarded as a matter for much congratulation, considering its proximity to Karachi and Bombay by sea. The duties of Health Officer continue to be per formed for the Sultan by the Agency Surgeon, and without the slightest friction. 14. Owing to His Majesty's Ships being employed elsewhere there was no slave cruising during the recognised slave running seasons, and no dhows were captured in these waters, but if any contirmation were wanted to the reports of this Agency as to the lively survival of the traffic it is furnished by the following items of information which came to hand during the current year. {a) In January 1902 the Portuguese authorities at Mozambique having been informed that several Arab dhows had entered the small rivers in the Angoche district for the purpose of capturing slaves, the Governor-General of Mozambique organised an expedition composed of 180 men, detached from Portuguese men-of-war in those seas and proceeded to a spot where the slave dealers were reported to have constructed a fortified position for themselves. After a severe conflict two dhows were captured and two burnt and a number of the Arabs are believed to have been killed. It is not at present known how many slaves were released. {b) Again in March 1902 further information of a similar nature having reached the local authorities the Portuguese cruiser San Rafael entered the Port of Simoco in the same neighbourhood and there, after a sharp fight, captured a slaving fleet of 12 Arab dhows, liberating 725 slaves and making prisoners of about 150 of the Arab slave runners. The Arabs are still in confinement awaiting trial; but meanwhile it is known from the statements of individuals who were present and escaped capture and have since returned to Sur that most if not all the Arabs were Oman subjects and hailed from Sur and the vicinity. The foregoing incidents seem to constitute sufficiently incontrovertible proof that slave running flourishes in an organised form and on a large scaleRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1902-1903. 15 and tliat the port of Sur continues to be, as it has been for many generations, the distributing centre for these waters. Of individual fugitive slaves 66 have taken refuge at this Consulate during the year, out of which number 64 have been given manumission papers with the concurrence of the Local Government. 15. Keferring to the observations made in paragraph 5 of last year's Report French Flag, on this subject, to which reference is invited, I may mention that the practice initiated by the Trench Government of issuing Erench Flags to Arab inhabit ants of this notorious sla-ve emporium and the extent to which such issue prejudices the independence of the Maskat Sultanate, continues to he the subject of friendly discussion between the Governments of Great Britain and France, and it is the earnest hope of the Ruler of Maskat that the now ^ much delayed issue will ere long be decided in a manner compatible with his own dignity and sovereign rights. 16. The cable rates from Maskat to India and elsewhere were reduced Telegraph from 1st June 1902 in spite of which reduction the receipts at the Maskat cabie^ office have averaged over £1900 monthly. 17. It having been decided that under the conditions at present holding in Agency^ Maskat it was desirable for the Agency Surgeon to live near the Consulate and H OUse and not in Muttra, as had for many years been the custom, and fresh accommoda- Quarters, tion being also required for the Consular Staff and Officials of the Telegraph Department, the Government of India permitted the Political Agent to purchase the premises of Ruttonsie Purshotam, adjoining the British Consulate, and during the present year plans and estimates for the building of suitable residential quarters for the Agency Surgeon and Consular and Telegraph btaft on the site in question have been sanctioned and it is hoped that the next year will see them completed. 18. Maskat was visited during the year by His Majesty's ships Redbreast, Navy. Pomone, Sphinx, Amphitriie, Lapwing, Cossack, Assaye, Fox, Renown, and Feneus and by the Royal Indian Marine Steamers Investigator and Lawrence.

The total value of trade for the year according to the figures furnished by His Highness's Customs is returned at 5,711,950 dollars, as against 4,637,764 dollars of last year; shewing an increase of 1,074,186 dollars. This amount represents an increment of 208,747 dollars in the export side and 865,439 dollars on the imports. The items chiefly contributing to this result are:— Import. Coffee» —The increase in coffee imported represents a greater capacity for the Bedouin to buy with the proceeds of his dates, the export of which' was above the normal owing to a poor season further north. Sugar. —It will be noted that the importation of sugar is nearly double the normal figure. The explanation is that large quantities of Austrian sugar were imported via Bombay with a view to re-export to India through the Native State Ports the enhanced duty being thereby evaded. The Customs authorities concerned were however, by arrangement, apprized of the destination of all craft clearing with such sugar for Indian ports, and duty was presumably levied in due course. Specie, —For the last two years there has been a large increase both in the import and export of specie. The reason for this is that the rupee value of the dollar in Masqat does not, from local causes, always correspond with the current Bombay rate, and is constantly fluctuating. When therefore Maskat mer chants can buy dollars cheaper in Maskat than in Bombay they export largely to Bombay, keep in bond and re-export at Bombay rates to foreign ports where there is a demand for them. In the same way when they are dear in Maskat they import from Bombay. This exchange speculation is facilitated by the cable communication which now exists. Two years ago there was a disposition to smuggle dollars into India via Kattiawar ports with the same motive, but the attention of Government was drawn to this traffic and it is believed to have since ceased. During the year the dollar exchange has fluctuated between E139 and El 12 per hundred dollars although the actual silver value of 100 dollars is E125. Exports. Bates, —There was a considerable increase in the export to India due, it is believed, to the dearth of the article in Persia and Turkish Arabia. Limes. —There was a large export to Persia owing to the abnormal scar^ city of the fruit in Persia itself, where it is understood to be extensively used for dyeing purposes. Other items seem to call for no special remark. P. Z. COX. Major, Eis Britannic Majesty's Consul and Folitiqal Agent, Maslcat.FOREIGN DEPARTMENT SELECTIONS.

P akt I.— geneeal summary. 1. 'Rainfall and Harvest•—Th.v rainfall though late has generally been i.—General, good throughout Southern Persia, and the prospects of the harvest are good. At the close of the year wheat was selling in Bushire af 1? krans and barley at 12 krans per hasmi maund of 124 lbs. In October 1903 the Persian Government imposed an embargo on the export of sheep and goats from the Persian Gulf ports, owing to the alleged scarcity of stock in the interior. Considerable inconvenience on this account is being felt at Bahrein and other places on the Arab Coast which are depen dent on Persia for their meat supply. 2. The Governorship of Bushire and Gulf Forts. —His Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim left Bushire in the end of March, having been recalled to Tehran. It is understood that the Derya Beggi is on his way from Tehran to Bushire to succeed him. The Poreign Office Agent, Mirza Ali Mahomed Khan, Mowaker-ed-Dowleh, is acting as Governor pending the arrival of the new Governor. Good order has been maintained in Bushire and the surrounding districts. The four guns of position mentioned in last year's report remain where they were. The Artillery Officer who came from Tehran for the purpose of preparing the forts where these guns are to be placed died in August. He has been succeeded by another man, but the forts have not yet been constructed. 3. Fuhlic Health* —There was an outbreak of plague at Bahrein during the year. The first cases occurred during the first week in May and the disease disappeared towards the end of June. It has been estimated that 600 cases with 301 deaths occurred, but the figures are not very reliable. It is said that there was a mild outbreak of plague in El Hassa early in April which died out towards the end of the month; and Katif is said to have been affected. The town of Minab, 60 miles distant from Bunder Abbas, has suffered from what was apparently a severe epidemic of cholera which however had died out in J anuary. The sanitary service in the Persian Gulf is in the hands of the Residency Surgeon, whose supervision and that of the officers subordinate to him has been very effective. The recent outbreak of cholera at Basra is a cause for some anxiety, but it is to be hoped that the measures taken will prevent the disease from appearing in any of the Gulf ports. B2 ADMINISTRATION EE POET ON THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL 4. Administration of Cvstoms in the Persian Gulf. —The year has been marked by the general extension of the authority of the Imperial Customs Administration throughout the Gulf, several of the minor ports, where the Customs were in the hands of the Local Chiefs, having been taken over by the Department. Some captures of arms have been made in the vicinity of Bunder Abbas and elsewhere. There is little doubt that the gradual extension of the Customs Administration under European management is making the smuggling of arms into Persia more difficult. The new Persian steamer the Mazafferi has done some useful work for the Customs Department during the year. It will be seen from the Trade Eeport that the new tariff has not as yet affected British trade adversely. Tea, on which the duty was greatly increased, shows a fair increase ; and indigo, on which the duty was also considerably enhanced, shows an improvement. The decrease in the import of Manchester piece-goods is probably due to an overstocked market. 5. Settlement of Claims new Karguzar referred to in last year's Report proved unsatisfactory and did nothing towards the settlement of out standing claims. Some of these, however, have been disposed of during the year by the efforts of His Majesty's Minister at Tehran. 6. The Viceroy's visit to the Persian Gulf —The most noteworthy event during the year was the visit to the Persian Gulf of His Excellency Lord Curzon, Viceroy and Governor-General of India. His Excellency the Viceroy in the R.I.M.S. Hardinge escorted by H.M.S. Hyacinth, flagship of Rear-Admiral Atkinson-Willes, and H.M.S.S. Fox, Powoweand Argonaut, arrived at Maskat on the 18th November. At Maskat a grand durbar was %eld on board the Argonaut at which His Highness the Sultan of Maskat was invested with the insignia of the Grand Cross of the Most Eminent Order of the Indian Empire. The next place visited was Shargah on the Arabian Coast of the Persian Gulf, where the Viceroy with the escorting squadron arrived on the 21st November. A durbar was held on board H.M.S. Argonaut and was attended by all the Trucial Chiefs who were awaiting His Excellency's arrival at Shargah on board the Indian Government Telegraph Ship FatricJs Stewart, which had been deputed to collect them. Bunder Abbas was reached on the morning of the 22Qd November, and here His Excellency was met officially by Sir Arthur Hardinge, British Minister at Tehran, who had come to meet the Viceroy and accompany him during his tour. His Excellency the Salar-i- Moazzim, Governor of Bushire and the Gulf Ports, was present here, having come in the Fersepolis to welcome the Viceroy on behalf of the Persian Government. After visiting the adjacent islands and the British station at Bassidore, the Viceroy proceeded to Lingah, which was reached on the 24th. Bis Excellency the Salar-i-Moazzim was here entertained to dinner on board the Hardinge. Leaving Lingah on the 25th, the Eardinge, escorted by the Pomone and the Sphinx, proceeded to Bahrein, which was reached on the 26th. Sheikh Isa, Chief of Bahrein, was received by His Excellency the Viceroy on board the Hardinge, and in the evening Lord Curzon paid an informal visit to Manameh, where ne was received by the Chief. Bahrein was left on the 27th and Koweit was reached on the 28th, where the rest of the escorting squadron had already arrived. Sheikh Mubarek, Chief of Koweit, accompanied by his eldest son Sheikh Jaber, paid a visit to the Viceroy on board the Hardinge, and on the following day Lord Curzon landed at a point three miles from Koweit, where he was met by the Chief, with a large following of mounted men. A carriage was in waiting for His Excellency who, accompanied by the Chief, was driven to the Chief's house in Koweit. The route throughout was lined by crowds of Arabs, and His Excellency's visit was marked by much enthusiasm. The Hardinge, with the squadron, arrived at Bushire on the 2nd December. Here, unfortunately, a hitch in the arrangements ordered by the Persian Government for the reception of the Viceroy prevented His ExcellencyV w RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YKAR 1903-1904. from landing. A deputation of tbe European and British Indian merchants of Bushire waited on His Excellency on board the Sardinge on the 3rd and presented His Excellency with an address; and on the morning of the 4th December, the Viceroy, having concluded his tour, proceeded on his return voyage to India. 7. Visit of the British Minister. —His Excellency Sir Arthur Hardinge, K.C.M.G., C.B., Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary at the Court of H. I. M. the Shah of Persia, arrived in Bushire by way of Ispahan and Shiraz on the 15th November, and proceeded onboard H. M. S. Sphinx to meet Lor4 Curzon and accompany him during his tour in the Gulf. The Sphinx proceeded to Maskat, where the Minister had an informal interview with the Viceroy. Having then proceeded to Bunder Abbas, the Minister met the Viceroy at this place and accompanied him on board the Sardinge throughout the tour. After the Viceroy's departure from Bushire, Sir Arthur Hardinge remained a few days in Bushire and then proceeded to Mohammerab, whence after a short visit to Ahwaz, His Excellency proceeded on his return journey to Tehran by way of Bagdad and Kermanshah. 8. Postal Service. —In April 1903, a re-organization of the mail service from India to the Gulf was effected. This has greatly benefited the residents at Bushire and Basra, who now get their mails from India by a fast steamer which calls only at Maskat, Bushire, Mohammerah and Basra. The minor ports in the Gulf are served by another and slower service. Koweit has now been made a port of fortnightly call by steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company. Major Cox was Political Agent at Maskat throughout the greater part of n.- Oman- theyear. He proceeded on privilege leave early in January. The Political as a - Agent's report of the principal events in Maskat during t^e year forms Part II of this compilation. The pearling season was a prosperous one. Although the take of pearls was not very large, prices ruled high. No cases of piracy or disturbances at sea occurred. The dispute between the Chief of Shargah and his feudatory at Pujeyrah has not been settled. The expedition led by the Chief against the Headman of Eujeyrah led to an arrangement being arrived at between the Chief and his feudatory. The terms of this arrangement have not, however, been fulfilled and the matter is still under discussion. Mr J. C. Gaskin has been Assistant Political Agent at Bahrein through- iv.-Bahrein. out the year, which has generally been a quiet and prosperous one, though some anxiety was felt when the outbreak of plague occurred in May, Although the pearl harvest was not a very prolific one, the pearls found were of superior quality and prices were about 20per cent, higher than last year. Off El Katr the pearl season is said to have been a particularly prosperous one. N q piracies occurred in Bahrein waters, though at one time the reported move, ments of the notorious Ahmed bin Silman gave rise to anxiety. Ihe two Erenchmen, Messrs. Dumas and Castelin, referred to in last year a report, left Bahrein in May, the former for Bagdad and the latter tor 1 ranee. The roads between Katif and El Hassa and Ojair and El Hassa are report- v. Rassa ed, as usual, to have been unsafe, and the Arab tabes have generally given a good deal of trouble to the Turkish authorities. It is said that an enumeration of the date trees in Katif, which was made during the year, shows an increase of 100,000 palms, which means an increase of revenue to the Turks of about 1,500 Liras, The accounts whicli are received of the progress of affairs in Nejd are never very reliable, but there appears to be no doubt that Abdul Eabman bin Feysul el Saood has strengthened his position very considerably during the year and that his position in Riadh and the surrounding country is now secure. Such fighting as has taken place between him and the Amir of Nejd has been in favour of the Wahahi Chief, who, from news which appears to be authentic, gained a very considerable victory in February last over Ibn Rashid s men at Sirr on the borders of the Kaseem country, 300 of the latter having been killed. Ibn Rashid's standard, which was taken on this occasion, was sent into Koweit. b a4 ADMINISTEATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Matters at Koweit have been generally quiet and the 'Wahabi success is likely to strengthen Sbeikh Mubarek's position. Irabistan. Sian . 1 -? 1 x 8 Highness the Salar-ed-Dowleh has been Governor-General of Arabistan throughout the year. The state of the province is said to have been worse than ever, and the Shushter and Dizful districts have been very unsafe. His Excellency the Sirdar Arfa, Governor of Mahommerah, has been for the last few months in camp on the Karun, where he is engaged in making an arrangement with the BeniTruf Arabs for the pavment of their outstandino- revenue. At one time it seemed likely that hostilities would be resorted to and some soldiers with guns have been sent from Bushire and Shushtej to join the Sirdar Arfa. Later accounts seem to point to the likelihood of the Beni Truf submitting and an amicable arrangement being arrived at. Mr. McDouall, H.B.M/s Vice-Consul, proceeded on leave in June and was succeeded by Major Burton, 17th Bengal Cavalry, who left again for India on Mr McDouall's return in Eebruary. Lieutenant Lorimer, I.A., was appointed His Majesty's Vice-Consul for Arabistan, and arrived at Ahwaz to take up his appointment in the end of January. The Russian Consul-General at Bushire visited the Sirdar Arfa in March and presented him with the Eussian Order of St. Stanislas. PeSWi F CoL a t nd The Asaf-ed-DowJeh left Shiraz on the 26th March 1903, bein^ succeeded by the Ala-ed-Dowleh, who arrived in Shiraz to take up his appoint ment as Governor-General on the 17th April 1903, accompanied by the Kawam-ul-Mulk. The new Governor-General soon showed his strength and the town and surrounding districts have not been so safe for many years It was entirely due to^he Ala-ed-Dowleh's firm attitude and judicious proceed ings that there was no outbreak in Shiraz during the summer of the Babi troubles, which took place in other towns of Persia. The new Governor-General also showed himself to be most energetic in the way of carrying out sanitary reforms in Shiraz, and generally repairing the palace and other Government buildings which were rapidly falling into ruins. The Ala-ed-Dowleh left Shiraz for Bushire, where he arrived on the 15th November, Laving been deputed by the Persian Government to meet His Excellency the Viceroy and Governor-General of India at Bushire. He return ed to Shiraz on the 23rd December and left for Tehran on the 21st February having been summoned to the capital to attend the meeting of Provincial Governors which had been convened for the purpose of considering certain finan cial reforms. It is not known yet whether he will return as Governor-General for the New Year. A deputation from the Aligarh College arrived in Shiraz early in Septem ber for the purpose of explaining to the Shirazis the advantages of the educa tional system at Aligarh. They returned to India in October with a few pupils who wished to join the college. ^ Mr. George Grahame, the newly appointed Consul for Shiraz, reached Shiraz in November. The Besident visited Shiraz in June, returning to Bushire at the end of September. (2) Lingah. Sheikh Mahomed bin Khalifah bin Saeed, the ex-Arab Chief of Lingah, arrived from the Arab Coast with 12 followers in the end of July, and went into the mountains near Lingah. He then wrote to the Deputy Governor, the Residency Agent and others, stating that he had no in tention of creating disturbances, but merely wished to lead a quiet life and he asked them to intercede with the Persian authorities on his behalf, so that he might be allowed to settle down in some place near Lingah. Later on he asked Syed Hashim, the leading Mulla, to obtain a safe conduct for him. This was done but the Sheikh refused to trust it without some further guaran- ^ 0r ^ 11S safety. Some sirbazes with the Mujir-es-Sultaneh, the brother of the Governor of Bushire, were sent to Lingah. Sheikh Mahomed left for Katr towards the end of November.BESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1903-1904. 5 (3) Bunder Ahhas. —Captain W. G.

Two piracies were reported to have occurred in the third week of August XL—Piracies, on the bar of the Shatt-el-Arab. One of the pirated boats belonged to Koweit, and representations were made on behalf of Sheikh Mubarek to the local authorities. In February a sailing vessel belonging to Karachi was attacked and scut tled 20 miles beyond the outer buoy on the Shatt-el-Arab, two of the crew being killed and 400 baskets of dates and the ship's gear taken. It is believed that the pirates had followed the ship down the river and attacked her when she had got outside and out of sight of land. The Government of India have offered a reward of Es. 1,000 for information which may lead to the discovery and conviction of the offenders. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy visited the Gulf during the XII ~' :Navy ' year :— H. M. S.S. Hyacinth (flagship), Argonaut, Fox, Fomone, Perseus, Sphinx and Lapwing.

P ART II.—ADMINISTRATION REPOET OF THE MASKAT POLITI- CAL AGENCY, 1903-1904 In the matter of internal politics the year under review would have furnished a generally satisfactory record had it not been for the sinister activity of the sons of the Sultan's old enemy, the late Saleh-bin-ali-al-Harthi, leader of the rebellion of 1895. Since their father's death in 1896, his three sons, Aysa, Ali, and Ahmed have seldom allowed many months to pass without seeking unpleasant notoriety of one kind or another, and making themselves a source of expense and anxiety to the Sultan. The two younger brothers are restless ne'er-do -W3lls of a troublesome type but possessed of littie personal reputation or influence except among such kindred spirits of their own and allied clans as are ready to respond to their call when any convenient opportunity arises for committing' depredations upon ill-protected or unsuspecting neighbours. The eldest of the three, Aysa, takes after his father, and is certainly a more dignified and serious character than his brothers. He has a considerable reputation for asceticism and piety of a somewhat bigotted type, and has no small confidence in his own astuteness as a politician, but though he affects to disapprove of the turbulent vagaries of his brothers and even writes apologe tically of them, he appears unable or disinclined to put any check upon them, even if he does not give them secret encouragement. As before stated the family seldom remains in the back ground for long together, but the last occasion, upon which they made themselves especially conspicuous, was in 1901, when the first expedition was undertaken on the Sultan's behalf to explore the reported coal bearing tract in Jaalan. It will be remembered that on that occasion, realising that organised obstruction to the geologist's movements afforded a convenient means of annoying and black mailing the Sultan, the brothers collected a considerable retinue and for some weeks altogether barred the progress of the exploring party, finally contriving a treacherous ambuscade which only good luck prevented from being fraught with serious consequences. During the present year it was in the month of August that the brothers first drew public attention to themselves. During that month His Highness the Sultan had proceeded to Soor to endeavour to settle certain dissensions between the two clans inhabiting that port which bade fair to develope into a sanguinary feud which might have continued indefinitely, but he had hardly taken the matter in hand when he was obliged to hurry northwards again in the ' Noor-ul-Bahr ' owing to the receipt of a disquieting report to the effect that the sons of Saleh-bin-Ali had suddenly migrated from the Sharkiyeh with a strong following, and were plotting to possess themselves of the strongholds of Hazm and Rostak. It was in the first place well understood that, were they to succeed in this enterprise, they would make the Ports a base of operations for organised annoyance to the Sultan, and it was further freely rumoured that Aysa aspired to set up a religious Imam in the person—if not of himself—of some puppet who would be in the leading strings of himself and his following. It may here be explained that the Ports of Hazm and Rostak with their environments have been held for some generations past by representatives of the ' Azzan ' and cc Kais,' collateral branches of the reigning family's clan, the Al-bu- Seyyid. Hazm being now held by Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim-bin-Kais, whose sister is one of Seyyid Paisal's wives, and Rostak by Hamood-bin- Azzan. The genealogies of both unite with that of the Sultan in the person of Ahmed-bin-Seyyid c&lt; A1 Imam.' Though outwardly on good terms with His Highness, and in receipt of honorific allowances from him, they are practi cally independent of his authority, and being members of rival branches of the family, it has never been safe for the present reigning family to place too much store on their loyalty. Aysa-bin-Saleh no doubt realised that the atmosphere of Hazm and Rostak was a congenial one for the development of his designs.RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904. 9 Although His Highness Seyyid Eaisal habitually subsidises the local tribesmen for holding the passes leading from the Sharkiyeh country into the hinterland of Maskat, nevertheless by the time a small force under Wali Suleiman-bin-Suweibin and Seyyid Taimoor had been landed at Seeb with orders to push on and hold the road leading from the Semail valley and Rostak, news was received that the intruders had been treacherously allowed by the o-uards to debouch unmolested through the main pass of Akk into the Wadi Semail, and before Wali Suleiman's party could reach Finjeh, where they hoped to intercept them, Aysa and his followers had passed onwards in front of them towards Rostak. On receiving this news His Highness at once left Haskat in the Noor-ul-Bahr for the port of Mesnaa, the nearest point on the coast to Rostak, and, having arrived there, forthwith put the loyalty of his brother-in-law to the test by sending a special messenger to him inviting him to a conference on the tc Noor-ul-Bahr, 3 ' As was expected, Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim excused himself on the plea of indisposition, and proceeded to join Aysa-bin- Saleh, who was by this time encamped outside the Port of Rostak. The Sultan's next move was to depute Wali Suleiman with 150 men to strengthen and hold the Eort of Awabi, from which point, in the event of hostilities breaking out, Aysa's line of retreat could be menaced. Seyyid Taimoor was simultaneously posted in the Fort of Mesnaa with an increased garrison, and, encamped outside, were a number of professedly friendly Sheikhs who, with numerous followings, had gathered round the Sultan, and were contentedly awaiting developments and being maintained at His High- ness's expense. During this time, His Majesty's ship Sphinx made frequent trips to various points on the Batineh coast, to enable the Political Agent, who was sometimes on board to remain in close touch with the Sultan, and, at the same time, to safeguard with her presence on the coast, the lives and property of British Indian subjects residing there. Though most of the latter sent their valuables into Maskat for safety, none of them were sufficiently alarmed to follow themselves, and, fortunately, matters never became serious enough to call for the issue of any general orders for their exodus. In fact, both Aysa-bin-Saleh and Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim addressed courteous letters to the Political Agent expressing friendly sentiments and their intention to use their best endeavours to see that no harm fell to British subjects or property. There was no change in the position of affairs for some time, during which the two confederates were engaged in negotiations with the object of obtaining peace able possession of Rostak fort from the party of Beni Ruwaheh tribesmen who garrisoned it. Ostensibly these men garrisoned the fort on behalf of Hamood- bin-Azzan, but whereas the latter had at once evacuated his quarters there and thrown in his lot with Aysa and Seyyid, the Beni Ruwaheh had other ideas, and for a long time refused altogether to admit the intruders. In the however, probably on the receipt of a sufficiently remunerative bribe they agreed to hand over possession of the fort to Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim. On gaming their object so far, both Aysa and Seyyid wrote letters to the Sultan m patron ising terms, informing him of their success as if it were a matter of which he would be very pleased to hear, and both went on naively to inform him by clear insinuation, if not in so many words, that Seyyid had beeii chosen ' Imam,' or as they put it, (t invested with the affairs of Muslimeen. It is easy to imagine that the ambitions of Aysa and Seyyid must have clashed somewhat at this juncture, but Aysa must soon have realized that he himself, whatever his religious qualifications might be, was not ot sumcienty aristocratic descent to gain the approval of the majority, and, that next o is own candidature the selection of a weak candidate like Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim, who would be a puppet in his hands, would be the best alternative Nevertheless, had Avsa himself been put forward, there can be no doubt that he would have received a good deal of active support from his own part of the coun ry, an i was well known, moreover, that, had any general call to arms resu e , ysa s reputation for devotion to the faith was such that several influential Sheikhs had openly given out about this time that though they would no snppor im against the Sultan, they would refuse to take up arms against hum From the moment however that it became apparent that Seyyid -bm-Ibrahim was the best candidate that could be got to come forward, it was a foregone conclusion10 ADMINISTE1TION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL that the movement would be abortive, for the latter has neither the moral nor religious reputation to win general support from the people of Oman, whose formally expressed approval is a sine qua non of the confirmation of any candi date as 'Imam.' While the above negotiations were in progress at Eostak, Aysa's two brothers busied themselves elsewhere, and with a small following of black legs made raids in several directions including the outskirts of Barka, where they attacked the summer quarters of the Sultan's stable manager, killed his son, wounded two of his women kind, and carried off two servants and some horses. Finding that the latter were the Sultan's property, Aysa had then sent back with a condescending letter from him to His Highness. The forts of Hazm and Eostak being now in the hands of his ally Seyyid, and the suggestion of the latter as Imam having met with little or no response, it was expected that Aysa and his attendant tribesmen would now return to their country, but this they showed no signs of doing probably owin^ to the fact that prolonged drought had made the conditions of life difficult in their own villages, and that in their present quarters they were living free, either at the expense of Seyyid-bin-Ibrahim or the people of Rostak. Nevertheless, by the first week in October the Sultan, who had for nearly two months been incurring very heavy expenses for the maintenance of a large force of friendlies on the Batineh coast and its outposts, now felt able to draw in his horns, and to limit his precautions to the retention of strengthened garrisons at the posts most liable to attack. His Highness himself now returned to Maskat leaving his two elder sons, Taimoor and Nadir, to represent him on the coast. Erom this time, although as long as Aysa and Seyyid remained together there could not be an entire absence of anxiety or sense of security, matters generally quieted down and trading operations which had for a long time past been paralysed were once more resumed. It was not till the month of Febru ary that Aysa-bin-Saleh returned to his country, but for the last four or five months previous he had ceased to be a source of anxiety. Apart from the above the only tribal incidents of sufficient interest to call for mention were in connection with Soor, which in some way or another seldom fails to figure in the Administration Reports of this Agency. Soor. —The annual hostilities which almost invariably break out in the slack season between the Ghafiri and Hinawi elements in Jaalan, were pursued with no less regularity than usual during the year under review, and during the course of them the truculent old Amir of the Beni Bu Ali had reason to believe that his Hinawi enemies were being supplied with the sinews of war by his own dependent tribesmen of Soor. He accordingly betook himself to the coast with a large following, and having encamped on the Aigeh side of the creek summoned the Sheikh of the port and gave notice that he intended to close the entrances to the port by land and sea until such time as the Sheikhs gave him an undertaking to restrain their followers from supplying provisions to his enemies in the interior, and also paid a fine for recent offences of this nature. He was as good as his word, and while he continued to press his terms upon the elders, the port was placed in a state of close blockade and trade was brought to a standstill. While the negotiations were proceeding one of the tribesmen expressed his intention of taking his dhow out of the creek under cover of the French fia^ and persevered in the attempt in spite of a warning from the Sheikh that he would not be permitted to pass. The result was that the vessel was fired at bv Sheikh Abdulla's men, and the flag itself was said to have been struck. The incident at once became the subject of a claim for compensation bv the French Government upon His Highness the Sultan, who is understood to have replied that much as he regretted the occurrence it was an accidental outcome of ordinary tribal feud such as is of every day occurrence in Oman and that he could not hold himself responsible to the French Government , . There for the moment the matter ended. Sheikh Abdullah soon returned to the interior, but the ill-feeling between him and the Soori sections of his tribe continued for some months, and eventually the town became divided againstRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904. 11 itself to such an extent that early in August, when the Political Agent paid 1 ne 0 f his periodical visits to the British Indian commnnity there, he found the two tribal factions inhabiting respectively the Aigeh and Mugreirnatein divi sions of the port separated by the Soor creek, on the point of opening fire 011 one another. Having succeeded in persuading the parties not to open hosti lities for 48 hours, Major Oox returned to Maskat to inform the Sultan, who at once proceeded there in the Noor-ul-JBahr and was in process of settling between the parties when he was recalled by the more important news of the incursion of Aysa-bin-Saleh. His visit, however, had the desired effect, hosti lities were staved off for the time, and a little later the parties were able to settle their differences through the medium of the Sheikhs of some neutral clans in the neighbourhood. The latter half of the year under review has been particularly free from tribal discord. mup vear 1903 will always be a memorable one m the annals ot BntisnThe visit of His relations with the Sultanate of Oman as carrying the distinction of the first State visit of a Viceroy to Maskat. KediestSn to When informed early in October of Lord Curzon's proposed tour in these Maskat. watprs His Highness Seyvid Faisal expressed with much cordiality the plea sure and honour it would afford him to welcome His Excellency to Maskat, and from that moment he set himself to prepare to receive him m a manner befitting such a great occasion. The approach to the harbour of Maskat from the open sea offers to the traveller a panorama which nature has endowed with an exceeding picturesque- ness of a rugged type all its own. Apart from this valuable asset the town lends itself with difficulty to any embellishment, but so far as its limited possibilities allowed, His Highness spared no effort to satisfy hunself that the town and approaches should at all events look their best and m this regard it was also gratifying to remark the readiness with which the Maskat public responded and did their best, each according to his lights, to put their houses in order. It was about 10 on the morning of the 18th November 1903 that the fine E I.M S. Eardinge bearing Their Excellencies, escorted by five men-of-war of the East India Squadron appeared in the offing and the vessels presented a truly imposing spectacle as they approached the mouth of the harbour from the north The Sultan's flag was saluted with 21 guns as the flotilla came abreast of the signalling tower and gun for gun was returned by the Maskat ^Ifsoon as the ships had taken up their billets a further salvo of 31 guns was fired as a welcome to His Excellency the Viceroy.

After steaming round the entire squadron and acknowledsina' the compliments of the crews of His Majesty's ships, His Highness drew up alongside the Harthnge, where he was received by the Foreign and Militarv SecretariM and members of the Viceroy's Staff, and was by them conducted into Has Excellency s presence on the quarter-deck of the Sardinge, which had been fitted up as a state reception room. Greetings were exchanged and a short conversation took place after which the members of the Sultan s suite were severally presented to His Excellency. Refreshments were then served and a few minutes later the Sultan took his departure under a salute of 21 guns. Between 12 and 1 o'clock the Consuls of France and America at Maskat proceeded on board to pay their respects and were accorded interviews by His Excellency, and the salutes of their rank on departure. vol A b0Ut 2 ^ J ic ® ro y» accompanied by His Excellency Bear Admi- pvp ^ 9 landed at the jetty which had been temporarily f r i 6 P ur P ose a t the customs wharf and were received there by the Resident in the Persian Gulf and the Political Agent.

It was then presented in a silver casket of local design and manufacture representing a led camel standing beneath the shade of a palmtree, the trunk of which tormed the receptacle for the yellum. Having accorded a pregnant and sym pathetic reply to this representation, Lord Curzon returned by sea to the ietty at the head of which he was received on arrival by the Sultan. A Guard-of- onour of British Marines with a band were in attendance at the customs w larf and from that point the street through which the party would pass was lined on both sides by the Sultan's Arab Askaris. His Highness thence con ducted the Viceroy and his suite to the Audience Chamber in the Palace and on arrival there led his guest to a seat on his right on a raised dais at the head pk- * rvffi 131, n 6 ^ 8 ^ rere P rovided fo1. His Excellency's suite and the Sultan's ^ c ® rs State along the two sides of the room while in the further end and body of the hall were accommodated 70 or 80 Sheikhs and representative men trom various parts of the interior who had been invited in for the occasion. A striking feature in the room were a number of loyal inscriptions in -cmgiisn capitals on coloured ground which freely adorned the walls. i, '^ s soon as ^ orma l meetings had been exchanged the Chief Darbaris were rought up and presented by the Political Agent after which an Arabic ad dress ot welcome was read on the Sultan's behalf by Sheikh Eashid-bin-Ozaiz and was cordially acknowledged by the Viceroy. Refreshments were then passed round and a few minutes later the Darbar broke up. His Excellency bemg escorted back to the Pier-head by the Sultan and from thence returning on board the Eardinge. ii/r- th ! 1 ^ e ^ nwhil ? Sir Arthur Hardinge, C.B., K.C.M.G'., His Majesty's Minister at Tehran, had arrived in Maskat in H.M.S. Sphinx in order to conter with the Viceroy, before his entry into Persian waters. The Sphinx brought the number of British vessels present up to 8. That evening Their Excellencies gave a large dinner party on board the Mardmge, to which Sir Arthur Hardinge, His Excellency the Naval ommander-in-Chief and Staff, the Senior Naval Officers belonging to the squadron and the Consular representatives of France and America, in all about 70 persons, were invited. During and after the dinner the Portuguese Forts and the foreshore of the ar our were brilliantly illuminated with myriads of small lamps outliningRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904. 13 the more salient architectural features and at the same time displays of fire works were carried out from the high terraces of the two forts above mentioned. These fireworks and illuminations were the form into which the community of British and British Indian communities had chosen to put their welcome to Their Excellencies, and the general effect was the more picturesque and complete owing to the fact that His Excellency Admiral Atkinson-Willes had thoughtfully arranged for the ships of the squadron to have the outlines of their hulls, masts, and yards illuminated at the same time, so that an equally delightful spectacle was obtainable either from the shore or out at sea. It was thoroughly enjoyed by the populace, and motley crowds of Mas- katis, and Omanis from the interior thronged the beach and streets throughout the day. The morrow, however, the day fixed for the Viceroy's Darbar to the Sultan and his notables, was the item in the programme, which the native public looked forward to with the most lively interest and they certainly had no cause to be disappointed. Eortunately nature too was at her best and graced the occasion with a smooth sea and most perfect weather, the absence of which would have made a very great difference to the comfort and enjoy ment of the darbaris. H.M.S. Argonautt a fine 1st class Cruiser of 11,000 tons and the largest vessel present, was chosen as the most suitable place for the assemblage, and had her quarter-deck transformed into a gorgeous Darbar Hall by the help of the famous kinkobs of the Viceroy's establishment. The only thing to be regretted was that accommodation was not possible for double the number of persons, but as it was, there could not have been less than 300 present. The ceremony was notified to commence at 11-30 A. M., but for an hour before that time boats conveying native darbaris continued to reach the Argonaut, and as the appointed hour drew nigh the booming of cannon announced the arrival, first of the Admiral, then of the Sultan, and finally, when all were seated in their places, of His Excellency the Viceroy. On the Viceroy's right, on the large raised dais, was seated His Highness the Sultan, and on His Excellency's left the British Minister in Persia, the Naval Commander-in-Chief, and their respective staffs.^ Below the dais were seated the Naval Officers of the squadron and other British Officers on duty in Maskat in full dress, and opposite to them an equal number of the Sultan's Officers of State and Notables of Oman. In the centre of the arena on either side of a large gun were accommodated the non-official darbaris and specta tors. The magnificence of the trappings and the galaxy of uniforms made the scene an exceedingly brilliant one which must have impressed itself indelibly on the memories of those present. The Foreign Secretary having by His Excellency's permission formally opened the Darbar, the Chief Arab Notables were brought up in turn and presented by the Political Agent, after which an Arabic address rich in expres- sioDS, of sentiments of the most hearty welcome to the Viceroy and loyal friendship tor the British Throne and its representative, was read aloud on His Highness's behalf by Sheikh Kashid-bin-Ozaiz, Governor of fcemail. His Highness's most erudite official; and afterwards rendered in English by the Political Agent. In reply His Excellency rose and delivered a speech which was received by all present standing, and on its conclusion was read in Arabic by Khan Bahadur Abdurrahman Hakim, Native Attache of the 'Foreign Depart ment. The English text will be appended to this report. While the whole of it was full of interest to those present, and listened to by the darbaris with the keenest attention, the culminating point to them was no doubt reached when at the end of his address His Excellency announced that he had that morning received the gracious permission of His Majesty the King-Emperor to con / : ® r upon His Highness, Seyyid Faisal, the high honour of the Grand Gross or tne Indian Empire. With this auspicious announcement, which was received with much applause, the Darbar was declared closed, and His Excellency then retired to a robing room to prepare for the immediate investiture oi His I1 ess. A few minutes later he returned to the throne on the dais dressed m14 administeation eepoet on the peesian gulf political his robes of a Grand Master of the Order, and the Chapter having been formally opened the Sultan was conducted before the Viceroy with the usual ceremony by the Eoreign Secretary and duly invested with the Eibbon, Badge, Star, and Collar of the Order. The gathering then broke up, His Excellency leaving under the same salute as that which greeted his arrival, followed by the Sultan and Admiral a few minutes later. After leaving the Argonaut the Sultan proceeded direct on board the Hardinge for a short personal interview with Lord Curzon, and also to take leave of him, as His Excellency proposed to leave in the course of the afternoon. The two days of the Viceregal visit had been observed as a public holiday in Maskat and the fete culminated in the afternoon, while the squadron was preparing to get under way, in a series of native dances on the strand in front of the British Consulate, where some 20 or 30 bands of nimble dancers in grotesque costumes and disguises disported themselves until nightfall. Thus ended a most august event in the history of Maskat which the Ruler and his subjects have every reason to remember with the liveliest pleasure. As the principal addresses which were delivered in the course of the visit have a permanent interest and importance, the full text of them is here ap pended for facility of future reference. I. Address presented to Sis Excellency the Viceroy hy the Community of British subjects and other British protected persons in Maskat, May it please Your Excellency, We, the entire community of British subjects, Hindu, Muhammadan, Parsi, and other British protected persons, settled in the towns of Maskat and Mattra, ? most respectfully beg, on behalf of ourselves and our fellow subjects residino' in other parts of His Highness the Sultan's dominions, to offer Your Excef lencies a most heartfelt welcome on the occasion of your visit to Maskat. In doing so, we venture to congratulate Your Excellency, with much respect, on being the first Viceroy and Governor-General of India, since the passing of the destinies of the Indian continent to the British Crown, to visit these distant shores, and to have thus inaugurated a new and vigorous political departure in a sphere where so many Indian interests are involved; and it has been a source of enhanced gratification to us to know that since Your Excel lency's happy decision to accept an extension of your term of office (a decision which has been received by all classes of His Majesty the Eing-Emperor's subjects with lively satisfaction), the first great act of policy which Your Excellency has undertaken has been this most auspicious tour in the Gulfs of Oman and Persia. Accustomed as the races peopling these shores are to receive impressions from outward appearances, we cannot but feel confident that this happy under taking will prove to be an epoch-making event in the progress and enhance ment of British prestige and influence. It will serve, too, as an abiding demonstration to the inhabitants of the littoral that the preponderating influence of Great Britain in these waters is no shadowy or remote force, but a lively and dignified reality, and that the Viceroy of the King-Emperor, who holds benevolent sway over the millions of the vast continent of British India watches with no less zeal and keen interest the welfare of His Most Gracious Majesty's subjects scattered all over the Gulf. Except to give Your Excellencies a respectful and hearty welcome, and to give expression to our loyalty and devotion to the great Government whose subjects we are, we have little cause to trespass on Your Excellency's time, and, so far as our own local and particular needs and circumstances are concerned, have an encouraging tale to tell.eesidency and maskat political agency for the year 1903.1904. 15 We enjoy in Maskat the rights and privileges of the most favoured nation, our interests are carefully guarded by our Consular authorities, and we experience complete toleration in matters of religion. There is an absence of unnecessary litigation amongst us, British subjects, and justice is readily and promptly obtainable in the Agency Court. In matters connected 'with our dealings with the natives of Oman, while we are accustomed to receive a courteous hearing from His Highness, never theless we often experience difficulty in obtaining relief, and this is partly owing no doubt to the unsettled state of the interior. In this latter connec tion, we make bold to explain to Your Excellency that, whereas, considering the degree of enlightenment among the Bedouin Arabs, inter-tribal strife and turbulence are within the nature of things, and when they are limited to the interior of the country do not immediately affect our welfare any more than that of other peaceable members of the community; nevertheless, when, as is sometimes the case, the scene of the strife is transferred to the coast ports, or their immediate neighbourhood, our commercial interests do imfnediately suffer; and we are put to anxiety for the safety of the lives and properties of our fellow-subjects. Eor, as Your Excellency is aware, at many of the coast towns of Oman (often far removed from the capital) small communities of British Indian subjects reside, in whose hands all the local trade is centred, and who, in however humble a capacity, are the pioneers of British Indian commerce in these waters. Thanks to the vigilant activity of successive Political Agents and of British Men-of-war at seasons of unrest, there is little actual danger to the lives and properties of these our fellow-subjects, but the detriment to their trading operations and ours is great, and we venture to hope that Your Excel lency's Government will see its way, either by strengthening the hands of the ruler, or by active interference on the coast where necessary for the preserva tion of British interests, to take measures which will deter the unruly tribesmen of Oman from disturbing the commerce of the country by their dissensions. In matters of commerce generally, we continue to prosper, and though during the last few years signs have not been wanting of foreign competition, Indian imports rule the market. There is one depressing factor, however, of comparatively recent growth to which we make bold to draw Your Excellency's benevolent attention, and that is the demoralising fluctuations in the silver exchange. Since the closing of the Indian mints in 1893, and the consequent fall in the price of silver, the local Dollar exchange has not ceased to exhibit remarkable fluctuations, which greatly prejudice and impede the local import trade, from the fact that the currency value of the rupee is fixed and that of the Maskat Dollar is not. We therefore humbly commend the matter to Your Excellency's wise consi deration in the hope that, in co-operation with the local Government, some means may be devised of bringing about a better state of things. In conclusion, we beg to reiterate our welcome, and to assure you that this visit of Your Excellency and your gifted Consort will be a landmark in the history of M askat and will live green in our memories ; and it is our earnest praver before the Supreme Being, in whose hands the destiny ot all of us lie, to vouchsafe to Your Excellency a continuance of bodily health and strength to enable you to render further great services to the Empire and to bind fresh laurels on your brow. We beg to subscribe ourselves Tour Excellency's most humble servants. 11. Eis Excellency's reply Gentlemen, It is with much pleasure that I have received the loyal and t^ address which has just been read, and that on crossing16 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL the shores of another country I find a large and prosperous community of the subjects of His Majesty the King-Emperor existing and plying their trade here in conditions of security and contentment. I have made some attempt to ascertain the numbers of British Indian subjects who are thus to be found in Maskat and other parts of Oman, and I find that they amount to no fewer than 1,300 persons, the majority of whom came originally, or come now, from the opposite shores of Sind and Kathiawar. The fact that these two coasts face each other at so inconsiderable a distance and the well known aptitudes of the particular communities that you represent sufficiently explain the close mercantile connections that have grown up during the last century between Maskat and India and leave one in no surprise at the commercial predominance of Gr^at Britain in the trade and shipping of this State. Gentlemen, the political ^ stake of one country in another is sometimes measured by its commercial interests, but does not always lend itself readily to precise or mathematical definition; on the other hand, the commercial stake is more easily reduced to figures and calculations, the effect of which is not open to dispute, I will take, for instance, the time in which I have been connected with the Government of India, namely, the last five years, when I find that during that period the British proportion of trade with the port of Maskat has averaged 84 per cent., and that of the total number of steamers that have entered and cleared from this port in the same time the average British percentage in each year has been 97. I am satisfied that the predominance of Great Britain in the mercantile interests of the State is supreme and incontestable, and I realise that in addressing you I am receiving a body of gentlemen who represent a not unimportant outpost of British commercial enterprise in the East and whose labours have contributed and still contribute in no small degree to the material welfare of Oman. I am glad to hear from you that in the pursuit of this peaceful avocation your interests are safe guarded by the successive Political Agents—and by none I am sure more diligently than by Major Cox—who have been sent here to represent the Government of India. That you obtain justice, that you abstain from litigation, and that you enjoy complete religious tolerance—these conditions are all favourable to the success of your operations, and they leave you with little ground for complaint. In one paragraph of your address you have spoken of the disturbances that sometimes spring up in the interior and which occasionally travel down to the coast ports and affect the security of the places in which you reside. The British Government have never embroiled them selves in this internal strife which appears to be a hereditary legacy in Oman, but undoubtedly if it were to reach a point that seriously menaced the interests or imperilled the lives and property of British subjects, lawfully trading upon the coast, we should feel called upon to intervene for their protection, and by no one I am sure would such intervention be more loyally, welcomed or more cordially assisted than by His Highness. You have referred in your address to the depreciation in the local exchange. This is a matter which I will take into consideration. Gentlemen, I am obliged for the kind words in which you have welcomed me to Maskat. I understand that among those who present the address are representatives of other communities, such as the Portuguese of Goa, who enjoy British protection in this State. To all of you I wish a continuance of the conditions under which your trade exists and flourishes in Oman, and I rejoice that there has been presented to me the opportunity, while I am the head of the Government of India, of testifying the interest which I feel in this outlying Colony of Indian influence and trade. It only remains for me to thank you for presenting your address in a specimen of silver work so characteristic of the tastes and customs of the locality. It will always be a memento of this agreeable meeting on the occasion of my present visit to Maskat. III. His Eighness Seyyid Faisal*s public address to the Viceroy at the opening of the Darlav on Argonaut. Yott-R Excellency, I trust it will not be amiss if I take advantage of this auspicious occasion to convey to Your Excellency some public expression of the pleasure andresidency and maskat political agency for the year 1903-1904. 17 honour whicli it affords to^ me and mine, in the first place to be able to welcome Your two lixcellencies and His Excellency the Admiral and your imposing and distinguished escort to our modest capital of Oman, and in the second place to be thus afforded an opportunity of manifesting our sentiments of sincere friendship and attachment to that Great Government of India which Your Excellency directs and to His Majesty the King-Emperor of happy name whose Viceroy and proxy you are in these far off climes. It is now more than a century since my forefathers first entered into treaty relations with Great Britain and 'that an English Resident has represented the Great Government in our Territory, and for a long period before that Maskat had been in constant commercial touch and intercourse with the English through the trading ports of India. During that period the Rulers of Oman have been on terms of the closest friendship with Great Britain and at many of those hours of need and difficulty which are wont to arise so suddenly in an Eastern State I and my forebears have been the greatful recipients, on innumerable occasions, of that moral and substantial support which the British Government in the person of the Viceroy of India has been ever ready to afford. I am therefore in no way different from my predecessors in owing a large debt of gratitude to the Viceroy of India, but there is one point in this connection in respect of which I do stand alone am&amp;ig the Seyyids of Oman and that is in experiencing the great honour and pleasure of being able to welcome a Viceroy of India in person to Maskat and to express my feelings to him face to face: and it is with grateful appreciation and with the knowledge that my relations and my loyal subjects will fully endorse what I say that I declare that at no time in Maskat history and from no Viceroy has greater sympathy and kindness been extended to us than by this great Viceroy, Lord Curzon, whom I am privileged to address to-day. I consider myself particularly fortunate therefore in being able to testify before this august assemblage to the reality of our obligations and the sincerity of our appreciation of them. More than this I beg Your Excellency to believe me when I declare that neither I nor my brother nor my children should they be called upon to follow after me will ever cease to he mindful of the claims of that strong and ancient friendship which in time past has kept secure the bonds of union existing between Great Britain and ourselves, and that we w r ill at all times remain loyal to those ties. I am afraid that Maskat offers few attractions to the experienced traveller, and except to put our houses and highways in order as far as circumstances have permitted and to proclaim a general holiday during Your Excellencies , august presence here there has been little that it has been possible for us to do in honour of this great occasion. In this regard I can only ask Your Excellency to call to mind the sentiments of the poet who sang:— ' It is not every thing that a man wants that he can achieve; nor can the speeding barque command the wind that she listeth.' At any rate I hope that Your Excellency and your fair and precious Lady, Her Excellency Lady Curzon, will not carry away with you from Maskat any but kindly recollections. , ' IV. Sis Excellency the Viceroy's reply to the above. Your Highness, Your Excellencies, and Gentlemen, Your Highness has already addressed me yesterday in terms of warm welcome to your Capital and State, and to-day you have anticipated much of what I desired to say in the speech which you have just spontaneously delivered, in which you have spoken in feeling language of the historic con nection between the British Government and the State of Oman, It was Your Highness's own great grandfather with whom the first treaty was concluded with the East India Company 106 years ago. As you have further reminded me, for more than a century has a British Representative been stationed at18 ADMINISTRATION' REPORT 0!N THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Maskat, and during that time the friendly intercourse between the two GoyernmMts has been demonstrated by a series of treaties or conventions of Which I can trace no fewer than nine, and which have provided for the closest political and commercial relations as well as for the suppression of the slave trade and of piracy, and for the extension of the electric telegraph. This series of agreements not only sufficiently testifies to the connections that have grown 'P be^een the two Governments and that have linked the btate ot Oman to the British Government by quite exceptional ties, but thev have also been strengthened, as Your Highness has pointed out, by the support which has been given on critical occasions by the British Government to successive Rulers ot Oman, while a further and natural bond of union is supplied by the facts that Maskat lies just opposite to the shores of India that its trade is not only for the most part with India, but is largely in Indian hands, that a large number of British Indian subjects reside here, and that the prosperity of the State is mainly dependent on these conditions. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Government of India should feel a particular interest in this place, or that a Viceroy of India should desire to visit it and to make the acquaintance of its Kuler. His pleasure in doing so is sreatlv enhanced when he learns from Your Highness's own lips that you and your children will ever be mindful _ of these strong and ancient obligations, and that to them you and they will always remain loyal. These are words which I shall cherish in friendly recollection, not only on my own beball, but on behalf of the Government which I represent Jour Highness has now ruled your State for fifteen years. I had the pleasure of visiting it when you had only just succeeded fourteen years ago, and I am glad to congratulate Your Highness on the progress that has since been made, ihe volume of your trade is steadily increasing, the wise step which the Government of India so strongly urged on Your Highness a few years ago of taking over the customs of your State in preference to farming them' to others, has been attended with largely increased profits, and it gave me much satisfaction, two years ago, with Your Higbness's permission, to brino- your capital into still closer connection with the outer world by laying a telegraphie cable from Jask to Maskat I also personally selected Major Cox, as an officer m whose discretion and ability I had perfect confidence, to represent the Government of India at your capital, and Your Highness has already assured me that you have found in him a prudent councillor and friend. At Delhi in January last, though Your Highness was unable to accept my in vitation to the great ceremony that we held to celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty the King-Emperor, I had the pleasure of welcoming your son laimur, and of conversing with him about the condition and welfare of Oman! I have referred to the fact that the British Government have extended a peculiar measure of protection in the past to the State of Oman and its Rulers. They have on more than one occasion intervened to save it from rebellion or disruption. Your Highness may rest assured that this policy will not he departed from. So long as the Rulers of Oman continue to observe their treaty engagements to the Government of India, and to administer this State with enlightenment and justice, they will continue to receive the support of the British Government, which is interested in preserving the peace of the country and the security of its trade. We cannot regard with satisfaction the attempts of discontented classes or persons among Your Highness's subjects to disturb the tranquillity of your State, because, in so doing, not only do they contest Your Highness's authority, but they are apt to injure the interests of British subjects also. These interests we are bound to protect for our own sake as well as for yours. We hope that Your Highness will continue to triumph over all such adversaries as in the past. I trust that this important occasion, when for the first time a Ruler of Oman and the Representative in India of the Illustrious British Sovereign exchange greetings in the waters of Maskat, may he a landmark in the history of the ever widening and deepening connection between our two States, that the firm friendship between them • may continue to grow, and that Your Highness may be blessed with health and long life to rule over a pacified and loyal people. I have still one agree- ab.e tunction to perform. Only yesterday I received the gracious permissionRESIDENCY AKD MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAH 1903-1904. of His Majesty the King-Emperor to confer upon 'Your Highness the high honour of the Grand Cross of the Order of the Indian Empire. This dis tinction will he a proof to Your Highness of the sincere sentiments of friend ship which are entertained towards you by the British Government, and it is also a recognition of the loyalty to which Your Highness has given such fervent expression on more than one occasion in the course of yesterday and to-day. It will n oW m y as Grand Master of the Order to proceed to the due and solemn investiture of Your Highness. The Resident in the Persian Gulf, Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemhall, Eesident's &lt;3 I.E., visited Maskat in April 1903 and again in November, a few days Asent; 8 V1 ' before the arrival of His Excellency the Viceroy. The Political Agent made several short trips to various coast ports during political the year, including Khor Eakan, Mureir, Shinas, Saham, Sohar, Suweik, tours * Khaboora, Mesnaa Barka, and Seeb on the Batineh coast and Soor to the south of Maskat. No inland tours were found practicable this year, as in the snrina; and at the beginning of the cold season, the two most favourable times for touring, important events were taking place which necessitated the Political Agent's remaining in Maskat. 0 The administration of the Maskat and Mattrah customs, which continue Adm ^istratioii to be under the direct management of the local Government, has been satis factory so far as the relations between the Customs Superintendent, his staff, ^nd the tradin 0 * public are concerned, complaints from merchants having been few durino- the year and easy of adjustment; but a system by which sudden calls on the State Exchequer are met hy drafts upon the Customs Superintendent is obviously unsound, and liable to place that official in frequent difficulties and to prevent him from doing full 3ustice to his charge. Judfine from the trade returns which the local Government is good enough to supply, the revenues calculated on the volume of trade must again this year have reached the highest figure they have yet touched chiefly owing to a strong boom in arms just at the end of the year, the causes of S are not quite apparent. With such an improving revenue, if the Sultan's fiscal administration could be conducted on somewhat more business, like lines, the financial position of the Euler would be on a sounder footing than ever before. His Highness Seyyid Faisal has in the last few years shown such a ready inclination to profit by Western ideas in details of his Adminis tration, that there is every reason to hope that enlightened progress w ultimately be introduced also in the direction under reference. Meanwhile it • a nionsnrp to record this year a continuance of the great improvements (the inception of which was mentioned in last year's report) to the customs premises under°he direction of the new Superintendent. The new storage warehouses sheds and offices have now been completed, and the merchandise of importers is wdl protected against the elements, and the ingenuity of those lisht-fin-'ered gentry who formerly so frequently levied toll on it.

IJnfortunately just at the close of the rear a fresh batch of disputes have arisen which will further delay settlement, meanwhile the fcultan has lost and is losing a considerable amount of revenue and on the other hand the merchants there remain dissatisfied with the state of things and are inclined to transfer their trade to other ports, Seif-bin-Yaarub, who has acted as Wali at Gwadur during the year, seems to be srmng satisfaction in the discharge of his duties, and the frequent complaints which were made against his predecessor do not anpear to arise against him. 1 r Arms Traffic.

In consequence of this sudden boom practically no stock in hand remained on the mereUants' books at the end of the year under report. The following are the proportions of the trade taken delivery of bv the several nationalities concerned in it: — Health. Per cent. Arab snl.jects British do. , • • • • • » Foreign do. 35^ 49 These figures tell their own tale. Maskat has remained quite free from epidemic disease of any sort and the public health has been on the whole good. Strict quarantine has been mamtamed against India, the duties of Health Officer being performed as usual by the Agency Surgeon, under whose careful supervision preventive measures were carried out with an entire absence of friction. One unpleasant incident, however, occurred at the beginning of the year under review. Early in April three Soon subjects of His Highness the Sultan who had arrived in Maskat as 2nd class passengers by the mail steamer from Bombay, broke quarantine W unc ^ er §'® 1Q ^ usual period of detention under medical observation and absconded after dark m a native sailing boat, intending to make for Soor. On the way they called at Bunder Jisseh evidently in pursuance of a pre arranged plan, and picked up two fellow tribesmen who had accompanied them trom Bombay, but who being deck-passengers had been sent to the quarantine lazaretto a couple of miles down the coast. ^ being reported to the Sultan in the morning he requested that His Majesty s ship Ferseus, which was then lying in harbour, would place her launch at his disposal for the pursuit of the truants. This request was acceded to, and His Highness s Arab quarantine Superintendent was despatched in her m pursuit. There had been little or no wind during the night and the launch came up with the small dhow containing the Sooris about 30 miles from Maskat. As the steam-cutter hove in sight the Arabs made for the shore, but were unable to escape owing to the precipitousness of the coast, and were safely brought back to Maskat, and in the morning were awarded a term of imprisonment by the Sultan. It turned out, however, that three out of the ve claimed to be exempt from the Sultan's jurisdiction on the ground that i 0VVS . French Flag, and a representation was forthwith made by the French Consul demanding their release as French proteges. To th is request, however. His Highness did not feel able to accede, and consulted hpfwA ^ n • M 0 ^ er f ma ^ er » the result that it was discussed between His Majesty's Foreign Office and the French Government, and an amicable arrangement arrived at, by which it was settled to refer the wholeRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1903-1904. 21 \ question of the French Flag in Oman to arbitration by the Hague Tribunal. On receiving this satisfactory news, His Highness the Sultan was pleased, on the advice of the Government of India, to release all five delinquents from confinement after a month's incarceration. The reference to the Hague Con vention is an eminently satisfactory arrangement, and it is confidently hoped by His Highness that this difficult question will be, within a measurable time, definitely adjusted. In July an Indian of the name of Lai Khan Ali Khan, in the employ of Law * a clerk in the office of the British Indian Agents at Maskat, murdered his wife in a most bloodthirsty manner during a fit of jealousy, and then made a murderous attack on her supposed paramour, finally attempting to take his own life with the same knife as he had used upon his victims. The murderer's windpipe was completely severed, and his condition very serious, but he recovered under the skilful treatment of the Agency Surgeon, and after examination in His Majesty's Consular Court was committed for trial to the Sessions of the High Court in Bombay. The Jury found him guilty of murder and attempted suicide, and he was sentenced to transportation for life. The new buildings under erection on the site adjoining the Consulate in- Building tended for the Agency Surgeon's residence and quarters for the staff of the 0 P erations ' Consulate and Telegraph Department were to have been finished by the end of the financial year. Owing, however, to the difficulty experienced in importing masons and coolie labour from Karachi as the result of stringent emigration regulations in force there, it was found necessary to extend the period of the contract, and a good deal of work still remains to be done. Improvements have been carried out at the coal depot, including the Makullal1 C0V8 - reclamation of a piece of the foreshore from the sea in order to replace the loss of storage space resulting to us from the presentation of a moiety of the original space to the French Government for storage of their coal. A stone jetty has also been thrown out from the sea wall which it is hoped will expedite coaling operations by saving coolies fatigue of wading. The wreck of the S.S. Amiral Gueydon. In May last a large French Marine, liner, the Amiral Gueydon, bound from davre to the far east with passen gers and cargo, caught fire when in the neighbourhood of Socotra owing to an explosion in her fore hatch, and her Commander decided that the only chance of saving the lives of his passengers and crew was to turn the ships head to leeward and run her ashore on the coast of Southern Arabia. This he was successful in doing, and he could hardlyhave chosen a better spot than that chanced upon, namely, the soft sandy strand under the lee of Ras Hasek near Dhofar in the Sultan's territory. The Monsoon having by this time com menced, communication by native craft with Maskat or elsewhere was impos sible owing to the heavy sea running, and a messenger sent overland never arrived, so there the unfortunate mariners had to remain until the season opened again. For four months the ship's company and passengers consisting of 350 men, one lady and two children were encamped on the strand alongside of the smouldering'ship in rough tents made of awnings, etc., and provisioning themselves from the ship's stores. During that time they appear (from the account given to the press by the Comniander) to have been treated with surprising humanity by the wild Gara and Mahri tribesmen who inhabit that inhospitable coast. After they had been there a short time the news of their shipwreck reached the Sultan's Governor at Dhofar, and he at once joined them in person and gave them the protection of his presence until the monsoon sea subsided, and it was possible for him to hire dhows to take the party to Maskat. In due course, on 12th September, he procured three dhows and the whole of the shipwrecked persons after storing a large quantity of provisions in the dhows left in them for Maskat escorted by some representatives of the 'Wali. On the voyage thither, they were encountered by the Eussian mer- chantman Trouver homeward bound, taken on board, and safely landed at Aden a few days later. It is interesting to note that the Amiral Gueydon was ultimately raised by the salvage steamer of the Perim Coal Company and reached Perim safely at the end of December, at which time she is said to have been still smouldering, seven months after she caught fire 1V 22 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP ^POLITICAL Navy, Slave Trade. Official Changes. Maskat was visited during the year by the following ships of His Majesty's Navy, Sphinx, Naiad, Pomone, Ferseus, Lapwing, Hyacinth, Argonaut, and Fox ; and by the Lawrence and Eardinge of the Royal Indian Marine and by the Government Telegraph Steamer Fatrick Stewart. Foreign navies were represented by the Erench Flagship Infer net, the Persian gunboat Muzafferi, and the Turkish vessel Zohaf, JSo slaves were brought in by His Majesty's ships for adjudication in the Court of this Consulate, nor did any organized slave cruising take place owin^ to His Majesty's ships being otherwise employed. Eighty-eight fugitive slaves took refuge at the British Consulate. Of these, 84 were freed with the consent of the Sultan, two were found not to be entitled to freedom, and two left the Consulate while their cases were under enquiry. The gang of Soori slave runners, whose capture to the number of about 150 at Mozambique was mentioned in last year's report, were sentenced to 25 years' imprisonment and deported to Angola in West Africa. This should have a salutary effect on the Soor community. Major P. Z.

Part I.— GENERAL SUMMARY. i .-Geuerai. Rainfall and Harvest.—In most of the districts of Southern Persia the rainfall has been above the average, especially around Bushire and in Tangistan, where it was so heavy in the early part of December as to cause great loss to life and property among the inhabitants of villages situated near the base of the maritime range, owing to the sudden discharge of violent freshets from the watersheds above. Pessimistic forecasts regarding the crops were for some time received from the Karun Districts, but timely rain in March tended to improve prospects, and a welcome fall in the price of grain has resulted. At Shiraz, and in fact throughout Pars, the severest winter recorded for many years has been experienced, but owing to the copious rainfall a bumper harvest is anticipated from all crops except opium. It is satisfactory to report that owing to the prosperous condition of the standing crops in many districts the embargo on the export of grain has now been removed. The Govevnovship of JBushife and the Gulf Forts. His Excellency the Darya Begi after a prolonged period of repose at the Capital returned to Bushire at the end of April on re-appointment, and has discharged the duties of Governor throughout the year. FuUic Feace and Tranquility. —In the month of May, notwithstanding that a reconciliation had just been arrived at between Zyer Khudar and Zyer Ghulam Ali, the rival Chieftains of Tangistan, a follower of the former attacked and killed Zyer Ghulam Ali, with the result that the whole district soon became much disturbed; but it was not until October that the Darya Begi actin 0 * under orders from the Central Government, left Bushire, accompanied by 100 tofangchis, to assist the Governor of Dashti in an expedition against Tangistan. Zyer Khudar fled, and after looting and setting fire to the village of Ahmed, His Excellency the Governor returned to Bushire. The Bushire-Shiraz caravan road has at no time during the year been in a satisfactory state and at intervals has been regrettably insecure. Cases of blackmail and interference with caravans have been reported and on more than one occasion toll has been levied on the mail bags of the Persian post. There was considerable excitement and unrest in Bunder Abbas in the early part of the year, and the neighbourhood of that port, as well as the Lar2 ADMINISTRATION REPOET ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL district generally, remained in a very disorderly state. It was even thought at one period that Bunder Abbas itself might be raided, and though this did not actually occur, caravan traffic was practically brought to a standstill for some weeks. The apparent cause of this insecurity was the dissemination from the capital of disquieting rumours regarding the health of His Majesty the Shah, reports which happily turned out to have little foundation, but which always seem to furnish the turbulent section of the community with an excuse for a display of lawlessness. Quarantine and Tublic Eenlth—^iz Quarantine Administration of the Island of Bushire and the Gulf Ports has continued to be administered on behalf of the Persian Government by the British Eesidency Surgeons, under whose supervision European Assistant Surgeons of the Government of India are employed as Quarantine Medical Officers at the Gulf Ports of Mohammerah Lingah, and Bunder Abbas. The accommodation for upper class passengers, European and Native, at Lingah and Bunder Abbas leaves much to be desired, but repeated representa tions to the Central Government have not yet been fruitful of result. The Island and Port of Bushire is the Besidency Surgeon's special care as heretofore and in co-operation with him the Persian Customs Administration, which is now responsible for the disbursement of the expenses of sanitary preventive measures, continued to assist in the work. In January 1905, Br. Eaivre, a Erench Sanitary Expert, connected with the Paris Sanitary Convention, having been deputed to make a tour of the Gulf ports and to examine the preventive arrangements there existing, arrived in Bushire and after making a short stay visited Mohammerah, Bunder Abbas, Ormuz, and Henjam. Upidemics—DuYmg the summer of 1904 the whole region lying within tbe purview of the Eesidency was visited by disease in a more or less severe epidemic form, the port of Bunder Abbas being the only locality which on this occasion was spared a visitation. Plague was the first to make its appearance and during May and June threatened to become epidemic on the coast and hinterland of Southern Ears. Numerous cases occurred in Lingah and the inhabitants, taking alarm, com menced to migrate inland in large numbers and thus carried the infection with them, with the result that the disease was soon reported from the Lar district. At this time there seemed good grounds to fear a widespread epidemic of plague, but curious to relate, as soon as cholera, which had meanwhile made its appearance, had gained a footing, very little more was heard of plague, and the latter pest gradually died out without assuming serious proportions. Cholera, which had already appeared at Bussorah, now spread southwards. Early in May Mohammerah and Bahrein became affected and the authorities at Bushire realised the necessity of instituting special preventive measures if Bushire was not to share the fate of its sister ports in the Gulf. The epidemic seems to have generated in Turkish Arabia or Mesopotamia and to have travelled from thence into Persia over two well-marked circular routes, one entering northwards via Kermanshah, Tehran, and Ispahan, and the other from the south, penetrating Ears through some of the small unprotected coast ports, and after spreading contagion in Tangistan generally, making its way north by the caravan road between Bushire and Shiraz. Ispahan was probably the point on the circuit where the northern current from Kum and Tehran met the southern current from the coast of Ears and Shiraz. At Shiraz, the capital of Ears, the epidemic was especially severe, though happily not of very long duration. The total mortality was assessed at from 7,000 to 10,000 souls, and when the disease was at its height, the death-roll is believed to have touched 1,000 per diem. The fact that the inhabitants obtain their drinking water from watercourses passing through the crowded streets of the city, which are used for all and sundry purposes, probably accounts for the readiness of Shiraz to assimilate the germ and as, owing to the virulence of theRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. ' epidemic, the innumerable dead were in many cases only superficially buried, there is some reason to fear that the coming hot weather may see a recrudescence. On receipt of reports from His Majesty's Consul pointing to the urgent need of the Shiraz community for the ministrations of a European doctor, the services of the Residency Surgeon, Bushire, with the concurrence of the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister, were spared for duty there, and assisted by His Majesty's Consul and other European residents, he rendered such devoted service to the stricken community as the prejudices of the latter would allow them to accept. Two Europeans succumbed, one of tbem Mr. Van Lennep, the able and respected representative of the Imperial Bank of Persia. Captain Condon's deputation at this critical time was only rendered possible by the continued immunity enjoyed by Bushire itself. Though, as before stated, the disease bad evidently entered Ears through some of the small ports to the north or south of Bushire, and although the neighbouring villages of Tangistan and Dashtistan were one after another infected, the port of Bushire continued to enjoy a phenomenal immunity, only one authentic case being discovered. This, I consider, must be attributed to two causes : firstly, the timely and effective arrangements instituted by the Ee^idency Surgeon as Chief Sanitary Officer for Bushire and the Gulf ports, assisted by the Customs Administration, and, secondly, to the natural advantages which Bushire possesses for resisting the ingress of epidemic disease, by which I mean its peninsular formation and the character of its water-supply, both of which render the locality a comparatively easy one to handle and protect. In July the epidemic spread to the ports of the Trucial Chiefs, and for two months raged with considerable severity. It is computed that as many as 8,000 persons succumbed within their collective jurisdictions between July and September, when the disease gradually died out. Administration of Customs in the Persian (7^.—During the year under report the operations of the Imperial Customs Administration have been extended and developed. Several new posts have been inaugurated and the local influence of the Belgian officials of the department, wherever they are, has been much augmented by the recent introduction of an arrangement under which they are entrusted with the disbursement of the salaries of the local Persian officials. Among the new Customs posts opened since the issue of the ^ K^glement Douanier those at the islands of Kharag and Henjam deserve special mention. The Arab inhabitants of the latter islands!, whose place of primary origin is Debai and other parts of the Trucial Coast, have shown the greatest resentment to an innovation which they regard as a significant encroachment upon their time-honoured privileges as a semi -independent Arab community, and were it not for the revival of the British Telegraph Station on the island (outside the immediate precincts ot which the Customs official hardly dares set toot), it would probably be impossible for him to remain at his post at all. The following interesting episode in connection with the institution of Customs posts and Guards on certain of these islands is worth recording. Monsieur Dambrain, Director-General of the Customs of the south, proceeded on tour in the Customs Steamer Muzaffer at the end of last year, and on Ms return to Bushire early in April 1904, it transpired t^t he had landed Customs Guards on the islands of Sim, Abu Musa and lamb, and that in the case of the last two mentioned he had taken the extreme measure of hauJing down the Jowasmi flags of the Sheikh of Shargah's representatives and had hoisted the Persian flag in their place. •rhp RIMS. Lawrence, which had been despatched to the islands for the purpose, haying verified the reports originally received, the Government of India and His Majesty's Minister at Tehran were informed of what had occurred, and the ultimate result was that the Persian flags on Tamb and Abu Musa were removed by the Persian Government themselves and the Jowasmi flaes re-erectpd and an unpleasant incident was thus avoided. As regards the third island of Sirri, thnugh the title of the Shah's Government to place their4 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL flag and guard there has not been recognised by His Majesty's Government further discussion of this point has for the present been held in abeyance. The loner expected ' Eeglement Douanier ' was authoritatiyely issued and came into force on the 1st September 1904. This fiocument constitutes the working regulations of the Persian Customs Administration as conducted under Belgian management, and was provided for by the Article 5 of the AnHo- Persian Declaration of 9th February 1903. Attached to the Bfcglement is a list of the places at which Customs posts are authorised, and at the head of this list it is set forth that the said list can only be departed from by special Keso- lutiocs of the Ministry of Customs, which must be duly notified to the British Legation. Prom the date of the execution of the Declaration of February 1903 up to the present time, the Customs Administration had been guided in their work by a series of temporary rules issued from time to time from the Central Office and had been allowed considerable scope for the exercise of discretion and for applying the rules on elastic lines. Now, however, that the formal Keglement has been issued, there is little further room for the exercise of any such discre tion and the rigorous enforcement of its multitudinous provisions (many of them quite unsuited to Gulf conditions) has been the cause of a good deal of difficulty and friction, which, however, it is hoped will gradually subside if those Articles that are found to work specially hardly can be modified in due course. So much feeling has been caused by the strict application of certain Articles that towards the close of the^ year the Persian mercantile community seem inclined to show active opposition to their enforcement and to contemplate, by the way of protest, the total suspension of their trading operations until their grievances are heard. As the greater part of the business of this community is with Bombay, such a denouement could not but have a very injurious effect upon our own commercial interests, and every effort is being made to prevent the incidence of a complete deadlock. Since the issue of the R^glement, serious difficulties have several times arisen with the Customs authorities at various Gulf ports in coDnection with mails for the British Post Offices. In their zealous endeavours to carry out the letter of the^ regulations punctiliously, local Customs officials have seemed inclined at times to place the most strained interpretation on some of the Articles of the Ueglement^and in doing so have more than once been led into taking arbitrary action which, if it did not fortunately bring about any specially untoward result, produced temporary situations of considerable local delicacy, pending adjustment by higher authority. In this connection I would chiefly allude to cases of interference with mail bags in transit. For instance, at Bushire on 1st December 1904, the British parcel mail bags instead of being taken as usual direct to the British Post Office were forcibly seized by the Customs authorities and held up for a week until the matter had arrived at a settlement through His Majesty's Legation. Similar attempts were also made at i^ingah and Mohammerah to gain possession of the mail bags on their being landed, and at Bunder Abbas four bags were actually seized and only released after being opened at the Custom House. Another connection in which the Customs authorities seem to have formed erroneous ideas of their powers under the Eeglement has been that of arms and ammunition in transit and destined for other than Persian ports. Thus in January, although a precisely parallel case had occurred earlier in the year (on which occasion the Resident and Consul-General had refused to acquiesce in the delivery to the Customs authorities by the Captain of a British Steamer of certain arms carried by passengers proceeding to Koweit) the Director- General of Customs at Bushire called upon the commander of S. S. Goalpara to deliver to him certain arms and ammunition belonging to a party of Turkish Regulars proceeding on relief from A1 Hassa via Bahrein and Bushire to Bussorah. In spite of several exchanges of views between the Director-General and the Residency, the former insisted on his right to seize and confiscate the arms, and in the end appeal having been made to the British Consulate-General by the Turkish Vice Consul — the Resident saw no other course open to hi -rn thaa£*5 RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE THE YEAR 1904-1905. 5 to transfer tho soldiers with their arms to the fast mail steamer under a guard and to send them on forthwith to their destination. This was accordingly done. These incidents are recorded as examples of the difficulties which must inevitably arise until the public and the Customs officials have become thoroughly acquainted with the precise interpretation to be placed on the multi tudinous sections of the Eeglement. Meanwhile there can be no doubt of the advisability of enforcing the letter of it with reserve until the many little modifications which it will inevitably need have become manifest and have been remedied. P ersonnel. Monsieur Dambrain, who was Pirector-General at Bushire at the beginning-of the year, proceeded on furlough in May and was replaced by Monsieur E. Waffelaert Irom Mohammerah. The latter remained until the middle of February, when he left for Kermanshah on transfer. He was succeeded on the 29th March by M. Heynssens from the Caspian Division. Settlement of Claims. —The outstanding claims referred to ia last year's report have, I regret to say, made no progress towards settlement, in spite of unremitting efforts on the part of this Residency and the representations of His Majesty's Legation. Postal Service. —The fast mail service from Bombay to the Persian Gulf has been still further accelerated during the year under report by the introduc tion of three fine turbine steamers by the British India Steam Navigation Company, the first of which, the Ling a, on her maiden voyage arrived at Bushire in five days from Bombay after calling at Karachi and Maskat.

The pearling season was not at all a successful one, the take being only in.—The aboat half of what it was last year, uhile the relative prices ruled about one- Trucial Coast, third less. The maritime truce has been well maintained throughout the year. Abu ThaU. —Sheikh Zaeed bin Kalifah has spent several months of the present year at his new r settlement of Yahali in the Bereymee Oasis, in which he seems to take more than ordinary interest. He was absent from Abu Thabi both when the port wns visited by Mr. J. G, Lorimer, I.C.S., on Gazetteer duty and again when the Resident visited the coast towards the close of the year. Sheikh Zaeed has recently received a fine mare with trappings as a present from the Sherif of Mecca. Dehai —The administration of this Chief is the most enlightened and promising of any of the Trucial Chiefs, and is justifying the enterprise of the British India Steam Navigation Company in making Debai a regular fortnightly port of call. Apart from the prosperity which this departure seems likely to bring to Debai itself, the frequency of steamer communication with the Coast of the Trucial Chiefs cannot fail to have a civilising influence on their subjects generally. Shargah. —The rule of this Chief, Sheikh Suggur bin Khalid, has not been altogether satisfactory. The same lethargic temperament, which makes him unpopular with his feilow Chiefs of the Trucial Coast, gives him little or no influence over his own subjects and dependents, and when the latter are inclined to show him contumely, he evinces a tendency to sit with folded hands and let the Residency keep order for him, while at the same time he will not bestir himself to effect settlement of the claims of British traders. The Eesi- dent had occasion to speak to him very plainly with regard to his line of con duct at a recent visit, and it is to be hoped that the Sheikh's discharge of his obligations will now show some improvement. His relations with the Headman of Fujeira have not improved in any w r ay during the past 12 months, but nothing has occurred to bring them into relief, and there has been peace in the hinterland. Another dependent of Shargah, the Sheikh of Hamriyeh, is now a good deal estranged from Sheikh Suggur, mainly from the same causes which have \ alienated the Headman of Fuj.eira, namely, the disinclination of Sheikh Suggur ^ to take steps to give his dependent adequate protection when occasion demands6 ADMINISTRATION KEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL it. There has been a change of rulers at Hamriyeh during the year tinder report. The late Sheikh Saif bin Abdul Eahman 'died on September 3rd and was succeeded at first by his son Abdul Rahman, but the latter feeling that his position was not 'very strong and believing that there was a plot brewing for his assassination, abdicated in favour of an older kinsman, Saif bin Saif. The latter, returning evil for good, had no sooner come to power than he commenced to intrigue against Abdul Rahman and endeavoured to deprive him of certain items of his landed property, until Abdul Rahman exasperated by such treatment waited for a suitable opportunity ani attacked Saif bin Saif by night in his house, taking him prisoner and killing his son in the process. At this stage Sheikh Ka-hid, their neighbour of Umm-el-Kowein, appeared on the scene and settled the matter by taking Saif bin Saif away to Umm-el-Kowein, where he has since resided. Probably these incidents might all have been avoided if ths overlord, Sheikh Suggur of Shargah, had his dependency properly in hand. His loose rule, however, has brought its own reward,'and it was hardly a matter for surprise when a report reached the K/esidency of the existence of a plot to depose him and to reinstate his uncle. Sheikh Salim bin Sultan, from whom in i8H3 Sheikh Suggur had himself usurped the Chiefship. Sheikh Suggur was fortunata, however, in getting news of the plot in time to frustrate it. One Mohamed bin Khadim of the Al-i-Ali /ribe, a kinsman of the feheikh's and an Arab of some local influence, was oelieved to have been at the bottom of the scheme. He was arrested with his son and detained for some time, but eventually escaped and fled to IJmm-el-Kowein, where he has now taken ud his residence. Sheikh Suggur after a time and at the request of the Sheikh of Umm el-Kowein somewiiat magnanimously allowed Mohamed bin Khadim to send to fehargah for his family and moveable property. TJmm-el-Kow j in. —The aged Sheikh of this principality, Ahmed bin Abdulla, died a natural death on the 18th June 1^04, and was succeeded by his eldest son Sheikh Hashid bin Ahmed, aged about 35. 1 he succession was a quiet one, Sheikh Kashid having for a long time past, ouing to his father's decrepitude, acted as regent. This Chief appears to be a man of some force of character and ability and is likely to acquire influence on the Trucial Coast. In the course of the year Sheikh Rashid paid a visit to Ajman and married a daughter of the Sheikh of that place, who is already hi&gt; maternal uncle. Zorah. —During his visit to the Trucial Coast in March the Besident took the opportunity of personally visiting the little tract of ground known as Zorah or Zoara, the colonization of which has been a long vexed question among the Chiefs of the Trucial Coast. It is not marked on the Chart, but proved to be nothing but a strip of sandy plain on the sea shore between Hamriyeh and Ajman; in fact it comprises the whole di.-tance between those two places. f J he reason why there has for a long time been such a strong desire by one faction or another to colonise it becomes apparent on an inspection of the locality. The Zorah tract is in the form of half an oval, the chord of which represents the Coast line. An inlet of the sea on either side makes it only approachable by two fords even at low water, one on the Ajman side and one near Hamriyeh. At highwater it is a complete island. It follows therefore that, given the erec tion of a couple of block-houses to command the fords, the site of. Zorah would form a very strong defensive position from an Arab point of view, and if the tribe which occupied it we e a powerful one, they would have Ajman and Hamriyeh at their mercy. It appeared to be clearly the case that its coloniza tion could only be safely encouraged in the event of a complete unanimity of opinion and explicit agreement on the part of all the Sheikhs as to the precise conditions on which it might be occupied. Such unanimity is an extremely unlikely contigency. IV.-Bahrein. Captain P. B. Prideaux, Indian Army, took over the duties of the Bahrein Political Agency on 18th October 1904, relieving Mr. J. C. Gaskin, who pro ceeded on tour with Mr. J. G. Lorimer, I.C.S. The Bahrein pearl fisheries proved more prolific than usual this season in pearls of good quality, but pearling operations were much hindered by incessant gales from the North-West.EESIDENCY AND MASKATTOLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. Though rumours regarding the movements of the notorious pirate Ahmed bin Selman were constantly being heard, no piracies actually occurred in Bahrein waters. The slackness of Sheikh Esa's rule and the consequent absence of law and order in Manama, were a cause of a good deal of anxiety to the Residency during the latter part of the year under report. Tliis state of things was found to be mainly due to the unruly demeanour and lawless acts of the Chief's nephew and son-in-law, Sheikh Ali bin Ahmed, and Ids numerous negro retainers. The first incident of importance occurred in September, under the following circumstances : Some retainers of Sheikh Ali acting under his oraers endeavoured to exact Sukhra' or forced labour from some coolies actually working for Herr Bahnson, the local representative of the German merchant Herr 'Wonckhaus trading at Bahrein and e lse wer e Heir Bahnson hearing a disturbance going on in his compound went down to see what it was about, and in trying to save his employes from being beaten was severely assaulted by some of Sheikh Aii's servants and even roughly handled by Sheikh Ali himself, who lived close by and had now joined his men. Owing to his fear of his nephew, Sheikh Esa could not be persuaded to take any substantial notice of the incident as recom mended first by Mr, Gaskin and later by Captain Prideaux, but as the Resident was soon expected at Bahrein, he asked that it might be left for the latter's decision and undertook to abide by it. Owing to absence on tour in Arabistan, the Resident's arrival at Bahrein was delayed until 30th November, and in the meanwhile Sheikh Ali's servants had committed themselves again, on 14th November, by taking a prominent part in, if not actually organising, a wanton and savage attack on the small community of Persian (Shiah) shop keepers dealing in groceries and dry goods in the Manama Bazar. Seven or eight of these Persians were badly hurt; fingers and wrists were broken, and one old greybeard of 80 had his skull fractured. Here again in spite of the Political Agent's efforts the Sheikh had taken no steps whatever to punish the offenders. As the result of considerate pressure from the Resident, Sheikh Esa accepted his advice in the case of the assault against the German subjects exacting substantial pecuniary compensation for Herr Bahnson, flogging four of the ringleadeis who took part in the assault upon him, obliging his nephew Sheikh Ali to leave Bahrein for a stated period until the- orders of Government should be received as to. his future, and finally undertaking to notify a prohibi tion against the exercise by petty Sheikhs of the right of commandeering labour from the employes of merchants other tlrnn his own subjeets. In the second case., the attack upon the Persians, Sheikh Esa showed the utmost obstinacy and could not be persuaded to comply with the Resident's demand* 0' to take any alternative action of a substantial nature. A reference had, therefore, to be made to the Government of India with a view to the employ ment of force, and on 19th Eebruary the Resident was instructed to proceed to Bahrein and with the support of His Majesty's ships Fox, Sphipx, and Redbreast to take the necessary steps to enforce compliance with the demands of Government, which were : — (1) The expulsion or imprisonment of six of the ringleaders in the attack on the Persians. (2) The payment to the sufferers of compensation to the extent of rupees 2,000. (8) The formation of a special guard for the maintenance of order in Manama. (4) The banishment of Sheikh Ali for a period of five years. (5) The abolition of 44 Sukhra ' or forced labour as far as the employes of foreigners are concerned. These terms were pr esented to the Sheikh in the form of an Ultimatum, and he was ^iven 24 hours within which to comply. During these 24 hours Sheikh Ali and his unruly followers, probably with the connivance of the Chief, managed to effect their escape during the night to the mainland of El Katr. The remaining demands were complied with by Sheikh Esa^ in such a way as to make any resort to force unnecessary, and a notification was§ Al )MlNlSTEATlOJr BEfORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL V.—^1 Has r a and El Katif. VI.—Koweit and Wejd. promulgated by him offering a reward of rupees 10,000 for the capture of Sheikh Ali. This closed the incident, ard reports which have been received towards the end of the year make it appear probable that Sheikh Ali will before long surrender himself. In view of the enhanced status of the Pritish representative, the Bahrein Agency has now been furnished with a Military Guard of 24 Native Infantry under a Native Officer. Sheikh Esa's second son, Sheikh Mahomed,and his Vazier, Abdur Rahman, proceeded on the Mecca pilgrimage during the year, and in the course of their travels paid a short visit to Cairo from Suez, where they were the guests of His Highness the Khedive. They spoke in most grateful terms of the kindness shown to them by His Excellency Lord Cromer. The roads between Katif and El Hassa have as usual been unsafe, and several cases of plundered caravans have been reported. The Turkish Government have leased the Ojair and El Hassa Customs for 572,000 piastres and those at Katif for 470,100 piastres, to the former lessee for one year, this being an increase of 10 per cent, on last year's lease. _ Captain S. G. Knox, Indian Army, assumed charge of the duties of Political Agent at Koweit on the 6th August, when the Agency was first established, and remained up to the end of the year. The past twelve months have been a somewhat critical period in the amphitheatre of Nejd politics, in which the Wahabi leader and the 'Amir of Nejd ' have continued to play the leading parts. In his report for 1903-1904 Colonel Kemball mentioned that Ibn Saood had considerably strengthened his position during the preceding year, and towards the close of it had gained a victory of some importance over Ibn Rashid's forces on the borders of the Kaseem district. This success he soon followed up, and in April 1904 placed to his credit another signal victory over an ally of Ibn Hashid's near Aneyza. Continuing his forward movement he then proceeded to attack Boreida, of which he gained possession with little difficulty in the month of June, in spite of assistance rendered to Ibn Rashid by a considerable force of Turkish troops from the Baghdad Vilayet. According to the reports received at the time the victorious Wahabi treated the conquered garrison of Boreida with no little magnanimity, which however was probably prompted by his inability to feed prisoners. He allowed them all to depart in peace and rejoin Ibn Rashid, merely depriving them of their arms. A month later a further action was reported at Thibiyeh, 15 miles beyond Boreida, in which Turkish troops were again engaged and were said to have suffered heavily. Many were taken prisoners and several of their field pieces captured. Abdur Rahman bin-Saood is believed to have received yeoman help at this time from Sheikh Jasim-bin-Thani of El Katr, who supplied him liberally with th« sinews of war ; and in October news was received and subsequently corroborated by eye witnesses who trickled into Koweit, that the Wahabi had gained a still further victory, and this time had completely broken up Ibn Rashid's force, notwithstanding that the latter was reported to have been assisted by a force of 2,500 Turkish soldiers with six field guns. A quantity of tents and other loot taken from the Turks in this encounter, which shortly afterwards arrived in Koweit, afforded corroborative evidence of the truth of the above report, as did also some Turkish refugee or captive soldiers, who told harrowing tales of the sufferings and privations which they had undergone and of the ravages of disease within their ranks. Meanwhile at the end of 1904, apparently at the suggestion of the newly appointed Wali of Bussorah, who now seemed to realise that his Government had staked their money on the wrong horse, the Sublime Porte decided upon a complete change of policy, the basis of which was the abandonment of Ibn Kashid and the conciliation of the victorious Wahabi. To this end His Excellency the Wali, with the permission no doubt of his august master, proceeded to make an offer to Abdur Rahman -bin-Sacod,RESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. 9 through his friend Sheikh Mubarak, to meet jmn at an appointed rendezvous with a view to their coming to an amicable understanding and arranging an adjustment of outstanding differences. It was a sine qua non to the proposed meeting that Sheikh Mubarak should be present. This offer was accepted by Ibn Saood, probably on Sheikh Mubarak's advice, but so sudden had been the change of attitude on the part of the Turks that the two Arab Chiefs evidently looked forward to the meeting with some misgivings and consequently elaborate precautions were taken by them to preserve their own dignity and at the same time to ensure their safety. In due course, however, the meeting or meetings, for there were two, took shape at or near Sefwan between Koweit and Bussorah on the 6th and 14th ifQbruary, respectively, and with apparently satisfactory results. From accounts which have since transpired as to what passed it appears that Ibn 8aood intimated his submission to the will of the bublime Porte and expressed his readiness to accept a position of general subordination to that Government and to admit small Turkish garrisons to Keaz and Kaseem, on the distinct understanding that, except for the above leaven of practical Turkish influence, he should be left in undisturbed possession of bis country and that the Porte should guarantee to keep in check his Jebel Shammar rival and to prevent him from ever again disturbing the peace or interfering in the politics of .Nejd. Sheikh Mubarak's functions at the interviews appear to have been simply those of an on-looker and referee. The latest reports received up to the close of the year were to the effect that the Mushir of Baghdad had started wath a considerable force to post the Turkish garrisons at Reaz and Kaseem, and it remains to be seen what will be the result of this measure. Now that the strife w r hich has been so long and so obstinately maintained between the two rival aspirants to the rulership of Nejd has for a time at all events ceased to prevail, a period of rest and peace may possibly be^ in stord for the country which will enable it to achieve some measure of internal prosperity; but this desirable end cannot be looked forward to with any great degree of confidence and there is a palpable reverse to the shield. Koweit affairs have for a long time past been so closely bound up with those of Nejd that when the history of JSTejd politics for the year has been chronicled, little of importance remains to be said regarding the affairs of Koweit itself, the daily life of which under the strong hand of Sheikh Mubarak are usually uneventful. As Sheikh Mubarak informed the Resident recently, the regular calling of the British India Steamers at the Port materially added to the prosperity of his territory and indeed the heavy cargoes carried there from time to time by the British India Steam Navigation Company's vessels demonstrate clearly enough that the trade of the Port is expanding considerably. Such statistics as Captain Knox has been able to collect form an appendix to this report. It may be mentioned in the same connection that the regular visits of fast mail steamers to Koweit have necessitated the verification and amplification of the charts of the harbour and approaches of the Port, and that this work has been carried out during the past cold season by the Royal Indian Marine Survey Steamer Investigator with the Sheikh's cordial co-operations and approval. Sheikh Mubarak complained a good deal during the early part of the year under report, of the harrassing attentions paid to Dhows fiying his flag by the Belgian Customs officials at Persian Ports. Mis complaints were especially loud when the Director-General of Customs, Bushire, patrolled the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab in the Muzaffer and devoted an unusual amount of attention to Koweit craft. On one occasion a party from the • steamer even fired on Sheikh Mubarak's private boom the Musallim as it entered Eao creek.w 10 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL VII.—Persian Arabistan. Vigorous protests immediately followed not only from Sheikh Mubarak, but also from the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Turkish authorities at JBussorah, and the experiment has not been repeated. In August and September during the date harvest there was considerable friction between the local Turkish officials at Pao and the Land Agent for Sheikh Mubarak's properties, and matters reached a crisis in October, when a cultivator and his wife employed on the Sheikh's gardens were shot dead by a party of Turkish soldiers. Owing to the energetic pressure from the Wali of Bussorah Sheikh Mubarak soon afterwards withdrew his Fao Agent, but in return for this no special redress was given him for the shooting of his retainers and the matter was allowed to drop. It will be singular, however, if the trouble does not raise its head again during the coming date harvest.. Kovoeit currency currency of Koweit has been and is a frequent source of trouble, as it is also at Maskat, the standard being the Maria Theresa dollar, the exchange vagaries of which are most prejudicial to the interests of trade. Copper is represented by the Indian pice, and Turkish Liras, Indian rupees and Persian krans all circulate freely, but their exchange value is referred to the ever-changing dollar. Lieutenant D. L. R. Lorimer, Indian Army, was Vice-Consul at Ahwaz, and Mr. W. McDouall, Consul at Mohammerah, throughout the year. The Azem-es-Sultaneh was appointed Governor of Arabistan in succession to the Salar-ed-Dowleh, whose deputy he formerly was. He arrived at Shusbter early in July. The Dizful-Khoremabad road has been extremely insecure throughout the year, and it was significant that in April, when the Sagwand Lurs were leaving the Dizful district for their summer quarters, they migrated by the Pusht-i-Kuh route instead of going by the direct road towards Khoremabad. Matters seemed to improve, however, and in the autumn Lieutenant Lorimer entered into negotiations at Dizful with a friendly and influential Mir of the Sagwand Lurs and was able to obtain through him a guarantee of safe conduct by the Kialan route to Khoremabad, where he was to meet Colonel Douglas, Military Attache at Tehran, and return with him to Dizful by the same road. All went well on the outward journey, and Lieutenant Lorimer arrived safely at Khoremabad, but not finding Colonel Douglas there went on towards .burujird and meeting him about eiirht miles short of that town turned back with him towards Khoremabad. On arrival there, having received apparently satis factory assurances of their safe conduct back to Dizful, the two officers left Khoremabad and falling in with their Lur escort at Shah-i-Shah, camped that night at Chimashk and left next day for the Port of Kila-i-ISasri. Here an attempt was made by their escort to blackmail them, and in the course of a heated argument, during which the attitude of the Lurs was very threateninsr, Lieutenant Lorimer saw one of them entering his tent apparently for purposes of robbery. On his running to stop him the Lur closed with him and a scuffle ensued during which a shot was fired and then the two officers were set upon and attacked. Lieutenant Lorimer received a bullet through the hand and had his jaw badly injured by a heavy stone hurled at him, and Colonel Douglas, who came to his assistance, was shot through the right fore arm above the wrist, both bones of it being fractured. The two wounded officers havjng thus been put out of action^ were then robbed of everything they had, and after being provided with a few tins of their own stores, and three broken-down ponies, were hustled off towards Khoremabad whither they arrived after much suffering and exposure and thence made their way to Burujird. Here they fortunately found Lientenant Williams, LM.S., Surgeon to the Kermanshah Consulate, and Dr. Punk, of the American Mission, who dressed their wounds which had now gone eight days without ^ being attended to. It was by this time the 6th November^ and not till, the beginning of Pebruary was Lieutenant Lorimer able to return to his post at Ahwaz, travelling via Baghdad. A substantial indemnity has been demanded from the Persian Government for this outrage, together with the punishment of the tribe implicated. AnRESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. 11 expedition started from Kermansliah in January for the latter purpose under His Highness the Farman Tarma, Governor of Khurdistan, and is still in progress, but so far has achieved no practical result, as his force is apparently not sufficiently strong for the accomplishment of the purpose in view. The waterway between Ahwaz and Shushter has been from time to time most insecure owing to the inadequate arrangements made by the Persian Government for the patrolling of the river bank, and Messrs. Lynch have in consequence been repeatedly obliged to suspend the running of their steamer the Shushan above Ahwaz. On one occasion she was actually attacked by a gang of some 30 Arab robbers, and two female passengers were killed and one wounded. Had it not been for the courageous attitude adopted by the Commander of the vessel, the pirates would no doubt have got possession of her, but as it turned out they were baulked of their object and suffered severely themselves, one of their number, believed to be the Chief, being shot dead. Eor a short period previous to the arrival of the Azem-es-Sultaneh as Governor, during ^hich the policing of the river was entrusted to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, the work was most satisfactorily carried out and a considerable measure ot security was the result, but immediately the arrangements were taken out of Sbiekh Khazal's hands, matters relapsed into their former insecure state, and the running of the steamer had to be suspended. Latterly the arrangements have been more effective, however, and in January she began to run again. There were severe epidemics of cholera at Ahwaz, Dizful and Shushter during the hot weather. The disease appeared in June, and it was not until October that it died out. The Hutch Engineer Monsieur Van Eoggen returned to Ahwaz in November and has been testing the rise and fall of the river and making other investigations in connection with the scheme which he is putting before His Majesty the Shah for the irrigation of Arabistan. Messrs. Lynch regard the scheme with some apprehension, as they consider it likely to impair the navigation of the Lower Karun. Authentic news was received in Eebruary of the sudden death of the Ilkhani of the Bakhtyaris, the Sardar -i-Muffakham, at Malimir. This is the second Ilkhani who has died within a year. Authoritative information has not yet been received as to who has been elected to succeed him. Captain H. A. K. Gough, Indian Army, was appointed to this ^wly vnr- opened Consulate in K/urdistan. He arrived from India in May, and travelling Shiraz and Tehran reached Kermanshah on 5th July. Lieutenant T. S. B. Williams, I.M.S., on appointment to Kermanshah as Consular Surgeon, arrived at his destination via Bahgdad on 9th July. Captain Gough remained on deputation at Urmia through the greater part of the year, on special duty, and during his absence Mr. Eahino, of the Imperial Bank and subsequently Lieutenant Williams held charge of the Consulate. The latter was deputed in January to accompany the Earman Earma and watch the operations taken by him against the Dira^wand Lurs and the close of the year found him camped at Burujird with the Governor. Mr. George Grahame held the post of Consul at Shiraz throughout the year. Shiraz.—1h.e Ala-ed-Dowleh having been recalled to Tehran on 21st Eebruarv 1904, Ears remained without a Governor-General until the end ot June, when His Imperial Highness the Shua-es-Sultaneh arrived from the capital on re-appointment and has remained throughout the year. ^ The early part of the year was a very unfortunate one for Shiraz. There was an epidemic of measles to begin with, and this was followed m July by the visitation of cholera dealt with in a previous paragraph of this report. Owing to the restrictions necessarily imposed in Shiraz against caravans from the Bushire side at the beginning of the cholera epidemic, the traffic was at first much dislocated, and subsequently ceased altogether as soon as the12 ADMINISTRATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN SULP POLITICAL mfeotion reached Shiraz, for its arrival was quickly followed by a general exodus of the Persian community which was maintained until the end of August, when the town was declared free from disease. t -oP e f sistent l ev y 0 f Rahdari dues in one form or another in the province ot Jars has been a constant cause of complaint during the year, and the matter has the attention of His Majesty's Legation. The opium crop in and around Shiraz sufPered a good deal from the severe cold winch was experienced this winter, but fortunately the damage done is likely to be more than counterbalanced by the fulness of other crops. Zingah'—It was found, when the divers returned from the pearl banks, that their take during the season was only f that of last year and that the average prices fetched were about 25 per cent. loss. In January 1904 two inhabitants of the Island of Sirri, who were passen gers rrom Shargah on the pirate coast in a Dhow belonging to Kishm, over powered the crew and shot them and their fellow-passengers dead, except one small boy, who saved himself by jumping overboard. Among the murdered men was a Xhoja British subject. In T f0rniati0n 0f tlie niurder reached the Deputy Governor of Lingah through the small boy referred to who had managed to gain the shore unhurt, and the two culprits were thus traced and subsequently arrested. As they were now in Persian custody and in Persian territory, the Local government were asked to have their punishment carried out without prejudice to the question of the ownership of Sirri Island. To this the Persian Govern ment agreed, and His Excellency the Darya J3egi was instructed to have the murderers taken out to. sea and drowned. In the meanwhile, however, they had been allowed to escape by their guard at Lingah. One has now been re-arrested and put to death in the manner ordered; the other is still at large. The Customs Administration reduced the salaries of some of their emploves at Lingah owing to decrease in the revenue of the Port. In this connection the cash receipts for the six months ending 22nd September were reported to amount to about 45,000 rupees, as against 56,000 realised for the c )rrespondino- period last year. 0 The Vice-Consulate at Bunder Abbas has now been raised to a Consulate. ^ Bunder Abbas. Captain A. P. Trevor, held charge of the post from the begmmng of the year up to tne month of August, when he took up the duties or i^irst Assistant Resident at Bushire. Lieutenant Sliakespear, who was appointed to succeed him, did not arrive till 20th November. During this interregnum on 21st October, the British Commercial Mission about to tour m Persia arrived in Bunder Abbas and, in the absence of a British Consular representative, had to put up with much obstruction from the Local Customs representative, which was only withdrawn after considerable A e il grap i 1C corres P ondence - every important place visited except Bunder Abbas they were treated with much courtesy and attention. The Belgian oJacial, who was responsible for what occurred, has since been transferred. , Ma i or p - M - Sykes, C.M.G., continued to hold the office of His Britannic Majesty s Consul, Kerman, until a few days before the close of the year when he proceeded to officiate as Consul-General at Meshed during the absence of Colonel Minchin. In May 1904 Monsieur Miller arrived as Consul for the Eussian Government. His Highness Zaher-es-Sultan was again appointed Governor. The most important event which occurred within the scope of the Kerman consulate was the advent of the Commercial IMission to Kerman and Eastern ersia under the Presidency of Mr. Arthur Gleadow-Newcomen representing piimari y the Upper India Chamber of Commerce, with whom were associated r ; • • Luffman as Assistant Delegate and Mr. P.

It was at first intended that after dealing with Kerman the Mission should travel to Bampur and thence via Ma gas and Kuhakto Gwadur, but on turther consideration it was decided that after vidting Khabis, Bam and Jiruft the party should return to Kerman and proceed thence to Yezd, Shiraz and Bushire. At the end of the year under report the members of the Mission accom panied by Mr. Grahame, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Shiraz, were on the road between Yezd and the Capital of Ears, and hitherto had had a successful tour. Kerman suffered from epidemics of small-pox and cholera during the year. The former raged for some weeks in September, and in October was followed by an outbreak of cholera, but happily the visitation was a mild one and soon died out. The frontier meeting which took place at the beginning of the year for the settlement of frontier claims, met with a considerable measure of success and there is good reason to hope that the meeting now in progress for the current year will be still more productive. Eorty-six slaves were freed during the year. x J;'~® lav0 There has of late been a regrettable increase in the export of Mekrani slaves to the opposite shore of the Gulf, both to the coast of Oman and that of the Trucial Chiefs. Every effort is made to trace and rescue them when heard of, but it is exceedingly difficult to place any effective check on their import as long as adequate measures are not taken on the Persian side to stop their export. Representations made by His Majesty's Minister to the Central Government have not as yet had any appreciable effect. In March the Besident visited the small community of freed negroes voluntarily domiciled at Bassidu, and found them quite contented with their lot. Not one of them was willing to leave the station. They have built themselves huts within our limits and many of them cultivates small plot of ground, and if their means are small and their life frugal, they are at all events free from any sort of worry and oppression. No trace has been discovered of the Arabs who perpetrated the piracy on Xll—Piracies. the Karachi sailing vessel mentioned in last year's report, and the efforts of His Britannic Majesty's Consuls at Mohammerah and Bussorah in this direction have been barren of result. In August the pirate Ahmed bin Selman seized a boat with its crew at Sefwa near Katif, and proceeded to sea. He first took ©2,380 from a boat belonging to Saeed bin Mahomed El Mehanadi of Khor Shagig in Katr, off Eas Eakan. He next plundered a Persian boat laden with melons. A British man-of-war was on duty at Bussorah during the date season as usual and nothing untoward occurred during that time, but later several instances of piracy occurred. Thus in December some pirates boarded a boom off Katif, killed three of the crew and carried off $200. The following morning the authorities at Katif sent soldiers in search of the marauder#. They brought in three men from Tarooth and two men from Anaaz, all of whom were imprisoned. As a sequel to this outrage, a Persian boat from Tangistan crossed over to Katif to wreak vengeance on the pirates who had murdered their countrymen. They attacked a Harein boat on the high seas, killed eight men and then left for their country. Pour minor cases of piracy occurred in or near the Shatt-el-Arab—two on Bahrein and two on Koweit boats. There seems to be little falling-off in this traffic.

Any authentic news received of the clearing of native craft for Mekran with arms has been communicated forthwith to the Belgian Customs, who have now Agents at many points on the Coast, and a few arms have indeed been captured by them, but only a very small portion of the quantity that must have entered the country. Owing to the severe outbreak of cholera at Shiraz and the imminent prospect of an epidemic which for some months existed at Bushire, the Resident was not able to proceed to Shiraz for the summer as usual. At the end of September, however, he was permitted to take au extended tour vid Shiraz, Ispahan and the Bakhtyari mountains into Arabistan. Erom Shiraz onwards he was accompanied by Mr. Grahame, Consul at Shiraz, and at Ispahan joined forces with Consul-General Preece for the journey down the Lynch road to Ahwaz. Since his return in November the usual cold weather tours in R.T.M.S. Lawrence in the Gulfs of Persia and Oman have been carried out, but call for no special comment. The following ships of His Majesty's Navy visited the Gulf during the year: II. M. S. Fox, Merlin, Sphinx, Lapwing, For poise and Redbreast. Major P. Z. Cox, C.T.E., has.been Resident since the 25th April, when on arrival from Europe he took over charge from Lieutenant-Colonel C. A. Kemball, C.I.E., on the latter's departure on furlough. Captain S. G. Knox, Indian Army, was Eirst Assistant until 5th August, when, on being deputed to Koweit, was succeeded by Captain A. P. Trevor, Indian Army, from Bunder Abbas. Captain De Vere Condon, I.M.S., continued to discharge the duties of Residency Surgeon throughout the year. There were no changes among foreign representatives during the year.

During the year under review very few serious intertribal quarrels have p^^g 1 taken place in Oman and the general peace has been a welcome source of satis faction to the Ruler, who is accustomed to find the resources at his command insufficient to maintain order much less tranquility throughout his dominions. Of such disturbances as have taken place the following are the most serious (1) Enmity between the Ghafiri and Hinavi tribes inhabiting Nakhl and Wadi Ma'aval produced various small conflicts during the earlier part of the year. In June, however, Sheikh Rashid bin Azaiz, who has frequently been mentioned in these reports as one of the Sultan's most trusted Lieutenants, succeeded in effecting between them a peace which practically lasted until the end of the year. (2) Towards the end of September a troop of the A1 Wahibeh, a lawless and warlike tribe of Bedouins of the Hinavi section, while on a plundering excursion in the neighbourhood of Ghor, a town on the borders of ^aalan and the Sharkiya, encountered a party of the Beni Bu Ali tribe and a somewhat sanguinary conflict resulted. Prom among the opposing sides 26 men were killed and wounded, the former including a son of the Beni Bu Ali Chief, Abdullah bin Salim. It was feared that in revenge for his son's death Abdullah bin Salim might be led to wage war on a more lavish scale than usual, but he appears to have contented himself with (as was generally supposed) contriving for the assassination of a Sheikh of the A1 'Wahibeh tribe in the neigh bourhood of Maskat some months later. (3) On November 29th a serious encounter took place at Semmed between two sections of the Habus tribe in which a dozen men were killed or wounded. Sheikh Isa bin Saleh A1 Harthi, who happened to be in Semmed at the time, intervened and arranged a truce between them, which subsequently developed into a lasting peace. A further mention of Sheikh Isa is necessary when dealing with the inter nal politics of Oman. The father of this Chief was a most malignent enemy of His Highness the Sultan, and, as is well known, headed the famous insurrec tion of 1895 against his rule. Rightly or wrongly Sayyid Pai^al credits the sons with having inherited their father's enmity towards him and is in constant dread of another organised revolt headed by the eldest. Sheikh Isa. It is somewhat remarkable that all the latter's principal actions during the past year have been, like that referred to above, in the interests of law and order. His Highness is of opinion that Isa is only waiting for sufficient power and a favourable opportunity to make himself objectionable. Whether this is so or not remains to be seen. 2. The dominions of His Highness the Sultan were visited during ^ ie -Cai^nSies summer by an extremely severe epidemic of cholera which spread from town to town and district to district with extraordinary rapidity. Prom a large number of places it was found impossible to obtain statistics, but there seems no doubt that over fourteen thousand persons perished in the Wadis of Rustak, Semail and Ma'aval, the Batineh Coast ports and the environs of Maskat alone. In Maskat only 43 and in Mattrah but 12 cases occurred, the escape of these towns is largely attributable to the energy and promptness with which the Agency Surgeon instituted quarantine stations, the willing assistance rendered to him by His Highness the Sultan and his officials, and the calm and sensible manner in which the majority of the people submitted to the annoyance of detention when it was necessary. It is worthy of mention that no disturbance18 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL worthy of the name occurred in any of the quarantine stations throughout the epidemic. Tires occurred, as usual, now and then during the hot weather in Maskat and Mattrah, in the most severe of which on 30th May at Mattrah some 400 houses were burnt, three lives were lost, and property to the value of twenty thousand dollars was destroyed. On 25th October a gunpowder explosion took place at Mattrah in which five men were killed and 13 injured. Cxistoms. 3. General—The Customs administration has been carried on during the year without any change in the methods adopted when His Highness took the management into his own hands. No complaint of any importance has been received from British subjects in this connection, and the treatment of merchants generally is satisfactory, but from a financial point of view there is still much to be desired in the conduct of affairs. The Customs office is frequently in debt to merchants owing to sudden demands being made upon it by His Highness which have to be met by requesting merchants who are expecting consignments, to pay something in advance. This state of things is not likely to improve, particularly as a decrease in the demand for arms and ammunition has already made its appearance. The Customs revenue at Soor shews no increase. The reasons for the unsatisfactory position at this town ha^e frequetitly been touched upon in previous reports ; it is hoped that the settlement of the Trench Flag difficulty, which happily is shortly to be expected, will to a large extent remove the deadlock which it is estimated causes a loss of revenue to the Local Government of no less than sixty thousand dollars per annum. The Customs arrangements at Gwadur have been fairly satisfactory throughout the year. Arms traffic. It will be remarked that there has been an enormous increase in this branch of trade during the year and large profits have been made chiefly by certain foreign firms. It is supposed that the large majority of arms sold during the past year were exported to Koweit, small quantities having probably been smuggled into Persia and the Mekran Coast. The demand now shows signs of decreasing and the figures for next year will probably be very low. Eain. 5. Good rain has fallen in Oman during the past cold weather, and it is hoped that the drought of the last few years has come to an end. Government 6. The new quarters for the Agency Surgeon, and Telegraph and Consular ui mgs. clerks have been completed and the small house situated between the latter and the Customs premises has been acquired by Government during the past year. The sea wall in front of the Consulate has been extended to the Customs wharf, whereby adequate protection against heavy seas has been given to the whole premises, and a certain amount of land % has been reclaimed. The premises of Mr. J. S. de Mello consisting of his own house, and the lines of the Sepoy Guard attached to the Political Agency have also been purchased. Slave Trade. Owing to His Majesty's ships having been employed throughout the year on other duties no capture of slave dhows was effected. It is believed that the trade formerly carried on between Oman and the neighbourhood of Zanzibar has received a check, no doubt owing in a great measure to the salutary lessons which have recently been administered to persons participating therein. With regard to the large capture of slave traders made by the Portuguese cruiser San Rafael in March 1902, news was received by the Political Agent in July last for communication to His Highness the Sultan, to the effect that the culprits had been sentenced by the Protuguese Courts to 25 years imprison ment. His Highness received this information with composure, and asked that his thanks might be expressed to Government for the trouble they had taken in making enquiries. No less than 105 slaves took refuge at the Political Agency during the year. Of these six were found not to be entitled to freedom, four left the Agency permises while their cases were still under discussion, and theEESIDENCY AND MASKAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR THE YEAR 1904-1905. 19 % remaining 95 were giving manumission papers in the usual manner. Of this number 85 were Africans, for whose! disposal the usual arrangements were made, and 60 were either Persians or Baluchis who had been exported from Jask and certain Mekran ports to Sohar and other places on the Batineh Coast. In connection with this latter traffic strong measures have been and are being taken by His Highness the Sultan to deal effectively with such of his subjects as have been concerned in it. The chief offender on this side appears to have been one Jemadar Abdullah, the Commander of His Highness's garrison at Sohar, who was in league with certain Persians at and near Jask. This Jemadar has recently undergone a period of imprisonment in Maskat on this account, and has now, it is said, fled to Baluchistan ; while representations regarding the share taken by their subjects in the traffic have been addressed to the Persian Government. It is to be hoped that these representations will be renewed until they meet with some result as it is dfficult to deal successfully with a matter of this kind unless both parties co-operate heartily. 8. The great social event of the year in Maskat was the marriage of Sayyid Marriage of Taimoor, the Sultan's eldest son, to a daughter of Sayyid Ali-bin-Salim-bin- Taimoor. Thowayni, His Highness's cousin. This took place in December and was accompanied with general feasting and rejoicing among all classes and com munities. His Highness the Sultan entertained each community in Maskat and Mattrah separately as well as a number of visitors from outlying stations, and invited the European representatives and their families to dinner in honour of the occasion. Th§ Political Agent paid a special complimentary visit to the bridegroom during which he presented the congratulations of Government and a Silver Coffee and Tea Service as a token of their regard. 9. The event of the year which gave most trouble and anxiety both to Marine. His Highness the Sultan and to the Political Agent was the massacre of a boat's crew of the S. S. Baron Inverdale on Maseerah Island in August last. This unfortunate vessel, the property of Messrs. Hogarth of Glasgow, was on her way from Karachi to Aden and grounded on Kabbya Island, one of Kuria-Muria group, on the 2nd August. Three days later, the master, officers, and crew (with the exception of eight men who preferred to remain on board) with one boy passenger, embarked in two of the ship's boats, intending, it is believed, to cross over to Dhofar, and travel thence by land to Maskat or some other place of security. The total number of persons who left the ship appears to have been 23, of whom 17 embarked in the larger boat, and six in the smaller. These boats were not successful in reaching Dhofar, but were carried out to sea. The smaller of the two has never been beard of since, and was probably lost in the heavy monsoon sea which must have prevailed to compel the boats to alter their course. The larger boat journeyed on northwards, either under compulsion by the sea or with the hope of eventually reaching Maskat, and about the 15th August arrived off the Island of Maseerah. It is not known exactly what took place there, but in all probability the natives saw the boat coming and wished to plunder its contents, the occupants naturally objected, and a dispute ensued which culminated in the massacre of the boat's crew, and the confiscation by the Arabs of whatever money and supplies they found with them. It is certain that no person remained alive of the unfortu nate refugees. The first news of this tragic occurrence to reach Maskat was contained in a letter to His Highness the Sultan from Sheikh Isa-bin-Saleh (referred to in the commencement of this report), who stated that a rumour had reached him to the effect that 17 f&lt; Englishmen' had been massacred on Maseerah Island. This following upon a report which had reached to the Political Agent two or three days before (23rd August) regarding the wreck of the Baron Inverdale raised suspicions that the two events might be connected, and the Government of India were communicated with the result of which was that H. M. S. Lapwing was despatched from Karachi to the scene of the supposed crime, and H. M. S. Merlin was placed at the disposal of the Political Agent for a, visit to Maseerah Island in company with His Highness the Sultan. Neither expedition was productive of result, the matter was successfully concealed and both parties returned to Maskat, H. M. S. Lapwing on the 8th and H. M. S. Merlin on the 18th September without having gained20 ADMINISTRATION REPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL any further information. Letters, however, continued to arrive from the iQtenor giving details of the crime, and eventually His Highness the Saltan set off again in his steamer Nour-el-JBihr on the 26th September to make further investigations. After an absence of 12 days he returned having discoverd the matter, and bringing with him thirty prisoners, and a few relics of the murdered party. It appeared that during a house to house search in the village of Ras Half at the north end of the Island, the place mentioned in most of the letters as having been the scene of the murders, part of a mariner's jacket was found riddled with bullet holes and stained with bloid. The search party on finding this commenced making arrests on the spot and one discover? led to another. Eventually the party returned with 9 of the actual murderers and 21 of the chief residents of the Island including the Sheikh. Erom the prisoners statements it appeared that the actual murderers were 19 in number, 14 of which belonged to Ghafiri tribes and 5 to Hinavi. Of these 9 had escaped to the mainland, 1 was in hiding on the Island and could not be found, and 9 were in custody. The principal residents of the Island were imprisoned by His Highness for having hushed up the matter on the occasion of his first visit. On the return of the Nour-el-Bahr to Maskat the Government of India were communicated with at the Sultan's request, and the following proposals received sanction :— (1) That the murderers should be conveyed to the scene of the massacre for execution. (2) That the village of Has Half should be»burnt and all arms found in it should be confiscated. (3) That the principal residents referred to above should be imprisoned for a time. (4) That the Sheikh should be deported. (5) That the remaining murderers should be executed on arrest. (6) That His Highness should be asked to station a guard on Maseerah Island. The majority of these proposals have been carried out, but hitherto His Highness has found, it impossible to arrest the culprits who are still at large. It is considered, however, that a salutary lesson has been conveyed to the Arabs, and tnat they will deal differently with shipwrecked Europeans in future, MQvemeHDs of 10.

General remarhs. —A comparison of the statements of the import and export trade of Bushire for the years 1903 and 1904 compiled from Customs House Tariff and returns demonstrates that the gross imports show an increase of £19,022 and the exports of £88,315. Imports. —The increase in imports is due to an increase of £67,895 over 1903 in gold, silver, and nickel monies which, if deducted, would cause the import trade to show a decrease of £48,873. This would be consistent with the general aspect of the trade of Bushire for the year under revision. The decrease is mainly due to two causes, firstly, an epidemic of cholera which practically brought trade to a stand-still for some three to four months of the year, and, secondly, to the generally dull state of the markets in the interior. Tea, —The returns show a decrease in this article of some £3,000, but this is mainly due, I am led to understand, to the high duty levied under the new Customs Tariff on more expensive teas and, therefore, cheaper qualities are imported. There is also go^d reason to believe that the high duty on this article has been a great incentive to the smuggling of the commodity through the ^numerous small ports along the neighbouring coast. Exports. —Exports, excluding specie, show an increase of £74,801, the amount being principally made tip by the following :—Drugs and medicines, almonds and pistachios, gum, opium, skins undressed and raw cotton, which were exported to India and Persian Gulf Ports, England, India and Germany England and China, India and Prance, England, India and Russia, respectively'. Wheat. —Owing to the imposition of an embargo and a somewhat scanty crop practically none of this was exported during the year. Vegetable substances. —The decrease in vegetable substances is mainly due to the fact that rose-water was in 1903 calculated under the heading of vegetable substances and in 1904 under that of drugs and medicine. Exchange. —London exchange fluctuated from Krans 56 to 62J per £ sterling, and Bombay exchange from Krans 376^ to 417J per El00. This was due chiefly to the cessation of all export from the north of Persia to Russia and the consequent difficulty of purchasing exchange as cover for sales. Freights. —For the first nine months freights to the United Kingdom were steady at shillings 27-6 and for the last three months at shillings '60 per ton. Outward freights were about shillings 35 and those to and from India R10. Transport. —Normal transport rates averaged throughout the year from Krans 85 to 90 per hundred maunds, but during the three months of the cholera epidemic transport at any price was-unobtainable. The Customs. —Although the Customs regulations in many details are quite unsuited to the peculiar local conditions holding in Bushire and other Gulf ports, they are, as applied gradually, becoming better understood by the mer cantile community. The fact remains, however, that the enforcement of the multitudinous pro visions of the Reglement taken in conjunction with the working of the existing landing and porterage system under which the Hamal Bashi or transport agent, though theoretically the servant of the consignees, is practically the nominee and employe of the Customs House, continues and will continue to generate a good deal of friction both between the steamship companies and the consignees, and between these two bodies and the Customs Administration. Moreover, the expenses, liabilities and losses from damage, etc., have according to the statements of the mercantile community increased from 20 to 30 per cent, since the introduction of the new Tariff and the Reglement Douanier, all of which causes tend to retard the progress of the trade of the22 ADMINISTEATION EEPORT ON THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL south, a large portion of which (67 per cent.) conies from the United Kingdom and India. Small Traders. —It is found that the new Customs Tariff (with its numer ous rules) has hit the small trader in miscellaneous articles much harder than it has the bigger merchants. The many petty expenses, stamps, and fees which when distributed over a big consignment add an infinitesimal amount to the original cost, when incurred in regard to small consignments make a very appreciable difference. To the above considerations we ha Ye to add the fact that the rigorous and inelastic principles on which steamship companies conduct their business seem to allow very little scope or discretion to their local agents for the extension of that specially considerate treatment to the petty trader which is so^ essential to his prosperity, and the result is that the present lot of this community, many of whose members hail from British India, is by no means a prosperous one. There is even some reason to fear that they are being gradually driven out of the place, owing to the increasingly poor prospects presented to them by exist ing conditions in Bushire. Advice to shippers.—It is very necessary that all shippers should as far as possible do their best to comply with the Customs regulations before despatch ing tbeir goods, and to this end it would be advisable for them to study the Eeglement Douanier. The principal points to be borne in mind are as follows:— (1) Invoices must be carefully and cowectly made out showing the exact net and gross weight of article despatched, place of origin, cost, and description. (2) Such invoices should be despatched in time to reach their agent or consignee before the arrival of the goods in Bushire so as to enable the consignee to make out correctly the very precise declaration form, etc., required from him by the Customs House, The adoption of this procedure will save much extra time, trouble, and expense. Advice to Steampship Companies. —Steamship companies would also do well to study the Eeglement Douanier, and where possible endeavour to adapt themselves a little more than they seem to do at present to the peculiarities of the port, its harbour. Customs regulations and landing conveniences. It is important too that they should show increased consideration for the cargo of the consignee. As it is, there seems to be a tendency on the part of steamship companies to embellish their already amply safe-guarded Bills of Lading by the addition of diverse rubber stamp adornments embodying extra charges or extra conditions calculated to free them from every conceivable form of respon sibility in respect of cargo handled. Consignees are thereby placed in a very helpless position, and there is much doubt whether such an over-cautious policy is not likely to prove as prejudicial in the long run to the interests of the carrying agents as it certainly is to those of importers. Shipping.—One hundred and fifty-eight (158) steamers with a tonnage of 180,667 have entered and 100 steamers with a tonnage of 106,178 cleared the port of Bushire, showing a decrease of 1 steamer and 14,625 tons in tonnage under entrance and 11 steamers and 10,187 tons in tonnage under clearance. Pour (4) with a tonnage of 6,012 tons were under the Eussian flag. R. A.
