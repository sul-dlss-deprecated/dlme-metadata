The correspondence in this file concerns a request from the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] for Rashid's deputation to be extended beyond May 1951. Also discussed is the level of seniority that should be accorded to Rashid when he returns to service in Pakistan (prior to partition Rashid opted for service with the Government of Pakistan).Notable correspondents include the following: Frederick Charles Leslie Chauncy, Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Government of Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Mohammad Abu Rashid, Director-General of Customs in the Sultanate of Muscat and Oman; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman.All the material in the file is dated 1951, with the exception of one item, a notice received from the Government of India's Public Service Commission in Bengal, which is dated 25 June 1940.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of Muscat and Oman, Director-General of Customs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Ministry of Foreign Affairs</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Employment</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d2#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d2#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
