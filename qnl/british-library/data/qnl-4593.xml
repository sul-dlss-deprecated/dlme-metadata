Lieutenant -Colonel Miles' resume of the leading events at Muscat and in Oman during the past official year forms the second part of this Administration Report. 2 Colonel Miles' tour in Her Majesty's Ship Dragon round the south-eastern coast of Oman in December deserves notice as having been a voyage of great interest and utility. A portion of the report on the subject is reproduced as Appendix A to Part II. 2.—PIRATE COAST OF OMAN. 3. The past year has been uneventful for this part of Oman. 4 The Jovvasimi Chief Hameyd-bin-Abdullah continues to rule this town and district. An unimportant raid was made by a party of the Ras-el -Khaimah. Monasir into a district of Ras-el-Khaimah in May Subsequently this quarrel was made up by the mediation of the Chiefs of Debay and Shargah. In June a shock of earthquake was felt at Ras -el-Khaimah. 5. The Chief of this township, Ahmed-bin-Abdullah, of the tribe Al-bu-Ali, having sent presents to the Sultan of Zanzibar, received in return a Umm-el-Kawain. quantity of gunpowder and lead and some clothing. 6 Chief Rashid -bin-Hameyd, Al-bu-Ali. During the pearl-fishing season (June 1884) an Ejman boat was attacked and fired on by one Seif-el- Ejman. Adham, who resides on the island of Sirri, and who had Dreviouslv behaved in a turbulent manner. The offence, which constituted a breach of the maritime truce, having been clearly proved. Her Majesty's Ship Philomel Proceeded with the Residency Agent for the Arab coast to Sirri, and burned the boat of Seif-el-Adham in a public manner. 7. The new Chief of Shargah, Sakar-bin-Khalid, has continued in undisturbed possession. He renewed his request to the Resident that security for Shargah. g 00(i Saviour might be taken from the ex-Chief Salim- bin-Sultan, who continued to reside in the island of Boo Moosa, and who was likely, the Chief feared, to disturb the peace at sea. To this letter the Resident replied, referring Shaikh Sakar to the previous letter mentioned in paragraph 16 of the Annual Report for 1883-84. 8 The township of Himriyah is nominally a dependency of Shargah, but the Shargah Chief exercises hardly any real authority over the Chief of Himriyah. In April the Chief of Shar^ah invited Saif-bin-Abdul-Rahman, Chief of Himriyah, to visit Shargah, and on arrival of Saif the latter's brother, Muhammad, was sent to Himriyah to assume the office of Chief. Saif -bin-Abdnl-Rahman immediately returned to Himriyah and expelled his brother from the place. 9 Some disturbances, as is common, occurred in the districts of the Batinah coast, nomi- nally subject to Shargah. Hamad -bin-Abdullah, Chief of Fajeyrah, attacked the towns of B6 ADMINISTE ATT ON EEPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL Ghareyfa and Bishna, on which the men of Zobarah marched to the aid of Bishna. Hamad- bin-Abdullah then attacked Zobarah, plundering it and killing about twelve of the inhabitants. Hamad on bis side lost eight men. Ghareyfa and Bishna both fell into the hands of Hamad- bin-Abdullah. 10. In May the Government Agent reported that a moollah, residing at Shargah, named Hoosain -bin-Temeem, was busying himself in favour of the soi-disant Mahdi of the Soudan, advisin- the people of Shargah to join the Mahdi at Mecca, and causing some excitement amongst them. The Agent was instructed to take no notice of the moollah's sayings, but to caution the Chief of Shargah that he would be held responsible for any annoyance befalling British subjects ensuing on such meddlesome attempts at agitation. 11. In October, a person calling himself Ahmed-bin-Muhammad, Saif-el-Islam, and repre senting' himself to be a Shereef of Sana, visited the pirate coast ports and distributed some presents of armour, shields, &amp;c. It was thought that he was an emissary of the Mahdi. 12. The Chief of Debay, Hashar-bin-Maktoom, Al-bu-Falasa, received a visit from Nasir -bin-Mubarik, the Bahrain Sheikh, now residing in I)eba y- El-Katr. Nasir was accompanied by the headmen of the Beni-Hajir and Monasir tribes of Katr, and his object was to effect a reconciliation between the Oman and Katr Bedouins. 13. In July some Debay men left for the Red Sea, giving out that they intended joining the Mahdi if he turned out to be the predicted prophet. 14. Sheikh Zaid-bin-Khalifah, Chief of Abu Dhabbi and head of the Beni Yas, is the most powerful and influential of the pirate coast Abu DhabM. Ch;efs _ 15. In return for three horses presented to the Sultan of Muscat, Sheikh Zaid received a sum of Rs. 2,250 and a present of cloth. 16. During the year the Abu Dhabbi districts were undisturbed. 17. The various Chiefs on the pirate coast behaved on the whole in a satisfactory manner; but the Chief of Debay laid himself open to censure by allowing newly- run slaves from Africa to be landed and sold at his port. The steps taken in the matter will be mentioned under the head of 'Slavery/' 3.—BAHRAIN. 18. Many successive years of tranquillity and security have, as might be expected, brought increase of wealth and prosperity to these islands. The past year was no exception; and although the date crop suffered somewhat from unfavourable condition of weather, commerce was active and the pearl banks yielded a good return. 19. The security of the seas was maintained, and the rulers of Bahrain preserved friendly relations with all their neighbours. Presents were exchanged between Sheikh J Eesa-bin-Ali and Sheikh Jasim of El-Bida, and the Na'eem tribe continue in close friendly relations with the Bahrain Chiefs. 20. Sheikh Ahmed-bin-Ali, brother of the Chief, visited Busrah in September. He had intended to go to Kowait, but gave up that trip. 21. A communication having been received from the Resident at Aden, mooting the question of the release of Sheikh Muhammad-bin-Khalifah, the Resident consulted Sheikh 'Eesa personally on the subject, and found that the Chief was entirely opposed to such a step, and considered it would lead to disturbance of the peace of his islands. 4.—NEJD, EL-HASA, EL-KATR. 22. For some years a desultory warfare has been carried on from time to time between the Wahabi Amirs and the Amir of Hayel or Jebel Shamar, Muhammad-bin-Rashid. These hostilities seem to have on the whole resulted favourably for the Shamar Chief. Some reports attributed his success to the possession of a number of Martini rifles, but according to all recent travellers the organization of the Shamar is superior. 23. About May last, reports came to the effect that Abdullah-ibn-Feysal, the Riadh Amir, had made overtures to the Shamar Chief, which the latter was disposed to listen to, provided Abdallah s nephew, Muhammad-bin-Su'ood, were a party to the proposed peace. TheRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-85. latest news received is that Abdallah-bin-Su'ood was deputed by bis uncle and brothers to neo-otiate terms of peace with Muhammad-ihn-Rashid, and that the principle of tth possidetis had been accepted by both sides and presents exchanged. The intelligence still requires confirmation. _ i • t i. • ^ 24. Sa'eed Pasha has continued to govern this district El -Hasa. on the part of the Porte, and appears to do so with marked ability. 25. A robbery was committed in August by a gang of Beni Hajir on a boat belong- ino« to El-Katr whilst lying at anchor at El-Kateef. Some of the Beni Hajir tribe were arrested. 26 In March 1884 it was reported that several hoats of Bahrain bad been impressed tor convevance of Turkish soldiers from Ojair to Ras Tanoorah. The complaint having been sub- mitted by the Political Agent in Turkish Arabia to Constantinople, the Government of the Porte denied the truth of the report, on which Her Majesty's Ambassador desired to be furnished with additional proof, so as to be able to convince the Porte of the truth of the allegation. Further depositions of eye-witnesses, attested by a Kadhi, were according y furnished in July. 27. The case of a boat belonging to a British Indian similarly impressed was also submit- ted, and the Political Agent at Baghdad endeavoured to induce the Wall o£ Baghdad to a 01 some compensation. 38 In April Nasir-bin -Mubarik wrote to the Resident, saying he was anxious to maintain friendly relations with the British Government and to act El-Katr. in accor( j a nce with their wishes, and expressing a desire to send a messenger toBushire. A reply was sent to the effect that the Resident would be happy to receive his messenger. In July the messenger, Khamees-bin-Jooma, arrived in Busline, and it turned out that Nasir-bin-Mubarik's request was that the Resident should obtain resti tution of his groves in Bahrain which were confiscated many y^rs ago. The Resident in formed Khamees that he declined to recommend this proposal to the Chief ot Bahrain. 29. In April a branch of the Beni Hajir raided the Katr coast, and killed the son ot Ali -bin-Rashid, Chief of Wakrah. 30. In May Sheikh Jasim of El-Bida wrote to the Resident, stating that he had resigned the Government of El-Bida and professing friendly sentiments. 31. In July the Residency Agent at Bahrain reported that Sheikh Jasim contemplated putting to sea with a force with a view to attacking some of the Beni Hajir residing at Zahran. A letter was addressed to Sheikh Jasim desiring him to abandon that intention. 82 The adherents of Sheikh Jasim in El-Katr had been for some time at enmity with the 'Aiman tribe of El-Hasa, and great fears were entertained of an attack being made by the 'Aiman on El-Bida. The 'Ajmau, however, abandoned their intention of attac ing a r, au proceeded to a watering station called Booueyzan between Katr and Oman. The Ajman were ioined by a branch of the A1 Morrah and some Bern Hajir hostile to tbe people of E - a r , total force was said to be 2,000. They were opposed at Booneyzan by a body of 1,2 Trabs composed of A1 Monasir and rival branches of A1 Morrah and Beni Hapr and a severe fight occurred, in which the 'Ajmau and their allies were completely defeated with heavy loss. As the victors were friends and partizaus of Sheikh Jasim, the latter was much elated. 33 It was expected that the 'Ajman would assemble in force in Hasa and attack Katr in view to retrieving their lost prestige and avenging themselves on their enemies, but hitherto no such attempt has been made. - . Sheikh Jasim sent a present of four horses to the Sultan o£ Muscat, and received some ammunition in return. 5.—EARS. 34. The arrangements for the administration of tbe province of Pars, described in para graphs 32 and 33 of the Annual Report for 1883-84, have remained unaltered. 35. Mirza Muhammad Khan, formerly Foreign Office Agent at Bushire, was, in May, appointed Foreign Office Agent for Sluraz. 36 The Shiraz districts have not been free from petty disturbances and robberies, which occurrences are owing to the slackness of the present Government of Pars. The province of8 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL Ears requires a firm and united administration^ and at present dissensions and ill-feeling exist amongst the members of the family clique, who share the central authority amongst them. The present administration of Fars compares unfavourably with that of former years when His Royal Highness the Motemid-ed-Dowlah was Governor General. 37. Sultan Muhammad Khan remains Eel-Khanee, and Darab Khan Eel-Begee of the Kashgai Eeliyats. 38. The Governor of Bushire, Muhammad Husain Khan, son of the Sahib Diwan, was Bushire. granted by the Shah the title of Motemin-el-Mulk. 39. The customs revenues of Bushire and its districts were managed by Muhammad Husain Khan, who is Agent of the Ameen-es-Sultan. 40. In April orders were received by the Customs Commissioner from the Ameen-es-Sultan forbidding him to accept receipts for payment of export duty on grain passed to foreign merchants or their agents by Governors of other ports of Ears or Arabistan. The Governors of Reeg, Deelam, &amp;c., were then told by the Government of Ears to avoid passing receipts for export duty, and to levy the amount under some other name, or in an indirect manner. The matter having been referred to H. M/s Minister, stringent orders were issued by the Persian Government to the Government of Ears to refund all duty levied in excess of 5 per cent, and refrain from exacting double duty in future. In August several such overpayments were refunded, but in spite of all orders and protests, British merchants still complain that in some form or other they are subjected to double export duty on grain purchased for them at outports. 41. In July an affray occurred at Bushire between Persian soldiers and some people of Dashti, who had come with the widow of Muhammad Khan, late Governor of Dashti. In this affray a few lives were lost. The blame rested with the officiating Governor of Bushire. 42. Aga Muhammad Mehdi, the ' Melek-et-Tujar, ' of Bushire, having returned from a tour in Europe, inaugurated some measures of a sanitary nature, and has also undertaken to build a sea wall, to prevent the sea from flooding the plain outside the walls of Bushire. 43. In October Mr. R. C. Keun, Consul-General for Holland, returned to Bushire, havin^ been absent for several years. 44. The coast between Bushire and Lingah has enjoyed quiet during the year. 45. Lingah suffered from great scarcity of water until the autumn, when heavy showers Lil '« ah - replenished the reservoirs. Several shocks of earthquake were felt, but no damage occurred from them. 46. The Arab Deputy Governor was Shaikh Yoosnf,* who was immediately under Muham- 7tr MU T &lt;1 T' r 5 '. mad Husain Khan ' Agent o£ the Amcen-es-Snltan, the Govern- ment of Lingah and also Bunder Abbass being still severed from Ears. 47. A violent gale of wind with heavy rain burst over Ungah on 24th February, destroyine and damaging many houses. J a 48. A quarrel occurred in March between the Chief of Lingah and the Chief of Charak which, after nearly resulting in hostilities, was settled by mediation. 49. Bunder Abbass has been for the most part governed by Muhammad Husain Khan Bunder Abbas personally, and his administration was satisfactory. Durino- his absence, however, the proceedings of his agents were much complained of. 50 - The Hindu community were much agitated at the conversion of a Hindu fakir to s am in Feb.nary and for some days they closed their shops. The case has been investio -ated on the spot, and the convert having been examined at Bushire, it appeared that his conversion s voluntary, and although there was strong suspicion of his having stolen valuables from the Hindu temple proof of this was not forthcoming. The conduct of the Persian author Ities was shewn to have been blameworthy, and at the Resident's suggestion Muhammad 6 '''- 1 '~ —- - «■- ^ 51.

The island of Kishm suffered from repeated shocks of earthquake, and it is reported that considerable changes have occurred in the soundings in the neighbourhoood of Kishm. On 20th May a very severe shock of earthquake caused the partial destruction of upwards of thirty villages and the death of 133 persons, mostly women and children. A large number of the inhabitants left Kishm and much distress existed. On hearing of this His Majesty the Shah granted a sum of 1,400 tomans towards the relief of destitute persons and repair of mosques. The current year's revenues were also remitted, and the new Governor, Shaikh Ibra him, prohibited from levying taxes. In order to make up for this the revenues of the salt mines of Kishm were assigned to the Governor. 6.—PERSIAN ARABISTAN. 54 The Ihtisham-es-Sultanah was removed from the Government of Arabistan, and the Muzaffir -ul -mulk, Governor of Burojird and Khoramabad, was appointed by H. R. H. Zil-es- Sultan, Governor of Burojird, Khoramabad, Luristan, and Arabistan. 55. Shaikh Muhammad, brother of Shaikh Mizal, Governor of Mohammerah, who had been detained at Ispahan, was released. 56. Shaikh Mizal entertains fears of being compelled, by large pecuniary demands, to withdraw from Muhammarah. 57. The Muzaffir-ul-mulk recently advanced towards Mohammerah with two Persian regiments, and many of the Arab Shaikhs were preparing to move into Turkish tenitoiy. 7:—PERSIAN BALUCHISTAN. 58. Sirteep Ibrahim Khan died early in the year, and it was reported that many Baluch who emigrated from fear of his oppression were returning to their native land. 59. &amp; The alleged murder of an Indian in Baho, referred to in paragraph 63 of last year's report, was further pressed on the Persian Government by Her Majesty's Minister, and orders were issued to the Governor of Kerman to use all endeavours to arrest the guilty peison and have him sent to Kerman. 60. In September the Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, reported that a man employed as a khalasi in an Indian vessel had been seized at Charbar and taken to Pareg. It appeared that the khalasi had formerly been a slave and had several years ago escaped to Kurrachee, and a Baluch, claiming to be his former owner, now reclaimed him. Meer Hotee, Chief of the district, being appealed to, justified the act, on which H. M. Minister at Teheran was asked to move the Persian Government in view to the release of the man. Ordors to the desired effect have been issued by the Governor of Kerman, and it is hoped the matter will soon be satis factorily settled. 61. Two Indian traders complained in autumn of having been plundered near Jalk, and orders were issued by the Governor of Kerman for strict inquiiy. 62. Disturbances have occurred between Rinds and people of the Baho district with loss of a few lives. The Rinds were primarily in fault. The Wali of Gwadur was asked to mediate, but the result is not yet known. 63 The Prince Nasir -ed-dowlah, Deputy Governor of Kerman, proceeded to Bampur and was met by all chiefs of Persi-Baluch districts. Several of the latter are reported to have been imprisoned and fined, but for what reasons is unknown. 64. An inquiry held by Colonel Miles and Colonel Reynolds into the Rind-Gwadur disputes terminated on 33rd March, 65. Mr. B. Ffinch, Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs, was re-appointed to Political charge of the Mekran Coast in August. 8.—BASSIDORE. 66 This station has continued in charge of a coal agent, and there is nothing of interest to report regarding it. The earthquakes so severely felt in other parts of Kishm island did no damage at Bassidore station. 9.—SLAVE TRADE. 67. In the year 1884 there was a marked increase of the slave traffic from Africa to Oman. 68. In May Colonel Miles reported that he had information that attempts would be made to run many cargoes of slaves from the African Coast, and His Highness Seyyid Toorkee in June10 ADMINISTEATION EE PORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITICAL issued a proclamation warning his subjects against transgressing the orders prohibiting this traffic. In October, on information being received of the landing of several large cargoes of slaves on the Batinah Coast, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee issued a fresh proclamation and addressed letters to all the Trucial Chiefs of Oman, asking them to seize all slaves brought by- Muscat people to their ports and to punish the importers. 69. In October the Government Agent at Shargah reported that 54 slaves had been landed at Debay, and that in spite of his protest the Chief of Debay had countenanced their sale at Debay. The Agent was instructed to demand the surrender of all freshly-imported Africans, and a letter was addressed to the Chief of Debay and all the Trucial Chiefs reminding them of their engagement to the British Government, and desiring the surrender of all slaves landed in their districts. Subsequently, Mr. Robertson, First Assistant Resident, proceeded to the Arab coast in H. M. S. Dragon and succeeded in recovering 21 slaves. Four more were afterwards sent on board H. M. S. Dragon by the Chief of Debay, who was made to pay dollars 70 a head for others he failed to produce, by way of fine. One slave boy was recovered at Shargah, one at Bahrain, and one at Umm-el-Kawain. 70. On the Persian coast near Lmgah an attempt was made to carry off three Africans residing at Bassidore, but through the exertions of the Government Agent at Lingah the Chief of Moghoo obtained their release. 71. The Political Agent at Muscat recovered and released one African kidnapped from Aden, and four other men, considered to have been imported of recent years, took refuge at the Muscat Consulate. It was thought due to the peculiar circumstances of their case to recommend their release and the indemnification of the alleged owners. 72. Two slavers were captured by Her Majesty^s Philomel, containing 205 Africans. chiefly women and children. The slave dealers captured were imprisoned by His Highness the Sultan. 73. Seyyid Toorkee was thanked by the Government of India for his friendly action regarding slave traffic. 74. Four fugitive slaves took asylum at the telegraph village at Jask, and subsequently got on board H. M. S. Dragon and were landed at Karachi. 10.—OFFICIAL CHANGES AND HER MAJESTY'S SHIPS. 75 - In Jul y the confidential news agent, Haji Abdul Nabi, died, and was succeeded at Bushire by his son, Aga Muhammad Rahim. duties 6 ' I)U11Ilg ^ m0nth 0f Septernber Mr - ;Robert son and Major Mockler exchanged 77.

ADMINISTRATION UEPOKT OF THE MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-1S85. Political.—The close of the year 1883 saw the re-establishment of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee's prestige aud the vindication of his authority by the suppression of his brother's rebellion. In the present year under review. His Highnesses position has been still further strengthened by the recovery of two fortresses, one on the coast and the other in the interior, which had been for a long time in the hands of disaffected Chiefs. In April 1884, the Sultan being dissatisfied with the conduct of Sheikh Muhammad-bin- Nasir, El Ruahy, invited him to Muscat, intending to replace him at Zikki by a more obedient and devoted adherent. Sheikh Muhammad came as far as Semail, but having his suspicions aroused returned thence to his fort. In this month the Beni Battash, a powerful tribe in El Sharkiyeh, which had for some time been estranged, became reconciled to His Higfeness. In May a second attempt was made to induce Sheikh Muhammad Nasir to visit Muscat, and this time with better success. Having received a promise of safety, and believing the word of the envoys, he presented himself before the Sultan, by whom he was immediately imprisoned. Sheikh Muhammad then agreed to surrender the fort of Zikki on certain terms ; but 1 e ® e being made known to the tribe, the latter became indignant at the treatment of their Sheikh, and repudiated the agreement. On the 22nd May, the most learned and influential Metowwa or priest in Oman, Muham- mad-El-Gharibi, died at Khudthra in the Batineh. On the 26th, letters and rumours reached Muscat of an intended rising on the part of the Sharkiyeh tribes under the leadership of Sheikh Saleh. A raid on the Batineh coast was also contemplated by Skeikli Hamood-^l-Jahafee ; but these miscbief-mabers failed to i-eeeive the support they expected, aud their schemes ultimately fell through. Ou the 26th Juue, the Political Agent proceeded to the Batmeh in Her Majesty s ship Dragon, to assure himself of the safety of Indian British subjects residing on that coast. In July, a serious conflict took place between the Harth and Mesakereb tribes of El Shar kiyeh, which are constantly at feud, in which about 20 men were killed and wounded. The Sultan received a visit on the Mth of the following month from Sheikh Tahnoon- bin -Zaeed- bin-Khalifa, who arrived from Abutbabee by sea. After several ineffectual missions and much correspondence, the negociations with the Beni Ruweyheb for the surrender of the fort at Zikki, were at length brought to a successful termination through the mediation of the people of Nakhal, and Sheikh Muhammad was released from confinement on the 4th September. By agreement the tribe received a sum o at 500 for giving up the fort. The fort was entrusted by the Sultan to Sule.mau-bin- Suweylim, who was despatched from Muscat with a garrison to rece.ve charge. In this month the Wazir, Seyyid Saeed, proceeded to Soor in the Dar-el-Salaam and effected an arrangement with the Jenebeh about the payment of customs duties and erection of a wall round the town. On the 4th October, the fort of Soweyk was yielded up to the Sultan by Saood-bm-Seyf, Beni Ruweyheh on payment of $500. About the same time Sheikh Hilal -bin-Zahir of Nezwa raided the Jenebeh at Rakkeh in the Province of Oman, and inflicted a loss of ten killed on that tribe. o ^ qicf Optober the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf arrived at Muscat and had an 'interview with the Sultan on the subject of Gwudur affairs. The Political Resident left Muscat to return to Bushire on the 3rd November. bit In W the officers appointed by His Highness to receive charge of the fort appearing, they were refused admittance. , , j £ u* The Sultan's son, Muhammad, having expressed a desire at this time to be relieved of is governship at Sobar, Seyyid Hamad -bin Nasir was appointed to relieve him, and Seyyid Muhammad returned to Muscat on the 6th December.18 ADMINISTRATION EEPOET OF THE PEES IAN GULF POLITICAL On the 10th December, the Political Agent proceeded to Ras Partak in Hei ajes y s ship Dragon to present rewards to the Sultan of Kisheen and the Chiefs of Nishtoon an Tibboot for their services in succouring the shipwrecked crew of the S. S. Airy the previous year. In the same month the new Sheikh of Ras-el-Had was murdered at the instigation of the former Sheikh, and the Dar-el-Salaam was despatched with a small force to punish tin- offenders and restore order. In January, Seyyid Abdool Azeez wrote to the Political Agent from Semed, saying that JHis Highness Seyyid Toorkee had made certain proposals to him, and he desired the mediation of the Political Agent in the matter. A correspondence accordingly ensued. In February, His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was laid up with an attack of lever and was attended by Surgeon-Major Jayakar. Some disturbances occurred at this time in the vicinity of Sohar between the Beni All and Mokabil tribes, and the mediation of the new Wali of Sohar, Seyyid Hamad, was sought by both parties. On the 3rd March, the Political Agent and the Wazir Seyyid Saeed proceeded to Gwadur in Her Majesty^s ship Ranger to join a Court of Enquiry assembled there to investigate claims existing between Arab subjects and the Rinds, subjects of His Highness the Khan of Kalat. The inquiry occupied about three weeks, and the Political Agent returned to Muscat on the 25th March in Her Majesty's ship Ranger. On the 30th March a hurricane struck the Batineh coast between Seeb and Mesnaah and extended inland as far as Rostak, destroying many thousands of date trees and causing a loss ot several lives. Heavy rain fell simultaneously all over Oman, causing immense damage to houses, crops, and trees. Slave Trade. —Daring the year 1884, owing probably to the removal of Her Majesty's ship London at Zanzibar, there was a general revival of the East African slave trade, and a large number of slaves were imported into the Gulf. On the 14th October, Her Majesty's ship Philomel brought into the Vice-Admiralty Court for adjudication a slave dow and 154 slaves she had captured near Ras-el-Had, and on her way to Aden shortly after she seized another dow with 51 slaves near Maseera island. Her Majesty's ship Dragon also brought into the Muscat Court 22 slaves she had recovered on the pirate coast. All these slaves were con demned to Her Majesty. S. B. MILES, Lieut.-Colonel, U. B.

S. Airy, laden with wheat and bound for Port Said from Bombay, ran aground at Ras Nishton near Cape Fartak and became a total wreck- The crew, however, got safely ashore in the boats and were hospitably received and entertained by the Mahras, who forwarded them shortly after in a bugla hired for the purpose to Muscat. The Government of India, on receiving a report of the circumstances, sanctioned the pre sentation of rewards, to the value of Rs. 500, to the Sultan of Kesheen and the Chiefs of Nish ton and Sihoot for the kind treatment and hospitality shown by them to the shipwrecked seamen, and the Political Agent was instructed to convey these presents personally and dis tribute them. The Political Resident, Persian Gulf, having arranged with Captain Anson for a passage in Her Majesty's ship Dragon, the Political Agent left Muscat on the 10th December 1884, and proceeded first to Kesheen, where he arrived on the 15 th December. On landing, the Political Agent accompanied by Captain Anson, had an interview with Sultan Abdulla, and after thanking him on behalf of the Government of India for his friendly action in affording protection to the crew of the S. S. and arranging for their trans mission to Muscat, the Political Agent presented him with the gifts that had been prepared for his acceptance. Sultan Abdulla said that directly lie heard et the wreck he had sent orders by his nephew, Abdulla -hin-Muhammad, to Dhaboot for the crew to be properly cared for and to be conveyed to Muscat as soon as a bugla could be procured, and he was glad that Ins action had merited the approbation and notice of Government. The Sultan stated at the interview that the whole Mahra tribe were^his subjects, and that his rule extended along the coast from Mesenaat to Kas Tharbat Ah. He promis that shipwrecked crews of any nationality should always find protection and hospitality from his people within his temtoiies. From Kesheen the Dragon proceeded to Sihoot, where a visit was paid to Sultan Saad-. bin-salim who was in charge of the town during the absence of the Governor Sultan Muhammad -bin-Omar. The latter is the son of tbe last Sultan of Kesheen, Omar-bin-Towan Who was visited by Captain S. B. Haines and was the rightful successor, but he was young at the time of his father's death to assume power, and it passed on to his cousin Abdullah, the present Sultan. Siboot is a long straggling town, larger than Kesheen. and more busy and thriving. It has 250 houses and about 2,000 inhabitants, a very large proportion of whom are negroes, ihe exports are frankincense, salt-fish, barley, sardine oil, and shark fins ; and the imports in do h &amp;C are considerable, as S.hoot is the main depSt for the supply of the populous Wady Maseelah. There are four banian traders from Cutch here, who keep shops and appear to be ^ Chano-in^ course at Sihoot, the Dragon steamed back to Ras Fartak, near the extreme • t Wt. there is a fishino- village named Khesheyt, a place frequented by Zanzi- point of wh « cargoes Intended for the Hadhramant market. The Governor or tor slavers a h ' and ° f ^r ad a town 5 miles inland, is Ali, a nephew of old Sheikh 'Eesa inentioned by Haines. After visiting Khesheyt, the Political Agent proceeded to Nishton. Ancient Greek writers named this promontory Syagros, having apparently confounded it wS aL sanS another large headland further to the east. The Mahras name it the most striking and, after Ras Sajar, the largest promontory on the southern It is the most g rem arkable natural feature.

At night the fires lighted in the caves by the natives give the promontory a smgulai appearance, and it is the only indication of the face of the cliff being inhabited, as t e ei and caves are invisible from the sea during the day-time. At Nishton, where the Dragon next anchored, one of the headmen was found to be Salim-bin-Barukeyn, the Mahra who had succoured the Knight of the Bath's crew in June 1883 near Ras Sankireh. The old man expressed himself as being grateful for the liberal treatment he had received from the owners of that vessel and the attention shown him in Bombay, and observed that from being a poor fisherman he had become a merchant and a headman of his village. The fame of Salim -bin-Barukeyn s good fortune has spread ever} where along the coast, and has had an excellent effect; it is believed that the Aiabs will e more inclined in future, after observing the liberality shown in these two instances^ to succoui any Europeans who may happen to be wrecked on the shores of Southern Arabia. The Jiry appears to have struck on a bank or reef off the point of Nishton Bay in about two fathoms, and to have subsequently rolled off into deeper water; the crew, having suffered from drinking the brackish water at Nishton, were carried on by the Arabs aftei a few days to Dhaboot, 9 miles further to the north, where they remained until they embaiked in the bugla for Muscat. The Makaddam of Dhaboot, Sheikh Awadth, is a fine-looking old man, and seemed much gratified at the recognition by Government of his kindness to the sailors. Two of the headmen of Nishton, Sheikhs Muhammad and Moosa, who happened to be here, received their presents at the same time as Sheikh Awadth. A few miles further up the Bay of El Kamar is Gheither, a small village of 30 houses, but where a good deal of trade is done, as it is the terminus and depot of an impoitant icad leading to the interior of Hadhramant. From Gheiter to Tereem passing through Ainat is counted fifteen days'* journey, and the chief halting-place is Minar, about 6(J miles from the sea. The road is level all the way. Damkot, the next place visited by the Dragon, is a small Mahra town of about 100 houses built at the foot of a ravine at the bottom of this bay. There are about 300 inhabit ants, and there is some little trade, but the people seemed very poor ; they have no dates or corn, and possess only a few camels, goats, and cattle. The exports are frankincense, ghi, and sardine oil. The Makaddam, a decrepit old man, said he remembered the boats of the Palinurus being engaged in surveying the coast half a century ago. and had seen no ship here since then. None of the people had ever seen a steamer before, and they had in fact shown evident signs of alarm at the Dragon's approach, some clustering together, and others scampering away up the hills at the back; but they were soon reassured. The ravine or gorge which is named Showeyta divides the town into two parts and forms below a long lagoon or creek, the upper part of which is sweet, becoming salt as it nears the sea. The ancient burial-ground lies between the town and the sea ; it is very extensive and believed to be pre-Islamitic. The graves are nearly circular and 10 or 13 feet in diameter. Passing Has Sajar, which marks the southern limit of the territories of the Sultan of Muscat, the Dragon arrived at Sallala and anchored off there on the 19th December. The district of Dhofar, according to some, includes the whole tract lying between Ras Eesoot and Ras Noos, consisting of a maritime plain 85 miles long, enclosed by the lofty range of Jebel Samhan, which touches the sea at these points. But the application of the name is more usually restricted to the rich alluvial plain between Resoot and Thakah. This plain, which is of half- moon shape, is 30 miles in length, with an extreme breadth of about 14, and is formed by the curvature of the hill range ; the coast-lines subtending this arc lying due east and west and having a sharp turn or bay at Resoot and Merbat, which form sheltered harbours for vessels in the south-west and north-east monsoons respectively. It is one of the most fertile and favoured districts on the southern coast of Arabia, and its chequered history shows that it has ever been a coveted possession. Extensive ruins of towns and forts scattered over its surface are an attestation of a former populousness and importance that have long since passed away. Dhofar contains at present five separate towns, all of them near the sea—Okad, Sallala, El Hafah, El Dahareez, and Thakah. The Governor and his garrison reside at Sallala. Numer ous wadies or water-courses intersect the plain, some of which, are well wooded and grassy while others form small fresh-water lakes. The range about Merbat rises to an elevation of 3,000 or 4,000 feet, and is thickly wooded to the summit with tamarind and acacia, frankin cense and bdellium, dragon's-blood and other gum-resinous trees, and affords pasturage to herdsEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 21 of cattle and camels, and flocks of slieep and goats. But the western portion of tbe range behind Dhofar is neither so high nor so well clothed with vegetation, the upper part being almost bare of trees. The soil of the plain is light and rich, and excellent water is found every where at a few feet from the surface. Cotton, jowari, bajri, pulse, lucerne, and cocoanuts are grown, but to a limited extent only. The trade of Dhofar is chiefly in the hands of Khoja merchants, who are agents for houses in Bombay and Moculla. The imports are rice, grain, dates, sugar, cotton cloth, and oil, the cloth being mostly indigo-dyed stuffs from Bombay, and may amount to $50,000 annually. The exports are frankincense, ghee, hides and skins, wax, &amp;c., brought down from the hills by the Gara Bedouins, besides cotton, sardine oil, and shark- fius, &amp;c. The Samhan hills are known to be rich in balsamic, rubber-producing, and other useful trees, but they have never been properly explored. The rubber tree grows to the height of 15 or 20 feet; it is called Isbak by the Arabs and Tishkot by the Garas. Specimens of the product have been sent to Muscat, but it has not yet become an article of trade. The inhabitants of the plains of Dhofar are mostly Katherees. This Hadhramant tribe, under Sultan Bedr Ba Towarek, invaded and overran Dhofar about 300 years ago and made El Dahareez their capital. They were in turn dispossessed by others, but subsequently regained supremacy ; they still form the bulk of the inhabitants and number altogether about 1,500. The total population of the plain may be 2,000. The headmen of the towns and the Kazis all came to Sallala to visit the Political Agent; they are on good terms with the Governor, and expressed themselves as being well satisfied with the rule of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee. The Garas are an extremely interesting and peculiar race, and are but little known. They are allied to the great Mahra tribe of whose language they speak a dialect. They are taller than, and of a different physique and physiognomy from, all the Arab-speaking tribes of Yemen and Oman, and, though they claim to be Hymyarites, have probably a separate origin. The area occupied by the Garas is a very circumscribed one, extending only from Rakeyoot, a village 12 miles west of Has Sajar to Hasek, and not reaching inland more than 40 miles from the sea. In habits they are pure Bedouins, but are not nomadic; they may rather be styled Troglodytes, and their cave-haunting propensity is one of their chief singu larities. The hills appear to be honeycombed with these caves, some of which are of prodi gious dimensions, and afford space and accommodation for a whole family with its possessions in cattle and goats. A cave near the sea explored in the preceding year was 100 feet broad, 60 feet deep, and 8 feet high, and was double-storeyed, a second smaller chamber existing over the roof of the larger. This cave was entirely natural, and was a comparatively small one. The sub-tribes of the Gara are 10 in number and are thus distributed: At Rakyoot—Beyt Shemasa and Beyt Elsa; at Dhofar—Beyt Saeed, Beni Kattan, Beyt Jesjyon, Beyt Tebbook, Beyt Keshoop, Beyt Jahbool, and Beyt Maashinee; at Merbat—Beyt Makheir. The strength of the whole Gara tribe does not probably exceed 3,000 souls. Among the ruins with which the plain is interspersed the most extensive and interesting are those on the shore between El Hafah and El Dahareez, covering a space 2 miles in length. These ruins, now known as El Baleyd, are believed by Sprenger to be the remains of the ancient Mansoora, but this name is unmentioned now in local tradition. The citadel, towers, and mosques are still standing in part, and the town wall and ditch can be distinctly traced. They have been measured and fully described by Carter. According to local tradition this city was founded by the Mainjooi or Nejui dynasty, which rose to the height of its power in the fifth century of the Hijra. The existence of this dynasty has been discredited by European orientalists, but without reason. The tombs of the Sultans near El Robat, a few of them exquisitely worked and inscribed by Persian or Sanaa artists, have been examined and copied. The prosperity of Mansoora was doubtless owing in great measure to the existence of a copious stream of perfectly sweet water which encircled the town on three sides. This stream, which is 4 or 5 fathoms deep, formerly communicated with the sea and formed a most excellent creek or harbour for dows and boats. It is now closed by a sand-bar, but this only requires to be removed to render the port again available for native vessels. About half a mile from the ruins of El Baleyd lies the principal Moslem shrine at Dhofar, the tomb of the Zamorin, known as Abdulla-el-Samiry. He was the Raja of Cranga- nore in Malabar and was converted to Islam in the beginning of the third century of the Hijra, circa 210. Being compelled to leave his kingdom, he embarked in an Arab dow and came to Dhofar, where be died four or five years afterwards in the odour of sanctity. He is reputed to have first brought rain to Dhofar by his prayers, and his tomb is still visited by numbers to beseech his intercession in time of drought. The tomb is enclosed by an unroofed wall of mud 322 ADMINISTEATION EE PORT OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL and stone 25 feet by 10; it is 18 feet long- by 4 broad, and lies north by south, with a bioken headstone of black basalt. The inscription is imperfect and there is no date. The recent history of Dhofar may be said to commence from the seizure of power by the famous pirate Muhammad Akil, who established order and ruled with a s ^ r ^ n o ia murder by the Garas in 1829. On hearing of his death, His Highness Seyy.d baeed, the Iraa of Muscat, immediately sent a force and took possession of the place, a t oug u a brother, Abdul Rahman, who was then a merchant in Bombay, desiied and intu^ue o the government. Seyyid Saeed, however, was at that time engaged in his un uc ye p against Siwi and Membasa in East Africa, and could ill spare the tioops requue oi ^ai ing Dhofar. They were consequently withdrawn soon after, and the distiict c into .i a i ( anarchy, from which it did not emerge until the arrival of Seyyid Fadhl, the ^ ' . 11 year 1870 the Wali at Baghdad, under orders from the Porte, which at that time had designs on Southern Arabia, despatched a quasi-scientific expedition along this coast, and a libera 18 n bution of presents and flags was made to the various chiefs. Dhofar was one of the chie points visited by the steamer, and Turkish flags were landed here, but this tentative move was not followed up by Turkey. Seyyid Fadhl endeavoured to emulate the career of Mahammad Akil, but though he had the support of Mecca in his enterprise, he lacked the capacity for rule ; and his followers, who seem to have been a band of ruffians, roused the people against them by their villainy and oppression. The general confusion became so great at last that the Katheerees and Garas were compelled to unite and expel him. His Highness Seyyid Toorkee was then invited by the natives to occupy the country, and they have since remained contented and fairly prosperous under his rule. At the time of the Political Agents visits in Her Majesty's ship in Novem ber 1883, the Gara Bedouins were not on good terms with the Governor owing to a dis pute about taxes, and a collision had occurred shortly before between the garrison and Sheikh Fankhor -el-Maashinee. At this visit the Political Agent found that the Garas had since submitted, and that friendly relations had been re-established. From Sallala the Political Agent visited El Dahareez and Thakah, and from the latter place the Dragon steamed on to Merbat. Merbat is a town of about 300 inhabitants, situated in a little bay which forms an excellent and secure anchorage during the north-east monsoon, at the western extremity of a narrow plain 25 miles long by 7 broad, extending under the Samhan range. There are two f or ts one in ruins, constructed by Muhammad Akil in 1806 ; and a new one built by the order of His Highness Seyyid Toorkee four years ago, which has a garrison of 20 men. About half a mile from the town lies the tomb of Sheikh Mahammad Ali, who died in 556 A.H., now a famous shrine. The principal export of vegetable origin from Southern Arabia is olibanum or frankincense, the country producing which, the libanophorus region of the ancients, extends from the Wady Meyfa and the Himyar range in longitude 47 o 30'E. to Hasek in longitude 55° 20' E., an area embracing the whole of Hadhramant and part of Oman. Westward of Has Fartak the tree is found but sparingly, and the collection of the gum is neglected by the Arabs, the work being left to a great extent in the hands of Somalis, who come across for the purpose and pay for the privilege. The trees are most abundant on the limestone summits of Jebel Samhan, where the gum is gathered in May and December by the Garas, who call it Shlhat. The termination of the limit of the tree at Hasek and Wady Bakot is very abrupt, and it is not found further to the east. The average annual export of the gum from Dhofar is about 30 tons, and the local value |60 per ton. Two young trees were brought to Muscat in Her Majesty's ship Dragon and are now thriving. From Merbat the Dragon proceeded to Hasek on the 23rd. The old town here, now completely in ruins, is situated on the left bank of the Wady, where it was protected by two circular towers. The more recent inhabitants appear to have been of the Ba Malah tribe, who were attacked by the Kowasim or Beni Yas about three quarters of a century ago, and the women and children carried off into slavery. There is now no trade whatever at Hasek, and Arab craft seldom or never call here. Hellaniyeh, the largest and only inhabited island of the Kuria Muria group, was nest visited. The inhabitants of this island, 34 in number, subsist on fish and goats' milk, with a little rice and dates which they procure from passing dows by selling dried fish. Their habitations are of the most wretched and primitive description. Generally round or oval, 6 feet in diameter, and the height of a walking-stick, they are built of loose stones with a scanty rcofing of mats laid over sticks and fish bones. Miserable as is their condition, their posseesionsRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOR 1884-85. 23 are, nevertheless, coveted by others, and they are sometimes ill-treated and robbed by the Kowasim and Beui Yar Arabs. Hellaniyeh was occupied as a station in 1S61 for the lied Sea and Ivaiachi lelegiaph. but was abandoned on the failure o£ that cable in 186£. The guano, for the sake of which the cession of these islands was obtained in 1854-, has long since been removed, and vessels now rarely touch here. The last place visited by the Dragon was Has Sharbedat. This part of the coast is inhabited by the Jenebeh tribe, who wander here during the cold weather with their flocks and herds for convenience of pasturage, and return to Jaalan in the summer. Ihere are three fxesh- water lakes in this neighbourhood. The Political Ag-ent returned to Muscat ou the 28th December 1884.24 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PEESIAN GULF POLITICAL APPENDIX B TO PART II. The Portuguese in Eastern Arabia, hy Lieutenant -Colonel S. B. Miles. It was very early after the Portuguese had commenced their career o£ conquest in th East upon the discovery of the Cape route to India, that they turned their attention to e Persian Gulf. When Albuquerque returned from his first voyage to India in loOJ-, he advocated policy of conquest and aggression, and appears to have been the originator of that scieme o extensive annexation and occupation of the Indian seaboard which the King, Dom x anoe , was eventually induced to adopt, and which Albuquerque himself was selected to cany out. This scheme was not adopted without much opposition from Saldanha and otheis, who propounded a more cautious plan for the maintenance of the new commerce. The future policy of the nation in the East was indeed hotly discussed at Lisbon, and the King^s decision was i'oi a long time doubtful. There was one point, however, on which all parties were agreed, and that was the im portance of obstructing the old lines of commerce by the Arabian and Persian Gulfs, and of securing the entire monopoly of the trade by diverting it to the new route; and to this end immediate and determined efforts were resolved on. In the year 1506 three fleets were despatched from Lisbon to the East, one of which consisted of sixteen vessels under Tristan da Cunha with Alfonso d'Albuquerque as second in command. The instructions given to do Cunha were to proceed to the Island of Socotra and there construct a fort, which, while protecting the Christians supposed to inhabit that island, should also serve as a depot for the use of the fleets destined to oppose the Egypto- Venetian confederacy and to blockade the Red Sea. On the completion of the fort, da Cunha was to proceed to India with his share of the fleet, leaving Albuquerque with a small squadron to attack Jeddah and Aden, and to obstruct the Moorish trade. Albuquerque had, no doubt, at once perceived the uselessness of Socotra for the purpose intended, and was well aware that his flotilla was too small for him to attempt the capture of Aden. As will be seen presently, therefore, he thought fit, after the departure of Tristan da Cunha, to deviate somewhat from his instructions, and sailed away to the north-east, intent upon the capture of Hormuz, then the chief emporium of commerce in the Persian Gulf. It did not require the genius of an Albuquerque to perceive that the acquisition of this island would, by giving him the entire command of the Persian Gulf route, be of greater service to his King than the temporary blockade of the Red Sea and the bombardment of Jeddah. Albuquerque's expedition against Hormuz was ouly partially successful, owing to the defection of some of his officers ; but the importance of his achievement was fully recognised at home, and he had the satisfaction of returning and completing his work tiiere before his death. It was on his way to reduce the city of Hormuz, and with the avowed object of destroyincr rival sources of trade, and leaving no hostile states in his rear, that he paid his attention to Oman, and laid in ruins the principal towns on that coast from Kilhah to Khor Fakan. Some of these towns were sooner or later occupied and fortified, and with varying fortune remained in possession of the Portuguese for about a century and a half, when their power having greatly declined throughout the East, the Arabs were able at length to overcome them and expel them from the country. The history of this occupation is sketched in the following narrative:— A complete account of the Portuguese conquests in the East would perhaps form one of the most instructive and entertaining chapters in the history of the world, but it has yet to be written, though there is an extensive literature on the subject, and 'there must be rich materials awaiting investigation in the archives of Lisbon, Goa, and Madrid The native annalists of Oman, as might be expected, maintain a discreet silence respectino- the arrival and conquests of the infidels in their country; but some of the contests that took place ^a later period, when the increasing feebleness of the Portuguese garrisons encourao-ed insurrection are frequently and exultingly recorded, as well as their final expulsion. In lookin- backEESIDENCT AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 26 at the achievements and proceedings of the first European nation to open up the East, it is interesting to bear in mind the extent of the influence which the action and behaviour of the Portuguese have had in forming the impressions of the character of Emopeans in general aniono' the natives of India, as there is no doubt that these first impressions took root and have constituted a by no means inappreciable factor in shaping the course of events during the last three centuries. By reason of their isolated and remote position, the ideas of the Arabs about foreigners are extremely vague and erroneous, and owing partly to their habit of confounding all Europeans under the appellation of Nasara or Christians, and partly to their beino- best Acquainted of late years with the English, it has happened that the doings of the Portuguese in the 16th and 17th centuries are by the vulgar often ascribed to us. The dread inspired by the wars of Albuquerque and his successor was preserved by oral tradition, and we may be sure that these traditions lost nothing by the additions and em- bellishments which, time provides, and which hate and fear never fail to suggest. The undisputed supremacy of the Arabs at sea in the Indian Ocean which existed at the commencement of the sixteenth century fell at once from their grasp on the appearance of the Portuguese, and was never subsequently regained by them. Let us hope it has passed away for ever, for the revival of Arab power would be merely another name for piracy, pillage, and the slave trade. Tristan da Cunba sailed from Lisbon on the 6th o£ March 1506, and after many adven tures and some losses anchored safely at Soko, the port of Socotra, in the middle of the year followino- having on the way been joined by the Fkr de la Mar, commanded by Captain Joa5 da Nova, who had proceeded to India with a former fleet, and who afterwards proved such a thorn in the side of Albuquerque at Hormuz. At Sol-o da Cunha found a different reception awaiting him from what he had expected. The island was in possession of Sultan Ibrahim, son of the Saltan of Kisheen, who resolutely reiected the Admiral's demand for surrender. The fort was accordingly besieged by the Portu- Jese and in spite of a valiant resistance, assaulted and carried, the Mahra garrison being put to the sword The fort was then rebuilt and named St. Thomas, and Alfonso deNoronha was annointed to'the command. It was the end of July 1507 before affairs were finally arranged at Socotra and the time then arrived for da Cunha and Albuquerque to part company and to pursue the' course of action prescribed for each respectively by the King. The squadron allotted to Albuquerque by the chief captain consisted of- (1) The Cirne, the flagship of Albuquerque. (2) The Huy Grande: Captain Francisco de Tavoia. (3) The Flor de la Mar : Captain Joao da Nova. (4) The Bey Pegneno : Captain Manoel Telles Barretto. f5^ The Sam Jorge Transport; Captain A. Lopes da Costa. . . „ ^ fleet set sail from Soko for the Arabian coast.26 Passing Soor, which is described as a small fishing village, the fleet, sailing clos ® ^ nd followed by a large concourse of people along the shore, next anived at t e c y where Albuquerque ordered his ships to come to an anchor with as much noise an } . ) could be made. This was the first appearance of Europeans in ships in the Gulf of Oman since the days of Alexander, eighteen centuries before. And from the ready submission of the people of Ki hat, the appearance of the fleet seems to have been viewed with no little teiroi and dismay, tie Persians here having doubtless heard of the proceedings of the Portuguese on the Indian coast and of their warlike character and superiority. At the time of these events the Arab Prince in power in Oman was the Imam Muham- mad-bin-Ismail-el-Ismaili, who was elected in A.H. 906 (A.D. 1500) and died in A.II. 942 (A.D. 1535). His capital was el Rostak, where he usually resided. He held sway, however, only over the interior portion of the country, the coast line being still, as it had been since A.D. 1370, subject to the Persian King of Hormuz, whose chief Governor was at Kilhat, No communication was held the first day with the city, but on the following morning a boat was sent on shore with two officers and an interpreter, who were civilly received, and were informed that the town belonged to the kingdom of Hormuz, and that anything required for the fleet would be willingly supplied. On the next day, further communications took place between the Governor and Albuquerque, to whom a present of fruit, &amp;c., was sent on board by the former. The present, however, was not accepted by Albuquerque, who required the unconditional submission of the town and the transfer of allegiance to the King of Portugal. The Governor being unprepared for resistance resolved to temporise, and humbly depre cating the opening of hostilities and the destruction of the town, besought Albuquerque to pro ceed to Hormuz and make terms with the King, promising that whether peace or war might result there, Kilhat would nevertheless yield subjection to the King of Portugal. This evasive reply was fully understood by Albuquerque; but as he was in urgent need of provisions he took the advice of his officers and accepted the position until a more convenient opportunity. Before leaving, Albuquerque gave a written guarantee of safety from attack by other Portuguese ships in the name of the King Dom Manoel to the Governor, but he did not scruple to make prize of an Aden dow of 200 tons lying in the harbour which was held to ransom. On Sunday, the 22nd August, Albuquerque weighed from Kilhat and sailed for Teywee, which he had supposed to be a large port, but finding it merely a watering place he passed on to Kooriyah, where he anchored for the night. The next day no boat came off from the shore, and it was seen that the inhabitants had prepared for resistance. Albuquerque accordingly reconnoitred the place in his boat and arranged his plan of attack for the following morning. It was ascertained that the Arabs had two batteries, on one of which they had mounted four mortars, and the attack was consequently concentrated on these points. The struggle was lone- and severe, but the natives were ultimately driven out of their defences and pursued half a league by the Portuguese, who slaughtered indiscriminately all the men, women, and children they could reach. Some prisoners taken in the town had their ears and noses lopped off to signalise the victory, and Kooriyah was plundered and set onfiri. Twenty-five firelocks besides spears, bows and arrows, &amp;c., were captured, and 38 vessels, large and small, lyin^ in the port, were burnt. Muscat, the next seene of destrnetion, was readied in fonr days after leavin'- Kooriyah and was found to he a very formidable and well.fortified place. It is also described as bei'u.r the principal port on that coast. The inhabitants had heard of the fate of Kooriyah and were disinclined to expose their city to a similar catastrophe; they therefore did not'wait for • summons to surrender, hut immediately on the arrival of the Heet sent off two of their chief men to Albuquerque, offering submission to the King of Portugal, and promisinjr to aaree to terms that might he demanded, D ' - Albuquerque, finding they were unprovided with written power to treat from the Governor sent them on shore again, desiring them to return on board the followino- day In th time he sounded the harbour and reconnoitred the fortifications. It waslonnd that the Arab', had constructed a rampart of wood and earth from hill to hill above the beaeh in front of th. town and had mounted thereon a number of mortars. On the two Sheikhs visiting All™ querquo next day, hey were .nformed that they were required to pay an annual tribute and furnish his fleet with supplies and water during the operations against Horning rT y with the requisition for provisions was made at once; but during the night the inhabitanU wereEESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 27 reinforced by a powerful Sheikh from the interior^ and felt strong enough to withdraw their submission and defy the Portuguese. Albuquerque therefore resolved on reducing the town without delay, and having ordered his ships to take up positions, commenced to bombard the stockade and batteries. The fire of the guns, however, had little effect, owing probably to the distance of the ships, and Albuquerque thought it best to call a council of war to decide on what was to be done. The captains, who had already begun to get restive under the iron rule of their commander, seeing that Albuquerque had made up his mind as to the course he would pursue, and dreading perhaps the strength of the place, declined to discuss the plan of operations, or express an opinion, and informed him simply that they were ready to obey his orders. Being now free to act, Albuquerque no longer hesitated, and gave directions for an assault on the morrow. He divided his force into two, giving command of the right division against the stockade to Captains deTavora and daCosta, while he himself took charge of the left. The landing was effected under the fortifications j and although an obstinate defence was made, the walls were stormed and carried at both points. A junction was then effected in the streets between the two attacking parties, according to previous arrangement, and the enemy was then gradually driven through and out of the town. The Sheikh, whose arrival had caused such rejoicing and had inspired the people to oppose their invaders, escaped after a long pursuit, but the slaughter of the Arabs was very great, and included the Persian Governor of the town and a number of women and children. In the slaughter of the women, the two captains who subsequently mutinied and deserted their leader, ^., &amp; AntaodoCampo and Joa6 daNova, seem to have particularly distinguished themselves ; but'Albuquerque's conduct is equally deserving of reprobation, for after the rout of the Arabs was complete and the scattered Portuguese soldiers were collected in the town,^ he proceeded to massacre most of the remaining inhabitants, men, women, and children, without distinction. After guarding against surprise, the town was occupied and pillaged, and the men were allowed to retain their loot and remove it on board, as some compensation for the hardships they had undergone. Among the spoil were thirty guns, bows and arrows, lances and other weapons used by the Arabs. Albuquerque spent eight days here, and took the opportunity to refit his fleet and victual it with provisions and water. Having done this he was preparing to evacuate the town and set it on fire, when the inhabitants, who had taken refuge on the heights above, guessin- his intention, despatched an Arab with a flag of truce to beseech him to be content with having slain the women and children, and to spare the town and ships from the flames. Albuquerque replied to the envoy that he regretted the destruction of the city, but that the inhabitants had broken faith with him, and he could not consequently admit their cla 'n to forbearance. He consented, however, to hold the city to ransom, which he fixed at 10 000 Ashrafis in gold, to be paid the next day at noon. This amount the Arabs were unable or unwilling to pay by the time appointed, and the town was therefore destroyed by fire together with 34 dows and many fishing boats. The mosque, described as a very large and beautihil edifice constructed of wood elaborately carved, also fell a prey to the flames; and it is related that three Portuguese engaged in hacking at the carved wooden pi lars were crushed and buried by the sudden collapse of the building: all believed they had perished; but as Uiey emerged unhurt, the commander at once returned thanks to the Holy Virgin for her miraculous interposition in their behalf during their pious labour. Albuquerque gives tne following curious description of Muscat at that time . _ _ ^ „ 'Musc-at is a large and wy populous town (knkod oa both sides with high mountains, and the frout .s , „ . ,, watcr - s e age; behind, towards the Interior, there is a plain as large as the square ot Lisbon, all eovend with salt pans Not that the tide reaches there, but the springs are salt and salt forms there.

Previous to the departure of the fleet from Muscat, the first open rupture took place between the chief Captain and Captain Joa6 daNova of the Flor de la Mar. Albuquerque had information that daNova intended to desert him here and slip away to India, an e therefore summoned him to his ship, and convened a council. DaNova did not deny the chaige , and the officers having supported Albuquerque, daNova submitted and was 01 eie to con mue with the fleet under severe penalty. Passing- the Deymanieth islands the fleet anchored in due course off Sohar. A message was immediately despatched by the Governor to Albuquerque informing him that the city belonged to the King of Hormuz, and intimating that if he landed he would meet with a differ ent reception from what the other towns on the coast had given him; at the same time the messenger pointed to the troops on shore, where as much display and parade weie being made as possible. Albuquerque replied shortly that the Governor had better re-consider lus detei- mination and own allegiance to Portugal, otherwise the fortress would assuredly be taken fiom him in the morning. The sight of the imposing force of infantry and cavalry on shore had a pacific effect on the other captains in the fleet, but Albuquerque knew his strength better, and, as soon as the messenger had gone, commenced his preparations for the attack. All was ready by noon the next day, and the boats were about to shove off, when a deputation from the town arrived and stated that the Governor had just dismissed a force of 7,000 men which had been sent by the Benjaber to his aid, and that as the King of Hormuz had not sent the succours he had promised, the Governor was ready to submit to the King of Portugal, and to deliver up the fort. Albuquerque said he was glad that the Governor had changed his mind, and intimated that he would accept the submission of the town on condition of its paying a yearly tribute. The envoys, alarmed at the preparations they had seen on board, agreed to this, and having con cluded a convention, returned to the Governor. Due arrangements having been made, the Portu guese standard was carried to the fort in state and hoisted on the highest tower under a salute. Ou seeing the strength of the place, Albuquerque was inclined at first to retain possession of it, as he would thereby gain complete command of the Oman coast, but on second thoughts he decided to entrust the fort to the Governor for the present, and accordingly placed him in charge, appointing the yearly tribute fixed for the town for the payment of the Arab garrison. A written acknowledgment of allegiance to the King of Portugal was then executed by the Governor, and a guarantee of protection was' given by Albuquerque in return ; and matters having thus been adjusted, Albuquerque weighed the next morning and steered his course for Khor Fakan. The inhabitants of this place had received news of the fleet's approach by a boat from Sohar, and made a great display of horse and foot on the beach, hoping to deter the Portuguese from attack by mere bravado. This continued the whole of the first dav ; and as Albuquerque received no message or offer of submission from the Governor, he determined to attack early the following morning, and made his signal two hours after midnight. After clearing the beach by the guns in the boats, the troops landed and marched up pursuing the Arabs, who hastily retired to the gates of the fort. As they entered pell mell, some of the Portuguese, headed by Albuquerque's nephew Noronha, managed to press in with them, and being soon supported by Albuquerque himself, found themselves, after a long and stubborn fight, in possession of the town and fortress, which were occupied and guarded. One of the elders of the town, who was too old and infirm to escape, and had concealed himself in a cellar was captured and brought before Albuquerque, to whom he gave important information respecting the kingdom of Hormuz. He also gave Albuquerque a Persian history of Alexander and in consideration of this was honourably treated and released. Some days were' spent in getting provisions and water on board, the prisoners being used as slaves in this work; and meanwhile the Arabs made repeated attempts to regain possession of the town, but without success. As the fleet had approached Khor Fakan, the Portuguese had observed several vessels sailing away in the direction of Cape Mussendom, and they now learned that these dows contained the Hindu traders from Cutch, escaping with their property : very little boot consequently was found in the town, much to the disappointment of the victors Numero/ captives, however, were taken, who appear to have been released with the customary mutilation of ears and noses.9,Q RESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. Khor Fakan is described by Albuquerque as being situate at the foot of a very high mountain and almost impregnable on the land side. It was a large town with many Baman merchants, and was a dependency o£ Hormnz. The climate was temperate and healthy, and there was extensive cultivation o£ wheat and millet, with oranges, limes, dates, plantains, ant fio-s. The harbour was good, being protected by two small islets. Horses were extensively exported hence to India and the interior belonged to Benjaber like the other parts. Khor Fakan was the last scene of Albuquerque's exploits on the Oman coast, and he had as little compassion on this as on former places. The town was set on fire and destroyed, and the conquistador, elated by his victories, and confident in bis strength, signalled to the fleet and made his way direct to Hormuz. The capture of Hormnz was the principal object of Albuquerque's expedition as before remarked, and his operations and exploits here were characterised by the same distingnisbed ability valour, and success that had marked his previous career. Owing, however, to the disaffec tion of bis officers and the desertion of two of his ships, he was compelled to retire before the finish had been put to his conquest by the completion of the fort which was to overawe the fnwn He sailed away to Soeotra, where his arrival was most opportune, tor he found the gam- son in great distress from famine and the enmity of the natives. He soon put affairs in order there - and bis fleet having been increased by two ships that bad arrived from Portugal to join him he weio-hed from Soke on the 15tb of August 1508 to return to Hormuz, intending on the Wiv'to reduce the city of Kilhat in retaliation for the assistance rendered by it to the King of Hm-muz^ in^ violation of agreement, during the war. On anchoring off Kilhat, Albuquerque sent his nephew Noronha in a boat to reconnoitre. Near the shore Noronha met an ra bringing presents from the Governor, on which lie turned hack and accompanied the man to the flic Ship where Albuquerque questioned the Arab as to the Governor s name and the force at hir disposal Having elicited the required Information, Albuquerque despatched Noronha to the shore again to see the Governor, Sherif-ul-Dm, and if possible to entice him on board which Noronha endeavoured to do by representing Albuquerque as an officer who had just arrived from Portugal with reinforcements to support Albuquerque at Hormuz. Shenf - U ' m w ' polite, and offered the new commander a hospitable reception on shore, if it pleased him to land, hut he was too wary to trust himself on board a Portuguese ship. On his nephew's return from his ineffective mission, Albuquerque made prepnrations to attack the towp which is situated on a declivity under a high and steep cliff. The struggle for the ■ ' f the place did not last long. The Persians, terror-stricken by the vigorous onslaught ^'n in confusion out of the town, and Sberif-ul Din was obliged tire to the beb-bts behind the city, from whence be watched the proceedings of the n- aders Albuquerque, having posted guards on the gates and ramparts against surprise gave th e V I ' ■ t nhrnder whereon the vigilant Sherif-ul-Dm, after three days, seeing the Portuguese place ovei o p deemed it a fitting opportunity to attempt to regain the town.

For five years the Arabs appear to have been left unmolested by their new foes, and in the meantime they had leisure to rebuild theii towns, an to wa c , as ey doubtless did, with interest the proceedings of their ruthless invaders at Hormuz an in India. In 1512, Diogo Fernandes deBega, who had been sent to demolish the fort at Socotra which had been found useless for the purpose it was intended to serve, came to Hormuz and Muscat to receive the tribute agreed upon with the King. It had been the intention of Albuquerque, who had in the meantime become the second \iceroy of India, to return to the Persian Gulf this year with deBega, but circumstances prevented his doing so until two years later, when he sailed from Goa with a fleet of 14 sail of the line and 13 smallei vessels. On the 21st March 1515 hesighted land near Ras-el-Nad, and four days latci aiiived at Koonyah. Here he found an armada from Hormuz on the look-out for pirates, and deciding not to molest it he moved on to Muscat, where he anchored for two days to take in provisions and water. Ihe Persian Governor or Agent here at the time was Rais Hamed, a nephew of Rais Noor-ul-Din, one of the officers of the King of Hormuz, and Albuquerque was mucii exercised at observing his tyrannical behaviour over the people. He appears, however, to have behaved civilly enough to the Portuguese, having doubtless a lively recollection of what had occurred seven yearg before. Having completed the conquest of Hormuz, the Viceroy prepared to turn his face southwards, and appointed his relative, Pedro d'Albuquerque, commandant of the fort with a strong garrison to overawe the city. It was the last important act of his life, for he was very ill when he set sail, and as it turned out on his death-bed, and the ' terrible Albu querque, ' as he was called, died the day of his arrival off the bar of Goa, his end being hastened by the news he had received of his supersession and recall by the King. DeBarros gives a curious and detailed account of the revenue and expenditure of Hormuz at this time. He says that on the coast of Arabia the chief town was Kilhat, the Governor and Customs Master at which overruled those in the other towns in the principality. The reve nue collected and remitted by Kilhat to Hormuz was 19,200 Sherafins, equal to 5,760 dollars, which was contributed in the following proportions: Kilhat paid 11,000 Ashrafis, Muscat 4 ,000, Sohar 1,500, Khor Fakan 1,500, Dibba 500, and Lima 700. The Julfar district, or Pirate coast, also paid 7,500, and in addition to the above the boats engaged in the pearl fishery, which were compelled to go to Hormuz to take out passes, contributed 1,500 Ashrafis. The Oman revenue thus came to 28,200 Ashrafis. The total revenue of Hormuz is said to have been 198,078 Ashrafis, or $59,423. The same writer also gives us a glimpse at the political state of Oman at this time, from- which we learn that the Imam Muhommad possessed undisputed spiritual and temporal power m all parts, and that the chief cities in Oman proper, which was the most populous district were Manh, Nezwa, and Behla, each of which was fortified and had its own ^^-independent King who ruled in a sort of republic. These chieftains had formed a league to protect them selves against the Benjaber, a predatory tribe and the most powerful in Arabia, who used to raid Oman every year at the date season. The Imam had to buy them off from plunderino- his territories by an annual tribute. Intermediate between the above towns and the seaboard were other Sheikhdoms who were continually at feud with the Persian garrisons, a state of distraction which of course operated m favour of the Portuguese. Who these Benjaber were that appeared so formidable is an enigma that remains unsolved. ' ' ' ■ After the subjection of Hormuz three places ou the Arab coast-m„ Kilhah, Muscat, aud Sohar-became statrous for the Portuguese factors aud merchauts who were appoiuted aud controlled from Hormuz. They were sufficently protected by the visits of thJ King's ships from Indra winch touched at these places on the.r way to Hormuz aud Bahrein, and as no ve sel under a na ive lag was suffered to cross the ocean without a pass, they bad practically control of all seaborne commerce, aud thus commanded the markets. But it does not appear that any garrisons were yet stationed on the Oman coast. In the veir 1 ^1Q fV « . , ! V Portuguese prestige in the gulf occurred at Kilhat, and was due as sLTthW n' t0 ^ to an unwise meddling in local politics.

This order ho . . eVascon - ' eve r, Duarte MendesRESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. 31 found himself unable to carry out, as Shehab-ul-Dm was too vigilant and well guarded, until the arrival of Jorge D'Albuquerque, who, being on his way out from Lisbon with a fleet of ten ships, had received instructions at Mozambique from the Viceroy to meet him at Muscat, and who at this juncture put in at Kilhat. A stratagem devised by Duarte Mendes was agreed to by Albuquerque, and a small force having been landed in the town, the Governor's house was attacked in the night. The plan, however, failed. The Portuguese were'repulsed by the Persians and overpowered, and the house in which they took refuge was set on fire. After a severe struggle and heavy loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners, they were rescued by a fresh party from the fleet. Shehab-ul-Dm remained uncaptured and triumphant. Shortly after, in the beginning of the following year, 1520, the Viceroy, Diago Lopes de Siqueira, anchored at Muscat, and after au enquiry censured and condemned the whole proceed ings, and put Duarte Mendes in irons. The Viceroy then proceeded on to Hormuz with a few galleys, leaving Albuquerque in charge of the major portion of the fleet at Muscat. Fifteen Portuguese, who had been taken prisoners and carried inland from Kilhat, were recovered by Albuquerque in wretched plight, but no attempt seems to have been made to avenge the disaster. In the next year, only seven years after the fall of Hormuz and the death of the great con quistador, a concerted insurrection took place at Hormuz and along the Arabian shores from Bahrein to Kilhat, and the garrisons were taken so completely by surprise that it was only by chance and by their own marvellous valour thaftheir entire annihilation was not accomplished. The cause of this revolt, according to the Portuguese officers on the spot, was the dissatisfaction felt by the King at their interference in the arrangements of the Customs House and general supervision of the revenue, a measure lately introduced undei oideis fiom Lisbon. By this control a number of favourites and parasites lost their sinecures, and a good deal of wasteful expenditure and peculation was no doubt prevented. But the proximate and predominating cause was without question the greed, insolence, and oppression of the Portuguese officials, who made no scruple of taking advantage of their strength and of helping themselves as they pleased. The plan of the massacre was elaborately worked out and decided upon by the King and his ministers, and when all was ready, letters were despatched to the Persian Governors of dependencies on the Arab coast with orders to rise against the Portuguese in their towns on the appointed day and spare none. The rising was therefore general, and from its taking place simultaneously, there was no opportunity of the Portuguese fleeing from one point to another. A stratagem was devised to get rid of the Portuguese armada constantly stationed at Hormuz to support the Commandant. The King, pretending that the dependencies on the Oman coast were being ravaged by pirates, requested Dom Garcia to despatch the armada to protect them ; this was on the eve of the rising, and the Commandant unsuspectingly issued the necessary orders to the Captain-Major, Manoel deSouza Tavares. The latter, however, took two only out of the four ships at his disposal and set sail for Muscat. The revolt occurred on the 30th Novem ber 1521, and commenced with an attack by the Shah Bandar on the two vessels left in the harbour at midnight. The crews were overcome, and a fire signal having been lighted in board the captured vessels, a massacre ensued of the Portuguese residents in the city, who were asleep on their beds, unsuspicious of evil. About sixty Portuguese were slain and captured by the Persian troops and populace, and the remainder took refuge in the fort, which was bravely defended by the o-arrison until succour arrived from India. In the dependencies the King's plan was faith fully carried out by the Governors. At Bahrein the! Christians were attacked, and the factor Buy Bale was tortured and crucified. At Sohar very few, if any, escaped the massacre that took place. In Muscat alone the Portuguese found friends and protection. The attitude of e Arab Governor, Sheikh Rashid, who was favourably inclined to them and doubtless foresaw their ultimate triumph, kept the Persians iu eheek aud preveuted a rising; and when the chief factor of Kilhat, Vas deVeiga, arrived shortly after, he threw off Ins aUegmnce and declared tor the Portuguese, in which he was joined by the chief Arab inhabitants. At Kilhat the Portuguese appear to have received warning from the Commandant of Hormuz of the revolt, and, collecting their valuables, made a start for their boats in the harbour but they were mter- cented bv the Governor and the Persian garrison, who attacked and killed several and captured others. The factor, T. Vas deVeiga, then set out for Muscat, where be found Captam-Major Manoel deSouza Tavares, -with whom he sailed at once for the relief o£ Hormuz. At Hormuz, immediately on the occurrence of the revolt, the Commandant had hired a vessel which he entrusted to Joao deMeira, and directed him to sad at once to India with the news for the Viceroy, and to touch at Muscat and Kilhat on the way This Joao deMeira did and was tbns instrumental iu warning bis countrymen at those two places of the intended massacre. The number of Portuguese killed iu this insurrectionary movement was about U0.32 ADMINISTEATION REPORT OF THE PERSIAN GULP POLITIC^ L The Viceroy at that time, Dom Buarte deMenezes, despatched Dom Gon Calo in advance to enconrage the gams ; t ' nee .

It was in February 1522 when Dom Luiz deMenezes set out from Chaul witb a flotilla o£ three galleys, four fustas and one caravella to avenge the massacre and restore order, having already despatched in advance the new Commandant of Hormuz, Joao Rodngues deNoronha, to relieve Continho, whose three years tenure of office had expired. Dom Luiz anchored first at Kilhat, where his first demand was for the surrender of the captives, now reduced to 26 in number. The Governor replied by sending off the King's letter addressed to Dom Luiz, which contained nothing but a series of complaints against the present and former Portuguese Corn- mandants of Hormuz, but he evaded the demand for the delivery of the prisoners by saying that he had no authority, and must await the new Governor. Dom Luiz being in want of water for his ships, proceeded to Teynwee, where a collision occurred with the Arabs, in which the latter were defeated, and in revenge for which they murdered seven Portuguese they had in their hands. While at this place, Dom Luiz received a message from Sheikh Rashid, reporting the approach by land to Muscat of Reis Delamin Shah with a large force, and be seeching armed support. Dom Luiz accordingly detached the caravella for Muscat with orders to support the Sheikh from the sea as far as the guns of the vessel would reach, but to under take no operations on shore. The Sheikh, nevertheless, obtained the aid of five Portuguese volunteers, and attacking the Persians in the Great Wady completely defeated them, their leader, Delamir Shah, being killed in the fight. Dom Luiz arrived at Muscat two days after this affair, and having congratulated the Sheikh, rewarded him handsomely for his loyalty and nrotection to the Portuguese during the revolt. He then stationed a fusta as security for the port and apparently for the first time established here a garrison of 20 men for the defence of the town. After a stay of four days, during which time he was joined by two more vessels from Goa, Dom Luiz set out for Sohar, where there was a large Persian garrison. The Arab chief in the neighbourhood of Sohar at this time was Sultan-biu-Mesood, who dwelt in the interior near the hills and whose army was composed of 250 horse and 3,000 foot. Another neighbour was Sheikh Husein-bin-Saeed, the Chief of the great tribe Ben Jabra, who had 300 horse and 4,000 foot. These Ben Jabra were Bedouins, and possessed more than 500 leagues of country. Sheikh Husein was therefore the lord of all the interior as well as the Island of El Bahrein and the entire coast as far south as Dhofar. Dom Luiz having information about these two important personages, who being Arabs were always at war with the Persians of Hormuz, determined to seek their alliance, and accordingly wrote to them, offering to put them in possession of Sohar if they would aid him in ousting the Persians. To this proposal the two Sheikhs readily agreed, but Dom Luiz was detained on his way to Sohar by contrary winds, and in the meantime, by an untoward incident which occurred off the Batineh coast, Sultan-bin-Mesood became estrano-ed G * Dom Luiz's plan was that the Arabs should surround Sohar by land while he attacked it from the sea ; but on his arrival there on the 11th March 1522 he found Sheikh Husein only with his force in position. Sheikh Sultan having retired in dudgeon. The gallant Persian Governor, Reis Shehab-ul-Din, moreover, had already effected his escape, leaving his garrison of 80 men to defend the fort as best they might. Dom Luiz arranged to attack the place at once, but the garrison, deserted by their leader and dreading the resentment of their enemy had no intention of awaiting the assault; and having bribed the Arabs outside, were allowed to pass through their lines at night and decamp ii&gt; the darkness. The Portuguese troops on shore hearing of this, scaled the walls and entered the fort, and having massacred or capturedQQ EESIDENCY AND MUSCAT POLITICAL AGENCY FOE 1884-85. the inhabitants and sacked the town, set it on fire, much to the surprise and indignation of their General, Dom Luiz, who, being on board his vessel, had not been kept informed ot what had occurred. The Arabs, who had not been present at, or partakers in, the plunder, were not unnaturally enrao-ed with Dom Luiz for what they considered a breach of faith on his part, but he made what reparation he could by giving up to them the captives and some of the loot ^ and fina y having declared Sohar independent of Hormuz, he appointed Sheikh Husein-bin-Saeed Governor on behalf of Portugal under a convention. After leaving a Portuguese scrivener as Political Agent to note the revenues and expenses of the place. Bom Luiz weighed with his fleet and set sail for Hormuz. In 1526 another revolt occurred at Muscat and Kilhat, both of which were at this time still subordinate to Hormu?;. These disturbances were due. it is said, like the former ones, to the oppression and exactions of the Portuguese, and chiefly of Diogo deMello, the then commandant of Hormuz. The provisional Viceroy at Goa, Lopo Vaz deSampayo, accordingly proceeded to the Gulf in May 1527 with five ships, and by promising to redress wrongs and to punish Captain deMello, suc ceeded in pacifying the coast without having recourse to coercion. Dom Lopo took the opportunity of increasing the garrison at Muscat and of ordering the erection of the uge nile of buildings to be used as a factory, and which, as usual in those days, comprised the jov- ernors' residence, soldiers' barracks, warehouses, and chapel. This factory appears to have been completed about four years later. In later days it has served as a residence tor the Seyyids or Lords of Oman, and though now somewhat dilapidated, is still a fine budding, and one of the chief monuments of the Portuguese occupation on this coast. Among the Arabs it letams e name of Gareza, a corruption ot the Portuguese ' Egreja, ' a church. Dom Nuno da Cunha, who succeeded Lopo Vaz de Sampayo as tenth Viceroy, made a tour of the Portuguese possessions soon after his assumption of office, and on his way to Hormuz anchored at Kilhat on the 10th May 1529, where he met Captain Aires de S. da Magalhaes who had been despatched from India with a tusta and two bngantmes to cruise against the pirates. The factor of Kilhat at this time was Gomes Ferreira, servant of the Duke of Braganza, and he appears to have caused a good deal ot ill-feeling against the Portuguese among the Arabs by his arbitrary conduct aud extortion. They therefore seized the opportunity to lay their complaints before the Governor General, who thereupon issued a manifesto that come to redress grievances and wonld enquire into disputes, the result being that several Portuo-uese officials who had wronged the natives were degraded and removed to Hormuz. This policy of justice and integrity on da Cunha's part gave great satisfaction to the people and had a very salutary effect in reducing the insolence ot the Portuguese officers and impro - in' their relations with the people, but unfortunately the good done was but transitory. ' Nine days later daCunha was at Muscat where he was also engaged in putting aftaus in order. The Governor, Sheikh Rashid, nt once implored his protection against Ren, Sheiee the Kind's Wazir at Hormuz, who had tried to murder him in revenge for the death of his brother 'lleis Delamir Shah. DaCunha, who had been informed of Rashid s former servic , promised him his protection and subsequently took him with him to Honnnz where he obtamed his appointment as Wazir in place of Reis Shereef, who was despatched to Lisbon in nons answer for his alleged crimes before the King. The current ot affairs on the Arab and Persian coasts appears to have flowed on now for some years with tranquillity, during which period Sohar and Kilhat, and perhaps othei places, were occupied, fortified, and garrisoned. The system adopted by the Portuguese in these places was to retain their political supre macy by holding the citadel or fort which overawed and commanded the town, but they did not interfere with the internal administration, and the people were left to govern themselves in respects as they pleased, even in the towns which had Portuguese garrisons. For some forty years the all-powerful Turks had striven spasmodically to destroy the i PArfno-ql in the East but they do not appear to have extended growing power J th M 15 ic, when tour Turkish galliots, after destroy- theii ^pm^tions to^h^Persutn^Gnlt ^ ^ y ^ ^ ^ ^ iron shot ot a prodigious size into the place and causing terrible consternation, but not mnc TnlshToeeedings in having ottered their town and built a castle there, and to implore the i J34 ADMDTI.STEATIOK REPOBT OF THE PERSIAN' GULF POLITICAL proKction of ^Portagtuse. This eTentoallj issued for the vessels engaged in craL-iD 0 ] Man deb to touch occasionally at Dhofar. Ihe second appearance of the Turks was in 1552, six years later, when a more formidable fleet, under Piri Pasha, Capudan of Egypt, which had been despatched from Lgypt by the Sultan in retaliation for the assistance rendered by the fleet under Dom Antao de^oronha to the rebel Arabs at Busrah the year before, anchored in the port of Muscat. Ihe in-tructions given to the Piri Pasha had b^en to proceed direct to Busrah, and from thence, in conjunction with the force awaiting him there, to sail to Hormuz and reduce it to submission. The com mandant of Hormuz, Alvaro de Noronha, on hearing of the intended expedition, despatched one of his men in disguise to Shehr to collect information ; the spy confirmed the report, whereupon Noronha ordered'two vessels to watch Ka-el-Had, and on sighting the Turkish fleet to set sail with the news, one for Goaand the other for Hormuz. Piri Pasha after some months of pre parations set sail from Suez in July 1552, his fleet consisting of oO sail^ galWs, Bashdeider golletas, and galleons. On pearing the Gulf of Oman he sent forward his son with five ships to reconnoitre; this advanced guard nearly captured Noronha^s two vesselfi, but they managed to escape and carried the news to Goa and Hormuz. In the chase of one of these vessels, Piri ; s son had been led as far as Ras Mussendom, and on turning back he found his father had already arrived with the rest of the fleet and had anchored at Muscat. The commandant of Muscat at this time was Dom Joao Da Lisboa, who had been sent out specially by the King of Portugal with orders to erect a fortress to command the town and harbour. This fort had only been commenced about three months previously and was still unfinished ; the Governor, however, well knowing that the Turks would attack him, hastily pro visioned it and threw himself into it with his little garrison of 60 men, after sending off his wife and other ladies in a boat to Hormuz. The first action of the Turkish Admiral was to sack the town, which was undefended. He then turned his attention to the fort, which, as it was too strong for assault, laid siege to and managed to bombard by hauling one of his guns up to a height which commanded it. For eighteen days the Portuguese defended themselves vigorously, but provisions and water having failed, the Govern r was induced by a renegade named John deBarrea in the employ of Piri Pasha to open negociations for the surrender of the fort. An interview was accord ingly arranged between Piri Pasha and the Governor, at which the Pasha solemnly guaranteed the life and liberty of the garrison on the condition of immediate capitulation, declaring that the honour of capturing a Portuguese fort was sufficient for him. The faithless Turk, however, did not abide by his promises, for, after massacring the other prisoners, he treacherously chained da Lisboa and part of the garrison to the galleys. Piri Pasha having shipped his booty and the Portuguese guns, sailed for Hormuz, where he landed and plundered the town without resistance. The fort, however, held out, and the Pasha after bombarding 1 it for 20 days, and finding he could make no impression, was obliged to raise the siege. An offer made by the Pasha to hold his Muscat prisoners to ransom''was declined by the Governor, Alvaro deNoronha, but the Turk nevertheless generously released the wife of Dom Joao daLkboa, who had been captured off Khar Fakan, while endeavouring to effect her escape. The delay caused by the protracted operations at Muscat had afforded an opportunity to the merchants of Hormuz of removing their families and property to the Island of Kishm of which full advantage had been taken ; thither accordingly Piri Pasha now steered hi s fleet 'and waa rewarded by the d.scovery of immense booty. He took many captives, including a Spanish Jew named Solomon, who was reputed to be the richest merchant of Hormuz. Meanwhile the Portuguese fleet despatched from Goa had arrived in the Gulf and .oon cha^l the Turks ura. Basra but Piri Pasha fearful of losing the treasure he had acquired, abandoned his command and fled to Egypt w.th three galleys, where he was immediately seized and put to death, a report of his conduct having reached the Sultan from Basra.

Had the Turks been able to foresee more clearly the dire results in the future to their empire from the change in the course of trade effected by the Portuguese they would doubtless have put forth the utmost of their strength in the East and combined with the Asiatics to expel their rivals from India. Being then in the plenitude of their strength, they might thus possibly have kept Europeans out of the Indian Ocean for many a year to come. The battle of Lepanto had not yet been fought, and the Turks were still supposed to be invincible at sea in Europe; but not even the genius of Suliman the Great, who now reigned at Stamboul, seems to have grasped the vital importance to himself of crushing the Portuguese enterprise in the East. He struck one final blow at them, however, before relinquishing the contest and leaving the Portuguese to enjoy the fruits of their discoveries and monopoly. It so happened that this final struggle was also the most hardly contested and decisive sea fights in which the Turks had till then been engaged. It foreshadowed the disasters of Lepanto, and is descubed by the Turkish historian as a greater affair than the battle between Barbarossa and the allied fleet under the Spanish Admiral Andrea Doria, fought off Prevesa in the Mediterranean in 1538. The remainder of Moorad's ill-fated squadron formed the nucleus of the new fleet, the organization and command of which were entrusted by Sultan Suliman to the Capudan of Egypt, Sidi Ali-bin-Hoosain. At the close of the year 1553, having arrived at Basra by way of Aleppo and Mosul, Sidi Ali at once commenced his preparations, and in July 1554 set sail from Basra. The Grovernor of this city, Mustapha Pasha, who had been despatched by the Porte with a frigate to Hormuz, had informed the Capudan Sidi Ali that the infidels had only four ships, and the Capudan, expecting an easy conquest, pressed on in eager search through the Straits of Mussendom. The Portuguese fleet was first sighted by him off the port of Khor Eakan; but it was much larger than he had been led to anticipate, for it consisted of three galleons, four barges, six guard-ships, and twelve golletas. The story of the fight that ensued is thus told by Mitchell from the Turkish of Hajji Khalifa :— ' The Moslems immediately hoisted their colours, weighed anchor, and got in readiness all their warlike machines. With flags hoisted and sails spread, and looking in confidence to the Supreme Being, they set up Muhammadan shouts and commenced an attack the fierceness of which baffles description. By the favour of God their fire struck one of the Portuguese galleons, which was wrecked on the Island of Fak-al-Asad. They fought bravely till nightfall, when the Capudan hoisted the lights. The infidels, however, fired a gun as the signal of ' retreat and fled to Hormuz. Thus by the favour of God the victory was left to the Moslems, who, favoured by the winds, departed next day for the city of Khor Fakan, where the troops took in a supply of fresh water, and after 17 days' sailing arrived in the neighbourhood of Muscat and Kilhat. ' On the morning of the 26th Ramzan (26th August 1554) the Captain of Goa, the son of the Governor, left the harbour of Muscat, and with his barges, guard-ships, and galleon, with their mainsails spread and colours flying, sailed against the Moslems, who, still trusting in God, remained near the shore prepared for battle. The enemy's barges first came up and attacked the galleys, when a sharp fire was opened on both sides and a furious engagement ensued. The infidels then began to shower down their hand-grenades from the maintops upon the galleys, one of which and a barge which was near it they burnt by throwing a bomb into the galley: five -alleys and as many barges were driven ashore and lost. Another barge was driven ashore by the violence with which the wind beat against it and was lost. At length the sailors and the troops on both sides were exhausted, the former being unable to pull at the oars and the latter to work the guns any longer : they were obliged there- fore to cast anchor ; but even in this position they fought for some time with springs to the cables. They were finallv obliged to abandon their boats. Elmshah Reis Kara Mustaffa and Kalfat Mumi, the commanders of the lost galleys, and Durzi Mustaffa Beg, the commander of the volunteers, with about 200 Egyptian soldiers, reached the shore in safety and afterwards returned to the fleet, bringing with them many Arabs to the assistance of the Moslems The infidels also recovered their men who were in the barges which had been driven ashore. This battle was even greater than that between Khair-ud-Deen and Andrea Doria. Few soldiers are known to have ever been engaged in such a fight. At last, when night approached, a strong gale began to Wow and each of the barges threw out two stream anchors; but the men on board were so overcome with fatigue that they were obliged to stand out from the shore and sail before the wind. In this way they came to the coast of Bar Jask, w here, finding plenty of sea, they succeeded in reaching Bander Shahbar in Mekran. Here they took in water, and by the direction of a pilot reached Bunder Gwadur.' The Turks, in short, were completely defeated, and there was no mincing matters. The decisive effect of the victory is shown by the fact that they never more confronted the Portuguese Navy in the Indian Ocean. Sidi Ali, after some adventures, w^as wrecked in a storm and had to abandon his vessels at Surat, from whence he returned to Constantinople overland four years afterwards. This notable sea-fight took place off Fahil, a rocky islet about 6 miles from Muscat, which was henceforth called by the Portuguese the ff Island of Victory.'36 administeation eepokt of the peesian gulp political From this time maritime affairs appear tufdThe Gulf; the Portuguese remained undisputed mas t » o£ the p cl , sians fleet o£ the Grand Turk doubtless had a sobering effect u P on ^ 0 - and Arabs, for we have no reeord of any exciting events for ueaily thirty years. In the year 1580 news reached the Gulf that an expedition was being prepared at Aden for the purpose of ravaging Muscat. The rumour was not credited by the Governor of Hormuz Dom Gon^les, but he nevertheless gave warning to the garrison at Muscat to be watchfu and ready. The Governor of Muscat, on the other hand, was fully convinced of the truth of the report, which had been confirmed to him by the Arabs; he knew also that the cheme had emanated from the neighbourhood of Muscat itself; his enemies having conveyed intimation to the Governor of Yemen, a renegade Italian named Mirat -al-Zaman that immense booty would reward the enterprise. He therefore made due preparations for defence and stationed a swift vessel off Ras-el-Had to bring tidings of the corsairs. The filibustering expedition, consisting of four galleys under the command of Meer Ah Beg, left Aden at the end of August 1580; in passing along the Arabian coast one of the galleys foundered, but the rest continued the voyage, and giving Ras-el-Had a wide berth, by which they eluded the vigilance of the scout Alvaro Murato, arrived off Muscat on the evening of the 22nd September. Instead of entering the harbour, however, Ali Beg proceeded to the little bay and village of Sedab, where he quietly landed with 150 men and sent the galleys round to Muscat with instructions to appear before the city at dawn and commence an imme diate bombardment, making at the same time a feigned attempt to land to distract attention. During the night Ali Beg with his band of robbers made his way over the Sedab Pass to the walls of the town, and having posted a party at each of the three gates^ waited patiently until the morning broke, and the guns of his galleys in the harbour gave the signal for attack. Meanwhile the inhabitants, having received no warning from Alvaro Murato, and half doubting the threatened danger, had refrained from sending their wives and goods to si place of safety, and were now slumbering in their houses unconscious of their danger. An accident revealed the presence of the enemy. A merchant named Diogo Machado, desiring to bury his treasure outside the town, came to one of the gates in the night, and passing through it was stabbed by the robbers and relieved of his bag of ducats ; his servant fled back in the town and gave the alarm, and almost simultaneously the three galleys entered the harbour and opened a cannonade. The Portuguese residents in Muscat at this time numbered altogether, it is said, about 500 souls, of whom 70 were able to bear arms. At first the utmost confusion prevailed, then, while some hastened to the gates to oppose the Turkp, others fled out of the town with the women and children over the Riam and Kalboo Passes to Muttrah, where they took refuge. It cost Ali Beg little trouble to overcome the feeble resistance of the Portuguese, and he was then at leisure to sack the town, which he did effectually with the hearty assistance of the Arabs and slaves of the Portuguese, who no doubt cordially detested their masters. Ali Beg spent the day in the work of pillage, and having taken possession of three Portuguese vessels that were lying in the harbour, loaded them with his booty and set sail for Aden. Directly Dom Gon9alo deMenezes heard of Ali Beg's attack on Muscat he sent Luiz d'Almeyda with a squadron consisting of a galleon, a galley, and six smaller vessels to intercept and destroy Ali Beg s flotilla. But Almeyda, either not caring to face the enemy, or led away perhaps by hopes of enriching himself with plunder, sailed to Mekran, where he looted Pussnee, Gwadur, and Teez. Ali Eeg's success was the cause of his ruin. He began to undertake piratical expeditions against the east coast of Atriea, and in 1589 was captured at Mombasa by Thome deSouza Continho, who sent him a prisoner to Lisbon, where he turned Christian and died.

It was completed io 1587 and called Sam Jao, now known to the Arabs as Jelali. The fort left unfinished by duLisboa thirty years before, on the west side of the town, was brought to completion in the following year, 1588, and was named Fort Capitan. Its present name is Merani. In the year 1616 a force was despatched from Goa against Sohar to act m co operation with an Arab Chief, the Ameer Umeyr -bin-Himyar.who had sought the Portuguese alliance and had probably instigated the enterprise. Besides a land force from Muscat, the expedition was joined by a uumber o£ ships from Hormuz laden with stores and munitions o£ war. After some indecisive skirmishing between the Arabs in front of Sohar, the Portuguese landed their men and guns and commenced to bombard the fort, using gabions stuffed with cotton for the seige batteries. The walls were soon breached, and the fort was then carried by assault the Arab garrison routed and dispersed, and the town burned to the ground. The Portuguese henceforward remained in undisputed possession of the place and the Ameer Umeyr, having gained his object, retired to Nakhl. This took place on the 16th Marc a. The Portuguese now found themselves confronted by foes of a different calibre to the Asiatics they had hitherto had to deal with. The Dutch and English had appeared in the East to contest the supremacy by the sea, to grasp their share of the commerce, and eventually, as it turned out, to overthrow their Eastern Empire. Many and severe were the engagements that ensued between these three nations, but the Portuo-uese power had already begun to wane and could not long sustain the unequal contes . The orientul navigations of the English commenced towards the close of the sixteenth century, and it was not very lono- before they felt strong enough to venture into the Gulf as rivals with the Portuguese for 'the Persian trade. In 1613, the ship of 260 tons, with the Ambassador to Persia, Sir Thomas Shirley, on board, arrived at Gwadur from whence Sir Thomas proposed to march up to the capital, Ispahan, overland. A plot of the treacherous Belooches to murder the whole Embassy and crew of the Expedihon was, however, fortu nately discovered in time, and the vessel proceeded on to India. On the way they captured a terada of 15 tons having a pass from the Governor of Muscat, which was transcribed as show ing to what subjection the Portuguese had reduced the maritime trade of the Gulf, allowing no vessel large or small, to navigate the sea without their pass. The first encounter between the English and Portuguese, in the ^If o£ Oman, appears to have taken place in 16:Z0, in which year a fleet, consisting of the London 800 tons Hart W tons Roebuck 300 tons, and the Eagle ^80 tons, sailed from Tilbury Hope for Surat, from wheuc^ two of the ships, the Rart and V, -t out for Jask. Here they found the Portuguese fleet sent purposely from Lisbon to oppose the English trade with Persia, waiting to intercept Ind attack them, Ld, judging themselves unable to cope wuh it were fhem for reinforcements, when they met the London and on the way to join them. The four ships together then steered for Jask, where they arrived on loth December 1620, havino- captured on the road, on the 21st November, a Portuguese ship of 200 tons bound fiom Mosclt to Chaul with a cargo of horses. The Portuguese fleet consisted of two galleons one of which was larger than the London, two galleots and ten frigates under the command of Geneia Dom Rny F-re daAndrada. the Vice- Admiral being Joal Bornlho. There were also two Dutch n-alleons, one commanded by Ant. Mescpritta and the other by Balthazar deChaves. O the 16th the English were engaged in fitting up their prize as a fire-ship, but as it fell calm the lotn tne » e ' able to excll!iage lon g sho ts with the enemy. The breeze sprint up the following morning, the Portuguese, who had the weather gage, weighed and closed The battle began at 9 A.M.. and continued without intermission for nine hours ; the two fleets manceuvering and exchanging broadsides until night coming on the smaller Dutc hip pressed by the Roebuck, turned tail and fled, and was soon followed by the rest of the Dutch and Portuguese fleet, which disappeared in the darkness. The English ships anchored for the night in the road. The prize that had been fitted up as a hre-ship had been fired early in the day but had failed through mismanagement. The advantage, however remained wit L Enri sh who lost only one man, and had but little damage done to their sh.ps, while the Portugese lost their Admiral Boralho and thirty men in one ship alone. The next morning the Portuguese were discovered in the offing, to the eastward, from whence they made no attempt to renew the engagement, but remained there during the next ten days watching the English and occupied in obtaining supplies and reinforcements from Muscat, 4 le ' 0 ^ This harass and delay the English and prevent them prosecuting their trade with Persia. Th FabTan policy suited them well, as Hormuz, their base of operations, was near at hand, wh.le the English had no port nearer than Surat to retire to.38 ADMINISTEATION EEPOET OF THE PERSIAN GULF POLITICAL In the meantime the English landed their cargoes at Jask, and on the 28th December, having determined on renewing the contest, anchored within a cable and a half of their opponents and opened a heavy broadside fire. The action continued until 3 p.m ., w len t e ortu^uese cut their cables and steered off. The English then remained in undisturbed possession of Jask, the Portuguese being no more seen. In the following May the English fleet left Surat, whither it had proceeded in February, to pass the monsoon at the Island of Maseera, where they arrived on the 2nd June 1621. On the 6th July they heard that the London was lying at Soor, having watered at Teywee, where they had lost their Surgeon and Chaplain^s servant, who had been surprised ami taken prisoners by the Portuguese and Arabs. The Hart and Roehuck therefore left Maseera and joined the London at Soor on the 6th August, from whence they all returned soon after to Surat. On the 14th November of the same year another English expedition, consisting of five ships and four pinnaces, was despatched from Surat to the Persian Gulf to encounter the Portuguese fleet and to obstruct their trade. This fleet arrived in sight of Hormuz on the 23rd Decem- ber, and the result of the expedition was the capture of that fortress and entrepot in conjunc tion with a Persian army on the 23rd May 1622. This important event was a staggering blow to the Portuguese and commenced the disruption of their empire in the East. The Persians had no sooner possessed themselves of Hormuz than they turned their attention to Muscat and Sohar. The occupation of the latter place appears to have been easily accomplished, but for the capture of Muscat the aid of a maritime power was requisite, and negociations were accordingly set on foot with the English commander. Being reluctant to enter on this service he demanded exorbitant terms; these were that Hormuz should be given over to the English with half the revenues of the Customs House and city, the English to maintain four ships there for the protection of trade in the Gulf. The terms were not acceptable to the Persians, who were as jealous of the English as they had been of the Portu guese, and preferred to see Hormuz ruined and desolate rather than flourishing in the hands of infidels. The negociations accordingly fell through, but the English commander was ready to sell to the Persians, who had determined to carry on the war in Oman alone, a small frigate which was damaged and of no use to himself. The Persian expedition against Muscat appears to have taken place in March 1623, for in the next month we find that the Viceroy at Goa de spatched Ruy Frere deAndrada with six ships to the relief of Muscat and arranged for further reinforcements to follow from Chaul and Diu to continue the war against the Persians. Ruy Frere was not only successful in relieving Muscat, but felt strong enough to assume the offensive and attempt the recovery of Sohar. He proceeded thither with sixteen ships, and, having landed his men, assaulted the fort, which had been in the meantime strengthened by the Persians. The first attack was repulsed with a loss of 21 men and 4 officers; he neverthe less continued to besiege it, and at length the Persians were compelled to capitulate and marched out with the honours of war. Sohar was razed, and Ruy Frere then sailed on to Khor Fakan, also held by the Persians, which he soon stormed and took, putting the inhabitants to the sword. Euy Frere now determined to proceed with the chief object of his expedition, the recap- ture of Hormuz. He accordingly established a blockade of the island, which h J maintained with great vigour and persistency for about six months, and, notwithstanding the inadequacy of his force, reduced the garrison to such distress from want of provisions that they were almost on the point of capitulation. Meanwhile the Viceroy ut Goa was engaged in eolleeting an increase of armament for there-conqnest of Hormuz, designing, as rnmoui- said (and the slowness of his preparations lent colour to the slander), to arr.ve in time to reap the glory of its capture after Ruy Frerc had reduced the defenders to straits. The Viceroy's scheme, however, over-reached itself,' for he pro crastmatcd so long that Ruy Prcr., being unsupported and in want of provisions himself was compelled to raise the siege and retire to Muscat. .. ^ Tr ^ t firS ' Squ f °n o f ^ f-t armada against Hormuz, consisting of ten ships, left Goa for Muscat under Sancho de Toar, and shorflv r , despatched. Besides these, 3 galleons were ordered from Mozambinue to' 0 ™ V S were Ruy Frere remained at Muscat waiting for the reinforcements but W n.

This changed the aspect of affairs, and Iluy Frere was a second time compelled to withdraw his hand when the fruit was almost within bis grasp. He retired first to Larek, and from thence to Khor El-Shem, intending to wait for the expected main body of the flee from Goa. He was doomed to disappointment. The European enemies of the Portuguese were now too powerful in the Gulf to permit them to regain their old supremacy, and all hopes of the re -conquest of Hormuz had to be abandoned. But although Hormuz was lost, Muscat still remained, and no efforts were spared by the Portuguese to force the trade of the Gulf to this place and to raise it to the same commercial grandeur as Hormuz. It was all in vain; for their reputation was against them, and while the native merchants feared to trust them, the English, who were rapidly gaining the ascend ancy in the Gulf, did their best to concentrate the trade at Basra and Gombroon. The popu lation of the town, however, became at once largely augmented, and the Arab tribes m the vicinity, who had always been kept on good terms by the payment of subsidies, were further propitiated. By the fall of Hormuz the connection existing between that island and the Oman coast which had existed for three and a half centuries came to an end, though it is related that Muhammad Shah, the nephew of the old King of Hormuz, was brought to Muscat by the Portuguese who endeavoured to compel the coast Arabs to recognise him as their king. Among the improvements undertaken at this time in Muscat were the rebuilding of the town wall extending from Booma Salih to Bab Methaib, and the excavation of the fosse beyond; a new customs house and a landing-place and dock at the creek. Further protection also was afforded to the town by the erection of the towers at the passes of Kalboos, lliam, and Sedab. In 162-3,^6 Governor of Muscat was Martino Alfonso deMello; this officer resided for the most part of the year in the factory or ' Gareyza,' but during the hot weather he occupied Fort Capitan, which was at this time deemed of more importance than Fort Sam Joao (Jelali), the former citadel. There were two churches, one of which was the see of the Vicar, generally an Augustinian friar and dedicated to the Virgem del Rozario; and the other, called Delia Gratia, was the property of the Augustinians, four of whom resided in it. As Hormuz had been lost to Portugal during the vigorous reign of a great king. Shah Abbass, so Muscat and the Oman coast were wrested from her grasp by the force of a national impulse, engendered by the rise of a new dynasty. After ten years of anarchy, Nasir-bin-Murshid-el-Yaareby, one of the strongest rulers Oman ever had, was elected Imam in 1624. He soon made himself master of, and tranquillised, the interior, and then set to work to expel the Christians. He first sent his troops against Muscat, but was defeated and obliged to retire. Shortly after, the Portuguese assisted the Chief of Lawa, Saif-bin-Muhammad, with troops and stores against the Imams foices. In this affair the allies of the Portuguese were worsted and the Imam captured the fort. The Imam then collected another army, in command of which he placed Mesood-bin-Ramzan, whom he ordered to march against Muscat. The author of the annals of Oman states that the Arabs captured and demolished the high towers of Muscat, and that the Portuguese sued for peace and agreed to the conditions imposed on them. But it is clear that the Arabs were in fact repulsed. After driving the Persians and the Portuguese from Ras -el-Khyma, the ImSm ordered Hafiz -bin-Saif to erect a fort at Sohar against that held by the Portuguese, which he v.gor- ouslv besieged for some time with a force composed of the Bem Khahd, Bern Lam, and El Amoor tribes, hut apparently without success, for the Kdzi, Kham.s-b.n-Saeed, soon after pro- eeeded to Muttrah to treat for peace with the Portuguese Governor, and agreed to abandon the siege of Sohar. This was in July 1633. ° In the same or following year the ImiJm attacked Soor and Kooriyat, and recovered both those places by which he made himself master of the whole of Oman, except Muscat and Sohar. Even the latter town, however, fell ultimately to the arms of tins energetic prince, and at his death, in April 1649, Muscat alone remained in the hands of the Portuguese. The Imam Nasir was succeeded by the Irnim Sultan-bin-Saif. who is said to have waged war on the Christians in Muscat, and to have personally conducted the operations against them until God gave him the victory. It seems, indeed, that he undertook the campaign immediately on his accession, and that he was engaged in it for about two years The circumstances and date of the struggle, however, do not appear to have been recorded by the Arab chronicler; and as the Portuguese historians are also silent on the subject, they remain matters of-10 conjecture, which will not he finally cleared np probably nntil the archives at Lisbon have been made to disclose their secrets. The only two contemporary authors I know of who mention a date arc the Editor of Hajji Khalifa s Geography aud the Wazccr of Sanaa. The former, m h.s cd.t.on of the Jehan Nama,' says :— ■'The Portuguese had long heen in possesion of this fortress Muscat, hut towards the year WO (1659), a fakeer with his followers took it from them aud made slaves of all the Portuguese ,n ,t, and possessed h.mself of their ships. Since then the priuee of Muscat has been always at war with the Portuguese. The Wazeer in his Diary says :— 'In the year 1052 (1642) a number of merchants set out on a venture to Hasa, Bahrein, and Basra, and when they bad passed tbe sea of Fars and had reached Bunder Muscat, which was then in the hands of the Franks, tbey were plundered by the latter. People became afraid therefore to pass that way. The Ocean also became closed to seafarers and remained so until the Omanis possessed themselves of Muscat, as will be recorded presently. When the Moslems occupied Muscat, trade was re-opened to merchants and they obtained security against those wretches. And in the year 1054 (1644) the rulers of Om^n, the Kharejites, the Ibadbis, became possessed of Muscat, which is on the coast of their country, and had been up to that time in the hands of the Franks. They had no idea they would be able to take it, but they ordered every one in it to be slaughtered with knives which they had concealed for the purpose. All that were in the forts were accordingly killed.' It will be seen there is a difference of fifteen years between the dates given in these accounts. In 1672, the French traveller, Dellon, visited Muscat, and remarks that the Portuguese had lost Muscat by the avarice of a Governor who sold provisions to the Arabs at an exorbitant price, but he mentions no date. Hamilton, who visited Muscat towards the close of the seventeenth century, says in his new account of the East Indies that Muscat was captured in 1650, and he gives a very circumstantial account of the siege and surrender of the town and forts, which he states he received from the mouth of one of the survivors, a very old man. Niebuhr, in his travels, merely observes that Muscat was taken by the Portuguese in 1508 and held for 150 years, while the Abbe Raynal states that the Portuguese lost it in 1648. Dr. Badger, author, tells a romantic story about the stratagem of a traitorous banian whose daughter the Portuguese Governor wished to espouse. One of several objections to this story is that the banians have never brought their wives to Arabia, much less their unmarried daughters. Another local tradition, mentioned by Ross in his annals of Oman, is that the Arabs entered Muscat in the guise of peasants, with their arms concealed in bundles of firewood, and that they took the opportunity of the garrison being at chapel to attack and massacre them! This account seems to coincide with that given by the Wazeer of Sanaa. It is impossible to reconcile these conflicting statements or to decide between so many authorities, but I am dis posed myself to accept the version of Hamilton and to agree with Dr. Badger in fixino 1 the date at 1651. 0 0 The few Portuguese that escaped the massacre that ensued on the capture of the town and fort® 'ook refuge on board the vessels in the harbour. Two of these, however, were captured by the Arabs, and the rest retired to Kalbuh, the gnns in the forts of Capitan and St John which were now turned against them, preventing their stay in Muscat cove.

Grain. —The year ISSl disappointed the expectations which its opening months tended to raise as regards trade in South Persia. Unusually large rainfall in the cultivating season of 1883-84 gave hopes of a splendid harvest, but later in the season unfavourable conditions of weather caused a partial blight of the grain, which turned out of a harder description than usual, with a large proportion of shrivelled grains. There occurred, however, no scarcity of corn, as, besides a surplus of the 1884 crops available for exportation, a good deal of the 1883 grain had been kept back. That shipments were on a moderate scale was due chiefly to the fall of prices in European markets. In the early part of 1884, London prices were good for well-cleaned wheat, but harvests everywhere having turned out abundant, prices soon began to fall, and a reduction of 20 per cent, was observable from February to August. In December a rise occurred, and the year 1885 opened more favourably for the grain trade. Persian agriculturists have the habit of mixing barley largely with wheat, sometimes to the proportion of 50 per cent., and as only well-cleaned wheat was saleable last|year in London, some Persian merchants, who neglected the precaution of sifting, suffered losses. Wheat is now cleaned by machinery in Bushire. It is remarked that the fluctuations of prices of grain in European markets do not, to a corresponding extent, influence the local prices in Persia. The operations of British merchants in exportation of wheat have been Igreatly hampered, and, in fact, when very low prices ruled in London, completely stopped, by levy of export duty both at the small outports such as Bunder Reeg and Deelam, and also at Bushire, in addition, on final exportation. Large quantities of grain are purchaseable at Eeeg and Deelam, though the wheat is said, as a rule, to be inferior in quality to that brought from Dashti and other districts to the south. Opium. The next most important produce is opium. The crop of last year was consider ably damaged by rain, and the yield was under the average and prices in the interior kept high. Less was consequently shipped to London than usual. The Persian opium is said to be less adulterated now than formerly, and to be therefore more popular in European and Ameri can markets, competing well with Turkish opium. Hostilities in China increased the demand for Persian opium in that quarter. Cotton. —The cotton grown in Persia is handicapped as an export by want of cheap carriage, and cannot be sent to England, but only to the cheaper maiket of Bombay. Tobacco. —Tobacco exportation is on the increase, and is of some importance. Imported goods.— trade in imported goods was unimproved, and European firms operated on a smaller scale and for a very small margin of profit. Especially was this the case in copper, sugar, mexicans, yarn, and shirtings. There was in the summer much depression in the piece goods trade, the demand being very small. It is remarkable that trade in chintzes is increasing in importance. This fact appears to support the opinion of the legation agent at Ispahan as to the cause of decrease of importation of indigo there, mentioned in Mr. Dickson's report dated 31st October 1884. Mr. Aganoor stated that whereas the peasantry formerly wore stout T cloths dyed with indigo, they now used fancy prints, which went to show an increase of prosperity amongst that class of the population. Increase of piece goods.— the same report Mr. Dickson explains that the large increase in the importation of piece goods and loaf sugar in recent yeais to Ispahan is not due to an increase of the trade of Persia generally, but to the diversion of the channel for trade from the north to the south of Persia, owing to the virtual prohibition on the transit of foreign goods through Russian territory, and also from the fact that the cheapness of freight and general facilities of the sea route from Europe to the Persian Gulf have diverted goods from the Turkish route to Bushire. Those best acquainted with the facts state that Russian goods have nearly disappeared from the markets of Shiraz and Ispahan. The bounty granted by the French Government on sugar refined in France has had the effect of supplanting the former trade in soft sugars from Java. Large imports occur of French beet-root sugar at Bunder Abbass and Bushite. This may be greatly due to low prices ruling in Europe and to the prohibitory taxation in the Caucasus. It is, however.42 administeation eepoet or the peesian gulf political thought that the move general use of refined loaf sngar indicates improvement in the condition of the population of Persia. „ , , The most cnrsory pernsaJ of the trade reports of this Residency for the past ten years or so will show that in that period there has heen a very remarkable rncrease of the trade of South Persia generally. The toll value of the Bushire trade appears to have about doubled or m rough numbers risen from ten to twenty millions of rupees. The trade of the second sea port. Bunder Abbass, has increased in round numbers from three to e.ght mrlhons of r upees. The customs revenues of Bushire were farmed out in 1884 for krans 800 000, being double the amount realized ten years back. The customs revenues of Bunder Abbass were 1884 for krans 701,500, showing a similar increase. The customs lease ol Lingah has en raised in the same period from 65,0U0 to 160 ; 00(J kians. European Urns.—In former times one European firm (English) only did business in Bushire. Now there are two English firms and one Dutch firm, with agents and bianches in entral Persia and at Basra, Several British mercantile houses also do extensive business through native agents at Bushire and other places in Persia. Steamers. —The British India Steam Navigation Company's steamers run weekly from Bombay carrying mails under contract, and the Bombay-Persian Steam Navigation Company run vessels about monthlv between Bombay and Bushire-Basra. Iwo lines ot direct steamers between England and the Persian Gulf are now working, one English and one french. Many special steamers are usually chartered. During 1884 fewer than usual were taken up, owing to short harvests in Mesopotamia. The French steamers are heavily subsidized by the Government of France, and this lowers freights to the detriment of British shipping. At the same time, it is to be remarked that these French steamers carry almost exclusively English cargo, and the lowering of freights results in benefit to British manufacturers and consumers. The classes to suffer by the system are therefore British and other shipowners and French tax payers. Butch Commercial Treaty. —The Dutch-Persian commercial treaty has not, so far as known, been yet ratified. Routes, fyc. —Owing to the steady friendly pressure brought to bear on the Shah by the British Minister, the subject of improving the trade routes in South Persia has been at last favour- a bly entertained and seriously taken up. A cart or caravan road is to be opened from Dizful by Khoramabad to connect Mohammerah and Teheran. Other schemes, such as improving the communication from Bushire to Shiraz, by opening the Firozabad road to traffic, have been mooted. It is not without significance that such ideas are seriously discussed by Persian authorities and merchants. Naphtha springs. The Dutch firm of Hotz and Son has obtained the concession to work the petroleum or naphtha springs of Daliki, and borings have been made. The quality and quantity of oil obtainable is not yet known. The customs of all Persia have of late been farmed from the Shah by the Ameen-es-Sultan who places agents at the principal towns. This system has led to a conflict of interests be tween the administrative authorities of Pars and the customs authorities. Foreign merchants are sufferers from this clash, and their operations at small ports of wheat-growing districts are hampered and obstructed. The head of the customs houses insists on levying 5 per cent, duty on a grain exported from Bushire, and declines to acknowledge receipts for duty levied at outports. The petty chiefs of those ports, however, and the Government of Pars, are naturally intent on continuing the levy of duty, in some form or other, at the outports, and although strict orders are said to he issued that such duty is not to be levied, various indirect means and j^ZeTr^DX merchants are stii1 sabjected 40 a doubk ^ Pearljishing, -The pearl diving was prodnetive in 1884.

PART IV. TRADE. The statistics of trade for the past year as received from the Muscat Custom-house are shewn in the accompanying returns. They are merely approximate, as the manner in which the books are kept by the customs farmer does not admit of accurate details being obtained. The farmer is, moreover, always averse from giving* precise information. The returns show a decrease of trade compared with the previous year. The chief export is dates, of which a large quantity goes to America, Southern Arabia, and East Africa. The American date trade was considerably below the average last season, owing to the New York markets being overstocked from the previous year. Import trade also shows a deciease. It is believed that trade in other parts on the Oman coast, such as boor, Mesnaah, S oh art, &amp;c., has increased in about the same ratio as it has decreased at Muscat, but no returns have been received from those ports.
