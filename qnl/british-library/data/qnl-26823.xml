December 18th, 1937* Sir, I have the honour to inform you that the 'Umm a l Qura' of December 10th. reports the ratification of the 'Saudi - Iraqi - Yemeni Treaty of Arab Alliance'. The text, except for misprints and the omission of odd words in error, is identical with that which appeared as Annexure I to the Iraq Government Gazette No. 33 dated August 15th. 1937. At the headrof this text is an official notice and a preamble, and at the end is Ibn Saud’s undertaking to observe the provisions of the treaty. I attach these additions in original and in translation. I would mention as a point of interest that in the preamble Ibn Saud refers to Muhammad as 'the Arab Prophet', a phrase I do not remember having met before in official language. 2.

Yhey had apparently enjoyed their life in Iraq and were sorry to go back to the Yemen. They were taking with them copies of all the Iraqi military text books (mostly Arabic translations of the standard British training manuals) and expected to be employed as instructors in the military school at Sana’s. 3. The five other young men, who came to Iraq at the same time, have finished their training in wireless telegraphy and they will all go back to the Yemen together in a few days time. 4.

Sir, tfith reference to my despatch No. 150 of Anril 15th, I have the honour to report that the Iraqi delegation to the Yemen returned to Bagdad on May 19th having, so it was announced, successfully carried out their mission. 2. I enclose herein an Arabic copy of the text of the instrument whereby the Imam has acceded to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance between Iraq and Saudi Arabia signed in Bagdad in Aoril 1936, which has been given to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I also enclose an English translation of this Arabic text. You will oo^erve that the instrument of accession is quite aifterent from any of the three drafts enclosed in my despatch under reference, none of which proved acceptable to the Imam. Instead of acceding with reservations in respect of certain articles, the Imam has chosen to rewrite the whole treaty, omitting passages which he disliked and adding new provisions to suit his fancy. The original Arabic of the treaty has also been subjected to many textual and grammatical alterations even in passages where no substantial change in the meaning was intended. The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc. 4./4 . Prom the international point of view the most important feature of the instrument, as His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda has already pointed out, aopears to he the omission of the provisions included in Article 4 (c) of the original treaty. For example, it now seems that, in theory, if Great Britain were to take action against Iraq in enforcement of Article 16 of the Covenant of the League or pursuant to a decision emanating from the League Council, such action might be held by the King of the Yemen to be an act of aggression and he might then, under Article 4 of the instrument of accession to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood, concert with the Iraqi Government measures to repel this act of aggression. Other hypothetical complications of this kind can be imagined, but both the / treaty itself and the Yemen act of accession offer so many ! loopholes of escape from all possible embarrassments that, in practice, I doubt whether the omission of proper safeguards is likely to give rise to any considerable \ difficulties either for Iraq or for His Majesty’s Government. а. The accession of the Yemen appears in fact to be little more than a gesture, the practical significance of which is limited to a demonstration of racial fellowship, sympathy and common interest between the two countries. б. I am sending copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda and to the Governor of Aden.

As Your Majesty aims at the same object as that aimed at by the said treaty, which from the very beginning had for its fundamental object the establishment of brotherhood and alliance between Arab countries adherence to it by the Kingdom of Yaman will have results, the importance of which Your Majesty will fully appreciate, especially in view of the present world conditions which call for close cooperation between all the Arab peoples and require that tney should prepare for emergencies* *e have no doubt that Your ajesty is gratified with the conclusion of the Treaty of Arab Bro + herhood and Alliance, which is the result of earnest endeavour, and that you will be willing to form a principal party to it.

WITH reference to my Saving telegram N o. 34 o f the 23rd November, I have the honour to inform you that in the course of a further talk about his visit to Riyadh the Minister for Foreign Affairs told me that he had discussed with King Abdul Aziz the accession of the Yemen to the Treaty of Arab Brotherhood and Alliance signed at Bagdad in April last. You will remember that article 6 provides that both signatories shall endeavour to secure the accession of the Yemen to this treaty. 2. King Abdul Aziz had said that he feared that, in view of the present suspicious attitude of the King of the Yemen towards himself, it would be of little use for him to ask His Majesty to join the alliance. He had, therefore, purpose. He had also suggested that the delegation should travel via Saudi Arabia and had promised that, in addition to making all arrangements for the journey, he would provide them with letters to King Yahya in which he would give his full support to their mission. 3. Dr. Naji-al-Asil told me that the Iraqi Government had been much taken by this proposal and had chosen Jamil Beg al Madfai to head the delegation. He hoped that they would set out on their journey quite soon, but recent news from the Yemen indicated the possibility of an outbreak of disorder, and if enquiry showed that the situation seemed likely to become serious their mission might have to be postponed. 4.

Loraine to Sir John Simon.—[Received November 28.) (No. 1030. Confidential.) Sir, Cairo, November 18, 1932. I HAVE the honour to inform you that Dr. Kadri, the Iraq consul-general, called on the oriental secretary on the 14th instant to ask his advice on a suggestion which he (Kadri) was thinking of making to King Feisal. 2. Dr. Kadri stated that he had been with King Feisal during His Majesty’s recent trip to Transjordania. The King had then given him a sort of private watching brief for Syria and Western Arabia. Dr. Kadri regarded the situation in the Yemen as disquieting. The Imam was exposed to two undesirable influences, namely, of the Soviets and of Italy. To both he was showing himself very susceptible; to that of the Soviets, mainly because he obtained supplies from them at uneconomic prices, to that of Italy because he counted on Italy’s help against Ibn Saud. The hand of Italy was probably in the Asir revolt which might or might not be supported by Imam Yehia. The entry of the Soviets and Italy into Arabia was a danger to British interests. There could be no doubt about Iraq’s interest in excluding Soviet influence. As regards Italy, the Arabs had seen too clearly how she had behaved in Tripoli to have the slightest wish that she should enter the Arabian field. It was true that Italy was anti-Ibn Saud, but Iraq preferred that Ibn Saud should remain in control of the Hejaz for the present. Iraq would gradually grow stronger, and would eventually be in a position to help the suffering tribes of the Hejaz without outside help. 3. In the above circumstances, Iraq’s interest was that the Imam Yehia should not succumb to Soviet or Italian blandishments. In Dr. Kadri’s opinion, Iraq, by diplomatic representation in the Yemen, could influence the Imam and not onlv withdraw him from Soviet and Italian toils, but also make him realise the folly of his attitude towards Aden. Dr. Kadri concluded by saying that he did not wish to make suggestions to King Feisal which might result in bringing His Majesty into opposition with the British. That was why he would appreciate our advice on the opportunity of such a suggestion. 4. In reply, Mr. Smart said that the Yemen was outside his competence, and that he could not offer any advice on the subject. He suggested, however, that the establishment of an Iraq diplomatic mission in the Y emen at this moment, when trouble was reported in Asir, might be misinterpreted by Ibn Saud. Dr. Kadri finally said that he would refrain for the present from making any suggestion to King Feisal in that sense. 5 . Dr. Kadri then went on to speak of the disastrous condition of the Hejaz owing to the exploitation by Nejd and to the decline of the pilgrimage due to Wahabi iconoclastic proclivities. He also maintained that in Nejd itself there was discontent with Ibn Saud, whose support was now mainly drawn from the towns. The tribesmen, especially those of the late Feisal-al-Dawish and of Ibn Bujad, were ready on the occurrence of any favourable diversion to break out again. In fact, both in the Hejaz and Nejd a general flare-up would follow any signally successful tribal revolt against Ibn Saud in any part of his territories. &amp; 6 . Dr. Kadri mentioned that he had seen Hafiz Amer Bey, the Egyptian consul at Jedda, who has just returned to Egypt on leave (see Mr. Hope Gill’s telegram No. 262 of the 10th November). Amer Bey had described to him the pitiful state of the Hejaz as a result of the Saudian regime. A meeting between Amer Bey and the Iraq consul-general may be quite a normal and innocent proceeding, but, in view of Amer Bey s anti-Ibn Saud reputation at Jedda, it is interesting to’note that, immediately on his return from Jedda. he should have discussed with Dr. Kadri the Saudian regime in an apparently unfriendly spirit. I am endeavouring to secure information of Amer Bey’s doings generally during his leave. * *7 / ' ' / November 28, 1932. i r '' r) j — Section 3.2 7. Dr. Kadri is perhaps inclined to attach too much importance to himself, and he may have exaggerated in suggesting that King Feisal had given him a watching-brief in Syria and Arabia. However, his brother is the King’s Master of Ceremonies, and the family seems to have been always in friendly relations with His Majesty. 8 . It would be inadvisable that mention should be made of Dr. Kadri’s visit and his statements. I judge him to be a light weight, but it would, I think, be as well not to discourage him from airing his views to the Residency, especially at a time when we are trying to keep track of any anti-Ibn Saud machinations of Arabs in Egypt. 9.

The latter is also a prominent orientalist with extensive knowledge on matters oriental. He twice visited Sana’a, and succeeded in concluding a treaty of recognition and friendship between the Italian Grovernment and the Yaman. The Secretary General, Signor Zedda, has an extensive knowledge of the affairs and history of oriental peoples. The Director General is of the nobility of Sicily. He has an excellent knowledge of French and English. Before coming to Asmara he was Secretary General in the colony of Tripolitana. Italy has only five officials in the Kingdom of Yaman: four doctors (two employed in the Sana’a Hospital and one each in the Hudaidah and Ta’z Hospitals) and one Assistant Engineer in charge of the Military Workshops in Sana’a. These officials are in the receipt of allowances from the Government of Yaman. It is believed that the Italian Government grants them additional allowances. These officials are perhaps employed under the provisions of the Annexure to the Treaty. So it is said. Italy had considerable influence in the Yaman before the coming into that country of the Russian trade missionmission and their conclusion of a treaty of recognition and trade between the Soviet Republic and the Kingdom of Yamaiu This mission’s influence has been on the increase, and they have now seized the trade of the Yaman and have killed Italian influence or nearly done so, I believe that the Italians did not place obstacles in the way of rapprochement between ’Iraq ami. the Yaman and the conclusion of the treaty. Possibly, they maintained complete neutrality in the matter. Discussions at Asmara and the Yaman, hew ever, indicated that they favoured rapprochement between the various Arab States. The great courtesy we met in Eritrea no doubt affords a striking proof of the high esteem vith which ’Iraq is held abroad. Italian Government officials * * showed the utmost courtesy during our stay in the Italian Colony, where we were the guests of the Government and the subject of her care. Obviously, the courtesy shown was not for our own persons but was intended for our State and the person of His Majesty our King. I therefore consider it my duty to suggest that Your Excellency might approach the Council of Ministers with a vir# to securing the award of A1 Rafidain Order to the Governor General of the Italian Colony of Eritrea, the Secretary General, the Director of Political Aff*irs and his Secretary, and the Commissaire of the Muhafadha of Massawa. The correct names and ranks of those officials are on record with the former Director General of Foreign Affairs, Muwaffaq Beg A1 Alusi, from whom you may ask for them.1 3b cqp.y - ■ , M ,-v ■ .t . -L^ — &lt; ,j Reference“^b previous correspondence: High Commissioner’s Despatch No. 676 dated the 30th June, 1931• No. C.O. 76 I The Residency, Baghdad• 23rd July, 1931 Sir, I have the honour to transmit to you, for information, a copy of the papers noted below on the subject of the Treaty of Friendship between ’Iraq and Yaman. 2.

The date fixed for our departure was the 13 th of April, 1931 • Before departing we telegraphed to His Majesty the Imam, King of the Yaman, informing him thereof. day and we reached Massows on the evening of the 14th/15th of April, 1931. There we learnt that the boat generally waits a week in Massowa before sailing on to Hudaidah. Consequently we were compelled to pass this week at Massowa which is the port of the Italian colony of Eritrea. On the morning of the 15 th April, the interpreter of the Governor of Massowa came to the ship and informed us that we were the guests of the Imam*s Government. We thanked him for this courtesy. We passed 5 days at Asmarah, the Capital of the Italian colony, and 2 days at Maesowa. During this time we received many courtesies and kindnesses from the officials of this colony who showed us every possible consideration and politeness of which details will be given in a separate report. Their conduct towards us REPORT ON THE v*OHK OF THE UPAql MISSION TO THE YAMAN. After I and the Director of the Ministry We went on board the ship on the appointed was a3 was a convincing evidence of the good-will of the Italian Government towards the ‘Iraqi State. The ship took us from Massowa on the 23rd April, 1931&gt; and arrived at Hhdaidah on the afternoon of the following day. There the officials of the Yamani Government were already awaiting our arrival in accordance with the orders which they had received from His Majesty the Imam to welcome us on our arrival at Hudaidah. A detachment of the Yamani troo s and a military hand and representatives of the Government received us on the quay. t'e were accommodated at the residence of His Highness Saif-ul-Islam, the Amir Mohammad, the military commander of Hudaidah. His Highness himself was absent having gone to Sana’a to pass the ‘Id with his father the Imam. The Qadhi 'All al Umarl, the Deputy Governor of Hudaidah, welcomed us on behalf of His Highness and showed us every possible kindness. That evening we telegraphed to His Majesty the Imam at Sana’a informing him of our arrival. To this His Majesty replied welcoming us and saying that he awaited our early arrival at Sana’a. We set out by motor car on the 25th of April, and travelled to Hagaila which is the first stage into the mountains of the Yaman. We arrived there in the evening and were received by the chief local official who provided accommodation for us in the post office building. On the 26th of April, we mounted mules which were provided for us and travelled to Al Ilanakhah where we arrived in the evening. That night we passed at the guest house. On the evening of the 2?th of April, we reached Suq al Khamis, andand on the afternoon of the following day we reached Boa* an where we found motor cars waiting to take us on to Sana 1 a which we reached in the afternoon. There we were made the guests of His Majesty the Imam and given quarters In one of his houses. On behalf of the Imam we were welcomed by the Qadhi, * Abdullah al Umari f the Acting Prime Minister, and the Cadhi Mohammad Baghib, the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. We asked the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs for an audience with His Majesty the Imam. w© received a reply that an audience would be granted to us in the morning of the 50th of April, 1931. On the 29th of April (that is to say, one day after our arrival in Sana* a) we telegraphed to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Baghdad vi© Eritrea reporting our arrival at Sana’a. The Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs informed us in his letter thet the audience would be official. We were taken in a motor car in the company of the Court Chamberlain to the Palace of the Imam which is called 'Par al Sa’adat”, where a brigade of infantry with a band was paraded in our honour on both sides of the entrance. They saluted us on our arrival and we were received at the entrance by the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. From there we were conducted to the Throne room at the entrance of which we were received by the Acting Prime Minister, the Qadhi ’Abdullah al Umari. A few moments later His Majesty the Imam entered and welcomed us with cordial greetings. When His Majesty was seated, I presented to him the letter of our King end delivered a short speechIcro © speech touching on the mission for which I had been appointed. A copy of the speech is attached as the first appendix to this report. His Majesty the Imam listened most attentively to my remarks and afterwards carefully read His Majesty’s letter. Following this he expressed his pleasure at the idea of Arab unity, wishing us success and expressing his readiness to assist us. His Majesty then put to me several questions concerning the £rab world, and the audience continued for over half an hour during which time the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs were both present. On our departure after this audience we were accorded the same military honours as on our arrival. Our arrival in Sane*a had coincided with the first day of the ’Id and it is the custom of the of this festival for 10 days commemorating on the 10 th day the anniversary which is known as You al Neshur which is the day on which the Prophet, on whom be peace, spoke at Ohadir Kham. &gt;v e considered it fitting that we should visit the Crown Prince -aif^ul-Islain al Amir Mohammad and his brother Saif-ul-Islam al Amir Ahmad, and that after this we should return calls on the Prime Minister and the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and on those of the officials and notables and members of the foreign colonies who had called on us. These visits occupied several days. On the $rd of May, 1931* the Prime Minister gave an official luncheon for us which we attended and to which the principal members of the people of the Yaman to continue their celebrations foreign101 r i foreign colonies were also invited. It became apparent to us during these days that intrigue had preceded our arrival in the Ya®an, and that the newspapers of 2gypt and §yria which had criticised the project of an Arab alliance had created an unfavourable atmosphere in Sana*©. It is also likely that the Fussian Commercial Mission utilised these newspaper reports to give a pro-English com plexion to our mission. We quickly realised that the people of the Yaman ©re suspicious regarding all who come from outside, especially if they should come from a country having special relations with England. It was apparent to us, therefore, that the stories which had preceded our arrival had influenced un favourably the Imam and his entourage. We accordingly considered that it was necessary to endeavour to remove these doubts from the mind of the Imam by frank dis cussions, and we asked for another audience. We were received in His Uajesty 1 s presence on the morning of the 5 th flay, on which occasion the Prime Minister was also present. His Majesty the Imam spoke openly of what had been said concerning our mission and of his own doubts in this connection. I discussed all that had been said concerning us end explained to him that the purpose which had inspired His Majesty the Cing of 'Iraq and the object for which the 'Iraqi Government were working was to bring about a rapproachment between all the Arab Kingdoms and to remove causes of dispute between them. The 'Iraqi Government had, in working for this end, already concluded treaties of friendship and\oZ. and bon voigin^ge between the Kingdoms of ‘Iraq and Trans-Jordan and between the Kingdom of ‘Iraq and the Kingdom of Najd and the Hijaz and its Dependencies, and although there were happily no differences existing between the Kingdoms of 'Iraq and the Yaraan, the 'Iraqi Government nevertheless desired to conclude a treaty of friendship with the Government of Yaman considering that these two Arab and Hohammadan Kingdoms were already bound by ties of religion, language and tradition, I explained further that it was hoped to find a solution of the outstanding differences between the Yaraan and Najd and the Hijez in a manner satisfactory to both sides and to bring about the conclusion of a treaty of friendship and bon voisinage between these neighbouring States. If this could be done, there would remain no obstacle to the conclusion of a treaty on the lines desired to which all the Arab Kingdoms could become signatories. In this manner could be laid the second stone in the desired Arab alliance* The treaties which had already been concluded between 'Iraq and Trans-Jordan and between 'Iraq and Najd and the Hijaz and that which was about to be concluded between 'Iraq and the Yaraan had already, I submitted, laid the first stone of this alliance. The Imam then spoke asking me what would the benefit to be derived from the con clusion of a treaty of friendship between 'Iraq and the Yaraan, and I replied that it would bring great moral advantages since it would proclaim to the world that a friendly entente had been concluded between these two Arab countries. In order to dispel all further doubts from the£ \o2&gt; S the mind of the Imam, I left it entirely to Kis ilajesty to decide whether he would conclude a treaty or rest satisfied with the despatch of an answer to His Majesty the King of •Iraq or to send a Yamani mission to visit •Iraq to study the conditions there. His Majesty said that he would require a short time to think over the matter. On the morning of the 9th of Hay, the Prime Minister, ’Abdullah al Umari, visited us and informed us that His Majesty the Imam had agreed to conclude a treaty and had appointed him as his representative for the negotiations. He asked us to prepare a draft. W* prepared a draft treaty in the form which is given in the second appendix to this report, We intentionally made it short and simple and did not include in it any article concerning the unification of culture or the removal of customs barriers since we did not wish that the draft should include anything likely to be an obstacle to its signature and rati fication. On the morning of the 10th of May, the Prime Minister visited us and read the draft with satisfaction raising only one small objection to the phrase 'as a preparatory measure to uniting the voice of the Arab nation and consolidating its efforts' which occurs in the preamble. He found this phrase in appropriate as there were still outstanding differences between the Yaman and Najd and the Hijaz, and he x Not translated. Aand he thought that it would be difficult to obtain the approval of His Majesty the Imam to the treaty /•v if this phrase were retained, We explained to him the necessity for giving expression in the preamble of the treaty to the desire for uniting the voice of the Arab nation and for consolidating its efforts since the purpose of the desired rapproacheraent between the Arab Kingdoms was to prepare the way for the whole nation to act and speak in unity and harmony so that in the We suggested that this sentence could be altered to express the desire of the two high contracting parties to facilitate Arabian unity. His Excellency promised to do what he could in this matter and took the draft to submit it to His Majesty the Iraara. On the 11th of May, we met again in the house of the Prime Mini$ter : where we were informed that His Majesty the Imam had accepted the draft treaty subject only to very slight amendment of the preamble. This was only the addition of the following phrase: ^as a preliminary to the efforts of 'the Islamic leaders to unite the 'voice of the Arab nation.' It was explained that His Majesty as a religious leader desired to see all leaders of the Islamic faith working together to unify the voice of the Arab nation, and he was convinced that these leaders would work for that end. Seeing that the way was now clear for the conclusion of the treaty, we accepted this amendment and we prepared two fair copies!o copies of the treaty which we signed, one copy remaining with the Yamani representative, while we retained the other. After this we telegraphed via Sritrea to the ?£inistry for Foreign affairs, reporting our signature of the treaty and our intention to sail from Hudaidah on the 23rd of May, which was the date on which the ship which was to take us to Bgypt was due to arrive. We visited His Majesty the Imam on the 12th of May, and thanked him for his agreement to the conclusion of the treaty, and His Majesty in his turn expressed his pleasure and gratification with tho treaty which had been signed. He explained that the amendment which he had proposed to the original draft in no way altered the spirit in which the treaty had been drafted. /fter this His Majesty entertained us to lunohoon on which occasion the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, His Majesty^ nine sons and the notabilities of the foreign colonies were also present. On the morning of the 18th of May, we paid our farewell visit to His Majesty the Imam. On this occasion we were again received with full military honours and received from His Majesty a private letter to His Majesty our King. His Majesty expressed to us his sincere and good wishes for the happiness of ’Iraq and the prosperity of the ’Iraqi people. We returned thanks to His Majesty for his great kindness to us, for his good wishes for the happiness of the ’Iraqi nation and for the most generous kindness and hospitality which we hadr we had received in His Majesty*s territory from all His Majesty 1 s officials. On the morning of the 19th of llay, we set out on motor cars from Sana* a being accompanied to the outskirts of the town by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Chamberlain. We passed the night of the 19th/20th at Mafhaq and the night of the 20th/21st at /I Manakhah. On the evening of the 21st May, we reached Hudaidah where we were again accommodated in the residence of His Highness Saif-ul-Islam the Amir Mohammad, the Covemor of Hudaidah. The Assistant Governor, Qadhi •All al Umari, informed us that His Majesty the Imam had made a present to His Majesty tCing Faisal of 1,000 kilos of the best Yamani coffee. On the morning of the 24th of May, we set sails from Hudaidah receiving a most kindly farewell from the Qadhi Al Umari and the local officials. We travelled from Hudaidah to Port Sudan telegraphing at the moment of our departure from the Yaraan our thanks to His Majesty the Imam and the Amir of Hudaidah for the great kindness and hospitality which we had received at their hands while in the Yaman. arrived at Port -udan on the morning of the 25 th of May, and after staying there for two days we left by on Snglish steamer on which we arrived at Sues on the afternoon of the May. On the 4 th of June, we left Cairo by train and arrived at Beyrout on the afternoon of the 5 ^ June, whore we waited for the departure of the motor-carmotor-car convoy on the 8 th of June. We arrived in Baghdad by this convoy on the evening of the Xlth of June, X931 * Part of the mission v&amp;iich was entrusted to us by His Majesty the King was that we shouid endeavour to act as an intermodiary for the removal of outstanding differences between His Majesty f A bduX •Aziz aX Sa’ud, and His Majesty the Imam. His KxoeXXency Nuri Pasha ai Sa f id opened this question with His Majesty ing f AbduX ‘Aziz and we understood that His Majesty did not desire to discuss this subject as he regarded the question as having been aiready closed. From my conversations with the Imam, I gathered that he still regards the territory previously under the rule of the Idrisi which is now included in Asir, as belonging to tho Yaman. I considered it better not to discuss this question at any length having ascertained that in this matter both the Tings held firmly to their own views. Nevertheless, the relations between the Kingdom of Najd and the HIjam and the Kingdom of the Yaman are outwardly friendly, since the two Kings correspond with each other end are solving questions concerning extradition with goodwill.£ APPENDIX I % mr r i i i '*S r\ jr 7 kJ j s jl \0?&gt; Speech delivered by the Head of the •Iraqi Mission to the Yaraan in the presence of His Majesty the King of the Taman. Your Majesty, I have the honour to lay before Your Majesty a letter from His Majesty the King of ’Iraq in which His PfSajesty avails himself of this opportunity to express his great wonder and appreciation of the illustrious achievement of Your Majesty in the service of our holy religion and Your Majesty's most glorious labours for the protection of our faith and for the progress and development of the beautiful country of the Yaman which is so dear to all Arab hearts. His Majesty has felt that the time has come for all the Arab Kingdoms to draw closer together so that the links of affection and esteem which unite them may be strengthened and so that the whole Arab people may live in happiness, peace and prosperity. It is the desire of His Most Noble Majesty my King to receive from Your Majesty's hand your most gracious help and support in the furtherance of the realization to this end. The 'Iraqi nation, which is united to the Yamani nation by ties of religion, language and tradition, bears towards the person of Your Majesty the greatest respect and esteem and towards Your Majesty's people the deepest affection and most kindly sentiments. TheThe kindness shown to me by your Majesty on the last occasion when I was in the Yaman caused me to accept with the highest gratification the important mission which His Majesty my King has entrusted to me, since ray past experience of Your Majesty*s gracious condescensions gave me good ground to hope that I should receive again from Your Majesty every help and assistance in the execution of the task with which I had been charged.

It is reported that while the IMAM has rejected the proposals of the Iraqi Mission in SA1TA 1 for an Aral Alliance, he has approved Articles of Friendship and mutual recognition between IRAQ, and the YS^TEIT, the draft of which is stated to have been signed at SAFA’ on the 11th May by TAHA PASHA AL HASHIMI and QADHI ABDULLA AL AMRI .IZ4 rs (E 1911/1881/91) No. 320. (647/1/31) Sec ^t. Sir, r ? m * Cj / , Sm/ 2 ' i \ THE RESIDENCY, CAIRO. 2nd April, 1931. I have the honour to inform you that, in the course of a conversation with the Iraq Prime Minister, who is now in Cairo on his way to Jedda, I enquired whether it was true that General Taha Hashimi, Chief of the Iraq General Staff, who was accompanying Nuri Pasha A1 Said, was proceeding to the Yemen. 2. Nuri Pasha replied in the affirmative. The General, he said, had been in the Yemen for a long time and was on friendly terms with the Imam Yahia. It was hoped that the General might be able to promote a re conciliation between the Imam and Ibn Saud. 3. I asked Nuri pasha whether he did not think that this mission to the Imam might indispose Ibn Saud. His Excellency replied that he intended, on arrival at Jedda, to speak to Ibn Saud about this matter. If he saw that the King disliked the projected journey of General Taha Hashimi, it would be abandoned. ^ r « Jfl a y mention that a report from secret sources indicates that the General is proceeding to the Yemen to arrange for the military instruction of the Imam’s army. He was Chief of the Staff of the Turkish Division in the Yemen before and during the war. He would therefore be in a good position to appreciate the possibilities of military organisation in the Yemen. o. I am forwarding copies of this despatch to His Majesty’s High Commissioner at Bagdad, to the Political Resident at Aden and to His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda.

Sir A. Ryan (Jedda). April 9, 1931. D. boon April ID, 1931. R. 2.0 p.m. April 10, 1931. No. 84. Taha Pasha Eashimi and another member cf Iraq delegation are proceeding from here to Yemen at the earliest opportunity. Nuri Pasha told me last evening that he had explained this project to the King in order to make sure that despatch of delegates straight from here would not indispose him. He had represented it as a matter of general Arab interest and had offered to promote removal of any feeling on the part of Imam as regards Ibn Saud ? s annexation of Asir. The Pasha said that King had reacted favourably and charged Taha with friendly message to Imam. Except for what was implied in the above Nuri made no mention of Arab alliance proposal in conversation with me. He emphasized value of visit to Yemen as a means of obtaining information as to general situation in south-west Arabia.
