Each factory along the Indian Coast would require 'one large country craft' fitted with fish storage tanks, six motor fishing vessels and thirty country craft (Bedis and Howras). The Government of India enquired to the Political Resident Persian Gulf on the availability of vessels. Officials in Sharjah and Bahrain replied that there were no fishing vessels available as they were in short supply in the region.Correspondents include K L Panjabi, Government of India, Department of Food; Political Resident Persian Gulf; Political Agent, Bahrain; Political Officer, Sharjah; Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, Adviser, Bahrain Government.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><topic>Fishing vessels</topic></subject><subject><topic>Fishery products</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002d0#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000241.0x0002d0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
