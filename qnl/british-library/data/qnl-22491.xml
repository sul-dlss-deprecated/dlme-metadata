It has been my task to negotiate with Sheikh Raschid of Dubai for the lease of land there in order that we may build residential quarters for our own staff, and offices, stores, etc. The present position is that the Sheikh has agreed to our operating in his territory, and has visited the proposed site with me and expressed consent on its location, area, etc. The major snag at present is that he is only prepared to offer us a lease of ten years duration, which means that any permanent buildings which we erect on his land become valueless to us at the end of the term of the lease and must inevitably revert to him 0 This, as you will appreciate, is neither an ecnomic nor businesslike arrangement, particularly since we are regarding this area rather from a point of view of long-term policy and planning® I am proposing to travel to Muscat (bn Monday, Oct. 10th., but expect to visit Dubai again on the way back, probably at the end of this month* I should be grateful, therefore, if you would be kind enough to pass this information to Mr. P.
