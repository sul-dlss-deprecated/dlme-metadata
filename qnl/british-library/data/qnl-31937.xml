IITDIA OFFICE, WHITHHALL, S.',?. 1. 28th April 1938. Muscat Treaty. ^ i r 4 ;ed ih / 'il. / y / \7ith reference to Gibson’s letter of the 14th April, No. P. Z. 2564/38, I am desired to forward a copy of a letter addressed to His Highness the Sultan of Muscat enclosing a draft representing the results of the informal discussions with His Highness in London in connexion with the revision of the 1891 Treaty. Notes of the meetings held with ,/His Highness between the 20th and 23rd April are also enclosed herewith, together with a copy of a letter explanatory of a point in Article 1 (ii) which was sent to the Sultan on the 22nd April. 2. It will be noted that His Highness has been informed that the draft is subject to the views of the Government of India and the further views of His Majesty’s Government. As the discussions have been conducted in close consultation with the Legal Adviser of the Foreign 0 f fic e/ Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE. ,CSI. ,MV0. , Secretary to the Government of India, External Affairs Department. ted .id ril.Office and the Board of Trade it is not expected that any fresh points or criticisms of the draft will be made from here, except possibly with regard to the Sultan's proposed amendments of Articles 1 and 19, as to which the Colonial Office will wish to consult the Aden and Zanzibar authorities. I am to ask that the draft may be examined as soon as possible in order that any observations which the Government of India may wish to make may be considered here and the necessary instructions issued at an early date for any further discussion with the Sultan that may be necessary, or for the final conclusion of the Treaty. His Highness' present intention is to reach Bombay at the end of May and after three weeks' stay there to return to Muscat in the last week of June. 3. The more important changes introduced in the present draft compared with the revised provisional draft of 11 th April are as follows:- Article 2 : The paragraphs dealing with monopolies gave much trouble and the present paragraph ( 2 ) was the best that the Sultan could be brought to accept. was found necessary to concede to the Sultan&amp; 3. freedom to impose restrictions with regard to the purchase etc. of immovable property by British subjects which would not be applicable to his own subjects. Articles 5 (7) and 3 (2) : The Board of Trade would not object to these paragraphs as at present drafted and Sir Trenchard Bowie thinks they may be accepted, provided that it is confirmed that the charges referred to in Article 5 (7) are in fact of long standing, as alleged by the Sultan. As Indian traders and Indian trade are the most affected the Government of India may have special views on the paragraphs. Article 7 : The Board of Trade would be prepared to accept this Article (regarding harbour dues &amp;c.) in the light of the assurances vdiich the Sultan is willing to give. Article 9 : With regard to paragraph 3 of this Article, it should be explained that some doubt was felt regarding the inclusion of exception (b) relating to the importation of arms, but the foreign Office Legal Adviser and the Board of Trade considered that it might on the whole be as well to retain (b) in view of the possibility that the Treaty might be used by the Sultan as a modelfor treaties with other Powers. Paragraph (5) was therefore retained in its common form. Article 13 (Jurisdiction): The comparatively minor points raised by the Sultan have been met. Article 1 5 : Article 14 of the draft of 11th April was the one which caused most difficulty, and as His Highness's objections were in great part due to its appearance in a published Treat 2 / it was decided to deal with the essential parts of the Article by means of a confidential letter to which His Highness eventually agreed. 4. Copies of this letter and enclosures are being sent to Powle at Bahrein and to Watts. Yours sinceroJy. (Sgd.) R. r££L-3.Vv. 1 , 26th April,1920 Your Highness, I am directed hy th India to enclose the draft the result cf the informal Sir Irene hard Hov/le and Hr. e Secretary of State for cf the Treaty representing conversations v/hich Gibson have had with Your Highness. It is felt that these informal conversations have been most valuable and that they will greatly facilitate the final conclusion of the Treaty on Your Highness’ return to Muscat. The Government of India are being consulted on this draft. Subject to any views which they may express and to any further view of His Majesty’s Government, and to the settlement of any outstanding points, it is hoped that it may be possible to arrange that Sir Irenehard Fowls may proceed to the formal conclusion of the Treaty with Your Highness on the lines of the enclosed draft within a reasonable time after the return cf Your Highness to Muscat. May I express on behalf of the Secretary of State his appreciation of the extremely helpful attitude which Your Highness has adopted in the course of the informal discussions and which has enabled them to be concluded in so short a space of time?

Note of Sixth meeting with His Highness the Sultan, 20th April. Present: His Highness, Sir T. Powle and Mr. Gibson. With reference to the revised provisional draft the following points were discussed:- Article 1 : it was suggested to the Sultan that his proposed amendments to this Article might be more acceptable to the Colonial Office if he would agree that the exclusion of the British protected persons named by him should operate only in respect of the jurisdiction Articles so that these persons should be amenable to the jurisdiction of his courts but should at the same time enjoy the trading benefits accorded by the Treaty to British Subjects. His Highness was unable to agree pointing out that this -would mean that nations say of Debai would enjoy trading privileges in his territory while his own subjects would have no corresponding advantages in Debai. The point was left for further consideration. Article 2 (2) and (5): A further and unsuccessful attempt was made to secure the Sultan's acceptance of Hiese paiagraphs. He repeated that he had no desire to interfere with trace oetween Muscat and British uerritoiies but insisted on complete freedom to establish monopolies affecting trade carried on inside his territories. The matter was left over. Article 4. The Sultan insisted on his desire to impose restrictions if necessary on the acquisition of immovable property - houses, s.iOps Ac. as well as land - by/by foreigners and said he could only accept the present draft if the words 'the nationals of the Sultan or' were deleted. This, as he said, would leave him free to impose unlimited restrictions on all foreigners alike. He was however willing to substitute for the last four lines the proviso at the end of Article 5 of his own draft. The article was left for further discussion. Article 6 (2): The Sultan agreed that a representative of the Board of Trade might be invited to discuss this paragraph with him and Mr. Dulichand. Article 14; The Sultan expressed a number of objections to this Article which he said was new and created a very unwelcome impression that there were two governments in his country. He was quite content that British Subjects should be tried in the Consul's Court and he was not interested in the civil and criminal laws applied to them by the Consul. What he did want was that British Subjects should, like his own Subjects, be subject to municipal regulations and the like, for example to regulations relating to curfew, prohibition of smoking during Ramadan, motor traffic &amp;c. It was explained to him that the Article was considered essential in consequence of the surrender of the full ex-territorial rights conferred by the existing treaty, that it was considered necessary to provide machinery for removing any doubt as to the laws which were applicable to British Subjects in xuscat, and that His Highness need have no apprehension that regulations of the kind he referred to would not be exhibited ana eaiorced in the Consul's Court against British/British Subjects. It proved very difficult to satisfy the Sultan on these points and further examination of the Article in the light of his views was promised. The next meeting was arranged for Thursday morning 2lst April, at 10 a.m.MUSCAT .PBEATY . Note of seventh meeting with His Highness the Sultan, 21st April. Present: His Highness, Sir T. Powle, Mr. Gibson, and, for the discussion of Article G (2), Mr. Shachle (Board of Tracie) and Mr. JDulichand. The following matters were dealt with:- Article 1 (ii ) : It v/as explained to the Sultan, with reference to his enquiry at the fifth meeting, that (a) the rights to he granted to companies under the proposed draft are solely rights of the companies as such and would not in any way limit his jurisidction over non- British employees of the company as individuals, ana (b) in the event of a British Company obtaining a concession or contract wherein they accepted the imposition of certain conditions or restrictions by the Sultan's Government the terms of the concession or contract would be upheld in the Consul's court even though the conditions or restrictions involved a surrender of rights which might otherwise have been claimed for the company under the Treaty. He desirea to have this explanation in writing ana said that in the light of it he was satisfied with the draft Article. Ba.A,i Q T e C (,_2) and (3 ) : The Sultan was asked to substitute 101 these paragraphs the draft paragraph proposed to him at tne firth meeting, which it was understood at the time he was prepared to accept, and he was told that we were prepared to take the risk of his using his powers in a way/way that would deprive the paragraph of some of its value. He however nor: raised certain objections to this eraft. (a) He wished to have it amended so as to appear less harsh, i.e. so as to begin 'The Sultan shall have the right to create monopolies, but in the case of any monopoly established by hi a in respect of a trade in which nationals of His Majesty are at the time engaged he will compensate such nationals etc. etc.' (b; He wished to have an assurance that he would be the final authority to aeciue what compensation, if any, should be given. (o) He objected to the inclusion of the last sentence and said it was sufficiently covered by the first sentence, which, ho said, covered both internal and external trade carried on by British nationals. He was told that it was understood that he had hitherto always accepted the principle of the last sentence, that in our view it was a quite reasonable as well as a desirable provision in the Treaty, and that it was designed to cover the case of trade carried on say between Muscat and India which was not handled in Muscat by British subjects. Further there was no undue restriction, if indeed any, on the Sultan’s freedom of action, and the clause was one which would be and has been accepted by several countries. It proved impossible to overcome the Sultan’s objections and finally he said he was willing to accept cither the first sentence (subject to the points (a) and (b) above), o^r the second sentence, but not both, org as an alternative to either, the formula suggested to him at the fourth meeting, viz. 'Should the Sultan wish to establish any monopoly in his territory such monopoly will be arranged in such a way that it will not be detrimental to the trade of nationals of His Majesty'. Article 3 (1 )/3. Article 3 (1 ) : The Sultan shoved so;ne sign of objecting to 'national' treatment in this paragraph which he said old not occur in the present Treaty. He was aslied to turn first to the next Article. Article 3 was not further discussed but it was inferred from a passing remark of the Sultan at the end of the meeting that he did not attach much importance to his objection. Article 4 : The Sultan was informed that we would be satisfied with the formula for the last few lines of this Article which he said at the fourth meeting he would accept (i.e. national ana most favoured nation treatment in respect of movable property. Most favoured nation treatment only in respect of immovable property). His Highness confirmed that he accepted the formula. (It is thought, though the point was not pur to him on this occasion that this will remove his objection to 'national' treatment in Article 3 (1)). Article 5 (jS) : In addition to 'weighing' the Sultan now wishes to insert 'transit' fees, explaining that both these charges, like the others mentioned, are already embodied in the customs regulations which have been in force in muscat tor many years. He also presses for the omission oi the words 'in strict relation to the cost of the services they are intended to cover' at the end of the paiagraph, urging that 'on a reasonable scale' is quite sufficient. Articl e 6 (2 ): Mr. Shackle explained at length the reasons for which this paragraph was considered aosirable, pointing out that it was in accordance with the almost universal practice, and citing as an example the treaty provisions in force in Morocco for many years. The matter/4. matter was not of great importance under existing conditions, but it mirnt well be important in future wh.en changes were made in the Muscat tariff, and it was very desirable that traders should know on what basis customs duties would be levied. Mr. Dulichand urged that the existing system was satisfactory, easily worked, and well known to all the traders concerned, who would experience much difliculty, as would also the customs staff, in getting used to the procedure indicated in the draft. It might well be that it would oe found desirable to adopt this procedure in the future when considerable changes were made in the tariff, but there was no present intention of maxing such changes and they would therefore prefer to continue the existing system. Mr. hulichanci was understood to propose that the draft should run ”according to their market price (or market valuation) at Muscat .’ 1 He said the phrase ’’reaay money” was a source of dispute, since traders irequently made their sales on three months 1 or oix months’ credit and'would argue that the price on which customs duty should be assessed should be, not what they v-eie due to receive at the end of the period of credit, but one smaller price which the goods would fetch if sold ac once for cash. It was eventually agreed to leave over the paragraph for consideration by His Highness in the light of the discussion. Article 13 (1) (iv): To meet His Highness the audition of the following woras at the end of the Article was proposed and agreed to: ' anu shall so remit the case if '-—y other party to tne proceedings is a national of the Sultan”. Article 12 (£)/5. &gt; \ Article 1^3 ( 2 ) : In the first sentence His Highness desired n the courts” in place of ”a court” (of the Sultan). For the second sentence it was agreed to substitute the alternative two sentences in the margin. Article 12 ( 5): To meet His Highness it was proposed to insert, after ”for the prevention of breaches of the peace”, the words ”or a breach of a law or regulation of the Sultan which has been made applicable to nationals of His Majesty under Article 14”. The Sultan could not agree to those words until Article 14 was discussed. Article 14 : This article was discussed at considerable length, and to meet some of the views expressed by His Highness at the previous meeting it was proposed to him that the second paragraph should run ”In the case of police or municipal regulations or of legislation imposing taxes or duties the text of the laws ana regulations, or of the relevant provisions thereof, shall always be exhibited etc.”. It was represented to the Sultan that this met his practical objections, and the general purpose of the Article ana its necessity from our point of view was explained to him. He could not be brought to accept it, even with the offered deletion ox the third paragraph which, it was explained, was inserted in his own interest. He objected to a new article which showed that there were two Governments in his State, and he could not agree to the machinery by which his laws were enforceable against British subjects only when exhibited by the Consul. Certain of his remarks suggested however that his objection was largely to the appearance of the Article in the Treaty and that he might be less reluctant to accept the principle of the Article if it were embodied in an unpublished/ — ■■6 . unpublished exchange of letters. The matter was left for further discussion. The next meeting was arranged for Friday afternoon 22nd April, at 3 p.m.IviJSG/iJ TREATY.

H is Highness now takes exception to the provision according national treatment in paragraph (i), though he has no objection to the similar provision in paragraph ( 2 ). In paragraph (l) he said that this new provision, which does not occur in the existing Treaty, much too f c .r, and he ’was not prepared to waive his objection when it was pointed out that similar provisions occurred in the majority of commercial treaties, including treaties made e.g. with Germany, ..astria and the United Kingdom. article/2.

His Highness said he had not come to any definite conclusion on this paragraph, but his feeling was that there was no need to disturb a procedure which had been in force in Muscat for many years and worked satisfactorily to all concerned. ■article 12 ( 3 ) ; The amendment proposed at the seventh meeting was agreed to, in viev/ of the conclusion reached on Article 14• article 14 ; ^ proposal was made to the Sultan that only a short article should be inserted in the Treaty and that the procedure contemplated in the present article should be agreed upon in an exchange of letters which would be confidential. ^ draft article and draft letter were handed to him.

Your Highness, I understand that Your Highness desires to receive an explanation in writing of two points which you have raised in respect of the reference to 'Corporate bodies' in Article l(ii) of the revised provisional draft Treaty. I am accordingly directed by the Secretary of State to give Your Highness the following explanations: (a) The rights proposed to be granted to corporate bodies under the proposed draft are solely rights of the corporate bodies as such and would not in any way limit the jurisdiction of Your Highness over non-British employees of a corporate body as individuals. (b) In the event of a British company obtaining a concession or contract wherein they accepted the imposition of conditions or restrictions by the Government of Your Highness the terms of the concession or contract would be upheld by His Majesty's Consul even though the conditions or restrictions involved a surrender of rights . which might otherwise have been claimed by the company under the Treaty.

Dear Glbaon, With reference to your letter to aggallay No.3979/33 of the 9th June about privileges fo^ the Consul at Muscat, we ere Inclined to thi^ k that It would be a mistake to endeavour to persuade the Sultan to concede favours which are not enjoyed hy British consular officers elsewaere. Having regard to the poselblllty that In the event of the appointment of a T uscatl Consul In India, the Covernrrent of India might be faced with a demand for reciprocal treatment, It seems to ut that they would be well-advised to give careful consideration to dir Trenchard Powle*« proposals In the light of the treatment accorded to foreign consular officers In Tndte generally, which sh uld In Its turn take accmnt of the principles appllsd In the United Kingdom. These principles, as you probably 'rnow, deny to foreign consular officers any title to exemption from municipal taxation, and, except aa regards Income Tax on their official salaries, from State taxation also. Generally speaking we think that our demands should be kept within the limits of what our own practice regards as reasonable except where very special local conditions point to something wider. Free entry for all his personal requirements is not necessarily of Importance to the Consul though It might be to the Government of India, la saving them from having to compensate him for the high oost of living, but we feel that the desire of the Government of India to avoid such expenditure would not be a valid reason for claiming franchise and if this were to be granted. It would be the first thing e Muscetl Consul In India would like, and presumably about the last thing the Government of India would wish to concede. ws/ J*?*GIBBON, EBd.wmmmKmmmm 8 . Wc do think, however, that there Isa good case for the propoeals under ’B* In air rrei.ohard Fowls*s letter, - hioh deals with restricted or prohibited goods. In this respect there is fair *rounu for asking that the Coneul and hie ataff snail not be deprived of the enjoyment of commoditise which for reasons of climate and national habit they could not forego without discomfort and possible prejudice to their health and well-being, and that they should therefore be permitted to import such goods in reasonable quantities without restriction.

It is obviously essential to preserve existing rignt of appeal to court of Political Resident. Tnere is no reason for supposing tnat Gultan would object to it and so iar as ne is concerned amendment is pro bably unnecessary. it is tnougnt desirable only as safe guard against possible objection hy a future Sultan based on exces sively/excessively literal interpretation of existing text.

Dear Cowell, I am sorry for the delay in thanking you for your letter of the 26th April (No. 15332/38) about the Muscat Treaty. From the copies sent to Fleming you will have seen that in Article 1 of the draft (and also in Article 19) we have shown the amendments desired by the Sultan in the margin instead of putting them into the body of the draft. The Sultan seemed to attach a quite disproportionate importance to the exclusion from the scope of the Treaty of British-protected persons belonging to the Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar as well as to the Arab Sheikhdoms of the Gulf, and we tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to accept a compromise by which these persons would come under his jurisdiction but at the same time enjoy the commercial advantages of the Treaty. All of them are of course excluded from the scope of the existing Treaty, and the Political Resident sees no objection to the Sultan’s amendments so far as they refer to the Stares of the Persian Gulf. We should feel relieved if you could also agree in respect/ Cowell, Esq., C.M.G., Colonial Office, S.W. 1respect of the Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar, but in any case we should be very grateful if any consultation with the Aden and Zanzibar authorities that is thought desirable could be carried out as quickly as possible so that we may have your views at an early date. \ 7 e hope that it may be possible to send the Political Resident the necessary instructions in time to enable him to negotiate and conclude the Treaty in July.

Article 6(2)• This Articlewae result of lengthy diacuasions with ^3ultan ana it is doubtful if ne can be induced to agree to any substantial amendment oi it» In any case it seems desirable to fix a uniform oasis of valuation, wnether there is a Tariff Board or not. Otner- wiee there 1 b nothing to prevent tariff autnoritiea from valuing different articles on different bases. Moreover, a valuation list whion covered everytning would be impossibly long and it seems best to lay down some principle to enable Customs officers to decide on valuation or particular articles which may not be included In tariff Board valuations witnout having to hold up goods until Board can be called together to fix a valuation. Article 6(4) . Watts suggestion would seem to put Muscat Customs in position always of naving tnelr mm way in last resort and it would seem preferable to say e.g. n should experts be unable to agree on ohotee of a umpire the umpire snail be chosen by agreement between consular author ities of His Majesty ana Sultan'* Article 13( iHiv) » Since Article provides for reference to religious courts of Sultan only of cases in which 'person whose status is in question is a Moslem * we do not thinK any amendment is required. 4.

Paragraph 3 of India Office telegram Ho. 1148 of June 22nd. Sultan adopted at first uncompromising attitude with regard to both Zanzibar and Aden protecs orate. r 3. (a) Re Zanzibar he emphasised connection between Zanzibar and Muscat and explained that numbers of Zanzibari nationals of Omani origin yearly visit his territories while some of them own property. (b) After a good deal of discussion he is prepared to limit his jurisdiction to M national8 of Zanzibar of Qnani origin wno own property in Oman” but he is prepared to accord them the trade privileges under the treaty. All other nat ionals of Zanzibar will both come under consular jurisdiction and enjoy the trade privileges under the treaty. (c) This seems not unreasonable and I trust will be acceptable to His Majesty* s Government. 4. (a) In tegard to Aden Protectorate Sultan based nis attitude on fact (which I presume is correct) that Omani nationals in a Sultanate of the Protectorate e.g. lahej, would oome under the jurisdiction of the local Ruler. Sultan therefor asks/ i:- 2 - asks for reciprocity. Further, numbers or nationals of Hadramaut visit Bhofar and from practical point of view it ie im- possible for such individuals to be handed over to our consul at Muscat. (b) After a good deal of argument Sultan agreed to accord nationals of the States of the Aden Protectorate the trade privileges under the treaty provided tney come unaer his jurisdiction. (c) This likewise seems to me a reasonable com promise and I trust His Majesty 1 s Government will be able to accept it. 5. iteragraph 5 of Government of India telegram Ho. 10b3 of June 29th.

This is reasonable in itself and our merchants nave right of reference to arbitration under Article 6(4). This as well as tne coaposition of tariff board (Article 6(3)) give our merchants strong safeguards and if I press the Sultan further on customs procedure I am afraid he may perhaps change his mind on these two important points. I do not therefore propose to suggest any amendment to clause in question. I trust his Majesty’s Government and Government of India will agree? 3. Articles 5(4)(b) and 5(6).

Outstanding Muscat questions•INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, S.\7.1. 19th May 1938. (05 Z.2210/38. nfidential. Sea Mail. t] Would 3 [/ would you kindly refer to your letter of the 24th March to Walton (D.O.No. F. 54S-E/37) relating to certain problems pending with the Sultan of Muscat. _.iost of the time spent in dis-cussions with the Sultan in London was taken up with the Treaty, but certain other matters were discussed with him. These are being dealt with in separate letters where necessary, but it may be helpful to summarise the results here. 2 . With regard to paragraph 3 of your letter it was decided not to attempt to dissuade the Sultan irom visiting Italy. So far as could be gathered from casual conversation it seemed clear that if any undesirable consequences were to follow from the visit they would not be of the Sultan’s seeking; his intention appeared to be to make the visit as private and unobtrusive as possible and he said he had no desire to seek an interview with Signor Mussolini. It appears Aubrey Metcalfe, KCIE.,CSI.,MV0. now./now that owing to the prolongation of his stay in London the Sultan may not 'be able to visit Italy in the time available. 3. As regards the outstanding questions, other than ;he Treaty, the position is briefly as follows: (a) Thft Ar ms Traffic Subsidy. The Sultan made no ’eference to his request for a renewal of the suosidy and ;he matter was not discussed with him in any way. (b) Deputati o n of 'Political Officer., As reported separately, the Sultan was informed that the Government, 01 :ndia could not spare Colonel Bremner. The possibility &gt;f using Captain Byard’s services as V'azir was discussed, md also the name of Captain Galloway was suggested for lis Highness’ consideration. Sir ^renchard : owle proposed to take Captain Galloway with him on a visit to luscat in the near future in order that the sultan - i- become better acquainted with him. The Sultan said tne appointment was not a matter oi urgency. 1 o^ our part fully share the views held in India as *0 u-*e importance of providing him with a British adviser, as soon 3s this becomes practicable. ( c ) The Political Agreement relati ng to the Muscat )i l Conces si ons . This is being dealt with separately.3. / Revised drafts of the Agreement and exchange of letters were prepared to meet the Sultan's known objections as far as possible. He agreed to these, with some minor modifications, but persisted in asserting his view that his father's undertaking of 1923 was not binding on him and there! ore that the concessions did not require the formal approval of Government. Obviously we could not accept such a view, but it is worth remarking that, so far as one could judge here, the Sultan seons to be actuated m this and other matters by motives of prestige rather than by any desire to embarrass Government by withholding his consent from any particular requests to which Government attach importance. (d) Civil Air Agreement. The Sultan did not discuss the question of the liability to customs duty of marine equipment &amp;c. landed by Imperial Airways at Gwadur. Ke said he wished to raise some points in connexion with the renewal of the Agreement, but before he could discuss these in detail he was informed that there was a probability that Imperial Airways would wish to move from Gwadur in the near luture; they were dissatisfied with conditions there during the monsoon and were looking about for a more protected harbour. (We had just learned that Imperial Airways/4. Airways had in fact decided to move to Jiunri, subject of course to the necessary arrangements being made with the Khan of Kalat) The Sultan listened to this with perfect composure, and said he had merely wished to discuss the matter thus far in advance in order to avoid hurried negotiations at a Is.ter stage. It is believed that if the Agreement were to be renewed the Sultan would want a higher rent. (e) Payment of rent by Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. The Sultan was informed of the Company’s willingness to pay a nominal rent, in return for which they would wish to have a licence for an extended period, say 25 years. On enquiring what was considered a ncminal rent the Sultan was told that the Company paid £1 per cable in the United Kingdom and Rs.10 for their landing rights at Karachi. Though he showed some surprise at the smallness these figures he did not say that he would not be satisfied with some comparable payment. The matter was left to be pursued with him on his return to Muscat. (f) Kalat-Qwa dur relations. The subject was not raised by the Sultan and Powle decided to defer until ahter His Highness’s return to Muscat any discussion of the suggestion/5. suggestion for a conference between liuscat and Kalat representatives. The boundary question was mentioned, however, in connexion with the negotiations for an oil concession in Gwadur. The Sultan recognised that the frontier would have to be definitely settled in the event of an oil concession being granted, but the matter he said would have to be negotiated by him with the Government of India and not with the Khan of Kalat. (g) A rms and Ammunition and a motor cruiser. The Sultan asked for expert assistance in the purchase of certain arms and ammunition (viz. 2 naval 3 pounders, with ship mountings , &amp;c. , one field carriage suitable for these guns, and 200 rounds live ammunition; 1 part-worn Vickers gun; and two Lewis guns, about which we have been in correspondence with you). Enquiries were accordingly made of the Admiralty and War Office and His Highness visited the Chatham Dockyard to discuss his requirements. He was also given assistance in making enquiries about a motor cabin vessel which he thought of ordering for the purpose of journeys along the coast of Oman. 4. Ho other outstanding questions were discussed, but it should be mentioned that the Sultan incidentally remarked/6 . remarked on one occasion on receiving a letter addressed ” Kis Hi Siiness” that he did not wish to be addressed in future by this title, his only proper title being, he said, Sultan Saiyid (Said bin Taimur). Perhaps we need not take this casual remark too seriously - at any rate unless he raises the matter again, and it might be undesirable to adopt any other form of address. There is, however, another point which he raised on the same occasion. He said that, though he greatly esteemed the honour of the K.C.I.E. and would treasure it all his life, he did not think it fitting that the letters should be added after his name. it was suggested to him that it would be hardly appropriate that an official communication frcm Government should omit the customary indication of an honour conferred by His Majesty. We understand from the Foreign Office, / however, that this view is unsound and that it would be contrary to diplomatic practice, in the case of an independent Ruler, to insert the letters of a British decoration in the form of address. There would therefore be no formal objection to acceding to the Sultan’s wish regarding the omission of the ’’K.C.I.E. ”.f 7. ^ ^ sGriding a. copy of this Isttor to Fowls, and enclose copy of one sent to him with reference to the preceding paragraph.

Addressed Government of India p&lt;pfeWd Metcalfe from Peel. 2. Muscat Treaty. Following are alterations in latest draft which have been proposed here up to the present and to which Fowle should seelc Sultan’s agreement if he meets him in India this month to discuss points raised by the Government of India. (a) Article l(v). For the present opening words substitute ’’The term ’’foreign Country” shall mean etc. ” Explanation: the phrase 'most favoured nation” does not appear in the latest draft. » (b) Article 7* As already indicated, for paragraph (c) of letter substitute 'That the special Board, which will be presided over by the Sultan's Port Autnority, shall consist of Omani members and British members in equal numbers. (c) Article 13 (1). After 'shall”(thirteenth word) insert 'subject to any right of appeal which His Majesty may provide'. Explanation : It is obviously essential to preserve existing right of appeal to court of Political Resident. There is no reason for supposing that Sultan would object to it and so far as he is concerned amendment is probably unnecessary. It is thought desirable only as safeguard against possiole objection by a future Saltan based on excessively literal interpretation of existing text. (d) Article 23 (2). After 'between' (sixteenth word) insert 'the territories of'. This is a purely drafting amendment. 4. Apart from the foregoing \7atts who has been shown the Treaty here thinks that Articles 5(3) and 6(2) are unsatisfact ory as not likely to afford adequate safeguard against abuse. He has promised written statement of his views, on receipt oi which I will telegraph further.\ L CONFIDENTIAL. No. C/432.

The amendment suggested by His Highness regard ing the entry of nationals of His Majesty into Muscat territory was accepted by His Majesty’s Government in Paragraph 3 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938. Article o (3). See paragraph 5 of India Office telegram Ho. 1219, dated 5th July 1938, and Government of India telegram Ho.1091, dated 6th July 1938. The position is as explained in paragraph 1 of my telegram fio.T/l61, dated 2nd July 1938, and does not differ, I imagine, from that In other countries.

In paragraph 1(3) of Government of India Express Letter Ho.H.63 -sAg, dated 8th June 1938, it was suggested that the words *at seaport towns'* should be inserted after the v/ord^reside* in the third line of this Article in order to prevent a demand by the Sultan for the appointment of his Consul at the headquarters of the Government of India. I suggested, vide ty telegram Ho. T/l46, dated 24th June 1938, to the Government of India, that the words 'and the places at which they reside 4 should also be deleted, in order to deprive the sultan of the right to insist at any time in the future that our Consul should reside at any seaport town other than Husoat. To this the Government of India agreed in paragraph 4 of their telegram Ho.1056, dated 29th June 1938. On the changes being suggested to the iultan he stated (vide :sy telegram tfo.?/l63 f dated 2nd July 1936, to the Government of India) that he wished to retain the present wording of the ^urticle, quite/realising that the retention of the *rordg # and the placea at which they reside' would giro the Gorernment of India the right to refuse residence of hit Consult at any particular place.

The result naa been that the translation nas sssn done quickly* correctly and economically, and unices taere are any serious errors I trust that it will be accepted by His majesty’s Government and the Government of India in its present form (see paragraph d(b) below), 8, fhat now remains to be done appears to be as follows, (a) for His Majesty's Government and the Government of India to approve finally of the text of the present draft, (b) for arrangetaenta to be made - I euggest in London for the Arabic text to be onecked* (o) for tho English and Arabic texts to be prepared a for signature# (d) for the treaty to be signed.

This letter is not strictly bound up ,fith the treaty and there is no refer ence in it to the treaty. In view however of the fact that the question nroee in correspondence connected with the treaty it mny be convenient to deal with it here.

Dr. Arherry, our Assistant Librarian, has been good enough to check the Arabic translation of the Muscat Treaty and I enclose a list of the passages where substantial discrepancies occur as between the English original and the draft Arabic translation. This list does not include a rather large number of passages where it would be desirable, either on grammatical grounds or in the interests of exact clarity, to make minor emendations in the Arabic. As, in your covering letter, you expressed the hope that, unless there were any serious errors, the Arabic text should be accepted in its present form, we should be glad if you would let us know whether you consider that the points dealt with in Arberry 1 s note are of sufficient importance to warrant further reference to the Sultan before the signature copies are prepared. A copy of the draft Treaty, as amended in the light of your discussions at Karachi, is enclosed. 2.

In order to get round the difficulty of the interpretat ion of the word 'owner 11 in the sixteenth line of Article 12(2) - i.e. whether ov/ner of the cargo or owner of the ship is meant - and also the difficulty of what is meant hy the word 'goods' in the thirteenth line of Article 12(2) - i.e. whether this includes 'parts of a ship' we would like to introduce a fairly substantial amendment into the Article. After bhe words 'they shall further take every possible care that' m Article 12(2) we should like the sentence to continue 'such . vessel and all parts thereof and all furniture and appurten ances belonging thereto, and all goods and merchandise saved therefrom, including any which may have been cast into the sea, or the proceeds thereof, if sold, as well as all _~aper found on board such stranded or v/recked vessel, shall be given up to the ov/ners of such vessel, goods, merchandise, etc., Ox to their agents when claimed by them or to the British Consul If it is too late for such a substantial amendment to be incorporated into the Treaty, we would, as a last resox t, be content with the substitution for the words 'the owner, captain, agent of the ship or aircraft, or British Consul, subject always to rights of salvage' of the words 'taeix ownexS, accredited representatives of such owners, oi ,uitish subject always to rights of salvage I hope this is clear.

Foreign Office are inclined to think that it would 'be a mistake to endeavour to persuade Sultan to concede favours which are not enjoyed 'by British Consular Officers elsewhere and that generally speaking our demands should 'be kept within limits of v/hat our own practice regards as reasonable except where very special local conditions point to something wider. 3* As regards (A) in Fowle’s proposed letter to Sultan, foreign Office point out that while ’'free entry for all personal requirements” may 'be of advantage in saving Government j.rom having to compensate Consul for high cost of living, this would not be a valid reason for claiming customs exemption and if conceded by Sultan would undoubtedly lead to similar concession for Muscati Consul. As regards (B) Foreign Office consider there is fair ground for asking that Consul and staff onould not he deprived of enjoyment of commodities which xor reasoiio of climate and national habit they could not forego without discomfort and possible prejudice to their health and v ^ll bein 0 a nd that they should therefore be permitted to import -ach t ,oods in reasonable cpuantities without restriction. regards (C)Foreign Office point out that in United Kingdom, foreign Consular Officers are not entitled to exemption from Municipal taxation, and, except as regards Inccma Tax on their official salaries, from State taxation also*2 ,4560/38 3611/305/91) Foreign Office, S.W.l. 21st June, 1938 My dear (ji'bson, Sr- With reference to India Office letter P.Z.4151/38 of the 17th June and previous correspondence on the subject of the draft of the new Muscat Treaty the following are our observations. In regard to the amendments set out in India Office telegram No.1076 of 8th June to the Government of India (India Office letter P.Z.3994/38 of 11th June) and in Peel^ letter P.Z,.4044/38 of 14th June to Fowle, we have no comments. With reference to Watts' comments set out in India Office telegram- No. 1100 of 14th June to the Government of India (India Office letter P.Z.4135/38 of 15th June) I send you herewith a minute by Beckett which represents our views. As regards the comments set out in government of India Express letter F.63-N/38 of 8th June (India Office letter P.Z.4151/38 of 17th June) I attach another minute by Beckett• In view of the urgency of the matter we have not had time to consult our Treaty Department who may possibly have comments to make on matters of form. If sucn proves to be the case we will address you again later. Yours sincerely, Sd. T.V. Brenan Gibson Esq(E 36U/30 5 / 9:l ) The first comment of the Government of India is I think misconceived. Article 2(1) has nothing to do with the coasting trade, hut the relevant article is Article 3(3) which provides that in all that relates to navigation and the treatment of shipping, the Sultan undertakes to treat British vessels not less favourably in any respect than Omani vessels and the vessels of any foreign country and therefore covers the coasting trade. I think the suggestion in Article 11 is quite unnecessary. As regards Article 16, I do not really think any amendment of the provision is required, hut if any amendment is made it should he to insert the words punishable under the law applied by the consular authorities of His Majesty with penalties not exceeding (Sd.) W.E. Beckett 21st June, 1938.j,4560/38 3585 / 305 / 91 ) As regards Articles 1 and 19, I agree with Major Y/att’s suggestions, hut would point out that the case for striking out Zanzibar from the exceptions is stronger than that for striking out the Aden protectorate. As regards Article 5 (3) I have nothing to say except that the words 'Sultan f s territories” should he substituted for ’’Sultanate’' As regards Articles 5 (4) (h) and 6 I have no observations♦ As regards Article 6 (2) I am not sure that Major Watts is right, but the point is primarily for the Board of Trade. It seems to me, however, that Article 6(3) provides that the Tariff Board fixes the actual valuations and all that Article 6 (2) does is to give some indication as to the principle the Tariff Board should follow in doing this. As regards Article 6 (4), what Major Watts actually proposes is that a sentence should he added that if the experts were unahle to agree as to the choice o. an umpire the decision of the customs house authorities snail he final. I do not think this will do because this will make it certain that there never will he any agreement as to the choice of an umpire. I would suggest saying 'In the event of their being unahle to agree on the choice of an umpire, the umpire he chosen by the consular authorities of his Majesty Sultan.” As regards Article 13 (D (iv) I think Major Watts is wrong here because he thinks that the section requires the case to he referred to the Moslem religious cour apparently without option should any other part„ proceedings/ It'proceedings 'be a national of the Sultan* But that is not what the section says. It says ’’when the person whose status is in question is a Moslem” , and that is quite a different thing from saying any other party to the proceedings. I do not think any amendment is required. (Sd.) W.E. Beckett. 21st June, 1938.4361/38 l n'. 7154/58. •&gt; &gt; {, erf Board of Trade, Great George Street, London, S.V/.l, 20th June, 1938 Dear Symon, Draft Anglo-Muscat Treaty. Following on our telephone conversation, we have considered the points raised by Watts in his letter to Gibson of 11th June. We have only the following observations to make (and even as regards most of these points I think that you are more concerned than we are):- Article 5(3) . Would not the intention be more clearly brought out if Watts* clause (v/hich I gather would be an addition at the end of the present paragraph) were amended to read: M There shall be no variation of the Customs duties as between different ports of the Sultanate, and when goods have once been landed at any such port and the duty thereon has been paid, the goods shall not be liable to re-assessment of duty at the same or any other port'. Article 6(2) . Our interest is of course slight compared with India’s, but we are disposed to feel, as regards Watts proposal, that It is desirable to fix a uniform basis of valuation, whether there is a Tariff Board or not. Otherwise what is there to prevent the Tariff Board from valuing different articles on different bases? Moreover, a valuation list which covered everything would be impossibly long. Surely some principle will need to be laid down to enable Customs officers to decide on the valuation of particular articles which may not be included in the Tariff Board's valuations, without having to hold the goods up until the Board can be called together to fix a valuation. You/ A.C.B. Symon Esq*You will remember that paragraph 2 of this Article was the result of lengthy discussions in the London negotiations, and I should doubt if the Sultan could be induced to agree to any substantial amendment of it, if it is kept. Article 6(4). Watts 1 suggestion would seem to put the Muscat Customs in the position of always having their v/ay in the last resort, and it would seem preferable to say e.g. '‘Should the experts be unable to agree as to the choice of an umpire, the umpire shall be chosen by agreement between the consular officer of His Majesty and the Omani Customs authorities at the port of importation”. We have also considered the letter of 8th June from the External Affairs Department of the Government of India, sent me under your reference P.L.4151/38. Only one point in this interests us, viz. the suggestion that such a provision as Article 2, paragraph 1, is ordinarily held not to include participation in coasting trade. We do not know on what grounds this suggestion is made - in our treaties, where the coasting trade is to be excepted from the national treatment provisions, we always regard a specific exception as necessary for the purpose. Article 3(3) of the present draft Treaty Si ves British shipping full national treatment and no exception made for coasting trade. Therefore the object apparen y desired by the Government of India is, we think, already secured. Yours sincerely&gt; Sd. R.J* Shacklegy Air M&amp;il* P.Z. 19 -^ J.

My telegram No. 1100 of 14th June, Muscat Treaty. 2. After consultation with interested Departments of His Majesty’s Government and subject to your views and those of Fowle we have following comments to offer on points raised by Watts. 3* Articles 1 and 19» Watts views are supported here and we think that Sultan should be pressed to withdraw references to Aden Protectorate and Zanzibar in the amendments noted in margin of draft. Colonial Office have so far not agreed to accept Sultan’s proposal to exclude these territories. Article 5(3)* Suggest that intention would be more clearly brought out if additional clause were amended uO read ’'There shall be no variation of the customs duties as between different ports of the Sultan’s territories, —- u when goods have once been landed at any such port ana tiis duty thereon has been paid? the goods shall not be liable to re-assessment of duty at the same or an^ 0 re port. ' Articles/Articles 5(4) (~b) and. 5(o )» We are content to leave it tortile Government of India to say whether suggestions of Watts should be pressed on Sultan. Article 6(2) » This article was the result of lengthy discussions with the Sultan and it is doubtful if he can be induced to agree to any substantial amendment of it. In any case it seems desirable to fix a uniform basis of valuation, whether there is a Tariff Board or not. Otherwise there is nothing to prevent tariff authorities from valuing different articles on difierent bases. Moreover, a valu.a.tion list which covered everything v/ould be impossibly long and it seems best to lay uomi some principle to enable Customs officers to decide Oxi valuation of particular articles which may not be included in Tariff Board's valuations without having to hold up goods until Board can be called together to fix a valuation. Article 6(4). Watts’ suggestion v/ould seem to put Muscat customs in position of always having their owli in last resort and it would seem preferable to v&amp;yt ,f Should the experts be unable to agree on the choice of an Umpire, the Umpire shall be chosen by agreement between the Consular authorities of His Majesty and Sultan.' Article 13(l)(iv)&gt; Since the Article provides for reference to religious courts of the Sultan only of c,,. in which the ’person whose status is in question i-&gt; a Moslem ' we do not think that any amendment is requirea. 4.

SUBJECT:- Rate of li^itdues levied in the Persian Gulf. Sir, I am directed to address you on the above subject. 2. As you ar*aware, negotiations have recently been in progr©^ 8 between His Majesty^ Government and the Multan of Muscat regarding the revision of the Anglo-IMuscat Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation of 1891, which is ordinarily due to expire ir^ebruary 1939. In connection with tiie drafting of a new treaty it has been agreed to by His Majesty’s Government after consultation with the Government of India that the following Article should be inserted in the treaty 'The Sultan’s Government has the right to charge all vessels entering any of the ports in the sultan’s ^ dominions with shipping, tonnage or harbour dues to be administered under the control of a special board appointed by the Sultan for improvement of the harbour and construction and maintenance of light- houses, etcetera'. At the same time, the Sultan of Muscat has expressed his willingness to agree, by an exchange of letters, MSI .. • alia - fnA(a) that the dues levied at each port in his dominions should be on a scale connensurate with the expenditure incurred on the harbour and light facilities at that port, and (b) that the Special Board which will be presided over by the Sultan’s Port Authority should consist of Omani and British members in equal numbers. Further, in so far as the lights in Omani waters are concerned, in view of the fact that they are being maintained by the Persina) Gulf Lighting Service Fund, the Sultan has agreed that a contribution will be paid to the Fund from the revenue dgved under the above Article towards the maintenance of these lights. As, however, the levy of the proposed dues by his Government will increase the total amount levied from shipping in the Persian Gulf, the Sultan desired an assurance to be given that the rate of lightdues levied in the Gulf would be reduced in proportion to the reduction in the present cost of the lighting service brought about by the contemplated arrai^ements. After a careful examination of the matter the Government of India felt that there was no objectionto the request of the Sultan being complied with, and they have authorised that the assurance asked for may be given. 3. I am to request that the matter may be reported to the Persian Gulf Lighting Service Advisory Committee for their information I have, etc., 5d/- A. N.

The original treaty was given a term of twelve years, which was extended at regular intervals afterwards, initially for several years at a time and later on an annual basis.The volume covers the period May 1938-February 1939 (abbreviated as 'Feby' on the volume's cover). It documents informal discussions between the two parties regarding the replacement of the treaty; it also includes extensive correspondence discussing amendments, drafts and revised drafts. Also discussed are discrepancies between the English and Arabic texts of the draft treaty, and preparations for the final signature copies of the new treaty.The correspondence largely consists of interdepartmental discussion between officials of the India Office, Foreign Office, the Colonial Office, the Board of Trade, and the Government of India's External Affairs Department. Other correspondents include the Secretary of State for India, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd].In addition to correspondence the volume contains a full draft of the new treaty (ff 11-45) and notes on meetings between British representatives and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman in April 1938, concerning amendments to particular articles (ff 48-60).The Arabic language material consists of several items of correspondence and draft Arabic translations of certain passages from the treaty (English texts appear alongside the Arabic translations).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1939)</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India and Burma, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Indian Political Service, External Affairs Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Colonial Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Treaties</topic></subject><subject><topic>Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between Great Britain and Muscat (1891)</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x00001e#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
