NEW DELHI : PRINTED BY THE MANAGER GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PRESS : 1936(D A REPORT ON CYPRUS. Based on a tour of this Island carried out by Colonel G. Craster, CB.E.,D.S.O., late Indian Army (Retired), with the object of assessing its suitability for settle- ment by officers of the Indian Army affected by the War Block Scheme. NEW DELHI : PRINTED BY THE MANAGER GOVERNMENT OF INDIA PRESS : 193S11 FOREWORD. It is considered that those officers who contemplate residing in Cyprus after retirement will find a great deal to interest them in the following tour report. Colonel G. Craster, C.B.E., D.S.O., Indian Army (Retired), willingly consented to write this Report during his stay on the Island and the Cyprus Government have kindly defrayed all expenses incurred therewith. It is thought that the publication of his tour report may result in mutual benefit both to a British Colony and to those officers who, as a result of the information contained in the following pages, decide to give the Island a trial visit. Although this report is published by Army Head quarters, the reader is asked to bear in mind the fact that any views, opinions, or criticisms expressed by the writer are entirely his own. Before his departure Colonel Craster was asked to write an unbiassed report on Cyprus and to record his impressions exactly as they would appear from the War Block officers’ point of view. In this respect he has faithfully and ably carried out these instructions. Since this report was written, an article headed “Orange Groves in Cyprus” has appeared in “Truth” of 10th June 1936. An extract from the article is given below to underline Colonel Craster’s advice that those interested in Citrus Growing “had best come and see for themselves before committing themselves”. “Orange Groves in Cyprus. I have lately heard from Cyprus that efforts are being made to interest Indian Army officers in the scheme of a local company for the sale of plots of land as “orange groves.” The price asked is £550—payable by instalments—for a holding of 2^ acres, and the vendor company undertakes planting and cultivation with oranges or grape-fruit for a period of five years. At the end of that period (or earlier, if he desires) the owner can take over the management of his grove, or alternatively the company will enter into a contract to carry on the work and market the fruit. Attractive estimates of “possible profits” are given, but as the investors in the SouthIll African “orange groves” discovered, estimates based on the production and sale of fruit at remunerative prices years hence may easily prove to be illusory. In the past, at any rate, such purchase—and—planting propositions have never turned out satisfactorily ” (By kind 'permission of the Editor, “Truth'). N. C. BANNATYNE, Major General, Military Secretary. Simt a ; September 1936.REPORT ON CYPRUS TO ASSESS ITS SUITABILITY FOR SETTLEMENT BY OFFICERS OF THE INDIAN ARMY AFFECTED BY THE WAR BLOCK SCHEME. This report was undertaken at the request of the Information Bureau (for officers affected by the War Block Scheme) of the Military Secretary’s Branch, Army Headquarters, India; to whom I had offered my services as I intended to visit Cyprus on my way home from India. The Cyprus Government was addressed by Army Headquarters and agreed to give me facilities for making the report. It is regret ted that the report was not submitted earlier as I was unable to reach Cyprus till the end of February, 1936. 1 wish at the outset to express thanks to the Colonial Secretary and the Commissioners of Districts in Cyprus, who have helped me to get in touch with residents and others; and also to those gentlemen who have assisted me by giving information and statistics and showing me their own estates and concerns. I would mention especiallv Mr. Cecil Davis, th&lt;&gt; proprietor and editor ot the “Cyprus Mail’’, who, through his paper, was primarily con cerned in pressing the claims of Cyprus on Army Headquarters. 1. General. —The attraction of Cyprus lies in its natural beauty, its fine, sunny yet bracing winter climate, and inexpensive living. It has good roads and drives along the coast no whit less lovely than the Riviera Corniche, unspoiled by modern buildings oi unsightlv industrial erections. In spring the wealth of wild flowers enhances its loveliness. Its mountains provide a cool and healthy summer resort amongst beautiful woods and delightful scenery. Its arch geological and mediaeval remains are of intense interest, and more ancient monuments exist than could be found in a similar area in any other country in the world. It produces almost every- thing that man needs including wine and tobacco, and as yet it is not over exploited. Last but not least it is a British Colony closer to England than any other country mentioned in the Army Head quarters “Summary of Information except Malta. 2. Social. —.Cyprus differs from most other British Colonies n that the resident here is neither among a coloured population as in Africa, nor among an entirely English speaking community as in Canada or Australia. The inhabitants of Cyprus are for the most part Greek-speaking Cypriots. Rather more than a fifth of the population is Mohammedan (Turkish). The English popula tion out of a total of 370,000 is only about 500 to 800 (it fluctuates greatly owing to the large number of winter residents) including2 officials. The result is that living in Cyprus is more like being one of an English community in a foreign European country than in an English Colony, whether an all British Colony like New Zealand or one with coloured population and labour. The use o English in Cyprus has noticeably increased of late years, and as it is now being systematically taught in schools its use mil increase. A knowledge of the local dialect of Greek is, however, p. very important factor in daily life. Generally speaking the English settled community would be congenial to the class for whom this report is written. Labour and domestic service are cheap. Servants can become very good with training but unless one engages the more costly English-trained ones considerable patience is needed. M ages are dealt with in a later paragraph. Thprp is an Armenian community which tends steadily to in crease. The English communities are concentrated. The greatest number is in Nicosia, where there is a considerable official com munity, and the British Infantry detachment from the Soudan,— one company. The place most favoured for settlement by English folk is Famagusta, where there are several successful citrus growers. Kyrenia on the north coast is another favourite spot but here the English population is more residential than working. Kyrenia is a popular winter resort for visitors. At the south coast ports of Larnaca and Limassol there is no English settled community, only one or two engaged in various businesses such as the wine trade and the few district officials. The western part of the Island, although most attractive and favoured climatically, has not been touched by English settlers, and there is perhaps possibility of profitable undertaking there, particularly if several prospective residents would combine with both capital and effort so that prospects would be better and any feeling of isolation would be mitigated. The club at Famagusta is almost exclusively English ; those at Larnaca and Limassol are more cosmopolitan. There is a fairly good library at the Nicosia club, and also a private library with a subscription of Tl per annum. 3. Climate and Health. —As stated in the Information Bureau’s publication, the climate is, generally speaking, healthy and the winters cool and invigorating. It must be realized however that it gets very hot in summer. There is nothing to worry about till June. The worst months are July to September. The maximum temperatures in the four months June—September at Nicosia in3 1934 were F. 106°, 111°, 106° and 96°. June, though hot, is said to be less trying than September, when it is damp. At Famagusta I was told that children remain there all the summer without ill- effect as the sea air and bathing keep them fit. Paphos and the west coast are said to be the coolest part in summer as also milder in winter. The minimum temperature at Nicosia in 1934 was F. 31 in January and February. Malaria used to be prevalent in the Island but anti-malarial measures have reduced this danger so that with ordinary precau tions there is little to fear. Cyprus is remarkably free from other diseases prevalent in the East, e.g. } small-pox (nil in 1934 and 1935) and dysentery of which only one case occurred among the British population in 1934, and only 1 per cent in the whole population. Sand-tlies however are said to be a serious pest in the hot weather. While the heat in summer may be trying it is easy to escape from it. On the central mountainous massif of which the summit is Troodos (6,090 ft.) the climate is cool throughout the summer. It must be very like a Himalayan hill station at about 8,000 ft.— that is to say a hot sun in the day-time and a quick drop in temperature after sunset. At Troodos, where it has been the cus tom for a few senior officials to carry on their work in the hottest months, the maximum temperature (shade) in the four months June to September is about F. 90° and the minimum 48°. It is easy to reach Troodos by car from any part of the Island in a few hours. Medical facilities in Cyprus are good and efficient. There are Government District Medical Officers at all the principal towns. Fees appear to be much the same as in the country at home, but hospital accommodation is cheaper, 12/6d. a day for a private ward, with lower scales according to the accommodation. There are hospitals at Nicosia, Kyrenia, Larnaca, Limassol, Famagusta and Paphos. There are plenty of Cypriot dentist, some of whom are quite moderally good and reliable. 4. Educational. —Cyprus as yet lacks any special educational facilities for the children of English settlers or officials. Primary education for small children can be got in Nicosia and Famagusta in each of which places there is a children’s school or class run by an English lady. There used to be a kindergarten in Kyrenia, now closed for lack of support. More classes of this type would be forthcoming at once if there was an adequate demand. In Nicosia there is an American academy at which sound education is given, but it is for Cypriot boys and is American not4 # English. English children have been sent to it with good results. But once the preparatory stage is passed it would be necessary to send children to England or elsewhere. For those who wish to have their children educated in England while not living there themselves Cyprus is advantageous because of its proximity. The P and 0.’ run school steamers in the summer holidays, the return fare being about £15. But this is the hottest time of year in Cyprus, so that if it meant sending mother and child to the hills with additional hotel expenses, the cost, together with other incidental expenses, would be not less than £10. Those who do not wish their children to become Colonial^ must inevitably face certain expenses, and for them, Cyprus has much to recommend it, 5. Recreational. —There is an 18 hole golf course at Nicosia with a £2-2-0 entrance and £2-2-0 annual subscription. There are three other indifferent 9 hole courses at Famagusta, Kyrenia and Limassol. Tennis can be played on hard courts at the English clubs and at the hill resorts. Shooting is free except for a 15/- licence. The import duty on a gun is £5 and a gun licence £1. Cartridges are expensive about 25/- a hundred. Luck and snipe are to be had in certain districts, chiefly Limassol. Apart from them the principal game is the red legged partridge, the same in appearance and habit as the. Himalayan “chikor”, also woodcock. If shooting alone a good dog is essential. (There is a six months quarantine for dogs, which may be extended to nine months if the animal comes from a bad rabies country.) I believe Limassol is considered the best shooting district, but partridges and hares are found all over the Island. There is no river fishing and sea fishing is poor. Polo is no longer played in Cyprus nor are there any hounds, though both these sports were carried on in the past. Fairly good ponies and light horses are bred. There used to be a considerable e^ort to Egypt, which has ceased entirely. Cyprus bred ponies would not live with the class of horse now used in first class polo. For anyone fond of riding however there is no difficulty in finding a well-bred horse or pony, the produce of one or other of the Government T. B. stallions which are available to breeders. From what I have seen of the country in the course of a three -weeks tour there is little ground of the sort that invite? riding for riding’s sake. A pack of hounds or a bobbery pack would make all the difference. There are plenty of foxes I believe.There is a certain amount of racing and gymkhana meetings are held at Nicosia and Larnaca. The sea bathing from March onwards is a great feature of English life in Cyprus. Sailing and boating could be indulged in by any who cared but there is no club, nor are sailing boats other than the local fishing boat available for hire or purchase. 6. Communications and Travelling— There are good tarred roads between all the principal towns and up to the hill resorts, so that with a car one can travel from end to end of the Island quickly and easily. Apart from these there are metalled roads of varying quality leading to the bigger villages. Hotels in Cyprus have improved very much in recent years, and at all the large towns and in one or two villages, especially hill villages, there are hotels which though not luxurious, are mode rately good. There are also two really good hotels, the Park Hotel at Platres, and the Dome Hotel at Kyrenia. The latter is much frequented by English and other tourists in winter and in spring. In the Troodos hills the chief resorts are Pedhoulas, Prodhromos and Platres at each of which places there are hotels filled with Egyptians in the summer. Some senior officials of Government have houses at Troodos and usually spend the hottest months in residence there, a fairly good hotel exists there as well as camps in which accommodation must be booked ahead. During the hot months some of the English residents in Nicosia who can do so go either to the hills or to the seaside, but those who have no children mostly prefer to remain in their own houses, as do the majority of Government officials who are stationed at Nicosia. Hotels are cheap, the tariff being from 7/- to 10/- a day. In the hills the rates are somewhat higher. The rates in the Troodos camps are about 10/- for adults and 5/- for children. Access to Cyprus from Egypt is by the Khedivial mail steamer which makes the round trip from Alexandria and Port Said to Cyprus ports weekly. The first class fare is £3-10-0 ; at present there is no second class and third is very bad indeed. There is a weekly Italian service to and from Brindisi by which one can reach London in five days. The Messageries Mari- times call at Larnaca fortnightly; and passages can be had on the “Prince” and “Moss” lines of cargo boats to England but they sail to no regular schedule. There is no air service to Cyprus at present. The establishment of an Imperial airport in Cyprus would seem to be a not unlikely eventuality and if this came about it would make a great difference : facilities would probably be paid for, among other ways, by increased cost of living..6 A public telephone has just been established and is in operation this year. 7. Cost of Living. —The estimate given in the Information Bureau’s “Summary”, Appendix B, £300 a year lor a family ol four is on the low side, especially at first; but there is no doubt that a man with enough land for a garden, poultry and perhaps a cow could be almost self-supporting, and after a year or so he could live on less. If he could extend his garden to produce a surplus he could make it profitable. In Nicosia, the capital, living is somewhat more costly and rents higher. Quite good clothes, boots, etc., can be had very cheaply; a useful suit of English tweed for £8 to £4 and serviceable boots for 15/- to 25/-. Furniture is cheap; there are good carpenters and artificers. The cost of furnishing a small house excluding cutlery, crockery or luxury is placed at £100 to £200 ; I should think the latter is an outside figure for more necessities with reasonable comfort. The scale of wages Cook (man) House boy Gardener . Garden labour from Casual labour . approximately :— £2 to £4 a month. 25/to £3 £2 to £4 £ 1-10 1 /6 to 2 6 a day. A small house is usually run by a cook and a house boy. Female servants get rather less. Bents of unfurnished houses are from £36 to £84 per annum. A house for two adults and a children’s or spare room can be built for £300, but it would be wise to reckon the minimum cost with garage, water supply and sanitation, electric light and out houses at £600. An intending resident can bring in all his personal effects and household goods free of customs duty provided it arrives not more' than three months after himself (this period may shortly be extended). This concession does not include guns, pianos, or new furniture. There is no doubt that the copt of living in Cyprus is higher than it was a few years ago but it still remains one of the cheapest places in the Empire. 8. Opportunities for Augmenting Income. —(i) General—What Major Cawthorn said about Southern Rhodesia in this respect ap plies equally to Cyprus or indeed to any Country, varying only according to its industrial and economic development. That is, thatthere is no doubt that opportunities suitable for a man of 88 to 40 with no definite qualifications are there for the making. Perhaps not so obvious as in a very new country like Southern Bhodesia. The motor trade and transport industry for instance is overcrowde with Cypriot concerns who, in their endeavours to underbid each other run their affairs with little if any profit. But Cyprus, although it has been 58 years under British .ad ministration, is still very undeveloped, therefore opportunities for a man of resource and enterprise are more than he could hope to find in a fully developed country where industries and markets are highly organized and all outlets are occupied. Cyprus is not a country to make a fortune in, but a prudent energetic man should be able to make a small amount of capital go further than it would elsewhere. It must however be remembered that in any industrial enter prise in Cyprus the ex-officer would have to compete against ( vpnot business humeri. In this connection my remarks under the “Social” head should be borne in mind. No enterprise can be undertaken without capital and the intending resident may, from the figures given, get some idea of what Cyprus has to offer, but he must judge for himself, prefer ably after a period of residence in Cyprus, how far he can profit ably extend his sphere of action in agricultural or other under takings. (ii) Citrus Growing .—This is the most obvious undertaking for an English resident in Cyprus and a number of Englishmen are already established as orange growers. Most of the groves I saw have not yet reached full production, so results, remain to be seen, hut one owner with many years’ experience in the near East, who originally bought an old grove and planted more himself, was making a very useful addition to his income of about £250 from an area of about 15 aeres of good citrus land. The approximate cost of purchase and development is dealt with in Appendix A. Profits depend on market prices which are good at present. But Cyprus is in competition with Palestine where the Jewish colony is increasing the output at an incredible rate with good organization for shipping and marketing. The Cyprus fruit is available at the same time of year as that of Palestine. 1 Cyprus being a British Colony can send its produce to British markets free of duty, which is a definite advantage to the shipper and so, indirectly, to the grower (Palestine has not this advantageh At present the growers are content to accept the prices offered by the merchants who ship the fruit and it goes without saying that the merchant sees most of the gain. It is thought that if growers (British and Cypriot) would combine to organize theirown selling agency in Covent Garden and perhaps other markets they would benefit greatly. Shipping from Cyprus is uncertain, hut a. Cyprus Shippers Association” has just been formed which will doubtless effect improvement. (iii) Citrus Districts and cost of land .—Hie districts in which citrus fruits for export are chiefly grown are Famagusta and Morphou. There are no English growers in Morphou. Fama gusta has a considerable colony and the price of good mange land near Famagusta has risen considerably. It cannot be bought there at less than £15 to £20 a “donum” (3 donums = l acre). Land at a distance from the towns and unirrigated land can be had very cheaply (from £3 a donum or even less). But citrus will only prosper on favourable soil and irrigation is essential. Expert advice and examination of the soil should be arranged lor. Deep boring produces water in most places on the plains but a watei test before purchase is required or the venture becomes a gamble. Citrus trees take 5 years before they are in full bearing and for this period other sources of income are needed. An established grove might he bought for say £100 a donum, which would be immediately productive. If a small grove could be got with unplanted land adjacent it would be a useful nucleus and help in the unproductive years. If several residents combined to take up land in one of the districts where there is at present no English community they would doubtless decrease the initial outlay and not be so cut off as a single individual would be away from his own countrymen. Paphos district has been suggested in this connect.on. It is most attractive. At present few oranges are grown there, but there is no reason why they should not be. Morphou is a tried orange district where good citrus land would be expensive. There are many delightful valleys and lands along the north coast where land can be had ; provided water is available there is no reason why citrus should not grow wherever the soil is suitable. Near Kyrenia land will cost not less than £10 a donum, and because of its popularity with English people as a residential part, land- owners are in some cases holding out for very high prices. It should also be remembered that the nearer the ports the better are the prices realised, since transportation costs are less. (iv) The Cyprus Palestine Plantation Company .—Near Limas sol a Jewish company has taken up over 400 acres of land which was previously uncultivated, or only sparsely so, because of the lack of water. Deep wells have been bored and the land is already largely planted by the most up-to-date methods. The land is laid out in units of 10 donums of 1,000 square metres each.# 0 Hoads connect every unit to a main road. One well is provided for 15 units. One or more of these units can be purchased for £550, payable 25 per cent, down and the remainder by instalments over 5 years. The price of one unit of 10,000 square metres (which may be a little more or less to fit the lie of the land) is £55 a donum, or £550 a unit. Each owner of a unit becomes the owner of a fifteenth share of a well, machinery, and common installation. The company takes complete charge of the work and undertakes to hand over the land to the purchaser after 5 years in excellent •condition and fruit bearing. Should a purchaser wish to take over the work in his own grove before 5 years he can do so by arrange ment with the company. The services of the company are avail able for packing, shipping and selling in the most favourable markets. The groves are planted with oranges and grape fruits and a small proportion of lemons. The company’s estimate of profits is given in Appendix B. By comparison with the figures in Appendix A it will be seen that it should be possible to buy and develop land independently at less outlay than what it costs to purchase from this company. On the, other hand the owner of a Cyprus-Palestine Plantation Company’s plot has the advantage of expert knowledge always available, the most up-to-date plant and machinery installed on a large scale, and a sound organization to assist in the disposal of his produce. If he wishes, he can learn the work on his own land under expert guidance. Limassol is not a proven orange district and it remains to be seen if its produce will find favour in Covent Garden, Analyses of soil and water on the company’s estates are favourable and citrus trees are planted only on land that is judged good for the purpose. On land not considered entirely suitable the company grows other crops, and keeps it in its own hands. Similar schemes have been tried in other parts of the Empire and have failed, notably in South Africa. Would-be investors had best come and see for themselves before committing themselves to the scheme. The question of finding a house in proximity to the groves remains. Land for this could be found within reasonable distance and the company has itself foreseen the necessity and reserved certain plots for building purposes. (v) Other possible undertakings for the sake of both occupation and profit .—Growing flax, cotton and other cereals. Flax is indigenous and its production would be profitable if facilities for preparing it for market were assured. In this connection see10 Appendix E describing a proposed enterprise of this nature. In quiries have been made for malted barley : no malting is done in Cyprus and this might be a profitable undertaking. Fruit growing other than citrus .—Wines both table grapes, sultanas and currants (grapes for wine are best left to the native'). Figs, peaches, apricots and cherries grow well and the Government Experimental Farms are testing various varieties and methods. The export of fruit juice, especially cherries, as also of preserved and dried fruits might be successful. Canning and bottling fruits and jam making. Almonds grow well and there is a considerable export. Growing vegetables and market garden produce. There is a good demand for tomatoes for export. The experimental farms have produced a tomato-potato cross which gives a tomato of a hard variety suitable for export at a time of year when they are not normally available. Poultry farming, if done by modern methods which would have to be mastered. There is great demand for high class poultry and fat turkeys for the Egyptian market. The outlay for this need not be great and it is a useful resource during the first unproductive years of citrus groves. Mule breeding .—The Cyprus mules are famous and the supply does not meet the outside demand. To do this on a big scale requires considerable capital and land. But if the dams are made use of on farm or garden, a mule or two a year would always be saleable and it would not cost much to keep a couple of mares. Cyprus mules are mostly jennets, i.e., the progeny of asses by a horse or pony stallion ; the reason for this is that there are more than ten times as many she-donkeys as mares. The excellent Cyprus donkey is the commonest beast in use on the land. The mule proper is bigger and stronger than a jennet. Mules are not sired by Government stallions but by privately owned donkeys and horses at very low fees. Pig bleeding and preparation of hams and bacon .—There is a good breed of pig in Cyprus, suitable for the purpose, and good demand for the produce which the Cypriot does not know how to prepare. Imported stock (both boars and bulls) is available for breeding at the Government studs. Dairy farming .—It needs considerable land and capital to instaT an up-to-date dairy. The Cypriot does not drink cow’s milk, and the demand for high grade milk is small. A quantity of cheese is made from goats’ and sheep’s milk. Sheep are said to be very profitable stock.11 In all branches of farming and gardening the advice and assistance of the Government experts is always available. There is a large stock farm at Athalassa, four miles from Nicosia. 9. Conclusion. —It must be impressed on readers of this report that my impressions were obtained from a very short stay in Cyprus, and (apart from statistics) I must perforce rely on “hearsay”. But I have visited every district and met a number of persons well qualified to speak—both Government officials, English inhabitants, and Cypriots. To summarise, I feel that Cyprus has much to recommend it as a place of residence ; for elderly folk it is a perfect winter resort. For a young man who wants to live his life it is much too limited both in actual area and in fields of occupation. There is very little in the way of field sports, and the keen games expert would long for wider courses and more competition. For the “War-Block” officer it may appeal to many who are still at a loose end, or who are not satisfied where they are. They are past their first youth. They will find in Cyprus a healthy climate in which children thrive. It is within a week’s journey (overland) of England. It can, with comparatively little outlay, provide interesting and profitable occupation. The Englishman can do manual labour on his own land without loss of “izzat”. Living is very cheap. I think it appeals especially to the man who wants to educate his children in England while not living there himself, or to be within easy reach of Great Britain for any other reason : to the man with a liking for historical or archaeological research : to one whose health is not of the most robust, or whose wife is not strong enough to face the personal labour that colonial life often entails. It is also within easy reach of some of the most interesting countries of Europe and Asia Minor, and of course Egypt. If further information is wanted on any special point I shall be here myself until April, 1937 (address : Kyrenia, Cyprus) and shall be happy to answer inquiries or to put officers in communica tion with those who know.

Proposal to form a company for the purpose of acquiring a certain area of land and forming it for all kinds of cereals, cotton, flax, etc., and to establish a mill for threshing and grinding grain, and machinery for scutching flax, as well as to grow fruit and to breed sheep and poultry and establish a bacon factory. The land belongs to a retired officer (formerly 4th Hussars) and he wishes to transfer to the proposed company in the first instance 2,000 acres and building thereon sufficient to make up ten dwelling bungalows. The land is situated in the central plain, 9 miles from Nicosia and 16 miles from the port of Larnaca. The main road runs througji th&amp; estate. It is reported on as most suitable for growing and preparing flax. The river Yalia runs through the southern portion of the estate. Water is obtainable at 20 to 30 feet over the greater part of the area, and the higher ground is suitable for vines and almonds. Capital is required to the extent of £15,000 at the outset, a ^ 1( l if this is forthcoming the idea is that occupation can be provided fo&gt; a limited number of resident shareholders who would occupy important supervising jobs. It would be uneconomical to pay for these at more than the current local rates; the salary would therefore be nominal but shareholders would have to look on it as helping to run their ow n show the more efficient the work the greater the profit. It is also proposed to enlist the co-operation of certain German Jews who have been obliged to leave Germany. Some of these are men of substance but they cannot take their money out of Germany except in the form of exports. The idea is therefore that they should pay ioi their shares by providing plant and machinery from Germany. They would also bring the mercantile business element which is necessary to success. The company would be incorporated under the laws which are the same as the British Company laws. Detailed information can be supplied to those who are interested.
