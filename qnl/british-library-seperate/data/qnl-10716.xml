                           Al Moayedfrom 19 June 1910 that gives details of a battle between a force under the leadership of Shaikh Jaber Mubarak Al Sabah and Shaikh Sa'dun Al Mansur (folio 71).The file also contains correspondence concerning the robbery of a British individual named William Hickey in Kuwait in 1910 (folios 63-65).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><geographic>Iraq</geographic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b5#share">Public Domain</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b5#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003b5#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
