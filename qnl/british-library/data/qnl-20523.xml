Copies are being sent to the Foreign Office, and are being submitted here, for consideration: but at the moment it is purely provisional and has no approval of higher authority behind it. Since it was written, we have heard from the Anglo Persian Oil Company that according to one member (Haji a .i 1 .Williamson) of the Geological party which visited ^latar in jJ'eoruary and March 1930 s the Southern ooundary line shown on their map was indicated by the Shaikh and it looks therefore as though we can with reasonable coniidence assume that this is his own view at the present time of his southern boundary. This should go a long way to clear the air, though it will leave us with the difficult problems of the attitude to be adopted in respect of the area between the Sheikh's line and the blue line of the 1913 Convention. In this connection we should be grateful for any information you can give us by air mail as to (a) The position to-day in the Barr A1 Qarah • 'TPhilby 1 s i * Empty Quarter' suggests that such authority or jurisdiction as may be exercised in it is of an informal character and exercised by Ibn Jiluwi and the Saudi Government.

I agree that question should not be raisedl -with Ibn Saud but if he learns that we L 7* ^ have defined Qatar boundary as suggested he will probably as sume•..2a assume that we recognise his sovereignty up to that boundary.

His Majesty's Crovernment are prepared to give (A)0 Shaikh a guarantee in respect of unpro voiced aggression 'by land in return for grant 'by him of an Oil Concession to Anglo-Persian Oil Company (acting fcr 'Iraq Petroleum Company) 'but are anxious to confine it to major aggression , l # e. to unprovoked attack by Ruler of a neighbouring State and to major Bedouin raids. xhey could not without establishing regular defensive system cm frontier -which they cannot contemplate give an assurance that in no circumstances would any small hostile force be allowed to cross Q^atar boundary and they cannot accept liability for meeting minor, raids. ^'ore over here in Kuwait they wo uld of course expec^ Shaikh to take reasonable steps for his own defence and for maintaining it in order in his own borders. If as His Majesty's Government hope a guarantee within these limits will satisfy Shai Mi they suggest tl at it might be in lollowmg team t that ''in the event of anv serious and • —-— 1 ■' ^ 'UKprovoked attack His Majesty's Government will come to his assistance and maintain independence of his State'. 2. His Majesty's Governraorit have considered as an « ( . : hir u -rv ^ ' 'w' _ an assurance on the lines ot Kuisait formula of 1914, i.e. that C^a+ar shall 'be recogpised as an independent principality under British protection. This seems unlikely to satisfy Shaikh since His Majesty's Grovemmerrt are already in treaty relations with him as an independent Ruler while tem M protectlon M thus used mi^it alazm him 'by sujesting idea of a protectorate. If however Hesid ent thinks Shaikh would prefer it either alone or with addition of formula suggested ahove he may use it so long as it is clearly understood 'by Shaikh that assurance of protection does n of go 'beyond limits specified in paragra|h 1. 3. It would of course he essential to obtain from Shaikh in return for any guarantee given the facilities required 'by the ^oyal Air ^orce to enable guarantee to he Implemented id est pro hah ly two landing ground, s and. freedom of movements for necessary British personnel. we^ssume that no difficulty will arise about this and that Shaikh would 'be willing to provide on payment guards for aerodrome. 4. The question of precise 'boundaries t o he adopted is still under reference to Resident (see India Office telegran of S'ehruaiy 16th 1934, J^o.440;. Subject to your further views His Majesty s Government consider that area to which above guarantee should apply should for the present not be regarded as extending to south of a line drawn from a point at head of DOHA m -AS-3i!ULWA bay passing south of SAL VA and of ^ ^ ^ K to coast Immediately north of KHOH— AL-CDSrD inlet, 5.

Witn regard to your para. 1, I have not seen Goates since I got your letter, but any suggestion tnat he may nave made to Chisholm with regard to his visit to Qatar was entirely in private conversation, and whetner Chisholm had agreed or not, no visit of that description would have been undertaken without my sanction and previous reference to you or your representative. 2, With regard to your para. 2, Coates is .eutenant Colonel T. C. Fowle, The Residency, B u s h i re.primarily a recordirig officer to 203 Squadron, and Jias just passed nis colloquial in Arabic. He very often proceeds with tne flying boats down the Ciulf as their interpreter and recording officer. His main interest is in topographical information which is required, and not in general intelligence, 3. Apart from this I am quite prepared to agree to the principle that no H.A.iJ 1 . intelligence onicer will visit areas in the Gulf without reference to the Political Agent concerned. This principle I had already agreed to with your predecessor. A visit by Coates or his successor in flying boats should not be misinterpreted. other hand it would enormously help me here if you or your poiitical officers would keep me in touch with any points of interest which may arise Irom time to time, both with regard to the activities of the oil companies and the general behaviour of the shaikhs, as a condition might arise when our assistance might be required, both in co-operation with the sloops or independently. /Para. 5.-2- 5, WiitJi regard to your para. 3 ; tiie visit of Finch to Sharjah was to replace Captain Makay ytiom I could not afford to leave peraianently at Sharjah until the completion of the Rest Rouse, He was in no way concerned with intelligence duties there, but was the only officer 1 had available who could talis: Arabic and who could to some extent be responsible that the monies involved in the erection of the Rest House were not misappropriated. You will remember that there had been some difficulty in this connection prior to Ma^ay* s arrival. 6, With regard to your para. 4. iviany thanks for sending me xiajji 'Williamson's report which was most interesting, the last paragraph of which rather confirms the conversation you and I had when we last met at Bahrain on this subject, 1 understand that the India Office are now considering the desirability of offering the Shaikh a guarantee of protection against external aggression in exhhange for concessions on his part. If anything comes of this it will be ye ssential'b 7 f essential for us to be given an opportunity of examining lively sites on tile gro-and for land planes and flying boats before committing ourselves definitely on the subject. As you know, the success of air ape rations depends very largely upon efficient intelligence and I shall be most gratexul to you for all facilities in tni s connection when tne time comes.

My dear Laithwaite, I am afraid there has been a little delay in answering your letter Fo• P#2* 614/34 oj . t ^e «-'9th January about the ^atar boundaries. 2, I an now asked to let you know that we are in general agreement with the suggestions made in the note by you enclosed in your letter; but we have asked Byan in my letter of the 1st February, of which you have already had a copy, for his observations on any points concerning Ibn Saua, and pending those observations we cannot naturally give final concurrence. On one point in particular we have some doubts pentiing further consideratioi on the receipt of Ryan f s views, namely the question of the line to be taken if Ibn ^aud bases a claim to t tie Barr-al- Qarah on the line indicated to him by Sir Percy Oox in 1922. We should, in principle, like to avoid dissension with Ibn 3aud on this as on other matters, and we do not feel certain that we could justifiably take the line suggested in paragraph 19 (c) (ii) of your memorandum. 3. We auite agree, however, that we should, if possible, avoid the question arising with Ibn Baud au allj :-0 tnis point can well be left for more detailed consideration in the light of any view which Byan may express; and perhaps the result of your reference to Bir Percy Oox may indicate how far we should consider ourselves committed by his acuion in 1922. 4.

The trend of Shaikh T Abdullah T s conversation was as follows:- 'The agreement between me and the Anglo -Persian Oil Company Limited expires at the end of four months and then I can consider whether their oiler is best for me or another Company r s otier is best. I will inform G-overnment but I am sure thai tney will not wish me to accept an offer which is not the best. In the discussion which tool?; place between me and the Company (Anglo rersian Oil Company Limited) nothing could be arranged. Some time DacJ^ tney made an offer and after discussions I came to an understanding with their representative wno said that he only ¥\ranted to show the terms to the Company and then get it signed. The Company then changed their mind and made new offers which were not in my interest, i^r.uhisholm is not a straight-forward man and I did not expect tnat he will pa play a trick like this. (The Political Resident broke in tnat Mr.Chisholm would only be acting under the orders of his Company,so should not be thought personally responsible). The Company did not make an increase in the royalties which would be a source of real income to me. /TheThe Company made some increase in certain things but these are ol no importance. I tooic great pains and spent a lot of money in maintaining peace and order in the desert. Now I want to reap tlie fruits of my work. If I ask for more money from the Company it is because I will nave to pay naif of it to the bedouins and others (from the wording this clearly referred to Bin Sa'ud). If tne British Government do not allow me to give the concession to any otner Company whose offer may be suitable ? I will leave the land and will no longer &amp;kke trouble about it, as there is no benefit in retaining it when I cannot get proper profit from it. 11 4. The question of protection arose in connection with his remarks about payments to bedouin and he was pressed to say of what he was alraid. He spoke of a T, big enemy ff ana bedouin in general terms. The Political Resident reminded him of his request tor protection when tne aeroplane landing ground was being discussed,ana askea what was in his mind,tnen ana now. He replied that was past and should not be discussed now (but it was not clear whether ne meant that tne landing ground business was past or tnat he no longer desired protection so much), fie said ?, The question of protection is quite different one whicn requires a separate and lengthy discussion. I may accept protection provided it does not interfere witn my authority (sharafj).' 5. The Political Resident then said that he had sometnine: J 01, 5 private to say,and Shaikhs Hamad bin T Abdu 11 an, -Kha 11fan bin T Abdullah and Salih bin Mani T went out of the Majlis. The Political Resident then briefly recapitulated tne position, making it clear tnat ne would only be allowed to give tne concession to a Company which was partly British,that the Easa /Company(K) 6 3. Company was not British at all,and tiiat (tnough not so airectly stated) if he gave tne concession to tne Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited or other British Company,G-overnment would protect him. 6. Officers from H.M.S Fowey wiio had been inviteci to dinner then arrived; and the Shaikh was tola that tne matter would be discussed again on the following morning and that if he wished to talk things over with Shaikh Hamad or Salih bin Mam* ne ana there was no objection to their being present could do scy,should he wish it,at the next day's meeting.On the 12th March 1934 (at 10.00 hours) the Political Resident called on Shaikh T Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani,Ruler of Qatar . The ShaiKh received the Political Resident m his Qasr in tne town. Tnere were present tne Political Agent ? Bahrain, (Lieut-Colonel Loch) ,Shaii£h Hamad bin T Abdullan ana Salih bin Mani f . Before collee was ordered the Political Resident opened the discussion bj asicing the Snaiich if ne had talked the matter over with tne persons present. Shaiidi. /es: but Salih was not present as he accompanied you. resident. In short we talked about tne oil concession,and I have been authorized by Eis Majesty T s Government to inform you that they would not agree to tne concession being given to a Company which is not partly British, bn^ikh. It is unjust for me that I should be prevented from doing what I think is best in my interest. In Kuwait the concession is under discussion (here he meant that the Shaikh of Kuwait has tne option to decide wnat ne thought best) and in Bahrain where the Government have influence the concession has been given to a loreign Company. I ao not think that the G-overnment would ao injustice m my case. Resident, (produced Article V of the Treaty). According to tms you cannot give the concession to any Company without tne consent of the G-overnment. * Shaiidi, I have not yet given any concession,but,il at the expiry of tne period allowed to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company,! do not come to an understanding witn them, I will give a Prospecting License to any Company wno come forward to me and if alter tne Prospecting License is over I come to an agreement with them I will submit /the *i^ote. It is clear that Shaikh f Abdullah and his advisers nave been carelully and cleverly tutored.the same to His Britannic Majesty's Grovernment for tneir approval ana only after getting their consent that I will grant the concession. lie si dent « No foreign Company will taice the Prospecting License if they are not sure of getting tne concession. It would only be waste of time for them. It would also be difficult for lour Excellency to refuse them. Shaikh. I will make a stipulation in tne agreement and tney will be bound to abide by its terms. I will then refer the matter to the Government and if they do not agree I will see what can be aone then. ( ShaiKh Hamad . The matter is a commercial one and it is lor us to see what is best in our interests. I do not thinic that the Government would like to press us ana do us injustice. The Bahrain Oil Concession was given to a foreign Company,although Bahrain is under the influence of the Government). I will convey to the Highest Authorities of the Government what I nave to say then and as it is now only a verbal conversation and nothinp- in black and white m a formal way I need not add iurther. Surely the Government would not agree to anything contrary to rules ana justice. When Knox wanted to do (he did not mention what was that thing) they did not allow him. At any rate I nave not yet done anything contrary to the terms of the Treaty and would leave matters for discussion when such terms are being infringed. -The Treaty does not include tne interior but only the coast ana I have some other arrangement with Bin Sa'ud according to which no one ventures to encroach upon my territory. He aoes not /encroach0 3. encroacji upon my territory because I am very I'nenaiy witn mm ana do not do anything which aispieases him besides my giving him something. Resident . According to Bin Sa r ud f s Treaty with the British G-overnment he cannot intertere m your affairs and it is because of your Treaty with the Government that he cannot do anything and it he does,the Govern ment will prevent him. And you are the Ruler of all Qatar and the Treaty extends to the whole of i^atar. Shaikh . But I ao not see why I should be compelled to give the concession to the Anglo-Fersian Oil Company. If the Anglo-Persian Oil Company do not offer me good terms according to the agreement between me and their representative and I am not satisfied with what they offer,and if I am not allowed by the Government to give it to others I will leave the oil in its place and give it to no one. I lived all this time without oil. I am now frightened of this Company. I thought that whenever trouble arises between me and the Company,the Government will act as an arbitrator between us. I now see that it is the Government wno is fighting to get the concession for tne Anglo- Persian Oil Company. If this is the case to whom can I submit my complaint against them if tney happen to take tne concession. Resident . The Government want Your Excellency to give the oil concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company but they would not necessarily compel you to give it to them. They would not agree to the concession being given to a Company which is not partly British. If you give the concession to the Anglo-Persian Oil Company they /are0 are under the influence of tne Government,who will be able to help jou^na there will be less interference in your affairs. I think that Your Excellency thinks tnat tne Anglo-Persian Oil Company is a G-overnment concern ana tnat there will,therefore,be interference in your authority. If you give tne Concession to a foreign Company the G-overnment will then interfere ! 1 more*for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company nave their head quarters in London and tne G-overnment can Dnng pressure on them there,whereas if it is a foreign Company,then the G-overnment will have to interfere with them in ^atar instead. (This point was emphasised more than once). I have not come on behalf of tne Company but for the Political part of the matter which is the affair of the G-overnment which is concerned about their Treaty with you. Political Agent . I came here with Mr.Bill when this Treaty was made between you and the G-overnment,and ever since there have been very friendly relations between you and the G-overnment and we come now in order to explain and discuss matters so that tne ties of friendship become stronger. Shaikh . I am very tnankful to the G-overnment on wnose strong friendship I have always relied ana believe that nad it not been for their friendship my ties witn others would nave been very weak. Resident . It is this friendship whicn had prevented people from encroaching on your territory. (The Political Agent .ind you remember that your relations were afraid to do any thing on account of your friendship witn tne G-overnment). (5)./ / s* ■ t 5. Stiaikh. No,when I asked tor help on various occasions I was as tola that/the trouble was an internal one tne G-overn- ment would not give me any help. ( Political A /?emt . But Sir Percy Cox offered to help you against your brother,Khalifah,but afterwards you said that you aid not need the help). Yes,this is true. My position is not like Kuwait or Bahrain. In Kuwait tne Shai&amp;h was m trouble with Bin Hashid ana the Government Helped him when he was m difficulty. In Bahrain Shaikh T Isa was a refugee in Qatar and it was the G-overnment who took him to Bahrain and made him a Shaikh. Before the Treaty with the G-overnment I was an independent Shaikh and no people could encroach on my territory. The Qatar people themselves requested me to accept the shaikhdom and I have documents m support ol tnis. ( Political A^ent . Yes,I have read m my records about this). I fought against the ? 0man people,Shai-fch Zaid bin Saqr of Abu Dhabi,ana nave also had a fight with the Bahrain people. Had it not been for tne Government I also mignt have been able to extend my territory, as everyone woula like to extena his Kingaom. It is tne Treaty tnat haa preventea me from doing this,but tne Grovermnent did not conler on me tne Snaiidiship. Resident . I told you yesterday that tnere is something else which I wanted to tell you. In the past the G-overnment promised to protect you by sea and also to give their gooa offices (i.e.,words) m the event of an attach on you by land. Now the G-overnment are prepared to protect you against an attack by land ana to help you 7 /1 th the necessary force in case of an attack upon you. /That# 6 That is to protect the whole of Qatar. This is an important thing for it means that not only would you rule in safety,but in time (which G-od forbia) it will mean that your successors of the Ibn Thani Family will I continue to rule. ShaiKii . That is quite a different matter (at this stage,however, it was noticeable that tne Shailch showed a marked cnange of attitude). The whole matter is tne question of giving the Anglo-Persian Oil Company tne concession. I am prepared to do so provided tney be fair ana not greedy. They can discuss matters urgently with me before the expiry of tne four months as much iiarm might result by the delay. I had come to terms witn them ana it only remained for their representative to get their consent when they changed their attitude. hesioent.

At tne ena of the talk it was aecided that the Political Resident would return to Lohah on Saturaay,the 31st March 1^4, equivalent to the Ibth Dhil Kijjaj. The Snaikh remarked when standing with the Political Resident and the Political Agent, that this matter is a secret one,from which it appears that the Shaikh is afraid that tne suggestion m±gk^ made might be heard e£ by some people (most probably he is afraid of Bin Sa T ua) and will try to create trouble for him.; -jo Shaikh^ demand . 1.

The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Probl^ms^ The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the ^ q 6 TI ' Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salvva to a point north of 0 Khor-al-'Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (a) the southern boundary of Qatar ; {})} if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the interveuing area. The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East. St To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405. north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.'* The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. II, 88- have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they 89 - have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-'Odeid, which lies about mid way between the extreme points referred to, as appertaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. II, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of 'Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-'Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuwaihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established which can with confidence be regarded as marking the western limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection with the compilation of Mr. Lorimer's 'Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula was, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the difference at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer. For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al-'Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 12, 12 2.34 0OPY SENT ip.z. 299/34. Stflf so i-ilW Kills Il( ' The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5. Discussion over the years 1911-13 between the Turkish Government and His Majesty's Government on the various matters in dispute between them in ^ Persian Gulf area culminated in the latter year in the signature of two Conventi defining inter alia the eastern limits of Turkish, authority in Arabia. Fhe Conventii of 29th July 1913, which defined the eastern boundary of Nejd, is alone relevant for the present purpose. Under that Convention, which, though reference is made to in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified}* 1 the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of Nejd was defined by a blue line (j the map running due south from the head of tho bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh IslandP^ 11 the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. Tli text of the relevant article is given in section 11 of the Appendix attached to this Note Its wording (' une ligne . . . separera le Nedjd de la presqu'ile d'El Katr. limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would justify contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the westen frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In tt first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of Hi Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that the? had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions ii this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar so to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th Januaryi 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the interioi of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now unde! consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance the position vis-a-vis Ibn Sand is to some extent compromised, as explained below at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in 1922, Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Convention, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsula, need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninspla was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab polite entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural, linally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaries of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate! ownership between those boundaries and the blue line.

Map of February-March 1933. Jilarit g. The map compiled by the LP.C. geologists during their survey in Qatar in this Tif'ebruary-March 1933 marks a southern boundary line starting on the sea-coast e ■itelinmediately south of Jabul-el-Naksh about 10 miles north of Salwa town and :lil % miles north of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, turning abruptly to the south- P^uch-east immediately south-east of Jabnl-el-Naksh for a distance of some 12 miles tylijfel Qalat-ali-Bin-Said, and thence running due east, leaving Tuair-al-Hamir on its through the Wadi-al-Ghurban to the sea, which it apparently reaches at a point arovertome 8 miles north of the outlet of the Khor-al-'Udeid inlet and not very far into the as arerlaqiyan Sandhills, ierioii The A.P.O .c., in communicating a copy of this map, remarked : The dotted line p .z. 456/34. 3 expfconndary to the south of Qatar is apparently the Sheikh's version of the line. The 'ercyCuP.C. report, however, is not definite about this.' 19131 The A.P.O.C. have since reported that, according to one member (Haji A.

If the line in fact represents his view, the boundary, as will be seen, will iwasuprrespond very closely to the pre-war line recorded by Lorimer. to tie as is s Conclusions as to the Southern Boundary of Qatar. S. It is suggested, in the light of the evidence collected above-- (а) that the south-eastern boundary of Qatar must lie to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid and the district oi; 'Aqal; (б) that while His Majesty's Government had at no stage formally recognised any specific southern boundary to Qatar (save to the extent referred to in (a)), such evidence as is available goes to show that the pre-war boundary ran roughly south-east across tke base of the Peninsula, from Dohat-as-Salwa, or a point slightly north of it, to a point north of the Khor-al-'Odeid. There is no recorded evidence of any more extensive claims by the Sheikh of Qatar other than those to Abu Dhabi territory referred to in paragraph 2 above ; (c) in the light of the above, that, if it proves that the Sheikh of Qatar now regards the line shown on the I.P.C. map as his southern boundary, this may be accepted by His Majesty's Government as generally satisfactory. Acceptance of that line, if we continue to regard the blue line of the 1913 Convention as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territories (or even if we were to agree to the attribution of the Barr-al- Qarah district lying east of the blue line to Hasa (see paragraph 18 below)), will admittedly leave an area of undetermined ownership between ra^' Qatar and Nejd. The problems involved in this are discussed in greater detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however, His Majesty's ejd, 111 '' Uovernraent are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to Abu Dhabi ; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue (gli line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modiii- 'f.nJ cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below; and it 1 I has the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in 3 ; respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty's Government may think 635 'I it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the Sheikh,Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of ™ should be a line running via or to the north of Sakak more or less south-east frolj ' Dohat-as-Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid, the difficult question arises of the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of'1913, Importance of 'Maintaining the Blue Line. .on 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. While the 1913 Conventii was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turkisl authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Sad as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably tab ^ our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundary to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterlandol the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearlj involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treat] relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally iecognised, or of i establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question ^so powerful as to embarrassing from our point of view. Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundart of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in tlit present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territoir, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary ior Qatar running roughly across the base of tne Qatar I en insula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. There is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who has in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in tie Irucial hinterland-c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to srtch air area. But, though on this point further information will I song it Irom the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active- interest on tlie part ot Ahu Dhahi m any area to the west of 'Aqal. Assuming that no such claim exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the area as be.ongirig to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar; or» regard it as a political no-man s land. ' 13. If we recognised it as belonging to Ibn Saud we could, if necessary, call up him to keep Bedouin raids into Qatar from it under control.

The decision to regard it as a pol'dical no-man s land would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day.' As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr-al -Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain \llegiance to Ibn Saud, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rnb -al-Khali further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties ■involved may be less than they appear. The difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate in ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Saud, Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, ite eastern boot; which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong rom theewis to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area 'possessing only a few i 'clients of paw wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning ^ or -11,892- iu the hintok sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented asion would cli 44 to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid rulers, whosetii entering it unless m winter or m search ol a refuge from moie poweiful enemies cognised, or ol (cf. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40' via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor -al-'Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the _A1 Murra, who are a ^ tribe dwelling in ihe sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). be faced that ii Secondly, even though he travelled with a 'rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra Arabia Ibn Baud's ten tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the Felix ining rouglik party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area.

Mr. Thomas's remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (wdio in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section 111 of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A 2 le reasonsc The Barr-ai-Qaraii District. 18. The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that it embraces the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the pre-war western extremity of Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly, with the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the area left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn baud and Major Holmes by Sir P. Cox in 1922 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled through a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his 'Empty Quarter' is that the dominant political influence at the present da} 7 are the Saudi Government and the Ikhwan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Note. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it 'might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa'- in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumption the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of Nejd would have touched the pre-war limits of Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following:— (a) Boundaries of Qatar. —To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea ; on the south, a line running across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet. The line indicated on the I.P.O. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-ns-Salwa Bay, and so to ieduce the area oi sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (?&gt;) The bkie line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, oi the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of oaudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the me indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922, referred o m paiagraph 6, that His Majesty's Government should either— (i) concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded lemse ves as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but witiiout prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in qn, U11 ++ m 1 a - orina J t 1 ' eco gnition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this liQe- can ution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it may je on ot lei giounds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of mdeternnnnte territory bordering on the sea coast, for we can without liln ' 011 aS + 'i 11 ' i' (a) above, recognise the frontiers of Qatar as ends 11Um ^' a 0 ' la t-as-Salvva, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al-Qaral 1 ^ ' as thought preferable to make no concession in respect of 1099 v T'i , a t0 ar S t, e that informal discussions such as those of ofI neve !' been confirmed in writing or been the subject Ooven^intf^lTv, 11 '' r bindill g effect, and that His Majesty's the fict tint \■ P1 ! ^nd on the bine line.

As it appears to be largely inhospitable desert under Ikhwan control, save for the coastal strip of^the Barr-al-Qarah, the likelihood that oil companies will actively interest themselves in it is probably small, if they do, on the principle that Ibn Saud has no interest east of the blue line, it might be necessary to consider whether to attribute it to Qatar or Abu Dhabi (the wording of the 1913 Convention, as quoted in paragraph 5 above, would assist us in claiming it for Qatar). It would in any event be desirable, in order to prevent foreign interests from endeavouring to establish a foothold in it, to consider in what way it could best be made clear that we regarded it as falling within our own sphere of influence or that of one of our Trucial allies. ' When once oil operations have started in Qatar, to convey a warning (if and when circumstances should make this appear advisable) through the Sheikh of Qatar to the migratory Bedouin tribes who use the area referred to in (d) that in the event of their crossing, with hostile intent or save for normal peaceful pursuits, such as grazing, such line as may be fixed as the boundary of Qatar, they will do so at their own peril. The local political authorities would no doubt be able to ascertain and to advise what customary rights in respect of grazing, &amp;c. these migratory tribes at present eujoy within Qatar proper. On the question whether any corresponding intimation should be made to Ibn Saud in respect of tribes permanently belonging to Nejd but using the indeterminate area it seems definitely preferable, in the interest of dpi • avoiding discussion with him of the position of the indeterminate area and iife of the blue line, to make no communication unless and until circumstances make this quite inevitable. The question of any communication in respect of Nejdi tribes (if any) using Qatar territory could equally be postponed unless and until circumstances may make it necessary to consider it. erf iif India Office, J. G. Laithwaite. 26th January 1934. APPENDIX. Boundaries of Qatar. I—Extracts from Lorimer' s 'Gazetteer. (i) Qatar. (iV.B.—Mr. Lorimer's article on Qatar is stated to be the result of special enquiries made over a number of years locally.) Lorimer, Vol. II, page 1506, defines the boundaries of Qatar as follows :— ' On the east, north and west, Qatar is surrounded by the sea. The southern boundary is somewhat indeterminate. It begins at the foot of Dohat-as-Salwa on the western side of the promontory, and from that point runs south-eastwards to the wells of Sakak: thence, according to one account, it strikes east-north east to the north end of the Naqiyan sandhills, or, according to another, east by south to the southern end of the same hills on the north side of the entrance to Khor-al-'Odaid. As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has never clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the Al-Thani Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the two alternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognised Khor-al-'Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Thani Sheikhs assert a right to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three men stationed at Dohat-as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, can watch the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.'8 ,&lt;*1 (ii) Khor-al-Odaid. In Vol. 11, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes KJior -al -'OJald as 'an inlet creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end: it! about ISO miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary' Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.' (iii) 'Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes 'Aqal as 'a small littoral distrii at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odai on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance betwea which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on 1 average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in 'Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inlani li, 89. westward, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid.J ' On the landward side 'Aqal is e' by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and b on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically incS in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti- the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to beloiil in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' ^ (iv) Aim Dhabi. In Vol. II, page 405, under ''Aha Dhabi;' Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Upon coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance of ovd 200 miles. r i he Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended n &lt;l ^ r Dmm-al-Hul, neai Wakrah m Qatar, but his claim was not approved!) the Government of India ; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his Stet in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that hia jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of tkl in ft s ion Id perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the easl they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south they n3 presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali.' (v) Barr-al-Qavail.

India Office, P.Z. 614/34. Memo. B. 430. The Southern Boundary of Qatar and the Connected Problems. The question for settlement is that of the boundaries of the Sheikhdom of Qatar where it is not bounded by the sea. In the pre-war period the boundary to the south was to some extent indeterminate, but broadly speaking was regarded at the time of the compilation of Lorimer's Gazetteer in 1905-07 as running across the base of the Qatar Peninsula more or less south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point north of Khor-al-'Odeid. There is reason to believe that the Sheikh of Qatar still regards it as following approximately this line (see paragraph 8 below), but conditions have not been propitious for raising the question specifically with him, and the present note aims at reaching a provisional conclusion on the material available as to— (а) the southern boundary of Qatar ; (б) if the boundaries of Qatar on the south and west do not extend to the blue line agreed as the eastern frontier of Nejd in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913, the position of the interveuing area. The history of the question is as follows :— The Boundary on the South-East. 2. To the east, the boundary between Qatar and the adjoining Trucial Sheikhdom of Abu Dhabi has been the subject of frequent dispute in the past. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has claimed sovereignty over a stretch of Qatar territory running so far Lor. II, 405 north as the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, south of Wakra on the map attached.'^ The Sheikh of Qatar, for his part, has claimed sovereignty over areas in the Abu Dhabi Sheikhdom running as far east as the Sabakhat Matti. His Majesty's Government Lor. 11, 88- have consistently refused to recognise claims so exaggerated by either party, but they 8 ' ) - have repeatedly intimated that they regard the Khor-al-'Odeid, which lies about micl- way^Between trnT extreme points'referred to, as appe rtaining to Abu Dhabi. They have Lor. II, 89. also recognised the Abu Dhabi claim to the district of 'Aqal, geographical details of which are given in I (iii) of the Appendix to this note, and which contains both the Khor-al-'Odeid and the Khor-adh-Dhuw r aihin. We have thus a fixed point for the south-eastern boundary of Qatar. The Boundary on the South-West. 3. On the south-western extremity of the Qatar boundary there has been no corresponding dispute, nor is there a fixed point equally definitely established wdiich can with confidence be regarded as marking the w r estern limit of the territories of Qatar. The Position prior to the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913. 4. The southern boundary of Qatar was closely investigated locally between 1904 and 1907 by experienced political officers in connection w r ith the compilation of Mr. Lorimer's 'Persian Gulf Gazetteer.' The result of their investigation is given in the extract from the Gazetteer reproduced as item I (i) in the Appendix to this note. Broadly speaking, it went to show that the southern boundary of the State ran south-east from Dohat-as-Salwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-Odeid. Over the first section, running irom Dohat-as-Salwa to the Wells of Sakak, there was no dispute. The boundary between the Wells of Sakak and the sea on the eastern side of the Qatar Peninsula w-as, however, indeterminate. Two alternatives (the ditierence at its widest point being some 20 miles) were reported by Lorimer. For the reasons given by him (and substantially based on the historical considerations referred to in paragraph 2 above) he regarded the second alternative as preferable. The effect of its acceptance would be that the eastern sector of the southern Qatar boundary would run south-east from the Wells of Sakak to the sea north of the Khor-al-'Odeid. * Not reproduced. 2560 25 3.34 OOPY SENT TO / Revised to 5th March 1934.The Anglo-Turkish Convention of July 1913. 5.

Under that Convention, which, though reference is made toil in the ratified Anglo-Turkish Convention oi 9th March 1914, was never itself ratified, the eastern boundary of the Turkish Sanjaq of ^ojd was defined by a blue line oi the map running due south from the head of the bay opposite Zaqnuniyeh Island ii the Persian Gulf to the 20th parallel of latitude in the Central Arabian Desert. Tk text of the relevant article is given in section II of the Appendix attached to this Note, Its wording (' une ligne . . . separera le ISiedjd de la presqu lie d'El Katr. Ij limites du Nedjd sont indiquees par une ligne bleue . . . ') would justify tl contention that the blue line was at once the eastern frontier of Nejd and the westei frontier of Qatar. But there are definite objections to adopting this view. In tb first place, there is nothing to show that this was, in fact, the intention of i Majesty's Government at the time when the Convention was concluded, or that tliej had any object beyond limiting the eastern boundary of the Turkish possessions i this area. Secondly, there is no evidence of any claim to suzerainty by Qatar 2.99/34. to the west or so far to the south. Thirdly, the Resident's telegram of 11th Janus 1934, T. 19, emphasises the absence of control by the Sheikh of Qatar over the intern of his State (and a fortiori over regions so remote from Dohah as are now u consideration). Fourthly (though this by itself is probably not of serious importance) the position vis-a-vis Ibn Saud is to some extent compromised, as explained bek at any rate as regards the Barr-al-Qarah, by the line fixed by Sir Percy Cox in Fifthly, it is arguable that even in a formal document such as the 1913 Conventid, the fact that the blue line is spoken of separating Nejd from the Qatar Peninsuk need not be regarded as determining the boundary of Qatar. The Qatar Peninsuli was the closest prominent geographical feature and the nearest adjoining Arab political entity on the mainland, and a reference to it for descriptive purposes was not unnatural finally, there is much to be said for giving no avoidable extensions to the boundaria of Qatar, even if the consequence is that we have to deal with an area of indeterminate ownership between those boundaries and the blue line. 180/34. lire o.947S. th Dec. 464/ Line indicated in 1922 by Sir P.

The problems involved in this are discussed in greater ievrast 0 ^ detail in paragraphs 10 and following. If, however. His Majesty's ,g of Qatar sa^ Government are prepared to face them, the boundary in question has the ]\ 1 e]d, or merits that it is consistent with the obligations we have undertaken to • tbeblw^ 1 Abu Dhabi; it is equally consistent with the maintenance of the blue j iif line of the 1913 Convention as against Ibn Saud (or with such a modifi- 1 of 20th^ ce ' cation of that line as is referred to in paragraph 19 (c) (i) below ; and it l' -a girP.^ bas the advantage of definitely limiting the area of any commitments in w a liner^ respect of protection, &amp;c., into which His Majesty's Government may think 110 t IP it desirable to enter in the event of an oil concession being granted by the L f W ' Slieikh - ted4 Position of Area lying between Base of Qatar Peninsula and Blue Line of A nglo -Turkish Convention of 1913. 10. If, in these circumstances, it is accepted that the southern boundary of Qatar should be a line running via or to the north of bakak moie or less south-east from Dohat-as -Salwa or a point slightly to the north of Dohat-as-balwa to a point to the north of the Khor-al-'Odeid, the difficult question arises oi the position of the country lying between such a line and the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913, Importance of Maintaining the Blue Line. 11. On the one hand, it appears definitely important if possible to maintain tte blue line laid down in the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as against Ibn Saud or any other future ruler of this part of Arabia. W hile the 1913 ConventioD was never ratified, the blue line at any rate represents the agreement reached at tie time between Turkey and His Majesty's Government as to the limits of Turki authority in northern Arabia and on the Persian Gulf, and in dealing with Ibn Said as the successor in title to the Turks we can, it would seem, not unreasonably tale our stand on it. The difficulties of finding any satisfactory substitute are patent The undesirability of giving Ibn Saud, in the absence of any definite eastern boundarj to his territories, an excuse for territorial expansion (as distinct from the exercise, as at present, of an informal influence and the receipt from our Arab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore) in the hinterland of the Trucial Coast and of Muscat is equally clear. Such expansion would clearlj - involve a risk either of his coming into conflict with the local rulers, whose treat} if relations with His Majesty's Government he has formally recognised, or of la :-if establishing an influence in the Sheikhdoms in question so powerful as to 'oe embarrassing from our point of view. k [Seforei isti) 2S fiiale a lisktk fitoiilei iidii, s on lis Itonc Disadvantages of Maintenance of the Blue Line while fixing Southern Boundaet of Qatar at the Base of the Qatar Peninsula. 12. At the same time, important on general grounds, for the reasons given, as the maintenance of the blue line appears to be, the fact must be faced that in tie present case, if we continue to regard it as the eastern boundary of Ibn Saud's territorr, and if, as suggested, we accept a southern boundary lor Qatar running roughly across the base of the Qatar Peninsula, a not inconsiderable area lying between the two f, States, and peopled by migratory Bedouin tribes, will be left in an indeterminate political position. 1 here is a possibility that the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, who lias in the past exercised a wide influence, and made tribal alliances of his own, in tie Trucial hinterland—c/. Sir P. Cox's letter No. 176 of 28th June 1904—might prefer some claim to such an area. But, though on this point further information will ^ sought fiom the Resident, there seems little evidence of any active interest on tl part of A.hu Dhahi in any area to the west of 'Aqal. Assuming that no such clai exists, or could be substantiated, the alternatives are to recognise the areai )elongmg to Ibn Saud ; to recognise it as belonging to the Sheikh of Qatar; or regard it as a political no-man's land. 1 • + 'i ^ e ^ 0 S 1 ^ lse d it as belonging to Ihn Sand we could, if necessary, call upon nm o veep ledouin raids into Qatar from it under control. But such recognition wou d not merely be inconsistent with the maintenance of the blue line of the ID® ./onven ion, o t e a bandonment of which, as stated above, the objections appear to ^ b long, ut m ou repiesent a formal acceptance of Saudi sovereignty to the borders &lt;,r Qatar and Abu Dhabi which might well prove embarrassing. . ^ If .' 011 11:16 other hand, it is attributed to the Sheikh of Qatar, we should be justified m expecting the full co-operation of the Sheikh in dealing with Bedoum activities withm its limits But such an attribution would not merely give to#; expend the lim^t^TnT 1 no ^ 111 tlle P ast appear to have claimed, but wo«H tlth the ot3 of an ^ 1 liablllt y for Protection which we may undertake in connecHoB Ju rate ^LLT ? ^ be necessary to claim the area M fn it or of an TntP f ip) ^ Qatar lf ther e were serious signs of foreign interej i i an intention on the part of Ibn Saud to occupy it But pending Eirsssn- rs yr* our - 1 — te tec; Welj kh ii esite rdsli tjktt iitlc of 1 I fro % pn ^etr Wn .^oteiiei ^\\ *oi: ,15. The decision to regard it as a political no-man s land would, so far as can be judged, be likely to mean little more than the acceptance of the de facto position to-day. As will be seen from paragraphs 16 to 18 below, the area, save for the Barr -al-Qarah district, is largely desert, peopled by nomadic tribes yielding uncertain allegiance to Ibn Saud, and it appears to differ little in general conditions from the Rub -al-Khali further south. Admittedly the absence of a limitrophe ruler who could be made responsible for the activities of his subjects, may make it more difficult to secure the southern border of Qatar against nomadic Bedouins. But the difficulties involved may be less than they appear. r l he difficulties of any alternative to regarding the tract as of indeterminate ownership are great, and at any rate as a provisional policy there would appear to be much to be said for treating this area as indeterminate in ownership and avoiding, if possible, raising the thorny questions of its boundaries to the west and of political control within it with Ibn Saud, shot , e xt# Nature and Political Conditions of the Indeterminate Area. 16. Before reaching a conclusion it may be well to place on record such® scanty information as is available about the nature and the political conditions of the indeterminate area. Apart from the coastal district known as the Barr-al-Qarah, which is further discussed in paragraph 18 below, the bulk of it appears to belong to the Jafurah desert, which Lorimer describes as an area ' possessing only a few wells of very bitter water, a little scanty grazing, with a surface of red and burning sand,' in which living conditions are extremely difficult and which is frequented to any considerable extent' only by 'the hardy A1 Morrah, and even they avoid entering it unless in winter or in search of a refuge from more powerful enemies' (cf. Appendix, section I (vi)). Since the date of Lorimer's Gazetteer, Mr. Bertram Thomas, on his recent crossing of the Rub-al-Khali, has passed through this area from south to north, travelling from the well of Banaiyan near Latitude 23° 11' 40 // via Haluwain, Nakhala, and the western extremity of a salt lake lying immediately west of the Khor-al-'Odeid, across the pre-war Qatar frontier to Dohah. His account is of importance because it makes it clear that such local control as is exercised is exercised solely by nomad Bedouin tribes (and principally the A1 Murra, who are a tribe dwelling in the sands, whose influence extends well down into the Rub-al-Khali). Secondly, even though he travelled with a ' rabia,' or guarantor, from the A1 Murra tribe, the journey was rendered extremely dangerous by the risk of an attack on the party by Ikhwan fanatics, who roam apparently at large, over the whole area. Thirdly, the sites of Salwa, Iskak (? —Sakak) and Mabak, the first two of which lie on, and the third slightly south of, the pre-war boundary of Qatar, were at the time of his journey in the hands of the Ikhwan, with the result that he could not visit them. 17. On the question of political conditions Mr. Thomas throughout his journey (the route of which lay well to the east of the blue line of the Anglo-Turkish Convention) from the centre of the Rub-al-Khali northwards to the Persian Gulf refers to the established influence of Ibn Saud and its beneficent results, and remarks: ' To-day peace, the peace of Bin Saud, prevails throughout the sands. The influence of the Ruler of Central Arabia, wielded through his able Viceroy at Hofuf, Ibn Jiluwi, compels peace between all these old enemies, not through direct control, for there is and can be none, but through the immense personal prestige of Abdul Aziz himself. A belief in his strength and star has swept across the sands. Not love, but awe, serves this wise providence that so directs affairs. . . . Thus, the sand tribes proper are in some degree leagued with Bin Saud. They pay to him a nominal tribute and by that act are ensured mutual protection one from the^ other. In theory the tribute is an annual levy of one dollar on each camel. In practice, the Rashid have no money, and in any event they escape proper payment by reason^ of their remoteness. They do, however, send a camel from year to year as occasion offers in token of submission. When, however, rains fall in the northern sands and they migrate thither, the tax-gatherers' demands must be met, and a few camels are sold for^the purpose. Light as is the bond, the tribes grumble at it. . . . They all swear that the existing peace shall last only as long as the present regime of Riyadh, Let Riyadh or Hofuf be thought to have lost its power, and raiding will be resumed immediately, and blood will flow again. ...' Mr. Thomas's remarks may be compared with those of Mr. Philby (who in 1932 travelled through the Barr-al-Qarah area and thence south-west to the Jabrin oasis) reproduced in section III of the Appendix to this Note. 2560 A 2 Lor.

The importance of this district for the present purpose is first that itGinbraces. the coastal strip lying between the blue line and the ore-war western extremity of Qatar, and secondly that it appears to correspond fairly closely, if not exactly, with, the triangle of land lying to the east of the blue line, which falls within the area left to the west of the rough line indicted to Ibn Saud and Major Holmes by Sir P. Cox in 11)22 (see paragraph 6 above). Mr. Philby, with the assistance of recommendations and guides furnished by Ibn Jiluwi, the Saudi Governor of Hasa, travelled througli a portion of it in 1932. The impression left by his ' Empty Quarter' is that tlie dominant political influence at the present day are the Saudi Government and the Ikhwan. Details of the Barr-al-Qarah district are given in the extract from Lorimer reproduced as item I (v) in the Appendix to this Note. As will be seen, Lorimer considered that it ' might perhaps be reckoned as included in the Sanjaq of Hasa'- in other words, in the pre-war Ottoman Sandjaq of Nejd. On this assumptioii the boundaries of Nejd in the 1913 Convention might well have been fixed so as to include it, with the result that the limits of ISejd would have touched the pre-war limits oi Qatar on the coastline at the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, the hinterland (actually the Jafurah Desert) being left in indeterminate ownership. For whatever reason (and it must be assumed that substantial justification was produced to persuade the Turks to relinquish their position in the Barr-al-Qarah) the line was in fact fixed farther to the west. But the history of the Barr-al-Qarah, and the fact that the- 1913 Convention had never been ratified, may well have been the reasons which led Sir P. Cox in 1922 to fix the limits of Hasa at a point which included in it the Barr-al-Qarah rather than at the blue line of the 1913 Convention. ■^'Conclusions. 19. In the light of the examination of the position given above, and subject to the observations of the Government of India and the Political Resident, the best course would appear to be the following :— (a) Boundaries of Qatar. —To agree that the boundaries of Qatar shall be accepted as being on the north, east and west, the sea; on the south, a line runninf across the base of the Peninsula from a point not south of the latitude of the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay to a point not south of the north side of the Khor-al-Odeid inlet, ihe line indicated on the I.P.O. map would satisfy these criteria, and if it is confirmed that it is the line at present claimed by the Sheikh of Qatar it could be accepted. A slight modification to bring^ the line some 12 miles south to the head of Dohat-as-Salwa Bay, and so to reduce the area of sea coast in indeterminate ownership, could be considered if necessary. (h) The blue line of the 1913 Convention, to be maintained as against Ibn Saud, ^or the reasons given in paragraph 11 above, as the eastern boundary of baudi Arabia. (c) If a claim is advanced by Ibn Saud to the Barr-al-Qarah on the ground of the line indicated by Sir Percy Cox in the Oqair conversations in 1922* referred to m paragraph 6, that His Majesty's Government should either- Cu concede the claim, on the ground, if necessary, that they regarded lenibe \es as committed by the informal conversations of 1922, but wimout prejudice to the maintenance in principle of the blue line, and in rm Ui n ,, Pi 1 ' a . * orma JRecognition by Ibn Saud of the validity of this line. le a n ution to Ibn Saud of the Barr-al-Qarah area, undesirable as it • 1 ? , Je 0 . n 0 101 g^onnds, would have the advantage of leaving no gap of H n ifflp i e if lina ternt0ry 1 bordering on the sea coast, for we can without bpcrinnin' ^ a ^ ove . recognise the frontiers of Qatar as ends Dohat-as-Salwa, i.e. at the point at which the Barr-al -Qarah hlnl r pieferable to make no concession in respect of 199? i 0n t0 ai ^ uethat informal discussions such as those of of formal n cU Deve | ^ een confirmed in writing or been the subject Governmlntln 6 iT •' f 0 billdin S' eff ect, and that His Majesty's the fact that tl 0 V stanc ! 011 ' &gt; ' lie ^ ne - Play might be made with Saud of a sub ' r 6 ! dr ™T by Sir Perc &gt; T Cox ^ fact, deprive ^ Side of the blue line yl ' g tWeen ^'''-e'i-Duklian and the western • cp. on this point paragraph 5 o( the Note reprodnced as Appendix'lV to this Memorandum.(fS) / : that it (ti) The area lying between the blue line and the boundaries recognised for Qatar tem ext^' aS a ^ ove to regarded, subject to confirmation by the Resident that not e ^ 110 c ^ a ^ rn ^ em ^ made or could be substantiated west of Aqal by Abu thin Dhabi, as of indeterminate ownership.

As the territory of the Trucial Sheikh of Abu Dhabi has riever III clearly been asserted to extend beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, and as the Al-Thani .Sheikhs of Qatar undoubtedly claim the Naqiyan tract, the latter of the twoalternative lines is to be preferred ; the British Government have recognise^ Khor-al-'Odaid as belonging to Abu Dhabi and the boundary consequently cannot be placed nearer to Trucial Oman, though the Al-Tham Sheikhs assert a riglii to the whole coast as far as the Sabakhat Matti. It is said that three meii stationed at Dohat -as-Salwa, Sakak and Niqa-al-Maharah, respectively, canwatcli the whole southern border of Qatar from sea to sea.' (ii) Khor-al- Odaid. In Vol. II, on page 1367, Mr. Lorimer describes Khor-al-'Odaid as ' an inlet or creek on the coast of the Abu Dhabi principality as its extreme western end: it lies about 180 miles almost due west from the town of Abu Dhabi. The boundary of Qatar is either at, or a short distance to the north of, the inlet.' (iii) \Aqal. In Vol. II, pages 88-89, Mr. Lorimer describes 'Aqal as u a small littoral at the base of the Qatar peninsula upon the east side ; it is bounded by Khor-al-Odaia on the north-west and by Dohat-an-Nakharlah on the south-east, the distance between which in a direct line is nearly 35 miles. Inland the depth of the district is on ai average about 20 miles.' [N.B.—Nathil (Saudah) in 'Aqal is 20 to 25 miles inland II, 89. westward, from the foot of Khor-al-'Odaid.] ' On the landward side 'Aqal is enclosed by Mijan on the east, the Jafurah desert on the south and south-west, and by Qatar on the north-west. . . . The Bedouins do not regard 'Aqal as geographically included in Oman, which in their view is terminated on the west by the Sabakhat Matti; but the district has been recognised by the British Government as forming part of tb territories of the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi, and must therefore be considered to belong, in the political sense, to Trucial Oman.' (iv) Ahu Dhahi. In Vol. II, page 405, under 'Ahu Dhahi,^ Mr. Lorimer remarks: 'Upon the coast Abu Dhabi reaches from ... to Khor-al-'Odaid on the west—a distance ofow 200 miles. The Sheikh of Abu Dhabi in 1895 claimed that his frontier extended the Bay of Umm-al-Hul, near Wakrah in Qatar, but his claim was not approved tj the Government of India ; Bishairiyah has also been named as the limit of his State in this direction, but no good reason has been adduced for supposing that Ills jurisdiction ever extended beyond Khor-al-'Odaid, though the northern shore of thai inlet should perhaps be reckoned as included with the inlet itself in his territories, Inland the frontiers of Abu Dhabi are not defined. It is asserted that on the east they reach to the Baraimi oasis, but without taking it in, and on the south theyi presumably be placed at the margin of the Ruba'-al-Khali.' (v) Barr-al-Qarah.

Sir Percy Cox said that he had kept no private notes as to what passed at M. meeting with Ibn Saud on the occasion in question. Anything he had reported or recorded on the subject would have been left on record at Baghdad; but to the- best of his recollection and belief the facts and circumstances were as follows:- 3. The specific object with which, accompanied by Iraq representatives, k went to meet Ibn Saud at Ojair was to induce him to ratify the Mohammerah Agreement of 5th May 1922. Sir Percy proceeded to the rendezvous without any knowledge that he would there meet i\lcijOL Holmes oi would have occasion to express any opinion as to the boundaries of the Qatar leninsula; but learning from JVTajor FJohnes, and from the map that he pioduced, that lie w&amp;j endeavouring to obtain from Ibn Saud a concession for exploiting oil m an arej which included the Qatar Peninsula, he (Sir Percy Cox) naturally informed Major Holmes—and no doubt Ibn Saud also—that this could not be. If he had then been asked, as he doubtless must have been, what he considered should be excluded, as constituting Qatar, Sir Percy would undoubtedly have based his answer on his own knowledge, as Resident in the Persian Gulf for many years, namely, that, on the east coast, Qatar's boundary with the Sheikh of Abu Dhabi's territory was the head of the Khor-al-'Odaid, and on the west coast the head of Salwa Bay. This, in Sir Percy's recollection, was the position recognised in the Bushire Residency and adopted by Lorimer in the Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Sir Percy probably had the Gazetteer with him, but on the above point he would hardly W needed to consult it. In any case he is positive that the Anglo-Turkish Blue Line of 1913 was never mentioned, and is of opinion that any view which he expressed incidentally and ex tempore could not reasonably be regarded as the official pronouncement of the Hasa-Qatar boundary contemplated in our first treaty with Ibn Saud (December 1915) in which it figured as one of those to be ' hereafter determined.' Moreover, Sir Percy Cox states that he informed both Ibn Saud Major Holmes that His Majesty's Government ought to be consulted before concession was granted. and 4. Sir Percy said that in these circumstances it seemed to him that His Government were entirely free, in so far as the conversations of 1922 were concerned, to maintain against Ibn Saud the Blue Line of the unratified Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1913 as the eastern boundary of Nejd. 5. Sir Percy said he was not aware whether either Ibn Saud or the Shaikh Qatar had ever advanced a definite claim to the ownership of the Barr-al-' coastal tract, between Zakhnuniyeh and Salwa, but it seemed to him that if occasion arose in the future for a compromise it would be a reasonable course to assign.. Ibn Saud, in view of his strong position at Ojair close by, that length of coast lin| with its hinterland, up to the Blue Line. This would have the advantage of leaving no indeterminate area along the sea-coast. J. G.L. India Office, 27th February 1934.53/ r -' » AIE Adastral House, Kings way, &lt;•0.2. 28th February, 1934, My dear Laithwaite, As arranged in our telephone conversations, I write in regard to the air facilities which are essential at . 0 atar if it is to be possible for the E.A.F, to carry out their part in implementing a guarantee of protection to the sheikho You will remember that we agreed in the Kiddle East Official Committee that it was not necessary to complicate the draft telegram itself which we prepared for Cabinet approval with the details of these facilities and that we considered it sufficient for our purposes in this telegram merely to refer to them briefly and generally and deal with the details separately After considering again the papers already sent to the Eesident, Persian Gulf, demi-officially, including our demi official letter of the 29th January, S,32797, I feel that our original view that Fowle already had full details is not, in fact, quite substantiated, especially in regard to the vitally important point of intelligence and I feel that in order to fulfil our intention to give him all necessary details of facilities required, it is necessary to send him a further telegram amplifying the brief reference in paragraph 3 of the draft wir^, detailing the facilities required, and making quite clear that the grant of these facilities by the Sheikh is an essential condition of our giving an undertaking of protection« 'fhese points are, of course, quite well understood over here by us who have taken oart in the deliberations, but I am not sure j. * that, as the papers sent to Fowle stand, our intentions would be/ aithwaite, Esq., ndia Office, s.wa.be equally clear to him. I should, therefore, be most grateful if you would consider the terms of a telegram to be sent to him, and it should, I suggest, be sent concurrently with the draft telegram, I attach a suggested draft for you to think over • — t ■'&amp; —JLO-£- —y-cxu- —t-o— -tri-mc —o-v-^r» As you know, we attach the highest importance to these facilities, especially that of an intelligence officer, without which we could not taice our part in implementing any guarantee. The defence methods which we have to use make it necessary to secure the earliest warning of impending major raids and this requires an intelligence officer in close touch with the tribes and free to move among them and with Y/ireless communications, uuch officers have always been maintained wherever these methods of defence have been used, in Iraq, Trans Jordan, Aden and elsewhere. I feel that the wire should also stress to the Resident that the agreement of H.U .GL has been given only on the condition that these facilities are obtained. These points were emphasised by the Ohiefs of Staff (see,, for instance, paragraphs 8 and 9 of their report G.I.D. Paper 1129-B and conclusion (e;.) There is a danger that in our anxiety not to complicate the draft wire which the Cabinet would have to consider, we may overlook the necessity for making quite clear to Fowle that the facilities are an essential condition and I am quite sure that unless we send him a telegram on these lines, we should not be certain of ensuring that the terms recommended by the Chiefs of Btaff, upon which the Cabinet agreed to approve the acceptance of this commitment, are complied with. I am sending copies of this letter to Eendel at the Foreign Office and Beal at the Admiralty. lours sincerely, (Bgd). Hi chard Peck.■**- —i-'■■rf—gR.-,. MMK de.lPT T^L:JGR;: . In amplification of paragraph 3 of my immediately preceding telegram (the draft wire submitted to Cabinet), particulars of the facilities required by the R.A.F. to enable them to implement guarantee are as follows. Two landing grounds, storage facilities, e.g. petrol dump, bomb store, moorings; freedom to use v /T and permission for R.A.F. intelligence officer to reside in Q ,atar if necessary and in any event to have freed cm f or himself o r hi s as si st ant s to move about the country. The grant of protection to the Sheikh would be conditional upon his consent to these facilit .b ove amplifies D. 0. letter sent you under reference (the Air Ministry D.O. letter of 29/1 to Mr.Laithwaite under reference S.32797. ) I assume serious difficulty need not be anticipated in event of guarantee of protection being given, but would be glad of your views on important question of relation of intelligence officer if appointed to Resident with a view to agreement on this point with Air Ministry.No. 406/209/2 o HIS Majesty's Minister at J edda presents his compliments to rp he Hon'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. and has the honour to transmit to him the under-mentioned documents.

Latest correspondence seems to indicate that policy decided on by His Majesty's Government will have t» be made kn.wn t« Bin Saud .r Hilljctne t» his knowledge much earlier than was anticipated in January. I see no help for this but I feel bound to emphasise following points. 2. I cannot foresee reaction of Bin Saud but His Majesty's Government must be prepared for p.ssibility at least .f c»ntr»versy of great magnitude especially as it will be difficult t* insist en Blae line in the dlrectian ®f Qatar withnut asserting principle that his territory as a wh.le is bounded by Blue and Violet lines. 3. Bin Saud will not regard issue as Juridical though he willfcoubtleBS argue it partly on that basis, e.g. he may take line that Artie Treaty of December 26th 1915 treats with extent of h eastern territories as being still undefined and as depending on ancestral rights no&gt; on any successorship to Turks. 4. Bin Saud will attach more impoi political and possible economic aspects of pioblem. Insistence/i n m 3 m» Insistence 011 Anglt-Turkish beundary combined with pr«- ptsed tightening tf contrtl erer Kuwait will appear in his eyes as a manifestation ©f a new and unfriendly British ptlicy containing him tnlthe east and south- east as|in his view His Majesty's Government have contained him on the north by Hashimite states. 5, Use of expression 'Qatar sphere of influence* will seem to him fk hypocritical in connection with an area in which the Shaikh has never exercised * 1 andin which his has been preponderant for several years. He would better understand a declaration that the whole area beyond Blue and oJ- Violet lines constituted a British sphere^ influence in which it was for His Majesty's Government to determine boundary of local rubers. This I take to be impossible but I should much prefer Ji His Mgj esty's Government add words 'in full sovereignty* after word *appert?in* in paragraph (c) of India Office telegram No. 739 and abandon phrase about sphere of influence. 6. These observations except last are not intended to deprecate propose* policy but to indicate importance of its probable repercussions. - RYAN.CONFIDENTIAL. ' ' ' &lt;g -y &gt; N o .

Addressed to Foreign Office No. 8 Saving Repeated to Bushire and Govt, of India. Your despatch No. 39 and Mr. C.Earner 1 s letter of February 1. I lack various papers but submit the following observations for what they are worth. Ibn Saud is always loath tojaccept theory that he is a successor to the Turks whom he would regard as usurpers not entitled to alienate his ancestral rights. He might for present political reasons accept blue line but only I think if states under what amounts to British protection came up to it on the other side. I do not consider that any distinction can be made between Saudi Government and Ikhwan who were Ibn Saud's creation. Ibn Saud almost certainly regards Murra tribe as his subjects; see my despatch No. 32 of 27/2/32. I believe that he has sent two punitive expeditions against them in last three years. He has also created Ikhwan settlements in their country including those at Sikak and Anbak mentioned in Philb^s Empty Quarter page 50. Three Murra settlements one of which was apparently Sikak were represented at Ikhwan conference at Riyadh in 1928. Rihani mentions others which I cannot place. I agree that it would be preferable not to raise question unnecessarily with Ibn Saud but if he learns that we have defined frontier of Qatar as suggested he will probably /assume - i I • ■ ! 1 I i; i 1 1 Iassume that we recognise his sovereignty up to the other side of it. If we regard space between it and 'blue line surely as a no man 1 s land/we shall leave Ibn Saud free to do what he likes there with all the disadvantages stated in paragraph 11 of India Office paper but without being able to attribute to him any responsibility ,e. g, , for raids by Murra in Qatar. I do not mean to suggest that His Majesty's (Tovdrnment should encourage Saudi expansion but rather that boundaries of Qatar should be left undefined until time comes to assert 'blue line principle. Could formula be devised which would limit practical responsibility of His Majesty's Government to actual peninsula of Qatar without informing tribes which would be tantamount to informing Ibn Saud that they did not regard anything beyond as subject to the authority of the Sheykh? This if feasible would leave question of boundary open and perhaps eventually make it possible to propose arrangement to regard country between peninsula and blue line as a quasi-independent buffer area as has been suggested in the case of Najran.II / I / J_ » ' a -( O I o ^04 19 3 4 ( lAtT) I S Ovi'lC- t SoU^ 16th Miroh, 1954o Sir, Ulth reference to In^la Offio© letter HOo i „ ?.o 614/M of the 7th March P ^nd to previous correspondence regarding boimdaries In Fas tern \ral}la 9 I am directed 'bp Secretary Bir John Glmon to tranesi t to fou the accompanying copgr of a dec-patch from Blfc Majerty's 4m &gt; bas-rador in Turkey reporting a requeet snade l)^r the iKiited stater Mnfeaesy at \ngora for a eop^ of the vnglo^imrkfrh Oonyention of the $9%h July, 191^ together ^ith the draft oT th© reply which^ to tha ccmcur^ence of Secretary Sir raimel Hoare^ Sir John Simon proposes to return to Fir Percy Lomine &amp; ?&lt;?

On certain of the points he raises you may he In a position to throw further light after your visits to Qatar and your interviews with the sheikh, and we should welcome a report on -tern generally and shall de much interested in any comments on or information about them which you may in due course he able to let us have. As regards the payment of zakat to Ibn 3aud, the information as to any payment dy the Sheikh of Qatar is summarised hy Hyan. There have, I think, at various times in the past been casual references to the collection of zakat dy representatives of Ihn Saud so east as the Bareimi Oasis (compare, for instance, the/ on'We Lt. Col. T.G.W. Ptiwle, C.B.i£., Die Residency, Bushire. e&lt;yf*i i '~' K ' / A&gt;. v.cjTt.y /&amp;'&amp;&lt;■ ^3/ the statement^^in HTiTby 1 s 'Ruto 1 al Khali' quoted in paragraph 17 and Appendix III of the India Office memorandum on Qatar). Ibn Baud has of course recognised under Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda trie ''special treaty relations with H.B.M^s (^61^):^^ of 'the territories of Kuwait and Bahrain, and. ..the Shaikhs of Q^tar and the Oman Coast'. Quite apart from this, we have never regarded, I think, these payments of zakat, which, in so far as they may have been made, we have ignored, as payments of a formal tribute, or as evidence oy the persons hy whom the payment was made of the recognition of Ihn Saud a£ their feudal over-lord? We should, however, 'be grateful if you would at your convenience let us have a report on the extent to which any payments are known to he made, their nature, and on the general question of what, if any, degree oi political suhordination is regarded as implied in them oy the 4ral) rulers concerned, in respect of Qatar, the Trucial Coast and the Oman peninsula.- 3 - 3. Hie question of obtaining fuller and more detailed information from the Gulf about the affairs of Q^tar and the Trucial Sheikhdoms, and, In particular, the relations of these sheikhdoms with Bin Saud, has been raised by various departments here and is, indeed, closely connected with the points raised in lean's letter.

Nevertheless, on ray imperfect information ahout the past, I saw considerahle danger in the No i.an 1 s Land proposal. I therefore gave my y /Views for what they are worth in a Saving ram No. 8 of February 18. l:y economical intentions have he en partly defeated by a mistake in the Legation. We overlooked the fact that the Savingram was in a cypher not held 'by Bushire. As Fowle aoes not yet seem to have Reported I am telegraphing to him only the essence of the Saving ram and am sending copies of the condensed version to you and the Government of India. I received further papers hy the hag which arrived on February 25, viz. your P.Ls. Nos.51(782/81/91), ^(E.759/81/91) and 53(S.854/189/91), all of February 8. enclosures in these despatches confirm me in the view that v/e should be at least as careful in regard to direct r eIations between Ibn 3aud and the Sheykh of Qatar as we ^ave become in regard to direct relations between Ibn Saud the Sheykh of Kuwait. fenier, Esq., Office.- 2 - I agree witti the India Office tiiat Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda is a formidable harrier to the absorption of ^atar by Ibn 3aud^ I arn not equally confident that it would help us to prevent an arrangement between them defining a common boundary, even though it disregarded the Dlue line. I have difficulty in believing - though this is outside my province - that the Sheykh would regard any boundary of his dominions otherwise than as a boundary between him and Ibn Saucu I am worried over the more general question of Ibn Baud's relations with the Trucial Jaeykhs. In his /-memorandum of January 26, paragraph 11, Laithwaite refers incidentally to the 'exercise (by Ibn 8aud) as at present of an informal influence and the receipt from our iirab clients of payments which we do not recognise and the existence of which we ignore.' Ought we not perhaps to watch more closely the informal influence, which has become so patent in the case of the 3heykh of ^atar since his visit last year to Riyadh? Ought we not to keep a more definite record of observable contacts, e .g., the visls of members of 'the ruling families to Mecca ana, if possible, to Ibn Jiluwi in Hasa? Ought we to ignore quite s® readily money payments, which, if regular, can only appear in Arab eyes as tribute to an over-lord? I do not call to mind off hand any payment except those made by the Sheykh of Qatar. If there are others, it would ' 0 e useful to know of them. Even as regards the Sheykh of Qatar the information seems to be sketchy. In 1930 prior reported very confidentially (See the enclosures in your - (E.4861/4861/91) of September 12, 1930} that the Jieykh admitted to paying a secret subsidy of Rupees 100,000 a year to/- 3 - to Ibn Sauti. He v/as then anxious about the future of his independence snci 116 se6nis 'to I18.V6 sot) t»ji8 wind up ci^'ciin in 1932, when he asked for a guarantee ot British protection against landward aggression. I have not got the papers regarding this request and the answer to it, so I do not know whether he renewed his intimation that, 'If I cannot be helped, I shall have to seek some other way.' I do not recall any further mention of the suosidy as such out in 1933 attention was drawn several times to a financial transaction involving a sum of 10,000 rupees or pounds. AH the versions in 1953 represented this as money owed hy Ibn Saud to the Sheykh. Now we have well-informed Holmes -coming along (enclosure in your P.L.No.53) and saying that the Sheykh is well off out has to pay sums estimated at £10,000 a year to Ton daua and that the reason for his being summoned to Riyadh was that he had neglected the payment for two years. I suggest for consideration the following questions:- (a) Has the 3heikh of % atar been for some time before 1930 a tributary of Ibn Saud? (h) Was his journey to Riyadh the result of his seeking •the other way 11 , which he foreshadowed in 1930, and which have appeared to him all the more necessary after the refusal of British protection in 1932, if he was in arrear with his tribute? (c) Is it not at least possible that, when at Riyadh, ^he Sheykh agreed to some territorial settlement with Ibn S^ud, even though it is hard to believe that he csn have gone so far as suggested in the report in Fowled Express Letter, No. 1957S of December 22? (d) Are any of the other Trucial Sheykhs in similar r elations to Ibn Saua, as might be inferred from the P a ssage quoted above from Laithwaite's memorandum? (Yours ever), .ANDREW RYAN.li.

My dear Gilbert, I have been looking into the question of the Qatar boundaries which is dealt with in your memorandum B 430, the latest revise of which I received a few days ago. Since the Foreign Office concurred in the terms of that memorandum there have, as you know, been various developments , and we have also gone into the legal aspects of the question with our legal advisers more fully than was possible when the matter was first considered. As a result of this reconsideration of the matter, and also of the arguments advanced in Ryan's telegrams Hos. 8 Saving of February 14th, and 30 of March 5th (with which I may say we entirely agree), I think our present views would be as follows. 2. Perhaps the most important point which has emerged frcm our discussion with our Legal Advisers is that, in view of the fact that the 1913 line is 'adopted' and unmistakeably defined, in Article 3 of the 1914 Convention, which was duly ratified, that line is from the point of view of international law perfectly valid, so that we should be on strong legal ground in maintaining that it still marks the boundaries between Saudi Arabia, as one of the Ottonan succession States, and the territories in south-eastern Arabia with which Majesty's Government are in special treaty relations. You will see that we have developed this point in Paragraph. 3 of our draft despatch to Angora enclosed in : ndia Office' our/our official letter No. E 1206/1206/91 of to-day's date to you. 3. A second point which has emerged is that Iwinmi. iuppiffiri—P the 1914 Convention speaks of the blue line as separating the Turkish territory from the 'territory' of Qatar, and not merely, as in the case of the 1913 Convention, from the 'peninsula' of C c atar. We are now of opinion that this further strengthens our case for contending that the negotiators of the Convention intended to regard the territories to the east of the •'blue line' as politically appertaining to the Sheikhdom of Qatar and not merely as geographically attached to the Qatar peninsula. This point seems to me important because, as I have said above, I personally entirely share Ryan's view that there will be little or no hope of getting Ibn Saud to accept a frontier, so to speak, against a vacuum, and that, if we are to maintain the 'blue line' as a real and valid boundary, it will be essential to take up some positive attitude about the political status of the territory to the east of it. 4. In this connexion it is perhaps relevant to note that Article 6 of the Treaty of Jedda does not merely commit Ibn Saud to maintaining peaceful relations with the Sheikhs of Qatar and the Qnan coast, but also constitutes a clear recognition by him of the special treaty relations of His Majesty's Government with those Sheikhs - a recognition which seems to me to preclude Ibn Saud frcm himself acquiring or claiming any kind of overlordship or suzerainty over those Sheikhs or over any v, - territory which we can reasonably claim to fall within their sphere. It seems to me in fact that Article 6 of the Treaty/Treaty ol Je. aa read in conjunction with the terms of Article 3 of the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1914 gives as an even stronger case than we have hitherto imagined for refusing to admit that Ibn Saud possesses or has ever possessed any lights to the east of the 'blue lin« H . 5. In the light of the legal opinion referred to above, and of the considerations advanced in Ryan's telegrams, we now therefore definitely incline to the view that the balance of advantage is against maintaining an indeterminate area, or 'no man f s land', ana in favour of our taking our stand at once on the 'blue line' not only as the eastern boundary of Saudi Arabia but also as the dividing line between that king^dom and the territories of south-eastern Arabia coming within our sphere. We are confirmed in this view by the request of the United States Embassy at Angora for copies of the 1913 ana 1914 Conventions, and by other signs of increasing .American interest in this area, e.g. the recently proposed visit of the United States minister at Bagdad iio Riyadh, and the various indications of an acti/e interest in oil possibilities on the part oi the standard Oil of California, 6. But if on further consideration it is now decided to abandon any attempt to maintain an indeterminate area, that does not mean that we should necessarily favour any extension of any oil concession granted in respect of Qatar or of any guarantee of protection given by His Majesty's Government to the oheik of Qatar beyond a line running south of a line drawn across the base of the peninsula. Indeed, you will remember that 'this question was considered in connexion vvi uh the of/4. of protection which was drawn up at the Middle East Official Sub-Committee meeting of February 23rd, and that v/e then agreed that the question of the landward limit of the prop sed Qatar oil concession and of the proposed guarantee of protection to the Sheikh shouldbe dealt with independently of the question of the political boundaries of the Sheikhdomt 7. Villile for all these reasons our present attitude is that we should maintain the 'blue line' against Ibn Saud and leave him in no further doubt as to our claim to regard the area to the •ast of it as falling within our sphere, it would of course be for consideration whether it may not be desirable eventually to offer him some concession in this area, particularly if it turns out that tribes to the east of the 'blue line' do in fact owe him definite allegiance. This possibility is considered in conclusion (c)(i) of your memorandum, but I think that it is now clear that if we are eventually to establish any modified line, we shall first have to establish our rights up to the 'blue line', since otherwise we shall have nothing to give away or bargain with. In this connexion it is perhaps worth noting thcxt, according to Dixon r s latest report, oi which you sent us a copy in your letter P. Z *ll r 7 ?/34, ol Vth March, the Bay of Salwa appears to extend further to the south than is s.iown on our 1:1,000,000 maps. This seems to be borne out by Philby's (1:2,000,000) 1932 map, published in the Geographical Journal of January 1933, wheie the Bahr a Salwa is shown in d etail as extending southwards to a latitude hardly north of that oi the Khor -al-Odaid. may thus be that, when the area is properly surveyed, it will be found that a strict interpretation of th . line'/5. line' would cut off a very long and very narrow strip of coast to the west of Salwa Bay from the rest of Hasa, and that alar more satisfactory and reasonable line could be drawn from the southern end of the Bahr-as-Salwa in a southerly direction, which would in fact start from much the same point as a line drawn across the base of the Peninsula. This would much reduce the extent of the uncertain area and might offer the possibility of various eventual compromises for the northern end of the line, which we could perhaps discuss at Tuesday's meeting. Incidentally it may 'be worth considering having the Bahr- as-Salwa re-surveyed, so that we may know exactly where it does in fact end. But this is perhaps mainly a point for the Service departments. 8. In the circumstances described above our present attitude therefore is that we should, not only firmly make our stand on the 'blue line' at the outset, 'but that we V should put forward a positive claim, preferably on behalf of the Sheikh of Qatar, to the territory extending right up tot he northern portion of it. If this seems likely to lead to serious difficulty,we could eventually compromise by agreeing to some line running south irom the head of Salwa Bay. Meanwhile, the view of my higher authorities here is that everything points to our having to mane a very early communication about these frontiers, not only to the Americans,as proposed in our letter 1 No.E* 1206/1206/91 referred to above, but also to Ibn Saud himseli, ii vve ai e ■ \0 to avoid a great dea^ of trouble later on. 9.

In view of the importance to British interests of retaining the speci -il ic ^ition -of His aj esty* s Govern ent in the^e region®, the Council ^re in agreement' with the proposal that an assurance of protection in suitable terms should be given to the Sheich, subject to certain safeguards and to the provision of the facilities necessary to implement it. They regard it as of great importance thet any such assurance should not tontain an undertaking to do more than could in fact be done with the resources available. 3. In the view of the Council, the contingencies against which protection might actually be required may ^ e summed up as follows;~ (i) Formal attack by Ibn Saud, or by some other Power; wfth €&amp;e object of captunng the country. .&gt; jkO ■III irflfMdt irttyOMnawajiitAit.U (ii) Large 8eale trjlaj. 1 nTafton frcm l ejct, either osteneibiy unauthorised by Ton baud, 01 0 .ci as might occur if Saudi Arabia should disintegrate after the death of Ibn Saud.

Hearn Anglo-Persian Oil Company. jpf3( 4 y Gommer ci al Agre eme nt , V It was agreed that a clause should be inserted in Art. 14 of the Commercial Agreement on tne lines of Art. 11 A(c) of the Koweit Agreement providing for termination of the concession by the Sheikh if the Company should be in default under the Arbitration provisions of Art.16. Relations between A.P.O.C.. Royal Dutch Shel l and Iraq Petroleum Company . Mr.Rendel put forward a suggestion which had been previously made by him on behalf of the Foreign Office, namely that if the formal Agreements with the Sheikh and uith H.M.G. were made in the name of the A.r.O.C. only and if, when these were put before the Board of the I»P.C., the I.P.C., objected to their terms, they might claim that the A .P.O .C. had exceeded its powers and that the/2. the Agreerneats were ultra vires under the I.P.G.Oil e©i—ciit, oil uiie ooiiex ris.ncl i £ the R-oystl X)utch SheXl were brought in now as a party to the Agreements, the I.i-.C. could not legitimately object to Agreements made by two of its constituents or to the concession being worked by the A.P.C.C. and the Royal Dutch Shell. Mr.Agnew explained that even two. constituent groups of the I.P.O. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Bed Line without the approval of the I.P.G, Board which, in this case, the a. P.O.G , had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I.P.O. at group meetings. It had been left to the A .P.O.C. to get a concession in this area and the A .P .O.G.exploration licence in Qatar was held on behalf of the I .P .G. The A.P.C.G# had been afraid that if none of the other constituents of the I.P.O. agreed to come in they might be left with a concession on their hands which, under the terms of the Oil Agreement, they would be unable to work themselves without the participation of some other constituent grouiD. The Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A.P.O.C. in working any concession that might be obtained and trie French group had said that anything which proved acceptable to the A.P.O.G. and the Royal Dutch Shell would be acceptable to them, M r. Agnew thought, therefore, that the formation of a Shell A.P.0.0. group would be tactically undesirable at this stage since it would appear to the other constituents of the I,P.O. as a sort of all-British front. In view of this explanation the meeting agreed that in spite of the rather informal nature of the present arrangements between the A.P.O.G. and the I.P.O. it wottLd be preferable on the whole that the Agreements should be made in the name of the A.P.C.G. only. The desirability/ 1 1 - 1 i j &lt; 13 desiraMlity of informing the Sheikh that the A.P.O.G. were acting on behalf of the I.P.O. vms also discussed. It vjas agreed that the Sheikh could have no formal ground of complaint in this respect in view of Art. 12 of the Commercial Agreement and Sir Louis Kershaw V — -UL iU . -r -TF - T,. suggested tnat tue position might suitably 'be explained to him informally by Col. Fowle at a later stage. It was not anticipated that there would be any difficulty with the Sheikh on this point. The meeting then turned to consider the terms of the draft Government Agreement. Article 1 was acceptable to the Companies. Nationality of subsidiary Companies . Article 3. Mr. Agnew saw great difficulty in the provision that subsidiary Companies should be registered in Great Britain since this would involve a liability for U.K. taxation. Under the constitution of the I.P.C. its subsidiaries might be of any nationality. He did not t hi ilk that the French and American groups would mind subsidiary Companies being registered in Great Britain except for the fact that this would involve them in double taxation to which they very naturally objected. The Shell and the A .P.O.C. cared nothing themselves for this point since they were in any case liable to U.K.taxation. Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that this tax liability might be an additional reason for the foreign elements in the I.P.C. not wanting to participate in the concession, but Mr. Agnew said that the jealousies within the Board of the I .P.C. were such that there was no prospect of the two British group s/'3 groups 'being allowed to take up any concession vyitnout the others participating. Tiiey might complain vigorously about its terms but they would, come in nevertheless, Mr. Starling and Mr. Seal suggested that this might be a reason for insisting on U.E. registration in spite of the taxation difficulties and Mr. Hendel explained that since any conditions imposed in the Government Agreement must be of universal application, H.M.G. could not make them easier for the A.P.O.C. - I •P.O. than for example a purely American Company. Mr. Hearn and Mr. Agnevu said that if H.M.G. made things difficult for foreigners in British territory, British Oil Companies would be faced with retaliation 'nam, ■ in foreign territory and referred to their present negotiations with the Syrian Government, but Mr.Hendel pointed out that there was no analogy between the mandated territory of Syria and Qatar which was not British territory and where there were special difficulties in regard to protection of foreigners. It was finally agreed, however, that in view of the taxation difficulty, the registration of subsidiary Companies in the United Kingdom might be dispensed with but that any subsidiary should be registered in the British Empire and that its chairman should at all times be a British subject. Articles 3,4,5,and 6 of the draft Agreement were acceptable to the Oil Companies. Mr.Walton explained with reference to Article 4 that it was possiDle that H.M.G. might decide to designate the Political Agent, Bahrein as Political Agent also in Qatar and Article 4 as drafted would cover this though in so far as tne P.A. might/5. might not 'be resident in Qatr the obligation to conduct local relations through the Political Representative of H.M.G. would in practice have to be interpreted rather more loosely. Mr. Agnew and Mr. Hearn took note of this and saw no objection. It was agreed that words to the following effect should be added to the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Qatar Commercial Agreement IT and in times of national emergency the Sheikh shall have full use free of charge of the Company^ wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes,' and that a new Article 7 identical with Article 7 of the K owe it Govcriiment Agreement should be incorporated in the Qatar Government Agreement. Articles 7 and 8 were acceptable to the Companies. Hefining . Article 9 . Mr.Agnew said that in view of the international character of the I.P.C. the Government Agreement would soon became known all over the world and if any refining clause were included in it foreigners would impose it on British Oil Companies in foreign countries. It was true that a clause such as that in the Koweit Agreement would not involve the Company in any definite obligation vis-a-vis H. m .G., but South American Republics would use a similar clause as a means for getting at the Companys bank balance. Oil Companies always preferred to refine at the point of production if possible so that a refining clause on the lines of the Koweit Agreement could not mean much to the Government but it would mean a great d^al to/6 • to the Company and might have diastrous results on British interests elsewhere. He thought that H.M.G T s real safeguard lay in the existence of the British groups in the I • P • G• Sir Louis Kershavj enouired whether the same difficulties were not to be feared from the c 1 ause in th e Z ovj eit Agree.uent, but Mr . Hearn hoped that since only two Companies were interested in this the clause would not become widely known. Mr. Starling said that H.M.G. were at present negotiating with various foreign countries and trying to get them to agree that they should impose no conditions on British Oil Companies which were not imposed on other Oil Companies. Having in mind these negotiations he felt inclined to agree generally with what Mr.Agnew had said. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty were somewhat perturbed at the very snail number of refineries in British territory in view of the difficulties which might arise in time of war in obtaining oil for the Havy from neutral countries. The Admiralty particularly desired that there should oe more refineries in British territory in Asia. He said that it was a well established British policy to ensure if possible that oil should be refined in British territory and he suggested, and Mr* Starling agreed that this policy was well known abroad. Sir Louis Kershaw also doubted whether the omission of a refining clause from the present agreement would really make it much easier for British Companies vis-a-vis, for example, South American Republics who might produce earlier documents which contained conditions regarding refining. There was, for example, the/7, the standing exajrrple of Trinidad where not less than 50yd of uiie oil nad to be refined looal3.y, ifir «Af&lt;ne¥, 1 . novjever, tij-Oix^ho tnat a niodern Agreement rnade in Iiondon might have great weight, and he mentioned that British Companies were coming up against this difficulty more and more in their relations with foreign countries. They would rather give H.M.G. their safeguard in some other way than in a formal public document. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty felt that in Qatar they might go rather further in insisting on their refining desiderata than in Koweit though, if course, they would not press the Company beyond reason . Mr. Agnew suggested as a possible solution that the I.P.O. might be asked to give H.M.G. a letter saying that the Company would be prepared at all times to discuss with H.M.G# the question of refining and that H.M.G. would have the right as soon as production in Qatar amounted to a modern refining unit to ask the Company to erect a refinery. He explained that this would mean the erection of a refinery when production reached say 2,COO tons a day or 700,000 tons a year. They would expect H.M .G. to treat them reasonably in regard to this obligation if it proved impossible to find a market for the oil» At all costs he wished to avoid the appearance of a refining clause ii/a formal Agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw asked whether this letter would be obtained before the Government Agreement was signed. Mr, Agnew said he thought it would be best that the letter should be sent say a month after the signature of the Government Agreement but that a guarantee might be obtained before signature of the Agreement that such a letter would be forthcoming. He/1 He could not of course commit the I.P.O. to this proposal at the present meeting and Mr. Seal added that neither could he commit the Admiralty, 'but it was agreed that the proposal should be considered further by the Admiralty and oy the Companies and that the Companies should prepare a draft of a letter such as had been mentioned. Mr, Agnew said that in the event of this proposal being accepted by both parties he would put it informally to the American and French representatives of' the I.P.C, in London without however prejudicing in his conversations with them the terms of the Government Agreement • , : : ^ it !i ! .■ t 'CONFIDENTIAL.

The bhaiiiii swore thai he had made no arrangement over the oil with Jbm Sa^ud ana the roliticai itesiueuu acceptea nis statement. In the course of discussion the question ot what the Siiaikh considered his boundary came up. He gave the line which was on the Anglo-Persian Oil Company T s map, but explained that m the past an area from just north of Khor al Odaid to the Sabakbah al Matti had been neutral ground between him and ibu Dhabi, but that it was now claimed by Bin Sa ! ud. Tne area ana boundary were indicated on a rough sJietch map. The Political Resident then again went through tne position and said that as things now stood the Shaikh coula not give a concession to the Hasa Company ana asked what woula happen it, as the Shaikh suggestea, he gave it to no one - woula not nis 7 family and people resent the throwing away ol good money. It was also explained that the Anglo -Persian Oil Company liere was not merely the T Abadan Company, out representea a mixed Company, witn American,French and Dutch interests,as well as British. It was emphasised that the Hasa Company was purely American and that,therefore,His Majesty's Government would not assent to the Shaikh giving them the Concession. Some discussion then ensued as to whether a bridge coald not be made between what the Shaikh as^eu lor and what the Company offered. In the course of the conversation it was made clear tnat His Majesty's Government would not allow the concession to be given to the Hasa Company and would, in consequence, ciu best to secure as good terms as possiole lor him irom the Anglo Persian Oil Company. r j -i-i 4--iH ■f-hot Hi qcussion should be re—opened It was finally suggestea that ciscu^iu next morning, but the Shaikh saia that he wished tor time to /thin^£ \ ty ..Js think) so that it was arranged for the Political Resident ana the Political Agent to come oft' m the afternoon. It is worth nothing that an impression which one gets very strongly is that it tooii an appreciable time, and only the written letter convinced them, for the Shaikh and his party to realise that His Majesty's G-overnment might 'be in earnest and not merely speaking ''words'. fi g ii 'MOn the 4th April iy34r at lb.00 hours the Political Resident and the Political Agent saw the Shaikh, his sons, T Ali and Hamad, and Salih al Mana f at the Qasr. The Political Resident askea the ShaiJm whether ne haa any reply to the letter which had been hanaea to him. The Shaikh produced a written reply which was read out to Salih al Mana f and handed to the Political Resident. Some discussion took place wiiicii was led round to whether it was possible to find a bnage between the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and the Shaikh. In particular he was asked whether he had re ^uested the Company to pay him an higher royalty instead of a lump sum and a royalty. He said that he had not aone so. The Political Agent said that it appeared tnat his demands were higher than those made m the case of the Bahrain Concession,to wmch the Shaikh re^lieo that he did not know about tnat. He said that he thought W-t tne money would not come out of the pockets of the Company, but tnat their profits would be so large that they coulo. easily afford to pay him five lakhs a year in addition to tne roy^ltieo. It appeared,however, that it was impossible to fapeeeed persuaae him that there was any necessity to lower Ms terms and. it was not, ot course, possible to do anything which might commit the Compa y to increase theirs, though the Political Resiaent so.ia tnat would do what was possible to see tnat he receives gooa terms, should ne give the Concession to the iaiglo-Persian Oil Company. It was also emphasised that if he aid not give it to tne ^ 0 Persian Oil Company he would not give it to anyone and then Qatar would loose all the benefits from oil ana tne political Hesident asked what would his relatives think H he looses O oo ra0Iley - the Tne conversation then turned on to /bounaanes o ^a ar. The Shaikh reiterated that his boundary as on th A o Persian Oil Company's map. He saia that there was a neutral zone between him and Abu Dhabi from Khor al Odaid to tne /Sabak^ahSabaidiah al Matti 7/Jiich was neutral, but that of recent years Bin Sa^ud had ciaimea it as his own ana coiiected zai^at there. Bin Sa f ud had also collected zaicat m the desert from Hasa to the east and there were small Akhwan settlements at Sabak and at Mabak. The former being only two or three houses and the latter a settlement (though the size was not ascertained In speaking of the collection of zai£at,the Shaiith empnasised that Bin Sa f ud collected it 'as he is strong enough to do this'. The Shaikh emphasised at various points his fear ol danger irom Bin Sa T ud and tribes now unaer Bin Sa ! ud 1 s influence. The conversation reverted m very general terms to tne question ol tne concession and the Political Resident wound up by saying that tne door was if masdud ff but not 'maqful'. It was then explained to the Shaiidi that we should go away m tne Ship tnat evening ana that perhaps either the Political Resident or the Political Agent might return later on or that he could write to us il ne naa anytmng to say. /)Telegram xx From Political Resident at -Bahrain* o s secretary of State for India, i-«ondon.

On the other hand while this issue may in any event have to he faced before long His Majesty's Government are reluctant to risk unnecessarily provoking a major dispute with Bin Saud particularly when he is already in difficulties with Imam of Yemen. Moreover if as a result of such challenge to his position, Bin Saud while outwardly maintaining friendly relations, were to endeavour to stir up desert tribes against Shaikhs of Qatar or (less probably) Abu Dhabi the resulting situation eight be difficult since His Majesty's Government while under no formal obligation to defend them by land might have to consider lending them assistance. Pending completion of necessary organisation in Qatar (which muu- await general agreement with Shaikh about oil concession and proposed guarantees of protection) this would be moo; difficult. There is also danger that Bin oaaa when faced with possibility of having to accept Blue Lme^ might intrigue to strengthen his informal influence m Qatar or Itucial Shaikhdoms. Possioility must a not be overlooked that Bin Saud might react to challenge by intensifying his impenetration of hinterland o ratax and Trucial Shaikhdoms e.g. by creation ox .art. « Akhwan settlements or by asservng his ouprema y deecxt tribes; although we might be in a stronger position diplomatically in regard to .nis i- we - • -p 'hiq eastern ooimdary ciea. previously made our view of hi^ to him as suggested in par a « •vi p from here to estimte importance 5.

This would be done by merely informing him of U.S. Embassy*s reouest for copies of Anglo-Turkish Conventions of 1913 and 1914 and of our reply. Diplomatic discussions could then be allowed to take their course and question could if necessary be considered of what concessions could be made to Bin Saud., (c) to make a formal communication to Bin Saud on the subject of the '.blue Line^' wnich he could not ignore and which he would probably regard as a challenge and feel bound to take up,. 3. None of the above courses is free from difficulty but 1 incline to course (b) as offering best oppoitunity of making necessary communication to Bin Saud in least contentious manner. Please telegraph youc observations as to relative advantages and disadvantages of courses (a) and (b). If course (b) were adopted 3 course (c) (which in any case seems open to seriou objection) would presumably be unnecessary* 9. As regards para. 5 of your telegram No. 40 I agree that it would be best to describe area east of Blue line as 1: ailing within 'British sphere of influence' bui- in view of termi gy of Article 3 of 1914 Convention and of fact that His Mc.jesty Government do not claim actual suzerainty ov^ ^ thi seems desirable to add words 'appertain(ingj -o tar^ eoli y_-jy.i) 854. to describing area as failing under ''full suzerainty^ of Qatar is that it is uncertain whether Shaikh himself wouxd cj_aiLi such suzerainty and eiiibarrassmg situation oulo. aii &amp;o -i-f bna.LAji sij. oli I ci -taxi to come up to scratch or should represent to Bin Saud that he was beina; ocligeci cy His Majesty's GoYermaent against his will to put forward same.

My dear Gilbert, You will rnue-iber my tellln.; y.u tMa morning that I was u little uneasy on one point in connexion with the queatlon of uhe v v ata.r 'boundaries; i #e • lest we should liaTt; our position witn Xbn Saud in re .•••card to the blue line oy our failure to , ; ;ive him copias of the An,;lo Turkish Convent ions ol' 1913 and 1914 establishing; that line, when| in he as-^ed us (see Sir U• Clayton 1 8 report ol June bth 19^?, ox vcnich v/e sent you a copy in our letter Mo^585/119/ 91 ox July 7 l^E?) x'or 'copies of all existing treaties and a t ;ree .Uients between Uis .. ajosty 1 s Government and the vaiious rulers and ohieie in . rabia and on the Persian Gulf'. ^ it had occurred to lae that Xbn Saud mi^ht well contend that hie object in asking us Tor thuse documents was in order to know exactly how he stood with regard bo our claims and position generally in Arabia, and that the fact that we did not co iiuiuxu cate to hiia the treaty instruments laying down the olue line left nia free to ignore that line if he wished to# lie could probably argue that he had no knowledge of the Anjlo '.Curaish Conventio.is or at any rate of the ratification of the laU Convention, and that as nobody appeared to have established any effective claim to the hinterland of 4atar to the east of the blue line, he was perfectly free in the absence of any warning to the contrary from us or from the Sheikh of ..atar to establish Akhwan Colonies there and generally bring this area under his authority if he wished to do so. X have now referred the point to Malkin and am gl^d to say that he does not taice this risk vei-y seriously, ^is view, when Ibn Saud asked for 'copies £t all existing treaties/ SSQ..,6 v&gt;) treaties and agreements 'between Uia i.^ajest;/ 1 s aover.i .ent and the various rulers and chiefs In Arabia and on the Persian Gulf', lie cannot have been intending to ask for treaties between til a Ma J e sty 1 s u o ve rx^ae nt and tii© Ottoman iiapire# But ilai-irin tninii'B that we should be protected by a still further consideration# Xbn Gaud's object in asking lor the se treaties was presumably to ascertain what were the relations oet .veen tnese rulers and ourselves and not to ascertain what were the boundaries between their territories and the former Ottoman Empire since these would not nave been laid down in treaties between iiis Majesty ? s Government and the rulers in question. Ualkin thinks in .fact that the terms jf Ibn Sand's request would have been inconsistent v/i th any i as a that he was asiclng for information as to tae boundaries between the former Ottoman Empire and the territories of the Arab rulers; so that the short answer to any question as to why we did not oonaminioats the two Anglo Turkish Conventions to hiro. would be simply that ha had not asked for them* In any case, of course, the non communication of these treaties to Ibn Saud cannot affect the question of the legal validity of the blue line, in these c ircums t ano# s it seems clear that my misgivings were unfounded, but it may jperhaps be convenient to put the point on record in case it should be raised again.

Helations between A .T .O.C. , HoyaX Batch Saell tuia Ir aq Petroleum Comoany . Mr. Bend el explained a suggestion v/hich nad oeen previously made by him namely that if tne i orima ii oi ^^ments with the Sheikh and with H.H.G, were made in the name ox the A.P.O.C. only and if, when these vreie ,yut before Board of the i .P.C., the I.r.C. objected to ineir they might claim that the A.P.O.C. had exceeded its powers and/r and that the Agreements were ultra vires under the I.P.C, Oil Agreement; on the other hand if the Hoyel Dutch Shell viere brought in no?/ as a party to the Agreements, the I .P.C. oould not:,, legitimately object to Agreements made by two of its constituents or to the concession being worked by the a ..P .0, C . and the Hoyal Dutch Shell if the I.P.C. decided not to take up the concession. Mr, Agnew explained that even two constituent groups of the I.P.C. were not allowed to negotiate for a concession within the Red Line without the approval of the I .l .C. Board wniCii, in chis c■ ^^^, ^ne &amp; p.Q.C. had already obtained, the question having been discussed informally with the I .i .C. at group meetings. It had been left to the A.P.O.C. to get a concession in this area and the A.P.O.C. exploration licence in Q£tar was held on behalf of the I.P.C. The A.P.O.C. had been afraid that if none of the other constitaenus of i-ho agreed to come in they might be left with a concession on their hands which, under the terms ei une Oil Agiocme^t, they would be unable to woife themselves without the participation of some other constituent group. Royal Dutch Shell had accordingly agreed to participate with the A .P .O.C. in working any concession tndt ..agh* be obtained and the French group had said that anything which . _ ^ onr t the Royal Dutch Shell proved acceptable to ^nc • ■ Tr a thought, therel ore, would be acceptable to them. —-— a -p n n rroup would be that the formation of a Shell i&gt;-.^ • • , .... th ic.

It vuas agreed that the Sheikh could have no formal ground of complaint in this respect in view of ^rt.12 of the Commercial Agreement and Sir Louis Kershaw suggested that the position might suitably be explained to him informally by Col. Fowle at a later stage. It vms not anticipated that there would be any difficulty vjith the Sheikh on this point. ■The meeting then turned to consider the terms of the draft Government Agreement. Article 1 was acceptable to the Companies. Nationality of subsidiary Companies . Article 2. Mr. Agnew saw great difficulty in the provision that subsidiary Companies should b« registered in Great Britain since this would involve a liaoiliuy for U.K. taxation. Under the constitution of the I.P.O. its subsidiaries might be of any nationality. He did not think that the French and American groups would mind subsidiary Companies being registered in Great Britain except for the fact that this would invoke them in double taxation to which they very naturally objected. The Shell and the A .P.O.C. oared nothing themselves for this point since they were m any case liable to U.K. taxation. SiilLouisJC^^ suggested that this tax liability might be an additional reaoon for the foreign elements in the I.P.C. not vjanc ing to participate in the concession, but s ^ id that the jealousies within the Board of the I-P.C. v.ere such that there was no prospect 01 the two Brioi gr cup s/4: • groups 'being allowed to take up any concession without the others participating. They might complain vigorously about its terms 'but they would come in nevertheless. Mr . Starling and Mr. Seal suggested that this might be a reason for insisting on U.K. registration in spite of the taxation difficulties and Mr , Hendel explained that since any conditions inrposed in the Government Agreement must be of universal application, H.M.G. could not make them easier for the A.P.O.C. - I.P.O. than for example a purely American Company. j.:i. Mr. Agnew said that if H.M.G. made things difficult for foreigners in British territory, British Oil Companies would he faced with retaliation in foreign territory and referred to their present negotiations with the Syrian Government, cut Mr. Tiendel pointed out that there was no analogy between the mandated territory of Syria and the independent Sheikhdom of writai v .hich not British territory and where there were special difficulUe in regard to protection oi ioreiyi~rs. It &lt;'a^ agreed, however, that in view of the tax.... -ion diff \r the registration of subsidiary Companies in the United Kingdom might be dispensed with but that any subsidiary should be registered in the British ^m^ire „nd its chairman should at all times be a British subject. Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the draft Agreement were , Tfly ton explained acceptable to the Oil Companies. - a -i-Vit it was possible that with reference to Article _ L ■&lt;:&gt; the Political Agent, H.M.G, might decide to debign^ ^ • a o -f-i r and Article 4; Bahrein as Political Agent also . a _ -far as the P.A as drafted would cover this uhou^n might/o. might not be resident in Qatar the obligation to conduct local relations through the Political Bepresentative of H.M.G, Y^ould in practice have to be interpreted rather more loosely. Mr. Agnew and Mr. Hearn took note of this and saw no objection. It was agreed that words to the following effect should be added to the third paragraph of Article 6 of the Qatar Commercial Agreement:- 'and in times of national emergency the Sheikh shall have full use free of charge of the Company's wireless and telegraph installations and railways for governmental purposes,' and that a new Article 7 identical with Article 7 of the K owe it Government Agreement should be incorporated in the 'Qatar Government Agreement. Articles 7 and 8 were acceptable to the Companies. Refining . Article 9 . Mr. Agnew said that in view of uhe international character of the I.P.C. the Government Agreement would soon become known all ov^i uh.^ and if any refining clause were included in a-orei^nero would impose a corresponding clauoe on Bri oisSi Companies in foreign countries, I*- vv ' u ' ^ ru0 . 1 tt o t + Ap-reement w ould not clause such as that m the Ko^eit . b involve the Company in any definite obligation vio but South American Hepublios would usea similar p r-o+H- -i -n p* at the company 1 S bank clause as a means for ^eutm^ balance. Oil Companies always proiexxed, if refine at the point of production E o that a refining clause on the linos of the Ko.eit Agreement could not really give any tangible advantage to the Government, but it would mean a gre^t to/to the Company and might have diastrous results on British interests elsewhere. He 'ohought that H .M .G's real safeguard la^^ in the existence of the British groups in the I •P.O. Sir Louis Kershaw enquired whether the same difficulties vjere not to be feared from the clause in the Kovieit Agreement, but Mr . Hearn hoped that since only two Companies v^ere interested in this the clause would not become widely kno^n. Mr, Starling said that H.M .G. v.-ere at present negotiating vjith various foreign countries and trying to get them to agree that they should impose no conditions on British Oil Companies vmich vi/ere not imposed on other Oil Companies. Having in mind these negotiations he felt inclined to agree generally vath what Mr.Agnsw had said. Mr. Seal said tnat the iidmiialt^ vjer^ someahat perturbed at the very aaall nmnDer refineries in British territory in 'vievs o^. u-'-- difficulties villi on might arise in time of war in obtaining oil for the Navy from nentxaX ooun^ri^s. S' ® Adiairalty parti oulsrly desired that there should oe more refineries in British territory in Asia. He said that it vrns a well established British policy to ensure if possible that oil should oe refined in British territory and he suggested, and Mr. Starling agreed that this policy was well Imown abioad. Sir Louis Kershaw also doubted whether the omission of a refining clause from the present agreement would really make it much easier for British Gompann -s vis -a-vis, for exaunple. South American Republics who might produce earlier documents which contained „. • n There was, for example, conditions regarding refining• the/' J the standing example of Trinidad where not less than 50^ of the oil had to be refined locally. Mr, Agne?/ , hov /ever, thought that a modern Agreement made in London might have great^ight, and he mentioned that British Companies were coming up against this difficulty more and more in their relations with foreign countries. They would rather give H.H.G. their safeguard in some other way than in a foimal public document. Mr. Seal said that the Admiralty felt that in Qatar they might go rather further in insisting on their refining desiderata than in K owe it though, of course, they would not press the Company beyond reason, Mr. Agne w suggested as a Dossible solution that the I,P»C« might be asked u0 give H.M.G. a letter saying that the Company would be prepared at all times to discuss with the question of refining and that H.M.G. would have the right as soon as production in Q-atar reached an amount sufficient 1,-0 justify a modern refining unit to ash uiie Go^v^,; u0 erect a refinery. He explained thai bnis .jould m..u.n erection of a refinery when production leacli^d ^ tons a day or 700,000 tons a year. 'ihe^y woul- ^..poc E.M.G. to treat them reasonably in regard to this obi i gat ion if it proved imp 0 s s i d 1 e b 0 x i nd mc. 1L e 0 for the oil. At all costs he wished to avoid uhe appearance of a refining clause in a fomal Agreement. Sir Louis Kershaw asked -whether this letter ^ould be t. a r r-.-Ppn«nt was signed, obtained before the Government Ame-w said he thought it would be best that the letter should he sent say a month after the sien^fcuio of , + th'&gt;t 0 marantee might oe obcained Government Agreement but uhao o „ .U A- 'h f Q C I'l a 1G t t 61 before signature of the Agreemo^ vrould/ !

He could not of course commit the I.P.O. to tliis proposal at the present meeting and Mr♦ Seal added that neither could he commit the Admiralty, but it was agreed that the proposal should be consi dered f urther by the Admiralty and by the Companies and that the Companies should prepare a draft of a letter such as had been mentioned. Mr, Agnew said that in the event of this proposal being accepted by both parties he would put it informally to the American and French representatives of the I.P.O. in London without however prejudicing in his conversation with them the terms of the Government Agreement, i. • ■ 'lif H 1182/27 Telegram ^ 27 Jrom Political Agent, Bahrain.

This apparently means that he regards area west of Anglo-Persain Oil Company 's as Ibn Saud* s territory and is in our opinion additional arguement against formal communication to Ibn Saud contemplated in course (c) since we could not count on Shaikh's support in any conflict with Ibn Saud which such communication might provoke# 'e are unable therefore to support recommendations made in paragraphs 5 and 6 of Fowle*s telegram t/98.

I am increasingly disturbed at possibility of two separate conflicts with Ibn Saud over Kuwait and area east cf Blue Line. See paragraph 4 of my telegram No.40* Atmosphere may now be clouded by latest row induced by incident and no question can be considered without taking account of Saudi-Yemen situation which may be develop- -ing more rapidly than seemed likely three weeks ago. If Ibn Saud wins in conflict with Imam in which His Majesty*s Government has done nothing material to help him he will be encouraged to resist our claims in eastern Arabia# he may be all the readier to do so though this is conjecture as a result of establishment of direct contact with Arab leaders t taking part in mission of mediation now here. If he is worsted by Imam he will think his Majesty 's Government are taking advantage of his difficulties to embark on forward policy on eastern side of his dominions. I realise that policy in regard to question mentioned in first sentence cannot be altered.

I am more doubtful about land reconnaissance but see no strong objection if it can e confined to line well north of SIKAK, Any demonstration over Ildiwan settlement known to exist there might be legitimate but would certainly be regarded as provocation if it came to knowledge of Saudi Government.

Political Agency, Bail ram, the 12tJi April 1934, C VIywa hwU, In connection witli the Qatar boundary, the contents of paragrapn t)3 of my Diary Ko:6 of 1934 is interesting. For convenience, I reproduce it:- r, It was reportea on the 2Dtri March tiiat Alunaa Jamal ? a Persian residing in Qatar, had sold a quantity of rice t-o Bin Agadah and T Ali bin Hal'iad ol tiie Llanasir tribe over two years ago, but had received no payment. He complained to the Huler of Abu DhaM without success and later complained to Shaikh 'Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani of ^atar, who was also unable to maice these persons pay up. Shaiim T Abdullah is said to have ^iven Ahmad ^amal a letter to Shaiidi T Abdullah Din Jiluwi. Amir of Hasa, who promised to recover the money.' 2. The letter to Bin Jiluwi was probably one oi • those letters whicn are written to get rid ol an importunate seeicer alter justice) but the incident shows which way the wind blows. Sonourable Lieut-Colonel T.C .\i. Fowle,C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. 7z-&lt;r %o! y-f5 Cf ... ■From:- Political, BaJa rain. Tor- Resident, BusJaire No:G /420-10/3.IV datea tiie 21st April 1934. Enclosed is original and translation of a letter dated tiae S'/tii Dhul Hijjail 13b2 (the 12th April 1934) from Snaikh of ^atar (which I have ventured to open in case it was urgent). 2. Tone of letter is typical of Shaikhs communications and I doubt whether it betokens any immeaiate danger. At the same time, it does not commit him to any promise. 3. I have had no information from reporter in Qatar, but have Hardly had time to do so yet. 4. My personal view is that His Majesty's Government would be well advised:- (i) to tell Bin Sa'ud forthwith quite clearly how he stands about the boundary, and intorm ShaiMi ol Qatar that it nas been done, and (ii) to order immediate reconnaisance as suggested in paragraphs b and 5 ol your telegram i/98 April Sth. 5. This action would serve as a warning to the Americans as well as to Bin Sa 'ud, and should make it definitively clear to Snaiidi of ^atar that we mean business. I much iear that continued inaction will lose us our present advantage and opportunity. I am sending a translation of the Snaikn T s letter only by Printed Letter by air mail to London ana Simla.

Buler ot ^atar, to the Honourable Lieut-Colonel T.C.Fowle Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. After Compliments, v, I received your kind letter dated the 5th April (1934) equivalent to the 20th Dhul Hijjah 1352 and noted its contents. Regarding the arrangements to which Your Honour has referred, I have already explained to lour Honour in my letter dated the 19tJi Dhul Hijjah 1352 (the 4th April 1934) that there are no such arrangements as imagined by you and that by coming to such a conclusion, you have presumed things which are far from being true. In addition to this I inform you that what (relations) there are between me and His Majesty King Bin Sa T ud are old, friendly relations which existed from the time he and we came into being. This friendship in no way interferes with my independence or effects my affairs and authority, nor aoes it aiiect my relations with the High British G -overnment and you have no right to object to them (relations)* At the same time i am confident that I did not do anything which infringes the Treaty or effects its spirit and I consider that it is appropriate and necessary that my friendship with his Majesty King Bin Sa'ud should continue to be good. I very much appreciate the idea of protection and feel thankful the High British Government for the pains they ®re taki g, but would defer the question till matters arise, as regaras the right of survey and coacession to which you referred, I have explained my views to you in my letter dated the 19th lotEhul Hijjah 1352 (the 4th April 1934) that I will not do anything except what is within my right to do an' ' accordance with the rights and liberty enjoyed by the nati alsoI also invited Your Honour's attention to what has taken place m other places and of the attitude adopted by the High British u -overmnent at such places, to which fact I .'3^ hope you will give your kind consideration. Further, I - want to inform Your Honour that I would adhere to my right and would not ao what displeases the High British G-overnment unless it is within my right to do it, it being in accord ance with justice and equity, and I have no doubt that they (British Government) will give consideration to and respect the rights of their friends and allies.
