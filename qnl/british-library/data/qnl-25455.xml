T 3057) F0PET0N OFFICE, September 20th, is13* Dear Llewellyn Smith:- I asked Herr von Kuhlmann to-day whether he had yet heard what the authorities at Berlin thought of the set of Fecommendations agreed upon ad referendum at our recent meeting respecting the deepening of the Shatt-el-Arab below Basra. He said no; the document was no doubt being studied. He was prepared to hear criticisms, but continued to think it was a satisfactory document. He would probably ask eventually that it should be put into the shape of a “Mote Explicative' and attached in some form to the Anglo-German convention. I told him our Board of Trade would ask for a change of wording in the clause which recommended that the Coirniisslor, should as a first step aim a* a depth of twenty-four feet. The Board thought that if literally interpreted, this might hereafter be claimed by the German- Government as giving them the formal right,in case a depth of twenty-four feet could not be attained, to repudiate the authority of the Riverain Commission onon the ground that the reasonable demands of German shipping had not been met* Herr von Kuhlmann agreed rith me that this would he quite contrary to what had been the intention of the Feconnendations wtien drafted. He would be ready to consider any suitable modification of the wording, and would himself see whether he could suggest a satis factory formula. Yours &amp;c„.

[40626] /A; / y - L f‘XZ &gt; '•J 'I [1863 5—1] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. Herr yon KUEHLMANN called to-day and we discussed further the ’British counter-draft of the Anglo-German Convention respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters. He said he had received a copy from M. de Fleuriau of the agreement come to at Berlin between the French-and German groups; that he had appreciated M. de Fleuriau’s action in doing this ; and that it would afford him an opportunity for discussing with him the Aleppo- Meskene project, to see if it was not possible to reach a settlement -agreeable to Germany and to France.- He reminded me that Hakki Pasha had made a suggestion to the effect that the French might perhaps receive an assurance from the Ottoman Government that the concession in question would not be given to any concessionnaire who had not the support of the French Government, but that it should not be given at any rate until the Bagdad Railway had become a commercial success, say until a specified number of years had elapsed: I replied that under the existing system of kilometric guarantees it was very hard for the Bagdad Railway to become a commercial success ; but he reminded me that the system of guarantees was under discussion with a view to securing a modification. He said there was very strong feeling against the Aleppo-Meskene line in Berlin : it was felt that if it were worked in conjunction with the navigation concession on the Euphrates it might damage the Bagdad Railway. I said that this fear seemed exaggerated : the Aleppo-Meskene line would serve a different district to the Bagdad Railway, and one altogether to the south of that railway. It seemed to me that it would feed the French Syrian system without damaging the Bagdad line ; moreover, navigation up to Meskene would be very long in being brought about. It was in consequence of M. de Fleunau sjeom Copy to India 12 SEP 1913munication made to me oraUy on the 1st September It I spoke about this line: a written communi cation from M. de Fleuriau is promised this week on this and other points. _ i Herr von Kuehlmann then mentioned that h, had received a private letter from Herr von Jaegow to the effect that Germany must press for two-fit, s, instead of one-third as proposed, in the lurkis share of the new river navigation company. H Turkey does not object it is considered unneces sary that we should do so, as it is only a difference of about 3 per cent., and will in no way invalidate Lord Inchcape’s control over the whole. I read to him our draft, as prepared by Mr. Hurst and approved by Sir E. Grey, of article 6 of the convention. This is the article referring to the Shatt-el-Arab commission . he agreed that it would serve as a basis of discussion, and we are to go into the question more fully on the 4th September when he comes again. A copy of article 6 of the British counter- draft is annexed for facility of reference. I impressed upon him the great importance His Majesty’s Government attach to article 3 (6). A. P. September 2, 1913. I informed Herr von Kuehlmann of Sir E. Grey’s views as to an informal meeting of experts to discuss the reasonable requirements of mercantile shipping in regard to the Shatt-el-Arab, and he said he would telegraph to Berlin. I told him we suggested provisionally some time next week as the date for it to take place.Annex. British Counter-Draft. Article 6. THE Imperial German Government having taken note of the Anglo-Turkisli Convention of the 29th July, 1913, under which the free navigation of the Shatt-el- Arab is assured to the shipping of all nations and a commission is established for the execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of its channel and for its maintenance and for other like purposes set out therein, and being of opinion that the provisions of the convention are conducive to the best interests of inter national commerce, will, so long as the duties imposed upon the commission by the said convention are satisfactorily carried out, uphold the convention, and will undertake that German subjects and German shipping shall comply therewith, and with all regulations issued by the commission, and .... shall duly discharge all dues, fines, or other pecuniary obligations properly imposed upon them. If at any time the Imperial German Government are of opinion that the duties imposed upon the commission are not satisfactorily carried out, or that the reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river in matters within the competence of the commission are not adequately met, and if the commission has not seen its way to give effect to important recommendations laid before it in the interests of German shipping, His. Majesty’s Government will use their good offices with the Imperial Turkish Government to ensure the reference to a commission of enquiry, appointed in accord ance with article of the Convention of 1907 for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes, of the questions whether in any particular respects the duties of the commis sion have not been satisfactorily carried out, and whether there is good ground lor thinking that the commission, if maintained, will not be able to provide loi tie reasonable requirements of the commerce of the river.Memorandum. HIS Majesty’s Government Lave examined with dose attention the counter-draft, communicated by the German Ambassador on the 16th July, 1913, of the proposed Anglo-German convention respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters ; they have also considered the various memoranda which accompanied this document, and the detailed explanations which His Highness w r as good enough to furnish in a private note of the same date. Sir E. Grey now has the honour to submit a revised counter-draft, printed, for the sake of convenience, with the German counter-draft in parallel columns, and to deal with the several points which, have been raised by referring, where necessary, seriatim to the articles of the British counter-draft. Article 1, Clause (a).—The German Govern ment suggest that the words “ under the express condition that this should not cause any prejudice of a financial or economical nature ” might be omitted. His Majesty’s Government consider, however, that without such words the clause might be interpreted as committing them, uncon ditionally and indefinitely, to liability not to oppose any increases of the Turkish customs duties which might be proposed, or any alloca tions of specific revenues which might be claimed, if such increases or allocations were ever deemed desirable, either to provide further guarantees for, or in any other interest of, the Bagdad Railway Company. Article 1, Clause (&amp;).—His Majesty’s Govern ment note that the German Government would prefer the drafting of this clause to be m a positive rather than a negative form, though such a modification would not materially alter the nature of the obligation concurred. His [1077—6] B3 counter-draft; but His Majesty’s Government would, as the German Charge d’Affaires has already been informed, value an assurance (which might either be added to this clause, or given by an exchange of notes should the German Government deem such a course to be preferable) that there shall be effective publica tion of all rates and conditions on the Bagdad Railway and of all intended charges therein, and that the notice to be given of such changes shall not be less than two months in the case of both increases and decreases. Article 2, Clause (c), corresponds to the German counter-draft. His Majesty’s Government have carefully considered the statement of Prince Lichnowsky that the German Government would attach importance to receiving a note confirming that, in the event of the construction of the Basra (Zobeir) Gulf branch, His Majesty’s Government would take steps in order that the Bagdad Railway Company should be represented on the Board of the Company to be formed for the construction and working of the said line in the same manner as British capital will be represented on the Board of the Bagdad Railway Company. It appears, however, to His Majesty’s Govern ment that the British representation on the Bagdad Railway finds its counterpart in German participation in the river navigation, and that it is hardly reasonable that Germany should claim to participate in the latter and in an eventual branch of the railway to the Persian Gulf as well. His Majesty’s Government trust that this point will not be pressed. Article 2, Clause (d ).—His Majesty’s Govern ment understand from Prince Lichnowsky’s note, that while the German Government in their counter-draft suggest that British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra should not be less than 20 per cent., they are prepared to concede 40 per cent, if so desired. It will be observed that the British counter-draft omits all reference to British participation in the port of Bagdad, while claiming a British participation of 50 per cent., as regards capital, directorate and contracts, in the port of Basra. Having regard to the fact that no British participation is claimed in the Railway Company’s proposed port at Bagdad, and to the large proportion *£ British shipping at the port of Basrajto that of the total4 shipping (the steam vessels entered and cleared at that port daring the year . 1912 hav,^ been 217 British, 12 German, 5 Russian, and . ' His Majesty’s Government confident y ^e ie\t that the degree of participation claimed will be regarded as very moderate and indeed as highly desirable in the general interests of the port. His Majesty’s Government further consider it desirable that the principal conditions as to the formation and operation of the port at Basra should be laid down in the present convention^ Article X Clause (a), corresponds to the German counter-draft. Article 3, Clause (b), gives effect to aiticle o of the original British draft of 10th June, 191Ju this article is ignored in the German counter draft, but it constitutes, in the view of His Majesty’s Government, a most important and essential condition of the present convention. Without it the provisions of article 2, clause (a), and article 3, clause (a), are illusory, and might, if it were so desired, be rendered nugatory. Inasmuch as a practical object of His Majesty’s Government in concluding the present convention is to guard against such a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf, except on conditions subject to their agreement, they trust the German Government, who by reason of the railway interests of German subjects are specially concerned, will not take exception to this clause. It may be said without exaggeration that the attitude of His Majesty’s Government throughout the present negotiations has been largely deter mined by the belief that they were effectively providing against the contingency under discussion. Article 3, Clause (c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment recognise, however, that the Germar Government may feel some disinclination t&lt; agree to the provisions of article 3 of the Britisl draft of tire 13th done, 1913, if that article stand: alone. They have accordingly redrafted article ‘ m r , a manner that clause («) is a mutua and ei l^ Vin ^’ C | ailse ^ 18 a Herman undertakino a d clause (c) is a British undertaking. Claus! (0 may, m some measure, be regarded as a set ol against clause (b). Set ' oi ohieet' 36 ^ ^ m0re0Ter ’ desi giied to meet th o jec , under a more precise definition, of clans .(c) of article 1 0 f the Clause (c) of article 9 do c »-draft U lde ° does compare unfavour5 ably with clause (b) of the same article, when it is borne in mind that British trade in Mesopo tamia amounts to some 60 per cent, of the whole ; having regard to this commercial predominance. His Majesty’s Government have felt compelled to limit their inaction to “ railway undertakings in direct competition with the Bagdad Company’s lines ” (as projected, of course, under the existing concessions), and they would have hesitated to agree even to this stipulation, had they not enter tained complete conlidence in the German assurances as to equality of treatment on that railway. They trust, however, that the concession offered under clause (c), in the interests of the Bagdad Railway Company, will induce that Company, and the affiliated Anatolian Railway Company, to adopt a conciliatory and favourable attitude towards certain desiderata of the Smyrna-Aidin Railway Company. These desiderata, which have been placed before the Ottoman Government, include an option for an eventual junction of that Company’s line with the Anatolian Company’s system, but only on conditions to be mutually agreed between the two companies. Inasmuch as the Anatolian Railway Company is already connected with Smyrna by the Smyrna-Cassaba Company’s line, it would seem that there can be no objection of principle to such a junction as that proposed with the Smyrna - Aidm Company s system, and to the establishment of facilities for through traffic. His Majesty’s Government feel that they can, with the more assurance, claim the co-operation of the German Government in bringing about such a settlement, inasmuch as the|Smyrna-Aidin line is the only remaining railway under British management in Turkey. They are further persuaded that, in considering this very moderate request, the German Government will not over look the fact that, in the recent adjustment of certain railway claims in Turkey, His Majesty’s Government have not only refrained for the present from claiming fresh railway concessions in favour of British subjects, but have even furthered, to the best of their ability, the adjust ment in question. /Article 4.—His Majesty’s Government appreci- ate the German objection to the idea of a monopoly, but it must not be overlooked that the Bagdad Railway is itself of the nature of a ° [10V7—6]6 monopoly, a fact which » emphasised by artiehA clause (c). Moreover, a monopoly of nav at exists already, and it appeals to is * ‘ Government that Germany, who now has rights on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates beyond the carriage of railway material during the period of construction, is losing nothing moio than the prospect of participation in the very improbable event of Turkey throwing the rivers open, for which uncertain prospect she is, accord ing to article 4, to be compensated by an actual share in a very profitable if exclusive under taking. It seems to His Majesty’s Government, therefore, that the objection raised m Prince Lichnowsky’s note can be answered, and the\ do not feel able to amend the Anglo-Turkish declaration in the manner suggested. Article 4, clause (a).—The second sub-clause of the German counter-draft appears, in these cir cumstances, to be superfluous, and it is, in the opinion of His Majesty’s Government, in itself objectionable, as appearing to put German and British interests on the rivers on an equality, a conclusion to which His Majesty’s Government could on no account assent, having regard to the fact that the rivers have been navigated by British vessels for well-nigh three centuries, and that such navigation has taken place by virtue of special and ancient firmans. An addition has, however, been added to clause (u) which, it is hoped, will secure to the German Government such furthei protection as they consider desirable. Article 4, clause (6).—Prince Lichnowsky refers m his note to “ the desire to establish a parallel ” with British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Basra. The parallel would now be con fined to such participation in the latter port; but even so there would seem to be little analooy between participation in a single port company and participation in the lucrative enterprise of extensive and exclusive river navigation. Notwithstanding the basis of agreement sug gested on the 7th May, PAL3, His Majesty’s Govern -ent are,, after careful consideration, propped to agree not to oppose German interests in acqnirW tfircTof ttf 11 T c b st ’ Dc t from not Uss than) one- 1 ° f tlle ^'e-capital allotted to Turkish interests m the Ottoman Company for Pe navigation. They are confident that thisT portant concession, over and above the termi agreement suggested in the memorandum „7 the 7til May, 1913, will be borne in mind by the German Government in considering the points to which His Majesty’s Government, on their part, attach importance. Article 4, Clause ,(c).—His Majesty’s Govern ment attach cardinal importance to a specific limitation of five years, and to the reservations embodied in the British draft. . But, in view of the final paragraph of this clause, they trust that an agreement of the nature indicated may be reached between the parties interested, in which case the wording of the clause in question could be revised. Article 5 of the British counter-draft calls for no explanations, except that the preamble has, so far as applicable, been based upon that ol article 2. Article 6 corresponds to articles 5 and 6 of the German counter-draft. Having regard to the fact that the whole water- may of the Shatt-el-Arab is Turkish, it appears to His Majesty’s Government that the wording of article 5 of the German counter-draft might perhaps somewhat offend Ottoman susceptibilities. The wording of article 5 of the British draft ol the 10th June, 1913, was based upon the fact that the Ottoman Government, recognising the practical services rendered through British agency in maintaining access to the port of Basra in the past, were prepared to conclude an agree ment with His Majesty’s Government on the lines known to the German Government. His Majesty’s Government have considered very carefully the proposal to establish a “ comite de surveillance ” contained in article 6 of the German counter-draft, but they are persuadec that the inconvenience which would arise from the co-existence of two bodies would be detn- mental to the interests of navigation. They confidently believe, however, that the wording of article 6 of the British counter-draft will, in effect, meet the points to which the German Government attach importance. Article 7.—His Majesty’s Government trust that this article may be suppiessef or reasons explained in the notes printed opposite the several clauses of the German counter-draft They desire to conclude a definite and operative convention with the German ded Much is to remain in suspenc /vf GlTl Q animation. J8 1W I • Ir ^ Hi IlffifelSi! |p|| : ■ Note. —I have msevtcd Article 8 corresponds to the German coonter- His Majesty’s Government earnestly trust that the views expressed in this memorandum will command the willing assent of the German Government.

Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received August 25.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, August 25, 1913. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to refer to your letter of the 15th August relative to recent conversations between Herr von Kuhlmann and Mr. Parker on the subject of the German proposal for the establishment of a “ comite de surveillance ” in connection with the conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab, and also to your letter of the 22nd August, transmitting copy of a letter from the India Office on the same subject, and to offer the following observations thereon for Sir E. Grey’s consideration. The Board are disposed to doubt the advisability of His Majesty’s Government entering into anything like a definite undertaking as to the standard to which the facilities for navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab are to be brought within any prescribed period. Having regard to the considerations as stated by Herr von Kuhlmann, which have led the German Government to put forward their proposal, it appears probable that they would press for the term of years (contemplated in Sir E. Grey’s suggestion) to be short; and it might prove in practice impossible (for financial or other reasons) for the undertaking if given to be carried out. Further, as observed in the letter from the India Office above referred to, it is not clear that a merely advisory committee would serve -any very useful purpose; and representations to the iurkish Government as to the management of the conservancy or the allocation to it o± larger funds, would certainly be more weighty and effective if made directly by those Governments the interests of whose nationals are immediately concerned vith t navigation the force 0 f the contention of the India Office that the Srzs? r” to“.. ^ r “s trr s K approval, that a preferable eoniee to any Pjofo^a ert q£ ^ £ 0 n 0W ing endeavour to secure the acceptance by ^ article 5 of the revised formula, which might form an addhiona parag p article 6 being then draft transmitted with the Board’s letter of the bth August, omitted :— after the Bagdad Railway has been competed as far as 1^ “ If at any time after the Bagdad y ailwa yy a %“n l ;:i:y“ i ;ediment to state of the channel of the Shatt-el-Arab is SU&lt; A JJ® p re ason of ocean-going vessels the traffic of the railway or of the river-gomg facility, the two Governments being unable to obtain access to Basra wi to gecure t h e removal of the will take into consideration the steps necessa y impediment.” It might be pointed out to th ® C ^™“ a ®Afiiy I arimportant for British as for maintenance of good access^ to the p important, since the failure of 11 German interests, and will in the futur t te f or navigation would cause conservancy to keep the river m a satisfactory^^ ^ to the Euphrates and p. . .

I HAD a meeting with Herr von Kuehlmann to-day when we discussed, very cursorily and on the distinct understanding that at this stage anything which passed should be regarded as non-committal, the attached counter-draft of an Anglo-German convention. Herr von Kuehlmann admitted that it was desirable that the agreement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Turkish Government should, if possible, precede the conclusion of the Anglo-German Convention, and we agreed that the latter might perhaps be initialled pending the signature of the former. This would get rid of the conditional nature of article 2. With regard to a British participation of 50 per cent, in the port of Bagdad, he seemed to think this might be conceded, though Germany (and I j think justly so) would insist on the Bagdad I , Railway Company retaining the casting vote. He said there might be some difficulty infapportioning the contracts for the construction of the port equally between the two nationalities, inasmuch as if two firms of contractors were employed great extravagance would ensue. IVe agreed that this was a matter for experts. Herr von Kuehlmann told me he thought the arrangement now suggested for article o was particularly ingenious. The German Government had disliked the proposal which is now article 3 (b), as they had felt that there was no reason why they, any more than any other Rover, should give such an undertaking, and they felt they would be much criticised for making such a stipulation ; but he admitted that a case for reconsideration appeared to have been made out by the drafting we had proposed, balancing article 3 (b) against article 3 (c), and that he would recommend that the German Government should examine the point afresh. He said e was not sure if the limitation “within the pro vinces of Bagdad and Mosul” was sufficiently Tde to give the Bagdad Railway Company adequate protection. I urged that it was m point [1062 b]2 of fact a very large concession on our part wrren it was recollected that our trade in the tw o pi o whole. Parenthetically I may mention that M. de Fleuriau told me yesterday that he thought the French had dropped the Afeppo-Meskene project, and that he did not think the French Govern ment would object to our giving the 'Germans an assurance of the nature in question with regard to more westerly provinces as well as Bagdad and Mosul if we so desired. I do not think, however, that the Germans are likely to prefes this extension: hut I feel that if they wrnnt to get the assurance we offer in article 3 (c) it will afford us a good lever for getting them to : concede article 3 (6), which is important. •' ■ As to article (5) he told me that the' Bagdad Railway wanted to have the right of using launches in the ports as well as fetries, and that these would of course be Smaller than the ferries. I said in that case it would be necessary to obtain, by an additional convention (which will in any case be required) a further modification of Lord Inchcape’s concession. T he launches he said would be solely for the mse of the port and railway officials. Article C, about the Shatt-el-Arab Commission, we agreed to reserve. He read me some observa tions, very much to the point, about the desiderata of the Hamburg-Amerika Line re garding the river; but, after some discussion, we decided to postpone detailed consideration of this point till next Tuesday, and in the interval he is going to write me a private letter explaining m greater detail his own views as to the Shatt-eL Arab difficulty, and his suggestions for over coming it. He will also send a copy of the observations of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. I asked him if he thought it would not bp vmces was some 60 per cent, or more of the ay could get some reasonable m ight come inguarantee tliat access to Bussorah would be im proved and maintained, and that failing such a result the Germans should have some effective means of redress. I said I did not wish to suggest the above clause definitely, but only tentatively. He said our Admiralty seemed to have the idea that the Commission was to do no dredging and to sit down and watch the river pass along assisted by training works : the idea of the German shipping companies on the other hand was that a substantial amount of dredging should be done. I asked him about funds ; and I said that although pessimists—who made no allowance for future expansion of trade—had pointed out that, on an average of past years, the tonnage dues would only yield about 11,000Z. a-year, it did seem difficult to see how the Commission could spend say 75,000b on a dredger straight off. He replied that in his view we should press the Turks in this matter to provide the funds and to ‘earmark, over and above the shipping dues, a certain proportion of the customs duties of Basra as security for a loan to be raised by the Commission, and for other purposes of river conservancy. It must not be overlooked that the improvement of the port and river would lead to un immense development of Mesopotamia, and it was only fair that the Turks should contribute something to this result.

Grey to state that Herr von KueMmann called at the Foreign Office on the 12th instant and saw Mr. Parker. He enquired whether it was considered that the German counter-draft respecting the Bagdad Railway and cognate matters offered a basis for a settlement, and if His Majesty’s Government were likely to ask for any substantial modifications. Mr. Parker replied that the draft was still under consideration, but it was hoped to submit a reply at an early date, that certain modifications would be proposed, and that the German proposal for a “ comite de surveillance ” on the Shatt-el-Arab was the subject of grave and insuperable objection on the part of His Majesty’s Govern ment, and, Mr. Parker thought, was likely to be so on the part of the Ottoman Government. On the 13th instant Herr von Kuehlmann again called at the Foreign Office and said that he had been thinking over the question, and he enquired if His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to agree to the German Government, instead of insisting upon a “comite de surveillance,” concluding a convention with the Ottoman Government, providing that the Shatt-el-Arab up to Basra shall always be maintained in such a condition as would admit of large ocean-going vessels (of a tonnage to be agreed upon) having easy access to Basra, and that, in the event of such a state of affairs not being maintained by the proposed Ottoman Commission, Germany, in common with other Powers, should have the right to claim the internationalisation of the Commission. Mr. Parker replied that he would submit this proposal for consideration, but that he could express no opinion respecting it. Herr von Kuehlmann said that the proposal was made by him on his own responsibility, but that he was in communication with the Hamburg-Amerika Line respecting the size of ships likely to frequent the port of Basra within the next twenty years or so, and he suggested that similar enquiries should be addressed to the British India Steam Navigation Company. Great importance was attached to the abandon ment by the Bagdad Railway Company of their right to construct a port on the Persian Gulf and it would only be possible to reconcile public opinion in Germany to such a step if the German Government were in a position to show that they had the means, if necessary by the representation of Germany on the Commission, to render the port ° f Sir E. Grey has had this proposal under his personal con- sideration and that he considers there is some force m the arguments of Herr yon Kuehlmann and that perhaps they might be met by agreeing to the establishment o a “comite de surveillance” if after a certain number of years ocean-going steamers of a certain tonnage were unable to get access to Basra ; the number of years and the '“Hfteci^ that th6 B ° ard ° f WiU consider a settlement on th 0 f t p e nth August, of which a copy was I am to refer to L subject of British participation in the ports of Bagdad sent to your depaitment, on t J P ent w i t h Lord Inchcape s - ix 1- b. ta».d -.d statement showing the objections to those views. i &amp;0 W.

My dear Parker: ^ 7 4 O O i i - ' c I 'g We have gone through the counter-draft of the proposed Anglo-German Convention which you en closed in your official letter No. 36' ; 70 dated the 26th August, and find that for the most part it is identical with the draft we sent you with our letter of the 8th. There are two or three verbal altera tions and a slight variation of arrangement which on the whole tend to improve it. The following are the only observations which occur to me at present. (l) i take it from the alteration in Ar ticle 2 (a) where the words 'has renounced'' have been substituted for 'shall renounce' that signature of the Convention will be deferred until the Bagdad Com pany have actually notified the fact of renunciation - if they have not already done so. a—M fis 2 (d) where (2) The alterations in ^please the Germans, hut I agree that it is better out than in. As to clause (b) of this Article, I under stand that the reason for substituting one-third for 40 per cent, is that the Turks will not give more than the former proportion. I suppose you will try to satisfy the Germans, on the point of difference between their proposed share in the navigation Company and our proposed share in the Basra port Company, that there is no relation between the two concerns and that we are giving up something in consenting to stand down as re gards a port at Bagdad? ( 5 ) ' 'Becorded M in clause (&amp;/ of Article 5 should of course be 'accorded'. Clause (b) of this Article will not do as It stands: the proposal In the draft we sent you as to a limit of 100 tons gross referred to small craft for local requirements, not to ferries, shall havs to give you another limit lor ferries if limit is necessary at all. Yours very sincerely. Geo. J. Stanley. (Signed )opy » FOREIGN OFFICE, August 28th, 1913. t Q I 3 \ —/ i v -'- My dear StaniByT I have read through your private letter of August 28th about the Anglo-German draft, and T agree with all you write subject to the following remarks:- I do not quite agree with your feeling about clause c of Article 3. My view is that the Germans are making a far greater concession to us under clause b. Clause c is carefully worded by the use of the expression ' direct competition'. As a mat ter of fact Monsieur de Fleuri.au told me that he per sonally did not think the French Government would object, so far as they were concerned, to the wording suggested by the Germans, as now the French and Ger- mans havs com© to terms. The area being confined to Mosul and Bagdad provinces, I do not think the Russians could reason ably object, having regard especially to the tenns of the Potsdam agreement, (two articles). Article 4 a (second paragraph) of the German draft gives the Germans a locus^tafldl on the rlver ’ / whichwhich iu is ‘true they get otherwise under our agree ment, but which, if it stood, might support the conten tion that they possessed one before. I will leave a blank as to the tonnage of the ferries, but I am anxious to avoid the use of the word small craft, as it would not correspond with the word- ing of Lord Inchcape’s draft concession. May I ask you to be so very kind as to have a copy of this letter made for our records 9 I am writing late and cannot get it copied here, and I want you to have it first thing in the morning. Sir A. Hirtzel suggests that article 4 seems not to be in quite the right place now that so much has been excised from the German draft. He suggests that it might be better as a clause c at the end of article 5. I have carefully considered the point, and I think it is better where it is, as it is a proviso to clause a of article 4. I am, however, calling article 4d a-ticle 4c now. I will hand Kuehlmann the memorandum about rail way rates enclosed in your official letter of .0 da/ date. Yours sincerely, (Signed) Alwyn Parker.OF TRADE, GWYBYF HOUSE, WHITEHALL, S.W. 29th August, 1913. of yesterday with re ference to the draft Anglo-German Convention. I cannot say that I quite agree with you - I am sorry - about the relative importance of Clauses (b) and (c) of Article 3. To my mind the Ger man concession in (b)doss not count for much in view of clause (a) of the Article. If there is to be no railway from Basra to the Gulf (without ou” permis sion) there can scarcely be any railway terminu», and .Ithout a railway swing access to Borne place ol Im portance no one Is likely to want to build a port. But the entire abandonment to the Oemans ol all rail way construction In the two vilayets as proposed In Clause (c&gt; IS, I venture to think, a weightier matter 1 „ spite of the qualification Introduced by the refer ence to 'direct competition'.

Germans confuse oceanic company with river company of the same name. Arab steamship company referred to in my report of 1911 under the heading of “ New Steamship Lines between Bombay and Persian Gulf ” as flying British flag is registered at Bombay, and runs to Basra only. It is quite distinct from Arab steam ship company (“ Aga Jaffer ”) referred to in my report under heading “River Navigation” as running three steamers on the Tigris. Latter company is so called locally to distinguish it from the Turkish Lynch Company in river navigation, but the term is explanatory rather than [? nominal], and shipping orders are stamped “ Aga Mohammed Jaffer’s steamers.” Foreigners can of course participate indirectly in river navigation through Aga Jaffer. There are several Persian shareholders in the concern, and it is generally believed that Wonckhaus lends him money. We cannot get proof, but their business relations are too close and intimate to admit of any other conclusion. There is no restriction as to time or number of steamships in Aga’s original permit, or in decision of Administrative Council allowing him to transfer to Tigris. Documents merely permit him to run under conditions stated, and distinctly mention that no concession or monopoly is granted. I infer from this that arrangement is terminable as you suggest. . vi V I'T 27 x&gt;rr Y*? i '\j * v ; [1019 —493 ]CONFIDENTIAL. i: Consul Crow to Sir Edward Grey .—(Received August 27, 11'30 a.m.) Basra, August 26, 1913. the present position of x^ga Jailer’s Arab company : Capital £ T. 35,000, oi which he holds two-thirds, and remainder is held by seven shaiehoiders, mostly Persian, amongst whom are Sheikh of Mohammerah and his clerk.

How do you reconcile this with the condition that the river steamers must fly the Turkish flag ? Is the Arab Steam ship Company registered at Bombay, and, if so, how can such registration be reconciled with the stipulation that the permission for river navigation is not transferable to foreigners ? It is unfortunate that you referred in your report to the Arab Steamship Company, instead of to Aga Jaffer, as carrying on river navigation, as the German Government have informally quoted your statement as evidence that foreigners can in practice, if not in theory, participate in navigation of Tigris at present. Have you any means of ascertaining definitely whether Wonckhaus is associated with Aga Jaffer, and have you any information to show whether the permit given to Aga Jaffer is terminable at option of Ottoman Government ?

In your published report for 1911 you state that three steamships belonging to the Arab Steamship Company are plying on the Tigris, and in a previous paragraph you refer to that company as flying the British flag. How do you reconcile this with the condition that the river steamers must fly the Turkish flag ? Is the Arab Steam ship Company registered at Bombay, and, if so, how can such registration be reconciled with the stipulation that the permission for river navigation is not transferable to foreigners ? It is unfortunate that you referred in your report to the Arab Steamship Company, instead of to Aga Jaffer, as carrying on river navigation, as the German Government have informally quoted your statement as evidence that foreigners can in practice, if not in theory, participate in navigation of Tigris at present. Have you any means of ascertaining definitely whether Wonckhaus is associated with Aga Jaffer, and have you any information to show whether the permit given to Aga Jaffer is terminable at option of Ottoman Government ?

The objection to both courses is the inducement which they offer to a Power or Powers to bring about the isation of the river or the supersession of the Commission by making the latter bankrupt - whether by refusing to pay. dues, or by hindering the supply of funds by the Turkish Government. But that risk (which probably ,, j. ir, the last resort the means that m tne aas fundsfunds will have to be found by His Majesty's G-ovenvnent) must apparently be faced, and if the Turkish Government will accept the Geiman proposal (and if -oourir» the conditions regarding tonnage etc. are not unreasonable) f it appears to the Marquess of Crewe that the certainty of internationalisation in the event of default on the part of the Commission will probably &amp;iffi&lt;*&amp; induce them to strain m no-n&amp;&amp;' to prevent that event from occurring.

Instant Herr von Kuhlmann again called at the Foreign Office and said that he had been thinking over the question, and he enquired if His Majesty's Government would be prepared to agree to the German Government, instead of insisting upon a co nlte de surveillance . concluding a convention with the Ottoman Government providing that the Shatt-el-Arah up to Bub so rail shall always he maintained in such a con dition as would admit of large ocean-going vessels (of a tonnage to he agreed upon) having easy access to Bus Borah, and that, in the event of such a state of affairs not being maintained hy the proposed Ottoman Commission, Germany, in common with other Powers, should have the right to claim the internationalisation of the commission. Mr. Parker replied that he would submit this proposal for consideration hut that he could express no opinion respecting it. Herr von Kuhlmann paid that the proposal was made hy him on his own responsibility, hut that he was in communication with the Hamburg-Merlka Line respecting the(37439/13) the size or ships likely to frequent the port of Bussorah within the next twenty years or so, and he suggested that similar enquiries should he addressed to the British India Steam Navigation Company. Great importance v/as attached to the abandonment by the Bagdad Railway Company of their right to construct a port on the Persian Gulf, and it would only be possible to reconcile public opinion in Germany to such a step if the German Government were in a position to show that they had the means, if necessary by the representation of Germany on the Commission, to render the port of Bussorah accessi ble. I am to state that Sir E. Grey has had this proposal under his personal consideration, and that he considers there is some force in the arguments of Herr von Kuhlmann and that perhaps they might be met by agreeing to the establishment of a remit A de surve lllaiice if after a certain number of years ocean-going steamers of a certain tonnage were unable to get access to Brssor^. The number of years and the tonnage would require care ful consideration In(37439/13) ® In thepe circumetancee I am to express the hope that the Secretary of State for India will consider a settlement on the lines suggested. I am to refer to Lord Inchcape's letter of August 11th, of which a copy was sent to your Department, on the subject of British participation in the ports of Bagdad and Bussorah: I am to enquire if the Marquess of Crewe is in agreement with Lord Inchcape's views, and, in the contrary event, to request that he may he furnished with a reasoned statement showing the objec tions to those views. I am. Sir, Your most obedient. humble Servant,C. J / H03EKALL SUTHERLAND. August 11th } 19i: Ely dear Parker With reference to your letter of 9th I give you,, as desired, my remarks on the papers you sent roe. ihe British draft of Article 2 (d) is worded db 'follows: 'The construction of the proposed port at Basra shall he executed in a manner to he mutually agreed upon, and so that British participation in the undertak ing shall amount to 50 per cent of the whole'. hut the German draft as submitted is:- 'The construction of the proposed ports at Basra and Bagdad shall he executed by a separate Ottoman company wherein British participation shall amount to not less than 20 per cent of the whole 'see covering note from German Ambassador as to per cent age). ihe statutes and ’cahiers des charges' of the ports of Basra and Bagdad company and concession shall oe formed on the model of the Haidar-Pasha, Port Company (bee article 2 (d) of British draft)'. The British draft makes no reference to a port at Baghdad, and I think it is rather clever of the Germans to have introduced this. As a matter of fact, they know perfectly well that no 'port' is wanted at Baghdad and no Lwyn Parker, Esq., Foreign Office. t ■no port can over oe made there. No ocean-aoing steaiaers can ever get within 500 miles of Baghdad, and it is ridiculous to speak of a port there. I think the Germans have tacked Baghdad on to Basra and have offered us a share in the 'port' there so as to secure for themselves a larger share in Busreh, which can really he made a port for deep draft vessels if the Shat-al-Arah helow Busreh is dredged and the her at the mouth removed. Iviy conclusion as to Genian motives is home out hy what Prince Lichnowsky says in his letter to 3ir Edrard Grey dated 16th July. He says under section (d) - ”At first it was only contemplated to five British capital a participation in the port of Basra, hut the Bagdad Rail/my Company have been induced to grant the sane participation for the port of Bagdad, this oeing considered an important concession, &amp;c., c,c. and it is set up as a reason for reducing British participation In the control of the Port of Basra from 50 per cant to 20 per cent of the /hole which might mean l(?o of Busra? This is all humbug. As I have scud there is nothing; to be done at Baghdad m .no . of making a port and nothing is required, whereas Basra will enormously increase in importance as time goes on. andend it is Mghly desirable that British interests should preponderate there. Even fifty per cent is too little for Great Britain, I »dVo not tne figures by me, but I think you will find that at least 80 per cent of the shipping frequenting Basra is British, and I rather think the British India wOixiucniiy itself contributes 5Cfo of the total tonnage visiting the port, if not more. I would strongly advise that the British draft he adhered to if more than 5 Q -1 cannot now he got, and that we should magnanimously waive all right to any partici pation in Baghdad, because, as I have said, there will never he a port made there. We might as well talk of making one at Mapledurhem on the Thames. I am not sure that I have put forward ray views in such a form as will enable you to pass them on to the Germans, but you will be able to extract as much from them as will allow you to put forward good and suffi- ci ent reasons for adhering to your original draft. In om the Tigris Navigation point of view it is most important that no excuse should be given for throwing money away atat • baelldad ‘ It is ver y important that Baghdad should ha kept out altogether so far as 'ports” go I return the papers as desired.

CS * • I am directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 25th July (No.33602) transmitting copy of a M ote from the German Embassy, with enclosures, on the subject of the proposed Anglo- German Agreement about the Bagdad railway and cognate matters. In reply I an to say that the Board have given their careful consideration to these documents and now desire me to forward to you a revised edition of the German counter-draft of July 16th arranged so as to show the alterations which the Hoard consider necessary in order to make the counter-dr afi accwptajlv, vO H^s Majesty’s Government. It will be seen that in general there is no very great divergence between the counter draft in its original shape and in its revised form as „ proposed. The following observations with regard now prcpoi Ehe Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office. toto the alterations proposed are submitted for the consideration of Sir E. Grey:~ Artlcle l f Clause 1. - The alterations suggested will bring this clause into accord with the corres ponding provision of the Russo-German Agreement of August, 1911. It is thought that it would he prefer able to retain the final phrase which the German Embassy suggest should be omitted, as the clause with out those words might possibly be held to bind His Majesty's Government not to object to the assignment of particular revenues, or even to the further increase of Customs duties for the purpose of expediting the construction of the Railway. a-rtir-.-ifl 1. clause 2.^ as altered, is the original proposal of His Majesty's Government. In this form the proposal is in accord with the undertaking the German Oovermmt, propose « “ ArMU 4 (a) “ tho novlsstion »r I 15 ris end Euphrates. — ' r.lause ^ or the cotmter-drart Mm , tM Board assume, he omitted on political grounds. •pney are, however, or opinion that the proposal con- . . .louse 2 (e) or their original dratt regurd- tained in clause a ■e +..m British Directors to the ing the admission or two In.is.Board of the Bagdad Railway Company should he re inserted hare. Article Preamble . - This has been amended so as to meet the German proposal embodied in clause (a) of Article 7 of the German counter-draft, and at the same time to endeavour to expedite the conclusion of the arrangement between the Bagdad Railway Company and the Ottoman Government by treating it as a prelimin ary to the signature of the Agreement now under con sideration. With regard to clause (d) of this Article the Board think it desirable that the principal ccnciticns as to the formation and operation of the ports at Bagdad and Basra should be laid down in the present agreement, and they have accordingly incorporated in •his clause the substance of the provisions of the ir&amp; n Annex enclosed in their letter of June 12th, codified by the reduction of British participation from 50 to 40 per cent. They understand from Prince Lichnowsky's Note of the 16th July that whilst the Gennan in their connt.r-draXt suggest.* that such participation should not be less than 2C per cent. .se-ara* to concede 40 per cent. If so ceslreC- they are prepared uu ^As regards Article 3 of the original British draft, which the German Government propose to omit, ■ the Board are of opinion that the German undertalcing embodied in that Article should if possible be ob tained, but they see no objection to the German pro posal to give the undertaking in a private Note. Article 4: (b)» *** The alterations here explain themselves. The Board assume that the views of the Ottoman Government as to German acquisition of a portion of the Turkish holding In the Navigation Company will he definitely ascertained before this Article is finally settled. 4 (c). - This clause has been entirely re-drafted with a view (a) to making 1‘ apply Bolely to the new navigation Company, it being impossible in this Convention to bind the Euphrates and Tigris Steam Navigation Company; and (b) to incorporating 8 „ch a provision regarding -roPatos- and -mrongn biu . „ f lading* as it Is thought Ma ^ esty B Government oonld agree to -itnont Inconvenience. +hi~ clause is submitted to the Before, however, thin ciaus SSIM Government, tne Poatd tnin* H Cealra™ ^ no referred to Lord Incncape m case no,I ----- as the concessionaire for the new Company, should have any criticiam to offer with regard to it. Article 4 (ci) . The alteration here sug gested is, as will be seen, a combination of the German proposals with the original proposal of His Majesty^ Government, modified, however, by a proviso that the time limit of five years shall not become effective if the Bagdad Railway Company can show that no satisfactory means of conveyance for railway material exists other than their own vessels. The prolongation of the Company's right until the com- / P let ion of branches to Khaniicin and Hit is un- necessary since with the completion of the railway to Basra an adequate alternative means of conveyance of material for these branches by rail will be avail able. It is moreover undesirable since if one or other of these branches be not constructed the pro longation would he indefinite. 4 (e). - This additional clause de sired by the German Goverment can, it 1 b thought be ! ii accepted provided that the limitation noted in respect of small craft he conceded. I *3 ArticleArticle 5 « - The reviBed draft is based on the fact that the Bhatt-ei-Arah Conservancy Cocinission is to he an Ottoman authority. It will he noted that it incorporates clause (d) of Article 7 of the counter draft. Article 6 . - The Board are of opinion that the proposal in the counter-draft to establish a Comite * de Surveillance in respect of the river conservancy is open to serious objection. The revised draft is intended to give effect to the alternative proposal to give individual Consuls at Basra the right to make representations to the Conservancy Commission.

Memorandum by Mr. Parker. 1 OR convenience of comparison I have set out the British draft and the German counter-draft on page G et seq. in parallel columns. VTe have already received the India Office comments (see [34914] ) on the German counter- draft, and I now propose to deal with each clause seriatim, quoting first the substance of the India Office comments whenever made, and then nivinu my own observations :— Article 1 (clause i).—I see no objection to making this article No. 1 instead of No. 6 . I also think we might agree to the deletion of the sentence in square brackets, as it is utterly meaningless from the moment we have agreed to the Turkish customs increase, and its retention indicates confusion of thought. Article 1 (clause ii).—The India Office, while they would have been prepared to make a more positive declaration of support in respect of the Bagdad Railway in general, are not willing to do so in respect of the Bagdad-Basra extension in particular, because (so I understand) they consider the extension will be of little advantage to us, while the railway in general will benefit our trade. My view is that t he extension (Bagdad-Basr a) will benefit our trade more than any other portion of the railway ; but on the whole, and for other reasons, I think we should perhaps adhere to our original wording. Article 1 (clause m).—This clause is new and the India Office “hope that it will be accepted.” I think it is both too comprehensive and too indefinite for acceptance as it stands. We must first agree with the German Govern ment as to the limits of Mesopotamia ; and we must consider all the lines we may be debarred from supporting. [1003—4] Bi: f I ■ Thus the French wish to build a line from Meskene to Aleppo with, so I understood from M. Roux, of the French Embassy, the option of perhaps eventually continuing it towards agi ai. I further gather that the French attach particular importance to the line from Meskene to Aleppo, because Meskene is mentioned as the limit o om navigation concession on the Euphrates, and t e French would like to feed their Syrian system with some of this river traffic. The Germans consider that the French line from Aleppo to Meskene would divert a lot of the Bagdad Railway traffic and they are strongly opposed to it. I think this fear, so long as the line stops at Meskene and is not prolonged towards Bagdad, is exaggerated, and that the h rench line would largely serve regions (c.g., Syria) outside those of the Bagdad Railway Company. I think that in the first instance we should propose to make the Aleppo-Meskene line an exception to any under taking such as Germany desires we should give not to support competing railways, and I will refer later (in dealing with article 4 of the draft agreement) to a further proposal regarding this line. I think it is quite fair for the Germans to aim at giving the Bagdad Railway, as Prince Lichnowsky puts it, “ a reasonable security against competing lines,” and I think the Germans probably have in mind the Homs- Bagdad project and the Tigris Valley project promoted by us in 1910. (I do not think any reference is intended to the Mohammerah— Khoremmabad line, though that will, if made, compete with the Bagdad Railway.) I think, therefore, we should accept in principle article 1 , clause iii, of the German counter-draft, subject tef the adoption of a more definite wording. Article 2. I think the German preamble to this article may be accepted. Aitide 2 (a).—The India Office consider that this clause of the German draft, read in conjunc tion with article 3 of that draft, is acceptable, a . tliat a declaration that the Basra Gulf section is indefinitely postponed is unnecessary '2 ?;« *ti ,k! “ o— -w f! t , 2 ( 77 rhls 18 Sll 8 ’gested in place of article 2 (e) of the British draft.

Ihis should be compared with “ ® ^ of , the British draft and read in conpunetron with Prince Lichnowsky’s evplana- ttons m has covering' note. The India Office lot reasons explained in [34914], prefer om’ cauae and deprecate the arrangement as to Uerman participation if a Basra-Gulf line is e\ei made. In the first place such a line would be ruled out indefinitely by the wordmg of article 3, unless His Majesty’s Government agreed to it ; but, apart from this, I can see no objection to giving the Germans’ a minor participation, for their request seems truly reasonable, having regard to their great interest Av f/tiu, I, (jj ^o&lt;- UK ^ hi ^ ^ 7:4- iUU, U' dt Ww4- /W, Cvxray O&amp;ul/ rZ/fr. ■ ■ ■ lxavII1 .g regard to their great interest 4 U OuZ^ r/ ^ ^ r 1 ‘ raffic Wllich woald over the line (if dZ r \ , ^ A b , Uil ‘ ) the Bagdad system, and such a ' i' *' “■ mender participation as they suggest would give d 4 LM fhoto f&amp;u. them uo control.

I do not think that if we asked for, say, 40 per cent, in the construc tion of the ports Germany would necessarily even claim a similar percentage in the navigation .company. There is really little analogy between the two 'enterprises, one being participation merely in the ^construction of ports, the other being participation In the conduct of river navigation for a large number of years—and this essential difference might be pointed out to Prince Licbnowsky when we reply. / // n I am not sure if we are very largely interested .

As to the co7itrol (as distinct from the construc tion) of the ports, I think there is little if any real difference between us and the Germans—but the navigationmatter is dependent on the working out of details and can well be reserved. . Artkle 3—I think the German draft is beep. desirable and should be accepted so far as it goes, but it does not cover the object aimed at by article 3 of the British draft. As the India / f Office point out, that object is ignored in the German draft,, and iliey suggest it is nee ess an to insert words to secure it. Herr von Schubert, of the G erman fLinhass v, called at the Foreigh Office to-day and asked to see me. He observed incidentally that the German Government would be very unwilling to wive an undertaking, snob as that contained in our draft of article 3„ in an agreement to be pub lished ; to do so would expose them and the whole agreement to a great deal of criticism in Germany, and it would be asked in the press why Germany, any more than, say, France, slionld give such an undertaking; but the German Government would be willing to give an assurance such as we desired in a confidential note. Article 4 (a ).—The remarks of Prince Lich- nowsky (see the bottom of page 1 and top of page 2 of his letter of the 16th July) should be referred toi On this clause the India Office write a's follows “ Lord Crewe appreciates the German objection to the idea of a monopoly; but it must be remembered that the Lag dad Railway is itself of the nature of a monopoly—a fact which is emphasised by the third clause of article 1. Moreover a monopoly of navigation exists already, and Germany, who now has no rights, in the river beyond the carriage of railway material, is losing nothing more than the prospect of participation in the very improbable event of Turkey throwing the rivers open—for which uncertain prospect she is to he (? claims to be.—A. P.) compensated by an actual share of not less than 20 per cent, in a very profitable if exclusive undertaking. The objection can therefore he answered, and his Lordship would prefer not to amend the Anglo-Turkish declaration as suggested m Prince Lichnowskyb letter (viz., that the word ‘ exclusive ’ (right of navigation), &amp;c„ should he omitted). The second sub-clause of 4 (a) will then he unnecessary, and is in itself , objectionable as appearing to put German and British interests in the rivers on an equality.” I I entirely agree with tie above remarks subject to one reservation: Germany claims, so Herr von KuMmann told me, that it is contrary to the Capitulations for Turkey to establish a monopoly tt_ Ks J^]tCCuKAK, ^Wvy\Cviy fa 6 ^ Uy\ Utsv-nisdL . £- 0 ' Lj\/ Ci/v\/lp {jt/r (rA/fc $ A ^5 luM ^ *1; :+ i / 3-ee p. 8.

I think, in view of ,/ y S “ a “tonance of a monopoly for so long and for other reasons, that it would be possible o oveitoine the view that it is contrarv to the Capitulations, but there is perhaps just the shadow of a doubt. A : Hde . 4 .W.-The German request for pai ticipation in the Turkish share of the naviga tion company must be considered from three standpoints : the British, the Turkish, and the i^rench.^ (Russia, having no sort of interest in the navigation/ can presumably be ignored, and any claim she might make to come in be success- fully resisted.) 1. The British standpoint .—Under tire terms of the draft concession negotiated by Lord Inchcape and Hakki Pasha control is secured to Lord Inchcape no matter how tie Turkish share of the enterprise is distribute If, therefore, the concession is confirmed substantially in its existing form (which Hakki Pasha anticipates within three weeks’ time) British control would not he endangered by a certain German participa tion in the Turkish side of the company, especially since Prince Lichnowsky says in his covering note (top of page 2 ) :— “We would, therefore, be prepared to receive favour ably any proposals about voting agreements which would seem to the British Government desirable in order to assure the effective British control of the river navigation company.” I think that there is a positive advantage to us in securing a German interest in, and therefore future German diplomatic support for, the new navigation company, provided the German interest is confined within limits. Lord Inchcape is prepared, so I understand, to welcome such German participation, and to conclude an additional contract in due course with Turkey so as to admit it, and this would allow for the appointment of a German director. 2. The Turkish standpoint .—I have spoken to Hakki Pasha about the German desire for par ticipation, as we had before informed him of Herr von Kuhlmann’s assurance that Germany [1003—4] C6 III | i ■ would abandon •» *d' i-»wi* change of attitude before the ag.ee . Lord Inchcape was concluded, as of course any German participation must come out of the Turkish share so as not to invalidate Lo Inchcape’s control. j .i . Hakki Hasha said lie appreciated this, and that he had already learnt of the German wish to participate through Djavid Bey from Pans He said that he thought Turkey would not object to giving Germany a certain participation, but he added emphatically that she could not agree to give any participation to France or Russia, neithei of whom had any commercial interest in that r region. 3. The French standpoint .—I do not think, from what M. Gambon told mo on the Jth July, that the French are very likely to object to the navigation monopoly; but I think we might attempt (whether we shall succeed is perhaps doubtful) to make it a condition of German participation in the navigation that Germai should not oppose the French request for a C/Zri Ctrd '^AAKj fa) rffiVYUj ^ j IF^roti irfuc ^ 'ComaI' / £?

We might point out to the Germans hi ML ^ £ that if they participate in the navigation the - ^ g lu^nA French may claim to do likewise ; and that V~L / it would be convenient to induce them to LL abandon such a claim by setting oh the Aleppo- i Ot Meskene concession^ against it if they do. The ^ French, who ask our support in M. Gambon’s note of the 9th J uly, yould he grateful for our assistance, and if the said railway were built, it might he of advantage to the navigation company to have a railway from Meskene, assuming that steamers could ever manage to reach that point. I think we may therefore accept the German di aft oi ai tide 4 ( 6 ) subject to the above sugges tions, and to the substitution of the words u not more than” for “not less than” 20 per cent. We should, however, reach a preliminary under standing with Hakki Pasha that Turkey would he willing to agree to such a percentage. Article 4 (c.)--Lord Inchcape says this clause, with one exception, is met by a provision in his draft ^ concession. The exception is that “ the granting of rebates in any form whatsoever by , ^ tie nver navigation company shall expressly be Ua* '(?■ L ■ J forbidden He maintains that soch a clause /y ,7^ ^ voiud enable Mr. Lynch to ruin the new com- ‘ ^ 1 et p ' ' S ' / dd. jjUrt, Os /mwf fa) MaMfi' Mr fadl b &lt;• J hJl~ fwFjMw L~ (r/ndvrid'unAj ' 'CvJr /nM) 1for r? / 18 m any Case lmreas °nable so ai as local traffic is concerned.

Anide 4 (d\ The India Office write u Lord Crewe would prefer that the period should be hve years, as m the British draft, since, if no arrangement is made, the prolonged existence of the Bagdad Railway Company’s rights on the river might be a disturbing element.” I think this is very true, especially in view of Mr. Lynchs connection with the transport of material for the Bagdad Railway. But I think, while making a cardinal point of a time limit, we might possibly m the last resort agree to a rather longer period than 5 years, say 6 or 7, and on the imderbtandmg that if the railway were completed befoie, the lights should of course cease # k&amp;£ss^ There is an entirely new paragraph in article 4 {d) which will be found printed in italics at the top of p. 9. The India Office write that— “ Lord Crewe sees no objection to the sub-clause in principle, if Lord Inchcape is willing to accept it.” Lord Inchcape has already accepted a similar clause in his draft concession, with slightly different wording, and with the proviso that the ferries shall only be used within the limits of the ports of Bagdad and Basra, and exclusively for the service of the railway or of the said parts. As Prince Lichnowsky intimates in his note that the Germans would not oppose a reasonable limitation in the tonnage of such craft, or a stipulation that their service should he limited to strictly local purposes, I do not think this point will give rise to any difficulty. The final sub-clause of article f (d) is identical ^ with that proposed by us. As, however, negotia tions with Mr. Lynch have taken the turn they have, I am somewhat doubtful as to the wisdom of retaining such a provision, which he might argue demonstrates the unfairness of our attitude towards him, in trying to deprive him, to the advantage of Lord Inchcape, of the benefit of a [1003—4] D8 contract he has made with the Gennan^foy 1 - conveyance of railway material. T b Trade will no doubt advise upon tins. Article 6—The India Office write « ted Crewe cannot advise Sir E. Grey to admit the German Government to any measure of lesponsi i ' “ the navigability of the Shatt-el-Arub, which is a matter entirely for the Ottoman Government. The wording ot article 5 of tire British draft should therefore be restored , but in order to get rid of article 1 (d) (see p. 10) of le German draft (the objections to which are obvious), and to meet the point made in Prince Lichnowsky’s note (see the bottom of p. 2), he would be prepared to insert in article 5 of the British draft after the words ‘ secure that the words £ the Shatt-el-Arab shall be brought into a satisfactory state of conservancy at the earliest possible date and permanently maintained in such state, in order that sea-going vessels may always he assured of free and easy access to the port of Basra; and that.’ His Majesty’s Government would ot course not commit themselves to the view that the navigable channel should he of an average depth of 20 feet.” We are consulting the Admiralty as to what is the average depth at various states of the tide ; but I think we should adopt the India Office proposal with reference to this article. Article 6, on page 9, printed in italics, is a new one, and the India Office write that it— “ is objectionable on many grounds, and from your letter of the 6th June it is understood that Sir E. Grey will not consent to the ' comite de surveillance,’ the proposal for which appears, from hrince Lichnowsky’s letter, to be based on a misconception, since the Riverain Commission will be an Ottoman body, and no nations will be represen ted thereon. But, as stated in my letter of the 9th June, Lord Crewe sees no objection to direct correspondence between the individual Consuls at Basra and the Com mission touching the matters mentioned in article 6.” Article 6 may be objectionable on many grounds, hut I have reached the definite opinion, from the conversation I had with Herr von G winner some weeks ago at the Germany Embassy, and from the remarks made by Herr von Kitblmann after his return from Berlin on I6th July, that that article or something closely resembling it is inevitable. The crux of the whole matter is that it is pioposed to subject German steamers to the payment of dues to the Commission. Now just as the ultimate decision as to whether a certain individual can borrow more money rests with thp lender, so, in a country like Turkey where the 1'I I I 'p 1 ; II S : r ** j f* * *+ ♦ * ^ • iO Article 7 (a).—I think we should urge ie Germans if possible to come to an agreemen with the Turks before we sign, so as to obvia e the necessity for this clause ; at any iute, i ie } do not conclude with the Turks soon, I think it would be well to confine ourselves to initialling the draft of an agreement and postpone the signature. Article 7 (by and (n).—These articles gibe us an opening for urging the Germans to come to a settlement with the French ak&gt;out the respective railway claims of Germany artd h ranee,, foi if France gets satisfaction in this there is reason to think, from M. Gambon s note of 9th July, that the French will meet the Germans with regard to guarantees. The French have asked us to help them by intervening at Berlin, but the Germans, while they say they would welcome our assistance if they fail to reach an agreement by direct negotiation with France, prefer to make a further attempt first at direct negotiation. I think nevertheless that these two clauses will afford a convenient means for urging a prompt settlement with France upon Germany, though in some respects France seems to be making rather wide demands. Article 8.—I agree that this article is desirable. Before taking, any further action it seems advisable to await the views of the Board of Trade. July 29, 1913. A. P.

Dear Sir Edward CONCEBNING the London, July 16, 19J 3. agreement of thf IMh Zl t ! c « lt t amed “ article 3 of the Russo-German agreement oi the 19th August, 1911, which was article 6 of the British draft has considering its general character, been made article 1. If the last sentence beginning with under and ending with “nature” could be omitted we would propose to strik! it out, as having no practical importance. If, however, His Majesty’s Government prefers to have it inserted we would agree. The second clause of article 1 corresponds to article 1 of the English draft We would prefer our wording which does not materially alter the obligations of the British Government. Clause 3 of the same article is new and intended to give to the Bagdad Railway a reasonable security against competing lines. Schemes for such competing lines which would considerably reduce, if not entirely annihilate, the economic value of the Bagdad Railway have been publicly discussed in the past, and it seems desirable to have some formal undertaking that such competing lines will not enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government in the future. Article 2 covers the same ground as article 2 of the English draft, but takes into account the fact that the proposed agreements with the Turkish Government are not yet concluded. Section (a) of article 2 corresponds to section (c) of the British draft. Section (6) reproduces verbatim the second part of section (e) of the British draft. Section (c) is analogous to section (b) of the British draft. It provides for through-traffic and protection against discrimination. The Bagdad Railway Company would after careful consideration not lay great stress on the right to participate in the construction of that line, but an undertaking of His Majesty’s Government would seem desirable that, in case the line should be built, German capital would participate in jt and be represented on the board of this line under exactly the same conditions and in the same proportion as British capital shall be represented on the board of the Bagdad Railway. These questions would be dealt with in a draft note, which is here annexed. Section (d) corresponds to section (d) of the English draft.

The draft fixes the amount of British participation to not iess than 20 per cent, of the whole share capital in order to estabhs a para e w section 4 (b) of our draft. The Bagdad Railway interests are however, prepared to let British capital have 40 per cent, in the Basra and Bagdad Port Company Article 3 P corresponds to section (a) of article 2 of the British draft As it is no an obligation of tlJ Bagdad Railway Company, but of the Imperial Govemmen , i seemed better to put it in a separate article. navigation on the Tigris Article 4 (a) deals with the proposed concession ^^two changes would and Euphrates.

We would not oppose a reasonable limitation m tonnage of sue era t, or a stipulation that their service shall be limited to strictly local purposes. . The last part of 4 (d) is similar to the last part of article 4 of the original English draft. If, instead of the words “ through British or Ottoman agency, it would be said, “by the aforesaid river navigation company,” this would not be opposed. Article 5 corresponds to article 5 of the British draft. Article 6 deals with a “ comite de surveillance ” for the interests of the nations not represented in the Shatt-el-Arab Commission. Article 7 defines conditions under which this declaration shall become operative. Clause (a) would disappear after conclusion of arrangements with the Ottoman Govern ment in case the declaration was initialled in its present form and definitely signed after the conclusion of satisfactorv arrangements between the Imperial and the Ottoman Governments. The clauses (b) and (c) relate to financial arrangements, and have been previously discussed with His Majesty’s Government. Clause (d) tries to establish some guarantee for the carrying out of the necessary works in the Shatt-el-Arab. In the opinion of our experts an average depth of 20 feet for the navigable channel up to the port of Basra ought to be attained by the time the railway between Basra and Bagdad is completed. Some stipulation of that sort seems to be quite as much in the interest of British as of German shipping. In giving up all right to an outlet on the Persian Gulf, the Imperial Government must be able to point to some reasonably definite undertaking concerning the navigable channel between the Persian Gulf and Basra. 6 Article 8 gives an arbitration clause which, in the opinion of the Imperial Govern ment, is highly desirable. i ^he question of British directors dealt with in section (c), article 2, of the British draft is dealt with m the draft of the explanatory note.

Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, t ■ oKJULUi’- . ‘fcTrt.fKr fhe Under Secretary of p tate, India Office.[This Document is the Property nf His Britanni [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL. [33602] Prince Lichnowsky to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received July 21.) (Confidential.) Dear Sir Edward , n, r London, July 16, 1913. CONG RNING the new draft of an Anglo-German declaration respecting the Bagdad railways and other cognate questions I would like to explain shortly the proposed alterations. J The undertaking similar to that contained in article 3 of the Russo-German agreement of the 19th August, 1911, which was article 6 of the British draft has, considering its general character, been made article 1. If the last sentence beginning with “ under” and ending with “ nature” could be omitted we would propose to strike it out, as having^ no practical importance. If, however, His Majesty’s Government prefers to have it inserted we would agree. The second clause of article 1 corresponds to article 1 of the English draft. We would prefer our wording which does not materially alter the obligations of the British Government. Clause 3 of the same article is new and intended to give to the Bagdad Railway a reasonable security against competing lines. Schemes for such competing lines which would considerably reduce, if not entirely annihilate, the economic value of the Bagdad Railway have been publicly discussed in the past, and it seems desirable to have some formal undertaking that such competing lines will not enjoy the support of His Majesty’s Government in the future. Article 2 covers the same ground as article 2 of the English draft, but takes into account the fact that the proposed agreements with the_Turkish Government are not yet concluded. Section (a) of article 2 corresponds to section (c) of the British draft Section (b) reproduces verbatim the second part of section (e) of the British draft. Section (c) is analogous to section (b) of the British draft. It provides for through-traffic and protection against discrimination. The Bagdad Railway Company would after careful consideration not lay great stress on the right to participate mte construction of that line, but an undertaking of His Majesty s Government would see desirable that, in case the line should be built, German capital would participate m it and be represented on the board of this line under exactly the same coH^tionsand m contemplated to give British c ^P lta t a participatiin for the Bagdad Railway Company have been induced o grant the .same^ ^ port at Bagdad, this being considere an ™P r, i a[ j Railway interests in the river facilitate an agreement about the share o = { , B it ; p participation to not less navigation company. The draft fixes the —* 0 °he r to establish a parallel with than 20 per cent, of the whole share caprtalm order ^ ed to section 4 (b )of our draft. The f a g d ^ p “^ n a Bagdad Port Company. . let British capital have 40 per cent, m ^ ^ ^ t | e Br ; t i s h draft. As it is not Article 3 corresponds to section ( ) i ul 0 f the Imperial Government, it an obligation of the Bagdad Railway Company, seemed better to put it in a separate article. . nav; tion 0 n the Tigris Article 4 (a) deals with the propose co 1913, two changes would and Euphrates, ’in the declaration imtialRd the 20^ &lt;&lt;e f „ . droit seem desirable from the German point f be orn itted, and replaced by a exclusif de la navigation h vapeur “ J f^Lburther shipping concessions on &amp; stipulation that m the MeUme onhis con^^ &amp; ioug agreeIIien t of the Ottoman Mesopotamian rivers should be grantea ^ , • ht with His Majesty’s G°iwnment ^ ^ aucun monopo l e in ar The same the words Mais san p perhaps, be left out.

In chTS s Majesty’s Government does not sign the declaration for concession of river navigation, this declaration being signed by Turkey only, the words as signatory of the aforesaid declaration” may be left out. t-&gt; n j to Section (d) corresponds to section 2, article 4, of the British draft Provisions concerning a ferry service between the railway terminus at Bagdad and the town ave been added, as well as provisions concerning small craft to he used by the railway and port companies. We would not oppose a reasonable limitation m tonnage or such craft, or a stipulation that their service shall be limited to strictly local purposes. . . The last part of 4 (d) is similar to the last part of article 4 of the original English draft. If, instead of the words “ through British or Ottoman agency,” it would be said, “by the aforesaid river navigation company,” this would not be opposed. Article 5 corresponds to article 5 of the British draft. Article 6 deals with a “ comite de surveillance ” for the interests of the nations not , represented in the Shatt-el-Arab Commission. Article 7 defines conditions under which this declaratioi) shall become operative. Clause (a) would disappear after conclusion of arrangements with the Ottoman Govern ment in case the declaration was initialled in its present form and definitely signed after the conclusion of satisfactory arrangements between the Imperial and the Ottoman Governments. The clauses (b) and (c) relate to financial arrangements, and have been previously discussed with His Majesty’s Government. Clause (d) tries to establish some guarantee for the carrying out of the necessary works in the Shatt-el-Arab. In the opinion of our experts an average depth of 20 feet for the navigable channel up to the port of Basra ought to be attained by the time the railway between Basra and Bagdad is completed. Some stipulation of that sort seems to be quite as much in the interest of British as of German shipping. In giving up all n gkt to an outlet on the Persian Gulf, the Imperial Government must be able to point to some reasonably definite undertaking concerning the navigable channel between the Persian Gulf and Basra. * 5 Article 8 gives an arbitration clause which, in the opinion of the Imperial Govern ment, is highly desirable. i d^sfion of British directors dealt with in section (c), article 2, of the British draft is dealt with in the draft of the explanatory note.

If the affairs of the National Bank of Turkey are taken over by some other British group, we shall be happy to discuss with that group suitable arrangements for handing over to them the benefits of the concession. Failing any such arrangement for handing it over to a British group, we should wish to be free to negotiate for its transfer to any other group. It seems probable, for instance, that the French group, which has interested itself in the scheme of railways to Samsoun and Trebizond, might be desirous of acquiring the concession. We should, of course, be anxious to act as far as practicable in accordance with any wishes which Sir E. Grey may have. I may add that in any arrangement for the transfer of the concession, we shall endeavour to make suitable conditions for protecting the interests of the British firm of contractors, Sir John Jackson (Limited), who have carried out the surveys and studies of the ports on our behalf, and have incurred considerable expenses on that account^ ^ to offer attractions to any British group whfob is d.isposed to the^French “ ^ilbe made on behalf of French of the existing concession, with or without modifications, in tne being exercised.

This, it seemed to me, would avoid German susceptibilities about the navigation in the region of the Persian Gulf being aroused, as far as German public opinion was concerned, before the German Government could announce that they had made an arrangement with us. As a matter of fact, the Turks could not carry out the arrangement about the Bagdad Railway with us until they had come to an agreement with Germany.

(H.) If such rates are quoted the Hamburg America Line must have the right to quote on terms as favourable as any other Company, British or foreign. I said that if importance were attached to this it might be well for the German Government to say so in their reply to us, and then they would get a written answer. Herr von Kuehlmann said that he was going to meet Herr Ballin in a day or two on the Emperor’s yacht, and as Herr Ballin would be able say a good deal to influence the Emperor it was very desirable that Herr Kuehlmann should be in a position now to state definitely what was proposed. I said the Declaration to be made by Turkey did not contain any express stipulation on this point, but under our draft agreement with Germany, article 7, unfair discrimination on the river was ruled out, and I felt sure he might be at rest, and that the wishes of Herr Ballin would be met. A copy of this memorandum has been sent to Lord Inchcape and to the Board of Trade. A. P. July 5, 1913. Ill [918] , i 1 -6 V 3 ’Property of Hi. [A] ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARAB] A CONFIDENTIAL. [30443] 2,j SECTION 2. No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. HERR y 0 N KUEHLMANN asked to see me to-day, and said he was not sure that Prince Lichnowsky had explained himself quite clearly yesterday, as His Excellency is not fully ac- qnamted with the Bagdad Railway negotiations. ie point the German Government wished to make was one which arose out of articles 9 and 10 of the Anglo-Turkish Draft Convention respecting railways (annexed). This draft had been conT- municated by His Majesty’s Government to the German Government, and with regard to article 9 the Bagdad Railway Company had said that it was ultra vires for the Turkish Government to “ s’engager a veiller” as to directors of British nationality, and the German Government wanted to suggest quite unofficially that the words “ will nse their best endeavours ” might be better. With regard to article 10, the German Govern ment thought it would create a bad impression in Germany if the Turkish Government were to abandon a German existing right before coming to terms with the Germans first. I said that here was a misunderstanding. I drew his attention to the Declaration annexed to the draft convention, and said it was our idea that the two documents should be signed simul taneously ; but it was obviously impossible for the Turks to sign the Declaration until they had first come to an agreement with the Bagdad Railway Company, as otherwise the Declaration would be untrue. He agreed, and said he had already explained this at Berlin, but he just wished to confirm his own impression. He added that the Bagdad Railway Company were quite ready to agree with the Turks on the point in question. He then said that he hoped the suggested agreement between England and Germany would soon be completed; the whole matter was being examined in Berlin ££ with sympathy , Heir von Gwinner had promised Herr von Kuehlmann that he would do his best to further it, and Hen von Knehlmann had been commanded to go on a cruise with the Emperor 'on the 8th July, when B [2985 6—2]2 I IVI Herr Ballin of the Hamburg-America Line won also be present, and he^ hoped a satisfactory arrangement about shipping dues, &amp;c., on t e Shatt-el-Arab would be the result, and that our proposals about the Shatt-el-Arab would be accepted so far as Germany was concerned, subject only to one or two points of detail. I then said that I had noticed in the “ Times ” of the 2nd July a telegram from Berlin giving an answer of Herr von Jagow to a parliamentary question about Germany s reported renunciation of shipping rights on the River ligris. He said the answer was a purely “ technical one intended to keep public opinion quiet while nego tiations were in progress, and that the question was no doubt due to a mischievous article by Herr Said Ruete, which had appeared in the “ Berliner Zeitung am Mittag,” and which made out that Germany was surrendering her “ birth right ” of navigation on the Tigris. He said the article bore a close resemblance to views which Mr. Lynch had often proclaimed, and he asked me if I suspected it might have been inspired from that quarter. I replied that I did not know, but that it was important to bear in mind that Mr. Lynch was a private individual, and that no statement he made in regard to the Bagdad Railway negotiations represented any official view. Herr von Kuehlmann then said that he was very anxious to be able to furnish replies which might be useful in Berlin in case of criticism about the navigation of the Tigris, and Germany’s attitude. He understood that we claimed special rights by reason of ancient firmans and long- established usage, and he said he would be glad if I could give him any information on the subject. 1 said we certainly had very definite claims and rights, but he agreed that it would be better for him to speak on the subject to Sir L. Mallet first. If it would serve any useful purpose (which I think perhaps it might) I could draw up a wide statement of our claims, showing what they are based upon, and how the proposed new concession is really a compromise, and the least we could accept.

The best thing Herr von Gwinner could do would be to mge conciliation upon the National Bank of Turkey.

Berlin, June 6, 1913. 11IE German press has followed with interest, bordering upon suspicion, the reported course of the negotiations between His Majesty’s Government and the lurkish Government m regard to the Bagdad Railway and other questions. An article appeared recently over the signature of Dr. Paul Rohrbach which contained various statements alleged to have been derived from a Turkish source in regard to the negotiations. . According to this article the convention negotiated by Hakki Pasha contained besides the provisions already published relative to Koweit/the Bagdad Railway, &amp;c.’ the following concessions made by Great Britain : — 1. England agrees to guarantee to Turkey for forty years the integrity of her present territory. 2. England agrees to afford diplomatic support to the Turkish Government in the peace negotiations, and at once to bring pressure to bear on the allies with a view to hastening the conclusion of peace. 3. England agrees to assist in the financial liquidation of the war. 4. England agrees to render similar assistance in the regulation of the question of the possession of the islands on the coast of Asia Minor. 5. In the event of a declaration of complete independence on the part of Albania, England agrees to support the nomination of a Mohammedan ruler, but otherwise to favour the principle of Ottoman suzerainty over Albania. On her part Turkey is alleged to undertake :— 1. In the Bagdad question, to aim at the greatest possible advantages for England, especially as regards the section Bagdad-Basra. 2. To grant special privileges to British subjects in Southern Arabia where British economic interests exist. 3. To introduce without delay the necessary reforms in Armenia, Kurdistan, Syria, and Mesopotamia. . ^ T r 4. To leave to England a completely free hand in the Sultanate of Koweit. 5. To settle the pending frontier disputes with Persia in favour of the latter G.^To meet the wishes of the Arabian tribes in regard to autonomy. In commenting on this article the “ Frankfurter Zeitung ” said, in a recent issue, that if the statements contained therein were true the agreement was more far-reachino- and of greater significance for the future o Turkey than had hitherto been surmosed implying as Dr. Rohrbach asserted that it did, the abandonment by T ur 7hC posZn hf’ Arabia, and the recognition of a British protectorate over the Frankfurter Zeitung” went on to observe that it was a matter of great importance, both for the integrity o A ^ of ? first y or per haps sole, adviser in know how far Engiand aimed at pky g th^ ^ would dep P nd whether Germany the administrative reform of Asia ^ , « mort g a o- e ” on Arabia, and whether could declare her concurrence m sue .

THE articles the following:— of the Capitulations which refer to the levy of customs duties are Article 34. Trade vnth Aleppo, Egypt, &amp;c. — Duty of 3 per cent, to be paid. That the English merchants, and other subjects of that nation, shall and may according to then^ condition, trade at Aleppo, Egypt, and other ports of our sacred dominions, on paying (according to ancient custom) a duty of 3 per cent, on all their merchandise, without being bound to the disbursement of an asper more. Article 54. Duty on landing of Goods to be 3 per cent. That the English merchants having once paid the duties on their merchandise, at the rate of 3 per cent., and taken them out of their ship, no one shall demand or exact from them anything more without their consent: and it was moreover- expressly commanded that the English merchants should not be molested or vexed in manner aforesaid, contrary to the articles of the Capitulations. Article 57. Uniform Duty of 3 per cent, on Goods Imported in British Ships, That notwithstanding it is stipulated by the Capitulations (articles 34 and 54) that the English merchants, and other subjects of that nation, shall and may, according to their rank and condition, trade to Aleppo, Egypt, and other parts of our Imperial dominions, and for all their goods, wares, and merchandise, pay a duty of 3 per cent, only, and nothing more, according to ancient custom, the customers having molested the English merchants, with a view to oppress them and the subjects of that nation on their arrival with their goods laden on board their ships, whether conveyed by sea or land, at our ports and harbours, under pretence of the goods so brought by them not belonging to the English; and that for goods brought from England they demanded 3 per cent, only; but for those brought by them from \ enice and other nnrts they exacted more: wherefore, on this point, let the Imperial Capitulations granted in former times be observed, and our Governors and officers m no wise permit or consent to the same being infringed. Article 67. Duty of 3 per cent, on all Goods Imported and Exported.

In the course of his reply, Lord Dufierin informed Aarifi Pasha that “the older treaties and Capitulations into which the Treaty of 1861 imported temporary modifications are still extant and in force, and that the liberty of action which your Highness seems inclined to claim for the Porte with respect to the imposition of duties on English goods at the expiration of^ the Convention would necessarily be limited by their provisions.” (Lord Dufferin, No. 3, Commercial, January 11, loo4.) In his reply Aarifi Pasha denied the correctness of this view in the following terms:— “ Suivant un principe des plus elementaires du droit international, aussitot que les dispositions d’un traite, que celui-ce soit conclu ou non, sont modifiees d’un commun accord par les clauses d’un acte subsequent, elles cessent d’etre en vigueur pour jamais sans pouvoir revivre a 1’expiration de 1’acte subsequent.” (Lord Dufferin, No. 45, Commercial, March 7, 1884.) In his reply to Aarifi Pasha, Lord Dufferin, following Lord Granville’s instructions, stated that— “ the question raised in your Highness’s note is one which Her Majesty’s Government are not disposed to discuss for the present, as it goes to the root of the relations between the Porte and foreign Powers, and affects all those Powers alike. I am, however, instructed to^ state to your Llighness that, in the opinion of Her Majesty’s Government, the Capitulations are perpetual in their nature and character, though temporarily suspended from time to time in certain respects by the provisions of tieaties of limited duration dealing with particular matters. , ,i the event of such treaties not being renewed at their expiration, the operation 2 . eir u a 10ns r ® vives as regards matters dealt with by the lapsed treaties, and i is scarce y necessary oi me to add that the right of Her Majesty’s Government to ZThJn°Z e r -jHri 1C)n ^ re ^ m i eil L at all times and in all matters, is one which has never (Lord DuffeXS “I, ^ t0 relin&lt;1UiSh ’’ Eussia^C^mmCTdal’rreaty o^lMS^L^Tiirk 1 ' ? 0 p ernment &gt; on the expiration of the line of argument Thp Pnco’ n’ C Turkish Government put forward the same their Capitulations.

In discussino- thi article Mr. de Bunsen said :— Turkey is not likely to accept the words in question. She is for ever endeavouring to obtain recognition of her theory that the ancient treaties are dead, though they can be revived for a time by a special stipulation of a new treaty. Our theory, on the other hand, is that the ancient treaties are immortal, that they can only be modified by a new treaty and for the time of its duration, and that they revive in their entirety when the new treaty expires.” As a result the new form of article 1 was adopted by His Majesty’s Government, which seems to have practically the same force as the corresponding articles 1 of the Treaties of 1838 and 18(&gt;1. But in article 28 of the new draft—article 29 of the previous draft—-the following- paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 were inserted :— “ Un an avant Texpiration de la septieme et quatorzieme annee, chacune des hautes parties contractantes aura la faculte de notifier a Tautre si elle a Tintention de reviser ce traite afin d’y introduire d’un commun accord certaines modifications demontrees necessaires par Texperience. “Dans le cas on cette modification ou cet accord n’aurait pas eu lieu, il demeure entendu que le traite existant continuera a rester en vigueur. “ II est entendu que la clause 3 de cet article ne_ privera aucune des hautes parties contractantes des droits qui pourraient lui etre acquis au moment de la signature du present traite.” In transmitting this draft to Sir X. O’Conor for eventual communication to the Turkish delegates, Lord Lansdowne wished Sir H. 0 Conor to consider whet er the last paragraph could not be omitted as the rights of Great Bn|m under the Capitulations appeared to be fully secured by the terms of article 1.

Work on the harbour was commenced in the autumn of ]900 and pushed on so rapidly that it was possible to open it on the 14th April, 1903. The land for the harbour was reclaimed from the sea by filling up with earth, while the actual basin was formed by a breakwater 600 metres in length, with two light towers, and by two quays, 150 and 300 metres in length, meeting at right angles. The depth of the basin is from 7'5 to 8 metres, according to the state of the tide. The dues leviable for the use of the harbour are laid down in the concession and set forth in a maximum tariff*annexed to the concession. According to article 14 of the “ cahier des charges ” the various items of the maximum tariff can only be raised with the consent of the Turkish Government, but the company is entitled to levy lower dues of its own accord, and they have made use of this right. Any differential treatment of the ships, goods, and persons using the harbour is impossible under the concession, and has never occurred. The fully paid-up shares of the Haidar-Pascha Harbour Company, amounting to 8,000,000 fr., are held by the Anatolian Railway Company, Constantinople, and the Rank for Oriental Railways, Zurich, while 5 per cent, bonds, also amounting to 8,000,000 fr., and issued under the guarantee of the Anatolian Railway Company, are held by the German public.

I TOLD M. von Gwinner that the Foreign Office had expressed a wish that 1 should enter into negotiation with him with regard to the arrangements for a British representation in the Bagdad Railway, and other kindred matters. I was unable actually to negotiate, because circumstances had rendered it improbable that the National Bank of Turkey or the group connected with it would be prepared to take the matter up. It might, however, help on matters if M. von Gwinner would explain what he proposed, and I should be happy to discuss the proposals so far as was possible in the circumstances I had stated. If the National Bank did not proceed with the matter, any other arrangements that the Foreign Office might contemplate would probably be facilitated by such a discussion. M. von Gwinner then explained the position. The Bagdad Railway Company has a capital of about 600,000b Of this, one-half subscribed in cash by the shareholders, the other 50 per cent, being paid up, on their behalf, out of the profits on the construction of the first section of the railway. The money thus remained in the treasury of the company, the shareholders getting their benefit in shares, nothin cash. It was proposed now to increase the capital from 600,000b to 900,000b XJ ’'' suggestion was that a British group coming in now should take 10 per cent, of total capital (90,000/.) to be paid for in cash at par. I pointed out that subscribers on this basis would pay for the shares at then iu nominal value, while the original shareholders had paid only one-half of that value M. von Gwinner justified this, on the ground that persons entering now could not equitably claim to benefit from profits realised before they had taken any risk m the “^The construction of the line, he explained, is carried out by a construction company with a capital of 200,0001. This construction ca ™d certfto shin for the Bagdad Company at actual cost, plus 10 Percent. Bagdad percentages to the director of the work, c c. t r UC ti 0 n company.

Moreover, they were they would be only half as well off « of the third series of bonds, expected to share the responsm i &gt; P ‘ | to repaying advances for construction, whereas the proceeds would be appbed in pal t to repay &amp; prospect Sftrss ».» taken over viz 82 was an impossible one under present circumstances. M vbn Gwinner was inclined to think that some arrangement might have to be made for allowing the new entrants to share m any profits of construction u tim y naid for out of the proceeds of bonds which they helped to place. He defended the other inequality on the ground that a new entrant had no e aim to share in profits already realised. I pointed out, however, that those profits arose from the fact that the first section happened to he an easy one, and also,_ that the cost ! of construction at that time was low. It had always, I understood, been intended t lat these profits would provide for the more expensive sections and for possible increase in cost of labour or materials. _ _ . . I suggested that if British capital joined, some of the construction ought to be done by British agency or with British materials. M. von G winner explained that, as regards contractors, the only profit of Messrs. Holzmann arose from their shaie in the construction company, and that, as regards materials, they had always been ready to buy in the cheapest market. They had bought rails in Belgium, and even in Russia. I then mentioned the question of the ports of Basra and Bagdad. M. von Gwinner said that he proposed that a British group should take a share of 40 per cent, in the company to he formed for constructing and working the port of Basra. This, he understood, would he dealt with by Lord Inchcape in connection with the navigation company, and he believed that Lord Inchcape was quite content with 40 per cent. I said that I understoood the question of the ports included Bagdad as well as Basra. The Bagdad Railway concession permitted the railway company to construct wharves, warehouses, and other installations for a port on the Tigris at Bagdad, but gave them no monopoly. Similar arrangements would no doubt be required for the navigation. There would be obvious economy in joining forces. The port arrange ments at Bagdad appeared to me to be of greater importance to the navigation enterprise than the port arrangements at Basra, since Bagdad would be tbeir terminus, and the arrangements for warehousing goods there, and also for transhipment between i ail and nvei in both directions, were matters which might be of very great importance to them. If the railway had control of these arrangements, they might clearly he wor md to tire advantage of the railway and to the detriment of the navigation. hr n . ®T V e i mi way anu to me detriment oi tire navigation. , 1 .‘TT 1 TT 11 ® 1 ' aclmitt f d ^at this might he a matter of interest to the navigation, but said that he had not understood from the Foreign Office that this Question was raised on behalf of that enterprise. __ ^ — lyl' t ^ l!l ^ ii klPT-'’ 616 1° worked jointly for the common interest, it 40 per cent ^ dlV ‘ S10n sWd be half -™d-half, and not 60 per cent, and M. von G winner took note of what I said on thh could not nenoLTfoLr “dL 1 ^ at 1 SaW on this P oi]lt . bnt we agreed that, as I M. von Gwinner rnpnti^ staudm g^ w e could not carry the matter further, cost some 300 000Z He riq] 10 a - tle P 01 '!‘arrangements at Basra would probably Bagdad d n0t glVG an y estimate of the cost of the arrangements at entioned also that the Bagdad Company is at present endeavouring to obtain3 fructioi tlieir o take a hviu ceofi re to t)e ^al wi| pTrtr^fpfre^ »TreTT eHher “ ~ ° f have to be taken over the change in Turkish credltVaTing obXuslylenfeed&amp;e ^modification oAhe will• C ° ntraCt Un8Uitable ' ^ are als ° endeavouVng t obt^n ^ modification of the working expenses guarantee, in order to remove the objection that, m its present form, it makes it to the railway’s interest to discourage traffic June 16, 1913.

Herr von Kuhlmann asked whether we should be prepared to give Sir E. Cassel a hint to this effect if the proposed arrangement as to the two British Directors were concluded. I said I would enquire. (Initialled) H.M.'WWW. Q MINUTE BY MR. PARKER. ‘No. 26928. I HAD to see Sir H, Babington-Smith to-day about the Bagdad Railway, and I took the opportunity to touch in quite a general way on some of the points of his letter of the 11th June, as to which I was not clear. As to the first three paragraphs (numbered) I think that they contain an entirely accurate statement of the position. Paragraph 4 indicates that the disasters which have overtaken Turkey, and the little hope there is that effective control over Turkish finance can be established, almost preclude the possibility of sound finance in Turkey, at all events from the investor’s standpoint. This is, to my mind, the most important para graph in the whole letter. If British financiers cannot be induced to take part in financing Turkey it will mean either the increase of foreign influence, and consequently the loss of orders to British trade, or an acceleration in the collapse of Turkey. The question therefore arises whether we cannot induce all the Powers to insist on some form of effective financial control in Turkey, and to so insist by inducing their respective financial houses to withhold financial assistance in the absence of such effective control. But even assuming such financial control to be practicable, I am very doubtful, from the language of Sir H. Babington-Smith, if the National Bank would continue operations in Turkey, since they .consider, so I understand, that, apart from the present monetary stringency, there is little hope ■of Turkey’s regeneration, and there are more profitable fields for investment in other parts of the world. It seems clear that Turkey is moie likely to give concessions to those countries who help her financially than to those who do not; and as it is desirable that we should get as many concessions [848] B 4 cOl 1 rt 12 as we can, especially in MesopotamiMl*^ a P r im a facie argument in “ of eneoura^ g the National Bank to stay m Turkey, another matter how far His Majesty’s would be prepared to go in incurring of this nature. In the absence of such encou meat it is, I think, pretty clear that the ^ Bank will not go on, despite the prospect o obtaining concessions and contracts, say o irrigation, in Mesopotamia, and all the potent wealth of that region which may eventually become the British sphere of influence in lur ey. I venture to think that it would be of very great advantage to our prestige and to our material interests in Turkey if we could keep the National Bank in existence. I now pass to paragraph 5. The National Bank have I think, themselves partly though perhaps not entirely, to blame for our want of . support in certain directions. E.g., with regard to oil in Mesopotamia, they did not seem to me to have taken sufficient, steps to inform themselves as to the existing position, and whether there were other narties* interested, before coming to. terms with the Shell. But Sir H. Babington Smith tells me that for two years or so previously to last autumn Mr. D’Arcy had had no agent at Constantinople and. he (Sir H. B. Smith) had no reason to suppose that Mr. D’Arcy was interested in the matter. Sir Henry further told me that he had, over and over again, discussed the position in conversation with Sir G. Lowther and kept him au courant of what he was doing. He added confidentially that it had happened to him more than once in conversation with Sir G. Lowther that when he (Sir H. Babington-Smith) was just coming to the important point, it had become apparent from some irrelevant remark of Sir G. Lowther’s that His Excellency had failed to appreciate the essentials of the conversation, and Sir H. Babington-Smith could only conclude that Sir G. Lowther had failed for some inexplicable reason to report to Sir E. Grey what he had been told in order precisely that the Foreign Office, might know what was going on. The Bank had wished to act loyally by us and to keep us informed; but they had not met with the same treatment of confidence in return, at least sucb was their impression. As to paragraph 6, the Library have supplied to me the following statement:—-3 tVen in oommunic^tion with thp K, t r Cassel '™ 8 privately that Sir E. Grey had 33592, taking nlaoTbeHveen F^ h l ‘ tfOV ®™ment respecting the financial negotiations then File 1S3. ch,. F® 1 lance and lurkey, and had expressed his full concurrence in the desire of « h ? me f S T tl r e develo P ment 0f the COTmtr -y on progressive lines, as well as the institution of proper financial reforms and control, and the allocation of satisfactory security for any further advances made m t rance: That he understood that the French Government did not desire, as had been asserted in lurkey, to establish a French control: That the French Govern ment believed that the military party in Turkey, which, as Sir E. Gassel knew, was extremely powerful, (lesiied to obtain as much money as possible for the army regardless of the necessity for economy and for expenditure in other departments: That they were a little anxious lest the JL uik^sh Government should obtain mods from other quarters on less binding terms 5 and that fen It. Giey felt that, aftei having concurred in the course adopted by tho f rench Government, it would be awkward if the lurks were to obtain an advance in England in place of the French loam feir E. Cassel replied that Sir F. Bertie might state to the French Government that he did not propose to follow up the loan matter if in the course of the negotiations with the Turks they refused conditions which were found to be reasonable and proper by the Foreign Office, Sir F. Bertie reported that M. Pichon appeared to be much gratified to hear that Sir E. Cassel would not conclude a loan with the Turkish Government without the approval of His Majesty’s Government. In forwarding a memorandum dated the 4th October, 1910, by Sir E, Cassel and himself, on ,36808 the negotiations, Sir H. Babington-Smith said:— 34391. 35203. “ I trust that this statement will be found to show that the National Bank of Turkey, while •endeavouring to assist the Ottoman Government in difficult situations, has throughout been guided by the desire to act in conformity with the views of the British Government, and to carry •out, in accordance with those views, the purposes for which the Bank was called into existence,” In reply Sir E. Cassel was informed that Sir E. Grey had pleasure in stating that, to the best of his knowledge, the above claim was thoroughly justified. G. E. P. HERTSLET. Foreign Office, June 13, 1913. Paragraph 7.—I told Sir. H. Babington-Smith that I could not quite appreciate his grievance with regard to the Bagdad Bail way. I said that we had; it was true, abandoned as impracticable all claim to control the southern section of the line, but it had always seemed to me that the real lever for securing advantageous terms in the Bagdad Bailway was financial. Herr von Gwinner really wanted access to the London money market, and the aim of our present negotiations had been to enable His Majesty’s Government to abandon their attitude of opposition to the railway, which was only possible if certain conditions, e.g. that the terminus should be at Bussorah, should be fulfilled. When His Majesty’s Government no longer opposed the Bagdad Bail way British in vestors would have no patriotic reason for refusing to invest in it; and surely, I suggested, there could be few more favourable moments than the present, when the market is glutted with new issues, for extorting from Herr Gwinner favourable terms for promises of financial assistance. If the National Bank were to undertake the business, they could perhaps stipulate that large oiders for parts of the line and rolling stock should be placed in England. Sir H. B ibington-Smith said that, owing to the situation in Turkey, the Bagdad Bailway had become far less attractive as am investment, but this again depended upon4 whether the P^ers would establish effective :'' 1 1 h, Turkey, and he had told Herr Gwinner as much. Paragraph 8.-Sir L. Mallet has already ex plained, in a letter written to S.r H, B. Sm J the 13th June, why we did not place h™ in possession of the facts about the Bagdad Radvva before, so that he could discuss the subject with Herr Gwinner earlier in the week. Paragraph 9.-I do not think the argument quite holds water that as His Majesty s Govern ment stipulated for the river concession as one condition of ceasing to oppose the Bagdad Rai - way, and as the National Bank had been promised the British share in any part of the Bagdad Railway allotted to us, therefore the National Bank should have been invited to take the lead in dealing v ith of our opposition to the railway does not debai British participation in it, it facilitates it. In the I second place there is some doubt whether the- intervention of a Bank m the river business is really essential. It is true that amongst the many firms which from time to time have shown an interest in the river question, with a view to participation in the navigation, we overlooked the National Bank. But I still think Lord Inchcape and the British India Company were the right concessionnaires to select, though we have tried to associate the National Bank with the proposed new Companv in such a measure as would not interfere with Lord Inchcape’s control. Sir H. Babington-Sm.ith writes “when I came to discuss the question with Lord Inchcape, I found .... that he had derived the impression, from his communications with the Board of Trade, that the Government did not really desire the National Bank of Turkey to take part in the business at all.” I think there is probably some misconception, here : the new navigation concession is peculiarly difficult to arrange, because it is imperative to secure two objects if possible : firstly the mainten ance of control in the hands of Lord Inchcape, the concessionaire, and secondly fair recognition of Mi. Lynch s claims as the pioneer of river navi gation. The puzzle is to reconcile participation of the National Bank with these two desiderata. It is now uncertain if the National Bank will- continue operations in Turkey, and if they still want to come into the navigation concession even if they discontinue other operations.5 Assuming they do, then possibly they can be given the option, as a Turkish institution and by arrange ment with the Turks, to acquire a large portion of the Turkish holding (which is 50 per cent, of the whole) and a certain proportion of the British holding. They might thus have even a larger holding than Lord Inchcape himself, who, so I understand, could none the less retain control, if there is a provision in the statutes that the directors representing the British half of the Company must vote “ en bloc.” As the Chairman is always to be British with a casting vote, Lord Inchcape or his nominee would thus retain control over the whole enterprise. The National Bank evidently aspired to holding, in regard to Turkish finance, much the same position towards His Majesty’s Government as the Deutsche Bank hold towards the German Government; and I think their soreness is due largely to the fact that they were not so consulted in this as in other instances. Certainly the Deutsche Bank has been the means by which Germans have secured valuable concessions in Turkey, where finance and politics are even more closely connected than elsewhere. Pavagraph 10.—The facts are substantially as stated. We consulted the French Government before acting because w 7 e thought that a joint representation wmuld have more effect, and a common line of argument carry more weight. We .found they had already acted and had received an unsatisfactory reply. What would have been the point of sending in a note which would have received a similar reply ? It seemed better to hear what the French Government thought of the Greek reply and offer to join them in then next representation. This we have done. I do not see what the Bank lose by the line we have taken or what they would have gained had we acted otherwise. Paragraph 11 .— Sir H. Bahington-Smith writes : “ As you are aware, I kept the Embassy at Con stantinople informed of our intentions; and w r e were given no reason to suppose that the attitude of the Foreign Office towards the proposed com bination would be unfavourable. At the last moment we were informed that the support of the Foreign Office was already promised to another group!” I have not had time to go carefully through the correspondence yet with a view to establishing how far we were kept posted by the [848]6 Embassy as to the activity of the National Bank m regard to Mesopotamian oU My imptessmn,^ case tnc , - i Mr. IVArcy, -whom we had previously snppoi Sir E Grey did suggest, in the autumns a com bination to Sit. H. Babington-Smith: but the terms of combination he proposed did not tuliii the conditions and requirements of His Majesty s Government, and Sir H. Babington-Smith was then informed to this effect by Sir E. Giey. The question of an amalgamation which will secure British control, and protect the position of the original British claimant, is now the subject of active negotiation? in which .the Board of Trade are taking an important part. I know of no , ground for. the suggestion that either the Foreign Office or the Embassy regard the National Bank as not being completely j British in character, but Sir H. Babington-Smith, while admitting that statements made on this subject, so far as the Foreign Office is concerned, are, he hopes and believes, exaggerated, urges that such statements ..could never have arisen if the attitude of the Government towards the Bank had been, such as to demonstrate their Our attitude with regard to the National Bank oil combine has been that Sir H. Babin ston- Smith did not take adequate steps, before com mitting himself, to ascertain the views of His Majesty's Government: his contention is that he did keep the Embassy fully informed, and that they failed to report. On other matters I do not think we have treated the National Bank with hostility, and I do not believe the accusation will bear examination. Paragraph 12.—I believe that it is absolutely necessary, if we are to prevent the break up of Turkey in Asia, that we, in conjunction with other European Powers, should afford her financial assistance. I think that the continuance of the National Bank in turkey is almost a sine qua non of our being able to do this effectively. That bank represents a British group of financiers of the highest standing, and Sir H. Babington- Smith, .owing both to his services as British falsity.? Representative on the Ottoman Debt and to his recent residence in Turkey, has unrivalled know ledge in regard to Turkish finance, and would be of great use in advising His Majesty’s Govern ment in a practical manner how, and subject to What safeguards, we can put Turkey on her feet again financially. For this reason it seems to me that there is a strong case for inducing the National Bank to ■stay in Turkey. As regards British enterprises, his impression, so I understand, is that the only way in which we can in future get a fair share in the economic development of Turkey is by co-operation with Germany : the whole tendency of the French in Turkey is to secure a monopoly in finance, and through finance, in public -contracts and con cessions. Such is the power of the Banks in Turkey that they can secure special treatment for their nationals in industrial orders and under takings. For these reasons I think it is of cardinal importance that we should see how far it is possible to meet the National Bank, both as to financial control in Turkey and in other ways, and whether by so doing they can he induced to continue operations in Turkey.

National Bank of Turkey, 50, Cornhill, London, Dear Sir Edwara Grey, _ June 11, 1913. ■» CIRCUMSTANCES have arisen which make it necessary to consider the position and future policy of the National Bank of Turkey, and it becomes my duty to lay the whole matter before you. 2,The National Bank was founded with }our strong encouragement, on the ground, as you stated, that the prospects of the regeneration of Turkey and the progress of British interests there, depended on the establishment in Constantinople of British finance of the first rank. You added that it would be a severe blow to the whole of the Government’s policy in the Near East if you were obliged to tell the Turks that British financiers would take no interest in Turkish attairs, and the request ol the Turks for the establishment of a bank could not be complied with. Such a reply, you considered, would diminish irremediabl} 7 British prestige and influence at Constan tinople, on which the future progress of British trade in the Turkish dominions depended so much. I accepted the presidency of the bank, at the wish of the Govern ment, and because it was urged upon me that it was important in the public interest that I should do so. _ . . . » From the beginnino- we had little expectation that ordinary banking business m Turkey could offer any field for the bank’s activities. The ground was already fully covered, and little disposition is shown on the part of British mercantile_ interests to extend their operations in Turkey. Our view, and, as we believe, the view ol the Government, was that the bank would occupy itself with questions of Governmeii finance, of public works, of railways and other means of communication, of mdustnal enterprises, and, generally, with schemes for utilising and developing the resources of ^.ThfsTcess of the bank in attaining the object for T^LInk^d partly on the course of events in Turkey.

As a compensation, in some sense, for their support to the (xerman lailway enter- prife, or, at least, for the withdrawal of opposition, His Majesty’s Government is stipulating for the concession to a company under British control of the monopoly of navigation on the Tigris and Euphrates. We first became aware that negotiations of this nature were approaching completion from announcements in the press, and we then found that the arrangements for dealing with the proposed concession were almost completed with the chairman of the British India Steam Navigation Company. I readily acknowledge that you replied to representations on my part by placing me in communication with Lord Inchcape with a view to associating the National Bank with the business; but, when I came to discuss the question with him, I found that he was not prepared to contemplate anything more than a very small participation on the part of the bank, and that he had derived the impression, from his communications with the Board of Trade, that the Government did not really desire the National Bank of Turkey to take part in the business at all. I venture to submit that we were entitled to expect that, when the Government were framing their scheme for carrying out the proposed concession, we should have been taken into consultation and should have been invited to take the lead in dealing with the business, in accordance, of course, with the views of the Government and m association with such others as they might desire. Instead ol this, we are left to hear of the scheme accidentally, to sue for admittance and to be met with the reply that we are not wanted. .■.In the case of the recent default of the Ottoman Government in respect of certain leasmy i s we a ressed the Foreign Office on the 18th February, immediately after p e r&lt; ? , e a,U - ’ d n Ihe 19th March, after the second default, with a request for assistance m the shape of a communication to the Governments of the allied States, r p CeiV1 WG a P 0rtl0n tho assigned revenues.

The conclusion to which we have been unwillingly forced is that our conception of the position which the bank was intended to 0CC , u Py ™ “elation to the British Government and its economic policy in Turkey is widely different from the position which has in fact been assigned to it. The impression has been produced m the minds of our competitors and of the Ottoman Government that we are not trusted by the _ British Government or regarded as the appropriate agency for taking the lead in British enterprises, and that no importance is attached by you to the part which we believed you wished us to take in Turkish finance. Under these circumstances there is only one course to be followed. We propose, at the first suitable opportunity, to relieve ourselves of a task which we cannot, in the conditions I have stated, satisfactorily perform. If there is any British establishment or group which would enjoy your confidence, and to which you would desire to entrust the business, we shall be happy to enter into communication with them. Failing that, we must consider our hands free either to wind up the affairs of the bank or to dispose of its business. There are certain matters connected with the Treasury bills and other questions which we should desire to see settled before making any alteration in the position of the bank ; but, subject to these considerations, we desire to take action in the direction indicated at as early a date as may be practicable.

M M [ 26266 ] No. 1. Minute by Mr. Parker. ITH Sir L. Mallet’s approval I went to the German Embassy to-day to meet Herr von G winner. There were present Prince Lichnowsky, Herr von Ivnehlmann, and Herr Gwinner. Herr Gwinner said that he had made a few notes respecting the negotiations with Germany, and he would like to read them, making com ments on each point. As regards the Bagdad Railway, he was, he said, quite satisfied with the proposed settle ment. I said I was glad to hear this, which I could well understand, since in effect the sug gested settlement left him in sole possession of all in the concession which was commercially valuable, while at the same time opening to him the London money market. He then said that the Grand Vizier had com municated to him a copy of our draft Convention with Turkey about railways ; that he had read the document with interest, especially article 9, which laid down that the Ottoman Government would “ veiller ” as to the appointment of two British directors on the Board of the Bagdad Railway. He said he was perfectly ready that this article should remain pour les beaux yeux du public ” ; but he thought it well to point out that in point of law it would be ultra vires for the Ottoman Government to enforce their obligation to “ veiller,” as nobody but the shareholders of the Bagdad Railway Company could elect directors. He was, however, prepared to over come this difficulty if there was a single English shareholder with only a small holding in the Company, as he (Herr Gwinner) could control sufficient votes to ensure the election of the British directors. He then entered on a ong technical argument on the point, and I asked him for a statement in writing, for the information o the Board of Trade. This, I believe, Herr Kuehlmann will send. He'then said that if a line ever were made from Basra to the Persian Galf, the Germans r&gt;2 21 Q. 0 IjLO'I&gt; • ixi-J-• - LJ t 7 — existing agreement with the Bagdad Railway Company for the conveyance of building material, and Herr Gwinner said it would be impossible for him to escape from his obligations with Mr. Lynch under that contract, which was a very advantageous one for Mr. Lynch who, besides the emoluments of management, received a net profit of 12 per cent. I said that the contract in question only related to the conveyance of material for the Bagdad Railway while m progress of construction, and that when construction was completed both the need for conveying materials, and the navigation rights of the Bagdad Railway Company under article 9 of their Convention, would cease to exist. Herr Gwinner and Prince Lichnowsky then said that this brought them to a further point: they understood that we and the Turks secured a virtual monopoly in regard to navigation on the Tigris, and that this would give rise to much criticism in Germany, for it contrasted unfavour ably with the German position respecting the Bagdad Railway, where foreign participation was welcomed. They hoped we would not object to the Hamburg-America Line having, say, 5 per cent, or 10 per cent, participation in the naviga tion company if they could arrange for holding part of the Turkish share. (As a matter of fact I understand that the Board of Tiade aie not altogether opposed to this, but I thought it well to be reserved.) I said that the navigation concession was in reality a fleeting possession; the future of Mesopotamia depended on irrigation, and when irrigation came the rivers would cease to be navigable. I therefore thought the Hamburg-3 America line would find the enterprise a poor nvestment. But, apart from this, we had been intimately connected with navigation of the Mesopotamian rivers since the reign of Queen lizabeth, we had rendered great services on t e rivers to Turkey in past centuries, and we had a special and sentimental interest in this enter- prize. Oui arrangement with Turkey really was a compromise, and if there was to he foreign participation it would lose much of its value to ns. We had abandoned, or rather were prepared to abandon, all claim to participate in and effectually control the Bagdad-Basra section of the Bagdad Railway, and therefore it was im portant for us to have the river navigation in our hands. Herr Gwinner said that all they wanted was a minor participation in the river navigation, so as to prevent opposition from an influential quarter, the Hamburg-America line. I said that the settlement should surely be viewed as a whole, and the Germans, so it appeared, gained far more than they gave. The point was dropped; and then Prince Lichnowsky and Herr Gwinner referred to the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Commission. They said that as Germany had such a large shipping interest that it was only fair that she should be represented on the Commission. I said that the Commission was an Ottoman one, and that we were asked to appoint someone to act under the Ottoman Government, just as the Ottoman Government asked other foreign Powers to appoint advisers to improve their institutions—a German for instance to reform the army. The Shatt-el-Arab, although open to the ships of all nations, was, as regards the whole waterway, a Turkish river. We, however, had long been associated with the river, both in regard to buoying and surveying, and putting down piracy, and we were closely concerned with the de facto interests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah on the river. It was absolutely necessary for us to be connected with the Commission, as otherwise it would be next to impossible to ensure peace on the river, or to secure that the bar would be properly watched, and impediments to navigation removed. If the Germans claimed representation every other nation would do likewise, and the Commission would cease to be Ottoman and become international. But our arrangements [2950 2—1] B 2'i : f ! iri with Turkey provided for absolute equality of treatment for the ships of all nation^ “d—I accounts would be published to would be no discrimination, hvery rea German shipping interest would be secured y mission, but the conditions were such that would be impossible locally to institute an inter national Commission without great and probably insuperable difficulty. I told Prince Lichnowsky that we should very shortly be sending him the draft of an agreement based on my conversation of the 7th May with Herr von Kuehlmann. A. P. June 7, 1913. r:•... L ; -[ 21191 ] Annex. Minute by Mr. Parker. I CALLED at the German Embassy to-day and Herr von Kiiblmann explained to me the views o± the German Government in regard to certain matters touching the Bagdad Railway, Turkish finance, and river navigation in Mesopotamia. I asked him to allow me to make notes, as the subjects are involved, and I pointed out that I had come to listen to his remarks and had of course no proposals to make. The substance of his remarks was as follows:— 1. The Bagdad Railway Company would prefer to build and manage the section from Bagdad to Basra themselves rather than abandon that section to another Company. The Company did not, under the arrangement of 1911, definitely abandon their rights to do this; they at that time merely made a declaration of their readiness to do so subject to two conditions, viz. : that the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest in the new Company should be equal to that of any nation other than Turkey, and that the Bagdad Railway Company should receive compensation for the renunciation of rights secured to them under the original concession. 2. If His Majesty’s Government agree to point (1), then the Societe would be prepared to agree that:— (a.) The sections from Basra to the Gulf should be indefinitely postponed. (b.) If those sections ever should be built the Societe would like to share in the building of them, but would not ask to share in the subsequent management of the sections, but there must be adequate guarantees as regards through traffic. (c.) That Basra should be the terminus of the line. (d.) That the construction and control of the port at Basra should be the subject o± an agreement with his Majesty s Government. _ _ n j. n o (e.) That two British directors should be admitted to the Board of the hallway from Konia to Basra. 3. The German Government would confirm these proposals of the Societe. They would also agree that German subjects should make no claim o par icipa e g nn thp Ennhrates and Tigris If a reasonable and fair arrangement can be for the railway while building, then ^ Ge_ would forthwith abandon any claim to navigation on tll0S ® ^ ive ^' ’ rds building some techmcal reason, undertake that German subjects TaSTnot participate rn a^Tavigation company on the two rivers after, say, five years from 1913. , Qnrfiptp a cnee that the terminus shall be 4.

The \ French Government were quite ready to come to an agreement with Germany about the Bagdad Railway, and would like the whole matter cleared up and got out of the way. He asked whether I could not suggest this to the Germans. I T said that I had already suggested to Herr von Kiiblmann that the Germans should talk to the French about the railway. We had said that we would not oppose the railway if the Germans made with us the proposed agreement. It would now be for the French to get what guarantees they wanted for the region in which they were interested in railways, and then I hoped that the French and ourselves might come to an agreement with Germany as to the financial arrangements to be made by the Financial Commission in Paris in support of the railway.

Sir, THE German Ambassador gave me to-day the the Bagdad Railway :— Foreign Office, June 2, 1913. following letter in connection with “ Dear Sir Edward, _ “ London, May 31, 1913. “ According to your desire, expressed in a previous conversation, I beg to give you the wording which we propose for the clauses intended to be put at the end of our contemplated agreement concerning the Bagdad Railway. The text would run as follows :— (Translation.) “ ‘ The preceding arrangements for the final settlement of all questions connected with the Bagdad Railway shall become operative only under the express condition— “ ‘ 1. That the result of the Paris Financial Commission’s decisions shall guarantee that all losses which the Bagdad Railway may suffer through the rearrange ment of conditions in the Balkans should be fully compensated by mortgaging other sources of revenue of equal value and, at least, equal security; “ ! 2. That the Turkish Government shall assign as guarantee sufficient sources of revenue for the building and running of the whole line from Konia to Basra, including branch lines, which, according to the concession, aie entitled to guaiantees. “ I may explain that the question of providing adequate means for the Bagdad Railway does not seem bound up in principle with any increase_ m the customs. Experts point out that, provided Turkey is not burdened with a war indemnity of any sort, she will be able to find the necessary guarantees. Sources of ^h r menue s seem to be the ‘ excedent des revenus diverses,’ administered by the Dette pubhque, and perhaps the old 8 per cent, ad valorem duties of places where traffic is likely to increase after the completion of the Bagdad line. t( g e p eve me&gt; &amp; c “ T .rnTTxrnwHTrv ” He said that opYnioT would expect one Gennan director ^ ^ on the company that ^ge ^ that the Davigat;on would be I said that we should be prepa - course require a port.

Memorandum sent to the German Ambassador, June 10, 1913. SIR. JE. GREY has had under careful consideration the record of the conversation which took place at the German Embassy on the 7th May between Herr von Kiihlmann and Mr. Parker respecting the Bagdad Railway. Sir E. Grey understands that a copy of this record is in possession of the German Embassy, and he now has the honour to state that His Majesty’s Government would be prepared to conclude an arrangement on the basis of the paragraphs numbered 1 2, and 3. With regard to paragraph 4, His Majesty’s Government have negotiated a convention (which has been initialled ad referendum) with the Ottoman Government for the establishment of an Ottoman Commission, which is to be entrusted with the improvement of conditions of navigation on the Shatt-el-Arab. One of the two commissioners will be a British subject, and the draft convention provides that the Shatt-el-Arab shall be open to the ships of all nations. It further provides that any dues shall be levied on a basis of absolute equality without regard to the nationality of sea-going vessels or their cargoes. With regard to paragraph 2, point (d) His Majesty’s Government would suggest that any control at Basra secured to the Ottoman Government should be exercised through the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Commission. As regards paragraph 5, His Majesty’s Government would, on the conclusion of the proposed arrangement, and on receiving an assurance that there would be no ^ discrimi nation against British merchandise either in railway rates or in traffic facilities, be prepared to give an undertaking similar to that contained in article 3 of the Russo- German agreement of the 19th August, 1911, viz. : Foreign Office, June 10, 1913. [2950 7?—1]2 Enclosure in No. 1. Draft Anglo-German Declaration. HIS Britannic Majesty’s Government declare that they will not oppose the construction and management by the Bagdad Railway Company of the proposed railway between Bagdad and Basra. 2. The Bagdad Railway Company, having- agreed, in so far as they are concerned on the following arrangements with the Imperial Otto man Government, the Imperial German Govern ment, so far as concerns themselves, hereby adhere to the said arrangements and confirm them and guarantee their due execution :— (a.) The construction of a branch from Basra (Zubeir) to the Persian Gulf, referred to in article 1 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, shall be indefinitely post poned, and shall in no case be undertaken unless and until there is complete agreement on the subject between His Britannic Majesty’s Govern ment, the Imperial German Government, and the Imperial Ottoman Government. (6.) In the event of the construction of the said branch being eventually undertaken, the Bagdad Railway Company, wdiile desiring to participate in the construction, forgoes all claim to participate in the management ; though adequate arrangements shall be made to secure facilities for through traffic from and to the Bagdad Railway Company’s system. (C.) The terminus of the Bagdad Railway Company s line shall be at Basra; ami the agdad Railway Company shall renounce all claims, whether under article 23 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903 or m any other way derived, to build a port or rail- way terminus on the Persian Gulf. (d.) The construction of the proposed port at asra shall be executed in a manner to be mutually agreed upon, and so that British partici- pation in the undertaking shall amount to 50 per cent, of the whole. ^ The control of the port of Basra shall be exercised as provided in Annex No 1 attache! to the present declaration Lhed•***..„. 3 (e.) Two British directors, selected from a list oi candidates to be submitted by His Britannic majesty s Government, shall be admitted to the card of the Bagdad Railway Company ; and no discrimination, direct or indirect, shall be per mitted on the Bagdad Railway Company’s system, either as regards facilities or rates of charge for the conveyance of like articles between the same points on account of the ownership, origin, or destination of goods presented for transport, or in any other manner whatsoever. 3. I he Imperial German Government declare that they will in no case themselves establish, or ^ support any claim by any persons or corporations whatsoever to establish, a port or railway terminus on the Persian Gulf, without the prior assent of His Britannic Majesty’s Government. 4. The Imperial German Government under- &gt;/.-/I take that they will in no wise encourage or support claims on the part of German subjects to participate in any enterprise of navigation on the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. It is nevertheless understood that this article in no wise affects the rights conceded by article 9 of the Bagdad Railway Convention of the 5th March, 1903, relative to the importation of materials exclusively destined for the construction of the Bagdad Railway, except in so far that it is hereby expressly agreed that the said rights shall not continue to be exercised for more than five years from the date of signature of the present Declaration. It is further agreed that if an arrangement, to the satisfaction of the parties concerned, can be made for the conveyance by river of the said materials through British or Ottoman agency, His Britannic Majesty’s Government and the Imperial German Government will lend their best en deavours to the conclusion of such an arrange ment. o. His Britannic Majesty’s Government will use their best endeavours to secure that^the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall be carried on on terms of absolute equality for the vessels of all nations without regard either to the nationality of the vessels or of their cargoes. 6.

Grey considers that there is advantage in securing an undertaking from the German Government with regard to the exclusion of differential treatment on the Bagdad Railway system, corresponding to the undertaking .Uoh tot S—t desire tre. Bis «.je=t,'e S.ver.ent in regard to the river. - „ JL x 13 JUN1913 The Under Secretary of State,^ India Office.( 21191 / 13 ) understands, from informal communication with the German Embassy, that the German Government would be satisfied if, in the event of the Chairman of the proposed Ottoman Navigation Company being called upon to exercise his casting vote, the suggested German director were excluded by the statutes of the Company from voting at all. This, it is suggested, would overcome the risk of British control, which is to be exercised by means of the Chairman’s casting vote, being endangered. As regards the suggested advisory commission, to make recommendations to the Shatt-el-Arab Conservancy Commission, Sir E. Grey is not disposed to agree to such an institution; but he considers that it might be well to provide that the Conservancy Commission should have powers of direct corres pondence with the foreign Consuls at Bussorah, and that the latter should, in a purely advisory capacity, have the ri^it of making recommendations. Sir E. Grey understands that the Bagdad Railway Company would be prepared to allot at least Forty per cent in the construction of Bussorah harbour to British firms. Sir( 21191 / 13 ) Sir E. Grey had, some time ago, given the National Bank of Turkey an as 8 urax.ce that if British parties, participation in the Bagdad Railway were arranged, the Bank should be the concessionnaire for the British share. He feels, therefore, that inasmuch as the construction of the port of Bussorah is provided for under the Bagdad Bailway Convention the National Bank mi^at consider that they had a prior claim to any British share in this work, making the necessary financial arrangements with British con tractors to carry it out. Sir E. Grey would however be glad to have the views of the India Office as to the necessity for the interven tion of a Bank in such an enterprise. I am, Sir, Your most obedient humble Servant,Notice From i revious conversation© concerning details of the negotiations about the Bagdad Hallway it appears that th-re is a desire for British representation in the port of Basra* The directors of the Bagdad Railway Company have no objection in principle to this. They intend to organise the Basra Harbour Company on lines practical ly analogous to those of the Haidar Pasha Harbour Company, the details of which have been communicated to the Foreign Office. The directors of the Bagdad Railway Company are inclined to give British Capital SQt of the total capital of the Basra Harbour Company, anc to elect on the Board of this Company, which would build and run the Pusrr.. Harbour, the two English mem- bars smiag on the Bagdud Mihm Con: Board.

I told him that I should be prepared to go as far as Russia had gone at Potsdam, and say that we would not obstruct the Bagdad Railway. But we could not become active partners in promoting it unless an arrangement was come to with France and Russia.

[24323] No. 1. ^ Nq 165 ^ Sir Edward Grey to Sir E. Goschen. Q‘ T tot 'r» it xr- i Foreign Office, May 23, 1913. T D Herr von Kuhlmanu to-day that for some time past I had been unable to give close attention to the details of the Bagdad Railway question owing to the amount of time that I had had to give to other things, but I had now looked into the matter and 1 would tell him how we stood. s ! x y ears a g°&gt; cm the occasion of the German Emperor’s visit, when he had said that it was natural for us to have a gate on the Persian Gulf, we had suggested negotiation a guatie, so that an agreement might he come to by Germany, France, Russia, and ourselves all together. But this had not found favour with the German Government, binding that this was so, France, Russia, and ourselves had agreed that each might negotiate separately with Germany and conclude our own agreements, hut on _ the* condition that any agreement by one of us for participation in the Bagdad Railway should not become effective till the other two countries had also reached an agreement with Germany. In addition, we had agreed that none of the three of us would give consent to the 4 per cent, increase of the Turkish customs dues till the other two were ready also. The agreement now made with Hakki Pasha had not yet been before the Cabinet and it must still be subject to confirmation there, though I had little doubt that, if the Foreign Office and India Office were both in favour of the agreement, as I believed they were, the Cabinet would sanction it. We did not regard this agreement as being dependent upon the consent of France and Russia, because it did not involve partici pation in the Bagdad Railway. As far as this railway was concerned, except for the small point of having two British directors on the board as a ^ guarantee against differentiation of rates, the agreement was really self-denial. bV e did not even acquire the right to make the section from Basra to the Gulf: we secured only the negative guarantee that this section should not be made without oui consent. I was prepared to defend this agreement in Parliament, and to say that, it it was confirmed, we should have no interest in opposing the completion of the Bagdad Railway to Basra. Hitherto, there had been apprehension that the Bagdad Railway, completed to the Persian Gulf, might upset the status quo there, migffi d^lace the navigation, now in British hands, by which British trade F 1 ^’- transfer into other hands the whole of the trade-route ^ ^ Asm Mmoi. The agreement that we had now made with Turkey wouldjafeguard us against Ais. Vi German Company, or in some other Basra, but nre-nared not to Dress her claim for the continuation oi tne railway v peement that we had now maue witu x j ^ which Turkev understood that Germany had an agree^ ^ was bound to continue the railway to the Persia , j ^ ^ I also understood that Germany was prepared not to press her claim tor me ^ ^ : d t p at every f ac iii ty wished to be sure that there would be no opi to £ ^his Germany wished would be given for, its continuation to Basra. ^ “^rclmfs’sion in hris that we should instruct our delegates h'eiect securing by financial arrangementsjh^necessary^^.^ ^ co-operate m this would mean that we should actively participate in supportmg^ . fo houla. _ acu j P ^ entitled to promise support of Railway.

It would make our agreement with German} conditional. Germany, I understood, did not wish the agreement to he definitive till she was sure that the outcome of it would be that she would get facilities for constructing the railway as far as Basra. We, on the other hand, wished the agreement to be conditional, because we could not make a promise of actual support for the railway till a settlement was come to with France and Russia. The change made by the agreement would be that we should henceforth he willing to give reasonable support if I ranee and Russia were satisfied; whereas, without the agreement with Germany, we should have said to France and Russia that, even if they were satisfied^ their support must be conditional upon the making of an arrangement by Germany with ns. I observed 'that what I had said applied to the Bagdad Railway itself as far as Basra. I could not enter into any discussion about the Bagdad-Kanikan branch, because I understood that the arrangement come to between Germany and Russia at Potsdam involved the continuation of that branch into Persia, and from that moment the branch became a matter that specially concerned Russia, and was therefore one with which I could not deal separately at all. Herr von Kuhlmann said that he would endeavour to frame a conditional form of words. v I said that I also would think the matter over. I am, &amp;e. E. GREY.ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

S n th ! ^ f 0 in tllG Persian P^visiins about the navigation o the Shatt-cl-Arab, and a stipulation that the^Bagdad Railway should not go beyond Basra without our consent. We had not claimed participation in the Bagdad Railway but were to have two directors on the board of the railway from Konieh to Basra Inese directors would, of course, not be able to exercise control, but they would be able to see that, m piactice as well as in theory, there w 7 as no differentiation of rates on British goods. They would be able to let us know if any such differentiation did take place, m which case we should make diplomatic representations. Since we had made this arrangement with Hakki Pasha, the German Government had begun to speak to us on the subject. Apparently, they were entitled to claim from Turkey that the Bagdad Railway should, in one way or another, be continued to the Persian Gulf; and they said that, therefore, Turkey could not forgo without their consent the right to make the railway from Basra to the Gulf. But this consent they were willing to give if there was no opposition to the railway being made to Basra, and if they could be assured that the financial guarantees for making the line up to Bagdad, which would be lost by the cession of Turkish territory in Europe to the allies, would be replaced, and if further guarantees were secured to carry the line on to Basra. This was a matter that would come before the Financial Commission in Paris, and I could not commit myself to the German Government without first discussing the matter with the French and Russian Governments. We were now satisfied that, if the railway did not go beyond Basra, w r e need not regard it as being prejudicial to British interests, and we need not oppose it. # . The French Ambassador w r as under the impression that we had secuied the right to build the section from Basra to the Gulf, and had been offered the Bagdad-Kanikin branch I assured him that this was not so. We had not acquired any right to huild any section, and we had no participation.

It will be recollected that Herr Kuhlmann has accepted that record as an accurate version ot his proposals, and a copy of it is annexed. The important point to bear in mind is that paiagiaph 6 does not enter as a condition of the proposed written agreement with Germany : I was particularly careful to keep it out by the wording of my minute. The suggested conditions of the bargain with Germany are to be found only in paragraphs 1 to 4 of my record. When he came on the 20th May, Herr Kuhlmann said he understood the German Company, would prefer to build the port of Basra alone. (This is intelligible from the German standpoint, but we should prefer to participate owing to our special interest in the river and for other reasons.) The Germans, he said, would like the conditions for controlling the port at Basra to be the same as those which exist at Haidar Pasha (opposite Constantinople). He would explain those conditions later. If we did exercise any share of control, he said he would prefer that it should be done through the proposed Shatt-el-Arab Commission. (Primd facie, there seems no objection to this, but it must be fully looked into.) The German Government could not absolutely prohibit any German subject from buying shares in the new navigation company, or even from engaging in navigation, but they would undertake not to “ encourage or support ” any German subject in taking part in the navigation. The German Government hoped, however, for the sake of public opinion, that the word “ monopoly ” might be avoided in the agreement with Turkey. I said I would report his remarks, but that the monopoly was the essence ol the whole thing, just as in effect the Germans had a monopoly on the rai way, an I said it seemed to me impossible to secure our object if the word were omitte . He said the German Government hoped we would agree to give an undertaking that there should be no discrimination between the different nations m regard to river traffic rates. (This is quite reasonable.) £ ^ tEp Then he said that if the company agreed to the. indefinite 0 d h line from Basra to the Gulf it w 0 m require financial compensation from the lurkist Government for that section (100 miles or so). (The Germans seem to intend to squeeze the poor Turks, but t0 gecure the allocation of Lastly, he said that the company wished « specific revenues for the mam line up to B &gt; UoiQil which need not be specially include the Khanikin branch). He said this was a ; ntroc [ uc tion of the Khanikin brought to Sir E.^ Grey’s attention, it J^ r&lt; d^ C ^°^ s ° ruc t; 011 of th e branch, a very important detail, and ho t] ^ de t];iere S eems little doubt that Khanikin branch may be as an alt f iy , t to se c Ur e the immediate allocation Russia will oppose any attempt on Ger^ ^ P tion of t h at branch has an important of revenues for this branch, as the date o P t The Bagdad Railway effect on Russia’s obligations concession of 1903, to secure Company is of course already e “p e , d ’ “ch eventual^, but I think we should stipulate the allocation of revenues for that bra exhausted financial condition of with Herr Kuhlmann that, having regard to the exbauste [2917 x —2]2 tarA ft r. 5K«is - ••&amp;•»■*• Fi ““‘ &lt;*-— atP Meanwhile it seems important to maintain the position that the question of ^ ZlTu7jZsf°orToi collateral assurance that we would help them to get security fOT ‘it seems'very desirable to tie the Germans down as soon as possible to their undertaking about the river navigation, lest they should whittle it away, and I venture to suggest that a draft agreement should be prepared ad endum. ^ ^ May 21, 1913.

Conspicuous among these latter papers is the “ Vossische Zeitung,” which publishes a telegram from its Paris correspondent to the effect that a new treaty has been concluded between His Majesty’s Government and Turkey, giving to the former paramount influence over the Basra-Koweit section of the* Bagdad Railway. “ In return for this,” the telegram continues, “ England undertakes to build up the harbour of Basra, which is of great importance to the Bagdad Railway. On the Turco-Persian frontier Turkey cedes the territory of Urmia, a concession obtained by England in the interests of Russia, in return for Russian support.” The telegram concludes by outlining the other provisions of the agreement, including the reforms in Anatolia and Syria promised by Turkey. In commenting on its correspondent’s telegram, the “ Vossische Zeitung,” after expressing the hope that England’s role of honest broker during the Balkan crisis was not prompted by self-interest, and after admitting that the above-mentioned terms contain in themselves nothing objectionable to Germany, says that it will be impossible to judge whether England has been playing fair in the Koweit question till the badly- needed German official statement on the subject appears.

I said that we did not wish to be inquisitive, but the alteration if made would of course be important, and we should be glad if the Germans could give us any information on the point. He said he did not know, but that he would telegraph to Berlin to enquire : I asked him not to telegraph, as the matter did not press. He then said that he would like to warn me about Herr Ruete : he was a. perfectly honest, though someiwhat garrulous individual; he had no direct connection with the Deutsche Bank, but was anxious “ de se faire valoir,” and he was a great friend of Mr. Lynch.

As a matter of fact, the Bagdad llailvvay ornpany, and the Deutsche Bank, and the German Government, attached the greatest importance to the construction of the Bagdad-Basra section : he thought it well to make it plain that Herr Ruete had no sort of mandate from either pe German Government or the Deutsche Bank to negotiate on rai way ques ions.

As the capital of the last-named Company is half British and half German, the effect of this would be that half the capital would be British, one-third Turkish, and one-sixth German. As regards this proposed division of capital, we must be free to arrange with the Germans as to the allocation between the two countries of the Anglo-German share. In the event of the Germans foregoing their share, we should be willing that this should be divided equally between Great Britain and Turkey. flhe limits and period of the concession should be generally on the lines already discussed between us. It would no doubt be necessary to provide some means wdiereby a fair share of the future expansion of the trade of the rivers would be carried by the British Company, which otherwise might find itself driven out by the competition of the new Company.

I did not, therefore, see how^ Turkey could again have to pay an indemnity for the giving up of any part of a concession as regards which she had already purchased her freedon of action, subject to the condition of participation of German capital which I had stated. I had, however, been unable to attend to any details of this subject lately, and I would ask the Ambassador either to discuss them with Sir Louis Mallet or to authorise Herr von Kuhlmann to discuss them.

Ae Sir E. Grey had warned mo before that I was not to discuss an:, fresh proposals, I told Herr Kuehlmann that I would merely listen to what he had to say anc report it. Gince some of his •points of detail* are to the advantage of Germany, I think it is vext- desirable that Glr £. Grey should have this minute, and rxr original record of Herr Kuehlmann' s proposals, before him when ht sous Herr Kuehlmann to-morrow. It will be recollected that Herr Kuehlmann has accepted that record as an accurate version of his proposals, me x copy of it is annexed. The im portant point to bear in mind is that paragraph 6 does not outer as a condition of the proposed it ,,^,§11 agrcsOHient with Germany * I was particularly careful to )(Mp it out ty til* wording of My minute. The suggested conditions of tfto burguin with Germany are ■ o bo found only in paragraph? 1 to 4 of my record. When he Ciitae on May 20th Herr Kuehlrnann oaid he understood the Germ; n Company would prefer to build the port of Bussor&amp;h clone (Thin is intelliBlble from the Geman standpoint, but we should prefer to parti- cipate owing to our special interest In the river and * fQ? other reasons). The Germane, he said, would nice the conditions forlor controlling the port at Buseorah to be the earn# a 8 those which exist at Haidar Pasha (opposite Con- btantinople) • He would explain those conditions it.%.vox • 11 did exercise any share of control, he Ba^d he foulc prefer that it should be done through tho proposed *?hatt&gt; el - Arab Coomission* (Prira facie there so ms no obioction to this, but it must be fully locked into)* The Uerman Government coulc not absolutely pro hibit any Gorman subject from buying shares in the now navigation Company, or oven from engaging in navigation, but they would undertake not to •encour age or support• any German subject in taking part in the navigation. The OcrrmJi Government hoped, how ever, for the sake of public opinion, that the word •monopoly* might bo avoided in the agreement with Turkey. I said I voulc report hie remarks, but that the monopoly was the eesenco of the whole thing, just aa in effect the Germans had a monopoly on the rail way, and I said it seemed to me impossible to secure our object if the wore were omivise. He oald the Germiin Government hoped we would agree to give an uncertaclng that there should he no discrimination between the ciflerent nations in rs- fiurd to river traffic rates.

The substance of his remarks was as follows: 1, The Bagdad Rig Co would prefer to build and manage the section from Bagdad to Bussorah themselves rather than abandon that section to another Company, The Company did not, under the arrangement of 1911, definitely abandon their right to do this; they at that A time merely made a declaration of their readiness to do so subject to two conditions, vis, that the Bagdad Railway Company's interest in the new Company should be equal to that of any nation other than Turkey,and that the Bagdad Railwag Co should receive compensation for the renunciation of rights secured to them under the original concession, S.

If a reasonable and fair arrangement can be made for the conveyance of materials for the railway while building^ then the Germans would forthwith abandon any claim to navigation on those rivers. If, however, for some technical reason, such an arrangement cannot be made as regards building material etc., then the German Government would undertake that German subjects shall not participate in any navi gation company on the two rivers after, say, five years from 1913. 4. If the German Government and the Societe agree that the terminus shall be Bussorah, they will expect an undertaking from H. and the Ottoman Gvt that the Shat t-el-Arab shall be kept in a satisfactory state of conservancy, so that sea-going vessels without discrimation of flag shall always be assured of easy access to Bussorah on equal conditions. 5 The German Gvt would appreciate a con- fidential intimation as tb the attitude of B.,.G. towards the Bagdad Rly enterprise on the conclusion of s ^ arrangement as that in question. 6 '3 6* The German Gut mi.ahw th r l8heS GO °Peration between zne German and British * 7 p . 1Sh dele ^ on the Finl= oomu= at Paris, so as to secure a) that the Bagdad Railway Co shall receive fresh and equally good security for any revenue^ pledged to the Company and nhich Turkey may forfeit as the result of the war (e.g. the Customs duties surplus). o) That, m the arrangements about to be made for Turkish financial reorganisation, adequate revenues shall now he earmarked for the securities of the Bagdad Bussorah sect ion.

TheThe issued capital of the Pailway Compejiy ie, as stated above, £ 600 , 000 ; half only subscribed in cash, the other half being paid up out of the profits on th-' construction of the first section. it is now proposed apparently to Increase the capital from £60^,000 to £900,000, and it is proposed that a British group should come in and take out 10 per cent, of the total capital (t90,o n o) to be peid for in cash at par. Sir H. B&amp;blngton Smith haa pointed! out how the subscribers for the new capital of £ 300 ,including the £90,000 set aside for British subeeribers, would be at a disadvantage as compared with the present holders of shares in the Company. It Is not clear for what purpose additional capital is required at all unless if is assumed that the proceeds ox the Turkish bonds will certainly be insufficient, to build -he re- mainlng pectiona of the Bailway. Tf this 1e the assumption the unsoundness of the Company's finance in dividing the profit assumed to have been made on the building of the first section is made even clearer than before. In any event the sum of £90,is almost a negligible0 negligible sum when compared with the cost of building the Pallway, and it is presumably not this sum which Harr von Owinner hopes to obtain from English in vestors, but he presumably aims rather at British halp in turning the Turkish bonds into cash. From no point of view dose any great inducement seem to be held out to the British investor. The share capital of the Company has probably beer watered to the extent of 50 par cent, without taking into ac court the fact that the contract price has apparently been increased by l n per cent owing to the inter position of the Construction Company. Moreover, in termediary profits have apparently been made in the post by the Syndicate formed for the selling of the bonds. The Syndicate has no prospect of future pro fits, but is under heavy liabilities of which the new shareholders ir&gt; the Bagdad Pallway would have to bear their proportion. With two English directors on the Poard there would be a vary small element of British control. The Construction Company is domiciled in Frankfort and the contractors are a Gorman r rm. Consequently it is hardly nicely that any benefit would accrue to English manufacturers of steel rails andand of railway rolling stock. Tie Deutsche Bank, fits arising from the administration of the loans. The~v. is no material to estimate the sufficiency c r otherwise of the security offered for the bonds but all the revenues charged seem to be subject to prior charges. r would gladly try to unravel all the complica- tione .for Sir H. LI. Smith but at present there is not the material to do this and the necessary in formation very likely will not be forthcoming. Information is needed with rerard. to the &amp;rrang«n#nte Syndicate for selling the bonds, and with regard to the contract with Messrs. Holsmann. A full know ledge on these points seems to be necessary before any British representative could be asked to be a director. T note that on Foreign Office Paper No.26615/13 Herr von Gw inner is represented as stating that, with the Construction Company and with the pany must rep 'under Ottoman r law directors on the Board of a Com- resent groups of shareholders. There- fore.Therefore, if there were to bo two British directors on the -card of the Bagdad hallway they must re present British shareholders.* Tt seems desirable to ascertain what the rule is to which Herr von Gwinner refers. I never heard of any such rule and am Inclined to think that T -%rr von Gwiimer Is mistaken. It might be worth while to ask the opinion of Mr. H.E.

Section 1, [26463] No. 1 Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received June 9.) (Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, Jane 9, 1913. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 6th June transmitting copy of a semi-official communication from the German Embassy and drafts of a memorandum and declaration which Sir E. Grey proposes to communicate to the German Ambassador, and to offer the following observations thereon:— 1. The Board see no objection to Sir E. Grey’s proposal to endeavour to obtain an undertaking from the German Government against discrimination on the Bagdad Railway, and the terms of paragraph (C) of article 2 of the draft declaration appear to be sufficient for the purpose in view. 2. With reference to the suggested admission of a German representative to the board of the new navigation company, the Board are of opinion, after consultation with the proposed concessionnaire, that, inasmuch as there will be no German financial interest in the conduct of the company, it is most desirable that the powers of the German representative should be limited to a voix consultative. they also consider it desirable to define the purpose for which the German representative will attend the meetings of the board, and 1 am consequently to suggest that at the end of paragraph (8) the following words should be added : “ for the purpose of safeguarding the interests of German trade against discrimination of any kind.” , 3 The Board concur in what they understand to be Sir L. Giey s opinion, that the establishment of an advisory board in connection with the Shatt-el-Arab conser- vancv is undesirable but they see no objection to an alternative proposal to give the Gennan consular officer at Basra the right to make recommendations to the conservmicy^^ ^ tQ be esta blished at Basra, the Board see no objection to i ’ i A Ttritish narticination in the construction should be allocated to Ihe National Bank of Turkey who should be at liberty to make the necessary financ.al 1, relative to the control of the port, will be comimmicated to you sUy for Sir E.

P&gt;&amp;vllTl, M(llJ 31, 1913. _ 1HL following question was addressed to the Imperial Chancellor in the Reichstag yesterday by Dr. Muller (of Meiningen), the prominent Liberal member:— Is the Imperial Chancellor prepared to furnish information in regard to an agreement concluded between Turkey, England, and Germany, under which Germany can construct the Bagdad Railway as far as Basra on condition of the admission of two English members to the Administrative Council, whilst the construction of the harbour at Basra and the line from Basra to Koweit would fall to England with an English protectorate over Koweit ? ” Herr von Jagow, Imperial Secretary of State of the Foreign Office, replied as follows :— “As the House is no doubt aware from the statement made yesterday by the English Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, England and Turkey have agreed on the draft of a treaty whereby the Bagdad Railway shall not go further than Basra without the concurrence of England ; and England, in view of her interests in the section from Bagdad to Basra, is to be represented on the Administrative Council of the Bagdad Railway by two votes. As Sir Edward Grey pointed out in his statement, the agreement has been come to between England and Turkey. We have, however, been kept informed of the progress of the negotiations, and, so far as our interests and rights under the earlier Bagdad agreements and our present Bagdad agreements are affected by the Anglo-Turkish treaty, our concurrence is necessary, as the two contracting parties do not fail to recognise. An exchange of views on the subject has been begun. Pending its termination, I must, I regret to say, abstain from making a further statement in regard to details. I desire, however, to state that the provisions of the Anglo-Turkish agreement, whereby the Bagdad Railway is to terminate at Basra is based on the assumption that the Shatt el-Arab will be made navigable to the Persian Gulf, and must be maintained permanently in this I have, &amp;c.

A significant portion of the papers relate to the financial arrangements governing the incorporation of the Imperial Baghdad Railway Company, which was also responsible for the governance of the railway and any possible extensions.However, the majority of the papers express British concerns on German encroachment towards the Persian Gulf, and by extension, towards British interests in South Asia.
