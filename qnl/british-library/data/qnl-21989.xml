To Political Resident, Bushire. No. C/1357 Dated the 14th October, 1943. The Bahrain Petroleum Company are anxious to obtain a supply of rice for issue as rations to their employees of all races. They endeavoured to obtain rice from India but have now been informed by their^ Bombay agents that the export of rice has been forbidden, 2. It is, in my opinion, desirable that a supply of rice be forthcoming in order to maintain the morale of the workmen of a concern which Is engaged in vital war work. The minimum amount required is 30 tons a month and I suggest that it may be possible to purchase 500 tons rice from Iraq through the UKCC, Kuwait was recently considering the purchase of 1,000 tons of Iraq rice at 65 I.Ds. a ton f,o,r. Basra.^ This rice is not of high quality but is better than nothings 3, If you see no objection, I suggest that the UKCC be asked to forward immediately samples of rice by air mail to me and that the MESC be requested to approach the Iraq Government with a view to ensuring that if the samples a?e approved export permits will be forth coming.

To His Britannic Majesty’s Political Agent Bahrain. Sir, I have the honour/to inform you that His Highness Shaikh Salman has instructed me to write to you on the subject of Egyp tian rice. His Highness has recently heard that a small amount of Iraqi rice was released for export to Kuwait in returnfor the Kuwait Government’s permission fa* a quantity of matches being exported to Basra. The only local produce which is exported from Bahrain, apart from pearls, is petroleum products which Iraq does not need. In the past however Bahrain oil has been shipped to Egypt and I believe shipments are being continued. His Highness thinks that if strong represen tations were made to the Egyptian Government and the supply authorities in Egypt pointing out that Bahrain supplies Egypt with oil it might be possible that the Egyptian Government would permit the export of Egyptian rice to Bahrain. His Highness has reason to believe that rice is available in Oman and in Qatar, the latter state having recently acquired rice from Dubai f ¥et in Bahrain, where strict control is exercised over fooastuffs, no rice was available for many-months and at present only 116 bags remain out of the 2,000 bags which were purchased from Dubai about three months-ago.

I have the honour to refer to your letter No.l998/50SF dated the 24th October 1943. 2. I believe it probable that some rice has been sold to the Kuwait Government by the Iraq Government though I have no certain information. I have no knowledge of surplus stocks existing in Dubai or Qatar nor of any desire on the part of the Kulers of those Shaikhdoms to dispose of the small quantity that remains from their carefully conserved supplies. ■ 3. I would draw His Highness* attention to the fact that he has no control over the supplies of oil and petrol exported by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Their exports are their own property and the destination of those exports is determined by the Petroleum Department or Board. It would thus .not be possible to use the Bahrain oil products as a trading asset to induce Egypt to export rice to the Persian Gulf. 4.

You made it quite clear from your demi-official letter of the 26th of October that there were 7,000 bags of rice in Dubai at the beginning of October, of which 1,000 were to be exported to Qatar. Thus, there should have been 6,000 bags of rice available in Dubai, th^t is approximately 460 tons. This being in addition to the 1,146 tons of wheat and barley which were consumed during the month. Your cereal consumption during October was considerably above the average for the previous three months. 3. I shall be interested to know on what you base your statement that the population of Dubai is one hundred thousand. This figure is approximately that for the total population of the Bahrain Islands and a third as great again as the town of Kuwait. Lorrimer placed the total population of the Trucisl Coast from Abu Dhabi to Has al Khaimah inclusive as approxi mately 68,000 including the tribes of the interior. Dibai town he considered numbered only 10,000 peSaons. 4. Assuming for one moment the population as stated by you, and that the rice was distributed equally, then at the rate of 13£ lbs. a person, Dubai alone would have required rather more than 600 tons, that is more than 7,800 bags. I note that you indicate that approximately 3,500 bags met Dubai’s demand. 5. I do not agree that the supplies should be kept in water tight compartments in these days and I consider that where there is a surplus of ah essential food-stuff it should be divided equally among the Bhaikhdoms of the Gulf. I am not at all satisfied with the way this rice has been disposed of, especially in view of the fact that I am receiving continued reports regarding the smuggling of rice from Qatar to Massa. I shall be glad if you will use every endeavour to determine exactly what quantity of rice and other cereals are at present being held in Dubai and Sharjah by the Shaikhs, their relatives, and the leading merchants. //£ Captain M.P.O’C.

This error goes back to October .(before I returned here from Bahrain) and arises from approximately 2000 bags of wheat, containing 224 lbs each, being reck oned as containing 164 lbs each. Our monthly consumption of all food grains now works out as follows September (Kamdhan) October November 1313 tons. 1047 «• 1012 ' . so that it appears that our consumption in October was not above average. 3. My estimate of Dubai r s population at 100,000 was a slip of the pen, for which I apologise. The figures should have been 50,000 which I think, is approximately right, although the ohaikhs maintain s stoutly the population of Dubai with the bedouin dependent on it is imt less than 80.000.* &lt;At ibg lbs per head one bag of rice suffices for 12 people so that 4000 bags should have been consumed by 48,000 people, in addition to this many ships left Dubai for the 1943—44 trading season, and these had to be provisioned. Lorrimer»s estimate ox t3x population was made^in the early years of the century since when there has been i-U- 0 e influx to the Trucial LoL.st, and to Dubai in oarticular. from Lingah, Harrauz, Bander Abbas, Jask and other smaller towns in douth Persia^and a further influx to Dubai from other Trucial Coast towns has occar red in the last year. 4. &lt; I am doing my utmost to ascertain the present stocks held by private persons but no one is in a position to give accurate figures for his neighbour's stocks and the t&amp;skxis-very difficult one. All^ that is certain is that the stocks in &lt;i»he bazar and merchants go-downs (which, you will note from our memorandum No*C/781-34/3A dated^the 27th July 1943, were only ascertained by the use of stringent measures) have been exhausted and that rice can now be obtained in Dubai only by force or by threats.

I have discussed the matter with His Highness who would like to know the price before considering buying more Iraqi rice. According to the price charged by M.E.S.C. for the previous shipment of Iraqi rice we are selling it at Rs.2/2/- per roba (4 lbs) whereas wheat is sold at annas 12 and flour at annas 14. The apparent result is that, especially in the villages, number of people are not buying the rice ration because it is so expensive and they cannot afford it. If a small quantity of rice could be obtained if might by purchased by His Highness and some of the wealthier members of the Ruling Family.

' Quantities of low grade rice amounting to about 400 tons a month have been sold to tribes in possession of permits issued by the Saudi Arabian Government, •in addition to which maize and millet amounting to about 250 tons monthly and small quantities of dates have been authorised. These are transported by camel and together make an impressive convoy which may account for the rumours that large quantities of rice are involved. 3. Iraqi Government are strongly opposed to the export of rice and are unlikely to agree to releasing any quantities to Persian Gulf Sheikhdoms without some suitable exchange. Cotton textiles and yarn imported by the latter and surplus to their requirements have been suggested as possible commodities for barter. ■THOMPSON# COHFiDHJmAL Office of the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp, Sbiraz 3rd August 1944.

Addressed to the Ministry of Economic Warfare London telegram No. 6 ARFAR. Repeated Saving to Government of India No. 9 Eushire No. 1 (P.R.P.G.) Michel Saab, Tehran merchant, has received an offer from Montague Blunt of Durban for five or six thousand tons of five zeros Carolina rice from an unnamed supplier in the Argentine. Shipment would be by uncontrolled vessel direct to the Persian Gulf if Saab provided saleable return cargo. He has offered red iron oxide. Further necessary condition is that payment in sterling should be allowed. Imperial Bank of Iran have asked their London office about this. 2. Tentative distribution of rice is 2500 tons in Persian ports and 2500 tons at Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai. It is expected that all four governments would gladly give import permits. Persian Government finds it difficult to obtain full local surplus from Soviet-occupied provinces and often impossible to distribute on Gulf coast. Kuwait, Bahrain and Dubai would presumably reduce demands on India if Argentine rice arrived. 3 . I should be glad to learn whether there is a good prosoect of navicert being granted (provided supplier is unobjectionable) as the success of this transaction would affect general food policy in the -Gulf.

M.E.S.C. are in a much stronger position to obtain fulfillment of any contract entered into with Persian Government, and in my opinion only practicable solution is for M.E.S.C. to undertake, either directly or through their Agency, all transactions in Persia, and for Shaikhdoms to deal with M.E.S.C. on basis of a C.I.F. price at the Shaikhdoms.

To cancel this ? oar or' 1 t stage now reached might well prejudice future efforts of Fiddle East Bupply Centre to obtain Persian co-operation in regard to reservation of other supplies for foreign destinations.
