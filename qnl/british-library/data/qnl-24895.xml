The Foreign Office letter of 13th December speaks for itself. On the whole, in the light of the arguments contained in it, the course suggested in paragraph 3 seems the right one. As regards the last sentence of paragraph 2, it is of course the case that we hope to secure a formal recognition by Persia of the independence of the various Arab Principalities in the Persian Gulf, but as a matter of tactics one would have thought that it was preferable to give the Persians no justification for imagining that we regard formal recognition as a matter of great importance, or the ;independence vis-a-vis Persia of the Principalities in question as in any way open to question. The point is one of really active importance only in respect of Bahrein, ana while on various occasions Persian pass port officials have referred to Koweit as part of Persia or vise passports for Koweit, it is perhaps unnecessary to attach overmuch importance to these incidents. 2. On the whole, while the balance of advantage seems definitely to rest with the course suggested in paragraph 3 of the Foreign Office letter, we had perhaps better make sure that the Resident agrees before concurring in it.

S.W.l. 13th December, 1932 Sir I am directed by Secretary Sir John Simon to transmit to you herewith, for the consideration of Secretary Sir Samuel Hoare and for the favour of such observations as he may desire to offer in the matter, copy of a despatch from His Majesty^ Minister at Tehran regarding a request which he has received from the Persian Government for the service of a summons calling upon a certain Khurshid, son of Ghulam, at present resident in Koweit, to appear in proceedings against him in Persia on a charge of smuggling. It will be observed that the summons was made returnable for the 13th November, which date had already passed when Mr. Soared despatch was received. 2. It is not the practice of His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom to facilitate the service of process from foreign courts in penal matters unless the person on whom it is to be served is required as a witness. For this reason alone, therefore, Sir John Simon would find it difficult to support the request of the Persian Government for the service of the writ now in question.

In such an event the Persian Government might for example be informed of the readiness of the Sheikh of Koweit to allow Persian documents to be served in his territory if it were understood that the Persian Government would give reciprocal treatment for the service in Persia of documents emanating from courts in Koweit, adding as a rider a suggestion on the lines of that proposed in paragraph 7 of Mr. Hoare*s despatch, to the effect that the Sheikh was only making the offer out of regard for the fact that negotiations were in progress for the regularization of the relations between the two States. 3. Since however it seems impossible to foresee at the present moment, owing to the cancellation by Persia of the Anglo-Persian Oil concession and the generally precarious state of the treaty negotiations, whether any progress is likely to be made toward the recognition of Koweit by Persia, it might be better, if no great practical disadvantage is likely to be suffered by Koweit in consequence, to inform the Persian Government that pending their recognition of Koweit the service of documents from Persian courts cannot be effected in that country.

The enclosures to the note have “been transmitted in original to the Political Resident in the ersian Gulf, 2, In paragraph 2 of your despatch No, 77 of February 3rd last it was laid down that in the absence of a special agreement for the service of documents, and still more of recognition by the Persian Government, the Sheikh of Koweit is under no oblig ation to effect the service of Persian documents in his territory I understand, moreover, that the Political resident in the ersia Gulf and the Sheikh himself are averse to making this concession j ss an act of grace, 3* The present case, however, is s summons on a criminal charge, not a writ in respect of a civil suit and the ox fender appears to be a Persian subject (Tsnglstan is the district surrounding Bushire), 4, From one point of view, it would be a kindness to Khurshi himself to let him know that there was a criminal charge pending against him in Persia - though I have no doubt he is well enough aware of this, 6, From The Right Honourable Sir John Simon G.C.3,1,, etc. , etc., etc,, THtf FOR IGH OFFICS.- 2 .

Section I.— Communication to Foreign Authorities of Criminal Records keyt in this Country. THERE are no statutory provisions or rules in force in England and Wales with regard to the communication to foreign authorities of the criminal records kept in this country. In general, however, if an application is received in connexion with criminal proceedings direct from the police authorities of a foreign country addressed to the police authorities of England and Wales, requesting information concerning the contents of the criminal records with regard to an individual, the police authorities in England and Wales will accede to the request by replying direct to the police authorities of the foreign country concerned. It is preferred that all requests for the communication of information contained in the criminal records should be dealt with direct between the police authorities, and it is generally convenient that a request from abroad should be addressed to The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, New Scotland Lard, London, S.W. 1. Section II.— Summonses relating to Criminal Matters. There are no statutory provisions or rules with regard to this matter in force in England and Wales. Requests for the service on accused persons of summonses to appear before a foreign court or notifications of sentences or judgments^in criminal matters pronounced by foreign courts will not be executed by the authorities in England and Wales. The authorities in England and Wales on their part do not make requests for the service of such summonses or notices to the authorities of any other country. Under the law of England and Wales, trials in criminal matters do not take place unless the accused person has been served with a summons in the United Kingdom or has been extradited if he was in a foreign country, and sentences in criminal matters are not, except in very trivial cases, pronounced in the absence of the accused. As regards the service of notices to witnesses in criminal matters, requesting their attendance to give evidence in a foreign court, there is no objection to the service of such notices by foreign judicial authorities through the medium of their consular officers, private agents or the post, without the interposition of the authorities of this country. In general, it is preferred that one of these courses should be followed. If, however, requests from foreign judicial authorities are received through the diplomatic channel, addressed to the competent authorities of England and Wales, for the service of notices to witnesses requesting their attendance as witnesses in a foreign court for the purpose of a criminal proceeding, the request will, as a rule, be executed and the notices transmitted in England and Wales through the Secretary of State for the Home Department, provided that the names and addresses of the witnesses are sufficiently clearly set out in the request and the documents are in English or accompanied by a translation in English, and that in like cases the foreign country concerned will accord reciprocal treatment. 5937 [5651]2 Section III .—Obtaining of Evidence for Foreign Courts in Criminal Matters. 1. Foreign tribunals are at liberty, if their own procedure admits of such a course, to obtain evidence in England and Wales without any recourse to the authorities of these countries, by appointing a consular officer of their own country to obtain the evidence they require. In such cases the person so appointed may request individuals to appear before him and give evidence or produce documents, but he will have no compulsory powers. In general, however, it is preferred that recourse should be had to the procedure described in the following paragraphs rather than that this course should be adopted. 2. The English courts have power to obtain evidence for foreign courts or tribunals in criminal matters under Section 24 of the Extradition Act, 1870, and Section 5 of the Extradition Act, 1873. For convenience of reference, these sections are reproduced as Annexes I and II to this memorandum. This power is thus possessed (i) by the High Court under the earlier Act (and in so far as action is taken in the High Court in this matter, Rules 54-60 of Order XXXVII of the Rules of the Supreme Court and memorandum of which a copy forms Annex 3 with regard to the obtaining of evidence for foreign courts in civil matters, applies generally also to the obtaining of evidence in criminal matters), and (ii) under the later Act, upon the order of a Secretary of State, by a police magistrate or justice of the peace. The latter procedure is generally preferred and is more convenient. 3. The English courts will not, however, obtain evidence for foreign courts in criminal matters of a political character, and the English courts will only take the evidence of named persons or secure the production of specified documents. They have no power to perform other judicial acts for the assistance of foreign tribunals, such as seizing property situated in the ETiited Kingdom in connexion with some criminal investigation taking place abroad. 4. When evidence is required in a criminal matter, it is, however, always desirable that the foreign court desiring the evidence should issue a Letter of Request, and that such Letter of Request should be transmitted through the diplomatic channel. The Letter of Request should specify (i) that the matter in respect of which the evidence is required is a criminal matter; (ii) that it is pending before a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction in the country from which the request emanates; (iii) that such court or tribunal is desirous of obtaining by the assistance of the English courts the evidence which the English courts are asked to obtain. As it is generally more convenient in criminal matters that the evidence required should be obtained through the action of a magistrate under the order of a Secretary of State, it is preferable that the Letter of Request should be addressed simply to the competent court or tribunal in England. The Letter of Request should give a sufficient explanation of the nature of the case and the issues on which it is desired that the witnesses should give evidence, the names and addresses of the witnesses, and the documents (if any) whose production is desired. The Letter of Request and annexed documents should be in English or accompanied by a translation into English. 5. Except in cases where it is necessary that the evidence should be obtained in the High Court, the Letter of Request is transmitted by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, who issues the necessary order to a magistrate or justice of the peace under the Act of 1873, and the questions are put to the witnesses by the magistrate or justice of the peace. But the foreign prosecutor or a solicitor instructed on his behalf will generally be permitted to be present at the taking of the evidence. 6. The procedure under which the evidence is taken will be the English procedure. No witness can be compelled to answer any question which such person could not be compelled to answer if the matter were a part of a criminal proceeding in an English court. Thus, if the person whose evidence is desired is the accused person, he is not obliged to give evidence, nor is his or her spouse so obliged, except in certain special cases. The witnesses are sworn, and the accused or legal representatives of the accused may, if they desire, be present at the examination, and may cross-examine the witnesses. The presence of the accused or his representatives is not, however, necessary, and as a rule accused persons have not availed themselves of the right of being present or represented. The evidence so taken is transmitted by the magistrate or justice of the peaceAny person may, after payment or tender to him of a reasonable sum for his costs and expenses in this behalf, be compelled, for the purposes of this section, to attend and give evidence and answer questions and produce documents, in like manner and subject to the like conditions as he may in the case of a charge preferred for an indictable offence. Every person who wilfully gives false evidence before a police magistrate or justice of the peace under this section shall be guilty of perjury. Provided that nothing in this section shall apply in the case of any criminal matter of a political character.3 t° die Secretary of State for the Home Department, and by him to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who forwards it to the diplomatic representative of the country whose court requires the evidence. 7. Witnesses examined under Letters of Request are entitled under English ^ law to be paid reasonable sums for their costs and expenses (if any), and repay ment of these and other expenses is reclaimable from the diplomatic representative of the country whose court desires the evidence when the depositions of the evidence are transmitted to him or subsequently. 8. L nder English law. in criminal trials the courts cannot in general receive any evidence which is not given by witnesses in person before the court. Consequently, the authorities of this country do not have occasion to address requests to the authorities of other countries for the purpose of obtaining evidence in criminal matters. Section IV.— Obtaining hi formation for the Purpose of Criminal Investigations. Letters of Request are sometimes received for the purpose of obtaining information in connexion with a criminal investigation for the use of the examining magistrate rather than for the purpose of the actual trial. In these cases it is sometimes more convenient that enquiries should be made by the English police and statements taken by them from witnesses, than that sworn evidence should be taken by a magistrate or justice of the peace, and they are often likely to be more informative and satisfactory for this purpose than evidence formally taken. Letters of Request of this kind are therefore sometimes executed by the police in this way. Annex 1. Extract from Extradition Act, 1870. Power of Foreign State to obtain Evidence in United Kingdom. 24. The testimony of any witness may be obtained in relation to any criminal matter pending in any court or tribunal in a foreign State in like manner as it may be obtained in relation to any civil matter under the Act of the session of the nineteenth and twentieth years of the reign of Her present Majesty, chapter one hundred and thirteen, intituled “ An Act to provide for taking evidence in Her Majesty’s Dominions in relation to civil and commercial matters pending before foreign tribunals”; and all the provisions of that Act shall be construed as if the term civil matter included a criminal matter, and the term cause included a proceeding against a criminal : Provided that nothing in this section shall apply in the case of any criminal matter of a political character. Annex 2. Extract from Extradition Act, 1873. Section 5. A Secretary of State may, by order under his hand and seal, require a police magistrate or a justice of the peace to take evidence for the purposes of any criminal matter pending in any court or tribunal in any foreign State; and the police magistrate or justice of the peace, upon the receipt of such order, shall take the evidence of every witness appearing before him for the purpose in like manner as if such witness appeared on a charge against some defendant for an indictable offence, and shall certify at the foot of the depositions so taken that such evidence was taken before him, and shall transmit the same to the Secretary of State; such evidence may be taken in the presence or absence of the person charged, if any, and the fact of such presence or absence shall be stated in such deposition.MEMORANDUM AS TO THE OBTAINING OF EVIDENCE IN ENGLAND FOR FOREIGN TRIBUNALS IN CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MATTERS. THIS memorandum applies in particular to the obtaining of evidence for tribunals of a foreign country with which no civil procedure convention has been concluded. Where a request is received from a country with which a convention is in force, then the matter is governed primarily by the terms of that convention. 2. Foreign tribunals are at liberty, if their own procedure admits such a course, to obtain evidence in Fngland without any recourse to the authorities of this country, as, for instance, by making an order appointing some person in England, such as a consular officer of their own country, to obtain the evidence they require. In such a case, the person so appointed may request individuals to appear before him and give evidence or produce documents, but he will have no compulsory pow T ers. 3. Ihe English courts offer every facility for the assistance of the courts or tribunals of other countries in the taking of evidence for the purposes of civil or commercial matters pending before such courts or tribunals. The powers of the English courts to obtain evidence for the assistance of the courts or tribunals of other countries are derived from the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856 (19 and 20 Viet., c. 113), and the procedure is governed by Order XXXVII, Rules 54 to 60, of the Rules of the Supreme Court (England). For convenience of reference the provisions of the Act and Rules above mentioned are reproduced in Annex 1 of this memorandum. It will be observed that the authority of the English courts is confined solely to obtaining the testimony of a witness or witnesses in England, and the production of documents in the possession of such witnesses. The English courts have no authority to appoint experts to give evidence or to do anv judicial act in this connexion other than obtaining the testimony of persons in England (or the production of documents in their possession) who are named by the foreign court by which the evidence is required. 4. Ihe first requirement when application for the assistance of the English courts is made under the Act or rules is that the English court should be satisfied by evidence (1) that the matter in respect of which the evidence is required is a civil or commercial matter, (2) that it is pending before a court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction in a foreign country, and (3) that such court or tribunal is desirous of obtaining, by the assistance of the English courts, the evidence which the English court is asked to obtain. 5. There are two methods of proof specified in Rule 54 for satisfying the English court on these points. Though these methods are not made exclusive by the rules, it is certainly advisable that one or the other should be employed. These methods are :— (a.) A certificate of the matters above mentioned under the hand of an Ambassador, Minister or other diplomatic representative, received as such by His Majesty, of the foreign country whose court desires the evidence. Where there is no diplomatic representative the certificate of the consul-general or consul of such foreign country will be accepted. Such certificate is accepted by the court as evidence of the matters so certified, and does not require any further authentication. (5.) A Letter of Request issued by the foreign court by which the evidence is required. If the Letter of Request is sealed with the seal of the foreign court, or, if the court has no seal, is signed by a judge of the foreign court with a certificate that the court has no seal, it is accepted as evidence without further authentication. Where it is desired that the procedure mentioned in paragraph 7 (b) below should be followed, that is to say, where it is desired that the evidence should be obtained without any action by the agents of the parties to the action or matter in the foreign court, it is essential that a letter of request should be issued. In other cases this is not essential. 6. Where Letters of Request are issued by a foreign court for the purpose of obtaining evidence of witnesses in England, such letters should be addressed to the 5003 [19776]2 High Court of Justice, and should certify all the matters mentioned in paragraph 4 above, and should further state the names and addresses of the witnesses whose evidence is required and the documents (if any) whose production is desired. The Letters of Request should be accompanied by a translation into English. Letters of Request issued by a foreign court may be transmitted to the English court in either of the two following ways :— {a.) By the agents in England of any of the parties to the action or matter in the foreign country,' when making the application referred to in paragraph 7 {a) below. (b.) By the diplomatic channel, i.e., they are transmitted by the diplomatic representatives in England of the foreign country whose court requires the evidence to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and forwarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Senior Master of the Supreme Court of Judicature in England. It is only necessary that Letters of Request should be transmitted through the diplomatic channel, if the court is to be moved in the manner described in 7 (b) below. In other cases it is preferable that they should be transmitted in the manner described in (a) above, but, where the procedure of the foreign court does not permit of such a course being followed, they may always be transmitted through the diplomatic channel. 7. The English court may be set in motion for the purposes of obtaining evidence for a court in a foreign country in two ways :— {a.) By the application to the court by the agents in England of any of the parties to the action or matter in the foreign country; (b.) By the application to the court by the Treasury Solicitor. These two methods are separate and distinct, though they have some features and steps in procedure in common. In the first method the agents in England of the parties to the foreign action or process take part in the proceedings for obtaining the evidence. In the latter method they do not. The first method should be followed whenever possible (see paragraph 9 below). These two methods will now be described separately. 8. (a.) Application to the Court by the Agents of the Parties. (i.) The procedure in these cases is governed by Rules 54 to 58 of Order XXXVII of the Rules of the Supreme Court (England), to which reference has already been made. The agent in England of any of the parties to the foreign action makes an ex parte application to the High Court, producing the evidence described above in paragraph 4, i.e., either a certificate of the appropriate diplomatic representative in this country, or a Letter of Request. In the case where a Letter of Request has been transmitted to the court by the diplomatic channel, such agent will make his application after communication with the Senior Master, by whom the Letter of Request has been previously received. (ii.) The English court, when in possession of the evidence mentioned above, makes the orders necessary for the obtaining of the evidence required. Some qualified person is appointed examiner, and a time and place are fixed for the attendance of the witnesses and orders made for their attendance. The pei son appointed examiner will in general be any duly qualified person named by the applicants or in the Letter of Request from the foreign court such as a consular officer of the foreign country concerned; if no duly qualified person is named, the English court will direct the examination to be taken before one of its own official examiners. Notice must be given of the time and place of the examination and of the names of the witnesses to be examined by the agent of the party at whose instance the application foi the evidence has been made to the agents m England, if any of any other parties to the foreign action, in order that they may, if they so desire, be present at the examination. (iii.) Subject to what is stated to the contrary in sub-paragraphs (iv) and (v) as to cases when some other special procedure is desired by the foreign court, the evidence is taken according to English procedure, that is to say, the witnesses aresworn and questions are asked of the witnesses by the agents of the party desiring the evidence; the witnesses may then be cross-examined by the agents of the other parties to the action, and re-examined by the party by whom they were originally called. The answers given by the witnesses in examination-in-chief, cross- examination and re-examination are recorded by the examiner in writing. Witnesses may likewise be ordered to produce documents. No witness can, however, be compelled to answer any question or to produce any documents in such examination which he could not be compelled to answer or produce if he were a witness in a similar case pending before the English courts. (iv.) The evidence so taken is not, however, limited to matters which would be admissible in the English courts. Effect is given to the rules of admissibility of evidence in the foreign court, so far as they are known, and where they are not known whatever questions may be expected to throw light on the matters in issue are admitted, without any strict regard to the English rules of admissibility. (v.) Where a Letter of Request expresses a desire that the evidence should be taken in some special manner (such as when a prepared list of interrogations is transmitted or it is desired that the witnesses should answer in writing or without being sworn), or signifies that some special manner is in accordance with the practice or requirements of the foreign court from which the request is issued, this special manner will be adopted in obtaining the evidence as far as possible. If any reference is made in the request to any foreign code of law or procedure, copies of the relevant articles of the code with English or French translations should be enclosed. Where specified interrogations are transmitted, the examiner is generally empowered to allow additional questions to be put to the witnesses, if such a course seems desirable in order to give full effect to the wishes of the foreign court, unless the foreign court expresses a wish to the contrary. (vi.) The examiner, at the conclusion of his examination, forwards the depositions of the evidence taken to the Senior Master of the Supreme Court, and the latter certifies the same and causes them to be sealed with the seal of the Supreme Court. Then the Senior Master causes the depositions to be transmitted to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, who forwards them to the diplomatic representative of the country concerned. (vii.) Witnesses attending for examination are entitled under English procedure to certain allowances, and a fee is payable to the examiner appointed. These and any other expenses of the examination are defrayed by the agents of the parties making the application for examination. (b.) Application to the Court by the Treasury Solicitor. (i.) The procedure in these cases is governed by Rule 60. As stated in paragraphs 5 and 6 above, if this procedure is desired, it is essential that the foreign court desiring the evidence should issue a letter of request and that the letter of request should be transmitted through the diplomatic channel. It is also necessary that the letter of request, or the communication from the diplomatic representative of the country concerned to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs under cover of which the request is forwarded, should express the desire that the evidence should be taken without the intervention of the agents of the parties to the action or matter in connexion with which the evidence is desired. Further, in addition to the matters specified above in paragraph 6, the letter of request should contain detailed interrogatories, if possible, or otherwise detailed explanations, of the points on which the witnesses are desired to be examined and the points at issue in the action for which the evidence is required. This is necessary in these cases in order that the English authorities may be able to execute the request satisfactorily, since the agents of the parties will not be present to assist the court. (ii.) The letter of request, if the requirements set out in the preceding paragraph are complied with and if the case appears to be a proper case for the application of this procedure (see paragraph 9 below), is then forwarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Senior Master of the Supreme Court with an intimation that it is desirable that effect should be given to it without requiring an application to Ido made to the court by the agents in England of the parties to the action or matter in the foreign country. The Senior Master, on its receipt, transmits the letter of request to the Treasury Solicitor, who will thereupon, unless he considers that the case is not a proper one for the application of this [19776] b 24 procedure, make the necessary application to the court, which thereupon makes the orders necessary for obtaining the evidence required. The procedure followed thereafter is generally the same as that described in part {a) of this paragraph, sub-paragraphs (ii), (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi), except that no notice is sent to the agents of the parties who do not appear or take part in the proceedings. (iii.) Repayment of the expenses incurred in obtaining the evidence required, by reason of the allowances due to witnesses and fee due to the examiner under the English rules of procedure, is claimed from the diplomatic representative by whom the letter of request was transmitted when the depositions are transmitted to him. Repayment of these expenses can only be waived when the party in the foreign action or matter on whose behalf the evidence is desired has been admitted to sue or defend in forma pauperis and a special request for their waiver on this ground is made. In this case a certificate that such party is proceeding in the foreign court in forma pauperis is required. No repayment is claimed in respect of the services of the Treasury Solicitors or in respect of court fees. Of the two methods of procedure described above in (a) and (b) of the preceding paragraph, it is always desirable that the former, (a), should be used whenever possible. The procedure described under (b) should only be used in exceptional cases, such as cases in which the procedure of the foreign court desiring the evidence does not allow of the interposition of agents of the parties in the obtaining of evidence, or when it is not reasonably possible for the parties to the foreign action to appoint agents in this country for the purpose. This procedure can only be used in simple cases not involving great expenditure of time or money, and cannot be used when it is desired that the agents of the parties should appear and take part in the examination or in cases where any examination of expert witnesses is required or the examination of registers of companies or firms, e.g., the Registry of Joint Stock Companies at Somerset House.

(In cases covered by a Civil Procedure Convention applying to Scotland or Northern Ireland this Memorandum should be read with and subject to the Convention.) 1. THIS memorandum is supplementary to and should be read with the memorandum relating to the obtaining of evidence in England (hereinafter referred to as the principal memorandum). Its purpose is to explain points on which the procedure in Scotland and Northern Ireland differs from that in force in England. In so far as any point is not specifically mentioned in this memorandum, the information in the principal memorandum may be taken as being generally applicable, mutatis mutandis, to Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856, is in force both in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Scotland. 2. — (a) In Scotland for the purposes of the matters dealt with in the present memorandum : The Court of Session takes the place of the High Court of Justice in England. (b) With reference to paragraph 6 (b) of the principal memorandum, letters of Request addressed to the Scottish Courts are forwarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and by the latter to the Lord Advocate. (c) With reference to paragraph 8 (a) (i) of the principal memorandum, in Scotland an application should be made by the agent of any of the parties to the Inner House. If further information as to the procedure in Scotland is required, reference may be made to Maclaren’s Court of Session Practice, Chapter IV of Part X, p. 1085-6. In Scotland, the rules which correspond to the Rules of the Supreme Court in England are called “ Acts of Sederunt,” but no special Act of Sederunt lias been made with regard to the taking of evidence for foreign tribunals under the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act, 1856. (d) With reference to paragraph 8 (a) (ii) of the principal memorandum, the Court of Session appoints a “ Commissioner ” to take the evidence; a Sheriff Substitute is usually appointed. (e) With reference to paragraph 8 (a) (vi), the Commissioner, at the con clusion of the examination, forwards the depositions to the Crown Agent, by whom they are transmitted through the Lord Advocate to the Secretary of State for Scotland and by the latter to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. (/) With reference to paragraph 8 (b) (i) of the principal memorandum, there is no special Act of Sederunt governing the matter in Scotland (see paragraph (c) above). (g) With reference to paragraph 8 (b) (ii), the letter of request is forwarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State for Scotland, and by the latter to the Lord Advocate, who makes the necessary application to the Court of Session. At the proceedings before the Commissioner by whom the evidence is taken, the Procurator Fiscal for the District, acting on the instructions of the Crown Office, fulfils the functions which in the corresponding case are performed in England by the Treasury Solicitor. 5879b [5442]Northern Ireland. 3.— (a) With reference to paragraphs 3, 8 (a) (i) and 8 (h) (i) of the principal memorandum, the procedure in Northern Ireland is governed by Order XXXVII, Rules 40 to 48, which are to be found in the volume of Statutory Rules and Orders for 1908 (pages 953^). These rules are, generally speaking, similar to the corresponding English rules, which form Annex 2 to the Principal Memorandum. (2) For the purposes of the matters dealt with in the memorandtim in Northern Ireland, the officer of the Court exercising the functions of the Senior Master in England is the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern Ireland, and the functions of the Treasury Solicitor are performed by the Chief CroAvn Solicitor for Northern Ireland. (3) With reference to paragraph 6 (h) and paragraph 8 (h) (ii) of the memorandum relating to England, the letters of request addressed to the courts of Northern Ireland are forwarded by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to the Secretary of State for the Home Department, and by the latter to the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Judicature of Northern IrelandNo.844-3. of 1931 I INDEXED No.844-S. 1 v™• j 4-^ ' a ''v7 &lt; | ' 694 of 1931. j C* , A copy of the undermentioned paper is forwarded to the Government of India for information reference this office letter No.804-3 of the 24th Novemher 1931. 2.

Needless to say I did not inform His Excellency of the Persian Government's request for service on him of the judicial notice issued by the Bushire Court. 4.

Dated the 28th Rajah 1550 (8th December 1931). After compliments, tfith the hand of pleasure I have received your letter No.956 dated the 24th instant and noted the contents of the letter which you have received from the Secretary to the Hon’hie the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire, regarding the complaint made hy Ivaz Dagnayegi of Buskire against Abdul Karim bin Uryan, for the debt which the latter owes him. I beg to inform you that the said Ivaz came to Kuwait in the month of Jamad Auwal 1346 (October 1928) and made a complaint claiming that Abdul Karim Uryan owed him some money. Both were summoned and the defendant acknow ledged same, but said that he was poor. We, however, were not satisfied with this reply and pressed on him to come to a settlement with his creditor giving him a period of grace of a fewjdays to enable him to do so, but he failed and we ordered him to be put in prison. His adversary in the meanwhile opened a tailoring shop here in Kuwait, while the defendant remained three months in prison. Next some of his (the defendant's) relatives collected some money in the form of a subscription from the people of Kuwait which came to Rs.170/- which was paid to the siaa Ivaz, and Abdul Karim consequently was released. They (the relatives) then arranged between themselvesthemselves to let the Diwan ( a small house adjacent to the original one) and pay its rent monthly to Ivaz, who had already received Rs.20/- (included in the ahoveiuentioned sum of Rs.170/-) as advance of the rent. But Uryan and his 'brother’s heirs, 'being all widows and children who had nohody to support them, and who were in the greatest need of money, objected to the payment 'by Abdul Karim of the rent of the Diwan to the creditor, because he owned only one share out of many in the house and Diwan. Abdul Karim then decided to sell his share in the house and Diwan and pay his debt, and to that end asked our permission, and we permitted him to do so. The property was accordingly put up for auction sale for many days on end, but it fetched a very low price and the heirs refused to sell it (at the figure offered). Abdul Karim is now in Ma*shur(Persia) living on the help of his relatives there. He owes money to the people of Kuwait. The property accordingly has been again offered for sale, and when it is eventually sold, Abdul X'arim's share will be divided amongst his creditors, of whom Ivaz is one. As to Ivaz’ statement that we confiscated the house and fixed a rent of Rs.9/- p.m. for it stating that if the debtor failed to pay this rent, we shall definitely appropriate the house for ourselves and pay the debt in full, this is entirely untrue, nor did we ever make such a suggestion at all. As to the question of nationality, Abdul Karim is a Kuwait subject, and Ivaz pretends to be a Persian subject.

Sir, I transmit to you, herewith a copy of a note-verbale that I have received from the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs regarding the service of a judicial notification upon the Sheikh of Kuwait. I also enclose a summary trans lation of the notification, together with one of the three originals, the second having Been sent direct to the Honourable the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and the third retained here. The notification is issued at the instance of one Ustad Evaz Daghayeqi who complains that the Sheikh undertook to recover a debt owed to Ustad Evaz by a certain Abdul Karim Haji Uryan and has not done so. The Political Resident may be able to ascertain the nationality of the creditor and debtor. 2. I should exulain that these notifications are frequently issued in Persia. They are in the nature of enquiries addressed by claimants of any kind, through the judicial authorities, to the persons against whom their claim or complaint is directed, the object being to achieve a settlement without incurring the expenses which a regular law-suit would entail and which would have to be paid in the last resort by the defendant if the claim or complaint were substantiated. It is not obligatory upon the person who receives the notification to make any reply, but he must if he is amenable to the jurisdiction of the Persian Courts, sign The Foreign Secretary to the Government of India, New Delhi.2i / r'i ^ / / W ^ &lt;L. i . . sign two of the copies and return them to the judicial authorities. 3. It seems to me unlikely that the Sheikh of Kuwait, as the head of a State, would consent to accept service of a judicial document of any kind, particularly when the document emanates from the judicial authorities of a Government hy which he is not recognised. Moreover he is not, or ought not to he, amenable to the jurisdiction of the Persian Courts and unless he possesses property in Persia he will not be so in practice. I therefore propose, subject to the approval of His Majesty s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, to reply that as the Sheikh is the head of a State, I cannot undertake to transmit any judicial document for service upon him. 4. If the Government of India concur in this proposal, and it is approved by the Secretary of State, I shall be glad to receive back in due course the copies of the notification which I have sent to you and the Political Resident. 5. My proposal does not rule out the possibility that Ustad Evaz may have good grounds for his complaint and I should be glad, if the Government of India see no objection, if the Political Resident could ascertain the circumstances through the Political Agent at Kuwait. 6. I should also be glad to receive the views of the Government of India upon the legal position which would arise if Ustad Evaz were to address a further notification to Abdul Karim: and in general to learn whether the service of judicial documents emanating from Persian authorities can be effected, through the Political Agent resident in Kuwait upon persons resident in Kuwait who are (a) Kuwaitis (b) Persian subjects and (c) of other nationalities. The answersanswers would presumably cover all the Arab States upon the Persian Gulf with whom His Majesty’s Government in the United Kingdom and the Government of India are in special treaty relations. 7. I have sent a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have, etc., (Sgd.) R.H. Hoare.Prom the Persian Ministry for Foreign Affairs addressed to His Majesty f s Legation* Dated Mehr IBth 1310 (October* 11th 1931) No. 24386/210285411. Memorandum The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of the Imperial Government has the honour to inform the honourable Legation that the Ministry of Justice have sent to this Ministry under cover of a letter three statements issued by the ’’Adlieh” (Justice) in Bushire to be served on Agha Sheikh Ahmed, the Vali of Kuwait with the request that the service of the same may be effected on the Sheikh through the British Consulate-General in Bushire who are in relations with Kuwait. The documents in question are sent herewith with the request that two copies of the same duly signed and endorsed with the date on which the service is effected and with a reply entered on the column opposite may be returned so that they may be sent back to the Ministry of Justice. (Sealed) Ministry for F. Affairs.(34 The attached documents consist of a notification in triplicate issued through the Court of Justice in Bushire by the tailor Ustad Evaz Daghayeqi of Bushire against His Excellency Haji Sheikh Ahmad, Sheikh of Kuwait, a Kuwait National, to the following effect : ’’That on the complaint of Ustad Evaz against Abdul Karim Haji Uryan, the Sheikh of Kuwait arrested the latter who ^subsequently arranged to pay Ustad Evaz’ claim during one year. As security for the enforcement of this arrangement the house of the debtor was confiscated by the Sheikh who fixed a rent of Rupees 8 per mensem for the same stating that.if the debtor failed to fulfill his promise, he (the Sheikh) will definitely self-appropriate the house and pay the debt. Three years instead of one year have now elapsed since this arrangement and none of the three petitions of Ustad Evaz to the Sheikh has been favoured with a reply. Ustad Evaz now requests to know what the Sheikh has done in order to collect this debt. The writer requests that the result of the steps of the Sheikh may be written by himself on the opposite column and returned to him”. These notifications are usually issued by claimants on persons amenable to Persian jurisdiction with the purpose that the debtor may keep one copy and write a reply on the two other copies and send them back to the claimant thiough the court. The matter of sending a reply on the two copies is optional but the signature and return of two of the copies through the court is obligatory for those amenable to Persian jurisdiction. The idea is to try to get the claimnotification. Translator. claim settled before the claimant will have to incur proper law-suit expenses - redeemable eventually from the debtor if he loses the law-suit. On certain occasions, the claimant who has not probably very binding evidence from the debtor tries to get some sort of evidence from him through this</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000126_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/12/3730</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000648.0x000126</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/12/3730</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>Coll 30/19 'Persian Gulf: Kuwait and Muscat, Persian Request for Service of Judicial Documents upon Persons Resident in'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1931/1933</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-12-14T22:22:57</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (84 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 86; these numbers are written in pencil and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains correspondence between British officials concerning the legality, political context and practicalities involved in the possible extradition of a number of individuals, primarily Persian subjects, from Kuwait and Muscat to Persia at request of the Government of Persia.
