Last week I discussed with you the possibility of making a joint settlement on the purchasing of fish trap No. 2 in the Sitrah channel, by the Shaikh of Bahrein and the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited. My reasons for making this suggestion is that the Bahrein Government have declared the channel to be Government property and the right to use it is open to all navigation, not only own own, but all commercial firms and dhows. Since fish trap No. 2 is located in othis channel, it is the Company 1 s opinion that the Bahrein Government should consider paying at least a portion of the purchase of this trap. The Company are willing to pay a portion, particu-Larly since they used the channel prior to it being declared a Government right of way. May I have your reaction on a settlement on this basis? If we can come to some definite settlement on fish trap No. 2, we can see no reason to make further negotiation for other fish traps on the shore side of the channel at this time. We would also like to have the assurance that no further fish traps can ebe erected on the shore side of the channel as each time they are erectad the owners make a claim against the Company if any damage is done. Thanking you for your co-operation, I am, etc. S.Z.$&gt; ■ /O Bo.

Dear Sir, LTfectivu 15th Septaaber 1941, the Bahrein letroleusi Goaiiany Limited find it necessary to reduce the production of the Bahrein Field to approximtely 15,000 'barrels gross per day, and likewise reduce the Kefinery running. The President of our Coaapany in New York has requested this reduction for the following reasons. On account of war conditions and drastic rationing of petroloun products which liave 'been in effect in Australia, New Zealand and India for sotne time, sales Iktve decreased. Further, the cotqplete cessation of shipments to China, consumption has decreased 30£ to 50X in the above countries. We ret^ret the necessity of reducing the Befinery running and also the necessity of reducing oruae oil production in Bahrein. This reduction should be mde insnediately. Actually, from an econoadc business view point, this reduction should have been made more than a year ago, but have been hoping for sorae change which would alter the position, but this seams unlikely in the near future anl the possibilities are that further curtailment aay be necessary if hostilities continue.

These contours are based on very scant data, but we believe that they will be sufficiently accurate for your present requirements. In order to amolify the data shown on the maps, we have also preoared end are enclosing a cross-section on the three wells - Zellak T ell Wo.15), Suliman Harden and Subiliyat. These data indicate that only 20 , -0 w of surface pipe is necessary in this area to obtain an effective shut-off provided the pipe is properly driven in the clay member above Zone A water. If Zone A water is penetrated before surface pipe is run, an effective shut-off may not be obtained. The data also sho 1 that a total depth of approximately 200* will provide full penetration of Zone B water. Any increase in water obtained from below this depth will be from Z-one C. The water indigenous to Zone C will have a high salt content and, in all probability, a sulphurous odor. The production of water from Zone C through a well which is open to Zone A and/or Zone B may contaminate the water in these latter Zones. e would lik»5 to take this opportunity of stating that we believe the separation and selective production frcr individual zones is a prerequisite to the control of water production and the acquisition of useful data. The pursual of this policy would be expensive and probably beyond the ability of the local drilling contractors. Such a policy, however, will govern the completion practice of all future Company water wells.

D.O. No. 2216/20. Bahrain, November 18, 1941. Dear Alban, With reference to our conversation this morning about oil. As you know the Manager of the Bahrain Petroleum Company informed us that the company has been compelled to reduce oil production by about one quarter which will have a serious effect on the State T s revenue and His Highness's income. We have not been told the reasons making this step necessary except that it is owing to the war. In India petrol rationing has been enforced in order to enable the government to build up oil reserves. Recently I read in one of the Indian papers a statement that no relaxation of the rationing could be contemplated as the government had not yet built up sufficient reserves. This was published to contradict some incorrect state ments that petrol rationing was to be relaxed. Here in Bahrain v/e have quantities of oil; Bahrain is the nearest oil producing area to the east side of India, petrol is required in India, yet production is being slowed down in Bahrain. The position appears illogical to people who are not acquainted with oil poli tics and exchange matters. Would it be possible to ask the company to explain fully the reasons which make it p necessary to reduce production of Bahrain oil; We should like to know whether it is owing to difficulties of ship ping, exchange or market agreements. Yours sincerely. Major R.G.S.W. Alban, O.B.E. , yf^) s //arrtyrr H.B.M's Political Agent, C Bahrain.

OIL SHIPISITTS Dear Major Alban, V /ith further reference to your letter J...-G/1C9C of the 19th November and my reply of the 20th, following are the comments received from Mr* Ilerron, the Ire^ident our Company;- ^Ist. Large decrease in consumption in ::: India, Australia and New Zealand which is due principally to rationing. '2nd. Shortage of tankers which in turn causes rationing. n Exchange or market agreement has nothing to do with decreased refinery operations or export of oil from Bahrein. On account of Bahrein being closer to India and Africa than Abadan we now have the matter under discussion with British Oil Companies to the effect that 1^ Bahrein should operate full capacity to save tankers' time, but naturally friends located at ^ the Head of the Culf reluctant to further reduce their operations in order to accomplish the above. Can see no objection to the lolitical Ar-ent or His Highness bringing the above matter to the attention of the India Office and H.IJs Government . ,T Obviously the ''friends located at the :Iead of the Gulf M are the Anglo-Iranian Company.

V Dear Sir, t ) In my conversation recently we discussed the Iroject which is under consideration to increase the Mcilities for hauling crude oil 'between Arabia and Bahrein. In connection with this work it will 'be necessary to re-chart and mark the channel 'between Arabia and our crude port of entry, Zellaq_, setting navigational aids at points round necessary. It is possible that when these markers are established they may be found to be an improvement over the present channel we have been using for the regular transportation of crude from Arabia to Zellaq. and wb may wish to use this new route for our water transportation. These navigation aids are similar to those now installed and will in no way interfere with navigation, fish traps or other utilities at Zellaq.. Hay we have your permission to make this survey and erect the necessary markers? f, ¥e cannot give you a detailed map of the location of these markers at this time as soundings will have to be taken to determine the most suitable spots to place the markers.

The tests carried out in August 1941, and which were conducted OTer a period of two weeks, produced no evidence of interference. These tests, like other single pieces of eridence, need not be sccepted aa conclusive proof that interference does not exist. We believe, however, from the number of such pieces of evidence, all pointing to the absence of interference, that the production of water from r 'ater ' ell No. 18 will not affect the productivity of the natural springs. The result of the August 1941 tests together with all our information on the subject, will be compiled and submitted to you as soon as possible in the form of a separate report, tfhen you are in possession of these data you will then be in a poaition to further discuss the question of the pipe line reservation (OR-SO Parcel 26). The gauging apparatus which was installed at the two springs to facilitat* the conduct of the tests haa now been removed with the exception of the concrete abuttments which do not interfere in any way with the flow of water. These abuttments may be useful at some future date and we would be glad to receive your permission to keep them in place. Yours very truly, M. H. LI pp. ¥. H.

Memorandum Reference Agency Printed letter No.C/982-10/1 dated the 17th December 1940* 2« During the recent absence on leave of Dr. Kennedy, Mr. Llpp, the General Manager, was allowed to act as Chief Local Representative In his place. During this period. It was found that matters between the Company and this Agency were much more expeditiously disposed of than previously and It Is suggested that, as a war measure and In order to facilitate the transaction of business. Mr. Llpp may be allowed to act as Chief Local Representative In addition to being General Manager. This arrangement might be personal to Mr. Llpp only and subject to revision should he be succeeded by another. 3. It Is noted that His Majesty's Government attach considerable Importance to the Company^ Chief Local Repre- sentatlve being a British subject and persona grata to them In order to ensure harmonious relations between the Company and the Bahrain population and the local authorities and also /-(f) - 2 • &lt;1 &lt;■'' .«fi- ^ It also owing to the special treaty relations existing (vide paragraph No.3 of Colonial Office letter No*lB301/33 dated the 31st July 1933 forwarded to this Agency under Bushire Printed letter No.1038-3 dated the 17th August 1933). But I do not anticipate any interference with these aIras f rather the reverse since Mr. Lipp is a most conscientious man who carefully guards his Company's good name. A further matter for consideration is that the General Manager is the only man on the spot in whom real authority vests and it is therefore somewhat tiresome and irrelevant being compelled to deal with a go-between who is not a responsible official.

I assured him that there was of course nothing personal in the matter and that the change was merely a war measure designed to shorten channel of communication. 4. I feel however that he is discontented and it is likely that he will take up the matter with Thornburg from whom he says he had some authority to challenge Lipp's actions if he thought necessary. 6.

The history of the fish traps in the Liitrah channel dates 'back to 1953 when the Tirst Jetty -built. In your letter Ho. 664/G m L*i&gt;* dated January 1954 to the Coajpanyi it is recorded that Sheikh 24th, II II I M rbrahooa 'bin Khalid su^^estoii that the possa^ at Sitrah from the shore to the . ler 'bo marked ao that 'boats using it need not cross the traps# Channel aarkers vrere then placed in the ohsrgifl and a map drawn showing tho channel U»e ^-^chiUt BR-371) • You will note frro this original 2 and 3 wero the only onaa that passjige. J juim w ^ w r * / • mp that Trape 'os. 6, obatruetod the channol During the early construction of the Kaflnery coosldera'blo aateriela ware transrojrbad throu^ the otiannel arki the traps TOre 'being continually knocked own by this heavy freig vt bar&amp;lng. The Company thought it would be fair to all concerned to rent the various traps affeotod, particularly during this tinxii so in 1936 t':ey rented 12 fish traps, Nos. 2 to 12, as shown on the Company mp HP.-510. In 1937-1938 only six traps wero rented, Nos. 2, 3, 4. S, 7 and Al Ohaxirah. In iisroh 1939 trap Mo. 6 was 'bouiiht outright frora Abdullah bin 'Xohaaa^ OJareb for a price of 53 1,600 and. we rented trups Kos. 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. At the tine trap Ko. 6 was imrohased wo paid a prioy excessive to its true value, but this is a matter that cannot be reversed now.liHUKi* ♦ K 22nd July. 1941. After tiie heavy construction of pipeline and 'barging ms finiahad, the Company could not see fit to oontinuo renting the fish traps as the hazard of damaflnt: the traps had 'been greatly reduced. In 1938, in our letter PA-395, we asked for a definite channel of approxliaately 200 f wide to 'be run with markers on either side. This oonccsalon \ms granted ty the Bahrein Governraont ctnd wo placed nsarirojrs in the cliannel and notified the Bahrein Govemaent Uiat in addition to Iniyine Ho. 6 trap we would like to purchase No. 2 and No. 5. You will note fms I2ap HB-510 that the oh nnel nx.ueatod detours around traps No. 2 and Ho. 3 and in fact departs froa the natural deep water channel into rather shallow 'sater. Tliis wa8 cionu Ixioauso it v^aa found difficult at Viat tine to i^urchase traps No* 2 and No. 3 and wo wished to proceed with estafcliahine: and rsarfcinG soao sort of channel and not wait ^HjnCine further wearlnoae intoraim'ble necotiatlona. The owners of Ko. 3 trap would not sell witliout selling IJo. 1 trap. The price su^estod for Ko. 2 trap was, in our o;irdon, (juite excessive. It is well to point out that 'by this tiao, traps No. 1 and No. 3 had disappeared and only No. 2 remained. 3y the time mrkers ware installed outlining the proposed channel route, a fish trap had 'been errecte&lt;' in the il xilQ of the detour. This trap is shown on iS^p BR-510/1 dated JUly 16, 1940. This trap disappeared soae months later and has not 'been re-err acted. rollo-^ing this occuiTence, the Conpany erected a rnsonry marker on the northerly aide of the deep ^ter natural channel near trap ^o. 2, so that in the event it was possible to establish a channel in that area, wo would have the marker erected ahead of ti®e. miring the latter part of 1940, fish trap No. 2 clisap,'earec in addition to No. 1 and No. 3 and we used the natural channel wit out o'bstructlons. Offers were made to purchase the sites of traps Ko. 1, 2 and 3 and thus cioar the way to ostahlishinr. a channel in the desireci local - on. Nothing cane of this. On June 29th your letter 530/21-A stated that Sheikh KhaliTah advises the heirs to trap Mo. 2 wore fcing to replace it in the channel and that if V is • trup i i t or d&amp;aaged he was to l&gt;e notified izatiedlately. )n placing Ko. 2 'b ck in the channel the win^s of the trap havo 'boon broadened out so that the passage of our freigtit and Doats leaving the pier have 'been hampered and it is icraossihle for us to transport materials anu launches through the channel with the trap as it now exists. le have found tiiat during the entire period we rented the traps the owners would rel&gt;uilu them oven if we were paying rental and we now find tliat Ko. 6 trap, whichFA*432• - 3 - 22al July, 1941. was purcfcasal 'by us in good faith, has again 'boon replaced in the channel aadL is obstructing the passac© of 'boats • Also, we hare noted that the owners or operators are prone to shift the traps frai ona location to another. It is essential that the channel 'be open for Cospany transportation to and from ships for it is Just as essential to operate freight am launches as any of our other varied operations and again wo apply to you to facilitate negotiations which will permit us to pure:.. .00 the traps which are now obstructing the channel. After the purchase of those traps is complete we ask that a restraint onier 'bo placed against the former owners that they cannot retmild than in the chaimol. We hereby apply to have you give us a fair pnrchast? price on traps *108• 1, 2 and 3. Also, wo would consider purchasing traps numbered XXII, VII, XXIII, and XXIV as shown on Jap BK-510/2 dated July 6, 1941. The purchase of these four traps is not essential 'but nay 'be desirable in order to clear oocxpl^ely the area. Following the purchase ana removal of these traps we would rejuest a restraining order from the Bahrein Govern- riant restraining any person from reestablishing tra^s at any future date within the channel saarkors as shown on Map BH -510 /2 or within the area of the Corapany reservation GE.llA shown on this laap. Article 2 of our Incase Asreorstut states that the 3hoikh will assist us in purchasing land or property and will see that any such cofapcnsation shall not exceed a fair or reasonable rocoraponse to the Shoiich for the dispossession of his right to the surface of such lands, etc., Also, paragraph 2 of the same article states •The Sheikh also recocnises that the Company have the right to acquire all awl any other lands and buildings necessary for the said purpose with the consent of the proprietors (including the Sheikh in his capacity as private laruowner) on such conlitions as nay b* arranged between the Coapany and the said proprietors without their being allowed to tfake duaands of a nature to surcharge the prices ordinarily current for lands and buildings situated in their respective localities - . It has been mentioned to us that the Company has paid aoro for certain properties than it should have paid and this policy reflects on ot er land nacotiations. Aocordins to our Concession we feel that the Sheikh of Bahrein should protect us, as the Lease ikgretaaent states, if we are paying naore than the right price for property the Sheikh should see that a proper assessment is made. As we have no way of deteraining its true value our only recourse is to appeal to the Sheikh f s appraisal of similar properties.COPY GOVBRNIvISNT OF BAHREIN LAND DEPARTMENT No: 530/21A 5th J/Thani, 1360 29th June, 1941 :&gt; The Chief Local Representative, The Bahrein Petroleum Company LimitecU Dear Sir, With reference to the fish trap question.
