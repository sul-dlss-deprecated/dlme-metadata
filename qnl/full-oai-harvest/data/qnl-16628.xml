Included with the copies are copies in English and Arabic of an earlier letter, dated 20 February 1825, from John Malcolm's predecessor, Mountstuart Elphinstone, to the same recipient. In the attached letter, Malcolm echoes the sentiments of his predecessor (as expressed in the letter from 1825) in discouraging the Imaum from setting out on another expedition against Bahrein [Bahrain]. He concludes by referring the Imaum to Wilson, who has been furnished with the British Government's instructions as to the line of conduct to be pursued. Only the copies, not the original letter of 16 April 1829, are included here.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival item</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673721.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
