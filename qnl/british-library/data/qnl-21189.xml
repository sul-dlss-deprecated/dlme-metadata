The question of obtaining an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government is under consideration and I should be so grateful for your help. 2. The Adviser, though primarily concerned with control of ine btate finances, is necessarily brought into contact with all branches of the administration (judicial, watcn ana ward, excise, oil, air matters and so on). Eis Assistant should, therefore, be a man capable of good work in a rather wide administrative sphere, should be able to get on well with all sorts of people (especially Arabs) \ and mus t be (if I may use the term) a 'Sahib'. 3. fou may remember that I asked you (and also, I think, Busk) about a man named Luard (J.M.Lutrd), who is now working with the Anglo-'ersian Oil Company in Tehran, and I think that you both spoke well of him. Le lias been suggested for the appointment of Assistant to the Adviser and it would be a great help if you would let me know whether you think that he would be suitable in every way. Among other points, does his health seem good ana has he a wife and family (if so, are tney also suitable:)? 4. 1 am sending a copy of this letter to the Political Resident and it would save time if you would kindly send him direct a copy of your reply. *v T * A.

Mr. J.M.Luard.&lt;ftb&gt;rif Confidential . No:C/ 618. Political Agencj, Bahrain, the 20th June 1934. Prom:- Lieut-Coionel Gordon Look,1.A, Political Agent, Bahrain. To:- The Honourable the Political Ilesident in the Persian Gulf, Buahire. Subject:- Appointment of an Assistant to tne Adviser to the Bahrain Government. Sir, I have the honour to recommend the appointment of an Assistant to the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. 2. The Adviser has much more vork than can be performed by one man. Eveiy endeavour has been made to delegate his work to members of the Ruling Family and others, but owing to lack of education there is no one who can undertake a great part of the Adviser’s duties, which include complicated work connected with, for example, oil and air developments and can only be carried out by a man of education and trained intelligence. It is well to remember that Bahrain has sprung in the last decade from complete obscurity and almost bedouin rule to a State administered on modem, if Arab, lines, and the last three years have seen an oil field come into being with all the changes and difficulties which that implies. Protection, control of foreign affairs and jurisdiction over foreigners is in our hands and it is essential to our position that the administration should be properly conducted. 3. Some two years ago it was found necessary, for financial reasons, to dispense with the services of the Commandant of Police and to add responsibility for the train- /ing2 . ing and administration of the Bahrain Armea Police and of the body of Katurs (araed watchmen) to the duties performed by the Adviser, 'iiie present Adviser has done the duties well (and has been able to do them owing to his long experience of Bahrain) but they add a considerable burden to an already overworked post. 4. It is, moreover, inevitable that the work of the Adviser should continue to increase owing to the opening up of Bahrain, to increased means of communication, to the development of an oil field, and to the fact that other neighbouring Govern ments (’Ira^, «ajd and Persia) have adopted to a greater or less extent western methods in conducting their affairs. 5. Mr. Belgrave, the present Adviser, has been gravely overworked, and the grant of the leave, which he is now enjoying, • ' was essential to preserve his health, otherwise 1 should have been loath to agree to the temporary arrangements that have been made. An Assistant is required not only to relieve the Adviser of work, but also to ensure continuity in the absence of the Adviser on leave, which must be given fairly frequently in the climatic and otherwise trying conditions of Bahrain. 5. i would emphasise that the proposed appointment aoes not signify any desire to westernize Bahrain. Un the contrary, though some years ago we were compelled to interfere drastically and to introduce widespread reforms, every endeavour has been made to create an administrative machine suited to and worked by the foiling Family and their people. For example, a kind of Executive Council of the Al Khalifah is gradually coming into being and local men are employed so far as it is possible to do sc in all branches of the administration. 7. The possibility of employing an Arab as Assistant to the Adviser has been considered, but there is no local man suit able for the appointment and it would be most unwise to employ /an/II. 3. an Arab from Syria or elsewhere, as his appointment would arouse a resentment whioh would not be felt in tne case of a British Assistant, and to do so would be politically imprudent because of the special interests which we have in Bahrain. 8. The more important of the terms proposed for the appointment are:- . Pay. Provident Fund. Accommodation. PassageS' Medical Attendance. Termination. Rs.800-50-2,000. Rs.200/- a month. A free furnished house,or an allowance of Rs.100/- a month in lieu thereof. Free passage to the United Kingdom after every 2| years* service at the rate of a second class passage by the Overland Route. At State expense. Three months’ notice on either side. A copy is enclosed of a draft agreement embodying the above terms and the other conditions of the proposed appointment it is based on those executed by the Adviser, the Director of Customs and Port Officer and the late Commandant of Police. 9. It is not easy to fill a post of this kind, for whioh special qualities are needed, but it is proposed offering the appointment to Mr. J.M.Luard, who is at present working for the Anglo-Persian Oil Company Limited in Tehran. Mr. Luard is recommended by the present Adviser and has been well spoken of by members of the Legation in Tehran, from whom fuller enquiries are being made. It is understood that Mr. Luard would be willing to consider the offer if it is made. I would add that his knowledge of oil practice would be of great value to the Bahrain Government. 10. There is no question of any difficulty over the financial side of the appointment, so long as the oil field continues in commercial production.4. 11. Before he went on leave, the Ahvieer consulted His Excellency Shaikh Hamad bin ’isa a 1 Khalifah informally and verbally and I unuerstana that he (the Shaikh) fully agreed that an Assistant to the Aaviser was necessary, but 1 have thought it preferable to ascertain your wishes before making any formal enquiries from the Shaikh.

I have sent you a deal-official letter about the Assistant to the Adviser and I now enclose for your personal information a copy of a letter that I have sent to the Resident and also of the draft agreement. If there are any terms in the draft agreement which you would like altered please let me know. I am asking the Resident to let you know if he agrees to the terms and if the reports on Luard are satisfactory. 3. de Grenier is not entitled under his agreement to Es.100/- a month in lieu of an house. It is a good thing to have the Director of Customs living on the gate of the Customs House but there has been such an appalling dim from lorries and so on that I rather sympathise with their desire to move elsewhere. However, Mrs. de Grenier has gone Horae so that the matter is not perhaps an immediate one. 4. - I am so glad to hear that you are having a pleasant leave.

ATTESTED. for Secretary to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf.From Adviser to THE C Bahrain Gove Dear Colonel .1 December 22nd 1936 Bahrain, Persian Gulf. 9 With reference to our recent conversation on the subject of the appointment of a factor to manage the private property and the accounts of Shaikh Earned, this is to inform you that he has approved of the suggested terms etc. Shaikh Earned would not object to an Indian, when discussing the matter he told me that he thought in many ways an Indian would be suitable as he considered that Indians were on the whole better at accounts and at building work than Arabs. ‘ the household and the privy purse. It is essential that he should have a good knowledge of and experience in dealing with accounts. The accounts themselves are quite simple, they consist of rent collections and the normal expenditure of the*household, payments for building work, agricultural work, cars, petrol etc etc. and distribution of largesse. At present these private accounts are in a state of chaos, large sums of money are being expended daily for which there is no visible return. 4. The factor should have some knowledge of managing property, bazaar property, gardens and date proves. It would be an advantage if he kneu something about animals, camels and horses. It would also be useful if he was capable of supervising building schemes of a simple nature such as constructing new shops and repairing bazaars. Some knowledge of motor cars would also be an advantage, at present there is no check on the amount of petrol which is used by the establishment. 5. Shaikh Earned has approved of the following terms. be taken in the first instance till after completion of two years. Passages, second class passage to country of origin and return once every four years, second class passage from country of origin on taking up appointment and on termination of appointment if 2 The man must be a Moslem, if an Arab is not obtainable The duties of the factor would be to keep the accounts of Pay. Rs 5.00/-P.M. Leave, 45 days after each completed year of service, not to . such termination xs does not coincide with taking of normal leave Agreement to be for four years in the first instance, terminable by two months notice on either side. Free transport will be provided. Free medical attention.F Free accomodation will be provided either at Sakhrir or in Muharraq. Accomodation will not be provided for a family. 6 . I think myself that the man should be fairly young and active. He will have to move about looking at gardens and travelling all over the islands. It is essential that he should be able to speak Arabic but my experience is that Indians who come here and who have learned Persian or Arabic at school are very soon conversant with the language. 1 gather from Shaikh named that he is not very anxious to have him living Vvith him in the house ctl\vciys and as most of his work will ke in the bazaar and in the gardens I think that this is perhaps unnecessary. Shaikh Hamed thinks that it will be almost impossible to find a man who has all tne qualifications v#iiich I have mentioned but in his opinion the most important of them are knowledge of accounts and experience of building.

Could you please refer to (a) of your demi-official letter dated the 14th October 1936 about the question of an Assistant for Belgrade. 2. On a recent visit to Bahrain a suitable opportunity of taking up the matter with the Shaikh occurred as he him- self had written to the Political Agent, suggesting the appointment of an Assistant for Belgrave• as a preliminary step, with Loch and Belgrave, I went into the latter’s work and found that his time was taken up with an immense amount of detail. This detail was mainly under two headsi the State* s accounts, and the Shaikh’s private accounts and general business connected with the Shaikh’s private property. A third direction in which Belgrave had to spend his time to some extent was to supervise buildings. 3 . what ever else the Assistant could, or could not, do it is obvious that he would not be of much use in dealing ,*/ith the above details, and it would of course take time to procure a suitable individual to fill the post. 1 therefore made the suggestions to the Shai&amp;h which are contained in Loch’s letter Ho.0/496—4/3 dated the 23ru - November 193 6 to the Shaikh, copy of which I enclose. These suggestions Belgrave heartily welcomed. 7hen the subordin ate# mentioned in Loch’s letter are appointed much petty work will be taken off Belgrave’s shoulders, and he will have / • JeClauson Esquire, The India office, London*,' / ^ have far more time for his important duties in connection with the supervision of the State, and in otnir directions. Loch* 3 further letter to me, I'io.C/538-4/3 dated the 8 th December 1936 (copy enclosed) shows how the matter now stands and I hope that before very long the three subordinates will be at work. 4. yith regard to the appointment of an Assistant for Belgr&amp;ve, in addition to the three subordinates, I am considering trie question further, and after consulting Loch will let you have my views. * I am sending copies of this letter to Metcalfe and Loch.

With regard to paragraph 4 of my letter No,918-3 of to-day to Glaus on, copy forwarded to you under my Printed letter No. 919-S of today. You will remember that we discussed whether an Assistant to Beigrave, in addition to the three subordinates, was necessary, and I think that to the best of my recollection we were rather doubtful as to whether such an Assistant could be of much use. There is also the question of his pay which in addition to that of the three subordinates would come to a pretty figure. As far qs I recollect we thought that what was needed was the deputation of a Police Officer over a limited period, say, one year, to train the Bahrain police force and particularly some young Shaikh who might be put in charge of the force so that when the Officer left the young Shaikh could take on full command. 3. Please discuss the question of an Assistant with Beigrave and let me have your views. that we can get a move on.

The duties of the Factor would be to keep the accounts of the household and the privy purse* It is essential that he should have a good knowledge of and experience in dealing with accounts. The accounts themselves are quite simple - they consist of rent collections and the normal expenditure of the household, payments for building work, agricultural work, cars, petrol, etcetera, and the distribution of largesse. At present these private accounts ■ are in a state of chaos and large sums of money are being expended daily for which there is no visible return.4* The Factor should have some knowledge of managing property, bazaar property, gardens and date groves. '■ It would be an advantage if he knew something about animals, especially camels and horses. It would also be useful if he was capable of supervising building schemes of a simple nature such as constructing now shops and repairing bazaars. Some knowledge of motor cars would also be an advantage, at present there is no check on the amount of petrol which is used by the establishment. 5. The terms proposed are:- Pay. 'k • 500/- per mensem. leave. 45 days after each completed year of service, not to be taken in the first instance till after completion of two years. Passage. Second class passage to country of origin and return once every four years, second class passage from v i country of origin on taking up appointment and on termination of appointment if such termination does not coincide with taking of normal leave. Agreement to be for four years in the first instance, terminable by two months notice on either side. Free transport will be provided. Free medical attention. Free accommodation will be provided either at S&amp;khir or in Muharrac. Accommodation will not be provided for a ; ~ family. 8. The Shaikh wishes the individual to be a Boslem and, if a suitable Arab is not obtainable, would not object to an Indian: .indeed, when discussing the matter the Shaikh informed the Adviser that he thought that in many ways an Indian would fc&lt; be suitable as he considered that Indians were on the whole better at accounts and building work.3 © 7* It seems desirable to have a fcirly young and active man as he will have to move about looking at gardens and travel all over the islands* It Is essential that he quickly enough and a lack of a fluent knowledge of Arabic need not, therefore, rule out an otherwise suitable Indian* The Shaikh is not anxious for the Factor to live in his house and as most of his work will foe in the gardens and suq, it is perhaps unnecessary that he should do so. The Shaikh thinks that it may be difficult to find a man with ail the qualifications enumerated above, but attaches most importance to a knowledge of accounts and experience of buildings (not high technical knowledge, but enough to watch over simple construction .such as bazaar shops and local houses)• 8. The Shaikh requests your help in making enquiries for a suitable man in Aden, 'fypt, 1 Iraq, Palestine and India* should speak Arabic, but an Indian who had learnt Persian or Arabic at school would probably pick up the language I have the honour to be, Sir, .

Some time ago I wrote, as arranged, to Mr.E.M.Secueira (lately Registrar- of the Bushire Residency) and asked him whether he would, like to be considered for the post of accounts officer. Mr. Sequeira replied that for reasons of health he would be unable to accept. 3. He, however, recommended for the post a Mr. Braganza who was formerly employed in the 1 Iraq Levies, but after consultation with the Adviser to the Bahrain Government, I have come to the conclusion that his qualifications are not those that are required for this post. 4. I hardly think that advertising would prove as satisfactory in the case of the Accounts Officer, as in the case of the Factor and the Public Works Department Officer and would suggest that the Government of India be approached with a view to enquiries being made through the Finance Department.2 © 5# The Bahrain (iovernEent have requested our help in getting a suitable officer on the following terms:- (i) Agreement , In the first place for three years subject after that to renewal by mutual agreement, the first six months to be probationary, the agreement to be terminable by two months notice on either side.

His application and copy of his credentials are enclosed herewith. He gives a favourable impression, looks capable and healthy, is respectably and suitably dressed and is vouched for by one of my staff. He tells me that originally he comes from Indian peasant stock and therefore knows a little about farming. He is married and has five children but is aware of the proviso that if appointed he would have to provide accommodation at his , r ^ / own expense for his wife and children. I cannot, of course, vet him myself as I know no Arabic and very little about Indians.

LOCH,COPY Directorate-General of Police, (C.I.D), Baghdad, 18th March, 1937. Dear Holt, I have just received an S.0.8. from one of my ’old faithfuls 1 , KHAN SAHIB, MANZUR WAHID, who is now hack at his old post in the Punjab Police, asking for my assistance in the matter of a post which he says is vacant under the Political Agent, Bahrein, and for which he says application has been made to the Embassy to recommend a reliable Indian Muslim. For some reason which he does not state, he says that if application is made for his services he will continue to qualify for pension (due in three years time) by himself raying ’pension contributions’, but if he obtains the post by direct application he will not continue to qualify for pension. The upshot of a long story is that he is hoping to get someone to recommend him for the appointment, and to induce the P.A. to apply to the Government of India for his services. He came to Iraq in 1918 (l think), and served under me in the C.I.D. -until he was axed in 1933. All through he did splendid work, often under somewhat unpleasant cir cumstances, and was given the Title of Khan SahiD in 1932 and deserved it. If you could in any way put in a good word lor him I should he most grateful, and the P.A. Bahrain would get a thoroughly good and reliable man. Yours sincerely, (Sd) J.F. Wilkins Captain V.

I have been asked to write to you about one Mian Ataul Haq of Jullundur in the Punjab, who has applied to Belgrave for one of the jobs at Bahrain. He tells me he saw a notice regard ing it in the Papers. All we have to say is that Ataul Haq belongs to a good family,being the son of Sir Abdul Hamid, M. L. A., who was once Chief Minister at Kapurthala. He is a pleasant young man' about 24 years old. According to his own account he was educated at the Aitchison College, Lahore, where he passed the Senior Cambridge examination with credit in all subjects except la tin. He subsequently went to Cambridge for a few months but failed there to pass in Latin and returned to India. He speaks English fluently. Yours sincerely, Sd. W. R.

Though - don’t know him personally my relations know &gt; -V him. I enclose, in original, his replies. From what I know of Spicer I think he would only recommend the right sort of man. I like the sound of this fellow Spencer and knowledge of Arabia is a great advantage. I am writing to a cousin of mine who belongs to County Durham, and is now High Sheriff, asking for particulars about Spencer’s father who comes from those parts. you 516 sounds a possible candidate, on paper, would it be possible for someone at Government House, Jerusalem, to look him ovei if it comes to the point of considering him for the Job ?

The latter is the Editor and Proprietor of the daily Urdu paper 'Hamdam which is published in Lucknow. 3 . Sardar Mohamed was a member of the personal staff of His Highness the Maharaja of Patiala from 1928 to 1932 in which year he was dismissed from the State service, it is believed for mismanagement of funds, and was prohibited from re-entering the State limits. In 1934, he formed a Film Company, the studio of which was situated in one of the northern India towns. His first production, a film styled 'Adal-e-Jehangir', was a failure and the losses he incurred were so great as to render it necessary for him to wind up the Company. About 18 months ago he came to Bombay and commenced to move in 'Movie • circles.. At present he is living with a film star named Miss Bibbo alias Ishrat Sultana, who is on the staff of the Sagar Movietone Film Company, and whose salary is said to be Rs. 1,500/- a monthi^. Sardar Mohomed has stated at various times that he has married Miss Bibbo, but enquiries have failed to substantiate this statement. In view of his past history and present association, and his obviously unstable character, I consider that he is quite unsuitable for appointment to the post referred to in the Government of India's letter.fVinfldenti^X* D#0* C/575-4/3 Dated the 84th July 1937« Many thanks for your demi-official letter Not F# 324-13/57 dated the 3rd July 1937 and its enclosures con cerning Sardar Mohomed Khaliluliah Khan.

Much of this correspondence relates to the hiring of an individual named J M Luard in 1934. This section includes original letters in Arabic from Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, the ruler of Bahrain expressing his approval of this step.2) attempts by British officials to find an appropriate candidate to hire as a 'factor' (or agent) to manage the estate of Shaikh Ḥamad bin ‘Īsá Āl Khalīfah, the ruler of Bahrain. Much of this correspondence relates to the references and backgrounds of a number of Indian candidates for this position.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>National Economy</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003a6#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
