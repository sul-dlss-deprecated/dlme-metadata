In addition, Robinson refers to the alleged misapplication of monies by Hadjee Yacoob. He recounts one recent assertion to this effect, but adds that he does not give it much credit.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023673709.0x000002#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
