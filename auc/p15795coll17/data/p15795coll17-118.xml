After study in Egypt and abroad and work with UNESCO, Farrag was recruited by President Thomas Bartlett and Minister of Higher Education Hussein Said in the mid-1960s to direct the continuing education program at AUC. Farrag recounts surveying the demand for adult courses in Cairo, the tenfold increase in enrollment from when he began to when he departed the position, and establishing new courses of study. He outlines programs of study in areas like the arts, translation, English language, business, and secretarial studies, as well as courses given for specialized groups like companies. Farrag states that programs like these for Egyptian government ministries helped improve AUC’s suspect reputation in Egypt in the 1960s, and he credits DPS staff for safeguarding the AUC campus during the time of the 1967 War. Other DPS activities in the 1960s and 1970s covered include educational programs and research on health and family planning, publication of the Journal of Modern Education, and operating AUC’s public cultural events programs in venues like Ewart Hall, as well as a conference on adult and continuing education in the early 1970s that led to its adoption at other universities in Egypt. Farrag also describes DPS students and their career paths, course tuition costs, the kinds of instructors employed, classroom and office facilities, staff, records, and the division’s relationship with the AUC administration. Farrag relates his moving on to work with UNICEF and in Arab Gulf countries, his return to AUC to teach psychology, and his work with non-governmental organizations and Egyptian government bodies on issues related to disabled people.</dc:description><dc:subject>American University in Cairo--History.</dc:subject><dc:publisher>Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:publisher><dc:language>English</dc:language><dc:format>oral histories (document genres)</dc:format><dc:source>AUC Oral Histories; Rare Books and Special Collections Library; The American University in Cairo</dc:source><dc:rights>Copyright 2017, American University in Cairo.
