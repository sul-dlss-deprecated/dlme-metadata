The Baluch in Oman were the main arm dealers smuggling arms from Dubai to Persia. This was due to the good relations between the Baluch of the Batinah coastal towns in Oman and the Baluch of Mekran [Makran] in the Persian Gulf. A certain Nasir bin Beitlah, a Baluch of Matrah, acted as the broker of the Baluch traders. The Baluch at Mekran were also importing slaves from there to Oman. Guns were also shipped to Oman from other areas including, Mukalla, Karachi and certain regions in East Africa.The volume also includes a number of reports related to arms trafficking in Sohar and Suwaiq. The reports were sent from the assigned collector of customs in those regions to the Political Agency, Muscat. Other reports were related to the seizure of arms by the Muscat Government.Upon the request of the British Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Muscat, issued a public announcement regarding arms trafficking in which the Muscat Government announced eight main points for the public to commit to. The volume also includes correspondence between the Political Agency, Muscat, and Shahab bin Faisal al-Bu Sa‘idi, regarding the International Arms Convention of 1919.Among other correspondents in the volume are: the Political Residency, Bushire; the Chargé d’Affaires, British Legation, Tehran; and the Political Agency, Bahrain.Folios 277-290 are file notes.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029e#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029e#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x00029e#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
