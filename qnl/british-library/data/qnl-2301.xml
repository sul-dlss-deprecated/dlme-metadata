Will you please refer tc your telegram of the 10th February, regarding customs duty on provisions brought in by the 'Ormonde' survey party. I am sure you will realise that the question is not one of the sum involved which is trifling, but of principle, whether a survey ship landing a party to carry out a survey in the general interests of navigation should be made to pay customs duty on the stores required by their men. I really think that the Bahrain Government are making unnecessarily WW heavy weather over this. The principle is universally admitted all over the world, I believe, that men-of-war being extra-territorial ships pay no customs duty on the stores consumed on board ship This concession is 'V*'- invariably further extended^ if a ship has temporarily to land a party ; in the case of jam stores required by that party while ashore. For instance, the Persians do not charge duty on stores consumed by the Navy ashore at Hen jam, though there are ¥ery strict orders that the Navy cannot extend hospitality to any one else. Surely the Bahrain Government are not going to deny the Navy facilities which are extended to them even by the Persians. The question is not one of^payment of Rs.5/- or Rs. 15/-, but of principle, and I should therefore be much obliged if you could kindly- take the matter up with Belgrave.

Any concession oi principle beyona this he is unwilling to make,and it would be very foolish of him to do so,particularly since it does not appear to be necessary ai tne moment. *&gt;• it may nol pernaps De out oi place if i take the opportunity to express my own views- Bahrain lives by its Customs ana re export trade,and almost everyone in and near iisnrain dislikes paying tne former and would like to abolish all dues on the latter. Further,Bahrain is in the unfortunate position of being a friendly rtate, which means that we aeopt immediately the attitude oi the dau^nters of the horse leech,and give them worse terms icr iacilities we renuire tnan we offer a truculent and hostile state. 4. You mentioned a 'principle' 1 ,but i am not clear whether you reier to waiving customs dues on survey vessels landing stores,(bj warships consuming stores on buara and (c) stores landed by a warship for a party ashore, a survey vessel may, perhaps, be able to make out a case for exemption, though as the Senior Naval Officer did not mention in his blustering telegram it is a commercial department which pays its way by the salecharts- (B^,i presume refers to the concession i mentioned at the beginr. iin^ of para &amp; ,ana so fer,as _? m. tter of courtse v. t he State have not levied dues on stores taken direct from pier to ship. (cy. think it woula be prejuaiciel to the Ctate T s interest to concede this as a general principle in advance, whatever tney c cnoose to do it inducements were held out, or ii they chose to . o ;ive a special concession in an individual case. o. it is nou generally realizea that everyone is on the cad'^e to escape customs aues here. Ine mission were ;iven a T sanad f by Liiaxkn isa v /nicn tney have strainea to exempt all imports. A'hen uiiaikn xsa axes this will ue rectiiiea. The Oil Company by their concession, of course,pay nothing on their imports, other than on personal items such as food and clodshing. The Telegraphs applied to be put on the free list ana I refused to recommend it. The Upper Air Observers, Indian Government servants, applied and i again refused. The ■loyal air Force are renewing' tneir application to escape all duos on imports, and Imperial Airways have intimated tnat tney don't expect to pay any dues either. In fact if all these people had their way we should have the ridiculous spectacle of all foreigners being on the free list (other than the Advisers) ana the Shaikh T s sons, paying full customs on everything they imported. 6. It is vury easy to be generous with other people T s money, but the Political Department Manual states that a Political Officer must consider the interests of the State to which he is accreaited as well as those of the British Government,and I intend to do so. Apart from this,generosity at the State T s expense is bad policy. The first thing a mandatory power does is to put all its imports on the free list,and there is nothing the mandated resent more. $hen i lived in yria,i found tiie Syrians constantly both in conversation and in the press, harping on the fact that the French officials and military paid no duty. We do not wish to create a similar situation here,where we are dealing with an indepenaent ^tate. r i • I venture to Question /our state lent that a ft ate invariably allows a ship to land stores for a party taey happen to hsve akhore. 1 am quite certain the Governrneiit of India would not allow it, for tux/ cnar r e their own officers ana departments luJ .i. customs on ever/thinj- imported,from mess plate to Govern ment motor cars.

MOia a HTgi) kl THE ADKTRAT .TT PN THUK DAT JULY 27TH . PRESETIT; Mr. J .S. Barnes, G^B,, O.B.E, Mr, F.lu Powell Go lone 1 J.F. Turner, D, .0. Mr. H.A. Grieve, O.B.E. Mr. T .G-. Laithwaite Mr. DJL Lavseelles . in the Ohair - Admiralty. - Admiralty Director of Works and Buildings, Air Ministry. - Treasury, - India Office, Foreign Office Captain U . loots, j .S.O., .N. , was present during the latter part of the meeting. ^r, .^arfiQS explained that the subject for discussion arose irom semi-official correspondence between the Inaia Office and the Admiralty. Uaptain Prior, the . olitical Ajent at Bahrein, had suggested that it would be a good thing if the Admiralty were to take steps to purchase land at Bahrein which might possibly be needed for a Maval Base, if the ! avy were, in the end, forced to evacuate Henjam. The Admiralty had at first decided to take no action on the subject owing to the extreme probability that the knowledge that the land had been acquired, and the purpose for which it had been acquired, might become knov/n to the Persians, who would be definitely encouraged to press us to evacuate Henjam. In a subsequent letter, Ir, Laithwaite had expressed the opinion that the transaction, if it took place, might be kept entirely secret and, in view of this, it had been decided to hold a meeting of representatives of the interested departments to go into it more fully. Mr. Laithwaite/gr. Laithwaite then explained that Captain Prior had put forward the suggestion originally because of the likelihood that the land which viight be neeaed for the Kaval Base might very soon be built over. It could not definitely be said that this was bound to happen in the near future, as everything depended on economic improvement in Bahrein. should this take place, development of the land would be inevitable. There was the further point that the whole of the territory of Ba ! rein was likely shortly to be divided up for exploitation by two oil companies who might acquire rights over the area which would be preiudicial to Admiralty interests. Uqln-nel lumer explained the present situation at Bahrein, pointing out the land which the Air Ministry leased at present at Manama on the main island as a strategic landing ground. Imperial Airways have had a short term arrangement with the heikh for renting a landing groun^ on Maharraq for the Oivil Air Eoute. This was now to be taken over definitely, and th§ Air Ministry were contemplating the possible abandonment of the ground at I anama and the use of ifuharraq by the iioyal Air H'orce as well as by Imperial Airways. It was probable that the present strategic landing ground at Manama mi ;ht be suitable for the Admiralty to use as a recreation ground. in any event, tie Admiralty would axso require part of the foreshore for the provision of facilities for a base. If the Air Ministry gave up their lease of the ground on the main island it would almost certainly be very soon built over, as already squatters, moving out of the ^own, were beginning to encroach on the Air iitinistry land. fhe Air Ministry's lease of this land had another two years to run. Mr. Orieve/0 o • Mr. remarked that the difficulty with regard to securing the use of the foreshore for any future Admiralty needs could probably be met by the insertion of a clause in the oil lease making reservation to the effect that HJU Oovernment would be entitled to take up in the future for its own purposes certain specified portions of the foreshore. The India Office representative accepted this view# iJisci,ssion then turned upon the question of secrecy. ;ir. lAithwaltQ. remarked that this had been mentioned to Oolonel fowle, the Political Besident in the Persian Oulf, who said that there would be no need for anyone but himself and the Political Agent at Bahrein to have any knowledge that the Admiralty bad an interest in any land at Bahrein, In subsequent discussion it was agreed that it woula be advisable for the Air Officer Commanding in Iraq also to be informed, in order to obviate questions as to the use of the land being put by Air Force personnel. It . Grieve said that if the land were to be bought it would be better for the cost of it to remain on Air Votes. Details of transactions in land were always given with minute accuracy in estimates and any transfer from Navy Votes to Air Force Votes would be bound to attract attention. A lease would be very much easier from the accounting point of view as the amount involved would be so trivial that it would not be noticed. l!r. Barnes explained that, as the Admiralty hoped and believed that it would be possible to stay at Henjam, they did not wish to enter into any unnecessary commitment with regard x i / ^ \ to Bahrein. He asked Foreign Office representative what the chances were when Treaty negotiations were resumed. Mr, Lascelles/4. Mr. Lascelles explained that it was proposed that HJU Minister at Tehran should adopt the tactics which had been used with so much success by uir John Gadman in the Anglo Persian oil negotiations, and should attempt to settle the main outlines of the treaty by direct negotiation with the Shah himself. It was likely that if these negotiations proved unsuccessful we should not be allowed to remain indefinitely at Henjam, I-r, Laiihwaite .said that the Secretary of State for India had now agreed to resumption of negotiations, but that he had felt very doubtful as to the wisdom of this course or as to the probability of success, particularly in view of the small number of assets on our side. The prospect might be still less favourable if, for any reason, it proved necessary to deal with the Basdap Bailway, which had now assumed considerable importance, outside the Treaty, (The Persians had suggested that this course should be adopted and the Grovernment of India had recently urged that in view of the increased cost to Indian Bevenues involved in the reopening of the Bailway and the transfer to Persia of its Persian section, specific further concessions of interest to India should be secured in return). It was unlikely in the same connection that the (jovernment of India, who might take the line that they were being asked to make substantial financial concessions for a Treaty the general interest of which was greater to H.M. Government than to them, would be prepared to grant free docking facilities for the Persian Navy at Karachi or Bombay. In this connection a suggestion was made that if the Government of India were unwilling themselves to bear the cost of docking facilities for the Persian Navy, H.M, G-overnment might be willing to reimburse them for expenditure incurred/incurred. It appeared to be the general view that, as there was still a possibility that we should be unable to stay at Henjam and that as in view of the probability that the negotiations for the oil agreements ?/ould be settled in the very near future, it would be desirable to secure a lease of the land necessary for Admiralty purposes at jiahrein, so as to safeguard the Admiralty position until a final decision as to Hen jam had been reached. Mr. Grrieve said that the Treasury would have no objection to a payment of, say, £200 a year, which would be an outside figure, as an insurance premium for H .M. Grovernment. Mr. Laithwaite said that the Air Ministry at present paid £120 a year for the lease of the strategic Air Route landing ground and, in future, the heikh was to get £500 a year for Muharraq and the payment of £120 a year was also to continue. Therefore, Air Ministry representative thought that they would have no objection to keeping on the lease of the ground on the main island as no saving would be effected its surrender. The land could then be kept available for Admiralty use and all that would be necessary would be for a suitable portion of the foreshore to be leased. It was finally agreed that the Air Ministry would, for the time being, hold up the discussions about moving from the old landing ground to Muharraq, and that they would obtain an accurate plan of Air Ministry property and buildings on the main island in order that it could be definitely seen whether the ground was suitable for Admiralty requirements. This action would be completed within, say, a month. A lease of the land and of the piece of foreshore necessary could easily, in case of need, be turned into a purchase. It was also agreed that a clause, safeguarding the rights of H .M. Oovernment to purchase certain specified portions of the foreshore, should be/© /(/ 5- be inserted in the 11 Company's lease. When the definite needs of the Admiralty had been ascertained, the whole question of whether a lease rhould be acquired would be submitted to the higher authorities at the Admiralty who would give a final aecision.• • if \ SECRET OEFICE, - ^ WHITEHALL, S.W,1 30th September, 1933, My dear Gastrell, I enclose a letter from the Admiralty which perhaps you will be so good as to deliver to the S.N # 0 # from them when he arrives in Bahrein.

Political Agent, BAHREIN.of a letter from Major Frank Holmes of the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd., to H.M's Political Agent at Bahrein dated the 23rd April, 1928. I hereby apply for and on behalf of the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. for permission to negotiate an Oil Concession covering the remaining portion of the whole of theSahrein group of Islands not alienated under the Bahrein Concession Agreement of 2-12-1925 and their Territorial waters. The area for v/hich permission to negotiate for is requested is that portion of the Bahrein islands and its territorial waters which is not included in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement by which 100,000 acres of the Bahrein Islands was granted to the Eastern &amp; * General Syndicate Ltd. by H.E. Sheikh Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa Governor of Bahrein on December 2nd, 1925. The total area of the Bahrein Islands including its territorial waters is roughly 198,000 acres approximately 309 square miles. The area granted under the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement is 156 square miles. Therefore this request is for permission to negotiate for the balance of the total area including territorial waters v/hich is 153 square miles equalling 97,920 acres. The terms upon which this area is requested are exactly the same as those laid down in the Bahrein Oil Concession Agreement of December 2nd, 1925. FurtherFurther permission is also requested that the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. be allowed to negotiate with H.E. Sheikh Hamad bin Isa A1 Khalifa for permission to develop the deep waters of Khor Kayila lying to the south of Muharraq and east of Hal at-an-Manas and Has al Jasra (Essex Point) and the sea and land approaches thereto as a safe harbour for the ships engaged for transporting the Oil and its products won from the Bahrein Islands. Sole rights to the use of the harbour of Khor Kayila are not asked but preferential rights, use and facilities for developing these waters and approaches thereto and preferential rights to the use of the developed harbour and full control over all piers, causeways, docks etc. erected by the Concession holders to develop and make the harbour safe for ships to enter, load and depart therefrom If pemission be granted to negotiate the writer (who holds a full power of attorney from the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd) will be pleased to submit a draft Concession Agreement for your approval. An early reply to this application is respectfully requested.13&gt; 3 Letter from Major Frank Holmes of the Eastern and General Syndicate Ltd. to the Political Agent at Bahrein dated 5th May, 1928. I have to acknowledge and thank you for your letter No»C149 of 1928 dated 3rd May, 1928. I em pleased to note that H.S.Sheikh Hamad is prepared to consider negotiations for further concessions for which I thank him. I am enclosing, herewith, three copies of a draft Concession Agreement drawn up, except for a few alterations required to describe the area now applied for, and a small addition in Clause 1 Schedule III (Mining Lease) referring to harbour rights upon exactly the same terms and conditions as specified in the Bahrein Oil Concession dated 2nd December, 1925. You will note that the area now requested has an area of approximately 97,920 square acres. The harbour, the Company will require to develop in order to facilitate the handling of the Oil won from the area hereby applied for and from the area of our present concession, must have deep water and Khor-Kaliya and adjacent waters is the only one fulfilling this condition. There is one area, however, it is not agricultural land, which my Company would prefer not to see alienated from Government hands at this moment. This area in / greater part lies within the Territory covered by the present Bahrein Oil Concession. TheThe above mentioned area lies S.E. from Sheikh Ali's Bridge (Sakhir Road) a disuance of 4 miles along the coast and two miles wide inland from high water mark, no part of the area lies North of Sheikh Mi's Bridge, so does not interfere with date gardens. It extends to a point opposite the Southernmost point 01 Sitra Island. This is almost entirely rocky land except for a few yards from the coast line, there are a few date palms at the Sitra end, but they will not interfere with works necessary to develop the entrance and the harbour* This area is required upon which to build tanks, refinery and pumping plants and make jetties and wharves etCo to connect with deep water of Khor-Kaliya. Any other unoccupied land can be passed over quite readily without damaging the agricultural efforts to any appreciable extent, if at all. In regard to the Agricultural project mentioned in your letter, as now being considered, that is the leasing out of unoccupied lands I do not think that this will interfere with the Company's operations, if we should find it necessary, to run pipe-lines, tramlines or roads over any portion of Buch lands it vail not affect the leaseholder except to a small extent owing to the small area occupied* The copies of the draft Concession are for use as fellows, should others be required they can be,, sent to you:- No.l.

Bahrain Naval Station ?li \P.Z. h 1 INDIA OFFICE, WHIT'EHALL. o.W.l. 14th October, 1933 Dear McClaughry, I write in confirmation of our telephone conversation this morning to say that I understand that the Admiralty have now had a telegram from the Senior Naval Officer on the subject of the acquisition of land at Bahrein for naval purposes. The S.N.O. does not apparently think that the area round the seaplane base is really suitable for a naval station, though he regards the landing ground as entirely suitable for recreational purposes. He is, 1 gather, in favour, if land is required, of acquiring the Ras-al-Jasra area, and he and the Political Agent have apparently suggested that one way of safeguarding our interests would be to i ^ 'j W' get the Sheikh to declare the area in which we were interested as public land so that we could take it up by agreement with him at a later stage if necessary. A detailed report is to follow by this week f s air mail» 2. le must, of course, await the S.N .O 's detailed report/ fing Commander Yf.A. McGlaughry, BSO., MO., DFG.,report on the question of the precise area, if any, to be acquired for naval purposes. But both he and the Political Agent seem to have overlooked the fact that the Bahrein Petroleum Company are at this stage free to choose, if they so desire, the whole area round Ras-al~Jasra and the Khor Khaliyah as part of the area to be covered by their mining lease (with the exception, of course, of such area as may be set aside by us for the specific purpose of a landing ground or a seaplane station). On the whole of whatever area they choose they will be at liberty to erect derricks, etc., and the Sheikh will have no power to prevent them whether he declares any part of that area to be public land or not. 3. The point which is exercising me is that the Petroleum Company's lease will run for 55 years. Quite a small area may at the moment be all that the Aid Ministry would require for seaplane purposes. But the development of seaplanes even in the next 4 or 5 years is likely to be quite considerable and when we are dealing with a period of over half-a-century I cannot help feeling that it may be very important from the air point of view that we should have staked out a fairly substantial/substantial area,in regard to which we shall have exclusive rights, whether for use as a landing ground or as a seaplane base. It may well be that this would involve you in greater expenditure than could possibly be justified by immediatR needs. But you may think that there is some force in the suggestion that we should look ahead in a matter such as this and that it might be worth while taking up a much larger area than we really want at the present stage as an insurance against the future. A decision of this nature mighty of course, also ease matters so far as the Navy is concerned, though that will have to be considered separately in the light of the S.N.0*3 report. 4w I am sending copies of this letter to Powell, who will no doubt send you and Turner copies of the d.M.O.'s telegram, which I hope I have correctly paraphrased above, and to Lascelles at the Foreign Office. The matter is, of course, one of considerable urgency. We are marking time as regards sending the Bahrein Petroleum Company the amendments we wish to suggest to them in the mining lease until this question of/u of taking up land in Bahrein is clear, but it is desiraole oo i educe ciie cielay ar niuch. as possible and if it could be managed we should like to be in a position to reach a decision, possibly in the light of a celegiapnic leierence to the A «C«0». once the 3.N^O. ! s views have reached the Admiralty, towards the end of next week. 5, If there is any information which ?/ould be of assistance to you in reaching a decision or anv other way in which we can help, perhaps you will telephone to me.

Bahrain Government have very little ready money at their disposal and it is desicable that they should be able to clinch bargains on the spot before owners change their minds. 2. It would be unwise for reasons of secrecy for me to pay large sums to Bahrain Government or for any transaction to be made through the local Bank. I request that sum ol Rs.178,500/- repeat Hs.178,500/- may be placed to the credit of current account of Government oi Bahrain with Lloyds Bank Bombay,who should be warned confidentially that they should on no account mention this creQit in pass book or letters. I will tell Adviser who can then draw on this account without arousing suspicion that Lis majesty s Government are concernea and will account to me in aue caurse. as transactions are beginning i hope that creait will be opened with as little delay as possible and request that I may be informed of it by telegram. Political./. /$£&gt;. A, ; Li, . a I mentioned the question of Customs duties on imports into Bahrain by the Navy again to the Adviser on the 7th March 1933. There is no question of levying import duties on the small quantities of articles imported by,for example, the survey party who landed from H.M.S.Ormonde. They are, however,concerned with the principle which is at stake if there is ever a Naval base established at Bahrain. The question will then arise as to whether customs duty should not be charged because,for example,many people will try to buy things from the Naval canteen,should one be opened. On the other hand the great majority of stores for the Navy would merely be landed at Bahrain and removed for consumption on His Majesty 1 s Ships. Send the file with me to Bushire. 7-3-1933. ■ D .

There is nothing else m oliice on this subject. 1 i x sli On the 23rd January 1934 I aiscussea the question of Naval imports into Bahrain with the Adviser in connection with his demi-official letter No:915/3 ol the 2nd January 1934,which is in the office. The particular instance is one which is a matter af aealing- with on a basis of courtesy but later,in certain i circumstances^ the question of principle may arise. It may be possible to treat certain of the imports which are l ; i t!t0 HiS Ma;iesty,s Shi P s on a ba sis of rnrougii csrge but in general teras it seems desirable tiiat anything used in Bahrain should pajr_ duty. On^tta of the criticisms of the French administratlon^in^Syria/is^that French services ana oilicials get things free of fluty.and in a place like Bahrain it waSSi be difficult to prevent the sale oi duty free goods. ^3-1-1934.I have on various occasions discussed with Dr Holmes the possibility of an anti-malaria campaign. On the 4th Feb. I did so again and arranged that he shd discuss the question with Commander Macdonald,M.O. of H.M.S. Shoreham, who has special knowledge pf the subject. Estimates of what is required wilx be made ill due course. I also mentioned(on the «th Feb.) it to the 3.N.0 who is keenly interested. He thought that a grant rather than an annual payment would find favour with the Admiralty. 5.S.34I Original on Pile 7/l. On tiie mornmj 01 the btJa February 1934 I discusseu the question ol the acquisition ol land with the Adviser. It was decided that the best plan was to meet the Shaikh at the Tombs, where he : oes m the aiternoon,on SaturQay,the 10th February, at lb.30 hours and that 1 should there aslc him to give Govern ment his help tor this proposed acquisition. It was thought best to show him the areas on the mosaic map. It is probable that he will tell the Adviser to maxe arrangements and also that he may suggest that Shaiich Abdullah should be consulted. Snaikh Abdullah is certain to find out betore long as part of the land in question belongs to him and it will be better to consult him irom the outset it the Shaikh so suggests. 3. Shaikh Uuhammad has certain f hibba ! rights over Jufair and it is thought that it would probably be best to oiler a lump sum basea on certain recent transactions to buy out his rights,the sum being one which the Bahrain Government would give him if they had to acquire under their inherent Kxgkt powers and that no bargaining should de entered into. He is understood at present to be short of money owing to ms visit to Egypt. 4, The general procedure lor buying m other places was also arranged. 8-^-1934.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003b7_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/2/216</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000193.0x0003b7</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/2/216</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File No. 5/7 I Jufair Naval Base'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2014-05-03T00:03:32</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (106 folios)</extent><extent>This file is arranged approximately in chronological order.</extent><extent>Foliation: The foliation squence commences at the front cover and terminates at the back cover; these numbers are circled and written in pencil in the top right hand corner of the recto side of each folio.
