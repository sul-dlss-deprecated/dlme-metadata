He holds a sword with both hands and stylized plant forms emerge at his feet.  Some scholars suggest that the iconography of this image may have been transmitted through the influence of Persian textiles that entered Egypt through trade and conquerors.  The carving was most likely rendered by an Egyptian carver during the Sasanian occupation of Egypt, from 619-639 CE.", "CreditLine": "Acquired by Henry Walters", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/8959", "Provenance": "Dikran Kelekian, Constantinople and Paris [date of acquisition unknown], by purchase; Henry Walters, Baltimore [date of acquisition unknown], by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1931, by bequest.", "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2012-06-21T22:00:01.03", "Creator": "Egyptian", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1544586", "ExhibIDs": "358", "Images": "PL7_71.62_Fnt_BW_H46.jpg, PL7_71.62_NF_3959-tms.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
