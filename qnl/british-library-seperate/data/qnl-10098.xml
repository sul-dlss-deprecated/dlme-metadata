In particular, the papers discuss the concern by British authorities about the extent of their influence at the Kuwait Oil Company, and the extent to which the Ruler of Kuwait's authority applies to some of the Company's peripheral operations. Other papers discuss the removal and appointment of personnel in order to indirectly ensure a minimum of British influence at the Company. The latter half of the file includes papers that discuss the dismissal of Iraqi artisans at the Company, and the political repercussions of changing labour practices.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Kuwait Oil Company</namePart></name></subject><subject><topic>Petroleum industry</topic></subject><subject><topic>Labour relations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000117#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x000117#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
