Proposed amalgamation of the IChorasan and iiistan Consulate iiistablishments with the Persian Gulf Cadre. The proposal to amalgamate the Khorasan and ^istan Consulate isstablishments with the Persian Gulf Cadre having been agreed to by all concerned,I no^ forward for the information and approval of the Government of India a list of the combined clerical cadre. Of the total strength of 42, 4 are leave reserves, leaving 38 as the effective strength of the cadre. In the Gulf clerks generally go on leave after serving for 5 years and then usually on combined leave exceeding 4 months. Adding joining time to leave the absence of a clerk on leave must be taken on an average as being six months at a time. Inan effective strength of 38,therefore,it is necessary to have a leave reserve of six but in view of the present financial stringency I refrain from requesting sanction to the increase in these reserves. I suggest that the present arrangement of appointing temporary leave reliefs in Meshed and Gistan be continued as an experimental measure and that the,question be reconsidered after a period of two years during which experience of the &gt; orking of the scheme will have been gained. Allowing for these tempo»ary reliefs the total establishment maintained at any time should not exceed 44. I also forward for the information of the Government of India a list of the ex-cadre appointments.The temporary leave reliefs willas far as possible be appointed from t his establish ment. with regard to the eificiency bar examination i am addressing the GovernmentdB of India in a seperate communication.

My date of appointment (column 2) is erroneously shown as 1-5-42, and my position in the cadre fixed accordingly below Mr. Narasimha Rao, who joined service here on 30-2-42. As a matter of fact, I was relieved at Karachi on 23-12-41, and joined duty on 5-1-42. correct position in the cadre must therefore have been shown as below Mr.C.A.D'Aguer, who joined here on 4-11-41 and above Mr. Maqbul-ur-Rehman, who joined on 23-2-42. 4. I feel that this miscalculation of my seniority was perhaps responsible for my not being given a chance to officiate in the Upper Division, while most of the people who joined service after me are officiating in the Upper Division. 5.
