Paris now tell us in reply to this letter that the boy and the girl are shown in the French births register as the illegitimate children of Gertrude Mollemberg and never to have been recognized as legitimate by their father. In view of this the French authorities ask whether the Sultan of Muscat can produce proof of the Sayid's marriage to Gertrude Mollemberg. If such proof be forthcoming application will have to be made to the French Courts for rectification of the birth certificate since, under French law, any illegitimate child born in France and not recognized by the father is considered French. The Paris Embassy think that, from the attitude of the French authorities, these children are no longer dependent on public assistance but have been adopted into a family which does not wish to give them up. The Embassy recommend leaving the matter where it is. In any case, so long as, by French law, the children are considered to be French there /would t F.A.K.

Mr. Filliter stated that no reply had yet Been received from Sir D f Arcy Oshorne who had Been asked By the Foreign Office to endeavour to oBtain a detailed statement of Mrs. Strong's expenses. (c) Arising out of paragraph 3 ~ Funeral expenses of Mrs. Fhpperitz in Germany .

The Committee considered a recommertdation (Document 337) By the Swiss Legation, Berlin, that the maximum ratf of relief for British suBjects in Holland should Be increased from 75 florins (= £10) to 1 25 florins a month. Mr. Henri ques thought that the recoJdfeanded maximum was not excessive in view of the detailed evidence provided the Swiss. The Committee agreed that the Swiss proposal Be accepted. 3« France (former Free Zone): Relief of interned British suB.jects. following discussion By.the Committee at its 54th Meeting (paragraph 3 of minutes) of a Swiss recopnendation that the maximum allowances to interned British subjects in Vichy/ranee Be raised from £2 to £5 a month, the Foreign Office had obtained further infomation from the Swiss which was circulated, together with Foreign O/rice letter of the 7th July to the Treasury, as Document 338. The Swi/s pointed out that the food situation in France was so unsatisfactory tha/c it was necessary to do something to supplement the inadequate suppliesyreceived By internees and made two proposals,(l) Red Cross food parcels ^ 1 (2) money payments to enable ipternees to oBtain food purchased By friends and relatives outside tho camps. Mrs. Crump stated that a number of British subjects were compelled to remain in certain districts and some were confined to hostels and camps, Bu'. the Ministry'of Economic Warfare recognised as interned only those British subjects were actually in internment camps, and wished to confine the provisionyx&gt;f parcels to persons who were in those camps and s&amp; prevented from catering for themselves. \ The Chairman said that the Foreign Office had apparently takep. the view tha.tAhe Swiss proposed an increased sum in 'pocket money' (the object of whipi was to provide money for small comforts in addition to parcels) in or/er to supplement rations with food purchased in the Black market. He was or opinion, however, that the Swiss proposals were not supplementary But /alternative \- 2 - t alternative and that they would prefer the food situation to he alleviated by parcels, but failing that, by cash. Mr. Henriques agreed, and said that provision of parcels was the fairer method as a cash payment would place at a disadvantage persons having no friends and relatives outside the camps. He suggested that the Swiss be infoitned that it was understood that parcels were being sent to all internees ahd that a cash increase was therefore not called for* fir. Mynors also agreed and thought that the Swiss preferred parcels as the most efficient way of getting food to the internees, the alternative 'being reliance on the black market* The Chairman thought that the Swiss were not in doubt as to the distinction between interned and non-interned,persons, but considered °hat it was necessary to clarify the question,; v/hether the Swiss proposals were alternatives, and the Committee agreed. i - 1 ranee ;—two Departments adjoining Paris* Increase in maximum relief rate * A letter (Document 336) dater&amp; 26th June 1943 was circulated xor information, conveyingiTreasury concurrence in a Swiss recommendation ohat the maximum rate of payment applicable to Rxris should be extended to the adjoining Departments of- Seine-et-Oise and Seine-et-Marne.

The cost exceeded the amount the Sultan was prepared to deposit, and the matter was dropped. The ccasin n.us now appealed to the Swiss Consul for assistance, he and his two children being in distress, and asks for 5,000 francs (presumably per month)* Lumby stated that the Sultan, who was prepared to deposit funds for the purpose, was giving valuable assistance to the rr ar effort of the -Allies, and that tnere were fairly strong political reasons for meeting his wishes unless the Committee though!; otherwise owing to overriding financial considerations. Mr. Mynors was prepared to agree, provided there should be no payment of arrears, and mentioned that the Swiss appeared to be willing to make payments. The Committee approved the provision of relief at the rate of 5,000 francs per month against repayment by the Sultan, payments to begin in respect of July, 1943* i. Par East.

The Swiss had now appealed against tnis decision, saying^mat this was a bona fide case, her reason for not accepting repatriat^m being that she could not take her animals which were her means of livelihood, with her. The Chairman thought that as it was evidently the intention of x’irs. Williajrfs to remain on the Continent, she should not be maintained out of Bjj^oish funds.

Repatriation of British subjects-further consideration (Sec document * Mr. Filliter after reference to correspondence stated that whilst the Prisoners of War Department fully appreciated the force of the points made by Mr. Dudley Ward, it had referred the whole questi n for consideration on a higher plane. He added that the matter was possibly a little academic because the possibility of getting •oeomle away ^rom Italy, and to some extent France, was now more than a little exi r *uous. Mr. Bliss stated that he had not expected that numbers of British subjects could be immediately repatriated but that the point was raised now in order to have the question of principle determined in case the opportunity occurred in the future for the repatriation of British subjects. The Chairman stated that now the Swiss have to be provided with exchange, it did not make any difference iron the Foreign wxchange point of view whether the British subjects are in Switzerland, occupied France or Italy. The Pr-wosal of the Free French Delegation in E w t that the Free French should be al lowed to instruct their ban s in France to sell securities which they hold to meet expenses (Document 101). Mr. Bliss enquired whether the relatives of the Free French would be objects of discrimination if payments were made to them under this prowosnl. Mr. Henri cues stated that French newspapers had been referred to him showing that dependents of the Free French were not discriminated against generally except that for the public assistance they would rank Iasi; as they were rendering no service to the country according to the tenets of Vichy. He mentioned that the effect of disapproving the sale would be that the Free French would agitate for some other procedure for supporting their dependents. The Committee decided that as the Free French securities situated in France were of no interest from the Foreign Exchange an r# le, the Committee recommended that the proposal of the Free ' pench ...legation should have the backing of H.M. Government. Mr. Thorley referred to the third paragraph of the telegram and stated that it fell to be considered whether the proposals should be general or restricted to the Free French. The Canmittee decided that the distinction between Free Frenchmen and Frenchmen need not be made too obvious in the reply. It was agreed that the Chairman should draft the reply cv behalf of the Treasury. The application of Mr, Albert Cohen, a Swiss national. The Committee were referred to Document 199, an application by Mr. Cohen to remit some f/&gt;9 to France to secure the transmission of a number of literary manuscripts to Switzerland. Mr. Henriques suggested that as' the sum involved for securin' possession of the manuscripts was not at all comnensurate with t oir value and might be regarded as paid for the protection of literary property, the Committee might be disposed to favour Mr. Cohen’s application.

Remittances to Enemy Territory Committee The Sultan of Muscat and Oman. Pursuant to the previous decision of the Committee, arrangements were made whereby the India Office requested Thos. Cook &amp; Son to undertake the movement .from Paris to Egypt of Ilr. Pahad under licence from the Trading with the Enemy Branch. Cooks have reported that the cost of moving hi. Pahad is about £300 comprising the following items Train journey, 1st Class, Paris/Lisbon; 1st Clans steamer, Lisboiy'Bcira, . and hotel expanses in Lisbon. (Foreign currency item) •. .£145* Travel by air, Beira/Gairo and hotel expenses at Beira (sterling item)...........#£131. Cables and Travel Agent's fees about £12.10s. AM. fo7 In addition there would be an item for incidental expenses. Mr. Fahad has been communicated with and the following report from the Wagons-Bits Company at Lyons has been received by Thos. Cook: 'Mr. Saiyid Dhiyjr Bin Faha.d has been contacted in PARIS but he would not leave alone for CAIRO. Should he decide to return, he would travel with his two children (6 and 7 years) and after receiving necessary money to pay his debts (about 100,000 Francs). We should add that the issue of necessary permit by the occupying Authorities appears doubtful and, in the circumstances, no possible steps can be taken before you advise us of the decision of Mis Highness the Sultan of Husce.t and Oman'. It therefore appears that for the movement of Hr. Faha.d and his two children a sun of £900 might be required, one half of which would be expended in - reign currencies, and. that Mr. Fahad requires a. furthe. sum of about d600 to discharge his present debts in Paris. It is obviously impossible to repatriate Hr. Fahad and family on the sum of £400 deposited by the Sultan. The question to be considered now seems to be whether the Suit An should be asked to incur the extra expenditure suggested, by Faha.d, whether the Departments concerned would in any event, be willing to.provide the exchange and other facilities asked for by Fahad, and if not whather it is possible to do anything at all to support Mir. Fahad in his present way of living. (Si ignecg d) E.F. Henriquos. Trading with the Enemy Branch. 4th January, 1942.TRADING WITH THE ENEMY BRANCH concerning the cousin of the Sultan of iluscat.

Hence we could not tell Cooks to arrange for the journey on the i n. conditions stipulated by Saiyid Dhiyj4 until the Sultan had agreed to provide a further £1,100 or thereabouts. It does not seem worth while, however, for us to telegraph out to the Gulf for this purpose unless we have some assurance that, ■ o h : ' in the event of the Sultan’s being willing to provide the necessary additional funds, the Trading with the Hnemy Branch would be likely to agree to extend Cook’s licence to enable them to make payments for the purposes of (a) and (b) above. * adUflCJL We should be grateful for your views, on this question. t c - Yours sincerely.

The matter was mentioned again at the last R.E.T. Committee meeting when telegram No. 20 from the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf was considered. It is assumed that your Department will now wish to arrange for the repatriation of the Sultan’s cousin to Egypt and it is thought possible you may desire to make use of the services of Thos.

Foreign Exchange Control are naturally anxious to limit the expenditure in foreign exchange in connection v/ith this matter as much as 'oossible, and feel that when the transaction is completed and the loss in exchange is known, that it will not be unreasonable to request the Sultan of Muscat to refund from his American, dollars or other valuable exchange held by him, the amount lost by our own Exchange Control. You may care to discuss any details in connection with this point with Major Lithiby at the Bank of England. I have spoken on the ’phone to Thos.

Arising out of paragraph 2, Seizure of British owned property by the Vichy Authorities for non-payment of taxes, Mr, Hcnriqucs stated that he had attended a meeting at the Foreign Office at which a representative of the American Embassy was present. He understood that M.

He added that a note had been sent to the American Embassy in Paris enquiring whether payments to Mr # John Taylor’s organisation out of the reciprocal advances account were now being made. C. The Chairman observed that the matters raised in paragraphs 3 and 4 had been resolved so far as Germany and territory occupied by the Germans was concerned,by the American note of the 6th August RBI-2749, consideration of which figured on the Agenda. (see paragraph 8) 2* Subjects of Eire resident in enemy territory dependent on assets in the United Eingdon , ( Document 162 ) ' The case of Miss Olive Twigge was considered. Mr. Mynors stated that Miss Twigge had taken Irish nationality in 1939 und there was no evidence that she had no assets in Ireland. In any event, he felt that as the Government of Sire had its own diplomatic representative in Italy, that Government should look after its own nationals and unless the Irish Government wore prepared to enter into reciprocal arrangements v/ith H.M. Government covering questions far wider than the relief of their respective nationals, the application should be rejected. The Committee concurred, and the Trading v/ith the Enemy Branch was requested to advise the Dominions Office of the Committee’s decision. 3• Consideration of a note from Mr, Gillian Lloyd concerning British liabilitios and repatriation of British subjects . The Committee took note of Mr. Lloyd’s observations and awaited further information cither corroboratory or otherwise. h-./Tho despatch of iiitemational reply coupons to enemy territory . The Comnittee vrerc referred to correspondence passing 'between the Tradiiag with the Sne^ Branch and tho Post Office* ‘The Committee agreed that it was desirable to differentiate 'between cases of single ^ reply coupons which are 'being sent for the recipient to obtain the postal service which they are intended to supply, and those which are intended to serve as small remittances: the latter should be stopped* The Trading with the Enemy Branch were asked to take the matter up with the Postal Services Department of the Post Office to devise the best method of implementing the Committee's decision* Application by the Sultan of Muscat and Oman through the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf to remit £A00 to Saiyid Dhiyjr.Bin Fahad in Paris * ~ ^ T Mr, Lumby stated that Saiyid Dhiyjr Bin Fahad was the cousin of the Sultan of Muscat and Oman. This State was not under British protection but special Treaty relations existed between it and H*M. Government, and as the Sultan had afforded assistance to the war effort ohe India O-ixico felt tha^ it &lt; r ould be desirable on political grounds to allow the application. He referred to the previous^decision of the Committee in tnc case of Abdul Madrid, the ex—Caliph, as affording a precedent. Mr. Thorlcy stated that if the application was allowed the decision would cover a much wider class of persons than previously. Exceptions to ohe general principle of not allowing remittances across the exchanges to other than British subjects had only been made hitherto in cases where the proposed beneficiary was of political importance (c.g. the cx-Caliph was the former head of a State) as opposed to relations and dependants of persons of political importance. The Chairman referred to the Chancellor^of the Exchequer's statement that remittances must be confined to British subjects, and stated that there was a pull between political considerations on the one hand and foreign exchange and contraband control considerationson the other. A solution might be the removal of Saiyid Dhiyjr Bin Fahad from Paris* If he were prepared to remove hhnself outside enemy territory, the Coonittee concurred that the necessary sum should be forthcoming for his expenses* Mr. Lumby concurred t.'.at this would be a satisfactory solution and agreed to despatch a telegram to the Political Resident to the effect that the Treasury were reluctant to provide foreign exchange except to enable Saiyid to be icpatriated: in ’which case further details could be settled in London as to one channel of remittance* The Committee decided to postpone,until a reply had been received to the telegram, considering whether the remittance should be effected from India or the United Kingdom. The Committee took note of the Foreign Office telegram to Cairo ^ No* 2842 of the 12th August, document 166, regarding pensions payable by the Egyptian Government . by ?Ir« Shishmariov, a Russian employed in the Press Department of the Soviet Embassy in London, to remit money to his mother, an American citizen living in Rome . * “ Tho Committee were inioned that Mrs* Shishmariov had been receiving income from another son living in.Hollywood, but it was stated that the latter was now unable to make further payments. The Committee decided that it was not a case in which H.M. Government should afford assistance, but that Mr. Shishmariov should be informed that it was open to him to approach his Government to ascertain whether arrangements could bo made out of Soviet dollar resources in the United States, utilising Gen* Licence Ho. 33 of the U.S. Treasury to maize the remittance from the United States.Distribution of payments to British subjects in eneniy territory tlirough the Dresdncr Bojik instead of U.S. Consuls* The Committee considered the American note R3I-2749 of the 6th August and the draft reply, document 169* IIr # Thorley suggested amendments to the draft to draw attention to the fact that the Reciprocal Advances Agreement was still in operation, and should he co-ordinated with the new arrangements for payment through the Dresdner Bank, and, secondly, to emphasise that payments should he adjusted according to the needs of the recipient, Mr, Filliter stated that the ’Torld Alliance of the h.M.C.A. had offered to investigate cases of need and carry on the work hitherto done hy the American Consuls in this respect and that a note was awaited from the Americans, . . Mr, Thorloy said that in view of the information furnished by Mr, Filliter a further amendmejit to the dra.ft was unnecessary. The Committee concurred that the first amendment was desirable and Mr, Thorlcy was asked to forward the dra.ft to Mr, Filliter for incorporation in the note.Draft Paper. IOt&gt;D$ liTx.'T.

Correspondence (folio 63) discusses that Saiyid Dhiyab bin Fahad was interned by the Germans at St Denis from 17 October to 11 December 1940. Approval was required under the provisions of the Trading with the Enemy Act, 1939.Further discussion surrounds the arrangement with Thomas Cook to transfer funds and arrange other practicalities via their agents in Lisbon and Lyon to enable the journey of Sayid Dhiyab with his children from Paris to Egypt. Correspondence also discusses the reluctance of the Sultan of Muscat to provide the required sum in gold and the ensuing cancellation of plans to removal Saiyid Dhiyab from Paris.Further discussion concerns matters following Saiyid Dhiyab's death and the claim of his landlady for recompense as she had supported Saiyid Dhiyab during his enforced stay in Paris, and arrangements for the care of his children.The file features the following principal correspondents: the Trading with the Enemy Board; Remittances to Enemy Territory Committee; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (William Rupert Hay); the Political Agent, Muscat; the Secretary of State for India; the Foreign Office, London; HM Embassy, Paris.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Board of Trade, Trading with the Enemy Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Agent and Consul</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>British Embassy</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Wartime</topic></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Financial aid</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000517.0x0000e8#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
