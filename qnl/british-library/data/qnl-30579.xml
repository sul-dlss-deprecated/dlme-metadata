(iv). The inactivity of the Persian Navy appears to have created a certain apathy amongst the Officers and they arc keen to move from ICaorramshahr. (v) . Khorramshahr continued to bo the most important port for the import and export of cargo, due to the convenience of a lailhoad from Khorramsliahr leading to the xin. nterland. Early in the year, there was a serious congestion in the Customs cargo, owing to the lack of an all-weather road insufficiency ®f rolling stock, the inefficiency ' authorities and the slow clearance of goods s. As a result the port load to be closed By the end of March the cargos cion was greatly relieved and tue port was re-opened, luprovemonta are now being put in hand in the Customs area, whore the yards are being asphalted and new go downs and sheds are being erected. The railway to Ahwas runs six lays in the week and., as the Customs authorities insist on 'passavant” goods for Tehran being transmitted by rail, a good deal of money is male on freight by the railway, which is the main, and most convenient means of transport. Merchants have a good deal *f difficulties in their dealings with the Customs aubh.ord.tios, who are out to make as much as they can cut of them and therefore raise innumerable iifficulties when cargoos are being cleared or shipped. (vi) . ine Russian Merchant Ship of approximately 4,000 tons was berthed at Khorramshahr and it is reported that the Captain had issued many invitations to the Persian Naval and Military Authorities to dine etc., but those were declined, perhaps under orders. (vii) . There has been no recrudescence ef Tudehism in Abadan and Y/ith the Reusing scheme for ai*tisan classes and a 200,000,000 Rial plan for w.‘ : -‘Or supply, sewage under construction etc., the native labourer in for tlio moment contented. of in-comin, to Aliwaz, a of the railw through Gust temporarily.-4- Ifo Oo nfcdc (viii)v The Motor y.\ohfc ’'iT’y' was salvaged by A.

(x). + Captain Zelli, Cfficcr Cornuianding the Iranian Navad Porces of the South, lias shown hirosolf to bo moat energetic and has made rapid progress in the ro~habilitation of the Iranian Navy. Early in the year the formation of a 'Naval Regimont' was put in hand and its present strength is 255 Officers and 35$ laon. ^ Pwo of the throe sloops which were handed back to tho Iranian Covommont by the R. I.N. have been repaired in the Oil Ooirpcjny 1 s doolc^ard and have main tidal runs into the Persian tolf. The third is still under repair. Two R.A.P. seaplane rescue laundies at Basrah have been purchased 'by tlio Iranian Oovemment and aro to be use#, to assist Customs Department in the prevention &lt;^f smuggling otc. It is understood that h/o sloops and one floating dock are expected shortly from England. ^ Tho third sloop is nevf reported bo have been rejairod. (i).

B.T.I., E.Q., was raided on the 14th October and included in tho loot were several rifles and sten guns. The Baluchistan guard were apparently over powered, but I am told they •wore in possession of their rifles after the incident 11 160 , (iv).

Deprived of thos^ raw materials for a riot, Muscat remains calm. Even the Palestinian Arabs in the population, a eon to bo able to discuss tho Pales tire question objectively. (iii). It is understood, however, that Hassassi, the Palestine Wall of Matrail, ^ suggested to the Sultan that he should start a local collection on behalf of the Palestine Arabs. His Highness is believed to have with held permission, no doubt through his desire not to incur His Majesty’s Government's dis; loasuro by becoming officially involved in tho Palestine issue and partly, wo think, lest Rassassi should use his official position to proas Marge contributions out of the local merchants, most of whom aro quite content to loavo the Palestine Arabs to look after themselves. 37. m&amp;OMJM COHCBSSIOHS LIMITED.

(iv) Tho forced extraction of Jewish wealth may bo the first step but more than one source have expressed the opinion that when Army Units return from Palestine, anti-Jewish riots may bo expected in Baghdad and the larger cities. Once a move of this nature starts there is no knowing where it will stop. Public opinion accuses the British Government of lack of loyalty to tho Arabs’in refusing to supply them with tho arms and ammunitions they require, and it would, bo a small stop to turn anti-Jewish fooling into an anti-British campaign.

(ii) The formation of the Tudoh Party in Tehran has not altogether pleased local represent at ivos who are claiming that tho Party can only function effectively within tho orbit of A.I.0.0.

Some open-air meetings are also reported to have taken place in the Bahnanshir Oasis, under tho guise of picnics. A 'whispering campaign' is reported, to have been initiated recently by the Tudeh party to tho effect that attempts are being made by the British to prevent the cultivation of tho fertile lands of Khuzistan in order to ensure tho supply of labour to tho Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (v) On August 3rd, a mooting was hold in the office of tho local repre sentative of tho Ministry of Work and Propaganda in order to elect a delegate from this area to tho International Labour Union. Twenty-five representativos of tho workers wore present at the mooting, at which Amir Quli Mohammed!, a staunch Tudoh supporter, was elootod. (vi) There has boon an incroaso in tho volume of press co vaent regarding A.I.O.C, Concessions.

It will bo recalled that the R.S.S. organisation cane into tho limelight in India in connection with the assassination of the Mahatma.

The local R.S.S, group is reported to have boon established by an Indian named Phatak, who lias been holding noetinga regularly in the private quarters of members of the group.

On August 15th Pakistanis as well as Indians car.ro out, tho strike spread to^Kuwait tiroough the activity of pickets, and communications within K.0.0, wore interrupted. (ii) A mooting between tho Strike Cor; dtteo and Abdullah Mullah, His Highness* Secretary and Personal Hoprosontatives with K, 0.C, was held in Ahnedi on tho evening of August 17th and resulted in tho strike being called off after certain assurances had boon rriven by Abdullah Mullah, and a mooting between the strike committee and tho management of IC, 0.0. had boon arranged for the next day on 'neutral .ground' at tho Agency. At this mooting, most of the strikers* demands were deferred for future consideration. Meanwhile tho strike committee found it has lost a Itt of its support, as’tho 400 Indian^ employees who had offered their resignstisn as a'protest wesro surprised to have their resignation accepted and .any asked ' hurriedly to withdraw their, original application. There was half hearted talk of calling out tho strikers again but no real attempt was made. Tiro General Manager stated that oil production was not affected.

That remains to be soon. (And in tho light of past experience of promises to Bus 1 .ire this observation is not too cynical). (ii) Tho arrival rf j'ir, Grimson, Surveying Engineer, caused satisfaction in the tiwn and has off-sot, to a certain extent, the gloom crcatoc. by tho • newspaper and. radio news concerning the mrchaso of the Old British osidoupy property by tho Iranian Govorni .ont. The local powulaco have* a fixed conviction that tho property of Bushiro depends on the •o rroe of interest taken in the town by the British. If tho British wore to abandon Bushiro entirely, it is felt that the town would revert to what it was before they came originally, a small fishing village. The. belief h as a certain foundation on fret as the original establish, •out, of tho Residency at Bushiro coincided wit 1 : the opening up of Iran to noa-bomo trade, when the town was developed because of its harbour. (iii) A certain amount of work is being done in repairing the rougher pate 1 os on tho Bus 1 Are - Shiraz road. Tho road metal used is a soft sandstone which does not stand up to tho wear imposed on it by the heavy tankers of the A.I.O.C. and tho 3-ton lorries of the Et&amp;rnadioh Spinning and Weaving Mill. (iv) Reports from M.T. drivers using the road, between Bushj.ro and Shiraz indicate that it is in fair condition and that no trouble has been experienced during past period from bandits. (v) I AT, using tho track linking Khorramshahr and Bushiro are advised to carry snare water, particularly on last 150 mile stretch, as wells etc, are becoming exhausted. (vi) A branch tf the Tehran Travel Agency ”Levant our” was opened in Bushire in readiness for operations by a now (said to be English) airline company for whom they are to act as agents. The company will fly Love aircraft to and from Tehran. 5?-. EKTRAOTS ERQI SHIRAZ DIARY. (i) Work has now begun .an tho reservoirs for the Shiraz water supply. The contract has been awarded to the ITamvar Comp ary. Some of the pipes have already arrived in Shiraz whilst more are reported to bo in Bushiro together with large quantities of cement, awaiting transport._ (ii). The local authorities are going ahead at an astounding speed with tho aamhalting of tho city’s streets.

It is not guaranteed to be accurate in every detail. The strength of the Southern Naval Foroos at present is 34- Officers and 450 Warrant Officers _and Ratings. The Headquarters of the Force are at the Khorranshahr Naval Base at the junction of the +Shatt-a1-Arab and the Karun. I attach hereto a schedule showing the present holders of the various appointments. The majority of the Officers •were trained at the Italian Naval College at Livorno prior to the last war, which accounts for the abnormal percentage of high-ranking officers. The type of individual eenmissionod to the Navy generally is superior to that of ttherx Forces in Iran, and I have found all the Naval Officers to bo most co-qporativo and holnful. The strength of the Southern Nav^.l Forces is at present 3 sloops built in Italy approximately lG years ago. The tonnage of each of those is about 250 tons and the complement is 4 Officers and 100 other ranks. In addition to the sloops the Navy has 3 motor torpedo boats which wore purchased by them from the R.A.F. in Basrah, These err 't wore originally American Air Service Rescue launches and or h is powered with twin 750 H.P. Douglas Aero Nnginos. The M, .B'a v/ore examined approximately one year ago by a Marino Engine* and found to be in fair condition. They have not boon so far on orvico. There is usually one sloop patrolling the area of the Mo.kran coast, its main task being to combat smuggling operations between Arabia, India and Iran. A special dump of fuel has been placed at Bandar Abbas and Bushiro which can bo used by the Navy when required. Early this year two of the Officers Nakhoda Majlossi and Afk&amp;mi, wore taken to Australia and back on a Compare 7 ' tanker to give them navigational experience. These Officers fitted in well With the tanker crew and created a favourable impression</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ae_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/399</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000881.0x0000ae</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/399</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 11/53 Naval Periodical Summary'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1947/1948</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-09-06T22:17:14</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (33 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 35; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>This file contains copies of the 'Naval Periodical Summary - Persian Gulf' that was compiled by the Royal Navy Staff Officer (Intelligence) in the Persian Gulf.
