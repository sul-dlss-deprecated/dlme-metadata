The missing text in between these two folios would have constituted another bifolium. Written in Sahidic Coptic script, the biblical manuscript to which the bifolium once belonged was produced in Egypt in the eighth century, probably by a monastic scribe and perhaps in the Fayum or Wadi al-Natrun, where monasteries continued to thrive during the early Islamic conquest. It is difficult to determine the full extent of the manuscript, but a combined volume of Genesis and Exodus as part of a multivolume set of the Bible is certainly possible, if not likely, on the evidence of the Coptic numerals inscribed at the top of each folio side.", "CreditLine": "Museum purchase, 1949", "ResourceURL": "http://art.thewalters.org/detail/16520", "Keywords": "Manuscript; Scripture", "Provenance": "Frank Tano, Cairo [date and mode of acquisition unknown]; Joseph Brummer, New York, September 14, 1945, by purchase; Walters Art Museum, 1949, by purchase [through Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York (no. 97)].", "Dynasty": null, "Reign": null, "OnView": 0, "PublicAccessDate": "2013-10-02T01:00:02.9", "Creator": "Coptic", "PrimaryImage": {"Tiny": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg?width=50", "Small": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg?width=100", "Medium": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg?width=150", "Large": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg?width=250", "Raw": "http://static.thewalters.org/images/CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg"}, "GeoIDs": "1543485", "ExhibIDs": "128, 2724, 2345", "Images": "CPS_W.739.1R_Fp_DD.jpg, CPS_W.739.1V_Fp_DD.jpg, CPS_W.739.2R_Fp_DD.jpg, CPS_W.739.2V_Fp_DD.jpg", "DisplayLocation": "Not On View"}
