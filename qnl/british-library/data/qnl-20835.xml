This report gives the details of the Revenue and Expenditure of the Bahrain State during the \ear 1356. It also contains notes on the activities of the various Government Departments, the Budget for 1357 and some particulars of events of importance which took place in Bahrain during the year. • u y ? a ^ has been a P ro sperous one, royalties from oil alone yielded l\s. 31,()o,000 and the total income of the State amounted to Ks 43 36 000 representing an increase over the Budget estimate of Rs. 21,26,000 and an increase of Rs. „4,K),000 o\er the last year's revenue. The Reserve Fund was increased during the year to Hs. 20,00,000 and the State completed the year with a substantial balance of Rs. 6,00,000. Trade in Bahrain was more flourishing during the year than it has been for some time past though at the end of the year there was less activity in the bazaar than earlier on. 1 he diving season also showed considerable improvement but this impro\ement too was not maintained and at the end of the year pearl prices slumped to a very low ebb. Disturbed conditions in Europe have contributed to the depression m the pearl market. The increased revenue and the improvement in trade are mainly the result of n~ e ^^ n ^ inU( i development of the oil field by the Bahrain Petroleum Company whose 2-j,000 barrels refinery was opened in December, 1937. A possible criticism of the Government's administrative policy during the }ear might be made on the grounds that with so large an increase in revenue more conspicuous new schemes and improvements might have been carried out. ^ are || abI ® ^ lose s, ^ ht of the fact that out of a total revenue of Rs. 43,00,000 over Rs. 15,00,000 was paid to the Ruling Family in the Civil List and as their share from oil royalties. In addition to this large sum, Rs. 16,50,000 was contributed to the Reserve Fund as it is essential that this fund should be built up in order to provide an assured income for Bahrain when revenue from oil begins to decrease. This event may occur from natural causes, owing to the exhaustion of the oil supply, or by reason of commercial policy in the oil world. From the remaining revenue, only slightly over 10J lakhs was expended and th l s s ^ m 3 * lakhs was spent on Public Works, Rs. 2,30,000, was spent on I ublic 1 rotection which included considerable expansion of the Police Force and purchase of new arms and equipment and the remaining 5 lakhs represent the cost of the whole administration including Education, Municipalities, Medical and Administrative Departments. Events of outstanding importance during the year were His Highness's visit to Mecca the visit to Bahrain of His Royal Highness the Amir Saoud and the Zabara anair. C. DALRYMPLE BELGRAVE, C.B.E.

Oil Royalty. Rs. 31,65,235. The oil royalty for the year far exceeded the amount estimated in the Budget for 1356 but this was to be expected as in the 1356 Budget, only the amount owing to the Government at the time of making the Budget was taken into account. Customs Receipts. Rs. 10,60,433. Customs receipts for the year were Ks. 3,60,000 more than the amount estimated in the Budget and approximately Es. 1,86,000 more than the actual revenue collected during the previous year. This is the result of increased prosperity owing to employment of labour by the Bahrain Petroleum Co., and a definite improvement in the diving industry. Rent of Aerodrome. Payment outstanding. Passport Fees. Bs. 20,136. There is an increase of approximately Rs. 3,000 over the previous year's collections. Increased prosperity stimulates travel especially visits to the Holy Cities of Iraq by Shia pilgrims Land Registration Fees. Rs. 8,358. This revenue exceeded the Budget by approximately Rs, 3,000 and exceeded the previous year's collections by Rs. 2,000. Land values, especially house property, have increased during the last two or three years. Motor Car Taxes. Rs. 13,671. This includes driving licenses as well as car licenses. The amount collected was approximately Rs. 3,500 more than the estimated sum and Rs. 3,000 more than last year's collections. There are more cars in Bahrain and the number of persons who have taken out driving licenses has increased very greatly. Rent of Government Lands. Rs, 5,433. This amount was underestimated in the last Budget. The revenue is almost identical to the sum received in the last year. It consists mainly of ground rents from land occupied by people living in barastis. Interest on Reserve. Rs. 35,423. The Reserve was increased during the year. At the beginning of 1356 the Reserve Fuid was Rs. 4,00,000. At the end of 1356 it was Rs. 18,09,374 in addition to Rs. 2,50,000 on fixed deposit. Oil Gauging Fees. Rs. 7,817. An arrangement was made between the Bahrain Government and the Bahrain Petroleum Company for payment by the Company of a fee calculated on the number of tons measured to cover the services of the Bahrain Government oil ganger and his assistants, who check the oil on which royalty is due and also oil which is exported by the Company. Other sources of revenue including Judicial Receipts, Registration Fees on houses, etc., do not require any comments. The total from all sources exceeded the previous year's revenue by Rs. 26,88,570. Notes on Expenditure—1356 Allowances to the Ruling Family. Rs. 15,00,852. The payments to the Ruling Family greatly exceeded the Budget for 1356 because revenue from oil was underestimated. One third of the oil royalty is paid to the Ruler's privy purse and the larger royalty automatically increased the Ruler's share from the one third. The pay of His Highness's Factor is debited to the Civil List and an addition of pay to Shaikh Sulman which is recoverable from His Highness's privy purse, also the allowances of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohomed bin Isa Alkhalifah who is undergoing training at the police school at Nasik.Stale Protection. Rs. 2,30,766. Owing to additional revenue becoming available over and above the amount expected in the Budget it was decided that the police force should be increased and provided with more up to date rifles and new equipment. The extra expenditure includes Es. 46,000 cost of 300 new Mark III Lee Enfield rifles and 400,000 rounds of ammunition, cost of saddlery for the mounted section, new tents and equipment and also the cost of increasing the personnel of the police force and some additional naturs. Customs Department. Es. 88,419. Includes certain increases in staff ard normal increments. Secretariat. Rs. 49,359. The expenditure was Es. 10,000 less than the amount allowed in the budget. Provision had been made for an assistant to the Adviser which did not materialise. Judicial Department. Rs. 38,382. Includes increase of staff which took place when the courts were reorganised and moved to the new building. Land and Public Works Department. Rs. 27,454. The additional expenditure amounting to approximately Es. 2,000 is accounted for by the employment of a Public Works Department Superintendent towards the end of the year, and the setting up of a separate Public Works Department not connected with the Land Department. Passport Department. Es. 10,702. The Budget allotment was overspent owing to increase in staff. The revenue from this department, Rs. 20,136 justified the additional staff. Education Department. Es. 64,566. An extra sum of Es. 4,000 was spent on education which included equipment and machinery for the technical school and cost of educating several Bahrain students abroad. Municipalities. Es. 50,400. As budgetted. Medical. Es. 44,527. The expenditure was approximately Es. 5,500 less than the allocated amount. Contingencies. Es. 17,528. Includes cost of steel filing cabinets for Land records, Judicial Department and Secretariat and new office furniture, also printing of numerous government forms which have been adopted for new system of accounts. Upkeep of buildings. Es. 9,816. As budgetted. Upkeep and construction of roads Es. 17,095. The additional expenditure includes the cost of completing the motor road to Budeya and the new road between Sehla and Jed-Hafs. Unforseen. Es. 58,998. The amount under this heading in the Budget was Rs. 10,000. The additional expenditure was incurred in the following items ;— Compensation and assistance to the victims of the Zubara affair Es. 22,600 Expenses incurred during official visit of His Eoyal Highness Amir Saoud 6,700 Outstanding bills from His Highness Shaikh Hamad's visit to England 3,500 Expenses in connection with Coronation festivities 1,100 Annual audit 3850 New Quarantine launch 4,700 Compensation for land sold to thd British Govern ment 8.350 Contributions to new mosques and charity 2,800 Furniture for Eest House and Law Courts flats 5,400 Es. 59,0008 Oil Gauging. Rs. 12,162. The expenditure under this heading shows an increase over the budget figure. Mr. H. D. Furber was appointed as oil ganger in September 1937 with a staff of two Arab gangers. The fees for oil gauging exceeds the present cost of carrying out this work. Special Projects and Public Works Department. Public Works Department Establishment. ... Rs. 26,122 Hospital. Cost of land at Naim ... Rs. 10,620 Expenditure on building ... Rs. 6,217 Fire Engine. Rs. 14,268. The fire engine was purchased during the year. New Palace. Work not commenced. Law Courts.

During 1356 there was remarkable improvement in the pearl industry in Bahrain ; from the figures available it appears that the catch was worth over 50% more to the divers than the catch during 1355. Unfortunately however this improve ment was not reflected proportionally by any startling increase in pearl prices in Europe or in America. In those countries increased activity in the pearl market was so slight as to be scarcely noticeable. No important pearls were found during the season, the largest one, from Katif, weighed 75 chow, but the quantity of small and medium pearls of good quality was unusually great. The demand locally and in Bombay for these pearls was good and they obtained much higher prices than last year. It had been generally expected that the Coronation would stimulate interest in real pearls, Arab pearl dealers imagined that quantities of pearls would be bought by people who would wear them during the Coronation festivities but as the improvement in prices occurred some time after the Coronation, this does not seem to have been the case. Pearl merchants and Nakhudas, like farmers, are invariably reluctant to acknowledge any improvement in their business but this year at the annual meeting of leaders of the local diving industry which is held by the Government, all except one man admitted that they had done very much better than during 1355 and when a vote was taken as to the amount of the annual advances all, except one, were in favour of an increase. The allowances were decided as follows :— Tisqam Selaf Kharjieh Total Diver Rs. 40 Rs. 40 Rs. 10 Rs. 90 Puller 30 30 10 70 Last year's advances;— Diver 20 20 10 50 Puller 15 15 10 40 The willingness of the merchants and Nakhudas to increase the advances is a proof of the improved conditions. The total number of Bahrain boats licensed to dive during 1356 was 271 which is only seven more than in 1355 but for several years there has been a steady decline in the number of diving boats which are licensed so even a slight increase is encouraging. The total amount paid to the divers in 1356, according to my calculations, was Rs. 13,22,000, approximately, £ 1,00,000. Last year the sum was Rs. 6,07,000, approximately £ 45,00-). Before the season the Government reduced the cost of diving licenses by 50% in order to help the industry, which caused a loss to the revenue of about Rs. 17,250. Various other concessions were made giving boat owners more time to pay the diving licenses. No boat failed to make a profit in the season, whereas last year several boats worked at a loss so that at the end of the diving many of the divers received no money and increased their book debts; but since the Government has controlled and reduced the advances, big divers' debts are becoming a thing of the past except in the case of old men who worked for many years before the diving reforms. The catch of one boat which was exceptionally fortunate this year, was as follows:— 1355 1356 Sherin 52 chow. 150 chow. Badlah 161 „ 430 „ Na'm 216 mithqal 417 mithqal.10 The average local prices were as follows :— 1366 1356 Sherin Rs. 60 chow Rs. 60 chow. Badlah 4 „ 4 „ Golwa 16 ,, 16 „ Na'm 24 „ 20/8 „ From these figures it appears that the price of good quality pearls was 20% higher than during last year, medium quality pearls did not change and seed pearls (Na'm) fell in price, The 60% increase in the value of the catch was partly owing to increase in price of good quality pearls, of which many were found, but mainly owing to the unusually large quantity of pearls which were found. For the industry in general it would have been more satisfactory if world prices had improved instead of the local catch increasing. It should be remembered that the figures which are given in this note from which I prepare a report are the rock bottom figures representing the money paid to the divers themselves by the boat owners. Before the pearls leave Bahrain and between the time they leave Bahrain and reach their final owners they pass through innumerable hands, each time increasing in price. Police and Public Security. The State Police. Strength. The strength of the Police on 30-12-37 was as follows :— Havildars ... ... ... g Naiks Lance Naiks Policemen, including band Recruits in training Indian instructors ... Camp followers 6 17 175 31 5 11 The force was increased by 49 men during the year in order to cope with various extra duties and posts such as the additional guards on the Bahrain Petroleum Company's Refinery which is paid for by the Company), the outpost in Hawar fort where naturs have been replaced by police and extra men on traffic duty on main roads. In spite of the increase it is rarely possible to muster more than fifty men on daily parades. Routine and duties. During the first part of the year the Police carried out their normal duties and training; but for some months during the time of the Zubara disturbances large numbers of police were occupied by special duties patrolling the coast and garrisoning the southern villages where it was thought possible that an attack might be made by mainland Arabs. In addition to land duties parties of police in motor launches patrolled the coast from Manamah to the south of Bahrain. Each section of the Police Force completed a musketry course during the year and competed for the shooting shield presented by Colonel Gordon Loch C.I.E. Shooting competitions^ were held between the police and a naval team from H. M. S. Bideford ' in which the police team obtained more points than the Navy. Two^ route marches, lasting five days, were carried out by the Police in the spring and in the autumn. The police camped at various different villages. Transport was provided by the Police lorry and pick-up. ^11 During the Coronation festivities, the police, naturs and school boys, in all about 400 persons, gave a night display in front of the Fort which was attended by about seven thousand people, including the staff of the Bahrain Petroleum Company and sailors from sloops. The entertainment consisted of a torchlight tattoo followed by a representation of an attack on a village by raiders in sailing boats, and a fight and the burning of the village. Police, school boys and camels took part in the show, the scenery, boats, costumes and weapons were made by the police and the lighting effects, including Hood lighting, were arranged by the Government Electric Depart ment. This was the first time that such an entertainment has been produced in Bahrain. It was very well received. Guards of Honour were:provided by the Police on various official occasions including the opening of The Bahrain Petroleum Company's Refinery, and during the visit of His Royal Highness the Amir Saoud. Police Buildings. When the new Custom House was completed the old customs office was repaired and adopted for use as a town police station. The building contains a large well ventilated lock-up, an office, a room for the police when off duty and a special cell for persons who are not confined in the lock-up. The Police Station is on the south of the Customs Square, the most central position in Manamah and is a very suitable place for the purpose. Extensive repairs were carried out in the Fort during the year. The north wall on both sides of the Bungalow was rebuilt and the tower on the north west corner of the Port was restored and enlarged. Rubble from the old walls w T as used to raise the level of the yards in the Fort and the prison which formerly became swamps during the rainy season. The fort and pier at Hawar were completed at the end of the year with the exception of some work on the courtyard wall. Recruitment During the year 21 men left the State Police, some resigned on completing their four years service and others were discharged on account of ill health. The physical standard of men applying to join the police is not as good as it used to be, but this is mainly owing to the fact that strong able bodied men can easily obtain work with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. Over 50% of the men who appear to be fit, when sent to the Medical Officer for examination before being taken on in the Police, are reported unfit, usually on account of defective eyesight. Health. The average number of men reporting for daily sick parade is six. This represents an average out of a total strength of about 220 but of this number there are usually 20 men on leave and over 40 on outpost duty outside Manamah though serious cases among the police are always sent in for treatment. Police Families' Clinic. Towards the end of the year a weekly clinic was held at the Fort by Mrs. Belgrave and one of the Government Nurses for the wives and children of the Police. The average attendance is about 35. Children are treatel, given melicine and the mothers are instructed in infant welfare methods. Police Band and Fire Brigade. A dozen young men of the police band have been trained as a fire brigade by Mr. W. B. Steele, the State Engineer. They have a weekly practice with the Government Fire Engine, which was purchased during the year and have become fairly proficient in working the pumps and hoses. The band are also being taught to read and write and have an hour's lesson on five days of the week. Their musical repertoire has been considerably enlarged and the band now plays on Monday afternoons in the municipal garden. Registration of Arms and Ammunition. All anomalous position has existed in the past regarding the possession of firearms and ammunition by the public. The import of arms and ammunition has been forbidden for many years but possession of firearms in Bahrain has been permitted. In Shawaal 1355 (December 1936) the Bahrain Government issued a regulation governing the possession of arms and12 ammunition, according to this regulation it is compulsory on all owners of firearms and other arms to register them and to obtain a license in order to possess them. About 2,000 rifles and a quantity of swords and revolvers were registered. The registration work was carried out by the police. The regulation enables the Government to prevent unsuitable persons from owning arn s and ammunition and it will also be useful in the case of crimes in which firearms are used. When the proclamation was first issued there was some appre hension on the part of the public that the Government wished to disarm everybody; but these fears were very soon allayed. Mounted Section. A section of police mounted on ponies was formed during the year but up till now only ten suitable ponies have been obtained. The unit is used for work in nearby villages and for coastal patrol work. Good Conduct Pay. Good conduct pay, an allowance of Rs. 3 per month, was instituted during the year as an inducement to the police to re-enlist after four years' service. Men are eligible for this allowance only if they complete four years' service without having any entries on their conduct sheets and provided they obtain a pass in musketry. The pay of a policeman is Rs. 25 per month with a clothing allowance of Rs. 3 per month. In addtition to this they receive rations and quarters. Crime. The police have had very few important cases to deal with dur ing the year with the exception of one murder and several serious motor accidents involving death and grave injuries There has been an increase in the number of theft cases sent in by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, where pilfering is carried out on a large scale, and a great increase in traffic cases. The reason for the apparent dec line in serious crimes is the increased prosperity in Bahrain and the fact that many of the notorious bad characters have found employment with the Bahrain Petroleum Company. The murder case was an unusual one. The victim was a child few months old, son of a minor Khalifah Shaikh in Rafa. The murderer was a woman servant who had reason to be jealous of the child's mother. The child was stolen from its bed in the night and drowned in a water tub in the compound. The servant woman was tried, convicted and executed. Traffic Control. During the year the police investigated 456 criminal cases of which 104 were thefts, 122 various other crimes, 145 petty offences and 59 motor accidents in which six persons lost their lives which is a high percentage in a country where the total number of motor vehicles on the roads is about 400. The most frequent causes of accidents are found to be careless driving and use of cars with inefficient brakes and steering apparatus. The general public have no motor sense and do not yet appreciate the danger of wandering in the centre of roads and streets looking neither to left nor right. The Government and municipalities have instituted various regulations and speed limits which are intended to reduce motor accidents and during the latter part of the year there was a definite decrease in the number of accidents. Liquor. The liquor habit is undoubtedly spreading in Bahrain. There is a general increase in the drinking of methylated spirits and eau-de-cologne. The habit is no longer confined to foreigners but has spread to the Arabs, especially women of the town. A significant hint of the state of things was one of the figures in the Muharram procession which represented a young man dressed as an Arab Shaikh with a bottle and a tumbler in his hand. The older and more conservative of the Arabs in Bahrain strongly disapprove of the increasing amount of drunkenness. The Government has imposed restrictions on the sale of eau-de-cologne and lavender water which are used as liquor. This habit is said to have been introduced originally from the Hejaz, and first started among the taxi drivers. Persian Immigration. In spite of measures which are taken by the police the naturs and passport officials, the number of destitute and undesirable Persians who are entering Bahrain illegally, is, in my opinion, steadily increasing. Parties of from13 ten to twenty persons are constantly decanted from sailing dhows on out of the way parts of the coast and it is only occasionally that the Government authorities are able to catch them. These persons immediately go to the Bahrain Petroleum Company's camp and many of them, stating that they were born and bred in Bahrain, obtain work as coolies. During the last two or three years several thousand Persians have arrived in Bahrain, attracted by the possibility of finding work in the oil fields. There is no political motive in their coming, they come because conditions are bad in their own country. Public Health. The medical work done by the Bahrain Government during the year consisted chiefly of maintaining free public dispensaries in different parts of Bahrain for men and women. Although these dispensaries and clinics are not in charge of very highly qualified persons they do a great deal of good in the towns and villages where they are situated and people who would not come into Manama for attention can obtain medicine and treatment from the local clinic. Muharraq Dispensary^ The dispensary is in a hired house in the bazaar in charge of an Indian doctor who has been in employment of the Bahrain Government for over 14 years. The building is not very suitable and when the work can be undertaken it is proposed to build a new dispensary. Total outpatients ... ... 3827 „ operations ... ... 145 Sak al Khamis Dispensary. This dispensary, which is new, is situated on the edge of Bilad al Qadim close to the Government school. It is in charge of an Indian doctor who besides attending to patients at the dispensary visits the neighbouring villages on certain days and treats people. He is provided with a Ford pick-up in which he tours the villages.

Three trained midwives, one in Muharraq, and two in Manama, in addition to their midwifery work, also conduct clinics for women and children. Each year the work of the trained midwives is increasing in spite of prfjndice and superstition. In Manama a house has been rented next door to one of the clinics so that maternity cases may be treated as in-patients. The newer clinic, on the edge of the western quarter, which is the brothel area, is used considerably for the treatment of venereal diseases. Unfortunately the nurse in charge was absent owing to illness during part of the year and died soon after returning from hospital in Iraq. A new development in this direction is the weekly child welfare clinic in the married lines at the Fort where about fifty of the Policemen's families live. The total number of patients dealt w T ith at the three women's clinics during the year was 11,632. Total labour cases 40. Indoor patients 23. Anti-Malaria Measures. At the end of the year Major M. K. Afndi of the I. M. S , visited Bahrain and carried out preliminary investigations concerning the prevalence of malaria with a view to advising the Bahrain Government on anti- malaria measures. His preliminary report w T as not received during the current year.14 All standiug water in the neighbourhood of the town is regularly sprayed by the municipal authorities to prevent breeding of mosquitoes and instruction about causes of malaria is given in the Government schools. Copies of pamphlets issued by the Health Department in Iraq were circulated among the public in Bahrain. The Municipality continued the work of filling in the low lying ground on the south of the town which becomes water logged for many months during the year. Government Hospital. Plans for the dispensary and outpatients building were completed before the end of the year and work on the foundations was commenced. The hospital is in the Naim quarter on the western edge of Manama on the shore near the boat building yards. The outpatients building is on land which is being reclaimed from the sea, the main hospital building is on the shore immediately south of the out • patients building and between the two there is a road. Land Registration Department. Registration of Sales, Gifts, and Title®. The total number of transactions re gistered during the year was 516 including 351 sales, 133 titles and 32 gifts. Registration fees amounted to approximately Rs. 5,000. Thirty five properties were put in auction through the Land Department by orders of Courts. Revenue from Sales etc. Collections of ground rents amounted to Rs. 2,001. Sales of Government land amounted to Rs. 1,788, these sales were mostly small building plots in Manama town or pieces of ground adjacent to houses. Revenue from sale of Government forms was Rs. 2,175 and from fish traps registration Rs. 155. The staff of the Land Department was during most of the year occupied with Public Works as well as land work and no new survey work was carried out. Now that the two departments have been separated the Land Department will be able to concentrate on survey work. Programme for 1357. In the departmental programme for the new year the following items are included:— 1. Revision of Manama town map. This map was made over ten years ago and is out of date. It is proposed to make detailed maps of each section of the town. 2. Revision and new survey of Ghosaibia. Roads have been made and many new houses have been built in this suburb and the existing maps are inadequate. 3. Survey of West Rafa. This town, which is about the fourth largest in Bahrain, has not yet been surveyed. Eastern Rafa map is to be brought up to date. It was surveyed about ten years ago and has developed greatly since then. 4. Survey of Shahrakan, Darkilaib, Jezirah, Nebi Saleh and Sitrah. These villages and islands have not yet been surveyed. It is intended that eventually the surveys of villages and cultivated areas shall be incorporated into one large map and that the aerial mosaic, made by the Royal Air Force a few years ago, shall be utilised for this purpose.15 Public Works Administration. In the past the Public Works Department has been a branch of the Land Department, under the supervision of Khan Sahib Mohamed Khalil, the Superintendent of the Land Department. The Land registration work as well as public works have increased very considerably during the last few years and it became necessary to create a separate Public Works Department to deal with the Government's building programme. Towards the end of the year the Public Works Department was separated from the Land Department. Mr. A. M. Jaffar, a retired Assistant Engineer with long service in India, educated partly in England, at Durham University and Crystal Palace Engineering School, and partly in India, was appointed as Superintendent, Public Works Department. Buildings which were in course of construction, such as the Law Courts, were completed under the previously existing arrangements but new works such as the Muharraq Girls' School were constructed by the new Department. Roads and Buildings, Law Courts. (See illustrations opposite payes 18 d 28) The new Law Courts, which were opened by His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad on 18th October 1937, consist of a handsome building on Government Koad facing the sea, it is one of the most noticeable buildings on the water front of Manama. It contains four large court rooms, numerous offices, record rooms and accomodation for the Wakf Departments and the Minors Department, built on three sides of a large courtyard which is open to the sky in the centre. Above the rooms on the north end of the building two flats, in European style, have been built. A feature of the building is the large permanent platform at the north end of the courtyard which is used on official occasions. An audience of 500 persons can be accommodated on chairs in the courtyard and in the covered aisles on each side of it. On the north, between the front of the building and the road, a garden has been laid out with a semi-circular sweep giving entry and exit by two gates. On the south of the building the doors open onto Prior Koad. The site was the only property owned by the Government on the sea front, it consisted of a piece of sea with an area of about 48,000 square feet which had to be reclaimed by stone filling approximately 6 feet deep. The building itself covers an area of over 10,000 square feet, it has a frontage of 92 feet and is 35 feet high. The material used is local stone and portland cement. The cost of the building was more than the amount allocated in the Budget owing to the construction of the two Hats which were undertaken during the year and had not been included in the estimate. Work-shop and Garages. Ks. 6,774. A single story building consisting of two large garages and a workshop for the Government Transport Department was built close to the Power House. At this place all Government and Municipal cars are repaired and dealt with. Rest House and Police Station. Ps. 10,318. The old Customs House which became vacant on the completion of the new customs premises has been converted into a Police Station on the ground lloor and a Government Rest House on the first floor. The Police Station consists of a large airy room for the accommodation of prisoners, an office, a room for the Police who are off duty and a cell for any prisoners who cannot be put in the common lock-up. At the back of the building there is a small walled-in compound. Cost of reclamation Cost of building Rs. 17,500 65,600 Es. 83,1001G Hpstairs there are four bedrooms, two bathrooms, a large sitting room a dining room and wide verandas, at the back there are a kitchen etc., and servants rooms. ^ Since the Rest House was opened, it has scarce!}' ever remained unoccupied. Manama Fort. Rs. 27,483. The main north wall of the Fort was rebuilt aim a new tower has been erected at the north west corner. The tower is 33 feet nign and contains one large circular room and a stairway up to the roof u 1 Wal i, has .^ ee ?

J:™ barrac ' i , roor( ' 3 were bui| t outside the south wall at the end of the horse lines for the mounted section and minor repairs and improvements were carried out. Manama Muharraq Road Es. 34,802. The road was not extended durinir the year 1 he decision as to ultimate method of bridging the gap has not vet been made. 1 here are two schools of thought on the matter, one opinion is that the could be safely ^educed, by extending the road on ekch side, thus reducing Ihe thp tf ■ ? e , lts C0 ® t ' tlle other opinion is that it is inadvisable to reduce the „ap as this might have serious results on the low lying coast of Muharraa and Mftrhpll 6 ' rl t rra T em ? ntS n aV ( e r been . made with the firm of Messrs.

A good water supply would contribute greatly towards the development of this island. Government Hospital. Rs. 10,620. A property containing an old house which has been demolished, in the Naim quarter of Manama, on the shore, including an area in the sea, was purchased from Messrs. Abdul Aziz Kosaibi and Brothers. Plans were drawn up for the dispensary and outpatients department in consultation with Dr. Holmes and Dr. Dame, and towards the end of the year work was commenced on this part of the building which is being built on land reclaimed from the shore. Above the dispensary there is a flat for the Medical Officer incharge of the hospital. The main hospital, including wards, operation rooms etc., etc., is to be built on the shore immediately south of the dispensary. There will be a road between the Hospital and the dispensary and the two buildings will have separate entrances. The dispensary is divided into two parts, for male and female patients, and the hospital will also be divided into male and female wards. Plans for the hospital are under consideration, the Public Works Department obtained copies of plans of a large number of Indian Government Hospitals and these have been carefully considered in drawing up the plans of the Bahrain hospital in conjunction with all the medical authorities in Bahrain. At the end of the year work of reclaiming the shore on the site of the dispen sary was still proceeding. Naim was chosen as the location of the hospital as it is the part of Manama farthest distant from the existing hospitals and nearest to the outlying villages. Muharraq Girls' School. This building wes constructed by the new Public Works Department. The site of the School is a piece of ground in the centre of Muharraq town which was purchased by the Education Department. The ground available was not large and the school had to be planned to fit into the available space. It is a two storied building containing two large class rooms and one smaller room on the ground floor, two large rooms on the first floor divided by sliding doors which can be opened in order to make one room, a staff room and a screened balcony which can be used as a class room in the summer. There is a wide inside staircase and a second stair which is mainly intended as a fire escape, suitable sanitary arrangements, and outside the building, a gate house at the entrance of the compound from the street. Verandas and windows which might be overlooked from outside are suitably screened. In this building a number of experiments have been made in different kinds of roofing and ceiling methods and also in the use of coloured cement which has not before been tried in Bahrain. In one room cement blocks carried on reinforced cement beams are used and another ceiling consists of wooden chandals and rein forced cement without the usual bamboo strips and matting. The new Girls' School is the most modern building in Bahrain, excepting the Bahrain Petroleum Company's houses. The work will be completed early in the new year. An adjacent house is being purchased for the teaching staff to live in. Manama Market Buildings. On behalf of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad the work of rebuilding the ' Sook al Arba ' was undertaken. The whole of this bazaar, which consisted of straw huts, was destroyed by fire about two years ago. It was a providential fire. The old roughly built vegetable market, which became partly under water at high tides, has been replaced by three metal market buildings, 150 x 50 feet, purchased in England, with cement floors and cement stalls which can be sluiced down daily from the taps which have been put in at the end of each of the sheds. Numbers of solidly built shops, constructed of stone and cement, have taken the place of the palm branch huts and in some places two storied buildings have been erected. Several of His Highness's sons who own land on the edge of this bazaar are putting up new stone built shops. This property is part of His Highness's private estates.18 Roads. Tha Jufair Road and the Bnsateen Road were rapaired and resurfaced. A new motor road was constructed from Jedhafs to Budeya The road instead of following the coast goes in a straight line from Barbar to Budeya. Judicial Department. Bahrain Court. Inuring the year 702 cases were heard by the Bahrain Court and fees amounting to Rs. 10,713 were collected in both Bahrain Courts. There were few outstanding cases with the exception of one murder case in which capital punishment was inflicted after confirmation by the Ruler (SI pp ' Grime ' on page 12). The estate of Shaikh Ibrahim bin Mohamed al-Khalifah was finally disposed off. Two important cases were dealt with regarding the estate of Khalifah bin Khamis and the Bin Jodar estate. In both cases the administrators were found to have mis-appropriated most of the funds belonging to the widows and heirs whose interests they were supposed to protect. At the end of the year approximately 120 cases were pending. Six appeal cases were filed and were referred to the recenly appointed Appeal Court consisting of Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and the Adviser to the Bahrain Government. A number of motor accident cases were heard by the Court. The Bahrain Court now sits on four days a week, on Saturday, Sunday Monday and fuesday, the Lower Bahrain Court and the Sunni and Shia Shera Courts sit on three days. 1 Transfer of Magistrates. Owing to the departure of Shaikh Khalifah bin Mohamed bin Isa to India for training at the Nasik Police School his brother Shaikh Ah bin Mohamad was appointed a magistrate on the Lower Joint Court. A , , .. During the absence of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad on the Hai, Shaikhs Abdulla and Sulman and the Adviser acted on behalf of the Ruler on the Joint Court with the Political Agent. ,, . further developments in the case of the ex-Qadi Shaikh Abdulla bin Mohamad Saleh were dealt with. Bahrain Lower Court, The number of cases heard during the year was 562 of these 47 cases were referred to Shera Courts, 10 were referred to the Meilis Wiar* and 150 cases were pending at the end of the year. New Regulations. A new regulation was issued regarding anneals from judgments of the Bahrain Court. Previously an appeal could be made from any jud™ ment but according to the new rule there is no right of appeal in civil cases i the amount involved is not more than Rs. 500 or in Criminal cases if the punishment does not exceed 6 months R.I. ^ outuouu In the past court fees were recovered from the plaintiff in the court This frequently led to unnecessary delay and argument. Court fees are now paid at the time the petition is made. ^ ^ au uue A court register of criminal cases has been opened.19 The Small Court was given authority to deal with 1 fasl' and 1 Arba * diving claims, but not other diving cases. shera Courts. The work of both Sunni and Shia Shera Courts has been unsatisfactory during the year. The Shia Qadis owing to dissentions among themselves have rarely given unanimous verdicts in important cases. Most of their judgments have been obviously swayed by personal prejudices. In certain estate cases they have admittedly received large sums of money to w T hich, according to public opinion, they are not entitled. Their prestige and reputation is are lower even than that of any previous Qadis. The Sunni Qadis have a better reputation but are arousing general complaint by their apparent incapability of dispatching cases with reasonable rapidity. Simple cases are held up by them for months and in important cases they take years to come to a decision. The standard of education and legal knowledge of the Ulema of Bahrain, both Sunni and Shia, from whom the Qadis are appointed, is extremely low. Very few young men from Bahrain go abroad to study Islamic law, they are content to learn from the local 'Alims' and the result is a case of the blind leading the blind. Code of Laws. Scarcely any progress was made during the year by the committee which was appointed to draw up a draft code of laws for the Bahrain Courts. Members of the committee were away from Bahrain and the court clerk was on leave. Both magistrates and the public are anxious that some sort of code should be produced especially in order to check the anomalies which occur in judgments in different Bahrain Courts and the differences between Agency court judgments and Bahrain Court judgments. New Law Courts. All the courts now have their rooms and offices in the new building which is a great convenience both to the public and to the magistrates and officials. Cases can be passed from court to court with no delay and it is possible for Wakils to appear in more than one court on the same day which was previously very difficult. The new courts provide accommodation for litigants who are waiting to be heard and the court rooms are more comfortable and better ventilated than the various rooms which were used before. Although the progress of judicial administration in Bahrain is apparently running smoothly there is a definite tendency to criticise the courts on the part of the modern type of educated Arabs who are now the people who are most anxious to make or to adopt a regular code. One of the most frequent criticisms of judicial administration is that with few exceptions all the magistrates are quite young men with no great experience. The magistrates are mostly the sons and nephews of the Ruler. Unfortunately the older members of the Ruling Family, though perhaps more experienced in a general way, are for the most part unqualified lor such duties. Municipalities. Manama Municipality. Annual Revenue 1356 Expenditure „ Balance in hand Rs. 92,130. 96,624. 30,338.20 The financial position of the Municipality is satisfactory although for some years the council instead of attempting to improve its revenue has reduced it by decreasing the house and shop taxes, which have always been extremely low. Out of the annual revenue, Rs. 24,000 is the Government grant, Ks. 16,000 is from house taxes and Rs. 24,000 from shop taxes. In addition to the annual subsidy the Government has made several special grants to the Municipality for certain specific projects. In the Municipal budget for 1357 a revenue of Rs. 87,400 is estimated. Election. The council having officiated for three years, was dissolved at the end of the year and an election was held. The Indian Moslems and Hindu Communities, although then not numerically sufficient to entitle them to representation, at one time in the past had two members on the council. This arrangement ceased about seven years ago. At the end of 1356 representatives of the Indian Communities approached the Government and showed that their numbers had increased sufficiently to entitle them to representation. A Hindu merchant and a Bohra merchant were elected on the council. The composition of the council after the election was as follows:— Nationality Elected Nominated by Govt. Arab 3 3 Bahama 3 3 Persians 2 2 Najdis 1 1 Indians 2 -— Jews 1 — The elections were carried out in what is now the recognised method. Lists of voters were displayed on notice boards, voting cards were issued to the voters at the polling station, filled in and dropped into a ballot box. At the close of proceedings the votes were counted by a committee. Municipal Achievements. In addition to the usual town cleaning services and the upkeep of municipal roads the following new works were carried out. Road Improvement Three road islands were built and a one way traffic system was instituted in the open space on the east of the Adviserate which had become a dangerous point owing to the converging ro ids and the increased traffic due to the Manama-Muharraq causeway. Additional street lights were installed including four lamp posts on the circular roundabout in the Customs Square. The garden inside the roundabout was provided with an ornamental fountain. The Government presented the Municipality with a new i^oad watering cart. Various roads were resurfaced with mud. In the new year it is proposed to experiment with stone for metalling roads. The parapet on Government Road from the Eastern Bank to the western end of the water front was rebuilt and raised and portions of that road were widened.21 A number of trees were planted along the sides of the main roads. Work was commenced on the extension of Government Road in the direction of the Government Hospital. Water Control. Small tanks were constructed near a number of artesian wells in order to enable the fire engine to draw water. An artesian well at Budeya was re-drilled and pipes fitted to the Government Experimental Garden. An artesian well was sunk near the Municipal office to provide water for sluicing the new vegetable and fruit markets and the meat and fish market. Washing places adjoining artesian wells were improved and repaired and new taps were put in. A water supply was provided for the lunatic asylum. Sewers were built from the meat and vegetable markets to the sea and from the Mission Hospital to the Municipal Garden sewer. The Municipal Garden sewer was made deeper and connected through to the sea. When a regular drainage system is installed it is likely that this sewer will be of use. Bazaar Improvements. One public latrine was built on Government Ivodd. Thirty new Municipal dust bins were brought into use. Street benches were increased and painted. Four shops were built on Municipal property. A new Municipal Garage was built in the Municipal Garden and five garages were repaired. Part of the bazaar was re-roofed. Anti-Malaria Measures. Standing water and drains were sprayed with crude oil and disinfectant. Circulars were issued to the public regarding malaria and smallpox. Nearly 4,000 cubic feet of stoue was used for reclaiming the swamp on the south east edge of Manama and 34,000 cubic feet of town rubbish as filling. Slaughter House- The building was repaired, re-roofed and painted, and an additional room was added. Adari Spring. On behalf of the Government the Municipality repaired the Adari mosque and planted ornamental trees around the pool. A bridge was made across the main channel. Pier. A pier was built on Government Road to contain stone and juss which is imported for sale and which would otherwise be landed on the road.22 Other work carried on by the Municipality during the year included the manufacture and sale of ice daring the summer, upkeep of lunatic asylum, sale of meat at reduced prices during Ramadan and burial of paupers. The sum of Rs. 4 000 was set aside as a contribution towards a hospital. The town and bazaars during the year were kept in a clean and sanitary condition and compare very favourably with other towns in the Persian Gulf. The effective work of the Municipality is due very greatly to the activity of the Secretary of the Municipal Council, Mohammed Saleh Shatter. Muharraq Municipality. I he revenue during the year was Rs. 49,418 and the expenditure Rs. 46,869. Muharraq has not benpfited as much as Manama from improved conditions result.ng from development of the oil industry. Muharraq is, and always has been the centre of the diving industry and this industry is in a depressed condition' The leading men of Muharraq are the important boat owners and pearl dealers and most of them are in a financially precarious condition. Muharraq shop-keeners and house owners complain that until the causeway is completed there will be littlp improvement m local trade The bazaar in Muharraq which is less up to date than Manama, is not patronised by the money spending foreign employees of the Bahrain PetioJeum Company and few of the Company's employees rent houses in Muharraa The value of house property is very low, large houses, built in Arab style, can be rented or purchased for almost half the amount which would have to be oaid for simi ar property in Manama. The municipality of Muharraq is slightly somnolent and apart from keeping he town comparatively clean it makes little notLable progress Muharraq Municipality has always been content to follow the lead of the Manama Municipality, but a considerate distance behind.

Education. During the year a new school was opened on the out-skirts of Bndeva UMprOTide for the needs of Budeya, Draaz and Bern Jumra. As the people nf Bn'deva are Arab), Sunni, and the inhabitants of the other two villages, are Shias, If Swfand one Sunni teachers were appointed. The arrangement has on the Xle ^n satisfactory in spite of the fact that in the past there was bitter ill feeling between the different communities in this district. Over a thousand students are now being educated at the Government schools which exist in the following towns and villages . Muharraq Boys' School Girls' School Manama Boys' School Girls' School Hedd Boys' School Rafaa Boys' School Suk al-Khamis Boys' School Bitra Boys' School Budeya Boys' School Technical School. Important progress has been made during the year in developing technical education in the Boys'Schools. In Manama a new building onnosite the Boys' School was completed and taken over as a carpentry and eng - neering shop. There are six boys in each of these classes and another six boys fn the Muharraq carpentry class. A regular course, lasting for two years has been arranged in these subjects but it was found necessary, in order to persuade boys to stay on at school, to pay them a small wage. Students at the tec ^ lca ' school are granted an allowance of Rs. 15 per month of which they receive Rs 10 monthly and remainder on completion of the two years course. Without this financial inducement boys will not remain at school when tbey know they can get paid work elsewhere. The carpentry classes are mainly occupied with making furniture and have produced some very good work during the year. The engineering class has only recently begun. Athletics. Physical exercises are now included in the programme of the Manama and Muharraq Schools under the direction of one of the new masters who is an experienced athletic instructor. There has been a visible the physical appearance of the boys in the Manama and Muharraq Schools during the last year or two, this is partly owing to the general 'mproveme^ m loc conditions and partly because the boys keep regular hours and have been pla) g organised games on four or five days in the week instead of loafing about. Students Abroad. One young woman is being trained as a school ^ the British Training College in Beyrout, it is proposed to send two more gn Is to this institution next term. One youth is being trained in Shera Law and religious education at the Islamieh College at Lucknow. Two sons of Shaikh Mohamad bm Isa-al-Khahfah are being educated, at Government expense, at Beyrout Universi y, an dozen other hoys from the Government schools, sons of local merchants, are hei g educated at Beyrout at their parents'expense. ^Iwut a dozen boys, who previously in the Government schools, have been sent by their paren s24 India. In the past very few boys from Bahrain were educated abroad but during recent years the number who go to India or to Syria has increased. The standard of education in the Bahrain Government schools is not high, the schools are elementary schools and those in the country do not aim at teaching more than the three Rs so people requiring advanced education must seek it abroad. In spite of the openings for employment w T ith the Bahrain Petroleum Company there do not exist in Bahrain a vast number of clerical posts to be filled by locally trained boys and any large increase in the number of young men who are educated in the schools is likely to be a source of trouble in the future. Girls' Schools. The work of the girls' schools during the year has been satisfactory, the number of pupils has increased slightly. A very successful exhibition of needlework was held in Manama school. The work, especially embroidery, was of very high quality. General. Annual Audit. According to the practice which has been adopted for several years the accounts of all Government Departments were audited by represen tatives of Messrs. Whinney Murray &amp; Co., Baghdad, chartered accountants, who visited Bahrain in the first month of the year. A report was submitted by the accountant suggesting some minor improvements in systems of accounts. The accounts themselves, which were those of the year 1355, were found to be in order. New Staff. Mr. H. D. Furber was appointed Assistant State Engineer especially to carry out the duties of gauging oil for royalty purposes and for shippino- requirements. He commenced duties on 21st September 1937. Mr. K. P. Narayan, previously Head Clerk, was appointed Secretary to the Adviser, Syed Mahmood bin Syed Ahmed Alawi was appointed Head Clerk, Adviserate. Sardar Abdul Rahman Khan was appointed as Factor to His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad to manage His Highness's private estates. Mr. A. M. Jaffar was appointed Superintendent, Public Works Department. Mr. A. C. Braganza was appointed as Accounts Officer. His Highness's Pilgrimage. From 2nd January 1938 until 2nd March 1938 His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad was absent from Bahrain on the Pil^rima^e He was accompanied by numerous relations and followers, in all a party of about seventy persons. He appointed during his absence, a Council of Regency consisting of Shaikh Abdulla, Shaikh Sultan and, the Adviser to the Government. Visit of His Royal Highness Amir Saoud. In December 1937 (Shawwal 1356) His Royal Highness the Amir Saoud paid a visit to Bahrain. He was accompanied by a number of brothers and cousins. He was the guest of the Ruler of Bahrain for eight days. His visit coincided with the annual celebrations of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad's accession. Cinema. Permission was granted by the Government to The Bahrain Theatre Company to open a Cinema m Bahrain and a piece of ground on the south side of Manama town was leased to the Company on along lease. The company consists of several of the younger Shaikhs of the Ruling Family as well as two local Arab merchants. Building was begun during the year. Juma Mosque. Tbe Juma Mosque in Manama was enlarged and almost entirely re-built. Funds were collected by publ.c subscription and the (Jovernment and H.s Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad made considerable contributions towards the work A m-naret, which is to be 100 feet high, is in the course of construction The work is being carried out under the supervision of a committee of local merchantsA25 Nationality Law. The Bahrain nationality law was published on 5th May 1937. On Ist November 1937 the notification that nationals of Iran were subject to the clauses regarding ownership of property was issued. This legislation was followed by a certain number of applications from subjects of Iran for Bahrain citizenship. Bus Services. A great increase took place during the year in motor bus services not only between Manama and Awali but between Manama and many of the country villages and towns. Broadcasting. The Arabic broadcasting programme from London was well received in Bahrain. There has been a great increase in the number of wireless sets installed in Manama and Muharraq. Press Propaganda. Several long articles appeared in the Egyptian and Iraqi press regarding Bahrain. The articles were written with the intention of creating bad feeling between the people of Bahrain and the Bahrain Petroleum Company and were also violently anti-English. Certain of less reputable Indian newspapers published untrue reports of alleged labour disputes in Bahrain. This propaganda has had no effect in Bahrain where the relations between the Government and the public, and Bahrain Petroleum Company continue to be consistently friendly. Government Rest House. A Government Rest House was opened towards the end of the year in what used to be the Customs Officer's quarters above the present Police Station. The situation is central being opposite the pier and:close to the bazaar. Permission to occupy rooms in the Rest House has to be obtained from the Government. The charge is Rs. 15 per day inclusive. Only four persons can be accomodated in the Rest House at once unless rooms are shared. Since it was opened the Rest House has scarcely ever been untenanted and at times it has been occupied to its full capacity. From the time that it was opened until the end of the year under review a small profit, less than Rs. 100, was made. A Rest House of this type was very badly needed especially for the accommodation of Government guests. Private Building Enterprise. A number of new buildings were constructed in Manama during the year the chief among them being the present offices and quarters of the Petroleum Concessions Limited which occupies an important site on the eastern side of the Customs Square. The Bahrain Petroleum Company filling station, the first of its kind in the Persian Gulf, is slightly east of the Petroleum Concessions Limited's building with a frontage on Government Road. These buildings have done much to improve the appearance of the sea front. The alue of land in Manama has risen greatly during the year owing to the prices paid for several large properties. Prices of date gardens in the country have declined. House rents in Manama have continued to soar owing to the gre^it demand lor small houses. In Muharraq rents are low and house property is very cheap. Electric Supply Department. Report by Mr. W. B. Steele, State Engineer. The current consumption for the year 1356 shewed an increase of 63402 units over 1355. This was due to;— 1. Extra connected load amounting to 73 kw. 2. Additional apparatus such as wireless sets, table fans, etc. AIbo more use being made of lighting by consumers.26 The nature of the new load connected during 1356 was as follows : Lighting and fan points 54 kw. (911 points). Power (motors) 18 „ Refrigerators 1 „ 73 kw. In addition to the light and fan points wired 529 switch-plugs were installed in various houses etc., and miscellaneous apparatus such as wireless sets, etc., provided an extra intermittent load. Revenue from energy supplied during 1356 amounted to Rs. 81,885-13-0 as compared with Rs. 60,108-5-0 in 1355. Increase Rs. 21,777-8-0. • i . &lt; 233 new premises have been wired during the year. In Manama 208 premises. In Muharraq 25 „ Total consumers connected to date 938. Maximum load received 173. 9 kw- Total kilowatts connected to date 354. Total kilowatts installed in Power House 200. Wiring Contracts. In 1356 permission was given by the Government to three local merchants, viz., Haji Salman Abdulla Al-Zayani Haji Khalil Ebrahim Kanoo Haji Yusuf Fakhroo to carry out wiring work in the State, the work to be tested by the Government before use. This action was necessary owing to the increased demand for wiring. Permises were wired as follows during the year 1356 :— Haji Salman Al-Zayani 169 premises Haji Khalil Kanoo 10 „ Haji Yusuf Fakhroo 16 „ Total 195 The Electricity Department, however, continued to carry out wiring of Government and certain other premises as follows, including the following :— New Law Courts. Education Department, Technical School. Wiring at Fort. Police Barracks. New Wireless Station. New Custom House and Residence. Government Rest House. Government Motor Repair Shop. Office and Residence of the Petroleum Concessions Limited.27 Temporary Wiring. During the year 1356 the cities of Manama and Muharraq were specially illuminated on two occasions, to celebrate the Coronation of His Majesty King George the Sixth, and on the anniversary of the accession of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad Bin Isa al-Khalifah, Euler of Bahrain. 2000 lights were temporarliy installed on each occasion, and the load reached approximately 174 kw. Main Extension. A pole line was run from the R.A.F. Rest House to the Passengers' Shelter of Messrs. Imperial Airways, Limited, at the end of the H.A.F., Pier at Godhaibia. Poles and material have been ordered for the lighting of Prior Road, i.e., from Fakhroo's Amara at Nairn to the junction of Sea Road and Prior Road, a dis tance of approximately 650 yards. Alterations to Mains. Twelve poles have been diverted at Muharraq and re -erected, this was necessary owing to the widening of certain streets. New Generating Set. Owing to the inreased demand for lighting aand power a new 6-cylinder 300 BHP generating set direct-coupled to a 200 kw. alternator was ordered in 1356. The necessary space for this was left in the present Power House when it was first erected. Financial Position. A gross profit of Rs. 40,354 for the year, after meeting all charges (including Rs. 6,720 customs duty paid to the Bahrain Government) was made. After deducting depreciation amounting to Rs. 15,712 a net profit of Rs. 24,642/13/4 remains. This was due to increased revenue from energy sold, and certain revenue from sundry sales and wiring contracts. It has been decided, for this year only, to allocate to Reserve (shown in the balance sheet as added depreciation) the sum of Rs. 15,342/3/2, leaving a net profit of Rs. 9,300/10/2 only. Depreciaton on the plant has always been, and will continue to be rated, at a somewhat high rate to allow for all contingencies. Telephone Department. The number of subscribers connected or contracted for to the end of 1356 was 59. The question of installing an automatic exchange was considered but the matter is being held in abeyance for the time being. In the meantime, in order to deal with extra subscribers a new 20-line Ericsson Board has been ordered to line up with the present exchange frames, making the total number of lines available sixty-five. Transport Depatrment. A new repair shop was built near the Government Power House in 1356 and opened in Rabi-al-Awal 1356. This is intended mainly as a maintenance Department for (rovernment cars. It functioned quite satisfactorily during the year and cars have been kept in better working condition and properly maintained. At present the number of Government and Municipal vehicles, including two fire engines, and two road rollers, is twenty. Fire Department A new 'Merryweather' fire engine capable of pumping 120 'aliens per minute at 150 lbs. per square inch and equipped with a 500 gallon tank was purc hased during 1356, and a section of the State Police is being trained in its operation, and in fire drill. In connection with fire precautions nine artesian wells have been provided with suction troughs from which the fire engine can obtain a supply. It is also proposed to drill a special well in the centre of the bazaar for fire purposes fire practice is carried out in the average twice weekly. A number of chemical fire extinguishers have been obtained and placed where necessary.28 The Municipality of Manama has purchased a combined fire engine and water cart, and this is used in conjunction with the Government engine and apparatus, when required. Traffic Section. Four hundred and fifteen drivers were examined for motor driving licenses during 1356 out of which 200 passed. Owing to the increase in the number of motor accidents, baffles were fitted to all motor vehicles plying for public hire, the intention being to limit the speed to 50 kilometres per hour, which is the speed limit in the State for such vehicles. This measure has resulted in a considerable reduction in the number of accidents. Steps have been taken to prevent the overloading of car chassis by super imposing bodies too heavy and of too large a carrying capacity. Municipal Ice Plant. The Municipal ice plants were operated by this Depart ment in 1356. 200 tons of ice were produced and sold by the Baladya. The season's run was successful and a profit was made by the Municipality. At the end of the season the old iceplant was removed from its site in the Power House to make room for the new generating set. The old ice plant will be re-erected in an annexe to be added to the present ice plant house for operation in 1357. School Engineering Workshop. An engineering workshop for training of senior school boys has been built and equipped by the Government, the equipment consisting at present of a complete carpentry section and an engineering section. The following plant and machinery are installed or have been ordered;— One Shearing Machine. One Sawing Machine. One Drilling Machine. One Wood Lathe. Two Grind Stones. Two Emery Wheels. A complete Blacksmith's Outfit. Bend Tools, etc. for six students. 1 One Electric Welding Plant. One Pipe Screwing Machine. One 6' Lathe (Power). One Oxy-acetyline Welding Plant. The students work to a properly drawn up Engineering Course, four hours of each day being spent in workshop practice and two hours in lectures, drawing etc. English is also taught. The course is of two years' duration, which includes six months in the workshops of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited, who are co-operating with the Government in the training and employment of local boys. General. In addition to supervising the various sections mentioned in this report, the State 'Engineer personally carried out all oil Koyalty gauging at the Refinery of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited and witnessing of all tank gauging and oil tests on behalf of the Bahrain Petroleum Company an^/or the buyers. The State Engineer also carries out the testing and examining of all public vehicles in the State. Connected load is expected to increase during the coming year, and inquiries for power load, which is needed, are on the increase.Law Courts, open courtyard and platform. Open Courtyard in the Law Courts.29 A sewage and public water supply scheme for the city of Manama is under consideration and is being prepared by the State Engineer's Department, and will eventually be carried out in sections, commencing with a sewer for the Police barracks from the Manama Fort to the sea. Owing to the levels, pumping will have to be resorted to in certain sections. A new power plant consisting of 2-10kw. Kohler lighting sets (3/phase, 230 volts) has been installed near the Palace of His Highness Shaikh Sir Hamad bin Isa al-Khalifah, k.c.i.e , o.s.i.. Ruler of Bahrain, at Sakhir for the lighting of the Palace, and other residences in the vicinity.34 Customs Department. Report for the year 1356 by the Director of• Customs Mr. C. C. L. de Grenier.

RATES OF DUTY Customs Duty is levied at the following rates ;— Upon alcoholic and tobacco products ... 15% ad valorem Upon certain scheduled 'luxury ' products ... 10% ad valorem Upon all other imported commodities ... 5% ad valorem Upon re-exported commodities ... 2% ad valorem Upon transhipped commodities ... 1|% ad valorem There is a tariff upon certain items of native produce, based upon a valuation of 5% a.v., which is designed for the assistance of illiterate itinerate traders to enable such men to know beforehand what charges they will have to meet when bringing their imports to Bahrain for disposal here. It is thought that this tariff prevents ex ploitation by local brokers, and it is adjusted from time to time in regard to local market values. By the Government of Bahrain's Proclamation No. 33/1356, the duty upon transhipped commodities to the State of Qatar is 5% a.v. This Proclamation declared what had been the legal position, although by misinterpretation it had been thought that the ra^e of duty upon re-exported cargo was 2% a.v. The reduction in tranship ment Duty from 5% to 2% which was made about 15 years ago was in the case of imports to ports of Saoudi Arabia. A Comparison of Classified Receipts.

(a) Steamers' Cargoes. Apart from the large quantity of cargo which is admitted duty-free, there has been a great increase in the quantities of general merchandise imported by local competing merchants. The optimism which created this boom is based upon the prosperity created by the local expenditure of the Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd., and its staff ; but it is exaggerated and unlikely to be maintained, since this Company's staff, on re-roganisation, is being reduced, and its spending power is less. Already it is noticed that importers are slower in taking up clearances, and the bazaar trading is duller than in 1355. If existing conditions continue, I do not think it likely that the year 1357 will show so marked an increase as the present one. (h) Native Craft. This improvement in receipts is due to a revival in the traffic in fish oil from Africa, and in flour from Iraq, and to a preference by native nakhudhas to selling their goods in Bahrain, where the bazaar prices have been steadily better than in other Gulf ports. Thus the Native Craft manifests issued at Karachi do not ensure that the commodi ties are actually discharged at the ports declared therein. (c) Postal Parcel Duty. Here the increase is mainly due to imports of personal requirements by the personnel of the Bahrain Petroleum Coy., Ltd. (d) Passengers Baggage Duty. This increase is due to greater activity among itinerant traders travelling with 'deck cargo' between India, Iran, and Bahrain, chiefly carpets and gilims. (e) Export Duty. This increase is mainly due to activity in the export to Europe of 'Lingah' shells; although there has been noticeable drop in the quantity of Qatif dates exported to India. (f) Direct Transhipment Duty. This marked decrease (by about one-third) is due partly to the California Arabia Standard Oil Comp my having for the time being completed their imports of necessary machinery, and partly to the cessation of traffic between Bahrain and D'bai, which is also a port of call for the B. I. S. N. Coy's steamers. (g.h.) I he increase in Miscellaneous and Import Yard receipts normally follow an increase in the quantities of packages brought here as steamers' cargoes, notably case cargo. Comparative Values. It is of interest to consider the values and quanti ties of the principal commodities imported :— Y ear 1355 Year 1356 Commodity. Quantity Average value Quantity Average value Rs. Rs. Rice 3,63,284 cwts 19,98,320 3,83,832 cwts 21,57,220 Wheat 26,353 1,09,490 13,468 72,360 Flour 39,187 1,90,670 54,231 3,13,820 Coffee 4,479 bags 2,14,440 11,103 bags 4,75,270 Sugar (loaf) 7,216 47,720 7,850 58,330 Sugar (soft) 77,282 cwts 3,08,810 15,240 cwts 65,190 Sugar (crystal) 5,200 26,330 3,150 55 18,930 Tea 2,646 c/s 2,01,400 5,657 c/s 3,77,520 Cottons • • • 15,84,680 23,60,380 Silks • • • 3,22,080 5,95,70037 The decrease in the quantity of wheat is offset by the increase in the quantity of wheat flour, and is the natural result of the closing down of the local flour milling industry which was started with Government encouragement but was not properly worked by those concerned. While the Government has suffered no loss by this neglect, purchase money which might have come into Bahrain has been diverted to Iraq. The increase in the quantity of coffee is interesting because in' 1355 a large quantity of Yemen coffee was imported here; but this commodity has lost ground in favour of Singapuri coffee, the cost of the latter having fallen by about 40% below the previous year. Also, the decrease in Java soft sugar is due partly to the local market being over-stocked, and partly to an increase in its cost by about 25%. Imports of crystal sugar have decreased, also on account of over-stocking. The cost of cotton having increased by about 40%, the value of imports, also of silk, would naturally be greater. Here it may be remarked that although large quantities of Japanese piece goods are imported, there is a tendency among the better class to buy the better and more lasting English piecegoods.

It is not to be expected that European cement will compete in the local market, but Indian cement is preferred to Japanese as being both better and better packed.38 Piecegoods. The local market is skill full of Japanese piece goods, (bought on long term contracts); but, as anticipated, the cost of same has increased, as the following comparison will show :— Comparison of Values per Piece.

Pearling Licenses. In view of the depression in the pearl market and the increasing difficulty in collecting the license dues, it was decided, after the end of the season of 1355, to halve the amounts of the pearling licenses for the season 1356. This was done by Government Proclamation No. 42/1355; and the period for payment was also extended. Consequently it was to be expected that the collections from this source would be at least one-half of those in 1355. This fact explains, to a great extent, the drop from Rs. 34,500 to Rs. 16,313, a loss of Rs. 18,187, that is 53% of the Budget estimate. It is, however, a fact that the number of craft licenses for pearling in 1357 was 271 as compared with 264 in 1356 an increase of 7 craft. The value of the catch and its quantity was nearly 50% greater than in 1355, and the crews' earnings were also greater. But immediately after the pearling season had closed the sale prices slumped and hence the tajirs have been left either with heavy losses on realisation, or with their stocks unsold.39 Movements of Steamers: —T)uring th© yGfir 1 &lt;^5G, tlir66 liundrftd Qiild forty-si^ steamers visited Bahrain as compared with two hundred and fifty-one in 1355.

Prior to the cessation of traffic with Qatar, nineteen craft had visited this port, and this cessation accounts for the decrease in traffic here with the Oman Coast.41 Bahrain Registered Craft. The local boat-bailding industry is by no means flourishing, nor likely to be until the pearling industry improves. There is a sliglit improvement upon the position in 1355, as indicated in the following tables: Kegistered craft at the end of 1355 Newly built in 1356 American motor-dinghys imported Foreign launches newly registered Foreign craft newly registered New craft fitted with old engine Launches converted to sail LESS: Sold to foreign ports ; Removed by owner to foreign port Old craft broken Lost at sea New Craft sold to foreign port all kinds at end of 1356 Totals Barges. 1 Motor Craft.

It would be a good thing for mter-Gu f traffic f the native craft carrying cargo from D'bai, Sharja and Kuweit should also carry manifests, thus ensuring equality of treatment on the Arabian side of the Gull Complaints are also heard that the Registration papers of Bahrain craft are destroyed by Government officials on the Iran side of the ( tiiIi . * A , 'thin the Port On 6th April 1937 the s.s. ' Akagisan Mam ' of ftie Mitsui Line discharged into a native craft three hundred and sixty bags of Oita Portland Japanese cement. The craft foundered en route to the shore, its contents r^i^g lost f but the craft was afterwards raised, and did not become a danger to navigation. There were no casualties. On 19th December 1937, the Government launch on Quarantine service came into collision with another motor launch, and was badly damaged. It was towed ashore for repairs, but there were no casualties. • • i • * .. p_ rt There has been no improvement in the lighting of the nort dmln ' the past year, which has never been entirely satisfactory and the mcreasing traffic demands an improvement, especially on the Manamah side, where is the best anchorage in Bahrain. The anchorage at Sitrah, while suitable for service42 of tankships, is not well adapted for cargo owing to (1) the distance from the shore which causes delay in landing cargo, and (2) the shallowness of the foreshore causes further delay in discharging ships between tides, especially in stormy weather when the sea-water is blown away up the khor. The West Spit Buoy near the Fesht al Yarim is unlighted, although on two occasions a promised light-buoy has been diverted to another spot. This buoy should be lighted with a red flash. Further, to enable steamers at night-time to obtain a bearing and make their course into the port, a white flash should be put upon the local Portuguese Fort, as was suggested some years ago. General. The construction of the Customs Pier at Manamah was first commenced about 1918-1920, the intention being to extend the pier to the deep water to make the handling of cargo independent of the tides. This work was stopped in 1923 and the end faced with stone in 1924j» To pay for this work the charge of ' Pier Fees ' was levied; and this is still being collected, on all imports. The necessity for this extension is greater than ever; and while the construc tion of a mole for a further six hundred yards to the deep water is under contemplation, which will be of assistance to passenger traffic, the present situation urgently calls for:- (a) The extension of the whole Pier to the deep water, (b) The construction of suitable warehouses for cargo, (c) The construction of two small docks for native craft in the present basin which is silting up, and (d) The extension of the trolley lines and lighting service accordingly, with removal of existing trolley lines on the public highway. Co-incident w T ith this, the present Import Warehouse in the town, which is the largest warehouse in the Gulf, and occupies a very valuable site, should be surren dered to the Government for the construction of a modern bazaar, this value more than off-setting the cost of the above extension, which could be paid for by the collections of Pier Fees being converted into a Sinking Fund, instead of lying in the Consolidated Fund. The collections of Pier Fees during the past nine years exceed two lakhs of rupees. The immediate needs are (1) a warehouse for cargo balances and also for defective cargo, to replace the one taken by the Government and converted into shops ; (2) a warehouse for storage and examination of passengers' baggage, (3) the repairing and re-paintiag of the roof of the Import shed, last done in 1930, and (4) the repainting and repairing of the Pier Shed, last done in December 1935 with one coat only of red oxide, and (5) general repairs to the Trolley system which is not wearing well, and provision for some suitable furniture in the Customs offices. Establishment. During the past year the number of clerks employed was reduced by one, and two apprentices were added, bringing the total clerical staff to twenty-three, who drew Rs. 37,356 in salaries, an increase upon last year on account of regular annual increments, and restoration of housing allowances. The menials number 37, who drew Rs 11,236 in wages. In addition to the collection of Customs dues and the receiving, handling, and delivery of 7,54,354 packages of cargo, with the necessary records, the quantity of non-dutiable cargo also dealt with amounted to the large figure of 4,27,000 packages in respect of which there is no income. The services of two clerks are practically wholly occupied with the preparation of extensive and detailed statistical work required for publication by the Political Agency.43 While the work of the past year has greatly increased, my confidence m improved trading activity has heen justified ; and although 1 do not anticipa e an equal increase for the year 1357, yet I think this year can be regarded with confidence, except in the pearling industry. The Zubara Dispute. During the months of May, June and July incidents occurred in Qatar which caused resentment in Bahrain and resulted in the Bahrain (Tovernment breaking o all commercial relations and intercourse with Qatar. A quarrel took place between the Shaikh of Qatar and the Naim tribe who normillv resided in the neighbourhood of Zubara. The Nairn tribe have always regarded themselves and have been considered by the Ruler of Bahrain to be su )jec s nf the Shaikhs of Bahrain. The chiefs of the tribe receive allowances m the Civil List from the Bahrain Government and many of the tribe own houses in Muharraq and in Halat al Nairn, one of the islands beyond Hedd, m which they hve durmg part of the year. Zubara, on the north coast of Qatar, is the original home of theAl-Khalifah who created a flourishing settlement there and a town of political and cotnmei imnortance in about 1717, when, with other Arab tribes, they moved south from Kuwait. Zubara was then of sufficient importance for ^ exoeditions against it, which were repulsed by the Ivhahfah. In 11M the M a coCered Bahrain but they did not abandon Zubara but continued to occupy . for a considerable time. When in the early 19th century Bahrain was for a short time in the occupation of Oman, the Khalifah retired to Zubara. In 1811 Zubara was conquered by Muscat and the town was destroyed. It i if Kv fhp Klrilifah In 186B Doha and Wakrah were sacked by the was , b y. alltes Partly owing to this Shaikh Mohamad bin Khalifah was forced to iTave B^rlin^d ^Reeled by his brother Shaikh Ali who was kil ed after rdgnTng for one year and was succeeded by Shaikh Isa, the father of the present Ruler. Tn 1874 the Beni Hajar tribe besieged the Nairn tribe in Zubara but were , . ^ 1 1 , ri l the following year there was more fighting. The Nairn who driven otf. 1 - j as his own subjects, obtained support from Bahrain. the Bin Ali tribe crossed from Bahrain to Zubara preparatory to making an WATS sent to Zubara and A ' t town w hich is on the sea shore, is present day Zubara reraamec • ' whicl ; is about a ' m Ue inland, is partly ruined although much of the outer walls ire standing and the large mosque within the walls is still in fairly good condition. In Anril 1937 there was a quarrel between the Nairn tribe and the umv&gt; -7' fhP litter complained to the Shaikh of Qatar who appointed certain Al Ramazin , the &lt; ^ ^ fv.p north roast of Oatar. The Naim complained to Arabs as customs inspectors Oat'ir was infringing the rights of Bahrain the Ruler of Bahrain that the Sh^ ^^'o™ of Bahrain assuring SU ftS hn-.'S d.S .. «' B*,..

Thfl ^^haikh of Bahrain when the quarrel first began protested against the Lhe bhaikh ot Danrd.1 , whom he claimed as his own Shaikh of Qatar's interference with the JN aim xnue subjects living within Bahrain territory. m u . n i • i •, 'RnVirflin earlv in May. Shaikh Abdulla bin Negotiations were begun ouinhQiLian His Highness's eldest son, Isa, His Highness s ^h^' :! l u of oXr's deieoates were Nasir bin Attiah of the -''' ~44 was unfortunate, the former although a respectable person was illiterate and of no political or social importance, the latter was notoriously persona non grata in Bahrain. After the first meeting, with the concurrence of both parties, the Adviser to the Bahrain Government took part in the negotiations. Conversations, which were held on two or three days every week, lasted until the end of June. Although the Bahrain representatives made every effort to reach an agreement, short of entirely withdrawing their claim, the negotiations were a complete failure. Towards the end of June His Highness Shaikh Hamad proposed that his representatives should meet some of the sonior members of Shaikh Abdulla's familv in order to discuss the matter. It was arranged that the Bahrain delegates should meet Shaikh Abdulla s brother and son at Ghareyah on the north coast of Qatar. The negotiations in Bahrain were terminated, by the Qatar representatives who refused to inform their principal of the last suggestions made by Bahrain. The nnal meeting in Bahrain ended in atmosphere of bitter acrimony. The Bahrain representatives, accompanied by the Adviser, who abstained from taking part in the actual discussions, arrived at Ghareyah at the end of June and remamed there for about five days. The Bahrain party, which included some of the young Shaikhs and about thirty retainers and servants, remained most of the time in their launches only coming ashore for meetings. The Qatar Shaikhs took this opportunity of staging a deliberate demonstration of force bv concent rating large numbers of armed Bedu, on the shore who were brought to the place in motor lorries. Ihis action did not make for the success of the negotiations which ended m failure. iv. - r Wa u back . fr0I *J ^hareyah, while passing the north coast of Qatar the Bahrain launches anchored some distance out at sea and watched fighting taking place on the shore between the Qatar forces and the Nairn. In the fighting which ensued there were about a dozen casulties on each side, among the Naim Arabs who were killed were several of the personal retainers of the Ruler of Bahrain' who belonged to the Nairn tribe and had their families in Qatar and lived sometimes in Bahrain and sometimes in Qatar. Eventually the Naim surrendered and handed over a number of their rifles. As soon as the Qatar forces had withdrawn, the whole &gt;.aim tribe with their tents, families and flocks, moved over to Bahrain where they were generously received. Later a number of them crossed from Bahrain to Saoudi Arabia where they found better grazing for their camels and sheep than in Bahrain. Those of Jhem who owned houses and property in Muharraq and Halat al IS aim remamed in Bahrain. r Jhe (Tmernment of Bahrain then terminated all intercourse with Qatar and apart from authorised messengers there has been no intercourse between the two states since the final events described in this note. . Zubara, the subject of this quarrel, is a place of no apparent value. The town is entirely in ruins, the fort is rapidly crumbling to pieces, there is no water except a few wells which frequently become dry and the land is barren and saltv Ihe few villages within the Zubara area are miserable groups of mud huts inhabited by almost starving Arabs. The Khalifah, and the Arabs of Bahrain however regard Zubara as their ancestral home, which in fact it is, they remember that their ancestors and the early Khalifah Shaikhs built Zubara and are buried there and ifc M ? nc ; ient f lories » although during recent years visits to Zubara bv the Khalifah Shaikhs have been rare, yet they resent the claim of Qatar that Bahrain has no rights over Zubara. That the reason of the quarrel is a matter of principle and sentiment makes it all the more difficult to arrive at an understanding47 Note on 1357 Budget.
