Besides the intrinsic^ merits of the work, its authenticity and antiquity induced me to regard it as the most important of all compositions on the subject of Oriental Geography. A bulfeda informs us, that E drisi , E bn K hordadbah, and many other writers of high reputation, have only traced, ony PREFACE. paper, the footsteps of Ebn Haukal*, who, it appears from his own words, had actually visited most of the places which he describes. Although the exact epoch of his birth and death is still un~ known to me, I have not hesitated to announce Ebn Haukal as an author of the tenth century. That he wrote before the building of Cairo, we learn from his account of Egypt in the following work, page 30; and after the accession of Abdar- rahman, who, in his time, governed Andalus, or Spain, appears from p. 28. The foundation of modern Cairo was laid in the year q 08 of the Christian JEra, tt/id Abdarrah- man assumed the government of Spain in the year 902 of the same Mra, or of the Hegira 290. Thus we may ascertain, ■K- I that Ebn Haukal flourished before the year 9O8, and after the year 902 ; and we cannot err considerably if we place him in the middle, or, perhaps, in the beginning, of the tenth century f . He is styled, by Ed nisi and Abulfeda, simply * Chorasmia et Maweralnahr de script to, ex tabulis Ahulfedct, &amp;c. Quarto, London, i 650, p. 2. t This date is confirmed by another passage in our Author s description of Maweralnahr, or Transoxania, page 235. He there informs us, that he conversed with a respectable personage, who had served in the armies of Nasser Ahmed. This Prince, of the M /C-' / '• - • ./v ; ~ ^ ■ fa. • '&gt; 4 , ,&gt;/ •. . : ■ ' • 'J '' s - - ' HPREFACE. iii Jo^ Haukal, or ^ Ebn Haukal: But it appears, from one copy of his work deposited among the Oriental manuscripts in the Library at Ley den*, that his name was (^j! ^UJI Abi l'Cassem Ebn Haukal. The work itself, in the original Arahick, according to the Catalogue of the Ley den Library, above quoted, is called UCJI^JI l XI WI v-jU/^Kitab al Mesalek al Memalek. The Persian translation which I have used, and the copy preserved at Eton f, bear the same title, with the omission of the Ara- bick article, and (in my copyJ the addition of the copulative, thus : j l - AX / T Under this name the ancient Tarikh, or Chronicle of Tab a ri, quotes it in a passage which I shall hereafter adduce* * t Samanian family, became Sovereign of Maweralnahr, Anno Hegiree 301, (A. D. 9 1 2.) If Ebn Haukal could have spoken with a contemporary of Nasser Ahmed, one who had been of sufficient age to attend him in his battles, we cannot, rea sonably, assign a later date to the composition of this work than the middle of the tenth century. * See No, 1704, page 47 8, of the Catal.

The instances, however frequent, of incorrectness and vari ations which occur in the present work, do not hy any means surprise me. After a close application to Eastern literature for nine or ten years, during which I have turned over some thousands of written volumes, and attentively collated pas sages in several hundreds, I no longer expect to find in Arabick, Persian, or Turkish manuscripts (the Koran always excepted), either accuracy of transcribing, fidelity of trans lation, or exactness of quotation. Thus, a heavy cloud of uncertainty and confusion still hangs on the Geography of Edrisi, notwithstanding the learned labours of Kurzmann and of Hartmann, who notice the numei^ous defects of the printed editions, the variations of the manuscript copies, the different titles of the same book, the uncertain age and country of the author, &amp;cC / O/ 7 Ebn Hatjkal's work, had there been found a perfect copy in the original Arabick, it is most probable that the pleasure of offering this translation to the Publick would not have been reserved for me. &lt;( We must lament,' says the in-PREFACE. ikhmm genious Koehler* ' that no letter copy of the Mesalek al Memalekf exists, than the manuscript preserved in the Li brary at Leyden, which is exceedingly imperfect and very badly written.' It seems, indeed, the lot of Ebn Haukal 5 work, in whatsoever form it appears, to be censured for incorrectness and defects, by writers of different ages, and of different countries; for to the passage above quoted, we may add the following from Abulfeda : J I ^ I laX/u2J Aj!

I must now hear testimony against the Persian transcripts which I have used. Of the difficulties arising from an irregular combination of letters, the confusion of one word with another, and the total omission, in some lines, of the diacritical points, I should not complain, because habit and persevering attention have ena bled me to surmount them in passages of general description, or sentences of common construction; but in the names of persons or of places never before seen or heard of, and which the context could not assist in deciphering, when the diacriti cal points were omitted, conjecture alone could supply them, or collation with a more perfect manuscript. The former I have seldom indulged, and the latter has enabled me, in se veral instances, to ascertain the true reading; and even the few names in which I have supplied the diacritical points from conjecture, are pointed out to the reader by a note, or other wise. Notwi t list an di ng what I have just said, and although the most learned writers on Hebrew, Arabick, and Persian Litera ture, have made observations on the same subject, it mayxx PREFACE. perhaps, he necessary to demonstrate, by a particular example, the extraordinary influence of those diacritical points, which, as they are essential parts of letters, must not he confounded with the vowel points or accents.

According to Edrisi's Geo- translatlon of Elmakin, is much to my present purpose, I shall give it here.

The far sang or parasang (he saysJ, in the time of the Caianians, or second dynasty of Persian sovereigns, contained, according to ancient writers, three miles of twelve thousand feet.

The following passage, however, from the Borhan Kattea seems to fix the measure with precision : oT jc-Xaj AJ ^ CXAM !

These and many other matters, which in the following work appear obscure or difficult, it was my intention, when 1 under took this translation, to investigate with minute research, and to illustrate with ample explanations. On those subjects, also,, which seemed of the most curious and interesting nature, I collected a variety of notices, and extracted from several other Oriental Manuscripts, and from the works of European Antiquaries, Historians and Travellers, every passage that could contribute information. 4 ; . . v. , . ...... _ t r . i .... r ' \ . r . • I endeavoured, by examining the most ancient traditions pre served in Persian records, to ascertain whether the celebrated Ruins of Istakhar, often mentioned in the course of this work, ex hibit any monuments of the scriptural Elam J, * Arab, and Persian Diction, art. t Tour to Persia, quarto edition, Calcutta, i788,/&gt;. 17; Lwd. edit, octavo,p. 4.1. + Jeremiah, xlix.xxvi PREFACE.

On another part of this volume I was induced to bestow some inquiry, since it serves to illustrate, and is itself con firmed by, a Rabbinical work of high reputation.

I found, however, that these illustrations, whether to he printed in the form of notes., or as an appendix, would retard considerably the publication of my book, and render it doubly expensive by the addition of so much as another volume of equal size would scarcely contain. I therefore re solved to content myself with offering to the Publick a mere translation of Ebn Haukal's work, retaining what the Geo grapher and Critick will probably esteem the most essential part of the original, all names of places in the proper cha^ racter; and so exactly have I followed the orthography of my manuscript, that in many pages the same word will be found spelt differently, and even erroneously *. Some of the most obscure, difficult, or doubtful passages, I have remarked in short notes, or endeavoured to illustrate in the Appendix, where many are given in Persian. * Thus we find; in p. 48, Tiberiah and Tiberthah—z/7 several places, Isfahan, Sfahan, Ispahan, &amp;c. The Pyramids of Egypt (properly written or Ahram or Elheraman) are styled, in page 33, Houman or JElhouman.xxx PREFACE. The chief obscurity, as well as importance, consists in the proper names. From my accuracy, therefore, in observing the original orthography of these, every advantage which could result from a perusal of the manuscript is presented to Ihe reader-, for the passages merely descriptive or narrative contain few difficulties, and these few are noticed. The illustrations and notes above mentioned, as I have reason to hope that the time and labour spent in collecting them were not employed in vain, shall soon be offered to the Publiclc. They will form part of a JTork in which I propose to examine the Geographical System of the Asiaticks—to ex tract, from a multiplicity ofArabick and Persian Authors, their \ descriptions of Countries and Cities, Rivers, Mountains, Seas, Islands, &amp;c.—to give exact imitations of many original Maps preserved in rare and curious manuscripts; and to inquire how far the Geographers of Asia agree with those of ancient Greece and Rome, and with modern Europeans. I shall col lect all the traditions that can illustrate local History and Antiquities, and construct JSlaps, according to the best au thorities, 7ioi only of the Asiatick regions, but of Africa and Europe, as described by Eastern writers *. * Besides the Geographical Treatises of Abulfcdn, Edrisi and others, well knotvn to thePREFACE, xxxi In preparing for publication the Geography of E bn H au- kal, had I solicited, I would most probably have received, assistance from many learned friends ; and I should, in this place, with equal pride and pleasure, have followed the exam ple of those writers who appropriate a department of their Prefaces to a publick acknowledgment of their numerous obligations* But on this subject I shall not long detain the reader -, for puhlick, I have used, in compiling materials for this Work, a variety of Oriental Mann- * ■ scripts but little knotvn in Europe. Among these are the Cold) Heft Aklim, or Seven Climates, by Emir Rauzi ; the Shiraz Nameh, by Sheikh Zarkoab ; the Noxhat al Coloub of Hamdallah Mustoufi, so often quoted by D'Her- belot; the t-oLsr® Ajaieb al Boldan, or ' Wonders of Regions; the Tahkik al Irab, a Geographical Dictionary, /^Mohammed Saduk Isfa- hani j the Tohfut al Irakein, or Poetical Description of the two Iraks, Arabian, and Persian provinces, by the celebrated Khakani ; the t-oLsr^ Ajaieb al Gheraieb ; the Ajaieb al Mahkloucat; the jye Soural A- kalim ; the Seir al Belad ; the Geographical Index at the end of MirkhondV Rozet al Sefa, &amp;c. These, with the assistance of E bn H aukal's work, have enabled me to construct a Map of Persia and the adjacent provinces, on so large a scale as to admit a multiplicity of names not found in any other. It comprehends (on a sheet measuring six feet by Jive) nearly the same extent as Mr. JVahls celebrated Map, prefixed to his - ' Altes und Neues Vorder und Middel Asien and the names of places are written, not only in European characters, but respectively in Arabick, Persian, Armenian,PREFACE. my debt of gratitude is single. To the Provost and Fellows of Eton College I am indebted, not only for frequent opportunities of collating their manuscript with my own, but for the most liberal hospitality and the most polite attention. Tlwough their indulgence I have been enabled to supply some deficien cies, and correct several errors, which must otherwise have dis figured this translation : whatever imperfections still remain, would probably have been removed by the collation of a third copy with the two which I have used. A third copy, however, I sought in vain; although, from information, communicated by an ingenious friend, I have reason to believe that E bn H aukal's work is among the manuscripts belonging to a certain learned Society: but I must regret that it is not found in any other library of this metropolis to which I have been admitted. Such as it is, I am not without hopes that this work will prove acceptable to the Orientalist, the Antiquary, and the Geographer. If their approbation be withheld, I shall acknowledge that I have toiled in vain ; for the result of my former labours has taught me to expect no other recoinpense than praise, and the hopes of substantial profit have been ex tinguished by successive disappointments.^ Felloe oj Wportunitiu fort he most l ' Through ' me deficien. * se havedis* till remain, )n 0 f a third } y&gt; however, wmunicated ! e that E bn wging to a is not found I have heen 3S that this f Antiquary, held, 1 shall esult of my recompense we hen ex- CONTENTS.

In the name of God, the Clement, the Merciful! , • . . • ' • &gt; j Praise be to God, the origin of all good ! and may the blessing of God be on Mohammed, the Prince of Prophets! Thus says the author of the work : ' My design, in the composition of this book, is to describe the various climates and regions of the face of the earth, comprised within the circle of Islam, or Mohammedanism, and their several divisions, in such a manner that every remarkable place belonging to each region shall be noticed, and all the boun daries and territories depending on them, their districts, cities, mountains, rivers, lakes, and deserts.' B( 2 ) But as the particular details of all these seemed unnecessarily prolix, they are here compressed within a small compass; and in the present volume, which is entitled Mesalek u Memalek, our plan is to describe, and to delineate on maps, the various seas or oceans which surround the land, the inhabited and the desert islands, and every climate and region of the earth; affixing the name of each, so that it may be known in the maps; and confining ourselves to those countries which are the seat of Islam, and the residence of true believers. We begin with Arabia, because the Temple of the Lord is situated there, and the holy Kaaha* is the Navel of the World; and Mecca is styled, in the sacred writings, ' the Parent City,' or ' the Mother of Toirns\. Then we proceed to describe the Deryai-Pars, or Persian Sea, which bounds a portion of Arabia: then we speak of the western countries, 4-yLo Zemeen-i-Magreh (part of Africa); then we describe the land ot Egypt, Misr; then Syria, ^ Sham ; then the rJiJ Deryai Roam, or Mediterranean Ocean; then the province of Jezireh, Mesopotamia; then Irak Arabi; then Khuzistan, Susiana; then Pars, or Farsistan; then Kir man; then qjjhzX * Mansoureh, the places bordering on ^ j Sind and Hind, the confines of The square Temple at Mecca; built, according to Mohammedan tradition, by Abraham. t Omm al kura. ji !( 3 ) Hindoostan, and such towns of these as contain Mussulman in habitants: then we describe ^ UC j I j Azerhaigan, and its territories; then ^\Sj^&gt;jf^Kouhestan; then Deibnan; then the Deryai Khozr, or Caspian Sea, and the various nations surrounding it; then the deserts between Khorasan and Fars-, then the province of Seiestan; then Khorasan and yJljjU Maweralnahr, or Transoxania. (Here, in the original manuscript, a Hank page occurs, on which was to have heen delineated a general Map of the World, or the Eastern Hemisphere.J The author of this work informs us, that such is the form of the earth, its various parts, inhabited and uninhabited. We have divided it into empires or states, L-CJ memalek : and the signi fication of this word is kingdoms ; in the singular, ojCL^ memleket, ^one kingdom or state. Of all the regions of this earth, none is more populous, cultivated, or flourishing, than the empire of (^ L j ! Iran, or Persia; the chief glory of which, in former times, was (Job Bah el (Babylon.) This is the country of Pars : and the extent of this empire, in the time of the ancient Persians, is well known; but the Mussulmans have since( 4 ) possessed themselves of the countries above enumerated; such as Rourriy Natolia; and Sham, Syria; and Misr, Egypt; and ^j&gt;JcXj( Andalus, Andalusia or Spain; and Magreh, the west (part of Africa), and part of Hindoos tan; and the territories of 0^*2^ Mansoureh, as far as Multan ; and Kahulistan; and the borders of ^ 11'^ Tolc- harestan; and of C/ieen, China orTartary; and ^ i^Lo orTransoxania. The author says, that he reckons, as belonging to Roum, the borders of &lt;^-00^ Siklab, Scla- vonia; of (j^jj Rous, Russia, Serir, and ^1 Allan, and Armen, Armenia, where the Christian religion is professed ; and he places, as belonging to Hindoostan, Sind, and ^v ^LJ^ Cashmere, and part of Tibet. ' As for the land of blacks, in the west (Africa), and the Zingians, ^Ethiopians, and such tribes (says the author), I make but slight mention of them in this book ; because, naturally loving wisdom, ingenuity, religion, justice, and regular government, how could I notice such people as those, or exalt them by inserting an account of their countries ? Yet one race of them has some degree of civilization and religious observance, the Nubians, and ^1x^x2^ tiabbeshians, Abbyssinians: the reason of this is, their vicinity to the other more polished countries; thus aj y Nubia and Habbesheh, Abyssinia, are situated on the borders of the Deryai Kolzurn, the Sea of Kolzum, or Red Sea. Nothing farther can be said in their favour.'( 5 ) The region of Islam is superior to the others, because it is more extensive; from south to north, and from the western bay or gulph, connected with the ocean, to the borders of Cheen Macheen (the southern parts of China), and another bay or gulph, likewise joining the ocean, from the west (Africa), to Andalus, Spain. The author informs us that he has drawn a line through this map, dividing it into two parts, and passing from the Persian Sea to the land of Hindoostan, through the midst of the region of Islam ; likewise from the land of Egypt to the west of Africa. The inhabitants of the northern parts of these countries are of a fair complexion ; those who dwell still farther north are more fair skinned, and their climate is cold. The inhabitants of the south are of a dark complexion, and the blackness of their skins increases as they dwell farther to the south. On the east of the land of Islam are the regions of Hindoo- stan and the Persian Sea; to the west lie ' . 1 Roum, and (^^il Armen, and ^J'I and and Khozr, and Rous, and^LiAj Bulgar, and Siklab, and part of Turkestan. The land of Islam has to the north the empire of Cheen, and its various territories from the borders of r I\irkestan ; and to the south the Persian Sea, and the region of O sawj Sind. The Ocean bounds it to the west and to the south.Description of the Seas. T he chief Seas are the (S^.Persian, and c^b j&amp; the Sea of lloum, or the Mediterranean, which are nearly op posite : both join the great ocean. The Persian Sea is more ex tensive in length and breadth, reaching to the land of Cheen, and to the Sea of Kolzum. From Kolzum to Cheen, in a streight line, is a distance of about two hundred men- zil* ; and from Rolzum to Irak, by the way of the desert, is a journey of two months. From the Jihoun, or Oxus, to the extreme boundary of Islam, on the borders of Ferghanah, is aho\e twenty merhileh*; and, from those places to the coast of Cheen, is a very tedious way, because in these seas are various windings and turnings. * See the Preface.( 7 ) j fjj Of the Sea ofRoum, or the Mediterranean, and other matters. T his sea comes from the ocean, and extends from that narrow bay, or pass, between the west (Africa), and the land of ^JcXil Andalus, Spain, to the coast of Sham, Syria, a distance of seven months journey. This sea is of a more regular and even outline than the Persian-, for, after you pass the mouth of that bay before mentioned (Gibraltar), it is protracted in one line to the end. From Egypt to the extremity of the west Magreh, is a distance of an hundred and eighty merhileh. From the ex tremity of the east to that of the west, is near four hundred merhileh. From Roum, one comes to Sham (Syria) in the course of sixty merhileh. From Sham to ^2^0 Egypt is thirty merhileh. The distance of the journey between the land of Yajouge and j Lib Bulgar, and the country of Siklah, is about four hundred merhileh; and from Siklah to Roum, to the borders of Sham, sixty merhileh. From Roum to the extreme boundary of the ^ an&lt; ^ Nubians, about eighty merhileh.( 8 ) Between j ^Jouge and Majouge, and the northern ocean, and between the deserts of the Blacks and the other limits of the ocean, all is desolate and waste, without any buildings. 1 know not what are the roads or stages of those two deserts which are on the coasts of the ocean, because it is impos sible to travel in them on account of the excessive heat, w hich hinders the building of houses, or the residing there. Thus, also, in the south, no animal can exist, so excessive is the heat, nor any person dwell there. But between Cheen and the west V;- 3 ^ Magreh, all is inhabited, and the ground cultivated, and the ocean surrounds the land like a collar or necklace. From this ocean proceed the Deryai. Fars, Per sian Sea or Gulph, and Deryai Roum, Mediterranean, but not the^L Deryai Khozr, or Caspian Sea. If any person wish to make a circuit round this sea, he must set out from Khozr, and proceed through the land of Deilman, and Taharistan, and ^ Giirkan, and, turning by the desert, in the vicinity of olx^ Siah Kouh, or the Black Moun tain, thus come back to the place from which he had set out, as nothing would impede him but the river which falls into the Caspian Sea. The Franks, in general, we speak of as belonging to Roum (Europe), because they have the same religion and king, though speaking various dialects.

And when one comes from the mouth of the bay or gulph to the land of Mussul mans, the borders of I jj U Mauweralnahr, Transoxania, it is a journey of three months. And when one comes from the east, and wishes to proceed to the west, by the land of the Nubians, and the land of Khurkhiz, and of Ghurghez, and by Kairnak to the sea, it is a journey of about four months. In the regions of Cheen there are various dialects: but all Turkestan, and Ghurghez, and Assah, and Khurkhiz, and Kaimak, and Ghurneh, and Khurnjiah ; the people of all these have the same language, and are of one kind. The chief place of the empire of Cheen is called Humdan, as Costantineh, Constantinople, is of Europe, or Bagdad, of the land of Islam, or Canouge, of Hindoostan; but the land of Turk, is separately situated, jt Ghuz is the boundary of it from Khozr to Kaimak, and to «XAqsry^ Khurnjiah and _^Lxij Bulgar, and the borders ot the land of Mussulmans from Gurkan to Barah, and to Senjab. longing to eligion and H When you pass from the territories of Kaimak, then it is the land of Khederje, lying to the north, between yz Ghuz and Khurkhiz, and behind Siklah ; and the land of Yajouge is situated in the north, when you turn from( 10 ) Siklah, and pass the bounds of Kaimak; but the extent of Yajouge, and the number of its inhabitants, are known to God Almighty alone. There is a place of Khurkhiz, situated between Ghuz, and Kaimak, and the ocean, and the land of Khederje. The country of Tibet is situated between Khurkhiz and the empire of Cheen, Cheen lies between the sea and the land of Ghuz and Tibet; and Cheen itself constitutes this climate (or division) ; but the other parts of Tibet were annexed to it, as in Europe the lesser places depend on Constantinople, and in the region of Islam on Iran, which is the land of BaheL Of Siklah, the extent is about two months journey; jLxij Bulgar is a small town, which has not many territories, and for that reason the places belonging to it have been well known. The Rous are a people between whom and Bulgar is a tribe of Turks ; in one place here some fishermen reside, and there are a few date trees, as far as Saran, and v— j X o *. Cheilak, and opposite the mountains to a I j I Ableh, Ahleh is a small town, well inhabited, with a little tilled and cultivated land. ' In that place were some Jews; those to ' whom it was forbidden to hunt on the Sabbath (or Sunday): ' and God transformed them, and caused them to become ' monkies*.( »» ) As for (^jlcX^c Madaein, and its territories, as far as Ye men (Arabia Felix), and to Oman, and Bahrein, (islands in the Persian Gulph), as far as Abadan; of all these we describe the roads as belonging to Arabia: but Ahadan is a small fort or castle, inhabited, on the sea-coast, and the waters of the Dejleh (or Tigris) come up there. This is a rehat, or station, where sentinels used to be placed, that the/ might watch the robbers of the sea, or pirates. The riyer Dejleh, or Tigris, passes here; and thence we come by the sea-shore to Mahi-rouian, on the borders of Pars, or Persia. On this journey it is necessary in most of the places to go by water; because the river of Khu- zistan winds about ^ Daurak, and flows to ^^22^ Hysn Mohdi, and Ramnan, and then falls into the sea at Mahi-rouian ; and this Mahi-rouian is a small town, well-inhabited, and pleasant, the port for Arghan, or the pass to it. Then we come to Sinir, which is larger than Mahi-rouian ; and this Sinir is the port of all Pars or Farsistan. From thence the sea-shore winds on to Bijerm. Between Jenabeh and Bijerm, there are groves, and meadows, and villages ; and the air becomes very warm here. From this you proceed to Siraf, one of the most ample harbours in all Pars. Siraf is a large town J' one 0 f tJie eyes of the towns of Fars. Here there is not any husbandry or cultivation of ground ; and they bring water from a distance.( 12 ) Passing from this along the shore, by places where there are hills and deserts, you come to the Hysn cbn omarreh. This is a very strong castle: in all Pars there is not any fort more strong, or in better condition; and it is thought that there is an allusion to the lords ot this castle in that passage of the Koran, where it is said r ' And there was, behind them, a king who forcibly seized on t( every (sound) ship*. From this place you proceed to Hormuz, which is the port of Kirman. Hormuz is a well-inhabited and flou rishing city: it abounds in dates, and the air is exceedingly warm. From this you go to Daibul, where there are merchants, who trade in all places. This is the port of the land of Sijid : and Sind is the same as 0,1^2^ Mansureh; and the region of ^UloJ Lattian, as far as Cheen, extends along the coast of Hindoostan, to cxO' Tibet, and Cheen Macheen, beyond which no one passes. * Koran, Cjjy** Chapter of the Cavern. This king, according to some Mo hammedan commentators, reigned in Oman. See S ale's Koran, Chap, xviii.— Po- cocke's Specim. Histor, Arab. p. 42. &amp;c.( 13 ) OfBajeh, and Abyssinia, and Nubia. F rom Kolzum, on the west of the sea (the Red Sea), the dry deserts stretch very far, to the land of Bajeh. The in habitants of Bajeh are blacker than the Abbyssinians, like the Arabs*; and they have not either cities, villages, nor cultivated land— nothing but what they bring from Yemen, Ahbyssinia, Egypt, or the land of the Greeks This country (BajehJ is situated between Habesh, Abbyssinia, the land of Nubia, and Egypt. In it are gold mines, which extend from near the borders of Egypt to a certain castle on the sea-coast, which they call ^zjij^zAssatf ; a distance of about ten merhileh. Among these mines is a place called Miami, situated on a level ground. There are not in any quarter of the world such gold mines as these. In Bajeh they worship idols, or any thing that seems pleasing to their eyes. Those who immediately border on the land of Abbyssinia are Christians, and of the same complexion as Arabians. * Probably it should have been ' Blacker than the Arabs, and like the Abbys sinians.' t This word is so equivocally written in the MSS. that it may be As sab, &amp;c.( 14 ) On the sea-coast there is a place called Zeilaa, which is the port for those who go to Yemen and Hejaz. Then begin the deserts of aj y Nubia, The Nubians are Chris tians ; and their country is wider than that of the Abyssinians ; and ' the ^Egyptian Nile passes through their territories, and goes on ' to the land of the Zingians (^Ethiopia) ; and one cannot proceed ' beyond that*.' The sea continues to the land of^jlxJoJ Zingbar, ^Ethiopia, opposite Aden : thence it departs from the regions of Islam. ^Ethiopia is a dry country, with few buildings, and very little cultivated ground. The leopard skins, and other spotted skins which are brought into Yemen, come from this place. The in habitants are at war with the Mussulmans. There is in Zingbar a race of white people, who bring from other places articles of food and clothing. This country produces little: the inhabitants are not much inclined to the cultivation of arts or sciences. So far we have spoken of those countries bordering on the Persian Sea: Now we proceed to describe the regions of the West. 1 he last sentence (which seems obscure) is literally, ' and after that it is impossible to go on.'( 15 ) Of Magreh (the West J, or part of Africa. T his western region is situated along the ^ Medi terranean Sea, and is divided into two parts—one, the eastern —the other, western. To the eastern division belong $3y Bar- kah, and Afrinkeieh, and Tahouth, and Melinjeh, and Sus, and Zouilah; and all on the sea. The western division extends to ^JcXil Andalus. The sea, to the east, reaches as far as Egypt. From Egypt we proceed to Mohediah, and Jezireh Beni Rehehi (or RaaiJ, and Basireh, and &lt;x X jj1 Arbleh, and Sus, where are deserts without any sort of habitations.. To the south of these places is sand. (Map of the West.J( 16 ) Alhakem hen Hesham len Ahdarrahman hen Moawiyah hen Hesham hen Ahdalmulk hen Merivan hen Alhakm*.

Magreh (the west) or Africa, is chiefly remarkable for the black slaves: it is the land of blacks.

Tahouth is the chief: it is a large town, well inhabited and supplied. The inhabitants practise agriculture they have been conquered by a people called Basna*. Sejelmasah is a town of middling size, belonging to the territories of Fahouth. One cannot enter Sejelmasah but by the way of the desert, which the sand renders difficult. This town is situated near the gold mines, between them and the land of the Blacks, and the land of Zouilah. These mines are said to be of the most pure and excellent gold; but it is difficult to. work them, and the way to them is dangerous and troublesome. They say that the district of Tahouth is reckoned as belonging to. Africa.. * The Fatemite Dynasty commenced in the year of the Hegira 296, (A. D. 908,) and lasted 1 7 2 years.— D'H erbelot, Art.

O lj)vo Kirouan is the largest of all the towns. The tribes of Magreb all resided there; and it was their chief place until the decline of their government, when Abu-Abdallah came forth, and conquered them ; since which time Abdallah dwelt at Kir- ouan, until he built the town of Mohedicih on the sea- coast, and removed to that place. Zouileh is a town of middling size, with many territories belonging to it: it is situated near the country of the Blacks. This land of the Blacks is a very extensive region, but extremely dry. In the mountains of it are to be found all the fruits which the Mohammedan world produces ; but they do not eat of them ; they have other fruits and natural productions for their food. Their skins are of a finer and deeper blackness than that of any other blacks, whither Habeshis, Abyssinians, or Zingians, Ethiopians. And their country is more extensive than that of any other nation of Blacks: it is situated on the coast of the ocean to the south : to the north they have deserts which extend towards the deserts of Egypt; from behind JFahh the desert( 23 ) reaches to near the Nubians ; then to the desert in the vicinity of Zinghar. Whatsoever they get, comes to them from the western side, because of the difficulty of entering their country from any other quarter. Now we proceed to speak of the West, and begin with an account of Andalus, or Spain. Andalus is an extensive and considerable country, with many large and flourishing cities, the chief of which is called AxLyJ Cortubah (Cordova), situated in the midst of the country. The ocean is on one side of Andalus, and the Sea of Roum (the Mediterranean) on the other, as far as the L-Cy Land of the Franks (France.) The first of the cities is Serin; then Husiniah, Asebiliah (or Sebilah, Seville), ajjc X xm Sedounah, Sido- nia, a JUL o Malaca, to the country of Molds ah, and to Tolsah, andA^j-J^L Tartousah ; where there is Baris, a town on the sea-side. Thence along the sea, belongs to the land of the Franks; and on the dry side belongs to the country of Aljekes. This country is inhabited by a race of Christians, and as far as the land of Biscounes belongs to the Christians, as likewise the territories of (^UUL^ Jalehan. There are two boundaries to Andalus ; one, the land of the Infi dels (or Christians); the other, the sea: and all those towns which we have spoken of, as being situated on the sea-coast, are considerable places, and well-inhabited.( 24 ) Andalus is now in the bands of the &lt;Wc! the Ommiades*; and the Ahhassians, the Abbassides, have not yet snatched it from them ; nor has Abdullah yet obtained the superiority over them. At the time that the glory of the Beni Ommiah was declining, one of that family, who was at a I j T Abilah, passed over to the oyJezireh Jlbel-ta- rek, Gibraltar, and subdued Andalus, which still remains in the possession of the Ommiah race. These are the most remarkable cities of Andalus Toleitlah, Sedounah, oC^jU Lurdah, JFadi al hejareh, Barklialah, Bournuh Hesan, oOjU Mardah, Maliou, Oiilc Ghafek, a J o J Leilah, Fermouiuh (or Kannouiah), Alourouduh, f Aselnliah. These are all considerable towns, and for the greater part their buildings are of stone. Behaneh is situated in the vicinity of deserts. Siring on the coast of the ocean : there ambergris is found, but not in 0 any place on the Mediterranean Sea. The author of this book says, ' At the time when I was in Syria, on the coast of the The Ommiades retained their empire in Spain long after they had ceased to govern the other regions of Islam; where the Abbassides began to reign A.

The kings of Andalus are very fond of this stuff, and will not allow it to be exported; and they have garments of it which cost above a thousand dinars. a JCJL c Malaca produces the sanfar\, of whose skin they make the handles of swords. v—VjiL Jezireh Tar eh, Aljezireh, was the first seat of Islam in this country. The Jehel-Tarek, Gibraltar, is a well-inhabited mountain, with villages or small towns on it : it is the extreme point and last pass of Andalus, Toletilah is a city situated on a lofty mountain: the buildings are of marble, or hard stones, fastened with lead.

I Fahas-alilout is a flourishing and considerable district, the capital of which is called v—Kile. Gha fek. Bourmah was a large city, but has been ruined during a contest between two tribes or parties who were in the town, one of which called to their aid the JalekianSy who came and plundered and destroyed the place. In AndaJus the Bejii Ommiah, or family of the Ommiah sove reigns, are pre-eminent. The Khuthah* is read in their name. The cities of the Jalehians are, ocSjLc Mardah, oHer ah, JVadi al hcjar, Toletlah. There is a country of the Jalekians bordering on Andahis, which they call Astourah ; and the king of the Jalekians resides in a city called J oa j I Abnez, which is far from the land of the Mussulmans. But of all the tribes ot Infidels (Christians) who border on An- # A prayer for the reigning king, read every Friday in the principal mosques.^ ( n 1 ^ le town call e( | dalus, the most numerous are the l J o ^ Franks.

In the eastern parts they are darker, and have light-coloured eyes—some more remote, have fair com&gt; lexions, with blue eyes, and reddish hair: one race of them has black eyes, and black hair—these are said to be descended from the Arabs of the tribe of Ghusaz. Between Magreb and the country of the Blacks, there are deserts, of which but a few places are accessible by any road. Between I Afrikiah and Tahoath, there is a small tribe,, called oly^ Sherah. The kings of Andalus are of the Beni Ommiah family, and the Abbassides have not yet had the Khuthah* in their name. These kings of Andalus are descended from leXxc Hesharn hen Ahdahnolk, and still have the Khutbah in their own name. Their kings, at this time, are Abdarrahman Mo hammed hen Ahdallah hen Mohammed Ahdarrahmanf. # See Note, p. 26. t iS+zz-* ^ a UI s X xc A xc The original has kings, in the plural. But it appears that our author alludes to Ahdarrahmany the third of that name, who (according to D'Herbelot, art. Akdalrahman) reigned 60 years in Spain, and died in the year of the Hegira 350, (A. D. 961), after violent com- tests about ths right of succefllon between the Ommiades and Abbassides.( 29 ) Account of Egypt. O ne of the boundaries of Egypt begins from the ^^ Sea of Roum, between aj jc XL^J Iskanderiah (Alexandria) and Barkah, at the deserts behind ^.1 j IFahh; proceeding to the land of the Nubians, and to the land of Azp-t Bajeh, and back from Asouan to the Sea of Roum; and from Bajeh, to the ^jX3 Sea of Kolzum (the Red Sea), till it comes to the jjL Tour Sina (Mount Sinai), in the territories of the Children of Israel. From the coast of the Sea of Roum to the land of the Nubians behind j Wahh, is twenty-five merhileh. From the borders of Nubia you must go eight merhileh to the south; from Kolzum, on the coast of the Red Sea, to the JolyJ a &gt;J Tiah beni Israel, or Desert of the Israelites, six merhileh; and from the sea to the borders of that Desert, or Tiah, where it is bounded by the Sea of Roum, eight merhileh; from 1 Asouan to the Sea of Roum, twenty-five merhileh. Now we present a map of this country-( 30 ) The chief city of Egypt is called J^liosKO Tosteite situated on the bank of the River Nile to the north. The Nile flows from the east; and all this city is situated on one side of it. Near to it are certain edifices, called Jezireh, or the Island, to which they pass from Fostat on a bridge ; and from this Jezireh they have constructed a bridge to the other bank, where there is a place called Jeirah. The extent of the city is about two thirds of a farsang: it is very w^ell inhabited, and supplied with provisions; all their houses are seven or eight stories high. Near the tow^n is a place called ^ Mouekaf, the soil of which is less marshy, and more firm and solid. It is said that Fostat was the name of a certain tribe. Hamra is a town situated on the bank of the river Nile. It has two principal mosques; one in the middle of the town, built by Amru hen Aas ; and the other in the place called ^— *3^ Mouekaf, erected by ^Laaher hen Touloun. Without the town is a certain place of above a mile in extent, which that Laaher Touloun caused to be built for his troops: this they call XjlLii Fetaia or Ketaia. In like man ner were the dwellings, called Afadeh, of the ^jT Al-i-Agleh (or family of Agleb), situated without the town of^j !j^o Kirouan. In this place agriculture is much practised. * Fostat is now, according to Mr. Browne (Travels, p. 8o), ' A long street, running parallel to the river, and occupying part of the space between Kahira (Cairo) and its bank.' Of modern Cairo the foundation was laid A. D. 968.( 31 ) There are great quantities of dates, and many corn fields, along the banks of the Nile, from that to near Asouan, and to the borders of Eskanderiah. When the weather be comes very warm, the water increases; and when it sinks, they sow their grain; after that, there is no necessity for water. In the land of Egypt there falls not either rain nor snow; nor is there in the whole country any running stream beside the river Nile. / Fioum is not a very considerable town. It is said that the prophet Joseph, on whom be the blessing of God ! brought the water to that place, and called it Lahout: And there is not any person who knows the fountains or source of the river Nile; on this account, because it issues from a cavern in the ter ritories of Zing bar, from a certain spot, which a man may very nearly approach, yet never can arrive at: after this, it runs through the inhabited and desert parts of the land of the Nubians to ^2^ Misr (Egypt); and there where it first becomes a river, it is equal to the j Deljeh and Frat (Tigris and Euphrates.) And the water of the River Nile is the most pure and delicious of all the waters on the face of the earth. The Nile produces Odyj crocodiles, and the fish_^A-*JJi^ sekenkour: and there is also a species of fish, called ocXclj raa- dah, which if any person take in his hand while it is alive, thatperson will be affected by a trembling of his body* ; when dead, this fish resembles other fishes. Tlie crocodile s liCtid is very long, so long as to be one halt of his whole form, and he has such teeth, that, if a lion were to come within their hold, he would be destroyed. It sometimes happens that the crocodile comes out of the water on the dry ground; but he has not then the same powers as when in the water. His skin is so hard that it resists the blows of all weapons when stricken on the back: they therefore wound him where the fore legs join the body (literally, under the arm pitsJ, and between the thighs. The sekenJcour is a species of that fish (the crocodile), but the crocodile has hands and feet ; and they use the sekenkour in medicinal and culinary preparations. This creature is not found any where but in the river Nile. From Asouan, along the banks of the Nile, as far lis the sea, the country is all inhabited and cultivated. On the southern side of the Nile there is a place called Saied, where are mines of zeherjed*, and emeralds (OycJ zem- rud) far in the desert; and beside these there are not any mines of those precious stones. On the northern side of the river Nile, * The original is very obscure: it may signify that the fish's body is affected by an extraordinary tremulous motion while life remains, t Chrysolite, kind of emerald, topaze, beryl, &amp;c.J,: ^end^ lnd he ^ 1,4 jld ' he walj., We comes out J samepoTas resists the Hois therefore woimi i under the Qrm sehnkour is a 'odile has handk nal and culinan vhere kit in tk Nile, as far k rated.

At the distance of two far- sang from Fostat, there are some ancient structures, called Ahouam; of which two are very lofty piles, and called How nan : these are each, in height, four hundred g'wsf : And on the walls thereof are inscriptions written in the Greek language ; and this writing is said to signify, ' the building of ' Houman and Sertaier (was) in the sign Cancer J.'

D. 819.) t See the Preface. r( 34 ) edifices are quadrangular, and gradually diminish towards the summits, which are about large enough tor a camel to stand on; within them there are passages in which a man cannot go without some difficulty. And in Houman is a cleft, or excavation, under the ground, supposed to have been, with some appearance of pro bability, the burial-place of the ancient sovereigns of this country. The land of JVahat was a pleasant and cultivated district, with trees, and water, and many inhabitants; but none at present remain. It abounded also in fruits. From the Egyptian Saied Saied Misr, to the land of Wahh, in the south, is a journey of three days; and from that a small desert extends towards the land of the Blacks. The sea which borders Egypt is bitter; but where the river Nile pours into it, and overcomes it, the waters of the sea are ♦ rendered sweet. Farther out, when the waters of the Kile are contounded with the sea, the bitterness again predominates. In this sea there are islands, to which one may pass over in boats or vessels. Of these islands are Tchgis (^or and Daniiat. In each of these agriculture is practised, and cattle are kept; and the kind of clothes called rejia, (or rekia), comes from these places.

From the borders of this sea, to those of the sea of Syria, it is all sand. The town of Ashmouein is small, but well-inhabited, and improved by agriculture; it produces dates: and opposite Ashmouein, on the north of the river Nile, there is a little town called Bouseir, where Merwan hen Mohammed was slain. It is said that the magicians of Pharaoh were from this yKuiJ Beseir, (or Bouseir, as before written.) ^I^&gt;J Asouan is a place which produces dates. Agriculture there much practised.

Tcneis is a vast j^ile or heap erected over the bodies of the dead, which were placed one above another until they formed a pile; which pile was called y Terhourn : and this must have been done before the time of Moses, on whom be the peace and bless ing of God '.—for, in the time of Moses, according to the religion of the Egyptians, the dead were interred—a custom which was continued afterwards by the Christians, and is still practised by the Mussulmans. The author of this book says, that he himself had seen some of those bodies in their shrouds, or winding-sheets, with bones and skeletons of immense size. There are some plaees on the river Nile whieh the crocodiles do not infest, near Fostat and Bouseir; and the Aien~ al-shems, or Fountain of the Sun, lies to the south of Fostat. These two places are said to have been villas or pleasure-houses of Pharaoh. On the top of Mount Moazem there is a place which they call the stove or furnace of Pharaoh. In the vicinity of Fostat, there grows a plant, called halsam, from which the oil is extracted. This is not to be found in any other part of the world. The left side of the Nile is called Khouf. In this divi-( *7 ) . sion are situated a » j L o Kicisah, and Jerjeir, and Kakour. The opposite division, on the right side of the river Nile, they call wOJ Zeif. These two places contain the chief villages of Egypt. The gold mines are in the land of Bajeh. From Asouan to that place is a journey of fifteen farsang. The country where those mines are situated is sandy, and without any hills, fields, or tilled land: it furnishes slaves lor Egypt. There are asses and mules, of considerable value, in Egypt: no other country, produces sucn.

T he western side of Syria is bounded by Roum*; the eastern, by the desert from a I j I Aileh to the I oral (river Euphrates), and from the Euphrates to the borders of Roum. To * Perhaps the word bji [Sea) has been here omitted ; The Sea of Roum, or Me diterranean,( 38 ) the north of Syria lies the land of Roum; and to the south are the borders of Egypt, and the Tiuh heni Israel, or Desert of the Children of Israel. s (Map of Syria.J Of the cities and towns which are situated on the east and west of Syria, it is unnecessary here to make any mention, as we have already pointed them out in the map. Some places are called j Seghur Sham, or frontiers of Syria: others are called Seghur Jezireh, or frontiers of Arabian Irak, or Mesopotamia, because all bordering on one half of the Euphrates belongs to Syria; and from &lt;xxixLo Meltiah to ^leraash is called the Seghur of Jezireh, because people of Jezireh reside there, and it belongs to Syria. The hills of ^ Lekam extend for two hundred farsang into Roum; and the jl&lt;^ Dar aVsalam (the mansion of salvation or peace) is between Meraash and Haroimiah; and the ajj I Aein Arhah, or Fountain of Arbah. After having passed AxicXj Ladikiah, it is called Mount Lekam. From that, the continuation of this mountain is called Soukh, as far as Memehes ; and from that, throughout all Syria,( S9 ) it is called Lib nan (Lebanon), till it comes near the Sea of Kolzum (Red Sea.) The borders of Palestine are two days journey to the west, from the place called llemaa to (he borders of Behour ; and the breadth of the borders of Palestine, on the western side, is also, from that place to UUb Jlilka, two days journey; and the land of the tribe of Lot, (Sodom, &amp;c.) and Baherah, and Taberah, all that is situated between the two mountains, they call j&gt;j.t Ghour. It is lower down than the land of Syria; and part of it is reckoned as belonging to Arden, and part to Palestine. The water of Palestine is rain water. Palestine is about one half of Syria; and the chief cities of it are Ramleh, and the cXy Beit-almokeds, Holy House, or Jerusalem, which is situated on a hill. Here is a mosque (Ocs:'^), or temple, than which there is not, in all the land of the Mussulmans, one more large. Here also is the Mehrah, the chief altar of David, on whom be peace!—a building of about fifty guz high, and thirty broad, of stone. On the top of this is the Mehrab of David; and this is the first object that presents itself as one comes from Ramleh. i At a distance of six miles from Jerusalem is a village called Beit Allehem (Bethlehem orBethlem.) Here ' Jesus, on whom be peace! was born of his mother; and it is said that the date or palm tree, of whose fruit Mary ate.( 40 ) and which is celebrated by mention in the Koran*, has Jbeen placed in the dome or vault which is here, and held in high ve neration and respect. From Bethlehem, on the southern side, there is a small town, called the Alesjed Ihrdhiiriy or Temple ot Abra ham : and in the mosque where they pray on the high leasts, are the burial places of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, ^(may peace be on them!) and those of their wives are opposite. Here are many hills and trees: all the hills of Palestine are covered with trees; and there is much fruit, olives, and figs. (j&gt;JuU Naholis is a town of which the inhabitants are called Samarian; a people who have not any other residence. In the extreme borders of Palestine, in the vicinity of Egypt, there is a city, called ojt GhazaJi, which HasJiem conquered, and in which Shafai f was born. Jehal, and ol \jZi Sherah, are two well inhabited and pleasant districts.

Arden, the chief town of which is Tiherthah, or Tiberiah, on the banks of the Small or lake, whose waters are sweet, and its length twelve miles, and its breadth two or three farsang.—Here is a running stream of water, very warm, which goes on for about two farsang, and, when it reaches the town, is exceedingly hot. In the district of jjt Ghour, snow is almost unknown; but dates, and streams, and fountains, abound. It commences at the borders of Arden; and when it passes them, it extends to the boundary ot Palestine, and in like manner reaches to aJbl Aileh. • „ # Jya Sour (Tyre) is a very strong town, situated on the sea shore. It is the most aneient of all the cities on the coast; and all the Grecian philosophers came from this place. (jOjl Ardeti was the dwelling-place of Jacob, to whom be peace! Demeshk (Damascus) is a chief city, the right hand of the cities of Syria* It has ample territories among the G( 43 ) mountains; and is well watered by streams whieh flow around. The land about it produees trees, and is well cultivated by husband men. This tract is called ^ Gh It extends about one merhileh by two. There is not, in all Syria, a more delightful place. There is a bridge in the midst of the city of Demeshk, by which a horseman may pass over the w ater, which goes on to the villages of Ghouteh, and runs amongst their inns, and hot-baths, and shops. Here is one of the largest mosques in all the land ot the Mus sulmans, part of which was built in ancient times by the Sabians. Then it fell into the possession of the Greeks, and became a place of religious worship to them. After that, it fell into the hands of the Jews, and of certain princes who adored idols; and at that time they put to death Yahiah, the son of Za- chariah, to whom be peace! and fixed his head upon a pole, before 'the gate of this temple, at the place which they call v'-r 1 Bah Jeroud (probably Jews'-gate.) It then passed into the hands of the Christians, who performed in it, likewise, their religious ceremonies, until, at length, it came into the possession of the True Believers (the Mussulmans), to whom it serves as a mosque. At the same spot where the head of Yalua ben Zachariah had been fixed, the head of Hosein, the son of Ah, to whom be peace! was also exposed. UTM in his time ' caused this buil&lt;im e t0 be repaired, and beautified with pavements of marble, and also pil-( 43 ) lars of variegated marble, the tops of which were ornamented with gold, and studded with precious stones, and all the ceiling he caused to be covered with goldj and it is said that he ex pended the revenues of all Syria on this work. Beyond the borders of Demeshk is OCIX aj Baalbek, situated on an eminence. Here are the gates of palaces, sculptured in marble; and lofty columns, also of marble. In the whole region of Syria, there is not a more stupendous or considerable edifice than this. Traholis (Tripolis) is a town on the shore of the Sea of Roum, well-inhabited, and abounding in dates. The chief town of this district is ^&gt;2^ Hemes (Emessa), a place well-supplied with provisions, and of excellent air. The inhabit ants are celebrated as being handsome. Neither scorpions nor serpents are found here. It is copiously wateredthe lands are cultivated, and there are many trees.

Khenaserah is a small town on the borders of the desert. Gherahehn is a district, of which the chief town is Antakiah. After Demeshk, there is not any place more delightful. It has a fortification of stone, and abounds in planta tions of palm and other trees, cultivated fields, water, and mills. Round the territories a horseman may go for two days. The water flows through the streets, and amidst the chief buildings. There is a place which they call the Sekhreh Mousi, or Rock of Moses, to whom be peace ! L» halis is a town on the banks of the river Euphrates.

Eskanderouiah is a fortress situated on the coast of the Sea of Roum : it is small, but has some plantations of date trees, Nethinan is a fortress on the sea-coast: from this place they send into Egypt and Syria the wood of the fir-tree, Keisah is also a castle or fortress on the sea shore. Aien-Zariah is a place which produces dates and other fruits, and much corn. Masisah and Lejllyu Kiifertouma are two towns situated on the banks of the river Jihan. Between these two towns there is a bridge of stone. The situation of these towns is so high, that if a person should look from the top of the mosque, he would see almost as far as the ocean. Adnch is a little town, about half the size of Masisah, on the banks of a small river called Seihan. The town is pleasant, and well-supplied. The river Seihan is less than the river Jihan : over it there is a very lofty bridge of stone. Both the Seihan and Jihan come from Roum. Tarsous is a considerable town, with a double wail of( 40 ) stone. The inhabitants are valiant men, horsemen, and fond of war like achievements. It is a strong and pleasant place. From it to the borders of Roum are many hills and mountains of difficult ascent. They say that in Tarsous there are above a thousand horsemen; and in all the chief cities of Islam, such as Seiestan, and Kirman, and Tars, and Khuzistan, and Irak, and Hejaz, and Egypt, there are inns, or public places, appointed for the people of this town.

Between -6Basireh, and between the land of Tanjeh and Jezireh, there is a certain mountain, which they call (wVjliJI Jehal al Tar eh, situ ated on the point of the borders of Andalus. At that place the breadth of this sea is twelve farsang; and it becomes broader, and more considerable, as it extends to the coast of Magreh, on the eastern side (of Gibraltar), till it approaches the land of Egypt, and from that proceeds towards Syria, along those places which we have above described: it turns, and passes by the cities of Roum, as far as Antakiah; then it joins the sea which forms the bay of Costantiniah, Constantinople; then it proceeds along the coast of Ainas*; then along the coast of Roumiah ; and then to LJljy Frank, France, along the shore to Tarsousah, on the sea of Andalus; and then, continuing along the coast of Andalus, it at last joins the ocean at Jebel al Tarek, opposite Basireh, and proceeds as far as ^ Besirin, which is the extreme point of the land of Islam. * Or Anbas. h 2( 52 ) Kelimah, or Kelmiah, is a town which belonged to the Roumians; and there is a gate at Tarsous, which they call uj I j Bah Kelimah, or the Gate of Kelimah. Kelimah is at a distance from the sea. About a merhileh's distance from that, there is a village on the sea-shore, called Lames ; from that village the country is Roum. Ikjl Antakiah is a very strong fortress, belonging to the Roumians, situated on the sea-shore. It is well-inhabited, and has many villages depending on it. The bay on which it is situated is of bitter or salt water; and they call it the Bay or Gulph of Costaatinah ^ c h a i n is ( or may be) drawn across this gulph, to hinder any one from passing there from the sea or elsewhere;' * and this gulph falls into the Sea of Roum. r\ } r 4 . r . 4 N On the side of Roum there are shores which they call the coasts of Asas and Roumiah These are two well-inhabited and considerable towns, with villages and tilled lands: they belong to the Christians, and are situated near the sea. Asas is the place from which came the ^I j ^ j Grecian Philosophers. Roumiah is one of the props of the king dom of the Christians; they have one throne at Anta kiah, one at Eskanderouiah, and one at Roumiah; and the throne which they have at cxaj Beit al Mokeds/ ^belon^ ate at U-J.jl ' h ' w the Gat, ^ About, 1 fte sea-shore, J is Roum, ;lon ging to the ■inhabited, and ^ it is situated or Gulph of nay be) drawn there from tk ^ of Roum.

From those places the sea proceeds towards the coast of UCly Frank, and, passing by a JUL k . Sikaliah (Sicily), goes on to Tarsousah, belonging to the land of Q&gt;JcXj! Andalus. We have already spoken of the cities, towns, and coasts, of Magreb, and Egypt, and Syria, to the extremity of Islam: it is not necessary to say more on those subjects. In this Sea ot Roum there are islands, great and small. ax JU lkw Sihaliuh is the most considerable of them alL There are, besides, I Akrites, Kihres, and the mount called Jehel al KellaL call the coasts These are two iges and tilled nated near the ps of the king- ^/) atAnta- e at Roumiali; BeitalMohk Sikaliah is near Frank: it is an island of near nine merhileh in extent; and produces more corn and provisions, male slaves and female attendants, and cattle, than any other island belong ing to the Mussulmans, in this sea. Akrites is a smaller island than Sikaliah: it is inhabited by the Mussulmans and JLc Ghazians ; and amongst them there is a tribe of Christians. The inhabitants of Kibres are all Christians. Akrites is a very strong island: at present the inhabitants are on terms of peace with the Mussulmans. They bring ^ ^CL/^c Mastiky from Kibres to the countries of Islam.( 5-1 ) The place called JJJUI Jebel al Kellal has been ruined, but is now inhabited by Mussulmans; and it affords sufficient water and land. It is, in extent, two days journey, situated on the frontiers of Frank; but the Franks have not been able to get possession of it. There are not, any where, shores so delightfully interspersed with buildings on both sides, as the shores of this sea. Here the ships of Mussulmans and of Infidels sail about, and sometimes oppose each other in battle, to the number of an hundred ships on each side. Q f Description of Jezireh, or Mesopotamia. T he tract of country called Jezireh is that which lies between the rivers Dejleh (Tigris) and For at (Euphrates.) The Forat rises in Roum, at a distance of two days journey from Melitiah, and then proceeds to Samisat. On the eastern side of the river Dejleh, and on the western side of the Forat, are various cities and towns, which are reckoned, on ac count ot their vicinity, as belonging to Jezireh, although in fact not so.

Basrah is a considerable city, the foundation of which j ( was laid in the time of l - j LL izs : ^ Omar ehn Alkhitah— (may God reward him!)—and the building performed by ^sjl Athah elm Ghazouan. On the western side of Basrah the desert approaches, which is without water. ' It is ' said, that the rivers or streams of Basrah were reckoned in the ' time of Belal ben Abi Bordeh, and amounted to the number of ' one hundred and twenty thousand streams, on which boats were ' employed. This anecdote astonished me : I went there, and be- ' held, within the space of about an arrow's single flight, several ' small streams, on which little boats were employed*.' * ^ »SJ.j y tXji C*.xSi£ ^ \j*C j J* ^ J ( . J J* XE=3 yKi jOjljoL* tS j ^(04 ) The extent of Basrah comprises about fitty tarsang from Sey, to 0 !oU: Abadan, which is the palm -plantation of Basrah. At Basrah is the tomb of a IM c X xc Tal- hah *hen Abdallah ; may God reward him ! And there are several places, also, to which pilgrimages are made; such as the tomb ot , /.o I Ilcira hen Serir, and other learned men. The river Zohad runs four farsang: it is so thickly interspersed with villas and gardens, that you would imagine the whole place was one garden. Many streams belong to this place, and palm- trees are here in great number. When the water of the sea rises or increases, the waters of those streams go back amongst the gardens, ^and fields, and orchards; and when the water of the sea sinks or diminishes, the river-waters return to their channels, but are all brackish, or of a bitter taste. Ahleh is situated on this river; and there is a dangerous place, called Haw er Ableh, in it, against which vessels from the sea must be well guarded, lest they should be sunk there. Ableh is a small town, but well supplied with provisions, and pleasantly situated, one side being towards the Dejleh. That river (^above mentioned) comes from the Dejleh, in a direct line to Ahadcin. Ihe soil or earth of Basrah is white. The towns of this district are, Ableh, Mentah, and ^ilcX^ Mednr ; all small towns, situ ated on the river Dejleh.

JVaset is situated on the two banks of the Dejleh. It has been built since the introduction of Islam. The foundation was laid by Hejaje Yusuf. It is strongly built; and tJie castle of Hejaje is there, on the western side, with a few fields belonging to it. Waset is a populous town, and well supplied with provisions—of a purer air than Basrah: the vicinity of it is planted with gardens, and well cultivated. Cufa is smaller than Basrah, but resembles it in some respects. The air and water of Cufa are better than those ot Basrah. It is situated near the river Forat. The suburbs of Cufa were built by Sacid hen TF^uhas. cw.j \3 Cadesiah, and Heir ah, and Khawr- nak, are situated on the skirts of the desert, towards the west; the river (Euphrates) running by them on the east: they afford dates, and have some cultivated lands. From Cufa to these places is a distance of one merhileh. Heirah is an ancient city, and large; vbut when Cufa was built, Heirah was drained of its inhabitants. K( &lt;50 ) Heirah enjoys a pure air, and is one farsang distant from Cufa. At Cufa is situated the tomb or meshed of the Commander of the Faithful, ^ en Taleh, on 'w^om be peace ! Some say it is in the cloister at the entrance of the chief mosque; and others say it is at a distance of two farsang. &lt;3uy^lj5 Cadesiah is situated on the border of the desert: it has running water, and cultivated lands. From Cadesiah, on the con fines of Trak, until you come to Medinah Medi- nah Alssalam, the city of Islam), there is not any running 'water. Baghdad is a celebrated city, erected since the intro duction of Islam. It was built by Ahou Jaffer Mansour*. At first the western quarter was built, and everyone settled himself there in any manner he thought fit. Afterwards it became populous; and when C^Oyc Mohdi succeeded to the khalifat f, he encamped his troops on the eastern side. Buildings weie then erected, and that quarter also became thickly inhabited. The villas and palaces extended for near two farsang from Baghdad to the river, and this city became the residence of the khalifs. The buildings were continued from the river to the district of kJj IVaset, and from above the Dejleh to * This Khahf (of the House of Abbas) began to reign A. H. 136, A.

The eastern side they call Ai^ *LlaJI Bah al Tank Resafeh, and also Asker al Mohdi. It is said that the name Bah al Tank is derived from a certain great dome, or cupola, in the principal bazar or market-place, called Souk al Azim. Resafeh is a considerable suburb, built by Rashid, near the Mesjed Jamia: the western side is called Korkh. Here are three mosques; one, the Mesjed Jamia al Mansour; another, situated at the Bab al Tauk; and the other, at the j\C&gt; Bar al Khalifah, or palace of the Khalif: and the buildings continue as far as Kelwazi, where there is a mosque. Over the river Dejleh a bridge has been constructed of boats; and from the gate of Khorasan, to the place called alia Sertheh, the breadth of the city at both sides is about six miles. • i Korkh is very well inhabited, and considerable commerce is there carried on but the trees and streams are on the eastei n side. The water they drink is of the river Nehrwan. On the western side there is a stream, called the JSehr Isa, or the river of Jesus—a branch of the Forat, which, passing by Baghdad, falls into the Dejleh. Between Baghdad and a S jS Cufa there are many districts and k 2( 03 ) villages, through which run streams from the rher Forat. Here is situated the town oi Savsav, on the stieam called Sarsar, at a distance of three farsang from Baghdad. It is a pleasant town, with land well cultivated. Atter that, at a distance of two farsang, is the Nehr al Molk (or the King s liver.) There is a bridge over it; and it is much more considerable than the river of Sarsar. The district of Nehr al Molk is better culti vated, and affords more corn and fruits, than Sarsar. Lrom that one proceeds to ( s ^ j ' Kesr iLbn Hobeiwh, situated on the river Forat, and one of the most considerable places between Cufa and Baghdad. Here are several streams, so that the water is much augmented, and passes on to the town of Sour a. The great river Forat has not any branch more considerable than this. From Soura it proceeds to the sound or villages in the neighbourhood of Cufa; and after that falls into the river of Betaiah. Xjjf'Kerhela is situated on the west of the Forat, opposite to or near (j^) Kesr ehn Hobeireh. Samereh is altogether situated to the east*. In this quarter there is not any running water, but the river Al-katoul, that runs at some distance from the town. Buildings, and streams, and trees, are opposite, on the western side, and( 69 ) extend for near one merliileh. The first founder of this place was Motasem ; and it has since fallen into the hands of Jo Motawakel*, and is all in ruins, so much that within the space of a farsang there is not any building or cultivated land to be seen. The air and fruits of Samareh are better than those of Baghdad. Nehrwan is situated at the distance of four farsang from Baghdad. A considerable stream flows there, and proceeds under the Dar al Khnlifah, in the souad of Baghdad, to the place which they call Askctf beni Haneid, and other districts ; and when one comes from Nehrwan to Deskereh, the waters are less, and the dates fewer : and from Deskereh to the borders of Holwan is a desert, without any buildings or inhabited places between it and Samereh, or between Shehrzour and the borders ot Tacrith. Madaien is a little town, at the distance of one mer- hileh from Baghdad. In former times it was a very considerable city, and a favourite dwelling-place ot kings. The Aiwan Kesri f is situated there, built of stone and mortar. The * Motawakel became Khalif in the year of the Hegira 232, (A. D. 847.)

The whole region is denominated Babel, from this place. The kings of Canaan resided there, and ruins of great edifices still remain. I am of opinion, that, in former times, it was a very considerable place. They say that Babel was founded by O I1^*° Zohak Piuraspf ; and there was Abraham (to whom be peace !) thrown into the fire. There are two heaps, one of which is in a place called Koudi Tereik, the other, Koudi Derbar in this the ashes still remain; and they say that it was the &lt;3 (J^ST fire of Nimrod into which Abraham was cast; may peace be on him ! Madaien is situated on the east of the river Dejleh; and they reckon it one merhileh from Baghdad to that place.

After Cufa, and Basrah, and Waset, and Baghdad, and Samereh, and Hobeireh, there is not any city more considerable in Irak. Snow falls there; and on the mountains in its vicinity there is at all times snow. DesJcereh is a populous and pleasant place, with a strong castle, and corn fields. It is said that a kingf from time to time resided there, on which account it was styled L-XLyJI Deskereh al Molk. From Deskereh to above Samereh, * In the Eton MS. this name is written Lj^^.

I( 72 ) till one comes near Aciyeth in this line, and likewise to the borders of the district of Waset, from the borders of Irak to the borders of Kouh*, the buildings are few, and the greater part is pasture land of the Arabs. Thus, to the west of Tacrith, to Anbar, between the rivers Dejleh and Forat, there are not any buildings, unless those opposite (or near) Samereh ; almost all the rest is the bare and barren desert. It were unnecessary to dwell longer on the account of Irak, as it is a country so famous and so well known amongst men. Description of the Province of Khuzistan. T he eastern boundaries of Khuzistan are the borders of Pars and Spahaunf. Between the borders of Pars and of Spahaun, there is a certain river called L- j II o Nehr Tab, in the vicinity of Mahi-rooyan: from that, the boundary is between Dourek and Mahi-rooyan towards signifies a mountain, in general; but here, perhaps, is the name of a fortress situated on the mountains ofMerdin, mentioned by P etis de la C roix, in his Hist, of Timur, Vol. I. ch. 39. t Ispahan, Sfahan, ox Isfahan—The name is variously written in the course of this work, as in most other MSS.ndlilie »isetot|, ersof ^ the | ist of Tacrii -here ^ not® :ll: almost all, account of ]^ amongst men, dstan. borders of ^ j ( j rders of Pars ani jjj Nehr Td, • from that, tif -roojan toward ; the name ofafe' Croix , in his ®' in the course oftte ( 73 ) the sea-side. On the western side, the boundaries of Khuzistan are the territories of Waset, and that place which they call Durabouasty. On the north it has the borders of Sei/nereh, and Kurkheh, and Lour, as far as the borders of Jehal, adjoining the territories of Spahaun. It is said that Lour was once reckoned as belonging to Khuzistan ; but at present it is comprehended within Jebal. The boundaries of Khuzistan towards Pars and (^L^UL^ Sfahan, and the borders of Jebal and Waset, are straight lines on the Your sides : But on the southern side, from Abadaji, to the vil lages about Waset, the boundary is an irregular line; and from Abadan to the sea, and the borders of Pars: then this southern boundary proceeds along the sea shore; then to the Dejleh, and passes from Lc;ij Barma: thence winds from above Meftah and jlcX« Medar, among the villages of Waset, there whence we first set out. (Map of Khuzistan.J Koureh Ahwaz is also called Hormuz Shehr. The other places of Khuzistan are the ^ e ^ lr Leshkur, which they also call Asker Mokrem; Shushter; Jondi Shapour; Sus ; Ram Hormuz; and JJ U Bazar: all these are the( 74 ) names of cities, but Bazar, which they call Souk, and its town Dourek; c X j J Aidah, Neher Tin*, 0 iv.^ Khaizan, LX}\ Houmah al net, 0 LJ1 al San, ' Soufc asunbeil, Mehader al Kehri, Mehadar al Sagheri, Hei, ^ Teh, Keliwan, are all towns of this district. ^05/, Arem, Souk al Arl'aa, (^cXy-c Hysn Mohdi, Basan, (^L k &gt;-L m Selsan, ^UI yx I kw Solymanan, Carcoub, Berdoun, and Karkheh. The land of Khuzistan is level. It has many running streams, the chief of which is the river of Shushter : and King Shapour * caused to be constructed on this river a wall (or mound) called 0 I Shadervan ; by means of which the town of Shushter, situated on' an eminence, might be supplied with water. This river comes from Leshkur (or Asker Mokrem) to_^l^^l Ahwaz, and falls into the river Sedreh, g oes on to the Hysn Mohdi, on the sea side.

( 75 ) when one has gone six farsang, all the water is drained off, for various purposes of husbandry and agriculture; and for two far sang the bed of the river is altogether dry. In the land of Khu- zistan there is not any place more populous or cultivated than Musherkan. The streams of Khuzistan, from Ahwaz, and Dourek, and Shushter, and all that rise in this quarter, are collected together at Hysn Mohdi, and there, forming one great river, fall into the sea. There is not any of the sea in Khuzistan, except a little of the Persian Sea, from Mahi rooyan, to near Solymanan, opposite Aha- dan: nor is there in all Khuzistan, any mountain, nor sand, except at Shushter, and Jondi Shapour, and Aidej, as far as the borders of Sfahan : all the rest is soft clay and level ground: And in any of the cities of Khuzistan I know not that they drink well-water: and the land of this province is more dry, in proportion as it is distant from the river Dejleh: that part nearer the Dejleh is like the soil of Basrah, and that region. Throughout Khuzistan there is not either ice or snow; nor is there any part of it which does not afford dates. It is a very unhealthy country. All kinds of fruit are to be found in Khu zistan, except walnuts ), and the fruit of trees peculiar to a cold climate. l 2( 70 ) For the greater part, Arabick and Persian are spoken in this province i there is also a particular dialect in Ivhuzistan. The fashion of the people, in their dress, resembles that of the inhabi tants of Irak. They are in general of bad dispositions; and mostly of a yellow complexion, with scanty beards; and of the Motazelite sect (Mahommedan schismaticks.) Among the wonders of Khuzistan, is the Shadervan of Sha~ pour (before mentioned) at Shushter. It is said to be a mile in length, constructed of stone and mortar, for the purpose of cop- ducting water to Shushter. In the city of Sus, there is a river; and I have heard, that, in the time of Ahou Mousa Ashoari, a coffin was found there ; and it is said the bones of Daniel the Pro phet (to whom be peace !) were in that coffin. These the people held in great veneration ; and in time of distress, or famine from droughts, they brought them out, and prayed for rain. Abou Mousa Ashoara ordered this coffin to be brought, and three cover ings or cases to be made for it; the first, or outside one, of which was of boards, exceedingly strong ; and caused it to be buried, so that it could not be viewed. A bay or gulf of the river came over this grave, which may be seen by any one who dives to the bottom of the water.( 77 ) There is also, in the district of Sumheil, near the bor ders of Pars, a mountain, from which fire issues at all times. At night this fire gives light; and smoke comes forth in the day-time : and the general opinion is, that there is here a fountain of OciJ Naphta, or of pitch (cxij), which has taken fire. There is also a species of scorpion ) which they call ojjjf'kezoureh: they are like the leaves of anjedan (the herb laserpitium or pellitory), and are more destructive than serpents. Very rich garments of brocade are manufactured at Shushter. At Sus there is a species of orange, which they call penj-angusht, (or five fingers,) said to be exceedingly fragrant. In this district there is a place called (^^2J Bosi, where they weave beautiful tapestry; as also at K.eliwcLn, and at Berdoun* - \ ' ^ - • v • ■ ••••■ ' .

At ajj U Zawieh, near Hysn Mohdi, on the sea-side, a great many streams are collected into one body ot water, atfected by tides, flux and reflux.

F rom Pars to Irak there are two roads; one by the way of Basrah, the other by way of Waset. The Basrah road is this: From Arghan to J^l Asel } two easy merhileh; from that to a village called ^I c X j /^ Deidan, one merhileh; from Deidan to Dour eh, and from that to Sasan, a pleasant town, through which a river flows: from Sasan to Hysn Mohdi, is a journey of two merhileh: from these two places one must go by water: and from Hysn Mohdi to ci &gt;U j Benat, two merhileh; and they go from Dourek to Basan by water, it being much easier than going by land. This is the extreme boundary of Khuzistan. Benat is situated on the banks of the river Dejleh; and, if one chooses he may go by water to Ablah, or by land, crossing over when he comes opposite Ablah. The road from Pars to Irak, by way of Waset, is from Arghan tojIjU Bazar, one merhileh; from that to Ramuz (pro bably for ycjb ^\j Ram Hormuz), two merhileh ; from Ramuz to j3J Leshkur, or Asker Mokrem, three merhileh; from that to Shushter, one merhileh: from Shushter to( 80 ) Jondi Shapour, one merhileh; and from Jondi Shapour to Sus, one merhileh; and from that to ( orcouh, one mer hileh. From Shushter to Jondi Shapour, is one merhileh; from that to Teih, one merhileh ; this place borders on the terri tories of Waset. From Leshkur to Ahwaz, is one merhi leh; from Ahwaz to Dourak, three merhileh; and this is a shorter way from Leshkur to Waset than that which passes by Shushter. From Leshkur to Aidej is four merhileh; from Ahwaz to Ramuz, three merhileh, ' because Ahwaz and Leshkur are situated on the same line, and Ramuz forms a triangle with them*.' From Leshkur to Bazar, one merhileh; and from Bazar to Hysn Mohdi, one merhileh ; from Ahwaz to Neher Tiri, one day's journey; and from Sus to Bosiy not so rpuch as one merhileh; and from Sus to Bardouriy one merhileh; and from Sus to Matout\ y one merhileh. Those are the whole of the distances, and stages in the province of Rhuzistan. t Or Matouby according to the Eton MS.( 81 ) c_wW. Description of the Province of Pars, (or Farsistan—Persia Proper.)

Their weapons and accoutrements, their numbers, war-horses, and troops, are such that they are able to contend with kings ; and it is said that their race is originally Arabian. They have sheep, and mares (or (^I jo L o she asses), and camels, but not so many: and I have heard that this people consist of above one hundred tribes ; but I only know between thirty and forty * of the tribes. I % ^ Of the Fortresses and Castles of Pars, T here are certain cities surrounded with strong walls; and others, in which there are citadels with strong outworks; and there are some castles, exceedingly strong, situated on hills and mountains. Among the cities which have citadels, is Istakhar, round the castle of which are strong fortifications. L ^ aj Beiza has a citadel with fortifications; also Sermeh r and c X a !/ Keleid: 1 Kurnah alias, in Persian called Dhey Moured, has- an ancient dez, or castle; and the fortifications of Shiraz have a kohendez; * The word tXji and, according to that most excdlent Dictionary, the Ferhung Bon- han Kattee, signifies same, a few, any number from three to nine, &amp;c. 11. 3 ■■■■( Q4 ) or an ancient castle. ^ Jour has a citadel, but no outworks. Kazeroun, has a kohendez also, with fortifications. Fesa, has a kohendez, with fortifications. Darah- jerd has a castle and wails. And I have heard, that in the pro vince of Pars there are more than five celebrated castles, situated in towns and on hills, which no king has ever been able to take. One of them is the castle of Ehn Omareh, ^ which they call (^LAji(3 K.(iIclcl JDcinbcLii. rhere the family of Omareh used to seize upon every tenth ship. The castle Kadbnn is situated on a mountain: neither i ^ j u \ v ^: Mohammed hen fl r ascl, with his army, nor Ahmed hen Allosein, were able to take it. The castle of c^bT Saied Ahad (the residence of Good Fortune) is one farsang from the Koureh of Istakhar. It was ori- ^ ginally called the Castle of Asfendiar. In the time of the Commander of tlie Faithful, the Prince of the Saints of God, ^ ^ Jz All hen Ahitaleb, to whom be peace! this castle was the residence of Zeycid hen Ommiah, and from that circumstance was called after him. In the time of the Beni Ommiah, ^ Alans our hen Mohammed hen Jaffer was Governor of Pars, and resided in this castle, which then received its name from him. Some time after that, it was ruined; and soon again repaired by ^ j . j Mohammed hen IFasel, who was Governor of Pars. When it was taken by (jsJ Yacouh hen( 93 ) Leith, he caused it to be once more demolished; it was, how ever, again repaired, and they used it as a prison. The castle of Ashnoun is supplied with water by a stream flowing from the heights of ^xJLo Manein, and it is very difficult of access. The castle of Khouderth is situated on the borders of Kam Firouz : it is strong, and difficult of access. The castle of Arjan is exceedingly strong; and it is im possible for me to describe all the castles which cannot be taken either by force or stratagem.. Account of the Fire-Temples of Pars. T here is not any district of this province, nor any village, without a Fire-temple. One, near Shapour, they call Kanhud Kaush* cXyjT At Kazeroun there is a Fire- temple, called dJLK^ Kheifeh : and another, called Kul- laden and Mesouhan: And in the religion of the Guehres it is thus ordained, that ' omnis foemina quae tem- ' pore graviditatis aut tempore menstruorum, fornicationem seu * So written both in the Eton MS. and my own ; but it should, probably, have been jj^lT Kaus, the name of an ancient king of Persia.( 06 ) '* adulterium fecerit, pura non erit, donee ad Pyrasum (seu tem- ' plum Ignicolarum) aceesserit (et) eoram Heirbed (Saeerdote) ' nuda fuerit et urina vacege se laverit*. Account of the Rivers of Pars, T he river Tab ujlb issues from the mountains of Isfa han, near Berje; and, being joined by another stream from the same quarter, at the village of Mes, proceeds to Arjan, and passes under the bridge called Dekan, and affords water to Pars, and Khuzistan, and Rousted- Zem, and falls into the sea.

The v'jj Foruah comes from the place of the same name, and runs under the (JjJ bridge, near the gates of Istakhar. But the rivers are very numerous in this province, and cannot be all described here. trjW. r . . J ? ; i . : Of the Lakes of Pars. T he Persian Sea is a bay of that great ocean which extends as far as China, along the coast of Hindoostan. In Persian it is called the Sea of Pars, or of Kirman, because that none of the countries situated on it are more populous, cultivated, or delightful, and because, in ancient times, the kings of Pars were the most powerful and illustrious; and even at this present time the people of Pars are famous in all quarters. One of the lakes is called u Bakhtegan, into which falls vicinity of Pcrsejolis, informed him, that the name of their tribe was Ohl.—Tour to Persia, &amp;c. octavo edition, p. 199.( 09 )) the river 'V' Kar, and it reaches to the borders of Kirman. It is in length about twenty farsang, and its waters are salt. This lake is in the Koureh of Istakhar. There is a small lake in the Koureh of Shapour, at the Desht (or waste) of Arzen, the length of which is ten farsang : its waters are sweet and pleasant; they were at one time dried up ; no water remained in this place: all the small sturgeon are taken here. There is another small lake in the Koureh of Shapour, near ^ Karzeih, the length of which is about ten farsang. Near jy* Mour the water is bitter, or saltish; and there is much fish- ing in it. The lake Heikan is of bitter water: it is twelve far sang in length. Salt is collected on its banks. It is part of ojjf Ardeshir Koureh, and they say belongs to Ardeshir Khereh. Its beginning is at the distance of two farsang from Shiraz, and it ends near the borders of Khuzistan. The lake of &lt;5u Sefhouiah is near eight farsang in length: it affords much fishing: On its banks are thick forests, and reeds or caries in great abundance: it belongs to the borders of Istakhar. o 2( 100 ) Description of the great Cities and remarkable Edifices, Istakhar* is a city neither small nor great, more ancient than any city whatsoever of Pars. The extent of it is about one mile; and the sovereigns of Pars had their dwellings there, and Ardeshir resided in that place; and there is a tradition that Solo- ^ - mon, the Prophet (the blessing of God be on him !) used to set out from Tahertha\ in the morning, and at night arrive at Istakhar. There is in Istakhar a mosque, which they call the Mosque of Solomon, the son of David: and some people affirm that Jem, who reigned before l J Zohak y was Solomon; but that opinion is erroneous. In ancient times Istakhar was well inhabited; and the bridge called Pool-i-Khorasan or the Khorasan bridge, is without the city. Beshadour was built by King Shapour. It has strong ramparts, and a ditch with water, in which weeds and thorns grow as high as the waist of a man, so thickly entangled,, that one cannot, without considerable difficulty, be extricated * The reader will find the original Persian of this passage in my ' Epitome of the Ancient History of Persia,' Appendix, p. 91. t Ot Tiheriah.( 101 ) from them. This place has four gates; and in the midst of-it is a singular hill, or eminence, like a tower or dome. The build ings are of clay. ^4.2^ Jawr was built by Ardeshir. It is said that this place was formerly a small lake, and that Ardeshir, having there ob tained a victory over his enemy, desired to build a city on the spot, and ordered the water to be drained away. The walls are of clay. There are four gates: One is called the Bah Mihr; it leads to the east: another is the L - jIj Bah Beh- ram, leading to the west. On the right hand is situated the Derwazeh Hormuz, or Gate of Hormuz; and on the left the gate of Ardeshir This gate was erected by Ardeshir; and from it there is a view of all the districts and territories» Opposite to this is a hill, from which water gushes with great force, and falls into an aqueduct, which was formed of stone and mortar, but is now fallen to ruin. The city is well supplied with running water; and in the vicinity of each gate there is about a farsang laid out in gardens and pleasure- grounds. „ j Shiraz is a modern city, built by 1 c X v 2 s :''' c Mohammed hen alcassem Okail, uncle (or cousin-german) of Hejaje hen Yousuf. The productions of every city are-brought to Shiraz, and are not taken from that to any place. This was chosen as the station of the army of Islam,,( 102 ) on account of its vicinity to Istakhar, during the war* The city was at that time built i it extends about one farsang, and has not any walls. Here is a ^ Divan (Court of Revenue, Tribunal, &amp;c.) and the Collectors of the Revenue go there. b' Karzein is a small town, about the size of Istakhar, and the best in that Koureh. The town called iXjC Mekeh\ is situated near the borders of Yezd and Aherkouh, and near the territories of Kirman; and Herieh goes be tween from the Shek of Kirman and the borders of Isfahan J. Mekeh is situated on the skirt of the desert : it is a pleasant town, and well supplied with provisions. There is a town with a castle and two iron gates; one called j ^ j I l - j I j Bah Ahrow, the other uj I j Bah al Mesjed. Here is a mosque; and they drink water conveyed in trenches or canals; and there is a stream also which flows from the castle. In this village there is great abundance of fruit, and many trees and edifices. Aberkouh is a plentiful town, about the same size as * The war which gave the Mussulmans possession of the Persian empire, in the middle of the seventh century of the Christian aera. t Probably for Katta.

From this place they send corn to Shiraz. Of the Koureh of Shapour. O ne of the chief cities in the Koureh Shapour, is ^ Cazeroun. It is about the size of Nuhendjan; but Cazeroun is more populous, and stronger, and of better air: the air of Cazeroun is the purest of all Pars. They drink there, well- water ; and have abundance of fruits and crops. Cazeroun and Nubendjan are the most plentiful places of all the Koureh of Shapour. in the present i all Preface./ ( 104 ) / 6 Of the Koureh of T he largest town in the Koureh of Darabjerd is Besa. It is of the same size as Shiraz ; and the air ot Besa is better than that of Shiraz. In their buildings they use cypress wood. It is an ancient city, with a castle, and walls and ditches. All the productions of a warm and cold climate are to be tound there, dates, oranges, &amp;c. All the towns of Darabjerd are near each other. Of the towns of ojO Ardeshir Dereh we have already mentioned Shiraz. After that is Siraf, about as large as Shiraz. Here are very wealthy men, such as merchants, and others, who expend thirty thousand dinars on the building of their houses. There are not any trees immediately about Siraf. There is a mountain on the east of the city which they call ^ Jem ; this affords fruits and water for the town. Siraf enjoys a warmer climate than any ot those other tow ns. 0 l^;1 Jrjan is a considerable city, producing dates and olives in great plenty. Trom Arjan to the sea is a distance of one mer-( 105 ) hilch • so that it partakes of tlie land and sca^ of the mountainous and level country. * The greatest cities of Pars are Shiraz, and Siraf, and Arghan. Nubendjan enjoys a warm climate; it has a few date tiees. Shaah houan is within two farsang of Nubendjan: it consists of several villages, with running water, and so many trees that the sun with difficulty shines upon the ground. Jenahah, and Sinir, and Mahirooyan, are of very warm air, situated on the sea coast^ and abounding in the fruits of a warm climate. QWjU CJ UL kmj The Distances r&gt;f Places in Ears.

Of the Water, and Climate, and Soil of Fars*. T he land of Fars is divided into the warm region, lying to the south, as far as i ^ jjj ^ Karzin, and Zem, and Da rah gird, to Firkh and Hereje. The northern division is cold. In the warm region are comprised Arghan, and Nubendjan, and Mahrooian, and Sinir, and Jenabah, and Touje, and Deshti Reshak, and Her eh, and Darein, and Jawr, and Cazeroun, and (^ j ^U Marein, and S emir an, and Khemqigan, and ^ \^y c ^ flor muz Keran, and ^?

But Jawr, and Besa, and Shiraz, and Beshadoury and Cazeroun, are nearly alike in climate. The cold region is that in which fruits do not arrive at perfection, and where corn only is produced, such as Yezd, and Goured, and Roustak, and Istakhar, and Rahban. In the warm places, during the summer season, no bird remains on account of the excessive heat. In some parts of it, flesh, if laid upon the stones, in summer time, will be roasted. The cli mate of the cold region is very healthy: that of the warm parts is not so good, especially of Darabgird. Arghan enjoys a better air, such as Siraf and Jenabah. Shiraz, and Besa, and Cazeroun, and Jawr, are of a more temperate and salubrious climate. The water at Darabgird is bad. mine a a( 114 ) Of the Persons (also of the Manners, Languages, Religions, and Chief Families J of the oj T he inhabitants of the warm parts of this province are of slender make, and brown complexions*, with little hair. In the colder region they are fatter, and have more hair, and their com plexions are fairer. And they have three languages : The Par si w hich they use in speaking, one to another; though there may be some variations of dialects in ditFerent dis tricts, yet it is in fact all the same, and they all understand the language of each other, and none of their expressions or words are unintelligible: The Pehlavi language, (SjKi which was formerly used in writings ; this language now requires a com mentary or explanatory treatise; and the Arahick language, ( j L j 'J which at present is used in the Divans, or Royal Courts of Justice, Revenue, &amp;c» The dress and ornaments of the princes are, short coats, or tunicks, open before; and large cloaks, or outer garments ; small sashes wrapped round the turbans, and swords hung by belts. * Literally wheat-coloured t .( 115 ) with tight boots.

The secretaries, or writers semble those of the Arabians. As to the manners of the people in Pars, those who are the chief men, and who occupy the higher offices in the service of the sovereign, are polite and courteous; they have fine palaces, and are very hospitable. The people, in general, are kind and civil in their manners. The merchants are remarkably covetous, and desirous of wealth. I have heard that there was a certain man of Siraf who had passed forty years at sea, never leaving his ship during that time: whenever he came to a port, he sent some of his people on shore to transact his commercial affairs; and when that business was finished, he sailed on to some other place. The inhabitants of Siraf devote their whole time to com merce and merchandize. The Author of the book, says, ' 1 my self saw at this place several persons who possessed/bz^r thousand thousand dinars; and there were some who had still more; and their clothes were like those of hired labourers.' But the people of Cazeroun and Besa traffick on shore; and they derive their fortunes from this kind of commerce: they are persevering and patient in the acquiring of riches; and the men of Pars, where soever they go, are powerful and wealthy. caps (oJl/'), so that their ears are covered, the end hanging of Pars, wear the cloak and boots, and their habits re-( ne ) As to the different religious sects of the people of Pars, those who inhabit the sea-shore are of the same sect as the people of Basrah. From Siraf to Mahi-rooyan, and to At glinn, are nearly all the same. TLhe inhabitants ot ^he Moatazelite heresy: Those who dwell in the warm region are of seven different sects : and those of the cold region, of Shiraz, and Istakhar, and Besa, are believers in the Sonna (or traditions of Mahommed); and some are like the people of Baghdad, and have the Fetwa, according to the rules of those who tollow the Hadith, or holy traditions. In Pars there are Fire-worshippers, or Guebres and Christians (^LjUy), and some Jews ' and the books . of the Guebres, their fire temples, and their customs or cere monies of Guebrism, or Magism, still continue among the people of Pars; and there are not in any country of Islam so many Guebres as in the land of Pars, which has been their capital or chief residence I n the books of the Persians ( q U^I j ) it is recorded that se veral of their kings were of Pars, such as Zohak, and Jem, and Feridoun, and others, till the time that Feridoun divided the earth among his sons; and they were the kings of the earth till the time that ZhuTkarnein (Alexander the Great) came, and slew * See the original of this passage in the Appendix.( 117 ) Dara, the son of Darab; and the empire declined until the time of Ardeshir. After him there were kings, such as Shapour, and Baharam, and Kobad, and Firouz, and Hormuz^, and others ; most of whom were of Pars, or of Arabia: their dominion ex tended to the borders of Roum. But when an Arabian race concjuered the ^\ r hole w^orld, l J ars became as a considerable province to them, and the seat of empire was removed to Irak. The kings of Pars have been highly celebrated; their history is so well known, that it were unnecessary to say more of it in this place. Since the introduction of the true faith (Islam), there have been many illustrious men from this province, (Pars.) One of these was Hormuz, a Guebre, who, in the time of Omar ebn Alkhitab, may God reward him ! was taken by Abdallah ben Omar, and put to death. Selmctn Farsi (Selman the Persian) also was one of those illustrious men: his piety is celebrated throughout ^the world: he sought the truth of religion in all quarters, until he found it at Medina, with the prophet, the peace and blessing of God be on him! in consequence of which, Selman became a true believer f.. * See the series of all these kings in the ' Epitome of the Ancient History of Persia.. t- Vide D H errelot Bibl.

It is said that their empire existed before the time of Moses, on whom be the blessing of God ! and that it is to some princes of this family the Koran alludes in that passage, ' And there was behind them a king, who forcibly seized on every (sound) ship^.' And to this very time they have sol diers, and plunder on the sea, and pay not tribute to any king: and it was with &lt;5jJlcX^ Ahdallah hen Ahmed al Jelendi that cUdJI Omru hen Leith made war for two years; and he did not conquer him until he had called to his assistance two of the family of Omru.

Ahu Sareh, who seized upon Pars^ was of this family: he retained possession of Pars until the Khalif q ^«L o Mamoun sent cUx^iM Mohammed hen alashaath against him, when, in the desert of Shiraz, his, army was defeated, and himself slain. To^x^J ^j! j **—* Jqffer hen ahi Zoheir, I p Haroun Arrashid gave the viziership.

The race of Khanteleh, the sons of Temim: They are of the family of ajo ! o Arweh hen Adyeh, who crossed over from Bahrein to Pars, in the time of the Ommiades ( a ^I ^ aj ). After the death of Arweh, they settled in Istakhar, where they accumulated great riches, and lived in splendour. One of them, called Omru, was so wealthy that he purchased a book * (^-JUs^ 0 ) at the price of one thousand dinars, and bequeathed sums of money for religious purposes, and alms, throughout all the cities and provinces of Islam; and the income and taxes of their estates were ten thou sand thousand direms. jjr 2 Omru hen Ibrahim received from the Khalif # More particularly the Koran.( 120 ) Mamoun the sovereignty of the sea. A i ter him, CiH Merdas hen Omru, who was called Bouyellan, possessed such estates, that every year his taxes amounted to three thou sand direms. His son, J^lj ^ o\ v ^ Mohammed hen JVasel, was equally rich. The chiet ot this tribe w^as jSj-*- 2 Omru hen Aiseh. At the time the Turks assumed the Kha lifat, they desired to remove them from court ; and the pro vince of Fars was divided among forty nobles of the Turks, the chief of whom was «jJ ^ Mauled : Having reproved them for their tyrannical conduct and wickedness, they all conspired against him, and sought to kill him : he applied for protection to Mer das, who saved him from those nobles, and sent him to Bagh dad. The Turks then gave the command to Ibrahim hen Si mar a ; and Ahdallah hen Yahia sent a letter, desiring that those nobles might be seized, and put to death. Ibrahim ben Simara took four of them, and slew them; and pardoned the others. From that time forth he was chief of the Turks by j (j^j) m Pars. Mohammed hen IFaseL was in possession of Pars; and ^-Xx^ IcXx^: Jhdar rahman hen MoJiaJi was sent from Baghdad with a great army, and a general, named Tashem. In a battle with Mohammed ben Wasel, this Tashem was slain ; and Abdar rahman, being taken prisoner, was put to death. Pars continued in his possession until his kinsman Merdas invited Yacoub ben Leith, who came into Pars,( 121 ) and defeated Mohammed ben Wasel, who fled from UdLo Beiza to Merou. At the time that Mohammed ben Wasel re turned from battle with Abdarrahman ben Moflah, Yaeoub ben Leith defeated Mohammed, who went to sea (or fell into the sea, OLol and was brought from that to Yacoub: he was confined for some years in a castle; but, whilst Yacoub was absent, having gone to the borders of ^ Nishapour, Mohammed, with a band of the prisoners, got possession of the castle, and Yacoub sent people to put them to death. The race of Saman Jl (the Samanides) are descended from Bahram, and Bahram was of Kheir in ^ j\ Ardeshirgerd: there he resided, and went from that to Herat, and conquered the army of the Turks ^ fcy, and was so successful that the army of &lt;Sj^ Kesri (the Persian mo narch) was terrified at his exploits But the story is very long. The family of Saman is descended from him ; and for many years the government of^UI MaweraVnahr and ^ Balkh and the countries bordering on the Jihoun, or river Oxus, was in their hands. (^. j Ismael ben Ahmed hen Asad possessed so extensive an empire, that Khorasan, and Mawarlnahr, ari( i Tabaristan, and b ^ Gurlcan, and Koumesh, and * See D'H erbelot Bibl, Orient. Art.

In his time no.-^ body could oppose or controul his sway. yUj Ali hen Alhosein hen Bashr was of the tribe of Ojl Azd, which dwelt at Bohharah. He entered Pars, and acquired power, until Yacoub ben Leith opposed him in battle, and overcame him at oJnXs Kantereh, a place near Shiraz. He was taken prisoner, and for some time confined, and after that put to death. The kings of the Zems : These kings had in their courts not less than a thousand horsemen. The Zem Mesejan, which was called the Zem of Jelouiah al mehrjan hen Ruzhah r *J. Jelouiah went to this Zem from Hemaigan Sefly of the Koureh of Istakhar, and served dX&gt;*&gt; Seleh. When Seleh died (Oolj Jelouiah took possession of the Zem, which from that time was called after him. His success continued, and arrived* at such a degree that he attacked the family of Budolph Jl, and slew ^ Maakel hen Isa, the MI MIW——— ■■■■■IJULI( 123 ) brother of Budolf. Then Budolf came and slew him, and cut off his head; and the family of Budolf, as long as they existed, considered this head as lucky, and productive of good fortune to them. For some time they put it on a spear, and bore it about in front of the army. The skull was set in silver, and continued till the time that OuJ jjr^- Omru hen Leith defeated 1 c X ac t^j.j Ahmed hen ahdalaziz, when that curiosity having fallen into his hands, he ordered it to be broken. The government of this Zem is still in the hands of the family of Jelouiah. The Zem Divan: The chief of this was Azad Murd of Kouhestan The government of this still continues in his family; and it was Mohammed hen Ibrahim who drew forth an army against Azad Murd, until at last he fled before him. The bT Zem Karian is in possession of the race of Soffcir JT). Their chief Hajer hen Ahmed hen Alhassan. The Zem Badenjan: the chief of this was Shehriar. Now it has passed to Musa Ihrahim. Some of this tribe have removed from Pars to Isfa han : their estates in Pars are very considerable, and the govern ment is still in their family. r 2^JLLJl Ahdallah hen alMefakaa was of Pars: he dwelt in Basrah; and was slain there in the time ot Mans our. The occasion of this was as follows: he had given a passport, or letter of security, for ^ ^ Ahdallah hen Ali hen Mansour; and in it was written ' If this ' promise of protection should not be observed, or if violence ' should be offered to him, Mussulmans shall nevertheless be free '• from any blame.' Mansour, enraged at this, sent an order to the Aumil (or Chief Collector of Revenue) at Basrah, that he should privately destroy Abdallah ben al Metakaa. Yahouiah, the Grammarian and Scribe, was originally ot Istakhar: he resided at Basrah, and died at Shiraz, where his tomb is. He composed a Treatise on Grammar. A great many officers of the Khalif's Divans (or Courts of Justice, Revenue, &amp;c.) were of Pars; some viziers, such as the Barmelcs (Barmecides). At all times the offices of state were filled by men from Pars, who are peculiarly qualified for those situations, because they are rendered so expert in business, by the multiplicity and various forms of their Courts and Tribu- ( 124 ) Of the Debiran Writers or Seeretaries) of Pars, who were illustrious there, was cH 1 ' lhl ' l Humeid hen Yahia : he was of the Ommiah family, and his story is well known.( 125 ) nals, that one person will discharge the functions of several diffi cult offices. I have not seen any others who were so universally acquainted with business, except two or three : ^2aJ I Maall hen al Nasser, who was secretary to Hassan Reja ; he came from Irak, and was killed at Shiraz. Hassan Reja, who managed the war department, caused a tomb to be erected for him at Shiraz. j\0^j Bedar Iledaf hen Zerar al Mazeni was fifty years employed in the Divans, and lived six years after he became blind. Hainan hen Behram was of Shiraz, and belonged to the Divan ot Ali hen al hosein hen Basher: Ji*j I l ie was afterwards transferred to the Divan of Mo hammed hen fVasel, and superintended every Divan except that of Ambassadors. &lt;jJUIcX&gt;x i ^ j - Hosein hen Ahdallah, who was sur- named j-j!

The family of UjO^ Hahih Medrek, and the \( 126 ) family of Fuzl, the son of thtit Ilabib, cue ot this tube, which is originally I^.clth Fivouz, fhey settled at Shiraz, and managed important matters^ and hecamc gi cat, and the Khalif Mamoun invited Medrek ben Hahib to Baghdad, and held him in high esteem. His death happened in Baghdad, in the time of Motazem. It is said that Yahia Aksem hired some person to murder him privately. The race of the Beni Sefar ^ I are of the tribe of Bamlah.

(J'- v ^) Many other men of Pars have arrived at high religious dignity in various places. ..W Hosein hen Mansour al Hellah (( C( was of Beiza. He was a man of probity, and virtue, and wisdom ; and arrived at considerable eminence. He said, Whosoever ' honestly strives with all his heart, and, separating himself from ' the allurements of pleasure, shall hold fast the bridle ot sensual desire, and patiently wait, shall ascend to the court of honours by the steps of uprightness, and gradually be purified from the ' infirmities of human nature; or if human nature should occa- ' sionally shew itself in him, it will be such as was imparted to ' Mary the Virgin, by the power of the spirit of Almighty God,, ' the fruit of which was Jesus, on whom be peace! All that ' such a man shall utter, will be, as it were, the voice of the ' Lord; and all his actions, as it were, divine; and all his com- ' mands like those of Heaven.' In this manner spoke Hosein ben Mansour, and preached to all the people about him, till many of the viziers and officers of the Divan began to imitate him ; and he gained influence over the nobles and princes of Irak, and Je- zireh, and Jebal, and Rei. He would not return to Pars; and meditating on his own business, he went to Baghdad, and was in the palace of the Khalif, and had attendants, porters, and slaves, till at length he was hanged alive..( 128 ) Hassan, surnamed Ahu Saied, was of low origin. He introduced the heresy of the Karmes- tians. Having gone to Bahrein on mercantile business, he preached to the people of Arabia, and great numbers followed him; and he acquired such power that he defeated armies, and took a castle from the people of Oman, and seized some towns of Arabia; but was at last slain. Selman hen Hassan was a man who went into the road of the hadjes, or pilgrims going to Mecca, and robbed and slew them : and at last proceeded to such lengths, that he plundered the treasures of the Kaaba, and killed the pious men who devoted themselves there to incessant prayen In conse quence of this, Hejaje ordered his kinsmen to be seized, and brought to Shiraz; they were kept a while in confinement; but, being men of good character, were not made responsible for his offences. Account of the most extraordinary Edifices in Pars, (and other Curiosities.J In the territory of Istakhar is a great building, with statues can ed in stone; and there, also, are inscriptions, and( 120 ) paintings. It is said that this was a temple of Solomon, to whom be peace ! and that it was built by the Dives, or Demons: similar edifices are in Syria, and Baalbeck, and Egypt. In the territory of Istakhar, also, there is a kind of apple, half of which is sweet, and half sour. Merdas ben Omru mentioned this circumstance to Hassan Reja : he denied the possi bility of it, and Merdas sent and caused one to be brought, and shewed it to him *. At the village of Ahdarrahman there is a certain great pit, the bottom of which is dry all the year, except at the season for watering the fields, when water issues from it, and serves for the purposes of agriculture and for drinking. When it is not any longer necessary for the husband man's use, the water disappears. In the territory of Shapour, there is a mountain; and in that mountain are the statues of all the kings, and generals, and high priests ( c X j ^© Moubed), and illustrious men, who have existed in Pars: ' And in that place are some persons who have representations of them, and the stories of them written fand this tribe belongs to the territory of Arghan, at Eysn Mohdi (j£&lt;_Xy-c * See the Persian of this and the preceding passage in the Appendix.( 130 ) At the city ofjj^ Jawr, near the northern gate, is a pond, or pool of water, in which a brazen vessel is so placed, that, from a hole in it, the water issues with great violence. In the vicinity of j4hBvltouh arc considerable heaps of ashes. The common people say, that here was the hie of Nim- rod (into which he caused Abraham to be thrown.) But this is not true : the fact is, thatNimrod, and the kings of Canaan, dwelt in the land of Babylon. In the Koureh of Arghan, at the village called Vj*-' ^ Sahil al Areb, there is a well, from which proceeds water enough to turn a mill, and water the fields. The people here say, that they have made various efforts to ascertain the depth of this well, but have not ever been able to reach the bottom» In the Koureh of ^I ^ Rostak ar rostak, there is a place between two hills, from which smoke constantly issues; and it is said, that if a bird should fly near that place, it would drop down. In the Desht-Varein, there is a village called tjjtvsL KhosruJiein, in which there is not any tree. Here is a family, of whose sorceries and magick I have heard such an anecdote as cannot be repeated.( 131 ) In ojcS jA O;! Ardeshir Dereh, near the gate of Shiraz, is a fountain, of which they drink the water as a purgative: one cup full operates once upon the body; two cups full, twice : if one drinks many, it occasions vomitings, and excessive evacu ations. Near Arghan, on the borders of Rhuzistan, is a remarkable pile, or heap, called the ^jj Tel Deilemi, with a vault or recess, two hundred paces broad, and so high that a man, mounted on a mule, with a standard in his hand, cannot reach the top. In the territory of Kouan, there is a certain flower, which they eat green, like the leaves of the Chukender. In the territory of Shiraz there is a plant, or herb, which they call ^ k » Susen Nergus, (the Lily Narcissus.) Near Varein there is a river, called Nehr- Cheen, the water of which is pleasant to the taste, and is used for the purposes of agriculture; but when clothes are washed in it, it becomes green. s 2j\ (Aj j j' ' y^ Account of the Commodities and Productions of Fars T he rose-water of Shiraz is most remarkably excellent, and highly esteemed in all parts of the world. It is chiefly made at Jawr, and sent by sea to Hejaz, and Vemen : it is also sent to Syria, and Egypt, and Magreb or Africa, and Khorasan. Here also is made oil, better than that of any other place, except the oil of Kheiri J an( l ^at of Cufah. At Sinir, and Jenahah, and Kazeroun, and Tooje, linen garments are manufactured; and the embroidery and clothes made at L»* j Besa are esteemed by the princes in all countries, and sent into all parts of the world. The gold brocade worn by the princes is made at Besa. This embroidery is performed with a needle : and here, they also weave cloth of gold, and fine garments, and hangings, and silk,, and camel's hair. At djj Yezd and \ Aberkouh they manufacture clothes of silk and cotton; at Jehrem, fine carpets.

Besa is remarkable for needle-work; and they excel there, in respect to that art, the people of Corcoub* At Siraf they abound in marine productions, and com modities brought by sea; such as aloes, ambergris, camphire, pearls, canes, ivory, and ebony: pepper, sandal, and various kinds of drugs and medicines, are sent from that place to all quarters of the world; and in this city there are such wealthy merchants, that several of them possess fortunes of sixty thousand thousand direms; and I have seen them. At Arghan, in the village called Afaresk, they make such excellent L- j UL j O doushah (syrup), that no other place can equal it in that respect, except Seilan. At Kazeroun there is a certain species of date, called Jcheilan, which they send into Irak and Isfahan. At Darahgird, in the ditches which surround the town, there is a certain fish extremely pleasing to the taste, without any bone.. In the vicinity of Darabgird, Jimrnmy is found. Once every year they open the place where it is produced, and a cer tain quantity of it is taken for the king's use, in presence of confidential persons, who then seal up the place.. And in the ter- i( 134 ) rltory of Darabgird there are hills of salt, white, black, yellow and green. In the land of Pars tliere are mines of siK er, and ii on, and lead, and sulphur, and naphta. Ihe silver is scarce, and found in the cold region called ^- aj L o Manein. Iron is brought fiom the mountains of Istakhar, and trom the place called Darabgird. The striped stuffs of Shiraz are well known; and in the Koureli of Istakhar they manufacture fine linen. Of the Money, the Weights, and Measures, of the People of Fars. In buying and selling, they use direms and dinars: but since the time of the Kesris*, to the present day, there has not been any coinage of direms in Pars, unless in the name of the Emir al Moumenin Commander of the Faithful. * The fourth Dynasty of Persian kings, or the Sassanides are called the Akasreh or Kesris ; of these Noushirvan was peculiarly styled Kesri : in his reign Mohammed was born.

The measure or weight of Beiza is more than that of Istakhar by about a tenth and half a tenth; and the measure of Kam Firouz is greater than that of Beiza, by about one tenth.

T he gates of wealth, or those by which money is supplied in the Divans, are the taxes or tribute : a tenth on ships; a fifth on the mines, on corn, fodder, the mint, the roads, the canals, fiuits, iced waters, salt, &amp;c. The tribute of lands is of three kinds: by division, and by regulations and statutes. All the proportions are exactly ascertained, and admit not of any diminution. Whether the ground be tilled, or not tilled, the measurements and divisions take place: it the ground is cultivated, it pays tribute; if not cultivated, it is so much lost. The greater part of the country is subject to measurement, as far as the Zems are. The taxes of Shiraz are more considerable, in proportion as their jereib is the great jereib for such things as wheat and barley. The jereib is two hundred and thirty-seven direms. The garden jereih is one thousand four hundred and twenty-five direms. The small jereib is sixty y guz, of the king's cubit or yard &gt; an( i the king's cubit is nine( 137 ) iwLo kehsets, or handfuls. The great tax is the tax of Shiraz, because j K &amp; j ^. j I jixz* Jqffer hen Ahi Zoheir spoke to Haroun Ar'rasheid on the subject, and he ordered that a third and a fourth should be paid. The tribute of Istakhar is not so con siderable as that of Shiraz. The tax of division is of two kinds. The better is that of the Emir al Moumenin Omar, (may God reward him !) and the other khalifs, which divides into tens, threes, and fours. These are taxes paid on the products of agriculture, and various other duties and tributes, nearly the same as in other countries. In all Pars there is not any mint, except at Shiraz. The land belongs to the sovereign: he lets it out to farm at certain rents. There was not any tax in Pars on shops, or work-houses, or gar dens, or trees, Ali hen Isa laid a tax on them «• in the year 302 *. # A.

To the east of Kirman lie the land of Makran, and the deserts of that country, and Bahrein (the two seas), on the borders of Bolouje, To the west of Rirman lies the land of Pars, which we have before described. On the north are the deserts of Khorasan and Sejestan; and on the south the Per sian sea and Seirgan ; and, in a cornei, a part of Pars. In the region of Kirman the climate is both warm and cold. The fruits are of all kinds; chiefly those of the warm climates. Part of Kirman is bordered by the sea. Here are their harbours and ports, which are subject to excessive heat, such as HomxuZ} and Jaronn, and some others, and the air in general is not pure. Now we proceed to describe the cities and mountains of Kir man, and to lay before the reader a map of that province, such as we have seen it. (Page left blank for a map of Kirman.)( »39 ) Sirgan, Jireft, -j Bam, Hormuz, Douhiji: these cities are, by some, reckoned as belonging to Pars; by others to Kirman. ^Jiroukan, Mczer- kan, Sourkan, (jwIM Alias, Keri, Maaun* Between ^ Sirgan and the desert of &lt;3jj Yezd are the towns of q&amp;j ^Jirdeh, O ^ jj Zerend, ^ jc V ^ Ferdin, ^jl ^Us Mahan, and Khehis; and on the side of the desert, near Bam, is Bennasir. Mehreje, Sinje, situated in the midst of the desert, and remote from Kirman, though reckoned as some of its territories. Khouas, the boundary of Kirman, is said, by some, to be a territory of Se^ jestan. The mountains of Karen : Aikan, Deher Houmah, are by some assigned to ^jLc j . j \ Kouhestan abou Ghanem. Between Hormuz and Jireft are the towns of Koumin, ^ Kijyo Merzingan, Menu* Jan. On the sea-coast are the mountains or hills of Kefes* {j&amp;xi Baren and the mountains of the silver mines. In Kirman there is not any lake or great river: there is that bay, or gulph, called the Persian Sea, which comes from the ocean near Hormuz; the water is salt, and ships pass on it to and fro. In parts of Kirman there are several mines. t 2( 140 ) ouy' Of the Mountains of Kir man, (the Inhabitants, and Chief Cities.) The mountains of Kefes lie on the southern border, near the sea. To the north, near the borders of Jireft, are Rudan and the Kouhestan, or hilly country of jj \ Abu- ^hanein. On the east is J\.hoiias, and the desert ex tending towards Kefes, and the province of Makran. On the • south of that is Bolouje, or Bolouche, and the borders of Mirjan In the mountains near Hormuz, it is said, there is much culti vated land, and cattle, and many strong places. On every mountain there is a chief: and they have an allowance from the Sultan or Sovereign; yet they infest the roads of Kirman, and as far as the borders of Fars and of Sejestan : they commit their robberies on foot ; and it is said that their race is of Arabian origin, and that they have accumulated vast wealth. ' The Boloujes, are ' in the desert of Mount Kefes o ^T - and Kefes in the ' Parsi language is Kouje; and they call these two people ' Koujes and Boloujes. The Boloujes are people who dwell( 141 ) ' in the desert * : they infest the roads, and have not respect for ' any person.' The mountains of Mar en belong to the cold region of Kirman : they are fertile and strong ; snow falls on them : and in the time of the Guebres, or Fire-worshippers, they used to come down from these mountains and rob ; but in the reign of the Ab- bassides they became converts to the true religion, and have kept their hands from evil actions. These mountains aifbrd mines of iron. The mountains of the silver mines are near the borders of Jireft, and extend to the pass of Derhan) from that to the silver mountains is a journey of two merhileh. There are pleasant and fertile valleys, with small towns, and many delight ful villas. The warm part of Kirman is more extensive than the cold ; in somuch that there is not above one-fourth of the province liable to the cold, from the borders of ^ Sirgan to the desert, in the vicinity of Bam. The warm region extends from the borders of Hormuz to Makran, and to the confines of Pars, and of Sirgan, throughout Hormuz, and Miougan, and Jireft, * The epithet Sehra Nishin (See Appendix) is sometimes used to express a solitary retired man, a hermit, &amp;c. The Ferhung Borhan Kattea informs us, that Bo- louche is the name of a people inhabiting the desert , a ^ SO ^ ie narne a country of Iran or Persia. I write the name Bolouche, on the authority of this excellent dictionary, which accents the first syllable with dammay and describes the last lettei: chim Farsi.( 142 ) and the hills of Kouje, and the desht viran, or ' the dreary wastealso throughout Bam and the desert, and to the borders of Kirman, and to ^2^ Kheis. The inhabitants of Kirman are lean and slender, with brown complexions*. Towards the west of Jireft, snow falls. Among the hills of silver, and as far as Derban to Jireft, and likewise from before the hill of Bar em to near Jireft, and the place called Mesihan and Derman, there runs a consi derable river, with such a rapid stream, that it is not to be crossed without difficulty : it turns about twenty mills, Hormuz is the emporium of the merchants in Kirman, and their chief sea-port: it has mosques and market places, and the merchants reside in the suburbs. ♦ Jireft is in extent nearly two miles; it is situated near the sea: here they enjoy at once all the productions of both warm and cold climates. Bam is a considerable town, with extensive suburbs. Prayers are said on the chief festivals, in three different great mosques, and there is a small one in the market-place. Some of the people are of the Sonnite sect. In the castle of the city there is another mosque, with a publick treasury, and other offices. * Literally wheat-coloured ^( 143 ) The town of Sirgan is watered by subterraneous trenches or aqueducts : in the suburbs they raise water from wells. This is the largest of all the cities in Kirman. The in habitants are observers of the Hadith, (or holy traditions.) The people ofjlj&lt;3jj Rudhar, Kohestan, ^jlt jj Bou Gha- nem, and Bolouje, are all of the Shiah sect: and from the borders of Maaoun, and C&gt;jSi£&gt;l} Lashgird, to the terri tories of Hormuz, the people are industrious and honest; they cultivate sugar, and eat bread made of millet They give one tenth of their dates to the king, like the people of Bas rah : and whatever dates are shaken from the trees by the wind, they do not touch, but leave them for those who have not any, or for travellers: and it happened one year, that half the dates were thus blown off the trees, yet the owner did not take one of them. The territory of Rouiest is a dry soiL The people are, for the greater part, robbers and plunderers. There are a town and a village on the sea-coast, where they catch fish. It is a stage on the road to Pars.. The language of the inhabitants of Kirman is the Persian; but the Kouches have another language, and also the Bolouches. Fine linen and striped stuffs are manufactured at OojJ Zareid, and are sent into Pars and Irak.( 144 ) The Khouas are a tribe of the desert: they have camels, and date trees; and their houses are made of reeds. oUL^-c ^ The Distances of Places in Kirman.

After this, u( 14(5 ) we shall proceed to speak of the Land of c X vmj Sind, and part of Hind, if God permit. j 0^$ C&gt;}L&gt; Of the Country of Sind, and part of Hind, W e proceed to describe the land of Sind, and some part ot Hind, and the country of Makran, and Touran, and A^cXJ Nedeheh, and the bordering territories which belong to the possessors of Islam. The eastern boundary of these regions is the Persian Sea. On the western side lie Kirman, and the deserts of Sejestan, and some territories of that province. On the north is the land of Hind, and its territories. The southern boundaries are the deserts of Makran, and the territory of the Bolouches; and a part of this borders on the Persian Sea, which is winding and curved on these confines. Now we shall lay before the reader a map of those parts of Hind and Sind, and describe the curious and extraordinary places of them. Some parts belong' to Guebres and a greater portion of this country to ^ \y» ^ Kafers (Infidels) and Idolatersand Pait| ( 147 ) (^Uuw^j ; a minute description of these places would, there fore, be unnecessary and unprofitable. fBlank page for a Map of Sind and Hind.J f Hind. and some parU Tom ies which belt J ersm Sea. 0: jestan, and soi j land of Hini ■e the deserts oi id a part of i , curved on to of those parts ot ,raordinaij|^ cfc {), and a greate ek) and Idolat® Ot^Lol I ^ Of the Cities and Towns situated in these Countries.

The other cities of Sind are, Mansourah, which they call ajc X xkw Sindiah, Danhul* &lt;Sjf* Meroui, (Sj^ Manoui, iSy} ^iri, Baloui, ^^1^^ Mesouahi, gjy-! Beherje, A ww L o Maseh Meshari, j ^ L wj O u ^ i Sedusan. There are Seidan, Meunoun, ^jl&gt;lLc Mult an, Heidour; names of cities in Sind and part of Hind. These, for the greater part, are inhabited by Infidels: but there are, in this country, some Mussulmans, who have mosques, and on stated days read the Khutbah: and the Indian sovereign who dwells here has a very extensive empire. u 2( '8 ) The city of Mansourah is about a mile in breadth, and as much in length; and a bay or arm of the river Mihran passes by it, and renders it like an island. The inhabitants of Mansoureh are of the descendants of (^1 Hehar ehn Alasoud. He took the place, and it continues till this time in the possession of his family. It enjoys a warm climate, and produces dates, apples, and pears, and a fruit resembling the peach : it is a place abound ing in provisions. Their coins are the Kaheri, every direm of which is equivalent to (or weighs) fifty direms; and another of silver, which they call Tautooi, one direm of which is fifty direms; they also use gold in their commercial in tercourse. Their dress and habits resemble those of the people of Irak ; but their kings affect the appearance of Indian kings, and wear pendants in their ears. The city of ^ Moultan is about half the size of Man soureh. It is called the ' Golden House;' for there is in the city a certain idol, to which the Indians of the country come as on a re ligious pilgrimage, every year, and bring great riches with them; and those who pray in the temple of this idol must pay a tribute. This temple is situated in the centre of Moultan ; and in the middle of the temple there is a great cupola or dome. All round this building are various houses, in which the servants and attendants of the idol reside. Moultan is not reckoned as belonging to Hin- doostan; but there is in it a race of idolaters.who worship in this temple. I he idol is made in the form of a man, with the feet( 140 ) on a bench, formed of tiles, or bricks and mortar: it is clothed in a red garment, resembling Morocco leather and no part of the body is to be seen except the two eyes. Some people say the body is made of wood; but they do not permit any one to see more of it than the eyes, which are composed of precious stones. On the head is a diadem of gold. It sits upon a square throne, the hands resting on the knees. All the riches which are brought to this idol from Hindoostan, are taken by the^xj Emir of Moultan, who distributes a portion among the servants of the temple. When the Indians come there in. a hostile manner, and endeavour to carry off the idol from them, the people of Moultan take it forth, and seem to make pre parations for breaking and burning it; when the Indians perceive that, they desist from fighting, and return back. If it were not for this circumstance, the Indians would destroy Moultan. There is here a castle, or citadel; but Mansoureh is more populous and improved. Moultan was styled the Beit Alzahah, or Golden House, because the Mussulmans were in great distress when they seized on this town, and found in it vast quantities of gold, and acquired power. About half a farsang from the town is a villa, in which resides the Emir of Moultan—on the appointed festivals he goes into the town—he is a Coreishi of the children of Sam the son of Noah, who conquered Moultan-;.( 150 ) and he is called the Emir of that place. He has not any power over Mansourah; but the Khutbah is read in the name of the Khalif. Besmeid is a small town. Besmeid, and Moultan, and Chendoar, are situated on the eastern side of the river of Moultan, each at the distance of one farsang from the bank of the river. The water used in these towns is well-water. Danhul is situated on the eastern side of the river Mihran, on the sea coast; it is the port of this country. In the cultivation of their lands, the inhabitants do not use water. It is a barren place; but people dwell there for the convenience of transacting mercantile business. (-)Bileroun is a town between Dambul and Mansoureh, on the west of the river Mihran; and Beherje, and Mesouai, and Sedousan, and HelheJi, are situated on the western side of the river Mihran. Audi and Daloui are both on the eastern side of it, at a distance from the river, in going from Mansoureh to Moultan. Baloui is situated on the banks of the river Mihran, near a bay, tormed by that river behind Mansoureh.

Nedeheh is a tract of flat land between Tour an, and Mekran, and Moultan, and the towns of Mansoureh. This territory lies on the west of the river Mihran. It is a place remarkable for camels. The chief town of this district is a place of much commerce; it is called ^J^jlcXo Kandahil. The men of this town resemble those of the desert; they have houses constructed of reeds, along the banks of the river Mihran, as far as the borders of Moultan, and to the sea side; and be tween Mihran and Famhel they have pasture lands and meadows. They are a numerous tribe. Famhel, and Sedousan, and Meimoun, and aj U a /' Keniaheh ; all four have mosques, in which the religious ceremonies of Islam are publickly performed: there are great quantities of the Indian wall-nut an( i of the fruit called j^ Mouz, with various kinds of herbs, and much honey. ^ j &amp;\ j Rahouh and are two districts between JoL«;1 Armaiel and Kair: both these are without water: they abound in cattle. Tour an is a little district, with many small villages and hamlets belonging to it. cX^J Ahmed hen Maamr( 152 ) possesses them, and the Khutbah is read in the Khalif's name. The town in which he resides is a considerable place, well supplied with provisions, and abounding in fruits; it is never subject to cold weather. Between &lt;X aj U&gt; Maniah and Famhel there is a desert; also between Famhel and Keniahah. Tasimoun is a populous district, in which the Mus sulmans and Indians are intermixed. In this place the only gar ment they wear is the^ljl azar, or sash round the middle, as the heat renders all others unnecessary: it is also the custom at Moultan. In the province of Makran they speak the Persian and Makrani languages. The merchants wear the cloak and turban. # Makran is an extensive country, but liable to scarcity and want of provisions. i ^ j Hosein hen Isa hen Maadan took possession of the district called I ^ Mihra, and dwelt in the town of yS' Knir, which is as large as Moul tan, and a good harbour: it has many date trees: in the territory of it is a well called the ' W ell of Makran.' It is the largest town in Makran. Ther6 is a district called Kherouje, the capital of which is L-Clwlj Rasek, and there is a village belonging to it called ^Lcj^.

Resasil and Kant ell are two large towns within two menzils: from Resasil to the sea is half a farsang. ^ xj I c X o Kandabil is a considerable city situated in the desert. Kirkanan is another large town in the desert. In the district of OoJ I Azend the Mussulmans and infidels are all intermixed. Here they have cattle and gardens.

F rom Bein to Kehr, five merhileh; from Kebr to Fetrioun, two merhileh; and if one goes from the road of Fetrioun, by the road of Makran, it is the same distance : from Fetrioun to Derek, three merhileh; from that to Asofkah, two merhileh; from that to cX^ Med, one mer hileh; from Med to y&amp;S Kesr, one merhileh; from Kebr( 155 ) Of the Rivers in this Country. # O f the (jljyc Mihran it is said that the source is the river ysfr?' Jihoan ; it comes out at Moultan, and passes on to the borders of Besmeid, and by Mansourah, and falls into the sea on the east of Dambul. The waters of the river Mihran are pleasant and wholesome; and they say it is liable to tides, or flux and reflux, like the Nile, and that it is infested by crocodiles. The JW m Sind Rud, at three merhilehfrom Moultan, is of pleasant water, and joins the river Mihran. Water is very scarce through out the land of Makran ; there is some near Mansoureh. Many of the inhabitants of Makran resemble the Arabs ; they eat fowl and fish: others of them are like the Curds. Here is the extreme boundary of the land of Islam in this direction. Now we shall turn back, and begin to describe Ar menia, and Aran, and Azerhaigan.^ bC-jljjol ^ ob' ^ ^ Description of Armenia, and Jran x and Azerbaijan. i % A ll the boundaries of these countries, Kouhestan on the east, and the banks of the Caspian Sea, and the provinces adjacent to ^c;l Armen, and Alan, and ^j\ Aran, and the mountains of O'bsTv 5 Kipchak*, and the borders of Irak and Jezireh, on the south ; all these boundaries we lay before the reader in the annexed map. (Blank page for a Map.J Ardehil is the most considerable city of Azerbaijan: it is about half a farsang in length and breadth, and contains the Governor 's palace : it has walls, and four gates, and is a pleasant town, and well supplied with provisions. It has extensive sub urbs ; and within two farsang of it there is a mountain called Seilan, which is never free from snow either in winter or summer. * oti-o Kihshak, according to the Arabian mode of expressing the Persian or Turkish letters Ba and Chim. wmmwmmmmmmmmmmmm( 157 ) Meraghah is nearly of the same size as Ardebil; in for mer times it was the seat of government: it has villages, and suburbs, orchards, and gardens, and land improved by agricul ture. The town had walls: but (^5^ &lt; ^ emo ' lished them. Armenia is an extensive and fertile region, bounded by the sea, and full of delightful situations: the towns are Misan, Khounah, ^ I j I Bervanan, Khoui, Sel- mas, Neshoui, cXi^c Marend, jjyJ Tabriz, OJj^j Beze- rend, Derhan, {^3^* JSIoukan, and Khabei an and several smaller towns. Berdaa is a populous and flourishing city, with culti vated lands and much fruit. After Rey and Isfahan, there is not in Irak or Khorasan a city more large, more beautiful, or pleasant, thai! Berdaa. At the distance of one farsang from Berdaa, between Kerieh, and Lesout, and near q LL xju Bektan, there is a well called uj I jc X j ! A fide rah ; and for one day's journey the whole country is laid out in gardens and orchards. The fruits are excellent; their filberds are better than those of c Samarcand, and their chesnuts oL^ ) superior to the chesnuts of Syria; and the figs of Berdaa are more delicious than those of any other place. There are also mulberries; and silk is sent fronv that to Khuzistan, and to Irak.( 158 ) In the river Kur they take fish of two kinds, Rafen and Aasher, which are better than any other fish. At the Curds Gate there is a market-place, or bazar, called ^fS Gurki : every Sunday the people assemble there: it is about a farsang square. Men from Khorasan and from Irak meet there. The Revenue Office is in the great mosque, and the bazars on the ramparts. Derhend is a city built on the shore of the sea, on two banks of a bay, with two walls constructed so as to render the navigation of ships more convenient and safe; and a chain is drawn across the entrance, that ships may not enter or sail out without permission; and these two walls are formed of stone and lead: and this town of Derbend is situated on the coast of the sea of Taheristan. It is larger than Ardebil, with many fields, and meadows, and cultivated lands. It does not pro duce much fruit; but the people supply that from other quarters. A wall of stone extends from the city to the mountain; and another of clay, .to hinder the o'/K' Cafres (Infidels) from coming into the town. Part of this wall projects a little way into the sea, so that ships may not come too near the ramparts. This wall is a strong building, and was the work of |J&lt;3lc Noushirvan Aadel (the Just.) This city ot Derbend is very large, and remarkable: it is sur*( 159 ) rounded by enemies, who have different languages. On one side of Derbend is a great mountain called Adeih; on this they assemble every year, and make many fires, that they may confound and disperse their enemies from the borders of Azerbaijan, and Armenia, and Arran : they are as numerous as the waves of the sea that come up to the walls of the city. It is said that this mountain, which is close to Derbend, contains above seventy dif ferent tribes, who have each a peculiar dialect, and understand not one the language of another. The sovereigns of Persia have considered the possession of this city as a matter of great importance, and have established a race of people to guard it, called Tairheran; and there is another tribe called Heilahshar, and another called Lekzan: there are also two other tribes, the ^Le- niran and Servan : the foot soldiers are mostly of these tribes; they have few horsemen. Derbend is the port-town for Khozr, and Serir, and ^ Gurkan, and Taheristan, and Kurge, and Kapchak ; and from it they send linen clothes to all parts of Aran and Azerbaijan. Here they also weave tapestry, or carpets, and cul tivate saffron. On the coast of this sea (the Caspian) is another town called Shaberan ; it is a small place, but pleasant and well( 100 ) supplied with provisions: it has many villages belonging to it. Above those is the village~of Jesmeden, as far as the borders of Shirvan, and vjAj Baku, and Den- tuk, and j-d Lekez; and in this village is a castle so very exten sive that all the cattle in the country may be secured in it, without any guards or centinels left to watch them. Tejlis is a smaller city than Derbend: it is a pleasant place, and abounds in provisions: it has two walls ot clay, and produces much fruit, and agriculture is practised in its territories. It has hot baths, in which, as at Tiberiah, the water is warm without fire. In all Aran there are not any cities more considerable than Berdaa, Derbend, and leflis. As for Bilkan, and j Rev an, and Berzenje, and Shamakhy, and Shaberan, and Shirvan, and Alenjaii, and &lt;*-Lo K.ahlah, and as : Kaujah, and Sheinkoiir , and Shct oils end, they are small towns, but pleasant and plentiful. JJut} Deinel is a larger city than Ardebil, and the chief town of Armenia; the palace of the governor is there, as at Berdaa, the capital of Aran. It has very wide and extraordinary ram parts. There are great numbers of Christians and Jews here; and the churches are interspersed among the mosques. Here they manufacture fine hangings, and carpets, and make the beautiful( 101 ) colour called hermez. I have heard that this kermez is a certain worm *, This place has heretofore been in the hands of Shenhat hen Ashout, and at all times has belonged to Christian princes; the greater number of the people of Armenia are Chri stians. Armenia is bordered on one side by Berdaa; on another bv the confines of Jezireh; on another by Azerbaijan, and Jebal, and Dilem, and Rey: the south side is bordered by the Seghour of Roum Trahzoun is situated on tlie extreme confines of Roum; it is much frequented by merchants. Mia- farekin and Serouah are small but pleasant towns. Of the Rivers and Lakes of this Country {and other Matters). T he most considerable rivers are the Kur, the Aras, and the Asfendrud, which is between Ardebil and * The Persian Dictionary, intituled Ferhang Borhan Kattea, informs us, that Kermez is the name of a substance with which they tinge or dye; and that it is said to be an insect gathered from certain shrubs, and afterwards dried ; and that the Arabians style it Dud-nl-Sehagheln, ' the Dyer's Worm.'( 162 ) 0 LCcj Zemgan. The waters of the river Kur are sweet and wholesome; it comes from the mountain of Auhileh y and goes on to the borders of Kenjah, and passes by Shemkour, and through the midst of Tejlis, and to the land of the Infidels. The river Aras has also pleasant waters; it comes from Armenia, and, falling into the river Rur, at the borders of jyioukcuif near 3/^7 /iitioucl cihcid,, falls into the sea. There is a lake in Azerbaijan called the Lake of Armia ( aa ^;1 : the water is salt or bitter, and contains not any living creature. All round this lake are villages and buildings : from the lake to Meraghah is a distance of three farsang; to Armi two farsang. The length of this lake is five days journey, by land; and by water, with a fair wind, a person may traverse it in the space of one nights In Armenia there is a lake near Arjeis ; in it are great numbers of the fish Teraa, which they send to all quarters. The Sea, of Khozr is also on this border. Derbend and Baku are situated on it. Naphta is found at Baku. A small part of the river Tigris Dejleh) runs on the confines of Armenia. The 'borders of Azerbaijan extend from Tar em to Zingan, to Deinel, and Holwan, andtojjjjy&amp; Shehrzour, to the river Dejleh, and back to the borders of Ar menia. All the necessaries of life are very cheap in this country:( iOS ) in it are places where they sell sheep for two direms, and a munn of corn for one direm. There are powerful princes in this region: such as o U j Shirvan Shah, and others. All this country belongs to the cold climate. The stone of Ardebil weighs twelve hundred direms. Through out this country the Persian and Arabian languages are understood. The inhabitants of Ardebil use also the Armenian tongue; in the mountainous country belonging to Berdaa, the people use a dif ferent dialect. In Azerbaijan, and Aran, and Armenia, gold and silver coins are current. Of the Distances of Places in this Country.

Description of Kouhestan, that is, Irak Agemi. O n the east of Kouhestan are the deserts of Khorasan, and part of Fars, and Isfahan, and the eastern side of Khuzistan. On the west of Kouhestan lies the province of Azerbaijan.' On the north is Deilman, and Cazvin, and Rey, and Mardein. These towns, Rey, and Cazvin, and ^j\ Abher, and Zengan, we have not placed in the map as belonging to Kouhestan; we rather assign them to the province of Deilman, because it winds irregularly along Kouhestan.

Hamadan is a considerable city, of about one farsang in lengtii and breadth. It has four iron gates: the buildings are of clay. It abounds in gardens and orchards. Deinour is not quite so large as Hamadan. Both places have mosques. Ispahan is* the most flourishing of all the cities in Kouhestan, and possesses more riches than all the other places; and it is the pass between Kouhestan, and Pars, and Khorasan, and Khuzistan. The garments of silk (^ a ^ j I), and fine linen of this place, are carried to all parts of the empire, as well as the fruits. Kurreh is a town of scattered houses : it is called Kur reh of Budulph ^c&gt;y&gt; his children resided there till the time that they ceased to govern; but the ruins of their villas and palaces still remain. This place abounds in cattle; and the land * z( 170 ) about it is well cultivated. Fruit is brought to it from Werdgird. It is a long town, about one farsang in length. It has two bazars; one near the gate of the chief mosque. Between the two bazars the distance is considerable. Werdgird is an extensive and flourishing city: its length is two farsang. Saffron is cultivated here. Nehavend is situated on a hill. It has many pleasant gardens and orchards, with excellent fruits, and two mosques; one modern, the other ancient. Saffron also comes from Neha vend. ^ jj [ j Rud Rawer is a village, and there is a small town which they call ^ cO Kurreh Rud Rawer, It is a well-inhabited, plentiful, and pleasant place, where saffron is cultivated in greater quantities, and of a better kind, than any where else: it is therefore sent from this place to all parts. Hulwan is a town of these mountains. All its walls are of clay and stone. Its air is warm ; and here are many fig- trees. Semireh, and Siruan, have both a hot and cold temperature; and running water flows among the houses of these places. mm( m ) Shehrzour is a small town, which the Curds have seized on ; also the town c3j Shehrwerd : these two places are in the hands of the Curds. / Shehrwerd is a place of which the inhabitants are mostly Curds and notorious robbers and plunderers. Saul the king of the Children of Israel, was of this place. Casvin is a great city, with walls and a castle, and running water just enough for the people to drink; but the gar dens, and meadows, and orchards, are well watered. This place affords much almonds, and the fruit called )^ Mawz ; and here they weave excellent camelot, or stuffs made of the under or woolly hair of goats. J j Kom has not any walls, and the inhabitants drink well- water. In spring and summer a great river runs by the gate of this city. In all Irak, date trees are not to be found, except at Semirah, and Sirvan, and Saber Khast, where there are a few: and the people of Kom and Kashan are all of the Shiah sect, and originally from Arabia. Kashan is a small town. Here are great numbers of black scorpions, who kill, and another species called heirarah.( 172 ) In all Kouhistan there is not any sea, or great laker it is all a hilly country, except from Hamadan to Rey, or Kom„ where the hilk are fewer, and less considerable. From Shehrzour to Hulwan, to Semireh, to ^ lj^ Sir van, to Lour, to the vicinity of Isfahan, and the borders of Saber Khast, and from that in the direction of Kashan and Hamadan, to Shehrzour and the borders of Azerbaijan, it is all a mountainous country, and there is not any spot trom which the hills may not be seen. Rey, which we haye mentioned, on the confines of Deilman Oui/j, is equally belonging to Jehal and Kho- rassan ; and after Baghdad, there is not any city of the east larger or more flourishing than it, except Nishapour. Among the mountains of this country, the principal is Duma- vend from which one can see fifty farsang around, and I have never heard that any man ever ascended to its summit; and, in the romances of the Persians ' lt ' ls said that Zohak is confined in chains within this mountain. And the mountain of Bisetoun is likewise very lofty and dif ficult of ascent; the face of the mountain you would suppose to be carved, or hewn out; and they say there was a certain king who wished to make a summer house, or palace, of this moun-( 173 ) tain, in order to display his power to the people u And at the back of this mountain, on the side of the road, there is a cavern, or grotto, from which a fountain of water issues forth ; and there they have carved the statue of a horse, and the figure of a giant sitting on its back f The mountain of Seilan is greater than that of Da- mavend; and here is a race of people who practise a kind of magism, or fire-worship )• It is said that the mountain of Jerth is called in Persian ojS Maset Kouh, and is larger than all the others, I have not heard that there are in Kouhestan any mines of gold or silver.

T he southern borders of Deilman are -ji Cazvin, and Tarem, and part of Azerbaijan, and part of Rey. On the north it has the Caspian Sea (jjz*. or Sea of Khozr. On the west, part of Azerbaijan, and the towns of that country. On the east are the mountains of Rey, and the hills of Karen, and -J Gurkan, and the Caspian sea. The region of Deilman is partly mountainous, and partly flat; the level tract is that of Gilan, on the borders of the Caspian sea, under the mountains of Deilman. The sovereign ( o L^&lt;31 j ) of Deilman resides at Rudbar. This territory is covered for the greater part with forests and woods. Taheristan is aflat country, and well cultivated; here they breed much cattle; and they have a peculiar dialect, neither Arabick nor Persian; and in many parts of Deilman their language is not understood. Until the time of Ooj ^ Hair he?! Zeid (may God reward him!), the inhabitants of Taberistan, and of Deilman were Infidels b ): then many of them became Mussulmans; but it is said that in the mountains of Deilman some ot them still continue to practise the rites of Paganism.( 175 ) The mountains of Karen are difficult of access, and very strong i in every hill there is a chief. Here are lofty trees, and forests, and streams, but no towns except Shehmar. To Sarein* (or (Sj^ —^ Sari) one merhileh. This was the residence of Karen, who was their king ( c ^ j ) ; and the seat of government, and the place where the treasures were deposited. From the mountains of Bardestan to Sari, is one merhileh. From the borders of Deilman, and the coast of the sea, to I Jsterahad, is one day's journey; it is not more. The district of Rey is adjoining to Cazvin. Ebher, and &lt;^150; Rengan, and Talekan, and ^ Kesr al radein, are in these territories; and Koumes, and Semnan, and Damghan, and Bustam, are all connected one with another. And J^l Amol, and Melil, and Salous, and Kellar, and Rouban, and a L^ o Mesleh, and Aien alhem ^ 1 an d Memta, and Sari, and Mehrwan, and Almerasek, and Bemi- sheh, are reckoned as belonging to Taberistan. * I have before remarked the extreme obscurity and inaccuracy of several passages in this work.

Ahis- goun, and Dehestan, to ^ ^Gurkan ; and in the mountains I know not of any towns, besides Semnan, and Kouim ; and those belong to ^ j[3 Karen Kouh. The most considerable city of those we have mentioned is Rey. After Baghdad there is not in the eastern regions any city more flourishing. Its gates are much celebrated: one of them is called the (^UoU oj \jjDerivazeh Natan, facing the moun tainous country, or the Kouhestan of Irak; another leads to Cazvin : another, called the DerwazeJi Gurhek, is in the direction of ^5 Kom. And there are many remarkable streets and quarters in this city ; such as oO 4j Rudeh, and Kelisan, and jj Dehek Nou, and Oljl Nasrahad, and Sarhanan, and Bah al ^ 11 Jehal ^'L^sz ' L-jlj or the Mountain Gate; and the Der-i-Hesham, or Hesham's Gate; and the Der-i- Ahenin, or the Iron Gate; and the gate called Der-i- Ithah ; but the quarter of Rudah is the most populous and flour ishing of all. In this place are many bazars, and caravanseras, and market places. In the suburbs there is a mosque. The citadel is in good re pair, and there is a wall round the suburbs, which is, however, fal ling to decay, and almost desolate. Here they have both river water W , -( 177- ) and water brought by canals or trenches: one of these is called the ¥ Kareiz Shahl, or Royal Aqueduct; it passes by Sarbanan: another, called Gilani, also passes through 8arbanan. For the most part the inhabitants drink the water of these aqueducts. There are many canals besides. Here they cul tivate the land, and practise husbandry, and traffick for gold and direms. The people of this place are hospitable and polite. Here they manufacture fine linen, cotton, and camelots, which are sent to all parts of the world, Khar is a small town, supplied with water by a river which runs from Damavend. Dehmeh*, and Shelineh, are two towns belonging to the territories of Damavend; they are smaller than Khar. Dehmeh is larger than Shelineh; it abounds in cultivated fields, gardens, and orchards, and fruits. There is not any place in the whole country of a more cool temperature. In the territory of Rey there are villages larger than those towns; such as Vameiz, and Arinou, and DBrsBin, and Dsrci, and KousBiri, and Scist, and Khosru, and others: and I have heard that in every one of these villages there are two thousand inhabitants or more. * Or **£&gt;2 Wehmeh.( 178 ) . From the territory of Rey, cotton and linen clothes are sent to Baghdad, and into Azerbaijan; and in those places which we have spoken of, there is not any navigable river: a stream flows from the summit of Damavend; and all round this mountain are considerable villages, such as Dehiran, and Der- meyah. Of this place was i^ j hen Sherouin, who was taken prisoner on the banks of the river Jihoun. The mountain of Damavend is the most eastern of all the mountains in Taberistan, and may be seen from all parts of the country: they call it cylsl*, because that on it there are not many trees. But Kournes belongs to Damavend; Dam- ghan is larger than Khar of Rey; Sernnan is smaller than Damghan ; and Bustam is smaller than Dam- ghan : it is remarkable for excellent fruit. Cazvln has two suburbs, with walls. The chief mosque is situated in the great suburbs. Here are two small ca nals or aqueducts, of which the water is used for drinking, and for the purposes of agriculture; yet, with this scarcity of water, the city is pleasant, and abounds in provisions: It is the pass into t Or( 170 ) Deilman; and there are constant quarrels between the people of these places. It produces fruits, such as grapes and almonds, &amp;c. so plentifully that they are carried to other parts of the coun try. This city is one mile by one mile. ^jl Ahher and Kjj Zengan are two small, but pleasant and well supplied towns; of which Zengan is the larger : but its inhabitants are idle and not industrious. Tabaristan is a considerable province. The build ings in it are of wood and reeds. It adjoins (jjjl Aran. Sari is larger than Cazvin, well inhabited, and supplied with provisions. Silk is produced in great quantities throughout all quarters of Tabaristan; it is sent, for the greater part, to Arnol. The people of Tabaristan have very thick and long hair, with heavy eye-brows ; they speak very fast, and their usual diet is bread made of rice; they eat much fish, rice, and milk : they manufacture'garments of silk and wool. In all Tabaristan there is not a river on which boats can be employed; but the sea is near. ^ ^y Gurkan is a small place, less liable to rain and damps than Tabaristan. The people of Gurkan are amiable in their dis positions, of a generous and manly nature. Without the city is a piece of ground called Bekrahad, through which runs a( 180 ) considerable stream; it produces much silk. This district is very well watered and cultivated : after you pass Irak, no spot is more abundant than Gurkan : it yields the fruits both of warm and cold climates ; and snow is to be found even in summer. Many eminent men have come from this country. Dinars and direms are current in Tabaristan; and the vniui ot that land is six hundred direms.. Aster ah ad is situated near the Caspian Sea; from that you ^o to Ahis^oua, and by the sea to , and Derhend, and Deilman, and other places : in all this country there is not any port or harbour more commo dious or larger than Abisgoun.

Jj^ CSM Of the Sea of Khozr, or the Caspian. ' T he western side of this Sea belongs partly to Deilman, and Taberistan, and ^ Gurkan, and its borders; and part of it is bordered by the deserts of Khuarezm. On the western side is Aran, and Moukan, and{ 184 ) the territories of Serir, and part of the deserts of Azziah : and on the north it has the desert of Azziah, to the ter ritories of ojS oLuw Sidh K^ouh; and on the south, Bakeil, and Deilman, and the neighbouring places. This sea is not connected with any other; and if a person wishes to make a tour completely round it, nothing will impede him but a few rivers which fall into it from various quarters. The waters of this sea are bitter and dark-coloured ; its bottom is a blackish clay, differing in this respect from the Sea of ^ Kolzum, or of i y Oman, or of Pars. This Sea of Pars is of such clear water that one may see the white stones at the bottom ; but the waters of this Sea of Khozr are dark-coloured, and in it there are not found any such things as pearls, or coral, or similar marine productions. It is, however, much frequented by the ships of merchants who traffick from one town to another; and it affords much fishing. In this ocean there are not any inhabited islands, as in the Sea of Fars and of Roum ; but there are many trees and forests f Blank Page for a Map of the Caspian Sea.J It is not clear whether those trees occupy the islands of this sea, or fkirt its borders.( '85 ) One island is considerable, with a fountain of water and many trees; and there is another large island on the borders of Lekzan, which has also fresh water. To this island they bring cattle from Berdaa in boats, and turn them out to graze, and leave them until they become fat. Near Ahisgoun is a place called Dehestan, with very sweet and wholesome water. Here the people of the neighbouring places assemble for the purpose of fishing. It is said that there is a race of Turks (o ) dwelling in the vicinity of o L wj Siah Kouh (or the black mountain.) After one passes i ^ j JMoukctTi to Derhend, for two days journey the country is^lj^Aji, Shir wan; from that to Semender, fourteen days journey; and from Semender to \ i j • m (J^jl Atel. This Atel is a certain river which comes from Rous and Bulgar. One half of this river belongs to the western side, the other to the eastern. The sovereign of Atel resides on the western side : he is styled King, and surnamed Jlj Baul. Here are many tents; and in this country there are but a few edifices of clay, such as bazars (market-places) and bathing houses. In these territories are about ten thousand Mussulmans. The king's habitation is at a distance from the shore; it is con structed of burnt bricks; and this is the only building of such materials in all the country: they will not allow any body but the king to erect such a dwelling. B B( 186 ) The city of Joi Atel has four gates. One of those gates faces the river; another looks towards Iran, in the direction of the desert. The king of this country is a Jew: he has in his train four thousand Mussulmans, and KI lozt ians (Chris tians), and Idolaters; but his principal people are Jews : And this king has twelve thousand soldiers in his service, of whom when one dies, another person is immediately chosen into his place; and they have no other commander but him. And this king has under him nine magistrates or judges : these are Mussul mans, Jews, Christians, and Idolaters. The smallest in number of the inhabitants of this country are the Jews; the greatest in num ber are the Mussulmans and Christians: but the king and his chief officers are Jews. There are magistrates of each religion; and when they sit in the tribunal of justice, they are obliged to report to the king all that passes, and to bring back his answer and opinion, and put his sentence into execution. This city has not any suburbs; but the cultivated fields and grounds extend for near twenty farsang. Agriculture is much practised, and the husbandmen carry the produce of their labour in boats and carriages to the city. The chief diet of this people is fish and rice: they bring honey and wax from the borders of ^ Rous. The principal persons of Atel are Mussulmans and merchants: their language is like that of the Turks or Tar tars), and is not understood by any other nation.46 lectin,( '' : 'variam ((^ e '' ews: Anil 'f Whotl S:,-, 1 into his ^nd this kin^ ■hese areMussi ■lest in numberoi greatest in mm- the king and lis if each religion; F are obliged te 3ack his answe: ivated fields a iculiure is nrnct e of their late lietof thispeoplf jn the borders c( : Mussulmans d irb ( n. ( 187 ) The river of Atel comes from the borders of Jerjir, and from that goes on to l J Kaimak, and to jt Ghuz, and so on to Bui gar, and falls into the sea near Ber- tas. It is said that this river, at the season when all its waters are collected, is greater than the river ^Jihoon ; and that it rushes into the sea with such a body that it seems to conquer the water of the Caspian; and one can see its stream unmixed with the sea water, as far as a journey of two days. Injjz* Khozr there is a certain city called cXx^l As mid, which has so many orchards and gardens, that from Derbend to Serir the whole country is covered with the gardens and plantations belonging to this city. It is said that there are above forty thousand of them. Many of these produce grapes. In this town are many Mussulmans, who have mosques; and their houses are built of wood. The king is a Jew, in friend- i ship with the Padshah of Khozr, and on good terms with the Padshah of yyw Serir. From this place to the borders of Serir, is two farsang. The inhabitants of Serir are Ly Tersas or Christians. It is said that in this Serir was a throne, and that there was a certain king of the kings of Pars, who, when he gave a principality to one of his sons, sent him here with a golden throne; which principality has continued established to this time. A son of Behram Chopin is b b 2 /( 188 ) said to have first possessed it * The inhabitants of Serir are on good terms with the Mussulmans. In this part of Khozr I know not of any other town than (before written Asmid.) Bertas is a people near Khozr, on the banks of the river of Jol Jtel They are called ; but the region is also styled in general jjz*. Khozr, Rous, or Serir. The people of Khozr are near the Turks whom they resemble. They are of two classes; one of blackish complexions, and such dark hair that you would suppose them to be descended from the Hindoos: the other race fair complexioned; these sell their children; but it is not allowed among the Jews and the Christians to sell, or make one another slaves. They bring from other countries those commodities which Khozr does not produce, such as tapestry or curtains, honey, candles, and similar articles. The people of Khozr have not ma terials for making garments or clothes: they therefore import them from Gurkan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Roum. Their king is styled the Khacan of K/iozr. * Behram Chopin is said to have flourifhed in the latter end of the sixth century of the Christian aera. See D'H erbelot's Bibl. Orient. Art. Baharam and Serir.k „ f „ . ( 189 ) rf ^ 0zr j ^ When a prince is to be raised to the Khacanship, they bring ^ e f ore him forth, and tie a piece of silk about his throat, so tight that he can scarcely draw his breath. At that moment they ask him, how long he will hold the sovereignty ? He answers, ' so many years.' He then is set at liberty, and becomes Khacan of Khozr. But if he should not die before the expiration of the time he mentioned, when that space is fulfilled, they put him to death. banks but the or Serir. ^j i )) whom tb ush complexion i to be descends The Khacan must be always of the Imperial race. No one is allowed to approach him but on business of importance : then they prostrate themselves before him, and rub their faces on the ground, until he gives orders for their approaching him, and Mied; these sel speaking. When a Khacan of Khozr dies, whoever passes near he Jews and tk his tomb must go on foot, and pay his respects at the grave ; and when he is departing, must not mount on horseback, as long as the tomb is within view. % modities whicl - • curtains, I ioif , So absolute is the authority of this sovereign, and so implicitly ozr have not i- are his commands obeyed, that if it seemed expedient to him that therefore import one of his nobles should die, and it he said to him, ' Go and kill ijan, and R oe yourself,' the man would immediately go to his house, and kill himself accordingly. The succession to the Khacanship being thus established in the same family; when the turn of the inhe ritance arrives to any individual of it, he is confirmed in the dig- ihmm and ^ nity, though he possesses not a single dirhem. And I have heard from persons worthy of belief, that a certain young man used to 11 f Khozr. 1 of the sixth ceor^i( 190 ) ^ sit in a little shop at the public market-place, selling petty articles; and that the people used to say, ' When the present Khacan shall have departed, this man will succeed to the throne.' But the young man was a Mussulman, and they give the Khacan- ship only to Jews. y The Rhacan has a throne and pavilion of gold: these are not allowed to any other person. The palace of the Khacan is loftier than the other edifices. In the district of Bcrtas the houses are built of wood. The people are of two tribes or classes; one near the extreme con fines of it Ghuz, near Bulgar, about two thousand in number, under the dominion of the Bulgarians; the other next the Turks. The language of Bulgar and of Khozr is the same. Bulgar is the name of a city, where there are Mussulmans and mosques; and near Bulgar is another town called *, where there are also Mussulmans and mosques. In these two cities there are about ten thousand inhabitants. Here the length of a summer's night is such that a man cannot go more than the distance of one farsang—rather, not so much; and in winter the day is equally short as the night in summer. * Doubtful in the Eton MS. and mine.■ ce ' » ^tothetlron- 'S ive theRk,. ^ '• these j e Khacan is t of wood. | the extreme ci two thousand e the other next tli )zr is the sm Mussulmans a®: isand intiaDH that a man car •her, not so nm rht in summer. ( iei ) Of the (j*jj Rous, there are three races or tribes: one near Bulgar; their king dwells in a town called ^ AjjS * : this is larger than Bulgar. Another race is called ^jUj! Orthani or Ar- thai; their king resides in a place called Uj! Artha: but the other tribe, cdlXed. Jellaheh, is superior to those; but no one goes for the purposes of traffick farther than Bulgar. No one goes to Ujl Artha, because that there they put to death any stranger whom they find. Artha produces lead and tin, and the animal called (oL^wj^. v ^) Black Martin or Scythian Sable. The Russes burn their dead; and it is an established rule amongst them not to shave one another's beards. Bulgar is next to Roum. It is a powerful and numerous people, for the greater part Christians. Of the Roads and Stages of Khozr.

But this desert of Khorasan is almost totally unin habited and waste. To the north it has Khorasan and part of Seiestan; to the west it borders on Koumis, iSj Rey&gt; and p Kom, and Kashan. This desert is the haunt of robbers and thieves, and without a guide it is very difficult to find the way through it; and one can only go by the well-known paths. The robbers abound in this desert, because it is situated on the confines of so many dif ferent provinces. Part of this desert belongs to Khorasan, part of it to Sejestan; parts also to Fars, Kirman, Isfahan, Kom, Kashan, Rey, and the borders of Koumis, and its vicinity. J fMap of the Deserts between Fars and Khorasan.J One of the mountains in this desert is called Karges Kouh, with its four sides towards the desert. The circumference of this mountain is not more than two farsang : in the middle of this mountain there is a spring called ocXo lJT Auh Beideh. c c( 104 ) f-Mfr 0 y oU^ Siah Kouh, or the Black Mountain, belongs to the province of Jcbal. In this desert are some springs; but I never heard ot any towns, except, perhaps, one little city ot Rirman, on the road to Seiestan. In this desert, on the road from Isfahan to isishapour, there is a place called Jurmeh. On the confines of this desert are some well-known towns: on the borders of Pars, Mabin 01 Ma- hin Yezd, oOJls . Akedeh, Ardistan ol Isfahan; and on the Kirman side, Khuheis, and (Sjj J Ruzi, and Bermashir. On the borders ot Kuhestaa are Kom, Kashan, and ojJ Durreh : so on to the bor ders of Rey and of Khar, also Sc/tuiun, and Damghan, on the borders of (j^cy Koumes. ■ The principal roads through this desert are those from Isfahan to Rey, from Kirman to Sejestan, from Fars and Kirman to Khorasan; the road of Yezd, on the borders of Fars; the road of (Sjjj R uzi ' and Khuheiz, and another called or the new road from Khorasan into Kirman. 1 hese are the best known roads. * Obscure.( 190 ) one merhileh ;—desert.

From Zadakheret (before jjzL \ c &gt;\ j ) to Beisha Daran, one merhileh: this is a village containing three hundred inhabitants ; they have water in trenches or ditches, and cultivate their lands. From Beisha Daran to another village, - XjCs Dhey Digur (per haps a proper name), one merhileh : this is a well cultivated and \ inhabited place, containing about five hundred persons, who are husbandmen ; here they have running water. Hence to Bernar- aduieh AjjOyfjUy, one merhileh. At this stage is a caravansera with a well; but there are not any inhabitants. From this to Rebat Zingy, one merhileh : at this Rebat are three or four persons; there is also running water. From Rebat Zingy to Astelesht-, here is a reservoir of rain-water, also a caravansera, but without any inhabitants. From Astelesht to Berir, one merhileh: this Berir is on the borders of Lest, belonging to Nishapour : at two farsang of this stage they have erected khans (inns), and reservoirs of water; and the roads of this desert are here men tioned together, viz. the road of Isfahan ; then the road of Rey; then the road of Mabin; then the road of Khorasan; then that of Shour; then the road of Khebeis; and after that the road called rah nuh (new road), which is that of Kirman. d d( 202 ) olj The New Road, F rom Bermasir to Resnan, one merhileh: here are date trees. From this, passing into the desert, no build ings appear. Thence to GheslwieJi Sit ah (a spring of clear water), one merhileh. From that to the village of Salm, ^ four merhileh of desert; they say this village belongs to Kirman: thence to Herat, two days journey (olj But the road of Seistan is this: From Bermasir to ^ Basekh, on the borders of Kirman, five days journey. From Besekh to Seiestan, seven merhileh, which appears from the map of Seiestan and Kirman. (Blank page for the Map.)( 203 ) Account of Seiestan or Sejestan. The east of Seiestan is bounded by the desert of Makran, and of the land of Sind cX-Lw and partly by the territories of (^UJ Multan. To the west it has Khorasan and part of the territories of Hind: To the north it has Hindoostan; it is bounded on the south by the deserts of Seiestan and Kirman. Zarinje is fortified, and has a castle, with walls and ditches: the water which supplies these ditches, springs up in them ; and it has other supplies of water. It has also five gates. One gate is called jO Deri Alien (iron gate) ; another, the Dervazeh Kohen : a road passes through each of these gates. The third gate is that of Gurkouneh, on the Khorasan road. The fourth, called Der Beleski, (perhaps for Bosti) leads to C^ j Bost: this is the most frequented of any of these gates. All these have gates of iron. The fortifications have thirteen gates: one called Uyycj ojl Dervazeh Remind, or Meina, which leads to Pars; another, the bO oj Uj eS Dervazeh Gurkan; the third, Dervazeh Ashirek ; the fourth, Deri San; the d d 2C 204 ) fifth, ojt \jjDeruazeh Shaieh; the sixth, Der/ Khouiek ; the seventh, b _jC&gt; Deri Kav ; the eighth, Deri Belhihi, or Beliski; the ninth, Dervazeh Taarn ; the tenth, is Deri Aireis ; the eleventh, jC&gt; Deri Jnjoueh; the twelfth, (^U^» Dervazeh Restan; the thirteenth, is the Deri Zin- gian. All these gates are built of earth or clay, because wood becomes rotten, and decays. Here is a mosque, situated without the Dervazeh Pars. The Governor's palace is situated between the ^.LxL ojl jjC&gt; Derwa- zeh Taam and Dervazeh Pars. ^ Between these two gates, also, is a lodge or dwelling, erected by C ax J {^ j Yacouh hen Leith; and the Governor's pa lace is one of those which belonged to Omru hen Leith. Near the Der Gurkouneh, and the Dervazeh Biseky, there is a large building, which was the treasury of Omru ben Leith. The bazars of the town are situated about the mesjed or mosque: they are ample, and well supplied; as are those of the citadel, one of which was built by order of Yacoub ben Leith, who also be queathed a legacy to the mosque, and another to an infirmary or hospital for the sick. And from this bazar there is a daily revenue of a thousand direms.( 205 ) In this city are streams of running water: one passes by the Dervazeh Kohen ; another by the Dervazeh Nu; and another by the gate of Taam : where these three meet together, they turn a mill. Near the mosque is a large reservoir of water ; from which a stream flows, and enters the gardens belonging to the principal houses. The greatest number of houses are about the suburbs ; the citadel, however, has its gardens and running streams. Some land in the vicinity of this city is barren and sandy. The air is very warm. Here they have dates: there are no hills. In winter there is no snow : in general there is a wind, and they have windmills accordingly. Between Kirman and Seiestan there are some considerable buildings, the remains, it is said, of the antient city called Ram Shehristan; and they say the river of Seiestan runs through this place. The city of Zerenje was built by men originally of this Ram Shehr. Of the Rivers of this Country (Sejestan.j! T he most considerable river of Sejestan is called the £&gt; jj cXvc,^ Rudi Heirmend, which comes from jjt Ghaur to( 20 (5 ) the city of Bost, and from that runs to Sejestan, to the lake ZareJi qjJ (^I j j O. This lake is very small, when the waters of the river are not copious; when the river is full, the lake increases accordingly. The length of this lake is about thirty farsang from the quarter of Gouid, on the Kouhistan road ), to the bridge of Kirman [JJ-?.' on the road of Pars. In breadth this lake is about one merhileh. Its waters are sweet and wholesome, and afford abundance of fish. All about this lake are situated villages and small towns, except ing on that side next the desert, where there are not any habita tions or buildings. The Heir mend is a large river, and goes one stage from Seistan. There are some other streams, as that which runs to Lesker ; another called &lt;3^ Sehirud or Seihud ; and another called C&gt;jj o^Lyjo Siareh Rud, or Sibareh: and in the seasons that these streams are full, boats come down the Heirmund from Bost to Seistan; and the rivers of Seistan all proceed from the oj U aw Siareh Rud. There is another stream called Rud Shaahek, which affords water to thirty different villages. There is another river here, called Rud Meila, which is said to fall into the lake Zareh. On the road to Ck&gt;^j Bost, over this river, they have constructed a bridge of boats, like those bridges which are in Irak. Ot the streams which tall into the lake Zareh. one■■bbhhhhhhhhi^HHHBHBHHIHI ( 207 ) is the J^clc Ajj Rud Jamil, which comes from the low grounds of o^s Fereh ; and Rudi Seh, which comes out of jjt Ghaur : its waters are almost consumed in passing through the land; but what remains of it falls into the Zareh * # lake. Sejestan is a fertile and fine country: it produces dates in abundance. Most of the inhabitants are wealthy and opulent. In the district called ^rj Reheje, they apply themselves very much to farming and husbandry. In this district are the towns of Jo Tell, and Darghes, on the banks of the 1 . Heirmend ; and Toghahi, and Khilje, and fcT Kabul, .and jjt Ghaur, are of the colder climate. The Khiljians are of a Turkish b'J Tartar) race, who, in ancient times, settled in this country, between Hindoostan and the borders of Sejestan. They resemble the Turks or Tartars in personal appearance, and retain the dress and customs of that na tion ; and all speak the Turkish language. Bost is one of the principal cities in the province of Se jestan ; except Zirenje, no city is larger than it. The in habitants of Bost are polite and generous, resembling, in dress and manners, the people of Irak. It is a city well supplied with provisions, fruits, and dates: they trade from this city with Hindoostan,( 208 ) Ghaznein is a small city, one merhileh from Seiestan. From the vicinity of this place came the * Sqffarians, who conquered Pars, Sejestan, Khorasan, and Kirman: they were four brothers, L- j ^ julj Ya- couh, Omru, Taker, and AU, the sons of Leith. Taher was killed at the gates of Bost. Yacoub died at his return from Bagh dad, and his tomb is at Nishapour. Ali spent some time in {j Gurhan; then settled in DeJiestan. Yacoub, it is said, had originally been the servant of a coppersmith; and Omru, a camel-driver. IVmA: is a smalltown near Bost: it has a suburb, or neighbouring village, which supplies fruits and grapes for all parts of Seiestan : it has also reservoirs of water, oy Fereh is a large town. In the neighbouring villages there is much farming car ried on; and there, also, are dates in great abundance. Daver, and ^UULL Talecan, are at two menzils distance from them : they are small towns near Firouzmend, with running water and cultivated grounds. For anecdotes of this extraordinary family, see the Bibliotheque Onentale of D'Herbeiot, articles Soffarian, and Leith, &amp;c.■HHMHHHjHHHHHHHHHHIBiSHSISBI ( 209 ) o Distances and Stages of Sejestan. The first merhileh from Sejestan to Herat is called Gurkouneh, three farsang. From Gurkouneh to ^ Peir, four farsang: thence to Herir, one merhileh: thence to the bridge of the river of oJs Fereh, one merhileh; and from the bridge to Fereh, one merhileh : from Dereh to Kou~ san, one merhileh: this is the boundary of Sejestan. From Kou- san to Asferan, one merhileh : from Asferar to Kariz, one merhileh: from Kariz to Siah Kouh, one merhileh. J' Road from Sejestan to Bost. The first merhileh of this way is called Resouk : to Serur, one merhileh; to the Dhey Herari, one merhileh. A narrow river perhaps the river's name) crosses this road: over it there is a bridge constructed of brick. From this bridge ofHerurito Rebat Dhehek one menzil: thence e e( 212 ) hileh; and this Farreh is opposite Kurneen or wy Kerhin, near the desert. O'tL Tank is on the road of Gouir. From Bost to Sirvan ' two mer hileh; on the road of j \ jCS Duar, cross the river Heirmend, one merhileh: thence to Durghesh, one day's journey : from Naas to ^ ^ Hejrai, about one farsang; from rai to (^r\^r x ^ ] Asfjai, three merhileh. Now we proceed to describe the region of Khorasan. Account of the Province of Khorasan, K horasan , on the east, is bounded by part of Sejestan and Hindoostap; because all that lies beyond Ghaur may be esteemed in Hindoostan. To the west lie the desert of Ghazneh, and the borders of ^ J Gurkan. To the north of Khorasan, _^UJIjjLo Maweralnahr, and some towns of Turkestan. To the south the deserts of Fars and Koumis, part of which extends towards the borders of ^Gurkan, Ta- laristan, Rey, and the hills of Dilem, Now it is time to exhibit a Map of Khorasan, and to describe its various divisions.N. ( 213 ) (Blank Page for the Map.J From the borders of Kirman to the coast of the Caspian and to the boundary of Khuarezm is all well inhabited, and cultivated, and fertile. . llIM The cities of chief note in Khorasan are these four : Meru, and ^ Balkh, andj Nishapour, and HI ^ Herat. The others belong to the various Kourehs or districts; as Kuhestan, Nesa, and Sarkhes, and Asferin, and y Boushek, and Barghis, and ^ Kunjelleshak, and Meru-al-roud, and^lj^SjjJ' Gour- kanan, and Ghurjestan, and Bamian, and Tokharestan, and Zam, and J^T Amol. We speak Khuarezm, as belonging to Mawer- alnahr, or Transoxania. The city of Nishapour is situated on a level ground, and extends one farsang in every direction: the buildings are of clay. There are two considerable suburbs, well inhabited, with mosques. Here is a place which they call Leshkur gah and the go- * Station of the army.( 214 ) vernor's palace is situated in the \CK* r c Meidan Hosein, near which is also the prison. The governor's palace was built by order of Omru ben Leith. There are four gates. One is called Der-i-poul ; ano ther, \ jj Derwazeh Goui Mo as el ; the third is called JcXxyjj Der-i-Kohendez; and the fourth, Derwazeh poul Nekein ^U j oj'jjO. Kohendez is without the sub urbs. The gate which leads toward Balkh and Maweralnahr is called Derwazeh Khehuk ; and the gate towards Gurkan and Irak is called Der- wazeh Ishah. On the road leading to Pars and Kuhestan there is a gate called oj! Derwazeh Seirpes. In the suburbs are two market places, or bazars, and fountains of water. The city of Nishapour is watered by a subterraneous stream, which is conveyed to the fields and gardens, and falls into cisterns and reservoirs without the town ; and there is a considerable stream, that waters the city and villages about it: this stream is called UL k ) Seka. In all the province of Khorasan there is not any city larger than Nishapour, nor any blessed with a more pure and temperate air. Here they make garments of silk and fine linen, which are in such esteem that they send them to all quarters. The places depending on, and bounding Nishapour, are nume-( 215 ) rous and extensive i as ^ Bourkan, and 1U* Maan, and l J u ^ L ki Selutek, and Turlzan, and Zozen, and Kanderuhan, and Daven, and Ai\d~ var, and Khosrugird, and Bahmanahad, and Kherinan, and Saruan, and Rem' vadeh, and Mihrjan, and ^jlyuJ Asferin, and Zeidin, and oV Gurkan, and Tons, to the north of Nisha- pour, where is the meshid of Ali ben Mousa al Redha, on whom be the blessing of God! There, also, is the burial-place of Haroun In the mountains of Nishapour and Tous they find Turquoises. In former times the governors of Khorasan resided at Mem, or at Balkh; but the Taherian f family made Nishapour the capital- Many illustrious personages and learned men, as is well known, have issued from this place.* ♦ • The city of Meru, which is also called Meru Shahjan, is very ancient. Some say it was originally built by Tahmuras, or by Dhul Kernein (Alexander the Great). Here are three celebrated mosques: one which was erected at the first introduction of Islam, they call the old mosque. Four streams * The Khalif Haroun ArrasHid died in the year of the Hegira 193, (A. D. 808.) t The Taherian Dynasty began in the year of the Hegira 225, (A. D. 839), and lasted fifty-six years : it consisted of five princes.( 216 ) water this city: near one of these the ancient walls and buildings were situated, of which some vestiges may yet be seen. There are four gates: one, the jC* Deri S/iciristcin, near the # v great mosque: the second is called Deri Shehjan; the third, Deri Ber ; the fourth, Deri Mish- han; this is the gate of Khorasan. Near this gate was the camp and palace of Mamoun, where he resided until his succession to the khalifat. The J^l Rudi Amol is a considerable river: those streams which we have mentioned, all proceed from it; and it is called the Murghab or the Water of Meru jr v ' Here Yezdegird, the last Persian monarch, was slain in a mill; which circumstance gave to the Mussulmans possession of Far- sistan. From Meru also rose the splendour of the Abbassides; and Mamoun was at Meru when he became heir to the Khalifat. Various gallant generals and illustrious learned men has Meru produced; so that in more remote times, it was remarkable above all other places of Iran, dojjy Barzouieh, the physician who excelled all others of his profession, and Barhud, the musician who composed such delightful airs, were of this place. The melodies of Barbud are still imitated in this country. The fruits of Mem are finer than those of any other place; and one cannot see in any other city such palaces, with groves, and streams and gardens. They manufacture silk at Meru; and I•i ■ ' '■'■t&amp;Ss ■ ( 217 ) have heard that the art of making it was originally transferred from Mem to Taberistan, and that they still send to Mem for the eggs of the silkworms, from the other cities. The cotton and linen of Meru are also highly esteemed. Herat * is the name of a city to which belong the follow ing places: Malef, Hessan, Aserlnanf, Auheh, jU Marahad, Dashan, Kerukh, Hust, Masher an, j C&gt;\ Ader, Sheker Kuaran, ^Kousef, Ashran. The city of Herat has a castle with ditches. This castle is situated in the center of the town, and is fortified with very strong walls. Kehendiz, with its mosque, belongs to this city. The governor's palace is situated in the suburb called Khorasan Ah ad. Herat extends about half a farsang on the road of Busheng or Pusheng There are four gates; one on the road to Balkh; another, on the Nishapour road, called Zeyadi; another, which they call ojl Derwazeh Khushk. All the gates are made of wood, except that on the road to Balkh, which is of iron, and situated in the midst of the city. In all Khorasan and Maweralnahr there is not any place which has a finer or more capacious mosque than Heri (or Herat). Next to it * Or t£yi) Heri. t Aserinan or Aserbenan. f f( 218 ) we may rank the mosque of Balkh; and, after that, the mosque of Seiestan. At the distance of two farsang from Herat there is a mountain, between which and the city there is not any garden, orchard, nor water, except the river of the city and a bridge. In all the other directions there are gardens and orchards. This mountain, of which we have spoken, produces not either grass or wood, or any thing but stones, which serve for mill-stones. Here is a place in habited called Ajd Siccah, with a temple or church of Christians, The most flourishing quarter of Herat is that in the direction of the gate called jC* Deri Pirouz (or Firouz). Ihe w ater here rises in the vicinity of the liebcit A.// dcui , and when it approaches Herat, other streams branch off from it. One of these is called Rud Yarkhoui, and it Avaters the district of UC1&gt;J Sep id Asenk : another stream runs through the villages of Kir as an and Siaveshan. The river called UCxJ Kabuk, waters the villages of Aarian, and ^^Gurigur, There is also the river Saaueki running towards Pusheng; and the river Ardenjan, which runs towards the village of Seirshian; and the river ^ Neshukan, which waters the village of Verin ; and the river Khehrki, which runs amidst the gardens and orchards of the city of Herat.

Asferan has four towns belonging to it. Pousheng is about half the size of Herat, and built on the same plan. The towns depending on Pousheng are, Khosrugird, (J&gt;^ Kouseri and Hereh. Pousheng pro duces such a number of ararj- trees, as is not to be found in all Khorasan beside : they are sent to all parts. The river of Pou sheng comes from Heri, and runs on to Sarkhes ; but in a season of excessive heat the water does not run so far, Pou sheng has a castle, with a ditch: it has three gates. Kouseri is a smaller town than Pousheng; but it is well watered, and has gardens, groves, and orchards. Badghis has several places within its territory: The # i . d , t I find in the MS.

The Kouh Seim contains mines of silver. There are running streams at Koui Ummabad, and at Harur; but for the purposes of husbandry rain water is used there; also at Kaloun and Kaberoun, where they have well water. The silver mines are on the road to Sarkhes. v —KtS' Keif is a smaller place than Be in. Bein is larger then Pousheng. Both Keif and Bein are well-watered, and abound in gardens and orchards. I Meru-al-rudf is a larger town than Pousheng, with a considerable river, which is the same that runs to Meru (Shahjan). Here are extensive gardens and orchards. The town of v— Koushek Ahef is also well watered, and has gardens, but not equal to those of Meru-al-rud. The air of (^UUUo Talkan is wholesomer than that of Meru-al-rud. The river runs between these, and is crossed over by a bridge. Here are many gardens and plantations. Talkan is about the same size as Meru-al-rud : it is situated amid hills; but has running water, and orchards that produce good fruit. * (. jt&gt;Lw t Or Meru 'rud.' v ■,: v. 1; ; f,mii-:•; • •:5?ii' ( 221 ) Gourkam is the name of a district, where there is a co lony of Jews. Shiur Kan is a district, with a village called fjOdS Kanderm. (^ L j San is a small town, the inhabi tants of which are of the Shian sect; it is smaller than Meru-al- rud : it has running water with some cultivated grounds, and gar dens, and orchards. In the district of Gourkan the Sekhtian Gourkani ( a Morocco leather) is prepared, which they send to all parts of Khorasan. From Shiurkan to jLol Amar is one merhileh; and from Shiurkan to vbW Barab, two merhileh; and from Shiurkan to Kanderm, four merhileh. Two towns belong to Ghurjesfan, one called, j Neshin, the other jj-^&gt; Surmin, nearly of equal size. Ne- shin produces great quantities of rice *; and Surmin of dried grapes. From Neshin one goes to the Derreh of Meru-al-rud; and from Neshin to Surmin is the distance of one merhileh. jGhaur, which is a considerable district, I shall enumerate among the regions of Islam, or Mohamedanism: because many True Believers dwell there. It is a mountainous country, well inhabited, with running streams, and gardens, (jucLy* Sarkhes is a city between Mem and Nishapour, situated on a level, without any running water but that which * g-'ji In the MS. without points, may also be oranges,( 222 ) comes from Pousheng *. It is computed that Sarkhes is as large as Meru-al-rud: It is a populous and thriving city: the air is wholesome : the inhabitants drink well-water, and they employ horses or asses in their mills. LwJ Ncsa is a city of the same magnitude as Sarkhes : it is plea sant and well supplied with water running amidst the houses and streets, and various orchards, groves, and gardens. ^ j I j Kaein is as large as Sarkhes; all the buildings are of clay; it has a fort, with ditches, and a mosque, and a governor's house: the water which they drink there is conveyed in trenches; it has but a few orchards or gardens, and the air is cold. Teisin \ is smaller than Kaien : it has some trees, and the water is conveyed in trenches. Chun is smaller than Teisin; it has fine gardens, and very little water: the inhabitants have sheep and other beasts. aj U / Kuhaheh is larger than Chun, and has two villages be longing to it: the water which they use is brought in trenches. Of all these places which we have just mentioned the air is cold; and an ample desert stretches out between them, where shepherds reside. * Seepage 219. f Doubtful.( 223 ) In the district of Kaien, on the road leading to Nishapour, is found such excellent chalk, that it is sent into all parts. Through out all the region of ^ Kouhestan there is not any river water: the inhabitants, therefore, drink water preserved in trenches, or well-water. Here they manufacture very fine linen&gt; hair-cloth, and similar stuffs. ^ Balhh.- t -Of Balkh these are the various districts and diyi- sions: Tokharestan, Khulm, Sernen- gan, Baghelan, Sekilkend, Zaalein, ^j\ Arher, jj \ j Rawer, Talk an, Sehekemest \ jjj fFerwa, Serai Aasim, Hesheh, ^IjcXJl Anderab, Mudr, and Kah. The towns in the hilly part of this country are, Shehran, Hellaverd, and Lavakend, Kaweil, Helil, Sekandereh, Kabul, Penjehir, which is also called Satir: but we descibe these cities of the hilly country as belonging to Maweralnahr; but some may be esteemed rather in the territory of Badakshan. The city of Balkh is situated on a level ground, at the distance of four farsang from the mountains: it has ramparts, with a castle and mosques; and extends about half a farsang: the buildings are of clay. There are six gates. The first of these is called jC &gt; Deri Nuhehar; another, the Deri Rehabeh: another, the i ^ j \ jO ^ X &amp; Derwazeh Hindouan( 224 ) (the gate of the Indians): another is called Deri Jehudan (the Jew's gate): another, jC &gt; Deri Shest- Vend; and oneealled Deri Yahia. Through the town runs a stream called the C &gt; jj lludi Haas, which passes out at the gate of the Nubehar: this stream turns ten mills, and waters several villages and districts, and flows as far as OyTolw, Siahgird. In the direction of every gate there are gardens and orchards. The walls of Balkh are made of clay, and there is not any ditch. Of Tokharestan the largest city is (^UulL Taikan, situated on a plain, in the vicinity of mountains. It is watered by a considerable river, and has many orchards and gardens. AjjjOjI Anderaheh is situated between the mountains and Penjhir. There are two rivers, one the aj J j OJI Hud An- derabeh ; the other Rud Kasan\ with gardens and orchards. The other towns of Tohkarestan are nearly of the same size as these; bat Taikan is the largest of all. Zualein and Derah are two towns, with run ning water, and considerable plantations of trees. Is- kandereh, or Sekandereh, is situated in the midst of the moun tains. Khesh is the largest town of this mountainous country; also, the towns of Mank and UdU Melenk are amongst the hills, where there are various streams, which, as( 225 ) they approach cXey Termed, are collected together, and fall into the river Jihoon, (the Oxus.) Mank is a larger town than Melenk; but the houses of both are made of clay. Badakhshan is smaller than Mank. The neighbouring grounds are well cultivated, and the district populous, with many gardens on the banks of the river. The hills here abound in excellent cattle; and Badakhshan pro duces the ruby (cJ^-0 and lapiz lazuli (Oy^Ji). The mines are in the mountains ; and there is also much musk at Badakhshan. Penjhir is a town situated on the mountains, contain ing about ten thousand inhabitants, people of bad character: here are gardens and running water, but husbandry is neglected. Jarianeh is a smaller town than Penjhir. Between these two places are the mines of ore, in which the people dwell, with out gardens, orchards, or tilled lands. The river of Penjhir runs through the town, and passes from Jarianeh till it comes to Ferouan, and so proceeds into Hindoostan. Bamian is a town about half as large as Balkh, situated on a hill. Before this hill runs a river, the stream of which flows into Gurjestan. Bamian has not any gardens nor orchards, and it is the only town in this district situated on a hill: all the others have gardens and orchards, except Ghizni, which has not any, A stream runs through Ghizni, than which g g( 220 ) of all the towns in the districts of Balkh, none is more wealthy or commercial, being the pass or frontier of Hindoostan. Kahul is a town with a very strong castle, accessible only by one road: this is in the hands of the Mussulmans; but the town belongs to the infidel Indians. They say that a king is not properly qualified to govern^ until he has been inaugurated at Kabul, however distant he may have been from it. Kabul is also (like Ghizni) a pass into Hindoostan. The fruits of a warm climate, which abound at Balkh, are bi ought to Kabul,, except dates, which do not grow at Balkh, where snow falls. Kabul is situated in a warm climate, but does not produce date trees. jjt Ghawr is a mountainous country. In the places about it there are Mussulmans; but Ghawr is mostly inhabited by In fidels. Here are great mountains. The dialect of Ghawr is like that of Khorasan. It is populous, containing many running streams ; and I have described it as belonging to Khorasan, be cause it borders on that province; in like manner including Bamian, and Penjhir, and Maweralnaher, as far as Turkestan- The mountains of these places all abound with mines. But the Jihoon (or river Oxus) and Kliarezeiriy and Amoly and Zam, we reckon as belonging to Maweralnahar (Transoxania); and shall speak of them accord-indoostan, s cas ^ e ) Cubans; ij' rsa ythata^ ina^ froi nit.

Kharezem is situated on the borders of the (Caspian) sea; and the bounds of it, from Balkh and Meru and its other extre mities, are all a desert, in which there is not any thing but sand. This desert affords not any running stream : the people use well- water until you come as far as Meru. Sheep are produced in Ghizni, and Ghaur, and Khilje. Gar ments of silk and linen are brought from Balkh and Nishapour. The best sheep are those of Ghizni; and the best water, that of the river Jihoon. The men of Balkh are ingenious, and learned in religion and law, and of polite manners. Nishapour is the pleasantest part of Khorasan, and the inhabitants of the most amiable and chearful disposition. The warm parts of Khorasan are, Kouhestan, and the borders of Kirman and Pars (or Farsistan). The cold part of Khorasan is about Bamian; for I speak of those places bordering on Kharezem as belonging to Maweralnahar. Of the Roads and Stages of Khorasan. W e shall not here particularly describe the roads and stages of Khorasan, because they are already sufficiently known. We g g 2( 230 ) journey; from Mihrjan to Asferein, two days journey: and when you go from Bahmanabad to Mihrjan, the first day brings you to a o b inenzilgcih, or halting-piace; the se-^ cond, to Mihrjan. Account of the Stages and Roads of Mem. F rom Mem to ^^J-Keseher, one menzil: from Keseher, by the skirts of the desert of Kharazm, and from Mem to Dendalekan, two merhileh. The road of Sarhhes, the road of AjjIj Baverd, and Siisikan, and Ghaz- nein, or Ghurnein, go to Dendalekan. ^ Chun is a town of three farsang distance between the roads of Sarkhes and Baverd ; and Susikan is one menzil farther. Roads and Stages of Balkh. F rom Balkhto Khulm, twadaysjourney (oJ^j j^); from Khulm to Valein, two days journey; from (^UuLL Taikan to Badakhshan, seven days journey; from Khulm to Sebenjan*' or Senjan, one day's journey; * Doubtful,( 232 ) Account of McLwevcLlncihr, or TrcmsoxcinicL. To the eastern side of Maweralnahr are, the borders of Hin- doostan. To the west it has the land of Ghaznein, and the borders of Tourcrn, and down to l — I at ah, and Markand, and u X a - kw Soghd, and Samarcand, and the district of Bokhara, as far as Kharazm, and the banks of the sea Deria). On the north of Maweralnahr are the borders of Turkestan, as far as aJliy Ferghanah, and down towards Khotl, on the river Heriat. To the south, Mawer- alnahar begins from Badakhshan, along the river ^ysfi^Jihoon, up to the sea or lake of Kharazm Deriay Kharezm) in a straight line. We place Kharazm and Khotl in Maweralnahar, because Khotl is situated between the river Heriat and the river IFekhshah ujUL c L j 0&gt;; and the town of Kharazm is on that side of the river, and nearer to Maweralnahr than to Khorasan. This is the delineation of Maweralnahr. (Here one page is left blank for a Map.J( 233 ) The province of Maweralnahr is one of the most flourishing and productive within the regions of Islam or Mahommedanism. The inhabitants are people of probity and virtue, averse from evil, and fond of peace. Such is the fertility and abundance of this country, that if the other regions were afflicted by a scarcity or famine, the stock laid up on the preceding year in Mawer alnahr would afford ample provision for them all. Every kind of fruit and meat abounds there; and the water is most delicious. The cattle are excellent: the sheep from Turkestan, Ghaznein, and Samarcand, are highly esteemed in all places. Maweralnahr affords raw silk, wool, and hair, in great quan tities. Its mines yield silver, and tin or lead abundantly; and they are better than the other mines, except those of silver at Penjhir; but Maweralnahr affords the best copper and quicksilver, and other similar productions of mines; and the mines of sal ammoniac (used in tinning or soldering) in all Khorasan, are there*. Like the paper made at Samarcand, there is hot any to be found elsewhere. So abundant are the fruits or OoLw Soghd, and Astersheineh, and Ferghanah, and Chaje (or Shash), that they are given to the cattle as food. Musk is brought from CXO' Tihhet, and sent to all parts. Fox-skins, sable, and ermine skins, are all to be found at the bazars of Maweralnahr. '* I have translated this passage literally, h h( 234 ) Such is the generosity and liberality of the inhabitants, that no one turns aside from the rites of hospitality; so that a person contemplating them in this light, would imagine that all the families of the land were hut one house*. When a traveller arrives there, every person endeavours to attract him to himself, that he may have opportunities of performing kind offices for the stranger; and the best proof of their hospitable and generous disposition is, that every peasant, though possessing but a bare sufficiency, allots a portion of his cottage tor the reception of a guest. On the arrival of a stranger, they contend, one with another, for the pleasure of taking him to their home, and enter taining him. Thus, in acts ot hospitality, they expend their in comes. The Author of this work says, ' I happened once to be in Soghd, and there I saw a certain palace, or great building, ' the doors of which were fastened back with nails against the ' walls. I asked the reason of this; and they informed me, that ' it was an hundred years, and more, since those doors had been shut: all that time they had continued open, day and night: ' strangers might arrive there at the most unseasonable hours, or ' in any numbers; for the master of the house had provided 'everything necessary both for the men and for their beasts; ' and he appeared with a delighted and joytul countenance when * If the simplicity of this beautiful eulogium should please the reader as much as it has delighted the translator, he will, perhaps, derive additional satisfaction from perus ing this part of it in the original :50 that j gine that ^hen a ^ to liiusi ? tind offices ij ■able and genet; b «Ulffl r the reception j contend, one m 'home, andeitt y expend then;, ippened oncetok or ;h nail informed me, i 3se doors had k n, day and if asonable boms,® )use 1 for countenance fto the reader as iM^' ] satisfaction ( 235 ) the guests tarried a while. Never have I heard of such things in any other country. The rich and great lords of most other places, expend their treasures on particular favourites, in the indulgence of gross appetites and sensual gratifications. The people of Maweralnahr employ themselves in a useful and rational manner: they lay out their money in erecting caravan serais or inns, building bridges, and such works. You cannot see any town or stage, or even desert, in Maweralnahr, with out a convenient inn or stage-house for the accommodation of travellers, with every thing necessary. I have heard that there are above two thousand rebats or inns in Maweralnahr, where as many persons as may arrive shall find sufficient forage for their beasts, and meat for themselves.' The Author of the book further says, ' I have heard from a respectable person who was with ^lj Nasser Ahmed, in the war of Samarcand, that of all his immense army, the greater part were men of Maweralnahr; and I have heard that Motasem wrote a letter to jbWa a JJI c X ac Ahdallah hen I'aher, and sent a letter to Noah hen Asek. The answer of Abdallah was, that in Maweralnahr there are three hundred thousand Kulahs: each Kulab furnishes one horseman and one foot-soldier; and the absence of these men, when they go forth, is not felt, or is not per ceptible in the country. I have heard, that the inhabitants of Chaje and Ferghaneh are so numerous, and so Ci v &gt; h h 2( 230 ) ' well disciplined, and furnished with implements of war, that ' they are not to be equalled in any region of Islam. And among ' the lower classes there are farmers, who possess from one hun- ' dred to five hundred head of cattle. Notwithstanding all this, ' there are not any people more obedient to their kings; and at ' all times the Turk soldiers had the precedence of every ' other race, and the Khalifs always chose them on account of 44 their excellent services, their obedient disposition, their bravery, ' and their fidelity.' &gt; Maweralnahr has produced so many great princes and generals, that no region can surpass it. The bravery of its inhabitants cannot be exceeded in any quarter of the Mussulman world. Their numbers and their discipline give them an advantage over other nations, which, if an army be defeated, or a body of troops lost at sea, cannot furnish another army for a considerable time; but in all Maweralnahr, should such accidents happen, one tribe is ready to supply the losses of another without any delay. In all the regions of the earth, there is not a more flourishing or a more delightful country than this, especially the district of Bokhara. It a person stand on the Kohendiz (or ancient castle) of Bokhara, and cast his eyes around, he shall not see anv thing but beautiful green and luxuriant verdure on every side of the country: so that he would imagine the green of the earth and the azure ot the heavens were united; And as there are green'5 'ttSS IS '•i'? •'i ents of Wat, a ®' And,, 185 from 0 nel| hstandir ,eirki ngs ;ai«l i : wience of ^ m on account P : m ' ^irbniiot, nces of its ir lussulman wdl to advantage oi?

And in all Khorasan and Maweralnahr there are not any people more long-lived than those of Bokhara^ ' It is said that in all the world there is not any place more ' delightful (or salubrious) than those three: one, the Soghd of ' Samarcand; another, the Rud Aileh; and the third, the Ghu- ' tah of Damascus Bat the Ghutah of Damascus is within one farsang of barren and dry hills, without trees ; and it contains many places which are desolate, and produce no verdure. ' A ' fine prospect ought to be such as completely fills the eye, and ' nothing should be visible but sky and green f.' The river Aileh affords, for one farsang only, this kind of prospect; and there is not, in the vicinity of it, any^ eminence from which one can see beyond a farsang; and the verdant spot is either sur rounded by or opposite to a dreary deserts But the walls, and buildings, and cultivated plains of Bokhara, extend above thirteen farsang by twelve farsang; and the c X j L w Soghd, for eight days journey, is all delightful country, affording fine prospects, and full of gardens,, and orchards, and villages, corn fields, and villas, and running streams, reservoirs, and fountains, both on the right hand and on the left.. You pass from corn fields into rich mea- * To this passage the Tarikh Tah art alludes, in a chapter relating the Virgin Mary's, flight from Jerusalem with Christ.—The original Persian is given in the Preface. 1' ^ i C * 3'^* * &lt; ~~ y ^5** J''2 j ^( 238 ) dows and pasture lands; and the Soghd is far more healthy than the Rud Aileh, or the Ghuteh of Dameshk (or Damascus); and the fruits of Soghd are the finest in the world. Among the hills and palaces flow running streams, gliding between the trees-. In Ferghanah and Chaje, in the mountains between Ferghanah and Turkestan, there are all kinds of fruits, of herbs, and flowers, and various species of the violet: all these it is lawful for any one who passes by, to pull and gather. In Siroushteh there are flowers of an uncommon species. We have placed, as first of the borders of Bokhara, from the banks of the Jihoon, the Kourehs and Districts of Maweralnahr. From the Jihoon is the territory of Soghd, and Samarcand, and Siroushteh, and Chaje, and Ferghaneh, and back, from the bor ders of Samarcand to Kish, and ChegJianian, and Khotlan, till one comes to the river Jihoon. Termed and Cohadian, as far as Kharezm, and Barah, and Sinjan, and Teran, and Ailak, are reckoned as belonging to Chaje, and included in Ferghanah. Khuarezm we have assigned to Maweralnahr; and we must reckon as part of Soghd, Bokhara, and Rish, and jSaksheb : but our design in this was to render the de scription more easy. We begin with Maweralnahr, and the district of Bokhara; and then we speak of the river Jihoon. This river rises within the territories of Badakshan,orI)a masciis A®! ^ eeri ttie treej. between Fer^ ^ er bs, and Ife 8 ^wful foraii T| Sinnii, Bokhara, froir ■ts of Mawerak: md SamarcaiiiU ^scL from tkk /ijbk Ougkm n^e: Jihoon. ik /ircLKko 1 qU?

The river fFekhesh joins it: then the river Nouman, which is the river of L_CU Meneh. The third is the river Farghi; the fourth river is that of ^!jl^: J cXjl Andenjaragh ; the fifth, the river IVikhshah, near ^Ui K o hadian. All these rivers fall into the Jihoon: the river Wekhshab comes out of Turkestan, into the land of Wekhsh, near a mountain, where there is a bridge between Khotlan and the borders of Weishhird, From that it runs towards Balkh, and falls into the Jihoon at Termed. The Jihoon then proceeds to ^—*J ^ Kalef, and from Kalef to Zam, and from Zam to Amoui, and from Amoui to Khuarezm, and flows into the lake of Khua- rezm. There is not any town watered by the Jihoon, until you come to Zam: there the inhabitants derive some benefit from it; still more at Amoui: but the chief advantage of the Jihoon results to Rharezm. The first district of Maweralnahr, situated on the river Jihoon, is Khotlan: there are also Wekhsh, and other districts. Near Wekhsh there are some districts, such as Dekhan, and Sekineh : these two belong to the Infidels. Boys and girls are brought from these places. There are mines of gold and silver in Wekhshab. The mountainous country, bordering upon Tibet, is very populous, well cultivated, abounding in fruits, and excellent cattle; and the climate is very pure and healthy. I( 240 ) cXy Termed is a city situated on the banks of the Jihoon : it has a castle and suburbs, and ramparts : the government palace is in the kohendiz, or castle ; the prison is in the town ; the mosque, and the bazars, in the suburbs. The buildings are of clay; all the streets and bazars are paved with burnt tiles. They drink the water of the Jihoon ; and use, for the purposes of agriculture, the water of the river Cheghanian (jLyLx^. ^L/^Lo Kohadian is smaller than Termed. Weish- gird is about the same size as Termed. From the borders of Weishgird to Shuman, to near Cheghanian, they culti vate saffron. (^bc^Lo Kohadian produces madder Cheghanian is larger than Termed ; but Termed is more populous, and better supplied. Akhseik is opposite Zam. Zam is on the borders of Khorasan, but reckoned among the ter ritories of Maweralnahr : it is a small town, and the inhabitants deal in cattle. Zam, and Akhseik, on the banks of the Jihoon, are both at the extremity of the desert. Khuarezm is the name of a region distinct from Khorasan. All iound Khuarezm the desert extends. One side of it borders on Ghaznein; that is the western side. The western and southern sides are bounded by Khorasan and Maweralnahr. After Khuarezm and Jihoon, there is not any town until you come to the lake. Khuarezm is situated on the northern side of the Jihoon. On the southern side of the Jihoon is ^Korkanje : it is a rappsteag: . remnient rt«i, t0Wn ;4e^ P are of^,. t '' es ' f'tjts P^rfagtioli, ''■ k 'rom the lorfc, ; glianian, &gt; madder ledis moreDODi opposite and the in lanks of theJik rom Khorasan, I ide of it bortee: i.

It so happens, that one half of Khuarezm should appear in the map of Khorasan, and the other half in the map of Maweralnahr ; but we have wished not to separate those parts, or render the re ference to the map more difficult. These are the other cities of Kharezm': Deraan, Hesarasp, o^.^. Chereh, j^CSj\ Ardejer, i^jjiL, Saf- zoun, Nouran, Kirdan, Khouas, Kirder. The villages are, ^SjNekin, \^Merda, ^[l ^Jefan, Memha, Deha, Hasher, ^ KanjesJc. The chief place of that territory is called Kah; it has a castle now in ruins. There was a town here which the water destroyed, and the people built another higher up ; and the water has approached the castle, and, it is feared, will ruin it also. The mosque is in this castle, and near it is the palace of the o U j Khuarezm Shah : near the castle is the prison : and in the midst is a little river called Kherdour, and the bazar is on the banks of it; the length of it is about three far- sang. The gates of the city are, for the greater part, demolished ; but they have prepared new ones. The first border of Khuarezm is called Taheriah, in i i( 242 ) the direction of Amoui, an inhabited country on the south of the river Jihoon. On the north side of l\.huarezm there is not any population or cultivation, until one comes to the village which they call Ghar-al-haiah ; from that to Khuarezm there is some appearance of inhabitants and of buildings. At six far- sang distance, before you come to this village, there is a river which joins the Jihoon, and on the banks of this are many vil lages and hamlets; this river is called Gaw-Khareh; in breadth it is about five guz; boats ply on it. After rim ing two farsang, there is another river branching from it, which they call Gurbah ; it waters many villages, but is not very broad: from this, for about one merhileh in breadth, the villages and buildings become more numerous ; and when you come to Korkanje, at two farsang back, there is the ex tremity of the borders of Khuarezm ; and at five farsang a ruined village, called Koragh, near a mountain: from which, and from Hezarasp, on the western side of the Jihoon, there are streams running from that river : Here is Amoui; and there is another river about half as large as the Gaw Khareh, on which boats ply at within two farsang of Hezarasp. This river is called Rudi Kurd Khouas, and is larger than the river of Hezarasp. There is also the river o_&gt;^. Heir eh, on which boats ply. i From the river Dal to Khuarezm is two farsang. The river qjj Bouh is in the district of Korkanje.

From the river Gaw Khareh to the city is twelve farsang ; and there is another river below Khuarezm four farsang, which receives its waters from four different places; when they are united, they form a stream about as large as that of the river Bouh. It is said that the Jihoon crosses this river; and that, when the waters of the Jihoon sink, the stream is also diminished. There are many streams on the northern side of the Jihoon, at one far sang from the town called Medeminiah ; and all the villages along have small streams. The Jihoon falls into the lake at a place called Khiljan, where there is not any village, nor any buildings ; the people live by fishing. On the banks ot this lake is the land of jt Ghuz ; from this, when they are at peace, they go from this side to the village of j /SlJY Aubgir, and from the other to Korkange; both of these are on the banks of the Jihoon. Before one comes to the the river Gaw Khareh there are some mountains, amidst which the Jihoon runs : this place is called Boukeseh; and from the place where the Jihoon falls into the lake or sea to that place where the river of Chaje falls into it, is a journey of ten days. The river Jihoon is frozen in win- i i 2( 244 ) ter, so that loaded carriages pass over it. The ice begins at Khua- rczm, which is the coldest place upon the Jihoon. On the banks of the sea or lake of Khuarezm there is a mountain called Cheghagher : here the ice con tinues from winter till near the end of summer. The circum ference of this sea or lake is an hundred farsang : its waters are salt or bitter; and the river Jihoon, the river Chaje, and many other streams, flow into this lake: yet this increase of water is not perceptible ; and it is generally supposed that there is a communication between this lake and the Caspian Sea ( Der- yai-i Khozr between these two is a distance of twenty merhileh. Khuarezm is a town well supplied with provisions, and abound- \ ing in fruits ; it affords not any walnut-trees. Linen and wool are manufactured there, and also brocade. The inhabitants are people of high reputation and polished manners : the men of Khuarezm are great travellers; there is not any town in Khorasan without a co lony of them. The lower parts of the land of jt Ghuz belong to Khuarezm: the inhabitants are active and hardy. The wealth of Khuarezm is derived from its commerce and merchandize. They have carpets of Siklah, and of Khozr, and they bring to Khuarezm, from Khozr, the skins of foxes, and martens, sables, and ermines.:be gmsaRL ^ ice % r ' circmt. v its waters are ^ Chaje, ani increase of )0 ^ tkt then spian Sea (Der is a distance of ( 245 ) Of the other places on the river Jihoon, we shall place Bokhara in Maweralnahr first: at all times it has been the seat of government. Bokhara is called BounJieket: it is situated on a plain; the houses are of wood, and it abounds in villas, and gardens, and orchards; and the villages are as close one to another as the groves and gardens, extending for near twelve farsang bj twelve farsang : all about this space is a wall, and within it the people dwell winter and summer; and there is not to be seen one spot uncultivated, or in decay. Outside this there is another wall, with a small town and a castle, in which the Sa- manian* family (^UJUU j JT), who were governors of Kho- rasan, resided.

The river of Soghd (O o L m runs through the midst of it, and passes on to the mills and meadows, and to the borders of OJjClj Beikend ; and much of it falls into a pond^ or pool near Beikend, at a place called (j^-^ Sam Kous. Bokhara has seven gates : one is called the Deri Sharestan ; the second, Deri Derou; the third &gt; * For some account of this dynasty, and of Nasser Ahmed, mentioned in page 235, see the Appendix.( 246 ) odsXS jC&gt; Deri Kandeh ; the fourth, j&amp; Dei* Ahenin; the fifth JoJyj jC&gt; Deri Kohendez; the sixth is called the oj \ jj O Derwazeh Mihrgy, or c_X&gt;^! oj!

The ramparts also have some gates, such as the Deri Meidan, leading towards Khorasan; the Derwazeh Ibrahim, towards the east; the O l O c L Derwazeh Khedik ; the o JI jj O Der wazeh Beroukeseh; the Derwazeh Gulahad; the ojljjC* Derwazeh Nuhehar ; the Derwazeh Samarcand ; the Derwazeh Amineh ; the^j Derwazeh Hedi Serour, which is on the Khuarezm road; and the jC&gt; Deri Ghunje. There are, besides, some gates among the bazars, such as the Der Ahenin, or iron gate; the jO Deri Pool Hesan; and a gate near the mosque of Maje; and between these two gates there is another called Der Rejieh : there is also a gate near the villa of jj \ Abu Ha- shem, and near the bazar; and one near the ^ I j L o Goui Moghan (or the magi's dwelling), and the Deri Sa marcand. \ There is not any running water between the city and the gate0 ^ 4 tth is ^wtwo^, ^gateudi ^ Khorasan; tin ^ the east; tk ^ Lei- azeh Qulahai ojljjd 'wazeh Amini &gt; which is on tk izars, such as i [ue of ^ Mji; died Jlift ^bu (iy ^ Derih city and tk?

This river Nukendeh comes from the main river, near Nubehar, and runs among palaces, and houses, and mills, till it comes to the mills on the lands of &lt;_X a JC1 j Beikend, and affords water to them. The river a X x / Keiseh runs on to Gharan Murgh. The river Rebah ^ Xjj issues from the main river( 248 ) near Reikestan, and flows on to the villa of Rebab, and waters a thousand summer-houses, and gardens, and groves. The river of Reikestan passes through that place to which it af fords water, and to the kohendez, the suburbs near the ramparts, and the government house; and after that it proceeds to the villa of Jelal Deizeh. The river sinks into the ground near the bridge of Hamdounah jj , and flows sub- terraneously till it comes to the ponds of cX^J Beni Asad ; and the remainder of it runs into the reservoir or cistern ot the kohendez. There is another river proceeding from the main one, at the place called gjj IVera, which passes by the gate of Rehieh, proceeds to the Derwazeh Samarcand, and from that goes on one farsang.

One of these is the river Kaferi Kam ^ ^ which runs to JVerkaneh ; and the river .^1 c ^ Jerghan, which waters another district and goe5 on to Jermesh, and falls into the main river. The river oCkXf ^j Nukendeh, which waters a district, runs on to the village of Feranah, and the river Berjed, on which is a hamlet; and the river Best eh, and the river Anieniah, and the river Ferazin al Sejii, and the river ^ bvAij Telengan, which runs to Berkaa: every one of these affords water to its particular district, without the inclosure of the wall of Bokhara; the remainder runs among the suburbs and for tifications of that city. Of the rivers we have heretofore enumerated, the greater number proceeds from the river of Soghd, on which boats ply. The inclosure or wall round Bokhara contains twelve gates. There is not any hill or desert; all is laid out in castles, villas, gardens, corn-fields, and orchards. The wood which they use for fuel is brought from their gardens, and they burn also reeds and rushes. The grounds of Bokhara and of Soghd are all in the vicinity of water; whence it happens that their trees do not arrive at any considerable height; but the fruits of Bokhara are more excellent than the fruits of any part of Maweralnahr. Corn is brought to Bokhara from Maweralnahr and other places. K KThere is a mountain called dJjC&gt; Zarkah, in the vicinity of Bokhara; it goes between Samarcand and Kesh, and joins the border of Ferghaneh, and jljbi Atrar, and goes on towards the confines of Cheen ; and this mountain is skirted by a desert in the borders of Ferghaneh and Ailak, as far as Q Jer- jereh. In Ferghaneh there are mines of sal-ammoniac, and of copperas or vitriol, of iron, and quicksilver, and brass; also of gold, and of turquoise stone; and in this mountain there are springs of naphta, and of bitumen, and resin; also a stone that takes fire and burns. There is, likewise, water, which in summer is frozen, and in the depth of winter is warm. There are some districts of Bokhara within the walls, and some without: of those within the walls, -Touaveis is the most considerable town ; it is walled, and at a stated time, once every year, the people assemble in it from Maweralnahr : it has pleasant gardens, and orchards, and running streams, and an ancient castle, with suburbs, and a mosque : the inhabitants manufacture linen. The other towns within the walls are nearly of equal size one with another. Kerjinet is a large town; Jerghaneket, and Medrnamehelet are of equal size. Every town of the territories ot Bokhara has a district belonging to it, except Beikend, which has not any village, but con tains near a thousand Rebats.( 251 ) 4 The town of Kerin is near the river Jihoon. The people of Bokhara speak the language of the people of Soghd: they are ingenious : and in business they use direms r their silvei is Azerki, or Ghederki ; and the mode of purchasing used in Maweralnahr does not pass among them. For the greater pait they wear the tunick Lo and the cap At Bokhara, within the city, there are bazars, where, on cei- tain appointed days, the merchants assemble in great numbers, and transact much business. Bokhara and its territories produce fine linen. I have heard a peculiar circumstance mentioned, -concerning the Kohendiz or castle of Bokhara j which is, that they never have brought out of it the bier or coffin of any prince, and that any person once confined there is never seen again. ' It ' is said that the inhabitants of Bokhara are originally descended ^ from an ancient tribe, which emigrated from Istakhar and ' settled there*.' The Samanian princes resided at Bokhara; the territories of which and jVIaweralnahr were under their jurisdiction : the people of Bokhara were so obedient, and so observant of their treaties, that the sovereigns chose to reside among them. The kings of Khorasan were descended from the race of Saman. Ismael hen Ahmed resided there: the people of Khorasan had behaved treacherously towards him; and his children also resided at Bokhara. , Before that, the governors of k k 2( 252 ) Maweralnahr dwelt in Samarcand, at Chaje, or AJlcy Ferghanah ; but since that the seat of government has been re moved from Khorasan to Bokhara. Denjareh is situated near the road of &lt;_&gt;JJC1 j Beikend: between that, and between the road, is a distance of one farsang^ ^ Moghkan is five farsang distant from the city, on the right hand of Beikend, and from it to the road is a space of three farsang. Rendieh is at four farsang from Bokhara. Bumeheket is on the road of Touaweis at a distance of four farsang. From Kermeniah to Beikend is one farsangin the borders of Soghd. Bumeheket is situated on the river of Soghd. Soghd is adjacent to Bokhara. After passing Kermenieh one comes to Debousi. r i he capital of Soghd is Samarcand ; it is situated on the southern side of the river of Soghd. It has a castle, and suburbs, and fortifications, with four gates; one, the ^ ^ Deri Cheen, or the China gate, on the east; the Deri JVuhehar, or the spring gate, on the west; on the north, the Deri Bokhara, or Bokhara gate; and on the south, the Derwazeh Kesh, orKeshgate.

The most flourishing and populous quarter of Samarcand is that called the ^LL? y* Ser^i tauh. where there is the fountain ofjjJjl Arziz : and the shops of the bazar in this place are very numerous; for many legacies and gifts have been appropriated to the buildings about this fountain, which are in the charge of Guebres (or Fire-worshippers) who watch winter and summer. There is a mosque in the suburbs, near the kohendiz : and in the river Arziz there are springs, and rivulets from it water the gardens and orchards. The government palace is in the kohendiz ; and the citadel is near the river of Soghd; and the walls of these fortifications are about two farsang in extent. There are many villas and orchards, and very few of the palaces are without gardens: so that if a person should go to the kohen diz, and from that look around, he would find that the villas and palaces were covered, as it were, with trees; and even the streets and shops, and banks of the streams, are all planted with trees. Samarcand is the great pass into Maweralnahr; and the seat of empire was at Samarcand until I ^ Ismael hen Ahmed removed it to Bokhara. and bazars of&amp;- T he walls of the fortifications have several gates; such as the jO Deri Abed, the Deri Afsheineh, the( 254 ) &gt;&lt;3 Deri Kouhek, the Deri Rousein, the Deri JDiwoud, and the j&lt;3 Deri Fou- jend. The author of this work says, ' I saw a gate at Samarcand, ' of which the front was covered with iron ; and there was &lt;f written on it, in the HcLTiiiri language; that u Senaa is distant ' from Samarcand a thousand farsang ;' and the people preserved ' the explanation of this writing, in hereditary tradition. After ' that I had been at Samarcand, a tumult or insurrection happen- « ed; and this gate was burnt, and the inscription mislaid ' or destroyed. Afterwards, Abu MozafFer Mohammed ben ' Nasser ben Ahmed ben Ased, caused the gate to be again constructed of iron, but the writing was lost.*' The houses of Samarcand are made of clay and wood : the in habitants are remarkable for their beauty: they are gentle and polite in their manner, and of amiable dispostions. From Samar cand to the mountain ( qj /) is one merhileh: and there is close to the city a small eminence which they accordingly call kouheJc (a diminutive of ) the little mountain : that moun tain is about half a mile in length ; it produces clay, and marble, and stones of various kinds; and I have heard that in it were also mines of gold and silver, but they are not worked. * The reader will find the original Persian of this passage in the Appendix, No. I.

There is a reservoir for that water, which they call Bergher ; from this that water flows till it comes to a place called Bihe- ket, and thence to JVarghes, where there is a bridge ; from that the rivers of Samarcand are divided to the east and west. Those on the eastern side proceed from near Warghes, at the place called *, because the mountains there are fewer, and the cultivated fields more numerous: from this the river flows; and the river Bous also comes to Samarcand, to which, with the villages, it affords water. The river Barmis rises in the vicinity of that river, in the southern territory, and waters many villages there. The Bous and Barmis are the largest of all those rivers ; they both are navi gable for boats, and many streams branch off from them, which water many villages and meadows. From the territory of Warghis to the village called Zarghem, ten farsang in length, and from four to one farsang in breadth; from the dis trict of Barghis, and ^JuLc Manferenje, and Zarg hem, and Bikheru, above Zarghem, and the rivers which flow from the desert of Gherhan the river j s iakh ar and the river Sawat, and the river # I have given this word as it appears in my MS. In that of Eton a blank space is left for the name. t Istakhar of Pars, is generally written but sometimes like this( 256 ) j^Uj '.-c Mourmajez ; the river Sawat passes near the Mourmajez y ' / u/ and waters many places, and proceeds to the village of Weddan, and to the borders of the district of Istakhar : the river, in all, runs about two merhileh. The rivers Sawat and Mourmajez run towards the city, and water near seven farsang of territory, till they come to Samarcand; from the mouth or entrance of this valley, or water-course, to Samarcand, is a distance of twenty farsang. After passing Samar cand about two merhileh, a river branches off called Rudeki, which waters one of the most fertile and populous tracts of land in all Soghd : other streams branch off from this channel, until it approaches the territory of Bokhara, a journey of near six days, watering so many gardens and orchards, that if any person were to look from a hill along the valley of Soghd, he could not behold any thing but trees and green herbage, with here and there a villa and an old castle. In the district of Barghis are many gardens and dykes. From this valley (or channel) come the rivers above mentioned, and pass under the bridge of Kouhek Jjj, at the Samarcand gate j&lt;3. The waters of this valley are augmented in summer by the snow from the mountains of Ghurge- stan and the vicinity of Samarcand. In the territory ot Famurgh there is a certain place called( 2 57 ) eartheS S village Reboud, in which dwelt c X a ^^L! Aksheid, king of Samar- 0 f o ii cand; and his yilla or palace yet remains. ^ar:^ J i The village of Zerghem is adjoining to that of Famurgh.

The pas ture lands are better here than those of Maweralnahr. and dykes, ta nentioned, and piss at the Samd ' are augmented 0 U^ifc Those are the territories of Samarcand, on the right hand of this valley. These on the left hand are, Aulad, and Ovx/Barkeit, near Setrushtah; the village of i certain p. L L( 258 ) CkLj Kourghed, on the borders of Setmshtah, adjoining to Bar- keit. The village ofyLU; Bourmakher is large and well inhabited^ on the borders of Samarcand. From the borders of Gherban to those of Samarcand is about one merhileh. Weddan is a populous and fertile district, with hills and plains. The towns of Weddan and of Kish are situated near each other: these two places have belonged to tribes of Arabians, called Sebaaians. This people had dwellings at Samarcand. Merzeban hen Kas/ifi was a man of this district, whom all the illustrious and chief persons invited to the sovereignty of Irak. There are six villages of Samarcand on the right side of the val ley of Soghd, and six on the left. In former times the village of ^UxJ Laian w^as annexed to the territories of Samarcand, but afterwards became a district of Setrushtah. Pecuniary affairs are transacted in Samarcand by means of gold, and of direms of Ismael, broken, ; and there is another coin, called Mohammedi, which is not current in any other place besides the territories of Samarcand. This country abounds in gardens, and orchards, and corn fields, and pleasant prospects; and the Soghd is a delightful and fertile region. Keisaneh is the eye of all the towns of Soghd ; it is inhabited by rich and powerful people.adjoini ( 259 ) ct, ^ are sititd r M to tribes i 14 well ^ 8 ^Gherbaiijj Account of the City of Kish. Kish is a city with a kohendiz and ramparts, and two suburbs, one of which (the interior) and the kohendiz are ruined; the mosque also, which was here, is in ruins; the bazar is on the ramparts, and the extent of this city is three farsang by three pie had dwel% farsang. The climate here is warm: the buildings are of wood ien Kashji ^ an( j Here are four gates; one, the Der Ahenin, and chief per® or Iron Gate; another, the &lt;xAJ! c X- mx Derwazeh Abeid Allah ; the third, the Deri Kesahan; the fourth, the Deri Sharestan. The inner town has two gates; Jit side of the 4 one called the jC* Deri Sharestan Deruni; imes the villus and the other the Deri Turkestan. Turkestan is f Samarcani k the name of a certain village. Near this gate are two rivers; the ecuniarj aiiist Rudi Kesahan, which comes from the town of )fdiremsoW Si am - The two rivers pass by the gates of the city ; and mother coin caM there are other streams in the vicinity; such as the Oy Chaje Rud, on the Samarcand road, at the distance of one far sang from the city; and the river l JS c L Khehek Rud, on the Balkh road, also at one farsang distance from the city: and pleasant pro# . z r , another, called the river &lt;• J^ Jeran, on the Balkh road, at a , distance of eight farsang from the city. These streams fall into abited bj^ L L 2 man; :ountrv( 2(50 ) the valley of Naksheh, and water all the palaces of this city; and the gardens and villas of this place extend near four days journey. From this city of (JzS Kish much fruit and wood is produced : there are many villages belonging to Kish; such as C &gt; jj IFerd, and Belanderin, and Rasiman, and SwLU' KenJc, and AroUy and Heran, and Surudehy and l JCL w Senk Kerdeh Derouhein, and oO y Senk Kerdeh Beroubein. Those are the territories of Kish. Account of the City of Naksheh. T he city of Naksheb has a ruined kohendiz.

Naksheb is abudantly supplied with provisions,. Description of Setroushteh. Setroushteh is the name of a tract, or country like Soghd; there is not any city or villagesin this country that bears the name of Setroushteh. It is a mountainous region, bounded on the east by part of Ferghanah; on the west, by the borders of Samarcand; on the north, by Chaje; on the south, it lies near Kish and Cheghanian, and Sheman, and Dileshkird, and Rast. The chief town ot Se- troushteh is called, in the language of that country,( 202 ) Bownhekel; and the districts of it are, ^Ij! Aran, Sameket, Koukih, ^Gherk, JFaakes, L[j[^ Sahat, ( s ^&gt;yc]j Ramin, Dehzek, Boumheket, and Herkanah. Boumheket is the residence of the go vernors ; it contains ten thousand inhabitants: all the buildings of this town are made of claj and wood. The inner town has two gates ; one called the oj I^ Derwazeh Balamein; and the other, Derwazeh Sharestan. There is a mosque in this inner town, and a kohendiz: there is also a considerable river, which turns mills ; its borders are planted with trees : there are also bazars; and the extent of this town is one far- sang. The water of the ditch runs among the villas, and gardens, and meadows, and corn-fields. The citadel has four gates; one, the Derwazeh Ramin ; another, the Derwazeh^iOJ^ ^1 Ebn Sajnender; another, the Derwazeh ^ j ! Ehn Heket; and the fourth, the Derwazeh Kehilhan. This town has six streams or rivers ; the Sarin, which runs into the suburbs, the Berjin, the Resmajin, the i s k en k e j r&gt; ^ jj Rouleji, and the Seheker : all these six streams proceed from one fountain, and turn ten mills. From this fountain to the town is not so much as half a farsang. Ramin is about the same size as Setrushteh, situated on the Ferghaneh road, in the direction of Soghd: the people here call this place, in their language, oc W a X w Selisedeh Belis.BSMEMWfliHF.h • ;• W ^rjg Mm-.- • •!'■.■'tM-M!' i M,^ Siden « ^arestan, \ tiere is akii 1S town is one k illas,andgar(fe is four gates; out ivazeh jOyy, ^ Ihan.

The caravans on the high road from Ferghaneh to Soghd pass through it. There are many running streams and gardens, and much tilled land; and the back of this town extends to the hills of Setroushteh, and the front is to wards the desert of the country of Ghuz. The town of Dehzeh is built on level ground ; it is the chief town of a district: at two farsang distance from it there is a Rebat, which they call the bLtj Rehat Khedish: it was built by ( Afshin, and is the best Rebat; the people of Samarcand have not one better. In the midst of the Rebat there is a spring of water, over which a dome has been erected* LJy &lt;3 Deirek (or Dehzeh) is a pleasant and well-supplied town, with running water, gardens, and orchards. All the towns of this region, which we have spoken of, are nearly equal to and resemble one another, but Semendeh, which has running water, but has not any gardens, the cold being excessive. It is, however, a large town, and in summer has pleasant meadows. Ramein and S eh at are on the road of Ferghaneh and Chaje. If you wish to go the road of Khojend, by the way of Kouket, (or Kouklh) you must go to Fergha neh, nine farsang from Samarcand. In all Setroushteh there is not any river considerable enough to( 204 y admit of the plying of boats ; but there are running streams, and fountains, and meadows, and groves. The villages of the moun tainous part of Setroushteh are these: Beshagher, Ferghour, Baloam, Mesek, Lesken, Besenk. These are situated on steep hills: and the cold part of the country, also, has many strong fortresses. Here also ar^ mines of gold, and silver, and copperas, and sal ammoniac. The mines of sal ammoniac Nushader) are in the mountains, where there is a certain cavern, from which a vapour issues, ap pearing by day like smoke, and by night like fire. Over the spot whence the vapour issues, they have erected a house, the doors and windows of which are kept so closely shut and plastered over with clay that none of the vapour can escape. On the upper part of this house the copperas rests. When the doors are to be opened, a swiftly-running man is chosen, who, having his body covered over with clay, opens the door; takes as much as he can of the copperas, and runs off; if he should delay, he would be burnt. This vapour comes forth in different places, from time to time; when it ceases to issue from one place, they dig in another until it appears, and then they erect that kind of house over it: if they did not erect this house, the vapour would burn, or evaporate away. In the territory of ocJO^ Semendeh they make excellent iron. Iron is also manutactured at Ferghaneh.

At ( 265 ) there are market-days established, when people come from a great distance; these days occur once every month. Neshamein and Ailak are two districts, the extent of both which is two days journey by three. In all Soghd and Maweralnahr there is not any country equal to this in popu- lousness and in buildings: one of its borders is the valley or water course of £7^ Chaje, which falls into the lake of Khuarezm jO ; it is bounded also by the ^ Kar Ahen (or iron-works) on the confines of Sinkhah ; another of its boundaries extends to the mountains, adjoining the territories of Neshamein ; and another extends to Benagur of the Christians {Benagur Ter&amp;aian.) All the land is flat. ' Chaje is the most considerable of the frontiers of Turkestan: it has many fine buildings. Every palace in it has running water, and delightful verdure. All the buildings are of clay. The capital of that district is called CX-Cw Sehet ; and the other towns are, Divemaket, Hedinket, Kan- kouan, Nehaket, Saket, Housket, Saoudad, JVelanket, Kelenjek, Arsel, Jjjt Ghuzl, Alaudket, Aaje, Jenuder, Werdil, Kerneh, Adedalek, Bouheket, Laahek, Berkous, m m( 266 ) HciflGT'ltGt&gt; y ^^GT'lflJc6t, Js.Qclctlf and UJ ^ Kalek : all these are towns of Chaje.

Bounket, the capital, has a kohendiz without the city; but the walls of the town and of the kohendiz are the same. There is a citadel with a wall, and another fortification outside that, with gardens and palaces. The kohendiz has two gates, one of which is towards the town. The town has a wall, and three gates, one of which is called the Derwazeh Ahou al ahas ; the second is the (ji^ o Derwazeh Kish ; and the third is the ^ Deri Afienin, or iron gate. The citadel has ten gates on the inside; one, the Derwazeh Hamdein i the second, the Derwazeh Ahenin; the third, the Derwazeh Mir ; the fourth, Deri Ferkhan; the fifth, Deri oOJ' Kedeh; the sixth, Deri Kouafah ; the seventh, Derwazeh Kouy Sohel; the eighth, Deri Ashedbehak ; the ninth, Deri Khakan; and the tenth Derwazeh, Der Koushek Dehkan.^ 0)^ ^'lerei, 'out the citj; Ig the same.

The governor's palace and the prison are in the kohen- diz; and the chief mosque is on the walls of the kohendiz. In the inner town is a small bazar ; but there are great bazars in the citadel. The length of this citj is one farsang. The inner town and the citadel are watered by a running stream. There are extensive and fine gardens; and there is a great wall, reaching from the hill called Sailaa, to the brink of the channel or water-course of Chaje. This wall was erected, to separate the country from Turkestan, and prevent incursions. It was erected by order of Abdullah ben Hamid. From this inclosure, to the ditch or fosse, is a distance of one farsang. Here is another river, called the Rudi Turkestan, which partly comes from ^ Neskan, and partly from the country of Chekrel: it reaches the town of Behaket. There is in Ailak a river called by the same name (Ailak) : this also rises in Turkestan; and runs, for the greater part, into the river of Chaje. Boumeket is the chief town of Chaje. Chaje and Ailak border one upon the other. The buildings, and gardens, and orchards of Ailak, are continued to the valley or water-course of Chaje, without any inter- M M 2( 208 ) val. In the mountains of Ailak there are mines ot gold and of silver : these mountains are on the borders of Ferghaneh. Deinket is the largest of all the towns in Ailak. In all Maweralnahr there is not any mint, except at Samarcand and at Deinket. Senjat is a town, with a kohendiz and citadel; the former now in ruins. The town is in a flourishing state; the inner part of which extends for near a farsang. Near the citadel are gardens and running streams; from the town to the foot of the mountain is three farsang. The town has four gates: the Deri Bouchek, the Deri Farkhan, the a JO L w ^((3 Der Sakeraneh, and the Deri Bokhara. There is a bazar both in the town and in the citadel. The mosque, and the governor's palace, and the prison, are situated in the inner town. The towns in the territories of Senjat are, Bedheket, and Sameket, Teraz, Atlahy Belly, Kezr, and Ghersiran ; but Sameket is the chief town of the Koureh of Kunjideh Kezr is the chief town of Far ah. Mian is a town to which the people of 'jt Ghuz come for the purposes of traffick; and as there are not any hostilities carried on at Mian, the town flou rishes, and abounds in all the necessaries of life.nines of :rsof 1 ln Ailak. ^marcand inlji : aild citadel; t| e imhing state; Near the citai ' wn to tlie footoj LS four gates: tk en Farkhan, tk the citadel son, are ■JLdo Beikk iah, ^ Mi icket is the (if Kezrislk a town towfe }f traffick; and 2 an, ( 269 ) -1 ■ - uj !;U is the name of a district, the extent of which is near one day's journey ; all the places in it are very strong : it is a hilly country, and contains much land sown with grain. In the eastern part there is a valley with a water-course, which is supplied by the river of Chaje, and runs towards c X a X a . j Beikend to the west. _ l Chaje is a city flourishing and populous, and the inhabit ants are Mussulmans of jt Ghuz, and of Khilje, all of the Ghazi sect. Between Farab, and Kenjideh, and Chaje, there are many fields sown with grain : the people live in tents, and are all Mussulmans; but they are not powerful. Teraz is on the extreme border, between the land of the Turks and Mussulmans ; and all about there are strong castles, called in general after Teraz. The region of Islam extends as far as this spot. In the territories of AzerJcend there is a city, with a kohendiz, and a mosque, and ramparts, on which is situated the governor's house; and the prison is in the kohendiz : this is a pleasant town, affording good fruits, and inhabited by a courteous and handsome race. Corn is brought to this place from Fergh- aneh, and Setroushteh, and other countries, in boats, by the river of Chaje, which is a considerable stream. I( 270 ) The A mud rises in Turkestan, in the borders of Azer- kend; also the river Khersah, and the river Aiveis, and Lo Keha, and the river Hedali, and other streams. The people of jt Ghuz are for the greater number Mussulmans. Ghuz is the capital, where the kings of this country reside during the summer. The kingdom of Ghuz extends in a straight line ten merhileh from Khuarezm to this place; and from this to ejjjlj Bar ah, twenty merhileh. Ferghaneh is the name of an ample and fertile province, which contains many towns and villages : the capital is called Akhsiket: it is situated on a level ground, on a river; and has a kohendiz, and suburbs, and a castle. The governor's palace and the prison are in the kohendiz, and the mosque is in the town: There is an oratory on the banks of the river Chaje. The extent of this city is near three farsang. The castle is walled; and the inner town has five gates: the citadel has run- ing water: and there are gardens and groves at each of the gates; and there are rivers at the distance of about two farsang. Lo Kela is one of the pleasantest places in this country; it has suburbs, and a kohendiz, and a citadel: the kohendiz is fallen to decay; but the mosque is there.

AwerJcend enjoys the warmest climate of any place in the province of Ferghaneh : it is next to the enemy, and is twice or thrice as large as Awesh; it has a kohendiz and suburbs, with groves, and gardens, and running streams. In all Maweralnahr there is not any village more considerable than that of Ferghaneh ; it extends one farsang in length, and in breadth ; it is well inhabited; the people are good husbandmen, and pos sess much cattle. The territories of Ferghaneh are, Bestay Zeirin , ojl Areh, Touan, Memaroujan, Hed Ali, Awrest. The first of these territories is Bestay Zeirin, as one comes on the road from OvAjsr 4 ' Khojend.

This territory consists of both hilly and level ground, Kalmakhes, bC«U Mamkakhes, Soukh. There is a certain city called Medouaneh. Awerkend is also the name of a city, and there is not any other city in the territory, oj 1 Areh is the name of a territory, the chief town of which is called ]\1ieiil(iTH, this was the birth-place of &lt;xiJl y&amp;i Emir IIclsscih Nasser Ullah. 0 Uy Kerouan is the name of a city, all around which are many villages.

In the territories of Ferghaneh there are mines of gold and silver, and the district of Bestay Zeirin affords springs of bitumen or pitch ; and they say that in the mountains of Ashehreh there are fountains of naphta, and mines of copper, and of tur quoise stone, of lead, and of iron: all these are in the borders of Ferghaneh. In the mountains here they burn a kind of coal, and, having moistened the ashes with water, use it as soap in washing their clothes.

T he Reader will find, among the passages in the preceding ar ticle of this Appendix, a short account of the Boloujes, mentioned in pages 140 and 141 of the work. It is necessary here to point out an incongruity between Ebn Haukal's description of this people, and that of other writers. This, however, may be recon ciled, if we suppose (wiiat indeed occurs in every page of the ori ginal MS.) an error in the writing. For OJJjS o\j (they do not infest the roads J, we must read c X aj^j o!j ' they do infest the roads,' and alter the remainder of the sentence accordingly. I was induced to adopt this reading, from the concurrent testi monies of various Eastern Authors, who all bear witness against the character of the Bolouches. It will be sufficient to quote two dictionaries; first, the Ferhung Borhan Kattea (jUy UJjy, article —which thus ascertains the true pronunciation of the name: ^ j ejlj j Jjl j JJLc -J' j Bolouche —with the vowel accent damma on the first andAPPENDIX, No. II. 28y \ \ ' second; the third quiescent, with the Persian letter c/z/m, ' (/. e. with three diacritical points.)

If the origin of this extraordinary people were to become the subject of antiquarian investigation, the character of the ancient inhabitants of Hejaz (Arabia the Stony or Rocky) should be com pared with that of their reputed descendants; and I believe that such a comparison would in some measure confirm this traditional origin.

The same learned author, Sir William Jones, declares, that the ' ports of Yemen, (or Arabia Felix,) must have been the emporia of considerable commerce between Egypt and India, or part of Persia*.' But it was not merely a few traders or merchants that settled in Hindustan; according to a writer f quoted by Pococke, whole bodies of Arabians having emigrated from their own country, in vaded and occupied the territories of India, in an age of very remote antiquity J.

The following extract from the ancient Chronicle of Tabari is referred to in the Preface, page x, and may serve to illustrate Ebn Haukal's account of the Hamyaritick inscription on the gate of Samarcand. See p. 254, and 287. The transactions here recorded are said to have happened early in the sixth century, when Cobad, the Persian monarch, was slain, and his dominions invaded and plundered by the Arabs, under Samar, a nephew of the Tobba, or king of Yemen. The account of this invasion, and of Cobad's death, as related by Tabari, with a literal translation, will be found in the Oriental Collections, vol. iii. p. 150; where I have given it as a specimen of the most pure and ancient Parsi. The original Chronicle of Tabari was written in the Arabick language; and this Persian translation was made in the year of the Hegira 352, (A. D. 9^3), by a vizier of the Samanian princes*, who inserted many curious traditions and observations of his own. See the Preface, p. xii. * D'Herbelot, Bibliot. Orient. Art.

This city had a castle very strongly forti fied, in which the king resided ; one whole year Samar continued before the gates of this castle, without being able to effect any thing against it. At length he himself went the rounds, and took prisoner a certain man, one of the porters of the castle, and brought him into the camp, and said to him: ' What kind of ' person is the king ot this place, whose skill and ingenuity are ' such, that, after trying every stratagem for a whole year, I am ' not able to take this castle.'

These he sent on into Samarcand, and told them that he would place his army in proper disposition, and station them all round the castle; and he directed them, that when they should be within the city, they might open the lids of the chests, and come out, and ring bells (for he had given a bell to every man), so that he might know how matters went; and then they were to open the gate and let him enter with the army.

In the book entitled Tesmiah al Boldan, it is mentioned, that in those times Samar- — cand was called Cheen, and the Cheenians were there ; and these people first made the paper of the Cheenians. But Samar called this city after his own name. In Persian Samarkand (with the letter / ). Kand (OJJ^) in the Tartar or Turkish language signifies a city. But when this name was used in Arabick, it became Samarcand (with the letter j&gt;.) After this Samar led forth his army and proceeded into Turkestan and to Tibbet, &amp;c. &amp;c.APPENDIX, No. III. 299 The ancient tradition, here recorded, is unknown to most of the modern Persian writers, or, at least, unnoticed by them *. Emir Rauzi, however, in his excellent geographical compilation, the Heft Aklim, or Seven Climates, informs us that ocXAJICV j/ {j 1 ^ ' a person named Shamar who was of the family of the Tohha, « or sovereigns of Yemen, destroyed that city, so that no vestige ' remained of its (principal) building, (a castle of immense extent, ' and said to have been erected by Gurshasp, and repaired, at « different times, by Lohorasp and Alexander the Great). After ' that it acquired the name of Shamarkand (with the letter J) ' which the Arabs, according to their idiom, call Samarcand, ' with js).' The same account is given in the JJaih al holdan and other manuscripts, which agree in assigning to this city the highest degree of antiquity. If the tradition preserved by Tabari is founded in historical fact, we may suppose the gate on which the * I must also acknowledge that in one copy of T abari, in my possession, it is not found: but the other two preserve it. trom the more ancient of these, transcribed A, D. 1446, this extract has been given.

Hamayritick ins rlption was fixed, to have been that which the avaricious princess opened to the wily Samar; and it is probable that this inscription commemorated in the language of that Arab, the success of his stratagem, although we only learn from Ebn Haukal that it mentioned the distance from Samar to Samarcand. See page 254—28/, and Preface, p. ix, x, xi. The paper of Samarcand, to the manufacture of which Tabari alludes in the preceding extract, is celebrated by various writers. Although the Arabians do not pretend to have known the inven tion of it before the eighty-eighth year of the Hegira (A. D. 706), yet the use of paper was universal among the Persians and Chi nese in ages of more remote antiquity *. According to Ali hen Mohammed (quoted by the learned Casiri) the art of making paper was introduced at Samarcand in the thirtieth year of the Hegira (A. D. 050) ; and he adds, ' heretofore the use of paper was only known at Samarcand and ' among the Chinese.' , And Casiri f thinks it most probable that the Arabians learned it from the Persians or Chinese.
