R)'^K of French Bomber Aircrafts at the Hindustan A ircraft ^ Factory at Bangalore 1424. *Sri V. Gangaraju: Will the Honourable Member for External Affairs be pleased to state• (a) whether the attention of the Government has been drawn to the letter of Mr. A. Z. Sheriff published in Blitz, dated the 22nd March; (b) whether it is a fact that nearly 20 French Bombers are sent for repairs or over-hauling to the Hindustan Air Craft Factory at Bangalore; (c) whether Government are aware that the French Bombers are given priority; (d) whether Government are aware that the French Bombers are meant for the suppression of Freedom movement in Indo-China; and (e) if the answer to (c) and (d) are in affirmative, whether Government propose to consider the advisability of stopping this practice which is against the. wishes of the people of India? The Honourable Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru; I understand that this question will be answered by the Department of Industries and Supplies on a subsequent date. Mr. Manu Subedar; The part which relates to repairs will be answered on a subsequent date. Whether in view of the declarations of sympathy of this country towards those whom the French Government want to force into sub mission, will the Honourable Member tell this House whether he would look into such cases wherever the previous dBdarrrtionr tried to remain neutral ^nd not help one side or the other, particularly the aggressor side in case their equipments come here for repairs? The Honourable Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru: I am afraid I have not been able to grasp the Honourable Member’s question, but on the general trend of his question, I may be permitted to inform the House that we have been exceedingly careful that nothing should be done on behalf of the Government which might lead to help being given to the French in carrying on any military operations in Indo-China. So far as I can say off-hand, there were one or two cases of hospital planes being sent for repairs to Bangalore. I am not personally aware of a.single case of bomber being sent for repair. In pursuance of an old standing contract, some months ago a hospital plane had to be repaired and that could not be refused. In any event we could distinguish between hospital plane and ■fighting plane. To my knowledge not a single fighting plane was allowed any facility.Gfeneva Conference; ancl i a ^ i (d) whether Government propose to include re P[ e p el ^ a /^ e q ° CT tural interests, as represented by the Federation of Rural Peop s = ^ in the preliminary talks suggested and in the delegation. r The Honourable Mr. I.

Con ference have been consulted. (d) It is regretted that owing to shortness^ time it has rmt been petiole to include a representative exclusively of ajrfoulturol interests. The Honourable Member can be assured that several nuarfoers of the delegation are qualified to, and will safeguard, the interests of agriculturists.

Very few combat aircraft have flown across India,^these have first had their gun turrets and armaments removed. Services have been confined to the provision of fuel and other requirements for the onward flight, ' 2. -^and routes across India liave never been used by the French authorities for reinforcing their 'rmy in Indo-^hina. 3. An Air Agreenfent between the U.K. an$ France is under consideration wheisby the French Government will be permitted to use trans-Indic n air routes;/it is visualised / concession will allow passage for not more than ne aircraft each way each month though*-'the numbers ale not/yet firmly'Trtfed.

VJi&lt;— Pandit Nehru has already risked considerable criticism in allowing French aircraft passage across India on their vmy to Indo-China, and I think it would be most if the matter were now raised in the House of Commons. Would Mr. Henderson therefore consider asking Mr. Wyatt to withdraw his question?

The F rGnc h Government have already made it cleat that they are not prepared to sign the X n gi 0 F rcn *h Military air agreement until we have' obtained the approval of the Government of-India to their requirements. Under this agreement, we will obtain the long Term rigtit'to 'ope rate' our regular trunk route services, special fligjjte, ferry and ^efors aircraft across netroplitan France up to an itensity of ” aircraft per day, ^jj^par facilities will also be assured to us in Indo China. If the F rLnc h do not sign the agreement and refusv transit rights, all twin and single engined aircraft for Middle Bast and beyond will have to go by sea, and transport services will be limited to four engined aircraft operating at a considerably reduced frequency via Gibraltar. This will have a serious effect on the movement of priority traffic to all overseas commands. 4. The clearances at present outstanding arc as follows:- (a) 2 JTJ 52 *s from Saigon to Paris (A.95 February 5th). These aircraft arc us^-d in the transport role to supplement Dakota services. (b) Dakota No.759 from Paris to S a i S on (A.680) February 6th. ( NO* c; 3 atalinas which it is confirmed are ultimately destined for Indo China. 1 hey are endeavouring to rejoin their parent unit (8th Flotilla) stationed in Indo China* It would seen unlikely that these aircraft would be used for offensive operations against Viut Namoso forces* Under agreement, which vlll run for an intial period of 4 years, French requirement is a total of 18 military Transport aircraft across India each month made up of 2 weekly Da.kota/Ju *52 services in each direction and 1 monthly Halifax (Transport) service. Shis is n Ivory t. small ..flew when compared with the. rights mentioned in paragraph 4 above, which we hope to a obtain and is unlikely to influence appreciably the progress of French operations in Indo China. Similarly, it should be possible, by using H.A.F. airfields and staging facilities for these aircraft to pass through without attracting undue attention on the part of Indian nationals. /5.

W&gt;- ^ Please refer to 37 /l 0/47 or the 14th January about the transit of French aircraft through Burma. I enclose a copy of a letter dated January &amp;4th from the Burraa Office in regard to your enquiry, which seems satisfactory so far as routine movements of aircraft are concerned. I also enclose a copy of a letter which 1 have today written to Gibson at the Burma Office with reference to an interview which I had last Saturday with M. de Guiringeud. M. de Guiringaud originally came to see me because he had heard from General 3ailly, the head of the French Air Vransport Service, who was here for a few days, that there was some difficulty over the clearance for the transit through India of three or four Ju 52*8. I was eble to tell him that clearance for these particular planes h d been granted the previous day and that you had advised us of this. We then went on to discuss the request by the Governor of Burraa that the six Ju'ba's due to arrive at Rangoon on February 15th might be diverted so as to bypass Burma. I gave de Guiringaud the gist o.i the telegram‘from the Governor and of the Burma Office letter on this subject, copies of which I enclose. J. K. Coulson, KSq., BRITISH .MBASfY, PARIf. /M. de GuiringaudM. de Guiringaud undertook to ask Paris to make a study oi alternative r utes with specific reference^^ to these six ju’e and for any exceptional .iovements^ in the near future. Meanwhile I promised to see what could be done to persuade the Government of Burma to accept a regular transit of small numbers of French aircraft other than combat types On the subject of India I said that if there v/ere difficulties, th^ French Government mi?jht consider whether a direct approach by them to the Indian Government would not; yield better results than representations through our channels. M. de Guiringsud said that he would report this to Paris and asked me to confirm that the India Office were in agreement with this advice. #e have since received a letter from the India Office enclosing a telegram from the Viceroy which makes the same point and I have therefore coni irmed orally, to M. de Guirinjaud that there wi:1 be no objection to direct communication on this subject between the French representatives and the Indian Fxternel Affairs Department. I enclose a copy of the correspond ence with th^ India Office on this subject. I have shown this letter to Vihitteridge. Yours ever, Sign f d. C.

I am still receiving reguests for passage of French military aircraft latest being for an overfly by a- Halifax on January 31st and for a flight of 6 J.U fJ 52 expected to arri 1 in Burma on February 15th. The first request presents no difficulty but the second is a different question altogether. I shall have to piit Aung San in picture on his return and although I have (? given) (? provisional) approval to second request I # have pointed out in my official telegram 97 of date that if (? Government of Burma) get powers in relati external affairs it may well be that Government may take contrary action. 3. So.far there have been no (? reactions) in Press to these movements but l cannot guarantee that this state of affairs will continue.’ If Press do (? start) a campaign we may well expect it to be anti-European and much of the goodwill which I hope will be founded between H*M.G. and Delegation may be dissipated, * 4. I would strongly urge that if possible a different route bypassing Burma is taken by the 6 JotJ.52 due to arrive February 15th,A.M. Form 1700 ^*17871) Wt. 18613-956 250m. 7/46. T.S. 700.

This procedure is at present being followed but the Paris Embassy rang me up this afternoon in a state of considerable agitation, drawing attention to our telegrams Nos. 86 and 130 (copies of which I enclose) from which you will see that although the French authorities applied for clearance for the transit through India of three Junkers 52 and one Halifax over ten days ago, the sanction of the Government of India is still awaited. The aircraft are at present marking time at Tunis and the French authorities are very concerned at the delay. Gould t h e approval of the Government of. India be expedited? ^And could the French authorities be advised of the normal delay which is likely to occur between their making the applications and receiving a reply in future, so that they can plan the movements of their aircraft accordingly?

My immediately following telegram is a repetition of my telegram No? 19 of the 3rd January to Paris# 2# Clearance has now been obtained from Burma for this flight, provided aircraft proceed singly. 3. The Governor of Burma states that sympathy for both Viet Nam and for Indonesia runs strong and that the measures at present being taken by the French authorities in Indo-China are subject to considerable criticism in Burma# Should it become generally known that the Government of Burma had allowed unrestricted passage of French military aircraft through Burma the Government would be placed in a gravely embarrassing position, possibly to the extent of prejudicing the constitutional negotiations about to be held in t e United Kingdom. The Governor s consent in this case was given reluctantly after it had been pointed out that no alternative route was possible# 1# Difficulties are also likely to arise in India for similar reasons, particularly in view of &lt; Pandit Nehru’s press statement of January 7th deploring French action in Indo-China. 5. You should let High Commissioner know of strength of feeling in India and Burma. ^ u ha Y e been placed in a position of some difficulty by the too ready assumption that aircraft for operational^purposes can pass freely across Indian and Burmese territory.(F 6W6/56) Foma*, omen, S.F.I. 2 tb Januaryt 1917 .

Nevertheless, w© feel that we should &gt;erhaps point out that the Governor’s telegram under reference raises serious implications in regard to the Anglo-French Military Air Agreement which our Air Attach^ is at present in process of negotiating. The Air Ministry a tach great importance to the signature of this agreement* since if it goes through it will permit of British aircraft overflying .-ranee and French Dependencies and of their landing and refuelling etc.* at French military aerodromes. All work in connection with these landings would be carried out by the French personnel, which would of course result in a very considerable saving of r.a.F. manpower. Not only this* but the agreement w uld be of immense assistance in ensuring that our forces in the Far hast could* if necessary be reinforced by air. It is of course obvious fc^at if we refuse facilities to the French in British territory, we shall have correo ! ondingly greater difficulty in obtaining the facilities which we ourselves require in French territory. ho f *ench ex ect to operate ore Dakota per week in each direction on the France - Saigon route, in order to do this, they have requested* as a maximum* tliat Rangoon should (a) receive two French military aircraft in any one day; (b) provide up to 4,300 gallons of fuel in any one month; and(c) provide night aceo. imodation for 10 passengers and 6 crew. This ooois to us a modest request and unlikely to cause political trouble. We should be grateful, therefore* if you would consider discussing the problem with the Burma Office, pointing out the problem cf reciprocity which is involved, and asking then to confirm that the Gov rnor*s objection is in fact limited to reinforceLjent flights of the kind mentioned above and does not aoply to routine novernents of aircraft.

Secret, Dear Gibson, Please refer to your letter of the 3r&lt;l January on the subject of the passage of French military aircraft through Burma, I understand from our Embassy in Paris that clearance was obtained from Air Headquarters, India, for the flight of the Dakotas. Although it had also been applied for in the case of the other aircraft mentioned in the telegram from the Governor of Burma, the reply was still awaited. The vir Attache pointed out that traffic on the Far Eastern services had been fairly heavy and that although normal practice is to apply for clearance for each flight, it is usually understood that this is a routine formality intended rather as a warning that the flight is coming than as a request for permission. \ a realise the difficulties pointed out by the Governor of Burma in his paragnph k and have therefore requested the Air Attache in Paris to press the French authorities to arrange for the aircraft to arrive at Kangoon singly, \rrangements are also being made for the ore’As to be confined to camp on the way through* We have asked that in future a reply should be awaited to the applications made for clearance of French military aircraft in transit through Burma before their despatch from ranee.
