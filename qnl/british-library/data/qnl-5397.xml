I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, No. 1 / 2 1 &gt;iAF' ,942 FROM SECRETARY, EXTERNAL DEPT., INDIA OFFICE i—5th January,1942. No. 5 . (8^/1/42) Sir 1 ! 4 I | I 942 I have the honour to refer to your despatch No.83 (X 6097/062/503) of the 8 th August 1941, regarding the salaries of the munshis of this Legation, and to inform you that I am impelled by the still steeply rising cost of liv ing in Iran, and particularly in Tehran, to ask for a further increase in their cost of living bonus. 2. It has been impossible to obtain recent indices from the National Bank of Iran but the cost of living index which was issued, for oeptember-October 1941, was 220. Since then the prices of commodities and articles of every day use such as rice, butter and clothing, have continued to rise, although I have no exact measure of the increase in the cost of living 3. Various causes may be named as responsible for this incipient inflation: the temporary shortage of transport and distribution of trade caused by the disturbances of the autumn, the general increase in the wages and salaries of Iranian Government employees (which has been necessary for a long time past), and wholesale and retail profiteering (which is almost impossible to control without such an organisation as that which at present exists in the United Kingdom); but whatever the causes the fact remaains that a general rise in prices is in progress. 4. I therefore have the honour to request that the bonus of the munshis may be raised, as from the 1st November 1941, to 120$, to correspond with the September-Cctober cost of living index of 220 ; and that provisions may be made in the budget for 1942 for the further similar increases in the expenditure of this Legation should they become necessary. 5. I shall have the honour to address you separately on the question of the wages of the menial staff of the Legation. I have the honour to be, with the highest respect Your most obedient humble Servant (SOD) R.W. BULLARD The Right Honourable Anthony x.den, A . 0. , 1.

In order to control my estimates of what the wages of the menial staff should be I have obtained comparative figures from the Imperial Bank of Tran and the Anglo- T rani an Oil Company, and ha^e ascertained that were the prooosed increases granted to the 1 egation menial staff they would still receive less than similar workers in the town.

On present information Mr. Eden is not disposed to press for a larger increase for December Quarter 1941 than the £25 per annum already authorised, hut in view of the further rise in the sterling cost of living, i.e. an increase of 65;o between March Quarter 1938 and December Quarter 1941 it is considered fnat a further increase of £50 per annum for the married clerical staff and temporary secretaries and £15 per annum for the unmarried employees, should be granted with effect from the 1st January last. 3. In the case of Mr. Bishop, Archivist at His Majesty*s Legation, who was promoted to Higher Clerical grade under Treasury letter of the 29th August 1938 (E 6118/3), it is considered that, apart from the increase in the cost of living, the responsibiD.ty now falling upon him owing to the increase in the wor^; and stalf of the Legation, warrants an increase * )asic allowance from £25 per annum (unmarried rate) to £90 per annum, bringing his total emoluments to £619 as from the 1st January last viz:- , £ Salary (on scale £400 - £525) 454 Basic local allowance 90 Cost of living increase 75 (Temporary local allov/ance) £ 619 It should be added that in the normal course an increase of Mr. Bishop s local allowance of at least £50 a year on marriage would have been favourably considered if application had been' macte at the time. 4. I am to request that you will move the Secretary of State for India to sanction the above proposals. a ^moiety of the expenditure would be a charge on Indian revenues. 5.

Sir, I have the honour to re fer to y our teiegrain r\ n No. 1184 of the 13th December l94l # concerning the emoluments ^ 'o' clerical staff and the temporary secretaries of this Legation. 2. It is unfortunate that the facts and figures quoted in^ _dAapatch of Jthe^28th October 1941 were not considered at first sight to be suitable for submission to His Majesty’s Treasury. If the mode of presentation was at fault I can only express my regrets; but I feel compelled to point out that my recommendation was made with every regard to the need for economy and that the proposed general increase of £25 per anniirn is quite inadequate in the majority of cases* 3. It approximates most nearly to the 10;5 bonus which I advocated for the unmarried staff (excluding Mr. Kelland but including Mr. fillis) and f if His Majesty’s Treasury prefer to grant an increase of so many pounds rather than a percentage bonus I see no alternative to the bachelors’ accepting the £25 per annum increase* However I mentioned in paragraph 11 of my despatch under reference that I see no prospect of a fall in the cost of living here (on the contrary, since Iran can never institute such a control of profiteering as that of a western country, the cost of living is bound to continue to rise) and it therefore seems wiser to grant a percentage cost of living bonus which is more easily adjustable. fu- J •&gt; ft*, | 4. As regards the married members of the staff I shall have the honour to address you separately about the established officer, Messrs. Bishop and Gamble, and will consider for the moment only*Messrs. Reeve and Buckley (temporary secretaries) and Messrs. Davis and Samson (unestablished clerical officers). For them the offer of £25 per annum increase of salary is, I regret to say, wholly inadequate* The increases fohi-ch my proposals would involve are as follows: Salary Increase Mr. Reeve Mr. Buckley Mr. Davies Mr. Samson £ 570 £ 500 £ 400 £ 410 £ 114 £ 100 £ 80 £ 82 - 10. All the increases were calculated as exactly as possible to meet the prevailing conditions and no allowance was made for possible ’’paring'. 5. I have been very satisfied with the work of ray staff hitherto. They have given of their best during periods of pressure and they have been slow to complain of the financial/ The Right Honourable Anthony Bden, P.C. , M.C*, M.P., etc. etc. etc* FOREIGN OFFICE, 2 . «• 1 *financial strain which has increased during the last year, in spite of the fact that the salaries of similar employees in Tehran show only too clearly their unfavourable position. The British clerk of the United Kingdom Commercial Corporation in Tehran, who does work similar to that of an archivist, receives £885 a year, and their confidential typist receives more than £580 a year* These salaries may be generous since the employees have hardly any prospects after the war, but they are not inordinate and they point to the reasonableness of the bonus which I have suggested* 6* It is perhaps unnecessary to add that with the' best of will in the world an employee will not do his best work when he is in financial straits; and indeed if adequate increases in salary such as I have advocated are not granted there is always the possiblity that some members of the staff will feel themselves obliged to resign* I might mention that under the Qrder-in-Council of 27th November 1941, regarding the British staff of the Anglo- Iranian Oil Company and the Imperial Bank of Iran (see your , tele gram No* 1095 of the 27t h November last) I am not empowered tcTrefuse to release employees unless I am satisfied that the employees are prepared to continue their employment on reasonable financial terms* Should members of ray clerical staff tender their resignation in accordance with their contracts, I should not feel justified in retaining them against their will.* I have, etc., 1 (Signed) R*W.

I must confess that I did not at the time realize the full implications of the present arrangement but the attached memorandum shows the situation only too clearly: Mr. BISH0P ! s net emoluments for the last year were £383,15,0d. Mr. GAMBLE’S were only £418,-,-d in spite of the fact that he has two children and receives allowances for them. 3. For the other members of the clerical staff I have re commended a cost of living bonus of 2 ^ to meet present circum stances, but having now examined Messrs. BISHOP’S and GAJiBLS’s income and expenditure I am satisfied that such a bonus alone would not meet their case. Were it applied, Mr. BISHOP’s and Mr. GAMBLE'S net emoluments would still fall short of a reasonable living income. 4 . It will not be disputed I think that the salary aid allow ances of an established Government servant must be sufficient to allow him to marry and have children, and that those living abroad must have regular opportunities of taking home leave so as not to lose touch entirely with their own country. It is therefore clear that, if the scale of Messrs. BISHOP's and GAMBLE'S salary cannot be altered at present, their local allow ance should now be reviewed. 5. For Mr. BI3H0P I have the honour to propose that in the first place a local allowance (non-taxable and non-pensionable) of £100 a year should be granted to him. This would bring his emoluments to an adequate level in normal time. In the second place T propose that he should receive a cost of living bonus of 20 -fj for the present (on the same basis as the other clerical assistants) on his total emoluments, to meet the unusual, though not I fear ephemeral, circumstances which prevail at present. 6 . ^or Mr. GAMBLE I have the honour to propose that he should no?/, after so many pears of loyal and competent service, and more than five years as an established clerical officer, be promoted to the higher clerical grade, and that he should re ceive £100 a year local allowance with 2CK cost of living bonus on his / The Fight Honourable, Anthony Eden, P.C., M.P., M.G., etc. etc. etc. FOREIGN OFFICE, London S.W. 1.on his total emoluments, as I have proposed for Mr.BISHOP Mr. GAMBLE, although nominally assistant archivist, is acting as Chief Cypher Officer and takes charge of all the Mission’s confidential locks and keys and correspondence relating to them. He discharges his duties with exceptional thouroughness and I warmly recommend his promotion. 7. Should it not be considered possible to promote him I can only propose as an alternative that his local allowance be increased from £92 f !3,6d to £150, and that he should also re ceive a 20 &gt; cost of living bonus on his total emoluments. 8 . For the sake of convenience I have diown the result of my proposals in tabular form as enclosure ( 2 ) to this despatch: and I recommend that they be made applicable as from October 1st last. 9 . I trust that the proposals will be strongly recommended to His Majesty’s Treasury since it is of prime importance that these two key members of the Legation staff should receive ade quate emoluments. The figures which I have proposed are the lowest which I consider adequate. 10. I have the honour to request that the replies to Mr. BISROP’s other questions may be sent to me in due course by bag, but in view of their serious financial situation I shall be grateful if I may be informed by telegraph of the decision regarding Messrs. BISHOP’S and GAMBLE’S salary and allowances. I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Sgd.) R. W. BULLARD.I do feel there is justification in asking for an increase in my local allowance - I cannot live and save for leave or emergency on £580 a year. .A glance at the Foreign Office list will show that ray local allowance is the lowest paid to any Archivist and with twentythree years service to ray credit: I have to swallow hard when I see the salaries paid to war time employees elsewhere. Horae leave and to do this I Have to save which is quite im possible as things are: with the present cost of living steadily rising here and the need to put by for leave I do not consider that a local allowance of £250 would be asking too much.

Existing emoluments are based on a rate of exchange of 120 Rials to £1 and a currency cost of living figure of 138 as compared with the present rate of 140 Rials to £1 and the last published currency cost of living figure of 209.5, and Sir Reader Bullard accordingly recommends increases of 20 % of the emoluments of married employees and IQfc in the case of unmarried employees. 3. It is not considered that in present circumstances such increases can be justified but on the other hand it seems clear that existing-Emoluments are inadequate. 4. I am accordingly to request that the Secretary of State for India may be moved to sanction increases of £25 per annum each to the clerical staff and temporary secretaries with effect from 1st October last, subject to review in the event of an appreciable alteration in the sterling cost of living. i I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant The Under-Secretary of State India Office. \J. v/ Copy . Tx 9883/562/503) No. 166 (212/10/41). 8254 28 th Ote tobJrffi ^9^1. j Sir, /S A v I have the honour to refer to vour despatch No. 103 At^i^ if \f* &lt;0^ (X 7495/562/503) of the 26th September last, in which you stated that the emoluments of my staff should continue at the existing rates subject to review in the event of an appreciable variation in the cost of living in Tehran as measured in terms of sterling. 2 . I regret to inform you that since I last addressed you on this subject not only has the local cost of living index risen but also (see the correspondence ending with your telegram ho. 8 48 of the 4th October) the rial-sterling rate of exchange'Nas'Tallen from 174 to 140. 3. The Banki Melli Iran have not yet published rial cost of living indices for the three months June 21 st-September 21 st, but they have provided a member of my staff with the provisional figures for the two months June-August: 198 and 209.5 respectively. These figures do not cover the period during v/hich Iran was invaded and occupied (a period in which, despite our good intentions, the people of Iran have suffered from a sharp and general rise in prices) • I believe it to be conservative therefore to estimate the average rial cost of living index for the September quarter at 210. 4. On that basis it will readiljr be seen that the sterling cost of living index, while the rate of exchanged remained 174 rials to the pound, was 123, as compared with the 99 of the June quarter \ ^ Cl of this year ( see my despatch No. 109 of the 15t h August 1941). ^ i/hen the rate fell to rials 140 to the po~uh&lt;37Ton September 29th) the local cost of living index was, according to my estimate, 220 or more, and the sterling cost of living index rose at that momeiit to 140. 5. Such a sharp rise naturally means financial embarrassment to all members of the staff, but in particular the clerical staff of the Legation are hit very hard since a large proportion of their salary (a minimum of 75;* according to my estimate) is spent on the purchase of rials. For that reason I considered it advisable to examine their position at once, and not to await the publication by the Banki Melli Iran of their much-delayed final indices. Should His Majesty’s Treasury wish it I will telegraph the figures when they are published, but I trust that it will be possible to afford compensation in advance on the basis of my estimates as shown in paragraph 4 above. 6 . I attach a list of the emoluments of the clerical staff for ease of reference, since their rates of pay vary v/idely. They are in three main categories; (l) established civil servants (Messrs Bishop, archivist, and Gamble, assistant archivist); (2) temporary clerical assistants (Messrs. Davies, Moore and Ellis) on a time scale; ( 3 ) temporary assistaiits engaged since the outbreak of war at a fixed salary (Messrs. Samson and Kelland). 7. The position of the established clerical assistants, after more than 20 years service at this post, is particularly The Right Honourable Anthony Eden, M.C., M.P., etc., etc., etc., Foreign Office, London, S.W. 1. ^CLOSE IN WEEKLY LETTER bad/ N' ) i FRO,! ScCRETAftY, EXTERNAL DEPT. 'A FPCEbad, since they have to pay United Kingdom Income tax on a salary scale which I believe to be in any case inadequate. Mr. Bishop, who is married though without children, feels himself quite unable for instance to lay aside any money for the regular home leave which a man in his position should have. Mr. Gamble, who is married and has two children, is unable to provide either for the education of his children or for home leave. The position of the temporary assistants is little better, although they pay no income tax. Mr. Davies is married, and Mr. Samson is married and has one child. Both are having difficulty in making ends meet since the sterling cost of living rose to 140. 9. The bachelor members of the clerical staff (I count Mr. Sllis among them since he is able to support his wife in England on a small pension from the former Indo-European Telegraph Department) are not so hard hit: they can almost meet expenses at the present rate; but they are precluded from laying aside any savings. After considering their position very carefully I feel that, in view of the present need for strict economy, a smaller compensation as outlined in the following paragraph will be adequate for tnem. Moreover, I would exclude Mr. Kelland from these provisions for the present, since he himself agrees that his emoluments, which are higher than those of his colleagues, are sufficient to cover the present cost of living. TO. It v/ill be remembered that I annexed to my despatch .No. 109 of the 15th August 1941 a table which showed percentage variations in the £ cost of living from the standard fixed in the first quarter of 1958 by Kis Majesty’s Treasury, when the emoluments of the Tehran staff were last established. Its basis was explained in paragraph 4 of my despatch under reference. It v/ill also be remembered that at the end of the June quarter this year the £ cost of living index at Tehran was 99 (i.e. practically par); and I have shown in paragraph 4 above that the average £ cost-of-living index for the September quarter 1941 was about 125, while that at the end of the quarter was about 140. 11 * It is, I believe, unlikely that the cost of living in Iran will fall, while the new rate of exchange is unlikely to be raised, and one may therefore safely assume that the £ cost-of- living during the December quarter 1941 will continue to be at least forty points above par. 12. On the other hand, as I remarked in paragraph 5 of my despat£lLJiQ.__ 109^ my staff have since 1938 benefitedT'at' times from temporary falls in the £ cost-of-living index, and I therefore recommend that they should receive not a cost-of-living bonus to cover the whole 4051 increase in the £ cost-of-living but a bonus to cover a proportion of that increase. I suggest that a percentage cost-of living bonus of half the increase be given to the married clerical officers (i.e. 201 ) and that a similar bonus of a quarter of the increase be given to the unmarried clerical officers (i.e. 10 ^), for the period 1 st October to 31st December 1941. This bonus, which would be calculated on the total emoluments, should be tax-free in order that the two established clerical officers may obtain the full benefit from it. 13. I suggest moreover that such a bonus (of i and^ of the percentage/f' 1 ■ . I N-i.i percentage increase of the £ cost-of-living) he sanctioned provisionally for succeeding quarters, subject to your periodical approval. If the suggestion is accepted I should telegraph to you the latest available cost-of-living index towards the end of each quarter, together with the rate of bonus to be paid in the following quarter, asking for your telegraphich approval.

Sir, With reference to ^oreifrn Office Aeepetch ^ o 1 2F8 (X B635/568/50S) of the nth September, 1939, T have the honour to etnte that I have received an ©rmlication from the monshies of this Legation for a honnfl on account of the higher cost of living resulting from war conditions. 2. I have re-oxanined the question of the local coat of living and, while I an unable to state the exact extent to v/hich war conditions are responsible, I am satisfied that the continued rise in the cost of living since the rate of bonus for the rmmshies was last fixed has been such as to Justify the present request. The cost of living index publislied by the National Bank of Iran, which was 138.4 at the 20th Jarch, 1939 (see paragraph 3 of Sir Horace Seymour 1 s despat ch Fo. 209 of the 22nd June, 1939), had risen to 176.5 at the 19th ^ebru-~ ary, 1941. These published figures, as Bir Horace Seymour pointed out, are tmllkely to exaggerate the position, and I can confirm from the case of my private servants, to whom I have granted a war bonus, that conditions have become consider ably more difficult for employees whose salary is fixed in rials. 3. ’Tiile I consider that conditions Justify an increase in the emoluments of the nunshies, I do not know what is the attitude of His Majesty T s Oovemmept towards the grant of war time bonuses. I therefore have the honour to submit the following three alternative proposals; (a) That the basic rates of salary of the rnimshies which at present are; Hials 1200-1.500 ' 900-1200 ” 800-1000 3rd raised to: 1st **unshi 2nd ' w ■Tin shi H ' 1350-1650 ' 1050-1360 ' * 950-1150 of the rnunshien should enter the new scale The Right Anthony Men, .u., • r •, etc., etc. etc., vnun p u ■Mb*r^e scale at the point corresponding to that which he has reached in the old one. This would mean that each would receive an increment of Rials 160 per month (Rials 26n # 50 with honns at 76&lt;). The present rate of 'bonus would allow ample margin for reduction should the coat of living decrease. (b) That the rate of bonus be raised by a further 80 to 95^. This would mean, on tne basis of present rates of pay, that the 1st, 2nd and 3rd munahies would receive increments of Rials 270, 190 and 160 respectively, (c) That the munshies should receive cost of living allowances, subject to revision at stated intervals, at the following rates: 1st Hunshi , Rials 270 uer month. 2nd tf ' 260 M ' 3rd ” M 220 M - 4. Of the above alternatives, I consider that (c) comes the nearest to meeting the needs of the three munshies fairly, and would urge that if possible it should be adopted. x I have the honour to be with the highest respeet, Sir, Your roost obedient, humble Servant.

Ilease see the minute at P.Z.1468/37 flagged. The subordinate native staff at Tehran Legation were granted an increase from 30/6 to 45 ^ on their basic rates of pay with effect from the 1st January, 1937&gt; to meet the rise in the cost of living. H.M. Minister now puts forward further strong arguments for an additional increase of 35^ bringing the total increase to QOfi, The reasons he gives are the continuous upward rise in prices in Iran which has been accentuated by the conditions brought about by the war, and the importance in the present time of having a contented and loyal local staff, free from debt. The suggested increase is not unreasonable as the Munshi’s rate of bonus has already been increased to 75^ with effect from the 1st July, 1939 ( see P.Z. 4507/39 flagged). The normal complement of subordinate staff at the Legation has been approximately 10 Ghulams and 20 menials, but owing to the increase in the number of Indian orderlies from 3 to 9 a t the outbreak of war for the protection of the Legation, it has been found possible to reduce the number of subordinates to 9 Ghulams and 17 menials, plus the addition of a temporary servant in the winter months, to attend to the heating of the offices. The pay roll has thus been reduced to Rials 7877*25 P er mensem representing a reduction of Rials 11 52 .75 P*m. An increase to 80^ would bring the pay roll to Rials 9780 p.m. Although in 1936 the Official buying- rate for Rials was fixed at 80 to the £1, the unofficial exchange rate now fluctuates at a much more favourable rate and the Minister mentions that the last Foreign Office bill was sold for Rials 206 per £, which means a decrease in the pay roll from roughly £98 p.m. in 1937 , when the additional increase of bonus was calculated at Rials 80 to the £1, to £38 p.m. at present rates, or assuming that the increase in bonus is granted, to £47 p.m. Against this apparent saving in the pay roll is offset the increase in the number of Indian orderlies.2. 1 The Minister also asks for sanction to the grant of a language allowance of Rials 20 per mensem to those employees who attain a satisfactory knowledge of English. His reasons are that experience has shown that the utility of the menial Iranian Staff is greats hampered by lack of English, and that the award of a non-recurrent grant within the limit of £4 authorised in 1933 does not offer sufficient inducement to work for the examination. Both the proposals are reasonable, and it is not thought necessary to consult the Government of India before agreeing. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted. Financial Secretary. v-&lt;f 0 For your observations. From P.Z.8J4/^8 (flagged on the fij-e attached below) you will see that in 1938 permission was given by t|ie Foreign Office to the Minister at Tehran to purchase Iranian currency at unofficial rates to meet official requirements of the •- t « Legation, owing to the increasing disparity between the official rate of exchange and the purchasing power of the currency. The pay roll of the native staff has therefore fallen considerably when calculated in sterling. d Ww* O to A 4 . 4* A M . to* A. A4 .

The increase in the rate of bonus payable to the subordinate staff from 45$, the rate sanctioned in your letter of the 31st March 1937 (P.Z.1468/37),to 80$ appears reasonable, in view of the rise in the cost of living previously reported, and I am accordingly to request that the Secretary of State for India in Council will approve the proposal to increase the rate of bonus,and also to grant language allowances of 20 rials a month,to those employees who attain a satisfactory knowledge of the English language. 3.

My Lord, I have the honour to inform you th^t, i s awt *cipated in para^aph 6 of Sir H. 80 ^ 0 ^* o despptoh ifo^2Q9 of the 22nA June 1939, I have received an application for increase of pay, to meet the rise ia the cost of living, from the Iranian subordinate staff of this Legation. The bonus payable to this section of the staff was lest fixed at 45# in 1957 (please see Foreign Office despatch No. 122 ^ (X y627/366/503) of the 6th April 1957), and the movement in prices has borne *ith erven greater wei ght upon the subordinate staff than upon the munshis. In addition, the conditions brought about by the war that has supervened since the question 8 r^vlewad in June last, have accentuated the upward lovement of the rial cost of staple articles, and at the same time they have rendered greater then ever the importance of xieving a contented and loyal locel staff, free from debt. I therefore beg leave to request that the cost of living bonus of the ghularaa, farraehes, gatekeepers and miscellaneous local subordinate staff msy be raised, as In the case of the muashla (Foreign 0 fries daspp.toh iio. a 58 (x 8635/563/603) of the 6th September 1939) by a further 35*, making a total of 80*, as from the 1st January last* 2. The normal complement of this staff in the past few years hes beexi as follows*— 10 ghulams. 8 farrashes (1 -eluding telephonists, end chaixcsry, consulate, commercial secretariat, and dispensary office servants# The Right honourable The Viscount haliffjc, K.i., eC. . O.C.I. ., etc., etc#, etc•, Foreign Office. 12 • • •%others (including 6 gatekeepers* end 6 miscellaneous* such as watermen, etc*). The arrival at the beginning of this year of the six additional Indian sowars* whose engagement was authorised in Your nordship 1 s telegram :o. 98 of th- September last, has enabled me to make the following reductions in the Iranian staff:- (a) Discharged on lot Jcmary 1940:- 1 ghulan at Kials per month# I forraeh at Kials 533*50 per month* 1 gatekeeper at Rials 23£.00 per month. (b) 1 farrash ciepeiised with on the HiA December 1939 wi s not replaced at the tine; and the vacancy was filled on 1st January by causing 1 gate‘cooper at jU'i&amp;ls -u;J5k» to become a farrash at his predeceasor*s wage (; iala S61).

Ths cost of this must be set ngni.ast ths figure meniioaed in the preceding paragraph during the winter months only* 4. After ^1lowing for ;he reductions mentioned in p«re&gt;(raph 2* the present pey-roll is: — 9 ghul ins Rials .^252.00 7 f err ashes ?l 1530.00 4 gatekeepers and 6 miscellaneo us' 1650^10 Total Riels 6432#10 lotul With 45 fc boi, u « .

The last Foreifpi Office bill was sold for ^iials 200 per £$ which moans that the same pay-roll now coate approximately 33*3.0, find the proposed figure of :ttals 9780 would coat approximately £47.9* u# Consequently, apart from the absolute saving sffooted by the reduction of the numbers of the Iranian staff — though I realise, of course, that this has been offset by the present necessity of increasing the number of British Indian staff - the relative effect of the proposed adjustment of wages to the rial cost of living would be to substitute a monthly gain in exchange of £50. li*0 for one of £59.17.6. 5. The fact that the Indian sowars, whose pay is fixed in rupees, recently benefited to the extent of 140 for exetxan^© reasons adds further point to the applioation which had already been toads by the Iranian subordinate staff before this came about. 6 . There iw one further that has recently been brought seriously to iny attention, namely the desirability of encouraging the subordinate staff to acquire some xnowlodgs of English. Experience as shown that taeir utility is greatly impaired by lack of this, that considerable inconvenience, muddle and delay may be caused in matters connected with non-resident. and even resident, British subjects and others, wh do not ':nov 7 Persian, ©specially where the telephone is used (and its use is rapidly increasing), and in the case of persons having business at the consulate. /ixpericncQ has likewise suown that the award of/of a non-r^current grant within the limit of ^4, authorised in Foreign Office despatch 320 of 1st August lio3, docs not offer sufficient inducement to compensate for the time and money expended in tn' ing lereaone# Since the award was instituted, only four persons have offered themselves for examination, and none, in spite of re eated exhortations, since 1935. I am convinced that the only remedy for this important defect, and the only way to get a really useful Iranian menial staff, is to institute a regular addition to the monthly pay of those who can pass a suitable examination in English* I think that, since the aooomx&gt;lishmont represents the same achievement, whether acquired by a senior or a junior employee, the allowance should not take the form of a percentage of the basic or total salary, but that of a flat rate of iliale 20 per month (not excluding those persons, three in number, still on the staff, who passed an examination in 1933 and 1935 and drew a grant). I should be glad if this proposal could receive Your Lordship’s consideration. I might add that the presence of Indian personnel in greater numbers does not remedy the defect, since the Indian sowars have hardly any knowledge of English, and have generally to be addressed ih Persian or Hindustani.

'* Please see the Minute at P.Z* 2555/37. Letters from H.M. Minister at Iran radvimn a revision in the rates of pay of his subordinate employees are becoming almost a matter of routine thanks to the uninterrupted rise in the cosiP of living in Iran. It would seem from the file (vide P.Z.2841/37 and P.Z. 2436/33) that in 1935 the three munshis emploi^ed at the Legation were in receipt of a basic pay - excluding Koruz gratuities and Gulhek rent allowance - of rials 1450, 1150 and 850 p.m. respectively (rising by biennial increments of rials 50) plus a bonus of 25$. In 1937 this bonus was raised to 40$ in view of the rise in the cost of living. A moiety of the additional cost was accepted by the Government of India. The present letter from the Foreign Office recommends that an increase of the bonus on the basic pay of the munshis from 40$ to 75$ be sanctioned in .w/^6 accordance with Mr. Seymour^ proposals. They iwniost, however, that this increase should take place as from the 1st July and not the 1st April as Mr. Seymour had suggested. Mr. Seymour documents his recommendations v/ith a cost of living index which certainly indicates the need for an upward revision of rates of pay and he also shows that the pay of local Iranian employees underwent an average increase of 38.5$ between 1937 and 1939. It is not to be supposed that he Y/ould make these repeated requests in rapid succession without good cause, and it is proposed, as on previous occasions.to accept a moiety of the extra cost involved as a charge on Indian revenues on the understanding that the Treasury accept a charge for the other moiety. seems absolutely necessary it has not been thought essential to consult the Government of India before agreeing thereto, but it cannot be said, as in 1937, * * that the fall in the rial exchange rate will offset to the additional cost Indian revenues, for in 1936 the exchange rate was peggeiL by the Iranian Government at 80 rials to the pound sterling^ vide D.O.T. Report • ♦ on Economic Conditions in the Persian Gulf, page iv, published in December 1936. A draft letter to the Foreign Office is submitted. of the salaries (i.e. basic pay and bonuses) of the three munshis should now be approximately 5,250 rials p (£65.62 at 80 rials to the £). The proposed increase in their bonus from 40;b to 75% will bring this to rials 6282.5 p.m. (£78.53). The munshis are paid in rials and if H.M.G. and the Government of India have to obtain these rials by exchange at the official nominal rate this will involve approximately an extra£L3 p.m. It is to be observed that the British members of the Legation staff are paid in £s. and recently their As this increase in the pay of the munshi^ % Financial Secretary According to my calculations the total cost salaries were reduced , vide P.Z. 3333/38 since currency is now obtainable at unofficial rates. In 1938 the unofficial rate was not less favourable than 120 rialsMinute Paper. ($) Department. to the £. According to the Westminster Bank rials can now be obtained at 140 to the £. If therefore the munshis v/ere paid in sterling it would be possible not only to offset the cost of the rise in their bonus but also to reduce the charge on Indian revenues below the existing amount (at 140 to Rials 6282*5 is only £44*87). This assumes that the payment of the munshis involves the direct purchase of Iranian currency. But while it may be legitimate to pay English employees in sterling this not ^ so where the payment of non-English employees is concerned.

The cost of living figures quoted by Mr. Seymour show a rise of approximately 35$ since their wages were last reviewed, and the recommendation, which involves an increase in the present total emoluments of the munshis of 25$, appears to be justified. 3. I am accordingly to request that the Secretary of State for India in Council may be moved to sanction the increase of the bonus on the basic wages of the munshis from 40$ to 75$ as from the 1st July, 1939. 4. A similar letter has been addressed to the Treasury. I am. Sir, V/My T .ord # X have the honour to state that X have received an application from the Munshia of this iegation for ari increase of pay. In consequence of the continued rise of the cost of living in Tehran. 2. fhe phenomenon is not new. It has been explained in my despatches No. 29 of the 22nd January 1937, and No. 113 of the 2bth J^arch 1937, In which the cases for revision of the pay of the menial staff and the unshis were last reviewed, and as a result of which tne bonus of the menial staff was raised from 30 to 45 by r* Nden’a despatch No. 122 oi the 5th .April 1937, (X 2627/366/503), and that of the unshis from 25 to 4Cr; by his despatch No. 206 of the 3rd June, 1937, (X 4200/366/503) It continues without sign of abatement, and is the general result of the Iranian Government’s policy of maintaining an artificial exchange, nonopolising all commerce, and financing a rapid and ambitious programme of expenditure by constant imposition and augmentation of taxes, customs, monopoly dues, and restrictions that create scarcity in one commodity after another - in other words, the basing of values by all sellers, including the government and its numerous monopolies, upon a constantly falling black bourse. 3.

The position on which the last review of pay was hased in the despatches referred to above was roughly that corresponding to ,tne 21st ^ece.ib- r, 1936* Taking this into consideration, together with the continuation of the rise since February last, and the fact that the figures ior Cost of living refer to the whole country, whereas certain commodities (notably rents and all forms of service) are notoriously higher in Tehran than elsewhere, I am of the opinion that a rise in costs of 36 since the last review of the pay of tne local staff is no exaggeration. 4. The increases in pay received by local employees of similar, and of slightly higher status in the Imperial Hank of Iran’s Tehran office show an average increase of 36.5 between the 20 th Inarch, 1937 and the 20th March, 1939# The Bank do not employ our system of basic pay and bonus, and this includes increments that would regularly have been granted; but the increments have been considerably augmented to keep pace with the cost of living, and the highest paid of these employees (now receiving Rials 6,000 per month) represents a grade beyond that of any of our l unshis, and by so much further removed from the subsistence level.' 5 # i would add - though I do not consider normal increments and promotion to be really relevant to the coat oi living - that the recent promotions of Mr* Samlal and ; r* apir» approved in Your Lordship’s despatch No* 5 of the 5th January last, (X 12724/229/505), have not for the time being much improved their financial positions, since they had already reached the rates of Rials 1,200 and Rials 900 in their previous ranks, and entered their new ranks at the minim im rates, which are ide. ticai with the above. X mention this in connection with the urgency rather th n the justice of their request* 5 , The general considerations set forth in this despatch apply not only to the Punshis but to the menial staff, arid I believe it probabl^ that I shall in the near future receive some similar request for increase of pay from the latter.

My Lord With reference to Sir John Simon’s despatch - No. 495 of the 25th September, 1935 (X 5717/1589/503), I have the honour to inform you that the second and third Munshis on the staff of His Majesty’s Legation have represented to me that it is now impossible for them to find adequate houses at Gulhek for the amounts authorised in 1935 as their Gulhek rents allowances. 2. There is no doubt that since 1935 the rent of houses in Gulhek and the other villages of Shimran, as in Tehran, has risen greatly, while the increase since 1937 has been particularly sharp. With the growth of the capital and the concentration there of the greater part of the country’s wealth, the demand for houses in Shimran has inevitably grown and has outstripped the supply. A contributory cause of the rise in rents in the village of Gulhek is the fact that since the extension of the barracks in the neighbourhood, many houses formerly available for summer letting are now taken all the year round by officers and their families. In many cases rents have risen even since 1937 by 50% or more. A house next door to the Legation compound, let in 1937 to an Attach^ of the French Legation for Rials 4,000 has been let this year for Rials 7.500. This is perhaps an exceptional increase, but tne house taken by Mr. Samimi last year for Rials 2,000 has already been let to another tenant for Rials 3,000 The/ The Right Honourable The Viscount Halifax, K.G. , G etc. , etc•, etc G.C.S.I. ,The house taken by the Consulate clerk, ^r. Jordan, for Rials 1,800 in 1937, has been let for Rials 2,500, while for that taken for Rials 1,500 by Mr. Sapir in 1937, which was not adequate for his needs. Rials 2,200 is now demanded. Many more instances could be quoted, but I am satisfied that the present level of rents at Gulhek is such that the allowances now authorised are no longer adequate, and that an increase is fully justified. 3. In my despatch No. 102 of the 12th March, I had the honour to inform you that Mr. A.H.Naimi, First Munshi, had tendered his resignation, and I suggested that he should be allowed to take six months’ leave on full pay from the date of the return of Mr. Samimi from leave, about the 30th June next. In view presumably of the fact that he will not be working for the Legation at Gulhek during the whole of the summer, Mr. Nairn! has not submitted a request for an increased rent-allowance. In your despatch No.70 of the 1st March (X 1692/376/503) you instructed me to consider the possibility of dispensing with a third Munshi. I have been awaiting your reply to my despatch under reference regarding the resignation of Mr. Naimi before submitting to you a report regarding the need for three Munshis. In any case, I doubt if it will be possible to dispense with the third Munshi for some time. With regard therefore to Gulhek rent allowances I have the honour to recommend that these should now be fixed in principle at Rials 3,000 each for the First and Second Munshis and Rials 2,500 for the Third Munshi, and that for the present year Mr. Sapir who will become Second Munshi on Mr. Naimi’s retirement, should receive Rials 3,000. 4. Since rents must be paid in advance and houses must be booked very soon, I should be most grateful if sanction for these allowances might be obtained at an early date, and communicated/communicated to me by telegraph. I much regret that it should be necessary for me to ask for a decision at such short notice, but my attention has only just been called by the Munshis to the position. 5. I would venture to suggest that, if the suggested increase is sanctioned, the Department of Overseas Trade might be informed accordingly, in order that a similar increase in rent allowance may be sanctioned for Mr. Sepehri , Munshi to the Commercial Secretary.

A Please see the Minute at P.Z. 2555/37. The wages paid (in rials) to the Munshis and menial staff of the Tehran Legation were raised from 1st April, 1931, again from 1st October, 1932, and yet again from 1st January, 1937, in order to meet the increases in the cost of living in Persia. The present salaries of the clerical staff were fixed in 1930, hut as they are paid at sterling rates the depreciation of the rial (which v/as 60 to the £ in January 1930 and is 80 to the £ now) has given them an automatic increase in local currency v/hich has sufficed to offset the rise. 2. H.M. Minister now represents that the cost of living has far out-run currency depreciation, and he has recommended strongly that the salaries of the six members of the clerical staff should be increased by £50 per annum in the case of the two established clericals and by an increase in scales £380-£440 lo aBd £430-£480 per annum in the case of the four unestablished clericals v/ith effect from 1st January last. The Foreign Office recommend that an increase of £40 per annum each should be granted v/ith effect from 1st April, 1937, and subject to review by 30th March next. 3. The Minister makes out a strong case, and, subject to Treasury acceptance of half the cost, it is proposed to approve the increases recommended by the Foreign Office and to accept the other half as a charge on Indian revenues. The limitation of period is a safeguard against the possibility rather^ the probability ( since in theory it should do so) of the depreciation in exchange overtaking the rise in the cost of living.£ 4. The increased charge on Indian revenues involved in the proposal as it stands amounts to £120 only, and it is suggested that this may he accepted without reference to the Government of India, particularly as they have recently agreed to^increaseethe pay and allowances of thre Indian pensioners employed at the Legation by 15 per cent, in direct correspondence with Tehran (P. Z. 5367/37). e( Draft Paper, p.z. 6432/37 political Department, ^ The Under Secretary of State Foreign Office. ’ 1 Sir, (iCOj '1 l iuue We , N -r ETT .

S.W.l 28th September, 1937. Sir, ! I W V, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to state that he has recently received representations from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran strongly urging the necessity of an increase in the emoluments of his clerical staff in view of the general rise in prices which has brought the currency cost of living figure to a point where it far more than offsets the depreciation of the rial since 1930/31. 2. In view of the facts put forward in the enclosed copy of Mr. Seymour’s despatch, Mr. Eden has no hesitation in recommending to the favourable consideration of the Secretary of State for India that an increase of £40 per annum should be made in the local allowances of Mr. Bishop and Mr. Gamble and that the four unestablished members of the staff, Messrs. Hewitt, Abbott, Nangle and Haines should be granted similar increases, all with effect from the 1st April 1937 (instead of the 1st January last) and subject to review by the 31st March, 1938. This course would seem preferable to an alteration of the scales of the unestablished members of the staff, the effect of which would be to grant increases of differing amounts, according to the point reached in the salary scale. I am. Sir, Your obedient Servant, % The Under-Secretary of State, India Office. \Sir, I have the honour to acknowledge with many thanks the receipt of your despatches rf08.1££ (X £627/366/503) and 206 (X 4200/366/503) of the 5th April and 3rd June respect ively , sanctioning an increase of 15;S in the bonus payable to the Munshis and menials on the staff of His Majesty’s Lega tion. I am most grateful for these decisions. 2. in the present despatch I would submit for your consideration a proposal for an increase in the salaries of the clerical staff. I regret that it should be necessary to trouble you again so soon with a request for increased expenditure on salaries at this post. But,as will I think i be evident from the succeeding paragraphs of this despatch, the conditions which have made necessary an increase in the pay of the Iranian staff,are pressing equally or even more heavily on the clerical staff,and leave me no alternative but to recommend that the salaries of the clerical staff should also be increased. 3. The present salaries of the clerical staff were fixed in 1930. {14a*. Bishop and Mr. Gamble have since been established,but their total emoluments remain at the maximum of the scale then fixed,with the addition in Mr. Bishop’s case,of a personal allowance of £50 as Archivist). It will be remembered that in his despatch No.llO of the 5th March 1934,Sir Reginald Hoare stated that he considered that these salaries were inadequate and recomraer''?'* that they should be substantially increased. la reply he was informed,in Sir John Simon's despatch Ho.209 (X 2216/463/603) of the 28th /April The Right Honourable, Anthony Sden MeC#,M.?#, etc •, etc•, etc•, The Foreign Office, LOJtDOJ'S.W.l./If (oS t April 1934,that no increase could be recouuonuea to the Treasury unless it could be shown that the sterling cost of living figure for Tehran had risen appreciably since 193o/31. It is unfortunate that I cannot now appeal to an up-to-date official sterling cost of living figure to show that this rise has taken place. The last currency cost of living figure communicated to His Hujeety 1 a Legation is that for 1933/34,namely 34 )• But 1 am confident that the facts and figures which I shall quote will show that taking the whole range of the expenditure of the clerical staff,there has been sihce 1933/34 a general rise in prices which has brought the currency cost of living figure to a point where it far more than offsets the depreciation of the rial since 1930/31. 4. I uia aware that this rise in prices is not fully reflected in Form A36 for Tehran,which will shortly be for warded to you. But the figures there given cover in the main local primary products rather than imported and manu factured goods. It is the cost of the latter which has risen most sharply. Further,the prices given in Form A36 are average prices for the year 1936/37,whereas prices,which had remained fairly steady during the first part of that year,rose rapidly during the second pr**. This is shown clearly in the enclosed extract from the Bulletin of the iiational Bank in which the average for the year is taken as 100 and the cost of giving index at the end of the year 1936/37 is shown as 109.6. There is every reason to believe that this figure will have increased still further during recent months. The rise in the cost of local food stuffs and other produce was illustrated in the table of comparative prices enclosed in my despatch No.29 of the 32nd January. The Bulletin of the national Bank speaks of 'la /hausse- 3 - /e'/y hausse ginerale et presqu© saita treve'. While I think I need eoarowly stress it further in this despatch,I have the honour to enclose a further table of typical nrices of local products.showing the percentage increase or decrease from January 1935 to Kay 1^37. It will be seen that in the great majority of oases there have been large increases since the last currency cost of living fi,?ur© was calculated. 5. The rise in the cost of local produce is of course only one of the factors contributing to the increased currency cost of living for European members of the staff. It has itself.together with social changes such ae the unveiling of women,been the inevitable rt ause of a second factor,namely an increase in wages. All labour costs have risen steeply,and during the past two years private servants^ wages hf ve risen from £5 vsk 4a'. vven so members of the staff of the Legation are subject to constant pressure from their servants for increased wages. 6 . But even more important from the point of view of the clerical staff is the rise in the cost of imported and manufactured goods. In the last year thia has been startling. Its causes may be sought,in addition to the general tendency to increased prices,in the heavy customs duties imposed by the new Customs law,in increased transport charges owing to the dislocation of the laotor transport industry,and in acute exchange difficulties. I have the honour to enclose a table of prices of manufactured products for the four years from 1933/34 when the last currency cost of living figure was established. It will be seen that in both imported and in looally•manufactured goods there have been enormous increases,amounting in many oases to loof or more. The present prices of almost all imported goods in Tehran can only be described as fantastic. Tennis balls /have -have recently been selling for 4 / 6 d* each ,flnA the cost of wany other articles is almost equally high. Thet of imported alcoholic drinks is almost prohibitive - whisky costs 24/- a bottle,vermouth 22 / 6 d.,imported beer 5/6d. rphe clerical staff enjoy no customs exemption, and must buy everything in the open market. They remain in Tehran for long periods at a time and are therefore unable regularly to replace their clothes and general outfit in England. They are thus obliged to buy nany absolute necessities locally. Further,in considering the coot of different items of their expenditure.it Bhould be borne in mind hovrf greatly conditions of life difter in Tehran fro® those in England. Tehran provides few of the ordinary amenities of life.no theatres.no cheap excursions; even its cinemas are bad and dear. Oames anc private entertaining are its relaxations,so that tennis rackets and tennis bells, golf clubs and golf balls,alcoholic drinks and the like, wnien might elsewhere be regarded as luxuries.must here be necessities if there is to be any reasonable recreation. These items therefore cannot fairly be excluded from a calcu lation of the true sterling cost of living for tne clerical s taff. $ # j am sure that it is tie desire of His Majesty’s Government that the clerical, staff of lUs Majesty* 3 ..egation ytIiq loyally work long hours under octillion* which are often trying,should be able to maintain a reasonably good standard of living,and should be able from their salaries to make provision for savings and for leave expenses so th^i they can take the home leave that they undoubtedly require alter their long periods in Tehran. After a careful examination of the facts,I ara satisfied that these conditions are 10 : being fulfilled. The olerioal staff are now scarcely ableto make both ends meet without falling into debt. still less can they put anything by for old age.or even for leave expenses. Hr. Bishop is doubtful whether he ean take the home leave due to him this year and Hr. Gamble,who has a wife and child,at present seos little prospect of being able to go homo next year. The clerical staff are undoubtedly now suffering real hardship through the severe rise in their sterling coat of living. There is no reason to foresee any fall and I therefore feel it my duty to recommend that their emoluments should be increased. 9. Since Mr. Bishop and ? r r. Oanble have now been established,any change in their emoluments must be made in their local allov/ancas which .as stated in your despatches Bos .443 and 457 of the 31th October and 12th November 1936 respectively,are subject to review in the event of any change in the sterling cost of living. I would therefore recommend that the local allowances of Mr. Bishop and j'v. Gamble should be increased by £50 per annum. in the case of the four unestabliahed members of the clerical staff - Mr. Hewitt,Mr. Abbott,Mr. ijangle and Mr. Haines,! would recoro.?iond that the salary scale should be raised from £380/£440 to £43o/£480 per annum. I would venture also to request that,as in the case of the Iranian staff,the increases should be payable from January 1st last. The increases recomraendeci seem large but X consider that they are fully Justified by the situation. I would most earn estly beg that every effort should be made to obtain for them the sanction of tho Lord Conmissioners of the Treasury. I have the honour to be with tne highest reeoeot, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) H.J. Seymour- 6 - P.S. Since the above was drafted, I have learnt that the Imperial Bank of Iran have decided that in view of the rise in the cost of living,their European staff in Iran should be paid at a rate of 90 rials to the pound. The Bank staff have thus received a rise of 12.5 per cent. (SgcU) K.J.5.FIL C COPY JiJSjSy % ^ ^ ^ British Legation, Tehran• JJis 11th February, 1937- Lty lord Marquess I have the honour to request consideration uj. two questions with regard to the pay and allowances of the three pensioners of the Government of India who are employed as orderlies at this Legation. The men in question are Jahen Khan, ex-trumpet-major Muzaffar Khan and ex-sowar Khuda Bakhsh. The extension of the period of service of all of these men has recently been recommendeu at my request to the Adjutant-General. 2. As the cost of living in Tehran has risen considerably of late, I have written to request His Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to obtain a further temporary bonus of 15% on the pay of all menial staff who are paid from Foreign Office accounts. A copy of my despatch about this matter is enclosed. I am convinced that the Indian orderlies here, have considerable difficulty in living on their pay at present, and I should be grateful if Your Excellency would authorse me to increase their pay and allowances, though not their pension, by whatever bonus is sanctioned in reply to my request on behalf of Foreign Office employees. Were I to defer recommending this bonus for the oruerlies until after a reply has been received about the Iranian employees, the former would be at a temporary dis advantage and for that reason I venture to suggest your provisional agreement to a rise of pay. 3. A year ago when the veil was forbidden for Iranian women, the, local authorities advanced a month's pay to subordinate employees to enable them to supply the * extra clothes for their womenfolk. The Foreign Of!ice sanctioned .....sanctioned a special grant oi a month’s pay to all married members of this Legation for the same purpose. Though the wives of British subjects could not legally be compelled to discard their veils, it seemed advisable for their own sakes to make it possible for them to do so, and this extra month’s pay was given to two British employees here. One of them was the orderly Jahan Khan paid rials 247 as this extra allowance. This sum was charged in Foreign Office accounts but as Jahan Khan is paid only from Government of India accounts, the refund of this amount has been requested by the Foreign Office.

It will be remembered that Sir Hughe Knatchbull- Huge seen in his despatch No. 282 of July 1st 1935 requested the grant of a rent allowance at Tehran to the two senior munshis or, alternatively, an increase in their normal pay. Although Sir Samuel Hoare authorised the grant to the munshis of increased rent allowance at Gulheq in his despatch No.495 of September 25th 1935 he considered (vide hie despatch No. 389 of July 24th 1935) that in the absence of a further appreciable increase in the cost of living, the circumstances did not warrant the grant of a rent allowance at Tehran or an increase of pay, apart from increments as they accrued. 3. It will be evident from the figures which were transmitted with my despatch under reference that there has, since that time, been a general increase in the cost of living and I would only point out here that this increase has in ight Honourable Anthony Eden M.C., M.P., etc. , etc. , etc. , THE PORE ION OFFICE,&lt;7U Ko. 38 a. : 84~ • ' 1 y j British Legetion, Tehran. 1st July, 1935.

Kirza Hussein Khan Naimi, the head Munshi, has served for eighteen years in this Legation; he is a married man with two children at aohool. The second Munshi, Miraa Ahmed Khan Samimi, has sixteen years service here and he is also a married man and has three children ofSchool age. 3. Throughout their long service, both these men have worked efficiently and willingly. as they are no longer young, they naturally feel more anxiety about the future, against which they are not aole to save, nor can tue w count on any pension or provident fund. I am quite convinced that their pay is considerably below what their work and services should command and there is, moreover, no doubt that the cost of living for them here has risen again during the last three years 4* The list of prices enclosed with the last application made on their behalf, ay predecessor *s despatch Ko* 414 of the 26th September, 1932, has not cnanged The Sight Honourable /appreciably.

The Munshies, moreover, must try to follow the considerable social cnanges here and these changes, whether connected with education, emancipation of women, clothes or entertainments, all cost money. The European clothes, including evening dress, which Iranian men and women are M&amp;uy encouraged to wear, are an expensive item* 5. The bi-annual increase of Rials fifty (twelve shillings and six pence at the present rate of eighty) a month for which they will be due in July will be quite inadequate to meet these extra charges. Including this small increase, which was authorised by Sir Austen Chamberlain’s despatch Mo. 283 (X 3549/46/503) of the 7th June, 1929, the basic monthly pay of Mr. Naimi and Mr. samimi will be Rials Rials 1,450 . one thousand, four hundred and fifty (eighteen pounds, two ^16 ; 2 ; 6 . shillings and six pence) and Rials one thousand, one hundred Rials 1,150. and fifty (fourteen pounds, seven shillings and six pence) ^ ^14 ; 7 ; 6 . ‘ ' respectively.

I have the honour to enclose a list of the salaries of such Munshie* Some of them, it is time, do more confidential work of the kind done here by the oriental Secretary himself, but none of them, I am sure, have such a volume of work to transact, Prom the Imperial Bank of Persia I learn that they have a .tuneni in Tehran of ten years service who only reoeiw«« but others of the same or shorter service in the Bank have passed on to better paiu posts with hopes of still further promotion. In the Iranian Government service also, men have hopes of promotion to the higher grades of the Civil Service and some pension rights, whereas our l^unshis cannot look forward to any change of work or greater responsibility to encourage them and keep them contented. Their*s is routine work which, as regards correspondence anyway, has enourmously increased in recent years (one thousand and ninety one notes and letters were despatched to the Ministry for Foreign Affairs in 1934 as compared with five hundred and I venture to urge strongly that some further help should now be given to the two senior I^unshis.

Sir, I have had under consideration your despatch No.282 of the 1st instant, regarding the wages of the senior Munshis at His Majesty’s Legation. 2. I observe that these employees are in receipt of lower rates of pay than the liunshis at other Missions, but it appers that the latter must perform more than routine duties, and that the duties, and possibly the pay, of the Munshis at the Ministry for Foreign Affairs are more analogous to those of the Munshis at His Majesty’s Legation. 3. In 1929 the Munshis were granted scales of pay which at the maxima amount to an increase of not less than 20%. On cost of living grounds they received an increase of 15% in 1931 and a further increase of 10% in 1932, and in the absence of a further appreciable increase in the cost of living I do not consider that the circumstances warrant the grant of a rent allowance at Tehran or an increase of pay, apart from increments as they accrue. I am, however, prepared to consider the grant of actual reasonable rent for the accommodation leased by the Munshis at Gulhek if the present allowance is inadequate. 4. It is stated in paragraph 3 of your despatch that the Munshis cannot count on any pension, or provident fund, but I would remind you that they are eligible for compassionate gratuities on retirement in accordance with Foreign Office circular despatch No. X 10175/10175/505 of the 16th December,1921.

Sir, ?&lt; r ith reference to paragraph 3 of your despatch Ho. 389 (14589/1589/503) of the 24th July, I have the honour to submit the following considerations in support of a recommendation for an increase in the rent allowance payable to the imnshia of His uajosty's Legation in respect of the rent of houses at Gulhek. 2. The rent of a three or four roomed house with a small garden in a healthy quarter is not leas than from one hundred and eighty to two hundred tomans. Thus the rent of Mr. Gray*8 house of three rooms, verandah and garden is two hundred and twenty tomans, and that of Mr. George’s house is two hu-dred tomans. The payments actually made by the three MUnshia this simmer are as follows: Mr. Raimi is paying Rials two thousand four hundred for the rent of a reasonable house, thus overspending his rent allowance by Rials one thousand three hundred and fifty two Linars fifty. Mr. r&amp;mimi has a hot and decrepit house with a small garden at the bottom of the village bazaar, for which he pays Rials twelve hundred. He thus is not over spending his allowance appreciably this year, but his house If The Right Honourable Sir Samuel Hoare Bart., G.C.S.I., etc., etc., etc..

Sapir has spent very nearly exactly the amount of his rent allowance, but his house of four small rooms with no garden ht*s to house six persons and is in a bad atate of repair. He would also be very grateful for an increase in his allowance to enable him to tuke an adequate house next year. 3. I venture to submit that in view of the facta st ted in the preceding paragraph, it is clear that the rent allowance no granted to the ifUrishis is not sufficient to cover the rent of an adequate house for the summer at Qulhek. I therefore have the honour to recommend that the irst and Second ?Tur.sni 3 should be granted an allowance of the actual house rent paid up to a limit of Riale two thousand and that the Third Ifunshi should receive an allow ance of actual house rent paid with a limit of Rials one thousand five hundred* I have the honour to be with the highest respect, Sir, Your most obedient, humble Servant, (Signed) H.M.Knatchbull-Kugessen h iJ Copy No. 495 PORNIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1 (X 5Y17/1589/503) 25th Septembsr, 1935 Sir I have had under consideration your despatch No. 374 of the 23rd utlimo regarding the rent allowances paid to the Munshis of His Majesty’s Legation. 2.

The subordinate native staff attached to the Tehran Legation (consisting, it is understood of 10 ghulams and 21 menial staff) v/ere accorded, with effect from 1st April 1931&gt; an addition of 23 per cent, to their basic rates of pay, which was raised to 30 per cent, from 1st October 1932. H.M. Minister now recommends that the addition should be increased to I 4.5 per cent, from 1st January 1937&gt; having satisfied himself that the recent increases in the cost of living in Tehran are causing real hardship to these members of his staff. These increases are due, in part, to the rise in the price of commodities* and in part to the westernising movement in progress which,^by the extensive abolition of old property and the erection of new houses, has led to a rapid rise in rentals, and by the compulsory abolition of the' veil has doubled the expenditure of a married man of the poorer classes on clothing for his wife. Moreover, t^e^Persian income tax is now payable on incomes from £30 per annum upwards. The rates of wages of comparable menial staff in Tehran have been increased during the past year. The cost of the Tehran Legation is divisible between Imperial and Indian revenues, and it may be presumed that the Treasury are prepared to approve the Minister’s proposals. Since the sterling value of the rial has fallen by half since the basic rates of pay were fixed, and the total increase will be less than half the basic rates, the sterling charge will not be more than that originally contemplated, and it is proposed to sanction the increase as on the previous occasions, without reference to India.P.T . iM-bs^-jr /?3 Draft Paper. v n Pert Department. /&gt;.

Sir, I am directed by Mr. Secretary Eden to refer to your letter of the 22nd November, 1932 (P.Z. 6 416/ 32) and to transmit herewith a copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran recommending that a further increase of pay should be granted to the subordinate native staff at His Majesty’s Legation. 2. There does not appear to have been any considerable increase in local commodity prices since the wages of the staff v/ere last increased in 1932, but the increase in rentals and westernization of the mode of living in Tehran is causing hardship to these employees. 3. I am accordingly to request that the Secretary of State for India in Council may be moved to sanction the increase of the basic wages of the subordinate native employees of His Majesty’s Legation as from the 1st January, 1937 by a further l5;i, bringing the bonus to 45‘J. 4. Even v/ith this increase and possible future good service increments after 6, 12 and 18 years’ service, the maximum total v/ages of the majority of these employees will be considerably less than the maximum of the new scale for second class employees of the Iranian Government. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant, u Q /TtnSZfifV '—‘A - The Under-Secretary of State,^29 (14&amp;/2/57) Signed Original by Bag A/2. Secretary* 83nd January f 1937* Sir, I have the honour to inform you that some months ago a petition was submitted by the menial staff of this Legation for an Increase in wages to meet the increase in c &gt;at of living at Tehran* I have delayed in submitting theii' case for your con sideration until I have satisfied myself that the inc ease is indeed a serious one and one which, unless it la compensated by some corresponding increase in pay, will be the cause of real hardships* 2* In the following paragraphs I will endeavoux* to outline some of the facts which have contributed to this increase in the coot of living# 3* In the first place the gener 1 level of food prices, as shown in the enclosed list, which lias been drawn up on the lines of the A forms submitted annually by Ills Majesty’s Gonawl at Tehran, has risen appreciably during the last year# The cost of various other items not Included on this list but which never theless form an important part of the Persian’s diet has risen even more considerably# Thus, oil which a year ago cost Rials 15 per man now coots Rials 32 per nan# *Kast H , a staple food, coat Rials 3.30 a man a year ago and is Kials 3#60 a man now# Similarly the prices of Imported foodstuffs of all kinds, largely as a result of the new customs tariff and the new exchange con trol restrictions, snow u big inc ease as compared with those /of The Right Honourable Anthony Men, M.C., *f#P#, etc*, etc*, etc*, The Foreign Office*of a year ago* 4* The rise In the price of foodstuffs does not f however, ' \ reflect the full extent of the rise In cost of living as it hears on the menial staff* Owing to the vast amount of build ing which is at present talcing place in and around Tehran, the value of building land has advanced enormously* Countless hovels have been destroyed and in their place new and more substantial houses are being erected* A great many of these latter are not yet complete and as a result rents, which at any time fom a considerable item in the expenditure of the menial staff, have risen in some oases by as much as 80 or 90 per centum* One instance has been brought to ray notice in which a servant who a year ago paid Rials 70 per mensem for two rooms is now pay ing Riels 110 per mensem for a room and a cellar* In another instance a ferresh receiving a total salary of Rials 338 per mensem is now paying Rials 150 per mensem for the same accomo dation which four years ago cost him Rials 80 per mensem* 5. A further Inc ease in expenditure has been brought about by the discarding of the '‘chadur*. In your telegram No, 30 of the 30th January, 1936, you were good enough to authorize the grant of an extra month’s wages to the menial staff to meet the sudden extra charges which had been put on them in this connec tion and I have no wish to request that tills gr*mt should be repeated* At the same time it cannot be denied that the discard ing of the ,# chadur* has caused a permanent increase in the expenditure of all married Persian employees* The ’•cbndur* hid a multitude of deficiencies* Now that it is g*ne and women and their daughters are obliged to appear in public un veiled, money must be spent on hats and coats and dresses all qualities of which are dear out of all proportion to the ser vice which they are 11Rely to give* 6* I will endeavour to quote a few examples* In the days befor the discarding of the chndur, all that was required in the way /ofof headgear waa a scarf wrapped round the head # Two such scarves would suffice for a year and could he boj ht at a coat of Rials 10 each. How hats must he worn and even the cheapest of these costs Rials 50. The same hat cannot serve for sumer and winter so that annual expenditure on this item now amounts to Rials 100. 7. Similarly where a servant could before buy a ’’chadur* for his wife at a cost of Rials 300 or Rials 250 and could expect it to last for two if not three years, he must now buy a coat at a cost of Rials 400 which at the most can only be expected to last for two years. 8. It is difficult to generalize, but from examples which have been quoted to me, I can state with certainty that if a servant might reasonably expend Rials 300 annually on his wife’s clothing before the discarding of the ^chadur*, he is now obliged to spend double that amount. 9. One entirely new charge, that of income-tax, has been added to the expenses of the menial staff in recent years. The income-tax law of the 16th December, 1934 reduced the minimum for salary liable to income tax which had been fixed by the law of the 30th ifovembei', 1933, at Rials 420 per men sem to Rials 200 per mensem and in that way embraced the salaries of almost all the menial servants of the legation who since the 22nd March, 1935, have been obliged to pay tax at the rate of 1 per centum on their wages and *No Rouz’* gratuity* 10. Admittedly this is a small charge in itself, but coupled with increased Municipal taxes, road taxes aad monopoly taxes on various commodities it has not been without its effect on the budgets of the menial staff. 11. The extent of the general rise in the cost of living has already been recognized by the Iranian Government who have not only increased the pay of their more senior officials but /have6 only from the point of view of alleviating hardship but also from the point of view of keeping abreast of other employers and ensuring that our staff have no reasonable sense of grievance a general rise in wages is now imperative* 16* In his despatch flo * 651 (X 6934/UV505) of the 29th November, 1938 f 3ir .John Simon was good enough to inform sir H*H* Hoare that the Lords Commissionera of His Majesty’s Treasury had sanctioned further temporary increases of ten per centum of the basic wages of the munshia and of five per centum of the basic wages of the ghulans and the menial staff and that these wages would be subject to review in the event of a material change in the cost of living at Tehran as measured in currency* 16. I shall have the honour to address a further despatch to \you concerning the position of the munshis but I would now re- IQueot that, in view of the considerations which I have outlined above, the basic pay of all members of the menial staff should be increased by a further 15 per centum as from the 1st of |l i January, bringing the total bonus on their basic pay to 45 per centum* { } * 7 , ) 17* This bonus is small when it is rembered that Iranian currency has within the last twelve years dropped to half its value both in terms of sterling and in its purchasing power of such prime necessities as bread, cheese, tea and firewood and that the standard of living has vastly altered, especially in Tehran, during that period* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

A copy of the Government of India's letter of the &amp;6th April (P.Z.3105/34) was sent officially to the Foreign Office in accordance with the wishes of the Under Secretary of State. The Foreign Office in their reply which is below state that in applying for Treasury sanction for the creation of these posts they were merely following the procedure usually adopted by them* and that ~fhe sanction was intended to be contingent on the Government of India concurring in the proposal and agreeing to bear half the cost involved. Moreover the two Yice-Consulate posts have not as yet been filled. It might therefore be possible to argue that the Foreign // Office have not created or added to the establishments and services under its control without the consent of the Government of India. It is unfortunate that the wording of the Foreign Office letter of the 15th November (P.Z.7438/33) was not a little more explicit, for the proposal seems in itself to be entirely reasonable. The general reorganisation of Consular posts which has been going on in Persia since 1931 has considerably reduced the cost of D. and C. expenditure in that country, and has reduced the number of Consular Officers there to a bare minimum. Some r £ T A 4 932 1934 171 2t( 5000 3/33 sort of leave reserve does,in the circumstances, seem to be essential for the maintenance of efficiency, and it is accordingly proposed to suggest to the Government of India that they reconsider their decision not to contribute towards the cost of the two proposed posts.

Lc—gr 3 Minute Paper, Department, •^N ^4^—^ ' 1 ^ U ' ^ C^y £? n tytijw The G-. of I.’s attitude in their letter of 26th April seems to have been largely due to their supposing that the question had been settled without their being consulted. This, as we anticipated, turns out to be a complete misapprehension. The case now made out by the F.Q. for the two additional posts seems to me a fairly strong one. It is to be hoped that the G-. of I. will consider it sympathetically. This seems to me desirable for the following reasons. On broad grounds, it would be unfortunate if the G. of I. were too meticulous in objecting to expenditure which the Treasury, having regard to the necessity of economy, are nevertheless prepared to sanction. We have to obtain Treasury concurrence in any new expenditure, above trifling limits, which the G. of I. propose in connection with their posts in Persia. In recent experience we have very rarely failed to obtain that concurrence. If the G. of I. object unduly to H.M.G.’s proposals, this happy state of affairs may not continue. And the important point to bear in mind is that, whereas the total expenditure in Persia is , halved, the proportion of that expenditure which is incurred at Indian posts is very much more than half of the total. It will be seen from the attached summary of the account for 1931-32 (the last year available) that India spent £72,254 and the F.O. only £40,610, but, in 2119 5000 8.33 spite/spite of this disproportion, the net result of the account is that India received from H.M.G. a sum of £14,765. The main reason of the disproportion in expenditure is the higher cost of the staffing of the posts by the G. of I. The conclusion which these figures suggest is that if mutual objections to new expenditure should become • * the rule rather than, as at present, the rare exception, the G. of I. have a larger surface exposed to attack than H.r.G.Enclosure 1 Diplomatic and Consular Expenditure in Persia.

I nevertheless enclose a copy of the semi-official letter from him on which we decided to approach the Treasury.Copy (K 6149/11/234) r-\ h R ? R ^ U Z„ J British Legation, Tehran. 4th May, 1934. C ny dear Scott, The difficulty that recently arose over Hoyland’s leave has led me to review rather carefully the whole question of our Consular establishment in Persia. 2. Leaving aside theoretical appointments like that of O’Dwyer to Isfahan, the present establishment is somewhat as follows Tehran 1 Oriental Secretary. Trott. 1 Consul. Brenan. 1 Assistant Oriental Secretary Summerscale. 1 Probationer Gamble 1 Probationer Gault ( Hesht. 1 Vice-Consul, combined with Assistan Oriental Secretary.) Tabriz 1 Consul Palmer. Ke mans hah 1 Consul - Shiraz- Isfahan 1 Consul Hoyland Ahwaz 1 Consul Watkinson. Bushire 1 Vice-Consul Baillie. J 3. In this list I nave assumed that Hoyland will be transferred to the new Shiraz-Isfahan post, but it makes no difference to the argument that follows whether he or some one else goes there, I have also omitted all mention of D. J.M.D. Scott, Esq., The Foreign Office, /the London■ ' —r— the Commercial Secretary, 'because I think Gray should in future he able to act for him when he goes on leave without a relief from the Levant Service being required, - unless indeed the pressure of work were especially great* 4, Anyhow, the list shows a total of eight posts (if Resht and the Assistant Oriental Secretary are counted as one) all of which are filled except one (Kermanshah) and also two supernumeraries for reliefs, 5, May I now ask you to consult the 1928 Foreign Office List for a moment? It shows that the following officers were then serving in Persia, not counting Lingeman or Abbas Quli Khan:- Havard Brenan Finch Davis Forester Calvert By res Monypenny Gardener Bristow Cowan Chick 0 1 Dwyer Gilliat-Smith, a total of fourteen, 6, There were, it is true, three more posts, Resht, Isfahan and Hamadan (the Vice-Consulate at Meshed was not yet in being) making eleven in all. But the fact remains that there were three supernumeraries available for acting appointments (four if the Assistant Oriental Secretary were counted) against two (or three with the Assistant Oriental Secretary) today. This may not at first sound a great difference, but quite apart from the fact that in a small establishment a single man does make a lot of diff erence, [^there is a vital change in the /positionfa : r~ /there /-N position today in that our two supernumeraries have attached to them conditions (that of doing five hours study a day) which places considerable restrictions upon their usefulness. The probationers in the olden days had, of course, to do some study, but generally speaking they were available for any job that came along. In this particular year I have been able to send Gamble to Shiraz and Gault to Kermanshah without seriously offending my conscience, but I cannot be sure thau conditions would be equally stagnant another year, and in no year would it be possible for Probationers hampered by similar conditions to act at Ahwaz ob Tabriz or to be of serious help at the Legation. ~] 7. The existence of the supernumeraries in past years can, I think, be ascribed to the fact that it has always been recognised that Persia, like China, needed what was in fact a ’’leave establishment”, that is to say, a number of officers virtually regarded as being permanently on leave. The mathematics of the question are worth dwelling on for a moment. A Consular officer in Persia receives 42 or 56 days leave a year according to his seniority: we can call it 50 on an average. He receives a further 30 days once in two years for being in a country which is unhealthy for purposes of leave, say another 15 days a year, making 65 days a year. To this must be added the time taken on his Journey, say 30 days every two years, or 15 days a year, the total being 80 days a year. 8. Each Consul is therefore away from his post on an average 80 days a year. 80 goes into 365 about 4j times. Assuming that we had nine Consular officers in Persia (actuallyisr - ''' there are ei^ht according to the list above) we should need two whole time supernumeraries who would be continuously employed in taking the place of one or another of them. The difference between eight and nine can, however, be regarded as cancelled by tiie fact that the two remplaQants themselves would need a rempla 5 ant for about a fifth part of each year. 9. .These figures are based on the supposition that Officers take their leave consecutively one after the other regardless of the time of year. In practice they do not. There are occasional exceptions, but as a rule people serving out here like to take their leave in the summer, because they can travel and enjoy themselves more in Europe at tnat time of the year and because in that way they avoid a series of hot seasons in Persia. This is a perfectly natural desire, and to force people who spend their lives in countries like this to take winter leave against their will would be quite inhuman. 10. Mathematically this summer leave complication should, mean that the number of supernumeraries would need doubling, as all the leaves would be taken in the same half of the year, but in p&amp;ctice I will be moderate and only suggest that in order to meet this complication it is necessary to increase the number of supernumeraries from two to three. 11. I will not trouble you with the details, but an exact analysis of the posts falling vacant through leave in the coming twelve months and of the officers available to fill them leads to the same conclusion that /threesupernumeraries three whole time, that is, 'study-free', are necessary. 12. To come to definite recommendations, what I have in mind is as follows:- (a) there should never he less tnan two 'study-free' supernumeraries in Persia, based on Tehran. By 'study-free' I mean that though they may still have examinations to pass they can he called upon to do a full days* work. When Gamble and Gault have emerged from studying stage they will fill the hill and now that one is here and another expected shortly there is, of course, no point in replacing them before then. But their successors should already he 'study-free' when they arrive. (h) in addition to these two the Foreign Office should have ready to place at the Minister’s disposal every Spring one more supernumerary. In some years he might not he required, hut in other years as many as two extra supernumeraries might he necessary. The principle should he that the provision of rempla 5 ants for those going on leave each summer would he a normal duty of the Foreign Office who would adjust their establishment accordingly. 13. I do not for one moment dispute the principle that leave is a privilege, hut I am sure you realise that if officers in this country come to think that their leave is liable to he delayed when due, and even when it is overdue, not because exciting things are happening or may happen in their districts, which would he quite another thing, hut because the administrative machine is not functioning properly, the moral of the service is bound /to/'&gt; ■=rzr~~ s 7 to be affected. Provincial posts in Persia are no fun, and it is only fair to those who fill them that steps should be taken in &amp;ood time to provide their reliefs when their leave is in sight. 14. I sincerely hope you will be able to make something out ol all this and to restore the position that has always prevailed in the past. Yours ever, (Signed) p.h.

S. In applying for the sanction of the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty’s Treasury for the creation of these posts before ascertaining the views of the Government of India, the Secretary of State was following the procedure customary on such occasions v/hereby Treasury authority is obtained, but not acted upon, before a definite proposal to the Government of India is made and accepted. The two vice-consular* posts concerned in the present proposal have not, therefore, as yet been filled. 3. With regard to the second paragraph of Mr. Metcalfe’s letter, I am to state that creation of two new vice-consular posts will by no means furnish a fall reserve to enable consular officers to proceed on leave, and that these posts are intended merely to provide the bare minimum required for the efficient administration of His Majesty's consular posts in Persia. I am to add that, even taking into account the cost of these new posts for 1934, there is still a substantial decline, as compared/ The Under-Secretary of State,' i’ ccmpared with 1933, in the figures for diplomatic and consular expenditure in Persia, on posts controlled by this department* 4* In these circumstances, I am to express the strong hope that the Government of India will be prepared to meet half the cost of the two additional vice consular posts* I am, Sir, Tour obedient Servant,— -- — —■ I. --^=xggfB£Z&amp;rzr- DHrai COPY .

On the 15th November they forwarded to the India Office a copy of this letter (but not of the Treasury’s reply) and said that the Treasury ’’sanctioned the creation of these two new posts on 'the understanding that one or both of them will be 'suppressed' if changed circumstances render them unnecessary. They then expressed the hope that the Government of India would agree to share the resulting expenditure. ^4^ ^ We forwarded the request to the Government of India (on P.Z.7438/33), enquiring whether they saw any objection. The Government of India’s reply, dated 26th April, has now been received and in it they reject the Foreign Office proposal on the ground that the Treasury, contrary to the reccmmendations of the Welby Commission in para.242, Part IV of the Report, sanctioned the creation of these two posts without previously consulting them. They add that, had they been previously consulted, they would not have considered the grounds for the proposal adequate in rC view of£ prevailing financial stringency. It is possible, however, that the Government of India have misunderstood the Foreign Office letter and it may be that although the Treasury are said therein to have sanctioned these two new appointments the sanction/V, V- j sstnction wns intended, though not expressly stated, to heAsubject to the acceptance by the Government of India of a moiety of the cost involved.

It is clear from the correspondence sent by the air mail of November 17th, 1933, that His Majesty's Treasury sanctioned the creation of these two posts at the instance of the Foreign Office without consulting the Government of India. In these circumstances the Government of India do not consider that they are under any obligation to contribute towards the cost of these two posts. Had they been consulted they would have applied to the question the same standards which they are in present financial conditions obliged to apply to the creation of new posts under their own control.

We are not sending the Government of India’s letter officially to the Foreign Office at this stage, because we are not sure whether there may not have been a misunderstanding on the part of the Government of India. They have apparently taken the Foreign Office letter to mean that H.M.G. have definitely decided to create these appointments irrespective of whether India shares the cost or not. Possibly, hov/ever, the position may be that the Treasury sanction v/as meant to be contingent on the Government of India agreeing to the appointments and accepting half the charge.

Sir Reginald Hoare reports that a situation has arisen in which it is no longer possible to secure an adequate staffing of the various Consular posts in Persia without constantly calling upon the officers concerned to forego taking their regulation leave when it is due. Their Lordships will agree that such a state of affairs is to be deprecated, and more especially in a country such as Persia where the unhealthy climate and local conditions may cause serious hardship for an officer whose relief has been unduly delayed. Moreover, the moral e of the service is likely to be affected if a general feeling arises among consular officers that their leave is being continually postponed owing to the staff available being numerically inadequate. It is not possible in Persia to obtain suitable local substitutes to take the place of consular officers during their absence on home leave nor is it possible to secure /salaried The Secretary to the Treasury.salaried officers from other countries to fill these posts since their services are already needed elsewhere. 3. In these circumstances the Secretary of State strongly supports the recommendation put forward by Sir Reginald Hoare that two additional posts for 7ice-Consuls should be allocated to Tehran in order that they may be available to act for officers on leave, and I am accordingly to express the hope that Their Lordshios my be moved to accord the necessary sanction for these new appointments.

Although Sir John Simon considers that the need for a third munshi is clear, he is of the opinion that a salary of 800 Rials a month, rising by increments of 50 Rials a month every two years to a maximum salary of 1000 Rials a month, with a bonus of twenty-five per cent, (see your letter P.

ENCLOSURE IN WEEKLY LETTER No. 20, 18 MAY. 1935 FROM SECRETARY, POLiTKiAL SECRET DEP T. INDIA OFFICE The Under Secretary of State, India Office. I am, Sir, Your obedient Servant,( COPY, (X 2599/17/503) NO. 148. British Legation, Tehran, 4th April, 1933. © Sir, I have the honour to report that it has for some time past 'been evident to me that the Oriental Chancery at this Legation is greatly under-staffed. 2. In 1928, the total staff consisted of: 1 Oriental Secretary (Mr. Havard), 1 Head of Oriental Chancery (Ahhas Quli Khan Nawah) 3 Munshis. competed to the present-day staff of: 1 Acting Oriental Secretary (Mr. Trott), 2 Munshis. 3. I deliberately omit the Assistant Oriental Secretary from the present establishment because during the last five years the Oriental Secretary and the Assistant Oriental Secretary have in practice never been at Tehran together, and because it is equally clear that Mr. Summers cale or any other officer who fills the post will spend most of his time in acting appointments, either in Tehran or elsewhere. Moreover, even the permanent services of an Assistant Oriental Secretary would go a very little ) way towards meeting the difficulty with which I am now concerned - the inability of the present two Munshis to cope adequately with the routine work of translation, press-reading, etcetera. 4 # j may preface my further comments on these points by submitting the following table of correspondence with the Persian Government during the last six years:- Received/: le Right Honourable Sir John Simon, G.C.S.I*&gt; etc., etc. , etc., Wnreicn OfficeReceived: Despatched : Received and Despatched: Year: Official.

This shows an increase of about forty five 45%. per centum since 1927. 6. In his despatch No. 433 of September 8th, 1930, in which my predecessor agreed to the reduction of the number of munshis to two, he explained that the use of semi-official letters in French tended to reduce the work of the Oriental Chancery. A good many such letters are still sent, both in French and English (though not so many as when Teymourtache, as Minister of Court, dealt with foreign affairs generally) but their use (or to be precise, their use without accompanying translations into Persian) has had to be largely dropped in cases where reference through the Ministry for Foreign Affairs to other departments is required: it was found that unless Persian translations were annexed considerable delays and misunderstandings arose, no doubt owing to the fact that the original letter was sent on by the Ministry for Foreign Affairs without translation to the other department concerned, or else that the Ministry simply passed on an insufficient summary of their own. The decrease in the number of letters sent in English or French only, and the consequent increase in the number of translations is, however, not nearly large enough to account tor a rise of 30 %, thirty per centum in the number of translations since 1930 when/when the post of third Mimshi was aholished. The cause of this rise must rather he sought in the general increase in correspondence with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. 7. Another important routine duty of the Oriental Chancery is the study and, where necessary the translation, of the Persian press. The third Munshi, when there was one, used to spend most of his time on this work. In his despatch of 1930, referred to above, my predecessor relied in this connexion upon the fact that the u Messager de Teheran' published daily extracts in French from the Persian press. These translations still appear but they do not lighten the work of the Oriental Chancery to any great extent. The translations are usually the briefest summaries, except in the case of articles of outstanding importance. The Persian papers have to be read as carefully as ever and articles of interest translated in full. During the recent Anglo-Persian oil Company crisis, for instance, the Acting Oriental Secretary, who should be free to devote himself to much more important work, has had to spend much time personally making translations from the press. 8. Another aspect of the Munshi’s work which has greatly increased is the translation of Persian laws and regulations. The output of the Mejliss becomes greater year by year and very few of the laws or regulations appear in any other language than Persian. This duty entails a careful study of the official Gazette of the Ministry of Justice and the proceedings of the Mejliss, and this study in itself takes time. More than once during the past year the Munshis (owing solely, I am convinced, to the pressure at which they have to work) have failed to detect, or at least to detect the importance of, a measure which was seriously to affect British subjects/subjects or of general interest to the Legation, (a particular case I have in mindwas a law for the commutation of pensions). 9. Other duties which fall to the Oriental Chancery are the operation of the Legation postal account and the general supervision of the clearance of consignments addressed to the Legation from the Customs. The first, involving the re-addressing in Persian, weighing and stamping of all outgoing postal correspondence, is a wearisome task that is left to a head Chancery servant in most Missions. Here it is impossible. The clearance of customs consignments, owing to the complicated regulations regarding licenses and the constant difficulties that arise in even the simplest cases, is still more tiresome) the applications for licenses are made by His Majesty^ Consul, who has general charge of such matters, and the consignment actually brought from the customs-house by ghulams, but it is the Munshis who have to keep the roster of licenses and check off those that are used: this, coupled with the constant telephoning to the Licensing Section of the Department of Commerce and the Customs Administration t akes up a great deal of time. 10. On top of all this, the Munshis are subject to constant interruption in their work by Persian visitors who have business of one kind or another with His Majesty’s Legation. 11 . I have so far dealt only with routine work, but the Munshis, or at any rate the Munshi-Bashi, have important duties of a more general kind. The Munshi-Bashi has frequently to interview government officials, more especially in the Ministries of Finance and Justice, and at Police headquarters, about cases in which the Legation is interested and to collect information upon constitutional and/r,'' and legal points generally and upon the interpretation of new laws and regulations. The Munsni-Bashi ought really to be entirely free for this sort of work, and for such tasKs as keeping a full and up-to-date record of Persian personalities, as was done in tne past but cannot be done adequately today. 12. Purthermore, the Munsnis have a certain amount of work to do for tne Military Attache, who has no Munshi of his own. Particularly since restrictions have been placed upon visits by foreign Military Attaches to the Ministry of War, the Munsni-Bashi has often been to interview the Chief of Staff and other officers on the Military Attache’s behalf. 13. The Commercial Secretary has a Munsni, but in addition to such translation work as the Commercial Secretary requires, he does most of the Commercial Secretariat typing, registering, etcetera, and probably works longer hours than anyone in the Legation. It is therefore quite impossible for him to give any assistance to his colleagues in the Chancery. 14. When the reduction of the number of Munshis from three to two was agreed to by my predecessor in 1930, it was thought that the cessation of work connected with the foreign tribunal of the Ministry of Finance might reduce the Munshi’s work proportionately. .(This point is not specifically dealt with in Sir R.Clive’s despatch ho.433 of 1930, referred to above, but it was one of the arguments used in earlier correspondence.) This hope has not, I fear, been fulfilled in its entirety. his Majesty’s Consul has no Munshi of his own, although the consular work is heavier here than at meat provincial posts (and grows heavier with the successive closing of posts near Tehran, even though these are amalgamated with yet other provincial ^3 -4 '/*Rials 850. Rials 50. Rials 1,000 25£ Rials 700. Rials 100. posts) and although he does not require the services of the Munehis as much as when the tribunal was in existence, he cannot help calling upon their services fairly frequently. Moreover, in a general way, the abolition of the tribunal is set off by the increasing number of cases in which British subjects (largely Indians, but recently Europeans also) are the subject of arrest and judicial action by the Persian authorities. 15. I can therefore state that there is in my opinion urgent need for the appointment of a third Munshi and I trust that sanction may be granted for the engagement of a suitable man forthwith. 16* The probable closing of His Majesty 1 s Consulate-General at Isfahan may afford the opportunity of engaging Mirza Hedayatullah Khan Rahnama. He is reported to me to be a very reliable and hard-working official, with a very good command of English, and though I am not sure that he would wish to come to live in Tehran, I should be glad of the opportunity of offering him the appointment. I should consequently be glad if I might receive a reply to this despatch by telegram. &lt; 17. The salary which I recommend is Rials eight hundred and fifty - fifty (every two years) - one thousand a month, with the usual Noruz gratuity, plus the twenty five per centum increase granted to the other two Munshis. His present salary, it is true, is only Rials seven hundred, including a temporary allowance of Rials one hundred a month, but the cost of living is so much greater in Tehran that he could not exist on less. 18. I particularly hope that it may be possible to make the post of third Munshi a regular appointment, that is to say that, while the post would not be regarded as any more permanent than the rest of the Legation establishment, andand while the man himself would have no guarantee of continuous employment, the post should not 'be the subject of constant review, which would only take place if the work of the Oriental Chancery obviously decreased to a substantial degree for two or three years at a time. Unless some sort of assurance of continuous employment can be assumed it is practically impossible to obtain a good man. 19. I may add that the present establishment leaves no margin at all for leave or sickness: and while it is always possible for two men to do the work of three for a short time, it is very much more difficult for one to do the work of two. Except for the usual public holidays, neither of the two Munshis have been absent from the office for a day for over two years - the Munshi Bashi for nearly three. The second Munshi is feel ing the strain and has just applied to me for six week’s leave on medical advice. It is going to be very difficult to carry on at all during his absence. 20. I am sending a copy of this despatch to His Majesty’s Consul-General at Isfahan (No.12). I have, etc. (Sgd.) R.H.Hoare.n Register No. P.Z. 6416/32. Political Department.

In our letter of 7th April 1932 (P.Z.1577/32) we agreed to the continuation as from 1st January last of these temporary increases. Since then the cost of living at Tehran has continued to increase and Mr.Hoare urges that the increases already made should be raised by 10$ in the case of munshis and 5$ in the case of the ghulams and the menial staff. This will only bring the increases in salary up to the amount already proposed by Sir Robert Clive in 1931 and Mr.Hcare’s proposals seem very reasonable. Owing to the fall of the rial since 1931 the sterling cost to H.M.G. will not be increased and it seems unnecessary to consult the Government of India before sanctioning Mr.Hoare’s proposal. / F '6580 -1932- V Secretary, Financial Department, For your concurrence in the draft.

In continuation of Sir Robert Clive's despatch No. 271 of the 1st June 1951 I attach hereto a aeaorandua shoving the prices obtaining todaj in Tehran by comparison with those obtaining in the early summer of 1951. 5. In paragraph 10 of that despatch a reference was made to the probability of further increases in the cost of all forms of imported produce and X have no hesitation in saying thit this prognostication has been fully realised. 4. The Persian Government's policy of prohibiting imports generally in order to stimulate local manufacture, while admirable in theory, is in this highly disorganised country Rials 16. 6i lbs.

I will endeavour to quote simple instances s- Bard sugar has risen in price from Rials sixteen per batman (six and a half pounds) to Rials twenty three, an increase of forty three per cent since July 1931# Soft sugar la now selling at Rials eighteen and a half instead of Rials eleven.

The Municipality recently inposed a tax of 30% on all gross receipts of public vehicles - over and above the standard tax of Rials one hundred and fifty per month levied fftr each vehicle plying for hire. At first the owners were not permitted to Increase their fares with the result that all buses stopped running. Jfow fares are being put up a further 10% above the 30A. increase allowed six months ago, making thereby s net increase of 50% since July 1951. Owing to repeated department soisure b of transport and forcible 'conflscatlone' of supplies, coal is today priced at Rlale one hundred and ten per kharvar Instead of Rials sixty tire • Charcoal is at Rials two and a half per saund Instead of Rials one and this winter the prices of both coal and charcoal will soar still more. The rise in the price of coal le a most serious matter for the better class Persian employees and that in the price of charcoal for the lower class. The failure of the crops in a large part of Persia and extensive purchases of sheep by the Soviet Government are expected to cause a shortage of these commodities during the coming winter and a corresponding Increase in prices. 6. There are many other ways in which the present Municip ality’s activities result in a direct rise in the coat of utility services, local foodstuffs, and amusements. 7. The new Road Tax which comes into force this month will have its immediate effect on the cost of everything. 8. I am therefore compelled once more to request that further consideration may be given to the question of the salaries ofsalaries of the sunshis and the vagea of the menial staff* 9* First of all to take the case of the munshls *• As has been previously explained the munshis are men of good poaitlon • not servants * and they and their fanilies, like everyone of the same class, Persian or foreign, need la many categories, articles which Persia as ahc is today, is not manufacturing* i0 They are required to move in respectable society and aaintain a decent appearance* Their colleagues in other Legations are much more highly paid and I consider it politic that our munshls should b# encouraged, in the interests of the Legetion, to be presentable and to hold their own with their colleagues* My predecessor on more than one occasion explained that their work has greatly increased since the reduction of the Oriental Chancery and I hope it is not necessary for me to labour this point again* 10* I therefore beg leave to urge that their salaries now be raised by 104 to make the increase on their basic salary 2b% as proposed by Sir Hobart Clive last year instead of the 15% actually granted* 11* As regards the aenlal staff I shall be glad if the bonus of 2&amp;^ previously granted can now be brought to the 50^ origin ally asked for* 11* If these increases can be granted as soon as possible it will be possible to forestall inevitable petitions for still larger increases which will flow in directly this winter sets in* 12* Owing to the fall of the rial since 1951, the cost in sterling to His Majesty's Government will not be increased by these rises* I have the honour to be with the highest respect.

I do not wish to derogate in any way from this assurance when X add (lest any misconception should arise in connexion with the correspondence that has already taken place on the point) that for the members of the olerioal staff the reductions involved, small though they may be in actual figures, are a serious matter. The correspondence to which T refer is that ending with Your Lordship’s despatch Bo. 497 of September 1st (X 51S3/ 2 &amp;2/503), 3. I feel bound to make one further reservation. Those members of the staff who are British subjects may properly be expected to take their share in any sacrifices that the national emergency demands, not only on grounds of patriotism, but on the principle that in sound theory each, in common with every other British subject, shares the responsibility for the existence of that emergency. 3ut such considerations do not apply to the reduction of the salaries and wages of the Persian staff.

The monthly saving effooted here would be just over three pounds - say forty pounds a year. I submit that who total saving if the same per oentual reduction were made applicable to all Oriental Legations and Consulates would perhaps not exceed one thousand pounds a year. 4. In the meanwhile I have had no choice but to authorise the payment of these salaries and wages at the full rate for the month of October. Your Lordship's despatch stated that the reductions should take effect from October 1st, but the despatch was dated October 10th and did not reach me till October 31st. The introduction of the out in respect of October would thus have meant that the employees would have given a month's service in the belief that they were working for one wage, only to find at the end that they had been working for a lower one. I therefore tfuat that my action will receive Your Lordship's approval and that before november 3 Oth I may have receiver Tour LorcshiV© pemisaion to continue the natlv- salaries and wages at the former rate.

S.W.l. 22nd June, 1931 Sir Ts.5 Ts. 5-J I am directed by Mr. Secretary Henderson to transmit herewith, for the information of the Secretary of State for India in Council, copies of two despatches received from His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran relative to the salaries of the munshis and menial staff employed in His Majesty’s Legation. 2. It will be observed that while there has been little increase as yet in the prices of locally produced food stuffs, the prices of some articles in daily use have increased appreciably since January 1930 when the value of the Kran began to fall. There has moreover been a very substantial increase in the rents paid by the staff, amounting in some cases to as much as five and five and one half Tomans a month, which, as Sir R. Clive points out, imposes a severe strain on the resources of the lower paid employees. 3. Sir R. Clive proposes that the two munshis and the dispenser should receive increases of twenty five per cent and the ten ghulams and twenty one menials increases of thirty per cent. In view of the fact hov/ever that the general increase in prices which may be expected in consequence of the depreciated value of the Kran has not yet set in, Mr. Henderson considers that it would be sufficie.it to grant temporary increases of fifteen per cent for the munshis, twenty per cent for the dispenser and twenty five per The Under-Secretary of State, India Officeper cent for the ghulams and menial staff. 4. I am accordingly to request that the Secretary of State for India in Council may he moved to sanction these temporary increases, v/ith effect as from the 1st April last. 5.

Since January, 1930, when the value of the Kran in relation to the Pound sterlixgbegan to fall, there have been tne. following increases in the price of necessities:- Sugar, from Krans ten in January 1930, to Kians sixteen per Bataan now. Kerosene from Kraus three ana cents fifty in January, 1930, to Krans four &gt;er Batman now. Soft drinXs, such as Sherbets, lemonades, syrups manufactured from sugar and fruit juice* wnecher fresh or preserved, have risen seventy five per cent. nocal aoap nas risen from eighteen Krans to twenty two Krans per Batman of six and a half pounds. 4. The most marked increases which affect both the Munahis and the Menial staff are to be found in the following:- /House The ffight Honourable Arthur Henderson, k.P., Foreign Office.House rents: rv Clothing# local: v ^lothing, imported: Krs .100 Krs.120 Krs* 70 Krs.80 •s.25 '6.40 's. 50 Increase of fifty per cent to one hundred per cent. Increase of forty four per cent. Increase of from forty per cent to sixty per cent. All forms of household utensils, whether locally manufactured or imported: Increase of from twenty per cent to twenty five per cent. 5. The imposition of an income tax has affected the Munshies, who now pay as follows:- 1 st Munsni: Krans one hundred to one hundred and twenty per annum 2nd Munshi: Krans seventy to Krans eighty per annum, on their official emoluments. 6 . As fair examples of the house rent which is paid by the Menial staff, I would cite tne foliowing:- J anua ry: 1. Vice-Cons .late ferrash. (Wages twenty five Tomans per mensem) One house with two small rooms, a store room and small yard in which are housed three grown ups and four children. 2 . Qhulam Yusuf Knan. One room in a house accommodating five persona. 3. FeTrash Ali Asghar. 1 house of two rooms in South district of Tehran (three and a half miles from the Legation.) 4. Telephone operator Abul Ohassem. One room in a house May: 1931: Six Tomans Hine Tomans per per mensem. mensem. Three and a Hine Tomans half Tomans per per mensem, mensem. Five Tomans Nine Tomans per per mensem. mensem Three Tomans Bight Tomans per per mensem mensem. I regret I am unable to quote rents paid by Munehies as they both occupy small houses owned by themselves, but a house consisting of from four to five rooms in a quarter near the Legation which formerly rented for twenty five Tomans per mensem now letches as much as forty to fifty Tomans per mensem.7. It will be realised, therefore, that on wages totalling from sixteen to twenty five Tomans per mensem, the payment of house rent at anything from eight Tomans per «ensem for a small room is a quite unwarrantable drain on the employees* means of existence* 8 . I venture to propose, therefore, that the following cost of living bonuses be granted, to count as from the 1st January, 19315- The Menial staff an increase of thirty per cent on their a ros 6 wages. This will afford some relief to their housing problems. The Munshis and Dispenser an inciauae o of twenty five per cent on their gross emoluments. 9. I append a short analysis to show that, with the decreased value of the Kran, there will be no additional Sterling cost to His Majesty’s Government in respect of these Krtn bonuses. 10. It is, perhaps, not unnecessary to add that prices in Krans of all imported articles will tend henceforth to rise, and that the grandiose plans for the construction and extension of a new iehran will also tend to render the lot of the poorer employee still more difficult as regards his housing, and I sreil doubtless have occasion to apply for further monetary grants - under this heading - before long.

At present the Munshis are drawing salaries as follows:- First Munshi Krans thirteen hundred per mensem Second Munshi Krans one thousand per mensem both being due an increment of Krans fifty per mensem on the 1st July, 1931. «3. ihe exchange, at the time the above scale was fixed stood at Krans iiity four to fifty five per pound sterling and the Aran has now depreciated to ninety per pound sterling with the prospect of a further official decrease to one hundred to the £. 6 . Since March 1930 the official rate has stood at sixty but the unolficia l rate of the '‘bourse noire” has varied between eighty five and a hundred and in consequence, despite tentative prohibitive efforts on the part of the authorities, house rents have soared, servants wages have risen, and the prices of all imported articles have steadily risen, and appear still to be \ r , despatch No. 283 (X 3549/46/503) of the 7th June 1929 The increase of salaries therein notified as having been steadily rising The Fight Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office.7* Apart from the above resulting effects, due to the depreciation of the Kran, tne municipality are carrying out a laudable but nevertheless extensive and expensive scneme of town planning and in consequence a series of new municipal taxes are being inflicted upon the umortunate inhabitants of Tehran. 8 . These taxes on all buildings, rente, places of amusement such as cinemas, private clubs, restaurants, caf^s, and shops, all tend to react on the prices which the general public are called upon to pay. 9. The monthly tax of ten tomans per private motor car has now compelled the First Munshi to diBpos ®&gt;&lt;3 of his small car which in the nature of nis woric was almost essential to him, especially when the Legation is at Qulhex and when he has occasion to pay very xrequent visits on business of the Legation and Consulate- General to Town and to other imits of the now extended residential areas around Guinea, and Tajrieh. 10. In these circumstances X feel compelled to submit for your fcind consideration their petition for a fuither revision of their emoluments. 11 . With the exchange standing in July 1989 at approximately Kraus fifty five p r £ sterling the total cost of both salaries to his jwa^esty’s Government amounted to approximately forty two £ sterling per mensem. 12 . Low that the exchange has oeteriorated to Krans ninety per pound sterling the cost to His Majesty’s Government,is only some * twenty five pounds and ten shillings per mensem. 13. I hae the honour to suggest therefore that in view of the facts stated above and in consideration of the approaching conversion of uhe Persian currency to a new one on a gold basis with all the uncertainty that that measure involves it is deblrable to fix the salaries of the munshis in sterling payableat the Bank'e buying rate for three days Bight bills on London at the end of every month and that the sterling figures be fixed at the equivalent prevailing at the time when the current scales were assessed* 15* In this manner no additional charge will devolve upon his Majesty’s &lt;K&gt;vernaent but the Munshis will obtain compensation by the additional Krans or other Persian currency. 14. I would add that the 1 unshis of the French, German, and American Legations are all paid inforeign currency and I am informed that the Dutch and Italian Legations are following suit. I have, etc.. (Signed) R.C. CARR.Sir, We beg to request you to give the following your favourable consideration. The Foreign Exchange Law and the unprecedented Kran depreciation have m de the cost of living unbearable and prohibitive. All cofiukodities and especially foreign-iaade goods have gone up in price to double their former cost in ^ost cases and this can be verified very easily. While the Government has fixed the rate of exchange for the £ at Krane 60 oificially, it is being bought and sold in the bazaar at Krans 90 or more and the merchants are selling their goods reckoning the sterling at Krans 120 and this is more than 100 per cent above the normal rate of krans 60 - 60 of the sterling before the present crisis came about. With the above summary explanation that we submit for your consideration we want to show that the salary that we are receiving in Krans is in real value less than half oi what we were receiving and out of consideration for this fact nearly all other Leg tions are paying the salaries of their kunshis invariably in dollars or pounds sterling. We would appreciate it immensely if H«M. Legation would very kindly relieve us of the present unbearable situation by paying our salaries in pounds and not in Kraus. If this snoald be impracticable for reasons that we do not know, we would request that an increase of pay in Krans equal to the difference of depreciation of the kran may be accorded us to bring our salaries to the normal level of Krs. 50-60 to the Pound.

In view of the comparatively long distances between the various buildings in the compounds it is obvious that the installation of telephones would result in a considerable saving of time, and it has been ascertained that it would make possible a reduction by one of the gholam establishment, thus effecting a saving of approximately eighty pounds per annum. 3. A revised estimate of the cost which has been obtained by His Majesty*s Office of Y/orks shows that an expenditure of about one hundred and eighty-six pounds will be required for the necessary work and equipment and I am to enquire whether the Secretary of State for India in Council is prepared to authorise the charge to Indian revenues of a moiety of the cost of this service.

Sir , I have the honour to inform you that the need for an internal telephone system has long been felt in this Legation, where at present only one instrument exists connected with the Tehran central Exchange. It is therefore at present not possible to communicate from one of the somewhat scattered offices of the Legation to another except by the antiquated system of written messages and all telephoning to the outside world must be done from the single instrument in the Chancery servants' room. 2. It has not however been thought worth while raising this question hitherto because the town telephone system was extremely bad. Now, the town wires are being put underground and the improvement is very marked. 3. Mr. Scott of His Majesty’s Office of Works went into the question of the installation of internal telephone systems both at Tehran and Culhek, to be connected through an internal exchange with the public system; and he was, I understand, to raise the matter with the Board of Works on his return to England. It has been found possible to effect an economy in the original estimates wfiich Mr. Scott took home with him, owing to the discovery in the Legation of an adequate switchboard, which will save the despatch of one from England. This encourages me to hope that permission for the immediate installation of the system at least in the Tehran Legation, will be granted. 4. The revised estimates which are being submitted to ?he Bight Honourable Sir Austen Chamberlain, K.G. FOBEIGN OFFICE. i'to Hie Majesty’s Office of Works by their Representative here amount to:- Tehran. Wiring, alteration of switchboard etcetera: approximately £55. Instruments - if purchased from the Tehran Telephone Company £54; if hired, hrans 1620 per annum. Gulhek. Wiring etcetera approximately £55. One set of instruments will suffice for both legations. It is possible that it would be cheaper to send out instruments from i£ngland . 5. A'very considerable amount of time and labour both for members of the legation and for the office servants would be saved by the adoption of this proposal and I have the honour most earnestly to beg that the Office of Works may be urged to sanction it.

Memorandum on His Lajesty's Vice Consulate, Tehran . Por many year a the staff of the /ice Consulate has consisted of the /ice Consul, and, with intervals, of a Probationer /ice Consul. Since Mr. Brenan was posted as His Majesty's Vice Consul at Tehran in October 1923, the following probationers have assisted in the Vice Consul te: From October 19 23 to 3e tember 1924. Mr.Davis, from September 1924 to March 1935. Mr.Lingeman. From March 1925 till September 1925. HID. From 3e tember 1925 to January 1926. Mr. 0'Dwyer. From January 1926 to June 1926. Mr.Finch. It is now intended that Mr. Finch should proceed else where and be relieved again in July in the Vice Consult te at fehran by a new Probationer Officer then due. It will be observed that during the period under review the maximum period spent by a Probationer in the Vice Consulate was approximately 12 months, and the min mum period approximately five months. A Probationer on joining the Vice Consulate for the first time is naturally entirely new to the work of the office, and is usually entirely new to any form of office routine or ystem, and a month or two elapses before he becomes of really material assistance to the Vice Consul. During6 During this period he is occupied with learning Persian, and generally acquainting himself with 1 cal condi ions. When he has acquired a degree of efficiency he is taken from the Vice Consulate and introduced to other work, such as cyphers, in the Chancery of the Legation. A new Probationer is then introduced to the Vice Consulate and the same procedure gone through again. This system is not satisfactory from the point of view of the efficiency of the '/'ice Consulate, as as soon as a Vice Consul (Probationer) has begun to be of some assistance he is taken away. In the event of the Vice Consul being absent, through illness or for other reasons, there is no permanent assistant to whom reference can be made in matters regarding ordinary routine or the Vice Consulate generally. The work of the Vice Consulate has very considerably increased during the last few years, but the staff has remained the same, and in order to maintain and increase the efficiency of the Office, it is submitted that the following is now required. 1. The Vice Consul. 2. A Probationer Vice Consul. d. A Second Division clerk. The presence of Do. 2 will tend to a continuity of system and will most certainly be of very great advantage if a new officer were appointed to the post of Vice Consul. Do. 2 on first coming to the country can then be initiated into his general Consular duties with greater freedom, without the whole of his time being taken up v/ith office routine. Do. 1% I T o.l, the Vice Consul, will then have somewhat more time at his disposal for general supervision, v/hich he cannot at present afford on account of the multifarious duties expected of him, and cn account of his having to devote his attention to a mass of of ice routine. A resume of the duties performed in the Vice Consulst is attached hereto, together v/ith a comparative list of the fees collected since 1922.5. ITotes on Vice Consul T s Juties, Tehran. 1.
