The Wali has recently di sba^ded 200 sowars as he finds they are in existing circumstances an unncessary drain on the State revenues. He has decided to ailist 600 foot in place of the sowars since he feels infantry to be necessary for safeguarding the borders of Swat State, AJ .0 • .&lt;j&amp; If m0re Particularly in the Kohistan area where the local inhabitants, who were in possession of country-made weapons, have been disarmed. 3. Swat State is becoming more and more dependent upon facilities to purchase weapons from British India N*' XI X • 1 X • X „ Xl_ 1 • rather than from tribal territory and the continuance of unsettled conditions on the border renders the maintenance of large-standing army imperative. 4. The Wali's application has been held up for about nine months as there were certain indications that the Wali had forcible designs upon Kalam. There now appears to be no likelihood of this at present. The Wali has satisfied His Excellency the Governor at a personal interview that he will allow no weapon or round of ammunition to leave his own State. 5. The Local Administration, therefore, recommend that the sanction of the Government of India be accorded to arable the Wali to purchase the arms for which he has applied.Copy of letter No # 26305 P/3/19(b)-St.I., dated the 17th/19th July 1939, from the Chief Secretary to the Government of N.W.F.P., to the Secretary to 'the Government of India in ihe External Affairs Department.

In continuation of my letter No.695-CTB/3/19(b), dated 10th June 1939, I am directed to say that the Wali of Swat has now requested that instead of rifles of .275 bore he may now be pemitted to buy 300 rifles of .303 bore. The rifles which he contemplates buying are discarded aray rifles (2 E.Y.), which it is understood the General Officer Comrnanding-in-Chief Northern Command would have no objection to arranging. 2.

Z. it is difficult to make the matter of the number of rifles in the W&amp;li's possession absolutely clear. The latest 'Return of Military Forces' which has been submitted by the Political Agent and is now being examined here shows Swat State in possession of nearly 3,000 'single loading .303 rifles' and 13,000 “other breech-loading rifles or carbines'. The latter figures are explained by the Polit* ical Agent as including 1,100 .275 German and Belgium Vw rifles, 400 of .275 bore 'country-jdade', 500 of British make, and nearly 11,000 'pass-made'. * great many of the latter are hardly fit to be described as rifles at all. There is moreover the difficulty of saying exactly which of these are 'in the Mali's possession' and which are not.

With reference to your enquiry about a firm called Abdool Ally Moesabhoy &amp; Sons, Ltd., of Karachi, in your letter of 19th May, 1938, the following information has been obtained The firm was originally established in Karachi in 1880 as General Merchants but about 1909 they obtained a licence to deal in arms and ammunition. Hussainbhoy, son of Abdul Ally, is the present proprietor, he was appointed as Honorary Magistrate in 1918. He first came into contact with the Kawab of Bhawalpur at Karachi in 1925. He appeared to find so much favour with the Nawab that, in 1935, he was appointed a member of his personal staff and accompanied him to London for the Coronation as his A.D.C. Hussainbhoy, in partnership with two others, purchased a launch about 4 years ago, which used to ply between Cutch Maudvi, Jam Nagar and Karachi. It was reported that the launch was used for smuggling saccharine and silk, and although the Customs were on the lookout they never succeeded in obtaining direct evidence. However, Hussainbhoy was forced to resign his Honorary Magistrateship in 1937. The Nawab has been dealing with this firm for about 10 years and it is reported that last year they supplied some thousands of Mauser and other cartridges to the ytate. The Nawab of Swat is also believed to have enquired from the firm the rate at which they could supply him with Mauser cartridges, and eventually to have placed his order with Illahi Bux &amp; Co., Ammunition Dealers, Delhi for 300 rifles and 60,000 cartridges.^ ft (V&amp;. ^ ) 0 3 P.Y.631/38 INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL, LONDON, S.¥.l 10th May, 1938.
