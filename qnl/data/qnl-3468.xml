There are notes at the end of the file, (ff. 241-270). The file notes refer to the documents within the file; they give brief description of the correspondence with an index number, which refers back to numbers in red crayon through the file.</extent><extent>The main foliation sequence commences at the front cover with 1 and terminates at the back cover with 282; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.An older foliation sequence is also present in parallel to the main sequence between ff. 2-282. This sequence has a number of mistakes and inconsistencies, so it has therefore been replaced with the above mentioned sequence; these numbers have been crossed out to prevent confusion with the replacement foliation. A third foliation sequence is present in the index section at the back of the file between ff. 252-270; these numbers are also written in pencil, and are located in the same position as the main sequence. Circled index numbers in coloured crayon can also be found throughout the file; they should not be confused with foliation numbers.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The file contains correspondence and telegrams between the Political Agent at Bahrain, the Political Residency in the Persian Gulf, the Adviser to the Government at Bahrain, Charles Dalrymple Belgrave, and the Port Directorate at Basrah, regarding manteineance of the light buoys at Bahrais between 1933 and 1948, and the plan to replace them with permanent beacons in 1938.
