T# Tke Hon*ole the Pslitieal Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire* Memorandum* I enclose herewith a Diarjr of the Sur Operations whieh may be useful for record# 2* With reference to the last paragraph of the Diary* In his letter to you, Shaikh Ali in promising good beharieur adds if the sultan paid * what was agreed between us M . In his letter to Shaikh Ali (para 25 of Diary) the Sultan olearly informed him that the time for discussion of terms and conditions was passed* This of oaurse cancels the previous terms offered to the Shaikh which were,*- * Cc (a) Continuance of his politieal subsidy of &amp; 1200 p*a* J (b) j n addition 1200 p*a* new and special allowance. I ^ (e) Personal exemption from Customs dues on certain articles to the amount which the Shaikh, and his predecessors, had enjoyed* (d) Hiring of &amp; house from the Shaikh for the Customs Post in Aiqa, with 2 guards te be provided by the State and 2 by the Shaikh* 3# • As you are aware shaikh Ali was invited by His Highness on board the sloop at Sur to discuss any matters he wished, but refused the invitation* Therefore all the Shaikh's emoluments, ineluding his % • politieal subsidy, are still under consideration* When this subsidy is not paid at the end of the month presumably the Shaikh will protege* car L tnc jL^.2. informed that fee afeouid feave an interview with the Sultan who will be returning to Jtuscat from Dfeafar on - or about - 20th April* 4* The Sultan will doubtleaa be read/ to follow our adviee as to wfeat attitude fee should adept towards the Shaikh, wfeiofe • I sufc&amp;est - mi^ht be as follows* wiiicfe Owing to the rebellious attitude adopted by the SfeaiichJ was warn only relinquished under immediate threat of bombardment all the emoluments and privileges enjoyed by him are automatically cancelled* The Sultan is, however, willing to consider the re-granting of emoluments (a) and (e) above contingent on the good behaviour of the Sfeaihfe and kis tribesmen* If their conduct has been satisfactory during the next six months (say) then the Shaikh 1 s political subsidy and his Customs exemption (which could be converted into a cash equivalent) will be paid for this period in arrears, and payments after that will bo on similar lines* The advantage ©f this arrangement is that it will hang a carrot of respectable size in front of shaikh All's nose: it is net only the amount of a state political subsidy which a shaikh values but the added prestige taat it apparently confers* 5. The special allowance (b) snouid in my opinion be cancelled, and you expressed the same view at Sur. Shaikh All has certainly no right t© it after the way he has behaved, and what is more important from the political point of view the granting of it now might be taken by him and his tribe as an indication of weakness and not of generosity* 6 . With regard to (d)# The matter of the house has been settled by hiring one from a private individual* As for the two guards who were t© be provided by Shaikh Ali* This seems a trifling matter from our point ofTiew t ‘but in Arab eyes it may assume mere im^ertanee, and if the »&gt;h&amp;iich lays stress en it I tuin^ that he might be allowed it. 7. I should be glad to Jcnow if tae above views have your approval. Before expressing any views to the Sultan I propose getting his, and if - which is unlikely • he is willing to give Shaikh Ali more concessions than are indicated above then we can conour. After all he - the Sultan - is the best judge of where to draw the line between generosity and what may be regarded by Arab tribal opinion as weakness. 8 . Shaikh Ali in addition t© his final letter to you addressed one to the Sultan. The latter informed me verbally that it was couched in repentant terms and made promises of good behaviour for the future.

Captain Alban in the 'Al Saidi' met the sloops at Sur. There were strong rumours that shaihh All was coming down to Aiqa in a day or two. \l 13. it had been decided that the test of Shaihh All’s submission should be his acceptance ef the Custom’s Post, which used formerly to be in Aiqa, but which ewing te the rebellious attitude of the Bani Bu Ali had bee* discontinued for some years past. The acceptance or refusal by Shaikh Ali this outward and visible sign of the State’s rights was a clear cut issue which he could net evade. It had also been settled that the best position for the Customs Post was within a prominent semi-circular white wall ©n the Aiqa side of the cree^. This wall commands the creek and was in in fact built by the Bani Bu Ali themselves from which they could fire on dhows which refused to pay (illegal)March. 4 th 3. dues to The establishment of the post within it would therefore be in the nature of mahing the punishment fit the crime* 14. Shaikh All was not in Aiqa on the arrival of the sloops and it was decided that the Customs Post should be established in Aiqa at once* Four men of the Customs staff were therefore sent off in a h ouri (native boat) to land at Aiqa.

His Highness replied to the effect that Shaikh Ali had X until noon nx to acoept the establishment of the Customs Post. Shaikh Ali replied in more moderatetone statin* tne terms on whisk he was prepared to assept the post* He ebjected* however, ts a flag being flown over it* 24 .

Finally that if Shaikh Ali behaved as a loyal subject cf the State, the latter would treat him well, but that if he persisted in his rebellious attitude he would be punished. The Political Resident sent an accompanying note to the Shaikh adtising him to make peace while there was yet time, that the demands of the Muscat State were just, and the British Government were determined to enforce them. 26.

This could not be granted as it was obviously the correct procedure for Shaixh Ali to come to the Sultan* 29.

If on the other hand Shaikh Ali and his tribesmen acted as loyal subjects of the Muscat State, doubtless the State would treat them with their accustomed generosity* 30.

However, on the evening of the bth tihaii-h All arrived at Aiqa ana the follow ini; zooming sent a letter to Hie Highness the sultan which was most truculently worded- In it, after acknowledging receipt of hie high- neaa* letter, he wrote: M ¥ou have haatened here before '•zay arrival and your proialee was for the ena of the of the/•tii« month, and you ur* warning un i’or fighting.

The Hhaikh’s objection to a flag being flown over the cue tor ok house was quite illogical, since the Muscat flag is always, aad^whsn lie wrote his letter, flown over Ai^a fort. 10. To tiiis the &amp;miich replied in a Xm it nr in which lie repeated the 1 1 mm whlcli had been offered to him by the State at the interview in i^ecamber last; but did not express his readiness to accept the custoeas post, but stated that lie would not cone off to the ship to see his Hlt#iness tout was prepared to discuss matters ashore either at Aiqa or at r'ur. A faceting of this nature would certainly have been derogatory to His ni^iness* dignity, and it was evident that the Jihuikh was endeavour ing to prolong discussions, the time for which had passed, am to evade the issue. 11. This letter tuts not received till stout 2 p.nu, that is two hours after the time given for acceptance had passed, when it was received his Highness therefore sent ashore saying that, as hr hud not complied with hi a orders by noon, the fort at Aiqa would be bombarded end the fort at Jaalan bora bed toy aeroplanes tout tliat in order tq/to *n*bXe hku tribettr-ien to oucupo from dm^ar tm.» oia not be clone till »ednesua^ uomin^^ and nut er cloaecl Tor hie ini*ornation a notice addroooed by the 2 &gt;enier huval Officer to the people of Ai 40 and aiiio a notice to be sent to tJ jb people of oaa^an.

To hi a Hi^ieoa* letter I added one fron iqyaelf to tii« Hlmildi advloing Mia to raaice peace while there aaa yet txiae, un receipt of Shaikh All 9 a letter Mentioned above nio iii^ineBC tlierefore ad dr cooed another letter to hlxa Infoanlng hiia 1 tiiat the tirae for tlie diecuasion of temo aiia conditions 3md paaned and that he required four men of the hum hu Ali to conic off to the chip and taie tlie cuotona gaurcl aelnore to Aiqh.

Both letters were sent aohore together with the notices of IxiMburdraent. IS.

Por three days crews of boats prevented the numbering of their beats dhows by the Customs officials, on the 4th.day,however, all resistance ceased and boats were duly numbered. One boat owner was consigned to prison. 3, As regards the fish market, for two days the fishermen removed their fish without allowing dues to be taken, on the 3rd.day,however, the fish was auctioned in a A orderly manner and a sum of 5 dollars realised. The smallnes of the sum collected is due to allowing the fish -to be auctioned at about one Quarter of the market rate for the first few days.MUSCAT &amp; OMAN GOVERNMENT, FINANCE MINISTRY, Muscat, Dated ff) Aiqa . I visted Aiq.a on the morning after arriving at Sur and explained carefully the provisions of notices 1 &amp; 2 to Muhammad hin Khatar and someothers who accepted all conditions without demur. 5. The only trouble exprienced with Aiqa was that while discussionmahout boat registration^ were still going on at Umqramtain the Customs official who went to Aiqa to register a boat there was stopped and told to finish at Umqramtain first. I at once sent back the Customs official with notice that the boat would be registered at once or the matter reported. The boat was numbered without further trouble . 6. The fishermen and boatmen of Sur are a most truculent lot of savages especially those of rasira of whom there are quite a number. At first every attempt on the part of the Customs officials to number boats or collect fish due was the signal for the production of guns and other weapons. 7. There is no doubt that such resistance as there was, was a try on and was organised by the Jenebah who, with the exception of Shaikh Nasar bin Ali of the Aramah and Shaikh Musallam bin Salim of the Mukhanah, have always been mpre or less disaffected beneath the surface. When they saw that there was no chance of escaping payment of these dues they gave in peacefully. 8. when I left Sur on Friday the 25th.March at noon all demands had been complied with and the fish tax was being paid without trouble.MUSCAT &amp;.

Reference your memorandum No.C-94 of 29th March 1932. SUR. 2 . I agree generally with the views expressed in your memorandum regarding the terms to ue given to Shaikh Ali. An early opportunity will presumably arise of putting his profes sions of repentence to the proof, since the Aiqa dhows will be returning this month or early in May, and it remains to be seen whether they will pay their customs dues loyally or attempt to evade them. If the Bani Bu Ali give no further trouble in the course of the next two or three months, I consider that, subject I to any views that His Highness the Sultan may express, the terms which you propose are suitable. I also think there is a good deal to be said for your suggestion that the customs exemption enjoyed by the Shaikh might be converted into a cash payment. This would probably obviate administrative difficulties, and if Shaikh Ali’s behaviour was realty satisfactory the amount could be fixed at a fairly liberal figure and the State could in effect give him a portion of term (b) mentioned in paragraph 2 of your memorandum without seeming to do so and without any loss of face. However, I think, we should be guided largely ..n - 2 - largely by His Highness 1 views in this matter, provided the terms offered are fairly generous, since I definitely informed Shaikh Ali with His Highness* approval that if he behaved well he would be treated well* sd/- H.V.Biscoe, Lt.Colonel, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, ATTESTED.

Presumably there is an omission somewhere but as received l cannot make head or tail of it, although i gather from the subsequent paragraph that the dhows were numbered and registered and some tax levied on fish, is this tax customary in the Muscat State ? to the best of rny belief no tax is levied on fish caught locally anywhere else in the Gulf, but if it^ls a recognised tax in Muscat i have no objection to it, though what right a state really has to charge customs duty on something caught in its own territorial waters i cannot see. Moreover fish, after all, is the food of the poorest of the poor and the one thing that keeps them going when times are bad as they are at present. i hope, therefore, that the tax in a very light one.

Subjectt * S U R. f 1 1 | ^ ^ Please refer to your D.O.No.233-S of 22nd A±&gt;ril. The sentence you quote is of course quite unintelligible, and is the result of careless typing in my office. M^ny apologies. The 2 paras mixed up read as follows:- (d) All dhows present in Aiqa and Umqramtain registered and numbered. (e) Fish market re-established in Umqramtain, also held in Alqa whenever fish landed there. Sur is a great fishing centre and the revenue may amount to 0 2,500 per annum* 2. The imposition of the fish tax at Sur is quite in order. It is levied at all tne other ports in the State, and the only reason for it not being in force at Sur is that this port had for many years past ceased, to a large extent, to be administered by the State. As a result of our recent success in the matter of Shaikh Ali it is now possiole to bring the port once more under the administration of the State, and this was of course one of our objects in our demonstration against the lani lu Ali. In order to tiiis object we will have to keep up a steady pressure on Sur and gradually bring it into line with the other districts of the State. This policy will entail the enforce ment of taxes etc which will certainly not be popular, and which will now and then be the caise of some local, though not serious, opposition. If we do not adopt this policy of steady pressure then, so it seems to me, the port will The Hon’ble Lieut.Colonel E : v **i®coe, i.a., political Resident in the Persian Gulf \ JushireJ43&gt; relapse into its former anarchical and rebellious condition, as it did on previous occasions in past years after some temporary success had been gained but net followed up. At tne same time I am quite alive to the fact that we must go slow, and as you will see below (para 4) in the case of the fiah tax tne wind has been much tempered to the i mjo£ b of Sur, though they are by no means particularly shorn, 3, The fish tax has existed in the State from time imme- morxal, and the method of collection is generally as follows, though the actual procedure varies *ith localities. The .isn are brought to the beach by the fishermen. The purchasers then come, and brokers approved of by the State auction off the fish in lots, and of the proceeds the State takes 7^ (5^ Octroi Tax and 2^^ supervision charges), in addition to this the broker also takes 5# as his brokerage fee, so a total of 12^ is taken on the price of the fish. This may seem high, but it has the sanction of custom behind it, and it seems to be no more unpopular than any other tax, 4, At Sur, however, as a temporary measure to facilitate the enforcing of the tax as a principle, the fishermen are practically allowed to declare their own value on the fish.

I thought it as well* however to ascertain what line His Highness proposed to take when the meeting did take place* With regard to the terms reviewed in para- % graph 2 of my memorandum No*C-74 of 29th March 1932, His Highness is willing to continue (a) with effect from the date of the last payment. With regard to lb) he is prepared to pay half l»e. # 600 per annum* and to conti nue (c). He approved of the suggestion* which I put to him* that (c) should be converted into a cash basis* and combined with (b)* thus - as you pointed out in your./^ memorandum N0.221-S of 8th April • in effect giving Shaikh Ali a portion of term (b) without seeming to do bo. With regard to term (d} Hie Highness thought that the four guards should continue to be supplied by the State. 4. His Highness's proposals seem generous# and better for Shaikh Ali than I had anticipated s particularly with regard to term (b), which previously he was strongly against paying. 5. With regard to the ' 9 boats * mentioned in the concluding sentence of my memorandum No.C-106 of 18th May. His Highness explained that by the terms imposed on Shaikh Ali only the dhows belonging to Aiqa meed be registered s not those which belonged to other Bani Bu Ali ports# lashkarah etc. Such boats would# however# have to pay anchorage fees etc.# and of course Customs dues. This disposes of the oompldint in Shaikh All's letter of 11th May paragraph 4* with regard to the Rs.50/- shich was levied, on the cargo of a certain craft. However# these are all points which can be thrashed out between Xfcm His Highness and the Shaikh when they meet.

Your wish is that I should come to Muscat so that you may hare an interview and discuss matters with me. Firstly it is not possible for me to come at present to Muscat as now is the time for the people to c@me and transact business. Secondly I will come to Muscat after an agreement having been made between us because you have not acted according to the Political Resident’s letter which is with me.

You were later informed in my latter of 6th Mr &gt;t tp January 13*32 that the High Government were prepared to support the demands of the Muscat State which the fcli^h Government consider to be perfectly Just and reasonable. Early in March the High Government and the Muscat State in order to euforee these demands collected ships of war, flying boats and the \ Muscat Infantry at Sur,o nd you were informed of their arrival and why they had come there. Still you did not accept the demands of the State.

With reference to our conversation on the subject of dropping c letter over Balad Bnni Bu Ali for Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah. Shaikh Ali has recently been writing some stupid letters to His Highness the Sultan, and I have written to Shaikh Ali informing him that the Sultan is willing to treat him generously notwithstanding his rebellious attitude of last spring, and advising him to come and see His Highness in Muscat and hove a friendly discussion with him. The letter might hove more effect if dropped from a R.A.F.Machine and as you are going to Masiroh in any case, and Baled Bani Bu Ali is only a few miles off your route, I would be grate- ful if you could drop the letter in question which T enclose herewith. The dropping of the letter, however, from the machine is of no particular importance, and if you find that it is in any way inconvenient to drop it please do not do so. Likewise fly as high as you like v/hen dropping the letter.

I have perfectly understood the correspondence. An agreement was written then bsft it was not signed by Sultan Said and until now tne matter has not been finally decided between me and the Sultan. After the Sultan’s departure for India I ''rote to the Council enquiring about the matter but i received a reply after the Sultan’s return. 1 then w^ote a letter to the Sultan and sent a messenger also to Muscat ’'ith a view to put an end to the correspondence. 1 emphasised that I T,T as very desirous that a final agreement with clear terms should be concluded between me and the Sultan and signed by the High ^ritish Government.

Political Agency &amp; H.B.M* e Consulet Muscat, 30th January 1933. tA n &gt;0 fob'71 1 ? Y&gt; A. Dear Colonel, Will you please refer to your confidential demi*officia letter No*54-S of i»th January 1^33« His Highness's great-gaand mother died on the 24th Instant much, I think, to every ones relief. Nevertheless a show of mourning had to be kept up and this, closely followed by curtailed id festivities, precluded my having an interview with the Sultan earlier. &gt; i sent you a telegram (No.lv of 27-ii Instant) accord ingly to explain the delay in answering several of your telegrams. Today being the first opportunity, I had a long interview with His Highness during which the chief topics were the Gwadur case, the Muscat V. Omani case, and the Sur business. In a letter to His Highness last week I had stressed the great importance that attached to getting on with the Gwadur affair without further delay, and the opportune receipt of your telegram(No.73 dated 28th January 1933) asking if the Sultan could not postpose his Batinah tour, lent further weight to my arguments. The Sultan however very much regretted that he could not delay his tour as he had already arranged the summoning of various Sheikhs and officials in accordance with a very full programme that he had issued. The arrival of your telegram No. 73 of 28th January, coinciding w&amp;th His Highness's call on me, afforded me a The Hon'ble Lieutenant-Colonel T. C. Powle, C.B.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf,further chance of emphasising both your views and my own on the urgency of the Gwadur case* His Highness’s only reply was a reiteration of his regret but that he had every hour booJced till he left Sohar by mall on tne 18th February and that he could not leave earlier* It had struck me (on Saiyid Said's first expressing his inability to alter his programme) that the interval against his return might conveniently be filled in by dealing with All bln Abdullah* It takes six days to get a letter to him* A reply from All should therefore reach here in 15 days (allowing three days for All to think over things). Twenty four hours or two days at Sur should be sufficient to ascertain his attitude and we could be back here, knowing the situation, by the 19th February. If All's attitude demands further actxon, the journey to Gwadur will afford time for discussion with the Sultan and reflection as to the methods to be adopted* V y Hence my telegram No*22 to you to-day in idiich I also ftave the numbers that the Sultan wishes to take with him i*e* 25 Muscat Infantry and 20 followers* I think these numbers are suitable alike for his requirements and prestige* The question is as to whether a sloop can convey such a number conveniently? As regards Dhofar I very strongly represented all the , points contained in your demi-official letter No*54-S of the 19th instant and urged on His Highness again the inadvisabilit: from all aspects of a prolonged absence at Dhofar* In reply he said that he could not deal with all he had to do there in under six months and that if he now said he was going for only four months and then did not return in time be he would/considered (by us) as having failed in his word* He pointed out that except for a short visit after last year's Sur operations, he has no experience of Dhofar and that he wants to get to know die people there and for them to know him, and that the present visit will obviate his return to this part of his State for some time to come* ^Saiyid Said quoted the long periods of absence 'on enjoyment' of his father^ against tfiich Government had not only made no protest* but had supported the Council in his absence. Having made His Highness somewhat grudgingly (though cheerfully) admit that his father's absences were not good for the State ('from one point of view' verbatim), I impressed on him that a bad precedent was not a profitable one to follow or quote. I again stressed the fact that should trouble arise during his absence Government would certainly not be pre pared to aipport his Council in the manner that it would sup port himself and that delays in his dealing with any such troubles would only tend to augment and spread them, apart from giving rise to expense which the State could ill afford and which the Government of India would be unwilling to incur. In spite of all efforts Saiyid Said remained adamant the less and said that six months was his minimum at Dhofar. He none / reiterated his hope that Government would continue to support his Council as in his father's time. As regards Sib, I am addressing you officially. I must apologise for addressing you now demi-officially and introducing two subjects in the one letter, but their interconnection renders it difficult to do otherwise and I have adopted the demi-official form in the present case for reasons nfrich I will explain to you in a separate \ communication.

Nothing has happened in these parts to be communi cated to you. I received your letter dated 27th Rajab (27/11/32) stating that your Financial Adviser has informed you that 100 baskets of dates have arrived from Basrah for Ruvmaf and that Khamis bin Said of Aiqa has taken delivery of them and has not paid the Customs duty due on them. Yes Khamis bought at Aiqa 100 half baskets of dates vhich are equal to 50 baskets. He (Khamis) states that your Customs official forego the Customs duty on those baskets. As regard Ruwvaf he has neither received any dates from Basrah nor from any other place. I request that disputes over such matters should be stopped as the terms concerning Aiqa have not tatK yet been decided between me and you.

E« U. Bremner, M. G.» PeliUcal Agent i Coneul t M u 8 o a t. The Hen'ble the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Subject:- Sheikh All bin Abdullah ef Jaatan. Sir, I have the honour to submit herewith a report on the results of my visit to Sur in connection witn the conduct of All bin Abdullah. 2* Prior arrangements as to a meeting having been concluded with Sheikh Ali, in conformation with the proposal contained v x in your telegram No.52 of lath January, I embarked for Sur on 16th instant accompanied by His Highness the Sultan’s represent ative, Saiyid l&amp;ikhmud. 3. A meeting took place with Sheikh Ali on 17th instant, which lasted without intermission from 11 a.m. till 5 p.m. the same day. 4. The previous situation was thoroughly reviewed and the terms that His Highness is now prepared to offer were carefully explained to the sheixh. These terms are contained in Appendix A* attached to tnis report. 5. Fortunately neither Abdullah bin Ahmad ^waf nor Sheikh tfiamis bin Saiyid Sainaidi, the two evil genii of Sheikh Ali, accompanied the latter. This fact, in conjunction with Sheikh All’s apparently friendly attitude at the outset, augured well. 6. In spite of much present explanation ,nd previous en- v lightment to the contrary (including your letter No.C/33 dated 12th November 1*32) Shei.h All still continued to labour undertha delusion that he was entitled to the terms originally offered by His Highness 9 before the undertaking of operations against him in 1^32« ?• He produced # and continually referred to 9 Sir Hugh Biscoe’s letter to him 9 dated 31st December 1931 9 which con tain the terms abere referred to. His attitude was to the effect that their men-fulfillment (though ••backed by the High British Government') had dashed all his hopes as to placing any further reliance on Muscat State 9 whether State action wst endorsed by the High Government or not. 8. He eventually admitted that he had never in writing 9 or by his subsequent conduct 9 indicated his acceptence of these terms 9 nor had ne fulfilled the provisos on which depended the grant of revised terms offered to him later by the Sultan. 9. The Sheikh professed his readiness to be both friendZy with and obedient to His Highness but* on it being clearly vcjp’U sented to him that this comprised full compliance *ith all rcL+idyvJ-** orders issued by His Highness in connection with the refl*-lafcl of dhows and customs duties* he then submitted that he should be allowed to establish his own free port at Ashakar. 10. The impossibility of entertaining any such proposal was immediately brought home to him. 11. An enlightening fact* innocently disclosed by Sheikh All whilst on the topic ef Ashakar* was that an increased amount of trade was already being carried on through that porf 12. without going into iUrther details of the vicissitudes ef the long protracted meeting* ?/hen success at times seemed within an ace of attainment* it will suffice to say that bot/u His Highness' representative and myself came to the conclusion that mucn might be accomplished if the Sheikh of Jaalan could be persuaded to come to Muscat te visit the Sultan. 13. vur endeavours to this effect however were consideraUy hampered by the inborn suspiciousness ef the Bedawi mentality* The undesirability ef myself afferding a safe-conduct t# asubject of the State was obvious* but in its absence* SheiKh Ali wouid accent none other than a safe conduct signed by his Highness personally* It was clear from his conversation that though tne idea of cwining to muscat now appealed to liheiidi All* he genuinely feared treachery and arrest* 14* He then reiterated a request* xaatie at the outset of proceedings* that Saiyid Haidmud and myself should proceed to Aiqa witn nim* Although we were both prepared to accoiai«.ny him in the capacity of private individuals* the livelihood of such a visit being deliberately misconstrued^ to the detriment of (iovernment* s and nis nighness 1 prestige* rendered acceptance impossible* 15* Sheikh Ali finally stated that he would like to address a letter to nis nighness the text of which he assured us would please both the Dultan and ourselves* This he wished to submit for our joint approval the following morning if we would again iand* 16* As however it appeared that no advantage would be grained by further protracting natters* the Sheikh was directed i o s end nis setter en board H.UUS*^hereham' the same evening* 17* On his promising to do so tne meeting broke up and at 10 p*m* the letter* of which a copy and translation is attacned at appendix 'E M * was duly received* 18* The tone of this letter, expressing a definite de sire to come to see His Highness at Muscat* would appear to indicate a change in Sheikh Ali*s attitude tfiich* if genuine and maintained* is promising* 19* m order to afford Sheikh Ail no pretext for sub sequent evasion a further communication was addressed to him informing him of the date on which His Highness is due to return to Muscat and inviting him early to avail himself of tne opportunity of seeing the Suit&amp;n before the latter leaves for Bhofar* 20* bheivh All's reply to this last letter is indicativeXA * S tcia^eriftLiunt* in it lie yreiniaed to send, a fitting and capable ’•representative 1 to Muscat on the Sudtan T &amp; return froja Gv/udur. 8 21. it is to be hepod hovfever that if His m&amp;hneaa concur * in sending him a definite invitation and safe conduct to ceiae to iki'uscat# that nheijdd rt li’s better Judgement will prevail and that he will adhere to the purport of his first letter. 22. in conclusion I would point out that although the object of the mission to Sur would not seem to have been crowned with muen success, a very great advance will have been registered if from our present Joint efisrts, dhei-kh All bin Abdullah is eventually persuaued to visit to- his Highness. 1 have the honour to be, dir, four mast obedient servant, liZSstJor, Political ^gent &amp; IUB.m* s Consul,IduBcat. *P.S.

I beg to state that Major C.E.U.Bremner, British Consul accompanied by Saiyid Mahmud bin Muhammad arrived here* At our meeting they discussed matters with me and I ht'Ve understood your message* They asked me to accompany them to Muscat in order to have an interview with you, but as I had come from Ja'alan with a view to seeing them at Sur only I was not prepated to Journey to Muscat* But God willing 1 will visit Muscat in future. Leaving aside the friendship which existed between our ancestors I have always been firm in ray friendship and have never done any- thing which would cause displeasure. I expect the same from you* This is what had to be said and salaams*toke ony action and that thie fact, being widely known to all and sundry, still further emboldened evil doers. I cannot vouch for the truth of the following incident, told me by a British subject who evidently has Your Highness’s good name very much at heart. I repeat it however in order to indicate the trend of local opinion. In on altercation in the bazar recently on Askori of the Wall hod his face soundly slopped by a local man. No action was token. My informant continued ’’This /skori is not the private His servant of the Wall but is/Highnees’s Askori. He is not supported nor ony enquiry mode. Therefore the authority of His Highness is brought into contempt and his prestige lowered?. Such incidents coupled with representations such os were mode by the British trading community undoubtedly hove engendered o feeling of insecurity among the British subjects of Sur. This in turn, if allowed to , will react adversely on trade and consequently on State revenues. It is for these reasons, and having Your Highness’s interests very closely at heart that I feel it my duty to bring to Your nighness’s notice the situation os I found it. In doing so I trust that Your highness will not consider that I in any way wish to encroach on Muscat State affairs but the evil, if promptly and stronglydealt with now, can be eradicated, whereas delay cannot but lead to the most deleterious results.

Affairs at Sur. I - Sir, I have the honour to refer to correspondence ending with your despatch No. Fo570-N/31, of 7th May 1932, ana to report for the information of the Govern- -ment of Inaia tnat Sui has remained quiet since the action taken there in March of last year, and that the authority of the Muscat State, then restored, has con- -tinued undisturbed. 2. On Shaikh All’s submission the question of what terms he should be given by the State was discussed by His Highness the Sultan, the late Sir Hugh Biscoe, an£ myself • as Political Agent, Muscat. Shaikh Ali having persisted in his rebellions attitude almost literally up to the last minute, and having only sub- -mitted to an ultimatum of bombarding and bombing from sloops and aircraft which had to be concentrated at Sur for the purpose, obviously deserved scant sympathy. On the other hand from certain practical considerations both Sir Hugh and I were in favour of the Shaikh, having actually submitted, even though with a bad grace, being treated as well as possible under the circumstances. There was no question of his apprehension and imprison- -ment: the points to be decided centred round certain allowancesallov/ances ana privileges which he claimed 3* The Sultan, on being approached, was quite prepared to treat the Shaikh well, and of his own accord proposed the following terms (a) Continuance of hie - the Shaikh's - previous political subsidy of fa 1200/- per annum* (b) In addition the granting of ^ 600/- per annum, a new and special allowance as 'compensation', which the Shaikh had claimed for the loss he would be put to on the State, instead of himself, taking customs dues from Aiqa. (c) Continuance of personal exemption from customs dues on certain articles which the Shaikh, and his predecessors, had enjoyed* These terms are, considering the circumstances, very I liberal, and indeed more generous than/would have kmut thought fit to suggest to His Highness. Tinder (a) tfrw and (c) the Shaikh continued to receive his old allow- -ances, and under (b) is granted a new one. Shaikh Ali was accordingly informed that while oy his rebellious attitude he had ipso facto 1orfeiteo all his privileges and allowances, nevertheless His Highness was prepared to treat him kindly, ano that he should come to Muses.t and discuss matters with tne Sultan. He objected to this, insisting that His Highness should come to Sur. The Sultan not unnaturally was of opinion that the Shaikh should come to see him, and as His Highness then proceeded on tour to India, matters hung fire. Since His Highness' return &amp; a desultory correspondence has been kept up between the Shaikh and His Highness, the former sending some boorish missives which the latter has treated with commendable patience. Since it is now the Shaikh who wants some- -thing from the State, and not the opposite as formerly, time was not of rauen importance so long as the Shaikh continued to obey the authority of the State- which hedid. Soaie weeks ago, however, I suggested that, if the Sultan approved, Major Bremner, with a representative of Hie Highness, might visit Sur and have a personal interview with Shaikh *li. His Highness concurred, and on the 17th February Major Bremner, with a. repres- -entative oi His Highness, visited Sur in a sloop, kind* »ly put at hie disposal by the Senior Naval Officer, and had e conversation with the Sheikh, during which the situation, and the terms v;hich the Sultan is pre- •paiec to ofler him, vere once more explained. Shaikh Ali himself is rather a weak char&amp;ctei, swayea hy his evil advisers, two individuals named Abdullan Din Ahmad K&amp;w&amp;f ana Kharais bin Saiyid Sainaidi, and as on this occasion these were not present, his attituoe was friendly anc sensible enough. After a rong inter* -view with Major Bremner ana the Sultan’s representat* -ive, which lasted - so Major Bremner informs me - without intermission from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Shaikh Ali finally wrote a letter saying that he would come to Muscat to see the Sultan. The latter has issued him with a special invitation to do so, and a safe conduct far coming and going, which the Shaikh was anxious to have. There the matter now stands. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servant. So/- T.C.Fowle. Lieut-Col», Political Feeident in the Persian Oulf. No. C-54 of 1933.

There is really nothing to coerce Shaikh Ali for. He has been offered certain terms by the Sultan, which he has not accepted. On the other hand, he and his tribe have behaved themselves and if they continue to do so their refusal to benefit by His Highness’ terms would mean a loss to them, and f 30 not to the Muscat State or to us. For the terms please see my Muscat letter No.C/133 of 15th June 1932, and ray Bushire letter to Government of India,No.3/53 of 4th March 1933. 3 With regard to paragraph 4, I think perhaps the alternative draft which I attach, and which please send to Shaikh Ali under your signature, mi&amp;ht be rather more suitable.

A. C. I have received your letter dated 19th April 1933 and understood its contents# You have stated that the Sultan and Major Bremner have received my letters and that the matter was referred to the Hon’ble the Political Resident, who directed you, as you are acting as Political Agent,Muscat, in the absence of Major Bremner on leave, to inform me that the Sultan is willing to give me generous terms and that Major Bremner explain ed these tenns to Ike during our interview on his recent visit to Sur. The terms are:- (l) That the Sultan will pay my father’s subsidy of ff 1200 per annum (2) in addition to my father’s sub sidy he will grant me a special allowance of &amp; 600 per annum. Total # 1800/-* This amount is in lieu of taking customs duty at Aiqa* (3) I will continue to enjoy exemption from Customs duty on articles which arrive for me and some of my subjects. I have understood all these. I say that I agree provided that the Sultan and the British Government will pay my father’s subsidy of 1200 per annum plus a sum of # 1200 to myself in lieu of Aiqa Customs and exempt the goods which arrive for me at Aiqa as explained by the late Poli tical Resident. 1 agree if the Sultan accept these terms and the British Government certify on them. As to your remark that 1 will be the loser if 1 do not accept the terms, 1 must say that I would neither gain nor lose by getting Rs 1000/- per annum and this amount will neither make me rich nor will be sufficient for my maintenance. As to the proverb that the Sultan set food before me and I do not eat it, the Sultan does not set any food before me. Neither myself nor my predecessors were in need of any food since the last 500 years, but the world changes.

You have accepted the Customs post at Aiqa and it has been established in accordance with former custom. The matter is however not yet finally ended. If the Customs guards are molested or if the people of Aiqa try and evade payment of customs then it will be as though you had not accepted the post, and measures will he taken against you. But if you and your tribesmen at Aiqa act as loyal subjects of the Muscat State, then I am confident that the Muscat State will treat you with their usual generosity.At fchft SA.m tin« «3 t*w» W»vr 1 forces arrive off BUH, or at a tin© to bo decided by tho Political Resident, the Hango ;n flying bonta are to carry oat a de nonet rati on ovor BAUU) iA^JI RU ALI and drop pr*oclanf&lt;tiona warning Bhfiikh All of the RKHX RU /il.I that hio fort will lie bombed if he resists the MU CAT fiovAmnant at AlQA or interferes with the Customs Po?t at th^t place* y.

A« G • I have received your letters dated 19th and 26th Raaazan (28-1 and 4-2-32) respectively and noted what has been mentioned. Rawwaf has also arrived and informed ms verbally and we have also replied vereaxly. In reply to what has been stated in your letter of i9th Ramazan we have to say that the terms are the same liberal ones ef which the Resident informed you and they arej- (1) The Mnscat Government has the right to collect taxes from Aiqa and to register dhows. (2) To appoint four Asharis at Aiqa for collecting taxes two of thej^ Asharis to be from Bani Bu Ali. (3) Net to build sjqcnmi Customs Pest at Aiqa but to hire a house for that purpose. T© grant yen £ 100 in addition t© the £ 100 you receive monthly* you will alse be exempted from paying Customs dues for a certain quantity of goods arriving in your name. Please note that we have accepted this provided that you de not disobey our orders. But with regard to the terms mentioned by you that we should give a document fixing the period of the agreement and recognizing possession etc this^a thing beyend the rules existing between tne suejects and their Government as was pointed out to you when the Hon’ble the political Resident and I visited Sur. The Hon’ble the political Resident and I are visiting Sur in the end ef Shawal when the Customs pest will be established at Aiqa • If you show any resistance then ynm undoubtedly you will be punished. t This letter has been read over to your messenger Shaikh w- ; / ' . •: ■ .Alidulla &amp;1 Hawwaf in the presence ef Gslonei Fowl* the Consul of our friend the Britiah Government. Wt have heresy explained all facts to you so that Jthmx]! there will he no misunderstanding. We have warned you and are therefore not to he hlamedSUR OPERATIONS. Sur, Sunday,6th March 1932. P.R . It may be as well at this stage to consider beforehand what courses of action we should take in the event of certain eventualities and the following are suggestions for your approval. 2. Alban has just reported that Shaikh Ali should arrive at Sur today. Presumably he will arrive to 1 discuss * matters. Having issued our ultimatum the time for discussion* has passed, and it only remains for Ali to comply with them, or take the consequences. We should make sure however, that Ali has received our ultimatum of Friday night: it may possibly have missed him on his way down, though the Wali was asked to instruct the messenger to take the road by which Ali is generally known to visit Sur. when we hear therefore that Ali has arrived in Sur, H.H. might send him a short note enclosing copies of the letters sent on Friday night, 'from which you will see that you have till tomorrow - Monday - at noon to inform us of your intention not to oppose a Customs Post at Aiqa'. 3. If in reply to this Ali asks for an interview with H.H. and yourself^ teas* I think^ it might be granted, provided he comes on board H.H*s ship for the purpose. If he asks for a safe conduct he mighlT be given it. The chief use of the interview would presumably be for Ali to be impressed, if he did not seem already sufficiently impressed, with ourdetermination to 'back the State to the full. 4. One point which Ali may raise will be whether the original terms offered him by the State still hold good; we would be quite justified in saying ‘So*, that as by his rebellious attitude he has caused the State and ourselves to concentrate forces against him, the former generous terms no longer hold good. I do not think, however, th\t it would be advisable at this juncture to complicate the situation by devising new terms, and I suggest that the old ones might hold good till Monday at noon. Ali could be informed to this effect. We will thus be treating him ^ith the utmost leniency and forbearance, and giving him every opportunity to give way. 5. If he gives way, the post will be established at Aiqa tomorrow, and in the same place as formerly intended. It is very suitable for present purposes as it is in full view of the ships. The question of its permanent accommodation can be settl ed later. 6. This having been done presumably the SxjsijLi L/oh packs up and goes home, and we wait to see if the B.B. A. molest the post or not. 7. If Ali does not give in then bombardment at Aiqa, and bombing at 3alad begins on Wednesday, riwU' and the situation on Wednesday/ will be th4,£Aiqa (rc*n * fort will have to -be destroyed^ and the Balad fort in a similar condition or perhaps needing another bombing visit or two. For the forts to be destroyed it is not necessary of course that they should beT O'VVU f {■ ('t* ^Wv.fcv.vVr- .f ^ t? ^ ^ p^v|- ^ -i'^t. ra^ed to the ground: all that is required is ( 5 ^S that suificient damage should have been done to make them incapable of defence. If this is % - i * t'Wt'TruJ^ accomplished at Balad, then visjh, vis thefftr remaine the B.tf. Hassan, who will be glad to take the opportunity of giving them a knock, the power of the B.B. Ali would seem to be definitely affected. ^ 8 . when the Balad fort has been destroyed, prima facie the present mission of the F.Bs. has been accomplished, and they^coald return to Muscat where b)i(ku of course they are in th-e easy flight of here if required for any purpose. The mission of the Muscat Infantry, first guarding the R.A.F. bombs and petrol, and second guarding the F.Bs, will also have Deen accomplished and they can presumably be withdrawn. The R.A.F. will have to decide% what they want done with the petrol and whatever bombs are left. ^ 9. To return to Aiqa. Under notice of bombardment the people of Aiqa will undoubtedly ^evacuate their quarters'*, presumably on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning before neon, and may come to Maqarmitain. Possibly I have discussed this point with H.H.^the best solution will be to allow the women and children Maqarmitain to come in to &amp;elk for food and water, and forbid the men who xhx can shift for themselves. 10 . We have still the establishment of the Customs Post in Aiqa to consider, and I have discussed this point with H.H. and the Y/ali. On Thursday morning / (TO there will presumably be no one in Aiqa. Thirty five) Askaris who are now garrisoning the new Custom House will be sent to occupy four of the six small CU- &lt;. V tr. t O eg ' u a i4 Crf s* i forts which defend Aiqa flfpm the weet-, and also comiaad it, and it* water supply.j In fact theec forte may be said to be the key of Ai ; a. If the Aekarie are frorr* iarca, xza*. /Jai'; «i'. a bombarded, and if any Ban! BmAli are occupying tbe fort», tne latter will be bombarded. (Only, four of the forte vould seem to be/KWlWe^y absent and one of those which is not essential will be bombarded. I imagine that this example will be quite sufficient to eject the 3.B.A from the remainder.), tfhen the Askarishatt occupied the forts the Customs Post will be established.' This should be done by Thursday evening, and the main object of th^ operation will be accomplished.. 11 The expelled inhabitant* of Aiqa will then preeumabljj iBHuricai ask to be allowed to return to their quarters. This might be permitted, H.H* suggests, on suitable guarantees being taken that they meant to bexiave the:nselirjg, 12. smarting under his punishment Ali may stage^. come back and make an immediate attack on Aiqa and Sur- though I think this unlikely, more especially as he will have the B.3.H. on his rea^r. Still the sloops might remain until Friday evening or Saturday morning to see which way the B. 3 .A. cat jumps. If there is no ne ’*8 of cat jumping towards Sur by Saturday morning, the sloops might leave, leaving perhaps one oehind for a fe^ -re d to watch the developments.. I have left the Muscat Infantry in the air (see para 8 above). Whether they should be employed for a short time locally, or return to Muscat straight Way is a matter I should like to discuss with you.The Senior Naval Officer.

Serial No. No. 324:11G.S.-M.O.l. 193T Instructions regarding the Control of Operations including the Employment of flir Forces on the North-West Frontier of India.9*Ln '((S) I his document is issued under the authority of the Government of India. Army Department 1st August 1931. G. M. YOUNG. Secretary to the Government of India. MC143CGS(Mise)* % TIONS INCLUDING THE EMPLOYMENT OF AIR FORCES ON THE NORTH-WEST FRONTIER OF INDIA. 1. These instructions deal with the procedure to be followed in the control of operations on the North-West Frontier of India, where the co-ordinated action of two or more of the three services, political, military and air, becomes necessary. They will be considered as provisional pending confirmation, but in the mean time they supersede ' Instructions regarding the Employment of Aeroplanes on the North-West Frontier”, No. 23639-G. S., M. 0. 1, 1928, and any other instructions previously issued. 2. It is an axiom that in the event of emergency all available forces shall act and shall support each other with the greatest energy and rapidity. This can only be achieved provided :— (a) The closest liaison exists between the political, the air, and the army representatives. (b) There is single control of each operation. 3. Two main principles are involved :— (а) The object of all three forces, irregulars, air and regulars is identical, namely, the prevention of trouble, or the defeat of the enemy and the restoration of normal conditions in the shortest time possible. (б) The most effective way of attaining this is by a co-ordinated plan and by a full measure of co-operation between all the forces available. 4. In applying these principles in times of peace the following procedure which does not require the previous sanction of the Government of India will be followed :— (a) Civil Armed Forces. —The normal day to day watch and ward duties of the civil armed forces will continue to be controlled by the Political authorities as heretofore, including the rounding up of outlaws, laying ambushes for raiders or gun-runners, intercepting raiding gangs, and baramta against hostile tribes. Such activities of these forces are not operations within the definition of paragraph 5 below. (b) Air Reconnaissance. —This does not include any offensive action nor does it commit the Government of India in any way to offensive action. It is merely a protective measure, taken when the situation demands, as an insurance against surprise. The military or civil authorities mentioned below may call for an air reconnaissance without reference to higher authority :— (i) Civil — Chief Commissioner, N. W. F. P. Resident in Waziristan. Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan, and such Deputy Commissioners and Political Agents as the above officials may wish to delegate this authority to. (ii) Military — General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command. General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command. Commander, Peshawar District. Commander. Kohat District. Commander, Waziristan District. *2 (in) General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Northern Command, and General Officer Commanding-in-Chief, Western Command, may, at their descrebion, delegate their authority to any selected sub ordinate Commander. (iv) Air reconnaissance shall not be called for by any military authority except after consultation with the political officer concerned. (d) Whenever possible, the ordinary channels of communication will be adhered to and every opportunity will be taken for consultation between the civil, military and Royal Air Force authorities concern ed. The sanction to dispense with reference to higher authority is accorded solely to avoid delay in an emergency. (c) A ir Demonstration .—This is not offensive action nor does it commit the Government of India to such action. Its employment is a question of policy and is not dictated by the immediate military requirements of the troops or other Government forces. It can be ordered by the undermentioned civil officials on whom will rest the responsibility for calling out aeroplanes for this purpose :— Chief Commissioner, N. W. F. P. The Resident in Waziristan. The Agent to the Goveror General in Baluchistan. (d) Should an unforeseen emergency arise such as the sniping of or the offering of active opposition to any force, whether irregular or regular, by the • tribesmen, the authority under whom the civil forces are acting or in the case of a regular force the District or Force Commander may call for air assistance without reference to higher authority. In such cases aeroplanes may take offensive action provided such action is confined to the tribesmen actually engaged. For the above purpose calls for air assistance will be made to the nearest Wing Commander, Royal Air Force, or to the Officer Commanding, squadron or detachment, Royal Air Force, if the nearest Royal An Force unit is a detached squadron or portion of a squadron. Such calls will be repeated through the usual channels to superior authority, political, military and Royal Air Force. (&lt;?) Mobile Columns .—Whenever a Mobile Column is out, the Commander of the District concerned will arrange through the usual channels, for such air support as may be considered necessary. Officers Commanding No. 1 (Indian) Group or No. 3 (Indian) Wing, Royal Air Force, will make the necessary arrangements and report action taken to Royal Air Force Headquarters. The Officer Commanding a Mobile Column is authorised to employ with his column such aeroplanes as have been detailed to support him. Aeroplanes employed with a Mobile Column can take any action the situation renders advisable with the following exceptions :— 0) No offensive action is to be taken unless hostile sniping or other active opposition is encountered. (ii) Offensive action is limited to that required to deal with actual off enders, i.e., personnel targets only. It will be advisable to use aeroplanes freely for reconnaisance or for demonstrations in con nection with any operations or march of a Mobile Column. (f) Retaliation against rifle fire from the ground .—When aeroplanes carrying out any of the duties described above are subjected to deliberate and definitely hostile fire from the ground and the individuals responsible for such firing can be clearly discerned, they may, in the absence of specific instructions to the contrary issued beforehand by com petent authority, retaliate in their own defence with machine gun fire or bombs against such individuals. This action must not be taken indiscriminately and is never to be used against villages.3 5. W hen a more serious situation arises involving offensive action not provided for m paragraph 4 such action will be classified as “ an operation ” and will require the orders of the Government of India as soon as they can be obtained. 6. Operations fall into two classes :— (1) those which are deliberately undertaken against the tribes, (2) those which are forced upon the local officers by tribal action. 7. In dealing with operations forced upon them by tribal action local officers of all services, political, military and air will— (а) consult together as fully as circumstances allow, (б) make the best arrangements that the means at their disposal admit, (c) report the facts and submit their recommendations to higher authority as fully and promptly as they can. 8. In such cases or when the deliberate initiation of operations is advocated, the Government of India, on receipt of a recommendation from the Chief Commis sioner, North-W est Frontier Province or Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan which is to be made in the manner prescribed in paragraph 9 below, will decide whether operations are to be undertaken, or continued if they are already in progress, and specify the general objective. 9. The following procedure will be observed : — {i) Whenever the Chief Commissioner, North-West Frontier Province or Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan, either on receipt of a report from an officer subordinate to him. or of his own motion, is of opinion that operations whether by land, or air or both should be under taken against a tribal enemy in the area for which he is responsible, he shall after consultation with the appropriate military and air Commander, forward his recommendation by telegram to the Secre tary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Depart ment, repeating to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Army Department. {ii) The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department on receipt of such recommendation will at once bring it to the notice of the Government of India and the Secretary to the Government of India in the Army Department will similarly bring it to the notice of His Excellency the Conunander-in-Chief and inform the General and Air Staffs. (Hi) When the Government of India have decided that operations are to be undertaken, control of those operations vests automatically in His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief who has power to delegate control of operations to such officer as he may select. (;iv) Control of operations includes the selection of local objectives with the concurrence of the political atithorities, the initial framing of the plan, the selection of the forces required to carry out that plan, the dispositions of these forces both in the initial stage and sub sequently in order to deal with developments as they arise, and the allocation of tasks to the several components of the force. (^) Such delegation of control does not transfer to the officer selected either the executive command of units of another service or give him power to interfere with the methods adopted by executive commanders of such units to carry out the tasks assigned to them. (vi) Should the operation entail the offensive action of land forces, whether regular or irregular, with or without the co-operation of aircraft His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief will normally delegate the control of such operation to a Military Commander. (vii) Should an objective be beyond the reach of land forces and necessitate air action, His Excellency the Commander-in-Chief will normally delegate the control of such operation to the Air Officer Commanding with whom the military forces will co-operate as required.4 MC143CGiS(Mis)—300—30-7-31—GIPS 10. Air action against villages must never be undertaken except after due warning as in paragraph 11 below, and with the previous sanction of the Government of India. 11. Warnings .—These are quite distinct from “ demonstrations ” [paragraph 4 (c)] and although they do not include offensive action, they definitely commit the Government of India to such action if the warning is ignored or is not considered to have achieved its object. These require the previous sanction of the Government of India. The normal minimum period of a warning is 24 hours. 12. In order that the fullest use may be made of the air arm, to act rapidly in any direction that may be required, central control is necessary, and the control of squadrons, other than those detailed to co-operate with the land forces, will not normally be delegated except for a definite and limited operation. 13. Prohibited Flying Zone During Operations .— The rules relating to peace time flights on the North-West Frontier of India are laid down in Government of India (Army Department) orders No. 15706/II/3 (G. S., M. 0. 1), dated the 13th November 1930. Unless a state of war with Afghanistan exists or unless the Government of India’s sanction has been accorded in a special emergency, no tribal air operation justifies the violation or the risk of violation of the Afghan Frontier. The serious political consequences which are liable to result from such infringement should be strongly impressed on all concerned and in no circumstances may the prohibited zone be entered by aircraft without the special permission of the Government of India. 14. Captured Airmen .—The following uniform procedure is to be adopted by all authorities as a precaution against or in the event of an aircraft having to make a forced descent in tribal territory. {a) All personnel in Royal Air Force aircraft flying over tribal territory on a peaceful mission or on operations should carry a copy of a form translated into the appropriate language. This form, which should be obtained from the local political authority, should state that the bearer is flying on duty under the orders and protection of the Government of India ; that he is to be given good treatment and brought in safely to the nearest Government post at once upon which a suitable reward will be paid. If he is harmed, however, the Government of India will heavily punish those concerned. (b) Political action should be taken immediately an aircraft is believed to have made a forced landing. Messengers should be sent in, and leaflets, of which a stock should be maintained, dropped to the tribes concerned, instructing them that the occupants are to be brought in. If operations are in progress against the tribe, it should be pointed out that these operations are going to continue, in any case, until the tribe has submitted, and that if any prisoner is harmed heavy punishment will be exacted. (c) The reward to be paid will necessarily vary with the circumstances. It should be promptly paid, and its amount should be at the discretion of the political authorities concerned. {d) Officers and others flying on duty should carry always a printed card with phrases in Pushtu which are likely to be useful in the event of a forced landing.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d5_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/R/15/6/206</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d5</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/R/15/6/206</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'File 8/21 II MUSCAT STATE AFFAIRS: DEPENDENCIES – SUR (OPERATIONS).'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1932/1934</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2018-04-19T22:05:00</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">ara</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 file (264 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the front to the rear of the file.</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence (used for referencing) commences at the front cover with 1, and terminates at the inside back cover with 266; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.

It documents actions taken and considered by the Government of Muscat and Oman (with military assistance from the British Government) in order to assert its authority over the coastal town of Sur and the surrounding area, including Aiqa [Al ‘Ayjah], a village inhabited by members of the Bani Bu Ali [Banī Bū ‘Alī] tribe.The file primarily concerns customs control, and the correspondence discusses at length a dispute between the Sultan of Muscat and Oman [Sa‘īd bin Taymūr Āl Bū Sa‘īd] and the Shaikh of Aiqa, Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah, regarding the Government's attempts to establish a customs post in the village. Notable correspondents include the following: the Political Agent and Consul, Muscat; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Commanding Officer at Air Headquarters, Iraq Command; the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf; Captain Reginald George Evelyn William Alban, Financial Adviser to the Government of Muscat and Oman; the Sultan of Muscat and Oman; Shaikh Ali bin Abdullah Al Hamudah.The correspondence covers the following: preparations for combined 'punitive operations' (i.e. the naval bombardment of Aiqa's fort and the aerial bombardment of Ja'alan by the Royal Navy and RAF respectively) in the event of Shaikh Ali's refusal to comply with the Sultan's demands; contributions made by the Government of Muscat and Oman towards expenses incurred by the RAF during its recent aerial reconnaissance of the area; a meeting between the Political Agent and Shaikh Ali at Sur on 17 February 1933; the terms offered by the Sultan to Shaikh Ali.Also included in the file is a brief report entitled 'Instructions regarding the Control of Operations including the Employment of Air Forces on the North-West Frontier of India', dated 1 August 1931 and produced by the Government of India (ff 68-72).The Arabic language material mainly consists of correspondence between the Political Agent, Shaikh Ali, and the Sultan of Muscat (English translations are present in almost all cases).</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><name type="corporate"><namePart>Air Officer Commanding, Iraq</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Emir of Ja'alān</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent; subject</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Financial Advisor to the Sultan of Muscat</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Sultan of Muscat and Oman, Āl Bū Sa'īd Dynasty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Sur</geographic></subject><subject><geographic>Aiqa</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Customs administration</topic></subject><subject><topic>Military operations</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction"><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000831.0x0003d5#share</url></accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
