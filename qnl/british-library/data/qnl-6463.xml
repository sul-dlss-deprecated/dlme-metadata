This route is now so frequently traversed by Europeans and has been so often described that it is unnecessary for me to say any thing about it. ( arr ages do go from Tehran to Ispahan and so on to Shiraz, but in its present con dition the road hardly deserves to be dignified with the name of a carriage road. A plan, however, has now been started to construct a road available for wheeled traffic, and about 18 or 20 miles of it has been completed, started from Tehran by the Shah Abdul Azim gate, as far as the foot of the low range of hills lying between the capital and Kenaraguird. Here, however, it stops, and neither when I first passed that way, at the end of October, nor on my return journev in January, was any work being done. I am informed that the idea is to avoid the strip of salt desert lying between Haws-i-Sultan and Pul-i-Dellak, by taking the new road in a more westerly direction towards Saweh. Ihe Kohrood pass would also be avoided by taking the Natenz route. This construction of this road presents no great difficulties and the cost would not be excessive. I reached Ispahan on the evening of the 29th of October, and there met Captain Wells, II.E., Assistant Superintendent of the Indian Government Telegraph, who had inarched from Tehran to make his yearly inspection of the line. We had previously arranged to travel together through the Bakhtyari country to Shuster. Hiring mules and other necessary arrangements delayed us unavoidably for several days. Shuster lies quite off the beaten track, and it is by no means easy to get Persian muleteers to travel over roads to which they are unaccustomed. Moreover the Bakhtyari mountains are looked upon as something fearful by the ordinary inhabitants of 1 r.ik, and many were the stories of the difficulties and dangers we should have to encounter. There were dense forests, raging torrents, perilous mountain passes, and fierce inhabitants. After much haggling we struck a bargain with a native of Kohrood who was to provide 13 mules at the rate of Ks. 2^ a day per mule, and on the 4th of November we started from Julfa. On leaving Julfa the road takes a south-westerly direction and passes to the right of the hill of Fakhte Rustem and close under the rock known as the “ Sphinx,” enters the extensive plain of Lower Lenjan. This district is said to contain 366 villages, an estimate I should consider exaggerated. It is however decidedly well populated and fertile, the principal product being rice, which is grown in large quantities. Every village contains several pigeon towers, the guano of the birds being used as manure. I en miles out of Julfa we came to the village of Pul-i-Vergoun and crossed the Zenderood river by a good bridge. Here we stayed the night. i he Acting Governor of Ispahan sent two sowars with us to accompany us to the first Bakhtyari village. bth November .—Leaving Pul-i-Vergoun the road runs through rice fields to the village of Guelnk and to Baghe-Vahshi. At the latter place Shah Abbass is said to have had a menagerie, and the remains of a large enclosure are still seen. From this point the aspect of the country changes, and cultivation is replaced .by that barren, stony, waterless soil of which one sees so much in Persia from the banks of the Araxes to the limits of Pars. 1 From Baghe Vahshi the road ascends gradually and crosses the Gerdeneh Gaopisse (altitude by aneroid 6,400 feet). On the right another road comes in here from Nejef-Abad, joining our road at a small hut built for the Rahdari collector. For about 100 yards after leaving this hut the road is somewhat rough and rocky, but it soon improves and descends into the plain of Upper Lenjan. From the Gerdeneh Gaopisse the roads lead to the different villages of the latter district; one on the left goes to Reesch and Gholam Khass, one in the centre to Chengown, and one on the right, which we followed, to Pul-i-Kelle. The latter was our dipect road to Chemini, our halting place for the night, but as Captain Wells. * The names have throughout been printed as spelt by Mr. Baring.wished to take an observation from a point on the right bank of the Zenderoods opposite Chengoun, we sent on our mules and servants, and riding across the plain to Chengoun, forded the river. Ascending a low hill we obtained a good view of the plain of Upper Lenjan, which, though apparently not so fertile as the lower district contains many villages ; looking down stream one sees the village of Mubareka on the left, and near the hills the villages of Ketchous and Hardenk. Proceeding up stream on the right bank of the river we reached the village of Chemini (5,750 feet) at 6.30 p.m., and were lodged in the house of the Ketkhuda. Distance from Pul-i-Vergoun a little over 25 miles. I oi ty shah mauns (lbs. 520) of opium were produced at Chimini last season, and sent to Ispahan. 6M November .—Owing to one of my horses being ill we considered it advisable only to do a short stage to Cav-e-roukh, said to be three farsakhs off. We occupied the morning in riding down to the river at Pul-i-Kelle. Here there is a bridge sadly out of repair. The river was between high banks, and the scenery is, for Persia decidedly picturesque. Much rice is grown along the water’s side. Left Chemini at 1.30 p.m., the road running nearly due we-t, over a stonev and barren country, to the village of Siahbeed, where there is a little cultivation. After passing Kale Agha it turns to the left over the Gerdeneh Rukh, the village of Kuli Shah Rukh lying a little way ahead on the right. A ride of three-quarters of an hour took us to the top of the pass (7,650 feet). Near the summit there is a bad bit of road winch however might easily be put to rights. Leaving the road we walked up the hill above the pass and obtained a fine view of the mountains about Cav-e-roukh on the one side, and over a wild and desolate tract of country called the Sahra-i- Mussiabad on the other. Descending the hill at sunset we rode along the valley by a good road to the village of Cav-e-roukh (6,700 feet), which we reached at 7.30 p.m. Oui mules did not get in till past 8, and though the distance from Chemini is said to be only 3 farsakhs, it is certainly not less than 17 miles, from the pass to the village being about 8 miles. The fact is that the Persian farsakh, anywhere off the post roads, is about as inaccurate a measure of distance as one well could find. Our lodging for the night was a gloomy and somewhat dirty room. 1th November. — Sharp frost early in the morning. Rode down the valley by a good road in a westerly direction to where another valley running north at right angle&gt; joins the one in which Cav-e-roukh lies. We could make out three villages in the former The road then runs over a low ridge to the village of Takoun, situated m a small uell cultivated basin. Close to Takoun lies another village called Heft Zenjoun. Wheat and barley are the principal products, and considerable quantities of both are apparently grown. After leaving Takoun the road runs along a cultivated valley formed by the river Hereje, which is crossed by a good brick bridge. The village of Shemsabad is then passed, alter which the road runs between two consider able mountains, the Kuh-i-Jahanbin on the right and the Kuh-i-Zengouin on the left and reaches the village of Hereje, where the river is again crossed by a roughly built but strong bridge. Here one loses the river. Passing through Hereje we ascended a ridge, and then had a short but rather steep descent to Shelamsar, where we spent the night in a very fair house. The natives cal it 5 farsakhs from Cav-e-roukh, but in reality it is a good 25 miles, 10 to Takoun and 15 more on to Shelamsar. Saw very^ large flocks of sheep and goats near Hereje; wheat, barley, and small quantities of opium are grown. All through the district of Chahar Mahal, and as far as Shelamsar, the road had been remarkably good, and, with a little expenditure of money in one or two places might be made available for wheeled traffic. The route we followed to get to Ardell, the Hrst Bakhtyari village we reached, was not the same as that taken by Mr. Mackenzie. That gentleman went from Teerah which is three farsakhs from Cav-e-roukh to Gehroo and Chakakhor, the latter place being the summer quarters of the Eelkhani of the Bakhtyaris. Captain Wells and I crossed straight over the Gerdeneh Zereh from Shelamsar, and, but for the sowars sent from Ispahan knowing very little about the road, could have easily marched to Ardcll m one day. November.— 11 dy morning and rather threatening. Crossed a small stream, which, alter making a circuit of about six farsakhs, finds its way through a gorge inthe mountains and falls into the, Ardell river, and going south soon began the ascent of the Gerdeneh Zerefl*' Rain came on heavily and changed into snow as we ascended the pass. The ascent is steep though not long. In one place the path passes through narrow rocks, where loaded mules have to be got through carefully. On reaching the summit (9,150 feet) we were encountered by a violent gale and driving snow, the view being ofxourse entirely obscured by mist. Descent steep and rough, ending in a small plain, in which is a little lake where we saw great numbers of’ wild ducks and coots. His Royal Highness the Zil-es-Sultan had been good enough to provide us with a letter of introduction to the Eelkhani of the Bakhtyaris, who had left his summer quarters at Chakakhor, and was marching down country. On leaving Shelamsar we entrusted this letter to one of our Ispahan sowars, who was to take it to Nakoun, the village at which it was said we should have to pass the night, as to reach Ardell was impossible. On making the top of the Gerdeneh Zereh, Captain Wells and I dis mounted and walked down the mountain, and missing the road to Nakoun found ourselves at Ardell at about 2.30 p.m., thus proving that it would have been perfectly easy for the mules to have reached the latter place from Shelamsar. The road we followed, after leaving the plain mentioned above, ascends again slightly, and then after winding along the side of the hill for some distance, and passing through the Charlar Erzeneh (in the Lur dialect the “ valley of the almond trees'’), mentioned by Mr. Mackenzie, descends into a fine valley in which Ardell is situated. Distance from Shelamsar, 19^ miles. Ardell (6,000 feet) is a wretched little Bakhtyari village, which contains one good house belonging to Reza Kali Khan, the brother of the Eelkhani. We were of course quite unexpected, and the people had not the smallest conception who we wi re or what our business was. The sudden arrival of two Feringhees bedaubed with mud, and generally presenting a draggled and even disreputable appearance, excited astonish ment, but still every one was perfectly civil. After waiting for some time the sowars who had been sent on to Nakoun turned up, and finding that it would be impossible for the mules to come to us till late at night we determined to go to them. The distance to Nakoun is called 1^ farsakhs. I should be inclined to reckon it at eight miles, as it took us three hours steady riding on fast walking horses. At Nakoun we were hospitably entertained by the Eelkhani’s cousin, a fine looking man of about five and forty. 1 am not aware of any other Europeans having crossed the Gerdeneh Zereh; it is the shortest road from the Hereje valley to Ardell, but is never likely to have any importance commercially. In winter it is closed, but in summer and in fine weather it presents no great difficulties for beasts of burden. Owing to the nature of the soil, however, after rain the path becomes very bad going. At present it would be impracticable for guns. The Chakakhor road is said to be open all the winter. The following is said by natives to be the directest road from Ispahan to- Chakakhor:— Ispahan to Avamil Avamil to Komeshli - Komeshli to Gulujan - Gulujan to Chakakhor - 4 farsakhs. - 6 „ - 4 „ - 5 „ 19 farsakhs. Nakoun (6,900 feet) is a small Bakhtyari village, containing 200 male inhabitants, and paying it is said “a yearly revenue to the Eelkhani of 5,000shah mauns of grain and tomans 300. I suspect, however, this statement is exaggerated, as the peasants are greatly inclined to overstate what they have to pay in order to excite commiseration, while on the other hand their authorities greatly understate the amount they exact. 9M November .—Wells being anxious to reascend the Gerdeneh Zereh for the purpose of taking observations, we determined only to go hack as far as Ardell, and there stay the night. On arriving we were met by Abbass Kuli Khan, the son of the Eelbeggee, and nephew of the Eelkhani, who treated us with great civility. He is a young man of about 26 or 27, of pleasant manners, sprightly and intelligent, and totally devoid of fanaticism; his health is unfortunately bad.To the east of Ardell, in the direction of Nakoun, a Stream rises in the Kuh-i-Sebze, which, flowing from south-east to north-west, falls into the main branch of the Karoun at DopJoim. The latter rises in the Zerdeh Kuh, north-west of Ardell, and flows south-east to Dopuloun. Near its sources it is called the Ab-i-Kohrenk On the southern side of Ardell rises the lofty peak of the Kuh-i-Gereh, according to the natives the highest mountain in the range; it had snow on the southern slope, and its height must be over 13,000 feet. 1 It may not he out of place here to say a few words about the Bakhtyari tribe. Sir John Malcolm, in his History of Persia (vol. 2 , p. 07 ), states that in 1736 “the “ peace of the country round Ispahan had been much disturbed by the depredations “ of a numerous and barbarous tribe called Buhkteearees The subjugation ‘‘of these plunderers had ever been deemed impossible.” Nadir Shah, however invaded the country, conquered the tribe, and put their chief, Ali Murad to death. The same author (vol. 2 , p. 265) says, “ The Bukhteearees and several other tribes “ can hardly be said to have ever entirely submitted to the kings of Persia.” Aftoi the death of Nadir Shah the tribe became again completely independent and was unsuccessfully attacked by Agha Mahommed in 1785 during his struggle with Jaaffer Khan. This independence continued till the reign of Mahommed Shah, when the Mootemid-ed-dowleh, Governor of Ispahan, and curiously enough an Armenian attacked and subdued Mahommed Taki Khan and Naki Khan, two formidable chiefs’ who lived at Kale Toul. These two Khans were sent as prisoners to Tehran, where they died, their sons being retained in the capital as hostages. After this the chief authority at Kale Toul was conferred upon a certain Ali Reza Khan, whose sons are still in power. Another chief named Essed Khan also successfully defied the Persian Government who were unable to drive him from his “ dez ” or' stronghold. At his death he was succeeded by his son Jaaffer Kuli Khan, who was defeated by the Mootemid-ed-dowleh arnl taken prisoner. Alter seven years captivity he contrived to escape but his fannly stronghold being occupied by Persian troops he was unable to regain his lost power. 1 he Kclkhani, Hussein Kuli Khan, has held his post for ten years. Ever since the piesent Shah came to the throne in 1848 he began to make his power felt and gradually overcoming all other rivals, worked his way to his present position His prmcpal opponents were his cousins, Aboul Feth Khan and Hyder Khan,' the sons, and Ali Dad, the son-in-law of Kelb Ali Khan. These competitors, however, he contrived to remove from the scene, after which the field was left open to him. Hussein Kuli Khan is the son of Jaaffer Kuli Khan and grandson of Habib Oullah Khan. Hussein Kuli Khan’s rule has been decidedly beneficial to the cause of public order in Persia. It is not so very long ago that the Bakhtyaris were the most notorious robbers in the country. Not only did they carry on their depredations in the neigh bourhood of their own districts, but bands of them have been often known to sweep doun upon the Ispahan and Tehran road and rob travellers and caravans. This brigandage Hussein Kuli has succeeded in putting down, and under bis rule the Bakhtyari hills are now safe enough. I should be sorry, however, to assert that peace and tranquillity will continue to reign when the present Eelkhani dies; his name commands immense respect and every tribesman trembles before him. At his death, however, it will be strange indeed if more than one candidate does not spring up and contend for the vacant post. The Persian Government vmre suo will confer it upon the man who pays the largest sum down, or who offers to squeeze most revenue out of the people. Factions wiil be formed and disturbances will take place, the tribe probably returning not unwillingly to its old predatory habits. At present it is merely the Eelkhani’s personal power which keeps down brigandage, and it is perhaps not too much to say that thou.h no molestation is offered to the travelh r every Bakhtyari regrets the good old da\s when he was looked upon as fair game. At one village we passed through I know the people complained how hard it was that the Eelkhani would not allow them to plunder us Now that the power of the Kasl gaes of Ears has been In ken the Bakhh ai is are undoubted^ the most powerful tribe in Southern Persia. Unlike the Lurs of Luristan the Kobgelu and the Mamasseni, they are united, by tar the greater portion of them implicitly obeying the eelkhani. The Kashgaes are, 1 believe, numerically stronger than the Bakhtyaris, but have really less power. One section of the Bakhtyari tribe, residing in the neighbourhood of Buruiird does not owe allegiance to Hussein Kuli Khan.Statistics are of course unknown in Persia, and it is therefore very difficult to give a correct estimate of the population in any portion of the country, but the difficulty is increased when one is dealing with nomads. Including the Burujird section I have heard the tribe estimated on good authority at 30,000 families. Reckoning each tamily at five members, this would give a population of 150,000 souls. 1 he Eelkhani is subject to the Prince Governor of Ispahan, and receives tomans 1,000 per annum as salary. He has two brothers, one, Imam Kuli Khan, who is the Eelbeggee of the tribe, and accompanies it on its bi-yearly migrations; he receives a salary of tomans 500 per annum ; the other, Reza Kuli Khan, is Governor of Cbahar Mahal, which district, though not forming part of the Bakhtyari country, has been farmed to the Eelkhani. The Bakhtyaris are divided into two great sections, the Heft Lenk and the Chahar Lenk ; the former being again sub-divided into Douraki and Babaki, and after that into multifarious smaller divisions. The Chahar Lenk are also sub-divided, the principal section being the Taneki, who are in turn divided into the Taneki Guermessir, who live at Kale Toul, and the Taneki-Serdessir, who live at Gerdebiche, Khane Mirza, and Malemeer. The Bakhtyaris pay tomans 14,000 a year to Ispahan, and give the Government 200 horsemen. The revenue is entirely collected and the taxes assessed by the Eelkhani, the Persian Government not interfering. The greater portion of the tribe are“Eelyats” or nomads, but some do live permanently in villages. Their flocks form their greatest wealth, and they yearly sell large numbers of sheep, either driving them themselves to Chahar Mahal and Ispahan, or selling them to dealers who come over to Ardell. A good sheep will fetch from krans 10 to krans 15 (7s. 5d. to 11s. l&lt;tf.), a lamb about krans 6 (4,v. od.). A considerable quantity of charcoal is burnt in the wooded hills to the south of Ardell, and taken over to Chahar Mahal for sale. Fire wood is also exported. Wheat and barley are grown throughout the district, but hardly enough for the wants of the population, who in many places subsist largely on acorn bread. Rice is grown in some places, especially about Helisat and Malemeer. Clarified butter and skins are also exported. The bulk of the fox and other skins which find their way to the Ispahan market come however, I believe, from Chahar Mahal. The Bakhtyari women employ a good deal of their time in the manufacture of carpets. These, however, are coarse, the colours glaring and the patterns untastefully arranged. They are sold by weight fetching from krans 7 to krans 10 the shah maun of 13 lbs. Most of the goats’ hair produced in the country is used by the people in the manu facture of their tents. I confess to having been somewhat disappointed in the Bakhtyaii horses. I had heard the breed highly praised and expected to see more powerful and better shaped animals. With the exception of one four-year old mare, ridden by Abbass Kuli Khan. I saw not a single horse in the country that I should have much cared to possess. Mares are universally ridden, and I saw no one riding an entire horse. The people say they find it pay better to sell the colts, keeping the fillies for breeding purposes. The Eelkani himself keeps stallions, and the mares are sent to them to be served. The mares that I saw were certainly wonderfully active and went over the rough mountain roads like goats, but their shape disappointed me. Most of them were unshod behind. The Kashgaes were at one time renowned for their breed of horses, but in the last 12 years it has fallen off greatly. Horsebreeding in Persia, in fact, does not pay, and is going down hill like most other things in the country. If one speaks to a man about horse breeding one usually gets the same answer, “What is the use of my “ breeding a good fo^l ? Before I can sell him some great man will hear of him, and “ I shall have to present him as a ‘ peshkash.’” This answer I heard not once’ but repeatedly during my journey. The Eelkhani receives from the tribe tax on agricultural produce and sheep tax, both in money and kind ; krans 25 being paid on every hundred sheep. The Bakhtyaris are of course profoundly ignorant of everything that goes on outside their own mountains. r l here are mollahs among them who are supposed to teach the children, but education is as yet at a very low ebb. Though wild, however, the majority of them show no fanaticism. Their women go about unveiled and do not avoid the gaze of the ruder sex. The veil, however, is practically unknown among the Eelyats of Persia. 6978. BThe Bakhtyari villages that we passed were extremely squallid and miserable, and complaints of great poverty were tolerably universal. The Lur dialect is spoken throughout the district, and is said to bear a great affinity to old Persian. It is rather harsh but usually intelligible to a person fairly acquainted with Persian, and not nearly so difficult to understand as some other dialects, £.^.,that spoken at Soh, between Ispahan and Kachan, and that spoken in Mazanderan. I subjoin a table of a few Lur words which 1 was able to pick up, giving the Persian equivalents. Lur. Persian. Lur. Persian. Baon Baba, Peder F ather. Derou - Pain - Down. Da Mader - - Mother.

I am not aware of the dialects of Persia having been as yet carefully studied by a competent scholar. Dr. Andreas may possibly have made researches but I am not aware of his having published anything. I venture to think that the subject is well worthy of the attention of some person well acquainted with old Persian. KM November .—Left Ardell at 8.15 a.m. in a southerly direction, accompanied by Abbas Kuli Khan. The road first passes over an undulating country, a very fine view of the Kuh-i-Gereh being obtained from one point. Very large ibex are found on this mountain it is said, and the royal partridge (Kebk-i-Dari) is stated to be plentiful. As we advanced the hill sides became more and more wooded; at first only brush wood was seen here and there, but oak, ash, hawthorn, wild almond, and pistachio soon made their appearance and got more plentiful as we went on. The oak trees were but too often cut and hacked about in the most reckless way. No signs of planting were visible anywhere. About an hour after leaving Ardell we met Reza Kuli Khan, the brother of the Eelkhani. After taking leave of him we rode on for a short half hour to a place where the road turns to the left and makes a steep and rapid descent into a valley formed by the stream coming down from the Kuh-i-Sebze, which I mentioned above. The path is very narrow at the best of times, and a portion of it having given way, it was necessary to unload all the mules and have the loads carried over the damaged bit. At the bottom of this hill, close to the stream, is a perfect collection of splendid springs, which come rushing out of the rock. Followed the stream for some little way and eventually crossed it, the water taking the horses about up to their knees. Reached Dopoloun, a little village of about 50 houses, at 3 p.m. The Kuh-i-Sebze stream falls into the Kohrenk or Karoun opposite the village, the former is crossed by a common country bridge, but the latter is spanned by a solid one built of brick. Most of the road from Ardell was decidedly bad, in one place it was so narrow that a mule having run his load against the side of the hill was knocked over into the stream below. Distance from Ardell eight miles. The sun in the valley was hot and the atmosphere close. Wth November .—After taking leave of Abbass Kuli Khan we started from Dopoloun at 8 a.m., and crossing the two bridges mentioned above turned up a hill, going almost due south.IV I 1 t During the whole day’s march the road passes through well wooded hills. In places it is stony and the perpetual ups and downs makes it tiring for horses. Charcoal burning was going on all over the hill sides. At 11.30 a.m. we reached a small stream where we were met by some horsemen sent to conduct us to the Eelkhani’s camp. From this point a ride of three-quarters of an hour took us to the top of the pass (7,700 feet), from which a fine view of the lofty peak of Kuh-i-Kelar, lying to the north-west is obtained. This mountain looks about 14,000 feet. The descent proved to he a good deal steeper than the ascent, as far as a small stream (6,200 feet) near which we observed the finest oaks we had yet seen. After leaving this stream we turned into a fine wild gorge with the dry end of a torrent on the right hand and magnificent perpendicular rocks on both sides. The road then ascends a ridge to the height of 6,450 feet and then descending slightly rises again to 6,600 feet, after which it descends continually to a valley (4,850 feet) formed by a stream coming in through a gorge on the right. Proceeding a little distance down the valley we reached Helisat (4,700 feet) at 4.30 p.m. The scenery all day had been extremely picturesque. Saw a few red-legged partridges and numbers of jays, which latter birds appear to swarm all dver the oak woods. Distance from Dopoloun 19 miles, the natives calling it six farsakhs. Met numbers of donkeys laden with rice which is grown all about Helisat. We found that the Eelkhani had his camp pitched close to the little village of Helisat; he received us most courteously and had a tent pitched for us. Hui •seinKuli Khan is a fine stalwart man of about 60 or 62, the very picture of rude health. As I have said he was most civil, but one could not help seeing that he was also a trifle suspicious, and though eager to talk about Russia and Afghanistan, Kuldja, and every other conceivable political topic, he was somewhat reticent about the affairs of his own tribe, it puzzled him to understand what could have brought us there, as of course like every other oriental, he simply scouted the idea of any sane person travelling for travelling's sake. He is in favour of the opening of the Karoun to free navigation, but would not be altogether pleased to see a good road made through his mountains, as it would naturally weaken his now very independent position. It was easy to see what a power the Eelkhani is among the tribe, as the veneration and respect with which he was treated by all was quite remarkable. He pressed us to march down as far as Malemeer with him, but though it would have been interesting to do so, and though by living in closer contact with him for a few days, one might have got valuable information, time would not allow of our accepting his offer, as he naturally progressed much slower than we did. Vlth —After taking leave of the Eelkhani, and having some further con versation with him, we get off at 8.30 a.m. and travelled nearly due west all day. Ascended a bill by a tolerably good road through a wood, to a height of 6,250 feet ; then descended slightly and then went up again to 6,700 feet j then descent again to some eeliat tents, where there is a fair amount of cultivation carried on by the occupants who migrate down to the lower villages in the winter. The water here is bitter. After leaving the tents the road again descends a little and then rises to the top of a crest (5,575 feet) whence there is a fine view of the mountains above Malemeer. The descent is at first easy but soon gets very steep and ditheult, the path being narrow and the gradients often not more than 18 feet in length. It is as bad a piece of road as one could wish for, and reminded me of some of the mountain tracks in the Elburz. At last we reached the valley of the Rudbar river, an affluent of the Karoun, which we forded, and camped on the right bank. The breadth of the river is about 55 yards. Altitude of camp 2,850 feet, distance from Helisat 15 miles. Mr. Mackenzie, who travelled through this country in the spring when the river would be high, could not of course ford the Rudbar, he consequently took the road from Dopoloun to Sheleel, and crossed it by a bridge. 13M Not'ember .—Left at 7.30 a.m. and at once ascended a shoulder of the hill to avoid a very narrow and bad bit of road near the bank of the river. The road then dips down to the waters edge and then turns sharp to the left up a stony gorge; alter follow ing this for a short distance it mounts a steep hill, near the top of which there is a curious formation of rocks. The hillside is covered with enormous slabs of rock which give it the appearance of a glacier, out of which trees grow, for the8 country is well wooded. These slabs of rock extend over the road and being very slippery made it bad going lor horses. A short distance from the top of the hill the rocks cease and the road is then good to the summit (6,250 feet). The descent is at first gradual but soon gets steep enough to make walking pleasanter than riding. Reached Dehdez at 11.45 a.m. The village contains 100 houses and is surrounded by a square wall surmounted by five towers. Distance from Rudbar 12 miles, As the stage had been so short we wanted to go on at once to the Karoun river, so as to be ready for the crossing on the following day, and as things turned out afterwards we might perfectly have done so, but our guides were loud in asserting that we should gain nothing, that we must camp a night on the bank, &amp;c. We reluctantly gave in and stayed at Dehdez. Saw a very large number of red-legged partridges in the wooded slopes above Dehdez, but so wild that shooting was a labour rather than a pleasure. I only suc ceeded in getting three. I also saw a number of ibex, but no good heads. The population of Dehdez does not enjoy a very good reputation, and some seyyeds who had come in from the neighbourhood to meet the Eelkhani, objected to our presence, and were unkind enough to say that we ought to be shot. When taxed with the speech, however, and threatened with the wrath of the Eelkani they became very bumble, and said it was merely a habit they had of joking. 14M November .—Left at 7 a.m. General direction, west-north-west. Rode along the valley in which Dehdez lies, passing a small “ keshlak ” or winter settlement. On our left, the valley was cultivated to a certain extent, but, on the right, the land was rocky and barren. The road for some distance was stony and indifferent till it ran into a narrow valley when it improved. Came upon a good spring which forms a small marsh and runs along the valley for some way till it is lost in the stones, appearing, however, again some 600 or 700 yards further down. On the right bank of the stream lay several pomegranate gardens, and on the left two ruined mills. The road winds up the hill on the left hand, and then descends to the Karoun river, the right bank of which we reached at 11.45 a.m., altitude, 2,250 feet. We had been informed that the crossing would occupy the best part of a day, in reality it took just an hour and a half. Had we come on here straight from Dehdez we should have saved a day. Men, luggage, and pack-saddles are ferried across on rafts made of reeds and sticks fastened horizontally on to inflated goat skins (rnussuk). Mules and horses sw r im over alone, but donkeys and sheep are swum over in pairs by a man with the aid of a “ mussuk.” The animals are forced into the water, and when they are just getting out of their depth, a man bestrides a “mussuk” which he float just over their backs, and grasping the near ear of the off animal and the off ear of the near one with his left hand, guides them across the river with his right by slapping them on the head. In the autumn, when the river is low, the charge for crossing on the raft is 10 shahis (5rf), two donkeys or two sheep pay the same. In spring, when the river is in flood, the charge is increased to 30 shahis. Six or eight men were employed on the ferry when we were there. The Eelkhani has made one attempt to build a bridge, but it was swept away ; he is now renewing the trial at a spot some 20 miles below Goudar Bouloutak, and we met loads of bric ks carried on donkeys and oxen going up. It is greatly to be hoped that the attempt will be successful as the crossing of the Karoun at present must always be a matter of difficulty, and in spring cannot fail to be attended with danger. Camped on the left bank of the river at Goudar Bouloutak, it being too late to attempt to get to Malemeer that day. There were no habitations where we camped, but a little way off down stream was a small village whence supplies were obtained. Distance from Dehdez, 10.^ miles. 15^ November. — Left at 7.30 a.m. and followed the course of the river for a short distance. Saw several fine oaks. The acorns in the whole of this country are of remarkable size, one I picked up measured 3^ inches in length. Turned to the left going west-north-west up a gorge ascending steadily to the height uf 4,000 feet. The road to the top of the crest cannot be called exactly very bad, but it is rough and stony, the descent to 2,750 feet is somewhat worse. Passed a ruined village, and a little farther on came upon a spring. After leaving this the road re ascends by an ancient causeway which was intensely slippery and thoroughly bad going for horses. On reaching a height of 3,700 feet, one has before one a small plateau slightly depressed in the middle; after traversing this one looks down uponthe plain of Malemeer. Oaks, which had been getting fewer and fewer as we came along, here disappeared almost entirely. 1 he descent on to the Malemeer plain is very bad indeed, the road consisting of nothing but large stones and slippery rocks, making it very trying for animals. The plain of Malemeer is narrow when one first enters it from the mountains and widens out soon afterwards. At one end it is overgrown with camel thorn, but the centre is all cultivated with wheat and barley. Rice is grown at the western end on ground belonging to the eelkhau and which is artificially watered, the rest of the plain is dependent on rainfall. ’ r Malemeer is considered as the first point of the “ Guermessir ” the “ Tierras Calientes of Persia, and here the Eelkhan usually encamps for the winter, only going down to Shuster if obliged to do so on business. The plain was covered with Eelyat encampments. On a small eminence is situated a group of reed huts which form the village of Malemeer. On either side there is an imamzade. Near Malemeer there are several ancient sculptures with cuneiform inscriptions. One batch, which consists of three groups of figures, I unfortunately missed, but Captain Wells visited them. The other we both saw. They are situated in a lofty cavern. On the right, just outside the mouth, some way up the rock, are two groups of figures. One group consists of two figures, one apparently a female, the &amp; other group contains three of adults and one of a child approaching an altar. The head dresses are turban-shaped. As the mouth of the cavern there is a long cuneiform inscription, and, further in two large figures much defaced, one having a cuneiform inscription on the lower part. In the cavern there is a spring of excellent water, and near this again a low narrow passage said to extend a great distance. \$th November.—After visiting the cave above mentioned Captain Wells went to take observations, and I went on in front alone, missing the way I got too much to the right and found myself not on the road to Kale Toul but on the direct road to Shuster Eventually, however, I got right, and found myself on the plain of Kale Toul; the latter place is separated from Malemeer by a spur ; the direct road goes over it, I went round it. Passed a stream of beautifully clear but quite warm water which flows out of the hill. Kale Toul is situated in a fine plain covered wdth brushwood, the “ kale ” or fort itself being built on an eminence.^ It is capable of holding about 300 men; the walls are solidly built and provided with towers. The entrance is well protected, bein^ situated in a recess. Part ot the building has been recently restored, and when we were there stables were being built inside. This fort is the residence of Mirza Agha Khan, the chief of the Chahar Lenk section of the Bakhtyaris, and son-in-law of the Eelkhani. At one time this tribe was independent, but it is now comprised in the Eelkhani s jurisdiction, Mirza Agha Khan holding authority under him. Mirza Agha Khan received us civilly ; he is a fine young man with, however, a cruel expression of countenance, and if report speaks true his looks do not altogether belie his character. Bricks are made at Kale Toul, and near the fort is a kiln capable of holding 8,500. The distance by the direct road from Malemeer is 15£ miles. There is no water on the way. A slight difference exists between the dialects spoken by the Heft Lenk and that spoken by the Chahar Lenk, one distinction being that the latter pronounce the letter “ shin ” as a “ sin.” \1 th November.—The men given us by the Eelkhani, and who had proved very useful, here left us, as guides were henceforth to be provided by Mirza Agha Khan. He gave us one sowar and a letter to the ketkhudas of the villages, ordering them to pro vide us with guides. Our sowar proved very inefficient, and as to guides it was almost impossible to get them. One soon sees the difference between the direct rule of the Eelkhani and that of his subordinate. Lp to Kale Toul we had never had the very 7 smallest difficulty, but on this side of the country the people, though not actually ’ uncivil were far from obliging, and were unwilling to furnish supplies, even on the production of Mirza Agha Khan’s order. Mr. Mackenzie took a different road from what we did from Kale Toul to Shuster; we went by Goorgir, a road he mentions, adding, quite correctly, that it is rough and stony, whereas he went by the Kuh Seng-i-Shoutour. Leaving Kale 1 oul at 8 a.m., in a southerly direction, we crossed the plain by a 6978. n10 somewhat stony road, and passing a low crest, commanding a view of a plain grown over with camel thorn and pistachio, v ith an occasional wild fig tree, reached the village of Bagh-i-Malek at 10.45 a.m. On the left of the village are the ruins of Manjanik. Crossed a small stream, and soon after forded the Roud-i-Zend, a river which runs to Ram Hormuz, and which, under the name of the Alai, we met again some weeks later. Leaving the Zend the road runs over a rough waterless country till it strikes the river again, and again crosses it (altitude 1,800 feet). From this ford the road gets excessively bad; it passes through a series of low sand hills, and is rough and stony, with large slippery slabs of rock. This continues the whole way to Serasia, where the river is crossed for the third time, and where at 3.15 p.m. we camped. Myrtle and tamarisk were growing in considerable quantities near the river. Distance from Kale Toul 13 miles. From Kale Toul to Behbehan is said to be three long or five easy stages. 18M November. — Left at 8 a.m. General direction throughout the day north-west Passed over an undulating country, mostly dry and waterless. Made our mid-day halt at a stream which runs along a marshy valley, and forms a series of deep clear pools, full of fish, looking something like dace, many of which were a good 15 inches long. Observed for the first time on the journey the black and white kingfisher, and the spur-winged plover; we saw numbers of these birds in Arabistan, but I have never seen them further north. I confess to not knowing the scientific name for the first bird, but I am told it is very common in India. The road then runs on with much the same characteristics to another marshy stream, near which there is a spring of almost warm water. From this stream to Goorgir the road is infamous, being simply nothing but a mass of sharp stones, most trying for horses’ feet. The distance is not great, but it took us three hours, and we only marched the lower part of Goorgir at 6 p.m., altitude 1,200 feet. There are two imamzades here. The village is situated in a very barren valley, and has the Kuh-i-Asmani to the east. It is inhabited by those curses of the country, seyyeds, and we had some difficulty in getting supplies. To the west of Goorgir is another road to Shuster, known as the Khar-Shoutourzar, which is marked on Colonel St. John’s map. We passed no village during the day’s march (20 miles), the only habitation seen being some Kashgae tents. Fuel is scarce on the road. 19^. November .—Left a little after 8 a.m., and rode to the upper part of the village of Goorgir, and tried in vain to get fodder for the day, but the people declined to let us have any at any price. Rode along the valley in a north-west direction, leaving the Kuh-i-Alomani, crossed two intensely bitter streams, and then got to a stream of fresffi but very warm water. A little further on we reached the village of Tembih, where there is a spring. Here* the people were more civil, and gave us supplies and a guide. After leaving Tembih there is no fresh water for some miles, and, moreover, all supplies for the night have to be taken, as at Sheker Ab, the only possible halting place, there are none. Left Tembih about noon, going south-east for about five miles, and then turning north-west again. 1 raversed a most desolate country over low ranges of hills, the highest noint being 1,150 feet, and small plains. Pools of bitter water were of frequent occurrence and the ground was strongly impregnated with gypsum. A descent by a slippery tortuous path brought us to a plain of some extent, which we reached about dark, and at 6.30 p.m. got to Sheker Ab, where there is drinkable water but not a human habitation. The weather being very mild we slept in the open. Fuel scarce. Distance from Goorgir 14 miles, the whole day’s journey being thoroughly uninteresting. 20th November .—Left at 7.15 a.m., the road being much better than yesterday. A slight descent brings one into a valley grown over with “ konar ” trees, and which gradually widens out, the hills on either side getting lower. Two hours from Sheker Ab we came to a small stream which the horses would just drink. The valley then gets narrower again and runs up into some low hills on the left, winding through them down to Shuster. At noon reached another stream of drinkable water. Here there are two roads to Shuster, we took the right-hand one which we were told was the best.&lt; 4 * 11 Our guide here made off and was seen no more of. The road, however, is easy to find, and is moreover fairly good. Passed some old walls built of massive blocks of stone and also two ruined imam- zades. Before we could get into Shuster it came on pitch dark, and it was not without difficulty that we found our way into the town, the “ sowar ” never having been there before in his life. We had, however, taken the precaution to send some one on with a letter of introduction we had to the Governor, and on the bridge we were met by a man who conducted us to a very good house situated away from the town on an eminence overlooking the river. The atmosphere all day had been hot and disagreeable, and one felt the change to the stuffy plains after the fine air of the Bakhtyari mountains. A little rain fell. Distance from Sheker Ab 30 miles, general direction N.W. by W. Fuel plentiful. Saw a white sparrow and also numbers of the small brown longtailed bird known in Hindoostani as the “ seven sisters.” The whole way from Ispahan to Shuster supplies such as mutton, fowls, rice, milk, bread, barley, and straw are obtainable. We only had to carry provisions for one night, and at two places, viz., Rudbar and Goudar Bouloutak, supplies had to be col lected in the neighbourhood. As long as one is accompanied by the Eelkhani’s own men one easily obtains all one requires, but I suspect that if a traveller tried to pass through the country without giving Hussein Kuli Khan notice, he might find it difficult to get supplies, though I fancy he would not be exposed to personal danger. Fuel is some what scarce from Ispahan to Ardell, from thence to Kale Toul it is plentiful, most of the country being well wooded ; on to Shuster it is scarce again. Water is good up to Serasia, but scarce and bad after that. 21st. 22nd, 23rd November .—Had intended staying one day at Shuster, but the torrents of rain that fell detained us no less than three. The house in which we lodged was built by the Ihtisham-es-Sultaneh, the present Governor of Arabist an, when he was here as governor several years ago. The lower part was in good repair, but the upper stories were sadly dilapidated. The building stands on a cliff overlooking the river, and a winding staircase leads down to the water. Shuster was at one time the capital of Arabistan, but the seat of government has been removed to Dizful. The province was formerly a separate government, but two years ago it was added to that of Ispahan and placed under the Zil-es-Sultan, the Ihtisham-es-Sultaneh being only now Lieutenant Governor. The last independent governor was the Hachmet-ed-dowlah, the uncle of the Shah, who died about a year ago in Kurdistan; when he left Jaaffer Kuli Khan, a “ Peeshkhed- met ” of the Zil-es-Sultan, governed the province for a short time till the Ihtisham-es- Sultaneh arrived. The Governor of Shuster is now Abdul Wahab Khan, a native of the town, but attached to him is one of the Ihtisham-es-Sultaneb’s immediate attendants who looks after the collection of the revenue. Arabistan includes the districts of Dizful, Shuster, Arwaz, Howeis, Ram Hormuz, and Mohammerah, the total revenue amounting to tomans 200,000 or rather more than 74,000/. Ruin and decay are the two principal features which will probably strike a traveller in nine Persian towns out of ten. .At Ispahan he will pass through whole bazaars ruined and abandoned, at Kom the same, at Kuehan the same though perhaps to a less degree. Should he enter Persia by the north and pass through Kasveen he will be inclined to ask if the place has been recently sacked. But nowhere do these melan choly characteristics strike one more forcibly than at Shuster; it is like a city of the dead, and the general listlessness and want of energy of the inhabitants added to the ruins one sees on every side have a positively depressing effect. The filth of the town passes all description; not only the olfactory nerves but also the eye are offended at every step in a manner which I refrain from dwelling on. Cleanliness and proper sanitary arrangements one does not expect in Eastern towns, but the abominations of Shuster surpass anything I have ever seen elsewhere. A poet has informed us that at Cologne he counted “ four and seventy stenches,” had he taken a short walk in Shuster he would have soon lost count. In summer the heat is said to be excessive, and in the middle of the day the popu lation take refuge in the “ serdaubs,” or underground chambers; during our stay the atmosphere was close, heavy, and depressing. I he town must naturally at one time have contained a large population ; it is nownumbered as low as 6,000. Many of the inhabitants are said to have perished during the great famine of 1871, and many more appear to have then emigrated. &amp; Opium has been cultivated of late years in the neighbourhood of Shuster, the result being satisfactory as regards quality. It is said, however, that the extreme laziness of the people has prevented the cultivation from being extended. Not more than 20 cases are exported yearly. No special tax is levied. The bazaars of Shuster are poorly supplied. I heard it positively asserted that all foreign imports came from Bombay. The sugar I saw was all French, and the candles though they had English marks upon them, looked to me like Russian produce Iron and cotton goods came by way of the Persian Gulf. The chief interest of Shuster lies in its antiquities, as here are the great works of the captive Emperor Valerian, the magnitude and utility of which might well have earned him more generous treatment at the hands of Shapor. These antiquities have been described already by eminent archaeologists, and it would be useless and indeed presumptuous on my part to attempt to throw any new light upon them. 1 * A few years ago Shuster was placed in telegraphic communication with the rest of Persia by a line running through Dizful to Khoramabad and Burujird. It now only nW kS . U V^j DlZfU V aS . the ^ Ur , S haVe ' lestro - v, ' (l ““any wiles of it between the latter p ce and Khoramabad. The line to Dizful is m a very bad state, and is constantly out of working order. There is hardly a perpendicular post the whole way, and not more than half a dozen insulators. When, however, there is an insulator the wire is not run through it, but is simply passed over the hook. Prices were low throughout the province in consequence of an excellent harvest Bread was 4 shahis the maun ; mutton, 30 shahis; a sheep from krans 3 to krans 6 wheat, 5 mauns, and barley 7 maims for one kran. In the villages straw could be had emiaU e o- 47 k ^fo a f 3 S ° ^ .Tu 6 i™ 31 ' 1 ° f Shuster e Tials about 7 lbs. The shahi equals 0 4/^1^ of a penny, and the kran, 9*51624 pence. ■241A November. Left Shuster a little before 11 a.m. for Dizful. There are two roads, one by kaownek, the other by Ab-beed—we took the latter, said to be the best after heavy ram. Crossed the great bridge, which has 37 arches, and is .569 yards long, and is sadly m want of repair in many places. Went in a northerly direction and ascending a ridge came upon a good road, which crosses the perfectly level nlain* Considering the heavy ram that had fallen the road was not bad going only the gullies being awkward to cross. At first there was but little cultivation, but about a third of the way out we came upon land on both sides of the road, which was being ploughed for wheat and barley. Passing the village of Jennet Makam we got to Ab-beed m 6, hours after leaving Shuster, the distance being five farsakhs Here there !s a large castellated building, unfinished, which belongs to the Eelkhani of the Bakhtyans. He lately bought the land for tomans 800, and is growing rice and laying out a large garden, having brought water to the spot for the purpose. On the road obseived the kalebleb shrub tor the first time, which is mentioned by Loftus Saw great numbers of cranes, also several foxes and jackals, which abound all over the country. One jackal howled at 3 p.m. with a bright sun shining, a thin- neither Captain Wells nor I had ever heard before. 6 ° neicnei • Le ? at 7; 30 a ’ m ‘ Road S ood and level the whole way to Dizful the distance being six farsakhs On leaving Ab-beed one has on one’s right a ridge of perpendicular rocks, and beyond to the north-east the mountains above Bazuft which were covered with snow, and which look about 7,000 or 8,000 feet high. There is a be badaTan't[mes° y ‘ SerdeSht; “ * Cl ° Sed in winter &gt; “d said to • .' ‘j re J lt ' ,l&lt; j' 1 [)iztu l ^ 3 P-m , and were lodged in the telegraph office. The suner intendent, who is a native of Shiraz, informed us he had had no communication with his superiors at Tehran for 14 months. LdUon Wltn There is no regular post either at Shuster or Dizful, the only means of communica- mossen g ers &gt;. wh &lt;&gt; go to Ispahan by Khoramabad and Buruiird in about 10 ten days, the charge being from tomans 3 to tomans 4 J tetris’' bad as Slmste!- ^ ^ nearer ^ m3, ' k - The t0Wn is ^ filth V, but not neariy Z No opium is grown in the neighbourhood, the principal product being indigo which is very largely cultivated. There are 120 indigo factories in Dizful, which turn out “n a^16 It will be seen that four of these stages are short, and the distance can be reduced to 7 stages. From Khoramabad to Burujird there are 2 stages, thence to Korn 5, thence to Tehran 4; total 18, a gain of 8 stages over the Bakhtyari road. Baron Bode, and much more recently, Mr. Schindler, travelled through Luristan; the latter gentleman is, however, unfortunately now absent from Tehran, and I therefore have not been able to consult him on the subject, or obtain the articles he contributed to the German scientific journals. I have not either Baron Bodes work to refer to. One objection to this road is its insecurity. The country about Choramabad is in habited by wild tribes of Lurs, who are broken up into* small clans, and who are thus not controlled by any particular chief. The Persian Government might, however, easily establish order, as has been done in the south among the Kohgelu and Mamasseni. Could the Persian Government be prevailed upon to construct a waggon road, it appears to me that this is the route they should select. It would be certainly cheaper than the Bakhtyari route, and it must be remembered that cost is a great consideration in this country, when money for works of public utility is not to be had for the asking. The route I have pointed out would not be so advantageous for Ispahan, the Bakhtyari road would be shorter, but still from Burujird to Ispahan is not more than nine stages by Gulpaigan, so that caravans could get there from Shuster in 18 days, which would still be a gain over the present route rid Bushire and Shiraz. I have recently heard of the existence of a road from Shuster to Gulpaigan, but have obtained no particulars about it. The opening up of communication through Arabistan and Luristan would give a great stimulus to British trade it) Persia, and should enable us to place our produce not only in the markets of those provinces, but only in those of Hamadan and Kurdistan. The country could not also fail to develope a valuable export trade. Of the possibility of other trade routes from the Persian Gulf to Ispahan, I will speak hereafter, when describing our journey to Behbehan. SOth November.- —Left Shuster at 8.15 a.m., and passing the large imamzade, with its curious candlestick-shaped minarets, crossed the Pul-i-Lashker. Two roads lead to Shuster and Ahwaz, one crosses the Pul-i-Boleiti, and is called the Bunei-Daondi road, the other is called the Bunei-Caid Hassan Khan, which is the one we took. After crossing the bridge passed a large palm grove, and then went out on to the cultivated plain. The fields were dotted over with towers, used by the inhabitants for defence against raids in troublous times. Outside Shuster the population becomes entirely Arab. After the rains the road w as very muddy and heavy-going for the mules. Passed a considerable Arab village built of reeds, the road fortunately afterwards getting far less sticky. Reached Bend-i-kir at 6 p.m., and lodged in the village. On the load the Mongesht range in the Bakhtyari country is seen, and one gets a view of the highest point of the Kuh-i-Gereh, near Ardell. Saw great numbers of pin-tailed grouse, and killed a stilt, different from the black and white species usually seen in Persia. 1 he back and halt the breast of this bird was dove-coloured, the wings black and white, and furnished with a small spur, the legs yellow. Bend-i-kir is an Arab village, situated at the junction of the Ab-i-Gerger and the Karoun proper, the Diz also falling into the latter river at this place. The Ab-i-Gerger I need hardly say, is the artificial canal which comes down from Shuster from the Bund-i-Kaisar. The word “kir' ; in Arabic signifies bitumen, the stones of the ancient “ bund, which was used for purposes of irrigation having been joined together with that substance. ° The Geiger is said to be perfectly navigable to within a short distance of Shuster by vessels of light draught, but the natives declare that the main Karoun stream is not navigable. 1st December.—'Lett at 7 a.m. and proceeded to the ferry, which is close to the village and crosses the Gerger within a short distance of its junction with the Karoun There is only one boat and the operation of crossing is long and tedious. Horses and mules swim over. It was 10 a.m. before we were able to move from the opposite bank. Ihe road to Ahwaz is perfectly level, and runs past the village of Wais, where there is a much revered imamzade of Oweis, the disciple of Mahommed Abou Wais. The Karoun is more than 800 yards broad, and is really a noble stream. Reached Ahwaz&lt;Lt 6 p.m., and had some slight difficulty in finding a lodging, as the Arabs were anxious to put us into a filthy caravanserai ; the matter was, however, amicably arranged. 2nd December.—-Yiisseii the day at Ahwaz. The morning was frosty and extremely cold, the climate being said to be cooler than Shuster all the year round The whole way from here to Shiraz we found the climate trying, the mornings were intensely cold, while the heat m the middle of the day was excessive, the great difference o** temperature being disagreeable and hard to hear. We spent the greater portion of the day in'visiting the bund, of which Captain Wells made a careful plan, which will be accompanied by a full report. At the upper end of the village is situated a large square “kale/’ opposite which in midstream, there is a wooded island, immediately below this a line of rocks stretches right across the river. About 600 yards further down is the “ bund ,, itself which is partly natural and partly artificial, but little of the original masonry now remains but what there is of it shows what a solid structure it must have been. The mortar used was of excellent quality. Near the left bank are the remains of a number of mills one of which is still worked. Two of the channels anciently used for irrigation are also visible. ® The river now finds its way through three channels, one near the right bank one in the centre, and a third, a narrow millstream, near the left bank. No water was actually passing through the centre channel when we were there, but the state of the rocks showed that not more than 24 hours previously water had flowed over them 1 he channel on the right bank is the principal one. The “ bund ” is about 900 yards across. • Below the “ bund ” is a small island, the channels on either side being obstruted by a line of rocks, with only one small aperture situated in the left hand channel There are thus three serious obstacles to navigation. The last-named one might I fancy, be removed, but the only way to overcome the difficulties at the “bund’’ and at the upper rapid, would be to construct an artificial channel through them provided with locks. The walls of this canal would have to be made high and strong to resist floods The distance would it is true not be great, but the cost woufd be very considerable, and the Persians could not and would not provide the money All materials would have to be brought from a distance. I fear transhipment with all its inconveniences would be the only plan but this might be # greatly facilitated by the construction of a steam or even a horse tramway which would start from a point just below the third rapid, and passing round the village would strike in somewhere near the “kale ” I have mentioned above. At Ahwaz the river falls about seven feet, and I presume therefore that there would be no question of removing the obstacles by blasting. One small native vessel of about seven tons was lying at anchor below the third rapid. On the right bank of the river was a large encampment of Arabs belonging to the Bauwee tribe; the inhabitants of the left bank belong to the Zengan tribe. Communication is carried on between Ahwaz and the opposite bank by means of one small boat. J The principal products of the neighbourhood are wheat and barley; there is not enough water for cotton. Artificial irrigation there is none, and agriculture is entirely dependent on the rainfall. With a good system of irrigation this great plain could I dare say, be rendered very fertile. It is a question for engineers to decide as to how tar any irrigation scheme would interfere with navigation. Wool is another article which I expect might be largely exported from this country. r A .^ d P e&lt; ; emher -r- rm l bein S the Rouz-i-katl, or 10th day of Moharrem, we had some cnmculty m getting the muleteers to leave, but at last we got them off at 6.30 a.m. the morning being bitterly cold and everything enveloped in a dense fog. Our direction was nearly due south over what is practically a trackless desert No road b^ing visible anywhere. About two hours out we sighted a small Arab encamp ment, and came upon a little cultivated ground. The plain is waterless for many miles, but is covered with grass, which was of course dried up when we passed over it. 1 he soil is alluvial, and after rain the country is said to be well nigh impassable. baw a great number of antelopes and two bustards (o/w, houbara). After travellinir a considerable distance we reached a large salt marsh, which we crossed or rather 6978. Efloundered through, and at 4.45 p.m. got to an encampment of Bouwy Arabs at a place called Shakhe. Here we pitched our tents. The Arabs spoke hardly any Persian. The Sheikh had just arrived, and the tribe was celebrating the event by executing a weird and strange dance, flourishing swords and firing guns, all the while keeping up a monotonous chant. The dance consisted of no regular step, all the dancers moved independently one of another, and each man kicked his legs about as he thought fit. One thing was observable during this scene, and that was the good quality of the arms the men had. Hardly a man had a flint gun, nearly all being provided with double-barrelled percussion fowling pieces. The swords also seemed ot good quality. The distance from Ahwaz is called 8 farrakhs, we reckoned it at 26 miles. The water at Shakhe is so salt as to be hardly drinkable, and fuel is scarce. The encamp ment is said to contain 700 families. The tribe is rich, possessing very large flocks of sheep, cows, and buffaloes. All these Arabs are more or less tufbulent, and our road to-day was said to be very unsafe. We never saw a human being till we got near the salt marsh, where two men crossed the road. kth December. —Left at 6.45 a.m., the air being intensely cold, and travelling east, in an hour and a half reached the Gopal river, which comes down from Dehbeed, a place five farrakhs from Ram Hormuz on the direct road to Shuster, and loses itself in the salt marsh above mentioned. The water is very bitter. The Arabs of Shekhe camp on the banks of this river during the summer and till the fields. Crossed the Gopal, the road soon after entering a series of sandhills, after leaving which it crosses the plain which extends to the mountains above Ram Hormuz. Passed the village of Mir Batche and then a ruin called Ramleh, which was formerly the residence of Sheikh Ibaret Khan, the father of Sheikh of Ja’bere Khan, the present Sheikh of Ram Hormuz. Crossing another bitter stream we reached the camp of Sheikh Ja’bere, which was pitched some distance from the village of Ram Hormuz, at 3.30 p.m. The Arabs are of the El Khamir tribe. Shtdkh Ja’bere himself came out to meet us mounted on a well-made Arab mare. He is a fine man, between 35 and 40, of a dignified appearance. He took us to his tent while our own was being pitched, and when the whole tribe assembled to gaze at us. From here to Kale Toul is two days’journey ; to Shuster, by the direct road, it is three days, viz., Ram Hormuz to Dehbeed 5 farsakhs, Dehbeed to Bunei Daoud 6 farsakhs, Bunei Daoud to Shuster 8 farsakhs. On this road are some naphtha wells which are worked, the persons who farm them paying tomans 600 a year to the Government. This revenue once belonged to Sheikh Ja’bere, but the Governor of Dizful has now taken possession of it. The produce of the wells is taken to Shuster, Dizful, and Mohammerah, and some even, I am assured, finds its way to Ispahan. What I saw at Ram Hormuz appeared to me of pretty good quality. The water at the camp was bad. The distance from Shakhe is called 6 farsakhs; we made it 23^ miles. Sheikh Ja’bere’s authority extends about half way to Shuster on the one side, and almost to Behbehan on the T other. bth December .—Rain fell during the night, and the morning was showery. We started, however, with the horsemen given us by the Sheikh, the rain increasing as we went on ; passed the little village of Keimek, and got to the banks of the Alai or Ram Hormuz river, which is the stream we crossed after leaving Kale Toul, and which falls into the ,Jerahi or Behbehan river. Here we waited for the mules, who were making very slow progress through the deep mud, the rain coming down all the time in torrents, and the river rising visibly. We had much difficulty in getting the mules across, two of them narrowly escaping being drowned. Passing a small Kohgelu village called Telleep we floundered on through deep rice fields and .flooded ditches to a village called Rustem-abad. Our intention had been to get to Sultan-abad, but the mules were getting on so slowly that we thought it wiser to halt, which we did at 3.30 p.m. We had now left the Arab country, and were among the Kohgelu Lurs. The people of Rustem-abad emigrated from Pars, and are what is called “ badi,” or villagers whose movements are free, in contradistinction to “ hakki ” who are not allowed to emigrate. They pay taxes to Sheikh Ja’bere, but also something to the Government of Pars. The village contains 100 families. It lies upon the banks of the Shour river,4 ? 19 f which runs into the Alai. We inquired about its sources, but could only learn that it came from the “Kuh.” fSth December .—The morning luckily was fine but cold, and we left at 7.30 a.m., crossing the Shour, which was quite shallow, and very unlike the rushing torrent we saw yesterday. Road perfectly level. Passed iSultan-abad, which is about eight miles from Rustem-abad, and going on reached an imamzade very prettily situated in a palm grove. Here there are two roads, the right-hand one, the shortest, crosses the Jerahi, but the left-hand one, which is longer, avoids tl&gt;tf fords. We took the latter, as the river was too deep to ford, and found it fairly dry, only the gullies being awkward for mules on account of the slippery mud. The banks of the Jerahi are well wooded and picturesque. Our road lay over a plain covered with camel thorn and “ konar ” trees, with good pasture but little cultivation. Crossed two streams which run into the Jerahi, the first and smallest near the imarnzade. The regular stage is at Jaizoun, but had to stop at 6 p.m. at a small encampment of Arab nomads, about hours short of that place. 1th December .—The morning was the coldest we had yet felt, everything being hard frozen. Left at 7.30 a.m. Rode over cultivated ground and passed an imamzade, situated in a palm grove, with a dense undergrowth of wild vines, wild fig trees, &amp;c., and got to Jaizoun. Here we had a difficulty with the villagers, who wanted to seize our mules, but they were easily driven off. When we were about a quarter of a mile off a gun was fired at us, but we were well out of shot. Our Arab sowars had gone into the village and did not appear for some time afterwards. They were both utterly useless at all times. After leaving Jaizoun the plain gets drier and more stony. It is dotted over with “ konar ” trees. Here we came upon red-legged partridges again, birds we had not seen since leaving the Bakhtyari hills. The road then gradually ascends through sandhills to a crest 950 feet high, overlooking the extensive plain of Behbehan, which is flanked on the northern side by a low range of hills. The plain at the upper end is covered with “konar” trees, and must afford fine pasture in spring. It was too late to get to Behbehan that night, so we halted at a small “ kale ” called Kureise. The distance we had come was 26 miles. The Kohgelus in this neighbourhood belong to the Agha Teri section. $&gt;th December .—Owing to a dense fog we did not get off till 8 a.m. Our Arab sowars here left us. Crossed a small stream which falls into the Jerahi, and soon after got to the river itself. From bank to bank at the ford is about 70 yards, the actual stream being about 45. The left bank is covered with thick underwood. The current was fairly rapid, the water coming just up to our stirrups. Passed the little village of Chahar Asia, and soon afterwards met a number of horse men sent out to meet us by the Nasseer-eLMulk, Governor of Behbehan. Reached the % town about 2.30 p.m., and were lodged in a small kulah-i-feringhee or kiosk situated in the middle of a pretty and very fairly kept garden which belonged to the Ihtisham- ed-dowleh, the late Governor. 9/A December .— Called upon the Governor. He is the brother of the Sahib Divan, who now governs Shiraz in the name of the young Prince, the son of the Zil-es- Sultan, and of the Cawam-el-Mulk. jj Behbehan had been governed for a long time by the Ihtisham-ed-dowleh, son of Ferhad Mirza, who till last spring was Persian Governor of Fars. The Ihtisham-ed-dowleh was an energetic man, and kept order among the turbulent tribes in the neighbourhood, but he is also said to have been very rapacious and exacting, and the Nasseer-el-Mulk’s government is, on the whole, more popular. ^ The Ihtisham-ed-dowleh made some attempts at opium growing near Behbehan, but they do not seem to have been attended with any great success. The principal tribe around Behbehan is the Kohgelu, who are divided into two great sections, viz., the Pusht-i-kuh and the Zir-i-kuh. follows:— Bawy - Bai Rahmet (Serheddi and Guermessiri) The former are subdivided as Chief. Nejef Kuli Khan. ( Veli Khan. Hussein Khan.Dehdeaht - - Charum - Nowy - Ducbmen Ziari Teibi (Serheddi and Guermessiri) Bahmei (Serheddi and Guermessiri)] No chief at present. Mehmet Ali Khan. Abbass Khan. Rustem Khan. Mir Ali Khan. Hussein Ali Khan. Mehmet Hussein Khan. Jaaffer Khan. Y ussufi Agha Teri Humei Zeidoun Tenge Tekao Zeeravi Bender Dilam Zir-i-Kuh. - Jaaffer Khan. - Hadji Bemouni. Governed directly from Behbehan. - Ka Mehmet Baker. - None at present. - Hadji Shah Kuli. - Abdullah Khan. These tribes are described as constantly fighting among themselves, usually about pasture. They have also bitter blood feuds, and their not being amenable to the authority of any one single chief makes them difficult to manage. On the Shiraz side the Kohgelu march with the Mamasseni, to the north and north-east with the Kashgaes and Bakhtyaris, and to the west and north-west with the Arabs. Part of them are under the government of Arabistan, but the greater portion of them are under that of Pars. What the whole tribe really numbers I could not ascertain with any exactitude. The tribes of Southern Persia may be divided into three great sections : The Lurs, including the Bakhtyari, the Kohgelu, and the Mamasseni, speaking the Lur dialect with different local modifications ; the Turkish speaking tribes, including the Kashgaes and the Bahai loo j and the Arab nomads. The latter I have never come across, they mostly have their winter quarters towards Lar and Bunder Abbass, and go for the summer to the Baounat. They are said to number 12,000 families and speak a bastard Arabic. The Baharloo number about 1,000 families. I have’only come across one settlement of them in the neighbourhood of Persepolis. The Kashgaes are said to number about 50,000 families. r From Behbehan roads run to Dilam and thence to Bushire ; to Shiraz and to Komesheh. The road to Shiraz we travelled over and will form the subject of sub sequent description, but that to Komesheh has never been travelled over by a European It is said to be fairly good. The following are the stages F Behbehan to Dehidesht. Dehidesht to Seferiab.* Seferiab to Saadat. Saadet to Chenar. Chenar to Sisakht. Sisakht to Khoy. Khoy to Felat. Felat to Nakneh. Nakneh to Takown. Takown to Komesheh. From Komesheh to Ispahan is 14 farsakhs or three stages, the last from Mere to Ispahan being only a 3-farsakh stage. 6 In summer by going from Behbehan to Sisakht vid Tesouj one stage is saved 1 he two stages between Sisakht and Felat are described as being the worst but natives say they offer no real difficulty ; from Felat to Komesheh the road is said to be perfectly level. It is a question whether this road could not be utilized by caravans coming up from Bushire by way of Dilam, so as to shorten the present long march to Ispahan via Shiraz, and it would be interesting it some European traveller would explore ana traveUed over^ 6 r ° ad ' ^ P ° rti011 fr0m Behbehan tu Bushire has been several times country 011 ” 6 006 ° f ^ main ob i ections is the doubtful security of this part of the * Pronounced Seferiow by the people.21 If the Karoun were opened it might perhaps be possible to take advantage of water carriage for goods intended for Ispahin as far as Ahwaz, there land them, and take them across the plain to Ram Hormuz. To go from the latter place to Behbeban would be out of the way, and the Jerahi in flood must often offer a serious obstacle, but it would be worth seeing if a practicable road could not be found between Ram Hormuz and Felat. The road from Ahwaz to Ram Hormuz is perfectly level, but I am fully aware that there are objections to it, one being the scarcity and bad quality of the water, and another the fact that the presence of Arab tribes renders the country insecure. KVA December .—Rain fell during the night, but the clouds dispersed in the morning. The Nasseer-el-Mulk came to call upon us, and insisted upon our taking six sowars. We thought the number excessive, but bowed to his wish. It turned out afterwards that he was taking the opportunity of our journey to send Government money to Shiraz, and in reality we rather acted as an escort to the treasure. However, it is fair to say that all the Nasseer-el-Mulk’s men proved useful and obliging, and had more over a wholesome dread of his authority. Leaving the town at 9.15 a.m. we rode in an easterly direction through a singularly uninteresting country to the Khairabad or Shirin river, which we crossed and camped about three quarters of a mile from its banks. The road was stony and the country uninhabited; we had to take all our supplies, as none were to be obtained near the camp. Distance four farsakhs. On the banks of the river there is a thick cover of willow, tamarisk, &amp;c., in which francolin are plentiful, two woodcocks were also seen. Wth December .—Left at 5.30 a.m. A ride of an hour and a half and a gentle rise brought us on to the extensive plain called Sahrai Leshter, which is about 12 miles long by 4 broad, and is covered with “ konar ” trees. The plain was dry and parched when we saw it, but no doubt it affords good pasture in spring. Passed a small Kashgae encampment, but saw no other habitation till we reached our halting place. At the further end of the plain a small stream called the Shems-uLArab is crossed, the first water since Khairabad. After crossing this stream the road winds through hills and becomes rougher and more stony, one hill being a little steep. One ascends steadily the whole way to Do-Gumbezan (2,150 feet), which we reached at 5.30 p.m., and where we camped by the side of a small stream. The distance from Khairabad is called 8 farsakhs, we reckoned it at 26 miles. The village of Do-Gumbezan possesses a much ruined fort with two tow'ers. A high mountain called Kuh-i-dil is seen to the north. During the whole march fuel was plentiful, but water scarce. Lions are said to be numerous in the neighbouring hills, which seems strange, as there is no thick cover for them. 12/A December .—Left at 6 a.m., going east. The road soon enters a plain smaller than the Sahrai Leshter, but with more trees and with some cultivation. Passed the ruins of two villages and saw many old dried up kanaats, signs of former cultivation and of greater prosperity than the country now possesses. In fact all over these provinces one hears but one story, viz., that the country is fine but ruined by exaction. At the end of the plain the road turns sharp to the north to a small stream situated in the Tenge Narik ; it then turns east again and mounts a crest (3,150 feet by aneroid). From this point oak trees are again seen, some of them attaining very fair dimensions. The road then descends to a valley, but immediately ascends again, and winds along the side of the hill till the broad valley in which Basht is situated opens up. Passing over a spur of the Kuh-i-dil it then descends rapidly to the village, which we reached at 4 p.m. Basht (2,400 feet) consists of a square fortress with high walls and reed huts outside. The road all day had been rather stony, but by no means bad. For two days we had observed wheel tracks, and on inquiry found that a gun had been sent up to Basht from Behbehan w ith troops on account of aBouwy Kohgelu chief called Hussein Kuli Khan having revolted. On the approach of the forces the Khan fled and suc ceeded in escaping to Bassorah. A brother of his had been accused of putting out the eyes of three men ; he took sanctuary, but the Nassur-el-Mulk got him out and had him executed. The natives call the distance eight farsakhs, it is about 25 miles. 6978. F22 In the valley of Basht there are large clamps of myrtle. Great quantities of rice and canary seed (konjid) are cultivated. The inhabitants do not seem exactly to lead a peaceful existence, and the Kethhuda never stirs outside his fortress without being accompanied by two or three armed men. Kuh-i-dil when seen from the Basht valley presents a fine appearance, and must be about 12,000 feet high. Saw a number of ibex to-day on the road, but no good heads. 13th December .—Left at 7 a.m., the general direction being east by south. Crossed the plain, in which Basht is situated, and ascended gradually to the height of 2,550 feet to a crest overlooking a small round plain through which the Chale Moure river runs. The descent into this plain is short, but the first part especially is very bad; there being practically no road, the horses having to pick their way over the rocks where they can. Crossed the Chale Moure and soon afterwards came upon another stream, which flows into it, and which comes down from a spring called the Ser-ab-i- Siah. This we also crossed and entered a well cultivated valley down which the stream flows; the entrance to the valley was formerly guarded by a tower now in ruins. The valley gradually gets narrow and then winds out again, opening on to a plain in which Talesbeed (2,600 feet), the first Mamasseni village we come to, is situated. The village consists of reed huts with a square loopholed tower on a mound in the centre. Not a village in the Mamasseni country but has one or more of these towers. A stream flows past Talesbeed, which is surrounded on two sides by rice fields. The Mamasseni, who extend from here to Shiraz are, like the Kohgelu, broken up into small sections. Their subdivisions are as follows:— Rustem Bekesh - Howy Fahliown Duchmen Ziari Mem Salih - Chief, Ala Kuli Khan. - „ Sherif Khan. „ Mehmed All Khan. „ Mirza Hadee. „ Murad Kuli Khan. „ Ali Khan. The Mamasseni have always been notorious for their turbulence, and not very long ago it was next to impossible to travel through their country. Ferhed Mirza, however, when Prince Governor of Fars, brought these unruly people to reason, and the country is now fairly safe. The Mamasseni appear to be rather a fine race, the features of many of them being wonderfully like the ancient Persian type as one sees it portrayed at Persepolis. The Ketkhuda of Talesbeed looked as if he had walked out of one of these old sculptures. From Talesbeed are two roads to Shiraz, one by Pul-i-Murde, which we took, the other by Kazerown ; the following are the stages on the latter:— Talesbeed to Nourabad - - - .3 farsakhs. Nourabad to Nodown Nodown to Kazerown or Nodown to Mian Kotel Kazerown is three stages and Mian Kotal four stages from Shiraz by the regular Bush ire road. From Basht to Talesbeed is 18 miles. At the latter place we saw the last francolin we met with on the journey. Our Shiraz sowars here left us, and we were accompanied by those sent by Ara- doullah Mirza, who was himself at Nourabad. 14M December .—Left about 7.30 a.m. Crossed the plain, keeping the rice fields on our right, and then up a winding road to a height of 3,600 feet. We then descended to the River Shoul, which here comes down the Tenge Khass, being joined by an affluent flowing down from the mountains above Pul-i-Murde A fine bluff, called Kale Sefid, commands this valley. We made many inquiries about these rivers, but the accounts of the natives were confused and contradictory. Some declare that the Shoul comes down the Tenge Khass from Tenge Roudian, where we subsequently crossed it, and where it is called the Ab-i-Roudian, and that the stream that passes Talesbeed is artificial and was cut for the benefit ot the rice fields, the main river running to Nourabad and thence to23 Kazerown, being in fact no other than the Shahpoor, which is marked on the map as running into the sea north of Bushire. Others declare that the Talesbeed stream is not artificial, but that it is simply the Shout river, diminished by about two thirds by being drained off on to the rice fields, and that it eventually falls into the stream coming from Ser Ab-i-Siah. There is, however, a possibility of the first story being true, and that the Shoul is the same as the Shahpoor. It would be interesting to investigate the matter more closely. Time did not allow of our doing so. Fording the affluent of the Shoul I have mentioned above, we continued up the left bank, and then wound again to the right bank. Went along a winding but tolerably good road, and crossing the river twice more ascended to 3,750 feet. The hill sides are well wooded. Then descended to Pul-i-Murde, where an affluent of the main stream is crossed by a bridge. Here there is a dilapidated and dirty caravanserai, unoccupied at this season of the year, outside which we camped. No supplies are to be had here. Barley was brought by a sowar from a distance, but straw and all provisions for ourselves had to be brought from Talesbeed. A road goes from here to Ardekan. which place can be reached in one day. Distance from Talesbeed, five farsakhs. 15t/i December .—Left at 8 a.m., and soon crossed the main stream again, following it up to its source. The road was a series of ups and downs, but was good enough, though at times narrow. After ascending for some time reached freshly fallen snow, and saw the quite fresh traces of a panther. Ascended a short distance further, and reached the watershed (6,800 feet). From the crest on the left a view is obtained of Kum Forouz, as it is called on the map, where it is marked with a query as 16,000 feet; it does not look so high. The road then gradually descends a broad valley till it reaches some downs, from Dushmen Ziari tribe. Continued over undulating ground for some distance, when the road suddenly turns short to the right, and running down a narrow gorge reaches the River Shoul or Ab^i-Roudian, on the opposite bank of which the village of Tenge Roudian is situated. Another stream which comes down from Ardeman here joins the Shoul. Altitude of the river, 5,250 feet. We were lodged in a good room in a large building standing in the middle of the village. The usual towers guard the place. Distance from Pul-i-Murde about 20 miles, called six farsakhs. About two hours before getting to Teng-i-Roudian I saw two moufflon. They are said to be very plentiful, but I saw no others. \6tk December .—Left at 7 a.m. Cold, with sharp frost. The sowars who had come from Talesbeed went back, and we took on others from here. Left the village east by south, and immediately ascended the side of the gorge by a very steep zigzag road to a height of 5,850 feet. The road then passes over level ground for a short distance, and then ascends again to 6,4C0 feet. After reaching the summit and descending slightly, the road turns to the right, and passes through what might be termed anywhere a bond fide oak wood. Up to this point we had only seen trees scattered about the hill sides. As a rule, if a Persian sees tre ‘s about a quarter of a mile apart from each other, he talks of the country as being overgrown with impenetrable forest. On leaving the road one enters a broad valley. At first cultivation is scanty, but it increases as one travels aloog. We passed the village ot Shoul, which is divided into two parts, one s tuated off the road under the hill and the other near the road. There are two towers in the lower part. Shoul is the property of the Muchir, the former Vizer of Shiraz. ^ After leaving Shoul the road ascends gradually till it reaches the top of a crest 7,200 eet high. Tire h Us are perfectly barren on both sides. The descent is veiygrntle, and passing the village of Kale-Kissoun we reached Gomoun, a village belonging to the Cavam-el-Mulk, at 6 p.m. Gonyoun and the neighbouring c untry supplies Shiraz with grapes, and we passed many vineyards. ISeasiya.l the fuel u&gt;ed in the town comes from the country we passed through in the mon.in^. which there is a fine view of the peaks of Tazik and Kuh Nour above Dashkiargin to the right, and of Kuh-bKelat in front. Passed a ruined village and tower of the 24 miles. \A e were lodged b\ the Ketkhuda in a good but very cold room. r lhe distance fiom Ab-i-Rouniau is called seven farsakhs. We reckoned it atf—MlWHlIfMMaWIB.ULWWCV.m- cjn.Wylk-.u- fftfiiVJllMWh’SS 24 \lth December .—Leaving Gonyoun at 7 a.m. we reached Shiraz, 4£ farsakhs, at 11.30 a.in. I need not describe my back journey to Tehran. I annex a tabular statement of the revenues of the province of Pars. It must be borne in mind, however, that there is a very considerable difference between the Government assessment and the amount actually collected from the people. Thus in many districts in Pars 20 per cent, extra is collected by the authorities; in other districts 40 per cent, extra is taken, and I have heard it said that as much as 100 per cent, has been known to have been extorted. Of course all depends on the character of the local governors. I fear this report may appear unreasonably long, but as much of the country we travelled over has been seldom visited by Europeans, and as I cannot help thinking that sooner or later it will acquire commercial importance, I trust I maybe excused for having entered somewhat minutely into the details of the road. Mr. Mackenzie’s notes on the Bakhtyari country, though valuable, are very brief, and we visited places to which h? did not go. Sir Henry Layard visited Malemeer in 1841, but I am not aware of his having penetrated further into the Bakhtyari hills. In 1879 Mr. Blunt travelled from Dizful to Bushire by Behbehan and Dilam, but not having Lady Anne Blunt's work to refer to, I do not know whether he went direct from Shuster or whether he took the road by Ahwaz. The road from Behbehan to Shiraz has been seldom travelled over. Many years ago Monteith passed that way, and Dr. Andreas went over the road, a short time ago, but the latter gentleman has not, to my knowledge, published any account of his travels. I have done my best to describe our route accurately, but, as I have said, I possess no scientific knowledge, and this must be my excuse for the many shortcomings of the present Report. I annex a separate memorandum on opium cultivation. Walter Baring. Tehran, 24th January 1882.K2 APPENDICES. Appendix A. Pabular Statement of the Revenues of Pars. District. Tomans. District.

Memorandum. I did not fail to keep in view the question of opium cultivation during the journey I have described in my Report. Owing to the market in China being dull prices have fallen considerably, and the chest of Ispahan opium which last year was worth tomans 270 is now only worth tomans 228. Last year’s crop was a complete failure, especially throughout Pars, but opium growers are in no way discouraged, and the savings of last autumn were in excess of those of the previous year. From ail 1 could gather throughout the provinces of Ispahan and Pars the cultivation is greatly on the increase. The growers find it pay, and declare that were it not for opium they could not pay their taxes. It is the only crop, they say, that gives them a fair margin of profit after satisfying the taxgatherer. I think this is a strong argument in favour of the theory that the cultivation will go on increasing. At Neris, on the road between Shiraz and Kerman, where much opium is now grown, the Government tax is two krans the maun, but last year the Governor took tomans 1,500 over and above the regular dues. The crop was considered a poor one, but the amount exported must have been considerable to allow an official levying this sum on his own account. At Tessa, between Shiraz and Lar, south-east of the former place, the cultivation is said to be assuming considerable proportions. As I have stated in my Report, at Shuster opium of good quality is grown, but the amount is inconsiderable. At Behbehan the attempts to introduce it failed. As regards taxation of opium exported by Persian subjects, I have to state that at Shiraz eleven krans and a quarter import duty are charged on the chest. At Ispahan imported opium pays 16 shahis the shahman customs duty. The local government then take krans 23 the load of two chests for export duty, and the muleteer has moreover to pay one kran seven shahis and a half to the customs. The proper export duty is 10 krans per chest, but the tax is farmed, and the farmer has raised it on his own account. At Bushire the charges are 24 krans per chest import duty, and 12 krans export duty. Between Shiraz and Bushire 15 shahis per chest are levied for rahdari or road tax. Up to very lately opium was always purchased on the long credit system ; merchants used to purchase and they drew on Bombay bills of lading. Recent commercial failures at Ispahan and Shiraz have checked the system, and transactions are now all for ready money. Tehran, 24th January 1882.
