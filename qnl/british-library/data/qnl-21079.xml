The /rest that he was ached to do was to gi\ r c an assurance that the cliildjer would not ha detained in Qatar against their will or that of their parents. The Shaikh 1 s letter of the 20th of May 1944 is distinctly non-eGenerative in substance and impertinent in tone. 3.

Shaikh Abdallah apologised at cnre the ton* of M« lett^rrs and exprejaed his deep regret that they should have caused offence. Blaring the course of my visit I learned that hie seal has for the last two years boon in the charge of his eon Hamad and I oclievd t*iat letters arc drafted by Shaikh Hamad on instruct! ns from shaikh Abdullah who in fact does not see them before they Issue. Bearing this in milt* and the Shaikh* t&gt; obvious centritoness I suggest that no further action need bo taken on this 3. At my request the Shaikh stated that he hid no objection to my seeing the children but he maintained that all three of them were of age and etac d that the boy was with the pearling fleet* on my return to Doha from the dliaikh* &amp; residence at Kyan after my visit to him on the afternoon of the 16th the grls were brought to Saleh bin Mana's house where 1 was staying the ruler on the 16th and the 17th of June* /andand I was able to satisfy myself that the statement made by the policeman Faraj bin Hadi was quix&gt;e untrue* The girls* O &amp; «*»«&gt; as they should be mors correctly described, women,awi were taller than I am myself and both of them would certainly never see twenty again. I questioned them with regard to their brother and they stated that he was the. eldest of the XiT family sc that he cannot be less than 2S u 1 'E* years of age* The fact that the family of the policeman are grown up S&amp; has /W* a completely different complexion on the case and I now see no reason whatsoever to interfere. 4. At my request the shaikh stated that he would not himeel£ prevent, die children from joining their parents but at the same time he drew my attention to a letter which he held dated the 3rd of November 1S18 from Sir Percy Cox at that time Political He aidant in the Persian Gulf* The latter, the significance of which X regret to say I was previously not aware of, grants certain concessions to the Shaikh of Oatar which are not included in other treaties dealing with the suppression of slavery. It wo?Hd seen that the case on which I had based my request for somewhat drastic powers was not as good as I had at first imagined and therefore it is satisfactory ■•ist the Shaikh possibly spurred on by the threat, of ex-communication has '*5 tendered his apologies and cooperated to the fuxl in this particular case.

C ■ 0 p 7 3. Although there appears to be little doubt that Hussain Hamah was in hospital in Bahrain when his forged signature and the seal of the Customs Department were appended to the documents in that particular case my unpleasant attitude forced Shaikh Abdullah bin Qassim to make a sacrifice and he was the burnt offering* At the same time he is quite clearly a dismissed and disgruntled Government official and this must be taken into consideration when assessing the value of his statements. 4* I propose to send Bogers over to Qatar for five or six days towards the end of this month to Investigate and 1 shall be most grateful if enquiries can be made on the Poreian side ;l*th a view to discovering to what extent, if any.

In accordsnce with your orders, I visited Hussain Nimah at his place the other night rnd obtained the following information from him. He said that he is quite prepared to supply you with any inside information in which you are interested as he knows all the ins and outs of oatar, that he does not expect anything in return as he considers that by doing so he will be rendering a great service to his own country which is undergoing much tyranny and oppression at the hands of its greedy rulers who are not doing anything for the welfare of their own people and who are misguided by self-interested persons. He added that what he says is a clear and true picture of the state of affairs prevailing in ogtar without theleast exaggeration and requested that the source of this information may not be disclosed, although he does not fear anything so long as he is living in Bahrain. The Cereal Quota of Qatar . ^atar gets a. quota of 1500 bags of cereals (wheat, barley and whertflour) a month. Out of this 700 brgs are exported. The barley is sold at ps. 14 per maund of 56 lbs., the wheat at Rs. 18 per maund and whertflour at Rs. 38 a bag. The remaind'r is given for public consumption. The Sugar Quota of n atar . Oatar’s monthly quota of sugar used to be 200 bags. Bhaikh Abdullah and Hamad used to select 100 bags ' 50 for each) out of the best quality and expot them to Kuwait and the remaining 100 bags handed over for local consumption. But about 2 months ago when the quantity was reduced to 100 bags, 60 bags are taken away by shaikh Abdullah and Hamad and 40 given for local consumption at the rate of J lb. to each person. The ^iecegoods ^uots of Qatar . Only once and that is about three months ago that cloth was given to the people of ^atar. ®11 previous quotas used to be exported by the shaikh. Tf!' 30 bales of cloth covering oatar quota has recently arrived at oatar from Dubai. Abdullah Dsrwish suggested keeping 7 bales (neel end Savahli) for the town and exporting the remaining 23 bales. shaikh Hamad agrees to this and that is why Abdullah Derwish left Bahrain hurriedly for ^atar on the 12b September. Arms Traffic . Shaikh Hamad has always been dealing in arms; selling in °atar as well as exporting to Tran. He sold and exported large quantities of rifles and emmunition in the past years. The following are four recent cases of arms traffic carried out by Shaikh Hamad:- 1 (a) About three months ago Shaikh Hamad ship ed 127 rifles in five lots in thh boom of sultan Jabir of oatar and made in charge of Ahmad Abdullah Hussain. They were consigned to Bandar Tibin in JCishkunar Province of South Iran. The arms were sold there to Persians named Abdullah 7.er Husain, Abbas Mad Tahir and shaikh Bu Hindi, Ruler of surubash. He also sold 6000 rounds of ammunition to Mirza *sad Khanssiri of Lawar at Rs. 200 per 100 rounds. (b) About the same period he sold 5 5-shot guns with 60 rounds of ammunition for Rs. 1540 to a Persian named Muhammad Rafi bin Abdur Rahman. (c) About 2 months ago he sold 4 rifles to a Tangisiri named Ghulam Abbas through one Ibrahim Obaidan Oatari. Two of them were 10-shot rifles sold at Rs. 1000 each and the other two 5-shot Turkish rifles sold at Rs. 1240 each. (d) He sold through Abdullah Derwish 2 German rifles to a Persian named Abbas ^ayir Ali for Rs. 140 and 3 9-sbt rifles for Rs. 700. Slave Trade . About four months ago Sheikh Hamad sent seven slaves (4 male and 3 female) to Riyadh through one Abdullah bin Ghanim al Hajiri for sale there. He bought two of these slaves from the family of Muhammad bin Fijji of Dpha end two sieves from the sons of 'Sin Mad-hoob of T,T akrah, one female slave from the sons of Nasr and two slaves bought for him from Khor el Mohande by Jasim bin parwish. Abdullah bin Ghanim sold all these sieves in Riyadh and with their cost purchased piecegoods and sugar which he smuggled out of Saudi Arabia to £etsr.- 3 - This is only a recent case of slave traffic perpetrated by Shaikh Hamad. There were many cases of this sort in the past. Hussain Nimeh himself has in his house 7 manumitted slaves, wtien Shaikh Hamad came to know that Hussain had cn intention of moving his family to Bahrain, he asked him to transfer the slaves to him. Hussain said that they were flpee, bearing documents to that effect issued by him, and that it was cuite unfair that he should enslave them but Hamad is still insisting to take them over (and eventually dispose of them). Smuggling . Then Shaikh Hamad left Bahrain for ^atar in august, Abdullah Darwish smuggled by his launch 200 dozen ghutras and 20 boxes of cigarettes, each containing 1000 (The number of ghutras and cigarettes were verified by /hmad, Husain's son who travelled with them on the same launch). Sbdulleh bin Harvish purchased the ghutras from Bahrain at Bs. 8/8 each. On arrival at ogtar, he to k the cigarettes to his house but sent the ghutras to Riyadh with one Bead al Kharji who sold them there st peyals 20 e&amp;ch. General. The state of affairs in natar in every respect is very bad and there is widespread indignation amongst the ,eoole. shaikh Abdullah, getting old and feeble, is merely Ji Ji a statue and his son Hamad is in actual control of the administration of the country.

Salih al Mani» is gradually losing his irestige with Sheikh Hamad and his influence as an important figure in natar is diminishing. An incident occurred recently when one of Hamad's servants obstructed Balih and when Balih went and complained to Hamad, the letter took no action against his servant but merely sent off Belih with an unsatisfactoryreply. Salih being upset, went end drew up a long znemterandum addressing it to Shaikh Abdullah in which he mentioned all the services which he rendered to him and that he is not being cared for now. Apparently no action was taken. Salih is said to be very unhappy with this state of affaire and Abdullah Derwish f s close connection with Hamad and expects still a more gloomy p** future, especially when he hee^ji that Shaikh Hamad and Abdullah Darwish have or are going to appoint an Iraqi from Bahrain to take the place of Salih. It is true that Salih used to put obstacles in the way of Government demands from Shaikh Abdullah. Abdullah Darwish Abdullah bln Darwish is Shaikh Hamad’s adviser on all matters especially those which lead to the swelling of his wealth. Abdullah won this position with Hamad for the following two xnAin reasons i- (a) Because he smuggled and is still smuggling goods for him and malting good profits. (b) ’Family affair * Abdullah Darwish Is cunning, liar and rogue. YJherever he goes he leaves behind a black spot to his repute.

(Id) Jasstm 16-9-44CONFIDENTIAL P.A&gt; Further to the previous report on Arms Traffic, the following information has been supplied by Hussain Nimah?- Shaikh Hamad sold through Abdullah Darwish the following arms and ammunition;- (a) 15,000 rounds of ammunition sold to one Yahia agent of Ali Ismail, a notorious Persian outlaw of Dayyir in Iran who was chased last year by the R.A.F. for committing highway robbery and disturbing pear&gt;e and order. Out of these, 10,000 rounds were for 5-shot guns, 2,000 rounds were of the type used by the Army and 3,000 rounds were for 10-shot guns. These were sold at Fa.200 per 100 rounds. The Army type rounds were sold at Rs.100 per 100 rounds. (b) He sold to the same person six 10-shot rifles for Rs.550. (c) Abdullah Darwish sold 4 rifles belonging to him to Ali Ismail, two of which were 5-shot rifles sold for Hs.1,000 and the other two 10-shot rifles for Rs.700. (d) Abdullah Darwish bought one 7-shot rifle from Muhammad bin % Othaman, Director of customs, Qatar, for Rs.350/- and sold it to Bahmiyah brother of Ali Ismail for Rs.800/-. Mass Immigration from Qatar . There is a great tendency amongst the people of Qatar to immigrate from Qatar and dwell in other neighbouring towns such as Bahrain, Hasa, Darin etc. This immigration is not carried out by individuals but by families. Several families have already left. Amongst these were two famous families namely A1 Musallam and » Abdullah bin Turk! who have already left Qatar and took Darin as their residence. It came to the notice of the Shaikh of Qatar that Khalifah bin Hitmi, an important and wealthy pearl merchant of Qatar had determined to immigrate from Qatar with all his relatives and fol lowers whose number may be well about 200. It is said that the Shaikh did not allow him to leave Qatar and sent for Abdullah bin Darwish to go to Qatar and help to settle the matter. If the Shaikh allows mass immigration from Qatar, the town will be reduced to n nothing and will eventually disappear from the map as a town. It is said that a Nejdi resident of Qatar removed the chandals and doors of his house and t ried to take them away with him on leaving Qatar but was prevented to do so by the Shaikh. The Nojdi went to Riyadh and sought Ibn Saud*s help. Ibn Saud gave him a letter of good offices to the Shaikh who immediately allowed him to take his things•way Salih al Mani* had also derided to leave Qatar for good but Abdullah Darwish, on his last trip to Qatar, is said to have settled matters and that Salih is now satisfied. Abdullah Darwish left for Oatar on 19th Septat night time and returned on the 21st. He did not embark from the customs Pier as usual but from Qudhaibiyah. It is remarked that the object in doing so to smuggle goods out of Bahrain as there is no reason why he should not leave at day time and from the authorised place. It is said that he carried un^ensored letters with him from Bahrain to Qatar. I have learnt that Abdullah bin Jabur helps Abdullah Dnrwish i smuggling goods out of Bahrain and g e^s his sha^e out of the profit and that the goods are brought from Manamah and stored in Abdullah ~ ^ w w bin Jabur's house at Qudhaibiyah whence they are put on the launch. It is Abdullah bin Jabur who obtains permission from Shaikh Salman for the launch to leave from Qudhaibiyah. Abdullah bin Darwish brough three cows from Qatar and presented them to Abdullah bin Jabur. Most of the goods smuggled were ghutras, pie^egoods and tea. * Sd .

There is a great tendency amongst the people of Qatar to immigrate from Qatar and dwell in other neighbouring towns such as Bahrain, Hasa, Darin et£. -This immigration is not carried out by individuals but by families. Several families have already left. Amongst these were two famous families namely Al Husallam and Abdullah bin Turki who have already left Qatar and took Darin as their residence. It came to the notice of the Shaikh of Qatar that Khalifah bin Hitmi, an important and wealthy pearl merchant of Qatar had determined to immigrate from Qatar with all his relatives and followers whose number may be well about 200. It is said that the Shaikh did not allow him to leave Qatar and sent for Abdullah bin Darwish to go to Qatar and help to settle the matter. If the Shaikh allows mass immigration from Qatar, the town will be reduced to nothing and will eventually disappear from the map as a town. It is said that a Nejdi resident of Qatar removed the chandaIs ; and doors of his house and tried to take themaway with him on leaving Qatar but was prevented to do so by the Shaikh. The Nejdi went to Riyadh and sought Ibn Saud T s |^j((' j help. Ibn Saud gave him a. letter of good offices go the Shaikh who immediately allowed him to take his things away. Salih al Mani f had also decided to leave Qatar for good but Abdu 1 lah Darwish, on his last trip to Qatar, is said to have settled matters and that Salih is now satisfied. Abdullah Darvish left for Qatar on 19th Septat nigh; and returned on the. 21st. He did not embark from the Customs Pi as usual but from Oudhaibiyah. It is remarked that the object in doing so to to smuggle voods out of Bahrain ns there is no reason why he should not leave at day time and from the authorised piece. It is said that he carried uncensored letters with him from Bahrain to Qatar. I have learnt that Abdullah bin Jabur helps Abdullah Darwish in smuggling goods out of Bahrain and gets his share out of the profit and that the goods are brought from Manamah and stored in Abdullah bin Jabur f s house at Qudhaibiyah whence they are put on the launch. It bis Abdullah bin Jabur who obtai permission from Shaikh Salman for the launch to leave from Quo.ho.i 0 iyah• Abdullah bin Darwish brought three cows from Qatar and presented them to Abdullah bin Jabur.

Slaves are being sold and purchased freely in Qatar* Owing to the poor condition of the people nearly three fourths of Qatar*s slaves were sold to Sa*udi Arabia. Shaikh Hamad bin ♦Abdullah al Than! takes active part in this traffic* One ♦Abdullah bin Ghanim al Hajri is being financed by him. He purchases slaves from different parts of Qatar and according to r^orts goes as far as Buraimi to buy slaves. He takes these slaves to Sa*udi Arabia and sells them there. With the slaves* money he buys gold which he smuggles into Qatar. This gold is sent to Kuwait or ’Iraq via Kuwait. The profit is ‘fcbing shared equally by Haisd and * Abdullah bin Ghanim. According to reliable infosmation Shaikh *Ali bin ♦Abdullah, elder son of the Ruler, left for pilgrimage about five weeks ago. He took with him six female and ten male salves. At the time he left, he did not make up his mind what to to do with these slaves. It Is certain however that he would either present them to H.M.King Bin Sa*ud antfd his relatives or sell them. Nasir bin Jasim al Thani, half brother of the Ruler of Qatar, who has been living in Hasa for the last fen years/ is reported! to have purchased a female slave from his brother Muhammad for Rs.1500/- He was asked by a friend in Hasa to buy her for him.

There is a general grumbling and anti feeling against the present administration in Qatar and the condition of the people is worse than miserable. Shaikh Hamad bin ’Abdullah is hated by each and every person including his own brokers. ills father lias retired and takes little or no interest in the management of affairs which are entrusted to his son Hamad. Hamad lias a share in each and every line of trade even dry fish which is imported from the Trucial Coast for cattle. . Many people have left Qatar for Sa'udi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait and Trucial Coast as far as Khasab. Many are expected to leave within the next two months. 7. Marzuk ash-Shamlan has recently come to Qatar and left for Persia with SO bags of sugar of which he purchased 50 Yrorn^ Hamad and 30 from unknown persons about four months ago. He also had with him piecegoods which he purchased from Muhami.ad bin ’Abdur Rahman Fakhra who smuggled them from India to Qatar and there sold then to Marzuq ash-Shamlan. f^arzuq is still on the Persian Coast having not been able to sell the goods which he purcisased from Qatar at very hi&amp;h prices. 12th November, 1944. SD./ A. Razzaq.7 1 C P.R. 13 In view of the fact that y&amp;x Express Letter No. c/374 dated the 18th October was not received by me until you had arrived in Bahrain on tour and His Highness had expressed a desire to discuss the Zubara question with you at an early opportunity I refrained from taking action in accordance with paragraph 6 of my letter No.C/1424 dated the 4th October IS44. 2. On the 19th of October at the interview which you had with His Highness at Raffa, at which were present the Adviser to the Bahrain Government and myself, he spoke with considerable feeling on the subject of what he considered to be the Shaikh of Qatar*s failure to implement the Bahrain--Qatar Agreement. He demanded the destruction of the Qatar fort at Zubara and the withdrawal from zubara of the Shaikh of Qatar’s guards, you refrained from stating any opinion at the time and informed His Highness that you proposed to let him have an answer at a later date. As a result of further discussions which we had on the subject it ras decided that His Highness* demand for the destruction of the fort was unreasonable and not in accordance with the aforesaid agreement, 1 hereas his request for the with drawal of the .guards might bo considered to be reasonable. In order to ascertain what the Shaikh of Qatar’s attitude would be to a request by us for the withdrawal of the guards it was deci ded that Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzaak, the Residency Agent ||| at Sharjah, should go to Qatar and personally sound the Shaikh on this point. Phis was done and shortly after y ,ur return from _ ^ I India the Khan Bahadur returned to Bahrain from Qatar with the x somewhat disconcerting news thab the Shaikh of Qatar had refused point blank to agree to any suggestion that the guards should be withdrawn. 3. On my instructions Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur R a zzaak while in Qatar made confidential enquiries into certain allegations with regard to smuggling which have been received by me and on his return handed me a report which confirmed my suspicions that smuggling of piecegcods as being carried on and that ShaikhX 2. Hamad bin Abdullah Al Than! was actively engaged not only in this practice but also in slave trading. It was decided that in view of the reports which had been received from various parts of the Gulf and of the report now furnished by Khan Bahadur S&amp;iyid Abdur Razzaak, a trustworthy and skilful observer, that action would have to be taken to ensure thal? huota goods of all descriptions were not re-exported after their arrival.in Qatar. A letter, a copy of which has been handed to your office under ny printed leuter No.C/1666 dated the ISth November 1944, \ , ao eoiLposed ,-..f;or consultation with you and despatched to the Shaikh of Qatar informing him of the action which it is proposed to take, that is, to appoint a Bahrain firm of standing to recerw all imports of quota goods and to depute a member of this Agsucy to introduce an adequate rationing scheme. 4.0 At the same time the Shaikh of Bahrain was informed that there would be no objection to his conducting direct negouiatior with the ihaikh of Qatar with the object of obtaining the with drawal of the guards from the fort at Zubara provided he kept me fully informed of the progress of chs negotiations. ^ 5. The cforeruentioned letter to the shaikh of Qatar has been despatched and enquiries have been made from the firm of phaman- nnl Isardas whether they will b© willing to undertake the import ation of quota goods into Qatar. They have not yet given theii decision but I anticipate that they will in fact be quite willin to assist us by undertaking the work and it is my intention to depute Jassim bin Mohantned who is at present on loan to the \ |i| public delations Bureau to inaugurate a rationing scheme. The Shaikh of Qatar has been told that in view of his failure to rearrvy cooperate in preventing the misappropriation of quo^a good!!^ it is not our intention to make provision for him ana his imme- diate relatives. We have also informed the Shaikh that we hope to be able to introduce this simple rationing scheme by the j 15th of December. . ‘ ^ Ho attempt has been made to keep this matter secret. In fact the reverse has been the policy because the re-export from t3. Qatar of quota goods of all descriptions has received very- considerable publicity- in the Gulf among the local Arabs and they are also aware of Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah’s slaving and possibly arms traficking side-lines.. It is therefore most desirable that the world of the Persian Gulf should be equally well informed of the measures which we propose to take to coun teract these practices. I am sure that the action which has boon taken sc with regard to Qatar will have a very satis factory effect and will serve to make clear to everyone that although we can be fooled for part of the time we cannot be fooled the whole time and that when we do take action we rightly do not indulge in half measures. 20-11-44 v * /CONFIDENTIAL No.C/1678. From al s' 0 V Political Agency, Bahrain, 22nd November 1944. To ■ Political Agent, Bahrain. The Hon^le the political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Camp Bahrain. Sir, ^ I have the honour to refer to my Printed Letter No. C/1667 dated the 20th November 1944 enclosing reports from various sources on the smuggling activities of the ruling family in Qatar. 2. The principal assistants and confidants of Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah bin Thani in his smuggling and arms dealing operations are the three Darwish brothers, sons of Persian parents who emigrated to Qatar some years ago. The eldest, Jassim, is by way of posing as a ^ mutawwah ,, and pretends to some knowledge of theological matters. He is a 'tawwash” by profession and acts principally as Shaikh Hamad*s pearl buying agent though he is alleged to have had a hand in some very uns&amp;intly transactions. The youngest brother is Abdur Rahman, a well set up young man of about twentyfive years of age who acts as understudy and assistant to his brother Abdullah of whom a full account will be given in the succeeding paragraph of this letter. It is possible that if this young man were severely warned he might make an endeavour to mend his ways. 3. The most important and notorious member of this family W is Abdullah the thii^^rotheij a bearded, one eyed man of between thirty and forty, clever, and with a really remarkablt capacity for smooth lying. He is Shaikh Hamad's man of affairs i and carries through practically all his smuggling ventures with no little profit tp himself for he is as willing to deceive his master as he is anyone else. He follows the legitimate profession of a wholesale trader and holds no official position /with2 . with the Shaikh of Qatar or his son, by the former of whom he is not well liked. He was actively engaged in smuggling while in Bahrain in attendance on Shaikh Hamad bin Abdullah during that individual’s two periods of treatment in hospital and made use of his master’s launch to avoid the Bahrain customs’ patrols. The launch was used with the full consent of Shaikh Hamad who was a profit sharing partner in the enter prises, but no action was taken by the Bahrain authorities as His Highness was treating Shaikh Hamad as an honoured guest. Abdullah Darwish, in addition to his other activities, holds the appointment of agent for the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in Qatar, an appointment which while possibly not particularly lucrative undoubtedly enhances his prestige. It is^in my opinion^time that this man was shown that the Political Authorities in the Persian Gulf are not prepared to countenance deliberate and continued disregard for the law and the best way in which to' do this would be to restrict his move- done by refusing him travel papers and enlisting the coopera tion of the Rulers of the Gulf to prevent the free movement necessary to all smuggling ventures and in this ban I would include his brothers Jassim and Abdur Rahman. His prestige would receive a serious blow if he was to be reriioved from his agency by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and I suggest that the Company should be made aware of the activities of their trusted agent and informed that he is not in your opinion a suitable person from a political point of view to be entrusted with their agency, and that his continuance in the appointment is embarrassing to us and harmful to them for his activities, though doubtless proof of his intelligence, reflect but little ments and lower his prestige.

On your request to forbid these three persons from travelling to and fro I have ordered all our offices to forbid them to land in Bahrain. A.C IT.E.CONFIDENTIAL. P.A. Husain Hamah has given the following report which he has extracted from Salih al Mana T who arrived from Qatar yesterday morning. ^our letter to the Shaikh of Qatar informing him of your decision to take over the rationing of foodstuff etc., from him was a great shock to him and to his son \ Hamad. Apart from the fact that they would be deprived of a good income, this action would put them dorm in the eyes of the people. They conferred several times as to what course of action they should take. They at once summoned Salih from Bahrain for consultation and when he arrived there he found that they had decided td&gt; complain to the Hon f ble the P.R. against the P.A.and to send their complaint by Abdullah bin Darwish with instructions to hand it over to the P.R. personally at Bahrain or wherever he may be. When they disclosed their intention to Salih, he told them that this was not the right Tray to do things and that they should send their representations to the P.A. to which they agreed. While Abdullah bin Darwish and his brother were sitting in the Majlis of Muhammad al Mana T , P.B»s announcement regarding the restriction of their movements was broadcast from Bahrain Radio. This announcement came as a severe blow to them and.confined themselves in their house for two days on account of shame and anxiety. Abdullah then went to Salih and requested him to do something for him. \ # \ * 12.44Translation of latter dated 12th Dhul Hijjah 1363(15.11*1944) from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, C.I.E., Ruler of Qetaf, to the Political Agent, ^aheain. After Compliments. / Reference your letter No.C/1646 dated 15th November 1944 corresponding to the 29th Dhul Qada 1363. I was surprised by what you mentioned with regard to the quota and as I am sure of your good intentions I attributed ±± that to what is seat around by people who have certain interests. When you visited me, the visit referred to by you, and in your discussion with me, I explained to you that whatever waa mentioned to you of this sort is untrue. I divide and distribute the quota in a way suitable to my country and the procedure I follow is the procedure ±k followed in this respect. I wish if you had made sure and asked me for the statements regarding the quota showing its receipt and distribution. Then, facts would have been known to you and you would have seen that I do not handle the quota in my interest or the interest of any other person but I distribute it according to regulations. * 4 Nevertheless, I appreciate your humanity and you keen interest in these matters and I attribute these to your honest alms and noble goal. But I am surprised from your statement that instead of cooperating with you in preventing smuggling I gave way for these acts. Is it sensible that I 'way to an action which I know is detrimental to i»y and my country*s interests? You also see that activities of smuggling are going on in all parts of the world and the duties of the governments are to prevent them. Therefore, is it appropriate of me to gi ve w ay whilst I know that I have a duty and that the interest of my country and my subjects make it imperative for me to do my duty. Ypu may have been affected by some untrue statements, otherwise Si^ I am sure that you know my condition and my honesty my prestigue and the interests of my country are thn mmt importantIl'MIHWHIi'I'H I'! IHMHIWI - 2 - to me than anything else* As to my son Shaikh Hamad encouraging people dealing in this trade, as mentioned by you, this is an amazing thing* Whatever was mentioned to you in this respect is an allegation and all of it is untrue* My son, in fact, is the person who combats smuggling with all his efforts and wd challenge, any person who has mentioned that to you,to prove any of it, otherwise, facts stand by themselves. And I believe you are above believing words like these emanating from men who have interests. With regard to the reference that there are people who were compelled d to leave the country and you gave the reason, as you me ntioned, this is untrue. It is a sample of what is said by self-interested people. The fact is^ that those who left the country were weak and poor people who used to work in the past with the Compnay and when the Company stopped its work they did not find any other work and, being of the labourers' class, they were compelled to earn, and it is our duty to help such people in making earning easy for them. They did not leave the country for the cause you assumed, and they are better fed than people in other places. Wfaen the C 0 mpany will resume its activities, they will return and they prefer working in their country^at less than the wages they get in other places. God knows that I help many of them with food and other things which relieve them from the troubles of the present circumstances. As to what you mentioned, iu-that the Honlble the Political Resident aims at a just distribution, be sure that our distribution of quota is just and convenient. All the people get their rations without difficulty p nd with all ease, and I do not think there is anybody who complains in this respect because quota is divided among them in a satisfactory manner and no persons have concessions over others but all are equal in rations i : Baccording to the number^ of the family. I believe that the ease of rationing in my country is better than in other places. The quota that comes to my country is known to you and the distribution is also known. You need not but ask me for monthly statements of what is received and what is distributed which I will send you with pleasure so that you may rest assured of my good intentions and my efforts to feed my country and the interests of my subjects in every way. This in addition to the difficulties and the troubles I encounter in not obtaining other commodities which come on a barter basis because I have no allowances for barter like o-ther neighbour ing countries. You are well aware of the present position, all the neighbouring countries have allowances for barter for other commodities which are required in every country, thereby the condition of the people is improved and made more comfortable. Vl/e, as you are arware, are in need, in view of the circumstances and the present position, of several things from the Iranian, side and other places. If we have no Mubadalah nothing comes to us and thereby we will lose a lot of commodities and I have referred this to you many times. I admit that a small proportion of the surplus barley is expended by us for Mubadalah in replacement of other commodities although it does not help much. With regard to the rest of the quota, I take the greatest care of the k | l commodities because it is insufficient compared with the people of &amp;atar. You also know that I did not get piecegoods except a small quantity a short while ago; it is little and is hot sufficient for the needs of £he country, also tea of which I did not get more than twenty-nine cases during four months and that, naturally, is a small amount. With reference to your appointing a representative at Doha to supervise quota through a merchant, this will be no more than an assertion of what you mentioned with regard to my dishonesty in distributing quita. That is a thing, I think,ysx towards- 4 - neither which you know my attitude. I cannot agree to accept/a representative nor a merchant and that to conserve my prestige but I assure you that the quota is distributed justly and is nbt touched and I can forward to you statements showing exactly what is received and what is distributed. With regard to the last paragraph of your letter, it is possible that you imagined or thought No doubt you know my condition and what my governmental position entails . I may expend some of the quota by distributing ±± amonjgsrt my retinue, guards,soldiers responsible for public order and the members of ^atar tribes who ftfee^with me. This distribution will be under my supervision and does not come under the Control Offices in the country. I request you to think over what I explained and render me the usual coperation you have given me in all circumstances. Usual Ending. cTelegram S(A). rv y^j From Political Agent, Bahrain. To Political Resident, Bushire. No. 1065. Dated the 3rd December, 1944. IMPORTANT . Reference my letter No. C/1690 November 24th. ✓ | * 2. Shaikh of Qatar has replied to my letter No.C/l646 dated 15th November (my Printed Letter No.C/1666 of November 18th refers) denying that he has ever countenanced smuggling or that Shaikh Hamad has engaged in it, he ascribes the reports received to the machinations of ill-disposed persons, andnaintains that his people receive a proper share of all imports under his direction. He complains that his quota allotments are insufficient for the population and that he receives no quota for barter. He ends his letter by refusing to accept either a representative from this Agency to supervise distribution of quota goods or a merchant to do the actual importing and distributing on the grounds that to do so would be tantamount to admitting his own dishonesty. 3. Salih bin Manah presented the Shaikh 1 s letter in person and pleaded eloquently for him saying that he felt certain that in future we should have no cause for complaint. I regret that I cannot subscribe to this view as in my opinion Shaikh Abdullah, for whom personally I have much regard, is no longer the de-facto ruler and Shaikh Hamad in whose hands the power is is a most untrustworthy person. 4. Salih bin Manah suggested that in order to pfeserve the Shaikh's prestige he (SaULh bin Manah) should be entrusted with the distribution cf quota goods and promised that he would keep me fully informed of any attempts to circumvent the rationing scheme which he proposed should be introduced by the Shaikh. From my knowledge of the man I do not consider that he is to be relied upon and feel that he is principally interested in re-establishing his own position in Qatar.5. In my opinion there are three courses to us:- Xa) to insist on oiir rights under Articles Vll and Vlll of the treaty of 1916 and carry out our intentions as specified in paragraph 2 of my letter referred to in paragraph 2 above; (b) to refuse to permit any further quota goods to go to Qatar on the grounds that the Shaikh has shown himself unwilling and unable to prevent their being misappropriated and has objected to our taking adequate measures to ensure their correct distribtuion; and ( c ) to modify (a) to the extent of informing the Shaikh that we shall have no objection to his appointing a Controller of Rationing to co-operate with our representative who will remain in Qatar only so long as we consider desirable# Further Messrs# Dhamanmal Issardas who have been selected as our importers will deal as a retailer only with grain, sugar and tea. That piecegoods, etc#, after importation by them will be distributed to Qatar merchants for retail sale# 6. I consider that (c) would be the most satisfactory solution as it will indicate to the Shaikh that we intend to i enforce our treaty rights and to carry put the decision already announced in paragraph 2 of my letter referred to in paragraph 2, that we are prepared to cooperate with his officials, that provided their future conduct make it practicable our represent ative would be withdrawn, and will ensure a reasonable distrib ution of foodstuffs to the population without seriously affecting the piecegoods, etc., trade of the country. 7.

There is not any sort of ration system for foods, at Qatar. Shaikh Hamad has opened two shops to issue to the people who bring chit from him.

This letter has aroused much interest to Shaikh Abdulla and his son Hamad. Shaikh Hamad privately consulted Abdullah Jarwish about the reply, who gave him verbal ways for the reply to bluntly and flatly refuse the Government suggestion to appoint a representative at ^atar to deal with the foodstuffs as such appointment will be considered c the Arabic world as interference by the British Government in ^atar affairs. They decided to call back Salih Sulaiman al liana'i tq Qatar to give his opinion, and to frame the reply. as soon as he arrived he went to Shaikh Abdullah and they took his opinion. He gave them his opinion hut instead they decided not to act according to it. Lat&amp;r I met Salih al-kana'i who told me ' I am always put in sent for me to take my'opinion and I told tro ub1e. The Shaikhsthem it v/iil be benefitial to them to accept the. Government ’ s slitrestion. They consulted some other people (meaning abdullah Jarvvish) . They did not accept my opinion. If they consulted athers why have they not sent their reply and not sent for me, and I should have Jsaved the trouble. m! At the first instance they were not accepting to agree about Zobarali and rationing ci. the food at Qatar, from the gossip between some people I learnt thet Ghaikh Abdulla says that he will cut to pieces anyone sent * ... by the British Government to supervise the distribution of the foodstuffs, he also said that he and his followers will live on dates and fish and not to accept the appointment of a representative. Shaikh Hamad at once stopped the issue of foods to the people until the return of Salih: Sulaiman al liana'i who will convey to them the Government's opinion. The broadcast preventing ^1-Jarv/ish from travelling •outside has had a strong effect on Shaikh Hamad and Al-Jarwish. When Abdullah sarwish heard the broadcast he got perturbed and anxious about his future. It is stated that he sale; that thi broadcast is harmful to their name among the nrabs. To please the Government and to induce them to cancel their order, he went .to Shaikh Hamad and persuaded him to cede to the Government request about Sobarah. Shaikh Hamad has fallen in to. his might have been request about Sobarah, which xiiixhx conveyed to you by Salih al-liana' i. nX-Tihii.I. - The other members of nl Ihani, even his son, are pressed.by Shaikh Hamad.

His family ih about SO persons and his pay during the year is not more than As.800/- inclading foodstuff and clothing. One Jasim son of Shaikh i Hamad ran away to King Ibn Gaud some time ago, who was persued and taken back. Then he was asked the cause he replied that his pay of Rs. 1,000/- each year is not enough for him and hls^ followers. But all the other members of Al-Thani are not united.

X divide and distribute the quota in a way suitable to my country and the procedure I follow is the procedure followed in this respect. X wish if you had made sure and asked me for the statements regarding the quota showing its receipt and distribution. Then facts would have been known to you and you would have seen that I do not handle tho quota in my interest or the Interest of ary other person but I distribute it according to regulations. Nevertheless, I appreciate your humanity and your keen Interest in these matters and I attribute these to your honest aims end noble goal. But J am surprised from your statement that instead of cooperating with you in preventing snuggling I concurred with these acts. Is it sensible that I concur to *$qc an action which I know Is detrimental to me and my country’s Interests? You also see that activities of smuggling are going on in all parts of the world and the duties of the governments are to prevent then. Therefore, is it appropriate of me to concur whilst I knoy/ that I have a duty and that the interest of my country and my subjects make it imperative for me to do my duty. You may have been affected by some untrue statements, otherwise i an sure that you know my condition and my honesty as my prestige end the interests of my country are more important to me than anything else. As to my son Shaikh Hamad encouraging people dealing in this traae, as mentioned by you, this is an amazing thing. Whatever was mentioned to you In this respect Is an allegation and all of it is untrue. My son, In fact, is the person who combats smuggling with all his efforts and we challenge, any person who has mentioned that to you, to prove any of it, otherwise, facts stand by themselves. And I believe you are above believing words like these emanating from men who have interests. With regard to the reference that there are people who were compelled to leave the country and you gave the reason, as you mentioned, this Is untrue. It is a sample of what is sail by self-interested people. The fact Is, that these who loft the country were weak and poor people who t2**d to work In the past with thtf Company and when the Company stopped Its work they did not find any other work and, being of the labourers’ class, they were compelled to earn, and it Is our duty to help such people in making earning easy for them. They did not leave the country for the cause you assumed, and they are better fed than people .hi other places. When the Company will resume its activities, they will return and they prefer working In their country even at less than the wages they get in oilier places. God knows that I help many of them with food and other things which relieve them from the troubles of the present circumstances. As to what you mentioned that the Honourable the Political Resident aims av a just distribution, be sure that our distribution of quota is just ana convenient. All the people get their rations without difficulty'and with all ease, and I do not think there is anybo iyWho complains in this respect because quota is divided' among them in a satisfactory manner and ro persons have concessions over ethers but all are equal in rations according to the number of the family.

This in addition to the difficulties and the troubles T encounter in not obtaining other commodities which come on a barter basis because I have no allowances for barter like other neighbouring countries* You are well aware of the present position, all the neighbouring countries have allowances for barter for other commodities which are required in every country, thereby the condition of the people is imprdved and made more comfortable# We, as you are aware, arc in need, in view of the circumstances and the present position, of several things from the Iranian side and other places.

That is a thing, I think, towards which you know my attituue* I cannot agree to accept neither a representative nor a merchant and that to conserve my jirestige but I assure you that the quota Is distributed justly and is not touched and I can forward to you statements shewing exactly what Is received and whet is distributed# v*ith regard to the last paragraph of your letter, it is possible that you imagined or thought so. ho doubt you know my condition and what my governmental position entails. I may expend some of the quota by distributing amongst my retinue, guards, soldiers responsible for public order and the members of &lt;atar tribes who may be with me. This distribution will be under my supervision and does not come under the Control Offices in the country. I request you to think ever what I explained and render me the usual coperation you have given me in all circumstances.

Some months ago 34 bundles of piacogoods were received df which 7 bundles hove been issued and the balance of’27 bundles If., still lying with tnem. They have not issued the rest as they are waiting for the new quota piecegoods at which time they will be in a position to dispose of the better quality and give the Inferior to the people.

This letter has aroused much interest to Shaikh Abdulla and his son Hamad. Shaikh Hamad privately consulted Abdullah Darwish about the reply, who gave him verbal ways for the reply to bluntly add■flatly refuse the Government suggestion lo appoint a x*epresentative at Qatar to deal with the foodstuffs as such appointment will be considered by the Arabic world as interference by the British Governiru:.nt in *atar affairs. They decided to call back Salih Suleiman al Mana’i to ^atar to give his opinion and to frame the reply. As soon as he arrived he went to Shaikh Abdullah and they took his opinion. He gave them bis opinion but instead they decided not to act according to It. Later I met Salih al Manaif who told me 'I am always put in trouble. The ohaikhs sent for me to take my opinion and I told them it will be benefitial to them to accept the Government's suggestion. They consulted some other people (meaning Abdullah barvish). They did not accept my opinion. If they consulted others why have they not sent their reply and not sent for me, and X should have been saved the trouble”. At the first instance they were not accepting to agree about 2obarah and rationing of the food at ^atar. From the gossip between come people I learnt f at Shaikh Abdulla says that he will cut to pieces anyone sent by the British Government to supervise the distribution of the foodstuffs. h‘' also said that he and his followers will live on dates and fish and not to accept the appointment of a raprasant&amp;tlve. . shaikh Hamad at once i &gt;*d the issue of foods to the people until the return of Salih oulaiman al Mana 1 ! who will convoy to them the Government’s opinion.

Memin, Cairo, l^olit icaj., Bahrain. v 5?v For some time past there have been rumours of smuggling of arms, quota goods and slaves through the Qatar Peninsula. Proof was difficult to obtain and deterrent measures wore postponed as they would have prejudiced the negotiations for the settlement of the long standing dispute between the Rulers of Bahrain and Qatar over the question of Zubarah. 2. The Ruler of Qatar was on several occasions warned of these reports by the Political Agent, Bahrain, and asked to take immediate steps %o prevent a position which was illegal and contrary to the interests of his people. From further reports received in October and also from investigations by the Residency Agent, Sharjah, who was deputed to visit Qatar, it became clear that far from co-operating in the px^evention of smuggling, the Ruler (I or rather his eldest son and heir, Shaikh liara&amp;d in whose minds power is now mainly centred ) and his relatives were both directly and indirectly encouraging it to their profit. Quota cereals, sugar and piecegcods were being re-exported to Persia and to other ports on the Arab side of the Gulf, and goods imported from India were never landed but sent under fresh manifests to other ports in the Gulf, while the population of Qatar went short. 3 # xhe Ruler of Qatar has therefore been informed that in order to ensure a fair distribution of quota goods to his people a system or rationing under the control of the Political Agency, Bahrain, would be introduced in Qatar, that it is proposed that a representative of the Agency should ai e up his residence in Qatar and supervise the distribution oi goods through a reliable merchant appointed from Bahrain, and finally that no allotment of quota goods would be made to him Or his immediate relatives and their families,it being clear from their previous activities that they were amply supplied with (SigncUure) {Designation) s. 44 . MFP—1450 S&amp;P—{M-2386)—26-3-40—15,000.foodstuffs and other commodities. 4. It is anticipated that it will be possible to introduce tie system of rationing shortly. Wide publicity has been given t&gt; the action taken in order that it may have the greatest deterrent effect. Action has already been taken to restrict tie movements of Shaikh Hamad’s main assistant and his brothers aid has had a salutary effect. SD. GEOFFREY PRIOR POLITICAL RESIDENT, PERSIAN GULF.

To No. 1144 Dated the 23rd December, 1944 \ IMPORTANT * 2 Reference your telegram No.2225 dated 12th December Jassim bin Mohamed my interpreter returned on the 22nd of December with the Shaikh of Qatar's answer to the letter sent by me in accordance with the instructions contained in your telegram under reference. The Shaikh of (^atar reaffirms his non-acceptance of a representative of this Agency or a merchant for the reasons already stated in paragraph 2 of my telegram No.1065 dated December 3rd, he however offers to provide monthly rationing figures. 3. Jassim states that he made the position clear to the Shaikh and revealed that the question of withholding quotas was under consideration. Shaikh Abdullah refused completely to change his views regarding a representative and referred to Sir Percy Cox’s letter of November 3rd, 1916. Jassim’s view is that the Shaikh would offer no active opposition to the advent of a representative but would not co-operate in any rationing scheme we might introduce. 4. The logical sequence of events would now be for us to inform the Shaikh that as he will not agree to our control of the distribution of quota goods and as we are not satisfied with his or his officials’ present conduct we have no alternative but to withhold quotas from, say, the 1st of January. 5. Such action on our part will have a deplorable / V effect on the majority of the inhabitants of Qatar who are already seriously short of supplies and will have no immediate affect on the Shaikhs who have their own private stores of /foodstuffs.I. foodstuffs. It is regrettable but if our undertakings are to be honoured I can see no alternative. R.M. - POLITICAL -Translation of letter dated 6th Muharram 1364(SI.IS,1944) from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, Ruler of Qetar, to the Political Asent, Bahrain. After Oomuliments. \ i # (7^ T have received your letter No.c/1774 dated 16th December 1944 equivalent to 1st Muharram 1364 and thank you for your kind efforts and good intentions. In my letter of the ISth Dhul Hijjah 1363(15*1S) T explained to you clearly the present state of affairs here and informed you of the rations given to the inhabitants out of the quota and that it is carried out in a fair and comfortable manner. I also informed you that should there be a representative for this p\irpose, it will mean that my honesty is doubtful. T requested you to appreciate my position in view of that. I, therefore, informed you that I do not agree to accept neither a representat5_ve nnr a merchant for this purpose. As you have again mentioned the representative in your letter under reference, I would o repeat what T had mentioned to you that it is not possible for me at all to accept a representative or a merchant for this purpose but T assure you that the quota will be distributed in a fair and comfortable manner. It will be practicable to distribute every month’s quota by maintaining accurate records for the rations, a copy of which will be submitted to you every month so that you may rest assured that distribution is carried out in a satisfactory manner. A representative or a. merchant for this purpose would harm my repute and prestige. Your Honour will not agree that I should be subjected to this. I request 3 r 0 u to help me by regarding my feelings for the reasons which I have explained to you in my unwillingness to accept a representative and a merchant, and considering the fact that it is difficult for me to tolerate this matter. T am confident that if you think over what I have stated it will be clear to you that mv excuse is reasonable. I hope you will render me as^ist^nce and cooperation which is your habit in allOOTTffTD^NT I A L. m j.. I arrived at Doha on 17-1S-44 shortly after sunset and went to see the Shaikh next raorning at his camp at Umm al Baqar, 10 miles from Doha. I was accompanied by Salih al lam*. After the usual courtesy talk, I h anded over your letter regarding food rationing to him. He read it carefully and then passed it to his son Hamad who r ad it too. Then the Shaikh said that he would not agree at all to a representative or a merchant being sent for food rationing even if he is permitted to appoint a controller to co-operate with them. He added that should he agree to this he would be showing the public that he was a thief and that the Government had made this arrangement in order to check him up and that he is a child and cannot manage his omaffairs. I pointed out to him that his appointing a Controller will dispel the inference that food rationing has been taken away from his hands and will prevent to a great extent his losing face. He said, 'I persist in refusing a representative or a merchant whoever they may be and the only thing that T can do is that I will allow a Government representative to have access to my records of food rationing and will furnish monthly statements showing what has been expended.” Then he said, ”1 cannot accept a Governent representative for this type of work and that the appointment of a Government representative is to be preceded by negotiat ions and my consent obtained first.” I said to him that I have been instructed by the Political Agent to inform him that diK should he decide to accept our proposed arrangements, he(the P,A.)considers Salih al Mani f would be a suitable person to fill the appointment of a Controller for rationing on his behalf. He replied that his Controller will vanish into the Government’s representative and that however great may be the influence of his Controller it will not help much in retaining his prestige. Shaikh Hamad who was also taking part in these conversations showed strong objection and was corroborating \2 his father’s statement. X srent about two hours trying to |I convince the Shaikh in every way possible but he showed conplets unwillingness to accept the proposed arrangements. In the endj told him that if he does not agree to this course, I instrud to inform him that there will be no alternative but to stop the quotas. He said, Tt ! do not mind stopping the quotas. people do not agree to a representative or a merchant being sent ksrq biit should they agree I will prefer to abdicate. If the quota is stopped, the people will live on dates and fish but they caa do so for a long time; they will eventually have to leave the country. X would, agree to this talcing place rather than acc6|i a representative or a merchant.' The Shaikh may be referring to what he believes would be the ease in saying that this vail put him down in the eyes of the public but Shaikh Hamad’s great concern is the large income which he derives from the handlingof the quotas which he will j automatically cease to get should he accept the arrangement. During the conversation, Shaikh Hamad said, 'The P.A. wrote to my father that I encourage smuggling. This cannot be proved against me. Reports by self-interested persons should I be accepted as such people T s object is to benefit themselves Tj in harming others.' Here I took out P.AiKiiwait f s telegram ra Muhammad bin KALLA and read it to them. Hamad surprisingly sai 'The 5 bales of cloth are the remainder of 66 bales originally owned by ITarzuq al Shamlan Kuwaiti and Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani f and smuggled by them from Kuwait to Qatar and kfest v.ta they found the prices were low in Q,atar they re-shipped them to Kuwait by the boat of Muhammad Kalla. I got a written undertakil from Mar^uq al Shamlan to this effect (He showed it to me). As regards the sugar and tea, he said he had permitted their expo? on barter basis and alleged that they were not quota goods but were out of the goods that arrive at Qatar by smuggling from tli&lt; neighbouring countries such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Hasa. He /he ■ further said that/ allows the entry of goods smuggled from other places in order to use them for re-export in return for livestoc firwwwod etc., imported from Iran. The Shaikh himself did not^3 anything as he seemed quite ignorant of Hamad*s activities in this line. Salih al Mani* told me that Shaikh Hamad’s expalanation is untrue and he can’t see how he expects the Government to believe such an excuse* Ihile discussing this subject, T have noticed that Shaikh Hamad was doing his best to show that Bahrain is the centre for smuggling and not Oatar. He particularly mentioned moiee than once that smugglers’ boats stop at Fasht Jarada in Bahrain and transfer the smuggled goods to other boats. He also said that most of the Qataris living in Bahrain are smugglers as they have no ostensible means of living. really does not agree to either a representative or a merchant or both. If he is forced to agree, he will not obstruct but will not give active co-operation. He will take it as a compulsory act and unjustified interference in his internal affairs. Salih al Mani’ told me that if this is left to the Shaikh it can be used as a ’’bargain” for any demand which the Government might wish to make on him, one of which is the withdrawal of the guards from Zubara garrison to which he will definitely agree. At this stage I personally cannot foresee how far this statement of Salih will come out true as the Shaikh’s past record is not so encouraging. As regards t^e reaction of the people of Qatar to our proposed scheme, there is general popularity as they hope, in any case, to get their full rations if it comes into existence. The present system of rationing is far from satisfactory. The following is the distribution of the sugar quota:- Each person is given 1 lb. only and some poor people are not given any sugar on the ground that they do not drink tea while Abdullah Darwish is given bags, Muhammad bin Othaan Director of Customs, 1 bag, Nasir Obaidan,Hamad’s From what I have seen I can judge that the Shaikh 25 bags 25 ” 6 ” 6 ” 38 ” Taken by Sh.Abdullah ” ” Sh. Hamad. Sent to Wakra. ” ” Khor. Distributed in Doha. im ”/ - 4 - Agent in Doha, 1 bag. As regards cloth, each man vms given 5 yards of Swahili which are not enough for a gowni On our arrival they started distributing cloth to the people(out of the last consignment of 50 bales which arrived at Qatar one month ago). As regards cereals, I was told by Tasim Jaidah, brother of ^usuf bin Ahmad Ifaidah who is in charge of the distribution of cereals that they sell wheat at the rate of rs. 16/- a maund (56 lbs.) and wheat mixed with barley at the r.o+P of rs. 12^ a maund. While I was there a boat arrived I from Bahrain bringing cereals from, ^ahrain to Oatar. The nakhuda stated that he had jettisoned 100 bags of wheat on I account of rough sea and boisterous weather. The price of wheat was at once raised to Rs.18/- a maund in order to make up the loss. This, of course, caused a large amount of dissatisfaction.' ^he Shaikh has still some thousands of bags of rice and Abdullah Barwish has over a thousand bags. From time to time they sell locally at the rate of Rs. 150-10 a bag and export also, mostly to Saudi Arabia where the price has increased lately, it is said to be Rs.200 a bag. I have observed that Abdullah Barwish has a fairly considerable amount of control over rationing and still exercises influence on Shaikh Hamad. P.R’s ban on his and his brothers movements had a salutary effect on him and has put him in a precarious state of mind. He came to my place and requested me, in a rather imploring manner, to inform you that he is quite innocent of what has been attributed to him and that he is quite prepared to help the Government in any manner they like. Roth Shaikh Hamad and Abdullah j Darwish suspect Muhammad al,Mani f and Husain Nama of report! against them to the P.A. and they have gloomy forebodings ftj the latter. Shaikh Abdullah no more takes any interest in tbl local affairs and has left everything in the hands of his Hamad who vists the town almost daily and looks after thing 3 ! The first thing that he does he enquires about prices of .J commodities in Qatar and abroad and what goods have been wn5 It is said that he keeps his father f s seal with hin and v uses it whenever he. likes without his father’s knowledge. It is also said that when Abdullah Darwish was in Dubai arranging for the shipment of Qatar quotas, he used to be in possession of blank/manifests which he used to fill in when shipping the goods to destinations other than Qatar. -I handed over P.A*s letter rei rounds of ammunition stolen from Muharraq to the Shaikh who read it and passed it on to his son Hamad. Hamad said that rounds may be found in the town but that he cannot say whether they are actually stolen from Hahrain or not as everyone who has them will naturally say that he had acquired them a long time ago. He however, said he would spare no effort to collect as many rounds as he can. In the afternoon Shaikh Hamad told me that he had the houses of Falih bin Ahmad bin Thani and Nasif bin Ehalid bin Thani searched by Amir Haramam and the Director of Customs and that no arms were found except 3 rifles and 70 rounds in the house of one and 2 rifles and 78 rounds in the house of the other which were their personal weapons. Then he asked me to get ready to go next morning to Fuwais which is 100 miles north of Doha for searching the houses of the other two suspects. Early in the following morning I went with .Amir Hammam and 10 armed men by lorry to Huwais which we reached after 4 hour’s drive on difficult country. The houses of both °ayid Ali bin Sayid Mohammad and his brother Sayid Husain were searched by the Amir and his men in my presence but no rounds were found. (Please see a me at his palace in Doha and in the presence of his son Hamad and Salih al Mana f again discussed the question of food rationing. He told me that he still maintains his previous objection to our proposed scheme and would not agree to it in any circumstances. Later he asked me to covey to you Qatar separate report on this subject) | &gt; In the afternoon of 20.12.44 the Shaikh sent forthe following message:- n The Political Agent has expressed his desire through ; 1 TB. Say id Abdur Razzaq. for me to withdraw my garrisojn from J Zubara Port. To fall in with the P.A f s wishes, I may agree to do so, but if the fort remains vacant, there will be evBry probability of the wooden parts of it being stolen. I shall h grateful for P.A’s advice on this point.” Salih al Mana T told me that he advised the Shaikh to write officially and inform you that he has agreed to the withdrawal of the garrison as a sign of his good intention and co-oneration but he refused to do so as he wants to see the outcome of the proposed food rationing scheme. Next day shaikh Hamad visited me at Salih al Nana's house and asked me to convey to you the following message:- 'Please tell the P.A. that the people who report againi me and accuse me of encouraging smuggling and dealing in slai are all self-interested persons and do so because T do not U them any chance to do smuggling business in Qatar.

I arrived at Doha on 17th December shortly after sunset and went to see the Shaikh next morning at his camp at Umm-ai- Baqar, 10 miles from Doha. I was accompanied by Salih al ManiJ After the usual courtesy talk, I handed over your letter. ■* 3 regarding food rationing to him. He read it carefully and then passed it to his son Hamad who read it too. Then the Shaikh said that he would not agree at ail to a representative or a merchant being sent for food rationing even if he is permitted to appoint a controller to co-operate with them. He added that should he agree to this he would be showing tne public that he was a thief and that the Government had made this arrangement in order to check him up and that he is a child and cannot manage his own affairs. I pointed out to him that his appointing a controller will dispel the inference that food rationing has been taken away from his hands and will prevent to a great extent his losing face. He said, ”1 persist in refusing a representative or a m ,rchant whoever they may be and the only thing that I can do is that I will allow a Govern ment representative to have access to my. records ox f od ration- ing and willfurnlsh monthly statements showing what has been expended.' Then he said, 'X cannot accept a Government repre sent, tive for this type of work and that the appointment of a Government representative is to be preceded by negotiations and j my consent obtained first'. I said to him that I have been instructed by the political Agent to inform him that should he decide to accept our proposed arrangements, h.e (the political Agent) considers Salih Al Nani' would be a suitable person to fill the appointment of a controller for rationing on his behalf. He replied that his Controller will vanish into the Government's representative and that however great may be the influence of* his controller It will not help much in retaining his prestige.^ Shaikh Hamad who was also taking part in these conversations showed strong objection and was corroborating his father's2 . statements I spent about two hours trying to convince the Shaikh in every way possible but he showed complete unwillingness to accept the proposed arrangements. In the end I told him that if he does not agree to this course, I am instructed to inform him that there will be no alternative but to stop the quotas. He said, “I do not mind stopping the quotas. My people do not agree to a representative or a merchant being sent here but should they agree I will prefer to abdicate. If the quota is stopped, the people will live on dates and fish but they cannot do so for a long tline 5 they will eventually have to leave the country. I would agree to this taking place rather than accq? t a representative or a merchant.' The Shaikh may be referring to what he believes would be the case in saying that this will put him down in the eyes of the public but Shaikh Hamad^s great concern is the large income which he derives from the handling of the quotas which he will automatically cease to get should he accept the arrangement. During the conversation, Shaikh Hamad said, 'The Political Agent wrote to my father that I encourage smuggling. This can- not be proved against me. Reports by self-interested persons should not be accepted as such pepple's object is to benefit themselves by harming others'. Here I took out Political Agent Kuwait *s telegram regarding Muhammad Din Kalla and reaa it toth&amp;m Hamad surprisingly said, 'the five bales of cloth are the remained of 66 bales originally owned by Marzuq al Shamlan Kuwaiti and Muhammad bin Abdul Latif al Mani* and smuggled by them from Kuwait to Qatar and when they found the prices were low in Qatar they re-shipped them to Kuwait by the boat of Muhammad Kalla. I got a written undertaking from Marzuq al Shamlan to this effect (He showed it to me). As regards the sugar and tea, he said he had permitted their export on barter basis and alleged that they were not quota goods but were out of the goods bhat arrive at Qatar by smuggling from the neighbouring countries such as Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Hasa. He further said that he3 V f IV - allows the entry of goods smuggled from other places in order to use them for re-export in return for livestock, firewood, &amp;c., imported, from Iran. The Shaikh himself did not say anything as he seemed d|uite ignorant of Hamad f s activities in this line. Salih al Mam T told, me that Shaikh Hamad’s explanation is untrue and ha can’t see how he expects the Government to believe such an excuse, rhile discussing this subject, I have noticed that Shaikh Hamad was doing his best to show that Bahrain is the centre for XKOh smuggling and not Qatar. He particularly mention more than once that smugglers 1 boats stop at Fasht farada in Bahrain and transfer the smuggled goods to other boats. He also said that most of the Qataris living in Bahrain were sraugglei as they had no ostensible means of living. From what I have seen I can judge that the Shaikh really does not agree to either a representative or a merchant or both. If he is forced to agree, he will not obstruct but will not giv&lt; active co-operation. He will take it as a compulsory act and unjustified interference in his internal affairs. Salih al Mani cold me that if this is left to the Shaikh it can be used as a 'bargain” for any demand which the Government might wish to make on him, one of which is the withdrawal of the guards from Zubara garrison to which he will definitely agree. At this stage I personally cannot foresee how far this statement of Salih will come out true as the Shaikh’s past record is not so encouraging As regards the reaction of the people of Qatar to our proposed scheme, there is general popularity as they hope, in any case, to get their full rations if it comes, into existence. present system of rationing is far from satisfactory* following is the distribution of the sugar quotas- 25 bags - Taken by Shaikh Abdullah 25 ” - Taken by Shaikh Hamad 6 ' Sent to wakra 6 M - Sent to Khor 38 rf - Distributed in Doha lOO bags Each person is given 1 lb. only and some poor people are not given any sugar on the ground that they do not drink tea while Abdullah Darwish is given l-jj- bags, Muhammad bin Othman Dir.ctorof Customs, 1 bag, Nasir Obaidan, Hamad*s Agent in Doha, 1 bag. As regards cloth, each man was given three yards of ETuhaili which are not enough lor a gown. On our arrival they started distributing cloth to the people (out of the last consignment of 50 bales which arrived at Qatar one month ago), as regards cereals, I was told by Jasim Jaidah, brother of Yusuf bin Ahmed Jaiaah who is in charge of the distribution of cereals that they sell wheat at the race of Rs.i6/- a raaund (56 lbs) and wheat mixed with barley at the rate of PvS.12/8/- a maund. While I was there a boat arrived from Bahrain bringing cereals from Bahrain to Qatar. The nakhuda stated that he had jettisoned 100 bags ol wheat on account of rough sea and boisterous weather. The price of wheat was at once raised to Rs.18/- a maund in order to make up the loss. This, of course, caused a large amount of dissatisfaction. The Shaikh has still some thousands of bags of rice and Abdullah Darwish has over a thousand bags. From time to time they sell locally at the rate of Rs. 150—160 a bag and export also, mostly to Saudi Arabia where the price has increased lately, it is said to be Ik.200 a bag. , I have observed that Abdullah Darwish has a fairly con siderable amount of control over rationing and still exerci&amp;es influence on Shaikh Hamad. P.H*s ban on his and his brothers* movements had a saiucary effect on him and has put him in a precarious state of mind. He came to my place and requested me in a rather imploring manner, to inform you that he is quite innocent of what has been attributed to him and that he is quite prepared to help the Government in any manner they liker Both Shaikh Hamad and Abdullah Darwish suspect Muhammad Al Mani* and Husain Namah of reporting against them to the political Agent and they have gloomy forebodings for the latter. Shaikh Abdullah no more takes any interest in the local affairs and has left everything in the hands of his son Hamad who visits the town almost daily and looks after things. The first thing that he does is that he enquires about prices of commodities in Qatar and abroad and what goods have been imported5 ( ; OL It is said that he keeps his father's seal with him and uses it whenever he likes without his father's knowledge. It is also said that when Abdullah Darwish was in Dubai arranging for the shipment of Qatar quotas, he used to be in possession of blank ^atar manifests which he used to fill in when shipping the goods to the destinations other than Qatar. In the afternoon of the 20th December 1944 the Shaikh sent for me at his palace in Doha and in the presence of his son Hamad and Salih al M na* again discussed the question of food rationing. He tol'd me that he still maintains his previous objection to our proposed scheme and would not agr e to it in any circumstances. Later he asked me to convey to you the following message;- 'The Political Agent has expressed his desire through Khan Bahadur Saiyid Abdur Razzak for me to withdraw my garrison from Zubara fort. To fall in with the Political Agent's wishes, I may agree to do so, but if the fort remains vacant, there will be every probability of the wooden parts of it being stolen. I, shall be grateful for the political Agent's advice on this point.' Salih al Mana» told me that he advised the Shaikh to write officially and inform you that he has agreed to the . . i withdrawal of the garrison as a sign of his good intention and co-operatioh but he refused to do so as he wanto •to see the outcome of the proposed rationing scheme. Next day (21-12-44) Shaikh Hamad visited'me at Salih al Man's house and asked me to convey to you the following message:- ..please tell the political Agent that the people who report against me and accuse me of encouraging smuggling and dealing in slaves are all self-interested persons and do so because X do not leave them any chance to do smuggling busme-s inQatar. I caught Haji MUIidnunad al Mana 1 smuggliii^ twlcs^ once by sea and another time by land, but being a respectable old man I did not take any punitive action against him.

It seems that your letter to his father in which you said that he encouraged smuggling had a good effecc and br ughfc him to his senses. I was told that on the day of our arrival at Doha, Nakhuda Ahmad bin Abdur Rahman Kuwaiti sailed from Doha with a consigh- ment of sugar. (I was not given the number of bags). A Qatari named Mubarak bin Hitmi had taken rice and 30 bags of sugar from Qatar. He sold the rice at Qatif and heard on Ills way to Kuwait, where he intended to sell the sugar, of the fa be of Muhammad bin Kalla there returned to Qatar on the lt?th December and landed the sugar.\Jv f n ,v ' Telegram S(Pad).

I fully appreciate all Your Honour’s observations which I attribute to a sublime aim and a noble object which are due to your magnanimity and humanity. This has led me to write this letter to you explaining my attitude towards this matter. I was really astonished when the Political Agent. Bahrain, informed me that you think there is a misuse of trie quota in question. As I am fully confident of your and the Political Agent's good intentions 1 attributed that to false reports by self-interested persons who lack good conscience. All wmt has been reported to you and to the Political Agent is untrue. All the quota issued to ^atar is distributed in Qatar itself, in its villages and dependencies, amongst its population and residents, according to the quantity. Its distribution is carried out in.a fair and comfortuble manner suitable and convenient to the condition of the country, its arrangement* and position. To one complains of any prejudice or unfairness but all the people and subjects are satisfied and are well supplied with rations. I will not be exaggerating if I say that it surpasses other* from the point of the ease which the subjects enjoy and tne non-existence of any troublesome and arduous matters. God knows that I do not handle the quota for my own Interest or the interest of any other person but I distribute it amongst the people taking into consideration the quantities that arrive and the varying numbers of people. As regards smuggling to which you refer, I swear that I never concur or relax in such matters but I combat them as far as I can. You are aware of the condition of smuggling in all parts of the world. Smuggler* arc ? «any and it is the duty of the governments to combat them. Is it appropriate of me to concur in tills matter while knowing that I have a duty and that the interests of my country and my subjects require that I should 'reserve feeding matters. I feel sure that you and the Political Agent know of my uonesty; this honesty teaches me tnat my country's interests and my restige are more important to me than anything else. I as ure you that all what has been reported against me to you and the Political Agent is false. I would be glad if Your Honour and the Political Agent will onvaire into this as I challenge everyone to prove reports he hud given you such as what you have mentioned, otherwise it is the facts 'which should be relied upon. accusations md false reports should not be accepted. Nevertheless, I believe that you and the Political Agent do not rely on false reports. I beg to request you to look into the matter according to justice and humanity with a view to discovering facts. This is what I hope you will do for conserving the prestige of a friend of yours and a true friend of the High British Government. Your Honour*. I have observed the Political Agent, Bahrain, referring to some of my subjects who had left the country for earning a livelihood or for finding work, and mentioning that it is due to their not getting rations. I believe a report in that sense was given to him otherwise this state of affairs prevails everywhere. 2 have to explain to you as I had already pointed out to him that most of those who had left the country were poor people. In the past they used to work with the Oil Company but when the Company stopped their operations they were compelled to find a living. They went to places where Companies exists they work there but they have their families at t atar. They sup ort themselves and q ' \ I ■ Vy.‘ ; H n mm ■■,- 2 - \n$J sV n ' __ (’ 43 ) their families with what they earn. There is a vast field of work for those who exert themselves and it is my duty to help such people and facilitate means of living for them.* Suppose other people left the country for trading, they as well as’ those are like the other communities* There are in Bahrain various types of persons from many classes such as labourers, traders etc. who had left their country and settled in Bahrain with their families in order to work and earn a living. Gan it be said that all the foreign communities who are in Bahrain left their countries because they could not get rations. 0* Political Resident, you will realize that this cannot be taken as an example or proof. 1 trust that this is very clear to you and to him. It remained for me to explain to you the present condition of the country and the difficulties it experiences on account of the non-existence of many essential things. These things used to come in the past from the Iranian side and elsewhere but they have now stopped on account of Mubadaiah. The importers of these commodities started taking them to places where Mubadaiah exists. As we have no Mubadaiah allotment now as others have in the neighbouring countries, we are consequently facing many hardships on account of non-existence of commodities. Business here has been limited and merchants' activities have come to a standstill which has caused harm to the interests of both the country and the government. I,. therefore, request Your Honour to pay attention to this matter and fix a Mubadaiah allotment for us like others so that I may get rid of these difficulties for which I shall be grateful to you. I also draw your attention to the present food supply. It Is now four months that I have not deceived any sugar or tea. The people are experiencing difficulties in not getting quota sugar. I request you to look into this according to humanity and consider my condition and that of my country and people. Piecegoods that arrive according to the quota are insufficient comparing them with the country and the people. They are not the full quota piecegoods. I request you kindly to look into this. Here I wish to explain to Your Honour my objection to the question of a representative for rationing about which I had a discussion with the Political Agent. I swear by God that my objection is not due to anything except that it will be said that another person has been sent because I am dishonest. I said to him that^had that been from the beginning, the matter would have been easy but now my excuse is that I want to conserve my prestige and name and to prevent talks of my dishonesty. Sending another person means there exists suspicion in my honesty. This is what led me to refuse the person to whom he (The Political Agent) had referred. I hope that you will find my excuse clear and appreciate my attitude towards this. As regards the food supplies that will ba sent, I will deal with it according to the s stera which you consider suitable and will follow the arrangements which you desire. If you want me to supply you with statements showing receipts of supplies and tneir distrioution I shall be prepared to do so and shall follow in handling the quota any system that you desire. I have explained to you all what is necessary and pointed out to you my reasons for not accepting a representative for rationing. X feel sure that you will have mercy on me and have consideration for aiy prestige for which I shall be grateful to y° u * I request you to help me and give me the usual co-operation as on all occasions for which I shall remain highly grateful to you* Usual EndingTranslation of letter dated 18th Safar 1364 (1st February 1946) from Shaikh Abdullah bin Qasim al Thani, C.I.JS. , Ruler of Qatar to the Hon’ble Sir Geoffrey Prior, Political Residents in the Persian Gulf.

Reference your-letter Ko.C/19?, dated 6th February 1945 (23rd Safar 1364). I have made careful investigation about the report made to yo\i to the effect that Sultan Abel purchased arms from' Abdulla barwish. -I enquired from the latter about the allegation attributed.to him of selling arms to Sultan Abel and he was surprised by this information 1 and he regards the accusation as a great one confirming to me that this report made to you about him is untrue and false. At the same he has asked me to request you to make the necessary investigation with the informant about his report to you. From my investigations I have learnt- that Sultan Abel left Qatar on 13th'Muharram 13.64 and not 28th Muharram as reported by the informant to you. At the time of his departure his boat was inspected and nothing was found in it which he took from qatar - whether ^rms or anything else. But on his arrival at Qatar two old rifles - one single-shot and one shot gun - were found' in his boat which he claims to be&gt; arms for his boat for emergencies, and which were deposited in tne -ms oms Dei -. t according to the usual practice. These were delivered to him at the | time of^ departure as usual. Nothing else was found with him by the Inspectors. I draw your attention to the iepious tesult of these untrue reports and request you to.take the measures to revea^ the truth for the right to appear and the false to vanish. I am v.onf-ideutj that you do not listen to false, reports against innocent people by which the informant wants to put them (into trouble;. - il therefore be glad if you will make'a careful enquiry at dalah or at any other place you wish about these allegations, &lt;-■=••• j -* ixo1 '’ an ^ to be asked to prove his report to you or e-se he will charged for making false reports, so that no one will venture to fabricate things, which have not happened. Abdulla Darwish,from whom the informant has alleged that arms were purchased?persists and requests the investigation in the report made against him, as he wants to file • a case against the informant.regarding the allegation to be innocent. I see that justice, right, humanity and honour require from the informant to prove it otherwise he deserves punishment for hisreports. As regards your statement about the sugar, Sultan Abel had only five rnaunds of sugar sold to him as Mobadelah for his sheep. About Aalad Mohammed Bilal, v;hon you have reported, arrived from Kuwait and proceeded with him. But he.did not take sugar or anything else from tatar. This is the result of the investigateons which I have made in*this respect, and which is for your information. V \ / U.E, P.S. As regards Mohammed bin Darwish, he is not present now. But on his return I will.make enquiries from him with regards to what you have said. • I like to draw your attention to the matter of sugar. For the last five months Qatar has not got any sugar from the quota. If oultan had sugar, possibly from another place, which fact I like to being to your notice. - •A - * In i II&amp; ..r y\ CONFIDr iT_IAL Political Agency, NO. C/ 305. Bahrain, lst March 1945.

Reference to previous correspondences Residency telegram Ho. 169 dated 23rd ^fanuary 1946 and Bahrain Agency telegram No.69 dated 31st January 1945. Number and date of enclosure Note on a vifcit to Qatar by the : Political Agent, dated 27-2-1945. sisr) UATAR X left Bahrain accompanied by two clerics Jassim bin Mohamed and All Al Tajir both well qualified to assist in the examination of any ration accounts that the Qatar adminis tration might be keeping. By courtesy of the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf and the Naval Offleer-in-Charge, Bahrain, my party and I were accommodated in E.M.S. ,, Neyrcu'. H.M.S, 'Neyrou' is a small tug of approximately four hundred tons burden built in 1934 in Italy and acquired from Persia at the time of the occupation of that country in 1941. 2* The first hours of the voyage were uneventful but late i in the afternoon an extremely strong north wind started to blow and by midnight conditions were chaotic. My staff and some members of the crew were sea-sick, the deck of the vessel was awash, and the movement combined vdth the noise of the waves hitting the heeding round the side of the tug made sleep quite impossible. Jtast before daylight on the 28th January 1945 we arrived off Doha and anchored until it was sufficiently light for the captain to see his way in to the inner anchorage. We entered at about 7 a.m. and anchored half an hour later. A launch which had put off from the town slowly progressed towards us revealing the presence of haikh H&lt;*mad bin Abdullah bin Qasim the heir-apparent of Qatar and various notables from • the town seated on the deck at the stern of the vessel. Ov^ing to the weather conditions I considered that honour had been satisfied by Shaikh Hamad * s appearance on the launch and waved to him not to attempt to board the tug. I disembarked with my staff and luggage with some difficulty and after I was seated next to Shaikh Hamad the launch proceeded towards the shore. The engine failed to work on four separate occasions and chere were quite exciting moments on one of them as we were blown towards a sraall reef lying about a mile off snore. However /thethe engine decided to function in time and we eventually docked just a few yards from the house of Salih bin Mana a merchant of some standing in the town* 3. Shaikh Hamad stated that his father had not arrived X' expected that I would arrive in such ^ stormy weather, but that on H*M*3* 'Neyrou” being sighted a message had been sent to che old gentleman and it was hoped that he would arrive very soon. I told Shaikh Hamad that I had been supply distribution organization which he and his father alleged was in operation. Shaikh Hamad immediately admitted / that they had no organization which was' at all satisfactory and that ration cards, except in the form of scraps of paper torn from the backs of letters which were used for the sugar ration, did not exist. I understood from him that anyone who went to the 'Officer-in-Charge' of grain supplies was given whatever quantity of grain he required and that he was charged Ss*13/- per Qatar maund (56 lbs) of wheat. I stated at Ryan from his desert camp as he had not for one moment instructed to visit ^Qatar to examine the rationing system andHe said however that as I had come down to examine thei,r system would I please remain and tell them what was wrong and how to put the matter right and that they would make any alterations that I considered necessary and adopt any inno vation which I desired. I regretted my inability to remain in Qatar as 'Food Controller' and explained that I had received instructions only to examine the system which they had stated was in being. Our conversations were disturbed by the announcement that lunch was ready and His Excellency who will allow no work however important to interfere between him and sustenance immediately suggested that we should adjourn our business until after lunch. After lunch as I had suspected His Excellency asked permission to retire in order to say his prayers and indicated that unless I had any more business of importance he proposed to return to his encampment to the South. by I then returned to Dohajsayself. 4. Immediately on arrival at Doha I proceeded to the Customs accompanied by Salih bin Mana and my two assistants. The official in charge endeavoured unsuccessfully to persuade us to believe that two hundred bags of wheat lying in the open were all the food supplies l?ft in Qatar. It did not take us many minutes to discover a further unofficial reserve of four hundred bags of wheat and approximately two hundred bags of rice. After much persuasion on our part, and many denials on the part of the rationing authority that any accounts were kept, the books were produced and I was interested to note that Rs.l6/~ &amp; Qatar maund for wheat was being charged and not Rs. 13/- as Shaikh Hamad had himself told me shortly before. The examination of the stocks of grain displayed for sale in the shops in the town indicated that non-ration wheat was on sale for as much as Rs. 21/- a maund and the grain ration shop hich was controlled by a satelite of Shaikh Hamad himself appeared, to charge approximately Rs.17/- a maund for wheat. /Piecegoods/5. : (&lt;&amp;) \ 4. Piecegoods were distributed by only one individual who maintained a book purporting to show the population of Doha, the desert, and of all the villages of Qatar, This volume made no mention of children, merely dividing human beings into male and female and it was fairly obvious that the majority of t;he estimates of family members were grossly exaggerated. Apparently no effort was made to ascertain whether any parti cular individual was speaking the truth when he said that he was responsible for twenty five or so members of his family, experience has been that if the number given originally is twenty five on examination it will be found that there are not more than fifteen persons who, can be produced, the rest being )^by way of an to ensure that the rations received by the fifteen are ample for their requirements. No piecegoods were in stock and it seemed to rest entirely with the gentleman in cilarge exactly what quantity of goods individuals were allotted. This delegation of authority was no doubt very profitable to the '’Piecegoods Controller' for so I presume he muse be designated. Ration sugar was on sale at three different shops and it X was once again only after considerable argument that the books and ration tickets were produced for my inspection. These shops sold sugar only to those persons who produced pieces of paper signed, by Obaidan and Abdur Rahman bin Darwish certifying that they were entitled to sugar and giving the quantities which were to be sold to them. Obaidan is one of Shaikh Hamad*s personal employees and Abdur Rahman bin Darwish is a younger brother of the notorious smuggler Abdullah bin Darv^ish who is Shaikh Hamad*s righthand man. It was interesting to note that some people were permitted a quarter of a pound of sugar a month and others v.ere permitted four pounds of sugar for the same period. It does not require very much imagination or knowledge of the East to under stand the means that had to be employed to obtain a reasonable ration of sugar.5 5. La cer the same afternoon I went for a walk through the to^ with a view to examining reports that I had received to the effect that most of the houses were empty* As I left Salih bin Mana 1 s house two negro servitors of shaikh Hamad each carrying a rifle and dagger fell in on either side of me while my personal servant, who trusts not the Qatari, took up a strategic position in rear. In this maimer we proceeded through the narrow streets of the town and eventually debouched, somewhat to my surprise, on to the main cemetry. It occurred to me that if my colleague Mr. Parker T* Hart of the American Consulate at Lhahran had been present he might heve mistaken what was inlkct a courteous gesture on the part of Shaikh Hamad for a somewhat closer interest in our future than would be welcome* as the result of my walk I came to the conclusion that it was perfectly true that a very large number of the inhabitants of Doha had left and from journeys which I have made by air I am convinced that the population of the villages is very much less than it used to be. 6 * Thcj following morning I decided to depart as early as* possible and was at my own. desire visited by Shaikh Hamad at approximately 3 o^lock. He stated that he trusted that I had found matters in good order and was satisfied with the arrangements in force* It must be confesseo that his tone did not indicate that he had much confidence of hearing of my satisfaction* I informed him that it was my duty to say that his employees were deceiving him grossly, that they v/ere overcharging for grain, that they were failing to check popu lation figures, and that the so called rationing system for sugar was nothing more or less than a profitable for Obaidan and the Darwish brothers* Shaikh Hamad not unnaturally expressed no surprise, being of course fully aware of the posi tion and the principal share-holder in profits derived from the aforesaid &lt;paft, but promised reformation and asked what measures they should institute. Further conversation appeared to be unprofitable and so indicating that there was no needfor him to make another trip in the launch to H.M.S.'Neyrou M I took leave of him and left Doha for, I trust, the last time for some time to come. 7. The journey hack to Bahrain was not without incidents hut they were most of them of a domestic nature, and were caused by the high seas running and^yery strong north wind. /c The funnel of the tug was already covered with/salt of dried spray from the night before hut very shortly after clearing Doha everything was once again thoroughly wet. The movement became sc violent that it was not possible to remain upright without hanging on with both hands. The smell of new paint, frying ghee, and the noise of my clerks* agony did not add to the enjoyment of the rather confined cabin space in which I was forced to remain. Our misery was prolonged by three hours as we received instructions from the Naval Officer-in- Charge to discover if the light vessel had shifted its position as a result of the stormy weather. We found the light vessel had not shifted its position. The voyage w^s over on our arrival at JUffair Naval Base at a quarter before midnight on a particularly cold and unpleasant night. 26th February 1946Telegram Q From Political Resident at Bahrain HConsul, Bandar Abbas, To Repeated H.k.

(26-3-45) the r- A. G. 0 lour Honour, with great respect and my appreciation for your opinions and observations I would like to draw your attei tion to the true facts ox the case which if you examine them closely and assess them correctly according to the present circumstances and conditions relevant thereto and ambguities concerning the present state of affairs the true facts will * 'become clear to Your Honour arid the statements will vanish. j •«e believe that the power of right is greater than the appearances created by statements firm and unshakable and mere rumours * cannot remove anything of which there is no shadow of doubt. Because I am confident of Your Honour's nobility and high mindedness and sense of justice I wrote to Your Honour explaining the truth of the present circumstances in my last letter. God knovs that I am absolutely honest in what I explained to Your Honour and was very surprised when your letter arrived bearing No.c/186 dated the 15th March, 1945 corresponding to the 1st. of Habi al Than!, 1364 in which you said '^atar has acquired a very bad reputation for smuggling and illegal activities in quota goods' and I am at a loss to understand how Your Honour has accepted such a statement as a statement of fact and issued orders as you have because I have, explained everything to Your Honour in my last le-tter and clarified everything necessary in this respect. It appears to me from Your Honour's letter that the idea * has become firmly fixed in your mind and this is what is incumbent upon me and which I consider aosolutely essential to defend myself. I therefore request lour Honour to taxe charge of the investigation and enquiries' and examine the in its true'aspect• I iiant to know what quota goods were wrongfully dealt with as' you pointed out. I am very hurt by trie imputations to my fame which have become' firmly fixed in xour Honour s mind and I challenge everyone spreading rumours about me regarding\ unlawful delaings - rumours which hurt my honesty and honour. I challenge them to prove t what they say by producing concrete- 2 - O' o proof. Otherwise it will become clear to Your Honour that everything circulated about me is untrue. I believe that Your Honour’s, nobility and high position will forbid you to rely on sayings without foundation and not supported by facts and I would ask Your Honour to demand from those circulating rumours to prove them otherwise you will come to find out that all you mention is far a T . ay from the truth. As far as the smuggling of goods which Your Honour has mentioned I do not know to which smuggling you are referring. As if there were no smuggling in the world except from Qatari There is of course a great deal of smuggling indulged in by all countries like India, Persia, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Muscat and Africa and from which many goods are exported to all countries in the Gulf and elsewhere. It has not given-a bad reputation to those countries which are exporting them, yet Qatar' being a weak country and not having her own products or'an extensive trade, the smugglers find scope in which to carry on their trade which has given her the bad reputation of smuggling. Indeed this is a strange thing, but what is being said about those countries -which I have mentioned ? Hor, if it is permitted to them under present circumstances, and conditions to indulge in smuggling - .countries whose .governments are wide awake (to such practices) and who have a detailed organization to check them, then how can it be supposed that Qatpr which is a weak country and very small compared with the others, should not have smugglers? Hoes not what we have supposed and outlined deserve Your Honour’s just and fair consideration? In Your letter Your - Honour says ”If there is nothing to conceal you would have not objected to the supervision”. I had formally explained to Your Honour the reasons which led me to that (decision) ana I had thought that Your Honour would 'appreciate the position which I ■ explained to Your Honour in this connection. What am I expected to do if Your Honour pays ho attention to my explanations? I uo not object to supervision initiated by Your honour in Bahrain or in any other place where there is no scandal rnongering. I told ' Your Honour that any form of arrangement which you suggest andand which would satii'y Your Honour -- an arrangement by which the quota would be divided fairly but the despatch of a representative for it would mean to the world that there is some doubt of my one which impures my prestige and. it is this which has led me to oppose you in this premature matter. Your comparison of Persia, Iraq and dgypt is not applicable to us because the position there is very different from ours. The position in Kuwait, Bahrain and Kuscat is also ve y different from ours. And ej£g» were my position the same as theirs then the matter would levzt be as you describe it. But Your Honour knows that it is not so and if a representative was sent to me in the last few days of the war it would imply i • that I have been remiss and misappropriated the quota. This is the reason and cause of my opposition. ‘ I have already explained to Your Honour the postition from this aspect. I still believe that Your Honour will appreciate my position rightly and excuse me for keeping an eye on my position and guarding my honesty as a true friend of the British Government and of Your Honour especially. Your Honour asked me when I told you about the non-arrival of the quota sugar and tea for several months how was Abdulla Darwish was able to export 192 bags of tea. I am aware that Your Honour Is not Inf or me &lt; of the true facts of the case because the things referred to did not belong to Qatar and that the Kuwaiti merchants imported in a Kuwait ship whose nakhuda was Ghuloom Husain in the lirst half of Muharram 1364. There .was no manifest with the goods to show the 'destination and the owner 'deposited them in the harbour godowns in * * charge of Abdulla Darwish. He then received instructions irom one owner to export it in the boom 'Motairan' whose nakhuda was to this end in the last stages of the present condition which call honesty. And Your Honour knows that I prefer any. arrangement to Mohammed bin Jasim Bushmais so its import to Qatar and expoit ix-4- and wounds my (really) feelings and in it you have mentioned that I wanted jsou to send supplies for my son and for the merchants to profit and I do not understand how Your Honour has got hold of such a story. Such an accusation is harmful to me. You are a noble and upright man known for your good morals and clear intuition and it is this personality which has become unique for these excellences. I would not wish that a statement so far removed from the truth should issue, or an unfounded accusation be made. I have decided that Your Honour has come to this conclusion from listening to the sayings and accusations which have been imputed to me without justification or supporting . *• ** reasons. I complain but to God on whom I rely. He is my guardian and rescuer and in toch case I depend upon him. And Your Honour knows that I am one of those people who appreciate the boldness of those men who risked their lives to provide foodstuffs for these parts and to make things easier for them. And I count that as one of the greatest of favours and aids which olir Ally and friend Great Britain has undertaken. How O'Your Honour do you imagine that I wish to do all this for the profit of my son and the merchants as you have referred to, but what shall 'I do? . I had demanded proof and investigations in each letter that I have written on the subject. It is sufficient j.or me that I iely on God and then on the nobility of your spirit as a noble English gentleman. My son is above anything that is imputed to him and has too much self respect. He challenges -anyone who attributes such accusations to him that he should explain them, otherwise it is only the truth on which he relies, tour Honour says that you had discovered what is going on in Qatar, therefore by .God it is up to you O’Your Honour to explain to me what you have .discovered. I say that the position in Qatar is better position in-vrf^^ 1 ^ than the position in other countries, and as the poor people get their rations the position thereiore is better than elsewhere. Then you say Your Honour that if you receive more complaints there is no recourse but to stop the quota altogether. I welcome any complaint like this ana I am prepared to meet it and refute it and if Your Honour imagines-5- (£2 it that if there are any complaints then there is no reason to f hide them and the truth will come out eventually. This is what had to be explained to Your Honour hoping that you will give attention to it’by ‘taking just steps to settle it as is Your Honour’s custom. I 'hope Your Honour will bring the truth to light and co-operate your friend in what he has requested. U.E.HONFIDENTIAL .

I was given to understand that the Shaikh and his son are most anxious that the matter should be cleared up and they hoped that it might be in order for the Company to inquire from you when the ban is likely to be removed on the grounds that the Darwishes cannot function fully as our agents without access to Bahrain, Dubai, etc. I ln making this approach to you there is no question of any attempt to raise the point that the Company 1 s interests are in any way affected. You will understand however, that it helps our relations with the Ruler if we are frieixily and co-operative and in this light I hope you will appreciate our desire to be in a position to be able to state that we have written to you.

Memorandum In ampli dated the Sth May 1945. cation of my telegram No. 90/65 2. I instituted enquiries through a reliable agent who visited Charak and Qais Island towards the end of Larch 1945. He unfortunately could not contact his informants in these places as they had in the meantime left foi* the Trucial Coast. 3. - A most unreliable report which reached me about the middle of February last said that about 25 rifles ^ and some ammunition had been landed at Qais - probably American or British from Khorramshahr. As no definite details were forthcoming and it was difficult to pursue the matter from here nothing further was done until I had the opportunity of visiting Qais Island -- vide this Agency memorandum No. 62-25/1 dated the £th March 1945. 4 . As I could not visit Charak myself I sent Aqai Baderi on the 24th April 1945. He reported that Sultan Abul, of Qatar, left for Sharjah, where he purchased rifles and ammunition from one Rashis Lana, of Hira, and sailed xor the Silas ports (Shiyu to Kangan). Owing to a storm he was forced to put in at Qais on about the l^th January 1^' ^• When the weather moderated he left for Shiyu, Tibin, Kaluteh, Khuvadan and Haleh at which ports he is. alleged to have disposed of the consignment. He added that there are four persons engaged in arms smuggling, namely:- , , , (1) Sultan Abul, of Qatar. He own^a jolly boat and appears to be very active: , , , , ^ Mohammed Darwish, of the Batinah, brought np at Kushkunar (under Gabandi) but at present resident of Qatar.

I am reliably informed that the Qashgai are the chief purchasers and come down in winter to Shiyu. The Ishkanan are also interested but to a lesser degree. Owing to the corruption of the Customs officials (and now the Gendarmerie at Bandar I ughara) along the coast it is almost impossible to obtain any information. It is said that arms and ammunition are also disposed of by these men north west of Bushire (along the coast). 7 # In this connection it may be pointed out that the crews of Arab countrycraft carry arms and ammunition ostensibly for the purpose of self-defence against raiders along the Persian and/or Arab coast. It is difficult for the Persian officials to keep a check on this as the nakhodas do not carry any documents to cover such weapons which can be easily disposed of. A case in point arose in Lingah a few months ago. It was reported to me that a boat from Dubai had a couple of rifles on obard and the Consular Agent informed the Director of Customs personally, and requested the latter to have a search made. This was done and the weapons were traced. The Consular Agent requested the Director of Customs to force the nakhoda to obtain a permit from his Ruler or Customs officials on the production of which the arms could , be returned. . This was accordingly done. It is therefore 1 suggested, if there is no objection, that the Rulers of the Arab Rates be requested to instruct th ; eir subjects that I in case they are forced to ©rry arms in se-defence thej : must obtain permits which should be produced -.o rersian i Customs or other officials. Even this procedure will not, in my humble opinion, prevent the traffic owing to the long coast line and lack of supervision unless the Hulers enforce the return of the permits with the arms e„c., which coul be stored until they set out again. A registration system may check the smuggling to a certain degree. 3d/- D Stephens. British Consular Agent, Lingah.

I have seen the enclosure and noted its contents, I appreciate your kind attention. God knows that this party has made a great fabricated lie and what they said is false. All what t they have said is incorrect and has no shade of truth. O’Your Excellency, it is sorrowful that a party enjoying my favour, kindness and support, venture and make this excitement, and they deny my favour Andtgood help to them during all these years, and fabricate lies, which, no one in the past; possessing humanity and clean heart, ventures to make. This question, if it is sorrowful. to me, but still it does not surprise me, because as it is said '•Habit known about Akhzam'. Nearly more than seven years ago ae happened matter' same as it is noW, some others were induced by those,who had intentions to fish in the muddy water, and they had no other purpose except to make dissension and excitement. I probably tnink that these person have been induced.by those who have intentions beleiving that I will be affected by such claims and fabrications. O' Your Excellency, the wrong has no true faith hut the rj.gh^ has an authority. Our desire is right and good intention, from which we inspire our works. God knows the intentions and he is the supporter of right from which we get our help and assistance for all our works and intentions. To inform you of the fabrications and bad intentions of these persons, I assure you that I have been helping them as much as I can afford as in the case of the rest of their brothers and their relatives. All these years I have been doing my part towards them as much as.I can. Besides the assistances I have been affording them, and make them in line with the others (brothers), I lend them money for pearling trade as it is in the case of the members of the family. They have not refunded any amount which I lent them, but they swallowed. Despite that I have been helping them and supply them with loans loans they swallowed. I have not withhelday support to them. They have denied my favour and forgot all that a t a tine when their intention has become bad and they inclined to those who have purposes to whose propaganda they listened. !.cnv I have known what I have known from these person, and I do not feel in rest, nor could I, in any way, settle or allow them anything which will affect my affairs or harm my interests, because I smell from them the spirit of ill-intention and treason.
