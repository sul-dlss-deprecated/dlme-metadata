Kennion, LA., His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla- 1 have the honour to request a reference to the printed correspondence on the subiect of the arms traffic which was forwarded to me under your endorse ment No. 1503-F.A., dated 1st May 1907. 2. In his letter No. 4, dated 8th February 1907, Lieutenant Ogilvie writes as follows « jji mv informants were unanimous in declaring that the smugglers, bavin' loaded up their rifles at various obscure fishing hamlets on the° coast move as quickly as possible north and pass about 40 miles east of Bampur, i.e., between Gazak and Kuchagardan. They then enter the Pasht-i-Thahf which lies between the Koh-i- Bazman and the Siahband Range and striking the Seistan track at Shoraf move along in due north past the Koh-i-Taftan, finally crossing the border at some place in Seistan. They go neither by Regan on the west nor Khwash on the east, as seems to he the general misapprehension.” 3. I have recently made some enquiries as to the routes in Persian terri- fnrv followed by arms caravans north of Bazman. My information^ which I thmk is reliable,^is to the effect that during the preseat year, in addition to the arms caravan captured at Kacha, four caravans have made their way into Afghan territory. The routes taken by these caravans north of Bazman are shown below— (1) A caravan of 150 camels travelled in March by the following route: Bazman, Bansara. Anjira. (Hanjirah.) Ab-i-Rais. (Rez.) Mazar Ab. Gurg. Sboshaki. Nakela. (Nakhilu.) Kal Amas, Ab Khar a. Ab Dozdak. (Dozak.) Chah Mastan. Kuzago. Kaftargo. Butago. Safidawa. (Ispedawa.) Chah JSafar. Bal-i-Kamao. 2 f 0Ta .—Italics signifies that the place is marked on Trans Frotier Survey map. „ T ^ Ha Jj. -&amp;• Chakao. Bash Jawain. road is crossed in Kain borders near the Hauz. ^mmmm (2), (3) The caravans which passed by Kaoha in April (one of which was captured), travelled by the following route:— Bazman. Pansara. Shorab, (Shoraf.) Morghak. Padai. Kala-i-Bed. Channali. Dannai. Katar Kanjak. Kharnai. Manzilab. (Manzliaf.) Siah Karai. Ab-i-Ahvan. Kacha. This route is described to me as passing east of Galugan and joinin the route marked in the North-West-Trans-Frontier Survey map at or nea Dukdoh. From Manzilab it goes to Bagh, marked in the map. (4) A caravan of 200 camels received news of the Kacha capture at Bazmanj and being bound for Kandahar, proceeded as under in May Bazman. Birr. Shorab. Deg-i-Shikan. Chah-i-Qabi. Chah-i-Hashi. Kh'xash. Dahan-i-Gazo. Reg-i-Malik* Juzhak. Lut of Zeh. Salu Chah. Chah-i-Azam Khan. Hassan Khan of Khwash is reported to have taken 60 rifles and 5 pistols from this caravan, while Mir Jiand furnished guides, no doubt for a consideration. No. (5) was a caravan of 30 camels for Herat, which travelled with No. 4 as far as Bazman. From here it followed the same route as caravan No. (1) as far as Ab Khara on the Nasratabad-Neh track. From this point it turned Noth. -The Sirdar denies that the caravan took SOUth-east to Turshab apnarentlv with this route at all. He states it passed by Neh and iJpj, n f „ .tA 1 £ j.* ChahDaraz. The route given by me is, I believe, I? 6 ..IL 0t Cros Smg the frontier near torrect. Band-i-Eamal Khan. At Turshab the , “ carayan became aware of the presence of oardar Pasand Khan and his men at Baluch Ab, a very short distance off. (The latter has been accused of complicity in this escape, but the rumour is I believe without foundation) Three -303 cartridges were picked up subsequently at the camp at Turshab, marked on the base — J * C!&lt;3Turned from its line at Turshab, the caravan made north and joined the route followed by No. (1) at Safidawa. 4. The routes mentioned above are typical of two groups of routes leading from the Persian ports towards the two prominent salients of south-West Afghanistan, which have their apices at Koh-i-Malik Siah and Siah Kuh, re spectively. The former group would ordinarily be selected by caravans proceed ing to Kandahar, the latter by caravans for Herat. I am informed that the route via Kacha followed by caravans (2) and (3) and that by Khwash and Zeh followed by No. (4) have not before been adopted, at any rate within recent years, the usual practice being to cross the Afghan Frontier where it is co terminus with Persia There are many variations of the routes given above. To take the Koh-i-Malik Siah salient first. From the neighbourhood of Bazman, caravans may make to cross the Mirjawa range by the Amlaf, Saindak or Piran passes or they can pass by Kobat into British Baluchistan. Keeping more to the Axest they may go by Dumak, Chah Mahomed, Buzgargi, Gorandi, to Baluch Ab. From this point they can make Afghan territory by Godar i- Shahi Mardan. They may also, as another alternative, proceed further north, going by Turshab and Khak, or by Darwaza and Begawak, to Band-i-Kamal Khan. Another set of routes is provided by proceeding to Gurg and Nasrat- abad Ispi or some point near there, and then either going by the direct road to Baluch Ab, or like caravans Nos. (1) and (5; taking the Neh road first and then branching east. The northern salient (Lash Jowainl, which affords the best means of reaching Herat, may similarly be reached by a variety of routes. From the neighbourhood of Baluch Ab a caravan may (a) keep near the Hamun to Baring and then go by Kharika and Chakao, (6) passing by Mukh-i-Surukh and Safidawa, take the route followed by caravan No. (l). They may also go by Medah, Aliabad and Anjireh in Kain. If these roads were blocked, a caravan could also pass still further north by Neh and reach Afghan territory by Chah Daraz, and one or other of the routes south of Duroh. * This group of routes can of course be reached from the Nasratabad side direct or by pro ceeding some stages along the Neh track. 5. The fact is that smuggling caravans have a very large number of routes to select from. Though the country is very inhospitable, well and springs are sufficiently numerous to enable a caravan, if well guided, to pass almost any where from one point to another. 6. In comparing the popularity of the two groups of routes from the smugglers point of view, it evident that the southern salient affords a shorter road to safety—irrespective of the ultimate goal being Kandahar or Herat—than the Lash Jowain line. The routes are, however, more hazardous than those with Lash Jowain as the objective. The latter have the disadvantage of being rougher and there must usually be a difficulty in finding guides. On tl;e whole, it seems reasonable to suppose that after the experiences of the April caravans, smugglers will elect the longer and safer routes through Kain territory. 7. The smuggling season as regards these parts begins in March and ends in July. 8. The problem of preventing the passage of caravans is, under existing conditions, by no means an easy one. The Koh-i-Malik salient has a length of about a hundred miles to be guarded in British territory and about seventy miles in Persia. The Siah Kuh salient has a total length of about seventy miles. Owing to the nature of the country, the maintenance of efficient cordons is almost out of the question. The Political Agent, Chagai, witli the troops at Kobat and his own levies no doubt effectually watch and guard the portion of the frontier which marches with British Baluchistan; but there is no use in shutting one door while others remain open. From the Persians nothing can be hoped. The Persian Government have adequate material at their disposal in the Baluch of Seistan and the Border people of Kain; but \ these being without discipline, without incentive, ill-paid, ill-fed and ill-armed, 3J &gt; r ''TV-' it is useless to look to them for the performance of a task that requires a consi derable amount of organisation as well as patience and pluck. 9. It seems to me that in these circumstances and failing the possibility of effective action being taken in the Persian Gulf, the best way of putting a stop to the traffic would be by means of a joint Indo*Persian force. The objection to a British Indian force crossing the frontier would no longer hold good if a reciprocal arrangement were made by which Persian troops could jointly operate on the Brit'sh side of the frontier. I should judge also that there would be nothing in such a course to offend the patriotic susceptibilities of the Persian Assembly. 10. There is of course the question of Afghan feelings to be considered ; for though the Amir could not legitimifcely complain of our co-operating with Persian to stop illicit arms running, it is possible that he might consider the posting of troops near bis frontier, in Persian territory, to be unfriendly, and so affect his general attitude in other matters. Prom this point of view it would be better if measures could be successfully taken in the Persian Gulf or further away from the Afghan border. But experience in this direction has not been encouraging. 11 . My suggestion therefore is for a joint Indo-Persian preventive force. This should be divided into two detachments, composed of an equal number each of British Indian troops and local Persian sowars, which should act in communication with each other. The Southern detachment should be located at a convenient spot—probably Kacha—in British territory, the northern de tachment at Zainalabad, close to Bandan in Kain. Since operations would extend over a considerable period, the detachments should be no stronger than is necessary. I would recommend the numbers being fixed at eighty rifles each, i.e., forty Indian and forty Persian at each place. The Indian detachments should be under British officers. The detachment should he as mobile as pos sible, mounted on riding camels and equipped so as to he capable of long marches, at a fairly rapid rate. Scouting and patrolling arrangements, on which will depend the success of the measure suggested, would have to he very care fully organised. I am not, however, at present prepared to express an opinion whether local men should be specially entertained for this purpose, or whether it would be preferable to use Chagai levies. A secret service fund at the dis posal of the British Commanders would be essential. Among other measures to obtain timely information, Agents should be kept at Bazman and Khwash to report the arrival and departure of caravans, w T hile Nasratabad Ispi w ould form a convenient station for reporting by telegram the movements of caravans within a convenient radius of this place. 12. I do not enter into further details, as I am not aware whether the pro posal will be favourably received by the Government of India and His Majes ty’s Minister. To me it seems the only way of effectually dealing with an evil which has now assumed serious proportions. A copy of this letter is being sent to His Majesty’s Minister, the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor General, Baluchistan, and to the Political Agent, Chagai. 4 O. C./rass, Simla,—No, C-497 P.

They intended purchasing a lar'e number of these rifles hut hearing that another trader had been apprehended while in the act of importing 400 rifles and taken as a prisoner to Bombay with the rifles, they had to remain content with the 100 rifles, ibis is the way the rifles are introduced on land.

A Nasari named Adam Khan, the latest arrival states that ms caravan had a large number of these rifles which had been puichased a big trader in Bunder Abbas named Ali Khan.

Adam Khan had 20 rifles which he placed on a horse and fled to Herat travelling by the out of way places, the rest of the caravan proceeding to Kandahar, Adam Khan added that he had submitted a repre sentation °to His Majesty, the Amir on the subject and was waiting for a reply.

I am also to enquire if you have any information regard ing the five traders who are said to be missing. The number of arms mentioned by the Amir is of course greatly in excess of those captured, and it is presumed that the difference could hardly be account ed for by the reports mentioned by you that some of the arms were buried. tlie s G^vefnment of C.S.I, Agent to themm f No. 877-Confidential, dated Zlarat, the 2nd September 1907.

To-The Assistant Secretary to the Government of Indiam the Foreign Department^ JulyTw, itaveTh/honour Tteward! go^ ^confU the subject under reference.Two men will have to be engaged at Rs. 12 each per mensem for attend ance throughout the day at the telephones at Jask and Charbar assisted by the line-guards at those stations. 7. As an additional means of gathering information, arrangements could be made with certain local people to give information, for which they would he suitably rewarded if it proved to be of value. Of course, only thoroughly reliable men will be broached in this manner and they will be in every case either friends or relations of men of our line establishment. I think if 40 or 50 rupees per mensem were judiciously spent in rewards and presents it would produce good results. 8. The following is an approximate estimate of the expenditure per mensem for guards, &amp;c : Bs. a. p. One jemadar at Rs 30 per mensem Ten guards at Rs. 25 each per mensem Average monthly expenditure on account of rewards Two tdephone men at Rs. 12 per mensem Monthly allowances of Rs. 5 to six line-?uards of permanent line establishment in charge of telephones ... 30 0 0 ... 250 0 0 .. 40 0 0 24 0 0 the 30 0 0 Total ... 374 0 0 9. The working methods of such a plan of patrols would be ns follows : — After finding out the most likely port, or rather the suspected area, where arms will be landed, three guards will be posted to patrol prescribed districts near the coast, whilst tw r o others will be sent a few miles north of the telegraph line to watch roads from up-country. One guard will be stationed at Jask to carefully watch arrivals by mail steamers from Maskat, and to track any suspicious persons. The jemadar after posting his guards will visit villages in the vicinity to inform his spies where to report information. Telephone stations will be established every 15 miles, or at every line-guards beat in the suspected area, and the jemadar will be supplied with a telephone with which he can cut in at any time. With these facilities I am confident we would be able to receive early intelligence at Jask or Charbar of any suspicious collections of Afghans or Baluchis, and also to determine the arranged port of disembarkation long before the arms arrive. I could personally conduct these operations up to the middle of January after which my work takes me out of the arms area. 10. With reference to Commander E. W. James* letter of the 1st April 1907, paragraph 11, I cannot recommend communication with His Majesty’s Ships from points on the coast. Any signalling operations with large flags would openly proclaim our co-operation with His Majesty’s Ships, and I would beg to submit that such suspicion might endanger the position of the Telegraph Department and its employes along the coast. 11. A nother means of gaining good information which suggests itself is the employment of spies amongst the poorer class of fishermen at Maskat and Mutra, and at villages further to the westward. Arms are exported to other places up the Gulf, but it should not be difficult to distinguish, and observe the departure of a native boat containing up-country Baluchi or Afghan passengers who invariably accompany consignments of arms destined for the Mekran Coast. 12. In conclusion, I would respectfully beg to remark that the chances of His Majesty’s Ships making successful seizure would be just as good if an unobtrusive plan were adopted and reliance placed on the information we are able to give them from the shore of either departures from Maskat or suspected arrivals.4 If seizures can be accomplished, it will be more effective in quickly sup pressing the traffic at a minimum of expense. Whereas, I fear, the presence of many ships p itrolling the coast may have the effect of only deferring operations of the arms runners who are possessed of great patience, and who^ can easily afford to suspend shipments than run deliberate risks of capture.

Sir, Fith reference to the correspondence ending with your letter No. 877, dated the 2 nd September 1907, I an directed to forward for your information, a translation of a letter dated the 11 th September 1907, from the Acir of Afghanistan, complaining of the capture of a caravan of arms at Kacha in May last. I am to say that the Government of India will be glad to receive any remarks which you nay v/ish to offer on the letter generally, and specially with reference to the statement that 9000 Kabuli rupees in cash, and property to the value of 4,160 Kabuli rupees were carried off by those who took part in the seizure of the caravan. 1 an also to enquire if you have any information regarding the five traders who are said to be missing. The number of arms mentioned by the nnir is of course greatly in excess of those captured and it is presumed that the difference could hardly be accounted for by the reports mentioned by you that some of the arms were buried. i have, etc., Sd. b. H. S. Clarke, Deputy Secretary to the Govt, of India.• Amir Habibulla Kbao. Translation of a letter from His Majesty the Amir» of Afghanistan, G.C.B., G.C.M.G., to the address of His Excellency the Viceroy, No. 92, dated the 2nd Shaban 1325 Hijra, corresponding to 11th September 1907. After compliments.— I have received at this moment a P et ^ lon Allahdad. Akhtar Muhammad, Muhammad Ghani, Shahnawaz, Abdulla, Abdul Wahab and Muhammad Hasan, Nasiri traders of the Kandahar district, who are subiects of the Afghan Government, and I am much grieved to hear the law lessness displayed by certain frontier officials of Your Excellency towards the said traders in Seistan territory. The particulars of the lawlessness in question are as follows :— The said traders with thirty-three of their relatives went, according to their usual habit, by the well-known trade route to Maskat for the purchase of merchandise. There they bought 4,300 breech-loading rifles and Snider carbines Nos. 51911, manufactured by the Enfield Company, -303 bore; Nos. 13667 taking a single cartridge and five cartridges, some of which were Ion' but most short, with 16 Mauser pistols taking ten cartridges each, and 30 swords for rifles. All the said arms were articles of commerce and were bought by the traders in question from Ali Khan, merchant of Maskat, and through him for the purpose of arming the people of Afghanistan. The traders expected to earn their livelihood by making some profit in this trade They were bringing the arms in question to Afghanistan. On the road on the 19th Rabi-ul-Awal 1325 Hijra, corresponding to 3rd May 1907, near Kacha Kuh, situated near the frontier of my Government, a large number of the servants of the British Government with some Baluchis of foreign territory were lying in wait for them m*Sangars in six places. No sooner had the said traders entered the pass in question than the party of British servants fired on them from their six hiding places. The consequence of this was that two of the said traders, named Hatak and Ibrahim, were killed and three named Paindu, Mulla Rahim, and Paindi were wounded. Eive^ others named Baz Khan, Eateh Khan, Shah Nawaz, Jahanhaz, and Khudai Rahm are missing and no trace has yet been found of them. The remaining traders were obliged to abandon their loads of arms, transport animals and cash, through fear of their lives and make good their escape. Afterwards Your Excellency’s frontier officials and their Baluch companions entered the said pass and carried off as booty eighty-four camels, 4,010 rifles of the above description, the details of which are given below :— Breech-loading rifles ... Rifles Nos. 51911 Rifles Nos. 13667, taking one cartridge each Snider carbines Magazine rifles, taking five cartridges each Mauser pistols, taking ten cartridges each Swords for rifles 650 1,650 290 390 30 16 30 Cartridges ... ... ••• 402,600, viz. f 100 for each rifle and pistol. They also carried off nine thousand Kabuli rupees in cash and other useful articles belonging to the said traders worth 4,160 Kabuli rupees. The said traders went from that place to the frontier officer of Chakhansur in ^ Afghan territory and have thence come on here to complain of the fearless ness of the frontier officials of Your Excellency, and to lay their case before me for redress. The petition received by me from the frontier officer of Chakhansur on the subject corroborates these statements. In these circum stances, I am sure that Your Excellency has already become acquainted of what happened, and in view of the perfect friendship existing between the two Governments has taken measures to enquire into the case of the Nasiris and the fearlessness of the frontier officials of Your Government, and that the factshave been ascertained. I am, therefore, waiting to hear that Tour Excellency has properly called the frontier officials in question to account. I hope l shah soon learn from Your Excellency what has been done to call to account ih,, persons, who killed two [Afghan subjects], wounded three and did away with hve, and to recover the arms, camels, cash and value of other artide, 1 hope I shall also be informed by Your Excellency that steps have been taken tzssi'gistsjxr ** d “ Foreign Office Press—No. 1475—3.10-07—74.© ibo*) *&gt;\ •1 Foreign Secret.

Capture of arms caravan in Kacha Gorge. Our telegram f 1 ' ; th May and correspondence forwarded since with Secretary’s letters of °0th June and 29th August. Letter dated 11th September has been received 7 n Amir complaining of seizure of caravan and killing and wounding of men Companying it; he greatly exaggerates number of arms captured, which, g were being brought for the purpose of arming people of Afghanistan, d expresses hope that our frontier officials will be punished, and steps taken to prevent such attacks in future. I have heard from secret source, which I believe to be reliable, that Amir wrote to his envoy to push matter on, adding that if he does not get full satisfaction he is prepared to cut off all connection with British Government. It is possible that Amir wrote in this strain to impress envoy, as we are aware he has done in the past, but our informant states that he appears to be very angry, and this may make him more difficile about accepting Convention. Amir says that he had only just heard of the affair, but the news writer at Herat on the 17th June and the British Agent officially at Kabul early in July reported that smugglers had complained to the Amir, who had not taken much notice of the case, though he was at Kandahar. It seems possible that he now realises that our action will stop his free supply of arms, and that anti-foreign party have-also pointed out inadvisability of checking this supply to our tribesmen, and that he has written in this strain to maintain his popularity in Afghanistan. Possibility of this difficulty was foreshadowed in our Despatch No. 24, 21st February 1907, paragraphs 9 and 12, but dangers arising from illicit trade were so great that we had to run risk, and seizure has undoubtedly done some good. It may also be that he is put off by garbled accounts of negotiations about Convention, which could easily have reached him, as he was close to Russian frontier. I am making inquiries from Macmahon regarding certain points of detail, and will defer reply to Amir for few weeks in order to allow him time to answer about Convention and to observe his attitude. I propose eventuall} 7 to justify action on grounds that persons concerned were engaged in illicit traffic contrary to laws of British and Persian Governments, that they were well aware of this, as shown by papers which fell into our hands, that the caravan was escorted by large party of armed men who tried to force their way through British limit, and that it was necessary to prevent such armed violation of our territory. I will refer to notorious fact that large numbers of these arms are being sold in Afghanistan to our frontier tribesmen without let or hindrance, and that, while we have allowed Amir every facility for obtaining arms for himself, we cannot possibly consent to unrestricted illicit import by irresponsible persons. It was not known at the time that the caravan belonged to Afghan subjects, and I regret misadventure which they brought upon themselves. Now, however, that Amir is aware that the trade is illicit, and that we strongly object to such violation of our territory, I trust he will help us in putting a stop to it. I shall be glad to know if you approve my answering on these lines. Recent frontier diaries show that arms from the Gulf are reaching frontier tribes in^laige numbers from Afghanistan; and that Afridi jirgas, when received at Kabul, vere to d by Nasrulla that they could purchase as many of these arms as they pleased, and no taxes or other difficulties were raised when the arms were being exported. The supply is practically unlimited and constitutes a veiy senous danger, and even at the risk of annoying Amir we cannot well allow him to make a grievance of legitimate action by us within our frontiers. Oui good understanding with Russia ought to enable us to deal with him firmly m this case, which involves two most important questions of policy, viz., the un restricted illicit supply of arms to Afghanistan and intrigues from Kabul with our tribes, in regard to both of which Amir has been clearly told, moie than once, that we cannot allow any interference with oui lights.Ho. 3198-S.A 4 I? From The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, The Hon* ble loa^or Sir A#h # Acaianon, Aoezrt to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, I am directed to refer to the correspondence ending v/ - t: with your letter Do. 768, dated the 26th July 1907 on the suhj of the traffic in arms from the Persian Gulf* 2 # Your predecessor forv r arded with his Confidential letter Ho, 645, dated the 17th August 1906 a report by Captain F # IilcConaghey on the results of his deputation to enquire into the illicit traffic in anus on the Persian Baluchistan coast. That officer recommendedj- (a) that a subsidy should be paid to the principal Sirdars on the Persian side of the frontier, viz Slider Said Khan of Geh and Mir Islam Khan of Binth, as an in centive to stop the trade in arms, and (b) that measures should be taken for strengthening the influence of the local authorities in Persian Baluch istan, Dated Simla, the 28thjj August 1907 Sir 35 . 3. She Government o? India concur in Hr. Sucker's vie* that it would he inadvisable to enter into any under stand inf; ^cr the reward of the Sirdars, especially in view of the fact that the headmen gain considerable profits from the illicit. You will also have observed from paragraph 3 of lieutenant Ogilvie's re port Ho? 4 dated the 8 th February 1907, a copy of which accom panied the confidential letter from the Government of India in j the Foreign Department Ho. 1500-2.A.. dated the 1st Hay 1907 that Sirdar Said Hhsn of Geh though a Kasim of Persian Hekran and always ready to protest his willingness to stop the traffic is in reality the chief factor in its encouragement. In these circum stances it is clear that no reliance could be placed on the oo-operation of the Persian Sirdars in suppressing the smuggling of arms in return for a subsidy. 4 . With regard to the second suggestion I am to say that the Government of India consider that it would be impolitic at pre sent to take any action in the Erection of strengthening Tehran influence in Persian Baluchistan. If the Anglo-Bussian negotia tions regarding Persia which are now proceeding are concluded, it l is not improbable that the region traversed by arms- smugglere wi| be included within the British sphere of interest and a more ef fective control over the passage of arms may then be possible.5. information procured 'b^ C&amp;ptain Ilo^Cona^ney on the subject cf the arms traffic has been of much service to the Government of India and I am to sa? that they concur in your predecessor's appreciation of the services rendered by Captain McConaghey in this connection. 5 ^ Xn your confidential letter Ho, 763 dated the 26th July 1907 you point out the ^reat importance of stopping the traffic the suggestions which the Government of India have already made in this connection. tfith regard to your second proposal I am to say that a scheme is under consideration for establishing a few observation posts, manned by telegraph guards, at intervals along the Uekran coast, from which movements of Afghans along the coast could be signalled to a patrolling ship at Jask or Charbar.

Until effective measures can be devised for checking the arms trade either at Uaskat or on the Persian coast re liance can only be placed on the vigilance of the British authorities in arresting caravans crossing British territory, and though the Government of India agree in thinking that this is not the most satisfactory solution, it is probable that the heavy loss sustained by the smugglers in the event of such captures as that at Eacha may act as a check upon the rapid growth of the trade to Afghanistan and the north TTest Frontier Province.

This can hardly bo cSfufato tS. ^ ° f aftairS ’° r “which we have any real to 212. The arms once landed on the Persian coast are met by caravans and taken by various routes through Persian Baluchistan where, as I have stated, a considerable number is disposed of, especially at Jalk, now the centre of a grow ing arms trade. There is a certain amount of smuggling in small consignments across our Baluch border, and this it is impossible to stop ; under present condi tions it must inevitably increase as our Baluch and Brahui tribes become more and more imbued with a desire to possess rifles. Through Persian Baluchistan the arms are taken northwards towards Afghanistan. On theMekran frontier we have outposts garrisoned by the Mekran Levy Corps as far north as Panjgur ; from this point to Amalaf we are at present dependent for any preventive measures upon the Chief of Kharan, not a very reliable personage in this respect because he gains more by the increase of the traffic than by its suppression. Prom Amalaf to Robat, at the extreme northwest corner of British territory, we asrain have a series of outposts garrisoned by the levies, while at Robat itself there is at present a military detachment of 200 Native Infantry. 13. It is at this northern portion of our frontier, through which many of the Afghan arms caravans have found their way in the past, that we first come into direct contact with the Afghan arms traffic. So long as the traders travelled in small parties they found little dfficulty in evading our posts by using one or other of the numerous routes across the narrow triangular strip of British territory between the Persian and Afghan frontiers. Latterly, however, the caravans have become larger and the traders more daring. On two recent occasions they have disdained to endeavour to slip through in small parties by circuitous routes and have boldly proceeded with large and well armed escorts along one of the more direct and shorter routes, that through the Kacha nullah. The first and larger caravan overpowered the small levy force which attempt ed to block its passage and succeeded in forcing its way through. The second was less successful ; it was met by a combined force of regulars and levies and was captured after many hours of stubborn resistance. Although by far the smaller of the two caravans, it yielded a prize of no less than 794 rifles and 62,000 rounds of ammunition. 14. The loss of arms, camels and men incurred by this caravan, heavy though it was, cannot he expected to check even temporarily the growing trade in arms into Afghanistan. The profits are so large and means of evading capture so many that we can look for no good or lasting results from this solitary success. On the contrary, the caravans will now choose their route with greater caution and will only venture to pass through our territory if they are in sufficient strength to overcome our available opposition. A slight detour will enable them to°avoid our territory and reach Afghanistan by one or other of the many routes south or north of Seistan. Opposition on the part of the Persians need not be considered. The Persian force which recently collected to block the route near Bobat vanished by desertion as soon as it assembled, and the idea of a body of Persians, however large, whether regular troops or levies, even sup posing it found rself on the right route, offering serious opposition to a well- armed party of determined Afghans, however small, is, to anyone acquainted with Persian methods, absolutely incredible. 15. If we review past results, we find that of the many arms caravans which have come from the Persian Gulf towards Afghanistan we have captured one and one only. While we are extremely unlikely to capture a second, we have the unpleasant prospect ever before us of seeing at some time or other one of our detachments overpowered in the attempt to block the- road of a ffio strongly escorted caravan. Our endeavours therefore to check the arms traffic on land seem hardly more successful than our endeavours at sea. The latter are ineffective and expensive ; the former are not only ineffective and expensive, they are dangerous also. 3rnm „ -Jf' Tliev myoh-e, moreover, danger more serious, in my opinion, than the possible defeat of a detachment. Collisions between our troops or levies and Afghans are not likely to increase or cement friendship in anv circumstances • still less when they take place on the very threshold of Afehan territory Tith the sympathy of the whole Afghan race on the side of the Afghan arms todm The scene of action m the present case is in fact far too close to the Afghan boundary to be convenient.

It would be futile, however, to conside y r the coast line south of Jask only. If landing were made difficult here the smugglers would at once he diverted to the coast to the nor h Intwithstamline its disadvantages, and we must therefore deal with the whole stretch of the coast from the Bi irish Frontier not only up to Jask, hut as far north as Minah, beyond which the Belgian Customs cordon relieve or should relieve us of the necessity for further action. FromMinab to the British Frontier near Guattar there is no Customs cordon, and the whole of the coast line lies men to the smucolcrs. From Guattar southwards smuggling is and can be effectively dealt with by our existing arrangements. It is only between Mina and Guattar therefore that measures are necessary. 22 The Persian Government have failed and will continue to fail to do anything to suppress the smuggling along their coast, and anything that is to he done wiU have to be done by ourselves. We have at present small mi i y detachments at Jask and Charbar; both places are wisely avoided by the arms ^ ronseouence Along the rest of the coast a cordon of small posts wouTd he necessary. From Guattar to Jask these could be placed along the telegraph line at places such as at Kair, Bir, Balag.

The garrison should preferably he composed of levies and form a section of the Mekran Levy orps, but unti/sufficient levies could be raised and trained, regulars would have to be employed. As the land telegraph line ceases at Jask some means of rapid intercom munication between the posts north of Jask would have to be devised. 23. With such a chain of posts I am confident that the arms traffic on the Persian coast would cease to exist. Co-operation between our land cordon a d flTwar vessel!in the Gulf would render any attempt to and arms so difficult and dangerous that no dhow-owner would venture to take the nsk But the difficulties which beset these measures are many and obvious. 1 y Q m involve a great departure from our usual policy \ 11 » Persian Baluch cordon moreover would doubtless he much resented by the Fersian isaiuou Chiefs' who now profit by the arms traffic, and it is not improba e ia n sity would fo'rc! us into direct dealings with them of a natorewnchmig.Uead to far.reaoliiii' results.

Besides the pay of men and officer on a {Sccoml it would comprise the cost of erecting a number of buildings for their acoom modation. 24 There thus remains the first alternative, the suppression of the arms ♦raffle nV Moskat itself This would involve two things : the amendment of “a y^Gto Frlnco and the United States, and the compen^ton of the Sultan of Maskat for the loss of duties on the importation of arms. In o rpresent relations with Franco and the United States the treaty difficulties can hardly present an insuperable obstacle, while the compensation of the Sultan is merely a matter of money payment. Such a payment on our part, moreover, would have the additional political advantage' of strengthening our position very materially with the Sultan. The existing state of affairs whereby he derives large profits from a trade which he knows to be most repugnant to us, can hardly serve to impress him to our advantage. He has doubtless long wondered how it is we are not powerful enough to have Maskat closed as a port of importation for arms, and has more than once taxed Major Grey to suggest • Firfe huletter No. 664 of 2cth Kovembcr 1906 . the explanation why we have not taken that measure. As Major Grey has point ed* out, such a step so far from impairing our present cordial relations with the Sultan would tend in no small measure to increase our influence with him. 25. The dangers of delay in taking this step are self evident. Not only +Thp value of arms Hnd ammunition imported into V ill the Sllltdn S incomef from the traffic during UO 6 07 has already reached Rs. grow with every year it is allowed to continue and render it more and more costly to recompense him for its loss, the interests of other nations in the trade will spring up and make a settlement increasingly difficult. The cost of settle ment even at the present juncture may be fairly high, yet it falls far short of the cost of the only other measures which can check traffic, and is nothing to thy expense to which we will inevitably be put in our endeavours to cope vith the results of a continued unrestricted import of arms on to our frontier. 26. I have been led into a longer discussion of this question than was at first intended, hut the importance of it from the point of view of this Province serves as a sufficient excuse. I sincerely trust that His Majesty's Government may be moved to take early steps to close Maskat as a port of importation for arms, and thus accomplish the most effective if not the only means of putting a stop to the pernicious influx of arms and ammunition into our frontier. I attach a note on the coast line between Minab and Jask prepared from Naval sources by Major W. G Grey, His Britannic Majesty's Consul at Maskat, to whom I am indebted for much valuable information on the arms trade in the Gulf. Note on coast between Jaslc and Minab river by Major W. 0. Grey ) Political Agents Ma*kat. I Nature of coast) etc.—{l) Jask to Ras-ul-Kuh{ (35 miles). The whole shore line is very low lying and is swampy for some distance from the beach ; large tracts are simply mud flats with shallow creeks at low water and at high water a large expanse of shallow water. Between this swampy ground and the hills (6 miles or less inland) is some good grazing, camels seem to be habitually brought here for that purpose. (2) Bas-ul-Kuh { to Minab river (about 90 miles). At Ras-ul-Kuh itself and for some 10 miles to the north there is firm ground right up to the sea shore. From thence to Minab the foreshore is very swampy indeed, with mangroves, for about 5 miles inland. Here the “ going ” is very bad. II. Khors. Ihe only khors suitable for runninar into between Minab and Jask are {a) Khagun, about 45 miles from Bunder Abbas, and (ft) Khor Kumari, about 50 miles to the south. This latler is really an inlet into the stretch of swampy ground and although suitable for moderate-sized dhows would be difficult to make in anything but calm weather—a thing rarely obtainable in the 6/&gt;amal season (November to April). But that the place is used it evident from the camel marks which were seen at the entrance to the khor, probably there is some track through the mangrove swamp. t Sic, must be Has Kuh-i-A! nbarak, but see sketch. Its common name among I be people is as given by Hose. 6* From Kbor Kumari to the south there is no landing place until Has- ul-Kuh is reached, about 35 miles from Jask. At Ras-ul-Kuh there is deep water close to the shore on the west side and on the south is a fairly good khor. III. Customs stations —There is only one at Shahbander, the port of Minab river ; that at Ras-ul Kuh has recently been given up. Minab is under the Director of Customs at Bunder Abbas. Captain Hose remarks that the coast in question does not lend itself to the arms traffic owing to (1) the very shallow water which runs so far out from the shore ; (2) the difficulties of making the few khors at anything but high water and fine weather—the latter very rarely to be had in the Shamal season, and (3) the few alternative spots there are to run for in case any one or more should be watched. Rough sketch made from an old map. Khor Khagun should be nearer Minab river. Evidently the two inlets between it and Khor Kumari have ceased to exist. Total coast line is 165 miles from Bunder Abbas to Jask. (Sd.) W. G. GREY. G. C. Press, SimU.-No. C-295 F. 0.-13-8-07.-87-E. A.

(b) It is quite certain that the Sirdar does not permit these arms Caravans to pass through his territory, but it is equally certain that, while barring their passage through his country, he levies a tax on the Caravan for having entered Kharan. Ibis tax takes the form of rifles. ( c ) The Sirdar does not import rifles direct from Muscat. 3. The Sirdar gave the Hon’ble Mr. Tucker a verbal promise that he would not import rifles without previous reference to us : but he was at pt time unwilling to confirm this verbal promise in writing. I bave now been able to obtain this from him and forward a copy of the document for the Hon ble the Agent to the Governor-General’s information. Tramlalion of a ikrirnamd dated the 8th July 1907, signed by Sir Nauroz Khan Nausherwani. I Sirdar Nauroz Khan Nausherwani, hereby promise that before sending for any number of rifles for myself from Muscat, it will be my duty to inform the British Government through the Political Agent, Kalat, and the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I give the above mentioned few words in writing to be useful at the time of need. (Sd.) Sir Nauroz Khan. G C.

(9) Murasia, dated 26th Rabi-nl-Awal 1322 (11th Jnne 1904), from the Hakim of Herat to Sirdar Ahmad Khan, the Governor of Kandahar. On Thursday, the 1st Shaban last year, Wall Muhammad, son of Baz Muhammad and Alahdad, son of Aulia Lawanis, complained to me in Darbar that they were going from Herat on a journey to Asfrar and happened to meet a band * 3 •Note. —This list is not quite intelligible as there are a number of Hindi figures with nothing to eho* what they indicate. 3f ofdacoits, seven in number, who bond them and robbed them of the following property :— Breech-loading guns .

You were kind enough to give me a firman addressed to Maksudjan and Abbas Khan, the former has attended your Darbar, but the latter has not turned up yet, I had been ill for some time past. On recovery I took your firman to the two men named above. Maksudjan recovered a breech-loading gun and a camel belonging to me from Abbas Khan. Three of the dacoits are the tribesmen of Abbas Khan, while the four others belong to Bandi Taimur. Sher Ali, Atazkhan and Bahar Khan have stood security for the dacoits. I trust you will give due consideration to my case. P. Hakim Muhammad Karim Khan, Nurzai, went to Bandi Taimur to arrest the dacoits, but the headmen mentioned above defied him and had the dacoits released by force. Endorsement by the Governor, dated Safar 1323 (April 1905). Sei n. You should discuss the matter with Maksud Khan, who is here. If he returns your property recovered from Abbas Khan well and good: otherwise he should appear in Darbar. As soon as Abbas Khan turns up the matter will be discussed with him.

Petition, dated Monday, the 18th Safar 1323 (24th April 1905), from Alahdad, Nasir of Kalchabad, to the Governor of Kandahar. I took your letters on two or three occasions to Hakim Maksudjan and Abbas Khan, directing them to redress my grievances ; but they paid no atten tion. I have been wandering about for the last two years without any result. Some of my stolen property has, of course, been restored to me, but the remain der is still with them. For God’s sake do justice to me. Endorsement, dated Monday, the 18th Safar 1323 (24th April 1905), by the Governor of Kandahar. If you have witnesses or any other proof to show that you ^ delivered my firman to the persons named in your petition and they did nothing in the way of granting you redress, you should produce the same before me, so that I may know the true facts and call upon the men to account for their conduct. (10 b) Petition, dated 20th Safar 1323 (26th April 1905), from Alahdad, Nasir of Kalchabad, to the Governor of Khandahar. Two years ago, while I was coming from Herat to Kandahar, I happened to meet some seven dacoits near Shahbed village, who were armed with rifles. On being questioned, they told me they were soldiers. We were four men in all, two of us were with the camels and two were coming ahead. ^ The thieves bound us all and carried away all our property, leaving us at some distance from the road. By nightfall we were able to untie ourselves. My companions returned to Herat to report the occurrence to the authorities, while I, myself, went in pursuit of the dacoits. 5The Governor of Herat ordered ray companions to produce evidence to show that we were possessed of the property alleged to have been robbed, so that the Herat people might he called upon to compensate us for our losses. The required evidence was adduced, and I possess a sanad from the Herat office bearing testimony to the fact. We represented to the Governor of Herat that we had reason to believe that the men who had robbed us belonged to the Kandahar district, and that we did not therefore want the innocent Heratis to be saddled with an unjust burden. The tracks of the dacoits were traced to Bandi Taimur, where it was found that three of them were Nurzais belonging to the khel of Abbas Khan, while the other four were Isakzais of the khel of Sherali Khan and Bahar Khan. I then came to Sardar Ahmad Khan, the late Governor, and requested him to detail some sowars and footmen to help us in bringing in the dacoits and recovering our property. The Sardar refused to do so, but gave us a letter to Muhammad Karim Khan, who, he said, was on the spot and could attend to our complaint. Muhammad Karim Khan, on my delivering the letter to him, called upon Ahbas Khan to hand over the culprits, or to pay compensation to the extent of our losses. The latter replied that he would deliver up his tribesmen concerned provided the Ishakzais also delivered their men or paid their share of the compensation. Muhammad Karim Khan then went to the Ishakzais, who, on being pressed hard, promised to produce the offenders the next morning, but instead of doing so they made them disappear. Seeing that Muhammad Karim Khan was unable to secure the dacoits, I came to Sardar Ahmad Khan and reported all the particulars to him. He sent Maksudjan, Muhammadzai, with me, and he recovered a breech-loading gun and a camel belonging to me, but the other stolen property is still unrecovered. The men concerned have refused to come with me, despite the two firmans from you. If you will kindly arrange yourself for the appearance of all the parties concerned before you well and good, otherwise I will go to Kabul to seek my redress. Endorsement by the Governor of Kandahar, dated 20th Safar 1323 (26th April 1905). You should appear before me personally in the Darbar. I will pr.ss the necessary orders on learning the true facts of the case. (10 c) Petition, dated Monday, the 18th Rabi-ul-Awal 1323 (16th May 1905), from Alahdad, son of Aulia, Nasir of Kalchabad, to the Governor of Khandahar. Some time ago I set out on a journey from Herat to Kandahar. When I reached Shahbed, a village 2 stages off Herat, a gang of dacoits appeared and robbed me of property worth ten or twelve thousand rupees. You were pleased to give me two letters to Maksudjan, Muhammaizai, but no action has been taken by him or Abbas Khan in the matter. I have neither means nor influence to win over these men to my side. I therefore look to you only for justice. Endorsement, dated the 10th Rabi-ul-Awal 1323 (16th May 1905), by the Governor of Kandahar. You should appear before me personally. The necessary orders will be given after I am acquainted with the true facts of the case. 6 G. C. Press, Simla.—No. C-230 F. D.-15-7-07.-114.-E. A.

General letter. (US'D A Dated H.M.S “ Sphinx ” at Jask, the 6th May 1907. p rom Commander W. S. Bowman, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, To—The Naval Commander-in-Chief. I have the honour to report that having taken over the duties of Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf from Captain Cecil S. Hickley of H.M.S. “Highflyer ” on 22nd April, I remained at Maskat in company with H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” until the receipt of your telegram No. 32 on 27th April. 2. I sent H.M.S. “ Lapwing ” across to the Mekran Coast the same day, giving Lieutenant and Commander Barker orders to make either Jask or Chahbar his head-quarters, and to cruise against arms runners. 3. I remained at Maskat until 30th April when I left for Jask taking with me Major Grey who wished to go there officially. I arrived at Jask at 1-30 p m., 1st May, finding there H.M.S. “ Lapwing.” As no news of arms leaving Maskat, nor of any suspicious movement among Afghans onshore had been received, she had remained at anchor there since her arrival on 28th April. 4 I left Jask for Maskat at 8 p.m. of 2nd May, and arrived at 1 p.m. next day. Having disembarked Major Grey I left again at 6-30 p.m. for the Mekran Coast, intending to call at Galeg, Tank, Passim, and Chahbar, as I had heard rumours at Maskat that dhows with arms for the three first named ports had left, or would shortly be leaving. 5. I shaped course at, first for Tank, and at 8 r.M. of 4th May (Lat. 25-00 N. Lon'. 59-45 E.) I stopped and searched a dhow bound thither trom Maskat They’had no arms on board, and the Captain, who is an acquaintance of our interpreter, informed him that three dhows with arms were at Maskat when he left (1st May) and intended to sail the same night for Galeg, kunarek, or Saidich. 6. I then shaped course for Galeg, anchoring there at 1-20 p.m., 4th May. 7. I landed in the Khor the same afternoon, hut could get no information of any value.8. We lav with all lights out during the night at Galeg, and at noon next day (5th May) I weighed and proceeded south-south-west. 9. At 3 p m, about 12 miles south of Galeg I stopped and searched a dhow bound there from Maskat. She had on-board Ali c Khan, a Chief belonging.to Galeg, who,is, I understand, paid by the Government of India to assist against arms runners. 10. He stated that the dhow belonged to him, so I had the search stopped, but it had been pretty thoroughly carried out before I was aware of Ali Khan’s ownership. No arms were found in her. 11. I then stood to the westward till 7-45 p.m. when we sighted another dhow under sail about 14 miles south-west from Has Maidani. I altered course in her direction, but I fancy she lowered her sails, and we lost sight of her in the darkness. Had we had a searchlight we should have caught her. She showed no lights. ■ ' • ■ • ■ * • 12. At 10-45 p m. I anchored off Has Maidani, and lay there with all lights out till 6 a.m. when I proceeded to the westward, anchoring at .Task 4-30 p.m. on the same day. 13. I have only heard of 170 rifles having been landed since the “Lapwung'’ came on the Mekran Coast on the 27th of last month. These were for Baluchis and not Afghans. 14. I purpose sendingthe “ Lapwing ” to Maskat in time for Lieutenant and Commander Barker to meet his relief there, and to catch the mail steamer leaving for Bombay on 15th May. 15. On her return from Maskat I propose, should the arms traffic not have ceased by then, to keep the “ Lapwing ” on the Mekran Coast and carry out our annual rifle practice at Henjam as we did last year. I am anxious to get this over as early in the year as possible. • • ' ' 1 • • ■ &gt;: &gt; &lt; . 1G.

I am also of opinion that great ^edit is due to Major Webb-Ware for the prompt and able measures which he from the commencement and to which, I consider, subsequent results are largely due. . . , . . q T he conduct of the troops and of the levies in very trying circum- stances has been shown to have been admirable, and I strongly support the Simeestion made hv the Political Agent to give some pecuniary reward both to “the troops and the levies; I am of opinion that the latter might suitably he given whatever reward may be decided on as suitable, for the former I '' oul(1 submit that the reward might equitably he given to the whole Military Detach- me,it at Robat as all were called on to perform arduous duties in closing the various routes by which caravans could come, not only in the case of the first and'second caravans, hut also in the case of a reported third caravan which was expected for many days, but which never came. , j In paragraph 11 the Political Agent brings to notice the good work done hv the Telegraph Masters at the various offices along the line. I am forwarding a copy of these remarks for the information of the Director-General of Telegraphs. 4 , As regards the disposal of the arms and ammunition I propose tn deposit them in the Arsenal at Quetta on their arrival here, and would suggest that some special arrangements be made by Government to have them very carefully 6 examined and reported upon either in Quetta or elsewhere by „r,mr,f&gt;tent experts with a view to ascertaining the firms who manufactured them, and if possible the agencies through whose hands they found their way to the Persian Gulf. # The proposal made by Major Webb-Ware m paragraph 10 of his letter for stating secret service agents in Sarhad is one which I am disposing of 1&lt;&gt;C The small loss to which the Saindak Levies were put during the fight with the sTond caravan (paragraph 8 of the Political Agent’s report) will be made good to them. , - ^ The loss which has been inflicted on the second caravan cannot tail to have a depressing effect on the arms trade and in this way should have excellent results. The size of the caravans and the strength and boldness of the parties escorting them show, however, that the Persian Gulf arms traffic has now reached a stage which necessitates more energetic action on the part of the Government than has been taken in the past. On this point I wiU submit further remarks later, and will not delay the submission of this report to do so now* # i a ± 6 The translation of the various documents which the Political Attached to his report will take some time. I am accordingly withholding them and will submit translations of them for the mformation of the Govern- Teent of India as soon as they are complete. Captain Grant s report on the. patterns of the various.captured arms and ammunition is attached in original.2 No. 136, dated the 3rd June 1907 (Confidential). From—The Political Agent, Chagai, To—The First Assistant to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. With reference to the telegraphic correspondence closing with Foreign Office No. S.—22, dated the 29th August last (1906), I have the honour 'to submit, for the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General’s information, a report on the passage and attempted passage across the western extremity of the Chagai district of the two arms caravans referred to therein. 2. On the 10th April, you transmitted a communication to me that two caravans laden with arms and ammunition have left Jagin, presumably for Afghanistan. On studying the matter, the conclusion I came to was that these Caravans would probably break across the Perso-Afghan frontier somewhere m the vicinity of the point where the large arms caravan made the passage hst year. I accordingly warned the Thanadar Saindak and the Rassaldar at Robat to keep a careful look-ouf, and in addition I forwarded a copv of your communication to the Officer Commanding the Robat Escort. Dispositions were also made to obtain information. At a little after 11 o’clock a.m. on the 27th April, T was called to the Telegraph Office, Dalbandin, by information that the Thanadar Saindak had a matter of urgency to communicate. This proved to be that news had just come in by runner from KaCha that a large arms caravan accompanied bv a strong escort of Afghans armed with breech-loading rifles had arrived, a 'few hours previously, at Kacha Thana en route to Band-i-Kamal Khan, and that it was their intention to halt a few hours and then proceed via Kacha gorge to Godar-i-Shah, on the Shelag river. For their protection they had thrown out sentries and pickets and had blocked all roads leading from Kacha. In answer to a query I put, the Thanadar reported that he had six men available, and he requested instructions as to how he was to proceed. I directed him to take his men and marching as rapidly as possible to seize the northern exit of the Kacha gorge. It was obvious that, with the small force at his disposal and in the face of such numbers, he could not, single-handed, be expected to effect much : he was therefore instructed to impress on his men to direct their fire at the caravan’s camels, and I pointed out to him that his duties were strictly confined to doing all in Ids power to disable them and to delay the caravan until help arrived from Robat. The Thanadar left at once I then called up Captain Grant, and informing him of the news I had received and the dispositions made to delay the caravan, I requested him to transmit orders to the Rassaldar, Robat, to move his four levies with the utmost speed they were capable of to Kacha gorge and on arrival there to form a junction with the Saindak levies, and I further asked this officer to despatch a party of rifles to assist. These orders were carried out with commendable promptitude. The Robat levies moved off at once and thirty minutes later they were followed by Lieutenant Tate with a party of 50 rifles. The Saindak levies under Sharbat Khan reached the position assigned to them about 10 p.m. The moon was up, but a wind from the north, suffused with finely divided dust, obscured the surroundings. There were no signs of the caravan having passed, and after waiting an hour and becoming apprehensive that it might have taken a different route Thanadar Sharbat Khan despatched a levy up the gor^e to reconnoitre with instructions to fire his carbine should he meet the caravan in motion. The wisdom of this step is questionable, for, as will be seen, its only result was to put the caravan on its guard. The levy had not gone long when the report of his carbine was heard, followed, shortly after, by shouts from the caravan, as the sarwans urged their camels forward down the gorge. Already on the alert the caravan advanced towards the exit prepared to bear down any opposition it might encounter. Throwing out strong bodies of men on either side the latter masked the levies’ fire by the heavy fire they brought to bear in return and under cover of this they rushed the mouth of the gorge, so far as the dust haze permitted the levies to see, in a series of detached bodies. A man was heard to cry out and subsequent reports tend to s ow that tvo Afghans were wounded, one of whom has since succumbed and three are missing. In addition to this two or three camels are said to have3 , v- f Vvxr Following the passage of the last detachment Sharhat but ^not tooTate^tQ 8 teke ''part°i^ e ^A. ^ToUey* how^ yetum flight A package containing 2,900 rounds o£ ammunition adversaries , • P tl | ame of Kynock was picked up in the gorge ^fstlaslTo S WCTe'found which testified to the fact that the levies^ « d Pad not been wholly ineffective.

In addition to this, a small sum of money in krans was found in a khurjin and several papers, a list of which is attached. In the course of the fight, several bags of cartridges -uere struck by rifle fire and exploded and the wood-work of two loads of rifles jffered destruction from fire which originated in the same way. I forward separately specimens of the several types of cartridges captured and also kkels taken from various packages of ammunition. These latter are not wholly representative as many thousand rounds were found, loose, packed in bags and bear no labels of any description. The arms were secured in gunny bags, khurjins, blankets, &amp;c., and the following names are repeated on several of the packages in the Urdu character, viz. 1. Muhammad Jan. 2. Sahib Jan. 3. Abdul Wahab. 4. Zarif Khan. 6. Afu Khan. 6. Khan. This first named Muhammad Jan is no doubt the same man who is referred to in the paragraph 2 above in connection with No. 1 caravan‘. indeed it now appears that the caravans originally started from the coast m company and separated as the result of a quarrel. I have not received a detailed report from Captain Grant with regard to the second caravan, but I attach two interesting letters in which he describes the various types of arms which fell into ^his hands which appear, in general characteristics, to correspond closely with those captured by the levies. It is difficult to say with any decree of accuracy what the Afghan losses in killed amounted to Their guide, a Salarzai Baluoh named Rodan, whose services they had enlisted at Khan, was killed early in the fight. A few men, some 18 in all, have reached Garmsel and state that their losses in killed and wounded amounted to 20. Ibis number is probably accurate as it corresponds, generally, with the reports which have come in from other quarters. A few camels broke back into a side nulla and eventually appear to have found their way out of the bills for 8 are lying dead a few miles north of the trade route and tiavellers from the Helmand testify to having seen the bodies of many more dead camels on the route. Such reports as have come in show that no camels reached the Helmand alive and that the Afghans, who did reach Garmsel, did so in a miserable plight, starving with only their personal arms and without any ammunition. There is some reason for believing that a few rifles were buried during the flight and steps are being taken to ascertain whether this was so and to recover them. 6. Rifles sell in the districts bordering this Agency at from Rs. 80 to 150. I think that we are therefore justified in taking Its. 100 as being a fair average price per weapon. At this rate the 794 rifles would represent a sum of Rs 79 400. The local value of the 64,900 cartridges captured, at a low estimate is Rs 7,000. Some 72 camels were accounted for either during the conflict or during the early part of the flight and some 15 more are beheved to have perished afterwards. These 87 camels at Rs. 60 each represent a loss of Rs 5 220. I do not think that we would thus be far wrong, if we include the two camcl-loads of cartridges which were exploded, camel equipment and various odds and ends, in taking the loss inflicted on the arms trade at (not S) less than a lakh of rupees. At Ghazni the value of the consignment would naturally be far in excess of this figure. 6 When all did well it is somewhat difficult to single out any names for special praise. I have already mentioned Lieutenant Tate and the strenuous effort he made, under most adverse circumstances, to come up with the first caravan That his men responded so willingly evinces great credit on this officer his powers of command, and the spirit with which he imbued his party. To Captain Grant the debt I owe is very great indeed, and I would express a6 hope that Government will mark their appreciation of the very important part he played in the destruction of this arms caravan. Throughout he has dis played the greatest energy and enthusiasm, carried out the various instructions conveyed him with zeal and with a forethought, in regard to minute detail which insured success, which are above all praise and which I trust I may be permitted to say stamp him as being an officer of ability and merit. Jemadar Eajwali who commanded the ambushed party of rifles behaved admirabh % The accounts I have received prove that during the seven hours he and his men were under heavy fire they shot coolly and collectively and that they finally drove their adversaries off by sheer determination. I trust that this native officer’s services may be duly recognised. That no casualties occurred among his detachment is due to the excellent position which he selected and the cover which he prepared. There is some reason for supposing that No. 2 caravan included a party of Afridis. During the fight Jemadar llajwali reports that he heard the “retire”, “assembly” and “advance” whistled; this, if correct, would testify to the presence of ex-sepoys, and from Garmsel I have received information that some of the fugitives who reached there are of a caste of Pathans who have not yet been seen in that country. If this information should prove correct, it may possibly explain the stubbornness of the opposition which Jemadar Eajwali met and overcame. 7. I have referred to the important part which Thanadar Sharbat Khan and his six levies took. His plans were admirably laid, he displayed great intelligence in obtaining early and accurate information, and the advice he gave to Jemadar Eajwali and the Eobat levies was excellent; moreover the position he selected with a view to preventing any part of the caravan break ing back was chosen with great judgment and discrimination. He fought an independent action extending from early morning until nightfall, opposed to superior numbers, under cover, and that he finally drove them off was due to the dogged pluck and the tenacity he and his men displayed. Thanadar Sharbat Khan is, in point of service, the oldest native officer *in the Chagai levies. He has a long and honourable record to his credit, and it was my intention to bring his services to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor- General’s notice next year in the hope that they might be adequately recog nised; I would suggest that tbe recent services which he has rendered might now be advantageously rewarded. Captain Grant has written that he considers that the destruction of the caravan was largely due to the initiative which Thanadar Sharbat Khan displayed and that this is the case the account I give proves beyond doubt. Ido, the Kirtaka Duffadar, rendered great assistance to Thanadar Sharbat Khan with whom he was closely associated throughout the fight, and I would propose that he be rewarded separately by a sanad and a Khillat of Es. 100. 8. I was somewhat disappointed by the part taken by the Eobat levies on the occasion of the passage of the first caravan, as I consider that they might have gained their position at Kacha with more rapidity : however they took part with the infantry in the second fight and fought determinedly throughout giving valuable support to Jemadar Eajwali. During the fight with the second caravan the Saindak levies lost a camel and some other petty articles of property in all valued at some Es. 95. I would recommend that this may be made good. 9. In view of the high value of the arms which have been captured I would enquire whether it would be feasible to give the infantry and levies concerned some reward in the form of a grant or batta ? The wear and tear to animals and uniforms scrambling up and down rocks have not been in considerable, and all have suffered very real hardships from the marching and countermarching in the extreme heat which prevailed. 10. In regard to future arms caravans, I would ask that I may be ac corded permission to station two secret service agents at a favourable point in Sarhad. Both these caravans travelled from Bazman via Galichah, marching further on by a route which is rarely used. We know little what is going on in this particular part of Sarhad and experience has shown that it is difficult to obtain accurate and early information. In my diary 45, dated 8th December,7 75 T^araeraph 4,1 made a suggestion on this subject, and I would now ask that may be favourably considered. I would note that information regarding t le first caravan reached Robat a few hours after it came into Kacha, but unfortunately too late to be of any service. The cost of two secret agents would merely amount to Rs. 12 per man per mensem or Rs. 288 per annum . and they might nominally be attached to Robat as Khassadais. 11 Before closing this report I desire to express my obligations to the Telegraph Masters, Rohat, Samdak, Bal- Taj-ud-din, Robat. ^ bandin, and Padag. The dispositions ^ to Muhammad Khan, baihandin. meet these caravans were made by calling Muhammad Wazir Khan, Padag. ^ le persons concerned into the telegraph offices and explaining in detail over the wires how they must proceed. Captain Grant has brought tomy notice the great assistance which the Telegraph Master at Robat B. Tai-ud-din, and his assistant, Muhammad Abdul Aziz, rendered him and I can endorse this from personal knowledge. On the Telegraph Masters named in the margin many hours’ hard work was thrown, and I can testify to the cheerfulness and willingness with woich they responded, toi on two occasions I was compelled to make use of the wires for 5 and 6 hours respectively. My thanks are also due to the Telegraph Master, Nushki, who showed equal readiness to assist when it was believed that a third caravan was moving along the same route. I would ask that the assistance that these Telegraph Masters rendered may be brought to the notice of their departmental head. 12. I would be favoured with early instructions as to the disposal ot these arms on their arrival in Quetta. No. R.—202, dated Robat Killa, the 7th May 1907 (Confidential). p rom Captain W. O.

In continuation of my letter No. 149, dated the 25th March last, I have the honour to make a further report regarding the arms trade. 2. One or two small consignments, the property of Afghans, having escaped the vigilance of His Majesty’s Ships appear to have been landed on the Mekran Coast towards the end of April. However, early in May, a measure of success attended our efforts. A dhow containing 500 rifles and 50,000 rounds of ammunition left Maskat about the 1st. A search was made for her without success, she having remained a longer time upon the Oman Coast than such vessels usually do, in order to avoid capture. On the 10th instant as she w r as nearing Jask, H.M S. “ Sphinx ”, which had just quitted that port en route for Henjam, hove in sight and the captain not caring to risk a search threw the whole of his cargo overboard. 3. At the end of April I received information that Ali Musa intended to proceed to Mekran before long to interview the Khalifah, and that he would probably take over some arms with him ; and I availed myself of the departure of the “ Sphinx ” for Jask on April 30th to visit that port with the object of conferring with Mr. New, Assistant Traffic Superintendent. 1 e latter has arranged to have Ali Musa watched and if possible his arms confiscat ed. Ali Musa has not yet left Maskat, and I hear that his departure has been deferred for a week or two. 4. Three small dhows have left during the last five days with sor ?f 3 ^? rifles destined for Biluch chiefs, and on receipt of information from me H.M.S. “ Sphinx ” has returned to the Mekran Coast. There are only 4 Afghans now- remaining in Maskat who are said to be waiting to accompany Ah Musa on his trip : but four others arrived by the last mail from Bunder Abbas and h ave J e “ already for Mekran after purchasing 200 rifles. It is not likely that Maskat will see any more of these visitors now until next cold weather. G. C.

Foreign Office, Reference to previous letter: Description of Inclosure. Name and Date. Subject.copy No. 102. (188ft 1 ^ G U L H E K, 19th May, 1907. Slr:- With reference to my despatch No,48 of March 1st last In which I transmitted copy of Monsieur Naus' re port on the Southern Customs, I have now the honour to forward a copy of an interesting despatch on this sub ject addressed by Major Cox to Sir Louis Dane. With regard to Major Cox’s suggestions on the sub ject of a modification of the existing tariff I would observe that there can be no doubt that it is respon sible for the great increase of smuggling in Southern Persia and that the best means of discouraging contra band trade would be to reintroduce a 5^ or 8?5 customs duty. But the existing tariff is an Important instru ment in Russian commercial policy in this country and I fear there is little chance of obtaining Russia’s consent to a modification on the grounds that the revenue for the southern ports (in which Russia is not interested) Sir Edward Grey, Bart., M.P. &amp;c.Interested) has suffered In consequence. The great Increase in the arms traffic is an Inde pendent question. It is an extremely Important one to both Persia and India and, if continued. It Is evident that the male population of Persia, Afghanistan and Baluchistan will soon be armed with small bore rifles of good quality. An efficient customs organisation in Southern Persia might possibly be of some use in dis couraging the trade in arms. But as Major Cox points out, nothing is to be hoped for from the action of the Persian Government. I have, &amp;c., (Signed) Cecil Spring Rice.No. 686 Of 1907 \ (81 IRITISH RESIDENCY AND CONSULATE GENERAL, B U S H I R E. 3l8t&gt; March, 1907. I have the honour to submit a copy of a communi cation addressed by Monsieur Naus, Minister of Customs, to the Persian Prime Minister, which Sir Cecil Spring Rice has kindly forwarded to me with the request that I will transmit a copy to the Government of India with such comment as I may have to offer, communicating my observations to him at the same time. 2. Monsieur Naas' Note deals both with the ques tion of contraband trade in the Persian Gulf in general and with the illicit traffic in arms in particular and while it may be taken for granted that he makes the most of a brief which was clearly the sequel to the recent upheaval in the Bushlre Customs culminating in the exit of the Derya Begi and Monsieur Heynssens from the Gulf stage and while I am not in a position readily to Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I. Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla.to test the detailed accuracy of his figures there is nevertheless no doutt whatever that his statements sure generally speaking well-founded, though soroewhat over drawn. In forwarding the papers to me the Minister ob serves that we are deeply interested both in the sup pression of the Arms Traffic and in the maintenance of the Customs Revenue of Southern Persia, a fact which the Government of India will readily endorsei but in the second connection I should explain that the remark able impetus given to smuggling during the past two or three years, which has frequently been drawn attention to by this Office (e.g. Bushire Trade Report for 1905) is nothing but the inmedlate result of the en hanced Tariff accepted by us in the Commercial Conven tion of February 9th, 1903, and it would surely be difficult to conceive a more forcible Indictment against that Tariff than this parting Jeremiad which the late Minister of Customs has left on record. In my Administration Report for 1905-1906 when referring to the prevalence of smuggling, I expressed thethe opinion that under the existing conditions of Ad ministration there was no remedy for the state of things reported short of a return to an all round 5 per cent ad valorem duty. Since then Monsieur Heynssens, Monsieur Constant and Monsieur Waffelaert, while successively in charge of the customs Administra tion of the Gulf have each of them expressed themselves to me to much the same effect, and speaking with full knowledge of the local conditions and possioilitles, say they are convinced that the alteration of the Tariff even to an all round 8 per cent duty would make the smugglers art a profitless risk and result in a large Increase in revenue from the Customs of the Gulf Ports. I venture to hope that the excellent opening afforded to us by the terms of Monsieur Naus* report to the Grand Vialer will be made the most of and that it may be considered possible for us to use it as a lever with which to bring about the reconstruction of the Tariff, a measure for which, in view of the gradu- ally ripening entente between ourselves and the Russian Government, and the generally precarious condition ofof the Belgian Customs Administration pursuant to the dismissal of Monsieur Naus, the present juncture seems eminently favourable. 3. Before proceeding to offer any comment on the details of Monsieur Hsus' statements and recommenda tions, I trust I may be pardoned for digressing for a moment, in order to say a few words in favour of the Derya Begi, who has been connected with the Bushire Gov ernment on and off for the last 20 years and has on the whole been the most friendly Governor we have had. Monsieur Heynssens I know always believed that His Excellency was the deus ex machine of the plot or agitation recently got up against him by the Mullas and populace of Bushire, and it is only natural that in vindicating his subordinate and his administration the Minister of Customs should make the most of avail able material in stating his case against the Derya Begi; but as I read his vehement impeachment of the late Governor I cannot help remarking how times have changed since Sir Arthur Hardlnge addressed the Foreign Office in his despatch No.31 Commercial of JuneJune 1905, regarding the previous agitation of April and May of that year, wrote: *1 hear from a confidential source that Monsieur Naus in a report to the Vali Ahd (the present Shah ) dated 3rd instant, informs His Imperial Highness that the agitation at Bushire has subsided, but that the Prince Governor-General of Pars is alleged to be reviv ing it at Shiraz,. His Excellency in this report speaks in very eulogistic terms of the Derya Begi, the present Governor of the Gulf Ports'. 4. Much might be written regarding many of the points raised in Monsieur Naus* comprehensive exposi tion of the existing position in the Gulf, but as I start with the belief that most of his statements are well founded, it will perhaps be sufficient if I take the salient features of his remarks and recommendations seriatim and add such brief comment as seems called for. I. The division of Jurisdiction over the Pars and Mekran Coasts between the Governors of Bushire, Shiraz, and Kerman. There can be no two opinions as to the evils aris ingIII. arising from these administrative conditions not alone in regard to fiscal matters. It is not only that the division of jurisdiction exists and is inconvenient, but that boundaries are never well defined and Juris diction is constantly being shifted. Thus in the course of routine cases one is constantly confronted with the rejoinder: 'This is no longer my responsibil ity, the district has been transferred to so and so. I can do no more•. II. The order that all ports where export and import is permissible should be handed over to the Customs. This was a measure which when it was first commu nicated to me caused me a good deal of apprehension. Wds my telegram to the Minister) No.211 of 20th December, 1906,, It would appear, however, from the &amp;nd his reply. 'No.177 dated 21st ,, ,. ) present context that all that was f intended was that the Customs should in all cases be administered under the orders of the Belgian Director General and not under arrangements made by the petty local Khans.Ill, The comparative figures of the revenue of the cus toms of the South from Zitohkhan-il (1900-1901) to Yount-11 (1906-1907). Monsieur Hsus’ remarks under Loui-il (1904-1905) regarding the establishment of the Russian Line and the free transit granted through the Caucasus are interest ing. I have no means of checking Monsieur Nans' figuresi no doubt they are relatively correct. IV. The suggestion that imports into Muscat, Bahrein, and Koweit are gradually and abnormally increasing ow ing to the fact that they have become distributing centres for the insinuation of contraband tnrough the small ports of Persia. So far as Arms and Ammunition are concerned this suggestion is undoubtedly well founded as tne Govern ment of India are aware, and probably it is true though to a less considerable extent in the case of other highly taxed articles. I have in a previous report surmised that the reluctance of the Sheikh of Bahi ein to accept a very liberal offer from us, as a condition of our conducting his Customs Administration, is con nected with the existence of such a state of things, approaching that now indicated. I an asking our representativesrepresentatives at Muscat, Bahrein and Kowelt to make special enquiries under this head In connection with the submission of their Trade Reports for the past year. 5. As a remedy for the difficulties under which the Administration of the Customs of the South labours Monsieur Naus recommends a re-arrangement of Jurisdic tion along the Persian littoral, under which all the Gulf Ports from Mahoramerah to Gwettur will be brought under the direct control of the Governor of Bushire. He adds the sine qua non, that the Khans of Bunder Rig, Houdhilleh, Tanglstan and Dashtl (all in the neighbourhood of Bushlre) and Sirdar Saeed Khan of Gaih in Persian Mekran must be deposed and exiled. With these recommendations he couples the name of the Saeed-es-Sultaneh our new Governor and indulges in the hope that in him the Persian Government now have the right man in the right place. The collection of all the Gulf Ports under one Governor provided with the means at his disposal to control them would be a most admirable arrangement, but I fear that until Persia changes her spots. Mon sieurMonsieur Hsus' recoamendatlons will remain a counsel of perfection which it will be out of the question to carry into effect. As regards the present Governor, it is perhaps early to speak, but from what I see of him I doubt nis capacity for dealing with the situation and there are even grounds for suspecting his honesty of purpose, jjlg first step in the direction advocated has been to ask for a force wherewith to coerce the Khans of Bohilla referred to by Monsieur Nausj not to punish him for past misdeeds but in order to recover, I sup pose for his own coffers, a revenue assessment which is double what the district can legitimately produce and which the Khan could only pay on the assumption that he did make a large income from smuggling. The mere fact of asking such an amount of revenue from him, obliges him to smuggle. As to the expulsion or deportation of the Khans mentioned, and of Saeed Khan of Gaih, it seems futile to discuss such a project seriously under present cir cumstances for neither the Governor of Bushire, in the formerformer case, nor of Bampur, In the latter, are In a position to put It Into execution. 6. I conclude with a reiteration of the hope that having regard to the state of things Indicated in Monsieur Naus' communication, the question of ap proaching the Russian Government with a view to the joint revision of the Tariff, in the interests of the three Governments which were party to the Convention, may he taken into lively consideration.

Extracts from Letter of Proceedings. Dated Maskat, the 1st April 1907. From—C ommander H. W. James, To—The Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to report that on tho departure of H-M.S. 'Highflyer” from Gabrig on March 20th, I landed in company with lieute nant Baillie-Hamilton to ascertain if possible whether or not arms had been landed from tho dhow which had been examined the previous evening. 2. On reaching the dhow, I observed tracks of camels leading to an &lt;l [ r .° from her. I followed up these for a distance of 4 miles inland, and at this point they were lost among those of a number of camels feeding among the sand-hills. These were mostly females with young. 3. An old Baluchi was in charge of them, and I interrogated him through the interpreter. He could tell me nothing about the dhow, saying that his business was camel-breeding, and that he paid no attention to outside affairs. 4 I had little doubt that the arms had been landed the previous day just before our arrival, and this supposition was confirmed by your wireless message from Jask. 5. I returned to the ship at * p m., acting on information from you I weighed at 4 a.m„ next day and proceeded to Kas Jagin where I left a boat at the mouth of each Khor, then to Khor Lash, where I left another boat, then went on to Jask for further news. 6. About noon I received a message from the land line to the effect that the arms had been landed at Khor Lash during the morning of the 20th, but that they were only being removed that morning (the 21st). 7. 1 hoped that the boat I left at Khor Lash might have been able to stop them, but on picking her up, the officer in charge re P“ r ^ * ha , the a^ow the caravan leaving as he approached the entrance of the Khor, and, the dliow having left, be could do nothing. 8. I picked up the other boats and, it being now 9 A.M., anchored off Ras Jagin. ******* 13. On receipt of instructions from the Commander-in-Chief and from you, I have remained at Maskat. 14. One small dhow containing rifles and ammunition has left for the Makran Coast since our arrival here.6. With regard to local affairs, I was told that some of the tribes in the interior were in an unsettled state. Four tribes in particular, the Maqabil, Shamsi, Beni Qatab, and Badr tribes, have cherished a malcontent, feeling ever since they had been subdued a few years ago by the late Wali, Suleiman Sua- lim, a feeling which a respect for his strength has kept from any outward de monstration, but local rumour has it that in a few weeks’ time these tribes in tend to continue against the new Wali, Saalim bin Suleim. 7 . This information has all been given to the Political Agent at Mask at. Suggestions for checking the arms traffic to the Makran Coast. Dated Msakat, the 19th March 1907. From —Commander H. W. James, To— Captain C. S. Hickley, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit the following remarks on the arms traffic and the best methods of checking it; these remarks being of course based on my short experience of Maskat and the Makran Coast. 2. In my opinion the only practical methods of procedure arejas follows:— I. —The stoppage of the export of arms from Maskat. 3. This would seem to be now, or in the near future, comparatively easy to arrange, as I am informed by Major Grey that His Highness the Sultan of Maskat is becoming uneasy at the presence of Afghans in the bazaar at Maskat, and would probably be prepared to confiscate arms seized in his waters or on the high seas. 4. If, however, he is still disinclined to discountenance the traffic, it would he well worth while making good to him the loss in revenue which he would sustain by stopping it, with perhaps a douceur besides. 5. It appears that the only objection to this step is that it might slightly affect French interests. This, however, could surely be arranged when the u entente ’* is so firmly established at home. Failing this— II. —The establishment of posts at intervals along the Makran Coast. each post connecting with the land line of telegraph by camels or other means, and from which any movements of Afghans along the coast could be signalled to a patrolling ship at Jask or Charbar. 2. This, I think, would be a sound method and inexpensive. III. —Leaving guard boats at the different places commonly used by arms running dhows. 2. This would be useful as a preventive measure, but the boats could not be expected to capture the arms. Still more effective than at present. IV. —-Commissioning the torpedo boats now lying idle at Bombay, and making them patrol different sections of the coast, keeping a parent ship at Jask or Charbar. 2. In combination with II and III would be useful and less expensive in coal consumption than the present system. In conclusion. At present the information received from Maskat is so vague that it is generally hopeless to expect to act upon it with any chance of success. The information from the land line is usually founded on rumours, but is a fairly safe indication of where arms are expected. 52. All tint a ship can now do is to patrol the coast in the neighbourhood of the supposed landing place, stopping and searching all dhows met with. Some of these cannot be effectually searched without clearing the hold com pletely, and as most of them carry cargoes such as firewood, mats, etc., the operation takes a considerable time, and while it is being performed the real otfeuder slips through. 3. It is only by the merest chance that a capture can be effected, and I &gt; would submit that the consumption of ooal iu ships employed in this duty, as at * present performed, is not jnstirted by the results or possible results. 4. At night the dhows, none of whom carry regular lights, see a ship long before she can hope to see them, even if the ship’s lights are extinguished, and a night capture is very improbable. Further notes on the arms traffic. Dated Maskat, the 1st April 1907. From— Commander H. W. James, To— Captain C. S. Hickley, Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf. I have the honour to submit these further remarks on the arms traffic. 2. It appears that no definite information can be obtained at Maskat as to the final destination of a dhow sailing from there. 3. Their usual plan is to declare for Sohar. On arriving at that port they simply wait until they hear definitely that transport is ready for the arms on the Makran Coast. They leave Sohar so as to arrive at a pre-arranged place at nearly the same time as the Afghans with camels. 4. When a consignment of arms is ready to leave Maskat some of the Afghans concerned leave for Jask by Mail Steamer, and having arranged with the Chiefs at Old Jask about the disposal of the arms, return to Maskat and send them off. 5. The Chiefs from Old Jask join the Afghans some miles inland and the caravan proceeds to the arranged place and waits for the arrival of the dhow. 6. This has always happened on former occasions. The Old Jask Chiefs are well paid by the Afghans for their assistance. 7. A movement on their part coupled with a report that Afghans are coming down from up-country is, therefore, a sure sign that arms are expected. 8. The only reliable information to he obtained is from the Telegraph officials at Jask. Therefore a ship should keep in touch with that place by wireless or other means, and act on the information received from there. 9. This information is at present obtained by sending reliable men from Jask to wafr'h the Old Ja^k contingent when they leave and by sending telegraph operators from the different posts on the land line on camels to watch the Afghans. 10. As at present carried out this system procures news generally a day old or more, which in two cases at least in my experience was just 12 hours too late for a cnpture to be effected. 11. A more elaborate system of patrol from 15 to 20 miles inland from the coast connected with the land line of telegraph at various points, and coupled with posts along the shore from which signals could be made would probably get news in sufficient time. 12. When the Afghans are known to he moving to a certain place, a good plan is to leave two boats at the mouths of Khors and rivers in the vicinity, leuviiux the ship free to keep in touch with Jask. 6to himself and his staff, the operators from the different Stations having gone long distances by camel to seek lor news. 14 I would suggest that Mr. New should he officially thanked for t le trouble’ he has taken, if this has not already been done. 1 - The Persian Government appears to have ceased taking any steps in , 'hL of arm running The Customs officials have been removed from of patrols, etc.• f Poll- Covt' Extract from a A let tor fron Hajor P.

In forwarding the accompanying report from Lieutenant OgiT-iv^-® have the honour to say that I entirely agree with nis opinion that until a road or railway is made and the telegraph extended fron Bam to Bunder Abbas the Connercial importance of Bam hardly calls for a Vice-Consul there.Majost ’ s Consul, /.ernan, !tUf 11, dated’ B am t the 1&lt; th March 11 &gt;&gt;7. I have the honour to subnit the following report of the general results which have anEnr* accrued from my deputation as temporary Vice-Consul at Bam during the pasiTyea*# The objects for which I was specially deputed were x (b) to cope with t?ie illegal traffic in arms occasionally carried on by Afghans in Baluchistan and to submit reports on this subject. x 4 # i have already submitted a full report ol the otate of the traffic in arms which is occasionally carried on between tne Mekran Coast and Afghanistan. The information I gatnered during my y recent tour in Baluchistan enabled me to ascertain with almost absolute certainty the route generally followed by the Afghan smugglers, and I pointed out in my report that they use the desert track which lies to the east of the boh-i-Baznan , a dis tance of abQUt 130 miles from Bam. The impossibility of using Bam as a head-quarters of operations, against tnese smugglers it is hardly necessary for me to emphasize. It would doubtless be no difficult undertaking to put a stop to the smuggling were the .Afghans to pass through Regan, or within a reasonable distance of Nurmashir itsolf, but the fact that the jurisdiction of the Governor of Bam extends but sixty miles south-east of that place, andf '■Z and that the construction of the telegraph line into Persian Baluchistan has been finally abandoned, rendres the task of eliciting the co-operation of the local authorities in this direction one of impossibility, while the desert nature oi the country east of Regan is such that an adequate watch throughout its length is an undertaking of extreme difficulty, and one which would involve a large outlay. Beyond the immediate vicinity of towns no government or supervision of any description exists, and this, added to the fact that the country traversed by the smug gler.-, xa spar&amp;ely populated by nomad Baluchis, who are practically independent of all control, nullifies any efforts in the suppres sion of the traffic, which canjbe made by a British Officer sta tioned at Bam. I have already dealt fully with all the aspects of the case in my former report and can only repeat with all respect that this trade will not be effectively suppressed until a more 4 stringent oatrol is kept over the coast between Minao and Ohars&lt;&lt;r, - whether by His Majesty*s snips or the Belgian Customs Authorities. Under present circumstnnces it is hopeless to expect nn v real co-operation from the Persian Government. The late Governor-General of Kerman, who has the reputation of being one of the most en lightened of Persian Princes, displayed an extraordinary apatny * and lack of interest in regard to this subject, v.hen I discussed it with him, and his attitude is one which is reflected on all ! his subordinate Governors.QOS MDENTIAL. r Sir Edward Grey to Sir C.

Sir, T beg to submit the ioblowing report on the facilities for the Arms Traffic from Muscat to the Riyaban Coast between Pas al Kuh and Khor Kunari. I regret that bad weather delaying ay arrival at tne latter place has reduced the time at ay disposal for investigation of the coast, and my observations had to be rather nurried. gjt appears to me that as one goes northward irom Pas ai Kuh, the advanta &gt;es of the Biyaban coast diminish rapidly; even Khor Kunari would, I think, only be used as a last resort and I doubt if any arms would be run to places further north. For one thing good weather conditions are required for the traffic and the longer the run the greater chance of these conditions not lasting throughout the voyage (as occurred to me). No sedan could have mad; any headway against the shaual I encountered. B,- Khor Kunari is a very large Khor, but no habitation visible; the country for many miles north and south seems to be an immense mangrove swamp intersected with turnerous creeks right up to the hills some 5 or 6 ..dies inland, at the xoot o vhich T saw some smoke. At the entrance to the Khor were the marks of camels, these may have brought down firewood for gulf vessels who come, I believe, to these mangrove swamps for the sake of obtaining firewood. Altogether T was not struck with Khor Kunari as a likely place for the importation of arms when other places further south are feasible, ™ Senior Naval Officer 4.- 14. - I could do little examination oi the coast between this place and Ras al Kuh, as the shoals OiT Ras as Shir and the unsurvoyed state ol' that neighbourhood would necessi tate slo” and careful going, but it seems possible teat in lino weather ^rtis uigb t certainly be deposited on the beach south of Has as Shir; the country looks fairly flourishing, the natives are agricultural and camels would probably not be difficult to obtain. 5. - I landed at Ras al Kuh and it appears to me that tnat is the spot which affords the greatest j.aciUties for landing arms, fheru is a Klior to the southward of Kuh i Uabarak A x,, hich is quite navigable for these bedans, terra firma instec of iianr.rove swamp for them to land tieir cargo, hills close to the shore from which a look out could be kept, camels easily obtainable, and the distance from Old Jashk (where it is kno v, n that Afghans arriving from Muscat per Mail repaid is barely HO milos. T am very much of the opinion that t ils place is known ?uad used by bhe Afghans. The night I lay at anchor off Ras ai Kuh a fire was lighted on the top of the hill marked the 'Quoin', to the northward. I a^ of the opinion that there must have been some object in this fire as there is little on the hilltop that wouli burn and the people who lit it must have gone to some trouble to take fuel up from the plain below. It is about the best hill for signalling purposes, Kuh i Umbarak wouli be better but for the fact that its submit is inaccessible. A vessel lyin at, Ras nl Kuh would command that coast and is only H or 4 hours away from the telegraph station at Jxhk. I have, etc.... Walter rose Lieutenant Comuiandcr.PERSIAN GULP DIVISION.

Major Grey was unable to ooocnp-’ny oe, but before T left requested me, in addition to making enquiries re the arias traffic, to gather any information that might be to hand respecting the condition of the interior, particularly as regards Rustag and the Beni Qatab rand Maqabil tribes. 2.- On arrival at Sohar I received a visit fro,_ tho akhid, I!'ssun by name, ’'ho wan in charge of affairs during the absence of the V/ali Saalim bin Suiioaan, on a visit to Shinns. I ''as told the tfaii had gone to that place to see it any of the ^eni Qatab tribe were there, and if so to order them out of the Sultan’s territory. B.- r landed at 9a.u. and was very hospitably received by the Akhid, but he was exceedingly reticent as to focal affairs. T then visited two dindoo Banyans — Kishoo and Khnkn, the latter of whom farms the customs of Sohar. T found them willing to give any information I required. It seems that Kishoo has some large claims against local Arabs and requires tne assistance oi the Political agent to recover them. T told him I would state his case to Major Grey. At tie same time I told him that T required information on certain matters and requested him to answer my questions as fully as possible; T think the information obtained from the Banyans is reliable. Senior Naval Officer,IZo C 4.- Concerning the araa tratric I think I way safely say that beyond getting passes from the Sultan of Muscat to sail for Sonar (in order to hide their real destination), that port is not in any way used by Arms Runners to the Makran and Persian Coasts, Nothing was kno’-n of any cargoes that have left Muscat, nor of any expected to leave, and there 4 are no riile merchant6 resident i i the place. I was in- xoiued that a lew rifles were at tiaes brought into the place from Uusca^itie Morohan-s v no brin ^ them stay a day or t o and when they have sold ns many as they can to the local people, they carry the remainder oi their goods into the interior to try and find purchasers among tn..

On arriving nt that port they siiaply wait until they hear definitely thot transport in ready for the anus on tie Mekran coast.

The Old Jask Chiefs are well paid by the Afghans for their assistance. 7 .- a movement on their part coupled with a report t.oat Captain C.S.Hickley Afghans Senior Naval Officer, PERSIAN GULP.Afghans are eouiing down frou uo eonntry is therefore a S!&gt;re sign that arms are expected. 3*- The only reliable information to be obtained is fron the Telegraph cifieiils at Jaok. Therefore a ship should keep in touch ,,,r ith that plaee by wireless or other iucans, and act on the inioi-aation received from there. oTills iifor lotion is at present obtained by sending reliable non iron Jask to watch the Old Jask contingent ’•'hen they leave, and by sending telegraph ooerators from the d-fferent posts on the lanl line on ca els to watch the Afghans. 10. - iis r *t present carried out this system procures news generally a day old or .ore* which in two oases at least in uy experience was just Id hours too late for a capture to be effected. 11. - A more elaborate syste . of patrol about 15 to ^0 uiies inland fro . the coast connected connected with the land line of telegraph at various points, and coupled with posts along the shore from which signals could be unde would probably get ne r? s in sufficient time. 13.- When the Afghans are known to be ...oving to a certain place, a good plan is to leave beats at the mouths of Khors and rivers in the vicinity, leaving the shin free to kc p in touch with Jask. 18.- T vr ou 1 d like to piint out t v nt we hnve hitherto relied upon iir Hew, Director of the Land Telegraph for our information.

Having just passed through the Xarwan district I have the honour to submit a report on the traffic in arms carried on by Afghans on this coast and to confirm the recent information given in telegraphic reports on the subject# 2# We have had to depend on the Line guard in charge of the telephone at Bapoh for information, which I fear, has been exaggerated as regards the number of Afghans on the coast and the number of camels collected by them, but their intentions and movements to Khunarak and thence to Sadeoh river have been correctly reported. There are about thirty Afghans on the coast who are undoubtedly awaiting the arrival of arms from Ivlaskat but they have not as yet bought many camels and at most possess a dozen animals# They have given out their intention of paying good prices for camels when they require them, which shows they are rather doubtful of success# The capture of s boat containing arms about three months ago has created a scare amongst boat owners at ilask&amp;t and on this ooast on whom the Afghans are entirely dependent for the conveyance of arms# They are also frightened by the presence of His Majesty's ships and I hear they are refusing to carry arms at any prices offered# This source of conveyance constitutes a weak point and perhaps it would prove an effective check or at least harass the Afghans, if a warning were issued to Maskat boat owners trading with this coast, stimulated by a Judicious enlarge ment upon the risks and punishment in the event of capture# 3# I reminded to Karwan Chiefs of their promise to assist in putting down the srme traffic and they assured me they wsre doing their utmost to drive out the Afghans from their district# -naiifa Khair Muhammad has moved from Karkinda in y, . ■/■ / the* tli« Karwaa listriot to Saringi in the Loshar district under Graih, a point near tha iialaear hills shout thirty miles north east of Xarkinda.

Unfortunately things have gone so far that Persian authority in those parts is almost nominal. The Baluchis simply ignore the Persians : the Governor of Bampur told Lieutenant Ogilvie that though he had been over two months in his post not a single Baluch Sirdar had been to pay his respects. His Royal Highness told me that he had with great difficulty got 50 Werndl rifles from Tehran for the force which he was sending to Baluchistan, and these he gave to the party who are protecting Mr. King-Wood and his party. I did not see any of the rifles, but they probably have not been cleaned for years and are practically little better than the old muzzle-loaders of the other Sarbazes. On the other hand, almost every Baluchi is armed with a modern breach-loader which he keeps with the greatest care. It is only the fact that the Baluchis are so split up by old feuds among themselves that enables the Persians to collect such revenue as they contrive to now, and they understand that the raising of any question, such as disarmament or a serious check to the arms traffic, would unite the Baluchis against them and bring about a situation with which they would be helpless to deal. We are not likely to have a stronger Governor-General than His Royal Highness and when he declares his inability to stop the traffic and says that it is for the English to stop it at the coast, I am afraid that any practical co-operation on the part of the Persian authorities is hopeless. This question like almost every other in Persia cannot be solved until there are roads and proper communi cations and a general opening up of the country which would follow there upon.

I have the honour to state that I have completed a tour in South-east Persia and Persian Baluchistan and to submit the following report thereof for transmis sion to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. 2. In accordance with instructions received from the Foreign Department, I left Bam on the 21st November 1906 and reached at Regan on the 23rd November. At Regan I overtook the Persian force which was going to Baluchistan to coerce the various Baluch tribes who are refusing to pay revenue to the Persian Government. I left Regan on the 26th November and crossed the desert without incident, traversing the usual route which lies to the west of the Koh-i-Bazman. I found that all the nomads who inhabit this deso late tract had fled to the hills around to avoid the Persian force. I reached Fahraj, which is 16 miles east of Bampur, and is the seat of the Government of Baluchistan, on the 6th December. Here I met the Akram-al-Saltaneh, Governor of Baluchistan, with whom I had previous acquaintance. He received me with the greatest cordiality and hospitality and I stayed at Fahraj four days. The Gover nor was very ill and could not rise owing to the fact that his foot was in a terrible state of ulceration, and rapidly growing worse, I applied a few simple3 S^ipeiy^th referencTto ^^‘TrmtsmugglS m Ueal C wkh this subject Mlv below I left Fahraj on the I ith December and after a march of six day cK VagatlnKd three n ° t as n k I h 'u sirdars q is an active smuggler himself whenever he can get the np^pp with the British Government for his past misdeeds, and with this o j i, 5 SX' Th, country t*,. f n M.g.s and ; » • » lz! sr.jSte^JrjSSS it, J51SS2K '=« tw „rr SX.. otL £ p “pi.»&lt;r •» [''«■«'*» “■«*■ t ssL..

He gave me ai y c: r/ 4 ar inioi Khan Kurd, followed by the smugglers when once passed Bampur. I 1 Bazman routes followed by me to the Intelligence Branch. 3 . The main objects for which 1 performed the tour were two in number, (1) to obtain information about the rifle smuggling occasionally carried on by Afghans ; and ( 2 ) to search for a suitable place in Baluchistan for the summer head- quarters of the Vice-Consul at Bam. . , , ^ , With regard to the former, 1 had several conversations wuh the Coventor of tzr s 12“ »“ e tr zr, %, E t..!» ™ &lt;f« 2 r rr,.r g'22 “s Government °f ln&lt; | a . u ‘ of he himself was i n possession, anT^hlthhere is no more information to be gained in Bampur from the and that there is no 1 f enquired as to the route followed by thTsmug'glerslrom the coast to Afghanistan; this question is at least settled*4 All my informants were unanimous in declaring that the smugglers, having load ed up their rifles at the various obscure fishing hamlets on the coast, move as quickly as possible north and pass about 40 miles east of Bampur, i.e, between Gazak and Kuchagardan. They then enter the Dasht-i-Tbahaf which lies bet ween the Koh-i-Bazman and the Siahband range, and striking the Seistan track at Shoraf move along it due north past the Koh-i-Taftan, finally crossing the border at some place in Seistan, They go neither by Regan on the west trot Khwash on the east, as seems to be the general misapprehension. A sketch map is appended to illustrate the route given above. This route is the shortest and is desert ior its whole length. It is possible to wander for days among these wastes without meeting a human being. I mysetf have on two occasions march ed in a straight line in these regions for five days without seeing any signs of •habitation. I asked the Governor of Bampur why he was unable to stop these smugglers moving about through his administration, and he replied without hesi tation that he could never hear of their approach until they were otft ctf his reach and that the only occasion on which he did obtain information about them m June 1906 when a large caravan of smuggled rifles passed through Gazak 50 miles east of .Bampur. He ordered the Asad-ud-Dowleh, the Persian General in Baluchistan, to stop the caravan, if possible, but when a force of Persian Sarbazes was sent against them, the Afghans displayed so threatening an attitude that the Persians, fearing to risk their lives, allowed them to go on their way. The two considerations which militate against the effective extinction of this traffic are, in fact, the disgraceful state of communications in Persian Baluchistan and the inability and unwillingness of the Persians to resort to extreme measures, if necessary. The Persian forces in Baluchistan consist of 400 Sarbazes and a ^battery of obsolete artillery. Of the infantry 100 men are at Bampur, 100 at Fahraj, 16 miles east of Bampur, and 200 are generally engaged under the Persian General in extracting revenue from defaulting Sirdars and tribes at the point of : the bayonet. They are, from a European point of view, contemptible as an organised military force, and though possessing enough of the rudiments of discipline to overawe the Baluchis, who are too disorganised to unite, are quite helpless in face of a resolute enemy such as the Afghan smugglers. The smugglers always move in compact bodies of not less than 100 men, all excellently armed, and would be a match for thrice their number of the badly armed and cowardly Persians. The other great difficulty to be considered is that the Persian authorities never obtain information of the approach of smuggling caravans until the latter are out of their reach. Bampur is distant 12 days* journey from the telegraph office at Bam and 15 days from Charbar, and it is quite impossible under present circumstances to transmit timely information to the Governor. On December 28th when l was at Fahraj, I received a telegram forwarded from Bam which informed me of the landing of a small batch of rifles on the 20th October, 40 days before. It will be seen that this information is utterly worthless after the lapse of so long a period, and that nothing could be done in that particular instance. The state of the roads if it is possible to call stony tracks among the hills by that name, the sparsely populated nature of the country and the friendly attitude of the inhabitants towards the smugglers also militate against the speedy transmission of news. While I was at Bazman, Sirdar Kamal Khan whom I mentioned above, told me that he had been watching for smugglers proceeding up the Dasht-i-Tahaf for a whole year and that no -caravans of rifles had passed. As, however, it is known that some two or three caravans have passed within 20 miles of Bazman in the last year, his services do not seem to have been of any great value to the Belgian Custom authorities in Seistan. This is merely another proof of the difficulty experienced in obtaining information t&gt;f the approach of the smugglers, when once they have left the coast. The Baluchis themselves are the chief offen ders in the smuggling traffic. Every village in the whole country is stocked with every imaginable style of and firearm, many of them of excellent make. All Sirdars smuggle enough for their own needs at every opportunity when they can do so with impunity. Their attitude towards all smugglers, whether Baluch or Afghan so far from being hostile, is most friendly. The chief offender in this respect is undoubtedly Sirdar Saeed Khan of Geh, who, though he is a Nazim of Persian Mekran and is always ready to protest his willingness to stop the traffic, in reality encourages and profits by it; but he is only one of the many who„. ae : n t ho traffic. The Persians themselves recognise that this indiscriminate ^,jl|in&lt;r and wholesale rearming of the population of Baluchistan cannot be Scial to their own authority and interests, but they seem to be jus as P erless to stop their own subjects from smuggling as the Afghans It is, powerless to s P k ' h „ k; d of arms and ammu nation are h 0 rv V rav b™commg m C o e xpensL and difficult to obtain and the measures 6 tin ^ the coast are producing some effect. The Sirdars, both of Magas un d e c a tbaz informed me of this in casual conversation.

Monsieur Naus’s note deals both with the question of contraband trade in the Persian Gulf in general and with the illicit traffic in arms in particular, and while it may be taken for granted that he makes the most of a brief which was clearly the sequel to the recent upheaval in the Bushire Customs, culminating in the exit of the Derya Begi and Monsieur Heynssens from the Gulf stage, and while I am not in a position readily to test the detailed accuracy of his figures, there is nevertheless no doubt whatever that his statements are generally speak ing well-founded, though somewhat overdrawn. In forwarding the papers to me the Minister observes that we are deeply interested both in the suppression of the Arms Traffic and in the maintenance of the Customs Revenue of Southern Persia, a fact which the Government of India will readily endorse; but in the second connection I should explain that the re markable impetus giving to smuggling during the past two or three years, which has frequently been drawn attention to by this office (e.g., Bushire Trade Report for 1905) is nothing but the immediate result of the enhanced Tariff accepted by us in the Commercial Convention of February 9th, 1903, and it would surely be difficult to conceive a more forcible indictment against that Tariff than this part ing jeremiad which the late Minister of Customs has left on record. In my Administration Report for 1905-06, when referring to the prevalence of smuggling, I expressed the opinion that under the existing conditions of ad ministration there was no remedy for the state of things reported short of a re turn to an all-round 5 per cent, ad valorem duty. Since then Monsieur Heyns sens, Monsieur Constant and Monsieur Waffelaert, while successively in charge of the Customs Administration of the Gulf have each of them expressed them selves to me to much the same effect, and, speaking with full knowledge of the local conditions and possibilities, say they are convinced that the alteration of the Tariff even to an all-round 6 per cent, duty would make the smuggler’s art a profitless risk and result in a large increase in revenue from the Customs of the Gulf Ports. I venture to hope that the excellent opening afforded to us by the terms of Monsieur Naus’s report to the Grand Vazier will be made the most of and that it may be considered possible for us to use it as a lever with which to bring about the reconstruction of the Tariff, a measure for which, in view of the gradually ripening entente between ourselves and the Russian Government, and the generally precarious condition of the Belgian Customs Administration pursuant to the dismissal of Monsieur Naus, the present juncture seems eminent ly favourable. 3. Before proceeding to offer any comment on any of the details of Mon sieur Naus’s statements and recommendations, I trust I may be pardoned for digressing for a moment, in order to say a few words in favour of the Derya Begi, who has been connected with the Bushire Government on and off for the last 20 years and has on the whole been the most friendly Governor we have had.

Monsieur Heynssens I know always believed that His Excellency was the deus ex machina of the plot or agitation recently got up against him by the Mul- las and populace of Bushire, and it is only natural that in vindicating his subordi nate and his administration the Minister of Customs should make the most of available material in stating his case against the Derya Begi ; but as I read his vehement impeachment of the late Governor I cannot help remarking how times2 f It have changed since Sir Arthur Hardinge, addressing the Foreign Office in his Despatch No. 31-Commercial of June 1905, regarding the previous agitation of April and May of that year, wrote ; “ I hear from a confidential source that Monsieur Naus in a report to the Vali Ahd (the present Shah), dated 3rd instant, informs His Imperial High ness that the agitation at Bushire has subsided, but that the Prince Governor- General of Pars is alleged to be reviving it at Shiraz. His Excellency in this report speaks in very eulogistic terms of the Derya Begi, the present Governor of the Gulf Ports.” 4. Much might be written regarding many of the points raised in Monsieur Naus’s comprehensive exposition of the existing position in the Gulf, but as I start 'with the belief that most of his statements are well-founded, it will perhaps be sufficient if I take the salient features of his remarks and recommendations seriatim and add such brief comment as seems called for. /.—The division of jurisdiction over the Fars and Mekran Coasts between the Governors of Bushire, Shiraz and Kerman. There can be no two opinions as to the evils arising from these administra tive conditions, not alone in regard to fiscal matters. It is not only that the division of jurisdiction exists and is inconvenient, but that boundaries are never well defined and jurisdiction is constantly being shifted. Thus in the course of routine cases one is constantly confronted with the rejoinder, “ This is no longer my responsibility, the district has been transferred to so and so. I can do no more.” //.—The order that all forts where export and import is permissible should be handed over to the Customs. This was a measure which when it was first communicated to me caused me a good deal of apprehension.* It would appear however from the present context that all that was intended was that the Customs should in all cases he adminis- not under arrange- • Vide iry telegram to Jthe Minister, No. 211 of Fowarded to the Government o( 20th ^December 1906 India with Residency No. 3076, and his reply, No. ’ 77 , dated J3rd December 1906. dated 21 St December 1906 . tered under fhe orders of the Belgian Director-General and ments made by the petty local Khans. III.—The comparative figures of the revenue of the Customs of the South from Zitchkhan-il (igoo-rgoi) to Yount-il (i 906 -igof). Monsieur Naus’s remarks under Loui-il (1904-1905), regarding the establish ment of the Russian Line and the “ free transit ” granted through the Caucasus are interesting. I have no means of checking Monsieur Naus’s figures ; no doubt they are relatively correct. IV.—The suggestion that imports into Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit, are gradually and abnormally increasing owing to the fact that they have become distributing centres for the insinuation of contraband through the small ports of Persia. So far as arms and ammunition are concerned this suggestion is undoubtedly well-founded as the Government of India are aware, and probably it is true though to a less considerable extent in the case of other highly taxed articles. I have in a previous report surmised that the reluctance of the Sheikh of Bahrein to accept a very liberal offer from us, as a condition of our conducting his Customs Administration, is connected with the existence of a state of things, approachingthat now indicated. I am asking our representatives at Muscat, Bahrein and Koweit to make special enquiries under this head in connection with the submis sion of their Trade Reports for the past year. 5. As a remedy for the difficulties under which the Administration of the Customs of the South labours Monsieur Naus recommends a re-arrangement of jurisdiction along the Persian littoral, under which all the Gulf Ports from Mohammerah to Gwettur will be brought under the direct control of the Governor of Bushire. He adds the sine qua non, that the Khans of Bunder Rig, Roudhilleh, Tangistan and Dashti (all in the neighbourhood of Bushire) and Sirdar Saeed Khan of Gaih in Persian Mekran must be deposed and exiled. With these recommendations he couples the name of the Saeed-es-Sultaneh our new Governor and indulges in the hope that in him the Persian Government now have the right man in the right place. The collection of all the Gulf Ports under one Governor provided with the means at his disposal to control them would be a most admirable arrangement, bat 1 fear that until Persia changes her spots, Monsieur Naus’s recommendations will remain a counsel of perfection which it will be out of the question to carry into effect. As regards the present Governor, it is perhaps early to speak, but from what I see of him I doubt his capacity for dealing with the situation and there are even grounds for suspecting his honesty of purpose. His first step in the direction advocated has been to ask for a force wherewith to coerce the Khan of Rohilla, referred to by Monsieur Naus ; not to punish him for past misdeeds but in order to recover, 1 suppose for his own coffers, a revenue assessment which is double what the district can legitimately produce and which the Khan could only pay on the assumption that he did make a large income from smuggling. The mere fact of asking such an amount of revenue from him, obliges him to him smuggle. As to the expulsion or deportation of the Khans mentioned, and of Saeed Khan of Gaih, it seems futile to discuss such a project seriously under present circumstances for neither the Governor of Bushire, in the former case, nor of Bampur, in the latter, are in a position to put it into execution. 6. I conclude with a reiteration of the hope that having regard to the state of things indicated in Monsieur Naus’s communication, the^ question of approach ing the Russian Government with a view to the joint revision of the Tariff, in the interests of the three Governments which were party to the Convention, may be taken into lively consideration. A copy of this letter is being forwarded to His Majesty's Minister at Teheran, for information. EMPIRE DE PERSE. ADMINISTRATION. de la CAISSE IMPERIALS.

Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To— Sir Louis Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to trouble Government with another contribution to the correspondence on the subject of the Arms Traffic to the Mekran Coast. 2. By last mail I forwarded informally, direct to Captain McConaghey, in the hope that they would reach him ( 1 ) Arms Report from Persian Mudi rat Chai- ^ ^ me ^ p ersona l reference when dealing with the Baluch Mirs at the coming Border Meeting at Peshin, the papers marginally detailed, of which I attach copies and solicit perusal. It is interesting to follow the record in certain of the items included in the Tabular statement, especially the second case. Here the following stages may be noted : Firstly. —The Clerk in charge of the Telegraph Station at Charbar reports to the Residency on information supplied by the Mir of Kair that a consignment of 400 arms, etc., has been landed at Gurdun to the order of Bahram Khan, cousin of the Chief of Geh. Secondly .—Sardar Said Khan, Chief of Geh, sends a specious report to Charbar that he has heard of the consignment and has sent his representative to capture it. Thirdly. —The said representative of Sardar Said Khan reports to Charba that he has unfortunately missed the consignment but has gone after another. Fourthly. —The customs employ^, Mirza Mahmood Khan, after investiga tions at Kasarkand, reports to Bushire, in the communication now forwarded, that Said Khan’s retainer, in spite of his denial, did actually come up with the arms ; and then goes on to give cireumstantial details ot the passage of tie consignment through the Chief of Geh’s hands, after a division of h ackmail between him and the Assad-ed-Dowleh of Bampur, amounting in all to about Rs. 20 per rifle. Mirza Mahmood Khan, as Captain MeConaghey says, may not be a reliable character, but it is difficult to suppose that the details of his report, which fits in with the others received previously, are entirely devoid of foundation , and I think the presumption is, as it always has been, that the local Mira, from Said Khan downwards, notwithstanding the undertaking to Captain McConaghey of 26th May last, are fully informed of the movements of the smuo-o-ling caravans, and lose no opportunity ot‘ using their position to 1 y Wackmaii on them in transit. At all events so far as the Persian Govern, meat is concerned, Mirza Mahmood Khan is their selected employd in con nection with the Arms Traffic and they are therefore bound to give due weight to his official reports. 3. In connection with this Mekran Traffic it has been found very difficult to locate many of the villages mentioned in the local reports or to trace ® passage of the consignments through the country, owing to the fact that t information given in our Survey Sheets of this region is very scanty and that what further details we have are so scattered about m various notes and o&lt; reports that it is no easy matter to lay hands on them when wanted. In hope of remedying this difficulty until such time as the Survey Sheets are amplified or redrawn, I have the honour to forward, in original, a plan of the country under reference, including all details of villages available. o preparation of which I am indebted to my Second ^tent Lieutenant Birdwood, who has been at much pains to compile it with as much relative accuracy as is possible in a blend of information gathered irom di and maps on various scales. If the Government of India are pleased to haw e it expeditiously fair-printed and reproduced, I feel sure from personal experience 3784 F. D.that it will prove useful for reference for the time being to all officers to whom the ramifications of the Arms Traffic are a matter of official concern. 4. The most cursory examination of it accentuates the geographical importance of Bampur (or Geti) as a radiating base for the control of the traffic and for keeping in touch with the vagaries of the Baluch Mirs of Persian Mekran. According to present information the western route from the coast, vid Bamisk (or the neighbourhood) and Regan, is at present hardly used at all by the smugglers and in any case it would seem that our representatives, respect ively, at Bunder Abbas through an Agent at Minab, and at Bam through Regan, working in with an officer at Bampur, could keep sufficiently close watch on the western route in question. A Corps of Levies with head-quarters at Bampur and small outposts at convenient spots on the line Jalk-Sarbaz-Kasarkand-Geh and Binth or Karwan, could effectively close the country. I fear, however, that in the present chaotic condition of the Government of Persia it is useless to hope that the latter will undertake any scheme of the kind themselves, and I pre sume that at present it is politically impossible for us to do so. Some such measure might however become practicable under any settlement of interests affecting Southern Persia. But apart from that remote contingency, although I am aware that the location of a Consular Office at Bampur has been impracticable in the past owing to the inconvenience of meeting the retaliative claim of the Persian Government for a Consular post at Quetta, it seems quite reasonable, with the present evidence to hand of the complicity of the Mirs of Persian Mekran in the Arms Traffic and the general inability of the Persian Government to maintain order in that region, that we should take the opportunity to place an officer, as a present permanency, on special duty at Bampur to watch the Arms Traffic ; and, if the introduction of the name of Bampur is likely to revive the question of the Persian Consular post at Quetta, the British Officer appointed might make his headquarters at Geh or Kasarkand or such other spot in the neigh bourhood as on further investigation might prove the most suitable for residence, after Bampur. 5. In proof of the parlous attitude of the Persian Government in regard to the Arms Traffic, if any were wanted, I may well quote from two recent communications from the Directors-General of Customs at Bushire,— (a) Demi-official letter from Monsieur Heynssens, dated 29th November : “ I had proposed to bring the other (launch) to Bushire for watching over the Tangistan and Rudhilleh coasts, where the Arms Traffic as well as tea-smuggling are actually of the greatest importance to the Persian Uovarnment. However as it seems to me that the Persian Government do not like to stop those contrabands now, I have no objection, etc. 5 * (b) Demi-official letter from Monsieur Constant, Director-General of Customs, in temporary succession to Monsieur Heynssens, dated 5th January 1907 : “We are tired of informing Tehran of the smuggling of arms and dutiable goods carried on not only through the ports of the Mekran Coast but also and much more, through the small ports close to Bushire. ,&gt; These remarks were not of course intended for me to use, but they show clearly what the position is. 6 . Finally, I would observe that if, as appears to be the case, the black mail levied on the rifles with the complement of ammunition amounts to about Rs. 20 per weapon, any scheme for subsidising the Baluch Chiefs would obviously have to be framed on an exceedingly liberal scale to be in any way effective. 7. l am forwarding a copy of the Customs Mudir’s report to His Majesty’s Consul,.Kerman, in case he may be able to enlist the active interest of the Governor-General in the suppression of the traffic.3 TELEGRAPHIC RE FORT.

I was at Kasr Kand before the receipt of the telegram from Bushire. The son of Hoot Shir Mohamed Zabit of Sirkan and four Sarwanis who were owners of arms secretly arrived in the house of Sirdar Saeed Khan at Kasr Kand. The son of Hoot Shir Mohamed informed Sirdar Saeed Khan that 400 rifles, 40,000 cartridges etc., had been landed at Sirkan by a boat from the port of Gurdim and that he would release them if he (Sirdar Saeed Khan) gave him permission or would confiscate them if he wished him to do so. Sirdar Saeed Khan reported the matter to the Asaad-ed-Dowleh, Governor. They conferred secretly and afterwards sent ^bout 10 camel-sowars with Haji Mirza Pishkar of Saeed Khan and Jan Mahomed Khan to Sirkan to confiscate the arms. The aforesaid officials stayed at Mahal Koochek and brought the arms to Booyeh hy order of Sirdar Saeed Khan and they reported (to him) in writing that they had seized the arms. The Asaad-ed-Dowleh in consultation with Sirdar Saeed Khan at once sent his uncle Nasrullah Khan Sultan with secret instructions. After messengers had passed several times between the afore said officials and the Governor and Sirdar Saeed Khan, it was settled through the instrumentality of Nasrullah Khan and Haji Mirza that Rs, 1,200 should be paid to Sirdar Saeed Khan on account of duty, Rs. 6,000 to the Asaad-ed- Dowleh with 4 rifles, Rs. 250 with a donkey to Nasrullah Khan, and fts. 150 for the rest. After receiving the (above) amounts, Haji Mirza furnished the owners of the arms with papers (bearing Sirdar Saeed Khan’s seal) to the effect that no one should molest them on their way and the Sirdars of Bahu and Dashtyari should afford them assistance. Sirdar Abdi Khan and Sirdar Ahmed Khan have given them the utmost assistance. They had paid the (above) amounts to the Governor and Sirdar Saeed Khan in ingots of gold which they had with them. They had also paid gold at Maskat. They had taken these^ steps in secret thinking that I was not aware of them. I was, however, learning their proceedings and intentions hour by hour. Moreover, Mirza Mehdi Khan Sarhang and Haji Kasem Hyderahadi who were accompanying the Asaad-ed- Dowleh used to report (their proceedings) to me day by day. From what I have ascertained and what seems to be true, the arms were intended for trade purposes and not for the Khans. 2 . (Videca.se 3 of tabular statement, 2nd report.) One hundred and four rifles had been landed near the port of Parag. I was apprised (of this). Before I could take any steps, Hoot Shir Mohamed reported the matter to Sirdar Saeed Khan. Haji Mirza with 10 sowars left for (seizing) the rifles. I also sent for camels to prevent (his confiscating) the arms, but the Governor had ordered that no one should supply me with camels. After three days Haji Mirza brought to Kasr Kand 104 rifles, 9 donkeys, 450 rupees in cash, 10,000 cartridges and 10,000 percussion caps with 5 men who owned them. It was the intention of the Governor and Sirdar Saeed Khan to receive bribes and release the arms I however made strong re presentations and took a receipt from the Governor for 98 rifles and 9,000 cartridges. He denied (the existence of) the other 4 ( 6 ?) rifles and secretly exchanged some of the rifles and forwarded them to Bampur at once.3. (Vide case 8 of tabular statement, 2nd report.) Twenty-five rifles belonging to Bichoo Zidgal arrived from Koor Kihdef. I was at Dashtyari and on being apprised of it, took measures to prevent (the importation of) the arms. Asaad-ed-Dowleh prevented my getting camels and I wanted to move on foot. As the arms were not far away from the Asaad-ed-Dowleh’s house, he immediately sent Sirdar Saeed Khan who seized the arms with the owner. After the confiscation of the arms, they (owners) paid through Sirdar Abdi Khan Rs 1,000 to the Asaad-ed-Dowleh, 1 rifle and Rs. 750 to Sirdar Saeed Khan on account of duty, and 1 camel to Ali Akber Khan, Deputy Governor, and were released. I pressed the matter with the Governor. He replied that this (report) was untrue and that he would seize the rifles and deliver them to me. He is, however, telling a lie. 4. ( Vide case 1 of tabular statement, 2nd report.) As regards the 150 rifles which had been brought by Sirdar Saeed Khan from Dezak, I heard that the Asaad-ed-Dowleh has taken 2,000 tomans and sent a testimony to Kerman that this was not a true fact. Three orders had been received from Kerman, under my care, one for Sirdar Saeed Khan and two for the Governor. They did not pay any attention to these orders from Kerman and gave various replies thereto. It is necessary that through the medium of Tehran very stringent orders should be issued from Kerman and all the monies, rifles and bribes received by the Governor and Sirdar Saeed Khan be recovered from them. If the requisite steps are not taken in regard to the above rifles, it would not be possible to prevent (importation of) arms into these ports. All the Sirdars have given stringent undertakings to Captain McConaghey and the Customs Department. A special “ Maamoor ” of Sirdar Saeed Khan recovers duty on the rifles which may arrive at Galeg, Rapch, Puzam, Bodieh, Kanarak Doom and releases them there. The Governor and Sirdar Saeed Khan have acted most irregularly in this tour for arms. Rigorous measures are required on the part of the Customs Department. MIRZA MAHMOOD.

I have the honour, with reference to the enclosed copy of correspondence, to draw your attention to the fact that I have already remarked on the limited nature of the means at Mr. Ogilvie’s disposal for the purpose in question, 2. I also beg that it may be brought to the notice of the Government of India in justice to Mr. Ogilvie himself that the caravans conveying the smuggled arms avoid, as far as possible, the routes ordinarily travelled. Mr. Ogilvie informs me that he is arranging to have the routes in the Narmashir district watched, but if, as I am informed, the caravans in question strike across the desert, such precautions are evidently of little avail. Mr. Ogilvie is under the impression that such action as he has taken in this matter may be considered insufficient ; 1 sincerely trust that this may not be the case. 1 am informed probably correctly that these caravans are accompanied by a strongly armed escort, and they are at any rate carefully left alone by the local authorities, who, if their aid was called for, would not I think be inspired with much additional confidence by the rein* forcement of six Beluch levies and an English officer. I agree with Lieutenant Ogilvie in his view that when such caravans have left the coast the present resources are useless for the purpose of interception of the arms. 3. The Governor of Bampur has been communicated with both by the Governor-General of Kerman and I find by Mr. Ogilvie himself, but for the reason above stated I expect little from him. Any information gained, however, as to the methods adopted by the smugglers will be most useful if and when measures on a longer scale are undertaken. Mr. Ogilvie states that he would proceed to Bampur himself, but he considers that it would be worse than useless to leave Bam, where he is on the wire, for the deserts where he would be cut off from any further information which might be received, and from all outside communication.

I's Vice Consul ^ain,dated the 1st August 1906,to H. B. 1's Consul at Kerman. (Forwarded under cover of a letter from the Political Resident in the Persian Oulf Po. C1C3 dated the 9th September 1906.) I have the honour to submit, for transmission to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, the following report in which I propose to deal with the various matters in connection with which 1 have been appointed temporary Vice- Consul at Bam for the space of six months. 2. The objects for which I was deputed, as enumerated in a letter No. 1176-E. A , (Confidential), from the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department to the Officiating Resident in the Persian Gulf were— XX X X (£) to cope, as far as possible, wdth the illegal traffic in smuggled arms which is carried on through Persian Baluchistan ; and ^ • ■ • * x X ' x 4 . I propose to divide this report into two main heads xx x x (b) the position of the town of Bam with regard to the protection of the Bunder Abbas-Kerman trade route followed by the rifle smugglers in Persian Baluchistan. xx xx 6. In addition to Vice-Consular w r ork in Bam itself, my duties include the prevention, as far as possible, of outrages on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman and Minab-Regan trade routes, and of the illegal traffic in arms carried on by Pathans in Persian Baluchistan. The tours necessitated by these duties can only be carried on in the winter months. In the summer months the heat along the trade routes is so terrific that the robbers disappear into the mountains and the routes are left practically unmolested. The same considerations induce a temporary cessation of the arms traffic. The robberies and outrages on the trade routes occur most frequently I understand, at those points where the roads cut the boundaries between the province of Kerman and those of Laristan and Fars, a distance of 160 miles from Bam, while the routes followed by the Pathan smugglers lie to the east of Bampur and in Sarhad, a distance of 200 miles from Bam. It will, therefore, be seen that the distance between these two points is nearly 300 miles and that to work at both places is humanly impossi ble for a single officer. In a country where communications are so primitive as to be almost non-existent, and where the only transport available is camel transport, it is utterly impossible to carry on operations at points so widely distant in the space of six months. If such were attempted, then there would be no leisure for a Vice-Consul to remain in Bam at all during the cold season, which is the only part of the year in which he might possibly find some work to do in Bam. There appears to be an impression that Bam is on or near the line followed by the Pathan smugglers, but this is absolutely contrary to facts. The smugglers would as a rule never dare to come through Narmashir, and there Js absolutely nothing to be gained by them doing so, for the route through Sarhad is both infinitely shorter, less frequented and wdth abundant water; none of which advantages from the smugglers’ point of view can be claimed by the Regan-Lut route. At Bampur is a garrison of 400 F’ersian soldiers, but any one who has experience of Persian soldiery knows that 400 dummies would be almost as useful as these miserable creatures. The communications in Baluchis tan are so unspeakably bad that large caravans, when once they have left the coast, can travel without any fear of interference, even if such interference were contemplated by the authorities, and with the utmost secrecy. J he true facts of the case are that the authorities have no power to do anything. \\ hen once passed Bampur the smugglers have only to avoid Khwash, where is a ‘ Hakim 1— 3SS with 3 soldiers, and they have then a clear space, practically uninhabited as far as Seistan. The only really efficient method of checking this traffic would be to have some system of coast guards with a certain amount of organised force be hind them, but this is, I fear, impossible under present circumstances. 7. It will be seen from the above considerations that Bam is quite unsuitable, as regards its geographical position for the prevention either of robberies on the Bunder Abbas-Kerman route, or of the rifle smuggling in Baluchistan. — i ——*— —*— ■ ATelegram No. S.-20, dated the 27th August 1906.

C269FD 1Extract from Kandahar Diary for the week ending 31st July 1906, A caravan of 14.0 camels, with about 2,000 rifles brought from Maskatside entered Afghanistan via Girdi and Kala-i-Kang near Chakansur in the begin- ning of June 1906. The caravan was engaged by, and in charge of, Mukhmad (or Muhammad) and his'cousin Durani Kharotis, having some 60 more Afghans Kharotis, Nasirs and Miankhels—as shareholders. About two-thirds of the rifles were taken by Durani towards Herat via Farah and Sabzawar. About one-third of the rifles were brought here. Mukhmad Kharoti took about half of it towards Mukur and Ghazni, and the rest were kept here to be sold locally. The rifles they brought were long barrelled breech-loading rifles like snider rifles, having no number or marks. The price fetched here for such a rifle was Es. 185, but the caravans are said to have got some rifles of higher price also. It appears that every facility is given for such trade or traffic in arms by the Afghan officials. The rifles are sold here as English-made ones, because the Afghans much like the English-made rifles. The rifles are taken throughout the interior of Afghanistan and sold to all classes of men in general. A separate report has also been submitted to the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-Gen eral under instructions received from him. No. 665 (Confidential), dated Ziarat, the BSrd August 1906.

Dane, K.C.I.E., C.S.I., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla. In continuation of my letter No. 645 (Confidential), dated August 17th, 1906, I have the honour to submit, for the information of the Government of India, the enclosed copies of letters dated July 27th and 28th, 1906, from Khan Bahadur Mirza Yakub Ali, British News-writer at Herat, regarding the caravan conveying arms which passed from the Persian coast into Afghanistan in or about June last. 2 . The confiscation of some of the weapons which the News-writer reports as having taken place at Bunder Abbas has not been mentioned in previous accounts received regarding this caravan, the arms destined for which were not landed at Bunder Abbas, as far as is known. Ihe only loss that those engaged in this venture have suffered, as far as my information goes, is the confiscation of camels in the possession of Afghans concerned in the trade which was effected by Captain McConaghey in British Mekran in Eebruary- March, 1906 (paragraph 3 of my report quoted above). But it is not certain that the information which I have supplied is exhaustive and it is possible that some action may have been taken regarding consignments of guns at Bunder Abbas or elsewhere which has not yet been noticed. Translation of letter dated the 27th July 1906. From—K han Bahadur Mirza Yakub Ali Khan, British News-writer at Herat, To— -The First Assistant to the HonTle the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. I beg to acknowledge the receipt of your office letter, dated the 23rd June 1906, about a caravan of 150 camels having left Eapch on the Persian Gulf Coast with about 1,000 rifles. 2. On the 26th July 1906 a big caravan of Lohani Afghans, belonging to Kharoti, Suleman Khel and Taraki sections, arrived here. They have about 180 camel-loads of goods with them and state thut they purchased more than one thousand guns from Maskat and came here through Persian territory via Bunder Abbas where some of their guns were confiscated. They have des- 3 C269EDr * i patched some guns to their homes in Ghazni, Karabagh and Mukar. The rest they have brought to Herat and these are of three kinds, namely 1 . Martini Henry carbines. 2 . Ditto rifles. 3. Sniders. They are selling a carbine with 80 cartridges for 800 krans and &amp; Martini- Henry rifle and a snider, with a similar number of cartridges, for 500 and 450 krans, respectively. The frontier people are, however, quietly purchasing the last mentioned two classes. The caravan men say that such of their guns as will remain undisposed of they will carry with them to Dahla and Mizem Mahals of the Kandahar District, via Sigah Band, Nozad and Zamindawar and thence to Kalat-i-Ghilzai, Mukur and Ghazni, for sale. Some of these men are said to be residents of British territory. The other articles they have got with them are sugar, turmeric and pepper. They managed to pass their guns from the various ports by concealing them in sugar boxes. They are very sorry for the loss they have suffered by the confiscation of some of their guns at Bunder Abbas. According to their statement some camel loads of their rifles have also been left behind which will arrive here shortly. They have no guides as they are themselves well acquainted with the routes by which they have come. They are not showing to the people all the guns they have with them. ^ They have been engaged in the trade in arms for the last five years and have earned much money. I am making further inquiries about them and any further particulars regarding their movements, places of residence and names which will come to my knowledge will be reported to you. Translation of letter dated the 23th July 1906, from Khan Bahadur Yakub Ali Khan, British News-writer at Rerat, to the First Assistant to the Kon'ble the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan. In continuation of my letter of the 27th July 1906 on the subject of the guns imported into Herat via Bunder Abbas I beg to state as follows One of the caravanmen who have brought the guns is called Mehrban and is said to be a resident of tbe Quetta-Pishin District. Another, known as Taj Mohammad is a resident of Mushki, a suburb of Ghazni, and a third, named Nauroz, belongs to Karabagh in Ghazni. . I am trying to find out the names of the others and will communicate the same to you hereafter. The guns already despatched by these men towards Ghazni, Karabagh and the borders of Kabul were sent via Chakhansur, Anardara, Kili-Koh and Parah District.

Two Martini-Henry carbines were reported to have been brought into Mahsud territory and to be with the Brumi Khels. They were sent for and were brought in. Both were carbines sighted to 1,000 yards, one marked on lock plate “ Maushallah ” and on the barrel 4 5 and “WP on the 4 C269PD Maskat5 I * It side of the barrel, the other marked with a small lion and sun on the lock plate R A and S / on the barrel.

Gulhek, Sir, 28 th July (received j/s/ August) 1906 . With reference to my telegram No. 285 of the 24 th instant, I have the hon our to enclose a copy of correspondence with the Persian Customs Department regarding the recent importation by Afghans of a large consignment of arms. It would seem that the Persian Government and Monsieur Naus have confus ed the general question of the fraudulent importation of arms by the Persian Gulf with the particular case at once brought to their notice on receipt of Cap tain Macpherson’s telegram No. 118 of May 3 rd last. In any case the result would have probably been the same. The Belgian Customs officials are few in number and To m. Naus, May 3 rd 1906. although usually willing to give assist- To M. Naus, |une 6 lh 1906 f* ^ ^ U From m. Naus, June 17 th 1906 . ance to suppress the traffic they have not the means at their disposal really to take efficient measures to deal with the evil. 1 need hardly remind the Gov ernment of India that outside Tehran, Isphan and a few of the larger towns, gov ernment in the European sense of the word practically does not exist. There is no armed force worthy of the name and unless local tribesmen care to take up the matter in hope of plunder no effectual steps could be taken to check smuggl ing, if the smugglers are well armed and determined. Possibly when M. Naus has received the launches now building for the Persian Government at Bombay something may be done by the Belgian officials to check the arms traffic. But there is no present likelihood of the Persian Gov ernment taking the slightest trouble to put an end to it. Even if they really desired to do so I doubt if they have the power. I have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient humble servant; (Signed) E. GRANT DUFF. The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, M, E. Grant Duff t A. S. E. M. Naus.

They have brought a large number of rifles concealed in sugar boxes from Muscat via Bandar-i-Abbas and state that a few camel-loads have been left behind and will arrive here shortly.

'While at Wabul oeveral Afridis were found in various regimental linec endeavouring to buy arms and ammunition and some were arrested but were let go after a couple of days’ detention. 'Hot very many rifles were purchased this year by Bridie. firstly, as great precautions were taken by the regimental officers to prevent sepoys selling their arms, and secondly, as Hazir Safar informed us that certain Afghan traders had made extensive purchases of Gulf-rifles and these were expected to arrive in Kabul by the beginning of winter, when a good Martini Henri rii^e would then oe purchasable for Es. 50 Kabuli, i.e.. Es. 25/-. We told him that the 'Sultani' carbines, which came up last year m from the Gulf, and had the 'Kalima” inscribed on them, were not good as several had burst in Tirah while in use, tut he said that rifles, and not carbines, were expected and of a very much better type, and that all had been • carefully tested. We made private enquiries to verify this and learnt that Afghan traders 'nad really made extensive purchases of rifles at the Gulf and were^^arranging to bring tliem up to Habul witli tlie Anir's permis sion. Clie only fear the traders appeared to have was that they might be intercepted on the road. Gulf rifles reach Kabul every year and are exposed for sale in the open market. I saw several hanging up in shops and I purchased one myself for which I paid 38. 230 Kabuli. I have brought this rifle with me. Zarghun, Saidu and Sher All, Kuki Khels, purchased one rifle each of the same type as mine, and I believe several Orakzais also bought rifles, but I do not know how many, nor can I give their names. In all only about 10 breech-loading rifles were purchased by ixfridis. One of these was purchased by a cousin of Sarghun Kuki Khel of Kadam. It is an English-made Hart ini-Henri for Which he gave Hs.500/- Kabuli• 4 'In the expectation of the arrival of the Gulf rixxes the ifridis who went up to invest in nnns abandoned the idea of doing so owing to the high rates prevailing and they decided to postpone their purchases until winter.

From—The Hon’ble Mr, A. L, P. Tucker, C.I.E., OfliciatiDg Ageut to the Governor- General and Chkf Commissioner in Baluchistan, To— Sir Louis W. Dane. K.C.I.E., C.S. I., Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. It will be remembered that at the close of December 1905, shortly after the conclusion of my tour in Mekran, I reported to the Government of India that news had been received from Maskat of the recent landing of considerable Quantities of arms and ammunition on the Perso-Baluohistan coast west of Charbar. I suggested that the deputation of Captain F. McConaghey, Assist ant Political A^ent for Mekran and Commandant of the Mekran Levy Corps, who was then in the neighb mrhood of the Persian border, to tour in the areas in Persian Baluchistan where this traffic was reported to be in progress, might form the subject of a communication to the Persian Government with reference to the informal arrangement arrived at on the subject of this traffic, by Lieute nant-Colonel H. L. Showers, the Political Agent of Kalat and the Firman Firma of Kirman and Persian Baluchistan on March 8 th, 1902. My sugges tion was based by Captain McConaghey that he should be deputed on this duty, which w as duty of a very arduous and delicate kind. ^ 2 I had about the same time in my letter No. 6 -C., dated December 30th, | 1905, forwarded to the Government of India a report regarding this traffic based on such information as I could collect on my tour m Mekran. 3 The Persian Government had intimated their intention of sending a special official to deal with this important matter early in January 1906, and it was understood in February that Reza Unsoli Khan, the Customs Inspector of Bandar Abbas, had been deputed on this duty. It was thought desirable that an officer on our part should be deputed to co operate with this officer. With this object in view I suggested in February that Captain McConaghey should proceed to Barapur and meet the Persian delegate there and thus be enabled to concert with him and with the Governor of Bampursome method of dealing with this dangerous traffic. The Governor of Bampur at the tune was in communication with our Nazim of Mekran on the subject of the arms traffic, the current development of which was known to the local authorities on both the British and Persian sides of the border. The Governor intimated that he had issued orders for the stoppage within his jurisdiction of Afghan Kojilas found with arms (it was to these Kafilas laden with arms for Afghanistan that attention had been mainly directed). He added., however, that the persona in charge of such Kafilas would never give up their arms without fighting, in the meantime we had some evidence, within British Mekran, that prepaiations for the despatch of further caravans with arms from the coast were m progress. Captain McConaghey arrested in Mekran a party of 23 Afghans who were found there purchasing camels and who could give no satisfactory account of themselves. These men were deported from Mekran and sent to Karachi. I should mention here that there is no evidence that the consignments of arms which are destined for the Mekran coast are landed on the British coast hue east of Gwetter. The Mekran administration under the Nazim, Mir Mehruila Khan, C.I.E., is able to prevant the landing of ^ such consignments and their despatch north through British Baluchistan, as is the administration of the State of Las Bela. The trade seeks the Persian coast line: not ours. 5. Captain McConaghey returned to Quetta in March 1906, and conferred with Major Showers and myself, regarding his proposed deputation. He was instructed to proceed to Charhar and confer there with the Persian delegates who had by this time been appointed and were Reza Gull Khan and the Ittila- ud-Daula, the Karguzar of Muhammerah. The former however was not immediately available and Mirza Muhammad, the Madir of Customs at Bushire was substituted for him. I was still anxious that Captain McConaghey and the Persian Representative shou 1 d proceed inland to Bampur and there concert with the Deputy Governor measures for arresting the traffic. It was clear C238FD2 that if the representatives remained on the coast at Charbar or elsewhere their deputation would be of little use to either Government, since the main object was to ascertain the land routes used in Persia and to make arrangements for their closure. In view of the Governor of Bampur’s intimation, which coincided with information already available regarding the likelihood of armed resistance by armed importers, and the general conditions of this wild and uncivilised part of the country, it was necessary for Captain McConaghey to take with him for his personal protection a camp following and guard of 25 of his Mekran Levies who are not regular soldiers. Captain McConaghey was also accompanied by Sardar Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, one of the principal Sirdars of Kalat Mekran, who is well known to the tribal headmen and Surdars on both sides of the border. 6 . Captain Me Conag hey’s proceedings on his deputation are described * No. 17-c., dated June itth, 1906 , (with aocom- ^ report* a copy of which, with the pa + 1 No n i 6 i, dat-ed August nth, 1906 . 1 olitical Agent in Kalat s forwarding letterf, is attached. Ti e transmission of the report has been delayed by the recent transfer of charge of the Kalat Agency from Major Showers to Major Benn. 7. It will be observed that Captain McConaghey reached Charbar on April 15th, marching there by land from Pasni. At Charbar be met Mirza Mahmud Khan, Mudir of Customs, the representative of the Persian Government whom I have already mentioned. Acting in co-operation with him and accompanied by him he marched to Tank, Galag and Rapch on the coast west of Charbar, where the representatives entered into communication with the Saad-ud-Daula,* Governor of Bampur. At Charbar the news of the recent departure from Kharwan of a large Kafila of Afghans was received. This was the caravan with arms regarding which I addressed the Government of India under my letter No. 989-C., dated May 4th, 1906, regarding the de tination of which and the route which was to be followed Captain McConao-hey was able to give us early and very correct information. I think that it must be a matter of regret to the Government of Persia as well as to that of India that this caravan was not inte cepred at the various points where in its long journey through Persian territory to the Afghan border at Band-i- Kanoal Khan it might have been captured. The capture of so lar^e a con signment would have proved as great a blow to this illegal and dangerous trade as its successful passage will prove a stimulus and incentive. °Later Captain McConaghey met the Saad-ud-Daula at Geh in the neighbourhood of which place he was engaged in coercive operations against one oAhe tribes. On May 16th an affray occurred between some of the Governor’s Sarbazes and the following of the Mudir, Mirza Mahmud Khan. In this there was a danger that Captain McConaghey's men would be involved. So serious a complication however was avoided and I think that Captain McConaghey is entitled to^ the greatest credit for the successful manner in which he dealt with the situation. The Saad-ud-Daula reached Rapch on May 25, where Captain McConaghey and the Mudir had preceded him. There an agreement was entered into with the headmen of Kharwan, which has clearly been the point inland where those engaged in the conveyance inland of successfully run cargoes collected, by which they have bound themselves to he responsible tor stopping the landing of arms between Charbar and the posts of Sadich This agreement has been subscribed by Sardar Saiad Khan of Rapch in Persian Baluchistan, who describes himself as holding the Nizamat of Persian Baluchis tan; by the Mudir, Mirza Mahmud Khan as representative of the Persian Government ; and also by Captain McConaghey. It has been subscribed also by the Ittila-ud-Daula, Karguzar of Muhammerah, the second representative of the Persmn Government, who has the authority of his Government to deal wi it general question of the arms traffic, and who reached Charbar earlv in June. J ^ 7. Captain McConaghey returned to Charbar on May 30th, and there his proceedings in respect of his special deputation may be said to have termi nated. At Charbar the business of the annual border meeting for the settle ment of cases between British and Persian Baluchistan and of cases affecting3 British subjects on the Persian Mekran coast then supervened. The proceedings of the meeting of the representatives of the two Governments there have not yet reached me: they will be submitted to the Government of India as soon'as they are received. 8 . Captain McConaghey has been able to furnish an account (appendix C) of the recent development of the trade. This shows that that portion of the trade which is conducted by Afghans was considerable in 1904-05 and was planned on a larger scale for the winter of 1905-06. Only one with arms for Afghanistan is known to have left Kharwan this season and that is the one which I have mentioned. There is a small trade on the coast by local traders who sell the weapons to local inhabitants and a larger one, w hich has recently increased, conducted by local inhabitants who supply the various tribes of Persian Baluchistan. Some of the weapons, as we know, come across our border into the Kharan country. It would not seem that this trade extends into Afghanistan : for this last the Afghan Knjilas are specially intended. The Sardars and their tribesmen in Persian Mekran are w^ell armed with weapons presumably procured from local sources (Captain McConaghey’s appendix H) The presence in the country of so large a number of breech-loading weapons must greatly impair the authority of the local officials of the Persian Govern ment. Captain McConaghey has also furnished a useful description of the arms and ammunition in which the trade is carried on (Appendix P). As to this I observe that several of the rifles are of English make, a firm designated by the mark F. R. C. Birmingham ” being one of the chief manufacturing firms. Ihe cheaper weapons are of Russian, French and German mmufac- ture&gt; lbe most appreciated weapons are the Martini-Henry rifles and carbines and the ammunition for these is supplied by Messrs. Kynoch. As to this I invite attention to paragraph 8 of my letter No. 6 -C., dated December 30 th 19 °o Captain McConaghey has also supplied a list of the harbours and routes used by the trade (Apdendix B) and a short account (Appendix D) of the small Afghan settlement m Karkhindar of Kharwan. I should mention that the barawan that Captain McConaghey mentions should not be confounded with the Sarawan tribal area in Kalat with which the Government of India are larailiar. Ihe Saravvan country of Persian Baluchistan is that to the north ot Bampur. 9. Captain McConaghey’s recommendations for the future are that he or some other Baluchistan officer should be permitted to tour again in Perso- Baluchistan next winter in connection with the measures to stop this trade, and that some form of pecuniary reward should be granted or promised to the principal Sardars on the Persian side. Sardar Saiad Khanof Bapch and ir Islam khan of Bmth, if they are successful in ther efforts to stop the rade and can make the agreement of May last an operative agreement. It is to be noticed that the Sardars are reported to he gainers pecuniarily by the trade, and that the landing of arms on the coast is apparently authorised, as tne 1 ersian Customs officials have been known to levy duty on imported rifles tap tain McConaghey touches also on the difficulty that the officers of the ersian Government experience in enforcing their authority in this remote and wild part of Persia and suggests that the Assistant Political Agent for JueKran could take more efficient action if the entire political control of the porder and correspondence with the Bampur Governor and Sardars were placed in ins hands. He suggests also that cases from the Perso-Baluehistan littoral ? the border meeting might with advantage be placed before th! p eetin £ h 1 ? 1 ; As to these two last questions I shall be able to address vl e ,T 7 e ? 1 r nt . 0f Irldia as soonas 1 have considered the last Charbar meetina- nJi - f 1 i n0t s ^» est tbat our Government should attempt to enter into any intormal or other understanding for the reward of the Sardars mentioned wblfn ti r. 0f ^ he ' reat 1 ment of the Af g hau settlement at Karkhindar, as to • apt ^ M J? Cona S h ey promises further information, is one for the con- he™!T i° f tbe Pe f ian Government. It is clear that the settlement should e watched and that steps should he taken to prevent its use as a rendezvous caraxr 5 ^ anS J eD8aged J m the trado ’ wll ° come tothis neighbourhood, collect avansand are ready to proceed north as soon as cargoes of arms have been4 landed. I notice that the Customs authorities are reported to be making pre% parations for the establishment of four posts at points on the coast west of Charbar. The establishment of these posts will be an advantage, more parti- cularly if lar?e steam launches are provided and systematically used in the open season for patrolling purposes. I think also that the establishment of inland posts by the Persian Government in Perso*Baluchistan at selected places is also a step the desirability of which is clearly indicated. 10. Captain McConaghey’s report confirms the continuance and increase of this dangerous trade and is evidence that much may be effected towards its discouragement by concerted action in Persian-Mekran between representatives of the Persian Government and a deputed British officer. Persian Mekran is clearly the country which the trade seeks, or through which it passes, by routes which at present are not under adequate control. It is as much to the advantage of the Persian Government as our own to make them so. As to the definite advantages likely to follow from concerted action I hope that this report makes it clear that had concerted action, with proper escorts, been taken when it was first suggested in December 1905, the trade might have received a severe blow. The next Charbar meeting is to take place in the cold weather. I strongly support Captain McConaghey’s recommendation that his own deputa tion may be then renewed and that he may be authorised to tour again in Persian Baluchistan, acting with a representative of the Persian Government, with instructions to report further regarding the traffic and to suggest measures for its repression, including the development of those whicli are understood to be in hand, and to assist in his discretion in their execution when called on to do so by the Persian representatives. 11 . In spite of the great heat and the various difficulties that presented themselves, Captain McConaghey has performed the task assigned to him with a good measure of success. The task was one that demanded great endurance, physically, and also much patience and tact. The good conduct of the men of the Mekran Levy Corps who accompanied him bears witness to the success ful work which Captain McConaghey has done in training the corps. I commend his services while on this important deputation to the very favour able notice of the Government of India. The good work done by S irdar Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, and Munshi Ghulam Murtaza Khan I shall be able to recognise suitably. No. 161-C., dated Mastung, the 11th August 1906. From— Majok R. A. E. Bknn, I.A., C.I.E., Political Agent, Kalat, To— Captain A. L. Jacob, 1. A., First Assistant to the Hon'fcle the Agent to the Governor-General in Baluchistan, Ziarat. I have the honour to forward the accompanying report of Captain McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, on the subject of his special deputation to enquire into the illicit traffic in arms on the Persian Baluchistan Coast. 2. The report describes in detail Captain McConaghey’s journey from Pasni to Charbar and thence to Karwan, his meeting after much difficulty and delay with the Deputy Governor of Persian Baluchistan, the agreement he was able to conclude with the Governor, Sirdars and headmen of that province to check the local illicit traffic in arms, and finally the measures he proposes for the future adherence by the Persians to the terms of this agreement. 3. The following points in the report appear to call for more special notice :— (i) The participation in the traffic in arms not only of the leading Sirdars and headmen but of the Governor of the Province also, and the universal igno rance displayed of any orders prohibiting the traffic. Captain MoConaghey attributes this to the fact that the trade in arms is a source of profit both to the Sirdars and headmen, who realize 1 to 3 dollars as commission on each rifle as well as to the Governor himself wffio not only winks at but encourages it. In paragraph 12 of the report an actual case is quoted in proof of this.(ii) The Durbar held at Rafch by Sadud Dowlah, the Governor of Persian Baluchistan on 27th May. Prior to this Durbar on the 9th and 10th May, Captain McConaghey had already been able to prove to the Governor that although he was in the neighbourhood and had received distinct orders to stop this traffic in arras, he had not only made any effort whatever to arrest the last Afghan rifle caravan which had left Karwan only a short time before but had not even issued orders to his subordinates to intercept it. On this the Governor appears to have realized his responsibilities and at the Durbar above mentioned gave strict orders to the leading Sirdar Said Khan, and all the headmen of Karwan, that the importation of arms into the harbours and seaboard between Charbar and Sadich was in future strictly prohibited. #A endix An agreement* which bears the signa tures of 13 headmen of Karwan, of Sirdar Said Khan, Mirza Mahmood, Mudir of Customs at Charbar, and the Governor of Persian Baluchistan was then concluded and subsequently the document w r as countersigned by the Itila-ed-Dowlah, tho Representative of the Persian Foreign Office for Baluchistan and Seistan who had been specially appointed from Tehran to assist in the enquiry. The terms of the agreement perhaps cill for remark. It will be noticed that the only stipulation made is that the signatories shall be responsible for stopping the landing of rifles on the coast. Nothing is said as to their liability to intercept the rifles when landed. Assuming that the landing were prevented traders would doubtless move on to some other place of landing and finally carry out their operations. It is also not mentioned how landed arms, if intercepted, are to be dis posed of. (iii) The traffic in arms carried on by Afghans on the coast is of compara tively recent date. Captain VtcConaghey states it was inaugurated only three years ago and that the principal tribes engaged in it are at present Nyazais, Nasais and Khattaks from the neighbourhood of Ghazni. During the past cold season, three consignments of rifles were successfully landed ; one in December 1905 and two more during March and April 1906. From December 1^05 to the end of March 1906 Captain McConaghey states that “ the Afghans appear to have met with no success,” but he refrains from expressing any opinion as to the reason for this. Captain McConaghey thinks that the successful lending of the last two consignments, one or both of which are now known to have safely reached its (their) destination on the Helmand xid Koh-i-Malik Siah will act as an incen tive to further endeavour. (iv) Captain McConaghey states that the number of rifles in Persian Balu chistan was estimated by the Governor to be 30,000 ; but he admits that the number is probably exaggerated and quotes in support of this that out of a total of 500 men who formed the Sirdar Said Khan’s following only one half were armed with rifles. On the other hand, he states that, especially in Karwan, the local inhabitants are almost all in possession of a rifle of sorts. The cheap price at which the old military pattern Russian, French and German rifles can be pur chased renders it possible for the poorest inhabitant to possess one. The weapon most appreciated is stated to be the Martini-Henri rifle and car bine, but among the more wealthy the *303 carbine is now gaining great favour. (v) Captain McConaghey gives an interesting account of the Afghan Mulla known as ‘ Khalifa ’ and the active part he plays in the traffic in arms carried on by the Afghans in Karwan. Paragraph 11 of his report and Appendix D deal with this man in detail. Captain McConaghey is at present only able to prove against the Khalifa that he has been in the habit of giving his moral support to Afghan rifle traders; but promises that a further report will be fur nished. There is no doubt that this man’s presence in the country encourages this illicit traffic, and I venture to think that the Persian Government should be called upon to arrange for his deportation before the next cold weather sets in. (vi) The Persian Customs Department propose to establish Customs posts a^ong the coast, but no great reliance should be placed on this. Not only have C238FDtheir previous efforts in this direction failed, but it is against the interests oL the local Sirdars and headmen to block in this way the main avenue by which their profits come. (vii) With regard to the future Captain McConaghey thinks that our main endeavour should be to stop this Afghan trade at the beginning of the next cold weather. He recommends that two measures should be adopted to ensure the terms of the recent agreement being kept (a) That he or any other selected British officer should tour through Persian Baluchistan during the next winter season. (3) That the two most important men in Persian Mekran, viz., Sirdar Said Khan and Mir Islam Khan of Binth, should be bought over by us. As regards (a), assuming that the Persian Government would acquiesce, which is perhaps very doubtful, I am of opinion that Captain M&lt;;Conaghey himself would be the most suitable officer to depute for the work. Failing this I would suggest that the Director of Persian Gulf Telegraphs whose other duties demand his periodical presence at the coast ports should be deputed to make local enquiries and if possible tour inland during his tours. The Persian Government could raise no objection to such an officer entering Persian terri tory. I would also suggest that Mekrab Khan, Gitchki, should be deputed to accompany the Director on such occasions as he has a wide experience of the local Sirdars and could doubtless assist the Director by secret enquiries. As regards ( 6 ) there is I think no doubt that the Persian Government would object to our taking their local Sirdars into our pay. Moreover, I doubt if the payment of two men only would bring about the desired result. Other headmen would want to be paid and there would be no end to the de mands on our purse. Again, being Persians, I do not think even these two selected Sirdars could be relied on to act up to their engagements. Like any other Persian, they would in all probability take our money, and still pass the arms through and thus make a profit in two directions. Captain McConaghey proposes, however, to pay by results. In the first place I do not think the Sirdars would accept such terms and in the next it would he difficult to prove whether they had stopped the traffic or not. (viii) The note on this illicit traffic supplied by the Commander of His Majesty’s Service “ Lapwing ” will be read with interest He considers that owing to insufficient patrolling of the coast the Agents who run the traffic in arms enjoy an immunity from all risks, which greatly encourages the trade. He is also of opinion that the subsidy of the Sultan of Maskat, where the main source of supply is to be found, should be increased on the understanding that the enhanced subsidy would only he given to him if he effectively prevents the exportation of arms from his territory. It is pre sumed that the importation of arms into his territory is also meant. This is a suggestion with which I feel I am not calk'd upon to deal; it would, however, appear to strike at the root of the present evil. In this connection I would point out that the only prohibition hitherto imposed on the Sultan of Maskat seems to have been that be should not import arms and ammunition into his Mekran dependencies and on 3rd March 1890, His Highness issued a proclamation to this effect (vide your office endorsement Ho. 429-Confidential, dated 12 th October 19JO). No steps ever appear to have been taken to limit the import ation of arms into Maskat or their exportation from that place. Captain Mc Conaghey supports the view that more efficient patrolling of the coast between Charbar and Jask is necessary. (ix) Paragraph 20 of Captain McConaghey’s report deals with the question of the position of the Assistant Politioal Agent in Mekran in whom it is suggested that the entire political control of the border should be centred. As the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General’s orders contained in Mr. Wood’s Confidential letter No. 484-C., dated 14th July, are clear on this point I do not feel justified in reopening the question,7 (x) Captain McConagliey brings the names of Sirdars Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, and Munshi Ghulam Murtaza Khan to notice for the excellent work done by them not only during his recent tour but for some time past. I am unfortunately not in a position to speak of these men from personal experience as I have only quite recently taken over charge of this Agency ; but there seems to be no doubt that Sirdar Mehrab Khan by reason of the exceptional influence he commands along the border has rendered invaluable assistance to Captain McConaghey while Munshi Ghulam Murtaza in the face of many difficulties has also rendered valuable service. I trust the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General will be pleased to recognise the good work done by these men. 4 . I would beg to bring to the notice of the Hon’ble the Agent to the Governor-General the further example of the good work which is being done by Captain McConaghey in his capacity as Assistant Political Agent in Mekran. Captain McConaghey was especially deputed to carry out enquiries into this illicit traffic in arms and his present report, I think, justifies his selec tion for this important work. His report is both interesting and instructive and has been carefully compiled. It will, I venture to think, prove useful to the Government of India. 5 . In conclusion I venture to add that this subject would no doubt have been more ably treated in the hands of my predecessor and that it would have been more satisfactory had it been possible for Major Showers to dispose of it before his departure from this Agency. I feel that his unique experience of the district and his intimate knowledge of the coast and border tribes of Persian Mekran rendered him more fitted than myself to deal with this important question and his opinion would have been of*the utmost value to Government. I would take the liberty of suggesting that even now the report might be submitted to him for favour of his views. No. 17-C P., dated Camp Charbar, the 15th June 1908. From Captain F. McConaghey, I.A., Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, To—-The Political Agent, Kalat. I have the honour to forward the following detailed report of my spec : al deputation to enquire into the illicit traffic of arms on the Persian Baluchistan Coast. 2. I left Pasni on the 3rd April. My party consisted of the men men tioned in the margin. At Daood-i-Mach, close to Gwadur, the Wali of Gwadur paid me a friendly visit and, as usual, was most anxious to offer assistance. I crossed the border close to Gabd on the 11th and then marched along the southern portions of Bahu and Dashtyari. On hearing of my arrival in Nigor, Mir Abdi Khan of Dashtyari rode in to see me and accompanied my camp as far as Gorankash. Finally I arrived at Charbar on the morning of the 15th. This portion of the march presented no difficulties. Owing to the good rains of the two past years water, grass and camel grazing were abundant at all the camping grounds. Mr. Fernandez, Inspector of Peraian Cnatoms. Sinlar Melirab Khan, Gitchki, and foUowers. Munshi Ghuiam Murtaza Khan, Head Clerk. Mekran Levy Corps. Jemadar Juma Khan, with 15 sowars. 10 camel sowars. 10 Infantry. 3. At Charbar, I was met by Mirza Mahmood Khan, the Mudir of Cus toms, Charbar, who had received orders to hand over to Mr. Fernandez and to accompany me on deputation in place of Baza Quli Khan, regarding whose movements nothing definite was known, thougli he was reported to have left Tehran months ago. On the 16th, I discussed the whole question of the arms traffic with Mirza Mahmood Khan, Two plans were open to us :—( 1 ) To march direct to Karwan and to ask Sadud Dowlah Murtaza Quli Khan, Governor of Persian Baluchistan, who was reported to be at Geh, to meet us there. ( 2 ) To march first to Geh and then to Karwan with the Governor. I decided to adopt the first for the following reasons :— (1) At Charhar I had heard that a large * Kafila * of Afghans had recently left Karwan and I wished to give the Governor no opportunity to excuse himself for not stopping the same. (2) I was afraid that on arrival a Geb, I might be kept there indefinitely. (3) In the event of any other arms being landed, I hoped that a favourable occasion might offer itself for their capture. Happily as events turned out, this was the better plan of the two, although no occasion for the capture of arms offered itself. 4. On the morning of the 18th, I left Charbar accompanied by Mirza Mahmood Khan. At Parag, Khir, Bir and Bandini I was met by the leading headmen of each place. A visit was paid to the small harbour of Tank. On arrival at Galeg two large boats, which had been unable to get away to Maskat on account of the rough weather, were anchored in the creek. These were promptly seized by the Mudir as they were loaded with ghi, etc., on which no duty^had been paid. In addition there were seven Afghan passengers. Finally on 25th we reached the small telephone station at Balak close to the banks of the Rafch river. 6 . At Rafch, there was no news of the Governor nor any reply to our letters sent from Charbar. Both the Mudir and self wrote again to the Govern or urgently asking him to come to Karwan. I explained to the Governor that the local people had taken no steps to stop the large Kafila of Afghans, which had recently lett, although most of these men had been stopping in Karwan for the last three months with their camels. I also offered, if necessary, to come to Geh to discuss matters. These letters were sent by the hand of a trusted messenger, who had orders to return in five days with or without an answer. 6 . At Rafch, I saw frequently most of the headmen of Karwan. They one and all offered the same excuse for not stopping these Afghans or others en ^&amp; e d i Q this arms traffic, viz. t that no orders had been received from the Governor or from their Sirdar Said Khan. It was not very easy to elicit any reliable information. To the headmen, Sirdarkhels, Sirdar Said Khan and even to the local people, this trade is a source of profit. One to three dollars are taken on each rifle landed. In addition large sums are paid for the local camels. Ihe Governors not only wink at but encourage this trade, as it helps to increase their own profits. P n two letters were received from the Governor. In the first letter, the Governor wrote to say that he was glad to hear that we were going to Karwan to make enquiries into the traffic of arms and added “ It would have been better if you had informed me in time so that I could have met you m Karwan and assisted in the enquiry.” In the second “ I beg to be excused from coming down to Karwan now, as I have to collect headmen, etc., for the meeting to be held at Charbar. ° Ife also invited me to come to Geh, I would here add that on the day the Governor sent this letter, he started off to Shighim in order to commence- operations against Kamal Khan and never really intended to come to Karwan or even to Charbar. * nil 0n ^ st 1 ]eft Rafch and marched to Geh via Binth. We arrive at Geh on the 7 th. On the evening of the 8 th, the Governor returned froi blnghim bring m back with him his troops. Sirdar Said Khan and the who]9 of the local army. For eight days this so called fight had been going on. The Persians contented themselves with destroying the date groves and laying waste to the village. Casualties on both sides 5 men. The Governor only too glad to get out of a difficult situation, gave out that I bad insisted on his returning to Geh. The Governor dined with me on the evening of bis arrival. 9 . On the 9th and 10th, the whole question of the arms traffic in Persian Baluchistan was discussed. I pointed out clearly to the Goyernor that al though he was in the neighbourhood and had received distinct orders to stop this traffic, not a single step had been taken to capture the last Kafila of the Afghans, which had left Karwan in the beginning of April. In addition, I informed him that I was prepared to prove that the headmen of Karwan had received no orders to arrest these Afghans, although several of them had been stopping in Karwan with their camels for the last three months awaiting the arrival of rifh-s from Maskat. I also showed him his own letter dated January 1906 to my address, in which he had promised to guard all the routes in Persian Baluchistan. Finally, although very reluctantly the Governor con sented to visit Karwan on his way down to Charbar and fixed the date of departure for the 15th. 10. On the 16th the affary, as described in Appendix A, occurred. It was extremely fortunate that the fight was s'^on stopped and that no one was seri ously hurt. My camp was surrounded on all sides by armed Baluchis, who had just returned from the fighting at Shighim. The Governor had been having some difficulty with his own men, who were very reluctant to march to Karwan on account of heat, etc. In addition the whole occurrence was most unfortunate as it gave the Governor a further excuse to hold out against moving down to Karwan. Finally it was agreed that the Governor should march on 3 7th and that 1 should follow on the 18th. To my great relief the Governor left Geh on the evening of the 17 th but only to halt again at the first stage out. I jarrived at Rafoh on the 23rd and the Governor on the 25th. 11 . On the 27th, the Governor hold a Durbar and gave strict orders to Sirdar Said Khan, Mir Islam Khan of Binth, and all the headmen of Karwan that in future all importations of arms into the harbours and seaboard between (Jharbar and Sadich were strictly prohibited and that the Sirdars and headmen would be held responsible to check the same. The agreement (Appendix B) was signed by all in open Durbar and explained carefully to all tne signatories. I also explained to the headmen that, in future, they would be held responsible and would not be able again to excuse themselves on the plea that they had received no orders. Next day, I moved to Darak* and arrived in Charbar on. the 30th in the “Patrick Stewart ’\ My mounted party reached Charhar on the 4th June. »t present are: — Xyazais Kasai* Khattaks 12. From Appendix C it will be seen that the Afghans! have only tATo/e.—The principal tribes engaged in this trade within the last three years Cailied OQ this trade between Charhar and Sadich. Last ■) v m . year shortly before the Charbar meeting, 5 Ff0mne,ghb0urb0od ° fGhMm ' Sirdar Said Khan stopped one Kafila of Afghans, hut allowed the same to proceed on its way after the usual tolls had been exacted. During the recent cold weather, it was evidently the intention &gt;f the Afghans to have carried on operations on a large scale. The first con- ugnment of rifles was landed in the mouth of December. From then onwards ind till the end of March, the Afghans appear to have met with no success. Unfortunately two large consignments were safely landed at Rafch in the last ben days of March or the first week in. April. Without these, the Afghans would have been compelled to have left more or less empty handed as I arrived m the scene shortly afterwards. There is no doubt that since January last the Afghans especially those detained in Mekran, had an anxious time of it; hut the successful landing of these two consignments and the large profits obtain- ible by this trade may act as incentives to try again thi s year. # iVo&lt; e .—Darak is a small harbour about 6 miles east of Galeg. A few palm groves and good water obtainable. Fhe' Patrick Stewart ” was able to anchor in 4 fathoms of water not more than half mile trom .he shore. Captain findall, who has a long experience of this coast, was unaware of this small harbour and was also surprised to ind h ow dose he could anchor to the shore. At other places the “ Patrick Stewart has to anchor at least two miles off the shore. C2I.8FD13. With regard to the local trade, the Governor, who is a grandson of the late Ibrahim Khan, a former well know r n Governor of the Persian Baluchistan and has always lived in these ports or at Bam, estimates the number of rifle's in Persian Baluchistan at 3,000 adding that there has been a great increase during the last three years. I am rather inclined to think that these figures must be somewhat exaggerated. At Geh, I saw Sirdar Said Khan’s ‘ Lashkar ’ about 500 strong and not more than half were armed with rifles. It is also true that nearly every one you meet especially in Karwan is armed with a breech leading rifle of some description. The absurdly cheap price, at wdiich the old military pattern Bussian, Prench and German rifles are now obtainable renders it possible for the poorest Baluch to arm himself. The most appreciat ed rifles are the English make Martini Henry rifle and carbine. A well made *303 carbine is now finding great favour among the better class of men. ‘SOB bore cartridges, 1 am told, can be purchased in Maskat for Rs. 18 per 100 and solid drawn brass *450 bore cartridges English make for Rs. 12 per lOo! Erench, Russian, etc., for Rs. 8 per 100 . 14. Both the local customs authorities and also the Assistant Superintend ent of Jask in his reports, lay great stress on the active part played by ‘Khali fa ’ in the traffic of arms carried on by the Afghans in Karwan. All the in formation, which I could gather relating to Mulla Kbair Muhammad is to be found in Appendix D. On my arrival in Geh I clearly pointed out to the Governor that the responsibility of allowing this Mullah to remain on in Kar • wan or in Persian Baluchistan rested with him, as I was led to suppose, that be had received orders from Kirman to turn the man out. The Governor acknowledged that he had received some orders, but they were only from the Naib of Kirman and he had replied to the same. I agreed to allow the matter to stand over till our arrival at Charbar. If I had insisted on the Governor, who was very unwillingto do anything in this matter owing to the danger of offending the local Sirdars and people, taking active steps to evict the * Khalifa,’ I would have in every probability never been able to persuade him to visit Karwan. All that I am at present able to prove against the ‘ Khalifa ’ is that he allowed these Afghans to live in Karkindar and assisted them by bis influence with the local inhabitants. I have no proof that he was in the habit of supplying the money for the purchase of rifles, etc. The Mulla complains, in the absence of any orders, that he w r as no more to blame in this matter than Sirdar Said Khan or any of the headmen of Karwan. On arrival of the Governor at Charbar, this question will be further discussed in the presence of the Karguzarof Mo- bammera, who has been appointed to assist in the enquiry in the arms traffic. A further report will be sent. 15. In 1902 an agreement* was drawn up and signed by you and the Firman * This agreement was very useful as it enabled me Eirma of E.iimUn embodying tll0 steps, to clearly prove to the Governor that it was the which the latter proposed to take to stop in wish or the Kirman authorities to stop the impor* e . .. t , . __ p. tatiun of arms in Persian Baluchistan. iUtUFC tills illicit trafllC m arms. Ko action F - McC - of any kind was taken on this agreement and moreover it is during the last three years that the trade has increased to the present alarming extent. I hear that the Customs authorities are making preparations to establish small posts at four of the harbours along tho coast of the Fersian Baluchistan west of Charbar, but it is as well to bear in mind that their former attempts failed. If the Customs Department now succeed, so much the better, but I am inclined to think that for the present no great re liance should be placed on these efforts. I shall be in a better position to judge after the meeting. The Governor and the local people are naturally entirely against the establishment of these Customs posts. I have carefully avoided the whole subject as after all it is one that concerns the internal admi nistration itself and contented myself with getting an agreement, which would hold the Governor and the local Sirdars responsible for the importation of arms into Persian Baluchistan. 16. The point now to consider is how to ensure the terms of the agree ment made in Karwan being kept. This agreement gives us something to work on. I he Karwanis are at present inclined to be amenable as they have bad a lesson. No Governor has visited Karwan for several vears. The local people compare the visit of a Governor to that of a swarm of lojusts and wellthey may. The Afghans have had a fright and been put to a certain amount v- of inconvenience. The great point, to aim at, is to try and stop this Afghan trade at the commencement of the next cold weather, succeed and then, 1 think, a greit blow will have been given to this Afghan trade in these parts. The con ditions aie favourable as X have pointed out hormer experience has proved that no reliance can be placed on the local Persian authorities. I am led to believe *Note .— : Uow very douitfui. that the present Governor is likely to re tain the Governorship* till end of the year but the teims of the contract have not yet been concluded. If so, so much the better. 17. I would strongly recommend that the following two measures should be adopted in order to ensure, as far as possible, the terms of the Karwan agree ment being kept :— (а) To allow myself or any other selected officer to tour quietly about the l^ersian Baluchistan during the next cold weather. ( б ) To win over to our side the two most important men in the Persian! 1 2 Vo/«,— Country south of Biimpur. Mekian, viz., Sirdar Said „ , Khan and Mir Islam Khan of Binth. Regarding (a)—I do not consider that there would be any difficulty in arranging this tour locally. There is very little hope of a settlement of the Sarawan cases at the present border meeting. This officer might march to Charbar about the beginning of November, then quietly move along the Karwan coast and finally march up to Bampur to meet the Governor in connection with the Sarawan cases. If my deputation was sanctioned, I am faiily confident that I could carry out this tour without any trouble. I am personally acquainted with the Governor, Sirdar Sail Khan and all the head men. A small escort from the Mekran Ii 3 vy Corps and a good local Kalati Mekran Sirdar such as Mehrab Khan would be quite sufficient. The Afghans generally commence operations about November and the mere fact of the presence of an officer in these parts would, I am sure, be sufficient to keep the local people to their agreement provided also Sirdar Said Khan and Mir Islam Khan were with us. Regarding [b )—I would recommend that a sum of Rs. 1,200 should he promised to Sirdar Said Khan and Rs. 600 to Mir Islam Khan provided that they render assistance to keep the terms of the agreement. It would be difficult to expect these men to stop this well established trade in one year, but I consider that there should be no difficulty in keeping out the Afghans and the well known local traders. After all these two are the most important. If these two men at the end of the next cold weather fulfil their promises, then a similar sum might be promised for the next year and so on. If this is approved, I would propose that I should be allowed to write a letter to these two Sirdars informing them that such and such a sum will he paid to ** the en(i of tlie next oold weather, provided it is satisfactorily proved that they have made a genuine effort to stop this trade. These two men will not only lose money by the stoppage of this trade but will also have to with stand a certain amount of opposition from the local Sirdars in Sarawan and all the headmen of the Karwan coast. These twm men are well worth winning over to our side if this traffic is to be stopped especially with regard to the Afghans. J 6 On my arrival at Charbar on the 15th April, I met Lieutenant Barker, N„ ofll M. S. “ Lapwing ” I was able to discuss with him generally the question of this arms traffic. His views will be found in Appendix E. I do not feel myself called on to make any remarks on this report as it deals with the question from the Maskat side. After my tour I cannot help thinking at more frequent patrolling between Jask and Charbar would have a bene- ncial effect. The Persian Customs have, I am told, ordered a few large steam launches for this purpose, but here again it is difficult to put much faith in their patrolling.12 19. During this recent tour, I have marched along the whole coast of the Persian Baluchistan and have also visited Binth and Geh. The point, which y strikes one most forcibly, is the total absence, now, of any respect for the Persian authority and the great desire of all parties for British protection. In Sara wan the Sirdars are more or less in open rebellion and have refused to pay more than one instalment of last year’s revenue, and, in addition, to attend the Charbar meeting. In Mekran, Mir Behram Khan of Sarbaz refused to % allow the Governor to pass through his country. In Geh, Kamal Khan, an influential Baluch, up to date has successfully defied the Governor. Whether the Sirdars of Dashtyari and Bahu agree to come into Charbar for the meeting remains to be seen. Por the last 7 or 8 years, the exodus of the tiller of the soil and even of the better class of headman has been steadily increasing year by year. In 1893 Major Sykes estimated the number of houses in Geh itself at 600, now it would be extremely difficult to count 200. It is the same with every village in Geh, Kasarkand and Bahu. Several well-known cases have lately occurred of Sirdars and others selling into slavery their ‘ ryots ’ ■ not slaves ’ to Arab dealers on the coast. The Governor, although he appears to be as good a man as possible for these parts, is in helpless position. Only about two months ago some troops were sent from Kirman to Bam pur, Owing to a few deaths, these troops refused to stop in Bampur and quietly marched hack. The Sarbazes, I saw with the Governor, were, I should think, of very little use except to loot. Their rifles are old, ammunition scarce and pay practically nil. It will be a bad day for the Persian authorities in Mekran when the different Sirdars make up their minds to combine which event may happen any day, especially if the Sirdars continue to see th^t their single efforts at open rebellion meet with no punishment. 20 . This state of unrest and the entire lack of responsible authority reacts in a very adverse manner on our border. The local people are beginning to forget the effects of your meeting with the Firman Firma in 1902. The recent raid made by Mir Ahmad Khan is a typical example. Lately posts of the Mekran Levy Corps have been established along the border, The anticipated utility of this measijre will never, I am afraid, be realized until the entire political control of the border and also all correspondence with the Governor and the Sirdars of the Persian Balu chistan are placed solely in the hands of the Assistant Political Agent and . Commandant of the Corps under the supervision of the Political Agent, Kalat. The Assistant Political Agent with posts all along the border should he the best qualified officer to deal with the border cases and also to keep in close touch with the Governor and the Sirdars of the Persian Baluchistan. At present there are no less than three officers who have the official right in these cases to correspond direct with you and the Persian authorities without any reference to each other. The Nazim of Mekran, it is true, received orders to consult the Assistant Political Agent before taking any action, but in practice this method has met with little success. The Director of the Indo-European Telegraph Department in his political capacity as the officer in charge of the Mekran coast, as a general rule, is only able to visit the larger ports such as Pasni, Gw r adur and Charbar once a year and then can only spare a day or two at each. I am sure he w ould gladly welcome any assistance in the settlement of his cases. At present there are only two officers who could assist him in this capacity, viz., the Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, and the British Consul at Bandar Abbas. The former, as I have explained, is naturally placed iu a better position, as he is iu close touch with the whole Persian border. It should not be difficult to arrange that both the Director and the Nazim of Mekran should send all their border cases without exception to the Assistant Political Agent for necessary action and settlement. I trust you will agree with me, under the existing state of affairs in the Persian Baluchistan, that the time has now arrived for the early consideration and settlement of this locally important question. 21. In this paragraph, I would like to mention the good work done by both Sirdar Mehrab Khan, Gitchki, and Munshi Gkulam Murtaza Khan, Head C:erk. I trust that you will be pleased to bring the names of these two men tq Jhe favourable notice of the Local Government,13 0 ) Sirdar Mehrab Khan Gitchki has, as you are well aware, done most excellent work in Mekran as the Nazim's right hand man for the last 6 or 0 years. Since my arrival in Mekran, he has worked in a most indefatigable manner and has helped me at every turn. During this recent tour his services have been invaluable both on account of his great local influence with the Sirdars and headmen and also on account of his tact in dealing with the Persian authorities. I trust his long services may now meet with recognition. (2) Munshi Ghulam Murtaza Khan, my Head Clerk, has done most excel lent work since his first appointment in August 1904. He has often single- handed had to carry on the whole work of my office. His record in the Gilgit Agency was also, as I am personally aware, a good one. During this recent tour he has again rendered me most useful service. 22. Throughout the tour, the health of my camp and escort was good in spite of the excessive heat on the Mekran Coast at this time of the year. Jemadar Juma Khan and the men showed that they are an excellent material for this rough work if properly handled. A detailed description of the different routes and harbours is being sent in separately. 23. On the Itila-ud-Dowlah's arrival at Charbar, I learnt from hint that he had been appointed especially from Tehran to assist in the enquiry regarding arms traffic in Baluchistan. This morning (16th) in the presence of the Gover nor of Persian Baluchistan, the Mudir of Customs and myself the agreement was countersigned and approved of by the Itila-ud-Dowlah as the Representative of the Persian Poreign Office. This countersignature, I think, will greatly add to the value of the agreement. Also the signatures of certain headmen from Bir, Khir, etc., were affixed to the agreement. A similar agreement is required for the harbours between Gwetter and Charbar, but the presence of the Dashtyari and Bahu Sirdars is required. This can be done during the meeting. APPENDIX A. A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE AFFRAY OF 16TH MAY AT GEH. On the morning of the 16th, 3 Persian Sarbazes went to a house close to our camp to have their grain ground. A follower belonging to Mii za Mahmood Khan, the Mudi of Customs, Charbar, refused to allow the woman of the house to grind this grain as the latter was a relation of his. Thereupon a quarrel arose and the Mudir's man was beaten. Then other men came on the scene and also the Mudir. The Sarbazes were beaten. The Mudir then sent back one of these men to the Governor yrith one of his own men. As soon as this party arrived at the Governor’s camp, other Sarbazes beat the Mudir’s man. The Sarbazes then decided to come in a body to attack the camp. About 10 a.m , I was informed that a large number of Persians were attacking my men. ^ As soon as I got out of my tent, I saw at least 50 or 60 Sarbazes armed with sticks, stones and some say rifles less than 100 yards off the camp. My man had turned out with their rifles. A shot was fired from the Mudir’s camp and then followed by 3 or 4 more from my men and Sirdar Mehrab Khan’s men. These shots were fired in the air. Luckily the Persians thought better of the matter, turned and fled and we££ soon hidden by the palm groves and the sloping ground. I was able at once to get my camp in hand. On arrival of the Persians in their own camp the Governor was able to stop any further trouble. For a short time afterwards, the air was full of rumours but matters soon settled down. No further trouble occurred on the march down to Karwan. The Sarbazes often acknowledged that they had made a mistake in coming to my camp, but only wished to catch the Mudir and his men. I explained to the Governor that as long as the Mudir was with me, I must count on his support to see that no further trouble arose. This the Governor readily undertook to do. My men and Sarbazes always appeared to be on the best of terms. C238PD14 Note .—I have purposely entered somewhat ,into details regarding this affray as it is a well-known fact that Mirza Mahmood Khan is the author* of all the recent articles in the “ Habbil Matin ” regarding Persian Baluchistan. Since his arrival in Charbar he, according to his own version, saved the whole situation. Both the Governor and myself are well aware of the cause of the trouble and that it arose in the Mudir’s camp. (Sd.) F.

The traffic of breech-loading rifles in Persian Baluchistan. I propose to divide same into 3 heads :— A. Arms imported by Afghans and taken to Afghanistan and to the independent country adjoining the North-West Frontier. B. Arms imported hy local traders. C. Arms imported by local inhabitants. (A) Prom enquiries it appears that the Afghans first commenced this trade on the sea board between Charbar and Sadich 3 years ago. In 1903-04. —Only a few Afghans were employed in this trade and the Kafilas were small. In 1904-05.—‘The trade became more organised. According to the local information, 3 Kafilas of Afghans left Karwan during the winter months :— (/) * Arms landed at Oaleg. Kafila consisted of about 60 Afghans with 70 camels. (5) Arms landed at Oaleg^ Kafila consisted of about 10 men with 20 camels. ? (3) Arms landed at Sadich. Kafila consisted of about 60 Afghans with 80 camels. Total number of rifles about 3,000 with ammunition. The local contractor at Sadich alone informed me that he collected 1,200 dollars as “ Sung ” on rifles imported by these Afghans. The usual rate levied 1 dollar per rifle. In 1905-06. —The operations which were intended to be carried out on a . XT . , ^ ^, large scale, commenced in November. . bote Mostly Nyazaia, Nasal, and Khattaks, Number8 of Afghans . left Karachi in December. 40 alone are traced to have landed in Pasni and Gwadur. Pro bably also others not now traceable. Another party is reported to have come to Kar^van with camels from Bandar Abbas. Others went to Muscat. The Assistant Superintendent of Jask Sub-Division states that 900 rifles were land ed in Tank in December and taken to Karkindar. About the same time 400 rifles are said to have been landed at Darak and taken to Karkindar. Finally in the last week of March or first week in April two consignments of rifles (500 and 700 respectively) were safely landed at Rafch. In addition an unusual amount of ammunition. The camels required for the transport of these follows :— rifles were purchased as 60 in Gwadur and Kalati Mekran. (These camels crossed the border safely in January as formerly reported by me.) 60 were brought from Bandar Abbas and the remainder purchased locally in Karwan. Only one Kafila left Karwan during this year. This started in the begin ning of April and proceeded via Karkindar, Tutan, Kamisk and Regan. The Kafila consisted of about 100 Afghans, 150 camels with probably 1,500 to 2,000 rifles and a large quantity of ammunition. The name of the owner of the boat who successfully landed the last consignment of rifles in Rafch is said to be Salman, resident of Sohera on the Oman coast. He is reported to have received 1 , 0.0 dollars for the trip. (B) These small local traders (Muscatis, Kishmis and Baloches) have been carrying on this trade for the last 7 or 8 years. They have small shops either %17 at the different harbours or live in Binth, Geh, Fanoch, Kasarkand and even Bampur and Dizak. These men deal in a small way. One of the best known is by name Khoda Dad, who is reported to be the Agent of a French firm in Muscat. (C) This traffic in arms has been going on for the last 8 or 10 years but has largely increased during the last 3 years. These men land at all the harbours along the sea board of Persian Baluchistan from Gwetter to Sadich. The operations as a rule are on a small scale, but lately there has been a mark ed tendency, especially amongst the people of Sarawan, to increase the scope of their operations, owing to the good market for the sale of these arms to Dizakis, Kharanis, Damanis and other tribes on the borders of Afghanistan. (Sd.) F. McCONAGHEY, Captain, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran. APPENDIX D. Mullah Khair Muhammad, son of Hnji Rashid, Afghan, tribe i( Baraich ” locally known as the “ Khalifa Sahib ”, originally came from Shorawak close to Nushki. Then appears to have taken up his abode at Kala-i-Fath close to Kuhak (Mission camp), a Baluch village belonging to Afghanistan. In his youth is said to have lifed three years in Buner and Swat. About I or 5 years ago, the “ Khalifa ” passed through Persian Baluchistan on his way to Baghdad Sharif. On return from this pilgrimage Khair Muhammad settled in the village of Karkindar in Karwan and married a relative of the headman of the place, viz., Mir Dost. About a year ago, the Khalifa went back to Kala-i-Fath and returned with his nephew (Muhammad Omar) and some Afghans, most of whom have returned. Within the last year, the Khalifa has repaired a Karez at a place called Sara Hingi, midway between Geh and Karwan. The Khalifa’s influence has greatly increased of late and he now numbers amongst his disciples Sirdar Said Khan, and most of the inhabitants of Geh, Bint, Fanoch and Karwan. Is reported to be a very religious man and has earned for himself a good name in these parts. He is a young man under 40 with a good appearance, lives well and is hospitable to all comers. Receives presents from his “ Murids ” and occasionally is said to intercede with Sirdar Said Khan on their behalf. Further enquiries regarding this man might be made from Quetta and also Seistan. 2. Muhammad Omar, son of Mulla Muhammad Hussain, Afghan, tribe “ Baraich, ” nephew of Mulla Khair Muhammad. A youth of about 18 years old. I met this man at Sara Hingi. During the interview I had with him, he told me that the Ameer of Afghanistan had asked Mulla Khair Muhammad to return to Afghanistan but the latter had refused. I have no information to corroborate this fact. This youth appears to be quite harmless and arrived in Mekran about 18 months ago.. Most of the information in this note was given to me by this man and Abdul Majid. 3. Abdul Majid c Murid, ’ son of Mirza Khan, tribe Nasar, village Kulachi close to Dera Ismail Khan. This man was in the Mission camp for some time as a camel man. Came to Mekran about a year ago on return of the * Khalifa In the course of conversation this man said that if the Karez at Sara Hingi turned out well, that the Khalifa would endeavour to establish a small Afghan colony. This I am rather inclined to think was said to please me. Also that most of the other Afghans, who came down with him, had returned owing to the heat and barren aspect of the country. In addition I met 7 or 8 Afghans on my first arrival at Galeg. These men stated that they had just returned via Task from Baghded Sharif. Personally think that these men were left behind by the caravan which left Karwan about the 8 th April. Probably closely connected with the men w T ho were sent back from Kej and therefore had failed to obtain rifles or camels. (Sd.) F. McCONAGHEY, Captain, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran, C238FDAPPENDIX E. Copy of a letter dated Charbar, the 13th April 1906, from Lieutenant A. Barnett Barker, Commander, H.M.S. ‘ Lapwing, * to Captain F. McConaghey, Assistant Political Agent, Mekran. In reply to your request as to my opinion relative to arms traffic in the Persian Gulf, I consider the only effectual way of stopping the export of arms from Oman is to bring pressure to bear on the Sultan of Muscat. 2. It is common knowledge that several thousand arms are exported from his territory every year, and yet I do not think there has been single capture for the last three years. 3. To patrol the coast efficiently would require several gun-boats, and with the present number available for the work of the Persian Gulf it is not even possible to retain one permanently on the Coast of Oman, and the moment she is withdrawn, the arms are run. I had occasion the other day to go to Sur for 3 days and on my return to Muscat, I received information that 3,000 arms had been landed on the Mekran Coast, 4. Since the Sultan of Muscat draws a considerable revenue (Customs duty) from the importation of arms, he takes no steps whatever to check the illicit traffic, and it is presumed that other Chiefs on the Mekran Coast, etc., also levy a toll on rifles passing through the zone of their influence. 5. I suggest as the most effectual means of checking the arm traffic is to limit the number of arms imported to Muscat, and to increase the subsidy of the Sultan with the understanding that the extra subsidy will only be given if lie effectively prevents the exportation of arms from his territory. As to the political objections to this action I am not in a position to judge, but as the supply is from the Sultan’s territory, it would appear to be easier to stop the traffic from its source than to capture arms on the high seas or the interior of Baluchistan. As at present, I do not think the Agents who run this traffic consider there is any risk whatever, there is no effort made to stop them by the Sultan and the opportunities presented by the absence of a gun-boat are numerous. 6 . I wish to state that these remarks simply convey my own opinion and I have no authority whatever to state that they are approved of by my Commander- in-Chief, APPENDIX E.

While in Sarhad I tried to find out the roads chiefly used by the A fgha n caravans which carried on the illegal trade in arms, but unfortunately, very little was to be discovered# I ascertained, however, that they never use the ordinary caravan routes, but travel through absolutely uninhabited parts.' Water is everywhere plentiful in Sarhad, especially round the Koh- l-¥uftan and in that sparsely populated country, it is easy to pass uqperoeived J 1 spoke to Sirdar Dervesh Khan, Hakim of bazman, on the subject, and he stated that he knew that this Illegal traffic went on unhindered. 1 He, however, had evidently come to look upon it as Inevitable, and it did not strike him that it was any part of his duty to try end suppress It. In any case neither he nor the Sirdar of Khwash have any power whatever even to attempt to hinder the traffic, and the caravans pass unmolested through the country under their authority.' Ihis is not surprising when it is considered that neither of the Sirdars has any force at his disposal, and that the Afghans are invariably well-armed and ootcrld overcome any opposition offered to them with the greatest ease.' Xhe Sarhad route via Khwash * and Ladu Is the shortest and best, and I have reason to believe that the westerly route via Regan from the sea is hardly. If everever, need by these smugglers* Evidently the remedy of the whole matter lies at the sea cost* When onoe the caravans have passed .Bampur, it is utterly impossible for the Governors and Sirdars through whose territory they pass to stop them* 3d/~ Gv D* 1 O&amp;ilvie, Lieutenant*MO. 644-H From The Hon^le Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Harold Deane Agent to the GoTernor-General and Chief Commissioner, Horth West Frontier Provinoe ^ fo The Assistant Secretary to the Gorernment of India, Foreign Department.

When marohing down the Helmand Valley in the spring of 1903, I took the opportunity of making enquiries on subject, but nothing I heard Justified me in ueney- ing that the waim«tTia route is commonly used by trade arms oararans,’ I am inclined to suppose that after crossing the Perso-Afghan frontier, arms cararans march due *ast avoiding XaaAAhax which they leare to the South andlcoming out some- ■nc.' . &gt;•* . where near Kelat-i-Ghilzaie So far as my information goes, the consignment discussed in this letter is the tirst i® one which has found its way to either the ^fridi or Momand frontier, hut, as I hare pointed out, this was not the original destination of these arms. x X X@ Copy of a lottor from tho Birootor fionoral of Ordananco in India 9 to tho Soorotary to tho ^ovommont of India 9 ^ ~ 4 Bopartmont of Military Sn pply 9 ho # 1541-&amp; 9 datod Simla 9 tho EOth Jnno 1906* With roforoneo to Oororzaaont of India lottor Ho.ll46-B t datod E3rd March 1906 9 I havo tho honour to report that tho M«H.Carhlno in question has been examined in tho Blflo Factory Ishappore • She Superintendent reports that tho whole of tho components are of private manufacture and tho workmanship is of a hotter quality than tho oarhine previously examined • She barrel has a Belgian proof mark* £• A firing tost was also carried out at tho Ammunition Factory 9 Bom Bum, by firing 20 rounds of serviceable K»H* Solid case anaminition at 500 yards •' She figure of merit was 15*85 inches which is below tho amount (18 inches) fixed for condemnation for inaccuracy in paragraph 841 A*R*Iv t Yol* II 9 1904 9 and tho carbine id is therefore a serviceable weapon though not very accurate* 3«!

Sir, With reference to my Demi-official telegram dated 3rd June 1906, informing you that a caravan carrying rifles had passed through into Afghanistan, I hare the honour to report as follows On the 1st of Hay a telegram was received from the Political Agent, Kalat, informing HVBttt's Consul at Seistan that a caravan carrying rifles, and accompanied by a number of armed Afghans, had started inland from the ffirtrf uulf, and would probably take t a Regan, Kattoli route to Band-i-Kamal Khan on the Relmvtnd* On receiving this report Captain Hacpherson visited Cattersel, the Director of Customs and Posts in Seistan, and urged him to take steps to apprehend the caravan. Phe Director of Customs, however, treated the matter with indifference and it was only with consider able difficulty that Captain Ha^epherson prevailed on him to takeany steps in the matter at all. 1 Even so he contented himself with vague promises, saying he fcould offer a reward for the seizure of the earazan. e Captain Maopherson, olea^rly perceiving that there was little or no hope of his taking ud any vigorous action, telegraphed to s Charg* d f Affaires at lehran (repeated to Foreign Office as E49-C. of End Kay) suggesting that the Persian Government should be offered the services of our troops at Robat, and also telegraphed again on 4th Kay (repeated to Foreign Office s as E55~C.). ihis offer was deelined but lUB+H*s Chargt d v Affaire^ telegraphed that necessary steps were ueing taken t&gt;y the Persian Government, no orders, however, seem to have oeen received by the Customs' ff*f*»* Officials here, or if received, were not acted on. On the 11th May information was received from Mr. Hamilton, of the Indo-European Telegraph Department, that the caravan had passed through Basratabad Ispi and the Xizuuk Director of Customs and Posts was again urged to make some attempt to intercept it. nothing was done however and on the £8th May the caravan was reported to have passed through to n&amp;nd~i~Kamal Khan (Vide my Demi-official telegram dated 3rd June )• In view of the fact that our interests are seriously in volved in this trade in arms, we cannot but regard with concern thethe apathetic attitude adopted by the Customs 1 Officials I would point out that acmpl^ warning was given, even i»he route of the caravan was correctly gauged and yet, in spite of the facilities thus afforded them, no steps were taken* inhere is little ground to hope that more pronounced action will ue taken in the future, at all events under the present regime* I have, etc*, 3d/- C* Daukes.

With reference to Mr. Grant Duff’s telegram No. 27 of 17th January 1906 to the Government of India notify- Received with Foreign Department endorse- the deputation of “ Reza Unsoli Khan” meot No. 536 -B.a., dated sth February ub. the Persian Government for co-opera tion with us in the suppression of the traffic in arms on the Perso-Baluch border, I have the honour to forward, for information, copies of letters which have passed between myself and the Director- General of Customs, Bushire, on the subject. 2. Reza Kuli Khan has not a very savoury reputation as a Customs official, but as Monsieur Heynssens who appears to be genuinely keen on the suppression of this traffic, has selected him as being in his opinion likely to serve the purpose, it is perhaps, inadvisable to raise objections to the man s deputation until we have practical experience of his utility. A copy of this communication is being forwarded to His Majesty’s Legation. Resident to Director-General of Customs, dated 17th February 1906. Director-General of Customs to Resident, dated 18th February 1906. Dated the 17th February 1906 (demi-official). From— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf, To— Monsisur J. Heynssens, Director-General of Customs, Rusbire. In a recent communication from the British Legation, I am informed that one e ‘ Reza Unsoli Khan,” Customs Inspector, Bunder Abbas, has been deputed to co-operate with our officials on the Perso-Baluch Frontier in the suppression of the arms traffic. This official has perhaps been nominated by yourself, so I write to ask you kindly to let me know if this name is correct or whether it is a misrendering of “ Reza Kuli Khan.” No. 2077, dated the 18th February 1906 (demi-official). From Monsieur J. Heynssens, Director-General of Customs, Bushire, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Political Resident in tbe Persian Gulf. I beg to acknowledge with thanks the receipt of your letter of yesterday. The name Reza Unsoli Khan mentioned in the communication from His Britannic Majesty’s Legation must, in fact, be a misrendering of Reza Guh Khan, the Interpreter of the Bunder Abbas Customs, whose return from leave is daily expected. I intend, indeed, organizing an armed force with camels, which to my opinion may render more valuable service than horses owing to the deserty nature of the country, for making up and down tours along the entire Biaban and Mekran Coast with the sole mission of suppressing the traffic of arms, and I propose charging Reza Guli Khan with the lead and command of this force. I hope to be able to communicate with you shortly on the subject and to furnish you with further details regarding the above said project.Office Memo.

Your telegram 55-C., March 19th. McConaghey should proceed to Charbar, where he will confer with Persian delegates, who according to our information are Reza Gull Khan and Etila-ed-Dowleh. The former will deal with the special case mentioned in your telegram 348 of 24th December and the latter with general question of arms traffic and border cases. We have heard nothing from Tehran as to Fernandez, and McConaghey should be careful not to accept him as Persian representative without proper credentials. Persian Government strongly object to McConaghey being accompanied by Indian escort and offer to supply an escort if so desired. As we have British telegraph guard at Charbar, it will perhaps be possible for McConaghey to land his escort there and then to arrange this matter locally with Persian representa tives there, but if there is any difficulty, he should report for orders.

Submitted for information, observing that I have forwarded a copy of this despatch to the Government of Ifidia, and have informed them that I shall consult Commander Bowman of the 'SPHINX” on the subject of the Arms traffic, and I hope to meet Major Grey, Political Agent at Muscat, on my approaching visit to the Persian Gulf. The Report is creditable to Comnnnder Somerville. EDMUND S. POE.(§) I • *1 Copy ABIS TRAFFIC Confidential H.M.S. n REDBREAST H at Jashk, 1st February 1900 Sir, In compliance with your confidential Sailing Orders of the 5th January 1906, paragraph 8, I have the honour to report as foJlows:- 2.- No shipments of Arms have been made from Muscat to the Makran Coast since this ship han been stationed there for the prevention of the traffic. 8.- No seizure of arms have consequently been made. 4. - It is most difficult to get really definite information with respect to the Arms Traffic, and I submit the folloving information, observing that though I believe it to be mainly correct, yet, that in parts, it may be found to require revision. 5. - The period during which arms are shipped is between November and March. 6. - The trade cannot be lucratively carried on in the summer owing to the difficulty of forwarding the arms into the interior at that season, on account of the lack of fodder for the camels. 7. - The arms are mostly purchased by Afghans from a man named Ali Musa Khan in Muscat, and they are made up in cases Senior Naval Officer II. M. Ships &amp; Vessels, holding PERSIAN GULF DIVISION.holding 20 rifles. 8. - The principal places where the arms are landed in the order of their importance are - Galag, Tank, Rabij, and Sadaieh. I hear that arms are occasionally landed at a place on the Western side of Chahbar Bay, and at other points on the coast, but the bulk of the traffic has hitherto been bia Galag and Tauk. 9. - Usually when the arms are landed they are sent to Karwan - a small town on the Rabij River, until sufficient are collected to form a caravan and they are then forwarded to various points in the interior. 10. — Galag is the favourite port of entry, as before re marked, solely, apparently, on account of its proximity to Karwan, for it has disadvantages as compared with Rabij end Tauk as a port of disembarkation: only small craft can cross the bar of the river, end dhows have to be unladed outside, where there is no shelter. 11. - I am informed that dhows drawing as much as 10 feet can enter the River at Ta.uk and lie inside, but I am inclined to doubt the truth of this, as I have examined the river for about a mile,and could find no deep spot: however one may exist. ]2.- The anchorage at Ta k is well sheltered from the Shimal and there is about three fathoms at L. W. in the berth with Bir Peak bearing N.b2° V/ and K Tauk Point 8.34° V/. where the n REDBREAST” lay. 18.- I am unable to say why Rabij is less used for the traffictraffic than Galag and Tank, but I surmise that the entrance is difficult except with fair v/eather and a leading wind. It appears to break right across even in a slight swell, and the bar lias probably silted up since 1871 when it was surveyed. I donot think many cargoes are run via Sadaieh. I have not visited the place, and can offer no information about -it. 14.- The superior attractions of Galag are evidenced by the fact, that the Customs Farmer there, is able to charge Rs 2 per rifle, import duty, as against Rs 1 only at other ports. lb.- Major Grey informs me that a large purchase of arms (said to amount to Rs 80,000) was recently made by a party of Afghans, and these.were to be sent over in a Dengi, but that, on account of our presence on the coast, they were not shipped, and the purchasers have been trying to recover their money from Ali Musa Khan: he not unnaturally, has demurred to this, and the present arrangement is that the arms are to be shipped across after the Gunboat is withdrawn, 16. - I would suggest the probability that this shipment may be made in the early summer, and the arms stored at Karwan, until next autumn, as they have already been bought and paid for: or they Stay be sent over in driblets, but I doubt if so valuable a cargo would be shipped in one bottom, while liable to capture. 17. -* I am unable of course to make suggestions for the suppression of the traffic founded on the experience of actual captures: I am of opinion that both Chahbar and JashkJanhk should be made use of as bases - the former is perhaps slightly the better, as, while Galag is about half way between the two, Tauk is half way between Galag and Chahbar. 18. - The ship should make irregular cruises, between the two ports, observing that Dhows would probably make Tauk in a Shiraal, and Galag in a Kans. 19. - When parties of Afghans arrive with the intention of running a cargo of arms, tney have to buy camels locally. usually at Rabij; it would be an assistance to ascertain from the line guards, as far as possible, the movements of these camels, as they might afford some indication of the point where a landing was intended. 80.- A dhow takes about 86 hours to cross in a moderate shimal. Friday is a fa-vourite day for dhows to leave Muscat after prayer in the Mosque. 21. - During our stay on thecoast only one dhow has 'been seen (as reported in Letter of Proceedings) exclusive of a few l^ing at Chahbar, which are not under suspicion. 22. - The Custom’s station at Chahbar is superior to that at Jashk, but both are in charge of a Mudir.

No. 88 , dated the 21st December 1905. From —The Assistant Superintendent, Jask Sub-Division, To—The Director, Persian Gulf Telegraphs. In continuation of my telegram words 51 of date, I have the honour to place before you the following report respecting the importation of arms and ammunition along this coast. 2 . It appears that the centre and chief figure of this traffic is an Afghan named Khalifah who is reported to be a wealthy man of high standing and who resides in the Karwan district about fifteen miles north-east of Rapch. Agents are sent to Maskat by Khalifah to purchase rifies from a trader named Ali Moosa and undoubtedly succeed in shipping them by native boat under cover of dark ness and other Agents on this side buy camels for the transport of the arms on their arrival at the Coast. In this way imports are collected at Karwan which may he described as the forwarding point or head-quarters of the trade. The principal points of disembarkation are Sadech, Galeg and Tank, Karwan being central for all three ports. The season for importing is apparently December to March and during the hot weather the quantity collected at Karwan is transported upcountry to Seistan. The general impression is, I believe, that the arms are taken into Afghanis tan, but from information gathered it would appear that Seistau is the present market where they are sold to the best advantage. It is extremely difficult to ascertain with any accuracy the quantity im ported, but from information received I would estimate that the annual importa tion is approximately three thousand rifles with one hundred rounds of ammu nition to each gun. I hear from various sources that Khalifah pays Sirdar Said Khan a customs duty of two dollars on each rifle which, according to the above estimate, repre sents an annual revenue of Rs. 9,000. Camels are brought up in large quantities by Khalifah who is said to pay Rs. 120 and sometimes more, whereas in former years Rs. 80 was considered a very high price. The scarcity of camels in this part of the country between Jask and Charbar is apparent and an undoubted fact. In conclusion I would beg to say that the above remarks may be described as a sifting of the many reports and rumours which have reached me duringr M my tour, and are so far as I am able to determine the facts of the case at the present time.

Owing to recent reports that large numbers of rifles have found their way through Persian Gulf Ports into the hands of the tribes on the North-Western Frontier of India, the Resident in the Persian Gulf has requested that a man- of-war should be detailed to take whatever action may be possible to put a stop to this trade. You are therefore, after consulting with the Political Agent at Maskat with a view of obtaining all possible information, to proceed on this service. You should for the present make Jask your head-quarters and will probably be able to obtain a certain amount of information from the Telegraph officials there. 2. You are to report to me at the end of this month any seizures of arms you may have made, all information you may have obtained, and any sugges tions you may then be able to make as to the best arrangements in stationing ships, etc., which can be made with a view to putting down this traffic. 3 .

You will see from the Mushir-ed-Dowleh’s reply that the Persian Govern- To Musbir-ed-Dowieh, dated 28th December ment decline to allow the Political Officer 1905 . at Mekran to cross the Persian frontier m order to intercept a caravan of arms stated to have been landed at Charbar. His From Mushir-ed-Dowioh, dated siet December Excellency states that a Mamur IS being 1905. sent to deal with the matter and requests that the Political Officer at Mekran may he instructed to furnish that official with any information which may assist him in his endeavours to suppress the traffic. I fear that, as usual, in this unhappy country, no efficient &lt; steps will be taken to prevent arms being imported, and that unless His Ma]esty s Govern ment insist on the right of their official to cross the frontier in such cases ie traffic will continue as before. I have the honour to be, See, Your most obedient, humble servant, E. GRANT DUFF. The Secretary of State in the Foreign Department, Calcutta. Mb.

Itappears that at the Charbar meeting, in May 1905, to arrange various cases pending between His Majesty’s Government and the Government of His Majesty the Shah, the Karguzar of Mohammerah stated that he had made a report to Your Excellency regarding the importation of arms, but in spite of this the traffic continues unchecked and large quantities find their way into Persian Baluchistan, Afghanistan and British territory. Information has just been received by the Government of India of the landing of a large consignment of arms at Charbar, and the Political Officer at Mekran thinks that he could intercept the caravan, if he were authorized by the Persian Government to cross the Persian frontier for this purpose. I have the honour to enquire if the Persian Government will give the necessary authorization and also what steps they propose to take to prevent the passage of large consignments of arms through Persian territory.Musbir-ed-Dowleh to Mr, Grant Duff. (Translation.) 31st December 1905. I have received vour note of the 28th instant respecting the prohibition of arms into Baluchistan, and I have the honour to inform you that a special official is to be sent soon to settle the Baluchistan affairs, and that he will be instructed to take immediate steps to prohibit the transaction in question. You have stated in your note that “ the Political Officer at Mekran thinks that he could intercept the caravan if he were authorized by the Persian Gov ernment to cross the Persian frontier for this purpose,’* and you have enquired whether the Persian Government would give that permission. As the grant of such a permission is a matter of some consideration, the Persian Government will be excused, but the Persian official will take the necessary steps in the matter. It is desirable that the Political Officer in Mekran should be instructed to give any information about the persons dealing in arms, as well as any other information that the Persian official may require.

If McConaghey is to meet Persian official at Jask^or Gharbar, Jask preferable, he will travel there by sea from Pasni. I think they should both move inland to Bampur and there concert with Deputy Governor measures for arresting traffic. Consign ments of December last have clearly gone northward and are out of reach. If this meeting is arranged at Bampur, the yearly border meeting, now under arrangement for April or May, can conveniently be combined with it. Mekran Nazim, on return from Quetta, in the event of (?

If Persian official agrees to meet Captain McConaghey at Charbar we think that both should move inland to Bampur and there concert with Deputy Governor measures for arresting traffic.

At iSaekat they are sold at He 85 to So 40 per rifle. Magasine rifles vary in price from Hs 160 to Kb 800, It ie believed that they are of European manufacture and are acid in the Saukat market with the porriiaeion of the oultan of icaskat. Those rifles were firnt im ported about three or four years ago. They are of two kinds - bearing the inscription of she allah' (1) in gold lettere; (S) in silver letters. The rifle trade with Afghanistan through the rereian Gulf, hac, existed for years, but previously the weapons bore no inneription and it is only within the past two or three years that the import has assumed euoh proportions. Consignments of these weapons are landed clandestinely at Ban der Abbas or some other port in Persian territory suited for smuggling and are buried in the sands to be taken out at a convenient time. During the reign of the late ^mir the import an' sale of so-oallod aaskat arms was oonduoted secretly in iifghanirtan; the present Amir encourages the trade, as ie evi denced by the fact that Kie Highness recently advanced a large sum of money to a trader of lotalif to enable him to import a large supply of suoh rifles.[ Confidential. ] 7w T t No. 58, dated Bushire, the 21st February (received 6th March) 1906.
