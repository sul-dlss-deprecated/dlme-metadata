Genral Terms Diving Clerks Each official diving olerfce are authorised by the Government to make up accounts for Kakhudas and divers and to check accounts. Five of these are in Moharaq and three in Manama, They are remunerated by being allowed to charge a percentage in proportion to the ambunt of the accounts which they deal with. Another clerk, in the Government offices, deals entirely with the diving accounts which are referred to him by the Court or by divers and Ifakhudas and checks all accounts submitted to him. In spite of all this most of the divers, though their account^ may clearly be balanced, have not the least idea as to how they stand.

Bankrupt Sakhudas . In the case of a Ifakhuda going bankrupt, the tajar takes over the boats and divers but the personal property of the bankrupt is rateable among his creditors as usual, the tajar only having a super claim over boat and men. The tajar takes over the men as against the amount for which they are indebted to their lakhuda. According to the rules, 1. A bankrupt WakhUda must first settle his accounts with his divers. 2. If the divers are satisfied with their accounts as shown by him he can hand them over to the tajar. 3.

A Nakhuda taking a diver on the above system should take from him the barwa as a nroof as to how the diver came to him. A separate account book must be kept by such divers and entries must not be made in the same book as thos of their own ifakhudas.

Every week Hatton-garden mer chants are sending tine diamonds by air to India for inspection. f Private Hoards Indian princes are also spending huge sums on pearls. In fact at the present time the pick of the Bahrein Islands pearl fisheries are sent lb India. 44 Parcels ' worth anything from £20,000 to £50,000 are going almost every day to swell the private hoards that are being .built up.. / Activity in the kingdom of Jewels is being helped to a considerable extent by American buyers, many of whom are in London at the present time. Rich Germans are known to be anions to buy gems, but are unable to get their money out of the country. In other countries, however, Italy especially, a quiet absorption of fine diamo'nds is going on by people who, in view of all the dis turbance of the past few years, and the loss of other kinds of wealth, have taken a fancy to precious stones. Huge Daily Purchases A West End jeweller said that four- ^ ' ^figure purchases of jewels are of daily occurrence and five -figure ones quite frequent. The sale of gold, which is still going on, though £25,000,000 worth has been disposed of, is helping the trade in gems.

POLLUTION OF SEA BY OIL J)ISCH|VRGES The memorandum drafted by the committee of experts Jor the study of the question of pollution of the sea by discharges of oil f rom motor vessels , which met in Geneva from November 19th to 23rd states inter alia that it was agreed that the damage caused by oil pollution related to the des truction of sea-birds, whose wings became saturated with oil, and who were consequently un able to swim, fly or dive, and often died a painful and linger ing death from starvation; to the dest ruction of fish, particularly shell-fish; and o'f the marine grasses which form th e staple fo od of flsfiTand birds ; to the pol- lution of beaches which resulted in damage to bathers and consti tuted a menace to public health; to the depreciation in value of seaside resorts? generally; and, finally, to the fire hazard created by the accumulation of oil, which, &gt;in many cases, drifted into har bours from outside territorial waters. These evils occur to a greater or less extent in various countries. In the United Kingdom and in the United States they are all still present to a serious extent, though conditions have improved on cer tain parts of the coasts of these countries in recent years. In Ja pan, though pollution is no't very serious at the -present time , 'oil thrown away or escap ing from v essels along the coasts has c aused damage to fisheries, parti c ularly shell fisheries , and has al- s cT jeopardised the culHvation o f edible seaweed, which forms one of the important induatries \A on portions of the coast. In Italy I the damage has not been very serious; it has principally affected the sea-beaches, and there is also the danger of fire in certain har bours from the presence of oil, washed in from beyond territorial limits. In France the chief damage Has been to fisheries and to sea^de resorts and bathing stations. In Denmark there have been only a few cases of pollution, but it is feared that as oil-burn ing and oil-carrying vessels in crease in numbers the damage may become more serious. The object in view is to provide, by international agreement, some means whereby oil-burning and oil-carrying ships may be pre vented from polluting, through the discharge of oil and oily mix tures on the high seas, the coasts to which the matter thus dis charged is liable to drift, after travelling, in certain conditions of wind and tide, considerable dis tances. It is not possible to pro vide a remedy which will be com pletely effective, since some of the pollution is due to the stranding or collision of vessels having oil on board, or to the pouring of oil on to the seas by vessels dur ing storms and while assisting other vessels in distress. No mea sures that could be taken could obviate these causes of pollution. It is, however, possible to guard against pollution caused by the voluntary discharge of oil and oily mixtures by ships outside ter ritorial limits, though this can only be achieved through the co operation of the chief maritime countries of the world. It is ob vious that if ships belonging to some* of the chief maritime na tions were^ left free to discharge oil and oily matter without res triction, the co-operation of the other maritime nations in an in ternational agreement would largely be frustrated. \1 4. i 71 * k 1 i I O &amp; * mmmrs press cuttings St. Andrews House, 32 to 34 H„ih n w an' 3 St. Andrew street ' V,adUCt ' ' 'Olborn Circus, E.C.i, Telephone: CENTBiii Irisli lews II 5-ii7 Donegal!

The most famous pearling grounds are those of the Persian Gulf and Ceylon, and there are many references to these fisheries in ancient literature. There ' was a strange idea, held for a long time, about the origin of pearls. The old writers declared that when; the oyster came to the surface of the water and opened its valves it caught some dew- drops and turned them into pearls. At one time the pearling grounds on the north-west coast of Ceylon belonged to the King, and divers' had to obtain permissibn from him before they were allowed to work. The British Govern ment afterwards acquired this right, and part of every oyster catch was taken by the Government as revenue. The offi cials inspect the rocky banks where the pearl oysters are found, and when they consider that there are a sufficient num ber of oysters they send out notices tell ing the divers to prepare for the fishing. The season is usually very short, lasting only from the end of February until April. Soon after the official notices have been issued a camp for the divers and other workers is established by the Government, and numerous temporary abodes of every kind spring up in a short time. ★ ★ * diver comes up after the first dive of the season his nose bleeds, but if this does not happen it is taken as a bad sign and he will not dive again. * * * THE SHARK CHARMER. HPHE divers work in pairs, and take it in turn to descend, but they cannot go down further than seven or eight fathoms, and as many of the best pearl oysters are to be found at much greater depths than this, white divers wearing diving suits are now employed as well as the natives. The divers in the Persian Gulf are mostly Arabs, who can stay under water much longer than the Hindu divers of Ceylon. The Hindus will never descend until prayers have been said by a shark charmer, but this is not the custom among the Arabs. When the oysters are brought ashore by the fishing fleet they are sold in lots, by auction, to the pearl merchants. The value of a pearl depends on its size, shape, colour, and freedom from de fects ; but the merchants cannot tell either the quality or quantity of those in the oysters they buy, so sometimes they lose on the deal, and at other times they gain quite a fortune. * HANDLED W8TH CARE. THE DIVERS TASK. _ H e earliest method of obtaining the ^ oysters was that of setting naked natives to dive for them, and the work is still carried on in the same manner at the present day. The divers are a daring race of men and wonderfully clever at their strange task. The pearl banks are usually situated at from six to eight fathoms below the surf ace. of the water, and in order that they may reach the grounis by sunrise the boats carrying the divers have to set out at midnight. The diver's limbs are rubbed with oil, cotton wool put in his ears, and a sponge soaked in oil bound tightly over his mouth. He then plunges down to the pearl banks, hold ing in his arms a heavy diving stone, to which one end of a rope has been tied, the other end being held by the men iri the boat. When he reaches the bank he scrapes the oysters off the rocks with a sharp knife and puts es many as pos sible into a net bag fastened round his waist. The work has. to be done quickly because he can only stay under water for a short time, usually not longer than one minute. When he is ready to ascend he jerks the rope and is then hauled up to the boat. As soon as a T TNLIKE precious stones, pearls do ^ not have to be polished or cut, and when they are taken from the oyster shell they are at once drilled. At one time this was a slow and difficult pro cess, but now hundreds can be pierced in a day. The holes are made as small as possible in order not to take away any more of the pearl than is necessary, because these gems are sold by weight. It is essential for pearls to be handled carefully, as they are rather soft and therefore become scratched easily, and they are also affected by perspiration from the skin. ! The shells of the oysters are used for mother-of-pearl, which is manufac tured into buttons, knife handles, and dozens of other articles; and blister pearls, as they are called, are sometimes found attached to the inner surface of the oyster shell. If a burrowing worm or any other foreign matter enters the shell, the oyster stops the irritation by covering the intruder with a layer of pearl, and in this way the blister pearls are formed. When Cortes conquered Mexico in the sixteenth century, he found the Indians m possession of large quantities of pearls which they had obtained from the pacific Ocean, and later the Span iards organised the fishing and em ployed Indian divers. The season in this part of the world is much longer, lasting for four or five months. Pink pearls are sometimes found in oysters from the West Indies, but their colour ^es not last very well. 1the fleet Although the richest pearl banks are around Bahrein, the Sheikh receives no direct income from pearls. The revenue of his State is mainly derived from Customs duties upon imports. The value of the imports varies according to the success of the diving season, which lasts from the middle of May till the end of September, while the water is warm. On a day appointed by the Sheikh, which is announced by public proclamation, the pearling fleet, consisting of about 500 great sailing dhows, very like Roman galleys, sets out from Bahrein to the pearl banks, where they are joined by the fleets from the lesser Gulf ports. Until they clear the har bour the boats are propelled by heavy oars, each pulled by two men, who sing the song of the pearlers as they row. Often the fleet returns at night when the moon and the tide are full. The sound of the sailors chanting and the splash of the oars is carried across the still water to the town. The sight of hundreds of white sails, some of them coloured orange by the light of the fires burning on the decks, is one of the most picturesque in the world. Mechanical apparatus of any kind is for bidden, and the methods of diving have not changed since they were described by fourteenth- century travellers. Each diver wears a clip like a clothes-peg to close his nostrils, leather sheaths protect his fingers and enable him to — u from the rocks ''^ftrneath the sea, and each of his big toes is guarded by a similar sheath. He descends on a rope which has a stone weight attached to it. This is hauled up when he readies the bottom. Round his neck is slung a string bag, which he fills with shells, attached to a rope with which his comrade, the puller, draws him up again when he gives the signal. Divers remain below the surface for nearly a minute and a half, and they descend about 30 times in one day, often to a depth of 14 fathoms. The shells are heaped on deck during the day and opened in the evening under the vigilant eye of the captain, who puts away the pearls in his sea chest. No diver knows whether it is his shell that contained a pearl. While the men are working they take neither food nor drink, but they eat in the early morning and after sunset they have a meal of rice and dates and fish. The shells are thrown back into the sea, the divers believing that oysters feed upon the empty shells. They believe, too, that pearls are formed by drops of rain which are caught by the oysters at night. The work is very strenuous and conditions are hard, but the divers on the whole are healthy and many of them show unusually fine muscular development. The Arab, by nature improvident and thinking nothing of the future, has an ingrained instinct for gambling, and there is always the chance of belonging to a boat which finds a really big pearl. These charac teristics and the lack of other occupation have always been sufficient inducement to make Arabs become divers in spite of the hardships of the work. The men are paid no wages, but they receive a share in the profits of the season. Divers are entitled to twice the amount which is paid to a puller, as their work is more arduous. There are several different diving systems, and all of them are very ancient. Usually the captain of the boat borrows money from a merchant on shore to equip and provision his boat and to pay the two annual advances made to the divers at the beginning of -the season and halfway through the off season. At the end of the season the pearls are sold, the expenses of the expedi tion are deducted, the captain takes one-fifth of the profit, and the remainder is divided among the divers and the pullers. But the shore merchant charges interest on the money which he lent to the captain, and the divers pay interest on the money advanced to thcrnfighting, they tear their headcloths from then heads, seize each other by the heard', and often one of them rushes frantically from the room, but returns a moment later to make another offer. If many people are present and two men do not want their prices to be heard they adopt a different method. Each places his hand under a cloth, and they indicate the amounts by signs ; a grasp of the whole hand means J, Out), a touch on the palm means 500, a pressure of one finger means 100, and a pinch on the joint of a finger represents 10 One of the strangest facts in the peari trade is the ability of the pearl merchant to recognize a pearl he has not seen for many years; and, in addition to this, he keeps track of all the important pearls which are sold all over the world.

The Diving System in Bahrain is a profit sharing undertaking, divers do not rocolw pay but at tae end of the season they racuivc a share in the profits of the boat which is divided uiuong divers, pullers and nakhudi. Divers receive certain advances from their nakhudas during the off season and during the dive. The maximum amounts are laid down by Gove ma ant proclamation every year The advances preceding the present diving season were as follows;- diver puller fp (during the off season) its. 30/- Tesquaa (imediately before going to dive) 50/- EharJieh (in the middle of the season) EO/- 15/- acceptanoe of these advances binds the diver to work for his nakhud a during the following season. A diver who takes his Teaquam and fails to dive is liable to punish- Wi majority of divers are peruiansntly in debt to their , in spite of various regulations designed to put an end to this state of things. These debts vary from under 1 $, 50/- to over is. 1000/-. Old divers who worked before the Diving Kef orris were instituted have heavy debts, aenwho started diving since the Refoms cm small amounts, ine avurag® debt in these days is about &amp;&gt;• 200/-. Every diver has a small account book, issued by Oovern- aent, showing his financial iposition with debits of advances, &lt; interest on advances and credit from share in profits. Thoseaccounts are aupsrvlatju by Govermtient diTln^/, clerics, Intereot ia by ■.Qorermnmt order. Th i recruits wera onliated a. ^©w days before the ditlag began aM many of them had received Teaquan a advance, the aakbudas protested to bli© Bahrain Govern ment aaici i v { ! for the return of the divers who had talc en their advances. The Bahrain Govermaont decided that it waa reasonable and fair to refund to the nakiiudas the Taaquam which they had actually and recently advanced to the mn. This was dona ana a statement showing the sua returned to the aakhudaa is attached. Tills amount should be recovered from the levies by monthly deductions of fi$. 5/- per month during tea months of tee year, no deductions are mada during Ramadhan and Shawal. Apart from the Tesquaa, which the Govarnaant has refunded in cash to the naichudaa, most of the divers are indebted to the nakhudas on account of back advances. These debts have to be repaid by the divara as long as they fail to dive for the nakhudaa to whoithey are indebted. The debts vary in amount. A list of the awn and amounts is attached. It is the practice of the Bahrain Govemmant to deduct from all employees, State Police, Special Police, Hatura etc., and enployaes in the Bai-rain j-atrcleum Company fis. 5/- per fiioath if ther are divers indebted to nakhudas. H i Many of those pay off their debts in a short tjjre and in some cases the Government is able to persuade the nakhu das to reduce the debt on the condition that the lis. 5/- is collected and paid monthly to the nakhuda. It therefore results in all diver recruits having to■ . ■ @ &lt;m. ^ tm, or Uiiair 63# 5/- per moatii 'to their oakhudas. is wm.% moL-Uilf to the Adviaerat® and paid to the naJch «.aa who in aosm oasas have apaciaX accouats in the Co varum oat r^po&amp;it Aoaouat, ill© praotice ia a univ&amp;rsal one in Bahrain and has haaa worldag for mapy years.
