I discussed this proposal with the Prime ‘Sinister on January 5. He said that he much regretted the inability of his Government to avail themaelves of this generous offer, as they would have been glad to do if they had been in a position to disregard the machinations of , our common enemie8 , . If the Government of India could see thoir way to supply the spares for use by the Afghan Government in repairing their machines he would be grateful. I said this suggestion could not be accepted as In view of the machinations he had mentioned any inefficiency of repairs carried out as he proposed would be put down to the quality of the spares supplied by the Government of India o. me Mm 'now, in my opinion, M finally settled* 3d.

At this point I reminded His Excellency of his proposal, reported in my telegram No. 9 of the 14th January, that the Royal Air Force, India, should examine and report on une condition of the ineffective machines belonging to the nxghsr Government, with a view to their repair, and said I should be glad of a definite reply, as the Royal Air Force wished to isoose of their D.H.9A. spares, as soon as possible, if these we re not likely to be required. 6. Faiz Mu&amp;ammad apologised for the long delay which had occurred and said that, as I knew, the outburst of hostile pro- paganda wmch followed the acceptance of a loan and munitions from His Majesty's Government, had made it impossible to pursue tins proposal in the first instance. Later had come the discussions with the Soviet, of which he had told me, and negotiations, which were now pending, with Junkers for an air service, with Afghan participation, inside Afghanistan. Any agreement resulting from these discussions and negotiations ragnt provide for the overhaul of Afghan machines by foreign agency, and, although he would consult the Prime Minister again, ln re £ :ard to point I had raised, he did not see how any definite expression of their wishes could, in present circum- curnces, be offered by the Afghan Government. He quite realised that the question could not be left open indefinitely, and, if ' ile R ° yal Air ?orce &gt; Inaia, could not wait any longer, it would now have to be decided by His Majesty's Government. For the latter s iilingness to help, his Government were very grateful.1/ INDEXED Confiaential FILE COPY i', 5 0 P 2 L''. yh / rs Copy of a memorancLum No .D*3627-]p/31|» dat^d^the J 16th July 1931, from the Deputy Secretary to Goyernment of India in the Foreign and Political Department, to His Majesty’s Minister, Kabul. yK Heference correspondence ending with your memorandum No.491 dated the 20th of June 1931. jMt 'tv 2. The difficulty about keeping the spares in (question indefinitely on charge is that the bins in which they are stored are required for the spares for aircraft and engines now in use and also for the new types of aircraft which are expected in India in the autumn, 'fhe Boyal Air Force have, however, agreed to retain the spares on charge until October next by which time it may perhaps be expected that the Afghan Government will have decided whether it is desirable to have their aircraft overhauled and repaired by the Boyal Air Force in India or not.ItjS? t ■ 4243 * * From To FlLt GQP'y. 8 J /f K!

Please see Mr. Maconachie’s telegram of 14th January (Katodon ^ on i J .Z. 312/31) and the Government of India’s comments on it dated 31st January on P.Z. 608/31. The Air Ministry concur in the views expressed by the Government of India,in their letter of 7th February on P.Z. 803/31 (copy of which went to the Foreign Office), but action has so far been postponed because a decision to some extent depended on the decision to be taken in regard to the second instalment of the Afghan subsidy. It has now been agreed that this shall be restricted to £75,000^ and that being so, the Government of India’s proposal that certain miscellaneous expenses in connection with the present proposal should be met from the reserve of £25,000 retained in their hands presents no difficulties. There is general agreement as to the desirability of assisting the Afghans on the lines recommended by the Minister, and the detailed arrangements suggested by the Government of India appear satisfactory and have the approval of the Air Ministry, in these circumstances, I submit that the-** proposal may be sanctioned.

Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, to Secretary of State for India* Dated New Delhi, 25th January, 1931. Received 25th January, 1931, Hop-iiu XXX 269-3. First of Two Parte Your telegram 2575 ; August 9th, 1930, and our telegram 2666-S, of August 11th, 1930. We are satisfied that the conditions specified for the second instalment of financial assistance have been fulfilled, and that it should aiflount to £100,000 as already approved. Should, however, this amount be paid in lump sum, our present financial position would compel us to refuse future requests from the Afghan Government for material assistance in kind for some time to come. We consider, therefore, that it would produce better political results, since (? no) figure has been mentioned to the Afghan Government for second instalment, to give it in form of £75,000 as loan free of interest, and reserve £25,000 to meet expenditure in connection with the other requests, which it would be in our own interest to grant, 6og. ; overhaul of Afghan aeroplanes by the Royal Air Force, (reference to Katodon 9 of January 14th, 1931), and supplementing as might be necessary salaries paid by the Afghan Government to British professors, (reference to Forminka 58, September 26th, 1930.).From (COPIES CIPCULATED) 269-S (86 groups) COPY OF T E L E G R A M • Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, uo Secretary of State for India* Dated New Delhi, 26th January, 1931 Received 25th January, 1931, 10ep*m.
