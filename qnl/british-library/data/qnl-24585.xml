Sir: - I am directed hy the Board of Trade to acknow ledge the receipt of your letter of the 20th August (No. 38369) relative to certain criticisms of the In dian 'Bailway Board on the draft Convention with the Ottoman Government regarding railways in Asiatic Tur- ' I key. As Sir E. Grey is aware, the Board have always held the opinion that it would he impracticable to frame a convention which should of itself preclude every conceivable form, of discrimiiatlon or provide ef fectual means of remedying all instances of discrimina- -tion which might arise. They recognise that the ob servations of the Indian 'Railway Board are not with out force, but they doubt whether a more detailed con vention would have been less open than the present draft to the kind of criticism which the Railway Board advance. The Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.acivanca. Ths Convention is designed to place on record an agreement between the British and Ottoman Governments to certain definite principles and to give His Majes ty's Government a right of intervention should it ap pear that British and Indian traders and goods are being placed at a disadvantage by the infringement ef those principles; and in all the circumstances, and having regard to the considerations mentioned in the final paragraph of your letter, the Board are of opinion that it would be inadvisable now to attempt any further revision of the draft. At the same time they are disposed to think ^hat some effort might be made to meet the wishes of the Bailway Board in respect of notice of change of rates - \ by agreement with the German Government. I am ac cordingly to enclose draft of an 'Aide Memoire-which might if Sir E. Grey concurs be handed to Herr Huhl- mann as a first step. I have &amp;c., (Signed) H. Llewellyn Smith.kim hiAMK*. It is observed tiiat under Article 21 of the Gainer des Charges of the Bagdad Railway one month 1 s notice must be given of any increase of rates (within the prescribed maxima) but only three daynotice of any reduction. His Majesty’s Government are of opinion, however, that these periods are much too short having regard to the conditions under which European trade with Asiatic Turkey is carried on and the fact that contracts in respect of both imports and exports are as a rule made a considerable time before the goods are actually imported or exported. x, oreover,, in order to aiiord effect ive protection against discrimination it seems necessary to His Majesty’s Government to prescribe as long a period of notice for redactions as for increases of rates, and also to ensure ample publication of rates and conditions and proposals to vary them. His Majesty’s Government would therefore value an assurance, which might either be embodied in the Convention now under discussion with the Imperial German Government or given in ouch other way as may be most convenient, (e.g. by anan exchange of notes), that there shall he effective publi cation of all rates and conditions on the Bagdad Bailway and of all intended changes therein, and that the notice to be given of such changes shall not be less than two rnonthb in the case of both increases and decreases. jik* G^X'iLnr-*, ^kaunCP^nBii^ini E 1 ™ ',&amp; In any further communication on this subject, please quote N „. 38362/13. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Office, London.

The accompanying copy of a Memorandum hy the Railway Board on the 'Convention regarding the Railway in Asia Minor may 'be of interest to you, Yours sincerely, ^Tvlc Sir Arthur Hirtzel, K.C.B., Secretary, Political Department, India Office, LONDON. &lt; l r : LM E M 0 R A N D U M. As a Tsasis for an agreement the 'Convention regarding the Railway in Asia Minor' is no doubt of use, hut without more detailed specification of how the general terms are to he practically applied the 'Convention' aftapc offers considerable opportunities of preference being given without infringing the wording of the terms. For instance Article 2 without detailed regulations can be used to give preference to a very wide extent, A firm (A) may begin negotiating with the Railway Administration for lower rates for a particular item of traffic which will come on to or leave the line at either a maritime or riverine Port. The administration may agree that the rates shall be given but its introduction will he i deferred for a period. During this time the firm will ha.e the opportunity of making forward contracts at lower rates than the then-existing Railway rates would justify and on which its competitors are hasing their forward contract prices. Contracts having been made hy Firm (A) on the basis of the Railway rates being reduced the Railway Administration notifies the reduced rate and in accordance with Article 2 orders that they shall he applicable to imports and aborts inin whatever vessels they may he delivered at or exported from the Port. It must he admitted that this assumption is based on the Railway Administration not being free from guile hut this assumption is probably not unjustifiable. To make the clause really operative it will be necessary to sp ecify that no reduced rates shall be introduced until previous notice has been given, say 2 months* Article 4 - It would be useful to specify the steps which are to be taken to remedy the grievance. The Article admits that when British commerce is 'subjected' to any disadvantageous treatment a remedy shall be applied but without a procedure being laid down it may take montns before the grievance is remedied and in the meantime the other parties are benefiting largely. Supplementary detailed regulations are required, one of which should require that all rates and conditions quoted hy the Railway for all traffic shall he publicly advertised and in the event of any British merchant being of the opinion he was being subjected to disadvantageous treatment on representation to the Britieh Directors the latter should hare the right to call on the Railway Administration at once to investigate the complaint and come to a decision. Article 6. Considerable possibilities seem to be lurking in this paragraph. It would be very desirable ^— '4 m toto ask for its meaning to 'be fully amplified. Sd/- T. K.

Sir Edward Grey to Viscount Kitchener My Lord, Foreign Office, May 2, 1913. HAKKI PASHA, former Grand Vizier of Turkey who is at present m London m order to negotiate with His Majesty’s Government on behalf of the Sublime Porte certain conventions for the reconciliation of British and Ottoman interests in the legion of the Persian Gulf, told Sir L. Mallet on the 23rd ultimo that he expected that the rrench Government, like His Majesty’s Government, would insist on some compensation for their agreement to the increase of the Turkish customs duties from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, and that their demand would probably be for a concession to construct a railway from Rayak in Syria to El Arish on the Turco-Egyptian frontier. Such a concession, if acquired, would presumably have little value unless the Egyptian Government undertook to connect El Arish with the Egyptian railway system which, if this junction took place, would be in direct connection with the Bagdad Railway ^ It is welHhat Elis Majesty’s Government should be prepared with an answer for the event of the French Government, this concession having been obtained, approac nng them on the subject of a connection with the Egyptian system, and I should according y be glad if your Lordship would furnish me with your views on the subject. I may refer your Lordship in this connection to the following papers which should be found, either in original or in copy, in the archives of His Majesty s agency Mv desnatch No. 57 of the 7th April, 1909 ; Sir E.

In theory a limited period for increase of customs duty may be good, hut in practice concessions cannot well be withdrawn after expiration of time Constantinople, May 15, 1913. {May 15, 11'30 p.m.) limit. The assessment of 15 per cent, duty by means of a specific tariff would be preferable to the present system, and in framing the tariff provision should be made for periodical revision, and that no change in tariff should take place except with consent of and in consultation with His Majesty’s Government. Point 3. Embassy have sent in their reserves attached to application of temettu. Point 4 I have telegraphed in my immediately preceding telegram. Point 5. As regards Turkish request that His Majesty’s Government should agree to study the question of abolition of judicial side of Capitulations, it is to be remembered that for over five [group omitted : ? months] capital has been under martial law T administered by an irresponsible body which had not even a code of pro cedure and which has exercised the right to arrest and try foreigners. Common prudence would thus seem to dictate our refusal to undertake to study the point in question until Turkey advances to the point of constitutionalism enabling hei to govern without such ultra-legal methods. As regards Turkey’s amour-propre in the matter, it is believed here that demand for undertaking to study the matter is made by Committee party with the object ^of appearing to score a political success over their opponents, and to that extent to justify the coup d'Etat of 23rd January last. I would submit advisability in replying to point out that it is difficult for His Majesty’s Government to undertake to study the matter until Turkey has actually carried out concrete judicial reforms and until these have been in application long enough to test therm In light of last^ five years experience it would seem very risky to open the door to discussion on Capitulations until the new order of things attains greater consistency and stability. . , , In other countries, e.g., Roumania and Bulgaria, Capitulations have ceased rather less by automatic process than as the result of lengthy study and negotiation. &gt;v [686-409] 20 F/IAY1313[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty's Government.] * ASIATIC TURKEY AND ARABIA.

Bagdad Railway and Persian Gulf. The Negotiations with Hakki Pasha. ^° fo FO - S'C* il , REPORT. 5 For the last month or so the undersigned have met Hakki Pasha twice a week at the Foreign Office to discuss the various questions arising out of the British memorandum of 18th July 1912. I. The Shat-el-Arab arrangement presented no great difficulties except in matters of form. In Article 5 Hakki Pasha laid stress on the appointment of Turkish “ ad joints ” ; as they will have no special authority they will he unobjectionable. We have secured that the two chief officials shall be not only British but selected from candidates recommended by His Majesty’s Government. Article tig was inserted by Hakki Pasha in order to cover the rights of the Bagdad Railway Company to construct a port at Basra. Articles 7 and 8 are the upshot of much discussion. We wanted the judicial powers of the Commission to be wider—in fact we wanted it to be constituted a court of first instance for all purposes. But Hakki Pasha could not agree to this, and as it appears that the Danube Commission now has no larger powers than those, given by Articles 7 and 8, it did not seem politic to insist. The great object is that the local authorities should have as little opportunity as possible for thwarting the Commission, and that seems to be sufficiently assured. Article IF—Hakki Pasha was most unwilling to accept the maximum due, but we insisted, to some extent meeting him by Article 16, which, m effect, provides for a reconsideration of the limit in certain circumstances. Article 13.—We had proposed that the advance should be made by the two Governments, in order to be sure that some other Power did not step m. But Hakki Pasha was anxious that it should be the lurkish Government only, and the words “ apres entente avec le Couvernement Sa Majeste Britannique ” sufficiently serve our purpose. Article 14 presented considerable difficulty to Hakki Pasha, who wanted the Commission’s budget to be voted annually by the Turkish Parliament. This had to be strongly resisted. Article 19 was much discussed as regards police, whom Hakki Pasha wished to be lent by the Turkish Government. This would not secure them sufficient independence, and had to be resisted. A separate declaration provides that the Sheikh of Mohammera may entrust his interests to one of the Commissioners, meaning, of course, the British Commissioner. It will be necessary to supplement this by a agreement with the Sheikh binding him, his heirs and successors, to select the British Commissioner for the purpose. S. 204. ::: 40 *r ./ -w h 1 ; 1 F &lt; 2 , 1 1 K d,.. ^ | i sn As regards Koweit and the Persian Gnlf, Hakki Pasha produced a counterdraft to ours, which, though it contained objectionable features, we accepted as a basis for discussion. Article 1.—Turkish and British views were irreconcilable on the question of “ suzerainty ” and “ sovereignty,” but as the important thing is the rights actually secured for Koweit and renounced by Turkey in the rest o£ the convention, and as “ suzerainty” is itself not a wholly unambiguous term, we a „ ree d in return for satisfactory definitions in the subsequent articles, to omit either term, and to say that Koweit “ est un Gaza autonome de 1 Empire Ottoman.” In Article 2 Hakki Pasha laid stress on the Ottoman flag, and we accepted it, subject to the Sheikh’s right to mark it with a special device. This has been wanted locally for many years past, but the Sheikh was afraid of Turkish displeasure. The formula “ Le Gouvernement Ottoman s’abstiendra de toute immixtion dans les affaires de Koweit, y compris la question de la succession” was the result of much discussion. Hakki Pasha desired to say “ les affaires interieurcs” to which we insisted on adding “et exterieures,” without which neither the omission of reference to suzerainty or sovereignty nor the right to locate a Turkish agent at Koweit would be safe. Rather than accept this, Hakki Pasha would omit “ interieures et exterieures ” altogether, and we agreed to this subject to the signature of a separate secret note defining “ affaires ” as “ interieures et exterieures.” To this note Hakki desired to add that the Sheikh had not the right to conclude treaties (traite). In his counterdraft he had had a clause to the effect that the Sheikh could not in future conclude political agreements with foreign powers, and that economic agreements would require the sanction of the Turkish Government; but we had struck this out. We agreed to the addition to the note, with the insertion of the words “ contraire a la presente convention.” It is improbable that w 7 e shall evei again want to make a political treaty with Koweit which would conflict wdth the convention so long as the Turks observe it. The word “ traite ” would not, presumably, cover a lease of land ; but even that we are unlikely to wmnt. Hakki Pasha further claimed to regulate the succession in the Sheikh’s family. This we objected to, partly because it admitted Turkish interference, partly because it is contrary to British policy to recognise any but the de facto ruler. The formula which Hakki was induced to accept- that the Turks will name the successor a kaimmakam—is innocuous. In respect of Article 3 w r e were in some doubt as to whether the British right of pre-emption over certain lands (including Warba Island), given by the lease-agreement of 1907, should be specifically mentioned in the Convention. We were both agreed that it would be very impolitic to introduce it at the eleventh hour unless it was absolutely necessary. It seemed to be unnecessary for three reasons, (a) It wms carefully considered last summer what should be communicated to the Turks, and neither Sir P. Cox nor the Government of India, nor the India Office, nor the Foreign Office, then suggested men tioning the right of pre-emption. (b) The wording of the Convention is very vague; “la validite des concessions de terrains.” If the area of the ground leased had been defined, the Turks might have accused us of bad faith if it were afterwards to appear that w r e had rights over other ground ; as it is, we might have leased the whole of Koweit. (c) Now that Warba3 and the adjacent territory is formally secured to Koweit, while the railway is only to be continued to Koweit on conditions to be agreed to by us, the right of pre-emption loses much of its importance, its object having been to prevent the terminus of the railway from falling into foreign hands. We finally decided not to raise the question. Article 4.—Hakki Pasha was very anxious to have a re-assertion of Lord Lansdowne’s assurances of 1901, and there seemed no substantial objection to making it. Articles 5 and 7.—It seemed advisable to make the concession recognising two kinds of Koweit territory, and in return for it we got a rectification of our original southern border, so as to include Anta’a. Warba and Bubiyan, of course, were difficult for him to surrender, but we insisted. Article 6 secures for all practical purposes the same autonomy for the Sheikh in the larger as in the smaller area. We refused to allow a right of way for Turkish troops. In Article 8 Hakki Pasha tried to commit us to Turkish protection for the line and Turkish customs. The wording adopted leaves all such questions open, while making their ultimate, solution subject to British approval. Articles 10-13 evict the Turks completely from Bahrein and El Katr. In exchange we give them the island of Zakhnuniya (for which, however, they will pay the Sheikh of Bahrein 1,000Z.) and a small strip of coast. The safeguards required by the Government of India have been secured. We undertake not to annex Bahrein (but not, as Hakki Pasha desired, to abstain from altering the nature of our relations with it), and we undertake that the Sheikh of Bahrein shall not annex El Katr. III. In the declaration regarding the frontier near Mohammera a slight concession was made (after consultation with Sir P. Cox) in the northern part of the line, which will start at Um Chir and leave Kuskh-i-Basri to Turkey. On the Shat itself there was a direct conflict of opinion between Hakki Pasha and ourselves as to what the status quo is, he maintaining that the teiritory between Diaiji and the Nahr Nazaileh is in effective Turkish occupation, while we maintained the contrary. Einally he accepted our line with the proviso that if, on delimitation, it is found that the territory in question was m effective Turkish occupation on 1st January last, the line shall be rectified accordingly. There is very little likelihood that this will prove to be the case, but it may be noted that, even if it does, we get a lather better line than that given by the Mediating Commissioners in 1850, which left the Sheikh of Mohammera’s palace at Failiyeh in Turkish territory. His Majesty’s Government have, of course, to secure Persian acceptance of the line. IV. The British Memorandum of 18th July 1912 enclosed a draft convention on railway matters, but Hakki Pasha propounded a counter draft. This was quite unacceptable, and the Board of Trade prepared an alternative, which Hakki Pasha eventually accepted with some alterations (also prepared by Board of Trade) designed to avoid frequent disputes involving arbitration. Sir H. Llewellyn Smith took part in the discussion on this subject, and it is understood that he considers the result as satisfactory as any document islikely to be. Some additional safeguard against unfair differentiation in rates will be afforded by the presence of British directors on the Board. Altera tions in rates, according to Hakki Pasha, require the sanction of the Turkish Government, and it should be possible for the British directors to warn His Majesty’s Government if any alteration adversely affecting British tiade is proposed; but too much stress must not be laid on this, since it has been impossible to provide that the directors shall actually be nominees of His Majesty’s Government. V. Navigation of the Euphrates and Tigris. At an early stage Hakki Pasha threw out the suggestion of an amalgamation of all existing interests into one Turkish Company. We did not at the moment encourage the idea; but as time went on it was evident that other parties were moving and negotiations proceeding, and the Board of drade and India Office inde pendently arrived at the conclusion that our interests could best be secured by an amalgamation on terms which there w r as good reason to think that the Turks might accept. We accordingly informed Hakki Pasha that we thought we could meet his wishes in this matter, and put forward a draft convention which the Board of Trade had prepared. The Turkish Govern ment have made counter proposals which seem to accord in principle with ours, and the question is still under consideration. (Signed) 3rd May 1913. Louis Mallet. Arthur Hirtzel.

LOUIS MALLET. ARTHUR HIRTZFL. May 3, 1913. SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT. V.—Navigation of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates. A DRAFT Declaration by the Turkish Government on this subject has now been initialled ad referendum by Hakki Pasha and Sir H. Llewellyn Smith. The draft was prepared by the latter, and is the result of much anxious consideration by the British representatives, who have had the benefit of the advice of Lord Inchcape and Mr. Huth Jackson, and who have also repeatedly discussed with Mr. H. F. B. Lynch the position and’ambitions of his Company, which, at present, alone represents British interests on these rivers. The main object of His Majesty’s Government is to secure effective competition between river-borne traffic and the Railway, if and when the latter is extended from Bagdad to Basra, this being a necessary corollary of the withdrawal of our objections to the extension. In the first instance, the British Memorandum of the 18th July, 1912, had asked for three additional ships, which it was thought would, with Messrs. Lynch’s existing fleet, suffice for that purpose. But doubts suggested themselves, and the Board of Trade and India Office having independently come to the conclusion that it would be better served by some amalgamation of existing Turkish and British interests, which would secure control for the latter, it was decided to put forward a proposal to this effect to Hakki Pasha, who had already intimated that amalgamation was favoured by the Turkish Government, while the German Government had indicated their willingness to withdraw from the navigation on certain conditions. It was thought simpler to proceed by way of a Declaration embodying the main princijjles in a form as satisfactory as possible to Turkish amour-propre, and to leave the details upon which the effectiveness of British control will largely depend to be settled by a Convention between the Ottoman Government and the British concessionnaire. It •will be necessary that this Convention should be signed before the customs increase is finally approved. It is proposed that the concessionnaire should be Lord Inchcape, but that Mr. Lynch should be admitted to a share (not, however, amounting to control) in the new Company and should have a seat on the Board. The Declaration also provides (clause 7) that the Lynch Company should continue as a separate body on the basis of what His Majesty’s Government are prepared to regard as its actual rights. The British flag will thus remain on the river, and a British undertaking which has been in existence for over half a century need not lose its identity. This is much less than Mr. Lynch claims, but it is considered inadvisablenew control. that he should control both his own existing Company and the new one. At the same time, bis Company has been the pioneer m the river navigation, and is theiefoie justified in expecting some priority of rights. It has therefore been ai range with Lord Incheape that Mr. Lynch should receive, over and above the shares he may choose , to take up in the new Company, a certain number of fully paid-up shares as r a solatium It is intended that guarantees shall be given that both the_ British part of the Company and Messrs. Lynch shall remain permanently under effective BritishAgreement of January 23, 1899, with Sheikh of Koweit. (Translation.) Praise be to God alone ( lit . in the name of God Almighty) (“ Bissim Illah Ta’alah Shanuho ”).

March 1913. CONFIDENTIAL. em do ay mg tae reply ol ±lis Majesty's Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Bailway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard co the Bagdad Hailway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government^ should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Bailway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to he brought into contact with the Biverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Biverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern- (10135.) I have, &amp;c. E. GBEY. Enclosure. Memorandum communicated to the Ottoman Government. 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated [1370J Bment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex J). 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may he dealt with under three distinct headings : &gt; pr (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. . . . , . , , (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey m the region ot the Persian Griilf* (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Tndiafi trade amounts to some 60 per cenk of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the mariner in wdiich it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-halr centuries aM of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. _ t -x i • t i 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end:— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the . exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (?).) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of tlie railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. ; (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty m accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit ; nevertheless^ they cto not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made byHis Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Bailway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set fierth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the con- tention that^ there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Hey Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on che Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Eatr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Umpire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being- admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, nnd to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain— (a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development Annex Memo randum (Annexoi trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and. bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose tb~. continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look^ forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved f* relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty's Government m recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the’ region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. Annex 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

Annex 3. Draft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-ehArab Navigation Commission. THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have agreed as follows :— 1. The navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. 2. The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty.

The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, hut the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall be of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties . (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions oi all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. . . (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. . , , i x e ) The buovin S and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control ot the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified m the Schedule to this Convention. . , ,, p (f.)

The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enab e it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. , . • j In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached, is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact ot navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. _ _ . 10. Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong.

In case neither of the contracting parties shall have given notice to the other, twelve months before the expiration of the said period of twenty-one years,, of the intention to terminate the agreement, it shall remain in force until the expiration of one year from the day on which either of the contracting parties shall have denounced it. Annex 4. Koweit. HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Badaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanamand Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Biyadh. . . n ^ Districts and Islands.— The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Biqa’i. In the northern block he the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah and Zor. T e southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib * and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Kioweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and kuda . The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Eailakah which with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated kt the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim. A map is enclosed showing tiie limits of Koweit. Annex 5. Mohammerah Frontier. [Four Maps mentioned in this Annex not reproduced.] HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern- ment of the g-at importance which they attach to the mamtenance of the fronts ^ f mm ns locallv observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. _ . TfS MaTesty’s hvernment now have the honour to explain their views in greater . t •? „ nd they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only Smined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, winch was laid before the [1370]conference of Erzoroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study r of the territorial position m the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. ^ Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Eizeroum, has been traced m the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on dnect tiade w r ith Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point 'where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beui Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia : in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Plawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more unpertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, 'whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it asa pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquae of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “ thalweg ” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:—(ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. ... . (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.[13432] No. 1. Foreign Office to Board of Trade.

Dear Sir Gerard Low ther:- A few days ago I had a conversation with Gunther about the plans for the railway buildings and Customs dep&amp;te at Bagdad. The provision of new Customs buildings is a matter of urgency. The existing build ings are dilapidated and insufficient and it has been found impossible to procure suitable storage space else where in the town. In the interests of counerce and to avoid claims for damage, the Turkish Government must there fore take measures promptly to deal with the situation and inasmuch as the site for the railway dep3ts and station has now been definitely fixed on the right bank of the river, it has been decided that the new Customs depots, and particularly the transit depots, should be constructed in proximity to the railway buildings. Preliminary negotiations for the purchase of land re quired have already taken place and a vote on account will ie Right Honourable Sir G.Lowther, G.C.M.G.,will 1)6 put into the forthcoming budget. In connection with those projects a question has arisen as to tho desirability of allowing the Customs depSxs and transit depots to be constructed and managed by the Company, on a scale of warehousing charges to be approved by the Customs, on lines similar to those recently settled in connection with the port of Beyrouth, The estimate put before the Government for the construc tion of these buildings, including the Customs offices. involves an expenditure of about £100,000, of vhich the larger portion would be absorbed by transit dep&amp;ts. It is probable that tho Govemaant ’.-ill eventually abolish tha transit duty on goods in transit to and froa Persia via Bagdad, and in any case the amount of ravonuo derived from the existing transit duty is so aaall that the fiscal interest In this traffic would not alone justify a large expenditure on buildings for its accomodation. Loroovar, the Kailway Company has under its concession the right of monopoly in the construction of general warehouses and bonded warehouses at Bagdad and froiu this point of view the concentration of the ware housing privileges for dutiable and transit gooas in thethe Company's dep3ts, subject to proper control for revenue purposes, would in many cases relieve the goods from double handling charges. Consequently we are of opinion that it would oe in the interest of the Govern ment and also of commerce that the warehousing of all goods subject to customs control, including goods in transit, should be undertaken by trie Railway Company, and that the Company undertake the cost of erecting the necessary buildings, the outlay for which would be com pensated by a scale of warehousing charges to be approved by the Customs and which would in any case be lower than the regulation 'ardieh” imposod in custom ware houses. In connection with the transit traffic it is also to be noted that it is contemplated that the manipulation of these goods will be later on transferred to Hannekin, so that any buildings constructed at Bagaad in respect of tills trade would probably be light constructions, capable of removal afterwards to Hannekin. Bo far as re-j gards the goods destined for consumption and distribu tion in the town of Bagdad the Railway Company would undertakeundertake to provide suitable means of free transport from the right bank to the left bank of the river pend ing the construction of proper railway communication with the town. (Signed) Yours sincerely. R.P.Orawford.CONFIDENTIAL (10135.) (Confidential.) Your Hio-hness Sir Edward Grey to Tew fib Pasha. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912, I HAY E the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply ol HiS Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Bailway and the Persian Gulf. In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard to the Bagdad Bailway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Bailway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the Turkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mohammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Biverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to be said for an International Biverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government. I have, &amp;c. E. GBEY. 1 Enclosure. Memorandum communicated to the Ottoman Government. 1. HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern- r -370] BSSSSgpfir ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— i i • i x- , 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings : (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. .... ^ (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (hi.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex 3). ¥ • (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5. The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6. It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. HLs Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the c instruction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made byHis Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth m the lurkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8. His Majesty;s Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeated y given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10. His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction oi occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise l urkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojen, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memoiandum in any way inv alidates the statement that south of Ojeir, m the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount ■ and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11. His Majesty s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula of El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12. The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Kovveit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development Annex Memo randum (Annexof trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they looly forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved ^ relations which cannot fail to ensue. . , . , , , 17 As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question wlncn nas caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. A hen His Majesty s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty vears, and His Majesty s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gyll could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential paid of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. Jf the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. Annex 1. HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6. The Commission shall be charged with the following duties : (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (c.)

The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8. No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it.

Annex 4. Koweit, HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line running from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the Na’airijah hill at the north-western corner of Badaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Summan from Dahanah as far south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Biyadh. Districts and Islands. —The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Biqa i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-abKhilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-al- Maradim.

[Four Maps mentioned in this Annex not reproduced.] HIS Majesty’s Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern ment of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the fiontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views m greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [1370] Dn 'u ■&lt;- Vifid recourse to the o^re&amp;t store of conference of Erzeroum, bnt they he c , T • afterwards Sir Henrvt information collected by the well-known samnt Major ^ Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the count ^’ a “h ' t^orical facts and of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region based ^ the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of la “ l F ®um hS been traced Tn which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Eizeroum, has been traced m The voluminous records of the East India Company, who earned on direct trade with Bussorali from the year 1635. These records are especially ^mating - -gard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the bhattnel-Arab during Tire accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been ocally observed for a centimy or more. For facility of reference, the line may he followed, firstly from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the pom where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu aib will be observed at a point 15J miles on a bearing of 8 degrees nort h of west from Hawizeh: it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some oOO inhabitants living m permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basn is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. , . . These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, w ic as been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula” ruler of Hawizeh, who m turn paid it to the 1 ersian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. r 0 i &gt; -u- + ^ To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. . ^ The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants w ho could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— At. 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia : in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dw^ell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ”Hor Turkey to claim it asa pretext for proposing something else, viz., that the Kerkha should he adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to tlm neighbourhood of the Shatt-el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying maps Nos. 3 and 4), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid-stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Government in many ways and on many different occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in, for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquae of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See maps Nos. 3 and 4.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “thalweg” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty’s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will _ accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions . (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. j i • u (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and wlnci may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian bank below the Nahr Nazaileh.fii) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karan, to be recognised as ^ within Peraian^nnsdiction^o (See existing &amp;s ^ ng rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. , i -n • u i i c j (v ) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. _ + .

Dear Nicolson:- In view of your letter we cannot press you further to alter the wording of the Memorandum for the Turkish Amhassador. We must therefore trust that your belief that our objects will be attained by means of the Annex will be justified by the course of the negotiations. Our fear was that the relegation of this important subject to the Annex would mean that it would be dropped at an early stage. I am encouraged by your letter to hope that this is not the intention, but that a serious effort will be made to secure the concession we desire. I am glad that you have omitted the words in the Annex to which I called Mallet’s attention. I am clear that without some tariff concession the whole Convention will be regarded by our Commercial people as a very bad bargain, and I do not envy those who have to defend it. Yours sincerely. (Signed) H.Llewellyn Smith.FOREIGN OFFICE. July 12th 1912. Dear Sir Hubert Sir L.Mallet has shown me your letter of yesteiday. I submitted the question of the Annex to Sir E.Grey yesterday, and he considered that the wishes of the Board of Trade would be sufficiently met by the procedure suggested. Lord Crewe, I understand, is opposed to the Question of cotton duties being intro- duced into the negotiations at all, and the India Office has only agreed under protest to the Annex being attached to the Memorandum - I am quite sure that the insertion of the words (p. 2 .a.) would not be accepted by Lord Crewe - and as we consider that the annex sufficiently covers the question to which you attach importance, and as it is most desirable to communicate without more delay the Memorandum to Tevfik Pasha, I am quite sure that you will see that further discussions on this one point are undesirable. The political con siderations are, in our view, really paramount, and we hope that we have at the same time secured the interests in which you are principally interested.In the Annex I have eliminated the words 'as it is noo germane to the subjects discussed in that document' as I gather that you did not quite agree to them. (Signed) A.Nicolson.Dear Mallet: Stanley has just passed, on to Maxwell enclosing a proposed 'Annex” to he substituted lor the paragraph proposed by us in the Memorandum for the Turkish Ambassador. Ha has I understand replied that the matter is now in the Presidents hands. As a matter of fact Mr. Buxton has already written to Sir E. Grey and to Lord Crewe giving them our view of the pro posal of the India Office to drop the question of Cotton duties altogether. The suggestion that the paragraph relating to the matter should be removed to a separate paper, though I think it is a pity, does not appear to me to be so objectionable that we need oppose it, provided that the words in your original draft (see page 2 (a) of the print) 'as well as an undertaking explained in a sex^ar- ate paper as to the treatment of certain British imports' are restored. You will remember that we deleted these wo resopy. 1ECRET. 29 6 63) A ^ 'he resident . BAGDAD PAILWAY AND PERSIAN frUT.'R NEGOTIATIONS , I understand that the India Office take exception to the proposal that we have put forward, that our consent to the increase in the Turkish Customs Duties should he conditional ( inter alia ) on an agree ment fixing certain maximum specific rates for the Duties on certain classes of Cotton Goods of special in terest to British trade, including, of course, under this head Indian Cottons as well as those from the United Kingdom. I do not think you should agree to this omission. Even, as it stands, the proposed Convention with Turkey will he strongly criticised as involving an excessive sacrifice to British trade. It will he said that while there may he gains to India in the provisions for safe guarding the political situation in the Persian Gulf and preventing the Bagdad Failway from being ex tended south of Busreh, the only guarantee that could really he effective for the fair treatment of British trade on the railways passing through Bagdad (namely participationparticipation in the Southern Railway to a degree sufficient to prevent hostile discrimination) has already been omitted, and that the Convention pro viding against differential treatment is a very poor substitute for such a guarantee. On the other hand, the financing of the railways over which we shall have no effective control is to be facilitated by a ^ in crease in the Turkish Duties, the great bulk of which will be borne by British Trade. The greater part of this trade is not concerned with the Persian Gulf at all, but enters European or Asiatic Turkey at Con stantinople, Smyrna, and other places. British Ship owners,may also complain that, for the first time, their vessels are to be subjected to Tonnage Dues on the Shatt-el-Arab. I do not see what effective answer could be made to these criticisms. The Board of Trade, however, have been very anxious not to obstruct a settlement which is desired on political grounds, and they have # therefore agreed to the #c increase subject only to a reservation which in the circumstances seems very moderate and reasonable. As this matter of Customs Duties, however, is somewhat technical it is necessaryto go into the matter in some detail, it is the general experience of British trade that ad valorem duties, though harmless and convenient so long as the rates are kept low, are a dangerous menace to honest trade as soon as they are raised to a high enough level to encourage fraudulent under-valuations - this is especially the case in an Oriental country where the Customs Service is not free from corruption. It is creditable to British traders that the evidence shows that in circumstances of this kind it is our trade that usually suffers as compared with our com petitors. Consequently our commercial advisers c usually recommend the conversion of an ad valorem tariff into specific rates as soon as the tariff is raised above a certain level. Probably in Turkey the present rate of Duty, 13/£ is about as high as is safe on an ad valorem basis. In any case we should not regard an ad valorem tariff of 1^2 without grave apprehension, except on the assumption that it would be speedily converted into specific rates on a basis, both as regards categories and duties not unfavourable to our interests. It is obvious, however, that in such a conversion very important questions of classifica tionclassification are tound to emerge, on which the opportunity will arise for discrimination for or against our trade. It may possibly he suggested that the object we have in view might be attained by a clause in the present Convention, providing that as soon as possible an agreement shall be arrived at for the conversion of the tariff into specific rates. Unfortunately there are strong objections to this course. The conversion of the whole Turkish Tariff into a specific tariff would require a series of commercial negotiations between Turkey and all the different Powers. These negotiations are almost certainly to be prolonged, and probably would be fruitless. Meanwhile, our trade will be subject to the disadvantage of the high ad valorem duties. Moreover, in these future negotiations we shall be at a very great disadvantage. All the other Powers will have effective weapons, in that they will have something to offer in return for reductions of Turkish Duties. We, on the other hand, shall have thrown away our weapon and shall be practically helpless. The proper, and perhaps the only, opportunity of safeguarding our interests in this matter\[y (r matter is afforded dy the present negotiations with the Turks, when we have still something to offer them in return. The proposal that we have made is a simple one, viz., to schedule a comparatively small number of important classes of cotton goods and to attach specific rates to these classes which must not be exceeded. This would not involve any negotiations with third parties, and we have yet to find that the Turks would regard the proposal with disfavour. Of course if Turkey were content to postpone the in crease of duties until the specific tariff were com pleted to our satisfaction, we could at once agree; but it is extremely unlikely that Turkey would accept such a proposal. The Board of Trade must therefore press that the omission suggested by the India Office should not be made. At a later stage of the negotiation, when the time comes for considering what reductions it is \ possible and politic to make in our first demands, the Board of Trade will not show itself unreasonable in ' considering any Turkish objections to the proposed scale of Duties.

[July 18.] Section 1, [28322] No. 1 . Sir Edward Grey to Tewfik Pasha. (Coimdential.) Your Highness . i H A V-L the honour to transmit to your Highness herewith a memorandum embodying the reply ol His Majesty’s Government to the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last, relating to questions connected with the Bagdad Railway and the Persian Gulf. ' In communicating this document to your Highness I desire to call your attention to two additional points which are not dealt with in the memorandum or its annexes. In the first place His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable, in order to secure the smooth working of the arrangements proposed in regard r,o the Bagdad Railway, that at least one British director, approved by His Majesty’s Government, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Railway Company. Such an arrangement would of course require the consent of the German Government. Secondly, as the lurkish Government are aware, certain rights are secured to Persia under the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), and the geographical position of Mobammerah is such that the sheikh cannot fail to be brought into contact with the Riverain Commission ; and unless provision is made for these facts there is a risk of the friction arising which it is the object of the two Governments to avoid. There would have been much to De said for an International Riverain Commission on which Persia, equally with Great Britain and Turkey, should be represented. But as His Majesty’s Government, appreciating the objections entertained by the Porte, have not pressed for this, it is necessary to provide in some other way for the representation of Persia in such matters as may touch her rights whether under the Treaty of Erzeroum or under this new agreement. His Majesty’s Government therefore propose that the commissioner who is a British subject should be charged with the duty of making to the commission such representations as may at any time be necessary upon any question affecting those rights, and they will be willing to use their good offices with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to agree to this arrangement. These two points come, perhaps, outside the scope of the matters dealt with in the memorandum which are confined to subjects of negotiation between Great Britain and Turkey alone, but His Majesty’s Government attach great importance to them and trust that they will receive the favourable consideration of the Imperial Ottoman Government.

Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individ^M^Ttuse,may imply, but also in its cumulative [2546 s—1] ' ~ Band future effects upon Anglo-d urkisfi relations m general. His Majesty s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— . 3 . For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt wdth under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (hi.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4 . The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5 . The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other points enumerated in this memorandum. 6 . It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end:— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. ( 6 .) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the construction or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction wdth the accompanying memorandum (Annex No. 5 ) on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/•) Permission to be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah hi addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Bersian Gidf. 7 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty m accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the -Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made bya ksj teas teyi r w forth in tlie Turkish memorandum of tlm loth April S modlficatlon of the «et ^ntion^atSt a mSC^^ ^.tbe con repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to^the fffect’ that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrdn Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf 7 ' ’ 9. I he original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurance were reported have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy g ’ 10 . His Majesty s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s evnnditmn there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish iScrion 01 occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise \nnex 4 SO tr eigntj bet m eei l th u south u ernmost limits of Koweit (L hereinafter defined) ^ and Ojen they aie unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish emoiandum m any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district o El Katff, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they aie fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. g P or themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances thefubHmelw a^hd^r Ver “ r6garded ^ they ^ re P eatedl y illfo ™ ed f(l l L His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settleinent between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa they have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12 . The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by M Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with (Annex 4). the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their pc hey in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain—(a.) To control surveying, lighting, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine arrangements. 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simply to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things which, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the developmentof trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16 They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forwar^ confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improve relations which cannot fail to ensue. . 17 As the Ottoman Government are. aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Maiesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1011 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of it as an essential part of the present negotiations. ihey have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Poweis, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase m the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period. Foreign Office, July 18, 1912. ANNEX 1 . HIS Majesty’s Government wish to mention a question to which they attach great importance, but to which they have not referred in this memorandum. His Majesty’s Government desire to secure that the duties leviable upon certain classes of cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain rates to be agreed upon. His Majesty’s Government will furnish the Ottoman Government, with the least possible delay, with a schedule specifying these classes of goods and the duties to be applied to them. Foreign Office.

D? aft Convention for the Establishment of a Shatt-el-A.vab Navigation Commission. _ THE Government of His Britannic Majesty and the Government of His Imperial Majesty the Sultan of Turkey, being desirous on account of the magnitude of their interests in the trade on the Shatt-el-Arab to improve the navigation of that river, and to diminish the risks to which commerce thereon is exposed, have aoreed as follows:— 1. I he navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab shall remain open to the ships of all nations. 2 . The Imperial Ottoman Government will establish a Commission in which shall be vested the control of the Shatt-el-Arab from Kurna to the sea. 3. The Commission shall consist of two members only, to be appointed by the Imperial Ottoman Government. One of these two members shall be of British nationality, and shall be selected from candidates suggested by the Government of His Britannic Majesty. [2546 s—1] 0 C6 4 . Each of the Commissioners shall receive annually a salary of £ T. 2,000 free of all deductions. These salaries shall be paid by the Commission. 5 . The Commission shall appoint such officers and employes as may be necessary, but the Chief Engineer and the Surveyor shall he of British nationality. The salaries of such officers and employes shall be fixed and paid by the Commission. 6 . The Commission shall be charged with the following duties : (a.) The execution of such works as may be necessary for the improvement of the channel of the river and of the approaches thereto on the seaward side. (b.) The maintenance of the channel of the river free from obstructions of all sorts, so as to keep it in the best possible state for navigation. (c.) The preparation, issue, and enforcement of regulations for the navigation of the river and for the policing of the river and the land and buildings held by the Commission. (d.) The control of pilotage. (e.) The buoying and lighting of the channel, and the maintenance and control of the lights and buoys in the approaches to the river specified in the Schedule to this Convention. (/.) The supervision, so far as may be necessary for carrying out the purposes of this convention, and subject to the treaty rights of foreign Powers, of the wharves, quays, docks, and jetties belonging to private persons in or on the banks of the river, and the provision of such additional accommodation and facilities as the Commission may deem necessary. 7. The Imperial Ottoman Government undertakes to facilitate the acquisition by the Commission of such land as the Commission shall consider necessary to enable it to carry out effectually the duties assigned to it. The cost of such land shall be paid by the Commission. In cases where land to which fishing rights are attached is required by the Commission, no unnecessary interference with such fishing rights shall take place. 8 . No dues, taxes, or charges shall be levied either by the Porte or by the Commission on ships or goods on the Shatt-el-Arab based on the mere fact of navigation. 9. The Commission shall have the sole right to levy any dues or charges that may be found necessary to cover the expenses of works undertaken and services maintained by it. In the event of such dues being found necessary they shall not exceed the amount reasonably required for the above purposes, including the administration of the Commission, and their produce shall be exclusively applied thereto, any surplus being devoted to the reduction of dues. In no case shall the rate of dues exceed 1 fr. per net registered ton of shipping. 10 . Any dues or charges levied by the Commission shall be levied impartially and equitably in respect of all vessels, whatever be the places from or to which they arrive or depart, or the nations or persons to which the vessels or their cargoes belong. Similarly there shall be no differentiation in the matter of facilities between vessels or goods of different nations or persons, or between vessels arriving from or departing to different places. 11 . Any sums which it may become necessary for the Commission to borrow for the purpose of carrying out the duties imposed upon it shall be advanced by the high contracting parties at a rate of interest not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, in such proportions and upon such terms as to repayment as they may arrange. 12 . The control of all funds raised and expended by the Commission shall be vested exclusively in the Commission. 13. The Commission shall publish annually complete and accurate accounts, showing the amounts received and expended by it. 14. If the receipts of the Commission are insufficient to cover its ordinary- expenditure the deficit shall be made good by the Imperial Ottoman Government. 15. In the event of the members of the Commission being unable to agree as to whether any particular works are or are not necessary for the improvement of the Shatt-el-Arab, or as to the way in which particular works should be carried out, the question shall be referred by them to an engineer of repute, to be agreed upon by the commissioners, or, failing agreement, to be nominated by the president of the Institute of Civil Engineers in London, and the decision of such engineer shall be adopted by the Commission. 16. The Commission shall correspond upon all matters connected with the duties entrusted to it with the Sublime Porte direct, and not through the local authorities.17.

ANNEX 5. Mohammerah Frontier. HIS Majesty’s ^ Government have already informed the Imperial Ottoman Govern- nient of the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their statement by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the [2546 s —1] Dconference of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known sav&amp;nt Major (afterwards uir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position m the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating m legard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab duiing the 17th and 18th centuries. . . The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed for a century or more. For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstlv, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to' the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in permanent dwellings. The whole country, comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib, and Kuskh-i-Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term, but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above referred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Ivhuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries. They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs, who formerly passed it on in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agency of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations have served to confirm the information which His Majesty’s Government already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status quo. The view universally expressed as to the frontier was as follows :— 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, ipso facto, the frontier of Persia: in other words, that the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2. That the “Hawizeh district” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1. It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor-el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due west of Kuskh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt-el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri is recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regulated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safely dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were not usually marked by excessive moderation, admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subsequent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view’ that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it asfe P btnkry7bZ 0 Sfrir etMng that tlle Kerkha sho &gt;^ be adopted as ^ frontier as locally the Turkish Customs Post at Di’ai i between the ‘bo obanne! running from and Aqawat, to the junction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the° • a ' ll!ll&gt;l .''ah, Bowarin, between the Nahr Di’aiji and the iffoK ^^ 0 ^ Nahr Khaiym until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nah? Nazaileh meet the mam channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See man No 2 ) ' XT ^ ‘ben proceeds as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying mans !&amp;?S.t S3 - ““ «WS The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives « f , ‘be Turkish Government in many ways and on many different ocdsimis Thus t ere is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities who on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr V a JV n ldS a ', ays b e .® n undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah m, for instance, the islands of Akawat Barm or Bowarin, Shamshamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. J From _ the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab‘it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See mans Nos. 3 and 4.) 1 ’ This line of demai cation is in accordance with the general presumption that where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “thalweg” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. . r ^ le records of the past 30(3 years, as contained in the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession” of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no express stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river. If, therefore, His Majesty’s Government had strict regard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious to arrive at an arrangement which both parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between themselves, but also between the Sublime Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already indicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where the Khaiyin Canal and the Nahr Nazaileh enter the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Govern ment and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions :— (i.) The following islands to be recognised as within the territorial limits of Persia:— (cl.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the four islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected at low water either with Abadan Island or with the Persian hank below the Nahr Nazaileh.m. p M ii i (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty s Government for maintaining full freedom of navigation on the river, and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman Government. (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Mohammerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt-el-Arab above and below its junction with the Karun, to be recognised as ^ within Persian jurisdiction. (See Map No. 2.) (iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-w T ater mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing 'proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory. i % hi * IIii any further communication on this subject, please quote no. 28322/12. and address— The Under-Secretary of State, Foreign Oihce, London. r A/- Urgent and Confidential. r\ &lt; s d i' M..- Foreign Office 17th.

He would be glad to be furnished with the observations oi the Secretary of State for India on this document at the earliest possible moment. The maps are in course of preparation. Beyond the indications contained in the draft memorandum, it is only O’ G I necessary to observe that the proposed line, after leavin. the liahr Khaiyin, follows the midstream of the Shatt-el-Arab(28322/12). to a point some One thousand yards below the junction of that river and the River Karun: it then follows the Persian bank oi the Shatt-el-Arab, including within Persian territory the islands specified by Sir P. Cox (see his telegram of July oil h .

HIS Majesty’s Government have already iaitl Imtem the Imperial Ottoman Government the great importance which they attach to the maintenance of the frontier status quo, as locally observed, in the neighbourhood of Mohammerah. His Majesty’s Government now have the honour to explain their views in greater detail, and they would preface their state ment by observing that they have not only re-examined all the evidence, both oral and documentary, which was laid before the confer ence of Erzeroum, but they have also had recourse to the great store of information collected by the well-known savant Major (afterwards Sir Henry) Rawlinson, who was well acquainted with the country, and made a profound study of the territorial position in the Mohammerah region, based upon historical facts and the deeds of title relating to each particular plot of land. Moreover, &gt; much information, which was not at the disposal of the Commissioners at Erzeroum, has been traced in the voluminous records of the East India Company, who carried on direct trade with Bussorah from the year 1635. These records are especially illuminating in regard to the conditions which actually prevailed on the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab during the 17th and 18th centuries. The accompanying maps indicate the line of the frontier as it has been locally observed^ao fay ■ tefcafcfet 1111 1 11 111J nf~tl11 nil l'ti' iii_ inlmbitnnf For facility of reference, the line may be followed, firstly, from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point where it strikes the Shatt- el-Arab, and, secondly, along the course of that river until it reaches the sea. By reference to the accompanying map No. 1, the village of Shu’aib will be observed at a point 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees north of west from Hawizeh : it is a settled village of the Beni Salih, containing some 500 inhabitants living in [806J B j ! / if !.Iir 2 pennanent dwellings. Thd whole country, com prised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Sbu’aib, and Kuskh-i- Basri, is regularly occupied and cultivated by the tribes of Beni Salih, and Beni Sakain, who are not nomadic, in the ordinary sense of the term; but are settled inhabitants. These tribes, who exclusively inhabit, and where possible cultivate, the triangular tract above re ferred to, have belonged from time immemorial to Hawizeh, which has been a recognised district of the Persian province of Khuzistan or Arabistan for, at any rate, four centuries: They pay revenue to their tribal sheikhs* ■ who formerly passed it on- in tribute to the “ Maula ” ruler of Hawizeh, who in turn paid it to the Persian Government, but, since 1902, this tribute has been collected through the agencybf the Sheikh of Mohammerah. To the eastward of the marsh on which the village of Shu’aib is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there h not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction, nor of Turkish status. The British Resident in the Persian Gulf has recently visited the Hawizeh district, and his investigations liavC served to confirm the in formation which His Majesty’s Government'' already possessed. Apart from the sheikhs and tribesmen of the Beni Salih and Beni Sakain, Sir Percy Cox came in contact with many old inhabitants who could speak with long experience in regard to the territorial status guo. The view universally expressed as r to the frontier w~as as follows — 1. That whatever is the western boundary of the Hawizeh is, iyso facto, the frontier of Persia : in other words, that- the Hawizeh district is included within the confines of Persia. 2 . That the “ Hawizeh district ” comprises those lands which are regularly occupied and cultivated by tribes belonging to it, and paying revenue to Persia. 3. That, on the above premises, the boundary locally recognised is that shown by a green line on map No. 1 . It will be noticed that the line (which is formed by the edge of the marsh, and' is thus a natural frontier), after crossing the Ghor- el-Azem, eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shu’aib, continues in a southerly direction until it reaches a point due°west of Kuskh-i-Basri, whence it breaks back to that place, and then proceeds direct to the Shatt- el-Arab at Di’aiji. The reason why Kuskh-i-Basri as recognised as an angle of the boundary is referable to the existence of a winter lake of rain water at Yafair; the limit of cultivation and occupation by tribesmen under Hawizeh in this direction is regidated by the distance from their water supply (Yafair), at which they can safety dwell and keep their flocks, and this limit is considered to be -reached at Kuskh-i-Basri, where the ruins of an-extensive building of great age form a convenient landmark. His Majesty’s Government, being in possession of precise and trustworthy information regarding the frontier of Hawizeh, have no occasion to appeal to more uncertain authorities, but they think it is not without interest to recall to the Imperial Ottoman Government that Dervish Pasha, whose estimates of Turkish claims were -not usualty'unarked by excessive moderation, •admits in Chapter XIII of his book (printed in Constantinople in 1868), “ that it would be hardly right ” for the Ottoman Government to lay claim to the country of Hawizeh, though, in the subse quent chapter, his Excellency expresses the view that it “ might be useful ” for Turkey to claim it as a pretext for proposing something else,-viz., that the Kerkha should be adopted as the boundary above Sheria. Coming now to the neighbourhood of the Shatt- el-Arab, the frontier as locally observed enters'the Khaiyin Canal (which is the name of the channel running from the Turkish Customs Post at Di’aiji, between the islands of Kharnubiyah, Bowarin, and Aqawat, to the juuction of the Nahr Nazaileh with the main stream) at a point between the Nahr Di’aiji and the Nahr Abul Arabid; it follows the middle of the Nahr Khaiyin until it reaches the point where the Nahr Khaiyin and the Nahr Nazaileh meet the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab. (See map No. 2.) It then proceeds, as shown by the broken black line (see accompanying map Nol dj), along the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, in mid stream, until that river reaches the Persian Gulf. The claim made by Persia rests on continued and undisturbed possession for over a century, and on the recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Govern- ment in many ways and on many different [806J B 2occasions. Thus there is unanimity of evidence amongst the local tribesmen that the boundary as locally observed has not been questioned by the Turkish authorities, who, on the contrary, many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit as a permanent boundary mark ; and it further appears that the periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin has always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, whilst the [cleaning of the Di’aiji Canal has been carried out exclusively under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. The local inhabitants moreover draw a very clear line of distinction between the position of the Sheikh of Mohammerah in', for instance, the islands of Akawat, Barin or Bowarin, Sham- skamiyah, and Umm-ut-Tuwaileh, of the greater part of which he is merely proprietor, and his position on the Persian side of the locally recognised boundary. ■ at the Turkish Govern- l the line^fecommended g Commissioners, have *ow ior sixty Wars, in ndfcated on map No. 2 m by local/usage witk- re territorial status quo r ernmen(fhave referred ; ortanate to its continued :y mnain indifferent if disturb it. From the point where the locally observed frontier leaves the Khaiyin Canal and, opposite the Nahr Nazaileh, enters the main channel of the Shatt-el-Arab, it follows the medium filum aquce of the Shatt-el-Arab down to the Persian Gulf. (See map No. 3.) This line of demarcation is in accordance with the general presumption that, where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or “ thalweg ” is the actual line of separation between those two States. Such a presumption may, however, be swept away, either by proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession on the part of one of the two States, or by express treaty stipulation. The records of the past 300 years, as contained m the official archives of the East India Company and of His Majesty s Government, are far from supporting any claim on the part of Turkey to “ prior occupancy and long undisturbed &gt;i? nvvvtpossession ’ 5 of the Shatt-el-Arab ; while no ex press stipulation is contained in the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847) as to the ownership of the river, article 2 merely confirming the Persian right to freedom of navigation. \ If, theiefore, His Majesty’s Government had stiict xegard either to purely local considerations or to the letter of the treaties, they would not hesitate to press for the frontier as locally recognised along its whole length from Hawizeh to the Persian Gulf. But they prefer to look at the negotiations in which they are now engaged as a whole, and are sincerely anxious of arriving at an arrangement which Loth parties can accept ex animo, and which, by removing all points of grievance and friction not only between them selves, but also between the Porte and the Sheikh of Mohammerah, will place the relations of all concerned on a thoroughly satisfactory footing. Provided, therefore, the Turkish Government will accept the frontier status quo as already in dicated from the neighbourhood of Hawizeh to the point v’here the Khaiyin Canal/enter/ the Shatt-el-Arab, then His Majesty’s Government are prepared to use their influence with the Persian Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah to induce them to recognise Turkish sovereignty over the whole waterway of the Shatt-el-Arab, subject to the following conditions (i.) The following islands to be recognised as Vdthin the territorial limits of Persia;— (a.) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh, the lour islands situated between Shatait and Ma’awiyeh, and the two islands off Manquhi. These islands are in fact parts of the island of Abadan, and must be so regarded. (b.) Any islands now in existence, or which may hereafter be formed, and which may be connected ^/either with Abadan Island or with the Persian G^aif at low water. ^ ,q., ; ,4 . (ii.) The arrangements proposed by His Majesty’s Government for maintaining full free dom of navigation on the river -(including the iHahr Khaiyin-and other such channels), and for its conservancy, to be accepted by the Ottoman ^Government. (iii.) The modern port and anchorage of Moham- imerah, which is in the main stream of the Shatt- el-Arab above fits junction wdth the Karun, to be., .recognised as within Persian jurisdiction.(iv.) No interference to take place with existing fishing rights and usages on or from the Persian bank of the Shatt-el-Arab, that phrase being understood to comprise all land on the left bank of the Shatt-el-Arab or on the Persian islands therein which is uncovered at normal low tide. (v.) Turkish jurisdiction not to extend to land on the Persian bank, defined as above, which is only temporarily covered with water in time of flood or from any accidental cause, and Persian jurisdiction not to extend to land which is temporarily or accidentally uncovered below normal low-water mark. (vi.) The Sheikh of Mohammerah to continue in full enjoyment of his existing proprietary rights in lands situated in Turkish territory.'M Q \ % ) (n [818] r\ 1 . HIS Majesty s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied m the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. 2 . Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— 3. For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (hi.) An increase in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. 4. The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5 . The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay oi controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the othei points enumerated in this memorandum. 6 . It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless Ills Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty s Government consequent y feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the o ov\mg conditions as essential to that end:— . „ A (a.) An arrangement, as sht forth in the accompanying draft convention, tor the Draft Con- exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey. / (5.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty s (• nnexDraft Con vention (/Ynnex 3), Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the cmstruetion or working of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions' acceptable to them. (&lt;?.) A convention to he signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of theShatt-eL-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction 'memorandum^1rrtm^-3iyf Tifated hekwi will yhortly-bo oommunicatod to-^ic- &gt;J on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. (/.) An undertaking that permission should, be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. b Memo randum (Annex 4). (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gidf. 7 . His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Kioweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacririce made by His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Railway, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8 . His Majesty’s Government must in the J first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard 1 to k the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey .did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10 . His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire.- For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the! Porte accordingly. All. His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ol El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have, consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itsell so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12 . The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, which incontestably forms part of the status quo. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying memorandum.3 ofk tlie «■ :veD, d let tkt Baliri, SI 1 «!

KoweJi HIS Majesty’s Government consider the frontier on the north to be a line runnino- from Khor-as-Sabiyah so as to pass immediately south of Umm Qasr and Safwam to Jabal Sanan and thence to the Batin. On the south his boundary is considered to run eastwards from Jabal Manifah on the coast to the IN a airiyah hill at the north-western corner of Badaif. On the west the Shaikhdom is bounded between Jabal Sanam and Hafar by the Batin, and south of Hafar the border is the line dividing Sumraan from b) ah an ah as tar south as the point where that line is intersected by the route from Wabrah to Riyadh. ' &gt; . . Districts and Islands .—The Shaikhdom, considered from the physical point of view, falls naturally into two parts, one to the north and the other to the south of a line joining Koweit town and Biqa’i. In the northern block lie the districts or tracts of Batin, Shiqqaq, Batih, Umm-al-Khilan, Yah, Qira-al-Marru, Zaqlah, and Zor. The southern block comprises the three great divisions of Summan, Dibdibah, and^ Umm Janaib ; and the last, which lies along the coast to the south of Koweit Bay, is further subdivided into districts named Shaqq, Qra’ab Adan, Salu, Hazaim, and Sudah. The maritime possessions of Koweit consist of the islands of Bubiyan, Warba, and Failakah, which, with its northern and southern outliers of Mashjan and Auhah, is situated at the mouth of Koweit Bay, and of the islets of Kubbar, Qaru and Umm-ab Maradim.

Board of Trade to Foreign Office.—(Received Jidy 8 .) (Urgent and Very Secret.) Sir, Board of Trade, July 8 , 1912. I AM directed by the Board of Trade to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th July, forwarding the draft of a memorandum respecting negotiations now pending with the Turkish Government, which Sir E. Grey proposes to communicate to the Turkish Ambassador, and to return the draft herewith with certain amendments, indicated in red ink,* which they desire to suggest for Sir E. Grey’s consideration. With regard to the several amendments, I am to point out that the words “ from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem” have been deleted from (hi) of the third paragraph of the draft and from the heading to section (iii), since the effect of the proposal for the special treatment of British cotton manufactures, set out in the amended form of section (iii), will be to limit the rate of customs duty to something less than 15 per cent, in the case of an important item in the Turkish import trade. The addition of certain words at the end of the fifth paragraph of the draft has been suggested with a view to emphasising the close relation between the withdrawal of the British claim to participate in the railway between Bagdad and Bussorah and the other proposals dealt with in the memorandum. In view of the amended form of section (iii) now suggested, the words deleted from (a) of the sixth paragraph appear unnecessary. The Board think it advisable to indicate in (b) of the same paragraph the necessity of the British representatives upon the board of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah being approved by His Majesty’s Government, and they are also disposed to suggest that, should Sir E. Grey see no objection, this opportunity should be taken to direct the attention of the Turkish Government to the desirability of British representation upon the board of the Bagdad Railway proper. Finally, section (iii) of the draft has been amended so as to indicate more precisely the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the proposed increase of the Turkish customs tariff. I am at the same time to forward to you herewith the draft of a railway convention for submission, with Sir E. Grey’s concurrence, to the Ottoman Government, and to state that the proposed schedule of cotton duties will be forwarded to you at the earliest possible date. I am. &amp;c. ' H. LLEWELLYN SMITH. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Draft of Memorandum to be communicated to lurkish Ambassador. 1 . HIS Majesty’s Government have not failed to examine with much care and attention the important proposals which are embodied in the memorandum communicated by the Imperial Ottoman Government on the 15th April last. . , , 2. Throughout their deliberations, His Majesty’s Government have been animated by the conviction that a complete agreement on outstanding questions is eminently to be desired in the larger interests of both countries. They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed, not only m the measure o sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but a so m i s cumu a ive —40 001 ;'jNtl](lraw pliiiiWl Draft Con vention (Annex 2). Draft Con vention (Annex 3). and future efiects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Govern ment therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations 3 . For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may IQ dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase ffotrt ih per cent, te To per cent, ed vaterein in the lurkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Bailway Question. 4 . The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the total exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that no less than 96 per cent, of the steam tonnage entered at the port of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Railway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. 5 . The magnitude of Great Britain’s manifold interests clearly renders it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participation in the southern section of the Bagdad Railway should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties fire difficult to reconcile. In these circum stances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah, if a satisfactory agreement is arrived at on the other 'points enumerated in this memorandum. 6 . It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey, as well as aa aader- talfiag explained i» a separate paper as to the treatment e£ eertaia -British imports. (b.) The admission of two British representatives, approved by His Majesty’s Government, to the board of whatever company may undertake the admmistratiea construction or icorking of the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. In addition, His Majesty’s Government consider it highly desirable in the interests of the smooth working of the arrangements that at least one British director, approved by them, should be admitted to the board of the Bagdad Bailway Company. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. id.) No railway to be continued beyond Bussorah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis of the accompanying draft, for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. This convention must be read in conjunction with a memorandum—which, as stated below, will shortly be communicated to the Porte—on the subject of the frontier of Mohammerah. if.) An undertaking that permission should be given for three British steamers to navigate between Bagdad and Bussorah in addition to the number already allowed. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. 7. His Majesty’s Government note with satisfaction that the Turkish Government'° have®} le ! oanda.| ra secticd it ttfiS ioB,tefe i W renounce their claims to Bahrein on conditions which there should be no difficulty in accepting, but they have learnt with disappointment the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government m regard to El Katr and Koweit; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by Hi Majesty s Government in the matter of British participation in fhe Bagdad Railway, and that they v ill meet that sacrifice by a corresponding modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. 8 . His Majesty s Government must in the first instance protest against the con tention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assurance given, and repeatedly given, to Hey Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect’ that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtaining the supremacy oyer Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian Gulf. 9. The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. 10 . His Majesty’s Government maintain that prior to Midhat Pasha’s expedition there were on the Arabian coast no symbols of Turkish authority, no Turkish jurisdiction or occupation, effective or ineffective. And while they are now prepared to recognise Annex 4 . Turkish sovereignty between the southernmost limits of Koweit (as hereinafter defined) and Ojeir, they are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the statement that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of. or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire. For themselves, relying no less on the obvious facts than on the Turkish assurances mentioned above, they have never so regarded it, and they have repeatedly informed the Sublime Porte accordingly. 11 . His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itself so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition. 12 . The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continuance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, as defined in their memorandum of the 29th July, 1911, which incontestably forms part of the status quo. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully prepared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, ’yj- em0 _ to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition ran d um of the limits of Koweit m accordance with the indications contained in the accompanying (Annex 4). memorandum. 13. His Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided responsibility for maritime police measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circumstances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. 14. Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative ; and it was this attitude which led to the declaration made by t le Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that Bis Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to British interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal. His Majesty’s Government must therefore ask the Turkish Government to recognise in the Persian Gulf the right of Great Britain (a.) To control surveying, ig mg, buoying, and pilotage; (b.) To police its waters; and (c.) To conduct all quarantine 15. In submitting these final proposals for the acceptance of the Turkish Govern- L2546 i—7] b w , mWMemo randum (Annex 5). ■ ment, His Majesty’s Government are not seeking territorial aggrandisement, nor are they embarking upon any new developments of policy. Their desire is simpb^to secure the recognition and to ensure the continuance of an order of things whicr;, in fact, grew up under their auspices and before the appearance of Turkish authority in the Persian Gulf, and which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the maintenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. 16. They feel persuaded that the Ottoman Government will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. 17. As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. Now however that it has been raised, by circumstances beyond their control, they feel that no settlement in the Persian Gulf could be complete which did not provide for this question, and they regard a satisfactory adjustment of' it as an essential part of the present negotiations. They have the honour to submit a separate memorandum on the subject lor the consideration of the Ottoman Government. (iii.) An increase from H pep eeet. te T5 pee eeat. customs duties. V dl O’T g hi in the Turkish 18. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the isepease ef the Turkish eusteras ha a period ef seven years from tApril -sd-np aed rkey will also agree re rhe eentinned levy ef ike existing $ per eeni. easterns inerease fer a similar period, maintenance for a period of seven years, counting from six months after the date of such agreement, of the increase in the general rate of customs duty leviable on British goods on importation into the Ottoman Empire from 8 per cent, to 11 per cent, ad valorem which was agreed to in 1907, and also to the further increase of this general rate of customs duty from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem for the same period.

Foreign Office, July 9, ]9I2. WN nave the honour to submit the accompanying amended draft of an Ancdo- Turkish convention for the future conservancy of the Shatt-el-Arab. We have, besides various other points, taken into careful consideration the several comments made by the British Besident in the Persian Gulf and hy the Government of India upon the original draft; but, m revising the convention, we have introduced amendments only in so far as they are consistent with the recognition of Turkish rights over the whole waterway. We understand that it is a primary object of His Majesty’s Government and of the Turkish Government to exclude other Powers from representation on the com mission, and that the objection of His Majesty’s Government to such representation is partly based upon the belief that it might be pleaded by the Powers who enjoyed it as a ground, for intervention on their part in the control of police, and other matters of administration, in the Persian Gulf. The principal difficulty which presents itself undoubtedly lies in the possibility that foreign Powers, if not represented, may decline to allow dues, which will be necessary to meet the expenses of the commission, to be levied on their shipping. This difficulty is inevitable in the case of a country which is subject to the capitulations, and so long as Turkey desires to preserve the commission as a purely Turkish institution there must be some risk that foreign ships may escape payment of the dues. Nevertheless, we think an effort should be made to levy dues, and to provide by this means a revenue for the commission, and to do this in such manner as shall give least ground for foreign objection. The difficulty arises from the absence of any method by which payment of the dues by ships can be enforced by judicial procedure. We do not think that Turkey’s right to improve the navigation of her internal waterways or to charge reasonable dues on shipping in return can be doubted, but so long as the payment of such dues could only be enforced by proceedings in the consular court of the Power whose flag the ship flies there is no certainty that such proceedings would be effective. The risk can, in our opinion, be considerably reduced by the plan of levying one consolidated due to cover all heads of service rendered—lighting, buoying, dredging, pilotage, wharves, &amp;c., because ships would in almost all cases require the services of a pilot, and it would be possible to insist on payment of the consolidated due before the pilotage service was rendered. We cannot report that in our opinion this would enable dues to be levied in every case, because it is conceivable that a ship might refuse to employ a pilot in the service of the commission or give any other opportunity for obtaining the payment of the due in advance. If the ships were left alone, it is not likely that they would take this course, because it would not be worth their while. It is possible, however, that some foreign Power might encourage a hostile attitude on the part of its shipping for the purpose of forcing the Turkish Government to admit it to representation on the commission to the same extent as Great Britain. We do not think that this risk is very serious, and we recommend that it should be faced. AVe think it is improbable that any Power would consider that sufficient political advantage was to be obtained from adopting this course. It would certainly irritate the Porte, and it could not be carried out without injuring the commerce of its subjects and its shipping. _ . . , The long period during which Great Britain has provided and maintaine buoys, &amp;c., at the mouth of the Shatt-el-Arab and the many services which she lias 2546 i—2~ r *&gt; \ 19JUL1912 J ^ Bmmmmsm ****n^g0rmmmgsaB! 2 rendered to the cause of navigation in. that district provide the Porte with a perfectly good answer to any claim to equal participation which other Powers may put forward, because Turkey can say, and say with truth, that owing to the multifarious services rendered by Great Britain, she (Turkey) had cea,sed to be master on her own river, and, that the only way in which to secure the cessation of the existing state^ of things am the transfer of these services to the commission was by appointing a British subject as a member of the commission. , , . . J ,, r . r The only other policy would be for no dues to be levied at all, and tor the entire expenses of the commission to be borne either by the Porte alone or by the Porte and Great Britain jointly. Either proposal would, in our opinion, be open to objection, nor would either be likely to meet with favour from the Ottoman Government. Although we are reluctant to recommend a departure from established British policy in respect of financial aid to works in foreign territory, we yet venture to think that, if it should appear that the imposition of dues is impracticable, the importance of maintaining the Shatt-el-Arab and its approaches in good navigable condition is so great that, it the Porte could be induced to accept an arrangement under which the expenses of the commission would be borne by the two Powers jointly, the policy of an annual giant for this purpose from the British and Indian Exchequers merits the careful consideration of the Cabinet. 1 ..... . „ . On one point we think it is desirable that matters should be left open tor an understanding with Germany. Under the original Bagdad Railway concession, the railway company have the right to construct wharves, &amp;c., at Bussorah. It may eventually turn out to be better for the commission not to attempt to construct wharves at that port, so as to leave the field clear for the new railway company to be formed for the Bagdad-Gulf section. It would be an advantage to the commission financially, as it will have plenty of work elsewhere for call the funds at its disposal, and it might form the basis of an understanding under which Germany would not oppose the work of the commission. Dealing now with the changes made in the original draft, in the order of the several articles, we have the honour to submit the following observations : Article I.—The word “remain” has been substituted for “be” to emphasise the claim that the river is open already. Article 5 —The words “and the surveyor” have been added to meet the wish expressed by the Admiralty that a British naval officer should be associated with the commission. Article 6 (a).—The words “and as the funds at its disposal will allow’’ have been struck out, as it is feared that they might be made a pretext for the commission to evade carrying out necessary works. Article 6 (d).—Difficulties may occur as to the control of pilotage by the com mission, but in practice we do not think they should be insurmountable. Article 6 (e ).—We consider it advisable to lay down precisely the lights and buoys which are handed over to the commission, and that a schedule should be prepared. Article 6 (/).— We considered whether the insertion of the word “Turkish” before “banks” would be expedient; but the convention can only apply to places under Turkish jurisdiction, and the limitation therefore seems unnecessary. We have used “ banks” in the plural because on the higher reaches of the river both banks are Turkish. Articles 8 , 9 , 10 are a re-arrangement and expansion of the original articles 8 and 9 , the changes having been made especially with a view to strengthening the provisions against discrimination. Article 11.—We consider it inadvisable that the commission should have the option of borrowing from any Power other than Great Britain or Turkey, since foreign Powers might make the advance of capital a pretext for claiming representation on the commission. Article 15.—We do not consider it imperative to insist upon the umpire being nominated by the British Institute of Civil Engineers, and we suggest that we might, if advisable, concede this point in the course of negotiation. Article 18.—Understanding that the frontier between turkey and Mohammera is to be laid down in some other document, we have inserted a saving clause will preclude the commission from exercising any jurisdiction on the Persian ban , or in Persian waters, without the consent of Persia or the Sheikh of Mohammerah. Article 19.—This is taken, with a few slight modifications, from the moce commercial treaty. We have suggested twenty-me years as the period ot the agreemen on the ground that it may be advantageous that the question of its renewal shou coincide with that of a possible renewal of the customs increase, which we understanrfsefen j years. G ° Vernmeilt intend to ^ to i» the first instance for a period ^ We lmve omitted the original article 18, which was as follows “The Imperial Ottoman Government will offer no objection to the continuance on the ground that it^ may be awkward to raise discussion respecting a custom which has been acquiesced m, if not exp icitly recognised, for a great many years, and which His Majesty s Government could in no case abandon. ^ .X &gt; r fGel th u t th f • \ 18 S ° me ri f k that Tnrke y will claim that the present anchorage of Mohammerah, which is on the Shatt-el-Arab, is within the limits of Turkish sovereignty though outside the Turkish frontier as locally observed. It would be desirable, therefore, that the agreement in which the Mohammerah frontier is laid down should specifically recognise that the Mohamrnerah anchorage is within the Persian sphere. We have not inserted a clause to the effect that the British member of the commission should represent the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s interests, since it appears more suitable^ to provide for this in some covering document at the time when the draft Convention is transmitted to the Turkish representatives. We have, &amp;c. EDMOND J. W. SLADE A. HIRTZEL. GEO. J. STANLEY. A. G. DALLAS. C. J. B. HURST. PERCY ASHLEY. ALWYN PARKER. aielffc ,1 arfi^ m ■:&gt; 3§t Enclosure in No. 1 .

Foreign Secret. 710. Your telegram of 3rd July. Firstly, Sheikh of Mohammerah claims ou behalf of Persian Government that following islands are Persian territory, viz.(1) Muhalleh and its adjunct Bahriyeh ; (2) the four islands between Shatait and Maawiyeh, referred to in sub-enclosure to my Despatch dated 4th May, No. 3, Political, to the Foreign Office ; (3) two islands off Manquhi, variously named, joined to mainland at low water. ^ All above are actually in possession of Persian Government, and it is claimed that they have never been in the hands of Turks at any time. Contention of Sheikh of Mohammerah in regard to them is that all, and particularly Muhalleh, are part and parcel of island of A1 Khidhar, and most be regarded as forming part of left bank of the Shat, vide page 122 of Turko-Persian Boundary Papers, part III. Secondly, Sheikh of Mohammerah claims on behalf of Persian Government that all islands which may subsequently form, and all accretions to existing islands as above stated, on Persian side of mid-channel line, i.e., line taken by steamers, shall be ipso facto recognised as Persian territory in accordance with ancient custom and for reasons given in sub-enclosure to my Despatch above mentioned. For map showing above islands, please see that quoted in sub-enclosure to my Despatch above mentioned.r ^ From Political Resident, Persian Gulf, 4£/i July 1912. W ilson has just returned to Naseri and his survey will be posted next week and reach London 27th July. Meanwhile 1 have taken followino- resume from him by telephone. Naseri was fixed astronomically and Hawizeh both astronomically and by triangulation. Position of Naseri is found to be several miles south of position hitherto assigned to it in Survey of India Maps. Position of Hawizeh is found to coincide with position indicated in identic map of 1851 Southampton 1873. Frontier north-west of Hawizeh and north of Shuaib was laid down by triangulation from Hawizeh. Western limits of Hawizeh district as observed in practice for their own convenience by the Benitruf Arabs under Hawizeh is the now dry branch of the river Douveyridge called Ghor-ed-Houvil in identic map at point where its course runs north and south, but the frontier claimed by Persia and locally observed on their side by Turks is the channel six miles further west called Ghor-el-Monseycine. The intervening space is uninhabitable owing to absence of drinkable water. Whichever of the two alternative points be adopted the frontier from thence southwards runs across the Ghor-el-Azem and eventually cuts the main channel of the marsh just west of Shuaib as shewn in my sketch map. WLlson states that above From Shuaib southwards frontier runs as shown in my sketch. Wilson had with him my native surveyor and latter’s original survey and after applying further tests by the light of present observations he is of opinion relation to one another and to Hawizeh town are correct as shown in my sketch as submitted to Government.

Mohammerah, 5th May. Your telegram No. 185 of 12 tli April. rirst ~A$ regards technical interpretation of text of articles' Original ^rhnlf 1 d ° eS n0t S P® Clfically assi S n t0 Turk ey the sovereignty over the ole of the river, and it seems clear from the observations of the Turkish Ambassador, quoted m paragraph 5 of my letter No. 446 of 9th March, that they are by no means sure of their ground in claiming it. Nor have Basrah authorities attempted locally to exercise jurisdiction over it; on the contrary rvru 7 and V 7 e iave re P eatedl y recognized right not obligation of Sheikh of Mohammerah to participate m measures for the suppression of piracy in river, mde instances quoted in chapter 7 of Wilson’s yrecis. Having regard therefore to the fact that treaty makes no definite pronouncement on the point, it is submitted that the Turks cannot legitimately read into the wording of Article 2 thereof a meaning or inference which ^ constitutes a ^ position apparently incompatible with recognized principles of international law in regard to intern(ation)al (?) rivers ; nor would it appear practically possible under that law to assign to one country control over whole waters of joint river without also assigning to it jurisdiction over both banks. Such a position would be specially unworkable in case of tidal river like Shat-el-Arab, where lands lying between high and low watermark are in many places extensive and carry with them valuable fishing rights. Again, effect of giving whole of river to Turkey would be to give them control of Oil Company’s wharf and anchor age at Abadan and the present-day anchorage off Mohammerah, which is in the main stream. Second. If however by appeal to Hague Tribunal or other arbitral decision Turks are accorded control of whole of river, suggested arrangement of a purely Ottoman Board with British member seems a desirable one. Third, as explained in my letter above, quoted, I find it difficult to understand how we can go back on our past attitude vis-a-vis Sheikh and Persian Government on any grounds short of issue of some formal arbitral decision which can be imposed on Persian Government. As regards Sheikh himself it must be remembered that he is official representative of the Persian Government as well as the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and has with him a representative of Persian Foreign Office. For us to make a proposal to Sheikh on the lines suggested would surely be to ask him to depart from that technical loyalty to the Central Government, on the observance of which our assurances to him have hitherto depended. I grant that he might be ready to accept our proposal in spite of Persian Government, in return for a considerable extension of our assurances in the direction of British protection. But however welcome to him and desirable for us such a development might be, we need to realise that if we acted fairly and unequivocally up to extended assurances so given, we should be imposing upon ourselves greatly increased responsibility in practice both in regard to Sheikh and his territories. This is a large question, which can be considered deliberately as a factor of our general policy and intentions in regard to Gulf and South Persia. In view of unavoidable delay which has occurred in the despatch of this reply owing to my absence from communications, I have repeated it to India Office.Lieutenant-Colonel Sir P.

Some of the points have already been dealt with on the telegraphic correspondence.—A. P. ] Sip ’ t\t n .k • , 21, 1912. IN submitting the accompanying notes relating to points of detail in Mr Alwvn Parker s memorandum of April 1912 on the subject of “ the frontier between Moham- merah and Turkey, I have the honour to offer the following observations for the consideration of the Government of India, on the bearing of the memorandum as a whole and the line of policy advocated therein. dhe findings arrived at in the memorandum may be summarised as follows : (a.) As regards the riparian tract west of Mohammerah, it is agreed that there is a case for supporting a Persian claim for the formal recognition and confirmation of the status quo as represented by the boundary locally observed. (A) As regards the distiict of Hawizeh, it is suggested that there are no grounds for any modification of the arbitrary line inserted in the mediating commissioners’ rough diagram as indicating the boundary recommended for adoption in respect of that locality. My suggestion in my memorandum under discussion was overruled (see tele- gram No. 335 of the llth April, 1912, to St, Petersburg). I may add that I am convinced by Sir P. Cox’s facts and arguments on this point that my suggestion was inexpedient. — A. P. (c.) As regards the waters of the Shatt-el-Arab, it is held that a claim on the part of Persia to the mid-channel boundary is untenable. (d.) Apart from the above main issues under immediate consideration, Mr. Parker expresses the apprehension that the question of the status of the Sheikh of Mohammerah ia the matter of jurisdiction over those of his tribesmen who tenant lands in admittedly Turkish limits must come up incidentally for discussion in the course of the frontier negotiations now in progress at Constantinople. He merely touches on this problem lor the purpose of indicating the probability of the contingency arising. My words were that it “ is not unlikely to be discussed.” I am preparing a separate paper on this question. — A. P. (e.) Lastly, he suggests, at the conclusion of his memorandum, that the Sheikh of Mohammerah seems to be pursuing; a policy of territorial encroachment by means [2506 m — 1 ] ^ B hmmam 2 of the purchase of real property in Turkish limits, and expresses the view that it is undesirable that we should give him any encouragement in this course. As I have already pointed out, my misapprehension, if it is one, rests on certain passages, especially on pp- 58 and 59, of Lieutenant Wilson s precis Arabistan .— A. P. 3 . Speaking briefly, the notes now submitted may be said to bear on the several points above cited to the following extent : As regards (a), it is shown— ( 1 .) That there has been no encroachment by Persia at this part of the frontier for the last sixty years at least, and that the boundary which has throughout this period been locally observed by both parties is apparently identical ^ with that claimed by Persia in 1850,* which, it will be remembered, was only modified in the recommendations of the mediating commissioners in order to secure to Turkey safe navigation up to Bussorah ; and ( 2 .) That the experience of the same sixty years has demonstrated that the danger then apprehended to Bussorah from the occupancy of these lands by Persia is really non-existent, and is in any case provided against by the undertaking entered into by the latter to erect no fortifications. This, the non-existence of the danger, as demonstrated by experience, is precisely what I have pointed out on p. 38 of my memorandum. — A. P. As regards (b), it is submitted that the rough diagram enclosed in Colonel Williams’ despatch of the 4 th February, 1850,t has already been shown to be altogether sketchy and inaccurate and not drawn according to scale; that the boundary-line inserted in it was apparently drawn arbitrarily and without any visit having been made to the locality, and without knowledge of the local geographical or political conditions existing; that the Hawizeh district has, in fact, been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries; that its boundaries are well recognised, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in the diagram is not feasible in practice. As regards (c), further arguments, based on both legal and practical considerations, have been adduced in support of the attitude adopted by the India Office in their letter to the Foreign Office dated the 3rd June, 191 l.J See my minute on p. 4, under 8 .— A. P. Items (d) and (e) : Discussion of these points hardly comes within the scope of the present letter ; I may therefore confine myself to a reference to the text of my notes themselves, merely reiterating in regard to (e) that Mr. Parker’s observations seem to be based on a misunderstanding of the sheikh’s proceedings. My misunderstanding arose from Lieutenant Wilsons precis (vide supra). A. P. 4 . As to the line of policy which His Majesty’s Government can best adopt under the circumstances, Mr. Parker’s recommendations are :— ( 1 .) As regards (a), that we should confer wdth the Bussian Government and get them to agree to our jointly advising the Persian Government to induce the Turks to reveal the extent of their claims in respect of the neighbourhood of Mohammerah, and then to press their claim for the recognition of the boundary (at Di’aiji) as locally recognised and observed, and that we ourselves should simultaneously intimate to the Porte in a friendly way the great importance which we attach to the maintenance of the status quo, and ask them to take our wishes into favourable consideration. ( 2 .! That as regards (b), we should seek no departure from the arbitrary line drawn by the mediating commissioners. ' v 3.) That as regards (c), we should support the claim of the Turks to the whole channel. 5 . It remains for me, as directed, to express my personal views with reference to those conclusions and recommendations. While 1 fully appreciate the soundness and advantage of the course adopted by Mr, Parker, in drawing up his memorandum and framing his recommendations from the purely legal standpoint, from which the subject would probably be treated in the main * Vide p. 37 of memorandum. t Opposite p. 25 of memorandum. j P. 31 of Foreign Office memorandum.3 very ^atlyto ouH^Sefte toTvert 1 ^ iS S 61161 ? 1 ^ a 8 reed «' a t it is it is hoped that these notes read in nnr 1 ' t0 S at 7v ? )Ur ^ ^ diplomatic action ; and suffice to demonstrate that the Persian 1 ^ •^ r ’ ^ &gt;ar j cer s memorandum, will % Dawairij southwards are well-tomrffirf « n ^ tlons m regard to the boundary from undertake that action with confidence.’ ^ W1 enab e Hls Ma j e sty’s Government to ivhich a Tmffiren of the 23rd February, 1912, in % &gt;’■ ?“ '»s -4= ttr&amp;zaz trst&amp;izsz S^XTKSSSKS.t ' 4 -*•&gt; Eussian^ovemment'with ) 'a 1 IT fi, ' St -■ fe V'; th the tcfthe^^rte* Jan t ^ 1 sot^inWffin to the Porte of the nature of our engagements with the Sheikh of Mohammerah has alnadybeendehberately considered by His Majesty’s Government in connection with the Zam incident of 1910, and approved of in principle. The local authorities at Bussorah have even been informed m the most explicit manner by His Maiestv’s consul at Bussorah that the Sheikh of Mohammerah is under British protection f This announcement was widely promulgated in Turkish and Arabic papers at the time and must be common knowledge to the Porte. Surely, in view of these considerations, we are now m a position to speak freely to the latter, explaining that we have been in the best possible position for being aware of and taking note of the nature of the status quo as locally observed for the past sixty years or more ; that taking for granted, as we were warranted m doing, the permanence of that status quo, we have entered into engage ments with the Sheikh of Mohammerah which involve its maintenance, and that' both our interests and our good name preclude us from going back on these pledoes or permitting any alteration of the sheikh’s position on the Shatt-el-Arab and in Arabistan. As regards ( 6 ). It is submitted that it has already been pointed out in the past correspondence that the rough and small-scale diagramJ enclosed in Colonel Williams’ despatch of the 4th February, 1850, was not a document on which any reliance could be placed ; that the boundary line shown in it must have been arbitrarily drawn; that as far as Hawizeh is concerned, it is clearly only very approximate and indeterminate, and must have been so inserted in the absence of any local knowledge or visit to the locality ; that the Hawizeh district has been a recognised district of Persia for three centuries, that there is no record of its having been claimed by Turkey, and that the adoption of the arbitrary line shown in Colonel Williams’ diagram is not feasible in practice. Vide supra under 2 (b).—A. P. 7. Should it be necessary for Persia to make some concession to Turkey as a set-off against the abandonment of the latter’s claim in the Arabistan region, I would recall to mind that the Turks seem in 1891§ to have contemplated such abandonment in return for the cession of certain territory between Zohab and Khanikin, and it might be possible to come to some such arrangement now. The very important British oil con cession at Kasr-i-Shirin would probably be affected by such a cession of territory, but if the Turks would consent to guarantee the continuance of this, the change of nation ality might not improbably operate to the benefit of the company. Zohab is largely within the Russia?!, sphere : moreover, Persia seems now to attach almost greater importance to Zohab than to Mohammerah. — A. P. Locally, the only concession which it would appear that we can advisedly recom mend to the Persian Government to agree to, in order by friendly compromise to eliminate the boundary betweeh Dawairij and the Shatt-el-Arab from the issues referable to The Hague, is that the line should be drawn from the channel west of the village of Shu’aib direct to Kishk-i-Bussorah, and thence to the locally recognised * P. 19 of memorandum. t P-61 of Wilson’s precis. X Opposite p. 25 of memorandum. § See Annex (II) to this letter.boundary on the Shatt-el-Di’aiji. A considerable strip of _ territory would thus be relinquished to Turkey, especially if we consider Persia s original claim—the course of the marsh channel from west of Hawizeh until it reaches the Shatt-et-Arab. Persia can afford to do this, for, although the area involved is an extensive one, with irrigable potentialities which it is hard to estimate, it is nevertheless probable that the nomad occupation and cultivation by Shi eh Arab tribes under Persia would remain unaffected, and that Turkish subjects and Turkish influence would continue to be as non-existent and unknown east of the natural boundary as they are under existing conditions. 8 . As regards (c), I can only say that nothing in Mr. Parker’s memorandum enables me to alter the view expressed in my telegram dated Mohammerah, the 5 th May. I would refer to the following passage, based on the legal opinion of Sir E. Davidson, Mr. Hurst, and Mr. Malkin, and quoted from the Foreign Office letter of the 2&gt;lst May, 1912 (No. 22934) to the India Office :— “ Sir E. Grey is advised that under normal conditions there is no doubt a presumption that each riparian owner owns on his side of the river usque ad medium Alum aquae, but that, in the present case, that presumption has by implication undoubtedly been swept away by the terms of the Treaty of Erzeroum (1847), the effect of which teas to give Turkey the whole waterway.” / would also refer to the view of Admiral Slade, Sir A. Hirtzel, and. Mr. Hurst (see joint letter of the 15th May, 1912, to Sir E. Grey (No. 20863)).— A. P. 9. In conclusion, I would urge that having regard to the fact that our commercial stake and interests in Southern Persia, present and potential, now mainly centre in Arabistan, and are bound up with the maintenance of the Sheikh of Mohammerah’s position and the strengthening of our special relations with him, we have everything to lose by a course of action (the failure to safeguard the status quo which has been regarded and treated by the present generation as the established order of things),, which will tend greatly to discredit the value of our engagements and support, and create in the minds of the Arab public in the Gulf and the native rulers in treaty with us a feeling of apprehension and uncertainty which we can by no means, especially at this juncture, afford to disregard. Our attitude will, in fact, be regarded as a crucial test of our sincerity and ability to make good our engagements, and I would add the personal opinion that the increased confidence and frank reliance in us, which the Sheikh of Koweit has shown within the last two years, has been due less to anything that we have done for him than to the practical demonstration in the case of Mohammerah of the substantial and moral value of our steadfast friendship and support : I should view with very great concern any action calculated to weaken those sentiments. There is a consensus of opinion as to the importance of obtaining the most favourable settlement possible for the sheikh, due regard being had at the same time to our general relations with Turkey, to legal and treaty considerations, and to the expediency of not arousing misgivings as to the justice of our attitude in Turkey inhere the Sheikhs of Mohammerah and Koweit, our proteges, have largely invested in real estate, and might suffer from resentment entertained against His Majesty’s Government. Whether our attitude can be such as to insist—in the face of possible Turkish opposition—-upon the continued exercise of jurisdiction by the Sheikh of Mohammerah over his tribesmen resident in admittedly Turkish territory (e.g., on the right bank of the Shatt-el-Arab) is I think a moot point ; our action in regard to the Zain incident of 1910 was, as I understand it, inspired by the outrage committed against the sheikh’s relatives rather than by a determination to resist acts of lawf ul sovereignty and administration by the Turkish authorities on Turkish soil. Sir G. Barclay, in his letter of the 8 th May, 1912, states that he understood that our assurances to the sheikh, with regard to his jurisdiction, were confined to Persian territory. — A.

Page 10 : The Haffar Canal. (See also reference to it by Layard at pp. 52 and 53 .) Ihe exposition^ here given of the geographical position of Mohammerah and the roug si ®tuh map given in illustration are both based upon the assumption that the sec ion o the waterway on which Mohammerah stands is an artificial cut, and that the latter is the “ Haffar ” properly so called. I submit that this assumption is erroneous. The testimony of ancient maps and ocuments which, owing to my absence from books and records, I am unable to quote T 18 that the position was originally as shown in the accompanying very rough F Kk That is to say, that the Karun flowed via Marid and the old settlement of ubban to the Khor Musa, whilst the Shatt-el-Arab bifurcated at the present site of ohammerah and divided its waters from thence to the sea between its present channel and the Bahmanshir branch. The term “HafFar” is applied locally invariably to the reach of the Karun above ohammerah between Marid and the head of the Bahmanshir, and in no case to the waterway ()n which Mohammerah stands, which, on the contrary, is often called ahmanshir (see “ Gazetteer,” p. 598, and Lieutenant Wilson’s 1 m. = I inch maps tt 5 « obamme rah and the Shatt-el-Arab for further explanations as to the position of the Haffar reach). 2506 m — 1] CThere is a well-known tradition current locally that the bed of the Karun from Marid, where the old Karun diverges, to the head of the Bahmanshir, was once an artificial cut for small boats, and so narrow, to quote the words of the tradition, “ that one woman could hand to another a basket of dates across the water. Gradually, however, the Karun tended to adopt the canal for its surplus waters, as the Kubban Channel became silted up ; dams were built to counteract this tendency, but in vain, and finally the river abandoned the Marid-Kubban bed and flowed south wards to the Bahmanshir. There is strong inductive evidence of the correctness of the above tradition deducible from the°levels of the old and new stream beds and other considerations, which have received the endorsement of Sir . AVillcocks, who has made a close study of the question. i t i It may further be asked, when the Karun entered the sea via Kubban, what was the position and raison d’etre of the Bahmanshir, if it was not at that time a mouth of the combined waters of the Euphrates and ligris? Other pertinent arguments may be adduced, such as the great size and depth of the Haffar, and the nature of the delta of the Bahmanshir, but the subject is not one which affects the frontier directly, and is only touched on here to show that the arguments of the responsible officers of that period were not always founded on a basis of unassailable fact. Note 3. Page 12 : The Independence of the Kaab and their original Nationality. Whether the Kaab (or Chaab) emigrated from Najd (as stated by Mr. Lorimer in his “ Gazetteer” at p. 961) or from the Arabian coast (as stated by Lieutenant Wilson on the authority of an old native historical record, vide p. 8 of his precis), their stay at Wasit, on the Shatt-el-Hai in Turkish territory, was only a short one, and Najd and the Arabian coast being alike independent at the time, their brief sojourn in Turkish territory does not make them a Turkish tribe. Turkish dominion over Mesopotamia was then very shadowy except at Bussorah and Bagdad, and the statement of Mr. Townley in his memorandum of 1891, on the authority of information obtained in Tehran from the Turkish Embassy, that the Ka ah were recognised as independent by the treaty of 1639, coming as it does from a Turkish source, is primd facie probable. There is, I think, no dovht that the Chaab were not recognised as independent by the Treaty of 1639 : all the versions we possess, including the Turkish versions and that obtained from Vienna and regarded as the most reliable, omit all reference to the Chaab, and the ipse dixit of the Turkish Embassy at Tehran, without any documentary proof, is, I submit, not of any decisive weight in view of the consistent evidence to the contrary afforded by all the versions of the treaty extant. Moreover, it is hardly conceivable that, if the Chaab were recognised as independent bn the Treaty of 1639, the fact should not have transpired between 1842 and 1850.—A. P. Major Rawlinson’s conclusions at the top of p. 14 may, so far as they relate to the independence of the Ka’ab, be accepted as correct, with the exception of the assertion that they were Turkish subjects in 1639. It is impossible to reconcile this general statement with the record (printed at p. 8 of Wilson’s precis), to the effect that about 1620 on the accession of Shah ’Abbas, Imam Kuli Khan, Governor of Farsistan, headed on expedition against the Ka’ab, and compelled them to pay revenue to the Shah of Persia. This statement indicates that some years before the treaty of 1639 the Ka’ab were admittedly Persian subjects, and one of the principal Turkish assertions thus falls to the ground. In any case it may be asked, What are the rights “ of which Turkey never made any formal renunciation ? ” The payment by the tribe of rents to Bussorah may, with due reserve, be admitted as evidence of the nationality of the lands concerned, but not of the subjectivity of the tribes paying it, as it has been constantly admitted that Persian tribes might occupy lands belonging to Turkey without surrendering their nationality, though without, of course, giving Persia a valid claim on that ground alone to the ownership of the lands occupied. (See second query, p. 24.) I am not aware where this is u constantly admitted f at any rate to the extent of allowing the exercise of ’jurisdiction by a foreign Sheikh on Turkish territory. 1 would also refer to my minute under Note 7 on p. 10.— A.

That the claim made on behalf of Persia in 1850 of ancient occupation has been vastly strengthened by over sixty years of continued undisputed possession by Persia, and recognition of Persian sovereignty by local representatives of the Turkish Govern ment in many ways and on many different occasions. 4. lhat the boundary as now observed has for many years been commonly and officially recognised as such by all concerned, both Arabs, Persiaus, and Turks. Cairns and other marks have been put up in the vicinity of the boundary line by common consent. (See (a) “Gazetteer,” p. 1257 ; (b) paragraph 4 , p. 51, Wilsons precis; (c) paragraph 4, p. 52, idem,; (d) paragraph 5, Lieutenant Wilson’s letter of the nth May, 1912, forwarded to Foreign Office and India under Resident’s letter of the 6th May.) -\t Di’aiji, just beyond the boundary, there exists a regular Turkish customs post (see “ Gazetteer,” p. 110), the position of which implies the most explicit recognition by the Porte of the locally recognised boundary. In view of fifty years’ continuous recognition of the present boundary by their local officials, it is surely impossible for the Turkish Government to claim some other line and refuse to be bound by the acts and omissions of its own agents. Qui facit per alium facit per se. 5. That the explanatory note in no way bears on these particular lands ; Mr. Wellesley (at p. 24) does not say that, the lands referred to in the second explanatory note are immediately above Mohammerah, and it may be reasonably presumed that the Porte was contemplating, with not unnatural anxiety, the lands above Di’aiji and almost opposite Bussorah, which were then, as now, mostly in the hands of the Ka’ab (see Lorimer’s “Gazetteer,” pp. 108 to 111 , which shows the Muhaisin to be in practically in continuous occupation, as freeholders or leaseholders of Turkish territory, of the whole left bank of the river above Di’aiji to within 6 miles of Bussorah).SMHB9BBB8B 6 6 . That Colonel Shiel, an impartial observer, considered (p. 28) the Persian claim, to Tamar in the main well founded, but pressed on the Persian Government the acceptance of the decision of the mediating commissioners on other grounds—those of expediency rather than of strict justice—the principle being that if the commission hatj.*, fixed the boundary higher up the river they would have placed the port of Bussorafl* at the mercy of the Ka’ab. After reading every despatch which was written at this period on the frontier question, I have reached the conclusion that Colonel Shell, Her Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, held a view if anything rather favourable to Persia, while Sir S. Canning held a view more favourable to Turkey. On the whole, it would seem that Major Rawlinson, who made a minute study of local conditions and had access to the registry at Bussorah, is likely to have formed the more accurate and precise conclusions. Those conclusions, which deal specifically with each small district, are set forth in detail on pp. 16 and 23 of his memorandum of 1844, and reproduced in my memorandum of the 3rd April, 1912. I submit that they show, with some degree of authority, that the Persian claim to sovereignty over the whole country between the locally observed boundary at Diaji and the mediating commis sioners’ line was not, in 1844, of uniform validity. However, I ventured in my memorandum to express the view that His Majesty's Government can nevertheless now support Persia in claiming the whole country up to Diaji, and this view has been approved (see telegram No. 33b of the l]th April, 1912, to St. Petersburgh), and I quite agree that we should, in the impending negotiations, take full advantage of Colonel Sheil’s opinion. — A. P. Now such a consummation is avoided altogether by the locally observed boundary,, which leaves the main channel just above Failiyeh, and runs about 1 mile distant from, but parallel to, it near Di’aiji, thus giving ample protection to Bussorah against the construction of forts or other action which might operate to the detriment of that port. As a matter of fact, the commissioners were very wide of the mark when they sought to protect Bussorah against the Ka’ab by the simple expedient of an artificial boundary line. If the Ka’ab wished to attack the commerce of Bussorah, they could do it at any time by walking across the boundary. The Arab tribes of Atub, Idan, and Muntafik, who live mainly on the Turkish side, are far more dangerous than the Ka’ab to the Turks, and were they to be called upon to do so would willingly unite with the latter in attacking the Turks, who, as in 1766, so now, “are in no capacity to stop them.” Non-; 5. Page 26 : Ownership of Islands in the Shatt-el-Arab. Colonel Williams, in his despatch of the 4th February, 1850 (p. 26), states that “ we have carefully abstained from admitting Persian claims to the islands in the Shatt-el-Arab, all of which lie to the west of Mohammerah and El Khizr I.” This indicates that in his time there were no islands in the main stream below Mohammerah, and that all have formed since that period, though this is not entirely borne out by Colonel Chesney’s charts of 1836, which show Muhilleh Island as existing on the Turkish (instead of, as now, on the Persian) side of the main stream. / do not think Colonel \\ illi am s' language is intended to indicate this. There was much correspondence in 1850-51 about Muhilleh island, and an island is shown moreover on Colonel Williams' diagram. — A. P. Islands in the Shatt-el-Arab are formed in two ways :— 1 . The river cuts into the mainland and isolates a patch of land, which becomes an island, generally separated by only a short distance from the parent mainland. 2 . The river tends to accentuate its bends by erosion, and below such a bend deposits a mud bank, which is walled, and gradually becomes an island. Islands so formed tend to grow gradually from their lower or down-stream end, and to assume a cigar-like shape, masking the parent main bank by several hundred yards. If, therefore, ownership of all islands be accorded to the Turks, they will be placed in virtual possession of both banks for many miles.

It is important, I agree, to provide against this. — A. P. Note 6. Page 42 . Legal Objections to the Mid-Channel Line. Whde admitting the force of the arguments adduced in Mr. Parker’s memorandum on which ihe Hague Court might rely in deciding in favour of the Turkish case I would submit that the arguments which can be derived from the international law on the subject must also carry weight. Thus, Wheaton (p. 291 et seg.) lays down that: ‘‘Where a navigable river forms the boundary of conterminous States, the middle of the channel or ‘thalweg’ is generally taken ys the line of separation between the two States, the presumption being that the right of navigation is common to both; but this presumption may be destroyed by actual proof of prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession, giving the riparian proprietors the exclusive title to the river.” I apprehend that a study of the records of Turkish Arabia and of the Ka ah for the past 200 years, as outlined in Lieutenant Wilson’s precis, will summarily dispose of any claim on the part of the Turks to “prior occupancy and long undisturbed possession.” I would further invite reference to the “Treaty of Vienna, 1815” (Hertslet’s Commercial Treaties, vol. i, p. 3 et seg.), to which, it would appear from a foot-note, lurkey has acceded, and which does not seem to contemplate the possibility of exclusive ownership of interstatal rivers. See my minute on p. 4 under 8 .— A. P. The fact, moreover, that the Porte has explicitly stated to Persia that should Turkey construct forts on the river in her territories, Persia might do likewise,* seems inconsistent with any assertion by Turkey of exclusive rights of sovereignty over the river, since it places Persia admittedly in a position to erect forts at Mohammerah and elsewhere, a position which would enable her to close the river at will and prevent all access from Bussorah to the sea ; this contingency was actually anticipated in the formal discussions whicli took place between His Majesty’s Government and the Porte in 1888 regarding the fortifications at Fao.f The right to build such forts upon a river bank is surely one of the first attributes of effective sovereignty. Our Legal Advisers do not agree with the conclusion arrived at by Sir P. Cox as to the effect of fortifications on the ownership of the river {see Foreign Office letter of the 31st May, 1912, to India Office. — A. P. It is, as a matter of fact, stated in a foot-note to p. 27 of the Foreign Office memorandum, that Mahommerah town was excluded from this engagement; there is nothing in the papers quoted above to indicate, that such was the case, but that it was so in practice may be inferred from the fact that in 1856 Persia had two large * Vide enclosure to Constantinople Embassy despatch No. 314, dated August 12, 1888, enclosed in Political Secretary’s letter dated October 12, 1888. f Vide note to Turkish Ambassador dated August 4, 1888, and note to Porte dated August 9, 1888, referred to in the embassy despatch quoted above, enclosed in Political Secretary s letter dated July 27, 1888. [2506 m — 1 ] ^forts at the mouth of the Karun, where it joins the Shatt-el-Arab ; these forts were made use of, unsuccessfully, to prevent British men-of-vvar from bombarding and landing troops at Mohammerah in the year 1857. My authority for my statement that Mohammerah town was excluded is the official correspori'dence which excluded it {see pp. 61 and 65 of Part III of printed correspondence respecting the frontier). I should not have made such a categorical statement “ as a matter of fact” without proper authority. — A. P. I venture in conclusion to doubt the accuracy of the statement made at the foot of p. 42 of the Foreign Office memorandum, to the effect that “ Persians could not navigate any part of the Shatt-el-Arab without being liable to the duties levied on shipping and merchandise by the Ottoman authorities.” My authority for this statement is Sir S. Canning’s despatch No. 239 of the 1 st November, 1844 {see pp. 115 and 116 of Part III of printed correspondence). It will be noticed that his Excellency states that “ from the collection of these duties an annual revenue of some amount accrues to the Pashalik of Bagdad.” A further search will be made in the Bagdad records. — A. P. I am not aware of any evidence that such was the case in practice, while old records seem to indicate that from 1760 to 1780 at ail events, the Ka’ab rather than the Turks were paramount on the river. Again, the latter are mentioned, in 1766, as building forts on either bank of the river, and the Turks are referred to as being “ in no capacity to stop them.”'* A little later, in 1769, the Ka’ab are found to be in alliance with the Turks, on the river, for operations against the Muntafik, while in 1775 they excelled all their previous exploits by sacking Bussorah. Were it not for the absence of further records, I have no doubt I could adduce other instances of action on the part of the Ka’ab, indicating either the exercise by them of sovereignty over the river or their joint enjoyment of it with the Turks. Note 7. The Status in Turkish Territory of the Sheikh and his Tribesmen. The provision of the Treaty of Erzeroum bearing upon the subject is as follows :— “ And they (the two Mussulman States) have agreed that the tribes concerning whom there is a dispute and whose suzerain is not known shall, once and for all, have the choice and election of the place where they will henceforward reside, and the tribes whose subjection is known shall be forcibly returned to the territory of the State to which they belong.” Bead in connection with the Treaty of 1823 this provision seems to indicate that the wandering or Ilyat tribes of the northern border are referred to rather than the settled tribes of the Shatt-el-Arab, and in this connection it would be interesting to know whether the word “ tribu ” in the French text is Ilyat or Tawa’if in the original Persian or Turkish text. It is, I think, clear from the correspondence of 1847, that the tribes referred to in the treaty are not nomads, but the settled tribes (see enclosures in Mr. Wellesley’s despatch No 81 of the 3rd March, 1847, Part III, pp. 39 and, 40, of printed correspondence). — A. P. Ihe second explanatory note of the mediating Powers also has an important bearing on the question, for it shows that Turkey then contemplated without demur the possibility of tribes genuinely dependent on Persia finding themselves established partly in Turkey, as also did the representatives of the mediating Powers. I am unable to agree with Sir P. Cox’s deduction, which is similar to that contained in Lieutenant Wilson’s precis, either as to the attitude of the Porte or as to that of the mediating representatives : the reason why the mediating repre sentatives confined their reply as they did is, I think, clear from p 40 of Part 3 of the printed correspondence respecting the frontier, viz., that the point was already * Vide Wilson’s precis, pp. 5 and 6, based on Saldanha’s Bombay selections.From the report of the mediating commissioners of 185(F- it is plain that they never visited Hawizeh, or the frontier line which they so airily attempted to lay down, and that they expressly placed it on record that they had hxed no frontier in this direction pending farther investigations. . . , , , . I In any case, Colonel Williams’ diagram (opposite p. 25) is hopelessly inaccurate ; he shows the Jaab Eiver (Suwaib or Karkheh) as running through Hawizeh instead of some 16 miles to the west of it. The mere fact that he calk it the Jaabt Eiver is something of an admission. Major Eawlinson’s map at p. 16 is equally vague, and he places Hawizeh many miles out of position. . The commissioners are full of explanations of their boundary line m the neighbour hood of the Shatt-el- Arab, but I have failed to find any remarks dealing with the boundary round Hawizeh. Had the commissioners realised the nature of the boundary they purported to lay down they could scarcely have failed to offer some explanations in regard thereto, but they are silent—as also, it seems, were the Turkish and Persian commissioners. , . , It should be noted, too, that Sir A. H. Layard, who seems to have been biased on the whole in favour of Turkey, suggested a boundary which ran west of Hawizeh (pp. 8 and 53). . . x ^ He was doubtless glad to fix it there from his personal experiences of the district, in which respect he seems to have had an advantage ovei the commissioners. His views have been published, and may carry weight with the Turks. It would (ipp 6 CL 7 ‘ very inexpedient to appeal to Sir H. Layard s published views respecting the Hawizeh region when in the same passage he has expressed views regarding the Mohammerah region so decidedly unfavourable to Persia. A. P. From a reference to p. 10 of Wilson’s precis, it will be seen that in no case can &lt;&lt; Bussorah and its acknowledged dependencies ” be held to have included in 1639 the district of Hawizeh, which was then undisputedly Persian. In 1727, moreover (see p. 55 , precis), it was provided by treaty that the province of Hawizeh should be ceded to Persia, though it does not appear that the Turks had ever taken it. From p. 8 of the precis, it will be seen that about 1600 the Ka’ab applied to the Vali of Hawizeh for assistance against the Afshars ; it was then a Persian dependency. This is a mistake : by the Treaty of 1727, Hawizeh was ceded to Turkey, not Persia: but see enclosure in Sir G. Lowthers despatch No. 341 of the 23rd April, 1912.—A. P. There is no evidence—it is not even alleged—that the Turks have ever raised a penny of revenue out of Hawizeh, or had a military post there. On the other hand, there is strong evidence that Hawizeh has been under Persia and paying revenue more or less continuously since 1600. It is of importance also to note that in 1877, when war threatened to break out between Turkey and Persia, the main Persian army was collected at Bisaitin, a village a few miles north of Shuaib and north west of Hawizeh, where the Governor-General was occupied in coercing a refractory sheikh of the Ma’adanJ (for remarks on whom see “ Gazetteer,” p. i 254). The precise position of Bisaitin has not yet been fixed, but it is a recognised point at or near the Hawizeh frontier, as locally observed. At the time in question there was no suggestion that the force was beyond the border of Arabistan, though it is on record that the presence of troops at Mohammerah was regarded as a menace (Enclosure 5, idem). Since 1877 the Persians have constantly sent armed forces to collect taxes, &amp;c., and, as far as I know, on no single occasion has any objection been raised by Turkey. The most recent occasions are 1905 and 1908 (see pp. 20 and 21 of precis). With reference to p. 45 of the Foreign Office memorandum, as the Turks have never occupied the district, there can be no question of their giving it up or abandoning it; as far as I am aware, they have never seriously laid claim to it, and it has been from time immemorial in the hands of Turkey and separated from Turkey by a wide marsh (see resident’s letter of the 6 th May). * We will defer dealing with the sinuosities and the prolongation of this line, in the direction o Hawizeh until our engineers have made their investigation of this line in the above-mentioned spots. ^ The Arabic equivalents of “ K,” ‘‘ J,’’ and “ Ch ” are commonly interchangeable, thus Kaab = Jaab — t See sub-enclosure 1 to enclosure 3 of Resident’s letter of April 8, 1912, to Foreign Department, a copy of which was sent to His Majesty’s Foreign Office.Is not merely a question - conceivable ; it strong strategically for both parties, and as such deserT^^f'adoption^ir 6 ’T ' 7 t i hostility exists between them,* andTam nersnadl/eK f ^ 8 ’ Persians - A bitt c r any other body could give effect in prL^ Ha f of at the expense of much blood and money.

Although in 1909 a hot-headed vali did much to strain the relations existing between the sheikh and the local Turkish officials, this year (1912) the sheikh’s relations are again cordial, and, if things are allowed to remain where they are, will doubtless remain so.

Sir ’ T vr , . , . Mohammerah, May 4, 1912. 1 *, i accordance with your instructions, I yesterday visited the islands in the Shatt- lab on the eastern side of the mid-channel stream below the village of Shatait, and have the honour to submit the following further details regarding their position, in mSsfer 0n ° f ^ deSpatch N °' 104 of the lst December, 1910, to His Majesty’s a ui 'E 116 map 1 t0 wpicp 1 would invite reference is that of the Shatt-el-Arab and Abbadan, on the scale 1 millim. = 1 inch. „ Dour islands are shown on this map, on the Persian side of the river, extending rom below Shatait to above Ma’awiyeh. 1 will describe them in turn, commencing with the one nearest Shatait. o. The first island is a small, very low-lying patch, in which date-palms have not yet been planted, though it is cultivated and banked. It was first brought under cultivation m 1908 by Zair Hussain, a subject of the sheikh, resident a few hundred yards lower down on the Persian side of the river, but last year the island was handed ovei by^the sheikh to Haji \\ ahab, of the Bu Chachirah. It has no recognised name. 4. The second island is that shown (incorrectly) alike on the above map and on the chart as “Dawasm.” It is a long and fertile island, stated to have been first brought under cultivation some fifteen years ago. It is cultivated by the adherents of Zair Hussain-ibn-Haji Mahmud, who are subjects of the Sheikh of Mohammerah and live on the Persian bank close by. The island yields a substantial revenue to the sheikh. ^ Arabs only apply the name “ Dowasir ” to the district on the Turkish bank. 5. lire third island is a mere mudbank, not yet cultivated, and covered at high tides. 6 . The fourth island, shown on the map as Ma’awiyeh, is, according to the state ments of old and respected Arabs resident in the locality, the “ Shalhah ” which the Turks claimed in 1877 (the Arabic date was correctly quoted to me). The general testimony of the elders of the tribe (Thawamir) which cultivate it was that it was first brought under cultivation about forty years ago, and that thirty-five years ago the incident referred to in my office note of the 15th December, 1910, took place. It is covered with date-palms, and yields a handsome revenue to the sheikh. The cultivators are Thawamir and Ma’awiyeh tribesmen, the former under Sheikh Ghazban-bin-Nasir; the latter first brought the island under cultivation, and it is sometimes called Nasiriyah in consequence. 7. I will conclude with a few general remarks affecting equally all the above islands : — (1.) They are uninhabited, the cultivators living on the mainland on the Persian side ; this is because the ground is swampy and unhealthy. tiii I 3 I [2473 bb- Not printed.(2.) They are not connected, even at the lowest tides, with the mainland, but at certain points the water is stated to fall at low tide sufficiently to enable men to wade across. (3.) The islands show a tendency to extend down-stream, and also to broaden in the direction of the main stream. (4.) They are all of comparatively recent growth, the eldest having been put under cultivation only forty years ago ; this is confirmed by Colonel Chesney’s chart of 1849 No. 12 , enclosed in his “Narrative of the Euphrates and Tigris Expedition,” in which the islands do not figure.

I now beg to offer the following further observations. ?. Position of Hawizeh. It will be seen from the remarks recorded in my memorandum above mentioned that some doubt is aroused as to the accuracy of the position of Hawizeh as indicated in the map of the SoutLnptoffiin 1873 ary C ° mmlSSIOn P ubIished ^ Ordnance Survey, This doubt is emphasised by the fact that the position also of Kut Nahr Hashim which was determined by surveys in 1910 with reference to Nasiri (Ahwaz), was found by Lieutenant Wilson to be considerably north of the position shown on the Commissioners’ map. For this reason, in the event of any formal demarcation of the boundarv on the Hawizeh side being contemplated, it would appear to be hmhlv esirable to get that important point accurately fixed astronomically and bv triangulation, with reference to some fixed point, and this is now rendered the more feasible by the fact that the position of Nasiri (Ahwaz) has recently been determined by Mr. G. B. Scott (Survey of India retired) whose results have, J understand, been examined and accepted as correct bv the Surveyor-General to the Government of India. J In my telegram above quoted I have ventured to invite Government to consider whethei or not such a survey can advisedly be put in hand. o. I now pass on to the details of the sketch submitted. As one pro ceeds from Nasiri to Hawizeh extensive wheat and barley cultivation by hamlet communities, dependent on Hawizeh, commences some 15 miles east of that place and extends intermittently up to it. Similar cultivation extends, again intermittently, from Hawizeh to Shu’aib ; in fact, the whole country comprised approximately in a triangle formed by lines joining Hawizeh, Shu’aib and Kishk-i-Basri is regularly occupied and cultivated, in patches more or less frequent and extensive in proportion to the rainfall, by the Arab tribes of Bani Salih and Bani Sakain, dependent on Hawizeh and Shn’aib. S. 158.—2. AAlthough mainly dwellers in tents, these can hardly be regarded as nomads in the sense that the Qashqai are nomadic, but must rather be looked upon as settled inhabitants. In the winter thev spread themselves all over the tract m small tent dwelling communities “families or clans—pasturing their flocks and cultivat ing the kind around them. As soon as they have gathered their harvest, in the month of May, and sold or stored their produce, they break up their encamp ments ; and while a proportion remain with their flocks in and around Hawizeh and Shu’aib and the marshy ground north of these centres, the the rest, probably the moiety, migrate to the date-gardens of the Karun and Shatt-el-’Arab, where, like our hop-pickers in Kent, they find employment for the summer months, returning after the date-harvest at the end of September or early in October to make preparations for their winter camp. 4. Hawizeh .—Hawizeh itself, whatever it may have been in its palmy days, is at the present time a dilapidated and squalid settlement of mud- built dwellings. The resident population at the time of my visit was certainly not more than 2,000 souls. Signs of the former more extensive settlement are still of course plentiful, in the shape of ruined houses and compound walls, while numerous Imams or shrines scattered far and wide in the neighbouring country bear evidence to its former prosperity. The settlement is situated on both banks, but mainly on the left or west bank, of a stream from 50 to 100 yards wide and (in April) 4 to 5 feet deep in mid-channel, which flows from the direction of Kut Nahr Hashim and is said by the inhabitants to be the Karkheh, though it can only be one of the many tentacles of that river. The inhabitants say that at the present day this stream gives a regular flow for eight months in the year, from November to June inclusive, but during the remaining four months it dries up and they are reduced for their drinking supply to water-holes sunk in the bed. From November to June they have a regular highway by water to Shu’aib, and thence to ’Amarah on the Tigris, and this accounts for the fact that they trade with ’Amarah rather than Nasiri. 5. Shuaib, 15f miles on a bearing of 8 degrees N. of west from Hawizeh, is a settled village of the Bani Salih, containing about 150 adult men and between 500 and 600 souls living in permanent dwellings, built and thatched . with stout reeds from the adjacent marsh. Apart from the produce of the cultivation of the ground in the immediate vicinity the inhabitants also go in extensively for spearing and netting fish. The village is prettily situated on both banks of a small stream at the point where it enters the marsh. This stream, entering from the north, receives the waters of the Hawizeh stream, when flowing, but is also joined by other feeders from the north, and is said by the inhabitants never to become entirely dry. They are thus able to maintain communication with ’Amarah throughout the year, and the village possesses 12 or 15 bellams (canoes) which ply for hire and convey passengers and merchandise to and from that place. They have also water communication with the Shatt-el-’Arab at Swaib, opposite Qurneh, but seem seldom to use that channel. (Note .—It is important that there should be no confusion between the villages of Shu’aib (near Hawizeh) and Swaib (on the Shatt-el-’Arab). Although the two villages are connected by one stream, a broad and specific distinction is made by the inhabitants of ’Arabistan in the pronunciation of the two names. The northern village is known as Shu’aib ( in two syllables, and if reduced to writing would probably be spelt with the letter £., while the latter is pronounced markedly in one syllable “ Swaib,” or more often “ Swebb.” 6 . Frontier and Jurisdiction .—To the eastward of the village of Shu’aib, or rather of the marsh on the edge of which it is situated, and southwards, as far as human occupation prevails or is possible, there is not the slightest sign of Turkish influence or jurisdiction nor of Turkish status.

I have, &amp;c.„ P. Z. Cox, Lieutenant-Colonel, Memorandum by the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, to accompany Sketch showing Turco-Persian Frontier as occupied and claimed by Persia west and south of Hawizeh according to statements of local inhabitams in April 1912. (Compiled from plane table survey from tlaunzeh via Shuaib to Di aiji by Surveyor Firuz Bakht, under the supervision of Sir P. Z.' Cox, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, April 1912.) Some explanation of the status of this sketch and the basis on which it rests is necessary. On the 18th April (?) His Majesty’s Government telegraphed to the Government of India asking for information by telegram as to the precise distance west of Hawizeh of the lurco-Persian frontier as locally observed. Available maps and records supplying no information on this point, no European having visited the district for the last 50 years, and the second hand explanations of the Shaikh of Mohammerah and representatives of his being too sketchy and unintelligible to be of use, it became necessary to visit the locality before the information required by His Majesty’s Government could be supplied. The undersigned accordingly proceeded to the neighbourhood from Ahwaz on the 24th April with a native surveyor kindly supplied by the Anglo- Persian Oil Company. . . . . , It was understood at the time of starting that the position of Hawizeh itself, as fixed by the Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission of 1849-55, was accepted as correct and was not a matter in dispute, and consequently, in order to economise time, the plane table work was commenced from that point, that is from Hawizeh. On reaching the Shatt-el-’Arab, however, on completion of the journey, and comparing the positions of Kishk-i-Hawizeh and Kishk-i-Basri and the distances of these places and of Hawizeh from the Shatt-el-’Arab with those given in the 1873 (Ordnance Survey, Southampton) edition of the Com missioner’s map, a copy of which had now been obtained, it was seen that while the plane table survey showed the position of the places named in the same longitudinal line as the Commissioner’s map, there was a considerable difference in the latitudinal position, the plane table map showing Kishk-al- Basri and Kishk-al-Hawizeh considerably further north, and the total distance between Hawizeh and the coast more than that shown by the Commissioners. The result of this is to suggest some doubt as to whether the position of Hawizeh should not be further north than that assigned to it by the Commissioners. As, however, this sketch was undertaken primarily in order to^ fix the position of the boundary west of Hawizeh, and as the relative positions of Hawizeh and Shuaib are not affected by the discrepancy indicated in the distances north and south, it was considered best for present purposes coTo the Political Secretary, India Office, London, S.W.

To what he records I may add that when at Ahwaz a few days ago whilst consulting the Shaikh regarding the Hawizeh boundary, I took the opportunity to question him regarding the nature of his ownership of the land beta een the locally recognized boundary and Failiyeh. He stated emphatically that there was no difference whatever in the nature of his tenure there (nor had there been in the case of his father) from that existing m the case of any- other lands in his jurisdiction, as, for example Abbadan, a part of which he has recently leased to the Oil Company that is to say, that the possession of the land is vested in him not as private owner but as tribal overlord, his hereditary rights as such having been specifically recognized by farman from the Persian Government . He altogether denied that in his own time or in that of his father (&gt;.e., since 1857), any tribute had been paid on account of any of these lands to the Government of Basrah. 4. The bona fides of the Persian claim to the sovereignty of the above lands, as already explained, receives constructive corroboration from the fact that though the Shaikh (and his predecessors), and their tribesmen have for many years been the private proprietors of large and valuable tracts of land on the islands and mainland adjacent to the boundary but in Turkish territory, the difference in the tenure is frankly recognised and the taxes readily paid to the Turkish authorities. There is no record of cases of such private ownership being used to build up factitious claims designed to convert the lands into Persian territory, nor, indeed, is there the slightest inducement to do so, for as proprietors in Turkish territory the occupants are, on the whole, better off than their fellows in Persian jurisdiction where the rig]its of landowners are less well defined, and they are more a prey to arbitrary treatment than they are in Turkey. 5. T will postpone any further remarks on the question of the frontier pending the receipt of the further papers promised in Foreign Office Despatch, No. 1, Political, 13,425/12, of 29th March 1912. 8. 158.—i.2 6 . As the question is under the lively consideration of His Majesty’s Government, I have ventured to send a copy of this letter simultaneously to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India. Sir Henry McMahon, G.C.V.O., &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c. From Lieutenant A. T. Wilson, Indian Army, on special duty, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, Bushire. Mohammerah In accordance with your instructions I yesterday revisited the Nahr- Khaiyin and made a close examination of the lands on its banks from its eastern mouth above the Shaikh s palace to its western mouth at Hiaiji, and I now have 'the honour to submit the following further details in amplification of previous correspondence. 2. The position of the various canals, with their names, and those of the The following important alterations and additions have been made. 3. The Khaiyin Canal. I am satisfied that the name Khaiyin is applied to the whole canal from its junction with the Nahr Diaiji to its mouth above the Shaikh’s palace ; the small branch running north from the lower mouth and named by me originally Khaiyain is called Nahr Nazailah locally. 4. Tamar. I had not previously succeeded in identifying this place, which is referred to in Mr. Parker’s memorandum of 5th September 1910, and in subsequent correspondence : the identification of its position is of considerable importance as it indicates that the boundary as locally recognised is identical with that claimed by the Persians in 1850, on grounds which Colonel Shell considered in the main to be well founded, and which have gained additional force from 60 years undisturbed possession. My failure to identify it previously is found to be due to the fact that it had been assumed from the reading of the word in English that its phonetic sound would be Tamar or Tamr, which was not recognised by any of the local people from whom enquiries were made. As I had heard from you that on your way back from Hawizeh a property named Tamar had been mentioned to you I had no difficulty in identifying it beyond any doubt. 5. From conversation with local headmen from both Persian and Turkish territory, I obtained the following further statements regarding the status quo. All alike assured me that in their lifetime the boundary as now shown had never been questioned by Turkey, but that, on the contrary, the Turks had frequently given specific recognition to it. and many years ago had actually buried some coal in a pit near the present line as a permanent boundary mark. The periodical cleaning of the Nahr Khaiyin, they said, had always been undertaken by Persian subjects under the orders of the Shaikh, whilst the cleaning of the Diaiji canal was only undertaken under the orders of the Turkish mudirs. This seems a point of considerable importance in favour of the Persian case. 6 . The Shaikh’s palace in the Khumaiseh lands was, they said, built some 12 years ago, and has been occupied without question ever since by one of the Shaikh’s principal wives, and for the past six years by one of his sons who is in charge of the lands, though his youth at present makes his responsibility only nominal.

Secret Department. From Viceroy, 13th July 1912. Foreign Secret. Bagdad railway negotiations. Yonr telegram of 1st July. I find it difficult to reconcile statement that proposed arrangement is a concession in appearance only, with the loss of large piece of territory by the Sheikh, which is implied in the immediately following sentence. If any real loss of territory is involved by these proposals, Sheikh will naturally resent it, and the arrangement must consequently be deprecated. News just received of German attempted intrigue with Sheikh (vide my telegram of 11th July) emphasises the necessity for carefully avoiding any concessions that may estrange Sheikh and drive him into German hands, or which Turkey may be able to transfer to Germany to our detriment. If, however, the present status quo is clearly defined in such a way as to place on record existing administrative influence of Sheikh throughout wider limits attributed to Koweit in Lorimer’s Gazetteer ; if Warba and Bubian are admitted by Turkey to be within Koweit limits and their garrison withdrawn, and if Turkey agrees not to take any action, military or otherwise, within those wider limits without our consent, the arrangement will not involve loss of territory and becomes practicable. We should, however, be given full opportunity of explaining any arrangement contemplated concerning Koweit to Sheikh and obtaining his previous concurrence. I see no objection to proposed Turkish agent at Koweit, provided Sheikh’s position is recognised as autonomous, and if we are given opportunity of explaining to Sheikh that the presence of an agent is the natural result and price of autonomy and a direct recognition of it, as illustrated by Khedive having a Turkish agent at Cairo. Sheikh, it is understood, will be guaranteed enjoyment of his properties in Turkish territory (vide memorandum to Porte). There would be no objection to a convention with Turkey confirming our agreements with Sheikh if terms are worded so as to imply nothing more than suzerainty, but will this satisfy Turkey, who desires the terms to be compatible with her sovereign rights, which are out of the question ? I need hardly emphasise the importance throughout these negotiations of avoiding anything which in eyes of Sheikh, and consequently of (? ruler of) Bahrein and trucial chiefs, would appear want of good faith or admission of weakness on our part in a region where, at the present moment, we undoubtedly are strong.ANNEXE His Majesty’s Government wish to mention question to which they attach great importance, out to Which they have not referred in this ranaum;^as it is not germane to the subjects discussed in that docuiaentTJ His Majesty’s Government desire to secure oxmo the duties leviable upon certain cla cotton yarns and manufactures shall in no case exceed certain specific rates to be agreed upon.

(1) I suggest 'over 80$' (2) I agree to Hurst's wording hut I have had a long set-to with Stanley about cotton, and find myself in sneahing sympathy with the Board of Trade view — to this extent that it is very difficult to justify taxing British trade heavily in order to buy political advantages which we have hitherto enjoyed for nothing. At the same time I am dead against introducing cotton, and shall resist it for all I am worth. The Board of Trade want a tangible commercial advantage: well, the nearest approach to that is the navigability and navigation of the river. To secure that to its full extent is as good as — indeed better than — to secure the railway: and the British merchant will probably see it if it is explained to him. Slwuld we, then, (as a lesser evil than introducing cotton) stiffen our demand for steamers? What we want to do is to encourage the Turks to put their money into the river (they will then have no inducement to build the railway)and to ensure that t}m river service shall expand with the expansion of trade. I can't think of a formula at the moment, perhaps you can. (3) All right about the KaimakmThere remains the Government of India's telegram about Tates. Out railway expert, after consulting the Board of Trade, does not think it necessary to insist on Bo. 1 now that m are going to stand out of the railvjay; hut thinks thense is no harm in putting it forward, as something that might he giveh away. I confess I don't altogether understand it, hut should prefer to put it forward. So much depends on the effective opening of the -river (which is so very problematic) that I do not like to neglect any safeguard. As regards the second point, he thinks it advisable to secure fj if possible either that a month's notice should he given of increased rates jor that increased rates should not he charged on goods already in transit when the increase was made. I don't quite see inhere these points are to he worked in ttnless they go into that covering letter which will soon assume the dimensions of another memorandumi Yours sincerely, (Sd. ) A.Htrtz&amp;l.

To show the actual state of things as regards oatr at that date we quote the following selection of evidence from a report dated 21st August 1829 from an Indian Naval (not political) officer, and from other contemporary records; and it will he observed that, there being no question then between the British and ;urkish Governments, these reports, which were made by officers in the pursuit of their ordinary duties, are necessarily impartial Captain G.B.Bracks, writing on August 21st, 1829 furnished the following report:- ' A1 Bidder (El Bidaa). The people are mostly fish ermen. They are subject to Bahrein. A1 Owhale (Hawaileh) is subject to Bahrein. Puwals. The inhabitants are subject to Bahrein. Yossfee.

The terri- tory of Bahrein consists of the two islands known by that name, and the line of coast extending from the bottom of the bight in which they are situated to Khor al-Adeed, on the other side of the promontory of Has Tanoorah.

According to the official records of the British government the following is the position with regard to Bahrein and El Katr:- m the latter half of the 18th century the Uttobees (an independent tribe) having settled at Zobara and ejected the Persians from Bahrein, became paramount there. In 1851 the /ahabee Ameer established a Govern or at El Bidaa, and threatened to occupy the Bahrein Islands. But peace was concluded in the same year, and the town of El Bidaa was restored to the Bahrein Chief. Disagreements between the latter and his dependents on Katr peninsula were settled by British intervention in 1868. In that year Her Majesty’s Government also con cluded an agreement with Muhammad-bin-lhani Sheikh of El Katr. As soon as Midhat's expedition was heard of, i the British Ambassador protested to the Grand Vizier in person on 3rd April 1871, and these protests were re peatedrepeated by monsieur Pisani on 25th April ,and 15th May. In return, explicit assurances were given 'by the Grand /izie^, which satisfied Her Majesty's Government, and they were repeated hy Server Pasha on 18th January, 1872. They were referred to hy the British Political Officer in a communication to Midhat Pasha, who did not himself, nor did the Turkish Government, dispute them. In 1871 a deputation was sent hy the Commander of the Turkish troops to induce Jasim, Muhammad-hin-Thani's son, to accept the Turkish flag. Muhammad, at that time old and infirm, did not approve of this step, and continued to fly the Arah flag over his own house. It was in 1876 that Sheikh Jasim was first appointed Kaimakam hy the Turkish Government, his father having died in 1878. In 1881 Sheikh Jasim however, renewed, orally, the agreement of 1868 with the British Govern ment, the Sheikh undertaking, inter alia ^ to refer his disagreements with neighbouring Sheikhs to the British Resident at Bushire. In 1882 Jasim having harassed certain Indian traders, the Government of India compelled him to pay an indemnity and to apologise, on pain of instant hostilities.t &gt; t *JK. *■ •' t f c | o nostilities.

They are persuaded that such an agreement, to be justly appreciated, should be viewed not only in the measure of sacrifice or advantage which each individual clause may imply, but also in its cumulative and future effects upon Anglo-Turkish relations in general. His Majesty’s Government therefore desire to lay before the Ottoman Government the following proposals and considerations :— - For convenience of reference the several proposals under consideration may be dealt with under three distinct headings :— (i.) The Bagdad Railway question. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. (iii.) An increase from 11 per cent, to 15 per cent, ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. (i.) The Bagdad Railway Question. ^.The interest which Great Britain must take in a railway which is to traverse a region where British-Indian trade amounts to some 60 per cent, of the totdl exports and imports is indeed so obvious as to call for little comment. His Majesty’s Government have on repeated occasions dwelt upon the importance of that trade and the manner in which it has been steadily consolidated since the foundation, upwards of two and a-half centuries ago, of the first English factory at Bussorah; they have recalled that, up to a recent date, no less than 96 per cent, of the steam [778] B §; 1tonnage entered at the port, of Bussorah was British ; and they have consistently maintained that a satisfactory settlement of the Bagdad Kailway question was a necessary condition of their assent to an increase in the Turkish customs duties. . The magnitude of these commercial interests also clearly rendeyecj it desirable that some satisfactory agreement as to British participa tion in the southern section of the Bagdad Bail way should, if possible, be reached. His Majesty’s Government find, however, that the question of participation on terms acceptable to them is likely to cause the Ottoman Government some embarrassment, and that the views held on this point by the two contracting parties are difficult to reconcile. In these circumstances His Majesty’s Government, anxious to prove to the Ottoman Government the sincerity of their desire to reach a comprehensive understanding without undue delay or controversy, are prepared to withdraw their request for British participation in the railway from Bagdad to Bussorah. f, . It would be impossible to reconcile British public opinion to such a step unless His Majesty’s Government were at the same time able to show that British interests of whatever character were fully safeguarded. His Majesty’s Government consequently feel bound, apart from the territorial arrangements proposed, to lay down the following conditions as essential to that end :— (a.) An arrangement, as set forth in the Draft Conv accompanying draft convention, for the exclusion tlon ^ of differential treatment on all railways in Asiatic Turkey, as well as an undertaking explained in a separate paper as to the treatment of certain British imports. (6.) The admission of two British representa tives to the board of whatever company may undertake the administration of the railway from Bag-dad to Bussorah. (c.) The terminus of the railway to be at Bussorah. (d.) No railway to be continued beyond Bus^orah in the direction of the Persian Gulf without prior agreement with His Majesty’s Government, and on conditions acceptable to them. (e.) A convention to be signed, on the basis Draft Corm of the accompanying draft, for the future con- tlon servancy of the Shatt-el-Arab.3 (/•) An undertaking that the number of British vessels navigating between Bagdad and Bussorah shall he increased to six. (ii.) The respective interests of Great Britain and Turkey in the region of the Persian Gulf. A His Majesty’s Government have learnt with some disappointment of the attitude of the Imperial Ottoman Government in regard to El Katr and Koweit ; nevertheless they do not doubt that the Ottoman Government will appreciate the important sacrifice made by His Majesty’s Government in the matter of British participation in the Bagdad Bail way, and that they will meet that sacrifice by a correspond ing modification of the views set forth in the Turkish memorandum of the 15th April. ^ t His Majesty’s Government must in the first instance protest against the contention that there is a misunderstanding with regard to the assur ance given, and repeatedly given, to Her Majesty’s Ambassador at Constantinople, to the effect that Turkey did not entertain any intention of obtain ing the supremacy over Bahrein, Muscat, or the independent tribes on the coast of the Persian (^.The original despatches, duly signed and dated, in which these assurances were reported, have been carefully preserved in the archives of the Foreign Office, and they can readily be produced for the inspection of the Turkish Embassy. /^His Majesty’s Government are unable to admit that any of the arguments adduced in the Turkish memorandum in any way invalidates the state ment that south of Ojeir, in the district of El Katif, there is no trace of Turkish power ever- having been paramount; and they are fully persuaded that El Katr has never been locally regarded as forming part of, or indeed as being subject to the influence of, the Ottoman Empire, ['2/'0V|'UA. b'C4 I L His Majesty’s Government can only reiterate their opinion that any lasting settlement between the two Powers must provide for the definite renunciation by the Ottoman Empire of the whole of the peninsula ot El Katr, including El Bidaa. They have consistently opposed any consolidation of Turkish authority, which first attempted to assert itseif so recently as 1870, and they are bound to continue that opposition, in the interests of the Sheikh of Bahrein, of the pearl fishery, and of the successful suppression of the arms traffic. //.The Turkish memorandum of the 15th April does not afford His Majesty’s Government all the information which they consider essential to a due appreciation of the attitude of the Turkish Government respecting Koweit. His Majesty’s Government are concerned to ensure the continu ance of the local government of the Sheikh of Koweit, which incontestably forms part of the status quo, and, while they are not prepared to agree to their conventions with the Sheikh being superseded, they none the less would be willing to agree to their being confirmed by, and thus to meet the wishes of, the Ottoman Government. Further, His Majesty’s Government would be fully pre pared to recognise Turkish suzerainty over Koweit and indeed to recognise the Sheikh as a Turkish kaimakam, but they attach cardinal importance to the islands of Warba and Bubiyan being admitted by Turkey to be within the confines of Koweit, to the withdrawal of the Turkish military post from Bubiyan, and to a recognition of the limits of Koweit in accordance with the indications contained in the accompany ing memorandum. •Vlis Majesty’s Government regret that they would consider the introduction of divided re sponsibility for ^ofice/mantime measures altogether incompatible with the principles and successful accomplishment of their policy in the Persian Gulf. This policy consists in the maintenance of the maritime peace, and has been successfully pursued, to the advantage of all concerned, for a century. To modify the system in these circum stances would be alike unnecessary and unjustifiable. • Indeed His Majesty’s Government would go further. They consider that they have acquired by prescription not merely the right but the duty to maintain peace in the Persian Gulf; and they have always been opposed to any proposal to trench upon their prerogative; and it was this5 ( JpVVv* C., /• -v^a &lt;#**&gt;,,.. Memorandum. attitude which led to the declaration made by the Marquess of Lansdowne in the House of Lords on the 5th May, 1903, that “ His Majesty’s Government would regard the establishment of a naval base, or of a fortified port, in the Persian Gulf by any other Power as a very grave menace to Liitish interests, and they should certainly resist it with all the means at their disposal.” /3plrs Majesty s Government have no wish to foi mulate excessive demands. Their desire is simply to ensure the continuance of an order of things which has been proved by experience to favour the development of trade and the main tenance of peace in a region which, but for long-sustained British intervention, would have remained the scene of continual piracy and bloodshed. /■j/1 hey feel persuaded that the Ottoman Govern ment will not oppose the continuance of the political status quo of a hundred years, and they look forward confidently to a complete adjustment of the questions enumerated, and to the improved relations which cannot fail to ensue. A7„ As the Ottoman Government are aware, there is a question which has caused some concern to His Majesty’s Government in recent months, that of the frontier between Turkey and Persia in the region of Mohammerah. When His Majesty’s Government addressed their memorandum of July 1911 to the Ottoman Government that question had been dormant for sixty years, and His Majesty’s Government had no desire to raise it. They feel, however, that no settlement could be complete which did not provide for this question, and theymave the honour to submit ja separate memorandum on the subject for the consideration of the Ottoman Government. A (hi.) An increase from 11 percent, to 15 per cent ad valorem in the Turkish customs duties. If the Ottoman Government are prepared to conclude an agreement in the sense of this memorandum, and to concur in the removal of the existing veto on the borrowing powers of Egypt, then, subject to the assent of the other Powers, His Majesty’s Government will consent to the further increase of the Turkish customs for a period of seven years from April 1914, and they will also agree to the continued levy of the existing 3 per cent, customs increase for a similar period. till A'O j '/“ a documeniis the property 0 / t7 ie Secretary 0 / State / or /lidig i w Coun cil. Secret. Bagdad-Basra Railway. T. The present position.—kt the interdepartmental conference of 30th March 1911, Sir E. Grey proposed that we should ask for 50 per cent, participation, and a memorandum for the Turkish Government was prepared on this basis. On the 7th April 1911 the Board of Trade wrote that there were “only two practicable policies” (1) “ to participate in the working of “ tlie southern section on terms of equality with Germany, but to the &lt;c exclusion of all third parties as regards control,” and (2) to refuse participation altogether. No further communications passed between the departments on this subject, but on 12th July 1911 a draft memorandum to the 1 urkish Government was privately communicated to the India Office. 1 his memorandum contained the proposal, which was actually made to the Turkish Ambassador on 29th July 1911, that Great Britain, Russia, France, Germany, and Turkey, should participate at the rate of 20 per cent, each, and that a convention should be drawn up precluding differential rates on all the railways of Asia Minor. The Turkish Government replied on 15th April 1912, not expressly rejecting this proposal, but substituting 25 per cent, participation for Great Britain, France, Germany, and Turkey, to the exclusion of Russia. But in the private discussions that preceded the despatch of this reply the Turkish representatives more than once stated in the strongest terms their objection, on political grounds, to the inclusion of Russia, and said that if His Majesty’s Government pressed it they would be obliged to insist on the admission of Switzerland. This His Majesty’s Government would of course not be able to accept, for it would strengthen the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest at our expense. Russia, it will be borne in mind, has said that, while she only wants to help us, she wants to be admitted if France is admitted. The Turkish counter-proposal of 15th April 1912 is therefore not a mere modification of our own, but, in effect, a complete rejection of it. A new situation is thus created, and it is submitted that in the circumstances His Majesty’s Government are bound to consider it on its merits, and that it is possible for us, without doing any violence to diplomatic conventions, or giving any just cause of offence to Turkey, to treat our proposal of 29th July 1911 as completely out of court, and to substitute for it a better one, if such can be found. It may be conceded that as we have actually proposed the admission of France and Russia our position is no longer as strong as it was for proposing their omission. But here the Turks have fortunately helped us. For if Russia insists on participating in the event of French participation, while Turkey will admit France but not Russia, the result is a deadlock of wdiich the only solution is the omission of both. The following considerations are intended to show that the proposal of 29th July 1911 should not be pressed, and that the terms which Sir E. Grey originally wished to put forward are, as the Board of Trade held, the only ones on which we should now consent to participate. II. The objections to the last proposals made by His Majesty's Govern ment .—The view underlying those proposals is that, provided we can secureo a convention absolutely precluding differential rates on the whole of the Bagdad Railway system, the degree of our participation in the Gulf section is immaterial, and that it is in fact worth oui while to pui chase the convention by abating our claims to participation. The objections are :— (a) That no convention can absolutely preclude differentiation or the application of those advantages which Protectionist countries acc' &gt;rd their trade. This is in effect the Board of Trade view also. (5) That the Bagdad Railway Convention already does so, a-; far as any convention can. See Article 24 of the Cahiei des Charges . tons “ Les tarifs, qu’ils soient generaux, speciaux, ou proportionnels ou “ differentiels, sont applicables a tons les voyageurs et expeditems “ sans distinction.” This applies to the Bagdad-lvhanikin bianch (Article 1 of the Convention), and to the Alexandretta concession, which is given on the same terms as the Convention of 1903 except where otherwise specified. (c) Differential rates are not the only risk involved in absence of effective control. The Bagdad Railway Committee in its report of 26th March 1907, quoted Sir James Mackay’s opinion that the Company, if under “a management of which this country exercised no “ influence or control” “ would lose no time in establishing a line “ of steamers from the terminus to Bombay, and in course of time li they would virtually monopolize the entire trade between India “ and the Persian Gulf, because it would be impracticable for the “ British lines to compete against the ships supported by the “ Railway Company, which would give through bookings and “ through rates for passengers and cargo.” This danger would, exist the moment that the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest preponderated over the British interest, i.e., the moment the latter was less than 50 per cent. Again, there is the risk (referred to in the same report) that the “ Railway Company will make it their business to cut the freights “ between Basra and Bagdad, so as to be able to compete with the “ river-borne traffic,” that is to say, the Bagdad Railway Company, if preponderant on the Gulf section, will drive the steamers off the river, and then raise the rates on the railway. They will not, of course, be able to do so beyond the point at which it will pay to put the steamers back on the river. But in order that we may be ready to take advantage of that moment when it comes it will be necessary that the steamers shall be there, which probably means paying Messrs. Lynch or someone else a subsidy to keep them efficient, though idle—another charge on the revenue of the Gulf Section before it can pay a dividend. (d) The Gulf section being the shortest necessarily determines the rates on the northern section to Bagdad. It is therefore our interest to have as free a hand as possible on that section. Therefore a convention applicable to the whole Bagdad Railway system is a positive disadvantage to us. (e) It is our interest to have as free a hand as possible because it is essential to prevent the Bagdad Railway Company’s interest from getting the preponderance. This is not sufficiently secured by the 20 per cent, participation, since we cannot depend on the permanencein all circumstances of the entente, commercially and financially (French finance, for example, is notoriously beyond the control of its Government;; while politically it may be a serious source of weakness elsewhere (as pointed oat by the Viceroy in his telegram of 29th May see Appendix) that we should have important commercial interests bound up with the permanence of the entente in Mesopotamia. (/) As a financial proposition it is to be feared that 20 per cent, in an international railway 350 miles long costing less than 3,000,000L to construct, will not be considered worth looking at. On the other hand the facts that (1) the German Company has first of all to be compensated ; (2) rolling stock has to be provided and ports to lie built; (3) the expenses of international management will be unnecessarily heavy; (4) the railway will have no prospect of paying for many years (until, in fact, Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed); (5) in the meantime there will be no guarantee (for it may be taken as certain that the Government of India, at all events, will give no guarantee) ; will be further disastrous to its flotation. The British share will simply not be taken up : and where is the Russian share to come from, when the Russian Government cannot find money for its favoured project, the Trans- Persian Railway, and Russian unofficial finance is concentrated on that enterprise ? (y) If, therefore, participation on these terms is of no value as a financial proposition, and if we have not sufficient control to prevent the Bagdad Railway interest from preponderating, there is no apparent commercial advantage in participation over non-participation. (h) The Gulf section would be a most valuable political asset if it were all British. It would still be valuable if it were British controlled, but it loses in value by leaps and bounds as British participation diminishes, until a point is reached where prestige will suffer less and dignity be better consulted if the country ’which owns 70 per cent, of the trade and 85 per cent, of the shipping stands aloof altogether, rather than participates on an equality with three other Powmrs wdio have practically no material stake in the country at all. (?) No attempt has been made to show r how the joint arrangement is to work in practice, e.g., is the actual working agency to be international, and is it seriously thought that that would be workable ? Again, in order that the commercial interests of the line may be effectively safeguarded, it must be w r orked independently of, and to some extent in opposition to, the Bagdad Railway : but it is extremely doubtful whether any arrangement with this object would be found workable in practice. III. The view therefore supported is that of the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911—that the only alternatives are to participate on a 50 per cent, basis (to which it should be added that, in that case, the Chairman must be British), or not to participate at all. (a) The view that British control on the Gulf section is useless without a convention to prevent differential rates on the rest of the system has already been dealt with. It has also been pointed out that4 by controlling the shortest section we should, in fact, control the rates over the German section. It may further be urged that the sole effect to the Bagdad Railway Company of imposing differential rates against British goods between Alexandretta and Bagdad would be to send British trade round to the Basra-Bagdad line. With 50 per cent., the casting vote on the Board, and a free hand as regards rates, our position would, therefore, be impregnable. (b) What would it be if we did not participate at all ? It must be premised that from the British and Indian point of view it is better that the railway should not be built. It must be remembered that there is no analogy between the position now and the position in 1903. Then we might have had substantial participation in the whole length of the railway, which would, besides, have admitted us to the exploitation of a new country. Now we are offered 20 per cent, in a branch 350 miles long, which will admit other Powers on equal terms with us to the exploitation of a country of whose trade we already have 1 0 per cent. Politically. —The construction of the railway means the military and administrative consolidation of Turkey in Mesopotamia, with an increased tendency to seek influence in the Persian Gulf, and to extend control in Arabia, and an increased power of offensive against British interests, including Koweit and Mohammera. It further means the firmer establishment of German, French, and Russian interests—with a corresponding tendency to intervene—in a region where the outside interests have hitherto been preponderatingly British. (It is not of course suggested that we can, or ought to try to, keep every one else out; but to invite them in, and on such terms, is quite another matter.) Commercially. —Our interests are twofold. There is the existing trade with Western Persia via Bagdad and Ixhanikin, and the trade which is expected to grow up when Mesopotamia is irrigated and developed. The Persian trade is worth about 2,000,000k It is difficult to forecast its future; but if the Trans-Persian Railway is built, and Mohammera connected with it and with Burujird, the Persian trade will presumably desert Bagdad altogether. If Persian Railways remain in abeyance, it is not clear that we shall be worse off than we are at present, so long as the river between Bagdad and the Gulf is open, and Article 24 of the Cahier des Charges operates to prevent differential rates on the Bagdad Railway. Again, the future local trade of Mesopotamia, being mainly in agricultural products, will probably in any case flow westwards to Alexandretta. This view seems to be borne out by the latest figures available for the trade of Bagdad, 1910, which are as follows :— Imports to Bagdad. From—United Kingdom •• France Austria-Hungary Belgium Germany United States of America India, China, and Japan - £ 1,317,762 203,284 180,011 211,835 53,705 806 664,147Exports from Bagdad. ' To—United Kingdom France - Austria-Hungary Belgium Germany United States of America - India, China, and Japan The bulk of the British and Indian imports seems to be in cotton goods, twist and woollens, and that of the exports carpets, wool, opium and hides. It is, however, possible that cotton will be grown and pressed in Mesopotamia and will find its way into eastern markets, and the mineral resources of the country (especially oil) may also add to the trade eastwards. But, speaking generally, it does not seem certain that the volume of trade resulting from the development of Mesopotamia will necessitate the construction of the Gulf section if India is not to lose its share, and it is probable that India will retain her share whether it is built or not. But, of course, it is not possible to assume that the railway will never be built. From the difficulty which it is understood that the Germans have had in disposing of the bonds of the other sections of the Bagdad Railway, and from their willingness to part with their rights in the Gulf section, it may, indeed, be inferred that they will be in no hurry to undertake the latter, while the Turks themselves have neither the money nor the means of obtaining it. The construction will therefore be postponed, but—as the line is of military and political importance to Turkey—it will eventually be built In the interval much may have happened in Mesopotamia, as the Viceroy has reminded us, and it is not easy to foresee the conditions that will then exist. But, supposing that the railway is worked on commercial lines, and that the clause precluding differential tariffs is still operative, it does not appear, from the point of view of our trade, that 1 he fact of our having no share in it will be a disadvantage. But, of course, it may not be run on commercial lines. Protected by their kilometric guarantees the Germans may prefer to let it rust—it would always be available for Turkish military purposes-- and attract all the traffic to the Northern section. In that case, too, it does not appear that, provided the river were kept free, we should be any worse off commercially than if the line did not exist at all. Politically, no doubt, we should be, because the Turkish consolidation would be effected, and if the railway were built under German auspices, German influence would be brought very near to the Gulf. But provided that we can ensure that the line will not be carried beyond Basra or, if so, only on terms agreeable to Great Britain, and provided that we have in the meantime consolidated our own position in the Gulf, that risk might fairly be taken. The one serious drawback would be that referred to under head (c) on page 2 -the danger of the extinction of the British carrying trade between India and Bagdad. Although this disadvantage might to some extent be compensated by the advantages that might accrue to other branches of trade, it is a very real one and would have to be faced. (It could only be met, apparently, by a corresponding interworking between steamships and railway £ 330,361 132,131 14,591 3,077 30,441 155,049 87,478— 6 companies on the Indian side— a matter which would obviously require very careful consideration). Moreover, as has alieady been pointed out, it is equally attendant upon any arrangement which does not secure to this country effective control of the Gulf section. IV. The. importance of the river.—The necessity of keeping the river open has been emphasised throughout these remarks. By that is meant not only ensuring that it is kept properly dredged and navigable, and that no prohibitive dues are placed upon shipping (both of which will be secured, as far as the Shat-el-Arab is concerned, by the separate Convention settingup a Riverain Commission), but also by maintaining the right of navigation as far as Bagdad. This is equally necessary, for the reasons already given, whether we renounce the Railway altogether or participate in it on terms short of effective control. It is therefore essential that the questions should at once be closely examined with a view to ascertaining exactly what rights of navi gation British shipping possesses on the Tigris and Euphrates, and what steps should be taken to put them on a secure basis. V. Conclusions, —’The conclusions seem to be— 1. That, if the river is open, it is better for us that the railway should never be built; 2. That it is therefore not our interest to facilitate it except on terms which will make it commercially and politically advantageous to ourselves ; 3. That the only terms on which it will be thus advantageous are that we secure effective control, i.e., 50 per cent, participation, the casting vote on the board of management, and a free hand as regards rates. 4 That failing that, we should stand out altogether, and con centrate on getting what we want in the Gulf, and especially the joint control with Turkey of the Shat-el-Arab and the right of navigation to Bagdad, which are really the key to the situation. Mr. Brereton (Government Director of Indian Railway Companies) has read and entirely concurs in these remarks so far as they touch on the commercial aspects of the scheme. VI. The practicability of obtaining 50 per cent. —At the interdepartmental conference of 30th March Sir E. Grey had apparently no doubt of this, and he at once proceeded to prepare the ground with France and Russia. France.- —Sir E. Grey to Sir F. Bertie, No. 123, of 6th April 1911—“M. ( ambon . . . had told Count Benckendorft that the question as to “ whether France should participate in the Bagdad-Gulf section was one “ which concerned us alone. She would participate if we wished her to “ do so, but she did not regard it as her affair.” Russia.—Sir E. Grey to Sir G. Buchanan, No. 105, of 10th April 1911. Count Benckendorff said that . . . “the Russian desire was to help us, and therefore their proposal [i.e., to participate] would not hold if the question was one between us and Germany alone. He thought, however, that if it was ultimately decided to have French co-operation, Russia “ should come in too.” The India Office has no later information than this.Germany .—The India Office has not heard of any overtures to Germany on the subject. We know only that in 1909 M. Gwinner informed Sir E. Cassel that the Germans had no objection to Great Britain obtaining moie than 50 pel cent., and that it was from Hussein Hilmi that the opposition then came. Further, in 1911, Sir G. Lowther wrote (No. 183, of 22nd March) “ Prominent Germans here have recently been hinting that “ the Turks will have to accept any arrangement come to between Berlin and “ London . . . and that we perhaps could secure a more satisfactory “ arrangement by unofficial 'pourparlers with Germany.” He understood that the German Ambassador (Baron Marsehall), who was just going to Berlin, would speak in this sense. To these facts, which are all that are available, must be added the consideration, already mentioned, that it is in Germany’s interest that the Gulf section should be built, and she is therefore not likely to place unnecessary difficulties in the way of anyone who will find the money. It is, indeed, probable that she will ask a quid pro quo. Whether her demand will be excessive cannot be known until it is made. But it will doubtless be a matter for bargaining, and in any case it is a question whether it is not better to pay Germany for something that is worth having, than Turkey for something that is not. Turkey .—The Turkish attitude may possibly be hostile. For positive information w r e have only M. Gwinner’s statement quoted above. But it is known that Turkey is very suspicious of British designs in Mesopotamia, and she will doubtless prefer an international control because of the scope which it affords for the time-honoured policy of playing off the various Powers against one another. On the other hand, (1) it is strongly to her interest that the line should be built; (2) Sir G. Lowther in his Despatch No. 328, of 12th May 1911, has given reasons why she need not herself claim a large share ; (3) she will not necessarily be worse off if we obtain 50 per cent, than under her own proposal. She is content now to ask for 25 per cent., and our proposal will leave her to divide 50 per cent, with Germany on the best terms she can get. Nevertheless, let it be assumed that she will object. The considerations advanced above are intended to show that no harm will result if, as a consequence, the Bagdad-Basra Railway question is withdrawn from the present negotiations. It is submitted that His Majesty’s Government would have a very good case for withdrawing it. Their own attempts to find a solution will three times have failed, and it is not reasonable to expect them to go on making overtures to Turkey indefinitely. The Turkish repre sentatives, at the private conferences which preceded the official reply, made a great point of the fact that it wms to oblige Great Britain that Turkey had induced the Germans to renounce their rights. It will now be for His Majesty’s Government, while expressing thanks for this sign of good will, to regret that they do not see their way to accept the concession on the terms on which it is offered. We should say that we have shown our own goodwill by making three attempts to meet the Turkish wishes ; we will give a still further proof of it now by withdrawing all objections to the construction of the railway as far as Basra, by any one to whom they choose to entrust it, on the sole condition that they conclude with us a thoroughly satisfactory settlement on the Shat-el-Arab and in the Gulf (including Mohammera), in return for which we will further give them the increase of Customs duties.8 It is submitted that we may then fairly expect a full satisfaction of the demands made in the memorandum of 29th July 1911 without the necessity of contemplating any further concessions. But it is at least open to argument that the Turks will not carry their objection to the 50 per cent, arrangement to the point of letting the negotiations break down :— (1.) As has been urged above, it is important to them that the railway should be made. (2.) They know that, whatever may be the value to us of Turkish friend ship, the value to themselves of our friendship is much greater, and if brought gently but firmly up to the point, it is likely that they will think twice before sacrificing it. VII. The 'procedure to be adopted now.—Ii the above views, which are only a development of those expressed in India Office letters of 3rd and 29th March 1911, are accepted, the doubt arises whether it is worth while to press for the 50 per cent, at all; whether it is not better to abandon the railway altogether, and devote ourselves entirely to the river and the Gulf, on the lines suggested above. But if it be decided that an attempt should be made to secure 50 per cent., the next question is how. This is really a question for the Foreign Office. The India Office have suggested that we should go direct to the German Government, and the Board of Trade in their letter of 7th April 1911 recommended that a confidential conference should be held with the authorities of the Bagdad Railway as a preliminary to further negotiations with Turkey. If it is held to be impossible to go to Germany independently of Turkey, the only course is apparently to inform the Turks that their own proposals being quite inacceptable, we find ourselves unable to negotiate on the basis of the German declaration of 7th March 1911, but that if they choose to approach Germany with a view to modifying this declaration so as to give us 50 per cent, and the casting vote, we will use our good offices with Germany and be willing to discuss with her the terms of a settlement on those lines, on the understanding that Turkey concludes an entirely satisfactory arrange ment with us in the river and Gulf. VIII. The alternative .—It is necessary to consider the possibility that if we take either of the lines suggested, the Turks will break off the negotiations altogether, as regards both the railway and the Gulf. It is not 'thought likely, for the reasons suggested under head VI, that this wdll happen, though they may hint at it by way of bluff. But if they did, it would seem that we should be morally in a very strong position if we could come before the public and say. “We have made every effort to meet the Turks over the “ question of this railway, but without success. But we do not wish to block “it if we can get a settlement of vexatious questions in the Gulf. We have “accordingly offered them a free hand for the railway as far as Basra “ (beyond which, if it is ever made, it will never pay) and the increased “ customs duties in return for a recognition de jure of the position in the “ Gulf which we have held de facto for a century; and they have refused.” Our policy would then be the maintenance, by force if necessary, of that position. We should have to reckon with Turkish hostility both to ourselves\ / 9 and to the Sheikhs of Koweit and Mohammera. The kind of measures which we should take are indicated in the Government of India’s letter No. 24 of 15th February 1912' :i: ‘; and, if driven to it, we should declare a Protectorate over Koweit. The strength or weakness of our position would then depend largely on the state of our relations with Germany. But it would seem that Germany would have no ground for taking exception to our action if we could tell her that we had been (and still were) anxious to make an arrange ment with her, but had found the Turks so irreconcilable that they would not even accept the free hand for the railway which we had offered them. This contingency is mentioned merely for the sake of completeness. It is almost incredible that it should occur at a time when more than for many vears past Turkish interests clamour for the goodwill of Great Britain. Rear-Admiral Sir Edmond Slade has read and agrees with all the above remarks. A. H. India Office, 6th June 1912. APPENDIX. From Viceroy, 29th May 1912. Private. Your private telegram dated 25th instant. Bagdad Railway. From an Indian point of view there can be no possible doubt whatever as to relative advantages of the two proposals. We infinitely prefer the proposal for a 50 per cent, participation for ourselves in the Gulf section, leaving the remainder for disposal as Turkey may wish. We have always felt a ^O or 25 per cent, participation must necessarily involve a loss of prestige in regions adjoining Persian Gulf (see secret telegram of 23rd March 1911), and that it might possibly become necessary some day to give compensation to France and Russia elsewhere for their continued support of our interests in Mesopotamia. With a 50 per cent, share we can make practically sure against differentiation in rates. In considering all questions affecting Mesopotamia, it is advisable to bear in mind that the situation is a fluid one, and it is difficult to foresee what the position there may be in 20 years’ time. Careful as we should therefore be to do all in our power to consolidate our own position and to establish a lien for the future, we feel strongly that no concession in Mesopotamia or elsewhere should be permitted to weaken our position of predominance in the Gulf where we are able and should continue to be able to assert ourselves in maintaining it against all comers. * i.e., removal of Turkish light vessel, buoys, &amp;c. ; ejection of Turks from Bubiyan and El Katr (including El Bidaa) ; occupation of dao.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000391_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/10/60</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000365.0x000391</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/10/60</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>File 2764/1904 Pt 5 'Baghdad Railway: Anglo-Turkish negotiations; concessions proposed in respect of Kowait; negotations with Hakki Pasha in London; Anglo-Turkish agreement.'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1912/1914</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2017-03-30T09:35:56</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>1 volume (254 folios)</extent><extent>The papers are arranged in approximate chronological order from the rear to the front of the file.The subject 2764 (Bagdad Railway) consists of five volumes, IOR/L/PS/10/56-60.
