Dear Sir; During the next three or four weeks starting January 15, 1946, T#W.A. are sending a special chartered plane to Dhahran to pick up a number of Aramco, B.m.C* and C.B.I. personnel who have finished thoir tour of duty in Arabia. Until such time as refueling facilities are set up at Dhahran, it will be necessary to refuel this plane at Muharraq* My purpose in writing you at this time is to obtain permission for this special chartered T.W.A. plane to land at Muharraq where we subsequently hope to make arrangements with the R.A.jj'. for refueling privileges. Will you please advise me at your earliest convenience whether or not this special chartered T.W.A. plane may land at Bahrein. Thanking you, I am Yours respectfully, ARABIAN AMERICAN OIL CUM^Awi C.

Dear Sir: In addition to the especially chartered T.W.A. plane about which I wrote you in my letter No.PA-279 of today’s date, Aramco have a privately owned plane. This is a single engine job which can land on almost any smooth plot of ground. This plane will not require refueling since it is a small machine and we can easily take care of this detail on the mainland. My purpose in writing you about this privately owned plane is to ask permission to land it on Bahrein for emergency trips. It is possible that we may be able to land it on a runway close to the Awali Camp if we are able to find suitable ground. Would you please advise whether or not you have any objection to our making emergency flights to Bahrein with this plane whenever necessary.

Our Mr. Rodstrom wrote you January 12th requesting permission to land our small privately owned plane on Bahrein Island for emergency trips and you have requested clarification of this. ‘Miat we would like to do would oe to have permission to use this plane for trips of Management and key personnel back and forth between Bahrein in coordinating our work with our affil iate, Bahrein Petroleum Company. As you know, the use of the launch is time-consuming and our key men could save considerable time if it were permissible to use our privately owned plane for transporting them. We would not propose to make this a personnel carrier in the sense of any of our employes being permitted to use it who aesire to go to Bahrein, but would limit it strictly to official business trips of our top Management and Bahrein Petroleum’s top Management. If you would look favorably upon granting permission to us for its use, we would like to have Bahrein Petroleum Com pany locate a small landing strip near Awali for this purpose.

Political Resident, Bushire No. C/153. Dated the 9th of February, 1946 Reference correspondence ending with your telegram No.66,dated the 13th of January, 1946. 2. ARAMCO have requested permission for their small privately ovfned aeroplane to make trips to Bahrain for co ordination of work with their affiliate company - BAPCO. They wish to save time and inconvenience of launch trip for their own and top managerial staff of BAPCO and other important personages. They would not use the- »plane as an ordinary personnel carrier. They would wish to build a small landing strip at Awali. 3. As regards the flights: In view of the existence of the launch service to and from the mainland I see no objeotion and I should be grateful for early confirmation to wnich if received before the amendments to the Civil Air Agreement are completed, I would obtain His Highness* con sent. If received after the completion of the amendments this would not be necessary. 4. As regards the landing strip to be located in BAPCO area at Awali. It appears taoxn to me that BAPCO have the right under Article 4(b) of the Deed of Further Modifications to construct a landing strip if they think one necessary. Although they have not communicated with me on the subject of the strip officially I am aware that they do wish to co-operate with ARAMCO and probably would apply to me if permission were not accorded. In the circumstances I think the terms of the Civil Air Agreement apply and I should be grateful for confirmation that His Majesty*s Government have no objection. Sd./- A.C.

Galloway: Thank you very much for your letter of May 16th, in which you advised us you had no objection to the use of our pri vate aircraft for conveyance between Dhahran and Awali for key personnel of this Company and The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limi ted. As soon as the landing strip at Awali is completed, we will begin making flights. This privilege is very much appreciated, and I assure you that we will keep within the spirit of our agreement. More specifically, in accordance with your letter, we will be glad to comply with your conditions that: (a) Nothing will be brought to or taken from the Island which is subject to customs control, without authori zation of your Agency. (b) Passengers will be in possession of valid travel doc uments. By copy of this letter, we are advising The Bahrein Petroleum Company Limited of these conditions, and I know there will be no question as to their compliance. In answer to your question as to the type of aircraft we propose to use, at present we have only one plane in operation which could be landed on a small field. This plane is a Canadian- made Noorduyn 'Norseman”. It is a single-engine, high-wing mono plane, painted a brilliant red color, making it easily recognizable. ^ It has a seating capacity of six passengers for short flights. I &gt; ' believe this is the only plane of this type now in the Middle Bast area. In addition, we are at present negotiating for the purchase of some other type of small plane for local use. If and when ob tained, we will advise you of the type plane before using it in Dhahran-Awali flights.
