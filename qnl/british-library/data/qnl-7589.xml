October 24th 1887, Monday .—Paper No. 6 concludes with the return from Trans-Caspia to Baku. The steamer Czarewitch Alexander left Asunada a day late because she had missed a day at Petrofsk on her outward trip from Astrakhan and had carried the delay all round her course, arriving at Baku on Monday morning at 7 instead of 6 a.m. on Sunday (vide Table I, Paper No. 6 A., Meshedessa line). The mail for Persia had started from Baku about 6 hours previously Table III, Paper No. 6 A., Enselli Line), and there was every prospect of a week's delay. The quickest way to get to Persia appeared to be in recrossing tlie Caspian by the boat for Asunada at 2 p.m. (Table I, Paper No. 6 A), and so reaching Meshedessa by Thursday the 27th. This not only required a telegram to Teheran to send the servant from Enselli to meet me if possible at Meshe dessa, a trip of some 200 miles, which in all probability could not be done in the time, but also a special permission from the authorities at Tiflis to recross the Caspian. The difficulty was solved by a fellow passenger (Manager for some time of the “ Caucase-Mercurie,” and now running another line), who ascertained that a small steamer was at a quay lower down, getting ready to start at 10 a.m. for Enselli. The baggage was soon transferred, and the short interval available was use fully occupied in recovering my photographs and purchasing others, breakfast ing, purchasing provisions, telegraphing to Ealing, Tiflis and Teheran, money changing, &amp;c. The correspondent of the “lettre dedication” (no object in mentioning names) was not out of bed, but after a while he appeared and returned the 25 sove reigns left in deposit on 25th September. He also said he had given too good a rate of exchange for the circular notes at our first interview, and this was settled there and then by returning 3 roubles to adjust the account. Money-changing was another matter. This was done at an Armenian bureau on the quay, and the name of the agent was said to be “ Guzzis. ” Eor 133 roubles in paper he gave 391 kraus in Persian money, which, according to a rough table (11 paper roubles = £1 = 33 krans and therefore 1 rouble = 3 krans) should have been 399. On this he cleared 8 krans or say 2 per cent. Now for the sovereigns, what is the exchange? The exchange for one English pound is 10'90 roubles. Here, then, are 10 sovereigns or 109 roubles, and for these at the rate of the first tran saction (133 roubles=391 krans) the exchange will be 320 krans. Quite true, but the figures will be 309 only, as 1 do not want sovereigns in gold ! I parted, wishing like the man in Punch that I had only “ half his complaint. ” On the Second transaction he probably cleared 14 krans, or 4J per cent. Expenses £ 6-16-0. Tips £ 1 . At present it is incomprehensible how this “ roubley ” paper commands a bet ter price than foreign gold, and furthermore what is to prevent Russia from issu ing paper which may depreciate more than the rupee*, and, “ flying kites ” to any extent she chooses within her own lands (one-sixth of the territorial surface of the globe), where silver is rarely seen and where gold never circulates. All aboard and ship^ a sailing ! After many messages of kind recollection by Monsieur Rodziewitch, who was about to return to Trans-Caspia, and after farewells in which Tamamshef affectionately embraced and kissed me, the little tub of a steamer cast off, and by 10 J a.m. she was puffing and panting at about four miles an hour through the oil-stained waters of the bay. The “ Euphrate ” may have been 60 tons, under a Persian commander, with a Persian crew and flying a Persian flag of the Lion and the Sun.f Of the crew * Wood, in “The Shores of Lake Aral ” converts the rouble at half a crown in 1876. Now thfc rate is one shilling and ten pence. f The treaty of Turkomantchai permits no boat to fly the Persian flag on the Caspian. A2 two mates were Russian. There was a fairly large saloon for the better class of natives and their wives, with a small cabin beyond which was allotted to me, and beyond this again was the captain’s crib in which he kept his money, &amp;c. There was a party of Persian gentlemen returning from a pilgrimage and about 60 deck passengers. My fare was fixed at 9 roubles on account of the cabin (the ordinary fare by mail steamer is 12 roubles). Deck passengers paid 3 roubles each from Baku to Enselli, and all found their own food. Luggage was 15 kopecks a pood. The steamer carried sugar, glass, coals, iron, &amp;c. The barometer at sea south of Baku stood at 786‘2 = BO' QdS. The sea was very rough at night, the steamer rolling a good deal. Anchored and rolled more. 25th October, Tuesday .—The crew began to wake up about 7, and after a lazy start at 8 anchored again at 9^ a.m. off Lenkoran. Russia numbers about 120,000 Persians in the Caucasus as her subjects, chiefly in these districts on the Caspian, and in Erivan, which was annexed in 1828. The scenery, as far as one could see on a dull morning, was not unlike that near Tanna, with wooded foreshore, and wooded hills behind. Some isolated Mils mid way, thatched houses and a few red zinc roofs. One native steamer and a few native boats in the roadstead. No business was done at Lenkoran, and after a fashionable delay a start was made for Astara, whence, after another expendi ture of time, the steamer set out at 8 p.m. for Enselli. The cultivation of Indian rice is steadily pursued in the low marshy lands in this vicinity. 26th October, WednesdayA.YYivzdL at Enselli at 7 a.m., and anchored in an open roadstead about a mile from the shore with the mail steamer to the north and outside us. Shortly the boats (not unlike the Madras surf boats, but smaller) came off for passengers, but no one appeared inclined to move. Fortu nately the sea was fairly calm and there was no “ beaching.” One or two “surfy *’ waves seemed as if they would envelope us, but these passed, and after a short turn through the neck of an inlet a landing was made at a small quay in the bazar. I gave the boatman 2 double kran-pieces (2s. 6 tf.). “ This will not do. I want 10 tomans” (say £3). Others wanted nearly as much for touching my baggage. Presently, by strange good luck, a Persian asked my name and said that 0 a Mirza had been enquiring for me for some days, and that he was probably now here. The Mirza (educated person) w T as found about to return comfort ably by the steam launch to Piri Bazar, as he had satisfied himself I was not a passenger by the mail which had arrived the previous evening, nor had he made any enquiry about the steamer which had arrived that morning. The kit with out any examination by custonlS , officials was transferred to the launch; the boatman accepted an additional 2-kran piece, and at 9 a.m,, under charge of a Persian, the little launch started on its trip across the lake (local Dead Sea) towards Piri Bazar. My first impression of the Persians, as represented by these boatmen, was not favourable. Tickets £1-1-0. Tips £0-11-0. At Enselli the chief object is a garden tower 5 storeys high, built when the Shah made his first trip to Europe. The bazar is good, but small; there is the Telegraph office and a Russian fish-curing establishment. Sitting on the side of the boat I chatted with the young Mirza; he is one of Dr. Bruce’s converts, by name Joseph, and earns a living by teaching French in Resht. He had, on a request from Teheran, been asked by the Postmaster of Resht to meet me, and this ivas his third visit for the purpose. The launch carried about 15 passengers, and the trip across the smooth water for 10 miles till lO^- a.m. was very pleasant. At the western side of the lake a change is made into tow boats which carry the traffic up the inlet to Piri bazar. The stillness of the air, the grateful shade, the easy gliding through the water—all embodied the poetry of motion, and one felt rather sorry, when about noon there was another change to the racket and the avarice of the horse- keepers. The fare for the steam and boat trip of 15 miles was 2 krans (1st Class.) Mirza Joseph was travelling without a ticket, so I bought him one for 1 kran. The road to Resht is under repair,—part is cobbled and part is untouched. The kit was given to a syce who put it on his horse, and rode off with it. It was raining, and there was nothing much to be seen—a few houses and gardens,3 dirty streets, and then a bazar with open shops and projecting roofs, not unlike a scene at Mangalore. Drove to the Eussian Consulate on a kind invitation from Madame Ylassow. She is English, having been married three times, once to Captain FitzRoy, by whom she has two sons (in Australia), and one daughter (now living here), secondly to a Russian, and thirdly to Monsieur Vlassow. Mr. and Mrs. Nelson (Telegraph) and their children, and Miss Pratt (sister of the American Minister), were also the guests of Monsieur Ylassow. They had left Baku before me by the regular mail boat, had a dreadful passage, landed at Enselli, spent the night on the floor of the Shah’s garden tower, missed the launch, and finally arrived after me at Resht late in the afternoon. Monsieur Ylassow is a Cossack of the Don, and one of a very few of that race who have entered the diplomatic service. The payment in Russian currency ceased on board the steamer, and the use of Persian money began on landing. As regards Persian currency. First of all in copper there are— ■| Shahi pieces called ‘ pool 5 ... ft' diameter. and in silver-— Irregularly shaped dubs and also— 1 kran piece diameter 9 1 a' a &gt;J &gt;) -*-8 55 . 1 ' I 3 ' -MG = i kran ) ., j- old coinage. : : } new coinage. These last are rather pretty, having the lion on one side with a drawn sword erect in the right paw extended, and a woman’s face illumined as the sun orient over his back, all enclosed in a wreath. On the reverse there are Persian characters in a wreath. The computation is— 1 pool = shahi . . . . = -181 of a penny. 40 half shahis = 20 shahis = 1 kran = = 7 ' 2 f pence. 10 krans = 1 toman = say 6 s 6d. Therefore, roughly, in one’s dealings as an Indian traveller, the single kran ( 7 J^.) may be treated as an 8 -anna piece (S^d.) and the 2 -kran piece (Is. 2^d.) as a rupee (Is.-od), but with a tendency to be more liberal with the double kran pieces than with rupees. 27th October, Thursday. —The day, although it poured with rain, was spent in great contentment, Monsieur Vlassow kindly arranging for my journey ; he engaged a Persian, by name Nasr-ullah, to go with me to Bushire : gave the man 50 krans and took receipt. I am also to pay at Bushire for his return 1 kran per farsakh for a horse, and \ kran a day for food, so that the charge for this servant will be 50 for himself, 260 for the horse, 22 for food, or 332 krans in all, an equivalent to £10 for which the man will have to leave his home for two months, and traverse nearly 2,000 miles on horseback. A native sad dle and bridle was purchased for 25 krans for the servant, and these were to be presented to him at Bushire if he behaved himself. A telegram was sent in Persian to Major Wells at Teheran, acquainting him with my movements for 4^ krans. The Padoroshna or Post Office permit was obtained, the charge being 1 kran, and 3 horses were ordered to be ready to start from the Consulate at 4 the following morning. The preliminaries being so far complete, there only remained the Mirza Having consulted the Consul, 20 krans was thought ample as remuneration for his services. The Mirza came to call, smoked his cigarette, and when I pro posed to make him a small present for his trouble, he replied that he only wanted his actual expenses which amounted to 45 krans. 1 did not laugh, but wished him good-bye, saying the money would be ready for him in a short time. He never returned, so the amount was left with the Consul. From experience No. 2 I do not think a converted Persian is either fish, flesh, fowl or good salt herring. In the idea that these notes may be of some practical use, and as progress will now be made on horseback, it may be advisable here to insert a few hints regarding the personnel of travel, baggage, &amp;c. A 24 First of all, before entering upon any expedition, a certain amount of con sideration must be given to the locality to be visited and to the duration of the trip. In this case, the range was from London to Bombay, an “ easting ” from 0° to 73° or 5,048 miles, and a “ southing ” from 51|° to 19° or 2,342 miles, for the most part overland and through countries which I had not previously visited. The time—two to three months from the middle of September. Fortunately I had travelled in Austria and Turkey, so framed an idea of what might be required in West and South Russia. Turkey in Asia was taken as a clue to the Caucasus : Central Asia, like Egypt, Sind and the Funjab, while Persia was pictured as a mixture of Palestine, Syria and Afghanistan. Firstly as to baggage—i\\z detail of which is given on paper No. 7E. It consisted of the clothes in wear when leaving England on 14th September— two Gladstone bags together weighing with contents 701b, a hand-bag 31b, a canvas sack weighing 301b, a bundle of rugs 181b, or a total for the four articles of 12 libs, all told, and if to these is added a light silk feather pillow^ bought at Kiev, a pair of kurjins and some light clothes at Tiflis and extra provisions at Teheran, the total weight will be 1401b. This was quite sufficient for 85 days, and contained all the appliances for a bath or a meal whenever there was leisure to partake of them. The principle followed was that there should be suitable clothes for dif ferent occasions. In the first place a dress suit is always necessary everywhere ; to this, as occasion demands, may be added the medals, a good suit for visit ing during the day, an ordinary touring suit, a properly made riding suit, and some lighter clothes for warm weather. A few remarks may now r be given on the different items, viz .— In List No. 6. —The leather waist-coat is an old friend, its worth was fully acknowledged in “ Kandahar in 1879,’* since then it has been cleaned and re lined and is still as good as new ; it is made to order of what is called “ game keeper’s leather,” large, covering the hips and loins, spacious arm holes and the leather carried right round the back. With such a waist-coat one hardly ever experiences cold in the body. As regards boots—after considerable hesita tion the list was cut down to one pair, with a pair of patent leather Oxford shoes and a pair of slippers. To meet all requirements the pair were ankle boots with spring sides, spur-boxes, and single soles. They answered very well, the only objection to the pattern being the difficulty in pulling them on in the cold mornings. If one has to depend on a single pair, this style still seems to me to have the least defects. The Terai hat with a double top and single brim was quite sufficient for all purposes, supplemented at times with two silk handkerchiefs in the crown, and a pagri outside. Note-books may be small and thin (say 6 ' X 3' ) with about 40 sheets, all lined and crossed into small squares. In List No. 1. —The large sleeping socks are more like bags, and meant as a protection from fleas ; these and a free use of insect powder are necessary. The light coat and waist-coat were for use on boardship. Riding breeches with gaiters to match can only be made by an expert, and if they are properly fitted before starting a rider will never lose leather or cut under the knee. If ordinary breeches are used, a boy’s knee straps must be worn in addition. The wickered flask for cold tea was useless ; and it might have been omitted. The veil was not used. The revolver was not fired, and only worn once, be cause of a ‘ lion in the path* at Pirizan. It is however an essential accessory. In List No. 2. —The filter was only once used at Khoja Doulaton the road to Bokhara, and then there was no time to wait for the result. Fraser’s Etna is small and very good, it carries a case for methylated spirits, and will cook a cup of soup or tea in a few minutes. In List No. 3. —The cone of menthol was useful for natives who demanded cures; the effect in a few seconds after application was quite “charming. ” The small bag No. 3 is carried on the saddle by coupling straps from the side D’s.5 In No. 4 .—The saddle should he of full size with plenty of D’s. and coupling straps to each. Holsters, not the present pattern, but the old pattern saddle bags of 1855, all of flexible leather and without the circular pieces at top and bottom. In one pocket goes the pillow and in the other the Ram- pore chudder. If a pistol is carried on a long ride, the holster must be of a different pattern and stiff leather. The bed sack—a hint from Dr. Bruce, and worth ten times its weight in gold. My pattern sack is merely a bag of brown holland, 6 | feet long, 2 ^ feet wide, opening at the foot. A smaller bag, IJfeet long, opening at the side, is sewn on to the top for a pillow. In Persia chopped straw is given as forage for horses, and can be obtained everywhere. The bags are filled with this provender, the pillow piece is folded over and the couch is ready. The provisions consisted of 2tb of soups in sausage form, 2 boxes of meat lozenges and 66 (Jtb) packets of compressed tea, with the addition at Teheran of some sardines, biscuits, and cocoa. Powls and bread with an occa sional cabbage being obtainable on the road. List No. 5 .—If the wraps are not sufficient you must go to bed with your clothes on. Secondly the country to be traversed .—The best idea will be gained by examining the Plan (Paper 7A), the Table (Paper 7B) and the Section (Paper 7C). The Plan and the Section speak for themselves, but there are no roads, excepting perhaps the rough preparations between Piribazar and Rustomabad, the cleared width from Kasvin to Teheran, and the stone stair-cases south of Shiraz. The country is shut in and the difficulties of approach from certainly 3 sides may to a great extent account for its comparative obscurity. The fact also that Persians are Shias while their neighbours are Sunis may also have tended to exclusiveness. A few words in explanation of the Table (Paper No. 7 B) may be requisite. In the first column are the stations by name with principal post-stages in italics. In columns II, III, IY are the distances about which in Persia there is always a difference of opinion, partly owing to the old measure which once established is not changed according “ to the law of the Medes and Persians which altereth not,’’ partly to the variations in local computation according to the ease or reverse with which any particular stage may have been accomplished, and partly to the disinclination to accept any correction which later investigation has shown to be expedient. The Persian measure of distance—the farsakh—is said to be the old parasang which was put as equivalent to 3^ geographical miles, and consequently rather in excess of 4 statute miles. But as there are only 18*44 Persian farsakhs to a degree, the true value of each farsakh is (i|^) equal to 3f English statute miles. This value will be accepted, and it also meets one of the local definitions of a farsakh, viz., fhat it represents the distance which a loaded mule will, according to the country, walk in an hour. Naturally therefore the farsakh is a very variable quantity .—vide the figures opposite Pachinar and Kasvin, where the staging distances are 5 farsakhs for each, while the local estimates are 16 and 32 miles, and the map gives 13 and 21 miles, respectively. Moreover, the number of farsakhs in a stage is generally supposed to be fixed by the contractor who supplies the horses ; this being so it is a wonder the distances are even approximately correct. In column Y the length of the journeys are given, but these can be varied at the pleasure of the traveller within certain conditions. No horses available at Mesreh, would mean a halt for the night in a poky room in a very small village. An extra horse sent back from Kasvin might mean a night in the open. Again, the ordinary stages end at Bideshk and Ispahan, but my rest was taken under the genial shelter afforded by the MacGowans at Soh and Dr. Hoernle at Julfa. One may be benighted at Shulgistan and not be able to make Abadeh. Persepolis also requires a halt at Poozeh, where the accommo dation is most limited. A day’s journey may be as long or as short as you like ; in my case the Telegraph Department received and took care of me, passing me on from one to the other with all the interest, warmth and hospitality of old friends. The hours on the journey (column YI) give, roughly, the time in the saddle under ordinary circumstances. Each one according to his weight andagility and the condition of the nag that carries him will progress differently. Anyhow, for heavy men a ride of 50 miles on 2 nags from Teheran to Pik, in cluding a somersault, horse and all, near Robat Kearim in 10 hours, is fair. Pifty-seven miles with a second fall near Sinsin on 3 nags in the same time is also fair; while 78 miles on 4 nags in 12 hours makes a fair average of 6 ^ miles an hour right through. The longest stage on one horse was 29 miles, but there are others of 28, 27, 24, &amp;c., and for staging in any country these distances are too long. Many of the nags were in poor condition, and for the most part with sore-backs making riding rather a ricketty performance parti cularly at the outset and at the finish of each stage. But in travelling, it is these little inconveniences which, like fleas in a dog, afford something to think of. Column VII gives the height above the sea of different stations ; there is a steep approach from both seas to what may he called the elevated plateau of Persia; but from Kashan southwards to the Gulf the soldiers’ remark on the march in Abyssinia will aptly apply—“ If this is what they call a table-land, we can only be moving up and down the legs.” Take from Pachinar to Mesreh a simple rise of 7,000 feet straight on end in 20 miles. Kashan to Kohrud is another ascending ride, while from Shiraz to Daliki it is so up and down that mules are in use instead of horses. Column VIII gives the prices payable to the contractors with the recog nised fees. Column IX gives the extras which not only represent the trail of the traveller, but the circumstance which travels with him and helps to pave the way. The amount however is very small, but it should not on any account be omitted, for it is distinctly a boon to poor men; if given openly it will pro bably be appropriated by the chapparchi or headman as his perquisite. Column X gives the nature of the conveyance. There was a small carriage for one horse between Resht and Kodoom. There are carriages with three horses from Kasvin to Teheran. The spring phaeton which I failed to recog nise before I saw it, by its local name of “Pitoon,” was in such a critical state with its drooping springs, that it was rejected for the Tarantass, a Russian carriage without springs. Travelling in Persia, a country very much as nature left it, is therefore generally on horseback, “ chapparing,” i.e., riding light, and as fast as you can for three or more stages daily, or “ caravaningwhen you proceed more leisurely by one stage a day with baggage mules. The charge for “ chap- paring ” is one kran per farsakh per horse, or rather less than two pence a mile for each horse, and the rate for “ caravaning ” is probably the same for each mule. The first thing necessary is to secure the pndoroshna or Post Office permit for the horses. This paper (for which there is either a fee or for which you are supposed to pay a small present) gives the route, the stages and the number of bor es required and the price to be paid at each stage. Payment usuallv is made at the end of each stage when the nags for the next stage are brought out ready saddled. The trade of Enselli and Resht with Russia has increased fourfold since transit dues were levied on foreign merchandise via Caucasus. Foreign (not Russian) trade comes by Erzeroum, &amp;c., and takes longer, but this route necessi tates entry through a Turkish port (Trebizond) and transit through foreign terri tory. Russia sends immense quantities of sugar, piece-goods, silks, &amp;c., and no English goods are obtainable. Samples of English piece-goods were bought up and copied at Moscow for the trade with Persia.* Rock-salt in bazar from Chelikan Island. Revenue of Ghilan is paid to the Shah chiefly from rice and silk. Mulberry-trees growing everywhere ; the Shah farms each province out to a Governor. The Governors have full Civil, Military, Administrative and Judicial pow r ers, and these are exercised directly by local Subordinates in the position of Governors of towns, Mayors, Superintendents of Police, and Chiefs of Districts. I understood that 3 million krans or £7,500 was the price at which Ghilan was let. Forty years ago the product of raw silk was over 500 * Consul General Abbott says howevei - that in Khorassan a decided preference is given to prints manu factured at Manchester.7 tons; in 1874, it had dropped to 300 tons, and two years later being a bad year, the outturn was only 10 tons. The public sales of silk which formerly realized 7 millions sterling, now only touch £150,000. The annual product of Persian silk is now only one-seventh of what it was in the middle of the 17th cen tury. The average price is three times greater than it was then, but only one- fourth of what it was when the English held the silk monopoly of Ghilan. In the coast districts the silk is collected in May. Under the influence which Russia possesses, great endeavours will he made to restore this industry to something like its former magnitude. Fraser in 1882 stated that the average silk production of Ghilan was £730,000 a year, of which one-third was con sumed locally, one-third by Russia' and one-third by Turkey.* All the coast district north of Elburz range is said to be carboniferous. Ghilan and Mazandaran correspond with the ancient Hyrcania.f 28th October, Friday. — Woke at 3 a.m. ; heavy rain, breakfasted with Mon sieur Ylassow, and all ready by 4, the hour at which the horses were ordered. Started at 6 a.m., in heavy rain. The guide and the servant with the kit on horseback, while the carriage took me the first stage to Kodoom by 10 a.m. The road was fairly good (Photograph No. 7F), cobbled in some places, and staked and bound at the sides. The scenery is not unlike that in the Concan. At Kodoom began the first real ride when the party was tout d fait com- plet with 3 nags. One horse, generally the best, has a pack or post saddle of stuffed felt and straw for the guide or djiggit chappar; he takes the two Glad stone bags in the large kurjin with the shawl, and his load will be about 2441b in all. The second is for the servant or courier with a native bridle and 2 or 3 folds of numdah under the native saddle ; his own kit and the provisions in the small kurjin will be about 1861b. The third nag, a shaky looking beast, but declared to be fast, sure footed, “ the pride of the stable,” is for the master. His load, with ulster, saddle, holsters, small bag, &amp;c., will be 2201b. Between Kodoom and Rustemabad road begins to ascend. Heavy rain. Mules, donkeys, camels, crowds, and the road infernal; all up and down crossing every nose and promontory that ran into the river (Safed). My grey gave in and fell on his knees, so changed with Nasr-ullah; the valley is prettily wooded, but the rain is so heavy that very little can be seen. At Rustemabad the forests end. Secured a nice chestnut galloway and rode him to Menzil in 5 hours. The route follows a gorge and is continually going up or down. Three arches of the bridge at Menzil washed away ; a tem porary bridge built (see Photograph No. 7G). The Valley of the Winds. If your horse does not tumble through the sticks, he will probably be blown over with his rider. Arrived at the chapparkhanah at 9 p.m. Went into a nice room up stairs furnished with tables and chairs. Made some soup and turned in. 29th October, Saturday. —From Menzil the road ascends along the right b^nk of the Shahrud. Arrived at Pachinar at 9-30 a.m. Valley much more open. Hills very fine and of varied colours. Heavy clouds after the storm. The road is up hill almost the whole way, and the view of the plains of Persia from just above Mesreh 8,000, at Kasran, is good ; Kasvin discernible. Arrived at Mesreh at 2-30 p.m. No horses in the chapparkhana, so shall have to ride the same horses on. Started at 5 p.m., lovely moonlight, and rode on. Very good going all the way. At Agababa the servant’s horse gave in, and at last land the guide w 7 ent on, arranging to send a horse back from Kasvin. Got to Kasvin at 10 p.m., city gates locked, got through, rode on to chapparkhana, a large building in a garden in the middle of a great avenue. Flowers, bushes and water with large stable for horses. Made tea and went to hed. Nusr-ullah came in at 2 a.m. 30th October, Sunday. —Kasvin (40,000) is said to have been founded by Shapur, the conqueror of Valerian. It was the capital for about 40 years before the principal seat of government was transferred to Ispahan in 1586 (see Pho tograph No. 7 H). Hills to the north snowcladhere and there (see Photograph No. 7 J), also a range to the south. The Shimran is a part of the Elburz range * For some interesting particulars of this silk trade, read Benjamin, pages 414—422. f Plutarch says that when Alexander passed into Hyrcania with the flower of his army he took a view of the Caspian sea, which appeared to him not less than the Euxine, but its water was of a sweeter taste.8 connecting the Hindoo-Khoosh with the Caucasus. Kasvin is famous for its Mesdied Diami, built by Haroun-al-ttaschid, the grave of Houssem and its Mesdjed-i-Shah. To the north, at the foot of Mount Syala, are the ruins ot the principal seat of the Assassins or Nabatheniens. All round about Kasvin are field of vines legularly walled in. The road, which is unique in Persia, is simply a width cleared of stones, and yet it is said to have cost £640 a mile. It begins about 8 miles west of Kasvin, is unbridged, is crossed by streams and irrigating channels and ends at leheran. The natural surface is hard and it is good going both for horses and carriages. Reached the first halt at 9-30 and the second at 12, and the last post before Teheran at 9 p m. Here every one declared it would be impossible to reach Teheran before the gates were closed, and as I had no intention of wandering about a, city in the dark searching for my friends, I agreed to halt. The rooms were fairly clean, and the food good. Beds with sheets, blankets and razais ; wash-stand, look ing-glass, brush and comb, soap, tooth-brush, pens, ink and paper, and always a mao-nifyino’ o*lass. The rest-houses along this line into Teheran are said to be of the first class, because it is by this route all high officials from Europe travel. The servant N asr-ullah very done up ; in fact it is a wonder he has done so well. 3Ut October, Monday .—Started early for Teheran, and by 8 a.m w'as at early breakfast with Wells and his wife just as a matter of course. Called on Mr Nicolsop, who was officiating as British Minister; called on the Minister of Science, and also on the Eirst Chamberlain. These officials were very friendly ; their houses contained many rooms luxuriously furnished; many servants. Refreshments consisted ‘first of pipes with tea. and then pipes with coffee. Then saw Dr. Odling and visited the Telegraph offices. Out for a walk in the evening, and not at all disinclined to enjoy the few days’ rest which the Doctor recommends as necessary. He applied some strong iodine to my back, to count eract the effects of the fall I had from my horse in Bokhara 16 days ago. Transit as per Paper 7B, £7-10 0. Expenses £4-10-0. Tips £0-7-0. 1st November, ZWsday.—Called on Mr. and Mrs. Nicolson. Dr. Tholosan, the Phvsician to the Shah, called on me, also the old Nawab of ikicot. Called on Prince Dolgorouki, who desired his kindest remembrances to Lord Dufferin. Called on Yahia Khan the Mouchir-ul-Dowlah, Ex-Minister for Foreign Adairs, lately deprived of his post on Ayub Khan’s escape. His rooms were magnifi cently furnished with Sevres China, real China, carpets, pictures, &amp;c.; one room was positively lined with silvered plate glass, covered with most elegant tracery of flowers, &amp;c., in plaster of Paris. Persian Art is decorative; all material is ob tained locally and adapted to this purpose; stone, wood, plaster of Paris, cotton for carpets, wool for felts, clay for pottery, &amp;c. All decorations are done without anv o'uide or pattern, and the workman follows his own inclinations. Domes, windows or arches are the principal features of every structure. (See Photograph 7K.) Large dinner party at the Residency; about 30 people, members of the different embassies. After dinner there was dancing, 4 or 5 gentlemen dancing in turn with the same lady during one dance. At parting some of the foreigners kissed the hand of the hostess—a very graceful and courteous compliment. 2nd November, Wednesday.—Busy writing letters. Prepared a memoran dum on the Trans-Caspian Railway and gave it to Mr. Nicolson; he said he should forward a copy to England and to the Viceroy. It is better that this should be done, for I may lose my note-book, and a hundred and one things may happen before I arrive in India.. Prince Dolgorouki called ; also the Colonel of Russian Cossacks (Dimontovitch ?). Went for a walk along the rampaits,- huge mounds of earth taken from a very deep ditch. Dined at Dr. Odling s, and there met Dr. and Mrs. Torrens of the American Mission. 3rd November, Thursday .—Visited, the Telegraph offices ; preparing notes for my route. Lunched with Captain Blumer of the Russian service, who is engaged to drill the Persians as gunners and Cossacks. Visited the Mouchir s garden and palace, and also a large mosque, “ Nassiri, that he is building to the memory of his brother. The design is excellent and very bold, while the construction seemed to be sound. If Persians can design and complete works of this sort they are capable of still greater things. The entrance porticos aie9 splendid; the colonnades and vaulted passages are well designed, and the recesses are beautifully adorned with tile work in miniature, similar to Mosaic. The building includes a tomb, a mosque, a college and a caravanserai, and there is nothing paltry, meagre or mean either in the conception of the design or the execution of the structure. The tile work of Persia is a study in itself, and a reflet tile has an effect of “ matchless chromatic splendour, ” “ a combination of gold and iridescent hues playing around azure letters,\which in high relief repro duce the Koran.” Visited some gardens, saw frescoes in summer houses, Patch Ali Shah’s Palace, &amp;c. Dinner party, at which the Turkish Ambassador was present. 4th November, Friday .—Writing English letters for the mail bag. Received a very nice letter from Mr. Nieolson; he says my memorandum will go to-day. Breakfasted with Prince Dolgorouki, meeting the different officers of the Russian Embassy. Visited some gardens of the Shah, where he has a big palace for himself and 17 smaller ones for his wives ranged in an arc round a lake. This may seem excessive, but it is nothing like the number maintained by Patch Ali his grandfather, who had 700 wives and 600 children. The Shah consequently has many poor relatives who have to be provided for in one way or another. Dinner party, at which I met the Odlings and Mirza Hassan Ali Khan, whom I had known at Kandahar as an Assistant Political. Bought some photographs. 5th November, Saturday .—Changed 18 sovereigns and received 603 krans old money in exchange. Two krans were deducted for converting into new money, the exchange being 1£=33^ krans. Visited Doshantepe and the menagerie of lions, tigers and monkeys. The lions were in good condition, and had fairly thick manes. Persia offers a fair field for sportsmen ; there are ibex in the hills; gazelle and wild ass in the plains, tigers towards the Caspian, and lions round about Pars. Called on Dr. Tholosan; he gave me one or two of his pamphlets. 5th November, Sunday.—T)mxe out with the intention of visitingGulahek— a summer resort at foot of Shimran, but was detained wandering about some gardens. Gulahek and Zergandeh are villages presented by the Shah to the English and Russian legations. Lunched with the Nicolsons. Dinner party, and met Mirza Hassan Ali Khan and Mr. Wood. All arrangements for a start southward to-morrow ready. The Police in Teheran are under an Italian, Count Montifiore. On a hurried journey like the present it is not possible to note down more than the bare outline of the chief experiences of the day where a word is some times sufficient to recall a scene and a single sentence to embody the subject of an agreeable study. Before proceeding, then, with the journey, a few words will be inserted on Teheran and Persia generally. Teheran is said to have been founded in the 16th century, and to have been established as the capital in 1795 by Agba Mahomed Khan, the founder of the Kadjar dynasty. Since then three only have succeeded to the throne, viz., Pateh Ali (1797-1831), Mahommed (1834-1848), and Nasir-ed-Din (born 1829), the present ruler. The city is situated on a large open plain sloping to the south. It is over looked from the North by the snowy range of Shimran mountains and the isola ted peak of Demavend, (see Photograph No. 7 R) which rises to a height of over 19,000 feet above the sea. The town is encircled by broad ramparts of earth excavated from a ditch in front. The suburbs are enclosed within a second wall. There are 12 gates in the enceinte and the population is said to exceed 150,000. (See Photograph No. 7 L.) Notwithstanding the advantage of its position and its height (3,810') above the sea, there is a general migration in summer to the lower slopes of the hills, 0 w ino’ to the heat and insalubrity of the place. The climate is said to be very dry ,0 the average rainfall is about T, and the temperature m summer ranges from 95 ° to 110 ° in the shade; small-pox and scarlet fever are the chief ailments. It is said that the extended cultivation of the hill slopes where people congregate for the summer has lowered the temperature of Teheran atleast 10 °, and that rain now lasts longer into the spring and showers are more frequent in early summer. Teheran (100,000) may be called a city of unknown enclosures. There is of course the palace, the arsenal, the barracks, &amp;c., &amp;c., but for the most part the dwellings are secluded and shut off, each with its gardens and buildings within high mud walls. The town is supplied with water brought in by some 30 or 40 underground canals from the snow-fed springs at the foot of the hills. These canals or kanats are works requiring great industry; some at their source are as deep as ISO' and the water is conducted in a tunnel under ground for miles till it comes to the surface. Shafts for ventilation and for the excavated mate rial occur at about 100 feet. The gardens are, to a great extent, private property, and although they are beautifully kept, with fountains and running water in abundance, they are too precise in their long avenues of plane-trees, and singularly devoid of bird or in sect life. (See Photograph 7 M.) The general places of resort are, of course, the bazar and the large squares, but here again at certain hours of the day one might be in a city of the dead. The year in Persia begins with the vernal equinox and the day is counted from sunset to sunset. I did not see the Shah—a visit to the Palace is a matter requiring a little time and arrangement. The Sovereign is constantly going off on shooting expeditions^ or visiting his country seats, a very natural process, when it is re membered that there are representatives, ministers and ambassadors from many nations located at his capital, viz.^ the Russian and English legations, the Turkish Embassy, and the French, Austrian, United State&amp;and German lega tions established in the order as given. The Shah is spoken of as a benevolent ruler, and one who, in a quiet way, has done much to improve his charge. He builds caravanserais, improves the water-supply, gives freely in charity, and has allowed the introduction of gas, cafes and a hotel into Teheran. He keeps a watch over his ministers, for occasionally he deposes one; and if he does not devote large sums to public works, it is more from the knowledge that the money wdll not be used for the purpose, than from the wish to retain it. Being an oriental, it is but natural that he should wish strangers to leave him alone; but however much England may pay consideration to this point, and earn a more genuine confidence, it will not prevent Russia from pressing claims and securing tangible advantages. That Russia has an ex traordinary influence in Persia has been generally acknowledged, and very lately the Russian authorities have, under some treaty, literally forced the Shah, against his will, to commence the construction of a road within his own territory from Meshed to Kubashan (Kuchan) to meet the section that they are making to that point from Askabad beyond the province. The Palace is separated from the arsenal by the Maidan-i-topkhana, (see Photograph 7 N) which may be called the centre and principal square in the City. Near here is another maidan where troops are drilled daily, except Fri days, and where the military bands occasionally play. The principal streets are fairly w^ell kept, water is laid on, and in addition every house nearly has reservoirs under ground for so many days* supply. Drains also exist; they run down the centre of the roads, and are constantly under repair. Dogs abound, and are nearly as numerous as at Constantinople. The bazar is away to the south of the Maidan-i-topkhana, a perfect maze of vaulted labyrinths, where caste or trade by families palpably exists, in the fact of each separate industry being localised in its particular range. Near Teheran is the ancient city of Rhages, Rhei, or Rhe (Tobit I, 14) the capital of the Arsacidm or Parthian dynasty; the sun-dried bricks here are supposed to be over 1,200 years old. The great place of pilgrimage is to the Tomb of Shah Abdul Azeem, about 6 miles from Teheran, and to which place some 300,000 pilgrims t annually resort. It is to this place that the much talked of railway is to go, but the material is, I believe, lying abandoned on the shore of the Caspian and the con cessionaire is in Paris. * The royal train consists sometimes of as many as 20,000, of whom 6,000 are soldiers, f The pilgrims to Mecca are said not to exceed 90,000 annually.11 It is supposed that M, Bo ital has a concession for a line from Resht to Kasvin, and through Teheran and Shiraz to Bushire ; there are also projects for lines from Baku to Resht and from Tiflis through Tabriz to Teheran, while grander schemes include lines from Alexandretta through Persia to Peshawar, and from Tripoli along the Mekraa coast, to Karachi. For local lines, however, Persia as a country is scarcely ready, for hardly one fiftieth of its surface is as yet cultivated, and very much of the land, especially in the south on which cereals sugarcane, &amp;c., were raised is now given over to the cultivation of opium. At the same time the fault in her communications becomes painfully evident in times of scarcity. In 1861 there was a great famine. In 1871-72 the plague appeared ; in 1875, pestilence and famine together nearly ruined the country when two-thirds of the population in large cities were carried off. One or two things are prominently noticeable, viz., clearness of the atmos phere, the absence of noise, general disappearance of every body at sundown, and tne number of beggars and sick people. For the poor of all classes, however, there are two admirable institutions, one, the Sisters of St. Vincent, and the other, the Anglo-American Mission. The Private Physician of the Shah is Dr. Tholo- zan, a Frenchman; he daily visits at the Palace, and reminded me very much in manner of Msjor Martin, the Private Secretary to the Maharaja of .Mysore. Dr. Tholozan has been at Teheran for many years, and he presented me with some pamphlets he had written on the sudden appearance and disappearance of cholera, and also on the plague, which apparently on the last occasion broke out simul taneously at certain spots far apart on the confines of Persia. In the Palace there are two thrones, the one of marble inlaid with gold, and the other, the peacock throne, taken from Delhi by Nadir Shah. This throne is of gold inlaid with precious stones; at the back there is a sun in brilliants flanked by two peacocks also in brilliants (see Photograph No.7 O). Tavernier who saw the throne at Delhi, estimated its value at 6 millions sterling. In 1738 (only 150 years ago), Nadir Shah with 65,000 men overran the Punjab before Delhi even knew of his advance. He defeated Mahomed Shah at Kurnal and entered Delhi in March 1739, when after loot and massacre, which lasted nearly two months, he retired with about 32 millions of spoil. The Palaces contain many articles of great value, lamps, candelabra, pictures, chandeliers, mosaics, carpets, felts, china bowls, bronzes, &amp;c M and one of the most curious objects is a golden globe of the world 20 inches in diameter, where the oceans are in emeralds, India in amethysts, Africa in rubies, Persia in turquoises, France and England in diamonds, while the names are given in brilliants, the cost of this plaything being £320,000. There are precious stones also in abundance, among which is the Dar-i-nor or Sea of Light. The private treasury of the Shah is said to he in vaulted chambers under a large tank in one of the gardens. It is opened occasionally, once in 3 years, when the water has to he first run off before the door becomes apparent in the floor of the tank. The periodical visit is never for the purpose of taking money out, but always for putting more in. The estimate of the amount stored varies from 3 to 13 millions. The report that money is hoarded to a large extent is very possible, for after the manner of the country, when the Shah wants money he asks for it and gets it. All surplus revenue also goes into the treasury of the Shah. Although in a general way there is no evidence of extreme poverty, yet one would not call Persia a rich country, at the same time there is a vast amount of actual wealth in gold, precious stones, lead, iron, coal, bitumen, &amp;c., &amp;c., hidden away, and the fertility of the soil is of a very high order. Its area is about 636,000 square miles, and the population about 8 millions. The old division between the Turanian, the Medes and the Aryan, the Persians still exists, for the Northern part is occupied by people of Turkish origin (Turkis), while in the south the Persian element {Farsis) predominates. (See Photograph Nos. 7P 7Q.) These two having only one religion and distinctly a part from other Mussulmans form the Persian nation. The ruling power (Kadjar) is Turk, and until recently Turkish was the Court language. The characteristics of the nation are pride in its traditions, an invincible faith (as Shias) in the memory of Ali and the Imams, with a corresponding hatred of the Sunis, and their Caliphs, Omer and Aboubakr.12 The Turk is and Farsis are distributed between Iliats or nomads, and Tadjicks or settlers, &amp;c. Of the nomads the Bakhtyaris, mustering about 375,000, and the Luris, 125,000, are the most important, these witli the Arabs on the southern coast and the Beloochees of Kerman, Mogdiistan, &amp;c., amount to almost one-third of the whole population. These nomadic tribes are agriculturists as well as shepherds—they dwell in towns in winter, and return yearly to the same mountains in summer to pasture their flocks. They are ruled directly by hereditary Chiefs, who are re ponsible for the conduct of the tribes and the payment of the Government tax. This tax apparently is 4 shahis a month for each sheep or goat, or nearly eighteen-pence a year. Benjamin estimates this tax at 40 percent, on the value of each animal per annum. The Tadjicks, therefore, include every one who is not a nomad, viz., the workman, the merchant, the courtier, the schoolmaster, the functionary the landholder, &amp;c. They are individually responsible to the laws of the land. As regards the country generally, to the west and north are mountain ranges, while the central and eastern portion is salt desert; with the exception of the Karun navigable as far as Shuster, it has scarcely a river that can be termed navigable, though some, as the Helmund, Zendarud, &amp;c., extend many miles in length, and possess a great volume of water. The chief products are wheat, barley, cotton, sugar, rice, tobacco and opium.* Irrigation works are necessary, and water is paid for by the hour. Its wines are celebrated, and silk is one of its most important manufactures. The Persian Government has no debt, as the revenue of the year always exceeds the expenditure. For some years Persia has not been obliged to export specie to pay for her imports, and lately she has been importing bullion in the shape of silver bars. Commerce with Russia is by way of the Caspian, and with British India by way of the Persian Gulf. Its imports amount to nearly 4 millions sterling, of which nearly one-half are from British India. Protection to British trade is secured by the treaty of 1841. The regular army numbers about 80,500 (of whom 24,000 with the colors) with 200 field guns, the militia, 70,000 men. The revenue in cash is about £2,100,000f and about £330,000 in kind, while the expenditure is about £2,300,000. There are no railways or roads, and it has 3,775 miles of telegraph ('Whitaker, 1887). The revenue is gathered under ordinary and extraordinary heads. Ordinary (malliat) appar ently includes customs, tax on land, one-fifth of the produce and taxes on local manufactures, while extraordinary (sadir) can include anything at will. The army is now being trained and drilled by Russian officers, as infantry, cavalry and artillery. The material is said to be good; and although a great improvement has been made, there is a want of certainty or solidity about the wdiole arrangement, owing to the irregularity with which pay is issued t &gt; the troops. A fairly full parade may last for a few days, but gradually the numbers dwindle, as the men in one’s and two’s have marched off to their homes. From the ease and manner in which every Persian seems to be able to ride, there should be no difficulty in forming regiments of first-rate horsemen, well suited to the military requirements of the province. The army is recruited by districts, the moollahs, merchants and workmen being exempt; service is fixed at J2 years. The-strength of the army is nominally fixed at 50,000, while it is actually about 30,000, with piwer to enlarge to 200,000. The Persian if properly led is said not to be inferior to the Turk. The servant, Nasr-ullah, on arrival at Teheran disappeared. On the 3rd day he returned rigged out in a fine blue skirt, and said he had been to see his friends and have a bath. It was thought advisable to engage another man, . ‘ Khodaya,* a very rough and ready customer. He was to have an advance of 50 krans, coat, breeches and boots, and 110 krans at Bushire, with a present if he behaved himself, say about 230 krans, or £7 ; for this he would have to ride about 1 500 miles, and be away from his home for 6 weeks. * One of the principal sources of revenue is from the turquoise mines which are leased for £16, ( &gt;00 a year, and from the pearl fishery, which is let for £10,000 yearly. ■t The principal markets for Persian opium are Hong-Kong and London, and in 1886, 4,993 chests, worth £374,475 were exported. The quantity of morphia varies from 11^ to 12 per cent. Opium occupies the first place in the foreign trade of Persia. — Pioneer.Nasr-ullah was duly reported to the Consul, but after some enquiry and explanation, the conclusion was that if he was to be handed over to the Persian authorities for punishment, 1 must pay for it!! Nasr-uilah went his way with the 50 krans advance which was not very much. He was going to stay in Teheran. Persian law is divided into two parts. The Shahr, based on the Koran and enforced by the priests, generally takes cognisance of civil cases and the Urf, or oral law administered by secular judges, deals with criminal cases. The temporary marriage is an institution peculiar to Persia and four condi tions are indispensable, vis., the contract, which must he drawn up before a priest ; the personal conditions wherein the woman shall profess one of the four revealed religions—Islamism, Judaism, Christianity or Magianism; the dowry, of which the husband must pay half if he dismisses the wife before consum mation, and after consummation the whole; the period for which the marriage may be contracted whether for part of a day, for 90 years or even an antedate, must be written in the contract. One of the fundamental principles of Persian law is the lex talionis ov law of retaliation, the injured party not only being entitled to punish the offender himself, but to demand the penalty. One of the most objectionable features is that which allows the penalty, when of a physical nature, to be applied by the injured party (Benjamin, 438-456). The obstacles to progress in Persia are said to be its State religion where Government and the law are subject to official direction by the clergy to official corruption and to the rivalry between England and Russia. Mr. Benjamin, who established the United States legation at Teheran, considers that there is no question u that British prestige in the East has weakened very greatly and perhaps irretrievably during the last decade,” and he states that “ the Persians cordially hate both England and Russia.” He also adds “ politically, the Shah and many of the most intelligent Persians are secretly in sympathy with England because she is inclined to leave Persia alone, and they are violently opposed to Russia because her designs for the conquest of their country are evident and sure.” Mons. Orsolle, pp. 273-276, reports a conversation he had in 1884 at Teheran with Iskander Beg, on Afghanistan and its future, to the following effect, viz. As Afghanistan commands the routes leading from Central Asia to British India, it was necessary for her to choose between two such power ful rivals as the actual possessors and the future invaders of India. Russia entered upon the scene in 1837 in command of the Persian Army, first to be siege Herat, and then to absorb Afghanistan up to the Indian frontier. This caused England to interfere in Afghan quarrels by the replacement of Shah Soojah—thereon followed theCabul massacre, and the final advance of Pollock. Since that period Russia and England have sought for an alliance with Afghan istan. Russia, again, in 1856 persuaded Persia to seize Herat; thereon England invaded Persia. By this act England secured the sympathy of Afghanistan but failed to profit by it. In 1869 Shir Ali, alarmed when Russia took Tash- kend, Khodjend, and Samarcand, sought assistance from Lord Mayo at Umballa, which was not granted. In 1873, after Khiva had been taken, after Lord Northbrook refused assistance and after the Seistan award in favor of Persia, Shir Ali took the side of the strongest—and although the war of 1879 was fatal to Afghanistan, the retreat of the English shews how little they trust ed in a decisive victory. Each day Russia advances, and England dares not stop her. “ We also have our revenge to take against England. Her prestige in Central Asia is completely gone; all the world knows that Russia causes England to tremble, and when the Czar shall send Ids armies to conquer India the whole of Afghanistan will help Russia. She will conquer, and England will have to withdraw. ” Iskander Beg then continues, that Afghanistan is poor and Russia will ask for no tribute—that Russian rule will end all strife and benefit the country—and in return Afghanistan will furnish, as she has already done, troops for Russian service. The simplest reply to all this long tirade rests in the fact that Afghanistan is not of one mind, and that the disaffected will always go against their ruler. It is by no means certain that the Afghan nation as a whole would quietly14 accept either one or the other of the powerful rivals as an absolute ruler. Moreover Russia has stated that she has no intention, at present or at any time, of threatening Herat or any part of Afghanistan ; her desire is to secure a peaceful border and strengthen her friendship with England. In the same w T ay with Persia, Russia may be supposed to possess a preponderating influence, but it is by no means certain that England could not quickly check this, or even turn the balance the other way if she chose to exert herself thoroughly. Russia, however, in the question of the frontier between Persia and Turcomania (Paper No. 6 , page 5, para. 2), declared some time ago that the definition of this boundary is a matter which concerns herself, and admits of no foreign inter ference. Later on, when the Ateks (between Babu Durmaz and Dushak) were absorbed, Russia replied that she was as much interested in the integrity of the Persian province as England could he ; that the Ateks had never belonged to or been under the control of Persia, and that it was only after the tribe had been subdued that the Shah had claimed them as his own. Expenses, £4. Tips, £1-10-0. 7th November, Monday .—Left Major Wells’ hospitable roof at 6 J a.m. and was well clear of city by 7. Met donkeys, camels, men, all coming in for the market. Over the Kum gateway is Rustum fighting with the white demon. The ride very pleasant, and road fair going, though the pony turned a somer sault with me when within about 6 miles of Robat Kearim. The scenery in front is of an ordinary type—a plain, with a few mud villages, sparse cultivation, some low hills and the telegraph wire. Behind, it is different; a range of fine hills with the lights ever changing. Halted at Robat to study a Persian dictionary for one hour; breakfast, and then on. The route good, but over some low stony hills. Plains with but little growth, 36 foot-paths winding about, the tracks of laden beasts. Saw three large sand- grouse; the servant called them ‘tobah.* The new man Khodaya much more lively than Nasr-ulla. The chapparkhana at Pik is small, with an upstairs room, from which one can see the country round, the mud domes of the village, the interior of some of the court-yards, and the camels and bullocks returning for the night. A chapparkhana is a rest-house where the post keeps its horses. The ordinary type is built as a fort, in mud, with curtain walls and towers at the corners, and a large double gateway on one side. To the right and left of the gate inside there are rooms, one for the chapparchi or head man, and the other for ordinary travellers, and on the three sides which enclose the court-yard are vaulted cor ridors w r hich form the stables and store-houses during winter. In summer the horses are picketed in the court-yard, and feed from mangers built into the walls. At one corner there is a staircase which leads to a room over the porch, intended for the better class of travellers. This room is unfurnished, but there is a fire-place, and the man in charge can generally produce a felt or two, some bread, a fowl, and possibly a little tea. After a day’s ride in a very little time the soup is cooked, the bed-sack filled with bhoosa, the fowl eaten, and the traveller is asleep. 8lh November, Tuesday. — Left at 5-30 a.m. Venus like a huge solitaire in the sky. Half-moon. Rode to Kushk-i-bairam and then to Ramatabad. In crossing a plain by the edge of a salt lake flushed a tilaor (houbara). Good going whole way. Kum* looks rather nice—green fields, gilded mosque, hio-fi minarets and nice market. (See Photograph No. 7S.) Got jammed in the bazar with a drove of donkeys one way and a herd of bullocks the other. Shops nice ; festooned with fruit. Slept at Mr. Lyne’s bungalow, and there saw Ser geant MacIntyre. Heard from Wells that the Mirza Joseph wanted 30 krans more on account of subsistence allowance for 6 days while waiting for me at Enselli. Replied by telegraph that I refused to be bled any more. Mr Lyne is in charge of one of the telegraph sections ; he has been here some vears' his wife and child are with him. He says that land round about vields a net profit of 40%. Here is the shrine of Eatima, very sacred, whose altar affords protection to all who seek itf. Kum is famous for its potterv. * About 150 miles due west of Ivum is Hamadsn, or Ecbatana, where naptha, bitumen, was known to exist from an early period. When Alexander was in this district the people scattered some drops of naptha on the line which led to his abode, and standing at one end, they applied their torches to some of the first drops, for it was night. The flame communicated itself swifter than thought, and the path was instantaneously all on fire (Plutarch’s life of Alexander.) f it is also said that criminals in Persia may find absolute protection by seeking refuge in a stable.15 9th November, Wednesday. —LeftLyne’s at 6 , then Khodaya let his horse' o*o and this led to a chase for an hour in the cultivated fields south of Kum. “ to Teheran to* Near Passangun met Dr. Woolbert, who was caravanmg ■join Maclean at Meshed. Changed horses at Passangun. Had a tumble, as the horse fell with me coming down the last stony hill into Sinsin. Presh nags; this time mine was a real beast; got 2 farsakhs out of him and changed with the servant. After passing Sinsin, scenery varies slightly, and at Nusseerabad vil- lao-es begin to appear. The flora of the plateau are very scanty, as compared with the rich production of the country below the hills towards the Caspian. Here one gets a lovely melon called tohmeh khand or sugar egg. A few trees now appear ; snowy hills on the right, the salt plains of Kharian on left. Arrived at Kashan at p.m., and put up with Mr. Aganoor. Kashan is in a hollow ; had a good bath. The place is famed for its silk and velvet. Taxes are levied at Teheran, Kashan, Ispahan, Shiraz and Bushire on all through and local traffic ; these are farmed out; the yield for Kashan is said to be l^OOO tomans (£4,550,) and for Shiraz, 23,000 (£7,475). English and Russian imported goods sell cheaper than local manufactures. Eoreign goods merely pay a 5 °l o ad valorem duty at port of entry and departure, and are exempt from octroi°and inland customs charges. Leaning tower at Kashan, but did not see it. 10th November, Thursday. —Left Kashan 5-30 a.m., and got to the foot of the hills, probably 12 miles, along a very stony track in 3 hours ;. the air was so clear that on looking back the town did not seem to be 5 miles away. The road then 9 ascends by a regular gorge with running water all the way, passing a big bund which had been built across a narrow neck. The reservoir was nearly empty but full of silt. The outlet was very small and at the bottom of the embankment in the centre.’ On to Kohrud, a spot highly cultivated ; a fair sized village most picturesquely situated on the hill side (see Photograph No. 7W) ; the autumn tints at the fall of the leaf were lovely, the golden bronze of the chestnut mixing with the purple of the plane trees. Erom Kohrud it is about a farsakh to head of pass leading down into Soh (see Photograph No. 7T). Here I found MacGowan and some foreigners from Ispahan on a visit. Eever and neuralgia. Uth November, Friday.—tett at 8 | a.m. for Bideshk. Rode on through. Morchakar to Gaz by 5 p.m., and, as it was too late to make the next stage before dark, slept there. 12th November, Saturday .—Into Ispahan by 8 at Dr. Hoernle’s; received a Dost-card of 5th October from England. Telegraph to London 4 words^ 9 krans 12 shahis (say, 5s. 10(f). Outriding with Madame Balois and Rerd. G. K. Ekms. Mnner Balois the French Consul-General, was about to call on the Zil-es-Sultan, the Governor of Ispahan, and the eldest son of the Shah. A 6 -horsed brougham had been sent for him, and it is a wonder how such a lumbering affair could ever have been taken through the narrow winding alleys without any up- , pt : Visited the arsenal, and was received by Karim Khan, the Amir Panj (see Photnaranh No 7 0). A regiment was drawn up in the main square ; general salute • reealed with tea, and then shewn over the different galleries ; everything in verv stood older. Boots for the infantry to last one year, price 5 krans ; all leather locally cured* ; water-bottles of leather with brass nozzles ; mens cloaks of grev material with cape, 6 of them intended to form a tent d abn for 6 men • 2 cloaks form the roof supported hy 2 rifles as standards ; 2 cloaks on the ~d for 6 men to lie on ; and 2 cloaks remaining to cover them. The arms were from Austria, Werndl pattern carbines, costing 8 tomans (£2-12-0), and rifles for infantry costing 12 tomans (£3-18-0): these prices were considered high - some rifles which had been made locally in imitation, piece hy piece, hand work’ were said to have cost 15 tomans (nearly £5). Visited the palace. The Prince’s body-guard (see Photograph 7V), wearing Austrian helmets drawn up ; two bands playing. Different squads under m- struction—gymnastics, fencing, sword drill, single sticks, pole jumping &amp;c. In the old hall at the Garden Palace th ere are many curious wall paintings ' * process of making ‘ Russia ’ leather was borrowed from Persia.of Nadir Shah’s battles with Indians, Afghans, Turks ; also his receptions of different kings. Visited the Collegp. Tiles of the minaret very good, the court-yard looks cool and quiet with its plane trees and tanks. Minarets at the University very pretty. Turkish bath with Dr. Hoernle, the son-in-law of Dr. Bruce*. Introduced to the Armenian Archbishop. 13th Novemler, Sunday .—family prayers in the morning. Public service in Church conducted in Persian. Called* with Mr. Aganoor on the Prince, Massood Mirza, the Zil-es Sultan. The outer court was filled with soldiers; the officers came up and in saluting reported the muster of their regiments. Apparently there were 4 regiments, each 572 strong. Inspected the store-rooms. Saw men fencing and pole-jumping. Informed that the Prince was ready to receive me. Passed through a second court and into a small garden, the walls of which were decorated with ibex and gud horns. The Prince, about 40 years of age, with a pleasing though abrupt manner, was in a small room overlooking the garden. After a few remarks he said he was confined to his couch through in disposition and that the Moollahs had been with him. He said Mioollahs were very foolish. They thought the world was made for them. I assented, and said what a pity it was they did not travel to see it. Then we spoke of Ayub, and he was anxious to know whether he was caught, or whether he submitted. I told him as much as I had heard. Then we spoke of Bokhara and Russia. He said Russia would keep the Bokhara Emir up so as not to frighten India, but by-and-by he would be blotted out. He asked me how many men could Russia move to Afghan frontier. I said about 8,000 a day. He said he did not want to know that, but how large an army. After a short time I said that drawing from the Caucasus, the Volga, Khiva, Siberia, &amp;c., I thought 300,000; he said that was what he had himself heard from Russians, viz., 400,000 and 600 guns, tlm odd 100,000 being required to keep Turkestan quiet. Then he spoke of shooting, and when on the subject of my travels, he said I was one of two things, either very silly or very clever, to have obtained permission to visit Russia in the East. As I had heard at Teheran that he was about to be decorat ed, I shewed him my medals; he was pleased with them, and paid me a very pretty compliment. When speaking of Alikanof, I said I had a picture of that officer, and on the Prince expressing a wish to see it I said I would give it to him. In telling the Prince he ought to travel, I said he should go eastward to India first, to see what a Mahomedan province properly ruled could really become, and that having done the East he might then go Wbst. He said the suggestion was good but it all depended on the will of his father. On my taking leave he got up and gave me five of his pictures from a cupboard. I asked him to write his name on one, which he did (see Photograph No. 7X ), and then said as you have given me so many, may I give one to the Viceroy in India ? He replied that one is for you, and you may do with the others as you like; that I might give one to the Viceroyf as he was so kind and considerate to Mussulmans ; that he had the greatest admiration and even affection for Lord Dufferin, and that I was to be sure to convey these sentiments to the Viceroy. I then said I should like to give one picture to the Commander-in-Chief, and he said by all means. | I then took leave of him, and he called me back after I had left the room to shake hands with me a second time and bid me farewell. The conversation was carried on through his Native Doctor, a man who spoke English and had studied medicine in England. The army is evidently his hobby (See Photo graph 7Z); and although he is the eldest son, he is not the Crown Prince, for his mother was not of the blood royal. The general impression is that he intends to fight for the throne. The heir apparent is Musaffur-ed-deen Mirza, at present Governor of Azerbeidjan; he is said to possess good administrative ability. The third son is Kamran Mirza, who lives at Teheran as Minister for Mar. Erom the palace I went with Mr. Aganoor to visit Karim. Khan Amir Eanj, he wa s delighted to see me. Plenty of fruits and sweeties ready. He * Missionary work in Persia is apparently limited to Native Christians and Jews. t Given to H. E. the Viceroy at Calcutta, 13th January 1888. + Given to H. E 3 the Commander-in-Chief, at Calcutta, 12th January 1838. A third portrait was aiso given to H. K. H. the Duke of Connaught at Poonah on 5th January 1888.17 also gave me his picture, and wrote his name thereon (see Photograph No. 7 U.) ; he also presented me with a drinking-bottle of his own, and said he would send another from the Arsenal as a pattern for our troops ; also two cloaks to make a tent. The Editor of the Persian paper published at Ispahan was present helping to receive us; ordered the newspaper, 8 tomans a year including postage. In the evening when the water-bottle and the cloaks arrived, the hearer, a junior officer, was duly received, given a kalyan to smoke, and sent away with a present of 2 tomans, Persian fashion, which requires that the tip shall he about equivalent to the things received. At Ispahan 32fb of ice delivered daily for five months for 10 krans. Ispahan is the ancient capital, and Julfa is its Armenian suburb. The Zamdarud flows by the city and is crossed by two or more bridges, one with very high parapet walls, and the other acting as a dam with regulating sluices (see Photograph No. 7Y). Chahar Bagh might once have been a sight, but now all is neglected. The Maidan-i-Shah 300 X 180 yards enclosed by barracks. The trembling minarets of Ispahan I did not see; apparently there are two minarets, one on each side of a dome. On striking one, the other oscillates, while the masonry between the two remains at rest. Near Ispahan is the range of Zaida Koh mountains, 16,000 feet. 14th November, Monday. —Left [Ispahan, or rather Julfa, and Gifford met me on the road near Kumeshah. Saw Mrs. Gifford and her little girl. Passed a most comfortable night under their roof. 15th November, Tuesday. —Load through Yezd-i-Khast, a curious village perched on an isolated rock in a deep ravine. Slept at Shulgistan. 16th November, Wednesday. —On to Abadeh. Most wretched ponies. Sergeant Glover met me and gave me breakfast. Number of Mahomedans (Russian subjects) in Kashan, also at Ispahan. Russian influence prevails that is, if aiiy merchant or other person wants anything done, he applies to Russian Consul, &amp;c. Lately a Russian officer (Captain Blumer) and his two Cossacks, all in uniform, passed through Abadeh on a trip to Bushire, making full enquiries as to routes for guns, &amp;c, Glover was in the 37th Company, Royal Engineers in 1865 when I was attached to it at Chatham. He is married to an Armenian, and his boys (two) are going to the depot at Chatham. St. John’s influence when in Persia very great. Saw the new moon; such a beauty. Got on to Surmek, cooked dinner and turned in. 17th November, Thursday. —On through Khankhoreh to Dehbid. Ser geant Blake is here with his wife, and although it is a place in the desert, they are as happy as possible. Sa\r four cranes (gaz) and tw^o ducks. I he robber Reza Khan, a Kashgari, is out on the Murghab Pass, looting ; his followers released him from prison in Shiraz, and they are now plundering right and left. The Governor has just sent a message to Reza Khan saying that if he will go off to his village, nothing more will be said; the sequel to this being that eventually he wall be enticed into Ispahan or Shiraz and summarily disposed of (see Photograph No. 24). 18th November, Friday. —Left Dehbid at 7-20 a.m. and got into Murghab at 12-20, 5 hours; very cold indeed, ice on every strean. Thirty miles at least on one nag, and of this 12 miles over about the worst road in Persia. It is at this pass Reza Khan plies his trade. Saw some soldiers on watch. After Murghab at about 1 farsakh is Cyrus' tomb.* Saw the first piece of quartz here ; the scenery now r alters for the better, and the route runs through a bold gorge with running water, trees, &amp;c., fording the same stream twice. Into Kawamabad in 4 hours. Post just going out; two men on horseback, and two nags with post bags, trotting in front; had to ride their old and tired horses. Went on from Kawamabad and met Mr. Wittingback in the pass; a cup of tea in his tent and slept at his bungalow at Sivand. The route along the pass from Murghab is very nice with the river Polvar flowing by, and * The tomb had a Persian inscription and Alexander ordered it to be inscribed also in Greek. It was as follows^ ^ whosoever thou art and whensoever thou comest (for come I know thou wilt) I am Cyrus the founder of the Persian Empire. Envy me not the little earth that covers my body.” (Plutarch).18 giving some life to the scenery. Mr. Wittingback was out on his half-yearly inspection; he has to walk along the whole of his charge and examine every insulator, &amp;c. Lengths of the line are sometimes thrown down by the snow and storms in winter, and for days communication is interrupted. 19th November, Saturday. —Started about 7 and went straight to Naksh-i- Rustum, the tombs of the Kings, in a high sandstone hill. The face is sculptured with various scenes, notably Valerian as a suppliant to Shapur. Rode across the plain to Poozeh chapparkhana. Left my kit; had breakfast; got another nag and went off with the guide to Persepolis and Naksh-i-Rajjub: this time the man took his gun and sword, because he said the looties were about. We saw nothing of them, and it says a good deal for the Shah that his dominions are so safe for any one who chooses to visit them. At Persepolis there are the ruins, the palaces of Darius and of Xerxes, the tombs in the hills, the bulls, the grand steps, &amp;c. Alexander stayed 1 months in winter at Perse polis to give his troops time to recruit* and it was after a feast where a great deal too much winef seems to have been indulged in, that Thais, a native of Attica, and mistress to Ptolemy, afterwards King of Egypt, suggested burning the palace of Xerxes. Alexander himself is said to have led the riot. The whole place is now tumbled about, but there is enough to occupy and interest one for at least two days. Many of the carvings are finely executed, and the hard black stone carries a polish like marble. 20th November, Sunday. —Rode to Pul-i-Khan (see Sketch of the bridge No. 25) crossing the Kor river or Bundamir stream, Bundamir village being some miles down. Into Zergoond, about 3 miles of a paved causeway across the open plain, much damaged. Saw^Brahminy duck, sand-grouse, wild-duck, crane, plover, and pigeon on the Persepolis plain. From Zergoond 15 out of the 20 miles is up and down the narrow spurs of hills by a very rough and stony road. Then the country opens, and all of a sudden you see Shiraz between the hills, a lovely peep through the dark framing of a narrow gorge ; tank house on one side, walled road on the other. Shiraz with its cypresses, gardens, town and mosque in the plain below. Shiraz is below hills and in a highly cultivated and well-watered plain. Three blue domes conspicuous. Bazar built by Karim Khan 150 years ago in form of a cross. Mosque of Shah Chiragh prominent, also Masjid-i-Nan and Syed Hussein’s; the tile work especially good. Mr. Preece living in a garden, the property of Mir Hassan Ali Khan. Slept and dined there. Met Dr. Scully. Transit as per Paper No. 7B, £17-0-0, expenses £7-12-0. 21st November, Monday. —Prom Shiraz the journey has to be continued with mules, as the country is so steep and rough (see Section Paper No. 7 C). Mules late; left at 9 and reached Khan-i-Zinian at 4 ; 8 farsakhs, 7 hours ; 3 mules; road very up and down and very stony. 22nd November, Tuesday. —Left at ^ past 7 and made Dasht-i-Arjun (plain of wild olives) at 11 ; roughish road ; hills covered with scrub jungle and ice in the nullahs. Took breakfast with Sergeant Jeffreys and his wife. Dasht- i-Arjun seems to have no outlet, and it is a wonderfully large basin surrounded by hills ; those on the east side, though the stratification is horizontal, are cut by storms and weather into upright pillars giving a peculiar effect. It is easy to fancy that this plain must be a perfect carpet of wild flowers in the spring. A lion had been killing horses and mules for the last seven days at Pirizan (Old Woman’s Pass) just at the spot where St. John was attacked by a lion. Jeffreys made me take my revolver from the valise. Tofanchis were out on the hills firing, and a spot on the road was pointed out where some governor had been lately murdered. The road up to the khotal is very steep and very rough, quite impassable for guns, and the road down to Mian Khotal caravanserai is equally bad, through quite a forest of trees shedding the leaf. The caravanserai at Mian Khotal is prettily placed on a knoll amidst trees. Made a sketch of the route to-day from Pirizan looking across Khotal Doktar to the hills beyond the Kazran plain. (See Sketch No. 26). * Alexander led 12o,000 foot and 15,000 horse to India, and only brought back about one-fourth of the number. t At one supper Promachus drank four measures of wine (about 14 quarts), and the rest of the guests drank to such a degree that 41 of them died from the effects.19 23rd November, Wednesday .—Left Mian Khotal at 6-30 a,m. and arrived at foot of Loktar Kkotal, 3 farsakhs, in hours. The road descends from Mian Khotal 500 or 600 feet down the rocky side of the hill into a stony plain, the bed of the Quara Agach river which is full of trees (black trees), but evidently swept by torrents. The hills on either side being curiously pitched inwards evenly to the river, just as if the ground on both sides had once formed one mass 'and then had been deeply depressed in the middle by a sudden disturb ance. After about 8 miles begins the ascent of Doktar Khotal (the Maid’s Pass), 1,000 feet high; nothing much to speak of; a small tower, a shrine and a hauz (under-ground reservoir) are passed, and then the descent begins. At first it is a mere rut, worn between rocks and stones, then it becomes a regular cobbled staircase zig-zagging along the face of the rocks; the cobbling is loose at places, and the stones are left scattered about. The work is an engineering feat, and considering the circumstance of the short distance, the heavy grades, &amp;c. &amp;c., it cannot be improved on. Prom the foot of the staircase the track is over the stony bed of a torrent up to a small bridge where the Naksh-i-Timour is apparently representing three or four women and a lion. Prom the bridge it’is 2 farsakhs into Kazran over a sandy plain with kiril bushes here and there. Arrived at Mr. Edwards’ place at 2 p.m. Coming down the hill the mule in front of me had a long shaped box, so when I asked what was in it, the driver said “ a dead man for Kerbela.*” The first palm-trees seen in the village. Kazran has about 8,000 inhabitants, and is famous for its oranges and poppy cultivation. 24th November, Thursday .—Left Kazran late, as the muleteer having got an advance the night before of 60 krans, had walked off with the mules to his abode. To the point of the hill where the route turns southward is 3 farsakhs, then a farsakh up and down a moderate hill, and then a farsakh into Kamaraj, 51 h olir s doing the 5 farsakhs. Waited for an hour at the rest-house. The Kamarai Kotal is close to the rest-house, and after a short and rough rise the descent begins : it is just as if the sides of a mountain had fallen in, ana a path was only to be found winding along through the stones and debris. The path is so narrow that the mule-loads strike against the rocks ; the grade is very severe. In places it amounts to steps, and the way the mules scram ble up and down these paths is little short of marvellous considering that many of them carry heavy loads or huge kajjawas in which two, if not three women are comfortably ensconsed. About 1,200 feet in all of a descent from the Kamarai Plain which is 2,950 feet above the sea. The geological formation is curious, a singular configuration of long flat-topped hills with ribs m perfectly straight layers of colored clays, tipped at an angle from crest to bottom. A part? it is not unlike the Upper Sooroo Pass in Abyssinia, though here more tumbled and of a rougher description, but without the huge boulders which there blocked the way and required ramps and staircases to surmount them. # After about 6 miles the Kunar Kud appears, looking most refreshing with its open winding of blue-green water and miniature rapids ; the road then leaves the stream, and after a few small hills the track strikes across a plain to Konar- takteh A lovely evening, so still and the light so clear. The surioundmgs remind one of many of the villages in Sind ; plenty of date palms. Got in at 5-30 having taken 3^ hours from the rest-house. '25th November, Friday.-Lett Konartakteh at 6-10 am; got to the head of Kotal Malu, the worst of the lot. The descent is 1,000 feet from Khisht, 1 800 feet above the sea; the head is but a cut through rock, scarcely wide enough for one mule; there is a stone causeway with a grade ot 1 in 3 or 4 Tneing made, turning and twisting down a spur, by one Bukkur Khan. The hill is formed of masses of conglomerate, and the track wmds through and down for labour as far as the three arches of an old bridge m the river. Here it rained. The route continues along the bed of a river to Dahki Bridge of six arches one large span in the centre, three on one side, and two on another , the^utwateUare out of repair, and very shaky Then the track follows the searned bank of river, passes another old broken bridge and wandeis thiough nullahs and rocky hills till Daliki is before yo u; heavy ram, thunder an d . Kertela nearifeghdad, wbere Ali is buried. ' Of all sacred places this is the most venerated by Shi»». c 020 lightning : groves of date-palms. Time 5 hours. The heavy rain fortunately stopped shortly after 1 f.m. Passed the sulphur and naptha springs. The hills seem as if they had been dipped in naptha to their summit. Coal is said to have been lately discovered in south of Persia. There are some salt hills north of the village of different colors; water very green and sulphurous; some of the stones covered with red fungoids. Plushed a snipe in one of the odoriferous pools ; will he taste of kerosine ? Took 4 hours to Borasjoon. Borasjoon is the place to which the Persians fled after Kushab, and then to elude us left their camp and fled to Daliki before going up the hills ; their idea being that English could fight at sea, but not on land. It is said that in the charge at Kushab, the Persian square was astonished to see a few officers and cavalry charge it : they did not know what was meant, and that when the officers got inside the square the Persians did not attempt to kill them but looked on and wondered what they were going to do next. Some peculiar ideas exist also as to the relations between Outram and Stalker. What is required for Persians is regular pay, &amp;c., to ensure discipline. The public works one sees, caravanserais, &amp;c., are due solely to private enterprise. The Kotal Malu I now find is not an unfinished but an abandoned work. One man, a merchant of Shiraz, made it, paying his own masons. Then it appears the man was a muff, for he began to pave a road straight up a precipitous spur without zigzags ; a darzi pointed out that another route to the left was better. The merchant in disgust stopped work, lost his money, and the credit to his name. 26th November, Saturday. —Left at 6 and arrived by 12-30 at Shif. Asked Arshak Malcolm to write a small book on Persian War. Stack in his book says this march from Shif to Borasjoon was the worst he experienced in Persia; it was my last, so I had to make the most of it. The rain came down in tor rents at Kushab, and lasted right into Shif, the mules slipping about like cats in nutshells on the ice. The route is over a dead level plain and most greasy. At Shif met Ross’s men who gave me letters up to 19th October; all well at home, and just as I was going off to the launch, an old curlew got up with his wild cry, recalling at once pleasant days on Loch Awe, and above all the oldest and best friend I have in the world, “ Hairy,” the boy of 40 years ago, and with whom this peculiar whistle used to be a mutual call and signal during youthful frolics. Good news from home to the latest possible date ; sudden recollections of old friends, the labour of travel done, rest, a good lunch, &amp;c., &amp;c., verily the Good Spirit moved upon the face of the waters. After 2 hours’ steam, and after Khodaya had been thoroughly sea-sick we landed at Bushire. Here B oss’s dogcart was ready and in 10 minutes I was under his hospitable roof. A tub, clean clothes, and afternoon tea with Mrs. Ross and her two daughters. Dr. Ross and Ravenshaw, a Political, here. 27th November, Sunday. —Bushire—Drive, &amp;c.—settled with Khodaya— he asked me for everything I had,—gave him krans 116 and the native saddle and bridle; he is now going to Kerbela to be buried in a box as I tell him. The customs of Bushire amount to £24,000. The harbour is not good, and the island can only be approached by vessels of light draught. Steamers and ships have to anchor some 2 miles away in an open roadstead. At Mohamrah they say ships of deep draught can lie alongshore, and from that port there is water carriage for 200 miles inland to Shuster.* There is a project for the navigation of the Karun, and a connection beyond with Dizful by rail, but the terms and conditions are so adverse to Persia that it is no wonder negociation is in abeyance. Some say that Russia prevents f the Shah from sanctioning this work of development; the probability is the Syndicate strangled their own project. Transit as per Table No. 7B, £4-10-0, expenses £6-4-0. Therefore to sum up, the cost of a ride through Persia “ chapparing,” from Enselli to * Shuster is the ancient Susa wliere Alexander found so much treasure and the purple of Hermiohe. It was here that Darius took refuge as the country was so difficult to traverse and all the passes were guarded by the bravest of the Persians, Alexander’s loot at Susa loaded 20,000 mules and 5,000 camels. (Plutarch). The Karun is said to be navigable, as far as the rapids of Ahwaz, a point to which an Englishman by name Eastcourt ascended in 1836, in a steam-boat ; JVlr. Selby also went as far as Shuster. f Benjamin thinks that Russia desires to stamp out all schemes for progress in Persia—he also points out that Russia invites pastoral tribes to cross the frontier for grazing, and then forces them to remain—that she .nibbles away at territory—that she has already taken in some of the more important mountain ranges, and proposed the absorption of Khorassan.21 Bushire, 950 miles, with 3 horses, may be put down, with extras, at £30, while the expenses from 24th October to 27th November come to £33-11-0, or roughly, at a rate of £1 per day. 28th November, Monday. —Cheques on Bombay can he cashed in Bushire, Ticket by the B. I. S. N. Co. to Bombay R180. Telegram to England, R16-4-0. Tips, B 8 . Said good-bye to Boss and went on hoard the mail boat by steam launch. S. S. “ Pemba?’ Captain Bobertson.* Left at 6 p.m., dined on deck. Lot of horses on hoard. 29th November, Tuesday. —Steaming along quietly all day. 30th November, Wednesday this morning at Linga at 7, and left again at 12^. Lot of houses on the shore, with high hills behind. The coast people are all of Arab origin. Shipping rice, &amp;c.; plenty of fish. At Linga lots of buggalow r s lying off laden with dates for Bombay ; also took in about four buggalow loads of rice. Bise of tide in Gulf about 9 feet ', night tides higher than the day. Distance from Bushire 478 miles. 1st December, Thursday. —Approached Bunder Abbas at daylight. Kishm Island, the summer resort. There are several isles about, viz., Laraz, Hormuz, and on the opposite coast of Arabia there are good harbours. Immediately behind Bunder Abbas is Jahal Gouar (7,690), a mountain the height of Simla, rising at once to its full height within a few miles of the sea. It scarcely looks its height, but the air is so clear; there are other mountains also close by— Shimil 0 (8,500) and Bakhum (10,660), another 9,200 ^ and another 5,120. Bunder Abbas is the chief port in the Gulf, and it is said Bussia intends to have it as being better than Bushire and 'with a better land approach. See Sections 7D ; the heights are taken from St. John’s, and Pierson’s maps. This may be so, but for the present her aim is to control Khorassan and to gain some point south of Meshed where she can cut off the khafilas of Indian trade from Bunder Abbas via Herat to Central Asia. It is also said that so soon as the concession w r as reported as given to an English Syndicate to construct the Euphrates Valley line, Bussia at once flooded the route with Armenian traders. Took in sixlarge buggalows full of cotton, wool and rice foi Bombay. ^ Italian war steamer “ Bapido ” came in. Heard that 2 servants of a Baniah had secured a wonderful pearl for which B10,000 had already been offered and refused. Distance from Linga 110 miles. 2nd December, Friday .—Dzit Bunder Abbas, 6 p.m. yesterday. Steaming away for Muscat ; very calm. 3rd December, Saturday. —Arrived at Muscat early; 248 miles from Bunder Abbas; no end offish, porpoises, &amp;c.

The Sultan of Zanzibar having agreed with Sir Bartle Erere to abolish the slave trade, England in return propesed to relieve him of the ohlio'ation or necessity of paying Muscat. The Sultan of Muscat has another 'brother in Arabia who bursts out occasionally and attacks Muscat. Sultan very hard-up. H. M. S. “ Osprey ” in harbour. Large exports of dates to America, the Muscat or black date being preferred to the Busra or brown date. Hulwar made in great quantities. Drainage very had. Cesspools in centre of court-yard. Left again at 6 p.m. Mr. McKenzie on board; he had been preparing estimates to rebuild the Besidency. 4th December, Sunday. —Steaming along ; weather very clear. 5th December, Weather very fine. 6th December, Tuesday. —Made the Manora light, Kurrachee, at 3 a.m. 500 miles from Muscat. Number of boats; tramway, extra lines of railway wharves, &amp;c. ; place very busy. Drove up to Ffinch’s; saw the General s old house my old*house ; fresh wmer has done much for the place, grass growung on the lawns and all sorts of flowers ; bouquets being cut from garden.

My old coachman saw me in the garden and recognised me. Drove to Club, Zoological Gardens, Ladies’ Club, Erere Hall, called on General Marston, Jamsetjee, &amp;e, 7th December, Wednesday. —Breakfasted with Price at Manora, went off to the horing apparatus in the harbour at Deep Water Point with Sangster. The drills are percussion, working with compressed air 70ft to an inch, rotation of drill 10 blows in a circle : work 25 feet under water, air conveyed in flexible tube.
