An additional mixed foliation/pagination sequence is present in parallel between ff 35-222; these numbers are written in red pen, and are not circled. A previous foliation sequence between ff 6-222, which is also written in pencil and circled, has been superseded and therefore crossed out.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The volume consists mostly of deeds of land sales in Arabic, dating from 7 February 1913 to 17 June 1921.Also contained within the volume, and seemingly unrelated, is part of a prison manual in English accompanied by a Persian translation (folios 8-34).Also unconnected to the rest of the volume is a list of individuals entering or travelling through Bahrain in December 1922 (folio 43). The table gives details of the traveller's name, reason for travel, place of origin, and intended destination.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x0002f0#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
