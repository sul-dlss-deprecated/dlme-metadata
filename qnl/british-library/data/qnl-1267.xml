With regard to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox’s suggestion, supported by you, that Sir W. Willcocks should again be consulted as to the dependence of the date groves of the Shat-el-Arab on the silt from the Karim, it appears to me that, in view of the fact that he definitely stated to Lieutenant Wilson last year that he had modified the opinion which he expressed in 1909 on this point, and of the numerous other considerations now put forward which show that the scheme is impracticable in any case, is hardly necessary to refer the question to him again. With reference to the final paragraph of your despatch relative to the probable receipt of a further communication from the Netherland Government on this subject, I have to state that so far no such communication has reached me. In the event, however, of the Netherland Government reopening the question, I propose to explain to them frankly what are, in the opinion of experts, the objections to the scheme, and to inform them that His Majesty’s Government cannot bring pressure to bear on the sheikh to undertake a work from which, as it appears, he can hope to derive no pecuniary advantage. ^ .

Sir, Tehran, December 22, 1910. , ' WITH reference to the note addressed to yon by the Netherlands Legation on the 1° j 21st October last on the subject of the Karun irrigation, I have the honour to transmit copy of a despatch from His Majesty’s consul-general at Bushire, forwarding a despatch from His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah on this subject. It will be noticed that since Sir W. Willcocks expressed the view in the spring of last year that an irrigation scheme on the Karun would damage the date groves on the Shat-el-Arab (see my telegram No. 323 of the 25th April, 1909), he appears to have modified his opinions on this point. Apart from the possible damage to these date groves Lieutenant Wilson urges other objections, which seem much to the point, to the execution in the near future of any project of irrigation from the waters of the Karan. Nevertheless, it might be worth while, as suggested by Colonel Cox, to obtain from Sir W. Willcocks a further statement in regard to the dependence of the date groves on the Shat-el-Arab on silt from the Karun. I am sending this despatch by post to avoid delay, as the Netherlands Legation’s note seems to foreshadow a further communication. (No. 86. Confidential.) Sir, Bushire, November 20, 1910. WITH reference to the correspondence on the subject of the Karun irrigation question, ending with Mr. Louis Mallet’s letter of the 18th August, 1910, to Baron Gericke, I have the honour to submit, for your information, a copy of a communication received from His Majesty’s acting consul at Mohammerah, wherein he summarises the present aspects of the scheme—aspects which, on the whole, are not attractive. As regards the slip, or misunderstanding, in Mr. Mallet’s letter involved in his reference to Karun “ water ” instead of Karun “ silt,” it seems unnecessary to draw attention to it by telegram, in view of the fact that three months have elapsed since the letter was written. It could be explained if the question was revived again. It is unfortunate, however, that Sir William Willcocks’s modification of view in regard to the bearing of the silt question was not known before ; and as this point is a fundamentally important one, I would suggest that Sir William be specifically asked, with reference to the opinion expressed by him after his visit to the Karun in 1909, whether he still holds the same view or has some reason to modify it by the light of local experience since acquired. The subject of the Karkheh scheme was discussed between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and Mr. Wilson and myself at my last visit, and I shall revert to it independently at an early opportunity. I have, &amp;c. G. BARCLAY. Enclosure 1 in No. 1. Lieutenant-Colonel Cox to Sir G. Barclay. I have, &amp;c. P. Z. COX, Political Resident in the Persian Gulf and Consul-General for Ears, &amp;c. [1845 d—5]2 Lieutenant Wilson to Lieutenant-Colonel Cox. Sir, Mohammerah, November 1, 1910. I VENTURE to submit the following remarks on the subject of the Karm irrigation scheme, enumerating the principal objections thereto, and giving reasons for my belief that at present, and for many years to come, the scheme is one not likely to be profitable or even practicable. Much has been written on the subject. A scheme has been prepared in detail by Major W. R. Morton, R.E.; M. van Roggen has outlined his proposals, which were stigmatised by Major Morton as fantastic; and Sir W. Willcocks has also given us the benefit of his valuable expert opinion on the question. Nevertheless, a memorandum recounting briefly the disadvantages of the scheme may not be without utility, even if it only serves to disillusionise the Netherland Government as to the lucrative nature of the proposal. 2. According to the plans and estimates prepared by Major W. R. Morton, R.E., in 1907, the cost of the Karun River irrigation scheme works at 70 lakhs of rupees = 450,000/. Left bank— Irritable Annually irrigable Acres. 250.000 150.000 Net annual revenue on capital, 8 per cent. Financially, this is not attractive ; it is improbable that capital for such a scheme could be raised for less than 8 per cent, in view of the risks involved and the lack of any guarantee that the scheme will have the whole-hearted support of the central and local Persian authorities; and in Major Morton’s report nothing will be found to justify a more optimistic estimate than that put forward by him. Navigation of Karun. 3. Expert local opinion does not support Major Morton’s contention that the irrigation scheme could be carried out without affecting navigation : on the contrary, it is generally considered that any substantial diminution in the present water supply will render navigation by river steamers impossible. It is not enough to secure a minimum all the year round ; it is necessary also to retain the floods which clear out the river and cut through the sand-banks which form right across its bed during the summer. Sir W. Willcocks gave it as his opinion in January 1910, though he has not, I think, recorded it in writing, that for the irrigation scheme to be a success the attempt to retain river navigation must be abandoned ; and everything seems to point in that direction. Type of Lam. 4. Sir W Willcocks considers the needle dam suggested by Major W. R. Morton, R.E., unsuitable for the country, and thinks a more elaborate dam, built for use if necessary as a weir, with sluice-gates, preferable. This would raise the total estimated cost to 500,000/. Population. 5. To cultivate the lands irrigated by the new canals a large additional population would be required ; allowing ten acres per family, 15,000 additional families would be needed—say, 75,000 souls. piesent population of Arabistan is about 250,000 ; those under the jurisdiction of the sheikh, 150,000 ; a sudden increase of 50 per cent, in the population now under him would therefore be a condition essential for the success of the work. It is improbable that more than 2,000 families could be induced to settle on the newly- irrigated lands, even on most favourable terms. The Arab of the province is indolent and prosperous few uncivilised races are equally so. Dates, rice, and, generally, wheat grow with a minimum of care and labour on his part. The alternative, colonisation by Persians, is one extremely distasteful to Arabs, and is not favoured by the sheikh, who views with not unnatural apprehension the results of a large and sudden influx into his territories.3 r&lt; J, t5t- 0 Sheikh of Mohammeralis Attitude. 6. Sheikh Sir Khazal Khan, K.C.I.E., to whom, by royal firman of 1903, the land on the left bank of the Karun belongs, would prefer not to see the Karan irrigation scheme actively pressed, for the present, at all events. He is not convinced that the probable profits to be gained therefrom are sufficient to make^ it worth his while to invest money in the scheme; he feels the capital expenditure involved 500,0001. too large to be prudently incurred as things now stand, and he fails to see the need for the scheme. There is no pressure of population : on the contrary, vast areas lie untilled and, even near Mohammerah, unirrigated for lack of labour. Only force of circumstances will induce the sheikh to take an active interest in the scheme, and it may be expected that his claims in dual capacity of sole land-owner and tribal head will prove a serious burden upon the exiguous estimated net profit. Effect of Irrigation Scheme on Date Groves of Mohammerah. 7. Since Sir W. Willcocks expressed the opinion (referred to in Foreign Office despatch of the 18th August, 1910, to the Dutch Minister in London) that an irrigation scheme on the Karun would damage the date groves of the Shat-el-Arab, he has been able to study the question in greater detail, and when he stayed with me for a fortnight at the commencement of 1910, he informed me that he had greatly modified, if not wholly altered, his views on the point, and was inclined to believe that the influence of the Karun silt is far less than he had at first believed. The Bussorah date gardens are superior to those of Mohammerah, yet the former do not benefit by Karim silt, which is not carried up stream more than six miles by the tide, whilst the latter have the benefit of Karun water all the year round. The following is an extract from the last paragraph of the Foreign Office despatch quoted above:— “ It appears, from expert opinion . . . . , that as the sheikh’s own date groves on the Shat-el-Arab at present depend for water almost entirely on what they receive from the Karun, serious injury would be inflicted on the trees if they were depiived of this supply before irrigation from the Tigris and Euphrates is undertaken. Such depriva tion would apparently result from the construction of a dam at Ahwaz, while on the other hand the trees cannot, as far as His Majesty’s Government’s present information goes, receive from the Tigris and Euphrates till the scheme for utilising those uveis for irrigation purposes has been carried out.” This passage, as it stands, is plainly based upon a misapprehension, but if the word “ silt ” be substituted for “ water ” throughout, it substantially represents Sir W. Willcocks’s opinion in 1909, though he is no longer prepared to support the theory which he then advanced, that the Karun silt was a predominant, if not an essential factor in the prosperity of the date groves of the Shat-el-Arab. 8. The last important objection to the scheme is one to which 1 am m no_ way competent to refer, but it is necessary to mention it in any discussion on the merits of the Karun irrigation scheme. The Persian Government has heard so much of the scheme, and so many nations have at different times indicated their desire to participate in it, that the strongest objection is likely to be taken, on political grounds, to the granting of the concession for such a scheme to anybody, whether a foreign or a Persian subject, and the terms asked and the conditions demanded will probably be exorbitant, making any agreemen on the subject with the Persian Government almost impossible. ... I would conclude by reiterating my belief that the only irrigation scheme in Arabistan which is immediately practicable and profitable is that depending on t e Karkheh Piver After careful investigation on the spot of the conditions under which the scheme would have to be carried out, and with all the necessary data before him,^ i r • 1 coc s has estimated the capital expenditure necessary at 75,0001. at most, a return o 20,000b per annum from an annually irrigated area of 100,000 acres. These estimates contrast markedly with the corresponding figures for the Karun irrigation scheme. L lici/vo A. T.

The Minister's letter was sent to the Shaikh and was shown to His Maiestv's Consul by Haji Rais. No reply has been sent and none will be sent.

Mr. Mallet to Baron Gericke. My dear Minister, _ ^ Foreign Office, August 18, 1910. IN the course of our conversation on the 5th August on the subject of the Karun irrigation scheme, you told me that M. van Roggen had approached Mr. Lynch with reference to this question, and had been informed by him that it would be necessary, in order to carry out the project, to obtain a concession from the Persian Government, and that, as it was certain that the Persian Medjliss would give no concession to a British subject, it would have to be obtained in the name of a Motherland subject. You added that M. van Roggen proposed to go himself to Mohammerah and arrange matters with the Sheikh. I replied that I concurred as to the necessity of a concession, and added that any communication with the Sheikh must be made through His Majesty’s Government. I have informed Sir Edward Grey of what passed between us on the occasion referred to, and am authorised by him to say how highly he appreciates the loyal attitude adopted by your Government in this matter, and to explain to you the stand point of His Majesty’s Government with equal frankness. In May of last year the Sheikh of Mohammerah made to His Majesty’s Government a proposal that, as regards that portion of the proposed irrigation works depending on the construction of a dam at Ahwaz, they should help him to induce the Persian Government to grant a concession to him in his name only, on which he would engage to depend solely on British assistance. As regards such minor works as would be independent of any dam at Ahwaz, he stated that he was prepared to undertake schemes of that nature himself without reference to the Persian Government, giving priority to British concessionnaires recommended by His Majesty’s Government, and applying to Great Britain for any external help of a financial or expert nature which he might require. In the following month, His Majesty’s Government informed the Sheikh in reply that they took note of his declarations, both as regards the concession for works depending on the Ahwaz dam and the minor operations, and that they would give him their support and approval in his application for a concession for the construction of the dam when the opportune moment arrived for such a step. In view of the fact that the Sheikh desires the concession for himself, as shown by the above declarations, His Majesty’s Government would find themselves obliged to oppose the grant of it to a Netherland company ; but when the Sheikh is ready to act, and the moment appears opportune for him to do so, they will be prepared to advise him to admit a share of Netherland capital—up to, let us say, one-fourth of the whole. Sir E. Grey hopes that this proposal (which, he begs, may be considered as given for the confidential information of the Netherland Government, and not for communi cation to capitalists who may have been approached by M. van Roggen) may be considered to offer a basis for a satisfactory solution of the question. I may add that the question of an opportune moment for an application to the Persian Government will eventually have to be considered, and that, in this connection, l it appears from expert opinions, which have been received here, that, as the Sheikh’s own date groves on the Sha\t-el-Arab at present depend for 'Water almost entirely on what they receive from the Karun, serious injury would be inflicted on the trees if they were deprived of this supply before irrigation from the Tigris and Euphrates is undertaken. Such deprivation would apparently result from the construction of a dam at Ahwaz, while, on the other hand, the trees cannot, as far as His Majesty’s Government’s present information goes, receive water from the Tigris and Euphrates till the scheme for utilising those rivers for irrigation purposes has been carried out.

WITH reference to my telegram No. 277 of to-day’s date, I have the^ honour to report that M. van Oudendijk called on me yesterday afternoon, and said that he wished to know whether His Majesty’s Government would raise any obstacle to a Dutch syndicate applying for the concession for irrigation works at Ahwaz in virtue of the option obtained by M. de Stiirler in January 1909 (see Sir G. Barclay’s despatch No. 9 of the 22nd January, 1909). He said that he understood that His Majesty’s Government were only anxious to be- assured that no third Power was behind the Dutch group, and he coidd assure me that ^ this was not the case; the Dutch syndicate hoped that at least one-half of the capital would be British and the remainder Dutch, and in the circumstances he presumed that { there would be no objection. I said I thought that he correctly described the attitude of His Majesty’s Government towards the project, but that I could not of course give him any answer until you had been consulted, and suggested that the proper course would be for the Netherlands Minister in London to sound you. M. van Oudendijk, however, begged me to telegraph to you. _ . • i p i- In answer to my questions, M. van Oudendijk said that the revival oi this scheme had been mooted not by himself, but by a member of the Medjliss, whose name he was obviously disinclined to reveal, but he could not say whether the Dutch syndicate had already found any financial backing in England ; so far as he knew, the only attempt to do so had been made to Mr. Lynch by M. van Roggen, a Dutch engineer from the Dutch East Indies, who made a survey at Ahwaz in January 1905. It will be within your recollection that this gentleman’s work was adversely criticised by Major Morton, who was deputed by the Government of India to examine the prospects of successful irrigation in the interests of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. M van Oudendijk seemed to possess a very limited acquaintance of the question, and appeared to think that the site of the contemplated works was m Bakhtian He concluded by saying that he had reason to believe that the acquisition of the concession would be rendered easier if the Persian Government were left under tlie impression that the enterprise was purely Dutch, and he therefore asked that His Majesty’s Legation would show no interest m it. n I presume that if the Dutch syndicate are able to satisfy His Majesty s Govern ment as to the origin of the capital to be invested, it would be difficult to raise objections to the scheme being pursued here, more especially as irrigation works are not among those which we have specified as affecting our political or strategic interests.

WITH reference to Lord Acton’s despatch No. 7, Commercial, of the~20th January last, I have the honour to report that, referring to the observations made by the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs in the recently published “ Orange Book ” on the subject of Dutch diplomatic representation in Persia, and the concession reported to have been granted by the Persian Government for irrigation works on the Karun River at Ahwaz (see precis enclosed in my despatch No. 170 of the 8th instant), M. Graadt van Roggen, the Dutch engineer who is responsible for the plan of irrigation in question, in an article in the “ Nieuwe Courant,” urges the importance in the interests of his scheme of the post of Tehran being once more filled by a diplomatic representative, who will be able to obtain from the new Government in Persia compen sation for the failure of its predecessor to fulfil its obligations towards the Netherlands Minister at Tehran. According to the writer of the article, a concession was given verbally to M. Sturler, former Netherlands Minister at Tehran, for the construction^ of works for the irrigation of 500,000 hectares (1,235,550 acres) of arable land for a period of ninety-nine years, under special conditions. The Persian Government afterwards retracted, and in the place of the verbal concession they gave a distorted written declaration which was of no value. In the opinion of the writer, the moment is opportune for obtaining the concession, now that the Young Persians are glad, of an opportunity to show that they have broken with the old regime and are anxious to proceed on a path of progress. M. Graadt van Roggen points out the necessity for prompt action in view of the competition to be expected from foreign countries, whose attention has been attracted by the attempt of the Dutch to obtain the above concession. He refers to the activity of other countries in the Arabistan district (in which Ahwaz is situated), and states that a Franco-Persian Company has been formed with the object of bringing into cultivation the plain of Arabistan, or at least a part of it; and also that the Persian Oil Company has offered to advance a sum of money to the Governor of Arabistan for the irrigation of the district along the banks of the Shaoer, a tributary of the Karun River. Some definite concession must, the writer of the article points out, be obtained by the Dutch from the Persian Government, otherwise no Government financiers will interest themselves in the Karun irrigation scheme, nor could a syndicate be formed as suggested by the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs in the “ Orange Book ” above referred to.

For the actual collection and preparation of the material I am indebted to Lieutenart A. T. Wilson. The documents, though very interesting, appear to stand in little need of comment by me. It is impossible to question their authenticity, and I think there is little reason to suspect that they are other than an exposition of actual facts, or at least of the genuine beliefs of those who have contributed to their production. It will be seen that they directly traverse the assurances given to His Britan nic Majesty’s Minister by the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs, to the effect that no actual Concession had been granted, but only an option for two years. 3. With regard to the “ Rapport ” it is of course impossible to assert that it has formed the basis for the terms of the Concession now granted ; but the fact that though unsigned it was undoubtedly written by Von Roggen and that Von Roggen in now writing to ter Meulen after mentioning some of the conditions of the Concession says, “these conditions, in addition to some others, are practically my own,” renders it probable that the Concession as a whole is adapted to the re quirements of the “ Rapport ”. If this is so, and if paragraph 12 of the “Draft of clauses and conditions for the Concession of etc.,” to a private company which contemplates the payment of a million francs to the Persian Government on the agreement being signed has been observed, it can be readily understood that in his present circumstances the Shah would have been willing enough to furnish his signature. To this immediate inducement have to be added the prospective 5,000,000 francs loan which is provided for in the estimated capital in article 10 of the proposition for the formation of a company, and the annual rents on an in creasing scale which are promised after the scheme has begun to take practical shape. 4. I have already forwarded copies of the enclosed papers to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, and am now forwarding another set to His Majesty’s Minister at Tehran. To the latter I am also sending a copy of the article in the form of a cutting from the “ Nieuwe Courant ”. I have only been able to obtain one cutting, and it is more likely to be of use at Tehran, than at Bushire or here. 895 F. D. 1 &lt;2 Abridged translation of an article in li De Nieuwe Courant of 16th January 1909, also reproduced in Provinciale Overijsselsche en Zwollsche Courant” of \%th January 1909 {Holland). {Dictated by M. P. ter Meiden, Ahwaz.) A Netherlands Interest. We have frequently referred to the efforts of our valiant countryman Graaf D. T. Von Roggen, who, until a short time ago, was a Consulting Engineer in the Persian State Service, and is now at The Hague. We have also noticed his efforts to arrange that, by irrigation works near Ahwaz on the Karun, a country now waste might be restored to its former fertility. V'O have also entered in some detail into this question from a technical point of \iew, e.nd we may presume that the broad outlines of the plan are known. But in our last morning edition we published the news that the Shah has at last signed a Concession giving the right to a company that is to be recommended by the Dutch Government to execute the above plan. This news is, for us Hol landers as well as for the promoters, of such importance that we feel bound to give further details, and it is a lucky circumstance that we have got information from the soul of the enterprise, Graaf D. T. Von Roggen. We need not enlarge on the trouble he had to induce the Shah to finance the preliminary investigations, but we will approach the subject by remarking that this is par excellence a Netherlands interest in Persia, an interest that will at once make itself known by the digging that has to be done and the construction of canals and of the large storage barrage at Ahwaz. The latter will be made of reinforced concrete with moveable metal sluice gates, and the construction of this dam alone will give a fillip to our concrete and iron industries, whilst our steam excavators will also be in demand ; electric light must also be installed, but the dynamos and turbines must come from abroad. For the transport of all this a Dutch line of steamers may be employed. The Concession is for 99 years, so we must not be too nervous in starting such a great business, as it is for a century, and our ancest ors will have the benefit. Lots of new materials, steam ploughs, etc., now ordered from America, which plough, sow and harrow 100 acres in a few hours will also be in demand from Holland. The Concession covers 500,000 hectares. This enormous area is avail able for the growth of wheat and cotton and Dutch steamers may compete to take wheat to Karachi and Europe and cotton to Bombay. As concerns the trade, a separate company might be formed, but our friends, the well-known firm of P. ter Meulen and Gratama is established at Ahwaz and may perhaps take this over. Our Dutch workmen could be employed extensively on the works, as the climate is good ; though for six months it is very hot, for the rest of the year it is cool, and in the hot weather one can work at night, for which purpose electric light would at once be installed. It is a distinguishing feature of the Concession that every one can participate in it, and this was the special condition insisted on by the Shah, with which I agree, as it removes any possibility of exclusiveness. The only conditions that were insisted on by us w~ere that the company was to have its head-quarters in Holland, and that the technical stall should be Hollanders. Let us show some of our old energy, as in the days when we first established commercial enterprises in Persia. The Dutch are popular, the Belgians have had their day. The work is in the hands of Agricultural Holland. If we succeed in the enterprise, we shall get others, such as coal and gold, and the petroleum springs might also be explored. But for all these enterprises money is necessary. The expenses of floating the company which will have to construct the works in the first place, are about £1| million sterling (15,000,000 guilders). A dividend in the second year is not to be expected ; great enterprises require time to develop, but I calculated that in 10 or 12 years time at the outside a dividend of 10 or 12 per cent, will be obtained.I repee.t that the Concession is for a century, and whole generations may benefit by it. Let us hope that our countrymen will rise to the occasion and not be so short-sighted as they often are. Abridged translat on of a letter from M. Van Roggen to M. ter Meulen, dated The Hague, February 1909. (Dictated by M. P. ter Meulen, Ahwaz.) . Recent events have afforded me an occasion for renewing my correspondence with you. Regarding the irrigation scheme, the Syndicate must be formed within two years, and the Concession is for 99 years. The General Manager in Europe, the Secretary, and the Chief Engineer at Ahwaz must be Dutch. The offices of the company must be in Holland under Dutch jurisdiction. Not more than one-third of the trustees may be of the same nationality. Foreign financiers may partici pate freely in the company. The Concession covers 500,000 hectares and coven the execution of the neces sary works in rivers and on the bank : 3 on the condition that navigation in summer be not interfered with in any way. The Concession may have their own police, which will be recognised by Persian and Arab authorities. All differences will be settled amicably. These condition', in addition to some others, are practically my own, and have been arranged by me in conversation with M. de Sturler. On 11th January M. de Sturler received a telegram at The Hague, staling that the Concession had been signed. On 15th I had an audience with the Netherlands Minister for Foreign Affairs, who promised me every assistance, and I am sure the* j he will keep his word. I have known him long. You may do much to assist this enterprise, and I would ask you to visit Shaikh Khazz al and tell him quietly that the Persian Government have granted a Concession to the Dutch Government to form this Syndicate, and that the action of the Persian Government has the approval of the British, R is: Hn, and German Government '., and that the matter is not one that can be dealt with lightly by him. We trust that when the “ Commission ” ar ives in Arabistan to treat with Shaikh Khazz’al about an eventual agreement they will find him amenable. We fully agree that without his assistance the execution of the work might be accompanied with trouble, and so the Commission will no doubt make proposals advantageous to him and to his heirs, for the Concession lasts for 99 years, w e have no desire but to live and work in harmony with him. Try to find out en 'passant what he wants, and try to convince him that he will 9e paid part in cash and part m shares. As regards myself, I may mention that my name has been mentioned as Adviser to the Department of Public Works of the Persian Government, and should this come about I shall be able to direct the irrigation project from Tehran. If only we show more tact than the Belgians we may fairly expect to obtain a fair hold upon Persia.

P. ter Meulen and Lieutenant A. 1 . Wilson on 6 th March 1909. Irrigation Scheme—M. P. ter Meulen mentioned that Shaikh Hanzel visited him on the 3rd instant, and referring to the irrigation scheme said that all the land on both banks of the Karun and Abadan Island were granted to the Shaikh by firman in 1901 on payment of £17,000 by Haji Rais wlm was then m Tehran. The Shaikh would, he said, have to be reckoned with m consequence, and he asked ter Meulen to go down with him at once to Faihya to see him.fa Ter Meulen told me that he replied that he was leaving for Europe about 15th instant and when in Mohammareh would see the Shaikh, and he expressed doubts as to the validity of Shaikh Khazz’ahs claim. Ter Meulen, in the course of conversation, said that he did not know at all whether the alleged purchase had really taken place, but that he greatly doubted it. He appeared to be under the impression that in accordance with the Syndicate’s Concession, 500,000 hectares of land became vested in them, subject to their paying presumably an agreed rent to the Persian Government, and that as a necessary con sequence the whole produce would be theirs. He seemed to realise the necessity of British support if the company was to be a success, and announced his intention of publishing a resume of the article referred to above in the English newspapers. He excused the injfaccuracies of Van Roggen’s article by saying that it was a ballon d’essai written to interest people, but he seemed to be unaware of the fact that the Concession Syndicate, Limited, have the sole right to work oil in Southern Persia. Oil Company Affairs .—Ter Meulen remarked that Shaikh Hanzal particularly mentioned Abadan Island with the deliberate intention, he thought, of inducing him to inform Mr. Reynolds, Manager of the Concession Syndicate, Limited, of the fact. This involves the not improbable assumption that Shaikh Hanzal, like M. ter Meulen, is aware of the secret intentions of the Oil Company with regard to Abadan Island. A. T.

My mission to the South. —The undersigned,* an engineer in the Persian State * Presumably Van Roggen, the report is Service, was eng?*ged to make hydraulic unsigned. studies, and if necessary to direct the cons truction of works, and was ordered to proceed to Arabistan in order to report on the condition of agriculture and irrigation in that part of Persia, and to make proposals to re-establish the old state of things and bring agair under cultiva tion a part or the whole of that country. 895 F. D.6 I left for the Stete in the summer of 1903, and on my return in the summer of 1904 was convinced that Arabistan was a fertile country with a great future I therefore anriUed for fresh credits to enable me to go there again with severa 1 therefore -pp 1 , , r, aT ticularly the vicinity of Ahwaz, which I assistants, to map the country, particularly . considered best adapted for agricultural enterprise on a large scale. This credit was given me bv the Shah, and in the autumn of 1904 I went Egypt and Bombay to Ahwaz, picking up information e» route regarding the cul- Son of cotton ’ and wheat, and saw the great barrages of Cairo and Assiut, which with a few modifications will serve as models for the big dam at Ahwaz. In the summer of 1905, I returned to Europe having finished my studies in Arabistan, and I presented a preliminary jiroposal for future work to the Shah when on his visit to France in that year. The Karun (no importance). It is evident that it is an important essential to the success of the enterprise that the volume of water in the river he always sufficient for naviga tion and my investigations have given a result which will assure this under all possible conditions. In fact one must take water for irrigation only m those months when the quantity is in excess of that strictly necessary for navigations. The old barrage was so constructed that the water was raised up to the level of the top of the dam, over which it flowed to the lower level. This barrage was about 1,000 yards long. This barrage was destroyed about 600 years ego and since then the water could only enter the canals during a few months of the year. Gradually these canals silted up and are now not used at all New Scheme. 1 To remove the remains of the old dam and build a new one in the same place ' the new barrage being formed by a number of piers between which will be placed moveable doors. A bridge will be constructed on these piers from bank to bank. The difference of level above and below the dam will suffice to work a number of turbines, actuating dynamos to provide electric light, and power to work dredgers, steam excavators, etc. 2. To dm a canal and construct sluices and gates and thus re-establish communication between the upper and lower rivers. This is essential as the dam will stop through navigation. From this canal another will take off to lead the water of the river to other canals which will serve to irrigate the lands. All these canals are of very great dimensions and may be considered rather as reservoirs than as canals. The water will be taken from the river during flood time and will be stored in these canals for use in the dry season. 3. To divide the land between the Ahwaz hills, the Karun and the Jarrahi into unit areas (unitis), each unit having a net surface of 3,000 hectares (7,400 acres). One unit will be cultivated in the first year, Two more ditto second year, Three more will be cultivated in the third, and so on, so that the maximum area, provisionally fixed at 100,000 hectares or 14,000,000 jaribs (about 470 sq. miles) will be cultivated in 35 years. Plan of Operations. ls£ year .—Complete barrage and part of the power station sufficient to work dredgers and excavators. 2nd year .—Begin canals of 1st unit and complete in autumm. In autumn of this year the first unit will be sown.When the 1st unit canals have been finished the machines, etc., will be removed to the 2 nd unit for the excavation of its canals. 3rd year .—In the summer of the third year 1st crop of 1st unit will be obtained, and in the autumn of this year the 2 nd unit, after the completion of the canals, will be sown.

We should first turn our attention to the cultivation of cotton, but in view of the strong demand for wheat in Europe as well as in Persia, and considering the famines which recur every year in British India, I think that the cultivation of wheat on a large scale is equally urgent. ****** , Quatsttity of Products. According to average result? in Egypt and America, I calculate the produce of a unit per annum as follows:— Wheat .. • • .. .. .. • • 3,400 tons metric. Cotton .. . * • • • • • • .. 750 „ „ Each unit would be divided into two equal parts, yielding- 1st year 2nd year Hence we get following quantities 1st crop .. .'. .. 11,000 kharvars wheat 2nd ,, •* •• •• 22,000 „ „ 3rd „ • • • • * • 33,000 ,, „ • • , And so on. These figures are approximate. Bebahan cotton has a good reputation and the quality could no doubt be im proved. These vast quantities cannot be obtained by old methods, and it is there fore necessary to introduce a new system by utilizing machines, which will be im ported from America. In this way cultivation on a large scale, as in the United States of America, where large areas are cultivated by a few hands, will be possible. I therefore recommend the use of machines for cultivating the soil, and not the old methods. Machines plung. to a depth of 1 foot, as against 4 inches at present. Machine can also be used for har\ estmg. As the population in Arabistan is insufficient to a larg ® ™ 01 P’ the Government will have to put at our disposal 2,000 or 3 000 soldiers to help. The value of the crop of one unit is 750,000 francs at London prices. The j t ^ nnn f+hrpp thousand! hectares is 15,000,000 francs, cost of preparing one unit of 3,000 (three thousanu; u ’ , f _ but this is only in the first year, when the grounds are first prepared for cuitiva tion.

Following for Bushire :— “ Newly-formed Anglo-Persian Oil Company wish to acquire immediately site for refinery on Island of Abadan, and strip of land for pipeline to connect refinery with wells. Land selected for refinery is estimated not over 1,000 acres, said to be unculti- voted, as is most of that which will be occupied by pipeline, and Company are entitled by terms of Concession to acquire waste land free of cost. Company recognize, however, that good-will and co-operation of Sheikh are necessary, and are willing to lend him from 5,000Z. to 6,000k through His Majesty’s Government on condition that he grants application for land, and gives or procures good title to it on Company’s behalf. Company are ready to pay reasonable market value for land if bought, or 500/. per annum in full all land required, if leased for duration of Concession or any extension of it. Company would demand 6 per cent, interest on their loan. His Majesty’s Government Avould make every effort to insure payment of interest and sinking fund (if one is formed) by Sheikh, but do not undertake financial liability for payment if money is not forthcoming. “Sheikh should be told that His Majesty’s Government are willing to advance to him 5,000/. or 6,000/. on the understanding that he concludes arrangement with Oil Company on above terms, and that he grants to British Company a Concession containing an exclusive right to carry out scheme of irrigation from Karum on lines proposed by Sir W. Wilcocks. “You should be careful to represent advance as coming from His Majesty’s Government.” [453—292]*&gt; It ' Inclosure 2 in No, 1. Memorandum of Conversation between^ Consul McDouall and Sardar Arfa regarding Ahwaz Irrigation, January 27, 1909. ^ I GAVE the Sardar Arfa the information contained in Legation telegrams to Assistant Resident, Bushire, and asked for his views. , .... He recalled that Sir A. Hardinge advised him that any opposition to an irrigation scheme should be made by him in the name of the tribesmen and unless the Concession were in his hands the Arabs would undoubtedly prevent it being earned out. He could inform the Persian Government of this, either direct or through the Legation, hut would like to know our views, and would like instructions ( dastur el amal ”) from the Legation as to his action, as was done in the case of the establish ment of the customs. I pointed out that at_ present things were not far enough advanced ; it was only an option and the Legation had reserved the right to object. As to his views on the subject, he thought it would he better that the Ahwaz barrage scheme should not he carried out, hut if not now it would be some day. _ T ere were other less costly schemes. If the loan discussed with Major Cox on his last visit could be arranged he would try to obtain through Nizam-es-Sulteneh (Sardar Mukarrem), who claims it, the right to Nahr Hashem, and restore the Kerkha or at least the Shawur irrigation. The Nahr Hashem dam only broke some seventy-five years ago, and if rebuilt the old canals could easily be repaired by the tribesmen. I the Ahwaz barrage had to he made, the country belongs to him and his tribesmen, and the latter would certainly object, and if foreigners or Persians tried to make it, would l prevent them. If he obtained the Concession he could only work it if assisted by ! British capital, and in that case he could gradually persuade the tribesmen to acquiesce by promising them irrigated land on easy terms or other concessions, and peisuadmg them that it was in the tribal interest to have the works carried out, which vould take time. In no case could he compel them by force to agree—that would upset the whole tribal organization, and reduce the country to the lawless state of other ports, which up to now had been avoided, and would seriously affect othei British enterprises on the Narun or its neighbourhood. I impressed on him the necessity of keeping us fully informed on the subject and of his views. He said that he quite agreed to that, but placed himself in the hands of the Legation, and looked to them to^keep him informed and to instruct him what On the 29th, on reading above to Sardar Arfa, he wished to add that if he himself had the capital to make the Ahwaz dam he would not require a Concession, as it is his or his tribesmen’s own land, hut to satisfy foreign capital it would be necessary. He later sent Haji Rais Tujar, who said that the Sardar Arfa had heard nothing whatever from the Persian Government on this subject since the present Shah s accession. As now, they have given the option of a Concession without telling him they may later give the Concession without his knowledge. Therefore he thinks it advisable to telegraph to the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who is with the Shah, that the Arabs are disturbed by a talk of Concessions to foreigners in Ahwaz neighbourhood, and if such were given they would not agree to it; if Government gives such Concession they w r ould throw over (“ sarfi nazar az ”) 50,000 Arabs. He would like to know at once if the Legation approves of his sending such a telegram. The Government would probably deny that they had any intention of giving a Concession which would be a sort of bond (“ sanad ”/in his hands for future use. (Signed) W.

SUBJECT.[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government,] respectively, I have the honour to transmit a copy of the document furnished hy the Minister for Foreign Affairs to^ M. de Sturler, late Dutch Minister at Tehran, granting him a two years option from the 10th instant for an “ exploitation concession at Ahwaz. L also transmit a copy of the note which 1 addressed to Saad-ed-Dowleh under the instructions contained in your telegram No. 28 of the 21st January, stating that His Majesty’s Government reserved the right to oppose the concession. The document granted to M:. de Sturler is dated only two or three days after Saad-ed-Dowleh took office, and two months after M. de ‘Sturler had left Tehran on transfer to Athens. My Russian colleague, who is in charge of Dutch interests, tells me that he knew nothing of any negotiations on the subject. It is not improbable, therefore, that the option was the result of some private arrangement between M. de Sturler and Saad-ed-Dowleh, by which the latter, in return for the protection afforded him by M. de Sturler when he took bast at the Dutch Legation in December 1907, remaining there until June 1908, undertook, if he ever came to office, to get him the concession which he had for so long been trying to secure. I should mention, however, that when I spoke to Saad-ed-Dowleh about it,°he told me that it was owing to his influence that only an option had been given, for he had urged that no concession should he granted until a Syndicate was formed to take it up. Said-ed-Dowleh, who laid stress on the fact that we had never opposed M. de Sturler’s efforts to obtain the concession, promised to keep me informed of further develop ments, though I presume that for the moment these are more likely to occur at Tlie Hague than here. Saad-ed-Dowleh denies that any money was paid for the option.

Lord Acton to Sir Edicard Grey.—(Heceived January 21.) hAi 'h • Commercial.) (No. 7. Si r i f- The Hague, January 20, 1909. WITH reference to my despatch No. 101 of the 8th May, 1907, I have the honour to report that a recent telegram from Tehran to the “ Cologne Gazette ” announcing the grant by the Shah of a Concession to a Dutch Company for executing the project of irrigation in South-West Persia is causing no small satisfaction in the Netherland press. The message in question states that this enterprise, which will include the work of damming the Kiver Karim at Ahwaz, reposes on the conclusion of a previous under standing between Holland and England. The shares of the Company about to be formed will he placed on the German and other markets as well as on those of London and Amsterdam. The above report doubtless indicates the inception of the scheme long cherished by M. Graadt van Koggen, the Dutch engineer until recently employed by the Persian Government, whose name is already known to you, for irrigating the Ahwaz district and restoring it to its former fertile condition. In an interview published by the “ Nieuwe Courant ” the Dutch engineer aforesaid observes that the execution of the work will entail considerable labour, such as excavating operations and the construction of canals. It will, however, he productive of far-reaching results for ihe agricultural, shipping, and other industries of the Netherlands. The construction of a lock of armoured concrete with movable ir&lt;&gt;n gates at the Karun rapids at Ahwaz will give employment to the iron foundries and concrete factories of Holland, while the work of excavating will be done by Dutch hands, and Dutch electric engineers will supply the plant and fittings for lighting the district. No doubt it will be necessary to procure dynamos and water turbines from abroad—probably from Germany or Switzerland—as they are not manufactured in the Netherlands. Similarly, agricultural implements of large calibre will, at the outset, at any rate, have to be supplied from America. When once the drained area has been prepared for cultivation by these powerful mechanical contrivances a large exportation of grain and cotton will assuredly follow. M. Graadt van Poggen likewise anticipates that Dutch vessels will receive the transport trade in connection with the new venture. The duration of the Concession, which is for ninety-nine years, will secure to more than a single generation the benefits to he derived from the enterprise. By the navigation of the Shatt-el-Arab by Dutch steam-boats as far as Mohammerah the carrying trade of Russian goods may fall to the Netherland flag. The prophetic vision of this enthusiast further sees cargoes of grain bringing relief to the famine-stricken districts of British India, and bales of cotton being consigned from the reclaimed desert to the looms of Bombay. It is stated in the press that by the terms of the Concession equality of opportunity will be accorded to all; it was, however, also stipulated that the head-quarters of the Company shall be in Holland, that the Directors should be of Dutch nationality, and that the conduct of all technical matters in Persia should be in Dutch hands. It remains to be seen whether M. Graadt van Roggen, who is at present at The Hague, will now return to Persia on behalf of the new Company. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ACTON.

Barclay, His Majesty’s Minister at Teher an, that a two years* option for the con cessioni conceBSion for the Karun irrigation has been given to a Dutch Syndicate In view of the fact that important British interests, more particularly of a political nature would he involved in this undertaking. His Majesty’s Govern ment must remind the Netherland Governmen that they can support no scheme which is not favourably viewed by the Sheikh of Mo- hammerah or which is in any way prejudi cial to their interests. I should, therefore, be glad if you would be so good as to inform me of the nature and scope of the negotiations which are reported to be in progress on this subject.CONFIDENTIAL. 2~£) Sir G.

If it be attempted the Arab cultivators would prevent it, unless he held Concession himself and influenced them; but any attempt to coerce them would be disastrous. “He could take up Concession if promised British capital to work it.

He considers it would be advisable for him to wire to Persian Government that Arabs are disturbed by rumours of foreign irrigation Concession and will not agree to it, and warn Persian Government of danger of giving any such Concession. “ He asks whether you would approve his doing so.” I have replied as follows :— “ Pray inform the Sheikh that I am glad to know his views, but that as the prospects of a Concession being granted seem to be still remote, he would act wisely in refraining for the present from making proposed communication to Persian Govern ment. You should add that I am consulting His Majesty’s Government as to what steps should be taken to safeguard his interests.” I did not know that anything more need be done here for the present.

Cox reports on 31st December he informed Sheikh of Mohammerah, after consulting Minister at Tehran, that there were no further developments. Sheikh repeated his appreciations, and begged Cox to reiterate and press on his behalf his former request for a loan for the purpose of financing a not too ambitious irrigation scheme himself, to be worked for him by a suitable British syndicate. He made this request earnestly, and asked for a reply by telegram. Cox appre hends that the news of Sturler’s concession will be serious shock to Sheikh, who has, from the first, left himself entirely in our hands, and relied on us to look after his interests. We regard situation with anxiety. Sheikh could probably make any work by concessionaire impossible if given free hand or supported. We should like to suggest that Cox should go to Mohammerah to discuss situation with Sheikh and reassure him. But he can do nothing unless fully informed as to nature and scope of Sturler’s concession, and the result of objection which His Majesty’s Government have lodged, and whether that concession can even now be cancelled or neutralized by counter concession. We trust we may be given an opportunity of expressing our views after fuller information has been received.

I have received no written reply, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me verbally that the Persian Government has no intention of granting a Concession for a foreign Company, as it is convinced that such a Concession would involve the grant of the right of foreign interference in the Karun A alley. Ihe Moin-ut-Tujar, who is acting here as the agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, called on me^ with reference to this scheme, and informed me that the Sheikh had originally desired to form a Company with one-third of its capital derived from abroad. He had since given up this idea, and now desired to form a purely Persian Company. It was. however, necessary to procure foreign expert advice, and the Sheikh had sounded Major Morton as to whether the Indian Government would allow him to act as paid adviser on irrigation matters to the Sheikh and his Persian Company. I said that I cordd give him no advice on the subject, as my Government was not inclined to take the matter up at present, but that I saw nothing to prevent the Sheikh making a proposal in the sense indicated, as long as it was understood that there were no political considerations attached to the proposal. I have informed the Russian Minister verbally of my note to the Persian Govern ment, as Avell as of the general tenour of my conversation with the Moin-ut-Tujar.

IT has come to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government that a scheme is under consideration, having for its object the concession of extensive rights to a foreign Company in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz for the purpose of constructing and operating irrigation works on the Karun. The Persian Government is well aware of the interests possessed by British subjects in that district, which have, indeed, been the subject of special orders, and of direct encouragement of His Majesty the late Shah, and of lengthy correspondence between the Governments. A project of the character above stated is evidently calculated to introduce a very considerable change, both commercial and political, in the existing situation on the Karun, and, while expressing its sincere sympathy with all projects of a nature to develop the resources of Persia, this Legation is instructed to state that, in view of the friendship which so happily subsists between the Governments of the King and the Shah, Sir E.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 121 of the 6th June and to previous corre spondence respecting the Karpn irrigation scheme, I have the honour to transmit j herewith extract from a despatch from His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah which hears \ out^the opinion of the Nizam-es-Sultaneh quoted in the final paragraph of my despatch | No. 74 of the 2nd April last that the population is insufficient to cultivate the existing' area of arable land, and Mr. McDouall’s report shows that they are disinclined to cultivate land consistently even when irrigated. Mr. McDouall is of opinion that the introduction of cultivators from elsewhere might very possibly be resented by the Arabs, and these facts seem to throw consider able doubt on the present practicability and utility of irrigation works on a large scale in the Karim district. 1 would mention in this connection that the Dutch Minister continues to have long conversations periodically with the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the subject. This, indeed, is natural enough if, as stated in the Keport of His Majesty’s Minister at The Hague, his appointment here was due to the influence of the chief promoter of the proposed Company. M. Sturler has assured me of his disinclination to allow the scheme to fall to German enterprise, but 1 understand that he approached Herr Gutmann in regard to the irrigation project during the latter’s stay in Tehran in connection with the German Bank negotiations. Herr Gutmann replied that his bank was not at all prepared to consider so extensive a scheme. I have conversed with my German colleague on the subject, and he told me perfectly frankly that, thougn no German project had been formed, he nevertheless considered it ins duty to place his Government in possession of full information regarding the commercial possibilities of South-Western Persia and of its potentialities as a field for German enterprise. With this end in view he had instructed Dr. Listermann, Secretary of the German Legation, who is at the present moment on his way to Moham merah, to furnish him with a full report. I should add that, though I attach every credence to Herr Stemrich’s denial of the existence of any German scheme, it is probable that the question of Karun irrigation is, or will shortly be, under consideration at the Dresdner Bank, although in the present financial position of Germany so large and doubtful an enterprise can hardly be taken WITH the present population there is little demand for increased irrigation in the Arab part of the province. The Sheikh finds that the fellaheen are fully occupied with the present crops. They spend November, December, and January on Karun ploughing and sowing wheat after rain \ February, March, and part ot April, cultivation of, date gardens on Shatt-el-Arab ; May, June, and July, wheat harvest, Karim; August, September, October, date harvest, Shatt-el-Arab.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 74 of the 21st April, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch, with inclosure, from His Majesty’s Consul- General at Bushire respecting the relations between the Sheikh of Mohammerah and the Moin-ut-Tujjar. The subject is of special interest as bearing upon the Karun irrigation scheme, as to the situation and prospects of which I reported fully in my above-mentioned despatch. You will observe that Sheikh Khazzal does not appear to have recently taken any further steps in the matter, but his tender, including the right to obtain foreign capital, if necessary up to one-third or one-half of the total capital, would appear to offer the most satisfactory solution, as he would in any case have to provide the labour and guarantee the security of the works. The Moin’s desire to represent himself as the Sheikh’s agent here, with full powers, is remarkable, and, coupled with his attitude towards Messrs. Lynch, seems to indicate that he intends to obtain a predominant position, if not an exclusive control, in the Karun district. In a recent conversation with Abbas Kuli Khan he spoke as if eventually he counted on being able to construct a railway by the Dizful-Khoremabad route, which, as he truly said, would be of the greatest advantage to European maritime trade, in which he himself is personally interested. I should add that the Dutch Minister has not again approached me on this subject. Herr Gutmann, Director-General of the Deutsche Orient Bank, has stated that he has not applied for a Concession for irrigating the Karun Valley, which he seems to regard as too large an undertaking for a single firm. He expressed an opinion favourable to the establishment of an international Company. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) CECIL SPKING-RICE. 1 Inclosure 1 in No. 1. Major Cox to Sir C. Spring-Hice. (No. 57.

The Sheikh replied that at present, as affairs in Tehran were unsettled, he [2501 A—12]did not see his way to doing so; He finds the Moin a useful agent to convey messages to Ministers, or to ask questions of or through, but does not trust him sufficiently to give him full powers, which he might use in his own interests.

Spring-Rice to Sir Edward Grey.—(Received May 13.) (No. 74,) gir, Tehran, April 21, 1907. WITH reference to my telegram No. 76 of the 4th instant, I have the honour to transmit herewith copy of a despatch which I have received from His Majesty’s Consul-General at Bushire, on the subject of the Karun irrigation scheme. As I informed you in my telegram above referred to, I have adopted a neutral attitude towards the Hutch project, and the determined opposition of the Sheikh of Mohammerah towards it, and his wish to combine with us to carry out the scheme, somewhat complicate matters. In view of the attitude of the National Assembly towards all foreign enterprises in Persia, any early development of the Hutch international scheme seems highly improbable. I have explained to the Netherlands Minister that the scheme cannot hope to succeed without the active assistance of the Sheikh, on whom the promoters would have to depend for labour and protection. The Sheikh will probably be in a position to dictate his own terms, unless he is interfered with from Tehran, and in that case I presume that I shall he authorized to intercede on his behalf. Meanwhile it seems likely that the Sheikh’s expressed wish, that conditions in his territory should remain as they were, will not be thwarted in the near future. I shall continue to keep Bushire informed of any developments here. I should he grateful to be informed whether Messrs. Lynch or any other British capitalist are in treaty with the promoters of the Netherlands scheme. I presume that they will not put their money into it until they have received some sort of guarantee that the scheme is likely to be a paying one. The balance of evidence is not at present in its favour. I venture to add that the Nizam-es-Sultaneh, who is a large proprietor in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz, is of the opinion that the population is not at present sufficiently large to cultivate the existing area of arable land, and that a large irrigation scheme could not pay, as sufficient hands were not to be found to cultivate the new land reclaimed.

[2474 a—22]He repeated the request which he made to me once hefore, to be kept posted from time to time as to what was passing, and as to the attitude of the British Government towards the scheme. He continued that personally he would much prefer that conditions in his territory should remain as they were, except for the amount of irrigation he might be able to carry out on the banks of the river by means of machine pumps, with which he is now experimenting; hut that if a comprehensive irrigation scheme was inevitable he wished to manage it himself, under , our guidance and with our co-operation, and would oppose the acquisition ot a V Concession by any foreign or Persian Syndicate. He laid stress on the possibility of a Persian Company obtaining a Concession independently _ of himself. In this connection, having regard to the statements made to His Majesty s Minister by the Moin-et-Tuliar, it seems possible that Sheikh Khazal does not a,ltogether trust the Moin, and thinks that through the instrumentality of the National Assembly he may be playing selfishly for his own hand, to the prejudice of his (Sheikh Khazal s) interests. This, however, is merely a conjecture. I reminded the Sheikh that the National Assembly was strongly opposed to all foreign Concessions, and that no development seemed likely just at present and added that I did not personally think that any scheme could prosper which had not the benefit of his co-operation.

The Rus sian Minister at Tehran has told the Dutch Minister there that he is favourable to the concession. Should it be granted. Van Rogen, the Dutchman who is inter ested in it, would come over to England and get in touch at once with an English group.

WITH reference to my despatch No. 277 of the 7th November last relative to the proposal for the irrigation of the Karun Valley, I have the honour to inform you that the Netherlands Minister has again spoken to me on the subject. He stated that he has reason to believe that the German Government or Legation is interesting itself in the project, and that it is highly desirable, if German intervention is to be obviated, that an agreement should be assured as soon as possible. He urged that the Dutch scheme was completely non-political and international; that all nations would be admitted to take their share, including Germany, and that British commerce would profit by it, as the material would be transported in British ships. I reminded him that I had already stated that I was without instructions, and that if his Government desired information as to your views, they should apply direct to the Foreign Office through the Dutch Legation. If it was desired to secure British financial participation, overtures should be made in London to Messrs. Lynch, or any other commercial house interested in South Persia, or, in general, in schemes for irrigation. He stated that he had already secured the co-operation of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, and of the Mouin-ut-Tujjar, his Tehran Agent, as well as the friendly attitude of the Persian Government. I have made inquiries as to the latter assertion. The Mouin-ut-Tujjar informs me that neither the Sheikh nor the Persian Government will consent to intrust the irrigation of the Karun Valley to a foreign Company. The Sheikh intends carrying out the work himself, with the advice and assistance of a foreign engineer. There is, he says, no question of admitting foreign control, although the Dutch Syndicate had offered a very large advance to the Persian Government on the security of the income which they hoped to derive from the proceeds of their work when completed.

Dated Fort William, the 3rd January 1907. Sir, In connection with the correspondence ending with your telegram, dated the 31st October 1906, regarding our proposal to grant a loan to the Persian Government in return for a concession for irrigation on the Karun river, we have the honour to forward, for your information, copies of the papers cited in the enclosed list showing the progress made up to date by Major W. R. Morton, R.E., who was deputed in January 1905 to investigate the possibilities of irrigation from that river. 2 . As you are aware, Major Morton was originally deputed to Persia to investigate and report upon a scheme proposed by M. Van Roggen, a Dutch Engineer, and it was estimated that for this purpose he would be engaged for a period of about six months. In July 1905, Major Morton submitted reports which ^ conclusively showed that M. Van Roggen’s scheme was opposed to all irrigation principles and he was therefore instructed in September 1905 to draw up an alternative project on the lines of Indian irrigation canals. 3. It will be seen from the correspondence now forwarded that a survey of the left bank of the river will have been completed by the end of November, but that no survey operations Rave yet been carried out on the right bank. 4. In existing circumstances we do not propose to direct a complete survey of the right bank of the river, but, investigations having been carried so far, we do not consider it desirable to recall Major Morton until he has made at least a rough reconnaissance of the right bank, in order that we may be in possession of a fairly complete report on which to work hereafter should occasion arise. The scheme is one of great commercial and political impor tance, and, although we note that His Majesty’s Government are not prepared at present to take measures for securing the concession, we think it desirable to obtain the fullest information on the subject, with a view to a possible change in the situation, which may render it desirable that the execution of the scheme, if it is to be undertaken, shall be in British hands. It seems to be the more desirable to obtain some reliable information of the conditions of . the right bank in view of the fact as reported in Colonel Douglas’report attached to Mr. Spring-Rice’s^despatch of the 9th November 1906 that the ’ Turks now apparently claim the whole area to the west of the Kerkha river * ' and down to Ahwaz as debateable.5. The period of Major Morton’s deputation, which commenced on the 7th January 1905, haying already exceeded one year, we have the honour to request sanction under Article 80, Civil Service Regulations, to his continued deputation until such time as he has completed the rough reconnaissance of the right bank, which should be about the end of May 1907. The approximate cost of Major Morton’s deputation is £170 a month and a moiety of the total expenditure is debitable to His Majesty’s Government. 6 . We should be glad if Messrs. Lynch Brothers could be induced to instruct their agents at Ahwaz and Basrah to give to Major Morton such information as he may require regarding the number and description of their vessels which navigate the river, since these particulars are of some importance with reference to the question of the possibility of carrying out a large scheme of irrigation without interfering with the requirements of navigation.

B With reference to your letter No. 3666-E.A., dated 28th September 1905 regarding the submission of further proposals for irrigating lands on the left’ and possibly also on the right, bank of the Karun river, below Akwaz, I have the honour to submit the following proposals and estimate for levelling the ground in question. Por this purpose, I return herewith the plan sent with your letter under reference. 2. On this plan I have marked with red dotted lines, the lines I propose to level. Taking first the left bank of the Karun, it will he seen that the map did not show the alignment of the river at all correctly, and the more correct line of the river has been shown by a blue line, as far as Ali Bin Hussein (a tomb). The positions of several villages on the river have been more correctly marked in red. The area which it is proposed, in your letter referred to, should he dealt with on the left bank of the Karun (outlined in pink) is thus consider ably reduced. To the south-east and east limits the Jerrahi river will be surveved, and it is not known, at present, how far that river is correctly shown on 'the map. *3. It is proposed to level over an area approximately covering the ground between the river Karun and the limit proposed in your letter, to a distance of 27 miles south of Ahwaz, cross line XI on the map, with lines of levels two miles apart, commencing with a line No. 1 on the map, 7 miles south of Ahwaz. A portion of this area, cross hatchased by red lines, has already been sufficiently levelled, in connection with Mr. Van Boggen’s irrigation scheme, and need not therefore be done again. 4. Below cross line XI it will be sufficient, at present, if the lines are 4 miles apart, as the ground here is not so much broken as that lying north of cross line XI. The ground south of this line is, after rain has fallen, 'to a very considerable extent, under water and has the appearance of being subject to inundation, from either the Karun, or the Jerrahi, when these rivers are in flood. The cross lines XIII and XV only extend so far east as is shown on the map, as, at the time they were surveyed, there was too much water, beyond their eastern limits, to allow of levelling being done. It is quite possible that the Jerrahi river, or some branch of it, or some canal from it, extends much further west than appears from the map. The survey which will he made of this part of the country will throw light on this. Similarly levelling on cross lines XVII and XIX was stopped from further progress on account of thick impene trable jungle being met with. In regard to other cross lines above (north of) cross line XI, they need not all extend right up to the river Karun. It is proposed so to extend only cross lines III and VI, as also XI. 5. The first thing which was done was to lay down a main base line, and this extends, from (Bandar) Nasiri southward, for a length of 43 miles. On this stone bench marks were put in, at every two miles, and numbered I to XIX. These mark the position of the cross lines. Three other subsidiary base lines will be laid out. This work is done with the theodolite, to ensure greater accuracy. It would take too long to lay out every cross line with a theodolite. By putting in several carefully laid out base lines, the intermediately lying cross lines can be laid out, with sufficiently accurate direction by means of a compass. From line VII downwards a drainage depression runs on the river side of the main base line, and at about 1 J miles from it. This could not conveniently be crossed, as there was much water in it. For the purpose of levelling the ground west of the main base line, a subsidiary base line, No. 3, will be laid out and the cross lines V to XIII on the west of the main base will be short one, being checked on to from the subsidiary baseline No. 3. 6 . The principle throughout is to afford as complete a check to the levels as is conveniently possible. For this purpose either a circuit is made of a pair of cross lines, or stone bench marks put in, where a cross line from the base line2 ends and this will be checked on to from another contiguous base line. Thus for lines III and IY, westward of the main base line, the levels run from the latter to the end of line III, which abuts on the river. At 5 miles from the main base, a line is run parallel to this base, to line IY, which is then levelled to the base line and the circuit is completed along the latter, to the starting point. And, again, in the case, say, of cross line VII, eastward from subsidiary base No. 1, a line is run for 4 miles, and a stone bench mark put in, which is after wards levelled on to from stone VII on subsidiary base No. 2 , by a line west ward. The only lines which will not thus be checked are those abutting on to the river. These, however, are not of much importance, and mainly required to give an idea of the river surface slope. 7. It would not be possible, except by reverse levelling, to check the main base separately, but it is hoped that, by the method to be adopted, this will be sufficiently checked. In connection with levelling on the right bank of the Karun, it may be possible to establish a special check for this also. 8 . The total length of levelling to be done, as shown by the red dotted lines on the map, is 413J canal miles, of 5,000 feet each. It is difficult, if not impossible, to say in how many days this work can be done. Under ordinary circumstances, one might calculate on doing on the average 4 to miles a day. The method of laying out lines with base lines, so that the lengths to be levelled from the bases, are mainly 4 miles, is evolved on the assumption that 4 miles of levelling is about as much as can be done in a day with a return journey of 4 miles to camp. Short lengths of cross line levelling can be combined with base line levels to give about the same day’s work or a little more, camp being moved on pari passu with the work. In some cases, it will be necessary to do more than 4 miles a day. 9. The difficulty, however, in estimating the time to be taken, arises from wholly different considerations. The work can only go on in fine weather, and the weather we had in January was very inclement, and unsuitable for work of the kind required. There were 13 days of rain in this month during which work could not go on at all. It is impossible to say how many such days we may have in the future. 10. Then there is the question of Khalassi establishment (assistants to the leveller). The supply of men available for this, in Ahwaz, is limited, and those who can be induced to take up the work do not take very kindly to it in the jungle far from the town. It has been necessary on one occasion already to change this establishment, and there is every reason to suppose this may occur again, involving delay. Under the circumstances it is doubtful whether we can hope to complete the work of levelling before the end of April, on the basis of a single party of levellers. It requires two men to supervise the work, one to level and one to lay out the lines and assist. I have been helping the leveller so lar and if, as it is understood may be the case, a second native subordinate is sent up, to free me for work elsewhere, it is doubtful whether better maximum progress will then be made, than has hitherto been possible. In any case it will be better to assume that four months’ work, January to April, will be required to frame the necessary estimate accordingly on the basis of a single party of levellers. 11 . A party must consist of (in addition to the subordinate) 9 khalassis, one extra man being allowed in camp beyond the number required for chaining, holding the stones, carrying the level, lining the flags, and putting in pegs. ^ Of these two men of somewhat superior attainments at present receive 2^ krans each a day, while the rest get 2 krans a day each. It would not be safe to assume that, on the average, for the whole time, the work progresses, less than the higher of the two rates will be required. A Sheikh’s gholam (armed man) is required in camp and gets 3 krans a day, as it is necessary for him to be mounted. Five mules must be allowed. Two extra, beyond 3 necessary for carrying the subordinates’ tents and the khalassis’ paraphernalia, will be required for fetching water and occasionally going into Nasiti (Ahwaz) for food and fodder, etc., and for getting money. These mules are being actually paid 4 krans a a day each at present, but the first lot of mules engaged, when the work was3 started, could not be got for less than 5 krans a day each, and it will be better to estimate on the higher rate throughout, against a future difficulty arising of obtaining mules at the lower rate. 12. The khalassi establishment, mules, and gholam may thereforo bp estimated to cost each day^ 9 khalassis at krans each . . . . , . . 22 | Sheikh’s gholam 3 5 mules at 5 krans each 25 Total per diem (krans) . 501 Taking the number of days required for the work, January to April (inclusive), as 120 , the cost in krans of actually levelling will be 120x50^ = 6,060 krans. 13. To this must be added petty expenditure on pegs, stones, flags, mussucks for water, which may be put down at 600 krans. 14. Tor surveying the ground along the Karun and Jerrahi rivers, which must be done as a separate item, it is estimated that three months’ work will be required, A survey party consists of— Krans. Six khalassis, whose daily pay may be taken, as before, at krans a day . . 15 Three mules to carry tents and kit at 5 krans each a day . . 15 One Sheikh’s gholam at . . . . . . . .3 Total per diem . 33 The cost for three months or ninety days would be, say, 3,000 krans to which 300 krans may be added for petty expenditure, giving a total of 3,300 krans. 15. The total of the two estimates comes to 9,960 krans. A kran at the present moment is worth such that S’O krans are the equivalent of one rupee. The exchange may rise or fall. It rarely remains stable long. It will be advisable to assume a slightly higher value for the kran, which may be taken as worth annas (rate of exchange about 3*75). The cost of the whole work to be done in rupees would therefore be, say, 2,400. There is considerable uncertainty about the matter and there will no doubt arise unforeseen items of expenditure. It will be better to say Rs. 2,500 as the amount estimated for the cost of the work mentioned, viz., levelling and surveying on the left bank of the Karun, and for surveying as much of the Jerrahi as is required to fix the eastern limit of the ground, which might be irrigated on this bank of the Karun. 16. With regard to work on the right bank of the Karun, to which reference is made in your letter quoted in the first paragraph above. I think it will be advisable to await the approaching completion of the levelling now estimated for, before submitting a similar detail of cost. It will then be seen how this work progresses and some idea will be formed how far the present estimate is suitable. On the map, returned herewith, I have marked lines of levelling, which might be done. A main base line and one subsidiary base line should be laid out approximately parellel to the river’s general alignment. Whether it will suffice to run cross lines at four miles apart or whether closer lines will be required, I cannot at present say. With lines four miles apart and check lines at the end and extending, say, cross lines V and IX to the river, about 230 canal miles of levelling would be required to cross line XV, about 30 miles south of Ahwaz. This is probably as much as could be done in one season after the completion of work on the left bank of the river. It is not at present possible to say whether much if any surveying will be required in addition or not. This can only be ascertained by going over the ground in question and this might be done in March, if circumstances permit.If it is a question of giving an opinion whether there is any likelihood of irrigation being possible on both banks or only one, I should say that from every point of view, whether from that of sufficient water being available in the river for both banks, without interfering with navigation, or from the point of view of the likelihood of getting cultivation for so great an area as that embraced by land on both sides of the river, there is no doubt whatever that irrigation on one bank is the utmost limit possible. It is much to be recommended that for this season at any rate work should be confined to the left bank. When the levelling now estimated for is completed it would be very advisable to level at least some of the ground at the closer intervals of one mile and, if possible, to lay out on the ground and level a line, or lines, for a main canal and branches, as may appear suitable, rather than go off and start work, late in the season, in a totally unknown country. 17. To sum up then it appears that— ( 1 ) the work of levelling the ground on the left bank of the Karun, as shown by red dotted lines on the map, will not be completed before the end of April; (2) the cost, with the necessary surveying, will be Its. 2,500; ( 3 ) it will be better, when this is done, to do more levelling on the left bank, rather than start work on the right bank; (4) whether (3) is accepted, or whether the ground on the right bank of the Karun is also to be levelled, a separate estimate will be required. Out of the Rs. 2,500, which the work at present contemplated is esti mated to cost, I have received intimation, in your letter No. 4844-E.A., dated 29th December 1905, that the Government of India have authorised an expenditure of Rs. 500, so that further sanction is now required for the expenditure of Rs. 2,000 (two thousand). 19. If this sanction is accorded, I would ask that the Government of India may be pleased to authorise the Treasury Officer, Bushire, to place at my disposal, in cash, Rs. 1,500 (which will include the Rs. 500 mentioned in my letter of 23rd January 1906, which was in reply to your letter No. 4844 above quoted) as soon after the 1 st of March next as possible, and the balance, viz., Rs. 1,000, as soon after the 1 st of April as possible, jafiardif 1 ' larardi 1 ! locality ■Basarit puted t 1 triced.^ dundar , es to be jss line; re corr distant a alrea ages (( Ri 7 U[ConfidentiaL] Dated Ahwaz, the 22nd April (received 7tb May) 1906. .From— Major W. R. Morton, R.E., on Special Duty in Arabistan. To—The Assistant Secretary to the Government qilndia^ Fpvei^p Departrp^nt. for, and estimate of, cost of levelling ground, in connection with.,the Kanin rivor irrigation scheme, I have th^honour to send you, ^closed herewith, ^plan, §cale S Statute miles to the ii^ch, shpwing .the lines ( of..levels, which /have been taken, to the middle of April, and also those, which it is hope'd it wll be posable to complete, before the middle of May next, on which date it will/ probably, be necessary to stop outdoor work for the season, on account of the absence of water required for the employes and the mules, which accompany them, and on account of the great heat. 2 . If the levelling is completed as proposed, there will not remain much outdoor work to be done on the left hank of the Kaiun, and next season (cold weather) it will, probably, he possibly to take up the levelling of the ground on the right bank of the Karun, in addition to doing what more work may appear advisable on the left bank. 3. From the plan sent, it will be seen that the work has been carried out, generally, on the lines of my estimate and proposals, contained in my letter above referred to, but that considerably more work has been done than was anticipated. Between the two subsidiary bases, and for a distance of 7 miles (canal) east of base No. 2 , all lines have been levelled at one mile apart, down to line XI, which is 27 miles south of Ahwaz. Between the main base and subsidiary base No. 1 , the lines levelled so far, are 2 miles apart, down to line XI and south of that line they are four miles apart, as in the original estimate. 4. I now propose, by the 15th of May, to level lines intermediate between those already levelled, between the main base and subsidiary base No. 1 , and complete work to the west of the main base, so that over tbe w^hole area between the main base and subsidiary base No. 2 , and for a distance of 5 miles west of main base, and for a distance of 7 miles east of subsidiary base No. 2 , there will be lines of levels one mile apart, from line I to line XI (except as was noted on the plan returned with my letter of the 5th February 1906, referred to above, over a small area where levels taken in 1905, in connection with Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme, may be considered sufficient). 5. If it appears desirable that over tbe whole area coloured green on the accompanying plan, which represents, I think, fairly accurately, the area which could he irrigated, lines of levels at one mile interval should be recorded, it ■would be possible early next cold weather to extend lines of levels north of line XI for a short distance westward, and to put in intermediate lines of levels south of that line. 6 . Apart from the fact that it has been considered advisable to do work on one bank only of the Karun, and possible to do this only to the extent that the small establishment available permitted, it would not have been possible to do any levelling on the right bank of the Karun this season, as the country, on the far (west) side of the river, has been out of bounds owing to its disturbed state, fighting having been in progress, between the Beni Truf tribe and the Sheikh of Muhammerah, whether matters will be better next cold weather it is, of course, impossible to say at present. 7. A total length of about 600 miles of levelling has been done to the middle of April, while in my estimate, already referred to, I anticipated that it would not he possible to do more than 400 miles by the end of April. This is due to the fact that I have been able to separate myself from the overseer and take a levelling party and myself level a cousiderable mileage. The weather too has been very much more favourable for the work than I anticipated it would be, on an assumption based on the long period in January, during which it2 was not possible to do outdoor work, on account of the heavy rain. I am also glad to be able to state that the cost of completing the work, now proposed to continue till the middle of May, and which will involve levelling about 120 additional miles, will be covered by the estimate I made, and submitted with my letter of 5th February, already referred to. No further funds therefore will be required, beyond those already asked for, for work proposed to be done this season, in this direction. 8 . I should be glad, however, if you will inform me, officially in writing, that the Government of India approves of my estimate and proposals and would ask that instructions be issued for the payment to me of Rs. 2,000 required to complete the work, in terms of the last paragraph of my letter, under reference. G. C. Press, Simla.—No. C70 P. D.—21-5-06.—45.—R. S. W.v»~ tAj&amp;l iaAjl Km # Dated Ahwaz, the 1st (received 13fch) August 1906. From •Major W. R. Morton, R.F., oa special duty in Arabistan, To —The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to send herewith a tracing, showing, on a scale of 8 miles to one inch, the ground on the left bank of the Karun river, which has been completely levelled, with lines at one mile (5,000 feet) apart, and the ground on the same bank, which, it is considered, has been sufficiently levelled (in 1905). The area, which it is now proposed to level, both on the left and on the right banks of the Karun river, with lines at 5,000 feet apart, is also shown. In this case the area and lines are shown dotted red. 2. With regard to the remaining area, on the left bank of the river, the necessary levelling I can do myself and, further, have sufficient funds in hand for the work. When the area has been dealt with, as proposed, no further levelling will be required on the left bank of the river and proposals for its irrigation can be sent in, independently of any proposals for irrigation on the right bank, which may be made thereafter. 3. In saying that I can do the work myself, I mean that the assistance of a surveyor is unnecessary, provided, of course, that I am not called upon to give my time to work elsewhere, as on the Oil Syndicate’s road. I think I may take it for granted that the levelling is of first importance and should take precedence of any other work in the cold weather season. The work can probably be commenced in October and should not take more than 1 J months to complete. 4. With regard to work on the right bank of the river, the area it is proposed to level is 40 canal miles (5,000') by 16. The direction in which the main lines run appears to me to be the most satisfactory. Lines Nos. XIII, XXI and XXIX should be continued to the river to check position and record river surface levels. With lines 5,000' apart, 770 canal miles of levelling will be required, and to assist in doing this, a surveyor should be sent. 5 . There is, however, a difficulty in the way of doing work on the right bank of the river. As I was aware that the country on this bank of the river has been in a somewhat disturbed state, I referred the question of the possibility of surveying in this tract to Mr. Consul McDouall, demi-officially, and requested him to interview the Sheikh of Mohammerah and find out from him if he would he able to supply the necessary guards. ^ C291FD6 . I enclose a copy of Mr. McDouall’s reply, which, you will see, is un favourable, the Sheikh being of opinion that survey work, at a distance from the river would not be safe. I presume that the Government of India would be averse to my surveying on the right bank of the river under the circums tances. 7. From the latter part of Mr. McDouall's letter, however, I am inclined to think that if the Sheikh of Mohammerah were made fully aware of the Government of India’s intention in the matter of thfcse surveys, he would be able to facilitate matters. It can hardly bo supposed that were he really anxious to assist he could not arrange for the safety of survey parties anywhere within his territories, and all the country which it is proposed to survey on the right bank of the Karun comes, I believe, within such area. Captain Lorimer is, as you are aware, away from Ahvvaz on tour and he is not likely to be back again for some time. 8 . Under these circumstances it would not be possible to make any reli able estimate of cost of levelling the ground on the right bank of the river to the extent shown in the accompanying plan, as the cost of the attendant guards, which may be considerable, is anjunkn &gt;wn quantity. Taking, however the cost of the same, proportionately, as that of the wmrk done last cold weather on the left bank, it is possible that Rs. 1,500 w ill suffice for the work on the right bank. This is on the assumption that I shall be able to assist in levelling as was the case last season. 9. (a) A decision then is required as to whether, under the circumstances detailed in Mr. McDouall’s letter, work should be done on the right bank of the Karun. (b) If this is in the affirmative, a surveyor will be required to do part of the work, and an estimate of cost wdll he submitted, as soon as it is known what expenditure is necessary to meet pay of attendant guards. In the meanwhile Rs. 1,500 may be taken as sufficient provision. In the alternative, so far as work is at present concerned, no survevor is required, but if a man is sent up he could be usefully employed on survey work, other than levelling provided he is competent to do survey work and in case of accidents or of my being required elsewhere, he could take on the work on the left bunk of the Karun. He might be sent here anv time after the 1 st October. Dated Mokammerah, the 26th July 1906. From W. McDouall, Esq., His Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah, To Major W. R. Mori ox, R.E., on special duty in Arabistan. Abuut the right bank of the Karun, theSardar Arfa says it is not safe. If you do not wmnt to go far from the river that is practically come dowm (to) ».e., guards. the bank of the river and only camp at . villages, he could supply gholams, but he says at a distance from the river it would not be safe. You mentioned about 16 miles from river, which I mentioned as about the limit 4 farsakhs, he said that was quite impossible, the country being open to incursions of Khasraf and other marauding tribes. I think this is fairly correct as the Beni Lam Sheikh has refused to do anything in the matter of the Khasraf and unless some change occurs be.ore winter, I should doubt the safety of surveying except in anv p tr- ticular place where a trustworthy tribe happened to be encamping and that would only bo when grass had grown, that is to say, late in the year. The Sardar is rat her inquisitive as to the object of your surveys and again mentioned that he would like to go in for irrigation works and that all the land belongs to his Arabs. He thinks if it could be arranged that he should get some Ioreign capital invested, he retaining control of the works it might be done, but the present is not a good time owing to unrest in Persia 23 &amp; d-LlfyjL lie Telegram No. 309, dated the 14th (received 15th) August 1906.

With reference to the correspondence ending with the telegram from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, dated the 1 st August 190o regarding your investigations in connection with the Karun river irrigation project, I am directed to intimate that the Government of India approve* 5 your scheme of survey operations in connection with the left bank of the river, which appears to have been carefully considered and to he such when carried out, as will admit of the preparation of a contoured map showin 0 * 1 irrigation possibilities. 2 . With regard to the right bank of the river, it appears doubtful whether the available water-supply will suffice for this tract in addition to that on the left bank, as well as for navigation requirements, and the execution at present of detailed surveys on this bank under these circumstances appears unwarrant able j however it is desirable to ascertain as far as may be feasible, without executing detailed surveys, what the possibilities of irrigation on this bank of the river are as regards available water-supply, suitability of the ground for irrigation, and probable extent irrigable. 3. If the Sheikh of Muhammerah is informed of the object of examinino 1 the tract on this bank of the river lie may be prepared to take measures which will ensure your personal safety, and that of your staff, when making a recon naissance and running lines of flying levels which would serve to supply all the information indicated above. 4. The general direction of the slope of the country may he known, so that if the limits of command in certain directions are determined approximately, there will be reasonable assurance that all the tract between these limits and the river will be commanded. 5. If your personal safety and that of your staff can be arranged for, and if the character of the tract on the right bank of the river is such as to admit of a reconnaissance with lines of flying levels or a few cross section lines as above indicated, I am to request that you will endeavour to examine this area and report,—on its suitability for irrigation,—on the extent of the commanded area,—and on the area which would be irrigable, («) if the navigation of the river south of Ahwaz is maintained, and {ii) if all the water is utilized for irrigation on the right and left banks. 6 6 . I am to suggest that in dealing with the scheme for the irrigation of the tract on the left bank of the river the questions discussed in the accompany ing memorandum may be taken into consideration. The Government of India are aware that some of the matters therein referred to have been dealt with in your diaries but the report on your scheme should be complete in itself.You should submit at an early date definite p roposals as to the additional staff, if any which you will require if the foregoing instructions are acted upon together with an estimate of the cost involved, and of the period which will probably be occupied in the work. MEMORANDUM. I — Irrigation. (t) Height of the water in the river throughout the year as shown by diagrams of gauge readings. A gauge is essential and presum ably exists and has 4 been read once or twice daily for some time. (it) The discharge of the river corresponding to various gauge readings, especially the low readings. (Hi) The location and height of the weir, the bed level and surface level of canal full supply at the off-take. The level to which the water can be held up in the river should be I’S to 2 0 feet higher than full supply level at the head of the canal. (iv) The supply incusecs likely to be required at various times during ■ the year, and the available supply should be compared; the periods during which the seasonable crops are on the ground should be explained and particulars as to assumed duties supplied. II. — Navigation. (v) Some particulars as to the character of the out-fall channel down stream of Ahwaz should be given, and it should be stated whether navigation is now possible at all seasons of the year, and whether there are difficulties from shoaling. (t;i) The class of vessels which navigate the river should be stated, and the depth of water required tor the same. (vii) Particulars regarding the number of vessels should be given. (viii) If the supply is short at certain seasons, the full development of irrigation may require entire stoppage of navigation for several months of most years; it should be explained whether this measure is necessary, if it will be feasible and what it will involve. The supply of water required for the maintenance of navigation should be stated. III. — Cost of scheme. (ix) Ihe proportions of the annual irrigation in the different seasonable crops will depend on the available water-supply, and on the crops likely to be sown ; the proportions will vary from,— Kharif to Rabi as 1 to 1 , to Kharif to Rabi as 1 to 2. (x) The annual irrigation will presumably be from 50 per cent, to 75 per cent, of the culturable area; the kharif duty of water entering the head of the canal will be from 60 to 90 acres per cusec, and Rabi duty 120 to 180 acres according to the management. [ix) The cost should be worked out in detail on design being decided. 4. If it is desired to see roughly what the cost is likely to be, the follow ing procedure should be followed:— Decide on the proportion borne by labour rates to those in the Punjab. Consider how the work is circumstanced as regards difficulties of execution with the following:— 4Sirhind canal which cost Rs. Lower Chenab Upper Jhelum Upper Chenab Lower Bari Doab 33*3 per acre annual irrigation. 18-8 41-7 Rs. 41-7 is an estimate rate. If the work could be executed for Rs 30 per acre of annual irrigation in the Punjab, and labour costs averagely twice as much at Ahwaz it appears reasonable to assume that the cost would be about Rs. 60 per acre on the Karun river scheme.I (Confidential.) Dated Ahwaz, the 20th September (received 1st October) 1906. From— Major W. R. Morton, R. E., on special duty in Arabistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your letter No. 3579-E.A. of 1st instant regarding survey work on the right bank of the River Karun, and with special reference to para graphs 3 and 5 of the same, I understand that there is no objection to my fully explaining matters to the Sheikh of Mohammerah, in order that he may be induced to give the necessary escort for survey work on the right bank of the Karun, which work will be limited to a few levels and a reconnaissance survey, with the intention of roughly determining the area which could be irrigated, according to the slope of the country and the command available. 2 . I propose therefore to go down to Mohammerah by the first steamer available, which will be in the course of about a week from this date and arrange to interview the Sheikh of Mohammerah on the subject of the proposed survey and levelling. 3. Until this is done it would, of course, be out of the question for me to say to what extent, if any, the survey and levelling could be done on the right bank of the river and I must await the result of my interview with the Sheikh, before submitting estimates of cost, time and establishment. 4. As I mentioned in my letter of the 1st August 1906, I shall myself be able to complete the levelling on the left bank of the River Karun according to the plan sent with the letter and this w ork will be commenced as soon as I return from Mohammerah. If the result of my interview with the Sheikh is satisfactory, and the necessary guard escort can be supplied, it would be better if I had the assistance of at least one subordinate (Muhammadan) who can level accurately and I should therefore telegraph to you accordingly. Without the assistance of one such subordinate I might manage to do the work, but its completion would be somewhat delayed and in case of accident happening as may occur, unforeseen, it is undesirable that the work should be entrusted to me alone. 5. The assistance of a subordinate would also enable me to take more river discharges. Nine discharges have already been taken as I have informed the Government of India in a previous letter, but some of these are not very satisfactory and there is no doubt that it is very desirable, if time permits, to have more data in this direction. 6 . The results of the discharges so far taken are as follows :— Date. Mean gauge reading below rapids (feet). Discharge cusecs. , * Mean velocity feet. 12-14th February 1905 + 05 26,000 2-53 24fch February 1905 + 04 29,100 i 2 ' 63 1st March 1905 ... — 03 18,500 1-91 16th June 1905 + 43 44,900 2-58 30th June 1905 ... ... + 2'9 33,100 2-87 14th July 1905 + 1-5 22,750 215 14th August 1905 ... + o 17,000 2-05 25th November 1905 — 2-7 10,000 2’48 10 th December 1905 — 2-75 9,300 1*71 1i |r ! h 7. This table will servn to show how far the discharge hitherto taken can he relied on. The first one is possibly wholly unreliable, as it took the better part of three days to complete I think I have mentioned the reasons in my diaries. % 8 . It woold he impossible to take more discharges, with any pretence to accuracy, unless I have the assistance of one trained subordinate. It is neces sary to work with a theodolite and I have no one whom I could trust accurately to record the “ times witli a watch. 9. There is one point in regard to the memorandum, sent with your letter above referred to, which I think should he dealt with here. I ref er to paragraphs VI and VII of the memorandum. Last year I asked the agent of Messrs. Lynch Bros., Ahwaz, to give me information as to draught and carrying cap acity which are intimately connected. I need not go into details of the maf ter; it may suffice to say that I asked for complete information about all the steamers belonging to the company which Messrs. Lynch Bros, represent. 10. The matter was referred by the local agent to the London house and the reply received was that such information could not be supplied. Further correspondence appears to have taken place between Ahwaz and London on the subject, and, ultimately, I was able to 'obtain the information, in part, in respect of two steamers of the Company, one of which does not now run below Ahwaz and the other of which is employed above Ahwaz. 11 . I think therefore that the Government of India may he pleased to refer the matter direct to Messrs Lynch Bros., London, who may he asked to allow me to acquire, by reference to their agent at Ahwaz and Hassorah, all the information wliich I may think it necessary to obtain, instructions to that effect being sent from London to the local agents mentioned. 12. In addition to steamers, the draught and capacity of barges which the steaxers tow should be known. 13. To sum up :— (а) I shall interview the Sheikh of Mohammerah at once and inform you immediately of the result of the interview. ( б ) I think a Muhammadan subordinate, trained to level accurately, should be sent here. He need not bring tents. (c) Messrs. Lynch Bros., London, should he asked to render all assistance possible, through their agents in Ahwaz and Bassorah, in regard to information required about the steamers and barges which they own. This information will be treated as confidential. L, g' Telegram No. 39$, dated the 9th (received 10th) October 1906. From— Major P. Z.

(No. 79.) Sir, Foreign Office, December 12, 1906. THE Netherland Minister came to-day to ask me my opinion on the subject of irrigation in the Karun district of Ahwaz. He said that the Persian Government had requested a Dutch engineer, who had been some years in their employment, to make a report on the old system of irrigation which had existed in the days of Susa and Nineveh, hut had now fallen into disrepair. The upshot of the report had been that there was a great deal of good land which was now wasted, and that the whole system of irrigation might be restored and the land fertilized. But this district lay within what the Dutch Minister described as the “ British sphere of influence.” And though the Persian Government were willing to give a Concession, the Minister repeatedly assured me that it was absolutely impossible to secure such a Concession unless the British Government would give their consent, and everything depended upon us. He said very emphatically that the scheme was purely commercial, and had no political tendency whatever. The Director would be Dutch, hut the capital of 1 million would he international, and it was hoped that some of it would be British. The French and Russian Governments had already been approached, and had declared that they had no objection to such a scheme. I asked whether any other Government besides the French and Russian had been approached. The Netherland Minister said no other Government had been apjwoached, because the matter depended entirely upon us, as the land was within our “ sphere of influence.” It would he possible for the irrigation to be undertaken by an Anglo- Dutch Company. Another suggestion was that the necessary money should be supplied by the Persian Government themselves. But the Minister seemed to he aware that the Persian Government had no money at present. It would be expected that a certain number of the orders for dredgers and so forth should he placed with Dutch manufacturers, hut the orders would be shared by us or by other countries. The Dutch Minister also told me that Messrs. Lynch had been apprehensive that the scheme would draw away water from the Karun and interfere with the navigation in summer, hut the Dutch engineer had made calculations which proved that this would not be the case; and the Minister was not sure that Messrs. Lynch still entertained any apprehensions. They would, of course, gain by carrying the material for the works and by the increased trade which would follow the development of the district by irrigation. I replied that we had always been favourable to the “ open door ” for commerce in Persia, as elsewhere, but our policy had been to maintain the independence and integrity of Persia, and in the present disturbed state of that country it sometimes turned out that what appeared at first a purely commercial undertaking required foreign protection, and led to a danger of political interference which might be prejudicial to Persian independence. All I could do for the moment was to promise to make a note of what he had told me, and to consult the Indian Government, who were naturally concerned with developments in Southern Persia, and who, I fancied, already had some independent information on the subject of irrigation. I promised to do this and to let him have a reply later on. [2261 m —1 iA [This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL.

I HAA E the honour to transmit herewith copy of the note which I have addressed to the Persian Government in accordance with the instructions contained in yonr telegram No. 185 of the 19th ultimo on the subject of the Ivarun irrigation scheme. I have received no written reply, but the Minister for Foreign Affairs has informed me verbally that the Persian Government has no intention of granting a Concession, j for a foreign Company, as it is convinced that such a Concession would involve thej grant of the right of foreign interference in the Karun \ alley. The Moin-ut-Tujar, who is acting here as the agent of the Sheikh of Mohammerah, called on me with reference to this scheme, and informed me that the Sheikh had originally desired to form a Company with one-third of its-capital derived from abroad. He had since given up this idea, and now desired to form a purely Persian Company.. It was, however, necessary to procure foreign expert advice, and the Sheikh had sounded Major Morton as to whether the Indian Government would allow him to act as paid adviser on irrigation matters to the Sheikh and his Persian Company. I said that I could give him no advice on the subject, as my Government was not inclined to take the matter up at present, but that I saw nothing to prevent the Sheikh making a proposal in the sense indicated, as long as it Avas understood that there AA'ere no political considerations attached to the proposal. 1 have informed the Russian Minister verbally of my note to the Persian Govern ment, as Avell as of the general tenour of my conversation with the Moin-ut-Tujar.

IT has come to the knowledge of His Majesty’s Government that a scheme is under consideration, having for its object the concession of extensive rights to a foreign Company in the neighbourhood of Ahwaz for the purpose of constructing and operating irrigation works on the Karun. _ The Persian Government is well aware of the interests possessed by British subjects m that district, which have, indeed, been the subject of special orders, and of direct encouragement of His Majesty the late Shah, and of lengthy coirespondence between the Governments. . A project of the character above stated is evidently calculated to introduce a vei\ considerable change, both commercial and political, in the existing situation on the Karun, and, while expressing its sincere sympathy with all piojects of a nature to develop the resources of Persia, this Legation is instructed to state that, in a icaa of the friendship which so happily subsists between the Governments of the King and tin Shah, Sir E.

(Repeated to Tehran, Fushire.) Foreign Secret. Please refer to Grant Luffs telegram 18tli September, regarding rumoured German loan to Persia for Karun irrigation scheme. Sheikh states that he does not understand how we could agree to this and asks us to keep him informed. His Majesty’s Government are aware that at request of Foreign Office British engineer has been for some time investigating scheme. He reported Van Roggen’s scheme impracticable, but is working out feasible project which will irrigate very large area though this would probably destroy utility of Karun for navigation. We have already in our telegram of 9th January 1906 intimated that we consider any concession for Karun irrigation should if possible be obtained for British enterprise partly for political reasons to enable us to secure possession of harbours in Khor Musa and partly to counterbalance loss of trade which might follow closing of Kamn to navigation. We have more than once expressed our willingness to lend money to Persian Government if such concession could be secured and we are still prepared to do this and even to assist in carrying out project so far as it is shown to be feasible at remunerative cost. We venture to think intrusion of German influence into Karun and Khor Musa tract would be most prejudicial to our interests and it was partly owing to fear of this that we deprecated drawing of line of British concessions at Bunder Abbas. Such intrusion would intensify difficulties which we have already pointed out in our telegram of 18th September as likely to result from proposed division of spheres of influence. British loan for Karun seems more necessary as Defence Committee decided on the 26th July that it was essential to retain full control of tract at the end of Baghdad Railway, which includes both shores of Shat-el-Arab. If Germany is allowed to make a loan she will acquire influence over the whole of Mohammerah and the eastern shore of Shat-el-Arab. From your telegram of 20 th September it appears that Russia is unable to produce money within six months which might be too late. She would probably agree to our acquiring the concession to forestall German action. Our purchase of concession need not be detrimental to any ultimate settlement as regards spheres of influence, but would be advantageous in future nego tiations, and in the event of Karun tract remaining with us would go far to secure hold upon the lower section of Baghdad Railway. We observe Isvolsky did not apparently suggest in his conversation with Nicholson that Russia should be given whole of the Persian shore west of Bunder Abbas, and she would therefore perhaps not object to our retaining Mohammerah region, especially if, by prompt advance of money, we were able to forestall German action. Further, British retention of Karun region would have incidental advantage of securing support to two important British con cessions already existing, namely, Lur and Bakhtiari roads, which both end at Ahwaz.Mr. Grant Duff to Sir Edward Grey.—[Received September 18, 6 P.M.) (No. 251.) Tehran, September 18, 1906, 2 p.m. HIS Majesty’s Consul at Mohammerah telegraphs that Sheikh has asked him whether it is true that jVXushir-ed-Howleh is arranging with German firm to carry out Vanroggen irrigation scheme, Germans advancing 3 , 000,000 tomans at 4 per cent., to be repaid from profits. I have replied as follows :— “ Netherland Minister and engineer mentioned are trying to float international company, with Dutch directors, and a capital of 30,000,000 fr. to work Karun irrigation scheme. “ Details were sent to Poreign Office by last hag, and a copy to you. “ I know nothing certain about the German interest in scheme, but it is strongly suspected that Persian Government are trying to borrow money in Germany. Inquire further locally and report. (Addressed to Mohammerah; sent to Foreign Office and India.)”F7'owl Viceroy, 9th January 1906. (Repeated to Grant Fuff). Foreign Secret. My telegram of 22nd December. Following are concessions recommended if it should be decided to grant loan:—(«) Con cession for road, Bunder Abbas to Bam, via Began, with exclusive right of running motors or vehicles propelled by mechanical traction. Decent investigation by competent officer shows practicability of road convertible into railway if and when required, (b) Undertaking that construction of roads, railways, canals, or telegraphs in Southern Persia be carried out, in so far as foreign assistance required, under auspices of British Government; Southern Persia to include country south of line Khanikin to Birjand. (c) Bight to execute Karun irrigation project on lines indicated in our Despatch of November 1901. Investigation not complete, but available / data point to remunerative project, (d) Telegraph Nasratabad to Bobat. Of foregoing (a) and (b) are far most important. Commercial Mission’s recommendation and inefficacy of Lur road concession owing to tribal unrest supply grounds for request. It is obvious that such a road would preclude extension of Bussian roads or railways to coast between Bunder Abbas or Gwettar. Scheme (c) less immediately concerns India; it falls within general scope of (b) and should not be pushed independently to prejudice of (a) or (b). Concession (d) should be secured in addition to all or any of above, if, indeed, it has not been already secured as counterpoise of Bussian telegraph from Bajgiran. It might be arranged concurrently with loan negotiations, but without express stipulation in loan contract. Sykes, in telegram dated 29th December, reports Bussian Minister is negotiating for Tehran Meshed road. This indicates that Bussian activity in pushing her influence in Persia has in no way slackened./ 6 l 2 &gt; Imperial Secretariat Buildings, Calcutta the 19th July 1906. No. g.a. 1359. Prom 0. C.

Morton, R*E*, on special duty in Arabistan To the Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Dept. I have the honour to send herewith a tracing, showing, on a scale of 8 miles to one inch, the ground on the left bank of the Karun river, which has been completely levelled, with lines at one mile (5000 feet) apart, and the ground on the same bank, which, it is considered, has been sufficiently levelled (in 1905). The area, which it is now proposed to level, both on the left and on the right banks of the Karun river, with lines at 5000 feet apart, is also shown. In this case the area and lines are shown dotted red. With regard to the remaining area, on the left bank of the river, the necessary levelling I can do myself and, further, have sufficient funds in hand for the work, when the area has been dealt with, as proposed, no further levelling will be required on the left bank of the river and proposals for its irrigation can be sent in, independently of any proposals for irrigation on the right bank, which may be made thereafter. ^• In saying that I can do the work myself, I mean that the assistance of a surveyor is unnecessary, provided—: - v f. of course that I am not called upon to give my time to 't work elsewhere, as on the Oil Syndicate's road. I think I may take it for granted that the levelling Is of first Importance xkra and should take precedence of any other work in the cold weather season. The work can probably be commenced In October and should not take more than l£ months to complete* 4 * re g&amp;r&amp; to work on the right bank of the river, the area it is proposed to level is 40 canal miles (5000* ) by 16. The direction in which the main lines run appears to me to be the most satisfactory* Lines Nos.XIII, XXI and XXIX should be continued to the rivwr to check position and record river surface levels, with lines 5000 1 apart, 770 canal miles of levelling win be required, and to assist in doing this, a surveyor should be sent. 5 * There is however a difficulty in the way of doing work on the right bank of the river. As I was aware that the country on this bank of the river has been in a somewhat disturbed state, I referred the question of the possibility of surveying in this tract to Mr. consul McDouall, demi-officially, and requested him to interview the Sheikh of Mohammerah and find out from him if he would be able to supply the necessary guards. 6 .• I enclose a copy of Mr. McDouall's reply, which, you win see, is unfavourable, the Sheikh h* the Sheikh being °f* opinion that survey work at a distance from the river would not be safe, i presume that the Oovernment of India would be averse to my surveying on the right bank of the river under these circumstances. Prom the latter part of Mr. McDouall's letter however I am inclined to think that if the Sheikh of Mohammerah were made fully aware of the Government of Inaia's intention in the matter of these surveys, he would be able to facilitate matters. It can hardly be supposed that were he really anxious to assist he could not arrange for the safety of survey parties anywhere within his territories, and all the country which it is proposed to survey on the right bank of the Karun comes, I believe, within such area, captain Lorimer is, as you are aware, away from Ahwaz on tour and he is not likely to be back again for some time. 8# Under these circumstances it would not be possible to make any reliable estimate of cost of levelling the ground on the right bank of the river to the extent shown in the accompanying plan, as the cost of the attendant guards, which may be considerable, is an unknown quantity. Taking however the cost of the same proportionately\ * ' wearj' ■ : proportionately, as that of the work done last cold weather on the left bank, it is possible that lis.1500/- wiii sufxice for the work on the right bank. This is on the assumption that I shall be able to assist in levelling as was the o&amp;se last season. 9« /V A decision then is required as to whether under the circumstances detailed in Mb. McDouall's letter, WOrk 3h0Uld done on the right banX of the Karun. (b) If this is in the affirmative, a surveyor win be required to do part of the work, and an estimate of cost win be submitted, as soon as it is known what expenditure is necessary to meet pay of attendant guards, in the meanwhile Es.1500/- may be taken as sufficient provision. (c) in the alternative, so far as work is at present concerned, no surveyor is required, but if a man is sent up he could be usefully employed on survey work, other than levelling provided he is competent to do survey work and in case of accidents or of my being required elsewhere, he could take on the work on the left bank of the Karun. He might be sent here any time after the 1st October. mDated Mohacamerah the S6th July 1906. Prom W. MoDouaii, Psqulre, His Majesty's Consul at Mohaiamerah • To Major W.P.Morton, H.E., on special duty in Arabistan. About the right ban* of the Karun, the Sardar Arfa says it is not safe. If you do not want to go far from the river, that is practically come down (to) the banK of the river and only camp at villages, he could supply gholams, but he says at a distance from the river it would not be safe. You mentioned about 16 miles from river, which I mentioned as about the limit 4 farsakhs, * i* he said that was quite impossible, the country being open to incursions of Khasraf and other marauding tribes. X think this is fairly correct as the Beni Lam Sheikh has refused to do anything in the matter of the Khasraf and unless some change occurs before winter, I should doubt the safety of surveying except in any particular place where a trustworthy tribe happened to be encamping *&gt; and that would only be when grass had grown, that is to say late in the year. The Sardar is rather inquisitive that he would like to go in for irrigation works and as to the object of your sixrveys and again mentioned that all the land belongs to his Arabs. He thinks if it could be arranged that he should get some Foreign capital investsI invested, he retaining control of the works it might be done, but the present is not a good time owing to unrest in Persia. kFrom Major P. z. cox, C.I.E., Political Pesldent, Persian Gulf, Bushire.

Comers Cocks, Fsquire, C.M.G., I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letters dated 28th June and 5th July 1905, reporting on y Mr* Van Roggen's proposed ahwaz irrigation scheme, and to say that this scheme is so opposed to all irrigation principles that the Government of India agree that it is out of the question. 2. The information received from you however gives no indication as to how far an alternative project on the lines of Indian irrigation canals nay be practicable, and it is on this point I am now directed to address you* 3. On the 8 miles = 1 inch map enclosed is shown approx irately the block of land !lr • Van Roggen proposed to irrigate, but this would appear to be a very small portion of the area which might be corananded by a canal from /vhwaz* Possibly all the land between the r.at*un To Major V. R* Morton, R. E., His Britannic Majesty' s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz Persia. river and the drainage M. N. down to the river Jerrahi6 could be irrigated, with some land east of the drainage. The red wash indicates this tract of land, its area is about 672 Square miles, or say 430,000 acres. 4. Thether there is sufficient water in the river to *N • ' irrigate this area is a matter for determination, and an all important point in the formulation of any irrigation scheme, depending largely on the minimum supply available, Taking the 430,000 acres as notec in paragraph (3) supra , and assuming that f of the area ^ 322,500 acres would be annually irrigated, a steady supply of about 1,400 cusecs would suffice, and from such information as has been given it would appear that the discharge of the river at its minimum is above this figure. 5. From the few levels given, any projected canal should apparently take off from above a weir at vhwaz, and run parallel to the river for about 3 miles, and then bifur cate. One branch might follow the foot of the hills in a south-east direction crossing the drainage M. N. at a suitable position; while a second, and larger branch, would run parallel to the left bank of the Karun, approximately on the alignment of the old garanian Canal, and by means of distributaries irrigate up to the drainage. a few levels would show how far such a scheme would be feasible.6 It is possible there nay be irrigable commanded area on the right bank of the Karun also; and if so, the weir at ahwazs night be utilised to serve a canal on that side also. The aim should be to ascertain the gross area commanded on both banks with reference to the available supply. ^nd I fan directed to request that you should clearly distinguish between schemes which are com patible with the maintenance of navigation, and projects which would be likely to interfere with the existing river traffic and possibly render navigation at certain times of year impossible4.

Morton, R.E., on special duty in Arabistan, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your telegram of 9th September* 1905 to Major Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, forwarded to me by post from Bushire requesting that careful observation and a measurement of discharge of river be made if not yet done, I have the honour to say that discharges of the river Karun near Ahwaz have been taken on several different occasions and the results of some of them have been given in my diaries. For various reasons, namely, owing to the difficulty of getting a suitable site for measurement, satisfactory results have not been obtained. Further, what is most wanted, viz., the lowest or minimum discharge of the river has not been taken, as since I have been here the river has been higher by a good deal than its minimum recorded level. I have just returned from a tour in the Bakhtiari hills as Vice-Consul for Ahwaz and shall take a discharge of the river as soon as possible. The river is now low and about If feet above the lowest recorded minimum, Captain Adie, S. S, “ Malamir ” October 1901. It does not appear likely that’it will go lower this year so that a favourable opportunity occurs which will he taken advantage of, to secure a discharge the result of which will be reported in due course.

Major Morton reports that if both ] sides of the river below Ahwaz be levelled the work will not be completed till the end of April 1906. He refers to his reply to your despatch No, 3666-E.-A., in which he explains the difficulties in the way of levelling the right hank of the river, and adds that he cannot complete the work before the end of February 1906, if only the left bank has to be levelled.Dated Camp via Ahwaz, the 6 fch (received 27th) February 1906. From— Major W. R. Morton, R.E., on special duty in Arabistan, To—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your letter No. 3666-E.A., dated 28th September 1905, regarding the submission of further proposals for irrigating lands on the left, and possibly also on the right, bank of the Karun river, below Ahwaz, I have the honour to submit the following proposals and estimate for levelling the ground in question. For this purpose, I return herewith the plan sent with your letter under reference. 2. On this plan I have marked with red dotted lines, the lines I propose to level. Taking first the left bank of the Karun, it will be seen that the map did not show the alignment of the river at all correctly, and the more correct line of the river has been shown by a blue line, as far as Ali Bin Hussein (a tomb). The positions of several villages on the river have been more correctly marked in red. The area which it is proposed, in your letter referred to, should be dealt with on the left bank of the Karun (outlined in pink) is thus consider ably reduced. To the south-east and east limits the Jerrahi river will be surveyed, and it is not known, at present, how far that river is correctly shown on the map. •3. It is proposed to level over an area approximately covering the ground between the river Karun and the limit proposed in your letter, to a distance of 27 miles south of Ahwaz, cross line XI on the map, with lines of levels two miles apart, commencing with a line No. 1 on the map, 7 miles south of Ahwaz. A portion of this area, cross hatcbased by red lines, has already been sufficiently levelled, in connection with Mr. Van Boggen’s irrigation scheme, and need not therefore be done again. 4 . Below cross line XI it will be sufficient, at present, if the lines are 4 miles apart, as the ground here is not so much broken as that lying north of cross line XI. The ground south of this line is, after rain has fallen, to a very considerable extent, under water and has the appearance of being subject to inundation, from either the Karun, or the Jerrahi, when these rivers are in flood. The cross lines XIII and XV only extend so far east as is shown on the map, as, at the time they were surveyed, there was too much water, beyond their eastern limits, to allow of levelling being done. It is quite possible that the Jerrahi river, or some branch of it, or some canal from it, extends much further west than appears from the map. The survey which will be made of this part of the country will throw light on this. Similarly levelling on^ cross lines XVII and XIX was stopped from further progress on account of thick impene trable jungle being met with. In regard to other cross lines above (north of) cross line XI, they need not all extend right up to the river Karun. It is proposed so to extend only cross lines III and VI, as also XI. 5 . The first thing which was done was to lay down a main base line, and this extends, from (Bandar) Nasiri southward, for a length of 43 miles. On this stone bench marks were put in, at every two miles, and numbered I to XIX. These mark the position of the cross lines. Three other subsidiary base lines will be laid out. This work is done with the theodolite, to ensure greater accuracy. It would take too long to lay out every cross line with a theodolite. By putting in several carefully laid out base lines, the intermediately lying cross lines can be laid out, with sufficiently accurate direction by means of a compass. From line VII downwards a drainage depression runs on the river side of the main base line, and at about 1 J miles from it. This could not conveniently be crossed, as there was much water in it. For the purpose of levelling the ground west of the main base line, a subsidiary base line, No. 3, will be laid out and the cross lines V to XIII on the west of the main base will be short one, being checked on to from the subsidiary baseline No. 3. 6 . The principle throughout is to afford as complete a check to the levels as is conveniently possible. For this purpose either a circuit is made of a pair of cross lines, or stone bench marks put in, where a cross line from the base line2 ends and this will be checked on to from another contiguous base line. Thus for lines III and IV, westward of the main base line, the levels run from the latter to the end of line III, which abuts on the river. At 5 miles from the main base, a line is run parallel to this base, to line IV, which is then levelled to the base line and the circuit is completed along the latter, to the starting point. And, again, in the case, say, of cross line VII, eastward from subsidiary base No. 1, a line is run for 4 miles, and a stone bench mark put in, which is after- 0 wards levelled on to from stone VII on subsidiary base No. 2 , by a line west- ” ward. The only lines which will not thus be checked are those abutting on to the river. These, however, are not of much importance, and mainly required to give an idea of the river surface slope. 7. It would not be possible, except by reverse levelling, to check the main base separately, but it is hoped that, by the method to be adopted, this will be sufficiently checked. In connection with levelling on the right bank of the Karun, it may he possible to establish a special check tor this also. 8 . The total length of levelling to be done, as shown by the red dotted lines on the map, is 413^ canal miles, of 5,000 feet each. It is difficult, if not impossible, to say in how many days this work can be done. Under ordinary circumstances, one might calculate on doing on the average 4 to 4| miles a day. The method of laying out lines with base lines, so that the lengths to be levelled from the bases, are mainly 4 miles, is evolved on the assumption that 4 miles of levelling is about as much as can he done in a day with a return journey of 4 miles to camp. Short lengths of cross line levelling can be combined with base line levels to give about the same day’s work or a little more, camp being moved on pari passu with the work. In some cases, it will he necessary to do more than 4 miles a day. 9. The difficulty, however, in estimating the time to be taken, arises from wholly different considerations. The work can only go on in fine weather, and the weather we had in January was very inclement, and unsuitable for work of the kind required. There were 13 days of rain in this month during which work could not go on at all. It is impossible to say how many such days we may have in the future. 10 . Then there is the question of Khalassi establishment (assistants to the leveller). The supply of men available for this, in Ahwaz, is limited, and those who can be induced to take up the work do not take very kindly to it in the jungle far from the town. It has been necessary on one occasion already to change this establishment, and there is every reason to suppose this may occur again, involving delay. Under the circumstances it is doubtful whether we can hope to complete the work of levelling before the end of April, on the basis of a single party of levellers. It requires two men to supervise the work, one to level and one to lay out the lines and assist. I have been helping the leveller so far and if, as it is understood may be the case, a second native subordinate is sent up, to free me t or work elsewhere, it is doubtful whether better maximum progress will then be made, than has hitherto been possible. In any case it will be better to assume that four months’ work, January to April, will be required to frame the necessary estimate accordingly on the basis of a single party of levellers. 11 . A party must consist of (in addition to the subordinate) 9 khalassis, one extra man being allowed in camp beyond the number required for chaining, holding the stones, carrying the level, lining the flags, and putting in pegs. Of these two men of somewhat superior attainments at present receive 2J krans each a day, while the rest get 2 krans a day each. It would not be safe to assume that, on the average, for the whole time, the work progresses, less than the higher of the two rates will be required. A Sheikh’s gholam (armed man) is required in camp and gets 3 krans a day, as it is necessary for him to be mounted. Uive mules must be allowed. Two extra, beyond 3 necessary for carrying the subordinates’ tents and the khalassis’ paraphernalia, will be required for fetching water and occasionally going into Nasiri (Ahwaz) for food and fodder, etc., and for getting money. These mules are being actually paid 4 krans a a day each at present, but the first lot of mules engaged, when the work wasstarted, could not be got for less than 5 krans a day each, and it will be better . to estimate on the higher rate throughout, against a future difficulty arising of obtaining mules at the lower rate. 12. The khalassi establishment, mules, and gholam may therefore be estimated to cost each day :— 9 khalassis at krans each ....... Sheikh's gholam . , . . . . . .3 5 mules at 5 krans each ........ 25 Total per diem (krans) . 501 Taking the number of days required for the work, January to April (inclusive), as 120 , the cost in krans of actually levelling will be 120x50J= 6,060 krans. 13. To this must be added petty expenditure on pegs, stones, flags, mussueks for water, which may be put down at 600 krans. 14. Eor surveying the ground along the Karun and Jerrahi rivers, which must be done as a separate item, it is estimated that three months’ work will be required. A survey party consists of— Krans. Six khalassis, whose daily pay may be taken, as before, at 2 | krans a day 15 Three mules to carry tents and kit at 5 krans each a day . .15 One Sheikh's gholam at . . . . . . . .3 Total per diem . 33 The cost for three months or ninety days would be, say, 3,000 krans to which 300 krans may be added for petty expenditure, giving a total of 3,300 krans. 15. The total of the two estimates comes to 9,960 krans. A kran at the present moment is worth such that 3'9 krans are the equivalent of one rupee. The exchange may rise or fall. It rarely remains stable long. It will be advisable to assume a slightly higher value for the kran, which may be taken as worth 4J annas (rate of exchange about 3*75). The cost of the whole work to be done in rupees would therefore be, say, 2 400. There is considerable uncertainty about the matter and there will no doubt arise unforeseen items of expenditure. It will be better to say E.s. 2,500 as the amount estimated for the cost of the work mentioned, viz., levelling and surveying on the left bank of the Karun, and for surveying as much of the Jerrahi as is required to fix the eastern limit of the ground, which might be irrigated on this bank of the Karun. 16. With regard to work on the right bank of the Karun, to which reference is made in your letter quoted in the first paragraph above. I think it will be advisable to await the approaching completion of the levelling now estimated for, before submitting a similar detail of cost. It will then be seen how this work progresses and some idea will be formed how far the present estimate is suitable. On the map, returned herewith, I have marked lines of levelling, which might be done. A main base line and one subsidiary base line should be laid out approximately parellel to the river’s general alignment. Whether it will suffice to run cross lines at four miles apart or whether closer lines will be required, I cannot at present say. With lines four miles apart and check lines at the end and extending, say, cross lines V and IX to the river, about 230 canal miles of levelling would be required to cross line XV, about 30 miles south of Ahwaz. This is probably as much as could be done in one season after the completion of work on the left bank of the river. It is not at present possible to say whether much if any surveying will be requir'd in addition or not. This can only be ascertained by goins over the ground in question and this might be done in March, if circumstances permit.4 If it is a question of giving an opinion whether there is any likelihood of irrigation being possible on both banks or only one, I should say that from^ every point of view, whether from that of sufficient water being available in the river for both banks, without interfering with navigation, or from the point of view of the likelihood of getting cultivation for so great an area as that embraced by land on both sides of the river, there is no doubt whatever that irrigation on one bank is the utmost limit possible. It is much ^ to be recommended that for this season at any rate work should be confined to the left bank. When the levelling now estimated for is completed it would he very advisable to level at least some of the ground at the closer intervals of one mile and, if possible, to lay out on the ground and level a line, or lines, for a main canal and branches, as may appear suitable, rather than go off and start work, late in the season, in a totally unknown country. 17. To sum up then it appears that— ( 1 ) the work of levelling the ground on the left hank of the Karun, as shown by red dotted lines on the map, will not be completed before the end of April; ( 2 ) the cost, with the necessary surveying, will be Rs. 2,500; (3) it will be better, when this is done, to do more levelling on the left bank, rather than start work on the right bank; (4) whether (3) is accepted, or whether the ground on the right bank of the Karun is also to be levelled, a separate estimate will be required. Out of the Rs. 2,500, which the work at present contemplated is esti mated to cost, I have received intimation, in your letter Ko. 4844-E.A., dated 29th December 1905, that the Government of India have authorised an expenditure of Rs. 500, so that further sanction is now required for the expenditure of Rs. 2,000 (two thousand). 19. If this sanction is accorded, I would ask that the Government of India may be pleased to authorise the Treasury Officer, Bushire, to place at my disposal, in cash, Rs. 1,500 (which will include the Rs. 500 mentioned in my letter of 23rd January 1906, which was in reply to your letter No. 4844 above quoted) as soon after the 1 st of March next as possible, and the balance, viz., Rs. 1,000, as soon after the 1st of April as possible.[Confidential.] Dated Ahwaz, the 22 nd April (received 7 fch May) 1906 . From— Major W. K. Morton, R.E., on Special Duty in Arabistan, To—The Assistant Secretary to the Government of India, Foreign Department. 'With reference to my letter, dated 5th February last, forwarding proposal for, and estimate of, cost of levelling ground, in connection with the Karun rive r irrigation scheme, I have the honour to send you, enclosed herewith, apian, scale 8 statute miles to the inch, showing the lines of levels, which have been taken, to the middle of April, and also those, which it is hoped it will he possible to complete, before the middle of May next, on which date it will, probably, he necessary to stop outdoor work for the season, on account of the absence of water required for the employes and the mules, which accompany them, and on account of the great heat. 2. If the levelling is completed as proposed, there will not remain much outdoor work to be done on the left bank of the Kaiun, and next season (cold weather) it vill, probably, he possibly to take up the levelling of the grouml on the right bank of the Karun, in addition to doing what more work may appear advisable on the left bank. 3. From the plan sent, it will be seen that the work Ims been carried out, generally, on the lines of my estimate and proposals, contained in my letter above referred to, but that considerably more work has been done than was anticipated. Between the two subsidiary bases, and for a distance of 7 miles (canal) east of base No. 2 , all lines have been levelled at one mile apart, down to line XI, which is 27 miles south of Ahwaz. Between the main base and subsidiary base No. 1 , the lines levelled so far, are 2 miles apart, down to line XI and south of that line they are four miles apart, as in the original estimate. 4 . I now propose, by the 15th of May, to level lines intermediate between those already levelled, between the main base and subsidiary base No. 1 , and complete work to the west of the main base, so that over the whole area between the main base and subsidiary base No. 2, and for a distance of 5 miles west of main base, and for a distance of 7 miles east of subsidiary base No. 2, there will be lines of levels one mile apart, from line I to line XI (except as was noted on the plan returned with my letter of the 5th February 1906, referred to above, over a small area where levels taken in 1905, in connection with Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme, may be considered sufficient). 5 . If it apnears desirable that over the whole area coloured green on the accompanying plan, which represents, I think, fairly accurately, the area which could be irrigated, lines of levels at one mile interval should be recorded, it would be possible early next cold weather to extend lines of levels north of line XI for a short distance westward, and to put in intermediate lines of levels south of that line. 6 . Apart from the fact that it has been considered advisable to do work on one bank only of the Karun, and possible to do this only to the extent that the small establishment available permitted, it would not have been possible to do any levelling on the right hank of the Karun this season, as the country, on the far (west) side of the river, has been out of hounds owing to its disturbed state, fighting having been in progress, between the Beni Truf tribe and the Sheikh of Muhammerah, whether matters will be better next cold weather it is, of course, impossible to say at present. 7. A total length of about 600 miles of levelling has been done to the middle of April, while in my estimate, already referred to, I anticipated that it would not he possible to do more than 400 miles by the end of Apiil. Ibis is due to the fact that I have been able to separate myself from the overseer and take a levelling party and myself level a considerable mileage. The weather too has been very much more favourable for the work than I anticipated it wcuid be, on an assumption based on the long period in January, during which it r hKARUN RIVER IRRIGATION SCHEME PLAN SHEWING GROUND ON LEFT BANK OF KARUN RIVER, SOUTH AND SOUTH EAST OF AHWAZ N. &lt;Sa 6 ba h* /■smef/fa &lt;A/f Bin /’fuss.

With reference to paragraph (?) of your letter No. 180 -E.A.,* dated 14 th ♦ Proceeding No. I79 i„ Secret E, February January 1905 , I have the honour to forward 1905 , Nos. 133 — 179 - herewith enclosed a portion—the main portion—of Part I of my report on Mr. Van Roggen’s proposed Ahwaz irrigation scheme which relates to the irrigation question. 2 . Part II if it ever comes to be written in connection with Mr. Van Rog gen’s scheme will deal with his scheme in respect of irrigation of Lower Karun. This part requires careful consideration and should be dealt with after examina tion and study of the question at lower river. This cannot be undertaken prob ably for say 2 or 3 months. V i 3 . I have sent Part I of the report not wholly complete but it gives my views on the scheme and gives an estimate of its cost and brings the report fully up to that point when it becomes necessary to deal with the probable profit if any. This I fear will require another week’s work. I wrote out a report on this part of the scheme but found what I had written unsatisfactory and wish to have a little more time for consideration in respect of it. It is the most difficult part to deal with as there are so many uncertainties. I may say however there is not in any conceivable circumstances the remotest possibility of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme paying, and may add that if it did pay it is wholly to be condemned for various reasons. 4 . The present part of the report goes I think as fully as is necessary into the scheme and may take some time to consider. By next mail I fully expect to be able satisfactorily to complete Part I of the report. 5 . With the report is an appendix which gives certain statements and list of plans numbered I-XI sent in separate tin soldered case. I regret that I over looked the necessity of providing myself with proper tracing material but hope that the traced plans will reach you safely undamaged as they have been care fully packed. 6 .

In a westerly direction, i.e. } along YY 8 there are to be 8 small blocks and in a southerly direction at right angles to YY 8 there are to be 3 such blocks making 24 in all. . 8 - D °wn the centre of each small block and off-taking in YY S and two other similar channels parallel to Y Y 8 , shown as W W 8 and R R 8 on the accom panying plan, there are to be a main channel, and parallel to it on each side, a smaller channel, which may be called a subsidiary channel. These are shown on the accompanying general plan No. 1 as : Yi Wt Y 9 , W 2 , etc., taking off from Y Y 8 ; W t Ri W 3 , R a , etc., taking off from W W 8 , and Ri R a , Z, etc., taking off from R R 8 .3 9 - At right angles to each of the subsidiary channels in each block there are to be 20 channels of capacity same as the subsidiary channels. These will extend from the subsidiary channels to near the boundaries of the small blocks and each will be 3,280 feet long ( 1,000 metres). These short channels may be called distributing channels. 10 . Parallel to the distributing channels, and at a distance of 50 feet from them, are the water-courses, in the banks of which cuts can be made for irrigation purposes. 11 . There is one more main channel in the scheme shown as Z Z 8 on the plan connected up with the main channels Y, Z, Y 2 Z 2 —Y 8 Z 8 , 12 . The whole of the main channels form a complete network of channels for the purpose of navigation. The main channel Z, Z 8 forms the southern boundary of the block of land to be irrigated, just as W W 8 and R R s run along the lines dividing rows of block. Lengths of channels. 13.

To raise the level of low water in the river Karun to a height sufficient to Preliminary remark, on what follows. permit of the channels being filled, a weir (or dam) is to be built at the site of the Site of weir (or dam). ruined Sassanian dam, on the main ledge ot rocks, which forms a natural barrier across the river about 1,000 yards below the proposed head of main channel (X on the General plan No. 1 ). Beyond fixing the proposed site and making a plan and longitudinal section of this barrier of rocks Mr. Van Roggen has not, as far as I know, done anything towards designing the weir (or dam) which will be required.- »] Probable River maximum high flood level. He has proposed to raise the water level to what he calls the 4! metre „ mark, and put the bed of his main channels Doubt as to wbat height Mr. Van Roggen pro- , . . . .1 rr , i • • ^ / poses to raise the river to for his scheme.

The 4J metre mark is metres or about 5 feet above the second^ step of entrance to Lynch Bros.’ house, at Bunder Nassiri on a level with which came the highest recorded flood (February 1902). 15. In taking levels of the ground, which Mr. Van Roggen proposes to irrigate, I have taken the reduced level (above an assumed datum) of the 4J metre mark to be 50 metres or i64 , o feet. This will make the R. L. of maximum recorded flood at Lynch’s house to be i64'o—( 1 2X328) (a metre being 3’28 feet) = 159*08. 16. There is no certain record of the maximum flood at the proposed head of Mr. Van Roggen’s channels, but it appears that in flood time the fall in the water surface over the Ahwaz rapids (/.£., from X to A on the General plan) is small and does not exceed ro/ Hence the R. L. of maximum flood above the town of Ahwaz near X on the General plan would not, in all probability, be greater than 160*08. Hence Mr. Van Roggen proposes to raise the water level by means of a dam (or weir) to a height nearly 4 feet above H. F. L. of river. 17. If he is satisfied that there will be no difficulty in doing this there is no good reason why he should fix the level of the bed of his main channel at a level so comparatively low as i47'6. It is true that neither the one nor the other level has been finally decided on — at least up to the time of his leaving Ahwaz and his whole mistake in this direction lies in setting about his work in a wrong way. Instead of commencing with taking levels of the ground Necessity of doing some of Mr. Van Roggen’s tO be dealt with, he postponed this impof' work for him. | ant wor k to the last and ultimately had about 35 miles of levelling done, 25 miles of which were practically useless. 18. In order to come to some definite conclusion, as soon as possible, on the feasibility of his scheme, I had levels taken of six of his lines of main and subsidiary channels for about frds of their length and two lines run for his main channels YY 8 and levels and cross sections taken along XY. So little did Mr. Van Roggen know of the country he proposes to irrigate, Necessity for altering some of Mr. Van Roggen’s that the line he said was to be taken for proposals. ma j n channel YY 8 ran at Y 7 into the high ground, under the hills and at Y 8 actually into the hills. Hence it has been necessary to lengthen the line XY by 4,000 feet, before any estimate of cost could be made. 19. It has also been necessary to assume that the R. L. of main channel bed at X will be 147*6 and put in falls where they appear suitable. 20. At an interview I had with Mr. Van Roggen on the 23rd February 1905, » . . . . he roughly sketched the plan and section or his main and other channels and I drew out to scale the results and sent them to him with a short note, to elicit an opinion as to whether the results agreed with his intentions at the time. He agreed that they did so coincide. The plan and a copy of the note were forwarded to the Government of India on the 13th March. . . . , . . „ , 21.

In working out details and making estimates, it has been necescary to modify somewhat the dimensions given to B, C, and D. The primary object of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is doubtless, as is the case with all irrigation schemes, to command the land, as far as possible. Owing to the fact that Mr. Van Roggen’s channels will not run according Necessity of keeping the water canal in channels to the slope and COntOUT of the Country, h ’g h ' but are to be laid out chess board wise, as one might lay out the water courses of a small garden, for sake of convenience merely, it is necessary to raise the surface level of the water in B and C higher than that level which w'ould be required by a series of channels properly aligned. 23 . There is also another and stronger reason for keeping the w r ater level in B and C which also applies to D. This will be gone into further on in the report. 24 . This has led to following dimensions for B and C keeping, as closely Au t . . ... , as possible, to the square area allotted by Alteration in dimension to channel. nT r -tr ri , 1 • Mr. Van Roggen for these channels, mz., 32 square metres or 344 square feet :— Bed width ... ... .., ... 30 feet Full supply, depth of water ... ... ... 9 „ Bank’s width at top 10 feet (to be increased to 15 feet where out of soil).

In the case of water courses D, to which Mr. Van Roggen assigned, as a guide for design, no area nor dimensions, these channels must be made so that they are entirely out of soil. Their banks will have to be increased in thickness and the top width made 3 feet.The full supply depth has been reduced to 2 ' 0 . 26 . The beds of all channels are level, so far as the slope of the country ... permits and this slope is taken up by falls, there being no bed slope. A bed slope cannot be given to reservoir channels. Falls will only be required in channels A and B. As it is intended by Mr. Van Roggen that channels A should be used for navigation, so that boats may bring up produce to Ahwaz from all parts of the ground which his scheme is to irrigate, the falls on these channels (A) must be provided with suitable locks. 27 . Mr. Van Roggen has drawn up a distribution table, a copy of which is Allowance of water and duty. attached to this report (Statement A) The figures m his original statement for columns ( 4 — 7 ) have been converted into 1,000 of cubic feet. For column ( 8 ) Mr. Van Roggen gives depth of water over irrigable area. This has been altered to depth in inches over irrigated area, the assumed areas by periods is given in the statement (column of remarks). 28 . Mr. Van Roggen divides the year into three periods of which period II Three periods or reasons allowed in the original Corresponds to Indian Kharif Season, propo f ls ‘ t period I to the Rabi and III is an inter mediate season in October and September for growing clover. He assumes that in period II half the gross area will be irrigated and the same in period I.

For arriving at figures required for column depth of water and for columns Annually irrigated area assumed in Mr. Van (l l) and (l 2 ) duty his estimate of half the oggen a scheme. irrigable area to be irrigated in Kharif has been accepted and fths of balance of irrigable area are allowed in Rabi and |ths. or this balance for the intermediate period.

Again other things being equal, it may safely be said, that duty, in , , this particular case of Mr. Van Roggen’s Duty, low in Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme. ai • • u 111 r i Ahwaz irrigation scheme would have to be pitched low, owing to the total absence of skill on the part of the cultivators and possibly also on the part of the establishment supervising the cultivators. 32. In India bad cultivators are to a considerable extent forced to be careful of water by stringent rules which make waste of water punishable by enhan ced rates. No such control could be exercised here. Even presupposing the existence of a well trained canal establishment the absence of any code of rules would allow the cultivators to do pretty well what they liked and moreover the country is well adapted to that form of unearned increment with which we are not unac quainted in India. Rainfall in the months June to October is unknown here but there are no actual records of rainfall at Ahwaz. Those for Bushire might be sent if neces sary. This being so, it may be assumed that duty of water in Mr. Van Roggen’s Duty finally allowed. scheme will be low and I think it will be safe to take the duty in period I, as not greater than 80 on the volume delivered on to the fields and the con*esponding duty in periods II and III may be taken as 120 . 34 .

Period I 1,100 i) II 770 »&gt; III 600 Total 2,470 with a correspondingly slight decrease in the duty. 35 . Thus far I have followed Mr, Van Roggen’s figures and now come to an important point, the key to the situation. 36 . Mr. Van Roggen’s channels are not canals in the ordinary sense of the Effect of reservoir system on command. word as understood in India. They have . , , no slope and are nothing more than reser voir channels.A I believe that this system is unknown elsewhere. At any rate it is very costly, as will be seen later on in the unique system proposed by Mr. Van Roggen. J . At this stage it is necessary to consider to what extent the system provides T . . . j . . , , for commanding the land. Reservoirs are made tor storing water when available against a time when the supply ceases. This is the case here. Mr. Van Roggen proposes to store water in his Channel reservoirs, in order not to interfere with the navigation of the lower Karun in the season of low river. He himself is interested in this navigation in that it provides the cheapest T „ . .. .......... an d in f act the only practicable means of Lower Karun navigation not to be interfered with. , , , r m i i &lt;• transport at present available for exporting the products of the land he proposes to irrigate. 37 . From Statement Ait will be seen that no water is to be taken from the river during the months of June, July, August, September and October, During March, April and May, the reservoir channels will be kept full by drawing 0 . . . . , , . t on the river for what supply is required for irrigation, and in June the supply required for irrigation will be drawn solely from the reservoir, and this will be continued till the end of October, when, as will be seen from column ( 5 ) of the statement, the supply in the reservoir channels will become 62,340 thousand cubic feet (for a unit block) against a full supply volume of 183,560 thousand cubic feet. 38 . In Statement B have been shown calculations for arriving at the depth Calculations for effect of rese rvoir system. of water corresponding to the volumes available in the reservoir channels, at the end of June, July, August, and September. It is assumed for facility of calculations that the side slopes of banks are 1/1 as is the case with the channel slopes, thus not taking into account the flatter slopes given to the banks nor allowing for the berms. Results by the longer process involved by allowing for flat bank slopes and for berms would not materially affect the results arrived at. In this statement (B) figures are given for the whole 24 year s' scheme, as in this case the whole scheme should be considered and not one block only. 39 . From this statement (B) it will be seen that, allowing for evapora* Evaporation must be allowed for. tlOn June o' 2 o inches a day=o '5 f ee t in the month; July 0*25 inches a day or, say, o '65 feet in the month ; August—as for July ; and no evaporation in September, the supply in the main channels (which, Low supplies resulting in all reservoir channels. w h en they are full, is IO’5) becomes — End of June or beginning of July » July or beginning of August „ August or beginning of September } , September 87 5-6 33 1 '5 4 °. If, as has been designed, the depth of supply in the subsidiary and dis- tr,hating channels (B and C) is o’j' below that of the main channel and their beds 3ro' higher the depths of water, in the subsidiary and distributing channels, would be— End of June and beginning of July ,,, y 2 „ July and beginning of August ... ... ,,, 4-1 ,, August and beginning of September ... ... r8 „ September ... ... ... ... dry. There must be some loss of head between A &amp; C certainly; if not between A &amp; B, and it does not appear that in taking this loss as o^ as between A and both B &amp; C it has been pitched too high. 41. The average digging of the 6 channels, frds length of which is shown in the accompanying longitudinal section plans (4 to 9) and the date, when, accord ing to the calculations above-mentioned, the subsidiary and distributing channels (B &amp; C) would cease to be effective and have no command whatever, are as follows: — Channel. Average depth of digging main channel A. Average depth of digging subsidiary and distributing channels B &amp; C. Approximate dates when subsidiary and distributing channels would cease to be effective in the average. No. 1 Y t Z t ... 58 4*8 3rd week July. No. 2 Y, Z 2 4'5 3'5 1st week August.

Longitudinal sections of other channels have not been taken at all, nor of the remainder of the channels above given. In making earth-work estimate it has been assumed that the average digging in channels No. 4 and 5 (Y 4 Z 4 and Y 5 Z 5 ) are similar and to Y 3 Z 3 and Y 7 Z 7 respectively, and that the average digging arrived at in the portions of channels estimated is also the same in the rest of the channels. 43. The effect of the above on the acreage which cculd be irrigated in kharif will be gone into while making out forecast of revenue. 44. The allowance made for evaporation is considerably less than that found . , , necessary in Upper Egypt {vide Buckley’s Allowanc; made for evaporation comparatively low.^ Works in India, page 6 7 , where it is said that the evaporation during the hottest months has been carefully estimated to be ©'39 inches a day). I do not know the climate of Upper Egypt, but should hardly imagine it could well be hotter or drier than the climate here. Not a drop of rain falls at or near Ahwaz from May to November or late in October, and hot dry winds blow, as a rule, in June, July, August and Sep tember. In considering this question care should be taken not to compare this coun try with many parts of India. Even in the Punjab it is rare that no rain falls over so long a period as that given above, though in Multan, about the year 1898-1899, the rainfall was very scanty. C-383FD 9As It is not possible to say much on the subject of silt. A few experi* l0 ' ments, which have been made to test the Silt - quantity of silt held by the Karun, near Ahwaz, were made at Bander Nassiri in April and May last and showed that the amount of silt in the water, at that time, was what appears to be small. Six tests gave an average of jite silt of volume, t.e ., one cubic foot of water held -jje part of a cubic foot of fine silt in Data for arriving at amount, few. suspension, which very soon deposited itself, showing that it was heavy stuff. Unfortunately there were no means of weighing the deposit and the only result of silt tests which are at hand for comparison are those given by Buckley (Irrigation Work in India, pages 36 and 37 ) which give the proportion of silt in rivers and canals as so much by weight. Assuming the silt in the Karun to weigh 100 lbs. a cubic foot (a cubic foot of water weighing 62 lbs.) the proportion of silt in the Karun by weight would be _i_ x 10^—,i__ ver y muc h less than any proportion recorded in Buckley’s book, 46. Silt, as is well known, accumulates silt and there is a possibility of the head of the main channel X Y becoming seriously choked with silt. Theoretically the channel must silt and silt badly. Silt is generally deposited in the heads of channels in the form of a wedge and there is no reason which can be brought forward for supposing that an exception will occur in the present instance. Unless special provision were made for the purpose and this would be Difficulty of dealing out silt deposits in Mr. Van* difficult tO do, ItWOuld not be possible Roggen s channels. to dry the channels, so as to remove the silt, as has been done and as can be done in an ordinary canal or reservior when circumstances require it. If the silt wedge were large the condition of supply in the channels in October would probably permit of their being cleaned during that month. 47. With the supply that enters the channels every year the possible quan- Amount of silt which might be deposited in Mr. tlty of Slit which would be deposited (even Van Roggen s channels. taking the small proportion arrived at as given above, xiz. % byT-^e volume) would be considerable. The yearly volume of water entering the head of the channels at X is for 24 years’ scheme 3,300 million cubic feet in round numbers, sufficient to deposit, at the rate of 1 cubic foot of silt for every 766 cubic feet of water over 4 million cubic feet of silt. This would in itself be the cause of a heavy charge against the revenues of the scheme, while if Mr. Van Roggen’s proposal to take up only small blocks of land for irrigation year by year is followed, and neglect be shown in cleaning out the silt deposited year by year, the volume of water which has entered the channels up to the time, the whole 24 years’ scheme is completed, would be sufficient to have deposited over 12 times the above quantity, should such a thing be possible. Though there may be some doubt as to what may happen there is in this question of silt sufficient to make it desirable that such a scheme as Mr. Van Roggen proposes be avoided if possible. 48. The cost of the earthwork required by Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme, Cost of the work. under the assumption already made, and Earthwork estimates. taking the sections, as shown on the vari ous plans accompanying this report, as approved, can be estimated with absolute accuracy for main channel XY, main channel Y Y 8 and six main channels like Y, Z, for about frds of their length of 42,000 feet as against an actual length of 6,200 feet. The same can be done for six pairs of subsidiary channels running parallel to and alongside of the main channels above-mentioned.49. The results of what has been done to arrive at the amount of earth work required shown in tabular form in Statement C. The earthwork of channel X Y, which is a main channel only, has been estimated by cross sectional areas shown on plan [(3 sheets) (1—4)]. That of channel Y Y 8 (also a main channel only) has been estimated in the usual way by taking the cross areas at every 500 feet. 50. In the case of all other channels the average digginghas been taken out, Methods employed in arriving at earthwork quao CXCept where the bed is Out of Soil tities owing to insufficient longitudinal section. at R.

For distributing channels the average depth assumed is the same as for the corresponding subsidiary channel, i.e. y for all distributing channels taking off from Y, Zj (say) the average depth of digging (or height of embankment) is taken to be the same as for Y, Z, subsidiary channel. 52. In the case of water-courses, these are assumed to be of one uniform section, all above natural surface. 53. As longitudinal sections of only frds length of six channels as Y, Z have been taken, it has been assumed in each case that the average depth of digging (or height of embankment) of the remaining |rd is the same as for the frds length which has been levelled. 54. For earthwork of main channels and subsidiary channels with their distributing channels and water-courses Y 4 Z 4 and Y s Z s which have not been levelled at all, the average digging (or height of embankment) has been assumed to be about the same as the corresponding depth (or height) of Y 3 Z 3 and Y 6 Z 8 respectively. 55. For earthwork of main channels Y R, W VV 8 , R R s , Z Z s , not levelled, suitable assumptions have been made. Earthwork in connecting channels between C and D, being small, may be neglected.

Earthwork to any large extent is not now done here, nor since the old days of the Sassanian Kings, has any Rate for earthwork. considerable amount of earthwork been done here. The amount of labour available here for such work is insignificantly small. Mr. Van Roggen proposed to do the work by machinery (steam navvies). Apart from their initial cost and cost of working, with fuel so expensive as it is here and skilled labour to be imported, such machines are, for the most part, wholly unsuitable for the work which would be required of them in digging channels, except at the head of the main channel, near the river, where they might be suitable. Part of the earthwork required is from the channels and part from outside borrow pits and the only means of doing such earthwork is that used in India, by manual labour and baskets.I if il ~ 57. As much of the rates here and elsewhere in the rest of the report must be based on the kran } the local current Conversion rate for kran fixed. coin, it is necessary to decide what value is to be given to this coin to convert it into rupees or other known and staple denomination. The kran has gone down in value considerably. Mr. McLean, who wrote a report on the state of trade in Southern Persia for the Board of Trade in 1903, gives the average value of the kran, for ) r ears 1897 to I 9 ° 3 &gt; as 5 2 '^9 krans to the pound sterling in Teheran, while in other places in Persia, fie says, it has sometimes a higher and sometimes a lower value than in the Capital. 58. Consular reports for Mohammerah and Karun ports for years 1895— ! 9 0 4 give the kran as worth from 51 krans to 59 krans to the ^'1 sterling, the higher figures being for year 1904, The value of the kran shows a tendency to fall, though periodically it recovers some of its loss in value. Till quite lately in this year (1905) 60—64 krans were required in Ahwaz for the £ sterling, but the value of the kran is now going up slightly and it is stated by merchants that with increase of exports its value would improve con siderably. I think that it will be fair to consider the value of the kran as Vjr (or as many annas) making one kran worth about 4^rd or 4 annas 4 pies and this rate will be adhered to for the rest of this report, in converting krans into rupees or English money. Cost of labour near Ahwaz. . 59 - All labour in this part of the World is expensive. A male adult coolie gets as a[minimum i-J krans and as much as if to 2 krans a day in some cases. Women are not employed. Reduced to annas at the above-mentioned rate, the daily wage of a male adult coolie is about €&gt;\ —8J annas a day which wage is about twice to 2-| times as much as that which his confrere in the Punjab gets and consequently earth work, it may be assumed, will cost about twice as much as it does in the Punjab. In dealing with earthwork the rate of 6| annas per adult man has been taken per diem and 4 annas a day allowed for a woman of whom, no doubt, some, as usual, will come with the men, all the labour coming from India (say). 60.

F° r (3) the rate of progression going to and fro is usually taken as 2\ miles an hour or 220 feet a minute and the allowance of time for 1 filling and unloading baskets is ^ a minute. From this the requirement of (4) can be satisfied. For ratio of load to lift, it is believed that this ratio varies, according to the lift, i.e., the greater the lift the greater its equivalent becomes in proportion to the lead. In other words if a lift of 10 feet is the equivalent of 100 feet lead on the level, a lift of 20 feet may possibly be the equivalent of 300 feet on the level. For present enquiry of this equivalent may be taken as 10 in all cases. 13 Main Snbsi Wati't mast diiteiit ^ ^iue * clean sod it is W Clll« uiis rats upees® n in Mr, as 2f The number of working hours in the day will not in ail probability exceed 6. 62.

The minimum amount of levelling required for this is, with lines one mile apart, 14 X 1 r8 X say 25 miles for the baselines, check lines and connecting lines = 190 canal miles. If done in the cold weather this could be completed in 3 months at a cost of about Rs. 2,000 allowing for an overseer and the usual establishment of khalassies in camp. 66. Land is often an expensive item in irrigation projects and in the case of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme the area Land * of the land required for his channels is very large. The area required is shown in statement E, and it appears that 25,000 acres will be required for channels and banks, within the area of the whole 24 years block of land and 400 acres for the channel X Y outside this area. A total area of land of 25,400 acres will thus be required. 67. The question arises as to who owns this land and will compensation for its being taken up be required, and if so what will the compensation amount to. Question of ownership. All land is ori dually the property of the State and in certain cases the State retains its hold on lands. In regard to the land here it seems that the State has given up this right. The Shaikh of Ahwaz says he is the owner of a strip of land, 4 miles broad from the river, running from a point some 6 miles above to a point 7 miles below Ahwaz. Some of the land near the town of Ahwaz is variously claimed by the Shaikh of Mohammerah and a large merchant of standing, the Muin ut- Tujjar, and a dispute as to a ownership, in regard to a plot of land, on which it is proposed to build a Vice-Consulate, has been going on between them for some time past. The Sheikh of Bandar Nassiri, Sheikh Henzaeal, cultivates much land near Bander Nassiri. No doubt if the matter were clcsely gone into it would be found that some one or more of the important men of the place possesses a clear title to part, if not all of the land, which will be required for Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme. The matter is one which should be settled as soon as possible, as, judging by the claims and counter-claims set up over the small plot abovementioned, it is a question which will require lengthy settlement. It can only be dealt with by a reference to Tehran. 68. If the land in question is not the absolute property of the State, com pensation will have to be paid. Compen- Probable compensation required. in cash) or by the gfant 0 f land elsewhere, was given on the Jhelum Canal for much land in which villagers had a claim to ownership, and much the same case seems to arise here. When it comes to awarding compensation, if this has to be done, a difficulty will arise m that there is no official here corresponding to the Deputy Commissioner (or Colo nisation Officer) of the Punjab and further any measure of land such as an acre or bigha is unknown. Compensation if it has to be awarded cannot well be estimated at much fSome of the land is valuable, as for example on the line of the main channel Land required for Mr. Van Roggfn’s scheme X Y where even in unfavourable years a estimated at Rs. 6a an acre. good crop of wheat is raised. A good deal of the land in Mr. Van Roggen’s block is cultivated and in favourable years produces wheat. For the purposes of estimates I have put down Rs. 60 an acre for land required. 69. There is a formidable list of masonry works required as given in Masonry work,. paragraph 64 above. . Beyond making a few remarks, as to the special conditions under which these will be built, l am unable to offer any clue to their probable cost and must confine myself to stating roughly, in round numbers, what appears to be suitable in this case. 70. The weir (or dam) required to raise the level of low river to the height Weir (or dam). . Mr * Van Roggen requires for his scheme is to be built on the main line of rocks at the site of the ruined dam built in the Sassanian period. Mr. Van Roggen gives the length to be 1,000 metres (3,280 feet). Though the rocks will give a good foundation and much of. the expensive river-bed pitching required in many Indian weirs will be unnecessary, it will be a matter of first importance to remove much of the top uneven surface of the rocks and the masonry of the old dam. Nothing but a careful examination of the reef of rocks at low water, Fu’.ther examination oi aite required. when are bar ?' wil1 al,ow of a decision as to what is required, in this direction. At the western bank there is apparently a deep gap in the reef of rocks which requires careful examination. The gap will be useful in passing of water of low river, while the work of construction on the rest of the reef is going on. The season during which construction work can go on will generally be from July to end of October, after which the river may begin to rise. 71. Whether Mr. Van Roggen is right in placing his weir (or dam) at the A1 . .. • 1, main reef of rocks or whether he should Alternative site possible. . . t i • , / a . place it on the highest (up-stream) reef is a point which requires consideration and investigation. The disadvantages of the site chosen by Mr. Van Roggen are that it entails a longer work than would be required on the highest reef. That its site is further away from the proposed head of his channels and as a consequence of this there is loss in w r ater level. I am unable to sny how much higher the upper reef is than the lower, but, probably, the difference in level is 2*3 feet. It may be that the rock foundation of the upper reef is not so good as that of the main reef and it may be also that facilities for construction are greater on the site chosen than the alternative site mentioned. Hasty conclusions on the subject without investigation, not undertaken by Mr. Van Roggen, are to be avoided. 72. The head regulators should be of the type universally used, with lifting Head regulators. S a . tes -. According to Van Roggen’s dis- tribution statement (Statement A) channels are not to be filled to their maximum capacity till March. This must be a mistake. the They should be filled as soon as the state of the river permits, i.e. s in November, supposing that Mr. Van Roggen is correct in assuming that in this month the river wnll be high enough to allow of water being drawn off from it, without interference with the navigation.73 - At the end of October according to his Statement (A) the supply i n the channels would be 53,162X24,000 cubic feet=i,276 million cubic feet for the 24 years’ scheme, but according to what is shown in statement B nave M the supply at the end of September would be only 427 million cubic feet lor the 24 years’ scheme. To fill the channels from this to full supply depth would require a volume of water equal to 4,400—427=3,973 million cubic feet, which could be supplied, Probable design dimensions. say in ten days, with a discharge of about 4,5 00 cubic feet a second. (4,500x86400 10—3,888 million cubic feet). With a maximum velocity through the openings of 4 feet a second, the area of the openings would have to be 1,150 square feet and if 8 feet high, 30 openings of 5 feet would suffice. . If , the openings were made in sets of 3, with small piers 2J feet and main piers 4feet the length of the regulator between abutments would be 232 feet. Probably allowance should be made however in building the head regulator for future extensions, the area of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme being very small. 74. As Mr. Van Roggen’s idea is that boats (presumbly small country boats Fails with locks. 20 ‘ 4 0 t° n s burden), should ply on the main . channel to bring up produce from all parts of the land to be irrigated to Ahwaz and Bunder Nassari, he intends to have locks at all falls in the main channels (A). As far as the longitudinal sections have been taken, there are 12 such falls and probably for the rest of the channels ot which no longitudinal sections exist 5 more falls may be added making 1 7 in all! 75. For the subsidiary channels 9 falls are shown in the longitudinal section Fails. an d 5 more will possibly be required for the . rest °f the scheme. As there are two rows o subsidiary channels, one on each side of the main channels, this number must channel^ ^ ^ 2 ^ ^ number of fal1 ( 28 )» re q uir ed in the subsidiary All these falls are small ones, not more than 3 'o depth and required as there is no bed slope to the channels. 76. Syphons will be required at the drainage depression (see general plan Syphons. No. 1 and longitudinal sections) which brings down water from the Ahwaz hills. Though it may be that there is little water in flow in this drainage at any time owing to the scanty rainfall, it is never safe to block a drainage on the line 0 1 s course, and hereaiter, as the subsoil water rises, as rise it must with the arge amount of conceptrated irrigation it is proposed to do, with, the high sup- p ies in the channels it is proposed to give, openings on the natural lines of the drainages must be arranged for.

Water-course heads to the number of 960 are required for controlling the supply from the distributing channels (&lt;?) to the water-courses (d) through the connect ing channels (see plan No 11). 79. As in the case of earthwork the cost of labour here is expensive. An ordinary mason gets from 4 to 5 krans a day and there are comparatively few of them within reasonable distance of Ahwaz. The best come from Shush- ter, and probably not more than 30 men could be obtained. The bulk of the labour must come from (say) India. The wages of a mason mistry would be from about Re. 1 to Re. ij a day. Owing to the shortage of fuel which comes by rafts or boats from the Diz river in comparatively small quantities for use of the steamer plying between Ahwaz and Sbushter, it would be practicaly impossible to burn any large quantity of lime or bricks. For both purposes straw is much used at Shushter, which points to the diffi- Difficulty of obtaining bricks and lirro owing to Cult)' of getting Wood. Bricks and lime are want of fuel. for the most part only available at Shushter after the rabi season has provided a supply of straw fuel. I have seen no bricks nor lime burnt at Ahwaz, but a few bricks are burnt. For building purposes here use is made of stone dug up from the ruins of the old town of Ahwaz and mud is used for mortar. 80. Mr. Van Roggen rightly therefore is of opinion that cement imported from Europe will have to be used in masonry work. The lime (known as sarutch) made from boulders is excellent and no- Local lime very poor, but cement will have to be thing better COuld be desired. It IS evident' largely u 3 ed. ly the lime used by the ancients in their dam and has stood well, outlasting in places the stones employed. Were it possible to obtain a sufficiency of lime, which is not the case for the reason given in the last paragraph, use could be made throughout of the local lime. To import cement will be costly, but unavoidable. 81. The stone available is to a great extent inferior. Among the stones dug out from the ruins of the old town of Ahwaz Much oi the stone available of poor quality. bIocks are f ound ? f a better quality of stone, but it has not been possible to trace these to their origin in the hills. For the stone required for all the necessary works in Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme recourse will have to be had to blasting and it may then be possible to discover a better quality of stone than that which appears on the exposed surface of the Ahwaz range of hills. 82. The stone, so far as it predominates, is a soft sandstone, ill-adapted to stand hard wear and for important parts of the falls, of head regulators and of the dam (or weir)it will probably be necessary to import stone from Bombay (say). The stone available here would do well enough for hearting of walls and for rough buildings, such as sheds and workmen houses.

The cost of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme as given above is about 337 lakhs of rupees, and as the complete irrigable area is in round numbers 60,000 acres, the cost per irrigable acre is Rs. 560. The most expensive irrigation work given on pages 272 and 273 of Buckley’s work referred to, is the Kurnool Canal, cost ing Rs. 135 per irrigable acre, and there are special reasons for the high rate given for this in the same book. Mr. VanRoggen’s scheme will cost between Jrd and -J as much again as the Sirhind Canal for an area less than -^th of the area on the latter canal, while the average rate of all Indian major works (A), up to 1890-91, is given as Rs. 28 per irrigable acre.I X * 0$t‘ 11 as Comment on the above figures is hardly necessary. 87. From what has been said above (paragraphs 36- Actual annual irrigated area of scheme, to be considered. 44 and in Statement B) it appears that as the scheme stands, there is little chance of any kharif crop, such as cotton, indigo sugar-cane, rice, if planted, coming to maturity. The rabi crop is well secured, but this is independent of the reservoir channels for sake of making which so large an expenditure, as that given above, is mainly to be incurred. The question is how is this great failure to be modified and its effects lessened. 88. Before dealing with the question one or two points in Statement may be noted. In the first place as there will be no supply in the subsidiary channels after Mr. VanRoggen’s in periodmay be omitted and the end of September the raison d etre of years divided into usual kharif and rabi sea ons. 3rd period, proposed by Mr. Van Rog- gen ceases to exist and the supply in September may be added to the second kharif period. If March’s supply be added to the ist period, we have exactly the Indian periods with the important difference that October is a blank month while in India it is a useful month for rabi waterings and sometimes for late kharif v^ater- ings. &gt; ... March is quite as much a rabi month as a kharif month, and in considering duty and acreage for rabi it will be seen that March belongs to this season and not to kharif. (In the subsequent paragraphs (89—101) a remodelled scheme is con sidered). In dealing with the question of what area can actually be irrigated annually by the scheme under review, it will be Rabi area actual by duty. necessary to consider the 24 years’ scheme as a whole. For the rabi period November to March Mr. Van Roggen allows 3,279 million cubic feet utilised supply and taking a duty of 120 acres to base of 152 days the area which this volume of w'ater could irngate in the time given w r ould be 29,962 acres or, say, 30,000 acres. . D ( duty) x V (volume') A (area acres) — b (base) x 85400 • This is just about half the total irrigable area of 24 X 2*471 = 59,304 acres of the 24 years’ block (see paragraph 3 above). 90. As the success or failure of his scheme depends much more largely on the area which can be irrigated in rabi Actual rabi area arrived a may be increase . than Mr. Van Roggen supposed, Owing to the failure of his reservoir system (as shown above in paragraphs 36 to 44, and Statement B) and since in the months November to March there is ample supply in the river in most years it may be allowed that Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme will, in most years, irrigate, say, 35,000 acres in rabi by a proportionate increase in the supply allowed by him for the rabi months. 91. As has been shown above (paragraphs 36 to 44) of six channels, of which a part of their longitudinal sections has Alteration proposed in system for kharif season. t a k en and shown On accompanying plans, three will be wholly useless by the middle of August, at the latest, for irri gation of more important kharif crops—cotton, indigo, sugarcane which require water to the end of September. It seems advisable therefore to treat these three channels, viz., Y, Z, Y a Z a and Y 3 Z 3 and probably also_ Y 4 Z 4 (of which no longitudinal section is available, but which has been taken for earthwork estimate purposes as similar to Y 3 Z 3 ) as storage reservoirs for supplementing the supply in the other four channels Y s Z 5 Y 8 Z 8 after July. In this case the upper four channels Y, Z, to Y 4 Z 4 would only be required to irrigate early kharif and zaid rabi crops, such as vegetables, tobacco, fodder, jowar (chart), chunna, which do not require water after July. 19 Divided into 2 equal portions, an upper and a 1 c wer. T t20 92. We may first consider what volume of water will be required in the four • .£ , upper channel systems for irrigation durinp 1 April—July ot zaid rabi and early kharif crops. No very large area of this class of crops will probably be grown on the four upper channel systems. There is an irrigable area available of 29,500 acres in ...... , round numbers, and it may be taken that about ^th ot this, or say, 7,000 acres, may be devoted to the less valuable crops above mentioned at the end of last para graph. 93. Taking a duty of 100 for this class of crops to a base of 122 days the volum. of water required would be = ~ javs x S6 -t° 0 == m ilh on cubic feet. Allowing about half what Mr. Van Roggen allows ( i.e ., for half the whole sys tem) in April and May, say 150 and 1 So million cubic feet respectively, 200 million cubic feet in each of June and July would make 730 million cubic feet, which would practically suffice, being practically the same as the 738 million cubic feet calculated to be required under the conditions stated at the beginning of this paragraph. 94. Calculations in Statement F show that under the altered conditions proposed a loss by evaporation of 122 ^Alter.tionsi’o.mce.s.d.upply'o lo^r half m iMi on cub i c f eet in J u „ e anda further similar loss of 109 million cubic feet in July would bring the supply in the upper part of the system to 1,700 million cubic feet at the end of July with a depth of water of 8 0 in the main channels A and 6*5 in the subsidiary and distributing channels. These depths would do for irri gation purposes and are respectively 2*4 higher than depths obtained under the original proposals of Mr. Van Roggen. 95. The original scheme supposes that as equal distribution of water will take place over the whole system and the calculations made in Statement B are based on this supposition. Under the present proposals this equal distribution will not take place and hence means must be found to hold up the higher supplies in the upper half system till the time comes at the end of July to draw off what is required for the improvement in the supply in the lower system. From the longitudinal section of channel X Y (plan accompanying this report) it will be seen that a fall is located at P. D. 60,000 below the head of channels No. 6 (Y 6 Z 6 ), but as there are no such sections of corresponding channels \V W 8 , R R 8 , Z, Z 8 , it is not possible to say whether a similar fall would be suitably placed on these channels or wffiether special arrangements for the abovenamed purpose would have to be made. Judging by the fall of the country it would appear that there would be no difficulty in suitably placing a fall for the purpose named. 96. From statement F, page (4), it appears that under the present proposals Volume available under altered condiiions for 1,7°° million Cubic feet are available at the lower half system. end of July for increasing the supply in the channels of the lower half system (channels Y 5 Z 5 —Y 8 Z 8 ) at that time. From a consideration of the original proposals of Mr. Van Roggen (vide Statement B, page (3) ) the supply in these channels at the end of July would be rather less than half the whole supply available at that time for the whole system which is seen to be 2,160 million cubic feet on page (3) of Statement B. The actual number of million cubic feet works out proportionately to 1,024 by a pro cess of calculation similar to that shown on page (2) of statement F. 97. We are no longer bound however to follow Mr. Van Roggen’s figures Limit to which supply in channels of lower half and they can be changed for the lower half system may be reduced. ^ system as has been done for the upper one. 1 he point to bear in mind is that the supply in the channels should not be4 Mr r*&gt; n reduced below a certain depth and this may be taken to be 40 ‘ main channels and 2'5 for the subsidiary and distributing cha ' nels , T 1 ? . depths correspond to a total volume in the lower half system of 785 million cubic feet below which volume then the supply should not tall. c8.

Deducting the probable expenditure to be incurred each year in main tenance and salaries of establishment from the gross revenue will give the nett revenue available annually to the Government and show whether the scheme will be a financial success or not. . V^-.The above is a cumbersome method of arriving at the nett revenue of an irrigation project and is necessitated by the fact that in this country all land revenue is paid as a share of the produce of land actually in kind or converted into cash at rates to a certain extent paid beforehand, and the amount of land revenue therefore cannot be stated as so much per acre or other known area While m an Indian irrigation scheme known rates per acre can be and are applied to an estimated area to arrive at the gross revenue of the scheme, in this countrv the same object has to be attained in the longer way mentioned above This longer way is to a certain extent analogous to what is done in settlement opera- tions with the important difference that, among other things, it is not necessary here to go into the question of owners’ expenses and of the share that owners and tenants respectively get of the land produce. 108. The first question then to settle is what is to be taken as the outturn Produce outturn per acre. per acre of crops which will probably be 1 rp,. grown on the lands of Mr, Van Roggen’s scheme.

Imports of sugar have considerably increased of late years. Consular reports for Muhammerah and Ahwaz show that for the 5 years ending 1903, the imports of sugar principally from Austria, France and Belgium amounted to 35,000 cwt. and the trade has increased from 12,000 cwt, in 1895 to 42,000 cwt. in 1904. 109 111. It is a well-established fact (Curzon’s Persia, Vol. II, page 351) that the very lands which Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is to irrigate are those (with no . doubt other additional lands in their The ian is suitable. neighbourhood) which, in the days of Ahwaz’s (Aginis) prosperity, Iwere large producers of sugarcane. The reasons why this crop has been omitted from the list in paragraph (109) are that there , ,. f L is no certain information at hand as to the Reasons why not .nclnded ,n crop, ol paragraph pr(lbable fluUum 0 f th ; s p roduce per acre and further it is not possible to assign to sugarcane, as distinct from sugar, (which alone of the two is a marketable com modity) a value for the purposes of enquiry further on in the report. Informa tion as to values is naturally limited to those ruling in the case of crops actually grown in this part of Persia. 112. The probable outturns given above in paragraph 109 are based on . J enquiry made in respect of results actually Outturns propose ow xe . obtained on the Jhelum and Chenab Canals in the Punjab and on notes taken from Mr. Maclagan’s settlement report of the Multan district. I have put the outturns as about a mean between the two. The outturns given in the above quoted settlement report appear to me to be some what low for present purposes except in the case of those given for the Multan Tarafs y a particularly rich highly cultivated area in the immediate neighbourhood of Multan. On the other hand some of the outturns given me for land on the Jhelum and Chenab canals are undoubtedly high and above the average. No doubt here, as elsewhere, some low outturns as well as outturns above the average would be obtained and in an estimate such as that we are considering a fair average must be taken.4 113. The land near Ahwaz is very much the same as that found in many Land of the achome roaomblo. that of Punjab. Pf 1 ? ° f aS £ ° r sample the low land ot the Jhelum canal. It is an alluvial deposit and there is a conspicuous absence, so far as I have been over the land of any very inferior sorts whether of reb or sand drifts and dunes. On the other hand Cultivators of poor quality. the cultivators who will till the land in question will in all probability be largely, if not entirely, Arabs, with very little knowledge of husbandry and agriculture, lazy and indifferent, so that, on the whole, it may be said that just fair average crops according to the Punjab standard may be expected and no more. The question is of course one that is subject to differences of opinion and no two independent enquirers would agree in their estimate of probable outturn. 114. Coming now to prices which, as stated above, may be given in rupees Prices to be assigned to outturns. per Indian there is a considerable amount of uncertainty, especially in respect of some crops, as to what should be taken to be suitable prices in the present case. The available sources of information on this head are few and partially Source, of Worruation on this head. misleading. These sources of information are (1) Consular reports, which of course must only be those for Muhammerah and Ahwaz or Arabistan and not those for other parts of Persia, (2) enquiry locally and in the neighbourhood as to present prices obtainable in the Bazaar. 115. Consular reports give the values of the chief products which are Consular report figures. exported and imported, but the resulting prices are to be accepted with some caution as they are those found by enquiry of merchants to have ruled on the average of the year for which the report is issued. With imports we have no concern here.

Secondly the fact of food ^ stuffs_ being imported shows that there is local scarcity with its attendant high prices, as under normal conditions the country is well able to produce all its own food requirements and in many years to export a certain surplus of some kinds. Sugarcane could no doubt be grown if any one had the energy to undertake its cyltivafion and the preparation of sugar from the cane. 116. The average price for a year is no doubt a correct one for the Deal with average prices. particular purpose of a Consular report, . t . but it is not of any value in considering what should be the proper value to put on a crop under the conditions now being discussed. Here as elsewhere prices fluctuate throughout the year and more especially from year to year mainly according to the supply partly according to the demand. Thus to take the principal of product of this part of rersia, wheat, the Consular reports above mentioned quote its price in 1894 as low enquiry. 1 * are not ln many casMsuitable t0 pre:ient as the equivalent of Rs. per L , . , maund (Indian) while in 1900 the price is given as the equivalent of over Rs. 4-12 per maund. The prices of wheat given in the Consular reports are affected by the fact that in some years the wheat of a rormer year which has been stored is brought on to the market when the price is favourable. This has occurred on several occasions notably in 1898 when it is stated in the report for that year that wheat of 1896 stored by the Arabs derab!y 0U ^ t ° n t0 ^ mar ^ et anc * ultimately brought the price down consi- il7» Another point which must not be overlooked in dealing with the And which include cost of carriage to ports. Consular reports is that in them the prices v , . . cover cost of carriage for the bulk of the items quoted m the reports which coming from inland have to bear the cost of heavy in,and freight from the place of origin.5 118. A more valuable method of fixing the prices to be applied to crop Price from bazaar. outturns for revenue purposes in Mr. Van Roggen s scheme is from present local enquiry in the bazaar keeping in mind the necessity of finding out as far as possible the prices ruling at the time a crop comes on to the market and not only the actual present prices which may be and probably are abnormal if refer ring to past season’s crops. 119. In the following statement has been given the prices probably suitable Suitable prices stated. f OT the present enquiry for the crops given in the list in paragraph (109) and mainly as a matter of interest and for the sake of comparison rather than because any real importance can be attached to them for present purposes, columns have been added showing current local prices and average prices for 10 years (1893-1902) of those of the products which are dealt with in the* Consular reports. The reports for years 1903 and 1904 have not been included as they do not give information from which prices can be ascertained. They merely give total values or weights of commodities and not both the one and the other as was done in years prior to 1903 :— I 2 3 4 Product. Present prices per Indian maund.

It is stated that wheat may possibly go lower in price than that at present obtaining. In the case, of rice, oil-seeds, maize and jowar, which are summer crops, the price given is about that ruling last year at the time of harvest in Dizful where these crops are grown to some extent and may be accepted for present purposes. 121. In regard to cotton the price given in Consular reports is for cleaned cotton between the price of which and that Remarks on cotton prices. of cotton as [ t j s picked in the fields there is naturally some difference and the latter is the price to be taken m the present case. The price given in the table in paragraph (119) for cotton in column (4) is that for last year’s uncleaned cotton in Dizful and may perhaps be rather ig than otherwise. There is a very small amount of cotton grown in Arabistan. Con sular reports for ten years 1893-1902 show that the largest amount exported during those years was not more than 100 tons, an almost insignificant amount, most ot C401FD6 which goes to other parts of Persia and to Turkey. A certain amount of cotton, but not much, is used in Arabistan and Bakhtiari land for manufacture of carpet. 122. The prices given in column (2) of the table in paragraph (119) for indigo Indigo prices. are f ? r various qualities of which 3 are re cognized.

Persian exported opium comes mainly from Isfahan and goes by Bushire7 in respect of this produce of land the report by Mr. Maclean already referred to (paragraph 51) states that this crop is somewhat expensive and precarious to grow 7 , needing much labour and manure and is frequently damaged by hail or rain whilst prices are subject to wide fluctuations and are entirely dependent on the China and London markets. It is said that opium is often grown because it can be readily disposed of for cash to meet rents and taxes and not for superior profit as compared with other crops. 127. Dates are much grown near Muhammerah and are exported in D t large quantities in many years to India, Europe and America. The crops appears to be an uncertain one and particularly liable to damage from various causes such as dust storms, hot winds, a cold spring, high floods of the river damaging spring crop all of which are quoted from time to time in Consular reports as causing failure of the date crop. It would be practically impossible to estimate the revenue likely to be obtained, on the Ahwaz scheme lands, from the cultivation of dates and in respect of the class of produce and in respect of opium and sugarcane it may be remarked that in the revenue forecast (paragraph 125) it has been assumed that the whole of the Kharifcxo^ estimated The method employed of arriving at the gross tO be produced On the lands in question revenue favourable to the scheme. will be COttOn which is, with the possible exception of sugarcane, the most valuable crop which can be produced in that season fasl. It is not at all probable that all the lands to be cultivated in Khar if will actually be devoted to cotton, some less valuable crop will also be grown along with cotton, and in taking the last named product of the soil alone in the revenue forecast, the scheme under review has been done all ^ the practice necessary. In regard to sugarcane it may be mentioned that if this class Special requirements in case of sugarcane of Crop IS gTO^Wn OH the AhwaZ Scheme growing- lands a certain amount of enterprise will be required in introducing machinery, even if it be only of the simplest possible kind, for the early extraction of sugar, which must be undertaken soon after the cane is cut. In view of its special requirements opium which occupies the ground from November to end of March or the beginning of April will only be grown, if at all, in such small quantities as hardly to affect the revenue forecast. 128. Passing on to the next point which was to be considered,*^., the L , share of the gross revenue which the Government share of gross revenue. ^ 0 , . • ,, • Persian Government may claim as their due, there are several difficulties in the way of coming to a definite conclusion on this point of the enquiry. It is really a matter which should be con sidered and reported on by some official of the Persian Government. As it is one that no outsiders can possibly be in a position to give an opinion of any value. It is in the present case intimately connected with the last point , .... . ... which the present enquiry has to deal with, y -viz., the annual cost of tho upkeep of the channels and masonry works of the Ahwaz scheme when they are constructed. Obviously the greater the cost of this maintenance, the greater should be the share which the Persian Government will probably demand from the revenues resulting from the scheme, which has been shown in other previous parts of this report as one of no small magnitude. The nature of the work proposed by Mr. Van Roggen is such that it presupposes the existence or creation of a well-trained „ , , staff of engineers and revenue subordinates. Annual expenditure of scheme considered. The Work when completed must in fact be properly supervised and its full capacity for producing results developed and maintained if what is hoped of the work is to be obtained in practice. There must be no difference between the way in which Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is worked after completion and the way an Indian irrigation work (say) is main tained. 199. It would be difficult to reduce to writing the exact cost per annum, The necessity of a ptoperly constitute iepait- which the Work in question will, On Com- ment for the woik. pletion, entail on the Persian Government, year by year. There is at present, at any rate in this part of Persia (Arabistan)8 Aunual cost of upkeep estimated per acre. Its incidence no Department corresponding with Public Works Department of India. Such a Department would have to be formed, even if it were only local and on a small scale. Relatively to India the cost of working and maintaining Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme would be considerable. In the one country a well-trained Department exists and when a new scheme is put in hand, it becomes merely one of expanding the Department. Here a totally new order of things would have to be introduced and the engagement of a certain number of European trained engineers appears to be imperatively necessary. 130. Under these circumstances I do not see how the cost of working and maintaining the channels and masonry works of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme can well be pitched at less than lakhs of rupees a year. This amount would not be as much as 3 rupees an acre in the annually irrigated area, as arrived at in paragraph (101) (54,000 acres) ani tak'ng into consideration that in the Punjab, where the maintenance charges are low, these annually recurring charges amount in the average to about one rupee per acre, or perhaps a little more, it is not too much to suppose that the proper working and upkeep of the scheme under review will cost less than the amount mentioned above. This would include the pay of the necessary establishment. ^ 131. The ordinary share that the Persian Government is considered to be Persian Government share of gross annual reve- entitled to take of agricultural produce is nue: an uncertain quantity. g 1V en in Curzon’s Persia (volume II, pages , . , . . . 47 1 and 472) as |th, though it is there stated that in practice the assessment frequently amounts to Rs. 50 per cent and may be taken as 25 per cent, on the average.

The gross revenue that the9 scheme has been estimated to produce each year under the assumptions made in paragraphs (132) and (130) (a half share of the produce and working ex penses not exceeding 1J lakhs of rupees) would have to be nearly trebled before the Government could get even 5 per cent, on the outlay necessary for the scheme. To treble the gross revenue would mean assigning an average value per acre of crops irrigated each year of 75 rupees for kharif and rabi, together a wholly inconceivable value. Even with 5 per cent, per annum nett profit on the outlay only sufficient money would be available for paying interest on money borrowed for the work. 133. The question of the share which the Persian Government might be able to take of the produce of the land under a political aspect of the scheme. Mr. Van Roggen’s Ahwaz scheme raises the political question of the position of the Sheikh of Muhammerah well known to be the most powerful of all the Arab chiefs in this part of Persia. Mn Consul McDouall wrote some time ago to me about this. He says he had an interview with Mr. Darcher, who is the Director of Agriculture in Teheran, and who came up here to Ahwaz in February 1905 to examine the lands of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme. M. Darcher was of opinion that Mr. Van Roggen exaggerated the Certain difficulties not appreciatad by Mr. probable Crop which his lands^ WOuld pro- yan Roggen. duce and did not fully appreciate the diffi culty of arranging to take up lands belonging to tribal cultivators as all lands in the Arab districts do whether actually cultivated at any one time or not. Mr. Consul McDouall himself is of opinion that “ it is a very difficult question to arrange this. These semi-nomadic Arabs An important opinion. would resent any one else cultivating land they have formerly cultivated and yet might not be prepared to pay for irrigation of them. The Sheikh might manage it, no one else.” The last sentence which I have italicised is an important one coming from Mr. MacDouall, who is in a position to know the ins and outs of the matter better than $ny one else. 134. I mentioned in my diary for the 4th February 1905 that Mr. Van Roggen approached the Sheikh of Muham- The Sheikh’s views. merah with a view to finding out_ whether he would co-operate in arranging for the transfer of land from the tribesmen. The Sheikh, on learning from Mr. Van Roggen that the latter had no formal authority to discuss the question raised, refused to discuss it and at that stage the matter appears to have remained, as he (Mr. Van Roggen) was asked, just before he left Ahwaz in April last, whether he could give any information about the Sheikh’s position and replied that he could not, as “ I do not know the Persian Government’s intention on this subject.” 135. I think I have said enough to show Many points in the scheme require prior ccnsi- {.^3^ there are many points which require deration - previous settlement before a really correct forecast of revenue can be made in respect of the scheme under review, and that no one can be expected to deal with these points in the present possible state of knowledge of them. However, as regards Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme it is to be •' Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme condemned as condemned from every point of view. ^ It immature. js immature in its present state of inception and requires much further investigation. As Mr. Van Roggen left^ it, when fie went away, there were many gaps, some of which it has been possible to fill in, but as will have been seen from what has been said above, the scheme had evi dently not been thought out by Mr. Van Roggen at all. The amount of level ling which he appears to have considered quite sufficient was wholly inadequate. * Again the scheme is extravagantly costly Costly ’ for the area which it is to deal with, costing as it does about 5 times as mucH as the most costly work in India. It is not adapted to the features of the ground, to Not suitable. slope and drainage of the country. The latter it crosses in the most reckless fashion. This is due to its being a sort of combined reservoir and irrigation scheme, which gives it the merit—aIO \ doubtful one-of being unique. Finally the scheme is wholly unsuited to the needs of the people and their capacity for dealing with public works and more especially irrigation works. When it is considered that the small irrigation chan nels near Shuster are wholly mismanaged, if it can be said they are managed at all, and the benefits they might confer on the land between the Ab-i-Shateit and the Ab-i-Gargar absolutely thrown to one side, there is not much chance of any such scheme as that proposed by Mr. Van Roggen being suitable here. By forcing on the people the presence of a staff of well trained European Engineers it would no doubt be possible to keep up the proposed works at some expense. Such a staff of Engineers must come under the control of the Central Government at Teheran and intrigue and friction will be sure to result. 136. If any scheme of irrigation is to be Can it be replaced by a.more suitable scheme. carried out here it must, at any rate in the first instance, be of the very simplest possible kind and one that will pay finan cially and pay fairly well at least, without any juggling with figures and random revenue forecasts and, though I give the opinion with a certain amount of hesita tion, it is most probable that it would best be worked entirely through the Sheikh of Muhammerah and should be adapted to his requirements rather than to those of the Persian Government. While not able to say whether such an alternative is possible I am decidedly of opinion that Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is quite out of the question. a 1 * 4[ConfidefltiaU Ko. 176, dated Bushire, the 16th (received 24th) April 1905. From — Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resilentin the Persian Gulf, 'fo—S. M. Fraser, Esq., C.I.E., Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to refer to Foreign Department letter No. 3855 E. A., dated nth November, in which I was desired to submit my views, after consult ing the local officers, on the irrigation schemes projected for Arabistan. Unfortunately the above communication reached Bushire too late to catch me at Ahwaz on return from the Bakhtiyari country, and since then Lieutenant Lorimer’s enforced absence from head-quaners has prevented him from communi cating his final views to me. l have now received them and hasten to deal with the several points on which I was desired to report. {The general aspect of the irrigation question, with special reference to the probable attitude of the Sheikh of Mohammerah with regard therteo ) 2 . That the tract which it is proposed to irrigate possesses a soil eminently suitable for the purpose there seems no room for doubt, and the fact that such a well-known specialist as Sir William Willcocks as the result of his recent visit is enthusiastic of the results likely to be obtained from a scheme of a similar nature, projected for the neighbouring regions under Turkish jurisdiction, constitutes sufficient grounds for the hope that from an agricultural point of view the results of scientific irrigation in Arabistan would proportionately prove no less satisfactory. This premise being assumed, the general aspect of the question seems to resolve itself into an analysis of Sheikh Khazal’s attitude towards the project and the probable effect of its accomplishment upon his personal fortunes and upon those interests which we possess in common with him. In the reports of Mr. Lorimer, which I enclose there will be found divers indi- No. ioj, diteii 28th February 1905. cations of the Sheikh s sentiments in No. 133, dated 4tii April i960. regard to the scheme generally from which the Government of India will be able to draw their own conclusions, but it appears \ to me that Lieutenant Lorimer sums them up correctly when he writes that the attitude of the Sheikh towards any scheme not controlled by himself is, at heart, | one of opposition, and that as regards the particular project recently put forward by M. Van Roggen, his devout hope is that it will prove unworkable. • The reasons and apprehensions which incline Sheikh Khazal to this attitude ; are to my mind sound and well founded ; indeed I think that there can be little doubt that any system of irrigation affecting Arabistan, in which the Persian Government entered to the extent contemplated in the present proposals would inevitably effect the gradual extinction of the ruler of Mohammerah as a semi independent and hereditary Arab feudatory of His Majesty the Shah. Mr. Lorimer in the course of his last report observes that “ the ownership of the land does not appear likely to raise questions wffiich will call for any action or decision on our part.” Perhaps not on our part, but I hesitate to endorse such a sanguine forecast on this point generally. In fact a perusal of the Vice-ConsuFs reports makes it evident that even now w r e have arrived at no very positive understanding either as to what the correct boundaries of the Sheikh’s territories are, or as to the precise conditions on which he holds much of the land under his jurisdiction. Sheikh Khazal seems to have very hazy ideas on the subject himself. Under these circumstances it is difficult to conceive how any irrigation scheme in Arabistan of the nature contemplated and involving land settlement could take shape without giving rise to many awkward ques tions of tenure and ownership, from the examination of which the Sheikh has 1 [C 8 IFDJnothing to gain and risks the loss of a good deal, and with regard to which we should have no status to intervene between him and the Central Government. He no doubt considers it his best policy to talk confidently about his tenure, but I conjecture that the fear that any irrigation scheme, other than one controlled and worked by him independently, would afford the Persian Government an opening for raising awkward questions with regard to it, is one of his chief reasons for being opposed to the scheme. Moreover, however sanguine Sheikh Khazal may profess to be as to his ability to square the Nizam-us-Sultanah in connection with lands over which they have joint rights, we are well a^are that the Shah’s government is imbued with a constant and steadfast desire to achieve more effective control over the ruler of Mohammerah than they are at present able to exercise, and this being so it is very unlikely that they would fail to seize the opportunity to make the undefined claims of the Nizam-us-Sultanah in Arabistan a stalking horse for the accomplishment of their ends in this respect. Sheikh Khazal well knows however that whatever his personal wishes may be, he is only able to give effect to them so long as our interests run parallel to his and we are prepared to support him. On these grounds he wisely refrains from expressing himself too decidedly, lest we should find him inconvenient, and even tells us that he commits his interests to our care as he did when the question of the admission of the Belgian Customs to his territory arose. In that case, though he bowed to the inevitable and accepted our advice, the subject has always remained a sore point with him. The extent to 'which the Sheikh of Mohamnurah is entitled to be consulted as to the details of the scheme. 3 . Assuming as I think I may that we should under no circumstances permit the intervention of a third power to assist in the coercion of the Sheikh, I think this problem should find its answer in a consideration to the extent to which, supposing we held aloof altogether, he would be able to oppose details of the project which he considered damaging to his own interests. Although the precise nature of his rights of ownership over the land to be irrigated may be in doubt, it seems clear at all events that the tribes which inhabit' the area are under his effective control for good or evil, and as the Persian Government apparently admit through Mr. Van Roggen that his active co-operation is essential for the successful execution of the scheme, so it follows conversely that he is entitled to^be consulted very fiully as to the working details ; and I am at one with Mr. Lorimer in holding this opinion. In practice, if doubts were to arise as to whether particular items of the scheme were or were not compatible with his interests, he would no doubt say, as he has done before, that he will accept the item if we, his friends, say that it is in his interests to do so, or that he has no other alternative. In this manner I fear we shall be placed in a somewhat delicate position in cases w^here our interests are not identical with his. The probable lines on which an arrangement might best be effected. 4 . Lieutenant Lorimer makes some suggestions under this head, though with a good deal of misgiving. They speak for themselves and do not seem to require special comment from me except that they appear to possess troublesome possibilities. Would not an arrangement on the following lines be feasible ? The Persian Government assuming the r61e of the parental suzerain would supply the funds (borrowed from us) and carry out the irrigation project for the Sheikh of Mohammerah, on condition of his paying a fixed tribute in return for the benefits derived, the amount of which w'ould be regulated so as to represent a given precentage on the outlay, sufficient to cover the interest which the Persian Government would be paying us for their loan and to give them in addition a fair extra percentage on their investment. The tribute payable by the Sheikhof Mohammerah under such an arrangement might be re-assessed every five years, until the permanent results of the system had been accurately gauged. Perhaps the primary difficulty in an arrangement of this nature would be the prp- ; vision of security for the regular payment of the stipulated amount by the Sheikh to the Central Government ; but if it were feasible fundamentally such a scheme would at all events provide a definite revenue and would at the same time obviate the generation of awkward questions of ownership and boundary, likely to result in a manner adverse to those interests of the Sheikh which are indirectly ours also. Under these circumstances arrangements for the import of labour would also rest with Sheikh Khazal, but if he were directly interested in the success of the project, I see no reason why he should not be in a position to import as good settlers as the Persian Government could introduce themselves. It is hardly to be hoped that such a scheme would suit the policy of the Persian Government, but it would certainly be very much more palatable to the Sheikh and convenient to us. 5. In paragraph 3 of their letter under reply the Government of India desired me to forward with my report a large scale map giving certain items of information, and sent me spare copies of the appropriate sheets of the survey map to form a basis for it. I sent these on to Lieutenant Lorimer, but as will be seen from paragraph 2 of his letter No. 133 accompanying, he claims greater accu racy for a separate sketch which he has drawn up on the same scale and which I think it best to forward in original after taking a tracing of it. The information which he gives therein and in the body of his report, though unsatisfying, is the most precise at present obtainable and I can add nothing to it. 6. In the foregoing I endeavoured to comply with the instructions conveyed in the Deputy Secretary’s letter of nth November, but since that communica tion reached me the aspect of the irrigation questions seems to have consider ably changed, and moreover Government is now in receipt of the expert opinion of Major Morton on the subject. I notice in the course of the latter’s diary for the petiod ending February 1 ^th that he has expressed the decided opinion that a profitable scheme of irrigation cannot be devised which will allow the navigability of the Lower Karun to be preserved ; and consequently that if any such project is to be persevered with it will necessitate the substitution of rail way for steamer traffic between Mohammerah and Ahwaz. This railway connec tion with the project introduces a number of side issues which collectively pre sent to my mind a problem of extreme difficulty, and a possible rock on which our interests and those of the Sheikh of Mohammerah may easily split, but it is a problem which is doubtless being subjected to close analysis at the wise hands of Government and which seems to lie beyond my horizon. 7. The maps and printed papers received with Foreign Department letter No. 3855-E.A. were sent confidentially to His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul at Ahwaz for information and return, but he has forgotten to comply, and I am therefore unable to include the spare maps with this letter. A copy of this communication has not been sent to the Legation. No. 105, dated the 28th February 1905. From— Lieutenant D. L. R. Lorimer, His Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To— Major P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to refer to the questions of the Karun irrigation scheme on which you call for a report in your No. 143, dated 31st January 1905, Various causes have conspired to prevent me as yet from obtaining the information which would be necessary for dealing with the subject with any 3Against these favourable prospects we have to set the facts, (i) that a closer connection would be established between Arabistan and Tehran; (2) that increased prosperity would attract foreign enterprise and competition so that commercially, and politically we might not continue to enjoy the same absence of rivalry as we do at present; (3) that a scheme sufficiently large to pay would probably destroy the navigability of the lower river, so destroyin 0- our principal pied d terre under present conditions. The control of the chief means of transport, of which we have for years enjoyed a self-made monopoly, is an asset which we could least of all afford to forfeit when it would become of increased value and when the prospects of competition in all lines of commercial activity would be tremendously enlarged. If, on the other hand, we could exchange the purely fictitious monopoly of the Karun navigation for complete control of a railway between Ahwaz and Mohammerah we might regard ourselves as gainers rather than losers. It would be impossible, however, to remove all the water from the Karun probable that small native craft could ply. But as far as goods are concerned, it is, I believe, a maxim that a railway cannot compete with a waterway. Without expert knowledge however, it is futile to pursue this or the various alternatives which rise to one’s mind. The Sheikh s interests are very similar to ours. The more the irrigation, the less will the country remain under his undisputed control. Powerful Persian or foreign interests will be created which will tend to restrict his despotic powers. At the same time if his interests are properly safeguarded he, would naturally share in the increased wealth of the country. I have already referred to the existing irrigation from the lower reaches of the river. Any scheme which would withdraw the necessary water-supply from the neighbourhood of Mohammerah and the Bahmeshir would entail the sacrifice of his date lands in that region. I am told that these are flooded every day automatically at high tide, i.e.y of course that the tide banks up fresh water of the river and causes it to rise to the level of the distributaries. With any large reduction in the flow of the Karun, it seems probable to me that the mouth of the Karun and the Bahmeshir channel would tend to silt up, a sequel which considered apart from other future compensations would be inj urious. As regards the persons who would be directly benefited by a system of irrigation with its headworks at Ahwaz, far the largest, if not the sole, states in the territory irrigated would be held by the Sheikh. On the left bank the limit of irrigation on the north would, I suppose, be the line of the low hills which run south-east from Ahwaz. South of this to the coast is all the Sheikh’s territory, but to the east the Nizam-us-Sultanah and the Mushir-ud-Dowla are said to hold a tract on either side of the Jerrahi river in joint equal partnership. On the right bank the Nizam-us-Sultanah has land stretching from the Anafijih to Hawiza, but from Ahwaz down to Mohammerah the Sheikh has a strip of land along the river which opposite Ahwaz at any rate is 8 farsakhs (say 28 miles)wide. Hawiza has its own water-supply in the Kerkha; and I do not know of any independent tribes on either side who would be affected by a scheme such as that projected. Major Morton calculates roughly that works on the Karun at Ahwaz could supply water to irrigate some 4 or 5 million acres. This would, I think, cover all the area available. Van Roggen only proposes irrigating 2,471 acres a year for 24 successive years, i.e.y his scheme only contemplates the ultimate irrigation of 59, 304 acres. 'Note .—Unless they were supplied by canals from Ahwaz(?) in which case produce could be transported down the canals in barges.” without sealing the fate of the date groves at Mohammerah and on the Bahmeshir, to which the Sheikh would never consent, and so long as water remained it seems 5 (C81FD)x 6 fllnwiM The construction of storage lakes and tanks to which he is compelled by the consideration of the necessity of maintaining the navigability of the Karun and the Bahmeshir, add an enormous item to the initial cost of construction. I do not propse to go into a detailed criticism of his scheme, which is Major Morton’s province, but it is pretty evident on the face of it, that as a paying investment for money it is not feasible. No. 133, dated the 4th April 1905. F rom Lieutenant D. L. R. Lorimer, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul, Ahwaz, To—MAJOR P. Z. Cox, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to return to the question of the Karun irrigation scheme, which I partially discussed in my No. 105, dated 28th February 1905. 2. I have endeavoured to prepare a map of this part of Arabistan. It is constructed from survey sheet No. 72, Huddleston’s chart of the Karun, and Major Burton’s traverse of the Ramuz-Mashhur-Fellahiah route, and I believe that it gives a more accurate presentment of the situation of the two rivers, Karun and Jerrahi, in relation to each other than any existing map. I have been able to indicate roughly the territory which the Nizam-us-Sultanah lays claim. The actual importance of these boundaries is largely diminished by the remarks on the subject of the Sardar Arfa which I shall have occasion to mention further on. As regards tribal boundaries it is impossible to give these with any degree of accuracy. Tribal distinctions are falling into abeyance for all practical pur poses on the Karun, in the case of tribes who are directly under the Sardar Arfa's rule. To the west there are certainly distinct tribal organisms whose aptness is emphasised by their more or less frequent embroilments. But these tribes are nomadic in character and no very precise limits can be assigned to them. Moreover all those who would be within touch of an irrigation system radiating from Ahwaz are under the control of the Sardar Arfa. 3. I now pass on to the results of an interview which I had with the latter on March 30th. I asked the Sheik h to favour me with his views as to the question of irrigation and as to what terms he would put forward as satisfying his own interests. In case the matter should ever progress beyond the present enquiry stage, it was desirable for us to know exactly what he considered his rightful claims on such an undertaking in order that we might be able to watch over his interests should they be threatened. The Sheikh said he was quite unable to make a reply. He put himself unreservedly in our hands. The question was one which required mutual con sultation (mashwarat) and he was ready to adhere to any course we recommended. Whatever we approved he would accept. On the other hand, if work were begun on any conditions, which did not satisfy us, he would put a stop to all proceedings by force. Continuing on the same subject, Haji Rais, who was present, eventually said that there were two conditions which the Sheikh would hold indispensable. The first was that all people settled on land irrigated should be Arabs of the country. The second appeared to be that his pecuniary interests should be secured, but I failed to obtain any clear enunciation of this condition. It is a curious failing of these people to draw back when on the verge of commit ting themselves to a statement. 4. Abandoning this line further questioning with the object of obtaining figures on which to base financial calculations elicited the following facts. In his own territory where the Sardar Arfa provides seed, after deduction from the gross produce of the Government demand, say y^, the balance is divided in the proportion of } to the Sheikh and J to the Fellah or cultivator.Where the cultivator provides the seed, after deduction of the Government demand, the balance is divided equally between the Sheikh and the cultivator. The Sheikh explained that this was in the case of tribes, such as the Bawiya, who were his relatives and hence enjoyed very favourable treatment. But he reiterated his statement that he left it to us to fix what we considered fair terms for him. 5. With regard to the ownership of the land the Sheikh stated that the land on the left bank of the Karun w r as his own undisputed territory. This does not square with general report which allows the Nizam-us-Sul- tanah property on both sides of the Jerrahi. The Sheikh of Ahwaz asserts that his boundary on the west of the Jerrahi runs from near Cham Sabbi to near Shakha and then descends to the neighbourhood of Fellahiah. 6 . The question of the possession of land on the right bank he said was immaterial as he understood that Van Roggen’s proposal did not contemplate any operations on that side of the river. As a question standing on its own merits the land was, in assured fact, his own undivided property. He gave the following history of the Nizam-us-Sultanah’s claim. Maula Abdullah (of Hawiza), in years gone by, sought a port on the right bank of the Karun from the Sheikh’s predecessor, Nasrat-ul-Mulk, Sheikh Jabar. Sheikh Jabar granted him a spot known as um-ubTammer. Later they became alienated and Maula Abdullah claimed the whole of the right bank of the Karun. It was agreed to accept the evidence or decision of Sheikh Fares of Fellahiah as final. Sheikh Mizal had now succeeded to the place of Sheikh Jabar. It unfortunately chanced that he fell out with the Fellahiah Sheikh and so forfeited the support which truth owed to him. At this point the Nizam-us-Sultanah entered into the affair and attached himself to Sheikh Mizal’s interests helped to buy back the land from the Persian Government (?) for ; him. The Sheikh holds a letter from the Nizam-us-Sultanah in evidence of the real part played in this tiansaction. Having accomplished this service however the Nizam-us-Sultanah turned round and declared that he held a partnership with Sheikh Mizal in the owner ship of the land. Prudential reasons restrained Sheikh Mizal from denouncing the claim, and Sheikh Khazal on his accession to power found it inexpedient to bring the disputed ownership to an open test. It is now generally stated that he pays the Nizam-us-Sultanah an annual sum of 3,000 Tomans in respect of all rights over this tract. Left to his own resources there is little question that the Nizam would not secure a penny out of his Arab tenants. 7 . The value of the Nizam-us-Sultanah’s territorial claims was further incidentally touched on. Mr. Gaskin having raised a random question as to the possible advantages of constructing a dam on the Kerkha Al-Kut Nahr Hashim, the Sheikh expressed an opinion very favourable to such a scheme. Subsequently pressed for an answer as to what line of conduct he would adopt to secure his own rights against those of the Nizam-us-Sultanah in case the question of irrigating any of the land in dispute came to the front, the Sheikh satisfied himself with the assertion that he would be able to secure his rights. But later he urged that if at any time the Indian Government thought or heard of any scheme of irrigation in the Nahr Hashim direction (presumably either from the Karun or Karkha) that they should communicate secretly with him as I understood to square matters with the Nizam-us-Sultanah before the latter became aware of what was going forward. Haji Rais repeated a statement he made to me in summer that the Nizam- us-Sultanah had approached the Sheikh several times in the past four years with a view to inducing him to purchase the land, but that his terms were excessive. 7 ^8. The mental attitude of the Sheikh towards any schemes of irrigation not originating with himself and not to be controlled entirely by himself is, I am convinced, one of opposition. Where however the motive force is the Persian Government, he shrinks from committing himself to an absolute negative or a declared opposition. Believing that our interests in Arabistan correspond more closely than those of any other with his own, and with some faith in our readiness to contend for his interests, he has decided to throw himself, for the present at least, unreservedly on our judgment and support. I doubt little that his devout hope is that we will find the scheme opposed to our own interests. He referred, unprompted, to a point which I suggestedin my last letter—the fact that a scheme, such as that proposed,would lead to a diminution of his status and authority in the country. 9. To review the question of irrigation briefly in the light of the cautiously expressed views of the Sheikh. The ownership of the land does not appear likely to raise questions which will call for any action or decision on our part. The development of the resources of the land irrigated seems likely to be seriously affected by the determination of the Sheikh to exclude non-Arab immigrants. For the Arabs of these parts have not the merit of being good agriculturists. On the other hand, were Persian or others introduced together with a Persian administration, it would undoubtedly be a blow to the unity of Arabistan, which is gradually forming itself under the policy of the present Sheikh. A Sheikh strong in his own house, and with a united population at his back, should be, and I believe is, the aim of our own policy in this quarter. The claims of the Sheikh on the produce of the irrigated area unless limited to an extent which will probably not meet his acceptance will be a serious factor in determining the financial possibilities of an irrigation scheme. The Ahwaz scheme will already present many unfavourable features—high initial cost owing to the absence of trained labour and expense in obtaining mate rial ; probably expensive staff (where none now exists a revenue staff will presum ably have to be created and maintained out of profits in addition to the irrigation staff proper); probably indifferently efficient administration j indifferent cultiva tion^ It might perhaps be argued that irrigated cultivation is likely to produce heavier, more certain and more remunerative crops than where as at present it is dependent on a varying rainfall and that in conseqnence the Sheikh might expect to find that a very much lower percentage of produce than that he takes at present would yield him an equal and more certain revenue, the comparison being based on area. Such questions must be commonplace in Indian settlement work, and the Sheikh’s frame of mind on the subject could not be more reasonable than it is, judged by his refusal to make any suggestions and his insistance that he would accept our views. It would simplify matters and do away with the practical difficulty of assess ing crops if a fixed sum per acre irrespective of the nature of crop could be fixed as the Sheikh’s due. But the fact that this system appears unknown in the country and the fluctuations or rather continuous depreciation in the value of the currency might be drawbacks to choosing a cash basis in preference to a produce basis. Further I suppose that due to pests or other causes even irrigated crops may be subject to bad years, when the Sheikh would enjoy an unfair advantage 10. It is unnecessary for me to dwell on the impracticability of the scheme now under preparation by Graaf van Roggen. I owe my knowledge of it to Major Morton who has no doubt imparted full particulars with his opinion thereon to the Government. It only seems proper to urge the necessity of preventing this foolish or knavish adventurer from practising on the ignorance of the Persian Government with a view to making a fortune for himself, but with the ultimate result of bring ing discredit on an enterprise which in competent hands might prove, not only feasible, but calcluated to promote the interests of all concerned in it. 8 G, C.

Morton, R.E., on Special Duty, To— The Secretary to the (Government of India, Foreign Department, With reference to your No. 180-E. A. of 14th January last and in con- tmuation of my previous letters on the same subject, I have the honour to submit a copy of extract from my diary for the period ending 12th March 1905. 2. I also send herewith a copy of a note I wrote on details of Mr. Van Roggen s scheme, as regards the distribution of water to a block of land (gross area 3,400 acres) to be irrigated in one year. This note I sent demi-officially to Mr. Van Roggen with a view to finding out whether what I had written, from information he gave me verbally, at the interview I had with him, as mentioned in my diary for 23rd February, represented with fair accuracy his present proposals. I append a copy of his reply and send, in original, the plan I made illustrating the note, which also Mr. Van Roggen accepts as fairly illus trating his present scheme. 3 . It is hardly necessary to make comments on the matter contained in the note. Mr. Van Roggen takes the ground to be irrigated to be as flat as the proverbial billiard table, or he would not say that his channels are to have their beds level. Attention may be drawn, however, more especially to the fact that his large channels will necessitate the execution of an enormous amount of earthwork. I asked him in a previous note I wrote to him (of which I have not thought it necessary to send you a copy, as it contains only matter of a very technical and explanatory nature) why he could not at once take up the irrigation of the whole of the blocks (gross area 85,000 acres) which at present he proposes to deal with in the course of 24 years. His reply was as follows ;— “ The system, which I adopted and which has been adopted by a private firm on a small scale near Assouan consists of the following. ,, ** The Persian Government constructs the dam and digs the canals through the land to be cultivated. The produces will be the property of the Govern ment.” “ This cultivation will be done as much as possible by machines, the population baing too scarce to do the hand work.” “ The system is consequently altogether different from that in use in Egypt with its dense population and consisting of providing the water by the Govern ment, the population working the land, against pay of water duties and taking the produces for their own benefit.” “ It would be an impossible work to dig 124,000,000 cubic metres, or I about 4,400,000,000 cubic feet of earth in a couple of years, so this must be | divided over many years, say 24.” 4. Prom the portion of Mr. Van Roggen’s reply which I have marked, it is obvious that he calculates the amount of earthwork alone to be done in excavating his channels for the 24 years period blocks to be about 4,400 million cubic feet. Now I do not know what Mr. Van Roggen, if he has at all considered the matter, calculates the earthwork wall cost. He is going to employ machinery as far as possible. This will mean costly European supervi sion. Local labor is about one and-a-half times as expensive as in the Punjab. I do not think, with the large channels, he contemplates making, he can possibly do the earthwork, on the average, for less than the equivalent of rupees five per thousand cubic feet. In this case, for the 24 years period blocks, the cost of the earthwork in the channels abone will be— 4,400,000,000 x A X £ roVo sterling, or £1,400,000 sterling. Thus, with the dam and the navigating locks w 7 hich he intends to build, but excluding 1 (C6FD)navigating looks which it is probable he will have to add owing to the slope of the country, the scheme will not cost much less than 2 million sterling, a prohibitive cost, unless, as is unlikely, money is no object. This cost is for an irrigation scheme which is after 21 years reckoned to be capable of irrigating an area of 24),000 hectares, or about 59,000 acres annually, at the rate of 2,471 acres ( 1,000 hectares) for the first year, twice that amount in the second year, and so on. 5. It would not be possible for any one to make an accurate forecast of what profit it is likely that the Persian Government will obtain from an acre of cultivated land under irrigation. There are too many uncertain factors in the case. In India and Egypt known water-rates are imposed, and therefore, so long as the supply of water does not fail, a known revenue accrues, and the only uncertain factor, if there is one, is the number of acres which will be irrigated annually. Here, on the other hand, the Persian Government are themselves to work the land, pace Mr. Van Koggen. They have not, I believe, been successful in their public works management. If they were fortunate enough to obtain the services of engineers 3 skilled in irrigation works management, they might even work the Ahwaz scheme satisfactorily, i.e., without letting things, so to speak, slide ; but I think it may be accepted that experience in India would prove that so heavy an ex penditure as two million sterling is not in the least likely to give a profit on 69,000^ acres, not even brought under irrigation as soon as the necessary works are finished but piecemeal at the progressive rate of 2,471 acres per annum. It is impossible to say what might he the expenses of establishment and up keep in a country where no public works department exists, nor even what proportion of the real profits would find their way into the Shah’s treasury in a country where so many doors of pilfering are open. The question of what per* centage would have to be paid on the capital borrowed would have to he known. There are other points which might be mentioned, but I think it may safely be said that the chances of any such costly scheme as that of Mr. Van Roggen’s paying even a small percentage are of the remotest, and most people would hesitate long before sinking so large a sum in so visionary a scheme. 6 . In the above calculations for the amount of earthwork, I am not clear whether Mr. YanRoggen has taken that required if he decides to make sup plementary reservoirs in addition to his canal reservoirs. He has not appa rently made up his mind whether such additional reservoirs will be required or not. They do not appear to me to he feasible. No doubt it is possible that for the first few years of the working of his scheme, if attempted, he would not, for the small areas to be irrigated, need such supplementarv re- servoirs Eorhis 24^ years’ scheme he himself has calculated that he will want 204 milhon cubic metres of water for the irrigation of the land during 140 days. In a note he lias given me he states that he does not intend to draw water from the river at all except in December, January, February and March, so that I suppose the number of days he gives, viz., 140, represents not the number of consecutive days for which he calculates he must store a supplv but^ the proportion, viz of days for which a stored supply is required during the period 1 st April to end of November—which is 244 days. At anv rate he calculates that for the whole year there will be two periods, viz., 1 st December to end of March, when he can draw what supply he wants from the river, and the other, 1 st April to end of November, when he must have a stored supply for 110 days’ irrigation. The total storage capacity required for this period for the 24 years’ scheme is 204 million cubic metres, of which 124 milhon cubic metres can be stored in the large canals. The balance of 80 mill.ou cubic metres ( 2 - 82i milliol i cubic feet) must be found in reservoirs under the abovementioned assumption that no water is to be drawn off the river from 1 st April to end of November. It is at least open to doubt whether R&lt;??rgeus al.owance of only 140 days’ supply i n a period of demand of '44 days is sufficient. Among other things, he calculates that in November he will have about 1 J million cubic metres left in his canals, and that he can draw the whole of it off for irrigation purposes. 7. Hr. Van Roggen evidently fights shy of reservoirs other than his canal leservoirs, as he lias stated m one place that the balance of water required in addition to that storable in his canals may “ either be found by3 ■)g*m i 8 . It may be said in conclusion that— (a) Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is not sufficiently far enough worked cut tor one to form a definite opinion on its feasibility, and necessary Jovels are lacking, and when taken may show that some of the present proposals must be modified. (b) As far as one can judge the scheme is in all probability one wbi&lt; will prove costly to a prohibitive degree and consequently wi not be remunerative.

Extract from Diary of Major Morton on special duty. Vote.—All that was written relating to 1st March should have been written as on 28th February. 1st March I96&gt;o.—Started taking discharge of Kmam just below Ahwaz rapids at about 8 a.m., using Van Roggen’s theodolite as on previous occasion Van Roggen’s lower gauge read 14 0—14 1 at 7^30 a.m. Times of passing of floats taken by surveyor (duffadar) and passing of floats noted by two of lorimer’s sowars. Reynolds of Blosse Lynch came about 10 to assist in taking soundings. Suggested putting in poles at intervals as guide to points for taking soundings. After completing about fths of the discharge from left bank moved to right bank and completed discharge about 5-30 p.m., delay occurrino- in getting the floats which were carried off to my house by mistake. The current was setting towards the right bank and floats did not run true. There was also a slight cross wind and two or three of right bank floats were carried ashore. Soundings near right bank taken by Reynolds’ men and surveyor. Gauge (lower) read 13-9—14-0 after discharge. Probably the discharge will be under the correct amount. 2nd March 7.9^5.—Working out angular distances and plotting discharge. In the evening went out with surveyor to commence survey of river towards Bandikir. Propose to do with help of surveyor who has not finished the plan of Ah wag and Nasseri as far as required at present. Did not get very far and came back in the dark. Stiff breeze from south-west or west made it difficult to work. “ Jiellam ” native boat long expected at last arrived with instruments (among them level and two pairs of staves and chain) from Calcutta. 3rd March 1905 .—Odious day with strong breeze knocked over and smashed glass of prismatic compass surveyor was using. Teaching surveyor to keep a field book which he does not understand. Time also wasted in fixing points which the khallasies do not understand how to deal with. Only got out about 4 miles and returned long after dark. Very cloudy and stormy with lightning to west and east. Found much wheat growing along line of survey, left river bank, but it is in very backward state and little more than above ground, owing to late and deficient rainfall. Came across one small cut about 2-0' wide from river for irrigation purposes. No shallow. 4th March 1905 .—Got up too hopelessly seedy and stiff after tramp yesterday and could not go out. Sent on surveyor to plane-table along left bank of river and gave him 3 mules and 2 shouldaris, so that he need not Enclosures.V 4 return to Ahwaz and so waste time. The Sheikh (Nasseri) gave him escort of one armed man while out yesterday surveying. Got reply from Van Roggen to my note on details of his scheme sent him on 26th February. {Note .—A copy of this note and Van Roggen’s reply sent with this diary). Wilson, Tod and ' Lorimer left about l-SO p.m. for Weiss en route to Bandikir and Dizful. Arranged they should wait at Bandikir for me till Wednesday. Completed calculation for discharge taken on 1 st instant. Results :—Discharge 18,490 cusecs. Area of water-way 9,669 square feet. Mean velocity 1-91 feet per second. R. = 7,984. Mean gauge lower 14-0 decimetres (=4'59 above its zero). 5 th March 1905 .—Left Nasseri about 7 a.m. with 5 coolies, tindal in shape of Ali, a carpenter employed by Lynch’s (who speaks a little Hindustani). Took escort of one Sheikh’s man, armed more for show than use. Using new set of khalassies (coolies) had some trouble in getting work done. Met surveyor about 5 mile out near first village of Sayad Abbas where is his camp. Rode a mule to fix stations and rode in after dark to my camp about 3 miles beyond Sayad Abbas at village of Kot Sayad Amir. 6 th March 1905 .—Made as early a start as possible for Sayad Abbas. Delayed by rain at starting. Strong wind and some rain last night. One of my tents partially blown dowoj pegs not properly fixed in soft ground. On reaching Sayad Abbas met surveyor and took him and his party with me to get on faster than on previous day, his men being now fairly well trained in chaining. Spent a long time near Sayad Abbas searching for station fixed on 3rd March. Could not find it and must get it in when returning later to Ahwaz, Measured along telegraph line which was from Bundar Nasseri to Shuster via Weiss and Bandikir. The posts of the telegraph line are at varying intervals, and some short and some long. Distances, I find, are for rough practical purposes, 200 feet on the average. Strong mirage and shimmer when sun came up. Got on well and reached 16th station, a distance of about 7 miles as against about 4f done yesterday. Returned to camp at Sayad Amir after dark. 7th March 1905 .—Got off about 6-30 a.m. and continued survey, sending on camp to Weiss. Fine warm day. Reached Weiss about 2-30 and sent on camp to next village, Kotulnedafar, about 3 miles on. No telegraph station at Weiss though line passes through village. Met Lorimer’s man yesterday afternoon carrying his dak and mine. Sent him on after taking my letters. Met him again this afternoon at Weiss returning. Lorimer and party he says left for Dizful yesterday morning. Telegraph line a wretched affair. Wire generally tied to posts or to iron stable fixed to katcha pole. Sometimes wire on ground. Insulators few though possibly fixed up in first instance. No wonder mes sages are difficult to send. Reached Kotulnedafar which is small village of that name about 5-30 p.m. At Weiss there is what appears distinctly to be the remains of an old canal with high banks taking off at a bend in the river (Karun) at end of a straight reach from Bandikir. I met this same affair near 16th station where there was an artificial mound of stones which gives one the idea of having been some canal masonry work. 8 th March 1905 .—Broke up camp at Kotulnedafar (small) and walked to the large village of same name. Taking distances by telegraph poles the two villages are 3§th miles apart. 1 asked for some information as regards number of men in the village, but the Arabs too reticent to give information and referred me to Sheikh of Mohammerah. Great deal of country under wheat in backward condition. Have not seen any ploughs and very few cattle and no camels. Some flocks of sheep and goats. Width of river at Kotulnedafar (large) 982 feet at present water surface. According to local information rise of maximum flood above present water level works out to 23 feet, coming to l-J feet below top of right bank. The ordinary high flood which may be expected works out to 13 feet above present water level, coming just over the foreshore, a wide piece of ground thrown up by the river, about 300 feet wide, and extending about 200 yards below andl| miles above the village on left bank. Villages shown or Plant’s map as Kot Piamir and Kot Hillow Dillow are now deserted. Plant calls Kotulnedafar (small) Kot Bona Wadal. A small collection of mud huts thatched about one mile above small Kotulnedafar is said to be Sayad Mohsun.Reached Bandikir about 12th uoon. This place I make about miles above Kotulnedafar (large). Plant's map does not show a marked bend, almost right angled, in the river coming into Bandikir. A wide shoal formed on right bank covered with coarse reeds, probably what the Arabs use for thatching their huts with. This extends for about miles from a point about J mile below Bandikir. Noticeable feature of this part of country, and less so further down, is the frequent occurrence of deep ravines (Kors) running down into river and scored out by rain and possibly high floods which have passed over the land. Working out angles of traverse and plotting line, Ahwaz to Weiss. The river winds about, as Lord Curzon in his “ Persia ' says, like an unpoled worm between Ahwaz and Weiss. Prom Weiss to near Bandikir some 9 miles it runs as straight as any river can run and to make plan of this portion little more than the distance is required to be known. 9th March 1905 .—Out to see if convenient points can he fixed for a small triangulation which would fix the position of three peaks on the lower range of hills near Shuster, so that from these 3 points angles taken at intervals along the very winding river Abi Gargar up which the S S. “ Shushan ” plies would fis; with a fair amount of accuracy the bends of the river. There is no other way, short of a regular line of traverse along the river, to make anything like an accurate plan of the river. The country in the neighbourhood of Bandikir so far as it lies east of that town and on the left bank of the Abi Gargar is very much broken up by ravines flowing into the Gargar which from a point about J mile above Bandikir flows between high perpendicular banks. The river is about 200 feet wide at Bandikir and flows into the main stream Kamr (called the Abi Shateit above Bandikir) opposite where another tributary, the Biz, also joins. Further to the east is a high rolling plateau overlooking the lower plain to the south in the direction of Kotulnedafar and Ahwaz. 10th March 1905 .—Took angles to and from nearly all points marked out. Belay occurred owing to coolies removing two flags without orders. Triangula tion extends about miles from Bandikir. Require about 3 miles if possible for fixing position of peaks in range of hills near Shuster. If three such points can be fixed and clearly identified, a very fairly accurate plan of a river like the Abi Gargar or the Abi Shateit, which run towards these hills could be made without much trouble. “ Shushan ” with Kenny arrived at about 6 p.m. Had a good journey on a capital river to a place called Ansieh which he calculates to be 10 miles above Um-ul-Wawieh marked on Plant’s map of Gargar, Shateit and Biz. Beyond Ansieh steamer could not go grounding on a shingle bank. Very strong racing current, as much as 9 miles an hour in places, coming down to Bandikir on return journey. Plant's map found to be very approximate, bends are far too numerous to plot except by regular survey made along land, with accurate measurements of distances. Jungle growth dense on banks. Small brushwood mainly. Kenny says that owing to great demand for this wood at Shuster, Dizful and other towns and also by “ Shushan ' which burns wood, the supply is not likely to last more than 5 years. Wilson’s party went to Bizful overland and thence direct to Shuster. As there may not be another opportunity, I shall go by “ Shushan ' which leaves for Shuster tomorrow. Steamer goes to fetch Wilson’s party and will leave as soon as they arrive and return to Ahwaz. I shall return either by the steamer or if possible by land to Bandikir to com plete my survey there and take discharges of the 3 rivers. 11th March 1905 .—Width of Ahi Gargar measured 220 feet at Bandikir. Bepth of water about 6 feet as maximum and greatest surface velocity If feet a second. Bischarge may be taken as £x220x6xfx0*8 (co»eflBcient) =1,400 cusecs, say, which shows that this river is a very small one and that most of water in Karun at Ahwaz comes from Biz and Shateit. Kenny says Gargar is very high and in low water very difficult to navigate, as supply runs very low. Left Bandikir about 8 a.m. with coolies and tents, leaving mules to follow by road for which they will have to swim the Gargar, the best road to Shuster being on its right bank. Made good passage owing to favourable river reaching Shelalieh at 4*4 p. m. after stopping four times to allow of my taking 5 [C6FD]6 t angles to peaks of range of hills. The only really good point everywhere visible without any mistake is the curious peak called in Huddleston's, Mav Kayat Peak. The day was very unfavourable for seeing, as clouds frequently covered the hills. I took angles at a place known as Sheikh’s serai, about 3 miles above Bandikir to 4 points. At Sayad Hussain village, about 6 miles further on, No. 1 point was not visible or not possible to identify it, and Kayat Peak was not clearly visible, as it was cloud covered and angle taken to it was only approximate. At Kot Charb village, about 15 miles further on, three points were clearly identified, and I took in two others which it may be possible to use also. At Shiab mosque, about 10 miles further on, I saw four points missing No. 3 originally taken. As a rough test of what could be done in this way at any rate in clear weather, I think the results were satisfactory. Made several notes with Kenny's help about river. The bends are much more numerous and frequently run in directions different from those shown on Plant’s map. Bain fell in the evening while I commenced a small plan of Shelalieh landing place to illustrate a typical bend of the river. 12th March 1905 .—Wind and rain during the night. Heavy rain in morning. Stopped about 10 a m. while wind continued. Oil floating on river surface pro bably from naphtha springs higher up the river. Elver has risen slightly and water is much discolored, a light brown. Kenny says the river is higher than he has seen it. Has been on this river since May 1904. Rain began again about 12 noon. The heaviest rain 1 have seen since I came here and like the Indian monsoon rain at Bombay. Took a sample of the river water at surface and at 8 feet below surface. Depth of water (not at deepest) near Shushan is 10 feet. Rain con tinued at intervals to 5 p.m. Wrote out copy of diary for Foreign Office and letter. Could not go into Shuster, as owing to bad weather, mules would not come out, and it would in any case have been impossible to go 7 miles on slip pery soil. Commenced yesterday and completed today calculations of triangles, angles of which were measured at Bandikir on 10 th. One set of angles required to complete triangles laid out. Not possible to take this series of angles owing to darkness setting in. Shall send off letters by special man tomorrow after copy^ ing out letter for Foreign Office. Camp via Ahwaz ; The 12th March 1905. W. R. MORTON, Major, B. R Note on details of Mr. Van Roggen's scheme for irrigation of land near A hwaz. The whole land to be irrigated is 34,400 hectares or 85,000 acres in round numbers, gross area, and is parcelled out into large blocks to be dealt with annually over a course of 25 years. Thus the extent of each block to be taken up for irrigation in a year is ^4^ hectares or 3,540 acres, gross area. The nett area of each of the blocks to be actually irrigated is 1,000 hectares or 2,471 acres. The difference between the two areas, gross and nett, will be taken up by channels, banks, roads, villages, etc. The water for irrigation will be supplied by a channel capable of being navigated and taking off from the river Karun above the village of Ahwaz and running approximately parallel to the river through the high ground near Ahwaz. This will conduct the water to the large block of land to be irrigated in the first year; and as year by year similar fresh blocks of land are taken for irrigation, other channels of like capacity and also suitable for navigation will be made for supplying water to the additional blocks so added. Taking at present the first year’s large block the main channel shown A. on the accompanying diagram will run from the river through the block of land, approximately from, north to south. Where this main channel enters the block of land sluices shown E. E. on either side will be provided for supplying water as required to the distributing channels B. B. on either side which run parallel to the main chan nel A. At right angles to B B. run other distributing channels C.G.C of which there will be 20 on each side of the channels B. B.The heads of these distributing channels C.O.C will be provided with sluices for controlling the supply of water. Parallel to CCC are the water-courses in the banks of which cuts can be made for allowing water to pass on to the fields. The distributing channel C C.C being large cuts cannot be made in the banks of these channels, but numerous sluices E.E.E are to be provided for Wa ^ er ^ rom c hannels C.C.C to pass into the water-courses The nett area available for irrigation of the small bloeks A. A A. will be 25 hectares = 62*5 acres and the gross area will be or 83-5 acres' The whole proposed system is based on the desire to provide a system of channels capable of being navigated by boats and barges in order to make the cost of carriage of produce as small as possible. The main channel A. will therefore have a sectional area, as proposed at present, of 360 square metres = 3,874 square feet as a minimum. In the type section shown on the accompany ing diagram the section of A. is given a water-way of rather more than this, 4,001 square feet. It is assumed that the side slopes of the channel in digging will be A berm should be left between the digging and the banks. Ihe normal depth of water in channel A. will be 3'2 metres, of which about 2 metres may be taken as above ground and 1*2 metres below natural surface. These figures correspond to 10'5 feet, 6 5 feet and I’O feet respectively, the di mension given on the accompanying diagram to channel A. Taking a chan nel of type section as shown on the accompanying diagram for A. of 360 feet bed width and 10’5 feet of water, the banks would be about 50 feet wide at top with slopes of f, and this would be the normal size of the banks which would be made about 2 -J feet above the water surface. The bed of the main channel A. would be level throughout from its off- take m the river and should the slope of the country necessitate it, the slope will be taken up by navigating locks suitably placed. m ! 16 su PP^ n ? channels B B. will be of considerably smaller capacity than A. Ihe areas of the channels B B will be, as at present proposed, 32 square metres or 3 tl square feet. The normal section may be as shown on the accom panying diagram, the surface of the water in B.B. being somewhat lower than that m A. As designed in the accompanying diagram, the channels B.B hive a water way of 337 square feet with a depth of water of 8 feet and banks 6 feet wide at top and 1-0 foot above the water surface. As before in the case of A side s opes m digging are taken as f and here the banks may be given slopes of l- 1 - tO JL* ^ The irrigating channels C.C.O may have the same capacity as B.B. and are so designed on the accompanying diagram. n water surface in the supplying and irrigating channels B.B. and Cj.O O.......would be slightly lower than that in A. The beds of these channels would also be level. The water-courses, parallel to C.C.O in the banks of which cuts can be made to supply water to the small blocks of land A.A.A may be small cnaniieis. c o a . r ® s h own on the accompanying diagram as having a depth of water of 3 feet, with bed width 2 - 0 ’. The beds of these water-courses will also be level throughout. . Between 0.0.0 and the water-courses D.D.D are left spaces from which earth can be obtained for the banks of 0.0.0 and DJD.E... . This ground may be ultimately used for cultivation. It must be understood that the cross-sections of the various channels are type sections to be modined according to the slope of the ground for which levels are Jacking at present. I am not clear, why the channels B.B. and C.C.C are made so large. It would not, on account of the slirces E.E. be possible to pass boats into B.B. andstill less into C.C.C and the capacities of these channels seem to be ah nor mally large for the supply of water required. Some reason for this seems to be required. Taking the normal type sections of the channels as shown on the accom panying diagram, the areas occupied by channels and banks within the large block would come to 810 acres as against a gross allowance of 1,069 acres (433 hectares) allowed by Mr. Van Roggen as the difference between the large block gross and nett area mentioned above. The balance is available for roads, villages, etc. As regards execution of the work, it is proposed to use machinery in the form of dredgers or steam navvies as far as possible. Labor is scarce and of inferior quality. Time is an essential factor in the case. W. R/. MORTON, Major, R.E.

Practi cally no rain falls in May, little in April and October, and more from June to September inclusive. The fluctuations are great. In 1900 the total rainfall for the year was 15 32 inches, while in 1901 it was 3'7fi inches. In Januarv it varied from P41 as maximum in 1897 to 0-29 in 1903, and other months show* similar fluctuations. The Assistant Resident, Bushire, says rainfall at Ahwaz and on Karun river likely to be less than at Bushire. There is no record of rainfall on the Karun river.River Gargar at Shelalieli shows a rise of 2-1 feet since 12 noon yesterday to 8 a. M. this morning and a rise of 1*4 since 8 p. m. last night. Water very muddy, yellowish. Took a sample of the water at 8 feet below surface in the evening. Did some survey work near Shelalieh landing-place with box sextant. Took me till 4 p. m., when I left for Shuster by road, reahed it just as it was getting dark and put up with Mr. Alexander, Lynch’s agent, in Lynch’s house in the heart of the town, a well-known evil-smelling place wuth main drains in the streets. 14th March 1905 .—Went to Shelalieh and took some angles from riverbanks. Also measured the width of the river in two places and made some rough sketches of its windings. To show the course of the river with any accuracy would be troublesome and take time especially near Shuster, as there are two branches, some canals, watercourses and close country, with “ nebek ” and polin trees. The high banks along the river do not allow one to approach near the river, as these banks are cut by numerous ravines running back far in many places, into the high ground overlooking the river. Could survey along the Shelalieh road and cut in the high bank in places and thence the river below. About one mile clear of the town of Shuster a road diverges to Bandikir at about 30° wmst. Shuster to Shelalieh said to be about 7 miles by road. River can be navigated down stream on a raft, below the mills. There are several villages ^near Shuster and between it and Shelalieh on the right bank of the River Gargar and between it and the Shateit—few of which are shown on Plant’s map.° These and the high knolls would make good triangulation points. Found sample of water taken on 12 th held two teaspoonfuls of yellow sandy deposit in about a pint of water. (This is rough and results of all experi ments made can be worked out as accurately as required later on.) River Gargar has now risen fully 3 feet beyond its previous rise, which makes a total rise of about o feet since midday on 12 th. Now shows si^ns of falling. Kenny of “ Shushan ” says it is the highest river he has seen. 15ih March 1905 .—Went out with Alexander to see old dam at head of Ab-i-Gargar, mills and broken bridge over Ab-i-Shateit. The mills are very interesting, said to be 100, working or available for work. Water held up by a massive dam about 30 feet wide at top with a long slope on downstream side of about J. This is in good repair, but protected by a mound of earth thrown into the river upstream as though there had been some fear of its giving way. Some measurements of this dam might be taken with some difficulty. Water passes through two main passages cut in the rock right and left of the dam and issues below into the river with great fall. The mills have wooden wheels of primitive type working large stones of over 3 feet diameter and 6 ' thick. Of course an enormous amount of power is wasted. To find out the power available for permanent perennial working of machinery of a better type would necessitate measurements and observations in the hot leather when the river is at its lowest but still flows. Wilson, Lorimer and Tod arrived in forenoon from Dizful overland. Had to stay here the rest of the day waiting for their mules which delayed in crossing the Ab-i-Shateit. 16th March i90o.—Wilson’s party went to Shelalieh early in the morning ; went with them. My coolies from Ahwaz refused to do any more work here as they say pay is not sufficient and there is danger from roving Arabs. As I can get other men locally let them go with Ali (Lynch’s man). Sheikh’s “ gholam ” (armed man) also dissatisfied and, as he has hurt his foot, went off too. After seeing steamer “ Shushan ” leavefor Ahwaz about 10-30 a.m. went by myself to take some angles with box sextant at various villages. Spent day out3 found people most friendly and obliging. There is a considerable amoun o? irrigation done here by 3 or 4 main watercourses, taking off I suppose from the main canal, the head of which is just above the broken bridge over th Ab-i-Shateit. This canal and its watercourses run well when uvei iski 0 » &gt; and I had considerable difficulty in crossing the mam watercourses on • The country is intersected also by numerous small watercourses The who e reminds one of the inundation canal system near Multan, hut the banks o watercourses here are not so high as near Multan, but the watercourses are q as tortuous. The maiu water-courses are 8 -10 wide, and run with 3-4 feet ot water as a maximum. Surplus water can, when necessary, he sent off into the river by cuts (and underground passages in places). The coun ry jus no is in many places difficult to ride across owing to the watercourses and the abundance of water which makes the ground more a rlce ' f ^ than a wheat-field. Had to make several detours to reach villages, the wheatisdoingvery well and is about a foot high, backward as compared with wheat in India at this time of year. Hear Shuster beans are much grown and a little taramira, opium and dhal. I heard yesterday irom Lonmer at Dizful is the best irrigated country here with perennially flowing cm . Alexander says that the wheat grown near Shuster is not considered tit export and the grain is only used locally. 17th March iW.—Stayed at Shuster and did some calculations^ of trian- eulation. Kenny sent me a bottle of Gargar water taken on 1 . 5 th evening hetore he left Shelalieh. It takes a long time to evolve results with the small rude appliances I have. In evening with Alexander along main canal which off takes above broken bridge, i.e., iust below where Ab-i-Shateit diverges from Gargar m the main Karun river.* The canal is flowing well, though water m it has gone down now a good deal. About f mile from the bead of the canal is a waste weir which Alexander says has now been rebuilt for the third time, having been damaged, partially or wholly, twice. This consists of a wall with rectangular openings—no regulation allowing the water above a certain height iust to flow through the openings and then over the top. Ihe water over the waste weir flows by a side channel down into the Ab-i-Gargar, about one mile further down Further on down the canal there is apparently another waste weir of some kind as there is another (small) channel which carries water down into the Gargar. A great deal of water must be lost m this way. IHh March 1905.—look one of Lynch’s men and some (4) Persian coolies with me to observe some angles at various villages. Some I took with a theodolite ns I found with box sextant results not altogether_ satisfactory especially tor Ion 0, shots which are unavoidable without putting up numerous artificial stations. Got in late and found Major Arbuthnot (on duty in connection with purchase of mules) arrived from Ispahan, en route $oy Dizful. Has a good deal of information for Intelligence Branch route book of Ispahan-Shuster road and a m ap reduced from survey made by Taylor formerly in Lynch’s employ. He finds the road in places incorrectly shown. Alexander gives me following information about relation between owners and cultivators. A owner of land, either cultivates the land direct through cultivators C D E,’ etc., or sublets the land to B (who deals with the cultivators), for a fixed rent the amount of which, per acre, varies in different places. 0 D E, etc., cultivate small portions of the land (X) for sole use of B (or A) who takes all the produce of such portions. A (or B) sometimes supplies the seed required to C D E, etc., and the latter provide cattle, implements and labor. In addition to the produce of the small plots (X) mentioned above, B (or A) gets so much from CDE, etc., per head of cattle, mules or donkeys used byG D E, etc. These rates vary. The above applies to the Shuster district In Ispahan A (or 13) takes part of the produce of the laud, such part of the produce being fixed by agreement and variable. Alexander says lie may be able to get me the rates paid per head of cattle mules and donkeys later on. Major Arbuthnot went to his camp last night about J mile off from Lynch’s house and had to return for safety after some time owing to heavy firino' mung on between two quarters (mahallas) of the town which are at feud with one another. Several of the houses here—Lynch’s among others—have rough breast works (sangars) of stones placed on the roof parapets as a protection against chance shots on such occasions. There has been firing going on nearly every night since I came here. The nett results are small. Last night one man, it is said, had his leg shot through I thought it was in connection with the Moharram, but Alexander says it goes on more or h s&amp; alvay s, but last night was the worst he had heard for some vears. Major Arbuthnot was fortunate to escape as he says the bullets were whistling round his tent. The bazaar has been closed and no work done for some days past owing to the Moharram, which was over on the 17th, but the bazaar remained closed yesterday and is closed again today owing to the disturbances. Spent part of the day in calculating some of my triangles. Found I was one angle short, overlooked, and must make another excursion to one station. Also have to take angles from more distant villages which border more nearly on the Ab-i-Shateit. My triangulation does not pretend to rigid accuracy, but enough to form a basis for filling in details if the native surveyor comes up. J Result of specimen of surface water of Gargar taken on 12th gives nils of tablespoonful in pint of water. A pint equals 160 teaspoonfuls, so that pro portion is 208 of volume of water and for that recorded on 14th March as taken on 12th at 8 feet depth fcth °f volume of water. These are excep tional results with river high and only apply to periods of rise. It is said that the Liz river holds the most silt deposit in solution and the Ab-i-Sbateifc the least of the three rivers. The deposit found in the Gargar at Shelalieh must be the result largely of stuff washed down into it below Shuster if there is much difference between the soluble deposits in the Ab-i-Shateit and the Gaidar as the two diverge from the one main Karun above Shuster. The Liz of course is a sepaiate liver altogether. The deposit found in the specimen of water taken on the 12th at the surface is very much darker (in fact almost black) than that found at the lower depth at the same time. 20th March 1005.—Writing out my diary for Foreign Office, and other letters. Major Arbuthnot says General Schindler is the man most likely to give any information about crops, revenue, etc., not elsewhere available. Propose to complete triangulation and fixing points tomorrow—call on the Persian Customs Officer, an advanced individual, next day with view to seeinc if any information is available about land revenue which is collected by Customs department and the day after, if arrangements can be made in time, to o&gt; 0 into Bakhtiari land, as fa,i as Ivayat 1 cak and back by Karim Bivcr to Sinister, If native surveyor has done up to Wais on river survey, I left him doin^, he could come up here and do details and I could, on my return here, survey down to Bandikir along one of the roads and fix villages cn route from which survevor could put in river. There are two routes to Bandikir, one goes by Arab Hassan, said to be a large village. This route goes more or less along the Shateit left bank and probably follows the telegraph line fairly closely. The other runs nearer the Gargar. Larimer has been asked to get the Ahwaz Sheikh to send me a not tier ghoiam (armed man) and find out what the surveyor is doin^ and has done. &amp; J * 4 * Mail received on 18th by special messenger, brought letter No. 799-E.A. of 23rd February 1903 regarding pay and travelling allowances.

With reference to your No. 180 -E A., dated 14 th January 1905 , and in continuation of my previous letters ou the same subject, 1 have the honor to send herewith an extract of my diary for period ending 28 th March 1905 . Extract from diary of Major Morton on special duty. 21 st March Major Arbuthnot left for Dizful. Asked him to give letter to Arful Salar, Bakhtiari chief, to send me a Bakhtiari guide. Bain fell in morning. Went out to take same angles and heavy rain came on again, stopping work. Took Lynob’s sole man, who speaks Arabic, and he unfortunately dislocated his ankle, his mule falling on slippery ground. His loss is felt, as he has been of great service to me in knowing the country here and names of villages. Colonel Baylward, B.A., and Mr. Wooshman arrived from Dizful, missing Major Arbuthnot on the way. Colonel Baylward speaks well of the proposal which I believe has been previously made of diverting the waters of the Khoshal river into the Diz, and says it is, he believes, quite feasible. He thinks that the river Khoshal is not quite correctly shown on the small map in Curzon’s Persia, and that it does not ultimately turn westward as shown there. In. one place it is not very far from the Diz. The survey of this part of the country might he profitable. 22 nd March 1905 .—Bain fell again in morning. Went with Colonel Baylward and Alexander to mills and mosques on river bank. Went on after wards by myself to another mosque from which, I think, angles can be taken to points in Shuster. In the evening went to visit the head of Persian Customs here to ask for information about revenue and land tenure. He has not much information, but told me what are the usual rates paid by cultivators to land-owners as part of their “ rent ”. These he says vary from 17 to 23 krans (kran=about 4 annas) per head of cattle and donkeys or other animals used in tilling soil. He told me a lot of weird stories about what the people here say I am doing— looking for gold, my binoculars and instruments being able to see into the ground and flags put up show probable sites of gold—and a lot more rubbish of that kind, most of which I expect he invented for the occasion. He says, on the principle of “fardah inshallah M I suppose, he may be able to give some more information about what I want to arrive at, after consulting some friends of his and his son who has a better knowledge than he about land ques tion. 23 rd March 1905 .—Colonel Baylward and Mr. Wooshman left for Dizful. I went out surveying and got into one of the larger water-courses ; there being more water in it than I expected, got a ducking up to my thighs, having to swim, no great distance of course. Went to the village of Kenapis where I got the people to let me use a room in one of the houses, and had a fire lit and dried my clothes as far as I could. People very friendly and obliging. They do not in the least bit object to one’s going on to the roofs of houses to observe from. There are no serais in most of the villages here, in fact the only one I have seen is at Shelalieh and that I believe was built by some private benefactor. In the afternoon the head of Persian Customs called with two of the Mahomedan community, the latter asked for information as to cost of initial outlay, power and working costs of steam and hand pumps for irrigating purposes. I told them I had no information, the only place where as far as I know pumps are used for irrigating purposes is Egypt, but I said that if they would write down, shortly, what they wanted I would make enquiries with&gt;&gt; pleasure. From the three I obtained some information supplementing what Alexander told me (recorded diary for 18th March) and I shall write out the whole information and get the Persian Customs officer to look through it. 24th March .ZP05.—Duffadar surveyor arrived yesterday morning from Bandikir up to which place he has surveyed the river Karun from Ahwaz on a large scale 4' to 1 mile. I was going with him this morning to show him what to do near Shuster but heavy rain came on, and had to explain without going over the ground. In the afternoon cleared up and I went with Alexander to two mosques near Shuster from which I took several angles with box sextant to point near Shuster. I have been waiting for. Bakhtiari guide who should have been here by this time. Completed my silt experiments. One sample of river Karun water was taken late last evening as river had risen somewhat with late rains. Found it difficult to get the bottle, used for obtaining the water, to sink owing to a strong current, and a heavier weight than that at present available is required. Ordered a leaden weight which can be made in Shuster. Received letter from Van Roggen yesterday asking for his theodolite, got a box made in the bazaar and sent it of. Alexander and I went over the bazaar in the evening. There is a good deal of copper-ware made, chiefly cooking pots, and there are several blacksmiths, who make stirrup irons as used locally and the iron part of spades which somewhat resemble those used by Afghans, having pointed ends. The stirrup irons are of soft iron blued by being heated and immersion in water and then ornamented, by special workers, with pure brass wire beaten in—a process worth watching. There is a fairly large bazaar for sale chiefly of cheap cotton goods. Shuster dhurries are only made to order. It is said that they wear better than Indian dhurries and are not more expensive. One man we saw was mending china cups with wire fixed in boles bored in the China as is usually done at home. A simple thing like a hinge cannot be made. 25th March 1905 .—Took discharge of main canal in three places in the morning with Alexander, and in the afternoon went round part of the canal system. The discharge of the main canal which takes off from the Shateit just below the bifurcation of Karun into the Shateit and Gargar was found to be 970 cusecs. The velocity at the head of the canal is very great, sufficient to move small boulders, a great quantity of which are now to be found in the bed of the canal for a distance of about l a mile down. Of these 970 cusecs about frds go to escape into the Gargar, and the actual quantity of water going down the canal for irrigation purposes was found to be 333 cusecs. At a point about 1J miles from its head, the canal splits into four water-courses which meander in different directions over the country. Above this point one water-course takes off about miles from the bead of the canal. It is probable the canal for irriga tion purposes does not run much more water than was observed to-day. The water-courses were running very lull, and if any more water were sent down then it would go to escape back into the river, there being at least^ one place where provision has been made for passing surplus water into the river. The water-courses are fairly large—from 8—18 feet wide—with surface velocities of from 2^ to 2 feet a second. The supply in the main canal measured to-day was found to be distributed as follows:— r gi rsl ■ c,/t The depths vary from 4 to 5 feet. The flow irrigation commences about 2} miles from the head of the canal, above which point the ground is high, and if any irrigation is done it is by lift. Trom the point where flow irrigation com mences the ground falls steeply towards the Shateit river and ^ less so in the direction ofBandikir. I do not know at present how far irrigation extends in the latter (southerly) direction. There are numerous abandoned water courses, some of which have high banks which point to silt clearances. Trom the main water-courses numerous small water courses off-take. Anything in the shape of masonry works it is rare to find. The main canal is not controlled at its head. The head of the escape placed about ^ mile from head of the canal is of masonry as also is another escape head, the channel of which is used to a small extent for lift irrigation. Tour small foot-bridges over as many water courses were found and the remains of one bridge over the main canal between water-course No. 1 and the point of separation of water-courses Nos. 2 5. There is a masonry aqueduct on the main canal about 1 p^le from the head of the canal which merely serves to block the channel, as it is not now ^ used for passing water from one bank to the other, as must have been the case in former days when the bund in the Shateit was in working order. Bakhtiari guide arrived. D&amp;k arrived from Ahwaz by the special messenger sent in with letters on 21st. MacDouall writes that M. Darcher (already mentioned, diary 5th Feb ruary) “ seems to think that Van Roggen exaggerated the probable crop and did not fully appreciate the diflSculty of arranging to take up lands belonging to tribal cultivation as all lands in Arab districts do, whether actually cultivat ed this year or not. I believe it would be a very difficult question to arrange this matter. These semi-nomadic Arabs would resent any one else cultivating land they have formerly cultivated and yet might not be prepared to pay for irrigation of them. The Sheikh (/.&lt;?., the Mohammerah Sheikh) might arrange this, no one else.*’ In regard to questions of land tenure and the relations between cultivators and owners of land which I referred to Mr. MacDouall, he writes that he will make enquiries. He says that the Sheikh of Mohammerah has not said anything to him about Yan Roggen’s scheme (i.e., since our interview on the 3rd February). 26th March 1905 .—Left Shushter 9 a.m. for Tholl Hayat which I wish to ascend to take angles from it, if possible. The road is the Shuster-Ispahan road, a well-known one and previously described. Reached camp at about 4 p.m., having gone as I calculated about 16 miles. Camp at as near the foot of Tholl Hayat peak as possible. A Bakhtiari encampment near water and excellent pasturage. 27th March Left camp about 7-30 a.m. and reached top of Tholl Hayat in 1-J hours, an ascent steep in places. The barometer readings make the top of the peak 820 feet above camp and 1,110 feet above Shuster; reading of barometer at top of peak 1,420 feet. Took several angles at top and I think fixed position of this peak accurately enough. Descending in one hour much the same way as ascending. Barometer readings after descent make camp 880 feet below top of peak, the top of which is sufficiently near for practical purposes about 1,450 above sea. 28th March 1905 .—Pedometers supplied by Survey Department seemed to read accurately enough yesterday, at any rate it worked. To-day and yesterday evening when I went out for a short distance it refused to move. Moved camp about 5 miles along road (so called) to Ispahan and measured alignment for determining position relative to Tholl Hayat peak of another peak on the hill. Spent a good deal of time wandering about looking for my camp, as my Bakh tiari guide went off with the mules instead of staying with me. Only saw two villages. Water is very scarce here or rather water fit for drinking. The Ispahan road crosses a large river called the Akbeh river, but the water of this is brackish and quite unfit for drinking. There is excellent pasturage at present, and at times some of what are now quite small rivulets would no doubt have good water and plenty of it. Numerous herds of goats and sheep seen, few cattle and horses, some donkeys and mules. Wheat is grown here and there, but is very backward and it does not appear likely that it will produce grain. Wrote out diary for Foreign Office to send in by messenger tomorrow. Camp; The 28th March 1905. W. R. MORTON, Major, B.E. 3 G. C. Press, Simla—No. C 99 P. D.— 29 - 4 - 05 .— 61 —E. A.

A., dated 14th January 1905, and in continuation of my previous letters on the same subject, I have the honour to forward herewith extract from my diary for period ending 11th April 1905. Extract from Diary of Major Morton on Special Duty. 29th March 1905. —Continued survey. 30th March 1905. —Continued survey along valley. Ground much broken by hillocks and ravines, latter running into river called here Akheli river, which was generally about east and west. 31st March 1905. —Completed the survey I commenced on 28th to fix position of a second peak on first range of Bakhtiari hills with respect to the conspicuous Tholl Bayat. Ground passed over very much broken and difficult. A great deal of time spent in getting from place to place owing to the hilly nature of the ground. Wheat and barley grown in many places and excellent grazing. Many flocks of sheep and goats seen, few cattle and horses. One of my coolies got very badly bitten by a dog belonging to one of the “ dervishins ” or tent-dwellers (nomads). It is said these latter leave the plains or lower hills for the higher ranges in about three weeks’ time. The wheat and other crops grown here belong to the permanently-settled villagers. Warm weather commencing; fine with occasional light clouds and a few drops of rain. Returned to camp late and nearly missed my way : fortunately knew general direction of camp. One cooly had my binoculars and came in a short distance behind me with a story that he was attacked by two or three men who wanted the glasses, but he managed to beat them off without any damage to himsel f. Bakhtiari guide, who remained in camp in the afternoon, not appreciating a second dose of hill climbing, came out and fired off his gun aimlessly. He is a very bad shot. 1st April 1905. —Moved camp a short distance across valley to nearest point, where water is obtainable, to foot of peak I want to ascend and position of which fixed in relation to Tholl Hayat. Bakhtiari guide said that this peak cannot be climbed. Camped near a Bakhtiari village close to small stream of good water. Water in streams coming from north side of valley is all more or less saline and unfit to drink. That from streams from south side of valley good. Villagers say it is quite easy to climb peak and can ride up most of the way. As usual estimates of distance vary considerably. 2nd April 1905. —Left camp 7 a.m. riding. A fine morning with a few clouds. Only got about three-fourths of the way when a sudden storm—light ning and thunder—came on. When near the top rain began falling slightly at first and then in torrents and had to return in a deluge. Hill streams soon swol len. The stream near camp and between it and the village waist-deep and muddy yellow—the sort of water one sees in the Gar gar after rain. Bain continued till nightfall. 3rd April 1905. —Line morning, and it was possible to get things and tents dry. Left camp about half-past three in the afternoon ior re-ascent of peak. Walked most of the way to top, taking a guide from the village, who showed us a better way than that we went yesterday, and we got up with no difficulty in about 1J hours. View obscured by haze. Pound barometer record ed 600 feet at camp and 1,400 at highest point reached. Shuster dimly visible, also Band-i-kir, but no villages in the Gargar plain. The formation of the hills is peculiar, a series of glacis slopes, with a slope of about one-eigth, in rock, each terminating on the north side in a nearly perpendicular wall 50 feet high 1 [C98ED]or so. On the south or side of the Gargar (Shuster) plain the face of the hills is almost perpendicular. The glacis slopes are cut through by numerous deep candns or deep rifts down which streams flow after rain. In places even high up the hills there is grazing, and sheep and goats are met. Returned to camp just as it was getting dark. The stream near camp has resumed its normal dry weather condition. 4th April 1905 .—Moved camp to Bakhtiari village of Batwan, about 32 to 13 miles distant north-westward. The river flowing in the main valley and already mentioned as being called the Akheli river is no doubt the river called the Shur-i-Labhari, shown on map made by Mr. Lynch to illustrate his paper across Luristan to Ispahan (Royal Geographical Society’s Proceedings, Volume XII, page 533, et seq.).. The river had gone down and was fordable. Its waters had left a large deposit of mud on the banks through which one had to struggle. This river is, of course, quite impassable when swollen by rain fall, lor the rest the route to Batwan village lies along the valley; the ground after about a fourth of the distance has been traversed is only slightly undulating. Xot a village to be seen. Batwan lies on the right bank of a wide shallow stream, called here, for want of a better name, the Batwan river. The village is on the north side of the main valley under the hills, which yield limestone in large quantities, from which lime called &lt; ‘jatch ,, is made. The limestone is generally carried to Shuster to be burnt, but has been made at Batwan. It is a poor lime and only fit for use in plaster. A very good lime is also sometimes prepared at Batwan from small boulders found in the bed of the Batwan river and also at Shuster in the Karun river bed. It is said that the Gar^ar dam at Shuster, a very solid piece of masonry, what there is left oMt, was built with boulder lime and, if so, nothing better for building purposes could be desired. The masonry in the dam is so hard that it would defy the best made pick. The boulders used are plentiful at Batwan, but my informant states that the particular kind of boulder to be used has to be selected, other kinds being rejected. The Batwan river at present is about 30 yards broad at its water surface and from to 2 feet deep. In flood it is quite 150 yards broad and 1 to 5 feet deep. 5th April 1505.—Left camp about 7 a.m. and crossed the Batwan river and passed through the village of same name. There is here a limited quantity of excellent wheat and barley. Some of the crop is very backward, however, and the grain not yet formed. No irrigation from river is possible, as the river even in flood does not cover the adjacent ground. About three-fourths of a mile below the village the main stream is joined by a small tributary, and the way my guide took me necessitated crossing both streams. The water followed is one that goes to Shuster over very difficult hilly ground, sometimes along the sloping face of rocky ground, making progress slow. This is not the best way of reaching Akheli, the village I was going to, and had I known it at the time of starting should have made my guide go, as the camp went, along the valley, a very easy route. After climbing a considerable height the route follows a narrow plateau for about 2 miles, and here the road to Shuster diverges approximately westward, while the hill path to Akheli, diverging north-west, descends precipi tously to the plain again. After passing a small village on the way we reached the Batwan river again and found it troublesome to cross, the water being well over one’s knees riding, and the current coming over a dam in the river caused a strong current just as much as a mule or small pony could stem. What exactly is the use of the aforesaid dam I could not discover. The banks of tbe river are far too high to admit of its making any irrigation from the river possi ble. Unfortunately, after reaching Akheli village, about half mile further on, I was for the rest of the day and well into the evening (after a long ride only reaching Akheli 2-30 p. m ) engaged in looking for my camp. Fearing some acci dent I rode about three fourths of the way to Batwan, the way the camp had come, before I could find any one who could give definite new s that the mules had passed by on their way to Akheli. Returning I found camp pitched out of sight of the village and must have missed them on my way looking for them. The result was that as I wanted to get back to Shuster early I could not find 23 time to discover the reason for the dam, evidently built for some purpose, the water in the river having a fall of some 4 feet difference in level of water surface above and below the dam. On my way to Batwan in the afternoon I crossed a small channel about 3 feet wide and running feet deep, which is apparently a small irrigation channel fed from some hill stream. Ihe wide plain near Akheli in the valley of the Karun river, after it debouches from the defiles of the higher ranges of the Bakhtiari mountains, is very fertile. The wheat and barley is excellent. It is said that fruit, figs, grapes, and the like are grown here, but I did not see any fruit trees. 6th April 7^5.—Left Akheli early, crossed what is evidently the Akheli or Slmr-i-Labhari river after it has been joined by the Batwan river. An easy crossing at a ford when river is low as it has become to day. The plain is soon left and a path in the side of the gorge, through which the Karun has forced its way, brings one to the Shuster plain. The distance from Akheli to Shuster is probably about 8-10 miles. In the afternoon received visit from Persian Customs officer and some others of the Mohammedan community. The former went through notes 1 had written of what he told me in regard to revenue and the relations between cultivators and landowners. At present the whole revenue paid to the Persian Govern ment for the tract of land known as the Mian-al (the land lying between the Ah-i-Shateit and the Gargar and commencing at Shuster and ending at Band-i-kir) is in cash 14.000 krans or the equivalent of 3,500 rupees. The area of this tract can only be very roughly estimated as about 180 square miles, 30 miles from north to south and 6 miles average from east to west. This represents 115,000 acres. In kind the Government receives as an additional payment 102 “ kharwars*’ of barley and wheat mixed and 157 “ kharwars ” of straw. A “ kharwar,’* originally meaning in Persian a donkey’s load, is the equivalent of f&gt; cwt. nearly. The “ kliarwari ” represents, in cash, in ordinary years, about 1,500 rupees (6,000 krans), taking value of cwt. of wheat and barley as Rs. 2 (8 krans) and of cwt. of straw 4 annas (1 kran). The only known area of land measurement is a very indefinite one. It is known as a “ khesh ” (Persian for yoke, probably a team of oxen). It is some times taken to measure 200 “ zars ” square, a “ zar ” being about 40 inches. This makes the “ khesh ” (or “plough’* of land) about 10 English acres. The plough is however defined to be an area of land on which 200 Shuster mons (in case of Shuster district) of wheat and barley are sown. I was informed in Shuster that the produce of a “ plough ” is as a maximum 10 times the amount of seed sown. This would make the produce of a “ plough ” 2,000 Shuster mons of wheat and barley. This is the equivalent of 276 cwt. or 202 Indian maunds, giving 20 maunds per acre, an amount considerably above what Indian experience shows to he the produce of an acre of wheat and barley on good land. Got my dak and heard from Lorimer that Mr. Van Roggen intends leaving Ahwaz by next steamer. 7th April 1905 —Returned visits to Persian Customs officer and the son of the Mujtahid. Left Shuster at 3 p.m. and reached Arab Hussan, a fairly large village on the right bank of the Ab-i-Shateit, some 16 miles south of Shuster. Irrigation from the canal system, mentioned in diary for 25th March, ends about 2 miles below Shelalieh, which is six to seven miles south of Shuster, and cultivation then becomes scanty. 8th April 1905 .—Leaving Arab Hussan at 5-30 A. M., reached Band-i-kir at jog-trot at 8-45 a.m., making distance about 12 miles. Had to wait for mules to come up ; arrived at 9-45. Took them about two hours to unload, swim the Gargar, the loads crossing in a boat. I left Band-i-kir at 11-10, and reached Weiss (after halting at Kotal Nedafar Kebir (large) for 1 hour and 10 minutes) at 3-20. Make distance Band-i-kir to Weiss 11 to 12 miles. Leaving Weiss 4-30, reached Ahvvaz about 7-45, making distance Weiss to Ahwaz 14 to 15 miles, and from Shuster to Ahwaz 53 to 55 miles. Mules arrived Bander Nasiri about 9-30 p.m. Hay very hot from about 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Met Lorimer’s clerk between Kotal Nedafar and Weiss en route to Dizful.9th April 1905. —T\ rote out and sent to Mr. Van Roggen a note in regard to supply of water in his scheme. He has given me figures in which he takes different amounts of water per acre (or hectare) for nearly every month of the year. The figures he gave me do not make it clear whether he includes or excludes supply in supplementary reservoirs. He takes his canals which, as before mentioned, are abnormally large as reservoirs, and in November he draws on the supply in the canals to the last drop. I asked him, among other •things, how he could do irrigation from canals nearly, and at the end of Novem ber, quite dry. I also asked him to give me what information he could about probable revenue to Government per acre (or hectare) and produce estimates for the main croos—wheat, barbey, cotton, indigo, sugarcane In regard to sugarcane Mr. Wilson, of Lynch Brothers, says he is not aware of any sugarcane being grown in Persia at present ; but Curzon’s Persia, Vol. II, page B47, says that the country round Ahwaz, irrigated years ago by water held up by the great dam, now in ruins, was famous for its rich plantations of sugarcane. It may reasonably be supposed, therefore, that an irrigation scheme at Ahwaz would now also be the means of producing this valuable commodity. b , * ajfo asked Mr. Van Roggen to express an opinion as to how the question ot the bheikh of Mohammerah’s practical ownership of the land near Ahwaz would he dealt with. I hope to get his reply before he leaves. I understood him to fix the end of April as the probable date of his departure. Wrote out notes from report by MacLean to Board of Trade on condition and prospects of trade in Persia, 1904, which gives much useful information about crops and their prices in the local markets. . MM dpril 1905 .—Wrote up my diary for Foreign Office to date. There is little more now to record. It may be possible to take another discharge of the river. I have sent for a theodolite; without one it would be hopeless to attempt taking a discharge. I also asked Mr. Van Roggen if he could spare me his again and await his reply. 1 expect however he will want to take it away with him. One rumour says he goes to Holland and not to Tehran, as he stated was his intention originally. Wilson gives prices of Dizful indigo as from 30 to 35 krans per Hizful mon for third quality, 45 krans for second quality, and 70 krans for best. These prices, reduced to rupees and Indian maunds, are— Rs. A. p. Best quality ... ... ... ... 84 8 0 per maund. Second „ ... ... ... 54 5 0 „ ^ % Third ,, ... ... ... ... 35 4 0 to 42 4 0 per maund. An ordinary rate for indigo in India is Es. 64 per maund. The indigo in Dizful, of which Wilson has samples, is made up into small nodules and not into cakes. Took sample of Karun water at Ahwaz yesterday. River is high, reading on Van Roggen gauge (lower) about 39 decimetres. 11th April 1905 .—Wrote out notes from Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Gave Captain of “ Blosse Lynch ” level for a gauge to be put up near steamer’s anchorage. Van poggen gave me some time ago an enamelled gau^e which he had to spare, hut it has not been possible to put up the gauge before Even now only part of the gauge can be put up owing to the high water; the rest must be put up as water falls. The piece which can be put up now will record water level till it falls tw ? o feet below present height. Van Roggen will. I suppose, arrange to send his two gauges when he leaves Ahwaz, and his man can easily also send the gauge now to be fixed if Wilson cannot conveniently arrange to do this. 12th April 1905.—River risen somewhat. Floating insects—chiefly dead bodies it is said show that snows are melting, as these insects only come down when this occurs. 4&gt; Completed notes from Persian Gulf Gazetteer. On page 9 the Gazetteer asks whether Hashimabad is the same as Shelalieh. The answer is “ no. ” Hashimabad is some two or three miles below the landing place near the village of Shelalieh and the latter, not Hashimabad, is the point where the steamer “ Shushan, ” owned by the Shah but run by Lynch’s, and all native craft anchor and unload for Shuster. On page 14 j, under head of Karun, the Gazetteer, giving Shateit as one of the branches of the Karun above Band-i-kir, says this branch is preferred as a means of navigation to the Ab-i-Gargar. In point of fact if any craft go up the Shateit it is but very seldom. The “ Shushan ” has been up the Shateit but not for some time past, and never in the course of a regular service. The point nearest Shuster which can conveniently be reached on the Shateit is much further from the town of Shuster than that which boats can reach on the Ab-i-Gargar. On page 9, the Gazetteer itself says boats prefer the Gargar to the Shateit. More information about the Jerrohi and Fellahieh is now available than that given in the Gazetteer, and chiefly based on Layard’s observations. Major Burton surveyed the Jerrahi from Bam Hormuz to Fellahieh. Map issued by Intelligence Branch, No. 3060-1 of 1901, Persia, Clause IV, No. 20. Under Shuster the Gazetteer does not mention the fact that “ Valerian’s ” bridge formerly, as it states, called the Band-i-Mizan and the Puli-Kaisar, is in a hopeless state of dilapidation, there being a wide gap, stated in Curzon’s Persia, Vol. II, page 3' 7 4, to be 70 yards wide, through which most of the Ab-i-Shateit passes, and this, it is hardly necessary to state, is quite beyond the hope of repair under present conditions of general neglect of public works in this part of Persia. It would be a tough and expensive job to repair the bridge and dam now. Even when Lord Curzon wrote in 1889 the bed of the Shateit at the gap in the bridge was scoured out to a depth of 20 feet, and 16 years more of constant contracted flow through the gap, with at times a racing current, has no doubt considerably increased this scour depth.

[This Document is the Property of His Britannic Majesty’s Government.] 1 PERSIA. CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne .— {Received April 24.) (No. 67.) My Lord, Tehran, March 24, 1905. ONE of the Belgian engineers sent out on behalf of the Persian Government to examine M. Van Roggen’s scheme for the Ahwaz dam having arrived here from the Karun a few days ago, I asked M. Nans if he had brought with him any news as to the doings of Major Morton, the expert sent there by the Government of India, from whom I had so far received no reports as to his mission. His Excellency said that he had heard that Major Morton had made a thorough study of the problem, and had impressed all those with whom he had come in contact with his ability and valuable knowledge of all irrigation questions. He appeared to have quite mastered this particular subject, and M. Naus thought from what he had heard that the opinion which he was likely to express on the Ahwaz dam scheme would be favourable to the views of the Persian Government. He believed, however, that it would cost a good deal more than the 200,000/. which the Ain-ed-Dowleh had asked us to advance for it, and that half a milhon was a more likely estimate, but he also thought that the necessary funds could be easily raised by a Syndicate in Europe, and that the European capital required might thus, if necessary, be found without a foreign Government loan. M. Naus went on to say that one serious difficulty in the way of the proposed i scheme lay in the possible, and indeed probable, opposition of the Sheikh of Moham- 1 merah, who would insist on his local interests being considered in connection with this question, and who, he added, had intimated pretty plainly that if they were disregarded he might give trouble, and perhaps even migrate with his whole tribe to the Turkish side of the Euphrates. This attitude on Sheikh Khazal’s part may, I think, prove an important card in our hands, should any attempt be made by the Grand Vizier to give effect to his Karun irrigation projects on lines not approved by the British or Indian Governments. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE.

I also draw attention to my remarks in my diary for 28th February as regards proposal to go with Mr. Wilson (Lynch’s Agent here) to Dizful Susa and Shuster. ^ I shall start on Saturday next (4th instant) and survey the river to Bandikir and then go on with Mr. Wilson. This trip will give me some idea of the country about here and be of use in my report on the Ahwaz irrigation scheme. I have pretty well done all that can he done at Ahwaz itself, until I have a surveyor to level the ground (see separate letter enclosed). This work belongs really to Mr. Van Roggen but he has taken no levels except a few along the river bank, and there is no prospect as far as I can see of his taking the level required over the ground to be dealt with in his scheme. It is impossible for Mr. Van Roggen or any one else to say how his scheme would adapt itself to the ground and I expect that a complete series of levels such as are run for an irrigation project in the Punjab and elsewhere would show him that he must modify his present proposals, if he is to bring the cost of his works within reasonable limits.— Information must he obtained as to the resources of the country near here in respect of building materials other than stone which is available. Lime is made at Shuster and tire source of supply of limestone is nearest to that town. Here also are available the only skilled masons the country near here can boast of. Up the Diz is a the only available source of ^supply of fuel wood. Some information on the resources of the country near Ahwaz can be obtained by the proposed journey and I think you will agree with me that the time spent on the journey should give useful results. 5. I shall endeavour to send you my weekly extract from diary as usual next week, but if circumstances do not permit of it you will please understand why I have not sent the diary as usual. 6. Mr. Van Roggen has not as yet returned the memorandum and plan referred to in the enclosed diary for 26th February, but I hope to send you the same or a copy of them with my next letter. The memorandum gives inform ation about the detail of Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme so far as he has made it out at present. 7. I do not think after this memorandum is dealt with there is any further necessity for troubling Mr. Van Roggen about his scheme, and I would suggest that the Government of India ask for a copy of the scheme when fully elaborated as Mr. Van Roggen proposes to elaborate it on his return to Tehran after the end of April or thereabouts. I can meanwhile— (a) take more discharges of the river; (b) level the country at one mile intervals if I can get a surveyor, and when my level comes up ; (c) collect as much information as possible on the resources of the immediate vicinity. 8. As regards making necessary enquiries about produce, the question will' involve the greatest difficulty I fear. Nothing in the shape of records exist and no one I have come across as yet has been able to give any reliable information on the amount of produce, which may be expected to come from, a given area. Curzon’s Persia does not give information on this point though 6021 f. n. 6^1 li-iin chapters XXVIII and XXIX, Volume II, there is a mass of useful information on the general outturn of the various crops grown Some statis- tics oTproduce is required and if as it appears these cannot be made from enauirv here or elsewhere in the vicinity, it wtll probably he necessary to fall back on the ample information available in the Punjab. There is no apparent reason to suppose that there is much, if any, difference between the crcfp producing capacities of the ground here, and that in many parts of Punjab. ... . • . • j 9 There is still one more point at least on which information is required in connection with the scheme for the Ahwaz irrigation and that is, what arrangements will be made for bringing in people to cultivate the land taken up for the scheme. At present the whole land is deserted except at the few scattered villages along the Karun. In certain seasons nomad tribes come down and plough and cultivate the land to a limited extent but some definite proposals and arrangements seem to be necessary in regard to what may be called colonising the land. It is easy to say, as is said here on enquiry being made, when the water is available people will flock in. I think that the Persian Government may with the approval of the Government of India be addressed on this subject. 10. I merely allude here to the question of the jurisdiction of the Sheikh of Mohammerah. This is a question which will enter into a consideration of the success of the proposed scheme but it is one I do not feel capable of dealing with and would request that some instructions may be given if necessary on the matter {vide diary for 19th February sent with letter, dated 22nd idem.) 11. I may mention here that having no clerk I do not keep copies of my letters to you and that in replying to them would request the favor of your sending me a copy of my letters should a reply require a reference to the contents of the original letter. [Confidential.) Extract from Diary of Major Morton on special duty. 23rd ’February 1205.—River has not shown any real signs of rising after rainfall recorded on 19th. Lower gauge read 13 5 (decimetres) on 20th and 15 3 on 21st. This is a rise of about 7 inches. (A decimetre is practically 4 inches.) The river is still rising slightly. Yan Roggen can give me at any time the results of his gauge readings and has been as ed to give a copy of his register from the date the gauges were erected to datv\ Mr. Yan Ro-gen came about 10 a.m , and brought my memorandum (sent to him on 20th) with his replies written on the blank half margin. He sketched, at the interview, on hack of one of the memorandum sheets the detailed arrangement for supplying water to one large block of land to he dealt with m a year. No levels of the ground to be irrigated have been taken. Yan Roggen says he is working short handed, (He has a young assistant, a Belgian, I think, and a draughtsman. One of his assistants left on arrival at Mohammerafi- ostensibly homesick.) 1 understand that his being short handed is his own fault as he has been given funds for getting up his scheme, the generally accepte amount being £3,000, out of which he takes his own fee and supplies hir assistants and instruments, etc. Until levels are run it is quite impossible for Yan Roggen or any one else to say how his scheme (an original one) could be adapted to the ground. He talks of making his main channel level bedded and I presume the side channels would also have their beds level and, if the ground does not permit of this, that navigating locks and falls would be required. Van Roggen lays great stress on navigation being kept up. He says that the lower Karun navigation and supply in low season must not be interfered with for three reasons: (1) in the interests of Lynch Brothers steamers, (2) tha supply of water in Bahmeshir channel (connects the Karun direct with the. Persian Gulf from a point some two miles above Mohammerah) be not redupedin volume, (3) because it is essential to keep up a means of navigation at all seasons in order to reduce the cost of transporting the produce of lands to be irrigated by the Akwaz scheme to a minimum. In respect of (3) boats and barges are to navigate Van Roggen’s main channels and carrv produce straight down to Mohammerah without any break of bulk caused* by an alternative railway. He talks of erecting at Mohammerah steam-worked grain elevators, and I am not quite sure that he does not also contemplate starting a special line of steamers.^ In talking of making navigating channels of his main canals Van Roggen evidently has the evil smelling “ groachts ” of Amsterdam, the Hague and of other towns of his native Holland in his mind. 'Van Roggen insists very stongly on using machinery for excavating his channels. “ I must have straight lines ” is one of the expressions he used. He has no faith either in the quantity or the quality of the local labor and, in respect of the latter at any rate, I should say he is quite right. The people here have not done any work like that required in heavy excavations for years (centuries perhaps) and would he, therefore, for a long time quite unable to deal with large quantities of earthwork, for example. On the other hand, the purchase of machinery for the work will involve a large initial outlay and require specially trained and probably very expensive labor. There is a danger that, in any but the most capable hands of management, an excess outlay on such machinery will be incurred, and when obtained the 'machinery will break down. I should doubt that any European will be able to work in this climate from June to September. I understand also that Van Roggen contemplates introducing agricultural machinery for working the land with plough threshing machines and the like. He laid stress, in the interview, on following the American practice in such respects. 24th February 1905. —After fixing the flags required for recording passage of floats, last night commenced discharge of river Karun below the rapids (opposite village of Yemeniyah) with help of duffadar surveyor and two of Lorimer’s sowars, at about 8-30 a.m. The surveyor took the times with my stop watch and sowars noted the times of passing of floats. A theodolite borrowed from Van Roggen (a first class German instrument never used before. I recommend to notice of English makers the excellent method of bousing the instrument in its box for facility of removal and replacing) was used for taking angles from the left bank to a known base, of the passing of the floats over the centre line. Completing this about 11-30, I took soundings from a boat while surveyor measured angles to places of soundings with a plane table. I did not like to let him use the theodolite (with which, moreover, he has no acquaintance) and had no one I could trust to take and record soundings and give the signal when taken. Owing to not being able to get the boat moved suitably fewer depths were sounded than I required for accurate work, and I had two tries, missing a depth of 16 feet at the first try. Finished about 3-45 p.m. 25th February 1505.—Spent most of the day in working out discharge of river taken yesterday. Owing to unlucky mistake I calculated the distance of float passages from bank all wrong and had to do them again, only discover ing my mistake when I had nearly finished all calculations. We had intended again doing the rapids, this time in a bigger boat and taking, with help of Kenny of the Shushan, soundings in the pools of rapids but Kenny was ill and could not come, and without him we could not have taken the soundings and merely shooting the rapids, though from previous experience giving a certain amount of excitement, would have been a waste of time. Colonel Bailward, R.A., and Mr. Wooshsham, naturalist, arrived late last night from Bushire overland. They took a hearing of Ahwaz and marched on it for, I believe, some 90 miles and finally reached the Ahwaz hills without having seen them, about 8 p.m., and with difficulty found the town. It is about 50 odd miles since they left the Jarrahi river along the line of march. The absence of any intermediate places where information cf the required direction could be obtained, gives some idea of the deserted state of this country. Fortunately there is no jungle like that on the Rechua l)oab for example. They stay here a few days and go to Dizful and probably returning here go to Ispahan, X suppose, by Lynch’s road.4 A 26th February iP(95.—Wrote out a memorandum of what I understand Wan Hoggen to have said on Tuesday were the details of his scheme for irrigating°block of land in one year and made a plan showing a block of land and”from information he gave^ me at the time, sections of his channels. Sent this memorandum and plan to Van Hoggen to ascertain whether they represent fairly accurately his present proposals. (These or copies of them will be submitted to Foreign Office when received back from Van Ro^gen.) Van Roggen gave me an enamelled gauge, which he has spare, to erect below rapids near where the Mohammerah steamer lies at anchor. This gauge can easily be recorded by Wilson and uill give better results than those of Van Roggen’s lower gauge on the rapids where there is a strong current setting almost on to the gauge and a resulting swirl of water. Kenny and Lorimer came down the rapids without mischance, though they bumped at intervals. There was a greater fall at first line of rocks (nearest Ahwaz village) than on 21st instant, the river being slightly lower than on that day. Plotted both discharges taken and finished off calculations. The gauge (lower) on 24th read 16 3—16'4, morning and evening, the same practically as the gauge evolved from readings taken on 12th, 13th and 14th dates of previous discharge. The discharge on 24th instant works out to 29,060 cusecs or about 3,050 cusecs more than before, with mean velocity 2’63 against 2‘53, area of waterway 11,061 square feet against 10,268 and R=8 , 973 against 8-727. Probably the true discharge with lower gauge reading 16 4 (=5*4 feet above its zero) is 28,000 cusecs. If I had had a level I could make fair calculation for discharge of lower river after recording surface slope of river. No news of beilam (native boat) which is bringing, among other things, the long delayed level. The bellam is said to have left Mohammerah on the 17th instant and should have been here before this. Van Roggen’s assistant with the draughtsman are apparently still surveying the Koh Abdullah reach, as I asked Van Roggen for a plan of the rapids I understood he had had made, and he says in reply he has only a plan of the rocks at site proposed and of the ancient dam and that he will make a copy of this himself as the other gentlemen are out in camp. (At Koh Abdullah about 8 miles below Bandar Nasiri is a bad bend in the river, and it is stated that there is a ledge of rocks and some fallen masonry in the river. As Van Roggen is keen on keeping up the navigation and perhaps on improving it, he is contemplating removing the rocks and fallen masonry. 27th February 1905 .—On Saturday evening (25th) I walked from point about 100 yards above where “ Shushan ” lies—just above the village of Ahwaz for about a mile along the high ground lying between the river and the hills near Ahwaz, on which are the ruins of the old town of Ahwaz (ancient Aginis). Here are deep excavations now being made for getting at the stone used in the old town, numerous round blocks of sandstone which were, probably, from the number of them to be found, used in the pillars of the houses of the old town. These are being excavated and dug out for use in modern buildings. Most of the stone used in the old town of Aginis is soft sandstone, the prevailing kind of stone here, but I found some blocks in a deep excavation of what is harder stone. What I was mainly endeavouring to find is where the old canal of the Sassanian period (supposing there was only one and that taking off above the present town of Ahwaz, as appears to be the case from what looks like the remains of an old canal of the inundation canal type) passed through what is now high ground abutting on to the town of Ahwaz. There is a small gap about 200 yards from the river and judging by the fact that the ruins of Aginis are deep below the present ground surface, it appears probable that this high ground is mainly of comparatively recent formation and consists partly of the ruins of the old town. About 1| miles from the river there is a broad gap in the hills of Ahwaz through which a present dry canal could be taken provided the formation below soil permits of this being done, i.e. 9 rock is not met with. In any case there will be some considerable expenditure required in this part of the alignment of the canal, for Van Roggen’s scheme.5 28th February 1905 ,—Wrote up diary extract for Foreign Office. Blosse Lynch came in early about 8 a.m. Tents came by her—(it is now nearly 5 weeks since they were despatched from C awn pore,'the delay being mainly due to dilatoriness on part of British Indian Company’s Agents at Karachi). 8aw Captain of Blosse Lynch, Beynolds, who says that the mark ^111 on tht southern wall of compound of Lynch’s house riverside is undoubtedly 8 feet above what former Captain of Maljmir Adie took as his low water mark but as has already been shown this low water mark does not represent true low water mark of the river at Bandar Nasiri. Adie in 1901 gives several records of water at Bandar Nasiri as being well below the low water mark (vide diagram of fluctuation of river Karun for 1900 and 1901 sent with diary on 22nd February 1905). Beynolds says greatest difficulty met with in navigating Karun to Mohammerah is when river falls after a rise. This is probably due to high river bringing down silt which is freely deposited as river falls causing a change in the channels. As far as he can judge, though there is no certainty here in the matter, navigation is very difficult when the river is at a level about 5 feet below .Adie’s VIII mark or about 3 feet above his low water mark. Beynolds says the water in the Karun in March and April, when the highest river may be expected, is thick like peasoup. Be has been asked to take a sample of the water in one of these tw ? o months for Sir W. Willcocks and this would be the time of year to make some experi ments as to the amount of silt in the river. It is in March that Van Boggen proposes to store his reservoirs and canals as no water is to be drawn from river except in December, January, February and March for direct irrigation. Went in evening to top of highest peak of Ahwaz hills from which point a good view of all that there is to be seen is to be had. Except for a few villages, of which I identified Shikara about 6^ miles, Koh Abdullah about '7 miles and possibly Koh Omerah about 10J miles distant in the meanderings of the Karun, the river itself winding about north and south, the continuation of the Ahw az hills approximately east and west and the Bakhtiari hills to the north, the country is a vast featureless plain, to survey which with any accu racy would require survey marks. Unless it is deep down below the surface there is no good stone to be had on southern side of the Ahwaz hills that I could see. On the northern slope of the hills I climbed is a vast mass of wffiat appears good sandstone which could well be used in building w orks. Where it is exactly the ancient builders quarried their stone for the great dam (I could not ascertain ?) as there are no signs anywhere, as far as I have been able to see, of extensive quarries, traces of which one would expect to find here. At the foot of the hills on the south side the ground slopes away to the level plain for 210 yards or so and is covered with fragments of bricks and pottery. W 7 ilson proposes to go to Bandikir by the “ Shushan ” on Saturday (4th March) and waiting there till Tuesday while the Shushan ” goes to Shelieh with cargo and then returns, attempt the ascent of the Diz to Dizful and so to Susa and thence to Shuster by land. If the ascent of the Diz is not possible he will return to Bandikir and so by river to Shelieh and by road from that place to Shuster being away, as he calculates, for some 10 days. I propose to go to Bandikir by road leaving on Saturday and survey the river between Ahwaz and Bandikir reaching Bandikir on Tuesday and then go on wiih Wilson by which means I shall be able to see something of the country and its resources. I should certainly go to Shuster where lime is manufactured and the rest of the tour, beyond Bundikir, wdll probably prove of service. 1st March .—Writing up diary and letters, official and private, as I w^ant to-morrow (mail day) for taking a 3rd discharge of the river wuth help of the Captain of the Bloose Lynch who can most conveniently come that day. Saw a Mahala being loaded with bags of lime. Made enquiries as to its cost at the office of the Moez-ut-Tujjar, a large merchant owning land here and living in Tehran. A bag is said to contain 18 Shuster maunds. A Shuster maund is given in a report by H. W. Maclean on British Trade in Persia for Board of Trade, 1904, page 51, as about 15-45 lbs. A bag as' roughly measured containsG 5^ cubit feat of roughly ground lime. The cost of 100 maunds (Shuster) in Shuster, the town of origin, is said to be 10—12 krans according to quality; and carriage of same to Bandar Nasiri as 2 krans per bag of which 1 kran is the value of the bag ! Reduced to English denomination the cost of the lime in Shuster would be 29—34 Rs. per cwt. with an additional 1^ rupees per cwt. for carriage and cost of bags to Bandar Nasiri. These figures should be tested elsewhere. It is also stated that the distance limestone is brought from the hills to Shuster is about 9 miles—(3 farsakhs). Ahwaz ; Ut March 1905 . W. R.

While not for a moment doubting that the irrigation scheme as proposed by you is feasible, I shall have to satisfy the Government of India that such is the case, and in thinkinir over what you said yesterday and working out figures, 1 find that there must be something wrong in what I understood you to say. I have therefore written down and send you herewith on half margin what I understood you to say as your scheme for next 24 years. I should be much obliged if you will check what I have written and give your comments on the half margin I have left- I should also be glad if you could give me a copy of the diagram you showed me yesterday with a short explanatory note of proposed arrangement for letting in water and the lock arrangements and what height you propose to raise the water when at its highest in the river by means of the weirs. I think you have not taken any levels of the ground at present. Could you also give me sometime a copy of section of line of weir showing what is to be taken as highest flood level in the river corresponding to the recorded level last year on Lynch’s house ^doorstep. I could of course do much of this myself, i.e., I could take a section of the line of the proposed weir and show maximum high flood level on it, but it would be waste of time doing what you have already done. Might I tell the Government of India that you have sent in a preliminary report to the Persian Government of your scheme and hope to be able to finish out-door work by April and to elaborate the scheme during the coming hot weather in Tehran, as the Government of India might possibly like to have a copy of the whole scheme in writing and might in that case wish to ask the Persian Government to send them a copy. The ultimate scheme may perhaps modify something of what you propose now. With apologies, etc. Enclosure — Note dated the 9 th February 1905.2 [^Confidential. Enclosrire B to copy of extract of diary for period ending loth February 1905, pages 1 and 2. Mr. Van Roggen's scheme as I understand it prom conversation with him. The scheme is planned with a view to preventing any diminution in the amount of water in the Karoon river beyond what it is at present, i.e., in Pebmary 1903, when the river is a good deal lower than it is generally at the same period of the year. In 21 years a block of land 19,200 metres square * J corresponding to about 80,000 English # t. c., 19,200 metres x 19,200 metres. /j -i • ° i o l t t acres (taking metre as Oy^ teet and 1 foot=3yards and 4,840 square yards=one acre). Year by yejtr J^th of this area (=about 3,300 acres) would be irrigated, and at the same time a reservoir would be dug holding sufficient water to supply water for irrigation purposes to this area at low seasons, i.e., a suitable reservoir would be dug each year of capacity to supply water, when river is low for irrigating 3,300 acres. Now the river is as low as it is at the present moment for at least four months in the year and perhaps, exceptionally, for six months, so that at least four months’ capacity must be arranged for in the reservoir. I told Mr. Van Roggen that in the Punjab we allowed now 2*8 cusecs (i.e., cubic feet per second) for irrigating 1,000 acres calculated to be enough to mature, in the year, half that area, i.e., 500 acres in two seasons. He worked out figures to show that his allowance is about 4 times this, but says it amounts to 10 cusecs per thousand acres. Therefore for a block of 3,300 acres 33 cusecs would be allowed. Now 33 cusecs=33 x 60 sec. X 60 min. x 24 hrs. X120 days for 120 days or four months —312,144,000 cubic feet to be stored in each reservoir. I do not know the ground well enough to say accurately, but I should say the reservoirs could not be dug into the ground deeper than 20 feet, as, in order to utilise the water for irrigation purposes, the lowest depth must be high enough to command the land unless lift is contemplated, and lift is expensive to the cultivator. I do not know to what length it is proposed to raise the high water in the river by means of the proposed weir, but I suppose it would not exceed say 10 feet. The reservoirs would therefore be 30 feet deep on these assumptions. The average area of each reservoir for each of the blocks of 3,300 acres would then work out to 342&gt; y o 4 - 000 =11,404,800 square feet, which appears very excessive and much larger than the area shown on Mr. Van Roggen’s diagram which, I presume, is drawn to scale, and which, I should say, shows a reservoir to be not larger than about 2,400 metres X100 metres or less than 2,300,000 square feet, taking a metre as b yi feet. Some reliable information on these points is evidently required. W. R. MORTON, Major, B.E. Ahwaz : 9th February 1905.

[ Confidential^] Enclosure T) to extract from diary for period ending 15th February 1905,pages 1 and 9. Comments on Note of Major Morton, R.E. 1. I am not sure whether the level in the river will be lower as it was in February up to the 11th included - people told me so, but at any rate the first point of which 1 have been thinking is not to hamper the navigation on the lower Karoon, as it is of vital importance of the undertaking that the produces should be transported by water to Mohammerah. It remains to be studied if this can be done without digging storage reservoirs. 2. The block of land which will be brought in cultivation in 24 years is 24,000 hectares (HA), covering a total area of 3 X 6,400=19,200 metres (M) in southerly direction, by 8 X 2,240=17,920 M in easterly direction, or 34,400 HA in round figures. The difference will be used for canals, levees and roads. Yearly a lot of 1,000 HA net will be brought in cultivation, but it makes a point of study whether this surface can be conveniently doubled. 3. The capacity of the reservoirs was calculated for 140 days, or 20 days more than the suggested 120 days. 4. 2*8 c. ft. per second per 1,000 ncres correspond to 0*196 CM per second per 1,000 HA. This works out to 2,032,128 CM in 120 days or 2,360,000 CM in 140 days for 1,000 HA. 4 («) I took the quantity of 8,500,000 CM or 300,090,000 c.ft. in accordance to the practice in Egypt. 4 (&amp;) Mr. Lang Anderson says on page 233 of the Journal of the Khedivial Agricultural Society and the School of Agriculture at Cairo (Volume V, Nov ember—December 1903, No. 6):— “In Upper Egypt for summer crops the calculation for the year 1901 was 29 CM per feddan per 24 hours (this was an exceptional dry year). For the area cultivated with summer crop, exclusive of rice, it may be accepted that 25 CM per feddan per 24 hours is sufficient.” 4 (c) In working out this figure, the amount of water for 1,000 HA in 140 days will be 8,333,000 CM or in round figures 8,500,000 CM or 3 7 times the Punjab figure. 4 (d) Sir Milliam Wilcocks says on page 1 of “The Nile Reservoir Dam at Assuan and . After — “ In Lower Egypt 1 c.ft. of water in summer suffices for 115 acres of cotton and dry crops. In Upper Egypt the same discharge suffices for 85 acres of sugarcane and cotton.” 4 (e) In working out the last-named figure, the amount of water for 1,000 HA for 140 days will be 9,940,000 CM, or about 4*2 times the Punjab figure. 5. By raising the water level to the 4*50 M mark the bottom of the main canal may be kept at 5 M below this mark *. the bottom is level till the end of the first block is reached. 5 (a) The total amount of water necessary after 24 years will consequently be 24x8,500,000 CM=204,000,000 CM, while the total canal capacity is4 124,680,000 CM, the difference being 79,320,000 CM which will either be found by storing water in reservoirs, or by taking it directly from the Karoon. 5 (b) This is a point to be settled after. 14th February 1905. ) [Confidential.] Enclosure E to extract from diary for period ending 15th February 1905, pages 1-3. The scheme as it has been studied actually consists of the following :— (a) The land to the east and to the south of Ahwaz will be brought into cultivation by the Persian Government, in blocks of 24,000 hectares HA) net, in periods of 24 years each, the surface to be brought in cultivation yearly, besides what has been done previously, being 1,000 HA net. (b) The necessary water to irrigate this land will be taken from the Karoon river, great care being taken that the navigation on the Lower Karoon will always be possible for steamers of the size and draught of Messrs. Lynch’s Com pany. This is of vital importance for the success of the undertaking, as the transport of the produces is planned to take place by water to Mohammerah, where they will be loaded on board the Ocean steamers without breaking the (c) To that effect it seems at first sight necessary to store water in reser voirs, in addition to the large irrigation canals running through the land, in order to make up for the difference between the canal capacity and the total amount of water wanted. The difference will be 79,;;20,o00 cubic metres (CM) after 24 years, as explained in No. 4 of my comments to Major Viorton’s note. This quantity must be found either in reservoirs or by drawing water directly from the river. The question must be studied from the latter point of (d) To that effect I have calculated the quantity of water per second corre sponding to this difference of 79,320,000 CM over 140 days: this will work out to be 6 - 5 CM per second, and nllowingthe double amount for some periods of the year, we will assume a quantity of say 15 CM per second. Taking the volume of water passing through the gap between the rocks at Ahwaz, with the excep tional low water up to February 11th, 1905, as 660 CM per second, it wull be seen that the level in front of the house of Messrs. Lynch at Nasseri will be lowered by 4', and on the ridge which runs between the two shoals in front of the village of Abadallah, 2-J'. In the first year of irrigation, this difference will be only ¥ Vth of the said figures, which consequently may be neglected. (&lt;?) It will be seen from the above stated that even taking the most unfavourable conditions, which may occur after 24 years, it will be possible to irrigate the land 1 - without digging reservoirs, and without affecting the naviga tion on the Lower Karoon at summer level. (f) The water will be taken in by means of sluices, which open automati cally when the level in the river is higher than in the canals, and which will close when the reverse takes place. Two shipping locks will be provided for the passage of the “ Shushan ” and the native boats plying between Ahwaz and fehushter. These locks are marked A and B on the accompanying diagram. In order to enable the barges loaded with produces to proceed to Mohammerah without breaking the cargo and to discharge alongside of the Ocean steamers, a lock will be built ro the south of Ahwuz, marked C on the diagram. (g) The water-level at the dam will be raised to the mark 4*50M. (^) Assuming a slope of 35M over 145,000M, being the distance as the crow flies from Ahwaz to the sea (this height having been found by observations oi former travellers) or 24 centimetres for every 1,OOOM, it will be seen that GRAADT VAN ROGGEN, Engineer in charge of Study of Ahwaz Works.

In regard to the high flood level February &amp; ra P h ( 2 h 1903 marked on the latter and referred to in Enclosure A, it may be noted that in February 1903 (not last year as I wrote in Enclosure A) a very high flood took place—as far as any one here knows it was the highest flood known, and it came to^ doorstep of Messrs. Lynch’s house at Bandar Nasseri. This Bandar Nasseri is about one mile below the village of Ahwaz at the commence ment of the Ahwaz rapids {vide diagram sent herewith). Vide last part of enclosure A. Mr. Van Boggen, it will be seen Enclosure c, par*, from other enclosures, is at least somewhat doubtful whether he will require graph W* reservoirs. He has not taken many levels yet and his scheme is only in the initial stage of development. I think the Government of India might perhaps ask later for a full detailed scheme. It seems somewhat premature to com ment on a scheme in the state Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme is at present. I arrived at Bandar JNasseri on the 6th of February, and I was told by the Enclosure D, para- Captain of the Blosse Lynch* the steamer I came in from Mohammerah, that graph (B- the Karoon river was exceptionally low for the time of the year owing to there having been no rainfall, but that the river was not by any means at its lowest recorded level. I was informed that it has been known to go quite feet below the level it reached (about the 6th February of) this year, 1905. There are of course no records of fluctuations of river as by means of gauges. Mr. Van Boggen has put up two gauges since he came here about two months ago, which will be mentioned again further on. It may perhaps be possible to find out from the records of the Lynch’s steamers, the Malamiah and the Shushan, approximately the periods and, very approximately, the height of low water in the Karoon at Bandar JSTasseri. I have asked Mr. Wilson (Lynch’s agent here) to see if the records of steamer voyages are available for a series of years. The records for a year or two would not be of much value. When Mr. Van Boggen explained his scheme to me on the 8th February he made a great puint of the reservoir scheme for storing water to tide over periods of low water in the Karoon, bat he seems now to be in great doubt whether this reservoir scheme is feasible. I should say, from what I have seen of the ground, he has no chance of making reservoirs, but in the absence of levels it is not possible to give a decided opinion at present. Reduced to English denominations a block of land, 85,000 acres in area, Enclosure D, para- is to be dealt with in 24 years, of which. 59,300 acres is to be cultivated, the g^aph OB. rest being used for canals, levees (a term I do not understand), and roads. The difference would perhaps also include patches of land which are unsuitable for cultivation. Year by year I th of 59,300 acres would be dealt with = 2,471Enclo*nre D graph ( 3 ). Enclosure D graph ( 4 ). Enclosure graph 4 (a) Enclosure graph 4 ( 6 ). Enclosure ’ graphs 4 (&lt; 2 ) ^cres, though Mr. Van Roggen is now in doubt whether this is not a rather small area to deal with at one time. para- If reservoirs are to be made they must be of capacity to tide over seasons of low water in the Karoon. It is altogether uncertain whether over a series of years Mr. Van Roggen’s allowance of 140 days is sufficient for this or not. In the absence of records it is not possible to say definitely. Mr. Wffison thinks that the low periods, when, if navigation on the Lower Karoon is to he kept up, it should not be interfered with, may be as much as months — lop days. One of the first things necessary is to make endeavours to clear up this point. , para- Vide enclosure B. I gave Mr. Van Roggen 2*8 cusecs as the allowance now made in the Punjab—referring to low land on Jhelum Canal per thousand acres to mature half that area per year. 2*8 cusecs per thousand hectares = 2 8 X 2*471 cusecs = 6*9188 cusecs and at 35*3 cubic feet per cubic metre this allowance is 0*196 cubic metres for 1,000 hectares as stated by Mr. Van Roggen. His figure of 2,360,000 cubic metres to be arranged for for a period of 140 days=2,360,000x35*3 cubic feet = 83,308,000 cubic feet to be stored for every small block of 2,471 acres. As stated below in paragraph 4 (c) '» P ara * of enclosure D, Mr. Van Roggen makes a much larger allowance and the storage capacity of each reservoir is to be 8^ million cubic metres or 300 million cubic feet. In the reservoirs required on this basis for the period of 24 years, a storage capacity of 7,200 million cubic feet would have to be arranged for. It is impossible to say at present in the absence of levels what depth of water the reservoirs could be made to hold, and as Mr. Van Roggen makes no comment on this point raised by me in enclosure B, I presume he has not as yet considered the question. Taking this depth as 30 feet, the mean area of one reservoir, supposing the initial reservoirs were enlarged year by year, for the areas of land to be brought under irrigation year by year, for the block of land to be irrigated at the end of 24 years would be -■ 200 '^ Q - QfK) square feet or 240 million square feet, or say 15,600 feet by 15,500 feet, or say 3 miles in each direction. Mr. Van Roggen evidently takes the lower of Mr. Lang Anderson’s figures, viz., 25 cubic &gt;, para- metres per feddan per 24 hours =25 X cubic metres per hectare of 2*471 acres, a feddan being 1*1019 acres {vide Whitaker’s Almanac for 1904, pages 450 and 723) = 25 X 2*242 cubic metres per hectare per 24 hours, or 25x2,242x140=7,847,000 cubic metres per 1,000 hectare for 140 days. The higher of Mr. Lang Anderson’s allowance, viz., 29 cubic metres per 24 hours, works out to 9,102,520 cubic metres per thousand hectares for 140 days. The one is less and the other more than the 8,333,000 cubic metres given D ’nd 4 M ^ ^- r * V an Roggen in paragraph 4(c) of enclosure D. It is hardly necessary an to work out figures based on Sir William Willcock’s allowance. The discre pancy between the allowance made in the Punjab and that made in Egypt is due to the fact that in the former the allowance is 2*8 cusecs per l,OoO acres based on the assumption that only half this area is to be actually irrigated in the year and two-thirds of this again in the kharif or summer season, while the figures given by Mr. Van Roggen as those ruling in Egypt are merely the actual allow ance of water to mature an area. Taking 2 8 cusecs per 1,000 acres, of which half is to be cultivated or irrigated in the year and two-thirds of this again for the kharif or summer season, the actual allowance of water for maturing an acre in the summer season would be in cubic metres per feddan for 24 hours — 2’8 (cnsecs) ^ $ x £ x 1,000 (acres) ^ 60 x 60 x 24 (seconds a dsiy) 35'3 (cubic feet to cubic metre) X 1*1019 (acres to feddan) = 22*8 cubic metres per feddan per 24 hours, which does not differ much from Mr. Anderson’s figure of 25 cubic metres for same area and time. Mr. Van Roggen evidently contemplates irrigating the whole available area (less the allowance for roads, etc , mentioned in paragraph 2 of enclosure D) each season. I think this is out of the question, as the soil would soon be exhausted unless it can be shown that the silt in the river possesses some extraordinary fertilising properties corresponding to the silt of the Nile in Egypt. The Karoon certainly brings down heavy silt in floods —even at time of writing there7 are not known at present is much silt in the river. Its amount and nature and must be investigated. This is shown on section line in Karoon river at probable place of future Enclosure d, weir (plan 2 sent herewith). Though Mr. Van Roggen calls the obstruction parHgraph ,6) * placed in the river to raise the water surface in the river a weir, I think he means a dam on the principle of the Assouan dam with openings closed by gates. Only by such means would he be able to raise the water surface as much as he contemplates, viz., metres, or about 5 feet above the maximum recorded high flood level of February 1903. In the absence of levels of the ground it is not possible for any one to say Enclosure d, nar*- how the levels of proposed raised water in river would work out. Mr. Van 8raph (5) ‘ Roggen appears to contemplate making a channel in which water would be about five metres or about 16 feet deep, and the channel for its off-take in the river above the weir (or dam) at B to end of first block would not be graded 0n P lan 1 * but have a level bed. I presume by first block he means the small area marked A on plan 1 sent herewith. If this is so, the length of the ungraded channel would be about 11 miles. If he means to end of the whole block of 24 small blocks the length would be about 18 miles, from B to D on plan 1. It would appear that the assumption made above in comments on enclosure D, paragraph 4(a), that reservoirs might be made to hold water 30 feet deep, is very excessive and the mean area there calculated out of about 3 miles square would have to be proportionately increased. 204,000,000 cubic metres are the equivalent of about 7,200 million Enc i 0Bure D &gt; cubic feet as given above. I do not understand Mr. Van Roggen’s argument p, ' ragraph 5 (a) - when he says that only 79,320,000 cubic metres or in round number 2,800 million cubic feet only would have to be stored in reservoirs. Whatever amount of water would have to be stored to tide over low supplies in the Karoon river, that same amount would have to be arranged for in the reservoirs. The canal capacity cannot be deducted. From his remark in paragraph 5(6) of enclosure B, it appears that Mr. Van Roggen has still a great deal to do before he can mature his scheme. He must in the first place decide definitely w r hether he must arrange for reservoirs or not. It is useless making proposals for reservoirs unless they are really wanted. I do not myself think that his reservoir scheme can be treated seriously. The only feasible way of impounding water would be in the river itself. This does not appear to be possible in the river at Ahwaz, as was done at Assouan on the Nile in Egypt. It might perhaps be done at some place much higher up the river if a suitable site could be found and arrangements made for controlling the impounded water. It would be necessary to visit the upper waters of the Karoon to investigate this point. The cost of doing this work of storing water in the upper reaches of the Karoon would however in all probability be prohibitive to the Ahwaz scheme, especially when it is considered that Mr. Van Roggen contemplates only dealing with some 59,000 acres after a period of 24 years and year by year so small a block as 2,400 acres. This is a repetition of what has already been commented E a n r c a g 9 r m p e h9 E J a ) on in respect of enclosure I) above. and (c). Mr. Van Roggen here repeats his error of assuming that his reservoirs Enclosure e, would only have to hold a capacity of 79,320,000 cubic metres or 2,800 million partgraph (d) ' cubic feet already dealt with. As already stated, he would, with reservoirs and to avoid lowering the water at its lowest level in the lower Karoon, have to store the full amount required for the period of low supply in the Karoon, viz., of 7,200 million cubic feet or about 2% times the amount he calculates to be required. 79,320,000 cubic metres is given by 6-5 cubic metres per second for 140 days as stated by Mr. Van Roggen (6*5 X 60 X 60 X 24 X 140=78,624,000 cubic metres). If he requires to assume that in exceptional cases he would without reservoirs have to abstract say 15 cubic metres a second, this latter figure must be multiplied by 2^ = 37'5 cubic metres or 1,222*75 cubic feet per second to be taken from the river for a period of 140 days. I do not follow his argument as to the a mount the water surface would be lowered below its level about 11th February 1905. I do not think he has sufficient data to form an opinion on this point. As already stated, the river was excep tionally low for the time of the year in February 1905, but not by any means:=r=j 8 at its lowest. It may be mentioned that in coming up from Mohammerah on its * last journey to Bandar Nasseri the Ulosse Lynch drawing S' 11' of water with only 80 tons of cargo on board went aground at Kut Abdullah, some 7 miles below Bandar Nasseri. This was on the 6th February. Though the steamer eventually found a channel and came up to Bandar Nasseri all right, it is evident that with still lower water in the river no interference with the amount of water available could be allowed if reasonable navigation is to be maintained. Careful enquiry may possibly show that lighter draught steamers than the Blosse Lynch would pay if worked on the Lower Karoon, and no doubt if an irrigation scheme of some magnitude were brought into operation, it would be necessary for Messrs Lynch &amp; Co. to increase their fleet of steamers and so they might build other steamers of lighter draught. It is necessary, however, at present to take things as they are and to arrange for present circumstances if the navigation by steamers on the Lower Karoon is to be kept up. Personally I am of opinion that the question of maintaining the navigation on the Lower Karoon is likely to conflict seriously with the success of an irrigation scheme for the Karoon at Ahwaz and that either one or the other should be upheld. If the irrigation scheme is required, navigation of the Lower Karoon should give way to it and vice versa if navigation of the Lower Karoon is the more important, the irrigation scheme should give way. Certainly for some seasons in the year both might work together, but it is just as much a question whether it would pay anyone to navigate by steamers for only a portion of the year as it is whether it would pay to have an irrigation scheme involving some obstruc tion in the river as a weir or dam—costing a large sum of money—which could only be worked for part of the year. Without going at present far into the ques tion, for which data are lacking at present, it may be stated here that the low season of the river is approximately from May or June to November. As far as I have been able to ascertain from conversation with the Captain of the Blosse Lynch and Mr. Wilson, Lynch’s agent, the Karoon begins to rise about the end of the month of November, fed by the usual rains commencing at that time. That the periods of rises and low water do not correspond to those we are accus tomed to in India is evidenced by the fact that the maximum high flood level recorded was in a month of February, viz., February 1903. This year and 1904 (last year) are and were exceptionally low years owing to there being very small rainfall. The river rising from the end of November fed by rain in normal years continues to rise with fluctuations up to May, being further fed from end of April or beginning of May by the melting of snows on the high ranges of hills from which the river off-takes. From about the end of May the river generally falls to some time in October, when it remains steady till its time for rising again in November. It will be seen that the Karoon is at its worst level in the hot season, when, from an irrigation point of view, most water is required for the summer crops which correspond to those we grow in India, viz., cotton, sugarcane, indigo. Low water generally then occurs just at a season of the greatest demand, and the temptation to interfere with navigation, were an irrigation scheme carried out, would undoubtedly be great. While there is only one way to make an irrigation scheme pay, and that is to provide as far as possi ble an adequate supply of water, there is, here at any rate, a feasible alternative which can be provided for dealing with the removal of produce and the import of goods and that is of course by means of a railway. I have not time to go further into this question at present, but it is w r orth studying. Enclosure E, paragraphs (e), (/) and (g). Enclosure E. paragraph (A). After what has already been written above I do not think there is any need to comment on the remarks made by Mr. Van Roggen in these paragraphs. The argument here is somewhat obscure. Thirty-five metres given as the slope over the direct distance from Ahwaz to the sea is the equivalent of 114-8 feet. The only recorded height I know of is that of Ahwaz village given on maps as 220 feet presumably above the sea-level. I do not quite see how this can give the height of water level over the surrounding land. I will ask Mr. Van Roggen about this. In any case the assumption, as Mr. Van Roggen states in paragraph (i), requires to be checked. Ahwaz : 15th February 1905 } W. R. MORTON. Major, B.E.9 ^ [Confidential-] Extract from diary of Major Morton, on special duty, continued from 4th February 1905 1 pages 9 - 12 . 5th February 7-905.—Spent day in taking notes from Intelligence Branch report by Captain Napier on South-West Persia of Karoon river and a few other points of general interest likely to be useful in considering the Karoon river ^ Ahwaz scheme. 6th February 1905.—Went on board Blosse Lynch last night with Lieuten ant Lorimer, Vice-Consul at Ahwaz. JBlosse Lynch left Mohammerah about 5*80 a. M. A Belgian, Monsieur Darcher, and Mr. Wilson, Lynch’s agent at Ahwaz (Bandar Nasseri) are on board. The former is Director of Agriculture at Tehran and is on his way to Ahwaz to look into Van Roggen’s scheme from an agricultural point of view. He came overland from Tehran to Baghdad and Busrah. He had heard of my coming, but I do not know whether. from Tehran or elsewhere. I told him that I had been asked by Government of India to examine Mr. Van Roggen’s scheme as regards its effect on the navigation of the Karoon river. Note. —There is no necessity for making any remark on the voyage on 6 th February. The general scenery is well described in Curzon's “ Persia.” I noted that Blosse Lynch drew 3' W' with a cargo of 80 tons. Some lift arrangements, a wheel and bucket resembling the “ mote ** shown and described in Buckley’s Irrigation Works, page 3, were seen. Generally 3 or 4 of these lifts work side by side and the emptying arrange ment is automatic. Anchored for night off village of Ismailia about two-thirds of distance to Ahwaz. 7th February 1905. —Again left anchorage early in morning, about 5-30 a.m. Navigation near village of Kut Abdullah somewhat difficult and Blosse Lynch went aground. Some time spent about 9 a.m. in searching for a channel. The river is rather low for this time of year, but lowest river is said to be one to two feet lower still. The river in year 1903 about this time of year came up to second step of entrance of Lynch’s house (at Bandar Nasseri) flooding the garden and extending some distance inland. This was the highest flood known. Arrived at Bandar Nasseri (about 1| miles below Ahwaz and at the southern end of the Ahwaz rapids) about 12 noon, anchoring off Lynch’s house and passing first or lowest ledge of rocks and the village of Yemniayah on the right bank of the river (Bandar Nasseri being like Ahwaz on the left bank). Went ashore late, put up by Wilson with whom will live Tod who has been acting for him, and who will remain here for the present, and an Armenian Assistant. In evening went with Lorimer to site of old weir which was skew at an angle of about 60° to axis of rapids along a high ledge of rocks. There are some traces of the old weir visible and near the right bank a high mass of masonry probably showing height of the old weir. There are several cuts in the ledge of rocks utilised for rough water wheels driving small one stone flour mills. A tramway of 3'0' gauge goes from Bandar Nassiri to Ahwaz, mainly used for goods. Rails roughly laid with no allowance for expansion in rough sleepers. Met Van Roggen and Darcher on the old weir site, exchanged com pliments and went with them to Ahwaz, where we visited a small garden and a four-wheel water-lift which irrigates the garden. In the latter beans and onions are grown with some date palms. It is said by Lynch’s agent, Mr. Wilson, that Mr. Van Roggen has given out that money for his scheme is forthcoming. As far as I understand the Persian Government is said to have the money. Wilson also says river Karoon generally begins to rise about end of November after being lowest from May to that month. There is no record of rise and fall at present, nor of rainfall.10 is a well-fixed I do not know above Lynch’s it is difficult to 8th February Called on Sheikh Khanzal, the chief Sheikh here and a nephew of the Sheikh at Mohammerah. Gave him sealed letter from his uncle. The Sheikh (of Ahwaz) said if I gave him two days notice he would give me necessary assistance if I had to go out into the district. We had some conversation, Lorimer interpreting, about canals m India. The Sheikh did not express any opinion on Van Etoggen’s scheme. In the early morning I was out and went to head of rapids. Van Roggen has put up a 50 decimetre gauge (=5 metres or about 16 feet) above the 'rapids near where the Shushan which irrigates the upper Karoon anchors when at Ahwaz, The gauge reads to centimetres and enamelled gauge. I noted present reading to be 1*2 metres, what the reduced level of its zero is. He has also put up a similar gauge about 200 yards There is a fairly strong current at this point, and read the gauge accurately. I think a gauge should be fixed below the rapids. Called on Mr. Van Roggen in the afternoon. He was busy with his mail, but I had about one hoar’s conversation with him. I told him that I understood he had been informed that I had been asked by the Government of India to look into question of effect of his scheme on navigation of the Karoon river and told him that in India such a scheme would be made to drain off all water from river. He asked me what the general arrangement of an Indian canal scheme is and asked whether I had heard of storage of water in India. I said there was a proposal for storing water in the hills—referring to Walar Lake—and that Lorimer (I.C.S.) had told me of a storage scheme in Kama! of which I had not previously heard. This scheme is, I understand, for storing water of Western Jumna canal at some distance down the canal. Lorimer did not know or at any rate did not give me details of this scheme* Van Boggen said his scheme was for a series of reservoirs above the range of hills near Ahwaz and that he would guarantee his scheme would not lower the water in the river (Karoon) beyond what it is at present. He showed me a diagram of the general arrangements he had made. His scheme appears to be somewhat fantastic. He also showed me a section of line of old dam or weir. His proposed dam across the Karoon is to be on the site of this old dam or weir. It is to raise the high water-level in the river to a considerable extent. Note .—I entered in my diary some further notes of Van Roggen’s scheme, but as- I wrote tq hini about,the figures he gave me and have received his reply in time to comment on it, and as I am sending his original reply and the plans ( 2 ) he sent, me, etc., 1 do not think there is any necessity for making any further remarks here. 9th February 1905.■ —I had intended starting a Duffadar, who has been sepk to Lorimer (Vice-Consul at Ahwaz) for survey work and who is at present available and whom Lorimer has kindly placed at my disposal whenever I can arrange to give him work, on survey work of river near Ahwaz and Bandar Nasseri. Rather heavy rain fell during the night and the day looked like more rain. The ground became very muddy about here, so I postponed starting the surveyors. I measured discharge of a four-wheel cc mote ” near village of Ahwaz and found it gave about Jth cusec. The men in charge informed me they do not work for more than five hours a day. The. small garden already mentioned on 7th February was being irrigated by this “ mote.” Made enquiries of Wilson as to what an acre of wheat might be expected to produce here. He and Tod said that f cwt. of seed per acre would produce one ton of wheat and that rate (present) at which this produce could be sold would be 26 krans per 3| cwt., one of the numerous local weights called “ mon.” At present 62 krans = £1 sterling. Result per acre ^ £ or about £2-8-0. The rate at which, wheat for export could be sold here would depend most probably on the London price. Wilson thinks that land under cultivation by Van Roggen’s scheme would be farmed out by Persian Government for some- &gt; like h it is estimated to produce, supposing the Persian Government can arrange matters with the Sheikh of A! ohammerah, who, W T ilsoa11 also thinks, is a Very powerful factor to be considered iii the case, ’thus the Persian Government might perhaps get from the farmer £1-4-0 per acre, assum ing the value of produce in case of wheat were estimated to he £2-8-0 per acre. Of course this is a pure estimate, nothing more. Yan Eoggen’s proposal is that Persian Government should work the land themselves. 10th February 1905 .told Wilson that I am strongly of opinion that in ^ an irrigation scheme everything shotild be sacrificed to making it a success. If navigation of Lower Karoon is considered more important than an irrigation scheme, then let navigation be kept up, and, on the other hand, if irrigatioh scheme more important, navigation should be abandoned, if necessary. Evidently, as the river is now as low as it can be to maintain navigation, though it actually - at its lowest may be expected to go about feet lower if water is to be taken for irrigation purposes in the usual Indian way and not by means of reservoirs acting in high river, navigation of Lower Karoon must be affected Wilson said the objection to impeding navigation on Lower Karoon is that any other, means of carrying produce and goods (e.g., a railway to Mohammerah) would make freight charge on the route Ahwaz to Ispahan prohibitive as against its competitor Bushire to Ispahan. He also mentioned that his firm are just beginning to make things pay at Ahwaz. Some figures might perhaps be obtained as to this and statistics of trade between Ahwaz and Ispahan. Wilson asked Sheikh (of Ahwaz) as to his opinion of results in wheat-growing. Sheikh bases his figures on the results in lb95, a very E^ood year, and evidently takes exceptional cases, presuming his figures are at all reliable. It seems to be generally the opinion here that the country near Ahwaz is an exceptionally favourable one for wheat-growing. The Luffadar Surveyor was arranging for poles and flags. Fortunately Lynch’s stores produced a 100 feet chain, but wooden pegs for arrows had to be obtained from the bazaar, which luckily possesses some rou^i carpenters. 11th February 1905 .—Went over the ground to be surveyed with Duffadar who has still some flags and pegs to get made. I was busy myself nearly whole d;iy in making preparations for taking a discharge of the river below the rapids. One of Lynch’s men has arranged to help in getting as many boats up to seven as are available. Went out about 5-30 p.m. to try and get some boats down to-night into position. After some delay persuaded three boats to drop down from their moorings near Bandar Nasseri and anchor in position before it was too dark to see. Got them all right and fastened rope in position. Everything had to be made—pole for measuring and flag poles obtained from JBlosse lynch ; former had to be painted. Rope of sorts, available here and there in bazaar, had to be made double for suificient strength and marked to lengths, etc., etc. 12th February All day spent from early morning to 7 p.m. in trying to set rope fixed up over the other four boats which were available and which had dropped down during the night into some sort of position near discharge site. Not enough boats which are small. Hope snapped repeatedly owing to boats swinging and their anchors not holding. Finally abandoned this and measured depths and velocities at the three boats fixed up successfully near left bank last night. Extent of this part of discharge site 450 feet from left bank or rather more than one-third of whole width. Owing to want of trained men this measurement took a long time. 13th February Had to arrange with Captain of Blos&gt;e Lynch for a rowing boat of a decent kind and some good boat men and also get more rope and more boats. I also had two of boats near left bank, where I completed work yesterday, moved over to near r’ght bank. About midday, alter consi derable trouble, I got the rest of the line finished and spent rest of day in measuring depths and some velocities until it whs too dark to see floats. There still remain about 400 feet over which velocities have to be measured. It was very difficult to get untrained men to run the floats as I wanted them run. I had to get a mistry from Wilson and employ one of my Persian servants who did fairly well after some experience. 14th February 1905 .—Completed discharge of river. I spent some time after this was over in trying with clinometer to get slope of river surface, but found result unsatisfactory. ' A level is much wanted. The Survey Department12 in Calcutta omitted to send a level and stores, though asked in Calcutta to do so, and the level is only now on its way up. It was very foggy up to about 8-30 this morning, a regular river fog. I have not had time to work out discharge of river, but it is probably well over 30,000 cusecs and corresponds to a gauge of 16'5 decimetres—Van Roggen’s river gauge. There was some fluctuation of river surface between the com mencement and end of discharge taking which has been recorded. One of Lorimer’s sowars was impressed into service on two days of the dis charge taking. Received Van Roggen’s reply to my demi-official and note I sent him on 9th, late in the evening. 15th February 1905 .—Writing out comments bn Van Roggen’s reply about his scheme and reducing his figures to English denominations, etc. Wrote out diary for period ending to-day. JBlosse Lynch goes down to-day after a stay for some time, as there is not much cargo for her. W. R. MORTON, Major, R.R here of eight days. She will go to Busrah and is not likely to be back here Ahwaz : 15th February 1905. G. I. C. P. 0.—No. 5907 F. D.—24-3-05. —$0.—B. B. B.-rj« 1 Dated Ahwaz, the 21st February 1905 (Confidential). From— Major W. R. Morton, on special duty, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. With reference to your No. 180 E.-A., dated Eort ‘William, the 14th January 1905, and in continuation of my letters on the same subject, with enclosures, dated 15th February 1905 and 4th February 1905, I have the honour to send you extracts from my diary for period ending 22nd February 1905. I find that I was mistaken when I wrote in my letter of 15th February 1905 that there is only a post from Ahwaz once a fortnight. This was due to a misunderstanding about the steamer of Lynch’s company, which I find does not run regularly—especially just now, when there is little cargo to carry. I find that there is a Persian post every week from Ahwaz, but do not think it advisable to send letters to you by this means. Lieutenant Lorimer, Vice- Consul at Ahwaz, while at Ahwaz, sends a special messenger to Mohammerah, carrying his letters, and I have arranged to send my letters to you by this means. For the°present, therefore, I shall be able to send you my diary every week by Lieutenant Lorimer’s messenger, and the letter, with these enclosures, can be registered at Mohammerah and despatched by the weekly mail to Karachi. Enclosures— Sheets of extract from diary 3 pages. Diagram of fluctuations of River Karun for years 1900 and 19 j 1. Abstract of information from synoptical tables of S. S. “ Malamir {Confidential.) Extract from diary of Major Morton, on Special Duty, for period ending 22nd February 1905. 16th February 1905. —Levelling with clinometer from water level below rapids to upper guage at Ahwaz, &amp;c., to test its accuracy for this sort of work. Not worked out results yet. 17th February. —Working on synoptical tables of “ Malamir” from December 1898 to January 1905. (Note.—Not entered in diary). There are no records of guages, nor other records except in the log books and synoptical tables of Lynch Brothers’ steamers to show, with any degree of accuracy, the periodical rise and fall of the Karun River, and the amount of its rises and falls. I have, therefore, to fall back on and tabulate results from steamer’s records, and for this purpose commenced on 17th to extract what information I could obtain from the synoptical tables of the “ Malamir”, which was on the run from Mohammerah *to Ahwaz (Bandar Nasiri); and, as a commencement, took the records in the book commencing from December 1898 and ending in January 1905, when the “ Malamir” went to Basrah for repairs and was replaced by the “Blosse Lynch” (now running). Examined surveyor’s work. He has been told to take longer shots with his plane table, and put up suitable marks to ensure greater accuracy in his work. He is to restart from his base line. Weather cloudy. 18th February. —Working on synoptical tables of “Malamir”. (Note.— Synoptical table is short record of steamer’s run.) Surveyor taken off my work to do a sketch for Lieutenant Lorimer. 19th February. —Rain began to fall about 3 or 4 a. m., and fell some what heavily at start, followed by light rain till 12 noon. Working on synoptical tables of “ Malamir ” ; Mons. Van Roggen called on me this afternoon ; did not discuss his irrigation scheme. It will be better to write to him for information as far as possible. I asked him, however, whether it would not be difficult to get the land for his irrigation scheme from the Sheikh of Mohammerah, as I understand that the land, if not actually owned by the Sheikh, is completely under his control. Mons. Van Roggen said he thought there would be no2 difficulty, but did not enlarge on this point. He seems to be somewhat reticent in conversation about his scheme, but has so far given me in writing the inform ation 1 have asked him for. Seeing Lieutenant Lorimer (Vice-Consul here) in the evening, I asked him about this question of the Sheikh’s hold on the land (where the irrigation scheme is proposed), and Lorimer said that he thought the question should not be broached to Van Roggen, and that it is a question for the Persian Govern ment. I told Lorimer that it is a question which should be dealt with m reporting on the irrigation scheme, but that I would merely mention the difficulty (as it appears to me) in my report to the Indian Government. Van Roggen explained to me that the word “ levers ” (used in paragraph 2 of enclosure B sent to Poreign Office on 15th February 1905) means embank ment, being a term used for this on the Mississipi. —Finished synoptical table of “ Malamir ”, and made out abstract of the information obtained (sent as enclosure A with diary for period ending 22nd February 1905). Mons. Van Roggen sent me record of his lower guage I asked him for. /^ ote __]S T ot in diary ; as he has been asked for complete records of his two guages since they were put up, there is no necessity for giving here the short record Vie sent me.) Wrote to Mons. Van Roggen for some further information on his note received on 14th instant (sent to Foreign Office as enclosure to extract of diary for period ending 15th February 1905). Surveyor did not work yesterday owing to rainfall. He was at work to-day for me. Captain Kenny, of Lynch’s S. S. “ Shushan ”, says Van Roggen is merely a mechanical engineer, and knows nothing of levelling and survey ing. All such work is done by his Assistant. This might account for his rather strange way of tackling the irrigation part of his scheme. Asked Van Roggen for loan of a theodolite to take a discharge of the river without boats which are difficult to get, and unsatisfactory when obtained. 21st February .—Made diagram of fluctuations of Karun River at Ahwaz from information in synoptical tables of “Malamir”. (Note.—This is sent with this extract from diary, and gives all the information I obtained, so there is no necessity of giving here further remarks on the subject entered in my diary.) Captain Kenny [who has commanded the “ Shushan ” since last May (about) 19041 gave me two books containing records of the “ Shushan ” for P890—-1894 and 1902—1904, which, though rough, may give some reliable information as to the periods of rise and all of river—mainly above Ahwaz. The “ Shushan” now runs only from Ahwaz to Shellalieh, some 0 or 7 miles below Shuster; but in the periods above named and also between 1894 and 1902, worked 'below Bandar Nasiri and made and attempted the passage of the rapids on several occasions. I shall tabulate the information m these two books if I get a clerk from Lynch’s office, as, I think, Wilson can arrange this. Surveyor has completed his work in pencil to below Bandar Nasiri as originally ordered. Told him to extend the survey of river down to village of Shikora (some 6 miles, I believe, below Nasiri). He should first of all get in an area of 12 miles square (about) to include Van Roggen’s scheme as it stands at present for next 24 years; and when a leveller comes up, this area can be levelled at half mile intervals. A smaller scale map of a larger area can also be made. The surveyor has only cut in right bank of River Karun. Some survey work should also be done on this bank (right), but Lorimer says that any extended survey on this side (right bank of river) is impossible owing to the disturbed state of the country here. The surveyor must also give more detail of lines of rocks and rapids than he has shown at present. Tod of Lynch’s, Kenny of “ Shushan ”, and I shot the rapids from start to finish, and nearly got upset at a bend in the rapids owing to recklessness of the Arab steerer and his rowers. Found no difficulty in getting over the rapids in he sm all “belam” (country boat) used, but a larger boat w r ould be better f fSoundings in the pools below each of the lines of rocks (rapids) (five in all) show great depths in many places of over 12 feet (bottom not touched with twelve-foot pole). Between the lowest and second line of rocks the depths are often less—often 6-7 feet. (Van Roggen’s lower guage reads to-day 15-3 ; upper guage 151.) Examined remains of old weir—very rough, hut sound looking work of stone blocks in lime. Lime said to come from gypsum hills about 60 miles away. There are extensive gypsum hills on Lynch’s road from Ahwaz to Ispahan. These are, however, about 100 miles away at the nearest. (Note.—A map showing this road made by Mr. Taylor employed by Lynch’s was sent by Lieutenant Lorimer last year to Survey of India Department, and it is understood a copy of it was made by that Department. It is on a scale of 1' to 1 mile. Have sent for a copy of it from Calcutta.) Van Roggen sent me a theodolite, and wrote to make an appointment for after Wednesday (mail day). I presume this is about what I wrote to him on the 20th instant. Kenny (Captain of “ Shushan ” ) says wood, which is used for fuel on “ Shushan'”, is getting scarce. It comes from the Diz River, and is bought for 2 krans for 120 okes, or, at present rate of exchange of about 4 krans to 1 rupee, for about 2 annas per maund (Indian). 800 okes=l English ton, and 1 English ton=28 maunds, Indian (about). 22nd February .—Writing up extract of diary for Eoreign Office; also letters for despatch by Lorimer’s special messenger, who leaves about 4 P. M. for Mohammerah. Mons. Darcher (referred to in extract from diary on 6th instant) left this morning for Mohammerah in launch belonging to Sheikh of Mohammerah, which came here (for purpose unknown) a few days ago. I have not seen much of Mons. Darcher. He has been suffering a good deal from fever since he came here, he told me. It does not appear he has done very much, if anything, since he came here. I understand he thinks the soil here excellent, as is the general opinion. I should have recorded before the result of discharge taken on 12th, 13th, and 14th instant, and worked out on 16th. Discharge=25,922 cusecs. Mean velocity, 2*53 feet per second. Weller Perimeter, 1,177 feet. R.=8'727.

I have asked Persian Government to recommend him to the good offices ol the local authorities, and they have promised me to do so. But we agree in thinking it better to keep the real object of his mission secret. If any questions are asked, he had better give out that he is examining the possibility of developing communications between the Karun and Central Persia on behalf of Anglo- Indian commerce. Van Roggen has been instructed by the Grand \ izier to discuss [1864 d—6]the Ahwaz dam proposals fully but confidentially with him I suppose either Lonmer or Lvnch’s agent could put him up at Ahwaz, but warn him to take great care as to what he says fn the presence of Ter Meulen. He might also say that Lynch have made representations to His Majesty’s Government as to the results on the navigability of the Karun of building a dam at Ahwaz, and that he has been instructed to look into t ns also. This would account, if necessary, for his interviews with A an Roggen. Show above to Major Morton on his arrival. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Major Cox to Sir A. Hardinge. /Telegraphic } P. Bushire, January 31, 1905 V A DUTCH engineer has arrived at Mohammerah from Ahwaz to interview the Sheikh as to Ahwaz dam. Sheikh wishes to hear views of British Government before committing himself, and has asked me to telegiaph to him 1. Whether the scheme is contemplated seriously ; 2. Whether it meets with our approval; and _ 3. Would we advise him to come to an understanding with the Persian Government, and in return for an adequate quid pro quo, to lend his co-operation. The engineer says he has been instructed to prepare complete scheme, and that Minister of Customs will find 2,000,000/. for it. He has now come to inform the Sheikh that all preliminaries have been arranged, hut that his effective co-operation is indispensable in order to insure success. The following is a description of the scheme:— Water sufficient to irrigate 144 square miles of land round Ahwaz is to be accumulated by means of a dam. Scope to he extended after lapse of twenty-four years' out of profits realized. Agricultural machinery to he imported by the Persian Government, who will cultivate the land themselves, employing where possible local labour. The Algewii tribe have cultivated the land in question for 150 years, and to resume it from them will be a difficult problem which only the Sheikh could tackle.

E. Morton, on Special Duty. 27th January 1905 .—Beached Muhammerah in evening. Elected to go on to Basrah on account of quarantine to avoid detention in quarantine camp as far as possible. Left for Basrah on board S.S. Lhasa about 10 p.m., reached Basrah about 12 midnight. 28th January 1905 .—At anchor off Basrah, quarantine regulations forbid landing. 29th January Returned to Muhammerah on board SS. Lhasa about 12 noon, went to quarantine station. MacDouall, British Consul, came alongside in his boat and gave me copy of telegram from Tehran (copy is attached marked A). I said I would see him about my mission when Income out of quarantine. MacDouall says Mr. Yan Boggen is at Ahwaz with Assistants collecting information. Told MacDouall the most necessary thing is to make arrangements for going about country when I get to Abwaz. MacDouall says Sheikh will assist. SOth January 1905 .—In quarantine. 31st January 1905 .—In quarantine; saw MacDouall for a few minutes in his boat alongside the quarantine station ; says river is unusually low owing to no rain which is badly wanted for crops. The river is usually at its lowest in August. The river at Muhammerah is affected by the tide up the Shatt-el-Arab. The rise (daily) is about 5 feet. Breadth of river opposite quarantine station I measured to be 850 feet. 1st February 1905 .—Left quarantine station and went to British Consul ate where MacDouall lives. Asked him to arrange interview with Sheikh (of Muhammerah Arabs) and get him to arrange to give escort in case of my having to tour about from Ahwaz. MacDouall arranged for an interview for to-morrow. MacDouall explains that as far as he understands Yan Boggen’s scheme it is for impounding water, when river is high, in a reservoir and drawing it off for irrigation purposes. He says he understands that the scheme is at present for an area of 12 miles square (=144 square miles) and that it is hoped that this area may be extended from profits on the initial scheme. 2nd February 1905 .—Showed MacDouall my instructions. He said that at interview with Sheikh he would explain that I am travelling in Persia and asked by Government to look into Van Boggen’s scheme in connection with the navigation of the Karun river and would ask Sheikh for his assistance and goodwill. The Sheikh’s nephew is Governor at Ahwaz. Mr. Lorimer, I.C.S., came in from Basrah and Baghdad yesterday evening in a boat. Engaged on Persian Gulf Gazetteer. Says his brother, Vice- Consul at Ahwaz, is expected in at Muhammerah before Lynch’s boat goes on2 to Ahwaz, but does not know whether he is going to Ahwaz or Bushire in the first instance. MacDouall and I went shortly after 2 p.m. to Sheikh’s private house which lies beyond his official residence—about 4-5 miles from Consulate. Saw I Sheikh who granted an interview, MacDouall interpreting. Sheikh gives four mounted men as escort and a letter to his nephew at Ahwaz (letter sealed has since been given me by Sheikh’s Private Secretary). Sheikh does not think much of Yan^ Boggen’s scheme ; thinks reservoir ^ will silt up as much silt comes down the river (Karun) when it is high. Sheikh thinks Van Roggen has much exaggerated the financial aspects of his scheme, and says Van Roggen hopes to irrigate three crops in a year which is more than he (the Sheikh) thinks can be done. MacDouall says Van Roggen models his dam on the Assouan Dam (on the Mle), which he and his party have visited and which they intend to see again after leaving Persia as they expect to do in April next. Lynch’s steamer (JBlosse Lynch) for Ahwaz came in to Muhammerah from Basrah as we were leaving Consulate for Sheikh’s palace and anchored just below Consulate at wharf. The Captain says he hopes to leave on Sunday for Ahwaz. A steamer of Lynch’s Company leaves Muhammerah once a fortnight for Ahwaz on Saturday or Sunday and takes one whole day and about five hours of second day on the journey. It anchors at night. It is expected that Mr. Wilson, the Agent of the Company, will come down from Basrah in time to go by the steamer Blosse Lynch on Sunday. Lorimer tells me that he was in the Poreign Office (at Simla) when my mission was first discussed and hence knows a good deal about it. I have told him in the course of conversation that I am going to Ahwaz to enquire into Van Roggen’s scheme, but nothing about any proposal for a loan. 3rd February 1905.—Took notes of books and pamphlets Hkely to be useful. Lorimer kindly gave me Part II of Persian Gazetteer Section V to see for list of these books and pamphlets. Sheikh of Muhammerah Arabs came to Consulate about 11 a.m. to return visit. MacDouall and 1 saw him, MacDouall interpreting. Sheikh expressed himself much averse to Van Roggen’s scheme as being too costly, and thinks that if such a scheme is carried out it, will lead to Russian interference in it. Van Roggen appears to have given Persian Government a very excessively roseate view of the scheme’s financial possibilities as being capable of producing several millions (probably in krans, a kran being worth about four annas) but it is not clear whether this large amount is on account of value of crops to be produced or on account of yearly income, but presumably the former. MacDouall told me on a former occasion the area the scheme is to irrigate at present is about 144 square miles, and from Punjab experience such an area is not likely to irrigate more than, say, 50.000 acres in a year (half the total area), which at Rs. 3 nett would give an income of Rs. 1,50,000 or £ 10 , 000 . The Sheikh says he has to pay the Persian Government a fixed assessment yearly in cash for the lands for which he is responsible and which includes the area to be dealt with in Van Roggen’s scheme, but that he (the Sheikh) takes his share of the produce of the land in kind. Van Roggen’s scheme would, therefore, necessarily materially affect the Sheikh’s position, and he is, therefore, a powerful factor to be considered in the case. The Sheikh told us briefly what are the usual proportions of produce taken as his share by the owner of the land. He is, practically speaking, the owner of the land or, perhaps rather, land lord, and pays a fixed yearly assessment to the Persian Government for the land be controls. This fixed assessment would, I presume, be increased if Van Roggen’s scheme brought in more land under cultivation than is the case at pres ent. The Sheikh would not, or could not, give any figures of produce of crops per acre. He is keenest on trying his scheme for irrigating by means of pumps (vide No. 25 of 2nd July 1904 from Lieutenant Lorimer to Resident3 in Persian Gulf enclosure to my instructions No. 180-E.A. of 14th January 1905) but has apparently no idea of what his scheme would cost nor of what area a pump could irrigate, in fact of anything about it, except that lie thinks it is the scheme most likely to succeed. During rest of interview I told him, through MacDouall, about irrigation works in India, as to what a scheme like the Chenab Canal is, and that in lndia revenue is paid on matured crops in cash, and similar information likely to interest him. 4th February —Mail leaves early to-morrow for India. Lieutenant Lorimer came in from Basrah in a boat and goes up to Ahwaz in the JBlosse Lynch which will probably not be detained pending arrival of Mr. Wilson, the Agent of Lynch’s steamers at Ahwaz. MacDouall says that Van Eoggen came to Muhammerah a short time ago to interview the Sheikh and sound him as to whether he would co-operate in arranging for the transfer of the land from the tribesmen. Sheikh gave an evasive answer and asked V an Boggen whether he was authorised to discuss the question, and on Van Eoggen saying “ No ” the Sheikh replied that “ in that case I cannot enter into the question with you.” W.

Grand Vizier has instructed Dutch Engineer to discuss Ahwaz Dam proposals fully but confidentially with him. I presume that at Ahwaz he could be put up either by Vice-Consul or by Lynch’s Agent, but you should caution him to be very careful as to what he says in the hearing of Mr. Ter Meulen.

Sir:- With reference to my letter of the 23rd instant, I have now the honour to draw your attention to the following extract of letter from this Company's Super intending Engineer dated Busrah 28th January 1905, re garding the proposed irrigation scheme on the river Karun:- •A copy of Mr. Tod's report upon the irriga- •tion scheme of the lands of Arabistan, lying be tween Ahwaz and Mohammerah, dated 14th January, 'has reached me, and I have considered it and •would comment as follows:- •1st. I do not think any of the schemes •proposed by Mr. Van Roggen would improve navi gation. •2nd. As far as I can judge from the con- •flicting accounts given by Mr. Van Roggen of his •intended work, the navigation of the lower Karun •would be seriously impeded, if not made alto gether he Under Secretary of State, Foreign Office.wsr* •altogether impossihle, for at least three months •of the year should his ideas be carried into ex ecution. This has been found to be the case 'in nearly all irrigation schemes of a similar •nature t and to overcome this difficulty it is •usual either to train the river, or, where pos sible, to make some arrangement whereby water 'may be admitted to it from an adjoining river or •lake which stands at a higher level. When I •discussed the matter with Sir William Willcocks •he told me that as regards the Nile he found •that even with a trained river, where the chan nels never vary, navigation practically ceases 'for several months in the year.' I would beg to point out that Colonel Picot has already had the honour of handing you Mr. Tod's de tailed report on the proposed irrigation scheme re ferred to above.

My Lord, THE statement telegram Confidential.) Tehran, December 30, 1904. Netlierland Minister referred, in conversation with me to-day, to the made by him to Mr. Grant Duff and reported to your Lordship in his No. 3 of the 19th October respecting the Karun irrigation scheme. He mentioned to me that Herr van Roggen was desirous of obtaining a concession for the construction of the Ahwaz dam from the Persian Government, the working of which he might possibly transfer to an international Syndicate, in return, so I gathered, for the assignment of certain shares in it to himself, and asked if I thought His Majesty’s Government would oppose any scheme for irrigation works in South-western Persia which wns not under exclusively English control. I said that I should not be prepared to go quite so far as that, but that we should certainly not view with favour the formation of a foreign Syndicate, under cover of which foreign Powers having political aims inconsistent with our interests might conceivably acquire, whether by purchase or shares or otherwise, a political footing and influence in Arabistan. My impression, however, was that the Persian Government would be reluctant to give the concession to any foreign capitalists, and would prefer to construct the dam itself. M. Knobel observed that it had not the funds requisite for the purpose, and would therefore have to borrow them abroad, which would be a difficult business. I expressed my concurrence with this view, and implied, without saying it in so many words, that I rather doubted the practicability, under present conditions, of the project. My Dutch colleague said he could not recommend to his Government the encouragement of Herr van Roggen’s ideas, as the lack of all order and justice in Persia would make it difficult for any concession of the kind to pay in the hands of a private Company, in the face of the obstruction and blackmailing tendencies of the local Chiefs and authorities, whose assistance would be essential to its success. I do not think he had got any inkling of the • overtures made to us by the Grand Vizier or was trying to sound me about them. It appears to me, however, ) possible that when his Highness told me, as reported in my despatch No. 234 of yesterday’s date, that if we refused him the loan he might procure it in other quarters, though not necessarily from Russia, his Highness had in his mind some suggestions from Herr van Roggen of obtaining it through a Dutch or Belgian Syndicate in return for a participation by the latter in its profits, and that these suggestions had been submitted to the Netherland Minister, who wished, before expressing an opinion on their feasibility, to ascertain what view we should take of them. I have, &amp;c. (Signed) ARTHUR H. HARDINGE. [1822 d —9]opy. REPORT 0 T ' T THE SCHEME J-OR THE IRRIGATION OF THE LANDS OF ARAB 1ST AN TYING BETWEEN AH^A7 AND MOHAMMERAf On the 9th Dacemher last, a Mr. V m Roygan and two other Di tch Engineere arrived at Ahwaz. They 14th January 1905. have been deputed by the Persian Government to pre pare plane ana estimates for the erection of a dam across the Karun River. Which dam is intended to stern the waters of the river in order that they may be diverted by means of artificial channels and used for the purposes of the irrigation of the land between Ahvaz ana Mohammerah. It has been decided that the m et suitable place to erect such a dam is at a point midway between the villages ol Air vaz and Eundar-Nasseri. This portion of the river Is commonly known as ’•the rapids' and under ordinary circumstances the navigation cf this Reach is impossible. About seven hundred years ago there was a dam which ran across the river at exactly the same place as the Dutch Engineers intend to erect the new one. To thisthis day thara still remain some of the masonry and sluice gates which formed part of the old dam. The Dutch Engineers are at present busily en gaged taking measurements and levels to enable them to prepare plans ana estimates. They expect that it will take about 4 or 5 months to prepare these plane. After the completion of which the Engineers are to proceed to Tehran ana lay their plans before the Per sian Government. Should the plans ana estimates be approved of ana the money forthcoming the works will be proceeded with. This however will take a con eiderable time and it is impossible that any works can be started for, at least, nine months from this date. Nine months is the soonest that it can possibly be started in and it is more than probable that it will be two years before the plans are sanctioned by the Persian Government and the works started. The latter is the general opinion at Ahwaz and also the opinion of the Engineers themselves. It is an undeniable fact that, should the i tion scheme be a success, the produce of the coun-country proposed to be irrigated will be enormous* When, however, one goes into the question of the nav igation of the river below the dam several problems crop up which can only be answered by one who is veiy well versed in the Art of Navigation and the Science of Irrigation. I, an amateur, in such matters, can only hope to lay the bare facts before you. The facts are these, viz:- l.That for six months in the year all the wa ter that is in the River Karun is barely sufficient for the Navigation to be carried on with any degree of certainty. 2* That the greater part of the bed of the river is sandy soil therefore the channels are continually al tering and the courses to be steered by the steam ers have frequently to be changed. 3. That the average current of the river is about two Knots per hour in low water and four to five Knots in high water. 4. That the distance from Ahwaz to NQharamerah byby water is about 120 miles and by land (direct) from 60 to 70 miles, 5. That the river is tidal for 20 miles up from Mohammerah. 6. That Ahwaz is about 220 feet above the level of the sea, With these facts before me I presume to make the following remarks which at present time can only be founded on presumption. My reason for saying that they can only be found ed on presumption is that Mr. Van Roggan and his as sistants are without exception the greatest prevar- 1 icators I have ever met in my life anu it is impos- \ e Bible to ascertain from them their intention. The various stories told to myself and others are so con flicting that it is impossible to draw any conclusion from them. When asked, what effect the dam would have on navigation of the Lower Karun, Mr. Van Roggan inform ed us that it would improve navigation. His explan ation0 explanation of this was that the dam will be fitted with sluice gates through which the water will rush at a greater speed than the ordinary pace of the ri ver, and that this being the case the water would cut for itself a deep channel in which it would flow down the river and not spread over such a large area as it does at present. Mr. Van Roggan hold?, that the channels will both be deepened and be made per manent, which is not the case at present. The chan nels are continually altering. I am of opinion that in this Mr. Van Roggan is wrong and, although willing to admit that what he says as to the increased pace of the current deepening the channel is correct, I cannot accept the theory that wuch a channel will be made for more than six miles down the river from the dam, especially when the fact that the river only falls 220 feet in the course of 120 miles it taken into consideration. The increased pace of the cur rent will I think only last for a few miles. The fall in the river bed is not sufficient to allow ofsuch increased pace being kept up The above was the first of FT. Van Roggan's stories and was the one told by him to myself. The story he told the Sheikh Khuzzal was that he intended to dam the river, with,as it were, a port able dam, ana only take water out during the months when it is in flood. He said he intended to build a large reservoir which ie to be filled during these months and from which reservoir, he will run such channels through the country as are necessary for irrigation. If he adopts this plan the expense will be enormous and the loss of water by evaporation and leakage will be very great, especially if he stores the water in the reservoir for any length of time. I may mention that the Sheikh Khuzzal, although delighted at the idea of the irrigation of the lands around Ahwaz, has intimated to the Dutch Engineers that no water whatever must be taken out of the ri ver in the low season or at any time when the tak ing of such water ’would interfere with the irrigation of the large Date Gardens which belong to him at Mohammerah.s Mohammerah. Not contented with giving the Sheikh Khuzzal a different story of hie intention from that which he gave to myself, Mr* Van Roggan has gone to the extent of discussing with others the expanse and advisabil ity of running a light railway from here to Moham- merah and this in itself tends to show that he himself is not at all certain whether the damming of the Kar un might not damn the navigation. Otherwise such an idea would never come into his head, as the capital required for such an enterprise would he very great and it is very questionable whether the profit would justify the outlay. Finally and in conclusion I am of opinion that, if any water whatever is taken from the Karun River during the low season, navigation will become prac tically impossible and the only way to arrive at the true intention of the Dutch Mission will be to bring pressure to bear on the Persian Government and forcethem to produce copies of all plans before giving their sanction to the carrying out of any works at Ahwaz for the purpose of irrigation. In this way alone will it be possible to get at the truth. Ahwaz, 14th January 1905. (Signed) Arthur W.M. Tod.

CONFIDENTIAL. No. 1. [February 4.] Section 5. Sir A. Hardinge to the Marquess of Lansdowne.—(Received February 4, 1905.) (No. 234.) My Lord, Tehran, December 29, 1904. I INFORMED the Grand Vizier, in the course of a long- conversation which 1 had with him to-da}- on the subject of the Karim irrigation scheme, that your Lordship had intimated to me that you were disposed to assist financially in it, provided that the Irrigation Officer who was being sent to Ahwa'z at the joint expense of the British and Indian Governments reported that the proposed dam would not, by diminishing the water supply in the Lower Karun, impede its navigation and thus injure British trade. ^ His Highness said that what was proposed was to store the water in certain reservoirs, and then let them out into the irrigation canals only when the Karun was high in the spring, and he expressed himself as confident that the total normal volume of water in the river would not be diminished in such a way as to hinder navigation. He suggested that, even if it did, the objection I had mentioned might be met in otner ways, i.e., by deepening the river bed, or by building a tramway line for the transport of goods from Mohammerah to Ahwaz ; but I pointed out that this latter, solution would not help traders, as a more expensive mode of land transport would not compensate tor the diminution of the water facilities now enjoyed by them. The Ain-ed-Dowleh went on to observe that the construction of the dam was an absolute necessity for Persia; that if w T e declined to lend the money for it he would have to apply for it elsewhere, aiidHTThe work was undertaken with the help of others the British Legation would not be able to complain, as I had done with respect to Persia’s action in connection with the first Russian Loan. I thanked his Highness for the frankness of this statement, and said I hoped he would forgive me if I observed with equal frankness that should the Persian Government 1 contract a further Russian Loan for an object in Southern Persia, which we considered injurious to our commercial interests, such action could only be regarded by^ us as deliberately inimical, and would convert our present friendly attitude towards it imo ! something very different. . The Grand Vizier replied that he might not necessarily apply to Russia for the money. I said that no other country but Russia or England would, especially in face ot the conditions of the Russian Loan contracts, provide him with a loan. Except Turkey, whose political interests in Asia were identified, like ours, with the maintenance or the independence of Persia, there was no Government which regarded her preservation as an object of importance, and none, certainly, in my opinion, which would make pomieal loans or incur any risks and sacrifices for her benefit. His Highness asked then what I thought his course ought to be it we absolutely refused to help him even after it had been demonstrated that his scheme would not injure the river or our commerce. I replied that we had not said that we should do so, and that the dispatch of an Indian Irrigation Officer to the Karun was an earnest our friendly interest in the enterprise. He promised to order M. Fans, wnen this o mu arrived, to instruct Herr van Roggen, who was now 7 at Ahwaz with two fresh European engineers for the purpose of preparing a further report on it, to discuss t ic w o e project with him, and he agreed with me in thinking it advisable i.or the piesen t a such discussions between them should, in view of the presence oy a Russian konsu ar Agent of Dutch nationality on the Karun, be of a strictly confidential natuie. ^ We then proceeded to the question of Seistan, and I delivered the message vvi which your Lordship charged me at our last interview at Lansdowne House, explaining very fully your reasons for regarding the deposition of the Plashmat-ul-Mu as a measure of which we had a right to complain. His Highness took exception to my describing the Hashmat and his family as the Hereditary Governors of feeistan, and said that the district anciently ruled by them was that of Kain, to which Seis an pioper hah been added by Nasr-ed-Din Shah, its administration having formerly been vested m a bodv of local Sirdars. On my observing that the present Chief J^ aiI j had not ,je ® n deposed, although, unlike the Hashmat, he had disregarded the Royal summons to Tehran, the Ain-ed-Dowleh replied that I was mistaken. In spite of the intercession [1822 d—5]2 . T ,• I,;*-Koknif iVip Shflukat-ul-Mulk had been told that, whether &gt;- -?»w» .» r i •»«.« Biriand after travelling a few stages, on the strength of a certificate hy the official sneSly sent there to enforce compliance with this order, that the journey would mean his certain death, the Government had now been taken from him and transferred to one of S his brothers L a temporary deputy. The Asaf-ed-Dowleh, Governor-General of Khorassan had proposed that the latter should he definitely appointed Governor but thePerffian Government had replied that he must first come to the capital and satisfy them as to his fitness for the post. The Government’s ooject was to institute a more efficient administration throughout the outlying border provinces by which I understood the Grand Vizier to mean that it aimed at a greater centralization and at the gradual suppression of the tribal Chiefs, such as those who, m Kuchan, Birjand and o her districts of Khorassan still wield a kind of feudal authority I said I quite admitted that many of these Chiefs were drunkards, opium smokers, and m other respects by no meanT ideal rulers, hut with all their faults-and I was not blind to those ot the Hashmat-ul-Mulk—they often kept their districts, which were their homes and with whkb all their personal interests were hound up, not to speak of the greater local knowledge and experience which they possessed, m better order than could be done by a strange official from Tehran, who would regard his appointment to a post such as Seistan as a hateful exile, and whose only object would be to make as much money m as short a time as possible out of it. If his Highness aimed at placing in Seistan a more enlifhtened official than the Hashmat, or one more in touch with the views of the Persian Court, he could attain this end without making any radical change m the Local Govern- ment by appointing a really efficient Karguzar. , We did not wish to dictate to the Persian Government m matters ot internal administration, but the tranquillity of Seistan was a matter of great importance to that of the Afghan border and of our own, and if, in spite of our earnest representations, chancres were made which we considered detrimental to that tranquillity, we might have to demand other securities for its maintenance. I pointed out that the Russian Government had been given such a security on the Trans-Caspian frontier m the form of the permanent Perso-Russian Commission at Gumbadi Kaboos, and remarked that, while 1 was not authorized to put forward a demand for a similar concession to ourselves in Seistan, your Lordship had mentioned it to me as one which might perhaps m certain contingencies have to be considered. t -r j c i His Highness said that, before giving me, for transmission to your Lordship, a tinal answer to your message, he must have a conversation with the Ala-es-Sultaneh, with whom he had not yet had leisure to discuss these matters fully. He reminded me, however, that the Persian Government, though they had found it necessary to detain the Hashmat-ul-Mulk here, had not yet deprived him of his Government, which was still being carried on in his name by'his son. They were elaborating certain proposals for the future administration of Seistan, which they believed would he advantageous to British interests and acceptable to His Majesty’s Government. His Highness did not describe these proposals, but intimated that he would do so on a subsequent occasion. He assured me, however, very emphatically that his attitude towards Seistan affairs was not due to any Russian inspiration, and I believe personally, from what I knovv of him, that he is far from wishing to encourage Russian aims on the eastern frontier. His distrust of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk seems to be due partly to reports, not of Russian agents, but of Persian officials who are that Chief’s personal enemies and have endeavoured to injure him by reporting him as unduly friendly to Britishjnterests^ and partly from an idea that a creature of his own will be a more reliable Ruler of Seistan from his own point of view than a member of the local ruling family.

His Lordship is not aware that any instruction has been issued forbidding the engineer to make open use of instruments, when necessary.

But this need not preclude the use of instru ments; Under Secretary of State, India Office.Instruments; it Is not desired to conceal the fact that he will be engaged in a survey of the Karun river, nor, in the circumstances, would it be possible to do so, and, as stated in my letter of November 3rd, it is proposed to bring his mission to the knowledge of the Persian Government. Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that all that His Maj esty's Government require is an expert opinion as to (1) whether and to what extent the scheme would affect the navigation of the Karun and (2) whether it contains the elements of success. An elaborate survey hardly seems necessary in order to obtain a preliminary report on these two points, while without such a report it is impossible for His Majesty's Government to decide what policy to pursue and whether or not to encourage the project. I am therefore to suggest, for the consideration of the Secretary of State for India whether the Govern ment of India should not again be invited to send an engineer to the Karun to make a survey on the lines in dicated in Mr. Brodrick's telegram to the Viceroy of' 1904. r. or SIMLA. -Vi; FOEEIGr]Sr DEPARTMENT.

To The Right Hon’ble St. JOHN BRODRICK, His Majesty's Secretary of State for India. Simla, the 10th November 1904. Sir, We have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your Secret despatch No. 38, dated the 26th August 19(H, regarding a proposed loan to the Persian Government for the purpose, and on the security, of a scheme for the irriga tion of Arabistan. 2. The matter is one which had already engaged our attention, and we ( 1 ) From Lieutenant Lorimer, No. 25 , dated the LOW have the honour to forward COpiCS 2nd July 1904. . . a of the marginally noted papers on the ( 2 ) Memorandum on the Fivers or Arabistan by , . , ° ^ A x Major E. B. Burton. SUDject. 3. In our telegram of the 4th September, we suggested the deputation of an expert from India to examine the potentialities of irrigation in this region. We have not yet received a final expression of your views on this proposal, which we trust will meet with your approval. Pending such an examination as we contemplate, we feel that any opinion which we may express on the subject must necessarily be of a tentative character. So far, however, as we can at present judge, we incline to believe that the scheme is one which is deserving of the support both of His Majesty’s Government and of the Government of India, and in which we should be prepared to lend financial assistance. 4. We are equally unable to discuss in detail the terms on which our support should be lent, until we are in a position to appreciate more clearly the probable scope of the undertaking. There are certain points, however, which may be noticed at the present stage. In his despatch No. 133, dated the 19th July 1904, Sir Arthur Hardinge reported Mons. Naus’ sugges tion that the intended loan should be secured both on the revenues accruing from the projected works and on the domains fertilised thereby, and that the transaction should also include an undertaking by the Persian Govern ment that all restrictions on the export of grain from the Karun valley ♦Forwarded by the Minister with his despatch should henceforth be abolished. In his No. 44 , dated the 20th August 1904 (copy enclosed). note* of the 19th August, hoWCVCr, W6 observe that Mons. Naus makes mention of the hypothecation of the crops only, and not of the lands, and, further, that no reference is made to the removal of embargos on the exportation of corn. We consider these points to be important, and would lay stress on the adoption of the terms as stated in Sir Arthur Hardinge’s despatch of the 19th July.5. We are in full agreement witli the view stated by Lord Curzon in his Minute of the J st August 1904 that, in considering any scheme of irrigation, we must not lose sight of the possibility that the diminution^ of water caused thereby may render further navigation of the Larun impossible. Major Burton in his memorandum has expressed the opinion that this result must follow if the barrage at Ahwaz he reconstructed. Though we should not necessarily regard the prospect of this contingency as precluding us from encouraging projects of the kind contemplated, we hold that it fully justifies our claiming that the irrigation schemes should be worked on lines approved by us, and that simultaneously with the conclusion of arrangements for their execution we should receive a formal concession of the right to substitute for the thoroughfare which the Karun now provides such roads, or railways, with suitable maritime termini, as may be requisite for the purposes of our commercial interests in Arabistan. A further concession which might well be demanded is that we should he entitled to a full voice in any further schemes for the development of Arabistan by irrigation from the other rivers of the province besides the Karun, such as the Kerkha, Shaur, Diz, or Jerrahi Rivers; and that, should it be necessary to obtain financial assistance from non-Persian sources, the British Government or British firms should have the preference. Por the grant of such under takings there is obviously full justification. The opening of the Karun to navigation was obtained through British influence. The trade which now passes by its waters is practically entirely British. The hulk of the traffic is in the hands of the British firm of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. We have also taken the principal part in the development of the land routes by which the merchandise thus imported is subsequently distributed. The road from Ahwaz to Ispahan was built by a British firm, and a British company is now arranging to open up another line of communication to the north by virtue of a concession which they hold from the Shah’s Government. 6. Apart from the considerations to which we have just referred, there are other factors which give us a special position. The proposals which have been referred to us purport, we understand, to emanate from the Central Govern ment at Tehran. Similar projects, however, as will be seen from Lieutenant . „ , „ , Lorimer’s letter,* have been considered by Enclosure No. i. ^ ^ the Sheikh of Mohammerah. This Chief- tain is entitled to full consideration in connection with the scheme, which could not be executed without his consent—a consent which there would doubtless he no difficulty in persuading him to withhold, should there be any doubt as to the advantage to himself or to us. The question of occupancy and pro prietary rights in the soil of Arabistan formed the subject of discussion between the Sheikh and the Shah in 1902, and the reconciliation of the interests of the local tribes and of the Government at Tehran is a matter which may cause some difficulty in connection with the proposed undertaking. 7. A further point which requires consideration is that of the manner in which the loan should be disbursed. We should have little confidence in the allotment of the loan to the purpose for which it is intended if the money actually passed through the hands of any Persian official, and we consider that the only practical way of securing our object is that a suitable agreement be made with some reliable firm of contractors, and that the money should be paid direct to the firm in adjustment of their accounts. This, we infer from Mons. Naus’s note of the 19th August, would be acceptable to the Persian Government. 8. We assume that His Majesty’s Government will he prepared to share equally with the Indian Government the liability on account of the capital and interest on the loan, and our agreement to provide a portion of the funds is subject to that condition. Whether or not it should form a part of the loan of £500,000 which has formed the subject of negotiation between the British and Persian Governments during the past eighteen months, and of which a sum of £300,000 has already been advanced, does not appear to us to be a matter of great importance. We think, however, that, as the purpose for which theloan is to be made is different, and as the security on which it win + j is distmct, it will be preferable that the present advance sho^d terfearfed ; S 4o S r atetranSaCtl0n£r0mthat reIatiDS toth6loan required for g S enerd We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient, humble servants, rtCU.List of Enclosures in Secret Despatch No. 210 (External), dated the 10th November 1904, from the Government of India in the Foreign Department, to His Majesty’s Secretary of State for India.

From— Lieutenant Lorimer, His Britannic Majesty’s Vice-Consul for Arabistan, Tc— Major P. Z. Coz, C.I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf. I have the honour to recur to a question raised in my No. 17, dated 21st June 1901, namely, the relations of the British Government and the Sheikh of Mohammerah. The present form in which the subject invites attention is that of financial assistance. 1 learned first that the Sheikh had been making obscure references through confidential employes of Messrs. Lynch to two or three schemes for the further ance of which he would be glad to receive aid from our Government. These schemes are :— (1) the irrigation of part of Arabistan by 5 or 6 steam pump baro-es placed on the Karun below Ahwaz; (2) the construction of irrigation works on the rapids at Ahwaz on the site of the old “ Band”; (3) the purchase of certain land from the Nizam-us-Sultaneh. Shortly afterwards he called on me and I was able to talk of the first scheme which is public knowledge, and to approach the subject of the second. The third I did not care to introduce. The Sheikh is an impossible man to get any expression of opinion from, when Haji Bais, his counsellor, is not present. He ventured however to commit himself so far as to give me to understand that under certain circumstances he would not be averse to receiving financial help from the British Government in connection with the first and second schemes. Later I had a private interview with Baji Rais-ut-Tujar on the same subject. He put the matter in this form, that I should on my own account invite the opinion of Government on the matter as though the conception were entirely my own and had not emanated from or^ been discussed with the Sheikh. If the answer were favourable, he Haji Bais, would undertake to work the Sheikh into a favourable frame of mind. I shall proceed to give some explanation of the schemes. No. 1. The Sheikh has for some time it appears entertained this notion. How it was suggested to his mind I do not know.minhrti . A certain Mr. Blunsum of the Basra Trading Company has been her, prospecting for the last six weeks.

He then interviewed the Sheikh and has been ^tho Mr Blunsum would of course like to secure the working of the scheme if feasible for his own Company but I am sure the Sheikh would not part wkb its control. In this case Mr. Blunsum says that his firm would bo 0 ™,! The Sheikh is I believe prepared to spend £ 15,000 or £ 20,000 on this scheme. If the expense proved greater I understand him to implv that he would accept our help. Personally I believe that he would do so ff t tere proposed m any case. 1 11 ' veic The practicability of the scheme remains to be proved. The working expenses, more particularly the supply of coal, will run into large figuTes and the pumps, etc, will require renewal from time to time. ngmes, and No. II.

(I do not include the Hindian, which I have not seen : it would appear to he much like the Jerrahi, though smaller.) The chief rivers of Arahistan are the Karkhah, Karun, and .Terrain, which from the points of their entering the alluvial plains of those regions, possess in common certain similar characteristics. F On emerging from the hills, they flow little below the level of the plain • but as they progress, they cut deeper into the alluvial soil, till they approach the land of more recent formation, which is depressed to their level and allows ot their water being dispersed in canals in every direction. The volume of water of these rivers diminishes rapidly as the snow dis appears rom the higher mountains m May and June : and, according as the ime of the winter rams is advanced or retarded, they attain their lowest level from October to January. Their volume is then usually maintained by the rains ot spring, till again replenished by the mehing of the winter snow. ihese rivers have accordingly been utilised for purposes of irrigation in conformity with the above conditions.

It may be noted that the whole of the lands of Arabistan irrigable by these nvers, with the exception of the tract between Dizful and the Karkhah and the Mian-do-Ab, is m the occupation of Arab tribes, who are now, or will ofHawiz^and^th^BZ Taruf. 156 ° f Moharamerah ’ P attia S “Me those Kasm itself is mainly owned by Persians; and the land west of Ahwaz to the Shaour and karkhah belongs to Kizam-es-Sultaneh, but is unsafe and nnmliabited. _ Karkhah River.—The, Karkhah emerges from the mountains of Luristan being formed of the united streams of the Saidmarra and Kash^an Rivers • ^ ici, jommg at^ * * * , debouch from the opposing extremities of the Aabir Jxuli and Direkwand mountains by the deep gorge of Pul-i-Tang. On entering Arabistan, it is a broad and hurrying stream of whitish vater, w ich at Asiran-i-Karkhah flows in sevral arms divided by low islands. Reing little below the level of the adjacent country, it is immediately available tor irrigation ; and a number of canals diverge from its left bank and water the lands ot the Sagwand Lurs and of the tribe of Kerim Khan, west of Dizful. Plowing south, it passes two miles west of Susa, and maintains the same direction to where, 20 miles north-west of Ahwaz, it turns sharply to the south-west, and, traversing the Dani Taruf Arabs, is dispersed in the canals and marshes of Hawizeh. It then enters the Tigris above Dasrah in one consider able arm only. . Karkhah is crossed by shifting and dangerous fords at Pa-i-Pul, Asiran-i-Karkhah, and near Susa. Its bed is usually broad, islands and banks in midstream are frequent; and till it approaches the latitude of Band-i-Kir, it does not cut deeply into the alluvial soil. Hs hanks throughout are wooded with tamarisk jungle and small trees, and in places lined with thick brakes of cane and willow. The lion and fallow eer are practically extinct, but wild boars, hyaenas, and small game abound; and considerable herds of gazelles frequent the plains on both banks of the river. Near Susa are the remains of great canals, down which probably were lansported from the mountains of Luristan the vast stone columns of the oassaman palace of Susa. Above the point where it turns towards Hawizeh, more canals diverge, and here the Shaour River is adjacent. At or below this point, the Karkhah con ( be diverted bodily to the Karun, into which it flowed some miles south or Ahwaz in former times. / r1 9 From wliat I beard of Hawizeb, the counfry there is irrigated in the same manner as that at Fellahieh, the river being dispersed into mnumerahle canals, a diminished stream only entering the Tigris. The volume of the Karkliah is, however, greater than that of the Jerraln ; the country is reported to be very populous, and the tribes powerful and well ct r m ftd a Prom Pa-i-Pul to the Tigris junction the Karkhah flows through alluvial plains, almost the whole of which are capable of irrigation. The country throughout is coverd with the remains of habitations and canals but is now almost desert, except where the tribes of Bani Taruf and Hawizeh on the verge of the Turkish and Persian frontiers, are exempt from the exactions of both Governments, and enjoy some degree of prosperity. Shaour River .—of the Karkhah and intersecting the space between it and the river of Dizful, winds the sluggish stream of the Shaour, which rises in springs near Asiran-i-Karkhuh. Be Morgan is of opinion that it was originally a canal, and that its waters are now^ derived from the Karkhah by a subterranean channel, his opinion being fortified by the fact of the river passing through a range, or ridge, of low hills by a manifestly artificial cutting on its course to the Ab-i-Diz. The Shaour is of canal like appearance, its course is winding; its width of 20 to 30 yards is fairly uniformly maintained. Its stream is sluggish, and its hanks and bed solt and of alluvial soil, and it can he forded at frequent intervals. The Shaour is almost throughout lined with low tamarisk jungle, and in its hmlier reaches with thorn trees; its banks abound with wild hoars, by sen as, and small game. Washing the western base of the mounds of Susa, it preserves a southerly course a few miles from the Karkhah to above the point where that stream turns towards Hawizeh; it then flows east to the Ab-i-Diz, which it enters above Band-i-Kir, Throughout its course a number of canals diverge from it, many of ancient, some of modern, construction, and but few containing water, or in use. Except where it passes through ridges or rising ground, the Shaour is little below the surface of the soil. Ab-i-Diz .—The river of Dizful, as it passes that town, is swift, of no great depth, and obstructed by rocks. Below Dizful its bed is broad and shingly, the stream flowing in several arms. The adjacent country is depressed to its level, and small canals leave both hanks. East of Susa a large tract on the left hank is heavily irrigated. As the Ab-i-Diz approaches the Karun, its banks contain some forest: its lower reaches deepen and are susceptible of navigation ; it has recently been ascended by the stern wheel steamer “ Shushan ”, drawing 2^ feet of water, for some miles; but it is throughout its course swilter, shallower, and more obstructed by rocks than the greater stream, and lends itself less to purposes of extensive irrigation than any of the other rivers of Arabistan. Karun River .—The Karun River, as it approaches Shuster, loses the characteristics of a mountain stream; and, on its passing the plain of Akili, north of the city, the conformation of the ground first admits of its being used for irrigation. At and below Shuster the bed of the river is broad and stony, and the current swift. It is sufficiently shallow to be fordable 1-|- miles below the town. Eurther down stream, it gradually deepens and becomes navigable, rocks and stones disappearing from its bed as it cuts its way through the alluvial soil. The “ Shushan ” has, I think, ascended it to within 12 miles of Shuster. The hanks of the river are practically devoid of trees till it approaches the Ab-i-Diz at Band-i-Kir, where there is some scrub jungle; from there again they are bare and desolate till the river reaches the palm groves of Mohammerah. At Band-i-Kir the Karnn is reinforced by the water of the Ab-i-Gargar, and the Shaour and Diz Rivers, and moves with diminished speed, hut accumu- f10 lated weight. Tlie reach of the river between that point and Ahwaz is deep and slow, and the water is some distance below the level of the banks. For some way below Nasiri, the navigation is intricate and dangerous, with shoals and rocks, during the period of low water. The navigable channel is constantly shifting, gradually, when the water maintains a constant level; suddenly, during and after floods. The banks are deeply cut till the river approaches the Mohammerah dis trict, where the land of more recent formation gradually falls to the level to which the river is raised by the rising tide. The main canals diverge from the Karun at Shuster and Ahwaz : there are however others at intermediate points; all are dry and disused till, in the latitude of Fellahieh, the Shakeh and Salmaneh canals are filled with a small stream at high tide. The Shuster dam would not appear to have served any large area of land outside of the Mian-do-Ab, a few underground kanats only leaving the right bank of the river above the bridge. On the left bank the plain of Akili, which I have not visited, w T as, I believe, formerly irrigated by the Karum: but is not so now, or only in a minor degree, though it retains some prosperity and has many villages. From Shuster to Ahwaz the country to the east of the Ab-i-Gargar and Karun would appear to be too elevated for irrigation from those rivers. At Ahwaz large canals diverge from both banks. The rebuilding and raising of the Ahwaz dam might convey the water of the river to the lands higher up its right bank, which, however, would be more accessible to that of the Shaour and Diz liivers. By the Ahwaz dam a great portion of the water of the Karun would be diverted to the east and west. It is possible that the re opening of the Shuster irrigation wnrks alone would not seriously affect the navigability of the river, except in the d ryes t season; but undoubtedly the rebuilding of the barrage at Ahwaz would close it as a navigable stream. Ab-i-Gargar .—The Ab-i-Gargar some miles below Shuster winds through a valley, in places a mile wide, which is depressed 30 to 40 feet below the level of the surrounding country: above and below this, it flows through arti ficial cuttings. As the valley closes to the south, the river emerges through a narrow gorge, whose cliffs for some miles above Band-i-Kir are lined with ruins. The channel is from 20 to 40 yards wide, shallow and obstructed with roots of trees. The forest has entirely disappeared from its banks, and the wood for the steamer “ Shushan” is brought from the Ab-i-Diz. The stream, in its present depleted state, is difficult to navigate, being in parts less than three feet deep. The ruins of the dam at Band-i-Kir, which show in the cliffs to either side to a height of 40 feet, obstruct the stream, leaving a passage of a few yards only to either side. The repair of the Shuster dam would probably raise the water to its former depth, and enable the steamer to approach nearer to Shuster. The Ab-i-Gargar is of little importance for irrigation, a few adjacent low- lying lands only being accessible to its water. Jerrahi Hirer .—The Jerrahi Biver, flowing in a north-west direction and skirting the Kuhgelu mountains, enters the plain of Bam Hormuz, and, circling abruptly to the east and south, pierces through intricate gorges, a low rocky range 15 miles south of the town. In the Bam Hormuz plain it receives the water of the Bud-i-Zara, its last accession in its course to the sea. Emerging from a mass of tangled ravines in a rapid stream, some 80 yards broad, the river reaches Cham Sabeh, and, describing wide curves, debouches at once into the alluvial plain of Arabistan. It flows south, pursuing ^ a winding course, to within 8 miles of Mashur; and then turning west is, after a further course of some 20 miles, dispersed in every direction by the innumerable canals of Fellahieh.West of Fellahieh its surplus water forms a large marsh, which is traversed by the Shakeh caual, by which a small stream mingles with the Karun. The residue that emerges from the groves of Tellahieh flows south to the sea as the Khor Dorak, up which sea-going buggalows ascend. The Jerrahi to near Halfabad is a broad and rapid stream, flowing between tamarisk covered banks of no great elevation, hiom Ualfabad it assumes the appearance of a windingly canal some 40 yards wide with banks 15 feet, high; and to that point it is ascended by boats drawing from two-half to three feet of water. Receiving no affluents, its stream continually diminishes in volume. It is lined at intervals of a few miles with the villages and camps of the Chaab Arabs. The country is bare of trees, and the crops dependent entirely on rain. The Jerrahi can be forded east of Cham Sabeh throughout the year, and below there at numerous points in the dry season. At Cham Sabeh, where the river quits the hills, are the remains of large canals leaving its right bank, and mounds faintly showing the tracing of a square fort and many buildings. Here the river could be directed over the immense plains lying to the east and west towards the Hindian and Karun Rivers. To instance the facility with which these rivers will lend themselves to a scheme of irrigation, embracing the whole country from the Karkhah to the Hindian, it may be noted that by an inundation the Karkhah has been known to unite with the Shaour River, and flow into the Ab-i-Diz; and that the water of the Karun can be forced by a spring tide into the marsh which receives the surplus of the Jerrahi, west of Pellahieh. The whole of the level plains from Hawizeh to the Hindian stream may be allowed to have been formed within historical times. Assuming that the land advances at the mouth of the Shat-el-Arab three miles in one hundred years, and allowing a lesser rate of growth for the deltas of the smaller rivers to the east of the Karun at the period of the voyage of Nearchus, the northern shore of the marshes and tidal flats into which the six rivers from the Euphrates to the Hindian then flowed would have stretched from the vicinity of Basrah to 40 miles south of Ahwaz, and thence south east to the south of Behbahan. The whole of that region is of equal elevation, and the water of the various rivers could be carried in canals to all the intermediate lands. Erom what Mons. Ter Meulen told me, it is evident that these irrigation schemes have been maturing for some time. The Dutchman, von Roggan, is a man of experience in his particular line, he has travelled in Java and Sumatra. While examining the works at Shuster, he had a severe fall from a mule, and unfortunately only injured his right arm. He used his enforced leisure to read up the numerous works on Arabistan in Mons. De Morgan’s library at Susa. Whatever range his ideas had before, they were thus undoubtedly enlarged : and he unfortunately saw, by visiting the banks of the Karkhah, that the Shuster and Ahwaz dams need be but a part of the scheme for the regeneration of this part of Persia by water. It is evident that, except in so far as a decaying Government, corrupt offiicials, and a disturbed country may supply obstacles, there is no reason what* ever why the irrigation works of Arabistan should not be extended beyond the area of former times, and these regions, now desert, again support an immense population. The carrying out of the scheme in its entirety would close the Karun to steamers, but the vanishing of that carrying trade would be scarcely noticed in the change that would be effected in this part of Persia. Tramways, railways, and foreigners would effectually obliterate the present state of affairs, political and physical, and the roads to the north automatically open. E. B.

I have the honour to transmit herewith, with reference to my despatch No. 149 of the 15th instant to the Marquess of Lansdowne, a copy of an un official letter received by me from Mons. Naus, on the subiect of the completion of the advance of .April 1903. r . . His Excellency has now informed me that he is authorised by the Grand \izier to apply lor the completion of the advance, and that the draft agreement enclosed in my despatch to the Marquess of Lansdowne, No. 133 of the 19th ultimo, has received His Highness’s assent. I have replied that, as there appeared to be some misconception in Lord Lansdowne’s mind as to the extent to which the securities, other than that of the Customs of the South, were exhausted for the purposes of the new advance, I had thought it necessarv to explain their position and amount as clearly as possible to His Majesty’s Government and to the Government of India, and that I must await their replies before proceeding any further. If he were ready to insert a provision that the interest on the £100,000 completing the advance should be paid exclusively out of the Southern Customs, I thought we could come to terms at once. Mons. Naus said that he had proposed this to the Ain-ed-Dowleh, but that the latter and the Shah, who did not understand these financial transactions, were averse to pledging any of their Customs further and could not be made to see that an extension of an advance, on which the Customs were the ulterior security, was in point of fact a further pledging of them. His Excellency quite understood that the question of a loan for the irrigation of Arabistan would require very careful consideration. But he said he believed the Persian Government could satisfy us that ti e works contemplated would not diminish the water-supply of the Kanin. Mons. van Boggen’s plans would require to be completed by a further local survey before the Persian Govern ment was in a position to lay its proposals before us, and he himself thought that a larger sum than £200,000 would be necessary in order to carry them out. I gathered from him that the Grand Vizier’s extreme interest in this scheme was to some extent a matter of personal vanity, as His Highness had told him that if they between them could find the means of restoring the ancient fertility and wealth of Arabistan, their names would go down to posterity illumined with a halo of imperishable glory, and that the Ain-ed-Dowleh’s own premiership, thus marked by a revival of national prosperity, would contrast all the more strikingly with that of the Atabeg-i-Azam, which had brought Persia so near to ruin.

Sir: I am directed by the Marquess of Lansdowne to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 26th ultimo relative to the despatch of an Engineer of the Indian Irrigation Service to Arahistan to report on the Karun Irrigation scheme. Lord Lansdowne is of opinion that the officer selected should start for Ahwaz as soon as possiole. His Lordship would suggest that he should, upon his arrival in Persia, report himself to His Majesty’s Consular Officers at Moharnmerah and Ahwaz. Should Mr. Vice Consul Lorimer he absent, he might address himself to Mr. Wilson, Messrs.

Sir, Foreign Office, September 16, 1904. MR. VAN ROGGEN called here on the 30th ultimo with a letter of introduction from His Majesty’s Minister ah The Hague, to whom, as recorded in the penultimate paragraph of your despatch No. 133 of the 19th July last, you had recommended him. He said that he wished to speak of the scheme of Karim irrigation, on which he had recently reported to the Shah. He dilated upon its wonderful possibilities, stating that his object in coming to England had been to interest British financiers in the project, and to enlist the support of His Majesty’s Government, who must, he thought, be interested in such a scheme. He hoped that a British or Anglo-Dutch Company might be formed to put the project into execution. This would cost some 500,000/., but the returns would be magnificent. He expressed a strong desire to talk the matter over with Lord Curzon, if an interview could be arranged. Mr. van Roggen was informed that this was unlikely, as Lord Curzon was not in town and would shortly start for India. As regards his proposal, he was told that His Majesty’s Government were, of course, greatly interested in any question connected with that part of Persia, and would always wish to encourage any scheme likely to benefit or to develop the resources of the country. It was understood, however, that the Shah had expressed his determination to keep the undertaking entirely in his own hands, and not to give it to any foreign Company. Presumably, therefore, Mr. van Roggen was speaking on his own behalf, and his suggestion did not emanate from the Persian Government. He replied that this was so : he had no mission or credentials of any kind, except a letter from M. Nans, acquiescing in his departure on leave. But he felt sure that if he could return to Tehran with a Syndicate or Company at his back, assured of the support of His Majesty’s Legation, and able to make a definite offer to the Persian Government and a good present to the Shah, his proposal would be accepted. He hoped, as a first step, to raise some 3,000/. in order to go back to Ahwaz, accompanied by other engineers, and make a further survey with proper instruments, which would enable him to elaborate the details of his scheme. In the course of further conversation the question of Karun irrigation was alluded to, and Mr. van Roggen scouted the idea that the water supply in the river would be affected by his irrigation scheme. This, he said, would be carried out entirely with overflow water, which was very abundant at certain times of the year. Finally it was suggested that he should put any proposals he had to make in writing for submission to me. He promised to do so. On the 1st instant Mr. van Roggen called again and said that, after consideration, he had decided not to trouble Lord Curzon by asking for an interview, as he had little to add to what he had already said. He proposed to start for The Hague that night, and hoped to return to London in a month. It would appear that he had interested some British firm in his scheme, but no particulars could be obtained. It was^ thought as well to point out to him that, as he no doubt realized, British interests and influence were paramount on the Karun, and that a purely foreign enterprise in those regions could hardly hope to be successful. He replied that he was fully alive to the fact chat no scheme could hope for success unless countenanced and approved by His Majesty s Government, but that, no doubt, a British firm or Company could count upon their support. He then left, repeating that he would communicate with this Department in writing, but, up to the present, he has not done so. On the 3rd instant the Persian Minister at The Hague told Sir H. Howard that Mr. van Roggen had spoken to him of his having called at His Majesty’s Legation and of his proposed visit to England. He added that the Persian Government deshed to keep the execution of the scheme in their own hands, and that Mr. van Roggen had no official mission, and was simply in Europe on leave of absence.

Section 1. Imperial Bank of Persia to Foreign Office.—(Received September 29.) Sir, 25, Abchurch Lane, London, September 28, 1904. I HAVE the honour to forward, for the information of the Secretary of State (in case it should have escaped the notice of the Foreign Office), a translation of an article in “L’Etoile Beige ” of the 13th instant on Belgian influence in Persia, founded on information communicated to the newspaper by M. Hennebicq, a Belgian lawyer in the service of the Persian Government. The whole article seems to deserve attention, as showing the great energy and success with which the Belgians are exploiting Persia and occupying administrative posts therein, while it is obvious that both in Persia and China the Belgians are frequently utilized by Russia to veil or conceal her political and commercial schemes. The Directors of this bank would specially direct attention to the statement in the article that the Persian Government is about to undertake irrigation works on a large scale on the Karim River, the plans for which have been prepared by a Dutch engineer in the Shah’s service. It is quite certain that the Shah has neither the money nor the will to undertake such works, which I have several times in public speeches urged on English financiers as a most satisfactory and profitable investment for their capital. But the Shah may be quite willing to sell the Concession for such a scheme to foreign capitalists, Belgian or Russian, or both, in which case there would be a rapid increase of Russian influence in Southern Persia. The Karun irrigation works, if undertaken, should be constructed by England alone within her legitimate sphere of influence, and by the aid of the large experience of her engineers in Egypt and India.

Do we not see landing here contingents of young Chinamen coming to learn the French language, and to study the great progress made in scientific, industrial, and commercial SP G We have also several of our fellow-countrymen in Persia, where they have accom- plished, under the auspices of the Persian Power, important reforms for the greater profit of that vast Empire, which, until the last few years, had been rather hostile^ to progress and civilization. To-day Persia, thanks to the Belgians, one may say, is being transformed, its institutions and its laws are being modified, and excellent productive .-ind salutary work has already been accomplished. Our compatriots are also very well received at Court, and the greater part have managed to obtain spleni.id positions. % * Here is a list of Belgians in Persia who occupy some of the chief Government posts at Tehran, the capital :— M.

Dambrain, the Director-General of Customs for the Southern Provinces. And lastly, M. Heynssens is Director-General of the Customs for the Caspian shores in the Northern provinces. That is a list of our compatriots who have the chief positions in Persia. We have no doubt that their families will learn with pleasure that all are in perfect health, and do very easily the task confided to them, which is not always a grateful one. In fact, M. Priem had to flee from Tabreez on account of the menacing attitude of the populace, who would not bend to the reforms introduced under the Persian financial regime. A very energetic intervention was necessary before the disorders were repressed. All is now as quiet as formerly, and to-day M. Priem acquits himself of his task without any fear of reprisals. * * * * * *- People at 1 ehran always welcome strangers, and particularly Belgians, who, by the way, are under the special protection of the Shah, who never misses an opportunity of showing them kindness, consideration, and esteem. Our fellow-countrymen are often received at Court, and are invited to all Royal fetes. This result is chiefly due to the Persian Minister in Belgium, Sad-ed-Dowleh, Mirza Jevad Khan, who has been for some time in Tehran, where he is kept by recent events, and who is the intimate adviser of both the Sovereign and the new Grand Ahzier, Ein-ed- powleh. Quite recently the portfolio of the Foreign Office was offered to this diplomatist, out he refused, preferring to retain his post at Brussels, which he will probably soon ioin.

Karun). There are immense tracts of land which in olden times were irrigated by a system of canals, traces of which are found at the present day. These lands will regain their lost fertility, thanks to the works which the Persian Government intends to execute, and which have been carefully thought out by a specialist, M. Graadt van Roggen, a Dutch engineer in the Shah’s service. It is also important to note that since his last visit to Europe, MouzafFer-ed-Din has encouraged teaching by the creation of numerous scholastic establishments in every province of his vast Empire. Thus, besides primary schools, there are at Tehran several special schools. We have already spoken of the School of Political Science, and will now mention a Polytechnic Institute. There is also the School of the French Alliance, and that of the American Mission. To-day there are two great banks, the Imperial (State) Bank of Persia, which alone can issue notes, and the Banque d’Escompte et de Pret Russe, under the control of M. Grube, Private Adviser to the Tsar Nicholas IT. We asked M. Hennebicq why, in his opinion, it has not been possible to instal certain Belgian industries in Persia. There have been many attempts, none of which have been successful. Belgian manufacturers and merchants, declared M. Hennebicq, could find plenty of markets for their products. For that it is not necessary to establish firms. A simple commercial agent would suffice,^if he were provided with powers to receive orders from seeing samples, and would confine himself to transmitting the orders to the firms he represented. That would be the way to avoid the considerable expenses which have hitherto prevailed against attempts in this direction. We announce, in conclusion, that next year the Shah will again visit Europe, and that he will come to Brussels and Ostend.mmmm !IC [This Document is the Property of His i PERSIA AND ARABIA.

These schemes are :— Karun fallow ° f Arabis,an b - vfive or six steam-pump barges placed on the “ Band/ 116 C ° nStrUCti0n ° f h ' n &gt; ,ion works on ‘he rapids at Afawaz on the site of the old 3.

The working expenses, more particularly the supply ot coal, will run into large figures, and the pumps, &amp;c., will require renewal from time to time. No. 2 . For the second conception the Sheikh would hardly admit his responsibility. He treated it as a castle in the air. He said that he believed it 'would cost 500,000/., and that he would only undertake it on two conditions: ( 1 .) Financial assistance. ( 2 .) Another.” By the latter he meant a guarantee of support from the British Government. rhe scheme is a very big and difficult one, but it would turn a large part of Arabistan into a permanent garden, and, granted security, there is scarcely room for doubt that it would prove an excellent investment. It would, of course, be necessary to devise some means of securing its advantages to our own traders. , 3. The third scheme refers to a large tract of land on the west bank of the Karon. I am indebted to Haji Rais for the following particulars :— The land is the property of the Nizam-us-Sultaneh, and is leased from him by the Sheikh for 1,500/. per annum. In Sheikh Mizal’s time, owing to the unruly state of the Arab inhabitants, the Nizam-us-Sultaneh was very anxious to sell it. Sheikh Mizal, however, did not then want to purchase, and instead reduced the Arabs to order; and the present arrangement was come to. Under the present improved circumstances, the Nizam would ask an impossible or exorbitant price for it. Haji Rais hinted, however, that a time might come when the Nizam-us-Sultaneh would be willing to sell. The price might then be brought down to, perhaps, 30,000/. Beyond the advantage of increased hold on the Sheikh’s “ affections,” 1 do not see clearly that we would stand to gain anything in helping him in this project. It would, of course, help towards the consolidation of his power in Arabistan. In seeking financial aid, 1 do not think that the Sheikh’s ultimate object would be merely money, but rather an actual or practical guarantee by the British Government. I HAVE the honour to recall attention to a remark in paragraph 9 of my No. 17, dated the 21st June, in which I stated that I thought the Sheikh of Mohammerah was inclined to hint that we should try and take steps to press the Persian Government to refund him the expenses he has lately incurred in protecting the “ Shushan ” and the route of Arabistan. I now 7 forward inclosed two papers, which were recently handed me by Mr. Wilson, of Messrs. Lynch Brothers. The Arabic note was dictated by Haji Rais-ut-fujar to a confidential Arab clerk in Messrs. Lynch’s employ. Whether the paper was intended to come to me I do not know. At any rate, it must be treated as highly confidential. For this reason I have not attempted to have the original translation made for Mr. Wilson revised. The note was supposed to indicate the form of a letter which Mr. Wilson was to write to the British Minister. Inclosure 3 in No. 1. Vice-Consul Lorimer to Major Cox. Ahwaz, July 4, 1904. B 2 [2182 c—2]Inclosm^e 4 in No. 1. Note dictated by Haji Rais-ut-Tujar to an Arab Clerk of Messrs. Lynch. (Translation.) Proposed Draft from Messrs. Lynch to Minister, Tehran. ABOUT a month ago his Excellency Sheikh Khazal, Sardar Arfa,came to Nasiri and the Karun, and sent his nephew with many sowars to Shuster and Dizful, and fully arranged matters in Arabistan. At the same time, all the Khasray and Abdul Khan from fear of the Sheikh, fled and absented themselves from these tow districts, and went to the Beni-Taroff, and we sent the steam-ship “ Shushan ” in safety until the arrival of the Azam-us-Sultaneh, Governor of Arabistan. We see that the Sheikh is incurring all the expenses on this account—the main tenance of order and the service of the Government—and, according to what we hear this expenditure will come from his own pocket, and the Government will not help him over this expenditure. As long as the Sheikh is put to the entire expense of keeping order in the Shat-el- Arab for the protection of the_ country, and in the Karun as far as Dizful, and his Government will give him nothing to compensate him for all these expenses, let it be known to you that he cannot bear these expenses for more than two months at the outside. When the Governor comes, he (the Sheikh) will withdraw himself from the maintenance of order in Shuster and Dizful, and when he withdraws we inform you that peace will become confusion, as heretofore. If you vyill relate this to the Persian Government, an arrangement will be come to with the Sheikh, and he will be given assistance in the matter of expenditure, so that he may always strive to do his utmost and keep sowars for the purpose of keeping D. Tul and Shuster in order, and there will be peace and rest for all, especially for out trade. And since we know that the Persian authorities are not supported nor fitted out by the Government with strength sufficient to enable them to make satisfactory arrangement even if they were willing to send many soldiers they w-ould not be able to cope with the* situation successfully, and it is easier for them to' come to some arrangement with the feheikh, in which there will be ease for the Government of Iran and for the people of Arabistan and for all. i i 1 Inclosure 5 in No. 1. /XT ^ s Sir A.
