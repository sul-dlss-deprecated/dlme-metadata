[Supplementary Note in continuation of Memorandum of 10M December 1875.) The Letter from the Grovernment of India, No. 200, of 14th October 1875, as well as the Foreign Office letter of the 29th November, formed the subject of considerable discussion. A draft letter to the Foreign Office, prepared by Sir H. Rawlinson, was approved by the Political Committee on the 8th January 1876. This proposed that Her Majesty’s Minister should announce to the Shah’s Government that the line determined by the map and revised Note of 1873 would be recognized by the British Government as the definitive frontier between Persia and Khelat so soon as the documents were formally ratified. Lord Salisbury, however, declined to accept the draft, and, on again consulting the Government of India, received the following reply by telegraph :— Azad Khan, of Kharan, has been raiding in Kohuk ; he is virtually independent, but owes nominal allegiance to Kabul. If we formally acknowledge Kohuk to be Persian territory Persia may endeavour to hold Afghanistan responsible for him, and complications will arise. Only safe course is that advised in our Despatch 200, dated 14th October 1875. If Persia accepts modified boundary we have no intention to interfere in Kohuk, although you cannot formally admit her right to it. If Persia does not acknowledge modified boundary she is bound to the former agreement of 1871, and should evacuate Kohuk. It may here be incidentally mentioned that, as a matter of fact, Kohuk was occupied by the Persians in 1874. Consequent on this further expression of the views of the Govern ment of India, a new draft was drawn up under instructions from the Secretary of State, the material paragraph of which was as follows:— In reply 1 am directed to shite that, in Lord Salisbury’s judgment, the proposed transfer of negotiations would not be convenient, and would not lead to an early or satisfactory settlement of the question at issue. His Lordship is in communication with the Govern ment of India on the subject, and trusts to obtain, without unnecessary delay, such further information as will enable him to place Lord Derby in possession of his matured opinion as to the course which should be adopted in the matter. On this draft being laid before the Political Committee, Sir H. Bawlinson recorded a further Note on the 10th February:— Since this Despatch was drafted a telegram has been received from India, giving the reasons of the Viceroy for objecting to the cession of Kohuk to Persia, as proposed in the letter which passed the Political Committee on 6th of January, and what do these reasons amount to? Simply that Azad Khan of Kharan, although virtually independent, owes a nominal allegiance to Kabul, that he has been raiding in Kohuk aud may do so again, in which case the Shah, if Kohuk has been declared Persian territory, may hold the Amir responsible for the acts of bis nominal vassal, and complications may thus arise. But has there ever been any indication of the Shah’s recognizing, or even being aware of, the pre tended Afghan nationality of Azad Khan ? Is it not, on the contrary, notorious that he has always been regarded as a Belooch feudatory of Khelat, which is indeed his true status ? The dependence of Azad Khan on Kabul is a myth which really is not worth diplomatic discussion. And, on the other hand, if Persia were allowed by us to occupy Kohuk, and Azad Khan after that occupation were to recommence his raids on the district, would not the Shah, supposing him to have an inkling of the freebooter’s “ nominal allegiance,” be able to pick a quarrel with the Amir on that account precisely the same as if Kohuk had been acknow ledged to be Persian territory ? It must be observed too that the Viceroy entirely overlooks the inconvenience of keeping up irritation at Teheran on such a petty question as this dependency of Kohuk, and takes no account of the advantage of placing the Shah under an obligation to England by yielding a point which i-cally can signify nothing whatever either to us or our allies, 18719. I. 1695 ,2 Adopting Sir H. Rawlinson’s view, the Political Committee on the 10th February recorded the following Resolution :—“ The Committee “ having seen the telegram from the Viceroy, dated 7th February, and “ Sir H. Rawlinson’s Memorandum of the 10th inst., consider that “ the line pointed out in the former letter approved by them on “ 6th January should he deftn itiwly, ^eyided on as the frontier between “ Persia and Khelat. The arguments advanced in the telegram from “ the Government of India in no way alter this opinion.” Lord Salisbury remained unconvinced however, and the letter in the shape as originally drafted under his orders was sent to the Foreign Office on 16th February, and, acting on the opinion therein contained, Lord Derby, on the 28th idem, informed Malcom Khan that his request for a transfer of the negotiations from Teheran to London must be refused. Azad Khan’s proceedings in Kohuk formed the subject of further Despatches from Teheran on which the opinion of the Secretary of State for India was asked. This Office letter of 31st July 1876 (Home No. 446) stated that these communications did not appear to Lord Salisbury to call for any observations on his part. This was virtually to leave * the further conduct of the matter in the hands of the Foreign Office. In an indirect manner, however, the India Office had to pass a decision as to the boundary, as the question cropped up in connection with a new map of Persia then being prepared by Major St. John. Lord Salisbury’s instructions, conveyed through the Political Depart ment to the Geographical Department, were, that the boundary between Persia and Khelat should be laid down on the new map in accordance with Sir F. Goldsmid’s original award of 1871, thus assigning Kohuk to Khelat. A proof sheet of the map was approved by the Secretary of State in August 1876, and the map appended to the revised Note of 1873 was consequently superseded. For some years subsequent to that date the whole matter was in the charge of the Foreign Office, from whom it has been ascertained that the Persian Government have continued to decline giving their formal acceptance of the revised Note, while at the same time they have claimed that the original decision as to Kohuk has been reversed, and that the district in reality belongs to Persia. No action was taken for ousting them from Kohuk, which, as mentioned above, the Persians had occupied in 1874, and to all intents and purposes the matter has remained in abeyance. The question was partially revived on the occasion of Sir R. Sandeman’s deputation to Mekran to settle the affairs of that province of Khelat. Writing on the 30th May 1883, Sir R. Sandeman says (India Foreign Department Proceedings, September 1883, p. 113, External), “I have the honour to point out that there are two other “ matters connected with Southern Biluchistan in which His Excellency “ the Governor General in Council might wish me to attempt a settle- £ - ment. . . The first of these is the claim preferred by Sirdar Azad “ Khan to the villages of Jalak and Kuhak. I believe the Commission “ appointed in 1872 by Her Majesty’s Government to settle the ,£ boundary between Afghanistan and Persia on the Seistan frontier “ ruled that these two villages were within Biluchistan, and that the “ Persian Government must not be permitted to occupy them. I further understand that these villages belong to His Highness the “ Khan, but that Sirdar Azad Khan lays claim to them.” In this statement Sir R. Sandeman is in error, as though Sir F. Goldsmid’s award assigned Kohuk to Khelat, it was expressly laid down that Jalak was within the Persian border, and this error was set right by the Government of India in the Foreign Secretary’s letter of 30th July 1883, which directed the Governor General’s Agent to avoid the3 * See pp. 1 and 2 of previous Memorandum. £ ‘ discussion of this or any other question which involves the rights of ‘‘ the Persian Government.” It will be useful to insert here some extracts from the report of Lieutenant Talbot on the work done by the survey party attached to Sir R. Sandeman’s mission to Mekran (India Poreign department Proceedings, June 1884, p. 281, External) :— The western boundary of Biluchistan between Jalk and Seistan has, as far as 1 know, never been visited by a European, and the border is in a most unsettled state. I have not had the opportunity of examining the authorities or information used in compiling the existing maps, but the impression 1 have received from comparing the information l have obtained with the published maps is that our geographical knowledge of this region is extremely hazy. So much so that it would be difficult to say what would be involved in assigning any of the disputed districts to either claimant ; as far as I could learn there would be no great difficulty in having this border land thoroughly exploied, but as there is no settled Government on the border, except where actually held by Azad Khan, it would be necessary to make ai’rangements with the petty chiefs of each district traversed. ***** I should have mentioned above, that while surveying the country round Panjgur, Mir Pasand Khan, son of *Mir Murad Khan Naushirwani, showed me what he considered to be the boundaries between his father’s country and that of Azad Khan and the Khan of Khelat. According to him (and I have not heard that it is disputed) his father’s territory extends for a considerable distance to the east of Mashkel to within a very short distance of Panjgur itself, and almost touching the main route from Panjgur to Gwadur. This suggested to me the possibility of the present holder of Kuhak endeavouring to oust Mir Murad from the remainder of his country, in which case he would obtain a footing within a march of Panjgur, hold both banks of the Mashkel, and might even claim the village in Panjgur now held by Murad Khan.</note><identifier>81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000096_en</identifier><location><shelfLocator>IOR/L/PS/18/C60a</shelfLocator><url>http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000833.0x000096</url><physicalLocation>British Library: India Office Records and Private Papers</physicalLocation></location><recordInfo><recordIdentifer>IOR/L/PS/18/C60a</recordIdentifer></recordInfo><titleInfo><title>'Kohuk (supplementary note in continuation of memorandum of 10 December 1875)'</title></titleInfo><originInfo><dateIssued>1889/1889</dateIssued><dateCaptured>2016-02-18T13:50:56</dateCaptured></originInfo><language><languageTerm authority="iso639-2b">eng</languageTerm></language><physicalDescription><extent>2 folios</extent><extent>Foliation: the foliation sequence for this description commences at f 12, and terminates at f 13, as it is part of a larger physical volume; these numbers are written in pencil, are circled, and are located in the top right corner of the recto side of each folio.</extent></physicalDescription><abstract>The document outlines the development of negotiations from 1875-1889 regarding the demarcation of the frontier between Persia and Khelat.
