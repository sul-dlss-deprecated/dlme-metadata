In consequence of the high-handedness of Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad and his not giving them their father's legacy they have combined with the inhabitants who brought the sons to Shargah on the 1st November» and all the in habitants entered ttauH into a treaty with them and surrender ed the town to the sons . Shaikh Khalid then demanded from the imhabitants to help him to fight and to expel the sons. The inhabitants have intimated that Shargah is their father's state and that they will not fight against them 4 the sons). On the 3rd November Shaikh Khalid set fire to some houses of the inhabitants. Shargah is at present, owing to the existence of a state of war, disturbed.

IHALIB then wrote a letter Saying he iras willing to abdicate in favour of the young SULIAM BEH SAGAR, but asking for sanctuary in the British Residency^ The Agent informed me that the British subjects did not require any active protection •at presents 2. I could not send any message ashore that night because, unfortunately, the native boat had capsized alongside the ship (so the crew and Agent's clerk had to spend the night on board), and I did not consider it advisable to risk sending a ship's boat into that surf in the dark* On this first information I despatched my first telegram 2235 of 10th Sovember. 3^ On the morning of November lltiu the Agent himself came off and gave me the following explanation of the cause of the rebellion and the existing situation^ When Sheikh SAGAR IBK KB ALU) died M ^ sons being children, the people of SHARJAH elected KHALID IBR AHMED to be Sheikh; as I understand it he was intended only to be a regent until the eldest son, SULrAN BEN SAGAR,. grew up.. In course of time the said children complained that KHALID tried to starve them and fled to another town. SULTAN BEN SAGAR having now grown up has discovered that EHALID is unpopular with the inhabitants of SHARJAH on account of the customs dues he has been levying which they claimf are not in accordance with Arab laws,. SULTAN therefore claimed the Sheikhship together with the wealth left by his father SAGAR at his death, and started the rebellion with the support of practically all the people, who look upon him as the rightful heir,. 4^ During the night of November lOth-Uth. the Sheikh at RAS EL KHEImAH arrived in SHARJAH, and started to use his family^ 2 I o • Report on situation at SHARJAH - family influence to mediate between the two parties* Ibe Agent was of opinion that the negotiations would be suttessful; providing that SDLTAK was agreeable to take over the debts of MAUD the latter would surrender the Shelkhship, but would n ot hand over any money to SULTAN as he maintains he has spent it all and has none* Also that KHALID would be allowed to live in SHAEJAH in peace as a private citizen and that in any case he would strongly object to being taken away,. 5* On November 12th about 1800 the agent again came to see me and reported that the abdication of KHALIII had been consummated said the necessary guarantees signed by both parties, and attested by various neighbouring Sheikhs- Copies of these papers (in Arabic) are attached*. 6* I was desirous of leaving SHARJAH at once in order to proceed to Join the Commander-in-chiefs flag at the time appointed at economical speed, but the Agent urgently requested me to remain until the armed Bedouin mercenaries (about 30 in number) of KHALHJ had quitted the town which he said had been arranged to take place early next morning, as he feared that otherwise these Bedouins might endanger the lives and property of the British subjects in the town*. I therefore decided to remain until the morning* 7- At 0900 on November 13th the Agent came on board and inforaed me that the Bedouins had left the town peaceably and that he was satisfied it was safe for •CTCLAMEN* to depart* He requested that if possible a ship might visit SHARJAH again in a few days tin© to ensure that all is quiet* I have since received orders from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, to revisit SI ART AH after leaving HAHREIR about November 20th* It was observed that the flag which had hitherto been flying from KHALIB , S high fort had now been hauled down* fiL I left SHARJAH at 0945 for rendezvous off BAHRKEK. / j J/ .

A. C. So^e time 'before the last two months I consulted your a,rent Tsa bin AMul Latif on the subleot of Installation of a telerraph service in the district of Layyeh with a vie^r to facilitating c^mT^ercial intercourse and to develope my city namely Shar^ah. The said Isa informed me in ^enly that it will be harmful to me and to him as it will brlnr the Government in direct touch with affairs because European Officials should then be in charge of the Telerraph Office and then the Consular Arent should also be a Suronoan, but If not Telerraph Office was established nothing will hanpen. I told him, then, I have the idea of conversing on tMs subject with you, on you~ arrival here without hie information. Your ^.ffe^t therefore Vr.ew that I would as a certainty discuss the question with you. On the Ist of Rabi TT, (=30-10-2i) therefore your agent sent for Abdur Rahman bin Vuhammad, a well v nowri riffraff and one Humaid bin Abdur Rahman ) who has been banished from Hemriyeh in 1341 / /r when I requested H.?, r, s Government to assist me in expellinr him fron that rlace. Under instructions from Tsa these two men brought ShalVh ^ultan bin Saqar from Debai by sea without my information and they entered Shargah on the 7 th Rabi TT, (=5-11-^4) and attacked my clerk 1 s house, plundered It and took Mm nriaoner. On hearing of this I also took the uncle o^ Sultan bin Saqar as a prisoner. Then fighting took nlace between us when suddenly T received an order fro'- your agent to release the uncle of Shaikh ^ultan and that for that the latter would release my clerk. T did not onnose your a^ent and@ 1 ul- (2) ard r0l9a30'-l the uncle of Sultan bin Saoar anl. tv.97 also releaaed ny clerV named Jasolrr. Afterwards your as:ent ^ent for all the merchants of Sharp:ah and having threatened and frightened then, told them that the Intention of Shalvh Thalld was to rut them under the British Government and that it Tvas advisable for them to maV© oonmon oause with Sha^'^h Sultan bin Sanar. The merchants informed him. that Sultan was only a hoy 17 years old and he was therefore unable to nana pro the administration of affairs. Your arent then replied them saylnr that outwardly the Government will be In the hands of Sultan bin Saqar but that inwardly they will not fail to five him the necessary assistance. The merchants then told him that Abdur Rahman and Humaid were evil-doers how could affairs remain quiet while they are in Sharrah, and on the other hand Shaikh Khalid was a friend of the Government by treaty. Your ajrent anpwered thetn sayln* that he &gt;n©w how to ret out of the difficulty. After this he wrote a document and obtained their si^natur^ on it statin* that Sultan bin Saqar has been anpointed as Chief. After havin* settled this with the merchants your arent ordered that my servants' houses should be burnt down as well as my brother's dinghy Abdullah bin Ahmad; its value was Ra.COOO/-. At this .-juncture the man-of-war ''Cyclamen T, arrived at ShareBh and I decided to pro on board with the idea of teleprraphin* affairs to vou. Your aprent ordered that I should/beei6red to prevent me p-ettinr on board the man-of-war for the purpose of as^inr assistance from the Government and to come to an agreement with the Government for the assistance. For* this Sultan bin Saqar (AAA. JUAA , ., „ lt , has Viai&amp;*duw*d to nay to your a^ent the sum or ^s.45,000/-. T then wrote a letter to your acrent Iga and stated that whatever the Government wanted from me same would be agreed to ^nd that an a^rrpe^ent ought to be arrived at when the man-of-war was present at the anchorage but your a penttmwwM. . i (© (3^ did not car© for* the Govorrmort's ^ntsrenta In 'nroforeroe to hi a own namely tbo Ra.45,000/-.

Your Agent Issa suggested that I should not accept this condition but reply to the Colonel that the question woild Have to be submitted xa for the views of the public. The object of your Agent was to mislead me and to play tricks against me as ae aad done with otriers. No doubt you are tlk aware that the sum oi Hs.lbJ/- paid as monthly salary by H.B.MGovernment to your Agent is not suf ficient for this man, vhereas his expenses at present amount to Rs.SOOO/- as he possesses two launches, one motor and t.ae otaer a steam launch. You know better than I do what the fcxpeiiaes for maintaining these two launches would be. Where does he find the wherewithal for their upkeep except by taking bribes from us and from other Chiefs. How he has received the sum of Rs.45, 000/- which will suffice for some months. A.s long as you have Issa as your Agent at Shargah the High Imperial Government will not achieve its ends nt on-r^p.h or on the coast of Oman and otier places. Our object is to inform you of the true facts and to pray God and H.B.M.

He fears ( and his fears are probably not groundless ) that if he continues to live at Dubai and at enmity, ill disposed persons will loot or raid Shargah people and it will, not unnaturally, always be laid at his door and the Sheikh of Dubai may be accused of harbouring him and be dragged into the quarrel. He wants to get fjoiae interr^iediaries to arrange a peace, before the Residency Agent at Shargah. Sheikh Haned asks whether he might fend his sen Salman to join up with the Sheikh of Dubai and some of ti ■V7 the no^tables to go to Shargah and arrange the terms of a ^ \ ' v ■&gt;' ' i truce.

I also discussed the matter verbally with the Shaikh and told him that it was not advisable for him to instigate the 'Bedouins to prevent Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad from going to the village of Dhaid and that the best thing for him to do was to desist from doing so. I also pointed out to him that the Bedouins who were in charge of the fort of Dhaid had stated that he was support ing them.with arms/»»* ammunition and stores. The Shaikh, as has mentioned in his letter to you, said that he has no objection whatever about the'village o.i Dhaid. I proceeded personally to. Umm-ul-Qaiwain and informed Shaikh Khalid bin Ahmad that Shaikh Sultan has nothing to do with Dhaid and that he was acting- according to the agreement which was concluded by the S.N.O. The Shaikh agreed to go there but stated that in case the forts of Dhaid had been occupied by the Bedouins who have treaty with Shaikh Sultan he will not be able to go there, because he has neither any followers nor money to collect men in order to fight the Bedouins of that place if he wanted to go there. But if Your T Tonour allow Shaikh Hamad bin Ibrahim CJhief of Umm-ul-Qaiwain to assist him in this matter he will be able to go there.

He had also formerly accepted the claim of the Bunnia Jethanand amounting to Rs.30000/- which he is paying 'by instalments. The Shaikh said that he could not afford to pay such amounts as the town of Shargah has not so much revenue. I told the Shaikh that I would persuade Shaikh Khalid and his brother to agree to his proposal. 1 addressed Shaikh Khalid vide my letter No.141 dated the 20th Shawal 1346 (11-4-28) as per copy attached, to which I received an answer which I also forward it herewith Shaikh Khalid was prohahly awaiting the arrival of the Shaikhs of Brairni vide my report No.156 dated the lyth- April 1928. On the 27th ^pril the Shaikhs of Nairn and Salim 'bin Deyin Shaikh of Beni Ka'ab visited the Bedouins of Beni Katah and Khawatir who were fighting each other over their property at Dhaid and effected a peace 'between them and arranged that the village should 'be restored to the' Qawasim Chiefs and that the Bedouin trihes should not raalce any interference in it. The Shaikhs of Nairn and «eni Ka'ah tribes after making peace between the two tribes proceeded to Has ul Khaimah to see Shaikh Sultan bin Salim. After- * wards they took Shaikh Sultan with themselves to Umm ul- Caiwain to see Hamad bin Ibrahim and Khalid bin Ahmad..It was arranged that the village of :)haid should 'be in possession of tne Shaikh of Has ul Khaimah on 'behalf of Khalid 'bin Ahmad. All the said Shaikhs left Umm ul Q,aiwain for Shargah where they oalled on Shaikh Sultan 'bin Saqar Afterwards all the Shaikhs called on me and informed me ahout the arrangement. The Shaikh of Has ul Khaimah told me privately that the village of Dhaid was not suitable for Khalid 'bin Ahmad as it is situated in the interior where the Bedouins live. Khalid is penniless and money is required for places which are in the interior. Dhaid has not so much income which may suffice its expenses and it would 'be advisable if Shaikh Sultan 'bin Saqar pay some money in lieu the village as it would only 'be g 00( i f or the Shaikh of Shargah. ^ftien I informed the Shaikh of Kas ul Khaimah that you had decided that Shaikh Sultan 'bin ^aq.ar should pay Ss. 1500/- he approved of it. The Shaikh of Has ul Khaimah and myself mutually agreed that the village should 'be taken from the Bedouins and handed i over to the Shaikh of Has ul Khaimah and then we will think over making a settlement 'between Shaikh Khalid and Sultan about it. The Shaikhs of Naim and Beni Ka'ab and the Shaikh of Has ul Khaimah proceeded to Dhaid and it was handed over to the latter Shaikh who kept some guards and appointed a Wali on liis behalf there. The Shaikn or Has ul Khaimah wrote to Shaikh Sultan about his taking over the village as per copy enclosed herewith. I hope to go to Kas ul Khaimah for the settlement of this matter and will report the result to you in due course.

I beg to state that when 1 was in Bahrain the ^on'ble the Political Resident enquired from me about the viAage of Ohaid and i informed him that owing to the int0ri%r0noe of the Bedouins the question of the village has not beensettled. He deoided that in order to avoid the trouble of the Bedouins ohaikh Jultan 'bin ^aqar should pay Hs.1500// to you in lieu of handing over the village to him. in oonfirmation of tae conversation which was made ahout the village he has instr^ucted me in his letter No.21 dated the 25th March 1928 to settle the matter in this manner. In my opinion it would he advisable if you accept this unount in return of tne village of Dhaid and get rid of the trouble of the -Bedouins. The village of Dhaid is in possession or the Bedouins and large sums of money are required for guards if you live in it. I understand that itf income would not suffice its expenses and at the present time you are also in a hard financial position. in my opinion it would 'be advisable if you accept the money.
