After the Foreign Office expresses its intention in January 1922 to withdraw Imperial contributions after the end of the current financial year, the correspondence goes on to discuss potential savings and possible ways of making the lighting and buoying service 'self-supporting', such as by imposing a levy on all vessels calling at Basra and Abadan. Also discussed are the proposal to impose dues on all local sailing vessels in the Gulf, and the question of whether the Government of Irak [Iraq] would be able and willing to collect light dues from vessels calling at Basra and Abadan, on behalf of the British Government and the Government of India. The correspondence concludes with discussion of a proposed advisory committee relating to lighting and buoying in the Gulf, which would consist of representatives of various shipping and commercial interests.Notable correspondents include the following: the Viceroy of India; the Secretary of State for India; the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf; the Chamber of Shipping; officials of the India Office, the Foreign Office, the Admiralty, the Treasury, and the Government of India's Marine Department.In addition to correspondence, the volume contains the following: a copy of an India Office memorandum entitled 'Memorandum on the Lighting and Buoyage of the Persian Gulf', dated 1911 (ff 322-328); copies of the minutes of interdepartmental conferences held at the Foreign Office on 7 March 1923 (ff 148-150, ff 164-166, and ff 172-181), 24 July 1923 (ff 111-112), and 11 April 1924 (ff 40-41), discussing lighting and buoying in the Persian Gulf.The volume includes a divider which gives the subject number, the year the subject file was opened, the subject heading, and a list of correspondence references by year. This is placed at the back of the correspondence.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Persian Gulf Lighting Service</namePart></name></subject><name type="corporate"><namePart>Chamber of Shipping</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Foreign Office</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Government of India, Marine Department</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Political Resident, Persian Gulf</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Admiralty</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>HM Treasury</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Viceroy and Governor-General of India in Council</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><name type="corporate"><namePart>Secretary of State for India, United Kingdom</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><geographic>Persian Gulf</geographic></subject><subject><topic>Expenditure</topic></subject><subject><topic>Navigational aids</topic></subject><subject><topic>Buoys</topic></subject><subject><topic>Lights</topic></subject><subject><topic>Shipping dues</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00022b#share">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00022b#share">Creative Commons Non-Commercial Licence</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000419.0x00022b#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
