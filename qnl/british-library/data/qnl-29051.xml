Since steel^fears do not fall within the scope of the Arms Export Prohibition Order, 1931, the rep^ so far as the export of the material alone is concerned / would be that as the steel bars in their present state appear to be several stages removed from the completed articles which they may ultimately form the Board of Trade would regard the bars as raw material and would therefore allow their export without the requirement of a licence.

Political Department. 1 1 V In his telegram of 26th July ( P 3986A/26) Sir F. Humphrys merely reported an enquiry as to whether British workmen would be available to start a .3C3 cartridge factory in Kabul. The enquiry addressed to Imperial Chem- -ical Industries by Sir Francis Humphrys refers to the supply of plant* and would presumably cover the employ- -ment if available of British workmen. Sir F.Humphrys is no doubt anxious to do a politeness to the Afghan Gov- -ernment by securing them a tender. But if it came to a i question of employing British workmen he would probably i lay down stringent conditions. In any case little prog- -ress is likely to be made with the business just now, | but this does not seem to prevent our agreeing to I.C.I. replying to Sir F.Humphrys's enquiry. It is agreed that the Department of Overseas Trade might be so informed. l 7 th December 1920* f~ I s 1 imunication on this subject, please qtiote / ^ ' 4 4 M J 7/4-, U'/Ji / 44 ! &lt;?/ A? person by name, but to—4 In any further communication on this subject, please qtiote No and address —not to any person “The Under-Secretary of State,” Foreign Office, London, S.W.

Some of the difficulties attendant on such a scheme were set forth in the minutes on that paper. There is now the added difficulty that no schemes of any kind are likely to progress during the present troubles: But this is no reason why a British firm should not obtain particulars and submit a tender if it wishes to do so, and if India Office concur, I think we might inform Department of Overseas Trade that we see no objection to Imperial Chemical Industries corresponding with Sir jF.

Ku 1 India It is for the Government of to say whetner any restriction by 0 Ur X- ‘d,&lt; &gt; Previous Papers : — H3&amp;in - L m 1 (Wn i 923 2000 2.26 licence can be applied to the export from India of articles required for use in this powder factory: but Sir F.Humphrys seems to be going rather far in suggesting that restrict ions should be applied,just because the factory is being set up under Russian auspices. By the Treaty we are committed to permit the import by Afghanistan from British India of whatever material is 'required for the strength and welfare' of Afghanistan, 'without let or hindrance,' on the understanding^ in regard to munitions, that there is no immediate danger to India from such importa tion. A powder factory is a natural enough piece of equipment for the Afghan Government; so long as we permit the importation ofof made munitions from or thorough India, there seems no case fpr restricting the importation of material to be used for making a particular sort of munitions in this factory. The fact that the factory plant comes from Russia and is being set up by Russian help seems entirely irrelevant. Sir F. Humphrys possibly has in his mind an analogy with the restrictions recently approved in regard to the supply from India of petrol, oil, canvas etc. for the 'Afghan Air Force'. It is submitted that there is no real parallel between the supply by the British Government of the material required by what is really a detached wing of the Russian Air Fleet to enable it to function in close proximity to our frontier, and the^ importation by the Afghan Government of raw material to be made up into explosives in an Afghan Factory for the use of the Afghan forces, even thoughithat factory is of Russian origin. &gt; A • 2^4 /l A /l Mr att a*.of made munitions from or thorough India, there seems no case fpr restricting the importation of material to be used for making a particular sort of munitions ir factory plant c A g % up by Russian 1 a |o S- 8 m r ^' Humphrys possit the restrictions supply from Ind the “Afghan Air there is no rea the British Gov by what is real Air Fleet to er proximity to ou the Afghan Gove up into’explosi use of the Afghof made munitions from or thorough India, there seems no case fpr restricting the importation of material to 'be used for making a particular sort of muni factory up by R U Humphry the res supply the 'Af there i the Bri by what Air Fie J r\ proximi the Afg! up into use of is of R / /Ci/lwl* i ^ 1 ^'0 n 4L&lt;U‘3 ^ L,' J do SEl pouhcal \ IIWIfrom Lieut.-Colon*!

WDRAFT With reference to your enquiries made orally at the India Office on the 5th December, in regard to a request for estimates for the supply of nitro glycerine plant and cordite presses for the Afghan Government, I am directed by the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to inform you that there is no objection to your undertaking the business. It will, of course, be understood that if any restrictions should hereafter be placed on the export from this country of plant and machinery of this kind, the supplies in question will be subject to such restrictions.

J- /V Previous Payers- Copy to f[ ' o nfC FOR USE BY DEPARTMENTS ONLY. 3806—2 1000 11/20Mr, Yungay (card attached) was brought to call on me this morning by Mr. Locke, of the Home Office, said that he had received a day or two ago an oral enquiry from j;essrs. H.B. Lleeman M Go. of Leadenhall jtreet, on behalf of Messrs. Kemp &amp; Go. of Bombay, for estimates for nitro-glycerine plant to produce 3000 lbs. of nitro glycerine per day and for presses for pressing cordite from dough. The enquiry was said to originate with the Afghan Government. Hr.Tungay said that, the object being obviously to manufacture munitions, and on a considerable scale, he wished to assure himself before committing himself in any way that the business was unobjectionable. Mr.Locke said that so far as the regulations in this country were concerned no permit would be required forjthe exportation of the plant in question. Whether the Anglo- Afghan treaty confers on the British 'Government any power to stop its importation into Afghanistan through India seems doubtful. Under Art.6 the British Government agrees that ’’whatever quantity of material is required for the strength and welfare of Afghanistan, such as all kinds of factory machinery shall ordinarily be imported without let or hindrance”, subject to the further provision that ’’with regard to arms and munitions, the British Government agrees that as long as it is assured that the intentions of the Government of Afghanistan are friendly and that there is no immediate danger to India from such importation in Afghanistan, permission shall be given without let or hindrance”. it seems doubtful whether this article can be read as applying to machinery for the manufacture of munitions, and in any case munitions would not be held up under this Article at present. If there is no question o.' actually stopping importationN 2 . / . importation through India, it does not seem desirable to apply the very limited check of merely discouraging hr. Tungay, who would-in that event be penalised lor informing Government of the proposed transactions if his competitors did not. ho far as i can judge, there is no particular reason why Government should wish to stop the supply from this country of the plant in question. The Afghans could no doubt purchase it elsewhere, and import it otherwise then through India, if driven to do so. It is quite possible, for that matter, that the enquiry received by hr. Tungay is only one of a large number of similar enquiries in alj quarters, none of which may come to anything, '.7e are constantly hearing at present of Afghan enquiries for arms and munitions in all parts of the world. It seems desirable to inform the Government of India and invite any comments. home views are expressed tentatively in the draft telegram, partly with a view to expediting the reply. Mr.Tungay is anxious for an early re-nly. Meanwhile he will proceed with the preparation of his estimates. (sd) L.D.Wakely. 5.12.24. It is of course possible that later on a new Arms Traffic Convention might affect the position, but it seems unnecessary to say anything about this to the Government of India. A reservation as to this possibility might be made in replying to Mr. Tungay.
