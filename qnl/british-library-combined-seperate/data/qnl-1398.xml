            Noel Jackson, Maurice O’Connor Tandy); the India Office (later the Commonwealth
            Relations Office, Eion Pelly Donaldson, Adrian Harbottle Reed, Ralph Ingham Hallows);
            the Foreign Office (Lancelot Frank Lee Pyman); the Ministry of Fuel and Power (William
            Dunmore Monsell-Davies); His Majesty’s Minister at Jedda (Alan Charles Trott); the
            Shaikh of Kuwait (Shaikh Aḥmad al-Jābir Āl Ṣabāḥ) and various oil companies in relation
            to the auction process instituted by the Shaikh of Kuwait for his share in the
            Kuwait-Saudi Arabia Neutral Zone oil concession.The companies which expressed an interest in bidding for the
            Kuwait neutral zone concession included Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Burmah Oil
            Company, the Eastern Gulf Company, the Amerada Petroleum Company, the American
            Independent Petroleum Corporation, the Superior Oil Company of California and the
            Canadian Eagle Oil Company. However owing to the Shaikh's requirement that
            financial backing and resources to undertake exploitation of an oil concession are
            proven by each potential bidder only four companies were permitted to continue and
            submit final bids on 1 June 1948 – Petroleum Concessions Limited, the Burmah Oil
            Company, the Eastern Gulf Company and the American Independent Petroleum
            Corporation.Other matters discussed in the file include:the question of the political agreement between His
               Majesty’s Government and successful Oil Company and discussing whether such an
               agreement could be made with an American Company and also what changes and special
               requirements would have to be made owing to the concession only being for the Shaikh
               of Kuwait’s share of the neutral zone.a visit paid by the Shaikh of Kuwait to Ibn Saud (‘Abd
               al-‘Azīz bin ‘Abd al-Raḥmān bin Fayṣal Āl Sa‘ūd)and the question of whether or not
               the neutral zone was discussed by them.debate around the possibility of a geographic division
               of the neutral zone in order to make administration of the zone easier, and the
               conclusion that negotiations for such a division could take years and would not
               perhaps be in the best interests of the Oil Companies exploiting an oil concession
               there.a hydrographic survey of the coast-line of the neutral
               zone to locate a suitable landing site for heavy equipment.a new air service instituted by Iraq Airways in 1947
