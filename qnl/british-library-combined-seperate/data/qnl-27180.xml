It is argued that it would anger the Caun [Karim Khan]. Mīr Muhanna's character is discussed. Explanation for these objections to the idea is given by an overview of current politics in Persia, with particular focus on the Gulf littoral. News is also given that the Sheikhs of Bushire have been in contact with Mīr Muhanna and that the road between Schyrass [Shiraz] and Bushire is closed.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Letter</genre><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100024189854.0x0001b9#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
