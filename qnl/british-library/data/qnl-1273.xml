Mr The Future Constitution of Mesopotamia. ^ptured I. 1. It is assumed that the Mesopotamiau State is to be essentially Arab in character, possessed of tiuancial stability sufficient to ensure to Great Britain payment of interest on the value of capital works inherited from the Military Administration and so secure as to attract the foreign capital essential to the exploitation of her resources and the development of her industries, actual and potential. In its internal constitution the new State must be sufficiently elastic to preserve the tribal system in tribal areas, to safeguard village' and rural life in districts which have attained tliat stage of economic life, and simultaneously to satisfy the national aspirations and democratic sentiments of the larger towns and cities. It seems required to create political institutions adapted to these several phases of political development but capable of being combined into an organic whole. II. 2. Tribal Areas. —Tribal areas, it is suggested, might remain grouped into districts; but the tribes should be given the opportunity of rearrans'me- conditions. the boundaries of these districts with reference to economic Tribes who have rival interests in a single irrigation system should be grouped into one administrative organisation so that they could adjust their conflicting interests in common council. Districts would be presided over by a Governor whose function it would be to prevent or compose inter-tribal quarrels, to see that within the tribe the authority of the Shaikh is maintained, that justice is administered' by tribal law, and that revenue is paid. He would be actively assisted by a Council of Shaikhs, the Vice-President of which might be a Shaikh, elected by the Council. The Council would not normally interfere in matters that arise within the tribe, the ultimate penalty of maladministration being removal from Chieftainship : but it would have important functions in the assessment of revenue and the distribution of water. Assessments should be in the nature of tribal tribute fixed for a term of years, and represent such proportion of the fruits of the soil as the central authorities may determine. Within the tribe the Shaikh would be—as he is in Amara muqataas —responsible for administrative and judicial work. Order would be maintained by a local levy which would be lent to any Shaikh at the cost of the tribe where its employment became, in the opinion of the Council, necessary. These recommendations have been made possible by the work that has been done to build up the tribes, and they consist in little more than an extension of an existing system. 3. liural Communities. —Rural communities which have broken away from the tribal system present the greatest difficulty, and the adjustment of relations between absentee landlords and cultivators is a problem that must be faced. Rural districts, in the same manner as tribal districts, would be under a Governor and Council, the Council consisting of representatives of both landlords and cultivators (these possibly elected), but the Council would be able to investigate matters which in tribal areas are left to the Shaikh. Administration would continue to be carried out through the existing civil service of Mudirs and Mamurs responsible to the Governor and Council under the general supervision of the centra'! authorities. Justice would be administered by the Department of Justice. Disputes between tribesmen and members of the rural community would be decided by statutory law, not tribal custom. - io 212 40 11/194. Tonus and Cities. —Town8 and cities would have elected committees the existing haladiyak establishments with elected members. These would be under the general supervision oi the Minister of the Interior, and would be under the presidency of an elected Arab. 5. (Central (joreriwirnt^ Sovevvlgnty would he vested in the Central Executive, subject to such limitation as the mandate may impose upon the Mandatory. This Central Executive would at first consist of a Governor- General in Council. The Governor-General would at first be the British representative, and his powers vis-d-vis the Council would be delined with reference to the mandate and the wishes of the Arab leadejK in Mesopotamia. The Council would consist of Ministers control ling' Departments of State. The exact allocation ol Ministries, and of departments to Ministries, must depend in these early stages partly on considerations of. economy, partly on the limited qualifications of the limited personnel likely to be available. But the tree might be somewhat as follows :— 1. Minister for Finance. Budget. Currency. Local Audit. 2. Minister for Kevenue and Agriculture. Land Revenue. Customs. Irrigation. Agriculture. 3. Minister for Commerce and Industrv. Commerce and Industry. Railway?. Port. L Minister of the Interior. Posts, Sic. Mimieipalities. Education. Health. Public Security. Public Works. 5. Minister for -1 ustice. Civil Courts. AVaqf. Religious Courts. Within the department there shonld be a Secretary, who might usually be nntish 'here the Head ot the Department is Arab, and possible' 8 whether at first more than one Arab .Minister will be Relations with non-Arabian Towers must obviously be conducted by the Mandatory on its own responsibility, lint as regards neighbouring \rab uno^ t ie r t.tTl I ' r '' ly bp , a. difficulty, the extent of which will depend J n . tll&lt; settlement as to Syria, and which can hardlv be solved even tentatively, at present.

It is true that we have used the advisory system in Mesopotamia, but the method so lends itself to camouflage that it does not really satisfy. The suggestions are intentionally vague, and are intended not to be a cut-and-dried scheme, but rather to indicate the outlines of the sort of constitution which might be introduced in the near future without too violent dislocation of existing conditions or a lowering of administrative ■efficiency below a point compatible with the requirements mentioned in the first paragraph of this note. The working out of the detail must be done by the British authoriiies on the spot in-co-operation with the Arabs themselves, [f this co-operation is not obtained the success of this or any other scheme would be impaired if not destroyed. 0. C. G. Political Department, India Office, 1st November 1910. : (P 6791) Annex. Telegram from Political, Ikighdad, 29//i October (Copy hij post to India.) (Received 31st, 11 a.m.) 919. Vioritv A. II.) 12929. Your telegram dated 28th October. Divisional council at Basrah has been in full swing for last three months and is doing good work, vide my Despatch dated 21 st October, 31755. Divisional councils have been successfully started at Kirkuk, vide my Despatch 32159 of to-day's date and at Diwaniyah and Ainara. Formation of divisional council at Baghdad has been actively discussed with local notables, but formation has, by general consent, been deferred, pending institution of municipal council, Wic my Despatch dated 1 ith August (56306?). 'This has now been done and we are free to devote attention to divisional council which vviil be working by the end of the year. The institution ol a divisional council at Mosul has been deferred pending decision as to its future status. No steps have been taken at Dair-ez-zor for obvious reasons, nor at Sulaimaniyah, where rival tribes and factions and recent disturbances make it undesirable to move in the matter at present. The position in the divisions of Hillah, Najaf, Kut and Nasiriya is that harvest operations and payment and collection' of revenue have absorbed whole energies alike of notables and officials, and it has not been possible to get Shaikhs and notables &amp;&gt; leave their lands. There have, however, been several informal councils in districts, and councils will be established formally by the end of the year in each of these divisions. In Ram ad i and Samarra divisions we have not yet attempted to establish formal councils, but there is increasingly close co-operation between Shaikhs and Government officials, and for practical purposes informal councils already exist. No action has been taken in Hakubah or Khanikin division owing to the fact that nearly all the principal landowners are resident in Baghdad and many of them are destined to sit on Baghdad divisional council. It may, therefore, be found advisable hereafter to include Bakubah within the area covered by Baghdad divisional council. On the other hand, the proposal is now under consideration to amalgamate Khanikin and Baku ball divisions into a single area known as Diala division, with headquarters at Shahraban. This proposal, if adopted, will render formation of a usel'ul council much easier, as local interests will be more fully represented than they could be in Baghdad divisional council. Provincial councils have not yet been formed, nor do I contemplate moving in the matter this year.uwu— fairneBS to Colonel Wilson, to make a few remarks. We mvist beware ol attacbing too much importance to criticism from Syria. The Baghdadi (Tthcers aie oo I , interested to be impartial, and British officers like Colonel Brayne with no very deep knowledge of Syria and none at all of Mesopotamia, draw their information iiom tins one, as it were tainted, source. The Baghdadi officers may have expecte( )tl appointments would at once be offered to them in their own country. Ihe} have )een disappointed, and they are still collected in Syria, where—from all accounts —t ley are making a tremendous hash of things, and where they see little prospect ol permanent employment. 'I have at last realised,' writes Miss bell f' 01 ^ 1 Damascus on Uth October, ' what the Baghdad! party means here. ' ltl1 ' a solitary exception that of All Ridha Hikabi, who is a Damascene, it is ' almost exactly true to say that every post of importance is in the hands of the Baghdadis, and exactly true that they ;hold every big military position. ' The leaders of the party, who colour the views of the whole, are not only pro- ' Arab, but anti-European. They desire a confederated Syria, a Mesopotamia ' entirely beyond European control and without, European help or advice. Needless ' to say,' they look to occupying themselves comforluble billets in this Utopia. To ' gain their end they are quite ready to sacrifice the immediate (and, as 1 think, the ultimate) interests of either province ; for while they are naturally indifferent to what ' happens to the Syrians, they are scarcely less indifferent to the fate of the Mesopo- ' tamians, none of them having lived in their native country (or few of them having ' lived there) for a considerable time, and none of them having any personal stake in ' it. There is not a single member of one of our big families among them, except Kaji ' Suwaidi, he who returned in anger the other day from Baghdad, throwing up his job '■ as Governor of the town—you remember. I shall see him in Aleppo. ' This being the material of which the bonfire is composed, you will realise that *' it is inflammable. In point of fact every British officer who is in a position to know, ' and all the natives of the country, fear either a massacre of the Christians, if our 44 troops go out without being replaced by the French, or other internal disorders, ' looting of the towns by Beduin and riffraff of different kinds, and probably massacre ' on the top of that.' Moreover, ' The Baghdali leaders are dependent on the monthly ' subsidy which we give the Sharif. As that diminishes their poiver will wane, and ^ when the subsidy ceases 1 cannot see how t^eir inlluenct can be maintained. The native Syrians dislike them, partly because Ihc administration under them is perceptibly worse ihan it was under the Turks' (my italics). Even the vaunted Arab Army is what you and I would call a farce.' These are our critics ; these are the people who would like to put themselves, and whom Colonel Brayne would like to put, in our place in Mesopotamia. But though the position in that country may not be what the Baghdadis would wish, though there may not yet be.anything resembling an ' Arab State,' it is not the case that Colonel Wilson wishes to fix a British administration on Mesopotamia or that the administration is not moving steadily in the right direction. Colonel Wilson was here in April, and I am not aware that His Majesty's Government indicated to him any impatience at the rate of progress In the proposals which he put forward in February he ruled out the idea of ' creating central legislative or deliberative Councils,' and His Majesty's Government in approving his scheme did not disagree. His proposals to develop and consolidate municipal and divisional Councils were approved on 9th May, and by the end of October four were in existence and five more are to be in existence by the end of the }car ; his telegram of 2{)th October seems to me quite satisfactory on this point. But with regard to Provincial Councils no action is contemplated at present. The spirit of the administration could not be better illustrated than by reports on the Education and Judicial Departments in the Baghdad Vilayet which have justbeen received. In education the laugna«e ordinivilv attempt lias been made to introduce Entdisli into alt' tlip , i i ls ™ a '' an '' no be aimost certain to lay the fo« n dat^S tt^ion^'^ '}™ lA the policy oi Govermiient is ' to tench each child his own' '1^1 tl i' 0 '' ^rnment the rule was rigidly enforced that every boy atteadinJ a On, t school slioald wear European dress and the i'e/ '' • iiow ^lv / ^ ' 7 o\eminent .' t wear national rather than Enropean dre' ' ' JnThe' Elation t0 mtive personnel is practically impossible at present the mnfpvi 1 i T^itrnent a 11L ^ 1X oiamev Maudes - sliorU-oiinugs and defects of the judicial « i.-!, 'f' •, •• ' V , ,?, a ' r Wn ?'

So inuch for aceomplishinent. I should like now to quote some passages from private communications from Colonel Wilson, to show the principles by which he is guided, the difficulties which he has to face, and his feeling about his personal responsibility. (i) From a private letter of 8th July My own views are: [1) If an oriental country can avjid being the catspaw of foreign powers, and can treat foreign ' residents well, and its own subjects not too badly, it ought to be allowed to carry 4k on without interference. (2) lingland ought not to take on any responsibilitv in ' the East that she can avoid without danger to herself or treachery to the oriental ' population concerned.' After indicating his consciousness that the nationalists w r ould not accept the existing administration as fultilling the Anglo-French declaration of November 1918, he goes on : ^ We are pledged not to force alien institutions on lt the peoples of the Middle East, but to give them a (loverninent oii their owui lines. *•' There were three sets of institutions which may claim to be more or Jess indigenous ** in these areas : — ' (1) rThe tribal system. (2) The centralised Turkish bureaucracy. ' (3) Populai - institutions of a Western type.' ' (I) We are on velvet here, it is our strong point. ' ('2) We have radically changed it by foice of circumstances (the staff haviiiL;- i nn away) on the principle of local as opposed to departmental responsibility. ' We have made it decidedly more alien (though not necessarily more unpopular) and efluaUy more efficient, the two are inseparal)le. 41 If they have a lot ot lu'illiant Mesopokmiians in Syria let them come over here and enter our offices. We can place many of them, but not any in tribal areas, where the Klfendi is anathema. Syria has apparently no tribal problems. 41 (3) We are moving slowly but surely, and with some measure of popular acceptance already, . 411. -r, ' We could move faster but for our large garrison and elaborate military organisation; 1 believe our ration strength in .Mesopotamia is still about 240,000. We have a ration strength of over 20,000 in Persia on the Persian Road, all led and mameed from here. Tliey monopolise the river and railways. Military othcers anil men still occupy 800 houses in Baghdad out of a total of some 2,000 houses classed as habitable lor Europeans. n ■ i i • i j * i '■ The streets are still Crowded with Indians and with our lorries ; drastic i' e g l da- tions on various subjects are still suddenly promulgated and lulhlessly executed.
