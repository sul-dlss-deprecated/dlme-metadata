Sir, GKADUR AERODROME We have the honour to state that our Representative at Gwadur has recently drawn our attention to the necessity of erecting a small hut at Gwadur Aerodrome, in the vicinity of our existing buildings, to serve as a shelter for our Ford car,which, under existing conditions, must remain exposed to the elements for long periods while our Representative is engaged at the Aerodrome. The hut it is proposed to erect would be only large enough to acconmodate the vehicle in question and would be constructed of date matting and mud plaster. We should be obliged if you would be so good as to take up the matter on our behalf with His Highness the Sultan of Muscat and Oman with a view to our obtaining the necessary sanction for the erection of this hut. ft t** ** w- si ■■‘f.'**. ,J+ W AS' y \ r ^r^ ^ vt We have the honour to be, Sir, Your most obedient servants.
