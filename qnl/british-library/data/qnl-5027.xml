Sugar v/ill be difficult to obtain and expensive during the war. I will make en quiries from India. How much will be wanted?- The most important question of all is the giving of advance to divers to carry them throufrh the Winter. The divers are mostly foreigners _ the Nakhodas and other givers of advances are mostly subjects of the Shaikh, but these in their turn get advances from foreigners. We must all realise that no more money will come into Bahrein for a considerable time, probably at least a year. TTow are the divers to be kept from starvation during the Winter- The co-operation of all who give advances ^ is necessary. Further the Shaikh must consider that 9 he will have to take steps to preserve order. I suggest that he should earnestly set himself to the raising of a police force of at least 100 armed men who must be disciplined and under good strong trust- ^ worthy officer.Dont tako tha filing of casea too seriously # Fo on© will v/orrv mu h if you decide oasoB as they come up even if you snould ina iv ^rtently adjudicate on a ohos© Jup-ee'^ and the publication of the Bahrain Order in Council is postponed to tho ttreak Kalends or at least until the war is over an*! the^' have picked up the pieces and who can say when that will bsl•oeket Teld^raM • Froa Xnox, BuaKir^ • To Xeyes , Bahrain .

Prom Kepea, P»A. Uahreln. To Knox, P.R. imohlre D.O. Dated, 16th August 1914« I find tfreat difficulty in arriving at aoourate otatiatios relating to the finanoinp of the pearl induatry, aa the Bahrein Nakhodae, eapeoially thd Doairia, have alwaya adopted the policy of koepinp; ua ignorant, and the operationa of the Hindua who finance the induatry are of courae inacrutable# But there ia C 0^ i/um* 6*^4 6^ no doubt that only -'&lt;30 of IsHtt- yeare anount^haa been apent in Bahrein thia aeaaon# and that moat of that haa gone into the handa of brokera who wore already inlebted to induo. Monaieur Habib who iirmorted over 100 f 000 aoverigna laat year believea that there ia a great deal of gold buried in Bahrein, but I dont think he realisea the extent to which the Hinlua get it out of the laland in their private baggage* I judge the exiatenoe of oaah by watching the rnethod of the larger boat ownera in buying aupplieo of rice for the aecond fiahlng, and, aa far aa I can judge, there are with the exception of. Shaikh laa 'a wife, who haa acme 8 or S lalrha of rupeea in aov- ereigna and gold omaisenta, at preaent only three or four men with any capital. he other boat ownera are undoubtedly hard put to it oven to provide the very anall advancea they are riving for the aecond fishing which begina imniediately after Ramazan# The Hindua have stopped advancea altogether. mm On the declaration of war there was aometMnr like a panic and pricea began to jump* It waa an awkward time,aa boatovmora were buying in atock for the aecond fiahing and riving advances in oaah and kind# The Araba approached me through v i/ouf T 'anoo asking me to advlae the Shaikh to atop the export of food stuffs and fix prices. I told them that Shaikh Isa had better take the initic-tiveinitiative. He did 00; and, infltead of an absolute prohibition, I agreed to a proolanation prohibiting the export of food o tuff without a permit# 3haikh laa agreed to abide by my advice in givin^ peimita. I aleo agreed toJhis^fixing roaximtOM ratos for foodstuffs when things had settled down a bit. The Hindus at onoe oame to me howling ^hat they would be ruined - their rioe trade was a transit trade - moat of their rice was of a sort unsaleable in Bahrein etc. I pointed out that any rioe was good enough for a hungry man, that permits oould be obtained; and told them I would con sider issuing permits when they have given me a statement show ing rice in stock - rice en route - Bahrein sales and transit sales. This they would not do as they did^t want to give away trade secrets. Today I hold a meeting and fixed prices of all foodstuffs. Vhe Arab and Persian merchants played up, but the Hinduo were very unhappy. I huve aosured them that the prohi bition is only temporary to al^p^T panic, that it will be re moved as soon as foodstuffs come in freely, and that the rates will bo varied as occasion requires. I an not anxious '-bout the actual stocks of foodstuffs, though I see that the Rangoon rioe market is closed and that shipping nay bo difficult to arrange. Dates will be at bottom prices and plentiful, and Basrah wheat ought to be plentiful, 'he decline in the purcha sing power of the people is the danger. The panic has been allayed for the time, and I think wi'll get all the divers out to the second fishing without any trouble. 3o much for the immediate future which is v/hat worried the 1 Bahreinis. 'That worries me, though the Arabs dent see it yet, is the absolute certainty that, whatever the course of the war, no money will be forthcoming for pearls till next season (June 1915); and I doubt if, under the most favourable circumatanc«»«, there will be any then. This means that at the division of profits in October there will be absolutely nothing to go round.

Gentlemen, Yours faithfully Captain,The Agency, Bahrein,the 26th August 1914 The news frornBaghdad and Basrah had very little effect here at first. The last two or three iays of Ramzan there was some talk in the^tfaller Mosques about the detention of the two Turkish ships which were build ing in England#According to one of the Basrah papers they were bought and paid for with the life's blood of Muhammedans. Last night a Basri made an excited speech to a crowd' in the bazaar on the subject. The W SARDAR' brought news yesterday that Basrah was closed to foreign »3hipping. This has excited the lower class people in the bazaar a little; but I think that,though there is an enthusiasm one way or another, the dasire on the whole is that the Germans should be crushed as soon as^ossible and Paris and London be at liberty to buy pearls again. The Shaikhl^Qazis,Dawasir and big merchants are full of protestations of loyalty. I hope that over 70 per cent of the boats will start for the 2nd fishing in a few days. Do you think that it would be any use suggesting to Foreign that the American Consul General should be informed that there will be a magnific^efe chance of buying pearls on a large scale from October on. By than there should be a million pounds worth available and certainly the first quarter of that would go at l/3 to of the prices current befor&lt; the war. If an Major S. G, Knox, G.I.E. Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, BUS f ^ jIf an Araerioan buyer cam© ho should be told to bring specie from Bombay. I could arrange a house etc.for him and give him some useful information. There will be i little Bombay money for pearls I gather f but not enough to prevent a really nasty situation from Dubai to Kuwait, My first letters and telegrams after the war were written at great presure to catoh the mail,and I find I have made a slip: it was the year before last that a million came ine for pearls; this led to Kreat extra- cJ* vagar^and Ifcart ^year being a bad year,everyone was hard up at the beginning of this saason. In triy first demi-official I wrote of the possibility of asking for an increase of the Agency guard. I did not mean that more men would be necessary to protect the Agency, but that they might be wanted to help the Shaikh keep order among the foreigners. It is a great nuisance Basrah being closed as I cant repatriate the badmash Kurds of whom there are a great many her©. Is there any chance of British India boats going to Muhammerah soon? W© are still practically without news, has been very unpleasant for some time - extraordinarily damp- but there is a bit of a 'shamal* to-day which makes it more bearable.

My dear Keyes , Many thanks for your letter of the 26th August on the subject of the attitude of Bahrein towards the war • T doubt if it would be any good to approach the American Consul-general on the question of the state of the pearl-market , as I make no doubt that money is almost , if not quite , as tight in New York as everywhere else • It is a common-place in the pearl trade that war knocks down the price of pearls &lt;&gt; It was so in the war between China and Japan and one would think that such a war could have had no effect at all • As regards your difficulties in repatriating Kurds , I am now inviting British steamers to visit Muhammerah but I have to tell them that there is still a slight risk involved and I cannot tell how they will take that . Lyle of Grey Mackenzie at Basra was for taking no risks in that direction • But , when he sees rivals accepting that risk , he will # I daresay 9 change his tune • I have just returned from a visit up-river to guage the situation for myself . It is , I think , doing the Turis in these parts a deal of good to realise how entirely they depend on the goodwill of the British and they will soon lose their pro-German proclivities „ The Reuters news continues good • I have just heard that H.M^'s Navy have sunk Scruisers and 2 destroyers off Heligoland • None of our ships were sunk • *No • ^ H r | Of 1914.

After Cornplimenta, I have reoeived your letter enoloainr one from Qazi Shaikh Jaaim about the misdeeds of Baaris. First I must point out that the 11 oases mentioned by the Qazi are really two. One thief was a Basri and one a Persian of Linpah. I have however sentenced several men in the last month. The Qazi and the men he employed were extremely oleTerin oatohinp the thieves and recovering the property. I trust you will rt&gt;^rard those whom the Qazi recommendsr \ You will remember that 2\ months apo the day before I left in the IT.*'.S. 'Fox' for the pearl banks, I told your son, Shaikh Abdullah, that I thought there were too many bad characters among the Baaria and Kurda in .Manama, and that I would do my beat to abate thia nuisance. When I returned from the pearl banka Ramzan waa befrinninp and it was Inmossibli to secure the asaiatance of your officiali Then came the war, and Baarah waa cloaed to ahipa.

The men at present employed are nearly all foreigners, themselves bad characters. Nothing less|than a body of 50 men of \ your own subjoots will bo able to keep order in Manama when the divers return.

It is hardly necessary for me to remind you that the most effective way of dealing with the dis turbance of public feeling, which is inevitable in circumstances like the present, is to show the utr ost readiness and consideration in meeting the legitimate demands upon Government. Captain T.H.Keyes, I.A., Political Agent, Bahrain.CONFIDENTIAL. 'Note covering a Memorandum on certain joints relating to currency and savings hank questions. In certain parts of India, the present crisis has resulted in some measure of popular anxiety regarding the capacity of the Government to repay their postal savings bank depositors and to cash currency notes on demand. This anxiety, which is not unnatural among a public entirely uninstructed in the techni calities of currency matters, has also been exaggerated by the action of the Indian trading community, in some places, in casting doubts upon the convertibility of currency notes, and refusing to accept them in daily transactions or only doing so at an immoderate discount. In the latter class of cases a desire to make a profit out of the circumstances of the present crisis has probably been a much more potent influence than any real apprehension as to the convertibility of the note issue, for the trading community itself has not in fact brought its notes to the currency offices in any large quantity to be cashed. 2. It is probable that these feelings of apprehension will die away as depositors and currency noteholders see in practice that the Government do in fact meet their demands, however large. Experience in Bombay points in this direction. 3. There is, however, the possibility that in particular parts of India theJeeling may be a growing one, especially if fomented by interested or unfriendly influences. The Government have, therefore, considered what steps can usefully be taken to deal with this state of feeling when it actually presents itself. 4. The Government of India have already issued certain communiques in regard to their strong financial position in the face of the present crisis {mde the two ♦Enclosure No. I. announcements attached*) and they are averse from a spontaneous dissemination of further reassuring statements on these questions, partly because these will not be always understood, and partly because they might spread alarm in those localities where public feeling is not yet seriously uneasy. It is to t»e tEnciosureNo.il. definitely understood therefore that the attached memorandumf [to which refer ence is made in paragraph 5 (3) below] is not under any circumstances to be published in the Press, or exhibited as a public notice at district offices, crtc. It is meant solely for the assistance of officers on whom it may fall to give personal oral explanations on these matters to those who question them, or to others whom they may think it desirable to reassure. 5. Where, however, there are clear indications of incipient trouble over these matters, the following action may, in the view of the Government of India, be use fully taken :— (1) The local District and Postal authorities must indent freely for funds for their treasuries and post offices to enable them to meet any demand which is likely to arise immediately. The point here is to get ample funds for the immediate future, but not to ask for money to cover requirements for a long time ahead, the estimating for which must be wholly speculative. The telegraph should be freely used where this is thought desirable. (2) Every possible facility should be given to meet demands as they come forward. Savings bank depositors should be given back their money without hindrance or discouragement. The practice of the district treasuries in regard to the encashment of currency notes should be made more liberal rather than the reverse, and the treasury might be kept open for a longer period than usual, if that is needed to cope with applicants already present and waiting. (3) Every opportunity should be taken by superior officers who can be trusted to act with discretion, to explain to the people at the treasury, or in the bazars, and so forth, quietly and not to&lt;J) insistently, that there exist C(W.)94rinD2 absolutely no grounds for apprehension ; that Government keep large stores of money to meet these very demands ; and are willing to go on meeting them till every applicant is satisfied. Such explanations might follow the general lines of the attached memorandum, in which an attempt has been made to deal, in a wholly elementary way, with those points on which difficulty is perhaps most likely to be felt. (4) If trouble arises through the refusal of the local traders to accept notes or to accept them at their full value, the matter will be one probably requiring the personal attention of the District Magistrate or head of the police in the same way as an unwarrantable increase of food prices. Influence should be brought to bear on the leaders of the local trading community, and it should be made clear to them that, in thus preju dicing the note issue, they are acting the part of public enemies, and that their action is viewed with extreme dissatisfaction by the Government and by the local authorities as their representatives. Any powers which these authorities possess for preventing the deliberate fomentation of mischief should be exercised.Enclosure No. I. Notification No. 1064-F., dated Simla, the 3rd August 1914, by the Government of India, Finance Department. The following announcement is published for general information :— The Governnent of India announce, with the approval of the Secretary of State, that they will support exchange by all the means in their power. (1) In pursuance of this policy they will sell sterling bills on London, from this week onwards and until further notice, up to a maximum limit of £l million a week, at the rate of Is. 3||cL the rupee. Any applicant to whom an allotment is made can, at his option, instead of bills, receive telegraphic transfers, at a rate which is fixed for the present at Is. the rupee, for the amount allotted to him or any portion thereof, pro vided that the intention to exercise such option has been intimated in his original application. The amount of bills issued wall be in multiples of £1,000 and no single bill will be issued for a smaller amount than £10,000. Bills will be issued at Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras. All applications should be addressed to the Controller of Currency at Calcutta, and should reach him not later than 12 noon (standard time) on Thursday in each week, beginning from the current week. Applications may be made by telegram. Supplementary detailed instructions will be issued by the Controller of Currency. (2) Secondly, in view of the necessity for conserving all available resources for the support of exchange, the Government of India direct that for the present no gold shall be issued, whether from the currency offices or treasuries, in amounts of less thn £10,000 for any individual applicant. This condition will have effect from Tuesday, August 4th. Press Communique, dated the 8th August 1914. The exchange crisis finds the Government in an exceptionally strong position. Their total supplies of actual gold at the time that issues in India ceased amounted to over £21 million, distributed almost equally between England and India. In addi tion, the Secretary of State holds at the credit of the Gold Standard Reserve a con siderable body of short-term securities, the maturing of some of which in the current month is already giving him substantial assistance. In order to make the real position in regard to the Gold Standard Reserve as clear as possible, it has been decided to carry out at once the recommendation made by the Royal Commission on Indian Finance and Currency that £4 million of the gold held in the Paper Currency Reserve should be transferred to the Gold Standard Reserve in India, in exchange for the Rs. 6 crores which has hitherto been held in the latter as an emergency reserve against sudden demands for rupee coinage. The Gold Standard. Reserve accordingly now consists wholly of gold and sterling securities. The weekly sale of sterling bills and transfers on London implies a credit to the Gold Standard Reserve in India against the corresponding withdrawal of gold from the Gold Standard Reserve at Home. It has been decided that so long as gold is available in the Paper Currency Reserve, the credit in India shall be made^entirely in gold, and not in rupees as was done in 1908. This credit will be effected from time to time as the corresponding payments in England are actually made by the Secretary of State to the payees on whose behalf the sterling bills or transfers have been pur chased. The position in regard to rupees is also unusually strong. Owing to various circumstances, such as the fact that weakness of exchange has greatly restricted the 'Secretary of State's council drawings in the last few months ; that the recentfive-crore loan has been paid up by the holders much more promptly than it need have been ; and that the closing balance of 1913-14 was somewhat higher than the Government of India had been able to anticipate when the budget was framed ; the aggregate Government cash balances at the close of July exceeded Rs. 30 crores, being nearly Rs. 7 crores more than the original forecast made for this date. Again, the paper currency holding of rupees at the beginning of August amounted to the quite abnormal sum of Rs. 34 crores as compared with Rs. 20 crores at the same period last year. This, moreover, will be further supplemented by the rupees received weekly through the sale of bills and by the 6 crores of rupees which, as stated above, are to be at once transferred from the Gold Standard Reserve.Enclosure No. II. MEMORANDUM. (1) Why have the Government stopped issuing gold ?—Because the gold can be used in ways more beneficial to India than by its dispersion in small quantities to individual applicants who like to keep their savings in this form. The orders stopping the issue of gold in India have no connection with the extra expenditure which the British Government has to incur because of the war. The gold held by Government in India is being retained by Government for two purposes : firstly, to provide funds for their ordinary expenditure in England, such as they incur there on behalf of India every year ; and secondly, to help the merchants and banks who wish to make remittances to England. The explanation as regards the first of these points is as follows. Government require to have funds in England to pay the interest on the money out of which the railways and canals have been constructed ; to purchase railway material and stores for the various departments ; to pay the pensions and leave allowances of their officers ; and so on. In ordinary times it is not necessary to ship any money from India to England to meet this expenditure, because while the Secretarv of State requires to have money at home for the purposes mentioned, on the other hand there are British merchants and banks in London who want to send money to India to pay for the foodstuffs and other exports which India has sent to England, and also for investment in Indian trade and industries. The Secretary of State takes over the money from these merchants and banks, and so obtains.the funds which he requires in London ; and, on the other hand, the Government in India pay the representatives of these merchants and banks the same amount of money in India, and they thus obtain in this country the funds which they would otherwise have been obliged to ship there. The shipment of money is thus avoided by both parties. In times of crisis and disorganised trr de like the present, this procedure cannot always be followed. There is a great demand for money in England, and the British merchants and banks in London, so far from wanting to send any more money to India, may even find it necessary to get back from India some 'of the funds they have already invested there. Thus the Secretary of State cannot be sure of finding people who will pay him funds in London on account of their Indian transactions, and when that is the case, the Government of India may ha^e to ship money from India to London to meet his requirements. The money so shipped must be gold, for it would be no use sending rupees, as these are not current in England. Accordingly, at a time when there is any likelihood of the Secretary of State wanting the Government of India to ship gold to him, the latter must keep sufficient gold in India for this purpose ; and if they let all their gold go out in exchange for rupees to individuals in this country, they will have nothing but rupees left to send home. Similarly as regards the second of the two objects stated above. As already mentioned, British merchants and banks send a great deal of money into India in prosperous years to be applied to undertakings beneficial to India. But in times of crisis, they may want to send a portion of these funds back to England to help their head offices in London. In their case too, what is wanted is gold, as rupees will be no use to them out of India. Government have to help them in doing this, because, if a merchant or bank who sent money to India in prosperous years could not be sure of getting it back when it was needed in less favourable years, he would not be willing to send money to India again in the future. The gold which Govern ment have in India will thus be available for this purpose also. It will be seen that neither of these ways of using gold makes Government any poorer or less able to meet all requirements than they would otlwwise have been. If a million pounds worth of gold is sent to London for use by banks and merchants there, these banks pay to Government in India the exact equivalent, namely, 150 lakhs of rupees. Similarly if Government had refrained from stopping the issue of gold and had given out another million to applicants at the currency offices, they would have received from these applicants the same amount, namely 150 lakhs of rupees. Or again, if Government sei\d a million pounds of f;old to England to meet the expenditure of the Secretary of State, they part with money in India to the value of 150 lakhs of rupees, just as they^do under the ordinary procedure C (W.) 94FiuD6 when merchants, etc., in London pay money to the Secretary of State and Government here give out 150 lakhs of rupees to the representatives of the same mer chants in India. Government are no poorer and no richer in either case by using one method rather than another. But to use the gold in the manner described promotes confidence and assists trade, and enables merchants to carry on the export trade in which the Indian agriculturist is so much interested. (2) If Government have stopped giving out gold, may they not also stop giving rupees ? —No. There is no connection between the question of issuing gold and that of issuing rupees. On the contrary, as has just been shown, by using gold in the manner described, Government either get more rupees, or are enabled to keep rupees which they would otherwise have had to disburse ; and they will always give out rupees to anybody who is entitled to claim a payment from them. Besides persons who have claims against Government in respect of ordinary transactions, e.g., those who have supplied labour, stores or foodstuffs to any Depart ment, the people who have the right to demand rupees from Government are those who have savings in the Post Office Savings Bank and those who hold currency notes. These are Government debts to the people, which they hold themselves absolutely obliged to pay whenever they are asked to do so. The case is quite different with gold. Government have never promised to give gold to anybody who wants it: they only do so when they have plenty to spare. But they have promised, quite definitely, to give the savings banks depositors their money back whenever they require it, and to change notes into rupees whenever the holders of notes want cash instead of paper, and go to the proper place, i.e., the currency office, to get it. (3) How do Government manage to cash any notes which are presented to them?— By keeping the money which they received for the notes and holding it in readiness to pay back to the holders of notes whenever it is wanted. The money which Government receive for the notes which they issue is kept entirely separate from the ordinary balances from which they meet their ordinary expenditure. Government also publish every week a statement showing how and where this money is held. Though the ordinary public are not interested in these statements in normal times, merchants and banks watch them carefully and satisfy themselves that Government are always in a position to cash their notes. (4) How do Government find the money for paying off the savings hank depositors ?— ^ Because they keep a large balance of cash ready (among other purposes) for any claims which their depositors may make on them. In addition to the money which Government hold to pay off the people who have currency notes, they have a large quantity ready for their general requirements. Much of this is scattered over the district treasuries in the country, the remainder being held in their large Reserve treasuries in Calcutta, Madras, and Bombay, and also by the Bank of Bengal, the Bank of Bombay, and the Bank of Madras on their account. The actual deposits of savings bank depositors all over India amount to 20 crores or a little over, and Government have at this moment some 30 crores of money in their general balances in India, besides what they have in their paper currency reserve and what they have in their general balances in England. (5) Why, then, is there this feeling of alarm in some cases ?—It is mere foolish ness, since there is no ground for any apprehension in the matter. The first consideration with Government has always been, not to earn a large profit on any money received from the public, but to make themselves absolutely sure of being able to give this money back to the public when it is wanted; they have known that it is in times like these that the money will be wanted back; and they have j-ealised that no one can tell when such times will come; and they have therefore kept themselves in a strong position all along. If interested persons in the bazaars say that a currency note is no longer worth what it professes to be, they are stating what they know to be untrue. If any person owes money to anybody else and offers notes in payment, the creditor is obliged by law to take them ; and if a tradesman refuses to do so, he is acting contrary to the law and causing mischief and alarm simply in order to get a little profit through the discount which he charges.The Government are stronger'than any private institution, and keep their money more safely than any private person can do ; and the people who take their money away from the Post Office Savings Bank, etc., are merely running the risk of losing it by keeping it in their own custody. But if they want to do so, Government will put no hindrance in their way and will pay the full amount which ' may be asked for, however large it may be. In Bombay the savings bank depositors were alarmed in this way, and took out a portion of their deposits. Government paid the money at once, and everybody who asked for payment received it; and the people'in Bom bay, seeing that there was no difficulty in getting the money, have now to a large extent recovered from their apprehension. Similarly, in Madras, notwithstanding that Government do not always undertake to cash currency notes at their district treasuries (though they do at special currency offices kept up for this purpose), they are not only cashing notes at the treasury but at post offices in the city of Madras as well; and so with other places. Government are not only willing to pay out the sums demanded by the public, but are anxious to give every facility in the matter. N V c I \ r r* A fCONFIDENTIAL.

Knox, C I.E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Foreign Secretay to the Government of India, Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to state that reports have reached me from the Political Agent. Bahrain, in which he indicates to me grave anxiety as to the condition of the pearling ports during the coming cold season. It seems hardly necessary to dwell in much detail on how the present condition of affairs has been brought about. Last season was a poor one and the pearling industry in the spring of 1914 was at alow ebb. This season is far worse and the distress will be acute. The Political Agent estimates that only 3 l 0 -th of last year's amount has been spent in Bahrain this season and most of that has gone into the hands of brokers who were already indebted to Hindu traders. We are faced with two great difficulties. The Political Agent estimates that, taking the most favourable figures, there will be 15,000 divers who will have to keep themselves and their families from November to May. Of these men, the Political Agent estimates that 10,000 will remain on the islands. To sum up we shall, I think, have to arrange for— (1) the repatriation of 5.000 pearlers ; (2) grants in aid of sustenance tor 10,000 pearlers. With regard to (1), I am entering into correspondence with the British India Steam Navigation Company in regard to a reduction of fares to selected divers for 2 months from 1st October. The Political Agent has suggested the following reductions. He understands that present prices of deck tickets are:— To Bahrain. Bushire. Basrah. Lingah. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. From Debai ... ... ••• 5 7 »3 - 4 From Bahrain ... ... ... ... 6 9 5 It is suggested that these tickets be reduced to— _ r To Bahrain. Bushire. Basrah. Lingah. Rs. Rs. Rs. Rs. From Debai ... ... 3 4 7 2 From Bahrain • ... ... 2 5 3 It is extremely doubtful if the Company will agree to any reduction of the kind, as pearlers are not popular passengers: they give a great deal of trouble and do not pay the Company. In the circumstances and taking into considera tion the importance at this juncture of keeping order in Bahrain, I venture to put forward the proposal that Government should lend to selected foreign pearlers on the security of their nakhudas the difference in the fares, it will benoticed that the reductions do not amount to an average of Rs. 5 per ticket and the sum involved is thus Rs. 25,000. Even if the security is shaky, the price it is proposed to pay for the removal of 5,000 turbulent characters from Bahrain is a cheap one. The loan should, I propose, be without interest. The next question is what I have called grants in aid of sustenance for the 10,000 pearlers who remain. The legitimate solution is for Shaikh Isa to provide relief works for them. The Political Agent says ' As far as I can judge, there are, with the exception of Shaikh Isa's wife, who has some 2 or 3 lakhs of rupees in sovereigns and gold ornaments, at present only 3 or 4 men with any capital. The casual labour that the island, in its impoverished state, will be able to provide, must be supplemented by other means '. His suggestion is that the form this relief work should take is the reclam ation of land' along the sea front, from the rent of which the loan could be repaid in a few years. I consider that this is probably the most useful form that the relief work could take, and I would suggest that it should be approached in the following way. The Political Agent should remind Shaikh Isa of the obliga tions of a ruler in times of scarcity and suggest his scheme to him. It is almost certain that Shaikh Isa will have nothing to do with it. He should then be authorised to offer Shaikh Isa a loan of 1 lakh of rupees without interest from the Government of India for the purpose secured on the land that is to be reclaimed and finally on the Customs revenues repayable in 10 years. It is hardly likely that Shaikh Isa will welcome this proposal any more than the first and then the only course open to us would be to say to Shaikh Isa that, as he evidently entire ly failed to realise what were the obligations of a ruling Shaikh we intended to carry out the undertaking ourselves, to reclaim the land and treat it as our own. This might make him reconsider his attitude and, if it fails to do so, nothing re mains exceot to carry out our threat. I consider that the political Agent has brought to notice a very real danger to the peace and security of Bahrain and that our assistance, at this juncture, will do much to earn us the gratitude of the Bahrain propulation. I hope that it will not be necessary to expend the large amount involved and do not disguise from myself the risk that we shall not see much of our money back again but the importance of keeping Bahrain quiet and peaceable in these times of trouble, is very real and in the confident hope that the measures proposed will effect this end, I venture to recommend them to the benevolent consideration of the Govern ment of India.

Knox, C .I .E., Officiating Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign and Political Department, Simla. I have the honour to report on the subject of your telegram No. 797-S., dated 24th September 1914, regarding distressed pearlers at Bahrein, and I am glad to be able to state that,from conversations with the Political Agent and Shaikh Isa, the situation appears to be much less acute, and I have good reason to hope that Bahrein will be fully competent to deal with its local troubles unaided. A number of circumstances have assisted in bringing about this happy result. 2. When the pearlers returned for the month of Ramzan, the prospect looked very black indeed and many of the pearlers returned to Al -A 1 3a and Basrah immediately. Those who went to Al-Ahsa did not return in any strength consider ing that the season offered no further prospects and the riverain pearlers were unable to do so owing to the steamers of the British India Steam Navigation Company being taken off the run and unable to proceed to Basrah. The result was that the Bahrein fleet had to start on its after Ramzan fishing actually short of pearlers and it follows that, when the question of getting rid of, or providing for, the pearlers will arise, the numbers to be reckoned with will be much smaller than has been anticipated. The British India Steam Navigation Company have been most kind in replying in the affirmative to my request on behalf of distressed pearlers, only stipulating that our local officers shall give all possible assistance in preserving order at the port, a pledge I did not hesitate to give them. 3. Finally, the Political Agent has been able to report that Shaikh Isa has, at least verbally, thoroughly accepted his responsibility for the poor pearlers, by the fruits of whose arduous labours Bahrein exists, and it appears that a successful appeal has also been made to the cupidity of the Shaikhha, the millionaire of the Islands, f was much impressed at my recent visit by the thoroughly cordial relations that appear to exist between Shaikh Isa and his new Political Agent. Captain Keyes was able to give me what is, I believe, quite unprecedented in the history of Bahrein, an entirely satisfactory report of Shaikh Isa's conduct -and amenability since he took over charge. 4. A recent instance of this which will be duly reported m the proper place is a spontaneous offer by Shaikh Isa of a subscription of Rs. 5,000 to the Prince of Wales' Fund for the relief of distress in England caused by the war. This is such a strikingly novel departure on the part of a Shaikh whom one has been accustomed for years to regard as avaricious, selfish and obstructive, that, to use a homely phrase, it took my breath away. At our interview last Tuesday Shaikh Isa personally assured me that he was thoroughly mindful^ of his responsibility towards the pearling population and would do his best during the coming cold season to reduce their sufferings as much as possible. 5. I carried away from Bahrein the most pleasant impression of the state of affairs there. C119 F. D.— 44— 22 «I0 -T4—GCBP Sinalia5th.

Keyes, I A. Political Agent, Bahrein, Lieut. Colonel S.G.Knox, C I,E.,I # A«, Political Resident In the Persian Gulf. Dated, Bahrein, ith. November, 1914. Sir, I have the honour to address you on the subject of the services rendered by Shaikh Abdullah, the third son of Shaikh Isa. When I arrived In Bahrein I f^und that Shaikh Isa had re- -cently adopted a defiant attitude in the matter of the Bahrein Customs (vide correspondence ending wit Govt, of India letter No.691 of July i3th. to your address), am a perusal of the Agency records showed that he had fre- - quently written to my predecessors In a similar strain. These objectionable letters were nearly all drafted by ore man, Jaslm Charawl, who Is connected with the firm All bin Ibrahim Zayanl, brokers to Messers Rosenthal. The members of this group have, I gather, been always somewhat hostile to British Interests, though, I believe, without the knowledge of Messers Rosenthal. I at first arranged with Shaikh Abdullah that no Important letters were to be drafted by Jaslm Charawl, and then that all letters on debateable questions were to be sent to me for approval before being sealed by . Shaikh Isa. In return I occasionally sent Shaikh Isa drafts of letters I proposed to write him. When Monsieur Hablb of Messers Rosenthal was leav- -Ing Bahrein on the outbreak of war he, at my request. J C Awarned All t)ln Ibrahim not to worK against ua, and I also got ShalXh Abdullah to warn Mlm. In the difficult ne- -gotiations ensuing on the collapse of the pearl narKet I met with some assistance from this group. In fact they and Shaikh Abdullah were the only people into whom it was possible to instil an appreciation of the economic situation. The difficulties fitting out the pearling fleet for the second fishing were overcome largely by Shaikh Abdullah's efforts § and, when the fleet had been started off, it was entirely through him and his mother, ShaiXh Isa^ only surviving wife, that Shaikh Is a was brought to see his responsibilities towards the large numbers of divers who will be hard put to it to weather the winter 3, You are already aware of the generous donations' amounting to Rs,®600 given by Shaikh Isa's family to our charitable War Funds, The moving spirit in this matter was Shaikh Abdullah, 4, Shaikh Abdullah has al^o given me great assist -ance in quarantine business; and, by keeping an eye on the Amir of Uanama, has prevent3d many abuses in the ad- -ministration of justice. The process serving for the the Agency Court, which formerly left much to be desired^ is now as satisfactory as thit of most Courts in India. 5, When Shaikh Isa was Informed of the arrival of the troops his attitude was at first all that could be desired, and he placed Shaikh Abdullah at my disposal to assist in making arrangements. The assistance he gave me was very valuable. The next day Snaikh Isa, who was ill, was beset by crowd* of his subjects protest- -ing against the landing of troops. The objectors were too much for him, and he passed them on to Shaikh Abdullah who hmdlad them very well. From then till the day the transports sailed he had a difficult time.The people were convinced thnt If tne troopa once landed Baiiraln'a lnd6pendence was gone for good, and It seomed impoaaible to allay their fears. 6, When the outbreaK of war between Great Britain and TurKey was announced the intense hatred for Russia that is prevalent in those parts outweighed all feelings of loyalty to us with the great majority of the people, and so far, with the exception of Shaikh Isa^ family and immediate entourage, including the group I have mentioned above, we have hardly a sympathiser in these Islinds, 7, In my opinion Shaikh Abdullah's services in b bringing his father to a more reasonable frame of mind, in assisting in purifying the administration, in advising his father well in the matter of the economic situation, in standing out against the demnstrations against the 1 nding of troops, and finally in remaining actively loyac to us in face of tno unfriendly attitude of practically the whole population of the Islands is deserving of pro- -nounced recognition, I do not consider that the be- -stowal of a O.I.E, would ade uately meet the case, and I trust that, as his services are not connected with India alone, you Trill recommend him for the C.U.G. If the Government of India should be nloased to recommend ShaikhJtea' for an order, I hope that it may be bestowed among the Sew. Year Honours. Spoedy recognition of his services would go a long way to gain over the waverers am those who are at present, in the face of strong Uuhammmadan feeling, afraid to declare their loyalty. I have the honour to be. Sir, your most obedient servant. ft Captain, Political Agent, Bahrein.Vi^rtY CONFI D^rr IAL Bushire , Persian Gulf 10-11-14.

Not 35,0, a:vii:i5. . Wltft reference to correspondence ending with my 41,C. of 50:XI;14, the distress last winter was less severe than I anticipated In spite of the continued export of specie. Divers and coolies continued to leave Bahrain till the outbreak of plague in Baceraber, when hundreds of Persians also left. PlagUe further reduced the population by some 5000. There was then a slight revival of trad^, and the ^rofit^ in goffee and tea were so good that several merchants took advantage of the cheapness of the labour market to collect stones and build, thus giving work to numbers of the most indigent. There was also a market for household articles, old clothes etc, and it was not till February that any paople were entirely witho^ resources. Two or three merchants, notably Salman Din Matar, then made large don- -atlons of rice and dates, and work was found for some men m by the Agency, In the early spring there w.*?3 a sudden revival of tne pearl market in Bomoay. The spring advances to the divers were only settled after much negotiation (It is interesting to note that they were made almost entirely in gold)/ out eventually all were provided for. one Jfiuropean buyer on oehalf of ilessers Rosenthal, and sev- -eral Hindus have come to Banrain. Tne Boifiuay market is 3Ub ;)ect to rapid and violent fluctuations, out sufficient ousiness is being done to prevent any distress this year.Dated 9tli September 191 To Shaikh Abdullah bin Isa, Bahrain, I received with pleasure ycnfr friendly letter of 19th Shawal 1333 in which you express your sense of tke high honour which has 'been conferred on you by His Majesty the King Emper6r, and your sincere feelings of loyalty.
