If it includes every thing I take it that the government will be under no liabi lity to handle or incur any expenses whatsoever in connection with it.

Should the Eastern and Gen eral Syndicate desire to naJce use of this they will naturally are be lalble to the saae fees as paid by the public for ordinary merchandise. 4.

M's Political Agent, Bahrain. '^1 -m - *f , Sir, I have the honour to enclose a copy of a Memo randum addressed to me by the Director of Customs referring to the Bahrain Petroleum Company's exemp tion from Customs Duty and Import Yard Charges. The question has lately arisen, owing to the Director of Customs 1 action in placing some of the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ imports in the Import shed instead of leaving them outside on the pier, as to who is responsible for paying the porterage incurred in moving the packages. I have discussed the matter with the Director of Customs and Mr. Russell of Messrs. The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltd., the company's agent. fj I consider that the Bahrain Petroleum Company has incurred all the liabilities and enjoys all the privileges specified under the terms of the original concession granted to the Eastern and General Syndicate. ^ Certain correspondence passed some years ago between me and H. B. M's Political Agent, then Major Ax / i ^ Ax-2- Major Barrett, defining the position of the Eastern and General Syndicate in regard to Customs dues and other charges, apart from the 5^ import tax about which there has never been any question. Your letter No. 613 dated ^ seems to define the position clearly and according to the letter the Company are evidently liable to pay porterage. They themselves at that time agreed to this. The matter now in dispute seems to be whether the Director of Customs is at liberty to move the Bahrain Petroleum Company cargo from the pier into the import shed, or to any other part of the pier, as he thinks fit, in fact to take it in charge as though it was ordinary dutiable cargo, or, whether it is not dutiable he is compelled to leave it where it is placed by the Company. ^ I am of the opinion tnat the Director of Customs has every right to move cargo from place to place on the Customs premises, storing it where he considers most suitable and that the expenditure incurred in moving the cargo should be defrayed by the Company, it is assumed that the Director of Customs will not move any cargo unless in his opinion it is genuinely necessary that the cargo should be moved and also that if the Company provide coolies, which is their practice on some occasions, they shall not be charged porterage dues. \ I should be obliged if you would give me your views on the matter which I heve described. I have the honour to be. Sir, Your Obedient Servant, Adviser to the Government.True Cojy. THE GIJSTOMHOTJSE, . . BAKRAIN:- GT/BPC, 1/323. 6th November 1932 7th Rajab 1351.

M's Political Agent, in regard to the position of the Bahrain Petroleum Company Ltd., as regards their liability for payment of Cusxoms Duty and Import Yard Charges here. It apnears that the Bahrain Oil Concession granted on 2nd Deer., 1925 to The Eastern and General Syndicate, ]td., nrovided for ^free importation of all material .. including office requirements .... but not including personal requirements of employees....' Letter No. 613 from the Political Agent stages that TT The Eastern and General Syndi9ate are prepared to Pay Khanchia on such goods as remain in Customs charge a period exceeding ten days and ^b) they are prenared to pay porterage charges as specified under the Lindal s contract ,T Imports have been arriving here for the Bahrain Petroleum Comnany steadily since May 1931, and these have been dealt with generally in a spirit of mutual convenience, and a number of minor concessions in working have been allowed. It is, however, the practice to take into charge all packages of ordinary size, notably in the case of the two last steamers* and the payment of the porterage incurred on their removal has been claimed. Phis payment has been resisted by the local agents oi the Bahrain Petro. leum Co. (The Mesopotamia Persia Corporation, Ltdj who, strangely enough, declare that the Customs have no right to touch any cargo of the Banco which is not dutiable, and state that this is upon the authority of the Company s local Manager, Major Frank Holmes, whp, it is said, re gards the above stipulations as applying to tne Eastern &amp; General Syndicate, but not to the Bahrain xetroleum Coy. The point at issue, therefore, appears to be:- To what extent is the Bahrain Petroleum Company liable for Import Yard Charges — not Customs Duty -- upon its non-aut'?^le cargor P.T.O.It also follows( and perhaps it should be stated, or confirmed J that an importer cannot have an option as regards cargo lying on Customs nremises, as to whether such should or should not be removed into cn^rge for the sake of its better protection. Otherwise of course, if such an option were exerciseable by the Bahrain Petroleum Company, it might just as iairiy be exercised by every otner importer, and it would be practically' impossible to keep a proper tally and out turn of the steamer T s cargo. T suggest that it would be v/ell lor this point to b^ settled now for the sake of avoiding misunderstandmgr i in the future. Sd/ C. C. L. deGrenier. DIRECTOR 0?

The '•ahreiu Petroleum Company do not deny the right of the 'Director of Customs to move their non-dutiable cargo, if in his opinion it is naceesary for him to do so, but they contend that the necessity has never arisen and that no purpose is served in incurring the expenditure, in view of the fact, that the Company are capable of moving the cargo from off the ^i er witnin the period of 10 days allowed than under their concession. They further contend that the TArector of Customs should notify them if at any time after the period of 10 days has expired, he should find it necessary to move the .cargo. Major Holmes, the Company's Oiief xteprese rrt ative informed us that he will take up the matter with you on his return from Koweit on or about the 24th instant, and desises us to state in the meanwhile, that the question of the Eastern &amp; Generalrefers to another concession which they were negotiating tut did not conclude with the Bahrein Goverment and not to the original concession whi di is now held hy the Bahrein petroled Company, youro faithiuliy. 1* * i- Jwfh&gt;„P&amp;kkui \ftlii BAiLiilN MTiJOLaiai COiPANY LL ITjfl), - January 51, 193b, .

Some confusion with the Bahrain State Customs has rocentjly occurred as to the Bahrain Petroleum Company's rights and privileges as expressed in Clause V of the First Schedule of the Concession Agreement of the T3ahrain Oil Concession dated December 2nd f 1925* It therefore, appears to the Company f that it is indicated that the time has arrived when a more clear understanding shculd be reached on the question of Customs# Clause V as referred to above treats with the question of Customs, and it reads as followsi- 'Free importation of materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind necessary for the work carried out by the Company including office requirements, but not including the personal requirements of the employees The degree of immunity f^om Customs duties that may be enjoyed by the Company under Clause V has come specifically into question in the case of a shipment of furniture, fittings and materials - recently imported by the Company from England - to be used in furnishing the Bahrain Petroleum Company^ house and offices situated in I anama. The fUmiture and other articles imported for the above raentioned house and offices are not in any manner 'personal' to any one employee but are for the use of employee or employees as the Companys — requirements demand. Such articles as fUmiture, fittings and materials inrqported by the Company form part of the normal equipment of the Company. All is - in common with other equipment - necessary to place the Company in such circumstance as will enable its employees to perform the multitudinous operations called for in developing the Company^ Oil Concession. The articles in question come under the same category with such equipment as tools of allmotor carc, or any portion of the normal equipment placed for the use of the employees in order that they may be able to carry out the duties allotted to them and for which they were engaged. There is no vestige of 'personal ownership' in tools or furniture, nor is there in this particular importaticn in so far as the employees - apart from the Company - are concerned. Ml equipment imported by the Company and 'considered necessary for the work to be carried out' by the Company - to which description the equipment under discussion- in the opinion of the Company - conforms | is solely the property of the Company* The mere fact that furniture, tools or machines are kcdtn being used or operated by any individual employees durirjg the regular performance of his daily work does not constitute or carry with it - in any sense - the implication that the employees is in possession of a 'personal requirement'# You will gather from this letter that the Company's view is that the Company is within the meaning and intention - in spirit and in fact - of Clause V in holding that no Custom duty is chargeable on furniture and similar articles imported by the Company when such articles are to be used and form part of the equipment of the Company as is the case with the importation under consideration# I shall be pleased if you will deal with the piints raised in this letter as early as convenient to you.

It is not doubted that the goods in question are not the property of the Company. According to clause V of the original agreement the Company enjoys w free importation of materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind necessary for the work carried out by the Company including: office requirementa but not includim r the personal requirements of the employees.' The meaning of the clause V is ambiguous 5 it does not imply that all goods imported by the Company, although actually belonging to the dompany, which are used for tae ^personal requirements'* of the employees, are not liable for duty. It is reasonable to infer that because this clause specifically mentions 'office requirements' which ordinarily would consist of files, typewriters and office furtinure such as t bias, chairs etc., that similar items of furniture which are not office requirements are not free from customs liability. or this reason I suggest that furniture, other than office furniture, is liable for duty. T understand that the words 'office req Jiireraents' were added at the time when the concession was drafted. I'his being so I propose asking Vie Political ^gent to ascertain froin t. le 0Lonial office and inform me what is the correct inter .ret -.tion of clause V in respect of imports of furniture which are not covered by the words 'office requirements'.

Sir, 0 ^ J , /Vc ; y-o I hsve^the lionour to acknowledge your letter No. 0/299 - 28/l dated July 31, 1933, returning copies of lists of imports by the Bahrain Petroleum Company. I enclose a list of imports which in the opinion of the government are not exempt from customs dues according to clause V, Schedule I of the Bahrain Oil Concession which reads as follows.- ^Free importation of materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind necessary for the work carried out by the cwnpany including office requirements, but not including the ■personal requirements of the employees. ,T The contention of the government is that although these goods are the property of the Company, not of individual employees wf^t do not form part of the^materials, apparatus and machinery of every kind4 J 43 -2- kind necessary for the work carried out by the Company' 1 , neither are they ''office requirements' which are specified as being not liable for duty. Many of the items consist of furniture, linen etc. etc. used in the Manager's house in Manamah and the camp at Jebel Dukhan. Clause V specifically excludes ''office requirements' from liability of customs dues, it is presumed that 'office requirements' includes office furniture, typewriters, stationery etc. and if office furniture is sDecially mentioned as being free from liability it is presumed that furniture other than office furniture is not free from liability. ~ j) fb The Company in their letter' dated Jany 31, 1933,1 addressed to me, of which a copy was sent to you, / consider that because the goods imported are the pronerty of the Company not of individual employees and because, in the Company^ opinion, they form part of the necessary equipment of the Company therefore they should be free from customs dues. The government cannot accept the opinion of the Company that all goods, the property of the company^which they may import and which they may consider necessary for the work, shall be free from customs dues because clause V of the concession particularly states that 'personal require ments' do not enjoy this immunity; furthermore the mention of office requirements leads the government to assume that other similar 'requirements*' are liable to customs dues. Another fact which has some bearing on the matter is that the Company has always paid duty on food imported from abroad but this food is supplied to the*4*4 ■3- the employees free of charge. Food, furniture, motor cars used by individual members, gramophone records, and refrigerators all appear to belong to the same category when defining 'Personal requirements of employees 1 * and are supplied freely to the employees yet the company admits that it is liable to pay customs dues on food, but not, for instance on gramo phone records.

Dear Mr.Laithwaite, 'Pollowing rny call upon you on the 4th instant, I am now desired 'by this Company to infom you that whilst the India Office would not, on the one hand, admit any contention that the relevant provisions in the Concession Agreement of 2nd December 1925 permit of the entry into Bahrein, free of import duties, of house furnishings, food, sports and Barnes requisites, it must respectfully urge, on the other hp.nd , that the draughtsman surely contemplated that for prospecting, exploring and development works 'by English, American and other foreign elements, it would 'be necessary not only to give them a house to live in but to furnish the house with essentials, and also to provide them with foods they had been used to, ?nd the means for preserving such foods. The recrention facilities is a more open question. It would pppear, however, thrt the Company has already given way and paid duty on f ood imported and on games and other mepns of recreation for the employees; and it would be n lamentable thing if this question were allowed to become one of importance or a source of friction between the Company pnd the Local Authorities of the Government of Bahrein. Accordingly, I am to suggest to you that whilst you maintain your strict attitude on the question of construction pnd the Company does the same, the Company, through its Local Representative, should endeavour to settle the questions of/ Laithwaite, Esq., Ind ia Off i ce , Whitehall, S.W.I.of the outstanding duties with the Local Authorities concerned on the 'broad principle of give and take. The furnishing of the Manager's house at Manama seems, from what I can understand, to be at the root of the present position, nnd if that is so, tnere should oe little difficulty in sorting out what is an essential furnishing for the Manager, as an employee, leaving the rest of the furnishings to be regarded as 'luxuries', and taxable. I think we have decided that motor cars used by or in the course of the Company's business do not enter into tie question; they are obviously a part of the Campany's equipment, and as such, non-dutieble. If it is convenient to you to communicgte with Bahrein by letter at the end of this week, and you will let me know by telephone, I will write on the lines of t.iis letter to l r r. Skinner as the Company's Chief Local Representative, as-vin him to de^l with p.nd settle these outstanding import ddt|y questi ons. Yours sincerely, (Sgd.) H.R.Ballantyne./? X\/I d, s* INDIA OFFICE, WHITEHALL. S.W.I. P.Z. 8231/33. 27th December, 1933, Dear Mr. Ballantyne, f v Many thanks for your letter of 21st December about the payment of import duties at Bahrein. The language of the clause in dispute must, of course, as a matter of strict legal interpretation, be interpreted as it stands and, as I explained in our discussion on the 4th December, the correct interpretation in our view is that the terms 'material, apparatus and machinery' cover technical equipment required by the Company for the purposes of its field work; the term 'office requirements' cover secretarial I material, such as typewriters, office tables and desks, etc., required for the equipping of their secretarial offices. On the other hand the phrase 'not including the personal requirements of employees' shows that personal equipment for employees, such as beds, mirrors and household furniture generally, would be liable to pay such duty as was in force from time to time, and was therefore specifically excluded from the exemption granted to 'office requirements' and 'material, apparatus and machinery'. We cannot in any circumstances agree that articles such as food and gramophone records fall within the scope of the exemption. 2, The matter is a small one, and, as you say, it would be unfortunate if it were to develop into a Question of importance or a source of friction between the Company and the local authorities and the Bahrein Government. In our view, save possibly on the question of motor cars, the State are/ H.R. Ballantyne, Esq.. Bahrein Petroleum Co., Ltd., 19, Moorgate, E.0.&lt;C; #are justified in the interpretation they place on the clause in dispute and, particularly having regard to the small amount involved, we think the Company might well yield the point. But if they do not feel disposed to do so, we have no objection to further informal discussion locally, though, as I explained at our meeting on 4th December, we must of course make it clear to the Stat e that the correct interpretation of the clause is in our view that set out in paragraph 1 above. 3. Our attitude on the question of motor cars is as set out in paragraph 2 of my letter. No. P,Z. 7187/33, of 23rd November. It was agreed, I think, in the course of our discussion that a car imported by an employee for private use as distinct from one imported by the Company for the official purposes of its work would, of course, be liable to duty.

I have to thank you for your letter (P. Z. 8251/55) of the 27th December. The Company appreciates the standpoint of the first paragraph of your letter but it does not feel, legally speaking, that your construction is altogether correct. If the matter rested upon the amount of money involved at the present time, I think the Conpany would not hesitate for one second to yield the point but there is a question of p^;-.ncipli involved, tha Company feeling that Its view of the meaning of the clause we are discussing, is a fair one; therefore, the Company would feel obliged if you would kindly instruct the local Authorities to endeavour to settle the matter locally through the medium of a furuher informal tils cussi «n. The Company understands, of course ; that you will make it clear to the State what the correct interpretation of the clause is, in your view. I confirm it was agreed at our discussion that a motor car imported by an employee for private use, as distinct from one imported by the Canpany for official purposes oi its work, would be liable to duty.

It is my understanding that in lieu of an agreement between the Bahrein Government and The Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, in interpreting the wording in the Clauses of the Contract covering this matter, a compromise will be sought along the following lines. I suggest that food supplies, including everything necessary for their preparation and serving, as well sports goods and amusement articles, be dutiable, and that all other materials of every nature be non-dutiable. In amplification:- DUTIABLE : 1. All food supplies. 2. All kitchen equipment, including utensils, furniture, stove, refrigerator, etc. Items mentioned are for clarity and do not exclude any other items which might be considered kitchen equipment. 3. All dining room equipment, including furniture, silverware, dishes, linen, etc. 4. All club house equipment, including furniture and amusement articles. 5. Sports goods. It is understood that articles similar to those mentioned above imported for married quarters will also be dutiable, which of course will include those articles already imported for the house being occupied by the Manager in Manama. NON-DUTIABLE : Everything else imported by the Company whether for the use of single man or married man or^othe^s families, excepting personal effects of the icts are employees. Personal effects and imported by an individual. 5 those articles which are actually owned It was mentioned yesterday that all articles in the Manager's house in Manama might be dutiable. Upon considering the matter further, I think this is a needless complication in that it makes an exception at the start. ( • IJ I \ »An agreement along these lines would be retroactive and duty charged at the rate in force at time of importation. I feel that the above will be a very equitable arrangement for both parties to the Contract, and shall appreciate your comments and suggestions. I should like this letter to be considered entirely informal, as it is merely a draft of my ideas with which you and Mr. Belgrave might not entirely agree. I shall be pleased to interview you both on this subject at any convenient time, A copy of this letter is being sent to Mr. Belgrave. Yours very truly ) Lieut-Colonel G, Loch, The Agency, Bahrein.

Many thanks for your P.S. regarding my health. I am feeling considerably better but seem to be progressing rather slowly. yours sincerely, J. E.A. SKINNER./-fy ls&amp; E.0.C/343-10/1(a).

Dear Sicinner, i Lave shown to Beigrave your letter Iiio:FA-40 dated the 16th inarch 1334 on tne subii§et ol import duties payable by The Banram Petroleum Company Limited. Both he and I understood at our talk that only employees m Class I were to be covered by tne proposed arrangement and it seems to mm,and I agree,that if tne arrangements are to cover Classes 11 ana 111 oi the Company's employees,it will have the result oi maJcing all the articles imported by tne Company lor them non-dutiable,because it seems unlikely that the type of employees in those classes would ordinarily have kitchen or aining room equipment provided for them,save in exceptional cases. It,however,you wish to press tne point 1 will arrange for a further discussion of the question between you,Belgrave ana myself. lours sincerely, A V' u .A.Skinner isquire, - • - - L i E Chief Local Representative^ The Banram Petroleum company Limited, Banram.The Bahrein Petroleum Company limited Bahrein Island, Persian Gulf, March 27, 1934, A t 2 ^ No. PA-48 Dear Colonel Loch: Please refer to your letter D.O.C./343-lo/l(a) on the subject of Import duties payable by the Bahrein Petroleum Company, Limited, Upon further consideration I do not care to press the point that the arrangement should also apply to Classes II and III.

Residents Printed Letter No:1914:-S of 14th December 1933.I On the lOtii January 1934 I discussed certain matters with the Political Resident in ILM.S Shoreham. 1. It was decided that I should taice action about the customs duties and send a note about the result to the Political Resident# I mentioned that Mr.Skinner had already approached me on the subject with a view to having a discussion. The Political Resident's opinion was,though he did not wish to hamper local action,that we should take our stand on the letter of legal opinion quoted by the India Office. 2. I saw Mr.Skinner on the evening of the 12th January 1S34 and said that I was sorry that I had not been able to deal with his letters about the customs duty ana registering British personnel as I had been busy with work for the Political Resident.

Resubmittea.On the ^7th January 1^34 a Meeting was held between Mr.Belgrave (Adviser to the Bahrain G-overnment),Mr.Skinner (Chiei Local Representative,The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited) and Lieutenant-Colonel Goraon Loch (Political Agent, Bahrain),in conmection with the question ol' the payment 01 auty on certain articles imported by The Bahrain Petroleum Company Limited into Bahrain. 2. The ailierence ol opinion as to the meaning ol Article b ol the Prospecting License was maintainea on each siae but it was agreed tnat instead ol proceecung to arbitration a compromise should be eliected. It was suggested by Mr.Sianner that a possible line ol compromise might be that duty should be paid on all plenishings ol the iatchen and dining rooms of the quarters,whether married or single,and furniture lor the Manager's house in Manamah and the Club at the Oil Field and that duty should not be paid on the furniture of the other rooms. Thus,tor example,duty would be paid on a side board or relngerator but would not be paid on blankets aKa or beds. It was agreed that Mr.Skinner should prepare a draft lormula for consideration by the Adviser and the Political Agent. 3. The reason why the Company are not prepared to give way on the legal interpretation is tnat they fear that some other parts of the Concession Agreement documents are open to misinterpretation, in particular tney lear tnat the specific mention ol pipe lines in Article 4 ol the Mining Lease might be interpreted to rule out pumping plant and tanks. I said tnat i thought tnat these were amply covered by apparatus and machinery T but Mr.Skinner seemed to tmnk tnat there was a possibility ol doubt. 4. Mr.Skinner asked whether it was not possible to get the opinion of the Drafters,Major ioung and Major Holmes, but it was pointed out that Major Young was m Nyassaland. b. In the course of the Meeting i read to Mr.Skinner and Mr.Belgrave paragraph Z of Mr.Cunliffe-Lister T s letter ol tne 5th June iy33 snowing that there was no record as to thefi % intentions ot the aralters# 4- k TU^. ^ U/lwt' t. i!7-l-1934.

No mention is made ol tms item in tne Cinel' Local Representative's lormula of compromise. yl' w On tne ^Oth February 1934 I mentioned tne question of imports to Mr.Skinner and apologised lor the delay due to the visit of H.M.S Shoreham etcetera. It appears that the word 'crther' in the sixth line from the bottom of Page 1 ol his letter dated the &amp;5th January 1934 should nave been 'their'. I asKed him about tne employees who would be included in it and ne said tnat he thought all tnose in Class 1. He said tnat tney would be importing a little furniture for those in Class 2,but that it would not amount to much ana need not be mcludea as non-dutiable. 2. I askea about personal ellects and he said that personal ellects are excepted I'rom the non-dutiable imports, but I said tnat I thought that the piece about personal ellects should be so qualified by some suitable word xliawxHg that the individual entering Bahrain would get the benefit of tne usual customs txsiixlxKS courtesies.of allowing the individual^ personal clothing and so on free of duty. 20-2-1934. ik. ^r LA' Two fair drafts submittea below ''4 S.No:61.
