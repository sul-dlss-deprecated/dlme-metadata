The majority of the correspondence takes place between staff at the Political Agency in Bahrain and the Political Residency in Bushire in the wake of Biscoe’s sudden death in July 1932, and relates to attempts to dispose of the horses and their offspring. Aside from Agency and Residency staff, the file’s other principal correspondent is the Bahrain merchant Abdul Aziz Alqosaibi &amp; Brothers [‘Abd al-‘Azīz al-Quṣaybī], who are charged with looking after the horses while a buyer is found, and regularly send invoices for expenses incurred in keeping the animals. Correspondence from Abdul Aziz Alqosaibi &amp; Brothers is in Arabic, with some letters translated into English.</abstract><typeOfResource>text</typeOfResource><genre type="class">Archival file</genre><name type="corporate"><namePart>Abdul Aziz Alqosaibi &amp; Brothers, merchant</namePart><role><roleTerm type="text">correspondent</roleTerm></role></name><subject><topic>Gifts</topic></subject><subject><topic>Horses</topic></subject><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00011c#share">Unknown</accessCondition><accessCondition type="Use and reproduction" xlink:href="http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100000000282.0x00011c#share">Open Government Licence</accessCondition></mods></metadata></record>
