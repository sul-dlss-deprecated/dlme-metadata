LOCAL NEWS. • 2.3 inches of rain fell in the afternoon of the 1st Novemb- er * All the low-lying areas in the Town were flooded and some houses gave way. No loss of life has been rep©rted. The rain covered only the area to the east of Jahra-Safwan road, north of Kadhama Bay, and to the south did not extend more than 20 miles inland from the coasts. The beneficial affect on winter grazing has therefore been limited but epicures are cheerful at the brightened prospects of a bountiful hardest of truffles. 360* Fire broke out in the heart of the town on the 13th November completely gutting a few reed huts. By the energetic efforts shaikh Abdulla al Mubarak and others the fire was localised and brought under control. Some people received slight burns. 361 • Id al Adhha was observed on the 15th. His Highness and other members of the Ruling Family received the customary greetings of the people in the morning. 362. Markets remained dull during the period under review. The more far-sighted merchants are begining to realise that the flood of indiscriminate orders placed on exporters in the United Kingdom and United States of America is likely to cause a glut of consumer goods in the market and some of the 'little men' who are still holding on to their stocks of cloth purchased at war prices are going to feel the wind very sharply and very soon. 363. His Highness xh has sanctioned the appointment of Khalid as-Zaid al Khalid, Abdul Hamid as Sare and Nusuf Yusuf an Nusuf as assistants to Shaikh Abdulla al Jabir, in his capacity of Chief Justice The assumed office with effect from the 10th November.
