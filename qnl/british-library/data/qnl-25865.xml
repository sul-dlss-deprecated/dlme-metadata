Technical engineer could decide whether they could be converted for broadcasting. 4* Kven if the Beirut transmitters prove useful only for strictly local broadcasting, they appear to offer in addition possibility of effective jamming of Bari and Zeeeen such as is suggested by Bagdad telegram No* 5 85 of June 18th. Since there is already a good deal of jamming of these Axis stations (possibly by Russia) and since the Arabic is already partly jammed, risk of reprisals contemplated in your telegram No* ?21 of 23rd May does not seem serious* * Distributed as Most.

The question, however, was referred to C.-in-C. Bast Indies. After considering his reply, the Admiralty have decided that it is regretted that the jamming cannot be carried out at the present time by Naval transmitters, as these stations are fully employed on Service duties.

I spoke to Peel yesterday about ifior f s telegram. There is no objection whatever from the Ministry point of viev; - indeed, we welcome the suggestion. In discussing the matter with the Foreign Office, I discovered that they thought that the Service authorities ought perhaps to be informed. I mentioned this to Peel, and he told me that he would see that this was done, if they had not already been informed. ■^'or your information, we are already doing a certain amount of this 'local interference' in other places. It has been ruled oy the V.ar Cabinet Secretariat that such action does not contravene the principle laid down at the beginning of the war doing anything in the nature of jamming of hostile broadcasts over a wide area. I am rather surprised at the report thalf German broadcasts are more popular in Bahrein than our own. It does not coincide with the information which I have been receiving up to a comparatively recent date. I wonder if there are any local circumstances to account for it? Possibly the entourage of the Sheikh is a little inclined to resdnt our recent triumphs over the Italians! I cannot believe that the Berlin broadcasts, the quality of which has greatly fallen off, are really quite so serious as the Publicity Officer reports. In /Iraq J.P.

Iraq, of course, things are very different; but I certainly would not have thought that the Iraqi slant of these broadcasts£due to Yunis BahriJ would appeal particularly to Bahrein, I am so interested in this matter, that I should be grateful if, when you reply to Prior, you would ask him for some further details. For indeed the report is quite contrary to the information we are l getting from - I think I may say - every other part of the Arab speaking world.
