Salalah To Political Agent. Muscat. N 0 M.5 Dated and Received 14th February, 1945. During interview yesterday Sultan informed me that he ^ wished 'to do something for the people of Guadar 1 * and was prepared to devote whole of Guadar revenues to improvment of administration and provision of public amenities, fie enquired if British Officer could be found to undertake this task. I said at present time this would probably be difficult but suggested it might be possible to arrange for officer to conduct preliminary examination and draw up development plan to be acted upon when conditions permit. Sultan agreed and said he would pay all expences.Telegram From Q. Political Agent, Muscat• To Political Resident, Bushire, No.S.221. ‘ \ Dated 16th February, 1945. IMPOKI ANT Sultan has informed Assistant Political Agent that he wishes to devote whole 0(3 Gwadur revenues to improvement of administration and provision of public services for that place. He has enquired if a British Officer can be found to undertake the task. 2 . I am examining the request and will send you a report of developments later. The above is for information only at this early stage. POLITICALr Telegram Q. From • Political Agent, Muscat. To A.P.A. Salalah (via Aden). No.C.361. Dated 9th March, 1946. Your telegram M.5 of 14th February. I io not agree with you that it is necessary in the first place to draw up a plan and think that,wo should get. on with the matter. If we do not Sultan may turn elsewhere. 2. Please inform Sultan that I welcome his proposal and that the sooner we start the better and that I have made recommendations accordingly. POLITICALPOLITICAL AGENCY MUSCAT CONFIDENTIAL EXPRESS LETTER From POLITICAL MUSCAT TO BRITCONSUL BUSHIRE No.C.363-8/82. Dated Muscat, the 9th March, 1945. Reference ray telegram No.S.221 of the 16th February, 1946. 2. The Sultan states that he will pay all expenses up to the limit of the Gwadur income which amounts to about one lakh rupees a year. Using this figure as a basis the following rough estimate demonstrates the practicability of the proposal from a financial point of view j- (a) British Officer*s pay, leave, pension contribution etc. Rs. (b) Accommodation .. .. •• Rs. (c) Office staff etc. .. .. .. Rs. (d) Education .. .. .. -Rs. (e) Medical .. .. •• Rs. (f) Sanitation .. ... .. Rs. (g) Muscat Officials, Customs etc. .. .. Rs. (h) Miscellaneous developments etc. .. .. Rs. 20 , 000 /- 6 , 000 /- 6 , 000 /- 10 , 000 /- 10 , 000 /- 6 , 000 /- 16,000/- 30,000/- 3.- Gwadur is a small town of some 12,000 inhabitants of whom about half are British Aghakhani subjects. There are also at least two villages. There is no form of sanitary service though there is a municipal committee which owing to local friction is inoperative. There is one small ^rab school and the Aghakhanis have some schooling arrangements. There are no police, and, so far as I know, no local court. Some dozen or so Askars keep the peace. There are no medical facilities. Most of the revenue is derived from the customs and the fishing industry. The latter is capable, I think, of considerable development. It is not improbable that the area may again come into importance as a landing ground for aircraft both sea and land. Reasonable administration would benefit India directly in trade matters. 4. It will, therefore, be seen that there is work for a British Officer in administering the territory and organising ordinary civil and municipal services, but the necessity for providing one at the present time of shortage of officers is not so. apparent. There is, of course, no urgency from the point of view of the Gwadur public, but air development may demand the presence of a reliable official. The duration of the appointment, if made, is difficult to estimate, and I think that it might be on a yearly basis. 6. Even if the urgency is not apparent from an administrative point of view, the Sultan-has asked us for assistance in a project of development and improved administration and we should, I think, provide the assistance with as little delay as possible. If we do not he may turn elsewhere which would be most undesirable I hope, therefore, that you will be able to make arrangements for the loan of a suitable officer to the Muscat State for administering Gwadur in the fairly near future. If the Govern ment of India are unable to depute an officer, you might perhaps consider employing an officer from the Training Centre in Arabic Studies, Jerusalem. ^ Political Agent, Muscat.

From To Subject Sir, The British igent, Gwanur* The Political Agent k H.P's Cons I use at. If I v/ere an Auministrator for Gv/aaur. ibj. Vith reference to your Memorandum No:J 50-0/82 dated the 14th January, 1946, I iiave the honour to state that idian Bahadur Abaul Haiy ^liiashmy, M.B.B,, arrived at G-wanur on the 27th January 1946 via eivvani, out I wish to say a few words with regard to the proposes reforms aesired to oe carried out as if I were an Administrator for Bwadur. 2. It is a commonplace imowleuge that Bwaaur is a seriously neglected area ana that the rays of moaem civilization have not yet dawned upon this place. If I v/ere an Administrator for Gwadur, I should therefore aeem it my first duty as nearly as can be to introduce reforms so as to looK after the rights, privileges anu interests of all communities and work for the uplift of the masses.' I should form a Boaru of development for planning schemes for the advancement of health, education, social, economic and commercial progress on the basis of actual population ana reorganize the various departments of the Government of Highne His Highness the Sultan of Muscat .and revise salaries of the Government officials. Ly aim should oe to can;y out the following reforms iiiimeuiatsly within the means of the State revenues from Gwadur:- Health : I should ouilt a small hospital in Gwauur arid engcige the following staff for it:- 1 . A qualified Indian doctor preferrably an L.B.3.3. 2. A qualified lady doctor. 3. A qualified mid-wife 4. 2 qualified compounders 5. A vaccinator 6 . Menial staff. 7. Mobile dispensary truck for Gwauur suberbs.2 ■ - ■—.• ■ ” - - n- , «- 1 C\2 1 i 3. The 1 eciical Officer should be the Public Health Officer of the town aria should iiave a separate sanitary staff under him. Education:- It is scarcely necessary today that compulsory education should oe introduced in Twadur for joys and ^irls. However one / primary school upto 5th standard for girls ana one middle school upto 8 th standard for soya - later with possioility of exteiision to a High School in due course, should oe founded immediately and duly staffed with qualified teachers. Co-operation of arch'ijaudas 1 should be enlisted do attract students of boah sexes anu intensive propaganda for primary education should be carried out. education : ^ ' L ■ should be free; prizes ana scholarships should be offerred to the i &lt; i promising ana best students ana games ana sports etc should be encouraged. The promotion of public health would thus be sought 1 both by education ana by the encouragement of physical culture ana games. later Supply:- ihe most urgent need oi the town is to maKe arrangements ior an adequate supply of clean ana good drinking water. At present it may safely oe asserted that even proper drinxing water is not available in Gwaaur, I should try to bore artesian wells, but if the experiments fail, I should investigate other possibilities for producing large quanitities of drinking water, ^very citizen has a right to arinx clean rater, out when natural resources are limited, any civilized government is duty oounu to make arrangements for supply of pure ana healthy drinking water for the public. If artesian wells can be a success, the desert and waste lanas of jrwadur can be converted into a garden in a few years of time. « Power-house. Ice-plant ana PIour mills:- ’ The State government can .arid should try to arrange for th£se things in P'/adur in their own interests, as soon as material and equipment can oe made available, out meanwhile, municipal roads should be built; streets should je widened; nouseaw - o - houses shoulu oe built accorciin^ to a certain plan anti the 1 ightin^ arrangements in the town siioulu oe improvea together with the sanitary arrangements. The success of these operations naturally aepenus upon the estaolishment of a popular municipality for which men of 'strong character should be nominated from among the various interests. economics :- I shoulu organize the fishing industry so as to relieve the fi she men of their hereditary or personal deots by starting co-operative societies; encourage the habit of thrift among the masses ana create worK for the ialers, so that the time ana money now foolishly wasted oy sections of the public in bra class hotels would thus be replaced oy rational diet and dress ana ohe use of foot-ball ana other sports ana games for which wiae spread provision would be made. In these ways, the people would be encourageu to uivert the mina and exercise the body. Ooiamuni cab ions : - riwaaur is at present connected oy camel roau with wi./ani ana Pasni, out the state of communications between these places ana consequent!y with the outer woriu is far from being satisfactory. Gtoradur is, nevertheless, ana important business centre in Leman coast ana there is an urgent neeu to improve the communications, which is possible as follows: - t (1) The resumption of sea mail services by steamers should be' speeded up without further delay; (2) There is a fortnightly postal mail service between Pasni ana G-wadur oy the land-route, which is carried by the camels. The mail runners, it is understood, are oeing paid oy the Assistant Political Agent, Laaajgur, but this is not enough. Gfwauur is only 6 b miles from biwani, which is only 4 hours run by truck and xO hours run by camel. The Sub lost Office at Gwaxiur lias an avenige income of is. 2000/- per mensem against an expenditure of m.bOO/- per mensem. The postal authorities should therefore be urged to introduce air mail service in Gwadur via Jiwani and they should appoint a mail contractor to carry mails oetween Gwaaur ana oiwani on mail days. Trie extra cost involved is estimated to be b.uOO/- per mensem for 8 mails a month, which should oe met from the large profits of the Sub Post Office at Gwaaur. Otherwise the Luscat Government or the Political authorities should aMxxiuixs pay a subsidy to the postal department in oruer to introduce this much needed reform.

Your telegram No.A/600 of ICth April and No.a/ 612 of 13th April. 2. Main defects in postal arrangements in Muscat territory are (l) failure to link Muscat and Gwadur with air-mail services C2)-absence of instructions for mail steamers to resume carriage of mail to and from Gwadur (3) absence of any internal mail system over Muscat's coastline and (4) poor terms of service of Sub-Postmaster which inevitably affect efficiency. 3. As regards (1) suggest examination of possibility of providing motor transport for carriage of mails between Gwadur and Jiwani and Muscat and Sharjah once weekly. If contractors at both places could be allowed to purchase trucks from army stocks and to carry passengers in addition to mail, these arrangements should not be undibiy expensive. Jiwani does not possess Post Office but British Overseas Airways Corporation would probably agree to act as postal agents. 4* In regard to (2) use of mail steamers which are now scheduled to make regular calls at Gwadur would permit resumption of registered and insured mail which is not accepted for delivery by overland route. 5- As regards (3) if weekly mail service between Muscat and Sharjah as suggested is introduced, postal agents could be appointed at all Batinah towns, who would sell stamps and receive mail for collection by truck. Similai: arrangement might bo extended to Sur by means of runners. I anticipate no difficulty in obtaining Sultan's consent to this. 1 * 6 . As regards (4) the grade pay of Re.45-3-90 for postal clerks is deplorably low. In view of their aducational requirements (matriculation) and responsibilities consider ohis should be not less than grade pay of Residency lower division clerk. Inadequacy of house rent allowance of Rs.15/- has already been pointed out to the Superintendent, Post Offices, r , Hyderabad, Sind, with recommendation for increase to Rs.30/-. Gulf Allowance of Rs.25/- also appears to be fully justified. -PoliticalHo.C.313-11/14. POLITICAL AGENCY, MUSCAT, Dated 13th April, 1946.

My dear friend, / /■s I have received a telogran from Kran Bahadur Abdul Haiy at Gwadur, aeking that arranger’ents be made to secure the ser vices of a supervisor to undertake the preparation of plans and estimates for the construction of new buildings and repairs to existing buildings at Gv*adur, and also to Undertake the work required to brng into use for the purpose of a water supply an old rain water reservoir situated close to Gvadur. The Administrator has suggested that tie period of deputation of the supervisor should be n for one month or so*. 2. I am incl.ined to think th^t more advantage would be gained in securing the servic es of a supervisor for a period of not less tiian one year, so that he could not only prepare plans and errti- mates, but also undertake construction and repair work. 3. An official deputed from Government service would cost approximately between Rs.500/- ana Rs.600/- per month, and would ofcourse require to be given the usual terras in regard to a house, medical treatment, sea passages, &amp;c. If Your Pighness agrees with my view, I shall be grateful if you would telegraph me accordingly, so that I can tc-ke up the matter with the Hon’ble the Political Resident and the Sind Government while I am at Karachi. 4. The Sind Government seem to be having some difficulty in finding the staff already asked for on the terms offered, but I am doing my best to secure the early completion of re cruitment . 5.

Khan Bahadur Abdul Haiy has informed me that he wishes to resign from his post as Administrator and to be relieved of his ciuties not later than the middle of October. He gives as his reason for this, poor health following a recent illness. He has confirmed that he has also informed His Highness the Sultan. 3. The Khan Bahadur’s desire to resign comes as no surprise as, when I saw him at Muscat, he appeared old and frail. His Highness the Sultan also formed the same impression of him,but, in view of the fact that there appeared to be no other candidate forthcoming, agreed to employ him. 4. I shall be grateful therefore if steps can be taken to find a suitable successor and suggest that in the first instance enquiries be made from the Baluchistan Administration. Any candidate from Baluchistan should however not be the subject of Kalat State. I have anticipated Sultan's agreement to the course suggested in order to save time but will confirm this after discussion with him at Muscat. t Political Agent, Muscat.
