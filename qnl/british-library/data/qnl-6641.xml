This document is the property of Her Majesty 8 Secretary of State for India. Confidential. 1900. KOWEIT. Historical. —Koweit (or Grane) is a large town of some 20.000 to 25,000 inhabitants (one authority, M. Stavrides, puts the population at 50,000), situated on the north-west shore of one of the best harbours in the Persian Gulf. It has for long been regarded as the possible terminus of a projected Euphrates Valley Railway. When in 1871 a Turkish force was sent to the assistance of Abdullah bin Feysul, Amir of Nejd, against his brother—an expedition which was under taken in spite of representations by Her Majesty's Government, and which resulted in the establishment of Turkish suzerainty in El Hasa and Katif— the Koweit Sheikh was an active ally of the Turks, who subsequently, according to Colonel Telly's report, established a custom house at Koweit. The suzerainty of the Sultan over the portion of the littoral of the Persian Foreign Gulf north of Ojair (a place opposite the island of Demain, just south of Office 0 to Sir Katif) has never been formally acknowledged by H«r Majesty's Government. A. Layard, There are indications, however, that the British Government would have 1 j^ 1 date(1 been, ready to welcome Turkish authority on that part of the coast if '[gyg' effectually exerted in the interests of order. Tenacious, however, as they have shown themselves of their shadowy rights, the Turks have done nothing towards establishing their authority in any part of the western sea board of the Turkish Gulf; and have confined themselves to the location of small garrisons at Katif, and at El Bidaa (where the British Government has declined to recognise their authority), and to the grant of the titles of Kaimakam and Mutessarif to certain local chiefs. 1896. .. Attention was prominently drawn to Koweit in 1896 by a memorandum giVge*' written by M. Stavrides, Legal Adviser to the British Embassy at Constan tinople, who represented that much excitement had been caused in the Sultan's entourage by a report that Mubarak, a son of the late Sheikh of Koweit, had at the instigation of the British President* murdered his brother and usurped the chiefship. M. Stavrides described Koweit as an independent Arab State, but stated that, owing to the possession by the ruling family of landed property near Busrah, the Sultan had usually accorded his sanction g0 . to the succession of each Chief to the throne, and granted to him the title l&gt; ' of Kaimakam. A visit of H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' to Koweit in July 1896 con firmed the report of Mubarak's usurpation. Commander Baker reported that Koweit, though nominally independent, was in reality greatly under Turkish To India, influence, more especially since Mubarak's accession, and that the Turkish ^ 0 - 54 flag was flying there. dated^Sth In December 189G the Consul at Busrah reported that ho was satisfied that j) e( . Koweit subjects were concerned in a piratical attack on the British dhow i n( ji a) 'Haripasa.' It was at first proposed, and the Indian Government were Xo. l47of inclined to favour the proposal, to hold the Turkish and Persian Governments Un responsible—a proposal which would, in the circumstances, have involved a c]()sure 2 - recognition of Turkish authority over Koweit; but it was eventually decided Political, not to adopt this method of procedure on the ground of the improbability 1 722/97. that any satisfaction would be obtained by it. 225/97. Telegram, IS 0 ?. The Sheikh of Koweit was eventually seriously warned by the Resident WratislaVs that he would be held responsible for the misconduct of his subjects. Despatch In February 1897 a proposal was made by the Constantinople Sanitary ^ 0 - Board to establish a Turkish quarantine station at Koweit. The Government of India had no objection, but nothing appears to have been done to carry ^^^1 * out the proposal efi'ectively, though a so-called sanitary authority is stationed 2125 99.) there.f * This was of course absolutely denied by the Resident. S. 36. A9. Political, 265/97. 1069/97. 1827/97. 20.33/97. 2062/9, 2374/97. 2451 97. 2291/97. 242/98. 2430 98. 2391 98. 2519/98. On the 27tli February tlie Government of India reported that Mubarak was making overtures for an interview with the Resident, and permission was given for the interview to take place. Colonel Meade reported the result of the interview in his letter of the 2')th September 1897. It appeared that the Sheikh wished to place himself under British protection such as was enjoyed by Bahrein. He had previously endeavoured to secure recognition from the Turks, and it was doubtful whether his advances to us were bond'fide or designed to put pressure on the Turks. On the whole, Colonel Meade was in favour of meeting the Sheikh's wishes, but recognised that difficulties would arise from Turkish claims. In the meantime Captain TVhyte, lately Consul at Busrah, had sent in a memorandum showing strong reasons against M. Stavrides' assertion that Koweit was independent of Turkey. The Foreign Office had accordingly instructed Sir N. O'Conor (with reference to a proposal that the British Consul should intervene in consequence of an attack which had been made on Koweit by Sheikhs Jassim of Katr and Yusuf Ibrahim) that, though we had never acknowledged Koweit to be under Turkish protection, it seemed doubtful whether wo could deny that in fact it was under Turkish influence. The Consul was accordingly instructed not to intervene unless the peace of the Gulf was threatened. This attitude was consistently maintained by Her Majesty's Government, notwithstandino- rumours that the Turks intended to intervene and that a O son of the murdered Sheikh had invoked British assistance and protection, and a representation by the Government of India that, whereas Koweit was at present a dangerous piratical centre and emporium for the slave trade, Sheikh Mubarak was anxious to accept our protection. The receipt of Colonel Meade's report, and of a letter from the Admiral on the East India Station advocating the strengthening of our hold over Koweit, did not affect the attitude of Her Majesty's Government, though it was laid down that there was nothing in the status of Koweit to hamper naval officers in bringing home to the Sheikh responsibility for piratical acts committed by his subjects (telegram to India, dated 4th December 1897). 1898. Late in 1897 and early in 1898 reports were received of movements of Turkish troops near Busrah, of an alleged Russian mission to Baghdad, and of an intention on the part of Russia to acquire a coaling station on the Persian Gulf, possibly Koweit. These reports induced the India Office to ask the Foreign Office (11th February 1898) whether they were in possession of any information as to designs of Foreign Powers, which might make it desirable to modify the policy of non-intervention in Koweit, To this letter no reply was received till the 5th December 1898. In the interval Mr. (now Lord) Curzon had been inquiring into the subject, but officially the question had been allowed to rest; and nothing had occurred to bring it again into prominence until the receipt of Sir JN'. O'Conor's Despatch of the 1st November 1898, which enclosed a Consular Report to the effect that the A ali of Busrah, by sanction of the Porte, had appointed a commis sion to settle the quarrels between Sheikh Mubarak and his nephews. The India Office then addressed a letter to the Foreign Office (dated 23rd November 1898) drawing attention to the issues raised in the letter of the 11th February. The Foreign Office in reply expressed their readiness to support the Government of India by diplomatic action, should that Government consider that a protectorate over Koweit might be asserted and undertaken by it on its sole responsibility without difficulty or inconvenient extension of police duties in the Gulf. It was added ' It does not appear that there is any foundation in fact for a Turkish claim of sovereignty or control over the district.' The substance of this letter was communicated to the Government of India, with a request for their views, by telegram, on the 24th December 1898. On the 27th December 1898 the Foreign Office received from Sir N. O'Conor a Despatch (dated 22nd December) pointing out the necessity for caution and the avoidance of any overt act, which would probably be regarded by Turkey as little short of a hostile act and provoke serious complications not only with Turkey but with Russia. The substance of this warning was telegraphed to the Viceroy on the 5th January 1899.3 [In 1896 Sir P. Currie had reported thnt the Russian Embassy in Constantinople had been using very strong language at the Porte regarding England's grasping policy via a vis to Turkey, whether in Cyprus, Egypt, or the Persian Gulf.] 1899. About this time came news that Count Kapnist's application for a Kapnist concession to build a railway from Tripoli to Koweit was likely to prove C0n ' es310n • successful; and, in order to take precautions against any territorial claims which Russia might possibly base upon that concession, it was decided (without waiting for the reply of the Government of India to the telegram of Political, the 24th December) at the instance of the Foreign Ollice (letter 4th January 1057 i&gt;;) - 1899) to instruct the A^iceroy to procure an engagement from the Sheikh &lt;c not to cede, lease, mortgage, or otherwise alienate or give for occupation ' any portion of his territories to the Government or subjects of any other ' Power without previously obtaining the consent of Her Majesty's Govern- ' ment.'' The consideration was to be a sum of 5,0001. to be advanced by India, the question of the ultimate incidence of the charge being reserved (telegram to Viceroy, dated Cth January 1899). The Viceroy reported 151/99, that he had instructed the Resident accordingly (telegram. 9th January 1899); and added ' Proposed negotiations, if successful, seem to involve ultimate protectorate.' After some discussion as to the form of the engagement, the Government 155 '99. of India were finally instructed (telegram, 17th January 1899) to adopt as a model the Muscat Agreement of 2()th March 1891, and Colonel Meade was authorised to promise an annual subsidy of Rs. 3,000, if he considered it desirable, instead of a lump sum of 5,000/. as originally proposed. Colonel Meade reported his procedings in his letter of the 30th January 319 09. 1899 (Enclosure in India Secret Letter, JVo. 7, 23rd February 1899). He met Sheikh Mubarak on the 23rd January, and showed him the draft agree ment,* in which (in excess of the Government of India's instructions) a clause had been inserted binding the Sheikh not to receive the representatives of Foreign Powers. Before signing a document which might get him into trouble with Turkey, the Sheikh asked for some assurance of British pro tection and assistance, especially in regard to th^ family property situated in Turkish territory. Colonel Meade promised him a letter assuring him of 44 the good otlices of Her Majesty's Government' so long as be and his successors observed the conditions of the bond, and promising him a sum of Rs. 15,000. On receipt of this letter, the Sheikh signed the agreement. His brothers, however, refused to sign in the absence of a distinct undertaking that Her Majesty's Government would protect the family estates. The conclusion of the Agreement was notified in the Viceroy's telegram of Poliiiciil, the 30th January, and its terms were communicated in his further telegram 189 . '• of the 12th February. This Latter telegram asked (1) whether, with a view 219/99. to conciliate the Sheikh's brothers, Colonel Meade should be instructed to give an assurance that their ' interests in regard to the Turkish estates will be looked after and receive consideration of Her Majesty's Government (2) whether the Agreement should be ratified. The Foreign Office (14th 17,51/99. February) agreed to Colonel Meade ' holding out a hope that Her Majesty's ' Government will do what they can to protect the family estates of the Sheikh ' of Koweit at Fao,' and considered that the Agreement should be ratified. This decision was communicated to the Viceroy by telegraph on the 14th February. The Government of India were informed by Despatch of the 30th 1835/99. March 1899 that Colonel Meade's action was approved; but it was observed that he had not been authorised to insert a proviso about the representatives of other Powers. As this proviso had been introduced, it might remain in force; but its operation, especially with reference to the Sheikh's relations with the Turkish Government, would require careful attention. Meanwhile, on the 3rd February, the Government of India, having learned 192/1900. that there was a possibility of armed interference by the Turks, asked for permission to instruct the naval authorities to forbid it. This was granted; and the Admiral reported that, if time were given to collect ships, Koweit # See Appeudix.1899.

O'Conor, No. 87, dated 8th Sept. 1899. (Political, 2290/99.) Foreign Office to Admiralty, dated 9th Sept. 1899. (Political, 2292/99.) would be defensible by the Navy alone. Arrangements were made that Her Majesty's Government should have the earliest possible notice, in the event of preparatory measures being found necessary, in order to give a serious warning to Turkey before forcible measures were actually taken. It was also decided, contrary to the view of the Government of India, that the Admiral should take no steps to prevent Turkish transports leaving the Shat-ul-Arab without orders from the Admiralty, which would only be issued when the occasion arose. During the month of February further reports were received of visits of Russians to Koweit. Consular reports from Busrah also made it clear that the suspicions of the Turks had been excited by Colonel Meade's visit. A formal complaint was made by the Constantinople Board of Health that Colonel Meade had landed by force in detiance of sanitary regulations; the Nakib of Busrah proceeded to Koweit ostensibly on private business; Mubarak was reported to be distrusted : and it appeared probable that the Vali of Busrah, might espouse the cause of Mubarak's nephews. Sir N. O'Conor considered that it might be desirable to warn the Porte that Her Majesty's Government would view with displeasure any expedition against Mubarak; but further reports induced him to modify his opinion CNo. 292, dated 6th June), and it was decided merely to authorise the Consul at Busrah to warn the Vali (to Sir JS. O'Conor, dated 17th June), and to enjoin on the Sheikh of Koweit caution in his language (telegram to Viceroy, dated 20th June 1899). Meanwhile the Government of India (No. 101, dated 1st June) had supported a suggestion of Colonel Meade, that diplomatic action should be taken with a view to an early understanding with the Porte in respect to the status of Koweit, in order to prevent local complications. Colonel Meade's letter of the 14th May (Enclosure 5) reported an allegation that the Turks were inciting other Arab Sheikhs, especially the Sheikh of Nejd, to attack Koweit, so as to give them an excuse for interference. Further reports received from the Consul at Busrah induced Sir N. 0 Conor (No. 328, dated 5th July 1899) to think it possible that the Sultan might himself broach the subject of Koweit; and he suggested, that in that case, while avoiding as far as possible a definite statement respecting the independence of Koweit, he might say that it would be a satisfactory arrangement for both England and Turkey if the Sultan would agree not to cede any of his rights in those parts to other Powers. This proposal was approved, subject to a limitation proposed by the India Office (18th July 1899) that nothing should be said which might hamper us in giving effect to our obligations under the Koweit Agreement (to Sir N. O'Conor, dated 25th July 1899). Before, however, this permission could be acted upon, reports were received from the Consul at Busrah, that the Turks had appointed a harbour master to Koweit; that the Sheikh had declined to receive him ; that a renewed attempt to appoint a native of Koweit as harbour master had been ordered from Constantinople; and that the Turkish military authorities were advocating strong measures. It was also rumoured that the Turks proposed to establish a custom house at Koweit. The India Office (7th September 1899) in view of the embarrassment which might be caused by acquiescence in sunh an exercise of the rights of sovereignty bv the Porte, recommended to the Foreign Office that the Turkish Government should be informed that Her Majesty's Government had entered into engagements with the Sheikh of Koweit as an independent ruler, and were not disposed to recognise any infringement of his independence; or, at least, that it should be intimated that the authority of no Turkish official at Koweit would be recognised. The Foreign Office thereupon instructed Sir N. O'Conor to warn the Porte at once that, while Her Majesty's Government had them selves no designs on Koweit, they had friendly relations with the Sheikh ; and that a very inconvenient and disagreeable question would be raised if an attempt were made to establish Turkish authority or customs control at Koweit without previous agreement with Her Majesty's Government. At the same time they requested the Admiralty to send a ship to Koweit to protect the Sheikh against overt acts of aggression by the Turkish authorities ; but, on receipt of a telegram from Sir N. O'Conor representing the inexpediency of1899. 5 this latter step in the existing circuinstances, H.M.S. ' Sphinx ' was ordered Admiralty merely to call at Koweit and proceed without makin^ any stay. to Fore, S n In his Despatch No. 440 of the 13th September 1899, Sir N. O'Conor reported that he had carried out his instructions, and had received an 1S99. ' assurance from the Minister for Foreign Affairs that no further attempt Political, would be made to insist upon the appointment of the harbour master; that 2299 the Ottoman Government had no intention of establishing a custom house at 2332-3/99. Koweit; and that the despatch of a military expedition was not in contem plation, as, though such an expedition had been proposed by the Vali, the Sultan did not consider it worth the risk or expense. Jn a Despatch written on the following day Sir K O'Connor reported that it had been represented to him by Anthopoulo Pasha that the &gt;ultan was much disturbed by his (Sir N. O.Conor's language with regard to Koweit, J atcd ! 'J 1 ' which appeared to indicate a desire on the part of Her Majesty's Government ' tpr ''' to interfere with His Majesty's liberty of action in Turkish territory. Sir X. 0 Conor replied that it would be better to leave no door open for mis understanding, and he repeated his language of the previous day, emphasising the points that IFer Majesty s Grovernment had no aggressive intentions in those parts, and that it depended on the Ottoman Government not to raise an intricate and unpleasant question without necessity. He added that Her Majesty's Government were in most friendly relations with the Sheikh of Koweit and could not pass without notice any hostile action taken ag'ainst him ; but he avoided the direct issue of the territorial doDendencv of the Sheikh. In a further Despatch Sir K O'Conor reported that he had had a further conversation with Tewfik Pasha, in which he again impressed No. 443, upon the Foreign Minister the desirability of not now raising a question date&lt;1 15tb about Koweit, reminding him that in 1883 Lord Granville had informed Sei&gt;t ' 189 ^ Eustem Pasha that the Turkish right of sovereignty over the El Katar Coast had never been admitted by Her Majesty's Government. Tewfik Pasha agreed in considering it inexpedient to raise this awkward question. The language held by Sir N. O'Conor was approved by Her Majesty's Poiitical G-overnment. ' 2369 99.' In his Despatch No. 434 of the 13th September, Sir N. O'Conor 93 ;o/9&lt;, reported the steps taken by the Consul at Busrah in fulfilment of the promise ~ that Her Majesty's Government would do what they could to protect the estates of the Koweit chiefs at Fao. Mr. Wratislaw had on the 26th July, in accordance with instructions conveyed to him by Sir N. O'Conor in July! expressed to the Vali a hope that an equitable settlement would scon be ( 2iu4 / 99 ) arrived at of the rival claims of Sheikh Mubarak and of the sons of the late Sheikh, it being a matter in regard to which Her Majesty's Government were not indifferent. From the conversation which followed, it appeared that Mubarak had made totally inadequate proposals; and the Consul was of opinion that he had been treated by the Porte with ' surprising tenderness,' considering that he had declined to submit to the jurisdiction of the Turkish Courts, within which the estates in question undoubtedly lie, and had for three years appropriated the whole of the revenues. The Consul, notwith standing his instructions {see telegram to Sir N. O'Conor, dated 17th June), had not thought it opportune on this occasion to warn the Yali against taking hostile action against Mubarak till indications of the necessity of such a warning, which were not then apparent, should present themselves. The 2297/99. warning was subsequently delivered to the Vali on the 8th September 1899. Under the date of the 5th October (No. 474) Sir N. O'Conor reported that 7, 99 - Sheikh Mubarak had unsuccessfully attempted to place himself under the 24 '' jG/91) ' protection of the Persian Government, and it appeared from a Despatch of Mr - Wratis - the Consul at Busrah, subsequently (6th November) received, that the Sheikh law ' s De - had written to his friend, the British Agent at Bahrein, to the effect that he No. 40, dated had no great confidence in British support, and that, knowing that the Turks 2Qd Oct. hostile to him, he had applied for Persian protection. (2432/99.) Consul Wratislaw's Despatch* of the 16th September 1899 indicated that # No. 44. Mubarak had then turned his attention to intrigues with the Nakib of Sir N. Busrah and Mohsin Pasha, the military commander, against Hamdi Pasha, O'Conor, the Vali, which ultimately resulted in the dismissal of the latter, and the No - 85 '^ed promotion of Mohsin to be Vali of Busrah. 1900 March S - 36 - B (1996/1900.)G Political, 1660/1900. *No. 2, dated 7tli .lau. 1900.

This result appears, from Consul Wratislaw's Despatch above referred to (No. 46). to have been connected with a new development in the Koweit situation which was ftrst reported by Sir N. O'Conor in his telegram of the 5th January 1900, viz., that; a Commission (including the German Consul- General at Constantinople and the Chief Engineer of the Anatolian Railway) in connection with the German scheme for a railway to Bagdad, which had just arrived at Busrah, intended to try for a concession of a port at Koweit, and that it would start for Koweit in a few days with this view. In a subsequent telegram* from Sir N. O'Conor it was reported that the German promoters appeared to intend to negotiate direct with the Porte, ignoring the Sheikh. A further report, however, was received through the Viceroy from the Senior Naval Officer, Persian Gulf, who visited Koweit on the 13th January, to the effect that the Germans proposed to acquire three or four miles of land at Kathama Bay; that the Sheikh had been asked by Mohsin Pasha to befriend the German mission; and that Captain Denison had delivered to Sheikh Mubarak a message from the Resident, Persian Gnlf (sent with the Viceroy's permission!) to the effect that the Sheikh must inform him (the Resident) of any proposals made to him by the Germans and abide by the decision of the Government of India in the matter. To this message Mubarak had replied on tiie 2]st January stating that he was under our protection and would do all that wo desired. The Sheikh's account of his interview with the Commission, which took place on the 20th January, is given in Mr. Gaskin's report of the 5th February. The Commission had stated that they held a concession from the Sultan, who was largely interested in the undertaking, to make a railway in Turkish territory, and that they desired to extend it to Kathama Bay, which they wished to buy, obtaining certain other lands on lease ; that their present visit was only preliminary in order to secure Mubarak's co-operation and support with the Arab Sheikhs through whose territory the line would pass; that he would be handsomely paid for any land purchased or leased from him; that the trade and importance of Koweit would be greatly enhanced and that he would enjoy the protection of the German Government. Mubarak represented himself as having declared that he was territorially independent of the Sultan ; that the Arabs would not consent to alienate their land, and that he could not help the Germans with the Arab Chiefs. He said that the Com mission finally offered him presents, which he refused, and went away the same day promising further communications from the German Ambassador at Constantinople. The Germans, on the other hand, wrote to their friends at Busrah stating that they were well received by the Sheikh and would certainly take their line to Koweit. Meanwhile, on the 19th January, the Foreign Office had asked for Sir N. O'Conor's opinion as to whether it would be preferable to warn the Porte against taking any decision in this matter without consulting Her Majesty's Government, or to speak to his German colleague confidentially of our relations with Koweit. Sir N. 0'Conor+ was of opinion that the moment was not opportune for taking either of these courses. He suggested as a third course that a hint should be conveyed privately by Sir E. Law to the concessionaires, that any arrangement which would ignore British relations with Koweit would result in delaying the enterprise. This course was sanctioned by the Foreign Office in their telegram No. 27 of the 26th January. Nothing, however, came of it. On the 2nd March the Admiralty communicated to the Foreign Office an extract from a letter (dated 27th January) from the Senior Naval Officer in the Persian Gulf, reporting the proceedings of the German Commission, and representing that it Avould be a great blow to our prestige in the Gulf were any other Power allowed to acquire the port of Koweit. On the 12th March, in view of the visit of the Russian gunboat ' Gilyak,' with the Russian Consul at Bagdad on board, to Koweit, H.M.S. ' Sphinx' was ordered to proceed to Koweit and remain there for a few days. The ' Gilyak ' brought a present from the Russian Consul to the Sheikh. «1900. 7 On the 20tli March Sir N. O'Conor was authorised to inform the Turkish Political, Government and the German Ambassador how matters stood between the 1856 / 1900 - British Government and the Sheikh. In his Despatch No. 130 of the 10th April, Sir N. O'Conor reported a 2027/1900. conversation he had had with Tewfik Pasha on the 9th April regarding the visit of the German Commission to Koweit, in which he again stated that Her Majesty's Government would not regard with indifference any action which would alter the existing state of things or give to another Power special rights or privileges in Koweit. Tewfik Pasha evinced no desire to discuss ^the matter, and Sir Nicholas concluded that the Ottoman Government had already a fairly correct knowledge of our agreement with the Sheikh. On the same day Sir N. O'Conor informed the German Ambassador that Her Majesty's Government had an agreement with the Sheikh of Koweit, which, while leaving the status quo unimpaired, prevented the Sheikh from alienating his territories without the consent of the British Government. Baron von Marschall, wno betrayed some dissatisfaction at this statement, said that he supposed such an agreement would not prevent the construction ot the railway, but that he was quite alive to the disadvantages of alienating British capital. Sir Nicholas replied that he thought there would be no •difficulty in reconciling our interests with those of the llailway Company, and referred to negotiations between the Anatolian llailway and the Euphrates, Tigris and British India Companies. Sir N. O'Conor's action was approved in Lord Salisbury's Despatch No. 89, of the 24th April. On the 21st April a report (dated 29th March 1900) was received from iooo the Vice-Consul at Bahrein that the Anatolian Railway Company was already making preparations for the construction of a pier at Koweit, and this report received some confirmation from a naval report, dated 26th March, 91 .„ to the ellect that the Sheikh had stated that the Germans had been oruo mi™ surveying. • Sir Is. O Conor was not prepared to address the Porte upon these rumours, orrr iqno which he considered improbable, but he suggested the appointment of a ' British secret agent at Koweit to keep a watch upon the Sheikh and secure his fidelity. The rumours were ultimately reported not to have been 592/1900 confirmed. (Viceroys telegram, 7th June.) The reports, however, of German activity were such as to cause special instructions to be proposed tor ^the guidance o! Her Majesty's ships in the event of collisions between oioQ/iorvi the Germans and the Arabs. 123/190 . W ith regard to the proposal to send a secret agent to Koweit, the India India office Oflice were ot opinion that, before this step should be taken, it would be to Foreign advisable to decide what attitude Her Majesty's Government should adopt in Office, dated case the lurkish and German Governments combined in pressing for the ^ a y cession of a site for the railway terminus at Koweit. They further suggested 19 ) 00 '. that it would be well to explain the position more precisely to the Porte and io^iooo) to consider whether some arrangement might not be arrived at with the German Government, under which the construction of the railway works at Koweit might be permitted, subject to a full reservation of the political position acquired by Her Majesty s Government under the agreement. The proposal to send a secret agent was then dropped. At the end of May a proposal was made on behalf of the British India Steam Navigation Company that a weekly service of steamers to Koweit should be arranged. The Foreign Office approved; and on the 3rd July Mr. Lyle, a re presentative ot the Company, proceeded to Koweit, and had an interview with the Sheikh, who agreed to the scheme, provided no quarantine difficulties were involved. However, in the middle of August the Sheikh wrote to Mr. Lyle o'Cmlur notiiying his withdrawal Irom the scheme, probably owing to pressure put No. 291,' upon him by Syed Ahmed, an influential member of the family of the Nakib ( l a ted 15th of Busrah. 1 Aug. 1900. In the meantime a move of importance had been made at Berlin, when on (Political, the 15th June Sir h\ Lascelles had mentioned the Koweit ouestion to Count 2324 / 190 0) Bulow (much in the same terms as Sir N.

Liscelles' wishes. Sir P. Lascelles^ action was approved (No. 126, dated 22nd June). On the 18th June Sir N. O'Conoi* forwarded an extract from the report of the German Commission, which was in favour of the selection of Kathama Bay as a terminus. The report showed the impression left upon the minds of the Commissioners as to the status of the Sheikh. On the one hand, they stated that he had taken such an independent attitude that there could he no question of Ottoman authority in the district. On the other, they said that Kathama Bay was undoubtedly Turkish territory, and that &lt;£ it would not be difficult for the Turks to establish their sovereign rights.' They had seen no sign of the Sheikh intending to place himself under the protection of a foreign Power, as had been rumoured. Under the tlqw regime of Mohsin Pasha) at Busrah, Mubarak's relations with the Turks improved. In June it was reported that he had been created a Pasha and had received a decoration from the Sultan, and the various projects which had been set on foot by Hamdi Pasha for establishing Turkish authority at Koweit, and which were so distasteful to Mubarak, had been dropped. Purtber, his promised visit to Busrah was not for the time insisted upon. It may be mentioned incidentally that the Resident reported early in May (telegram to India dated 10th May) a probability that certain arms which had been connscated by the Chief of Bahrein, and which were about to be restored to Messrs. Pracis Times &amp; Co., would be disposed of at Koweit. The Besident was authorised to negotiate an agreement with Sheikh Mubarak to absolutely prohibit all importation and exportation of arms at Koweit. This agreement was readily accepted by the Sheikh on the 24th May, and he issued on the same day notifications to carry it out. Her Majesty's Government approved of these proceedings on the understanding that without special instructions no effect should be given to the powers granted to British ships by the Sheikh to search vessels in Koweit waters. Early in October a report was received that raids had been made on Nejd territory by Sheikh Abdur Rahman bin Faisal, a member of the Sand dynasty of Riadh, which had been ousted in 1886 by its vassal, Mohammed bin Rashid, Sheikh of the Jebel Shammer tribe. Mohammed bin Rashid had established himself as de facto ruler of Nejd, and had been succeeded by his nephew Abdul Aziz bin Rashid in December 1897. On the 8th October 1900 the Viceroy reported that fighting seemed probable in the neighbourhood of Koweit, and proposed to send Colonel Kemball to iKoweit to report and to warn the Sheikh against action likely to cause interference by the Turks. Her Majesty's Government approved ; and from Colonel Kemball's report (dated 3rd November and received 10th December 1900) it appeared that Mubarak was absent from Koweit when he arrived, and that his son came off to meet Colonel Kemball in a boat flying the Turkish flag. Colonel Kemball was, therefore, unable to deliver the proposed warning, but he gleaned the following information. Abdur Rahman bin Eaisal had been for some years (since 1891) living at Koweit under Mubarak's protection. On the other hand Sheikh Abdul Aziz of Nejd had espoused the cause of Mubarak's enemy, Yusuf bin Ibrahim, and of the sons of Mubarak's murdered brothers. When, therefore, Abdur Rahman appealed to Mubarak for assistance, the latter ordered the Bedouin tribes subject to Koweit to support Abdur Rahman in his raids upon Nejd from the East. Simultaneously Sadun Pasha, a Turkish subject and chief of the Montefik Bedouins, had raided Nejd from the north, whether at Mubarak's instigation, or not, it was not clear. A Despatch ¥ from Consul Shipley carried the story somewhat further. It appeared that the Emir of Nejd with a large force appeared within two and a half days' march of Busrah and demanded satisfaction for Sadun Pashas raid. To this the Yali agreed, and the Emir retired, but his future intentions with regard to the Koweit raid were left in doubt. The main facts of Consul Shipley's report were telegraphed by Mr. de Bunsen on the 1st November, with a recommendation that a gunboat should go to Koweit to watch events. A previous telegranrj* from Consul Shipley had reported matters at Koweit to be quiet and hostilities suspended ; and a subsequent message (dated 2nd November) from Mr. de Bunsen withdrew his recom-1900. 9 Political, 2495/1900. 2487/191)0. 2517/1900. 1213/1900. 2528/1900. • Dated 14th Nov. 1900. To Viceroy, dated loth Nov, 1900, Political. (2529 1900.) 2618/1900. 2543/1900. mendation on the ground that the situation had improved, and that the Emir had promised to remain quiet pending settlement of his claims by an Imperial Commissioner, On the 9th November, therefore, the India Office recommended to the Foreign Office that no further action should be taken for the present; but, a less reassuring account of the state of affairs having been received from the Admiralty on the following clay (10th November) the India Office again addressed the Eoreign Office (14th November) suggesting that a British Agent should be sent in a ship of war to ascertain the true state of affairs and to endeavour to warn the Emir of Nejd that no attack on Koweit would be allowed. It was further suggested that should it prove impossible to resist a land attack with the force available at the moment, the Sheikh should be offered a refuge and steps taken as soon as possible to repulse the invaders. Further news was received on the same day that an attack on Koweit by the Emir of Nejd was considered improbable, but possible ; and that the Turks were reinforcing their garrison at Basrah. The Foreign Office* agreed to the despatch of a gunboat, but added that no active measures should be taken without further reference to Her Majesty's Government. The Government of India were then instructed accordingly, and it was suggested that Colonel Kemball should again proceed to Koweit, On the 15th November a telegram (dated 14th November) from Consul Shipley was forwarded by Mr. de Bunsen reporting that Mubarak's forces had joined those of Sadun Pasha, and that the Turks were sending a force to intervene and compel the combatants to return home. On the 16th November, the Admiral reported that he had taken steps to 2538/1900, strengthen the naval force available in the neighbourhood of Koweit, On the same day (in a telegram received from Constantinople, 17th), Consul Shipley reported that the crisis was over, both forces being on their way home; and that Mubarak was to meet the A r ali about 30 miles from Busrah on the following day, this being regarded as his promised visit. On the 19th November, Consul Shipley reported that Mubarak had returned to Busrah with the Vali, and that they had both been engaged for several hours communicating with Constantinople by telegraph. A report subsequently received (dated 13th November) showed that Mubarak was continuing his endeavours to ingratiate himself with the Porte, and was meetin'; with some success. On the same day (19th November), the Viceroy reported that he had 1256 1900. instructed Colonel Kemball to go to Koweit and, if still necessary, to convey a warning to the Emir of Nejd, On the 26th November, the Viceroy further reported that Colonel Kemball deprecated a visit to Koweit at present on the ground that it would probably encourage Mubarak to take further action against the Emir, who had real grievances against him. The Viceroy concurred ; and, the same view being taken by Her Majesty's Government, instructions were sent that the visit should be postponed for the present. In this connection it should be mentioned that on the 13th October last (2595/1900.) the French Consul at Bagdad, M. llouet, proceeded to Koweit in the French Government vessel 4t Drome,' returning via Fao. The visit appears to .have been arranged suddenly after an interview with the Vali, but the object of it has not as yet transpired. Here the matter stands at the present moment. The position of the Turks has been much improved in Koweit since Mohsin Pasha's appointment as Yali, and it is clear that it was Turkish influence which averted the recent crisis. Moreover, by his recent visit to Busrah, Mubarak has to some extent recognised Turkish suzerainty, and is further stated (Consul Wratislaw's No. 44, dated 22nd November 1900) to have given the Sultan an assurance of his fidelity, and to have promised to cease ' coquetting with foreign Powers.''

It may be added that, a question having arisen out of the seizure ol arms on the ' Hathor,' the shipper of which was said to be a merchant of Koweit, it was decided by Her Majesty's Government that, ' as Koweit is not under ' formal British protection, natives of that country cannot be claimed as ' British protected persons or be justiciable to British Consular tribunals in ' Persia -' C.

Political, 610/99. p.^.—The question of financial liability for the arrangement with Koweit has not been discussed in this paper. It rnay, however, be convenient to record that on the 18th January 1899 the Foreign Office addressed a letter to this Office, in which they stated that the non-alienation agreement with the Sheikh which they had proposed in their letter of 4th January 1899 should be considered separately from the question of a British Protectorate, in regard to which they had stated, in their letter of the 5th December 189S, that action must depend on the power of the Indian Government to afford material support for the maintenance of the Protectorate. They regarded their proposal for a non-alienation engagement as falling short of a proposal for a Protectorate engagement; and they did not contemplate, in asking the assistance of the Indi an Government to w ards obtaining the former engagement from the Sheikh, that that Government would in the slightest ' degree pledge themselves to take any action, or to accept any liability, ' under any circumstances that might arise in the future.'' The local authorities rather exceeded their instructions, and an extended agreement and not merely a non-alienation agreement was concluded. ^ It was however, ratified by the Viceroy with the sanction of the Foreign Office, conveyed in their letter ol' the 14th February lb99. lis. 15,000 avcio paid on ratification to the Sheikh, of which the Foreign Office repaid 500/. to Indian revenues. The question of liabilities, if any are incunctl hereaftei, in respect to the agreement finally concluded will depend upon the letter of the 18th February 1899 mentioned above.A P P E N I) I X.
