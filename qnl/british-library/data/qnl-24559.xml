Undemarcated Perso-Afghan Frontier. I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your despatch No. 1, dated 4th February 1910 (in continuation of previous correspondence ending with my tele gram No. 70, dated 22nd December 1909), in which you inform me that you have recently received a note from the Persian Minister for Foreign Affairs with reference to alleged encroachments of Afghans across the undefined portion of the Perso- Afghan Frontier between Hashtadan and the Namaksar Lake in the ne’gh- bourhood of Musabad, Aynbi and Khushabeh; and that the Ala-u-Saltaneh in his communication refers to representations which, were addressed by tire Viceroy of India to the Government of Afghanistan in 1903, and urges that the necessity of preserving the gwo should be pressed upon the Afghans until such time as the two parties shall have taken the necessary measures with regard to the frontier questions-; and you request me to furnish you with my opinion res pecting the above mentioned charge of the violation of the status quo. 2. With respect to the actual point upon which you desire my opinion I regret that I am at present unable to furnish you with specific details. Some months ago when I received your telegrams No. 35, dated 31st October, and No. 42, dated 9th December, I caused enquiries to be made by Agents from the Kainat in the direction of Musabad; and the result of my enquiry was embodied in my telegram to your address No. 70, dated 22nd December. Your despatch now under reply quotes no fresh allegations from the side of the Persian Government of trespass or alteration of the status quo by the Afghans. Very similar coir plaints have been preferred almost yearly for a good many years past by the Persian Government, and without full details regarding the alleged encroachments it would be difficult to say whether the complaints are well founded or not. The exact situation at Musabad can only be ascertained by actual examination of the state of affairs now prevailing on the spot, and the charge of altering the status quo could only be sifted by comparing previous records of the situation with that which at present pre vails. This can no doubt be done, and during my forthcoming journey to Meshed I propose to take the necessary steps to render myself acquainted with the exact state of affairs as far as can be done through native agents for I do not think it would be advisable myself to visit this disputed tract while the position remains so undefined and so apt to bring about disputes; and I hope b} the end of April to be able to inform you of the result of my enquiries. 3. Meanwhile, however, at the risk of appearing tedious, I have ventured to prepare for the favour of your perusal a note upon the history of the question of the undemarcated Perso- Afghan boundary (more especially the Musabad portion^ Since the time of General Maclean’s mission in 1891/ ^his summary is not without interest as emphasizing the very precarious state of this undemarcated frontier more especially the Musabad portion of it. It will be observed, for instance that both parties have at different times formally claimed in writing that Musabad is “ undoubtedly ” their own territory. The Amir, in 1897 wrote to the Govern- ment of India that “ Musabad is not a disputed tract. It is manifestly a tract. within the limits of the God-given kingdom ” (see paragraph 6 of attached note); . and the Persian Foreign Minister in his note addressed recently to lour Excel-1 lency remarks that “ Musabad is undoubtedly Persian territory. Further one cannot but observe that the recrudescence &lt; f the boundary dispute is one of almost annual occurrence. I am unable to say when it first began C-18F. D.(I have no papers in mv office prior to the year 1891) ; but I observe references to an assurance given by'the Persian Government in the year 1888, that although they maintain their claim to these disputed regions they would preserve the stajws auo unaltered. Alter that General Mac Lean refers to the dispute in 1891; and, in 1895. the Consul-General of Meshed reports complaints of encroachments at Musabad made to him by the Karguzar of Meshed. In 1897, 'the Consul-General of Meshed reported an affair between Afghans and Russian Cossacks at Musabad ; which, although it subsequently appeared that the rumours were unfounded, gave rise to correspondence with the Amir, etc. In 1903, the Persian Government complained to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister of Afghan encroachments across the Khorasan border in the Khaf district. In 1904, the Consul-General, Meshed, reported that in a conversation with the Kashif-ul-Mulk, a Persian engineer on special duty on that frontier, the latter had informed him that in his opinion Musabad was indisputably Persian territory, etc., and a fresh complaint was made to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran by the Persian Government. In 1906, there is correspcndence regarding alleged murders of Persians at Yaz- dan (which lies to the south of the Namaksar Lake) ; and the frontier is reported to be much disturbed. In 1907, the Persian Government again complained to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran regarding Afghan encroachments at Musabad. In 1908, the Persian Government complained to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister that Afghan horsemen have penetrated 40 miles within the Persian frontier. In 1909, the Persian Government twice renewed their complaints regarding Musabad. In 1910, the Persian Foreign Minister again addressed His Britannic Majesty’s Minister on the subject. 4. Even so brief a resume of the history of the case (apart altogether from the prolonged corrt spondence which these incidents have led to with the Amir, the Home Government, etc., the report of the various officers on this section of the iron- tier, and so on) would seem to indicate that the Musabad difficulty is one which has been clamouring for solution for a great many years past, and is of a nature liable at any moment to lead to regrettable breaches of the peace and serious international complications. Nor can it be said that its settlement has been delayed by the refusal of either party concerned to look facts in the face and to submit this case to arbitration. In 1904, the Consul-General, Meshed, reported that the Kashif-ul-Mulk (to whom reference has been made above in paragraph 3) strongly recommended a definition of this portion of the frontier without delay, and had suggested to Tehran that two delegates one from Persia and one from the British Government—should visit Musab/d . . . and settle the boundary between pillar No. 39, and the southern bank of the Namaksar Lake. To this proposal the Government of India agreed, and indeed obtained the permission of the British Government to approach the Amir with the object of securing his consent to the despatch of an Afghan representative to meet the Persian and British representatives on the spot. This proposal was never actually made to the Amir, tut in March 1905, the Amir himself spontaneously proposed to Sir Louis Dane (then at Kabul) that the British Government should appoint an arbitrator for the settlement of the Musabad dispute. And now the Persian Government have again addressed your Excellency on the matter regarding our intervention between the two parties concerned. It will be seen, therefore, that although no steps have hitherto been taken to bring about a ra'p'prochement between Afghans and Persians in this question, or to define the disputed tract, there is (or at any rate has been at one time or another) entire unanimity in thinking that steps should be taken to terminate so undesirable a state of affairs and even as to the method by which this result should be brought about. 5. I do not propose to weary you with further remarks on this matter, but merely to invite your attention to the conclusion to which the perusal of tne papersregarding this boundary has led me ; namely, that a settlement is clearly desirable and that no great practical difficulty should be found in bringing one about. As to geographical and other details which would guide the British arbitra tor in giving his award, these could best be studied on the spot with the help of existing records, local evidence, etc. 6. A copy of this letter, and of the attached summary, has been forwarded to the Government of India for information. No. 106-C. Erd rsed by Major W. F. 0 Connor, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul for Seistan and Kain. Copy of the foregcing, with summary attached, is forwarded to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, for information. Summary of the correspondence which has taken place regarding the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan boundary lying between pillar No. 39 of General Maclean s line and Siali Koh (the nor'.hern termination of Sir Henry McMahon s line) since the year 1891. (1) In the year 1888 an assurance w r as given by the Persian Government to His Biitannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran that the Persians w^ere not justified in allowing new settlers in Khushaba (and so a fortiori at Musabad which lies some 4 miles to the east) or in increasing the cultivation there. Apparently some such assurance wras also given by the Afghans at the same time. (I have in my office no papers regarding these assurances or any events prior to the year 1891. Icnly gather that some such arrangement was made from remarks found in later files.) ('?) In 1891 Major-General C. S. Maclean in his final report on the portion of the boundary demarcated by his pillars Nos. 1 to 39 writes of the country lying between the Kadaona Range and the Namaksar Lake as being “ disputed terri tory,” and as being a dangerous topic. (See his letter to the Government of India, No. 231-A., dated the 6th July 1891, par graph 7.) (3) He mentions that both Chah Surkh and the Tirkisht Valley were Afghan ; and he says that shepherds of Ghorian were then encamped over the wide plain of tl e Sargardan basin, and that to the w 4 5 6 7 est they extended as far as the Kashlushi springs, and to tl e south (he believes) as far as Musabad. Pie adds that the dispute will probably assume an acute form \e:y shortly; and thinks that the line of frontier will have to be drawm so as to divide the Namaksar Lake b etween the two countries. (See paragraphs 8 and 12 of the above- quoted letter.) (4) In 1895 the Consul-General at Meshad reports that complaints had been made to him by the Karguzar of Meshed that the Afghans were preventing the Persians from gathering their crops at Musabad. The Consul-General took the opportunity of reminding both parties of their assurances given in 1888 regard ing the preservation of the status guo in the disputed tract between Hashtadan and the Namaksar Lake, which contains the three places most frequently men tioned in these disputes—Musabad, Khushaba, and Ayubi (the two latter lie a few miles west of Musabad). The Consul-General’s remarks seem to have been taken in good part by both parties, and no further action was taken (see diary of the Consul-General at Meshad for the week ending 2nd August 1895; also his letter No. 43-L., dated 6th August 1895, to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, with enclosures). (5) In July 1895, the Amir writes to the Viceroy of India to say that some dispute has arisen in connection with Musabad and Khushaba. (See his letter, dated 3rd July 1895.) (6) In April 1897, the Consul-General at Meshad reports that a collision has taken place between Afghans and Russian Cossacks at Musabad. This report4 (which was afterwards found to be false or exaggerated) gave rise to a great deal of correspondence between the Government of India and His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and the Home Government. It was also referred to the Amir ) by the Government of India. The Amir in the course of his reply says: “ Musabad is not a disputed tract. It is manifestly within the limits of the God- I given kingdom . . . For many years past a border guard of this Govern ment has been located at that place.” (See Consul-General’s telegram No. 31, dated 30th April 1897, to the Government of India ; the Amir’s letter to the Commissioner of the Peshawar Division, dated 30th May 1897 , etc.) (7) The Government of India in their reply remind the Amir that the bound ary in the neighbourhood of Musabad has never been defined, and that the Persians, equally with the Afghans, maintain their claims to the Musabad lands, although in conformity with an arrangement made with General Maclean that they would preserve the status quo in the disputed tract, they have not pressed their claims. (See Government of India letter No. 56-P. 0., dated 23rd June 1897, to the Amir.) (8) In Octobr 1903, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran telegraphs to the Indian Government that the Persians have complained to him that the Afghans have encroached across the Khorasan frontier in the Khaf district. (See telegam No. 138, dated 14th October 1903, from His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, to the Foreign Secretary, Simla.) (9) Upon this the Government of India write to the Amir. In their letter they remind him of the arrangement made in 1891 that the status quo of this tract should be maintained. They add that the Persians have never relinquished their claims which, equally with the Afghans, they put forward to the Musabad tract, and that any alteration of the status quo by the Afghans is likely to lead to a serious breach of the peace. This is probably the letter referred to by the Persian Foreign Minister as mentioned in your Excellency’s despatch No. 1, dated 4th February 1910, under reply. (See letter from the Government of India to the Amir, No. 66-P. O., dated 22nd October 1903.) (10) In May 1904, the Consul-General at Meshed reports a conversation he has had with the Kashif-ul-Mulk, a Persian engineer, on special duty on the Perso- i Afghan frontier. He quotes the Kashif-ul-Mulk as saying that “ Musabad is indisputably Persian territory.” The Kashif-ul-Mulk further defines the Afghan j and Persian claims, and suggests early delimitation by two delegates - one Persian and one British. (See Consul-General, Meshed’s telegram to the Indian Govern ment, No. 22, dated 27th May 1904.) (11) In May 1904, the Consul-General, Meshed, telegraphs regarding a report by Captain Winter stating that the Afghans have been building at Musabad, and were enlarging a karez there. And with his letter No. 20, dated the 21st May 1904, he forwards a copy of Captain Winter’s report detailing these encroachments. t in the course of his report Captain Winter mentions that the Afghans have been in actual possession of Musabad for eight years (i. e., since 1894). (See Consul- General, Meshed’s telegram to the Indian Government, dated the 25th May, and* his letter No. 20, dated 21st May 1904.) (12) In June 1904, the Consul-General, Meshed, reports that the Afghans are said to have sown some f even acres of land at Musabad. (See his telegram to the Indian Government, dated 7th June 1904.) (13) The Government of India again address the Amir informing him of the reported cultivation by Afghans at Musabad, which they state is a breach of the status quo and calculated to produce undesirable results. (See their letter No. 53-P.O., dated 25th June 1904.) (14) In September 1904, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran informs the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs that the Grand Vizier states that the Afghans have encroached not merely at Musabad, but also at Ayubi (some miles to the west). (See his despatch, dated the 8th September 1904.)(15) In November 1904, tbe Government of India propose to tbe Secretary of State that the Amir should be asked to depute a representative to meet a Persian representative on the spot in the presence of a British officer to whom the case should be submitted. (See their telegram to the Secretary of State for India, dated 2nd November 1904.) 1 (16) The Home Government approve of this proposal. (See telegram from j the Secretary of State for India to the Viceroy, dated 22nd November 1904.) (17) The Government of India hereupon address Sir Louis Dane (then at Kabul with the Kabul Mission) on the subject authorizing him to communicate with the Amir in the sense desired. (See their letter No. 4601-F., dated 9th December 1904.) (18) In November 1904, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, writes to the Indian Government forwarding a translation of a fnote from the Persian Government regarding alleged Afghan encroachments on Persian territory, and begging that the Indian Government may be urged to take steps to prevent these encroachments. (See despatch, dated 12th November 1904.) (19) Sir Louis Dane reports that the Amir has spontaneously proposed that the f Musabad boundary disputeshould be disposed of by a Biitish arbitrator.” (See his letter to the Government of India, No. 301-K., dated the 21st March 1905, enclosing a translation of an extract of a letter from the Ami:, dated 22nd March 1905.) (20) The Indian Government write to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran forwarding a copy of Sir Louis Dane’s letter quoted above, and stating that as the Persian Government have shown no anxiety during the last few months to make any further move in the matter, it may be allowed to rest ‘ ‘ until the British Government are invited to arbitrate by both parties—Persian as well as Afghan.” (See their letter No. 1432-F., dated 20th April 1905.) I (21) In February 1906, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan, reports a rumour of the murder of eight Persians near ‘ Yazdan (which lies to the south of the Namaksar Lake) ; and says that the frontier generally seems much disturbed. (See his telegram No. 122-C., dated 25th February 1906, to the Government ox India.) (22) In May 1906, Captain Keyes reports that an Agent sent by him found the Afghans in possession both of Musabad and Ayubi. (See paragraph'6 of his “ Note on the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan Frontier, ” dated 1st May 1906.) (23) In October 1907, the Persian Government informed His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, that the Governor of Khaf bad complained of Afghan encroachments at Musabad and Kbushaba. (See telegram No. 93, dated 7th October 1907, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan.) (24) In November 1907, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Turbat-i-Haidari, forwards a report by Duffadar Muzzaffar Khan saying that “there is a dmoni cantonment at Musabad with a detachment of from twenty to thirty Afghan cavalry and infantry. The Afghans cultivate the land round Musafcad which is generally known in Khaf as the frontier.” (See his letter Ao. /0-P., dated 1st November 1907, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed.) (25) In December 1908, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, telegraphs that the Persian Government have complained that Afghan horsemen have pene trated 40 miles within the Kain frontier. (See telegram No. 66, dated 4th Decem ber 1908, to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Seistan.) (26) In October 1909, His Britannic Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, telegraphs that the Persian Government have received a complaint that Afghan officials have encroached on the borders of Khaf and have taken measures to obtain possession of Musabad and Khushaba, and are demanding taxes. (See telegram No. on, dated 31st October 1909, to His Britannic Majesty s Consul, Seistan.)f/K ! |r I C J (27) In December 1909, His Britannic' Majesty’s Minister, Tehran, telegraphs that the Persian Government have again complained of theaction of Afghan offi cials in Khaf.

I have the honour to submit for the information of the Government of India a note on the undemarcated Kain-Afghan frontier which I would request may be substituted for that sent with my letter No. 2-C., dated 2nd January 1908 . &gt; a j 2. The present note contains fuller information on most points touched on, and in it a few errors have been corrected that had inadvertently been made in the previous note. 3. I should explain that the note must he regarded to some extent as presenting an ex-parte view of the case, as the bulk of the information contained in it has been obtained from Persian sources. My enquiries have however been made with great care so as to elicit unbiassed opinions. It would have been possible to make enquiries from the Afghan side through Agents, but iu view of the risk of arousing suspicions, 1 did not consider this course expedient. Note on the Kain-Afghan Feontiee. 1 .— 'Frontier JSiabats. In the present day there are three frontier Fiabats of Kain coterminous with Afghanistan. They are, commencing at the southern end, (1) Duroh, (2) Julga i-Sunni Khana, (3) Zirkuh. Their extent and boundaries are roughly as under :— Duroh embraces the hilly country north of Asperan, which is bounded on the east by the Tag and mountain range of Ataskkhana, and on the west by the hills west of the Tag-i-Duroh. In a northerly direction, it extends to and induces the hamlets of Raktuk and Khuskab. Sunni-Khana extends from the point last named, as far north as (and including) Gazik. On the west it is bounded by the crest of the Mominabad range and on the east by the Dasht-i-Naomed (so called from the blizzards that sweep over it in the winter), known also as the Tag-i-Nammadi. Zirkuh is the district lying to the east of the crest of the Ahangaran range (that lying to the west of the range being called Pusht-i*Kuh). To the east of Zirkuh is the Tag and on the north the village surrounding hamlets of Majnabad. II.— Histoey. Kain and Sunni-Khana. It will be convienent to give a brief outline of the recent history of Kain, especially in its relations with the frontier bulukoi Sunni-Khana, showing inter alia how the Sunni-Khans became subject to the Amirs of Kain, and Persia obtained her present frontier provinces. The individual histories of the Duroh andZirkhu Niabats will be touched on subsequently. Here it suffices to say that since Nadir Shah’s time at any rate—probably much before that—they have always been tributary to one or other of the two more important chief- ships. At the time of the Abbasid Caliphs, Kain (or Tun-o-Kain as it was called by Marco Polo), was one of a number of petty Khanates that together formed the district of Kuhistan, itself a part of the big province of Khorasan. The Arab geographers, writing of this period mention Duroh, Tabbas-i- Masinan (Sunni-Khana) and Zirkuh, and it is clear that even at this early datethese small districts formed part of the c&lt; Kuhistan and not of Herat or Sabzawar. The existence of the Naomed desert stretching all along the Kain frontier affords an obvions physical reason why this should be so. The Amirs of Kain belong to the Arab tribe of Khuzaima that settled in Khorasan about the time of the Caliph Haroun-ul-Raschid. The local tradition is that the first rulers of this tribe were three brothers, Mir Muham mad (Mir Gooch), Mir Mahmud and Mir Hussein, who settled in the Kuh-i- baran. In the days of Mamun, the Caliph’s son, Kain was governed by Tahir- ul-Yomenin of this tribe whose descendants afterwards for some generations ruled Khorasan, The present ruling family obtained the government of Kain in Saffavian times about the year 1705. Their genealogical tree is as under :— MIR MOHAMED. Mir Ibrahim Khan I. I Mir Ismail Khan I. I Mir Alam Khan I. r Mir Ali Khan. 1 Mir Masum Khan. . ! I Mir Alam Khan II. Mir Ismail Khan.

The Sunni-Khana Khawanin are said to be descended from one, Khoja Khan Mohamed, who with three brothers emigrated from Bokhara in the reign of Shah Sufi and settled respectively at Tabbas (Sunni-Khana), Buroh, Kala Kah and Kabul, Their family tree, startirg from more recent times is given as under *•— Mirza Mahmood, MIRZA RAFI KHAN, I Mirza BaqirKhan I Mirza Rafi Khan II. 1 Mirza Abdulla Khan.

Ali Akbar Khan, Haidar3 In Nadir Shah’s time, Kain and Sunni-Khana were separate and rival Khanates, the former under Mir Ismail Klian II, the latter under Mirza Had Khan. The Sunni chief was with Nadir Shah in Merv, where he stayed till his death in 1150 H. (1737). He was succeeded as Khan of Sunni-Khana by his son Mirza Baqir Khan. Mir Ismail of Kain is said to have received a farman from Nadir Shah to subdue Mirza Baqir of Sunni-Khana, but he was defeated and killed in the attempt. Nadir Shah passed through Sunni-Khana on his road to India and received the submission of the Khan (Mirza Baqir Khan), who accompanied him to India and is said to have secured some of the Amarkot treasure. Eor his services he was made “ Beglar begi” of Khorasan and Kerman. The two sons of Ismail Khan of Kain were taken to Meshed by Nadir Shah as well as Khoja Jafir the chief of Duroh. Of the two brothers, Mir Alam became one of Nadir’s favourites, while Mir Masum was sent back to be Governor of Kain. When Nadir Shah was murdered, Mir Alam of Kain sprang into promi nence. He defeated the royal general Yusuf Ali and afterwards his rival, Mir Jafar the Kurd, but himself succumbed to Ahmad Shah. Abdali. He is reputed to have met his death at the hands ef Ibrahim Khan, Kurd. On the death of Mir Alam I, Mirza Baqir of Sunni-Khana became Governor of both provinces (Kain and Sunni-Khana), the sons of the dead chief, named Mir Ali Khan and Mir Alam Khan, going to live with Mirza Baqir at Gazik. In 1163 H. (1749), among a number of notables of the Kain Province that went to Kabul to pay homage to Ahmad Shah, we find the following names :— Mirza Bafi Khan (Sunni-Khana), Mir Masum Khan (Kain), Mirza Qadir Khan of Ghurian (Hakim of Zihun and Zirkuh), Mirza Hassan Khan of Duruksh. Somewhere about 1174 H. (1760), Mir Masum Khan seems to have secured the Governorship of Kain for himself. At this period however and till things crystallised into their present, shape after the last Persian expedition to Herat, the divisions and Khanships of the Kohistan were in a continuous state of change. Duroh under the Khojas ; Neh under the Salaris ; Khusf under the Nakchais, Tun Tabbas, etc., were all semi-independant chiefships;^ either the Khan of Kain or of Sunni-Khana being primus interpares, and obtaining what tribute he could, according to the respective power and influence of the two chiefs from time to time. Certain far mans now in the possession of the Mirzas of Duruksh, which were issued about this time throw some light on the situation then existing. (1) 1175 H. (1761). A farman from Ahmad Shah addressed to Mirza Baqir Khan (of Sunni*Khana) “former (Qadimi) Hakim of Kain and Kerman ”. (2) 1176 H. (1762). A farman from the Amir Timur to Mirza Baqir Khan “ formerly Governor of Kerman and Governor of Kain and Tun . Defers to the revenue of Gazik. (3) 1178 H. (1764). A farman from the Amir Timur to Haji Amir Masum Khan “ Governor of Kain, Kahak and Zirkuh ”. Defers to the stipend of a rewswriter in Gazik. (4) 1181 H. (1767). A farman from the Amir Timur to Haji Amir Masum Khan, “ Governor of the province of Kain, the village of Kahak and the biduk of Zirkuh ”, refers to taivill of Gazik.(5) 1186 H. (1772V A farman from the Amir Timur to one Mirza Ataulia Khan, a revenue officer of Sunni-Khana and “ Kalantar oi Kain ”, directing the payment of certain revenues to Amir Ali Khan of Kain and not to Mirza Baqir Khan of Sunni-Khana. (6) 1188 H. (1774). A farman from Amir Timur summoning Mirza Ataulla Khan to the Darbar. Mir Ali Khan succeeded Mir Masum Khan as Governor of Kain about 1184 H. (1770). The two preceding chiefs had had their capital at Sarbisha, whither Mir Alam I had transferred it from Kain. Mir Ali Khan again moved the capital, this time to Mod. Mir Alam Khan II succeeded Mir Ali Khan about 1200 H. (1785), and finally made Birjand the capital of the province. This Mir Alam Khan is said to have assisted Lutf Ali Zand, in his struggle with Agha Mohamed Shah. He also fought on the side of Mahmud against Zaman Khan at Barrah about 1213 H. (1798). Mir Alam II was succeeded by Mohamed Amir Khan about 1235 H. (1819). Somewhere about this time Mirza Bafi Khan, the Chief of Sunni- Khana, is said to have acted temporarily as Governor of Herat. During the rebellion of the Khorasan chiefs in Batteh Ali Shah’s reign, the°Chief of Kain fought on the side of the royal troops under Mahomed Wali Mirza and was killed at Maimana. He was succeeded by Mirza Asadulla his brother. At this period there was acute rivalry between the chiefships of Kain and Sunni-Khana, which culminated in Mir Asadulla’s instigating the treacherous murder of the Sunni-Khana chief and his son, by Mir Mohtashim of Sarbisha. By this deed, which has never been foregotten, Mir Asadulla got possession of the forts at Burk and Tabbas and virtually of the whole of Sunni-Khana. Mir Ismail Khan, the Sunni chiefs other son, fled to Herat where his nephew Mirza Ismail was already residing ; and in Batch Ali Shah’s expedition against Herat in 1246 H. (1828) both of them fought against the Shah’s forces. Mirza Asadullah of Kain on the other hand supplied a contingent to the royal army. In Mahomed Shah’s expedition against Afghanistan in 1253 H. (1837), Mirza Asadulla again assisted the Shah’s forces, and when Ghurian was taken, he was made for a short time Governor of that place. A reconciliation was at this time effected between him and the Sunni-Khana family, resulting in Mir Ismail Khan returning to Sunni-Khana and the Sunni chiefship becoming again independent of Kain under Mahomed Wali Khan (Mirza Bafi Khan II). In the Turkoman and Hazara raids which shortly after this event devas tated Kain territory, the Sunni chief was suspected of giving his co-religionists some assistance. Some desultory fighting took place and in revenge for the murder of the old Sunni Khan, the son of Mir Mohtashim of Sarbisha, Mir Mahomed, was, treacherously killed by Atta Mahomed Khan. About 1258 H. (1842), Alla Yar Khan, Asaf-ud-Douleh, accompanied by his two sons, the Salar and Mohamed Ali Khan, made an expedition to Kain to extract revenue from Mir Asadulla. The latter fled to Herat, leaving his son Mir Alam Khan in Kain. The Asaf-ud-Douleh, after staying seven months in Kain, returned with the Salar to Meshed, taking with him Mir Alam Khan and leaving his son Mohamed Ali Khan in charge of Kain. Mir Asadulla after some time succeeded in obtaining the assistance of the Afghans and of a Sistani army under Sardar Baza Khan, and advanced against Mohamed Ali Khan. A battle was fought at Neh, in which the local troops were victorious and Mahomed Ali had to fly to Meshed. The story of how Mir Alam Khan after this escaped from his captivity in Meshed with a single retainer is a favourite one with local historians. Brom there he managed to reach Herat wiiere he was received by Yar Mohamed and given the village of Kaligird near Herat, which is now the private property of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Then came the Salars rebellion, in which Yar Mohamed Khan and Mir Asadulla helped the 4Shah’s troops. Mir Asadulla shortly after this [about 1265 H. (1848)] went to Tehran, and during his absence a formidable raid (or invasion) which forms an interesting story, but too long to detail here, was made on Kain territory by Afghans and Hazaras under Bahbud Khan, and an attempt was made to capture Mir Alam Khan. The Afghans however were outmanoeuvred and 22 Afghan heads were sent to Mohamed Shah at Tehran, resulting in Mir Alam being made Sarhang. Another Afghan raid was made shortly afterwards, in which Idle Afghans looted Zirkuh among other places. According to the “ Nasik-ul- Tawarikh” , Mir Alam Khan drove out the Afghans and recovered the captured property at Kabuda, which is pescribed as “close to Afghan terntory”. Heads were as usual sent to Tehran. In 1268 H. (1851), Sultan Murad Mirza, Hissam-ul-Sultaneh, despatched a force with guns from Tehran under Sartip Pasha Khan for the final subjection of Sunni-Khana. The strong and very picturesque fort at Furk, which has always been the Sunni-Khans* stronghold, was taken and Mirza Rafi Khan fled to Herat. Mir Alam Khan was again rewarded for his services. On Pasha Khan’s return to Tehran, he left a garrison at Furk. Sunni-Khana thus came finally under Persian rule and was incorporated in the province of Kain. The chief of Sunni-Khana, Mohamed Wall Khan (Rafi Khan III), having failed to get help from Herat, went to Tehran and being recommended by Pasha Khan, who was also a Sunni, was made Governor of Sunni-Khana under the Amir of Kain with an assignment on its revenues of Tomans 500. On his way back from Tehran, he was murdered at Saman by an emissary of the Kain chief # He was succeeded as Khan of Sunni-Khana by Haji Mir Ismail Khan. From this time however the Sunni-Khana chiefs have owned themselves feudatory to the Amir of Kain, and though their sympathies undoubtedly turn towards Afghanistan rather than Persia, there has never been any question as to which side their allegiance was due. In the last Persian invasion of the Herat province Mir Alam Khan took a prominent part. The results of this war however have little bearing on the present issue, for though after the capture of Herat Alam Khan was rewarded with the Governorship of parts of Farrah, the status quo ante was restored by the Treaty of Paris. Duroh. Very little is known of even the recent history of Duroh. A sanad issued in the reign of Shah Abbas shows that the hereditary Katkhuda of the place at that time was one Mulla Ali Shah. The Akhund family of Duroh and the Duroh people known as “ Mulla All’s” both claim this individual as their ancestor. The present NaiVs family is sprung from the Khoja brothers that are said to have come from Bokhara during Shah Sufi’s reign. It is not known at what time the family obtained the chiefship of Duroh, but it is believed that till about Mir Asadulla’s time, on account of their connection with the Khans of Sunni- Khana, they were independent of Kain. The Durohis say they became Shiahs 300 years ago. In the battle of Neh about 1263 H. (1846), in which Mir Asadulla of Kain with the help of the Sistanis defeated the Asaf-ud-Dowleh’s son, the Duroh chief Khoja Mohamed Raza was fighting with Mahomed Hassan Khan of Neh on the losing side. The Durohis were afterwards disarmed by Mir Asadulla and since that time have been subject to the Amirs of Kain.1 5 others, Khoja Abdul Hussein, (Naib. Dismissed by Shaukat-ul-Mulk. Died in Sistan where his sons live now). ZlRKUH. The history of the Zirkuh buluk is very obscure, and till the numerous scmads and farmans in the possession of the leading families in Kain (and probably Ghurian also) comes to be examined, the course of events since even so recent a time as that of Nadir Shah, cannot be known with certainty. The earliest light on the subject from such local sources as have been available, consists of &amp; Jarman now in the possession of Abdul Jawad Khan of Buruksh. This consists of a royal order dated 1124 H. (1712), addressed to the Wazir of Kain and referring to arrears of revenue due from Said Ali Beg, Yazdani. This Said Ali Beg seems to have been a servant of the Beglar Begi of Khorassan and on this acconnt had refused payment to the Wazir of Kain. The Beglar Begi is ordered in this document to recover the revenues and pav them to the Wazir. A local tradition says that this Said Ali Beg was Hakim of Zirkuh, but the identity of this person is not quite certain, and more investigation is necessary. The account given me independently by two local historians is that Said Ali Beg, Yazdani, was really Said Ali Khan of Duruksh, from whose son, Mirza Mohamed Amin, the present Duruksh family is sprung. Acccording to this version, Yazdan became depopulated owing to Turkoman raids in Mirza Mohamed Amin’s time, when this hakim left the place and returned to his family in Duruksh. Mirza Mohamed Amin’s sons were Mirza Hasham and Mirza Sadiq Beg, the latter of whom is said to have been made hakim of Duruksh and Zirkuh by Nadir Shah in 1347 H. (1734.) The Hukumat of the huluk of Zirkuh however was taken from Sadiq Beg by Mir Alam Khan of Kain. Sadiq Beg subsequently went to Shah Mahomed’s court in Kabul and received the rank of Wazir. Sadiq Beg’s sons were Mirza Hassan and Khan Mirza. Khan Mirza’s son was Haji Mirza Said Khan, whose daughter married Amir Alam Khan of Kain, and, according to this account, gave him private possession of the Yazdan property which the Kain ruling family now hold. The Kahalas are said to be in the Shaukat-ul-Mulk’s possession. This story is no doubt substantially correct, but it does not accord with a genealogical tree supplied to me by the Duruksh family in the important respect that the latter makes Mizra Mohamed Amin (the Duruksh ancestor), the son of Mohtashim and not of Said Ali Beg, (c Yazdani.” It is of course possible that the latter’s name has been inadvertently omitted. Another story is that the sole heiress of this Said Ali Beg was married to Mirza Said Khan of Duruksh and the latter’s family thus became owners of the property. The genealogical tree supplied me by Abdul Jowad Khan of Duruksh is as under :—8 It has been mentioned in the historical note about Kain, that in 1163 H, (1749), Mirza Hassan Khan “ of Duruksh ” and Mirza Qadir Khan of Ghurian went to pay homage to Ahmad Shah. This Mirza Qadir Khan was described as “ Hakim of Zikun and Zirkuh.*’ I have not been able to find anything out about him. It is possible he is an ancestor of Kahq Had Khan the present Governor of Ghurian. I have also heard that his family was a branch of he Huruksh Mirzas. Anyhow it seems that his appointment as Hakim ot Zurkuti and Zihun was only temporary. Accounts agree that in Ahmed Shah’s time When the Khan of Sunni- Khana was as powerful as the Amir of Kain and until the Sunni chielsnip was absorbed, the Hakim of Zirkuh paid tribute to the Khan of Barmiau (Sunni-Khana). It is said that Kilich Khan, Timuri, at one time included Zirkuh in his possessions. The frontier villages of Majnabad and some other hamlets now in Zirkuh till quite recently formed part of Kliaf, but were bought from the Timuri chief by the late Mir Alam Khan. Ill— PuesenT situation. (a) Buroh and Lahnu. The Naib is Khoja Jan Muhammad. He has an assignment on the reve nue for the maintenance of 6 sowars and 4 jambazes. The revenue is about Tomans 850 (included from old time and in the Mustansir-ul-Mulk’s settlement in t\\Q jama of Sunni-Khana.) The people of Buroh are exempt from the payment of poll tax or sari and are in consequence liable for militia service lashkar kashi. There is a Customs house at Buroh subordinate to that at Ahwaz. The present Mirza is Ali Akbar, who was transferred here in connection with a case of extortion from Afghans (mentioned under the head Sunni-Khana). The authorized route across the frontier is thus described by the Customs Bepartment:— “Prom Kandahar and Parrah to Birjand by Bamdam (Afghan) by Chah- i-Sagak, Chashma-PShutaran, Buroh. The only karez or cultivated land in this part of the frontier which might conceivably be held to come within the disputed area (though the Afghans have so far made no claim or taken other action with regard to it), is that of Asperan (As-i-Parian). The ruins at this place testify to its having once been a big place, but no one that I have spoken to has been abxe to afford any clue as to when and why it was abandoned. The reason put forward for the aban donment of other big villages on this strip of frontier is the lurkoman raids and it is possible that Asperan should be included in the same, category. The history of the recent cultivation of Asperan is as follows Some 8 or 10 years ago one Ali and his father, Muhammad Afghan refu gees (and reputed robbers), cultivated a little land from the Asperan water in company with a man of Buroh named Akbar (a Mulla Ali). Ihe latter sold bis share of the karez to Kat khuda Hamza and Ali Morad (Tuni) of Sistan for Krans 400 some 7 years ago. The latter worked the karez for some months with Ali and then having a dispute with him abandoned it. In 1908, Said Khan (Mamasseni), employed by the Sistan Consulate as Levy Jamadar, petitioned the Shankat-ul-Mulk for the grant to him of the Asperan karez. As All was paying no revenue, the Governor agreed to the grant on the condition of Said Khan maintaining there a post of Baluch to guard the frontier. Asperan, it should be noted, is situated on the direct route from Seistan to Kain that passes through a corner of Jowain to the north of the Hamun-i-Sabari and robberies were frequent.When this grant was made, objection was raised by the Salaris of Neh, the old ruling family of this buluk, on the ground that they held documents (Mahr-namas) proving them to be the owners of Asperan as well as of Surtigh, Khoja do Chahi and other Jcarezes in the Duroh-Lahnu district. Their claim as regards Asperan seems to have been accepted, as they executed a deed mak ing over their rights to the Shaukat-ul* Mulk as pish hash. (There were other points regarding the Neh revenue settled at the same time.) The man Ali, who had been evicted, was given in exchange another property in the Duroh district called Mahi End and he executed a formal agreement accepting the exchange. Katkhuda Hamza and Ali Morad do not seem to have put in a claim. Khoja Jan Muhammad of Duroh raised an objection to Asperan being given to Said Khan, as he claimed Asperan as his private property. His claim was rejected as he could bring forward no evidence, while the salaries claim had been held to be good. ; When M. Miller was Eussian Consul in Sistan, it is said that he made endeavours to purchase Asperan from the Naib of Duroh. Jan Muhammad had at that time been temporarily deprived of the Naibship and owing to that it is said negotiations fell through. I have not myself seen the Salaris 5 documents referred to above. Their rights to Asperan are, it may be mentioned, altogether denied by the Durohis, especially those known as Mulla Alis. This community say they are Baluch that came from Hamadan in ancient times. The head of the com munity, Bahran, showed me a sanad of Shah Abbas Saffavi, confirming one Mulla Ali Shah in the Katkhudaship of Duroh, with which he contends the other hamlets are included. He also holds another sanad to the same effect, alleged to be from Eatteh Ali Shah—but of this the seal has been torn off. The right of the Mulla Alis to this sanad is not uncontested. The Akhimd family of Duroh state that the Mulla Ali Shah to whom the Shah Abbas sanad was addressed was an ancestor of theirs and that the &lt;s Mulla Alis 55 stole it from them. In the present year, Said Khan’s title has been confirmed by the Hissam- u-Douleh. f There are two karezes now open at Asperan, the produce being about 20 Tabriz kharwars of wheat. According to the Naib of Duroh and all others whom I have spoken to on the subject, the old political frontier was the Harut Eud. Force of circum stances has caused the abandonment of this line by the Persians and the Koh-i- Atashkhana is now considered the frontier. Until the country between the Koh-i-Atashkhana and the terminal pillar of the Sistan boundary comes to be surveyed it is difficult to say where a line joining these points would fall as regards Asperan. I think it is clear however that so far as our present knowledge goes, the latter place must be considered Persian. A fairly reliable authority told me that Chah Eeg is in Persian limits and Sherak-i-Shah Beg on the Asp eran-Sistan road on the frontier. As regards grazing rights, the information given by Captain Keyes in his note of 1st May 1906 has been generally corroborated by my informants. Where rights are undefined however, as they are in the present case, exact agreement in details cannot be expected. According to my informants, even in old days when the Harut was consi dered the frontier, Afghan maldars had prescriptive grazing rights beyond this 9to tlie west. At the present time Afghan maldars have till recently grazed their flocks up to the following points. Surtigh ; Hangur and Hafted Hud (Lahnu)j Chah Sagak ; Ckah Surkh , Khargas Ah, Chah Shur. Prom reports that have reached me, however, it seems that of late Afghan maldars have been discouraged grazing their flocks on the Persian side or the recognised frontier and in some cases have been turned back by the chaunt sowars. This country is also grazed over by the Seistan maldars. The l a ff er do not seem to enjoy any reciprocal rights as regards grazing on the Afghan side. I have had'numerous cases recently reported to me of Afghans having warned the Seistan maldarsh&amp;ok from transgressing the imaginary frontier and fined them for doing so. As already mentioned, there is a highway from Seistan to Duroh that passes through Afghan territory north of the Hamun. The Afgans levy a kafila- bashi ” fee on Persian traders and others using this road. In October 1908 a case occurred in which one ]\Iir Hussain Sultan,?Arab (a servant of the Governor of Kain) was proceeding towards Kain by this road when he was held up by Afghan chauni sowars at Shorak-i-Shah Beg and certain property was confi scated in lieu of tazhara fees. Another caravan was similarly held up at the same time and close to the same spot. The Persian Poreign Minister brought the matter to the notice of the British Legation, apparently alleging that the Afghan sowars had come 40 miles within Persian territory [Legation telegram 66, dated 4th December 1908]. As a matter of fact the point Shorak-i-Shah Beg is just about where the frontier line would run. The Afghans do not seem to take any grazing tax from maldars passing through Afghan territory from Seistan to Kain, but a tax only (possibly un authorised) of a sheep and Krans 2 to 4 per rama (flock). An old shikari, who I think may be considered unbiassed, told me that the Atashkhana range was the recognised frontier of Duroh. As regards grazing taxes, he corroborated the Naib’s statement as given above. North of the Koh-i Atashkhana, Chah Khargosh is recognised to be in Duroh limits, while Damdam and the Dak-i-Tundi are on the frontier line. The Afghan chaunis on this section of the frontier are :— Chashma Khash. —Situated, as far as I can gather, some 8 miles west of Kala Kah (Sher-i-Kuh). The sowars from this chauni patrol as far as to the west as Shorak-i-Shah Beg. Tundi. —Situated to the east of the Koh-i-Tundi. Taghah-i-Se Chahi. —Situated I believe some 16 miles east of the Shela, Main-i-Tag. (&amp;) Sunni-Khana. The Naib, or Khan as he is called, is Mahomed Ibrahim Khan, son of Mir Ismail Khan. The revenue is Tomans 4,932 (including that of Duroh).11 The Khan has an assignment on the revenue of this julga for the upkeep of 84 sowars. These are distributed as under Sowars of Mahomed Ibrahim Khan and other Khawanin Tao'hab. —Mirza Mohamed Hassan Khan and Mirza Ataullah Khan Ishaq—Aziz Beg and Sher Dil Gazik.

Yusuf Khan claims that his uncle, Zainulab* din, was rightful chief of Lash Jowain and a rival of the Ishakzai family, but I cannot find any support for this story. He was, it seems, in 1856 Governor of Samur and, being a Shiah, handed the place over to the Ihsam-ul-Sultaneh’s troops, but on the country being restored to the Afghans, as he would have found residence in his own country intolerable, he was given an asylum in Persian territory and Dastgird (a slice out of Sunni-Khana) as a JSiabat. Under the Shaukat-uLMulk, the Naib of Dastgird was Sarhaddar, and with his son Nazar Ali Khan used to take an annual tour along the frontier. He does not bear the best of characters and is more than suspected of being a receiver of camels stolen from across the frontier. The present Sarhaddar is the Naib (or Khan) of Sunni-Khana himself, but there are no outposts of any sort maintained nor is any watch kept to prevent aggressions. There was some talk last year of posts being established at Yazdan, Maliki (Zirkub), Gulwarda and Lab-i-Sher (Sunni-Khana), but nothing was done. The principal customs bureau on the Kain-Afghan frontier is at Ahwaz, the Mirza in charge being one Mirza Mohsin Khan. He has six sowars under him for inspection and patrol. The routes authorised for traders are:— Prom Sabzawar by Yazdan and Patargan. Prom Ghurian by Kobat-i-Chah and Kalaryan. Prom Herat by Yazdan, Shorab and Gulwarda. Prom Anardara by Chah Keg, Puza Jangal and Kalata.at Duroh. .. ^ , , Durino' mo4 summers, Afghan hheh encamp at the wells on the Dasht, most ofwhirare inrput^l/ within Perdan lMts,. but as by no means always coincide with political boundaries, the point has much significance. Tn the end of 1907 the Naib of Darmian made a tour with sowars round the frontier and visited Chah Puza. They were not allowed to approach he Afghan but pitched their tents some 300 yards away, ht ‘has po had been considered Afghan territory, I think it may be safe y assumed that they would have been allowed to pitch tents there (Diary, 22nd January). In September 1908 some Afghans travelling to Birjand from Herat had their caravan confiscated by the Customs Mirza at Ahwaz on a false charge of smuggling. The case was taken up by His Majesty s Consulate, with the result that a Belgian official was deputed to Ahwaz to investigate the case. The conclusion arrived at was that the Afghans could ^ ot be . con ™ t a e i f th ° f smuggling, hut had transgressed the Customs regulations by leaving the autho- rised g road at Sherao. They were stated to have been found 4 to 2 farsakh n to 2 miles) from this point (Diary, 17th January 1909). The fact that the Afghans did not plead that Shorao was in Afghan territory, is m some degree relevant to the present issue. The point was one which of course it would not have been expedient to raise on their behalf. As regards the line of actual occupation by the Afghans, this cannot be taken to be much further west than the line of chamis. Not a few people whom I spoke to on the point (Persian subjects, but with no personal interest m the matter) were of opinion that these chaunts actually marked the frontier line. But this is not the frontier as generally accepted. The latter is I think fairly accurately indicated by the location given to the following fixed pom s with regard to the frontier by a consensus of opinion of maldars and others questioned:— „ ... Dak-i-Tundi On the frontier h D e. Kulla-i-Hassan Khani ... ••• ••• Ditto Shela, Mian-i-Tag- ... ... ••• I)itto Koh-i-Khargu Koh-i-Hazar Sangu Koh-i-Gulwarda Within Persian territory.

(c) Zirkuh. The present Naih of Zirkuh is Haji Abdul Ali Khan, the son of^ Haji A^-a by his wife who was a sister of the late Amir Alam Khan III. He is not a hereditary Naib. The revenue of Zirkuh is Tomans 2,416. Sowars are main tained for the defence of the frontier and distributed as under :— Bamrud under the Mirzas of Bamrud ... ••• ••• Sharakt (Charakhs) under Sheikh Mahmud Darraij under Jaffar Khan ... ... ... ••• Garma-i-Taj Khan under Mahmud Jafir and Ismail Khan (Timuri) Isfidin ... ... ... ••• ••• Bunniabad ... ... oo® ••• Bohnabadunder Khoja Mirza Zaman ... ... iaKatkhuda Sahib Dad also maintains 6 sowars at Majnabad. (For Customs see note under Sunni-Khana). The only cultivated or cultivable lands which could possibly come within the disputed area are those at Maliki and Yazdan (including Kabuda and Atashan and adjacent Karezes.) Maliki is a Karez in the Dasht-i-Naomed about 16 miles east of the foot of the Ahangaran range, producing some 10 kharwars of grain. It is the private property of the Hissam-u-Douleh in whose share it fell when his father’s property was divided. The Hissam-u-Douleh also owns the following villages in this part:—Muhammadabad, Ahmedabad, Kabuda, Yazdan. The Hissam’s for the above properties is Mir Ismail Sultan, Arab of Nasruddin near Ahwaz. It is possible that the Reg-i-Maliki will be included in the Afghan claim, though I do not know of any evidence that could be brought forward in sup port of the contention. Possibly an incident which took place in 1907 when the Hakim of Ghurian, Khaliq Dad Khan, seized some Afghan refugees at this spot, will be cited as evidence of Afghan rights, and I therefore give the following details:— Khan Muhammad Khan and Kadir, Afghan refugees, with their families, had been settled for some time at Chah-i-Tag in the Reg-i-Maliki, a well which is said to be situated between Maliki and Shorao. In May 1907, Kaliq Dad Khan, Hakim of Ghurian, with about 50 sowars, appeared on the spot and carried them off. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, who was called on to explain why he had not reported the occurrence, telegraphed in reply to the Foreign Minister stating that the refugees were encamped on the Dasht-i-Naomed between Persian and Afghan territories. As their only occupation was robbery, he had written to the Governor of Herat asking for their removal. The telegram concluded by saying that Afghan sowars never entered Persian territory and the report that they did so is without foundation. I took a photograph of this telegram which is capable of being used as an important Persian admission (though I believe quite incorrect), and it is filed in the Seistan Office. Yazdan was formerly a large and important place and has been described to me as the bandar of Kain from the east. It is said that including those of Kabuda and Zainulabdin, situated a little distance away, there were in all 72 Karezes. The present abadi of Yazdan was the joint private property of the Hissam-u-Douleh and his late sister, known as the Nawab. On the latter’s death her property was divided. There are in Yazdan about 10 families of cultivators and the produce is about 40 kharwars (14,5001bs.) of grain. I think it is probable that when the Kain frontier comes to be demarcated, the ownership of Yazdan with the adjacent Karezes will be contested. My opinion, formed from such documentary and other evidence as I have been able to discover, is that Yazdan and its Karezes has always been considered part of Zirkuh, the Zirkuh buluk itself beins from old times under the Chief of Sunni-Khana or of Kain according to which of the two was predomi nant for the time being. A far man of 1124-H. (1712), of which mention is made in the note on the history of Zukuh, shows that at this time the revenue of Yazdan was paid to Kain and not to Herat, which was also at that time under the Suflavian Kings. The following points are worthy of note for further investigation {a) Yazdan is I believe not to be found in the list of villages in Zirkuh in the revenue Kitabcha compiled by the Mustansir-ul- Mulk in 1906.14 (&amp;) A Darmian Mirza told me that Tazdan was at one time cultivated ^ by “ Daulat Shahis ** (Daulatzais ?) of Herat, the sons of one Ata Muhammad of Herat. I have heard no confirmation of this from any other source. (c) It is said that another daughter of Haji Mirza Said Khan of Duruksh V married Ahmed Khan of Sabzawar, the latter thus becoming the private owner of one or more of the Yazdan Kareses, possibly that at Atashan. This Ahmed Khan was subsequently killed in Afghanistan and the Duruksh girl brought back. It is possible that Afghan claims to Atashan are connected with this incident, but if, as seems to have been the case, Yazdan was part of Zirkuh the private acquisition of one or more of its Karezes by Afghan subjects would not affect the situation. At Atashan or Atash Khun there is a chatmi of 10 Afghan sowars. At the present time the Karez is not worked. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk sent men to open it in the spring of 1907, but they were prohibited from working by the Afghans. In a telegram sent by the Shaukat-ul-Mulk to the Eoreign Minister in °August 1907 on the subject of the capture of the refugees at Maliki (referred to above), he states that he had previously represented the action taken by the Afghans in this matter both to Tehran and to the Asaf-u-Douleh (theii Governor-General of Khorasan) but had been told not to raise the question. It is said hy some that the Atashan Karez did not form one of the Yazdan Karezes, and the point is at least doubtful. The Karez at Zainulabidin was one of the 72 Karezes of Yazdan. I was told that it was redug by one Zainulabidin of Sharakht (Sharaks) about 15 years ago and named after him. It is not worked now. Kabuda is a spring of alkaline water near Yazdan. The land around it is cultivated by Yazdan people for the Hissam-u-Douleh whose private property it is. As regards grazing rights, the Dasht*i-Naomed is open to all, and as stated above, I think that the presence or not of Afghan malda^s affords no indication at all as to ownership. During the spring and early summer there are Afghan maldars all over the Dasht-i-Naomed particularly at Maliki, Chah Zugal, Mahzangi *and Shorao. No sargalla or grazing tax is demanded from these Afghan maldars and as was pertinently remarked to me they would not pay it if it was. An incident which occured in 1907 may be mentioned :— Two Seistani sowars that had accompanied the family of the Karguzar (Ikram-ul-Mulk) to Meshed were returning, and having business with Sber Muhammad, an Afghan refugee, who had been at Maliki for some years past, went out of their way to stop the night at his camp. The next day one of the Seistani sowars, Kohandil Khan, was murdered on the road to Ahwaz. The survivor Asghar stated that an Afghan risala sowar arrived the previous evening at the Rhel and he and the son of Sher Muhammad followed them and treacherously attacked them, killing Kohandil Khan. Asghar fled, and while the Afghans were stripping Kohandil’s body the risala Sowar’s horse came after him and he went off with it. Sher Muhammad and his people immediately decamped to Afghanistan. The Karguzar took up the case very strongly and sent reports to the Persian Government blaming the Shaukat-ul-Mulk for allowing so many Afghan bad characters in the Kainat. * The daJcTe marked in Captain Keyes’ map (faifc/fc-i-Patargun was pointed ont to me ai being 3 dakks :• Jcfetargun lying to the north, Mahzangi to the south of it and Khushaba to the south of Mahzangi.&gt; ■ The leader of one gang, Amir Khan, has been recently extradited by the Hissam-u-Douleh in connection with the murder of another Afghan in Persian territory, and it is hoped that this will have a good effect on the remainder (Diary, 13th August 1909). Although the boundary is undefined, there seems to be a general consensus of opinion among Behluli and Afghan maldars as to where it lies. The line generally accepted, according to my information, is indicated by the relative position with regard to it given to the following fixed points 1 Gulwarda Kuh-i Hassan Khani Kuh-i-Khavgu ... Gulkhand (Gul Khan ?) *Shorao Kohi-Duzd Koh-i-Kabuda ... Kul Birinj Namaksar ... In Persian territory. On the boundary. Persian territory. In Afghan territory. 2 farsakhs in Persian territory. Persian territory. 8 farsakhs in Persian territory. On the frontier line. (A spring only, no cultivation). Half Afghan, half Persian. The position of the spring of Kul Birinj as regards the frontier is doubtful. Most of the people questioned seem to believe it to be in Persian territory. I was however told by both Mohamed Sadiq (the Musabad claimant) and the Katkhuda of Majnabad, Sahib Dad, that it was in Afghan territory. The latter, than whom no one is better acquainted with the frontier, told me that Hamah Kuh was considered in Afghan and Gala Haoz in Persian limits. As regards the Namaksar, Mohamed informed that it was generally held that the frontier line passed through a point in it called “ Se Pala ” (three mounds). No tax is collected by Afghan or Persians from people taking salt from the Namaksar. The Afghan chaimis on this section of the frontier are at Chah Leila, Atashan and Chah Baluch, all situated near the supposed frontier line. IV. General Conclusions. An examination of the history of Kain since Nadir Shah’s time shows that Persia acquired her present frontier districts of Duroh, Sunni-Khana and Zirkuh by force of arms about the year 1268 H. (1851). It seems probable that with the exception of Atashan (which the Persians have not been allowed to cultivate), the cultivated or cultivable lands lying near the present generally accepted frontier have from old times been included in one or other of these districts. These are (1) Asperan, (2) Yazdan and the adjacent Karezes. Asperan, abandoned a great many years ago, must from its geographical position have been dominated by Duroh, which we know to have been a very ancient strong place of the Kain Kuhistan. Its re-cultivation in recent years by Persians has not been objected to by Afghans. Yazdan, with its adjacent Karezes of which Kabuda is one, seems to have been part of the buluh of Zirkuh from old times. We know at any rate that so long as Suffivan times it paid revenue to Kain. The Persians so far as I am aware claim no cultivated or cultivable land in Afghan occupancy. The Atashan land is lying uncultivated though there is an Afghan chauni in that spot that prevents its cultivation by Persians. Atashan is alleged by some to have been one of the Yazdan Karezes and this is d priori * Shorao was reported by Afghan maldars to Captain Keyes to be in Persian territory, vide his note.likely, as it is divided from the nearest Afghan village by a broad stretch of desert. The point is one that requires further investigation. The argument of grazing rights in a matter of frontier has, I think, but little weight. Even if it he admitted that the Afghan malclars have acquired prescriptive rights to graze their flocks over the Dasht-i-Naomed, this could not be cited to prove ownership or even possession. As a matter of fact it seems doubtful whether the freedom of the whole of the Dasht could be claimed by the Afghans as a right. As has been mentioned, the chauni sowars have recently in some instances prevented Afghan maldars from taking their flocks to graze on the Persian side of the supposed frontier. Generally speaking, Afghan occupation at the present time extends up to the line of chaunis. I think the presumption is justified that so far as the necessity of obtaining water permitted, these chaunis were located up to the western limit of what was considered Afghan rights. This is certainly the case from Chah Puza northwards, from and including which point the chaunis are situated on or close to the line generally accepted as the frontier. The four chaunis to the south of Chah Puza, mz., Chasma Kash, Tundi, Tighab and Shibak are situated at some distance from the accepted frontier, but I believe there are no springs or wells further west, at which chaunis could have been established without obvious encroachment on Persian territory. The sowars from Chashma Kash certainly patrol as far west as Shorak-i-Shah Beg. Prom present information I would trace the frontier somewhat as under, and believe the line indicated would be accepted by local people on both sides of the frontier:— Prom the termination of the McMahon boundary to near Shorak-i-Shah Beg. Thence to the Koh-i-Atashkhana, leaving Asperan to the Persians. Thence to Dam Dam and Dak-i-Tundi. From the Dak-i*Tundi it should follow the Shela “ Mian*-i-Tag.” Thence * Also known as the Eud-i-Khai. to Kuh-i-Hassan Khani. From this point it should lie between the chaunis and the Koh-i-Duzd and at Koh-i*Kabuda. Thence to the east of Yazdan leaving all the Yazdan ATarezes to the Persians. It is doubtful whether the Atashan Karez should be included. Kul Birinj is also a doubtful point. The line would then go by Gala Haoz to Se Pala in the Namaksar. This line is identical with the Frontier as sketched in Captain Watson's letter No. 17, dated 30th August 1906. It generally accords with Captain Keyes’ line of actual occupation as shown on his map as far north as the Shela “ Mian-i-Tag.” North of this point the boundary should in my opinion lie to east of Shorao. 16 G.

Molesworth Sykes, C.M.G., His Britannic Majesty's Consul-General and Agent of the Government of India in Khorasan. In continuation of my letter No. 63-P. of the 10th October, I have the honour to forward herewith a translation of a report by a duffadar of my es cort who has just returned from Bu-i-Khaf, and also a copy of extracts of a note written by my Head Clerk who accompanied Captain Winter to Khu- shaba in 1904. Captain Winter’s report forwarded under cover of Lieutenant- Colonel Minchin’s letter No. 20, dated the 21st May 1904, appears to have been based on the information contained in this note. It is improbable that I shall be able to obtain any more information with out personally questioning the Afghan nomads myself, and I consider that this is inadvisable unless the Afghan Government is first informed. Translation of a report by Duffadar Muzaff'ar Khan. I was informed at Bu-i-Khaf that there are 120 black tents of Afghan Hock-owners at Ayubi: the names of their headmen are Kundil Khan and Laj ward Khan. They cultivate the land round Ayubi, which was named after Sardar Aynb Khan when he was fleeing from the Amir. They pay revenue to the Persian Governor of Khaf both for the land and for the grazing. Musabad is about two miles east of Ayubi. There are about 250 houses at ^ ^ Musabad. The name of the headman is Alam Khan. There is a ‘ chauni at Musabad with a detachment of from twenty to thirty Afghan cavalry and in fantry. The Afghans cultivate the land round Musabad, which is generally known in Khaf as the frontier.Between Musabad and Ayubi is the spring of Khushaba. The Khaf sowars telegraphed to the Persian Government a short time ago that the Afghans had taken possession of Khushaba and were inhabiting the ruined houses at the spring. Formerly the Afghan nomads at Ayubi who pay revenue to the Persian Government used to cultivate the land round the spring : but this summer the Afghans at Musabad have prevented them from doing so and have taken the land themselves. Extracts from a note by the Head Clerk of the Turbat-i-Haidari Consulate. I visited Musabad to-day and procured the following information :— About nine years ago, i.e., in 1895, Muhammad Siddik Khan, Deputy Governor of Bakharz, built a fort at Musabad, which place he claimed as his personal property, in order to accommodate his cultivators so as to irrigate the lands from a karez which already existed there. Before the expiry of twelve months after the erection of the fort, and when the cultivators had hardly reaped the first crop the Afghan came and turned them out, taking possession of the building. Since then the Afghans have been in possession of the place. About seven months ago the Afghans erected a post At present the post is unoccupied, as Alam Khan, Babakzai, who is appointed by the Afghan authorities to look after that part of the frontier, is living with about 25 families in black tents at a distance of about 200 yards to the north-east. Since the occupation of Musabad the Afghans have cultivated no lands as the karez has not sufficient water for the purpose ; but I noticed that several men were working at the karez to improve it. On questioning Alam Khan I was told that they intended to improve the karez in order to cultivate the land. HUSSEIN ALI. Yesterday when we arrived in the vicinity of Khushaba we were met by some Afghan refugees, whose headman is called Muhammad Azam, Nurzai. They complained about the high-handedness of the Governor of Khaf. In about half an hour we met another party of refugee Pathans, whose headman is called Murtaza, Sultanzai. They complained that 14 of their camels were led away by the Governor of Khaf’s men, and that four days before that one of their men was imprisoned by the Governor for no fault. On enquiry I found that the Governor was displeased with them as they had not gone to salaam him. These Afghans emigrated to Persia 16 years ago, and say they are Persian subjects. They -pay ten tomans for each flock of their sheep to the Persian authorities as “ tirini. 5 ' They had not been to salaam as the Governor has been changed three times in 12 months. They were ready to go if the Governor would undertake not to punish them. / HUSSEIN ALI. O. C. B. P., Simla—^o. C-60J F. D.«314^)8.—54.—J.

Copies are being sent to His Britannic Majesty’s Minister at Tehran, and to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General at Meshed. NOTE OF THE KAIN-AFGHAN FRONTIER. ^Frontier Niabats. The Frontier Niabats, commencing from the south, are those of (1) Duroh, (2) Julga {Sunni Khana and Tabas, and (3) Zirkuh. Dtjroh and Lahnu, Dnroh and Lahnu with a large number of Kalatas were included in Julga Sunni Khana in Ahmad Shah’s time. As far as I can gather, the district became subject to the Amirs of Kain some years before the remainder of Sunni Khana. The latter event, which will be noted under its proper head, was finally brought about during the reign of Fateh Ali Shah. The Duroh Naibship has, with frequent lapses, been in the family of the present Naib, Khwaja Jan Muhammad, for many years. This family of Khwajas originally came from Bokhara, their descent being as under:— KHWAJA ASSADULLA (NAIB). Khwaja Muhimmad Raza (Naib). Khwaja Ali Khwaja Ali Ghazi (Naib). Mardau. Khwaja Abdul 6 others. Hussain (Naib). (Dismissed by Shau- kat-ul-Mulk. Died in Seistan where hU sons live now.) Khwaja Abbas. Khwaja Hussein Ali. _ I 4 others. Khwaja Jan Mahammad (present Naib). 5 sons. Khwaja Assadulla. 2 sons. The Naib is given an assignment on the revenues of Duroh for the main' tenance of six sowars and iowv jambazes. There is a Customs and Passport Mirza at Duroh (Sayad Asadulla Khan), who at the present time is under the Mirza at Awaz as regards Customs, and under the Postmaster at Birjand as regards Passports. He has two sowars to assist him. The authorized route for caravans across the Frontier are thus desciibed in a statement recently sent me by the Director-General in Khorasan. “ The route from Kandahar and Farah to Birjand by Damdam (Afghan) Chah-i-Sagak, Chashma-i-Shutaran, Duroh.” In May last, a dispute between the Customs Mirza and the people of Duroh was reported in which blows were exchanged. No Afghans were concerned in the matter, and the affair is without significance. The only Karez or cultivated land in this part of the Fiontiei, which might conceivably be held to come within the disputed area (though theAfghans have so far laid no claim on it), is that at Asperan (As-i-Parian). The ruins at this place testify to its having been at one time a big village, but no one has been able to afford any clue as to when and why it was abandoned. It has almost certainly not been inhabited since Nadir Shah’s time. There is one Karez at present open at Asperan. The cultivator is one Ali, a man of Afghan extraction, who formerly lived in Duroh (not a Saruni). He came to Asperan some seven years ago. The produce of the Karez is about 30 Tabriz Kharwars of grain. Ali has persistently refused to pny revenue to the Naib of Duroh. When M. Miller was Russian Consul in Seistan, he made endeavours to purchase^Asperan (through Passand Khan, Baluch,) from the Naib of Duroh, who claimed it as his property. The Khwaja had at that time been temporarily deprived of the Naibsbip and, owing to that or some other cause, the negotiations came to nothing. Ali always visits the Kussian as well as the British Consulate when he comes to Seistan. There is little doubt that Asperan has always been a part of the Duroh DCtrict. As regards grazing rights, the information given by Captain Keyes in his note of 1st May HOG has been generally corroborated by my informants. Where rights are undefined however, as they are in the present' case, exact agreement in details cannot be expected. According to the Naib of Duroh, the old political frontier was the Harut Rud, but the Afghan maldars had prescriptive grazing rights beyond this to the west. At the present day, the Naib informed me, Afghan maldars graze up to the following points : — Surtigh; Hangar and Haftad Bud (Lahno), Chah Sagak ; Chah Surkh • Khargas Ab. Chah Shur. The whole of this country is also grazed over by the Seistan maldars, so the Afghan flock-owners rights are by no means exclusive. The Naib denied that any grazing tax (Sargalla or Kah charai) is taken by Afghans, though a tax amounting to 1 sheep per flock, and Krans 2 to Krans 4 per flock (rama) is exacted from them on their passage from Seistan through Afghan territory to reach their grazing grounds. According to the same authority, the N'aibs of Duroh in former days levied a grazins: tax on Afghan maldars west of the Ilarut Bud. ,, An ol 1 who I think may be considered unbiassed, told me that the Atash Khana range was the recognised frontier of Duroh. As regards grazing taxe&gt;, he corroborated the Naib’s statement as given above. v • N °£ th 1 the .

Haider Khan- In Nadir Shah’s time, the Khanates of Kam and separate, the former under Mir Ismail Khan , e^ ** , , defeate* Khan. Mir Ismail received a farman to subdu Sunni Khana, band killed in the attempt, and it was not till Nadir Shah himself came to Kain that Baqir Khan tendered hia submission. After this, Baqir Khan served Nadir Shah in India, and is said to have secured some of the Amarkot treasure. For his services he was made Ba^lar Begi of Khurasan and Kerman. The two sons of Mir Ismail Khan of Kain were taken to Meshed by Nadir Shah, Mir Masum being subsequently sent back as Governor of Kain. The other brother, Mir Alum, was one of Nadir Shah’s Generals, and after the latter’s death he made a bid for the Governorship of Khorasan, but was defeated and killed by Ahmad Shah. Kain and Sunni Khana after this became part of the l)urani Empire under their own Governors. After Ahmad Shah’s death, Kain, with Khorasan, is said to have come under Muhammad Hassan Khan, Kajar, but Sunni Khana continued to pay tribute to the Afghans. The allegiance of the two Khanates was still divided in this way after Agha Muhammad Shah had become master of the whole of Persia and had also annexed Khorasan. At this time, the Kain Ruler was Muhammad Amir, while Sunni Khana was under Muhammad Rafi Kban II. The former was succeeded by his brother Mir Asadulla Khan, who gov erned Kain for about 50 years. Somewhere about the year 18-!0, be killed the Khan of Sunni Khana by treachery and obtained possession of Fork, the chief stronghold of this Khanate. Mirza Ismail Khan and Abdulla Khan of Sunni Khana then fled to Herat where they afterwards took part in the fightim* against the Persians in 1837. Sunni Khana did not come permanently under the Ruler of Kain at this time, a peace between the two being concluded by Asadulla Khan marrying the daughter of Mirza Rafi Khan II. The latter was succeeded by his grandson, Muhammad Wali Khan (Mirza Rafi Khan III), who was a child at the time of his grandfather’s murder. Some years afterwards (the exact date I am unable to ascertain) an attempt by Asadulla Khan to obtain payment of tribute from Muhammad Wali Khan resulted in the latter going to Tehran, when he was granted a Khillat by tht Shah and a subsidy of lonians oOO, to be deducted from the revenue which was in futuie to be paid to Pcr&gt;ia. On his return to Sunni Khana, Muhammcd Wali Khan was murdered by Asadulla Khan’s orders, and Mirza Ismail Khan became Chief of the Khanate, but the promise of payment of revenue by the deceased Khan was not made good. * J About tne year 1840, Kain was invaded by the Wali of Khorasan, Asaf-u- Doulah. Mir Asadulla fled to Herat, leaving iiis son Mir fAlarn Khan and his mother. When the Asaf-u-Doulah returned to Meshed, he left his son Muhammad AH Khan as Goveruer of Kain, taking with him Mir 41am Khan whom he imprisoned at xMeshed. Mir Asadulla made several attempts to regain possession of Kain, but without success, and the Khorasan troops were onlv with drawn m order to fight against the Shih’s forces d iring the Asaf-u-Doulah’s rebellion. Asadulla assisted the Shah’s troops, and. on the Asaf-u-Doulah’s rebel lion being crushed, returned to Kain. After this, quarrels again broke out between Mir Asadulla and the Sunni iana Chief, the principal cause of friction being the Turkoman raids which the Uter was alleged to assist. ^ With the help of the Afghans, Mir Ismail Khan made several raids on Kain territory# ncr ft i*T^ 1 kt S A d f lll i! a finaU u * 1 ° Tehran to ask for the Shah’s assistance against the Afghans, and about the year 1845 returned, bringing with him a f ree from lehran. An appeal to the Afghans to help Sunni Khaua had no result and the Julga finally came under Persian rule. The Perso-Afghan War of 1«56 had but little bearing on the present issue ^.r though after the capture of Herat Lash was brought under the Amir of Kaio, the status quo ante was restored by the Treaty of Paris. In the present day, the Niabat of Julga Sunni Khana extends from Hussainaoad, north of Duroh, to Gazik. «xienas irom Kli*irf he ' 18 MuIiammad Ibrallil n Khan of Darmian, son of Mir Ismail The revenue is Tomans 4,932.The Naib has assignment on the revenue of the Julga for the upkeep of 96 sowars for frontier defence (including 25 of Dastgird). These are distributed as under :— Kundal dltto d Abdul Karim Beg ditto 1 Mehrdil and Sultan (Afghans) ditto &amp; Araba^ of Faizabad ........ 4 Acrha Hussein (Kala Nau) Agha Jan Beg ditto .......

Yusuf Khan’s father, Zainulabidin, was rhief of Samur (Afghanistan) when the Herat district was taken by the Persians in 1856. Being a Shia he was then made Governor of Lash by the Ihsam- ul-Sultaneh, but on the country being restored to the Afghans, as he would have found residence in Afghanistan intolerable, he was given an asylum in Persian territory and the Niabat of Dastgird. the Naib and his son, Nazar Ali Khan, take an annual tour along the whole frontier with their sowars, hut there are no outposts of any sort, or any watch kept to prevent aggressions. Muhammad Yusuf Khan takes toll from maldars on the “ Tag u when he can, and is more than suspected of being himself a regular receiver of camels stolen from across the frontier. Zal Beg of Tahbas, referred to in Captain Keyes’ note, has now no official position as Sarhaddar, but he receives pay for maintaining a few sowars and is used chiefly to trace trans-frontier cattle thieves. There is a customs post at Awaz in charge of a Mirza, who has also the Passport office. The Mirza told me he was in charge of all customs posts on the Kain frontier and worked directly under Meshed, not under the Birjand office as heretofore. He has under him two sowars and two footmen. _ The two sowars at Yazdan are also under him, the post at Charakhs having been The routes authorised for traders are Prom Sabzawar by Yazdan and Patargan. ,, Ghurian by Kobat-i-Chah and Kalaryan. „ Herat by Yazdan, Shorab, and Gulwarda.

But this is not the frontier as generally accepted.

ISfiabat of Zirkuh.—^hv frontier huluk of Zirkuh extends from near Gul- warda and north of the village of Bani to the Kain-Khaf border at Kul Birinj. It is probable that this district has been an integral part of Kain since before Nadir Shah’s time. I have seen a revenue document which seems to show that the frontier village of Yazdan was under the “ Wazir of Kain ” in 1686, when Herat and Kandahar were also subject to the Saffavis. At the present time the Naib of Zirkuh is Haji Abdul Ali Khan, who is responsible for a revenue of tomans 2,428. Sowars are maintained for the protection of the frontier to the number of 76 distributed as under :— Shahrakt under Sheikh Mahmood, Naib Bamrud under the Mirzas of Bamrud Daraij under Jabbar Khan • . . . , Garin Ab-i*Taj Khan under Muhammad Jaffir and Ismail Khan, Timuri Majnabad under Mir Kalandar . . i .

Yazdan was formerly a much bigger place than it is now. It is said that including those of Atashan, Zainueabidin and Kabuda, which were considered part of Yazdan, there were in all 72 Karazes. he Karez at Yazdan, which is now worked, is the private property of the Hashmat-ul-Mulk and his sister, known as the Nawab. There are 10 families of cultivators and the produce is about 40 Khanoars of grain. There must be numerous documents in the possession of the Durukhsh Khans, the Khans of Sunni Khana and others from which the history of Yazdan could be gleaned. The document that I have already mentioned as affording evidence that Yazdan was a part of Kain in Saffavian times was shown me by Abdul Jawad Khan of Durukhsh. It consists of a farman issued to the Baglarbegi of Khorasan to recover arrears of revenue due from Saiyid Ali Beg of Yazdan and pay the same to the Wazir of Kain. The document seems to indicate that for revenue and administrative purposes Yazdan was under Kain and Khorasan, not under the Herat Governorship. This Saiyid Mi Beg, Yazdani, was according to local report at that time Hakim of Zirkuh. The private ownership of the Yazdan property by the ruling family of Kain is explained by the Durukhsh Khans as follows :— The sole heiress (grandchild ?) of the Saiyid Ali Beg above referred to was married to Saiyid Khan, son of Sadiq Beg of Durukhsh, who thus became owner of the property. Durukhsh, it seems, was part of the Sunni Khana Julga till Mir Asadulla’s time, when it became part of Kain, and was made into a separate ISiabat. Note The family of the Dumkhsh Khans came from Egypt in Shah Abas’s time. SHAH NIAMUTTJLLA. Mir Mohtashim. Mirza Mohta* shim. Muhammad Sadiq Beg. Sairid Ali Mirza Muhammad Khan. Wazir. Wazir.

At the present time, the Karez at Atashan is not worked. The Shaukat- ul-Mulk sent men to open it in the spring of this year (1907), but they were prohibited from working by the Afghans. In a telegram sent by the Shaukat- ul-Mulk to the Foreign Minister in August 1907 on the subject of the capture of the refugees at Maliki (referred to above), he states that he had previously represented the action taken by the Afghans in this matter both to Tehran and to the Asaf-u-Douleh (then Governor-General of Khorasan) but had been told not to raise the question. There is a post of 10 Afghan Khassadars at Atashan. The Karez at Zainulabidin was one of the 72 Karezes of Yazdan. I was told that it was redug by one Zainulabidin of Sharakht (Sharaks) about 15 years ago and named after him. It is not worked now. Kabuda is a spring of alkaline water near Yazdan. The land around it is cultivated by Yazdan people for the Hashmat-ul-Mulk whose private property it is. As regards grazing rights, the Dasht-i-Naomed is open to all, and as stated above, I am inclined to think that the presence or not of Afghan maldars affords no indication at all as to ownership.

Note. —The daik, marked in Captain Keyes'map rfa££-i-Patargun, was pointed out to me as being 3 dakfo : Patargun lying to the north, Mahzangi to the south of it and Khushaba to the south of Mahzangi. The existence of the Afghan refugees on or near the disputed tract has been brought into prominence by an incident that recently occurred near Maliki and which may lead to the raising of the wider question of the frontier. Two Seistani sowars that had accompanied the family of the Karguzar (Ikram- ul-Mulk) to Meshed were returning, and having business witli Sher Muhammad, an Afghan refugee, who had been at Mabki for some years past went out of their Way to Stop the night at his camp. The next day one of the Seistani sowars, Kohandil Khan, was murdered on the road to Ahwaz. The survivor Asghar states that an Afghan risala sowar arrived the previous evening at the Rhel and he and the son of Sber Muhammad followed them and trea^ cherously attacked them, killing Kohandil. Asghar fled, and while the Afghans were stripping Kohandil s body the risala sowar’s horse came after him and he went off with it. Sher Muhammad and his people immediately decamped to Afghanistan. The Karguzar is taking up the case very strongly and has seat reports to the Persian Government on the subject blaming the Shaukat-ul-Mulk Though the murder was probably the result of a private quarrel and took place in Persian territory, it may lead to the boundary question being raised. Even if the Persian Government are too much occupied to do so, the Afghan authorities Jmay, for it is probable that the incident has been presented to them m a different light. Many of the Afghan maldars in Persian territory return to Afghanistan in the autumn. They pay sargalla to Afghan authorities only.Although the boundary is undefined, there seems to be a general consensus of opinion among Behluli and Afghan maldars as to where it lies. The line generally accepted according to my information is indicated by the relative position with regard to it given to the following fixed points:— Gulwarda Kuh-i-Hassan Kbani Kuh-i-Khargu Gulkhand (Gul Khan?) Shorao . • Kob-i-Duzd • Koh-i-Kabuda • • In Persian territory. On the boundary. Persian territory. Afghan territory. 2 farsakhs in Persian territory. Persian territory. 1 farsakh in Persian territory. Note.— Shorao was reported by Afghan n^aldan to Captain Keyes to be in Persian territory —vide his note. Kul Birin j . Namaksar . On the Frontier line. (A spring only. No cultivation.) Half Afghan, half Persian. Some Gazik people, who went to collect salt from the Namaksar last June, were made to pay a tax by “ Afghans. ” I am told that the tax is not authorised by Afghan authorities and it must have therefore been blackmail extorted by some of the numerous bad characters who have settled about the disputed area. I have no information at first hand beyond and north of the Namaksar. General conclusions. Taking the Kain Frontier as a whole, I cannot agree that the line of actual Afghan possession at the present time should be drawn any further west than the line of Chaunis, for, as above mentioned, grazing rights or grazing encroachments do not imply ownership. The list of Afghan Qhaunis on the Kain frontier as given to me is as follows :— Chah Mishan, Atashan, Chah Lada, Chah Eeg, Chah Puza, Cbahi Yak {Anardarra route), Padai, Tundi, Koh-i-Guch. From present information I would trace the boundary as follows From the termination of the McMahon boundary to the Atasb Khana range, thence to Dam dam and Dak-i-Tundi. From the Dak-i-Tundi it should follow the Shela “ Mian«i-Tag.” Thence to Kuh-i-Hassan Khani. From this point it should lie between the line of Ghaunis and the Koh-i-Duzd and Koh-i Kabuda. Thence to the east of Yazdan leaving the Karazes at Yazdan and Atashan to the Persians. From this point to the Namaksar, half of which is Persian and half Afghan. This line is identical with the Frontier as sketched in Captain Watson’s letter No. 17, dated, 30th August 1906. It generally accords with Captain Keyes’ line of actual Afghan occupation as shown on his map as far north as the Shela “ Mian-i-Tag.” North of this point the boundary should in my opinion lie to the east of Shorao. As previously explained, there seems to he no reason for drawing the line of actual possession to include Afghan grazing rights or encroachments on ^ the Tag. If any such conclusion were correct, the re-entrant at Shorao might he made to describe a still more pronounced curve at this point as there have been Afghan Kheis as far west as Maliki for some time. It would seem advisable to attach a Surveyor to this Consulate to complete and correct the map of the Frontier. As explained by Captain Keyes, there are some important, but under the circumstances unavoidable, omissions in his map which it would be an advantage to have filled in, and there are a few inaccuracies due no doubt to the great extent of country and the short time at the disposal of Captain Keyes and his Surveyor. Khan Bahadur Sher Jung (Survey of India), who arrived in Seistan with Captain Gibbon a few days ago, is travelling to Birjand by Asperan, Duroh and Gazik, and will do as much as he can in this way in the tew days he has to spare.10 Documents, $he following is ft' list of certain documents which on examination may prove to be of some value as evidence (1) The Mirzas of Bamrud (Zirkuh) are the descendants of one Sheikh Ahmad Jan Khwaja. In Nadir Shah’s time bis ancestors were employed in positions of trust. One of them named Mirza Muhammad Ali is said to have been Mastaufi of Khorasan in the time of AdilShah, son of Nadir Shah. The family are believed to be in the possession of (2) Aga Muhammad Afghar (of Kalla Kah) was settled at Durukhsh in Ahmad Shah’s time. He went to Kabul and obtained from Ahmad Shah four farmans which were bestowed on the Durukhsh family as under :— Mirza SaiyidTbrahim Khan ..... Wakil-ul-Raia. Mirza Muhammad Amin . . . . . Wazir. Haji Kuehah Mirza ...... Sadar. These farmans are said to be now in Durukhsh. The statement as given would seem to constitute an anachronism. The documents are said to have been endorsed by Pateh Ali Shah. (3) / The Naib of Duroh is said to be in possession of farmans from the Wali of Khorasan.

That the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, when he was touring the fron tier in December, despatched from Gazik to the disputed villages of Chah Leila and Atashan a party aagwat* consisting of Mahommed Ibrahim Khan, Haib of Tabas Sunni Khane Mahommed Yusuf, Sinuri, Haib of Bastgird and 40 sowars, 3. At Ghah Leila the Afghans, who have occupied, that place ; shut the fort doors and did not permit the Shaukat’s men to enter, so they with - :drew to a short distance* After MahoiiiBiad Yusuf had made an unsuccessful attempt to enter armed, Mahommed Ibrahim Khan entered the place unarmed. He was allowed to examine it and found four Afghan soldiers there, the regular garrison is five and a Vakil or Sergeant* 4. They lunched outside the fort and marched on to Atashan, which is about 12 miles off* Here they were admitted and found 5 men and a Vakil* They asked the Afghans why they had come and occupied Persian villages. The latter replied that both places lay on the disputed portion of the frontier and that the Amir had ordered them to go and live there* Having slept the night at Atashan, the party returned the next day to Gazik*5# The Shaukat-ttl-Mulk has now ordered that both these places be cultivated by his men in the late Spring when the karezes will be cleaned out and mended and probably rival villages built.

The following are the chief corrections made m the map :— January year has been taken up the centre of the Namaksar, instead of round the eastern shore, to the point where it left it in my original map, viz., the nullah running into the Namaksar to the west of Chah Katuri. (c) From the north shore of the Namaksar I have shown the line of Afghan possession as following this nullah up to the Simtik-i- Zangillao range. It was shown thus in my original map, but, as the paint of the line rendered the nullah indistinct, the latter was omitted in the reproduction by the Intelligence Branch. This is in accordance with the Persian claim and corresponds with the information collected by me on the frontier. (d) From the source of the above-mentioned nullah, in the Simtik-i- Zangillao range, I have shown the line running to about two miles west of Musabad. (e) North of Musabad I have shown no line of Afghan possession, as, on my last tour on the frontier, I learnt that the Afghan nomads had withdrawn from Palangao on the arrival of Tehran Cossacks at Karat.

Ketes, His Britannic Majesty’s Consul, Turhat-i-Haidari. I am directed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter No. 21-P., dated the 5th May 1906, submitting a note on the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan frontier. 2. The care with which the note and map illustrating it have been pre pared is, I am to say, appreciated by the Government of India. I am, however, to convey the following remarks concerning the boundary shown on the map : (i) According to General Maclean’s report on the demarcation, copies of which and of the accompanying map are forwarded for information, the fron tier is not sliown as having been demarcated as far as Robat-i-Turk but up to pillar 39. The map accompanying your report should therefore be altered accordingly. (ii) It is not understood why the boundary in the region of the Nimaksar is described by a curved line, as it is well known that the Afghans collect salt from this lake and hold possession right up to the eastern shore of it. Unless, therefore, you possess information to justify the curved line above the Nimak sar would it not be better to indicate the probable boundary towards pillar No. 39, or Palang Ao as the case may be, by a straight line through the Nimaksar and thence up the Sargardan stream leading past Musabad, which was it is un derstood claimed as the boundary by the Afghans and is in their possession. The Kashif-ul-mulk, a Persian Surveyor who reported on the boundary in 1904, admitted Afghan possession to the Nimaksar hut claimed the Siintik*i- Zangillao range as the boundary. 3. The map is accordingly returned for such modification as may he T noQ , M ag mi necessary in tbe light of tbe foregoing secret f., January 1905 , Nos. 190 - 256 . remarks. A copy ot the proceedings Secret f., June 1905 , Nos. 2 U- 22 . noted in the margin is also forwarded for your perusal and return when no longer required.

Monday, 11th June .—Two days ago the Asaf-ud-Dowlah sent me a tele gram which he had received from the Shaukat-ul-Mulk at Birjand. It referred to a frontier incident which had occurred between some of his subjects who were digging a karez or underground canal in the Atishkhana district, near the frontier^ and some 20 Afghans under an Afghan officer, who had forbidden them to go on with the work, pending a reference to their respective Governors, on the ground that the karez was in Afghan territory. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk, in his telegram, mentioned that he had heard that Captain Keyes, when passing through, had carefully inspected this karez, but he did not know why. The Asaf-ud-Dowlah asked my advice as to what he should do. To-day he has returned from a week-end trip to the hills, and I have told him that I believe it is true that Captain Keyes saw some men at work on a karez in the district mentioned, and that the men themselves told him that they Tvould like to know whether they were working in Afghan or Persian soil, and that pending a settlement of the question they were not inclined to pay taxes. I added that the telegram had not exactly stated the situation of the karez, but that it was evidently disputed territory, and that therefore it was impossible for me to advise him. He appeared dissatisfied with the reply. From—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, To—E. M.

I have the honour to inform you that I am sending by this week s post to the Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department a plane table sketch of the country between A^peran and Ru-i-Khaf by the late Duffadar Rah mat Ali. 2. When I submitted my Note on the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan frontier (forwarded to you under cover of my No. 22-P., of May 6th) I had not seen the file on the subject in your office, and was unaware that it had ever been reported that there was au Afghan post at Chah Katuri, on the northern shore of the large Namaksar. Chah Katuri was fixed from a distance by Duffadar Rahmat Ali, and his guide informed him that there was a (i chauni ’ there, hut, as on being cross-questioned Rahmat Ali appeared doubtful as to there being any build ing there, I entered Chah Katuri on my map as a well. ^ There was a nomad encampment near the well and I was unable to gain any information ithout exciting too much suspicion. I have now entered it in the plane table sketch as a post, but marked it with a (?). 3. I was also unaware until reading the file in Meshed that the .Afghans had ever claimed access to the Namaksar ; the last paragraph of section 7 of my Note should therefore be corrected accordingly. 4. Captain Watson has just written that the Shaukat-ul-Mulk, Governor of Kain, wishes to know whether I considered Atashkhan (locally pronounced Atashkhun) to he in Persian or Afghan territory. The Asaf-ud Dowlah also approached Captain Battye on the subject a short time ago, vide Meshed diary for June 11th, but there was some confusion as to whether he meant Atash khun or Atashkhana, to the south-east of Chah Sagak. The place in dispute is to the north-east of Yazdan. I informed the Asaf-ud-Dowlah verbally and the Shaukat-ul-Mulk by letter that I had not visited the spot and had no information beyond that given me by Zal Beg Khan, Sarhaddar at Yazdan, that there was a dispute over the ownership of this karez. 6 .

Please see your telegram No. 110 of August 28th regarding Atashan Karez. Captain Watson reports that about four months ago Skaukat-ul-Mulk sent men to repair Atashan Karez. Shortly afterwards a party of Afghans appeared with a message from the Governor of Gharian that the work must be stopped as the place was claimed by Afghans. An official was also sent by the Governor of Gharian to discuss the matter with Shaukat and it was decided to stop the work and refer to Kabul and Tehran. It is now reported that the Afghans have taken possession and are building houses but this requires confirmation. It is impossible to give an opinion on the validity of the respective claims without examining the question on the spot as Atashan is situated on un demarcated frontier.^ It has apparently been deserted for many years, but is claimed by the Persians together with Yazdan where they possess cultivation. In default of undertaking demarcation only remedy would appear to lie in inducing both sides to maintain status quo as was done in case of Musabad. If Afghans have not actually taken possession this should not be difficult. In order to decide this point would it be possible for Captain Watson to visit the place when on tour ?— Ends.

Daukes, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Acting Consul for Seistan and Kain. With reference to Captain Keyes’ letter re Atashan, and your telegrams Nos. 387 C. and 390 C., I have the honour to forward the following details, which may prove of interest:— (a) that the property of Yazdan, Kabuda and Atashan originally be longed to the Khans of Durukhsh. About 70 years ago Sardar Maded Khan, Afghan, invaded Kain and fought with the Durukhsh Khans, after a month peace was made and Sardar Madad Khan married a daughter of the Durukhsh Khan and returned to Afghanistan, Two years later he died and the Khan of Durukhsh went to Afghanistan and brought his daughter back, and then went to Kabul and married an Afghan lady whom he brought with him to Durukhsh. (b) Some fifty years ago the Afghans again invaded Kain and were W defeated by M ir Alum Khan, father of this Sbaukhat-ul-Mulk, He saw that it would be an advantage to have villages on the frontier, and asked the Khans of Durukhsh to sell him the Yazdan property ; they gave it to him under certain conditions, and pos sess the “ san ad ” referring to the transfer. Mir Alum Khan then started with Yazdan, Zain-ul-abidin and Kabuda, the karezes of which he repaired and these places are cultivated now by Persians. Atasban he intended to repair, but died before he could carry out his intention. The late Shaukat-ul-Mulk never cared about it and the matter was forgotten until six months ago when the present Shaukat sent Mahommed Yusuf Khan Timuri, Naib of Dastgird, to tour along the frontier and submit a report: he reported Atashan to be deserted and, in his opinion, Persain territory. (c) Some four months ago the Shaukat-ul-Mulk sent a party to re pair the Atashan karez and cultivate the lands. When they had been working some twenty days, a party of Afghan sowars arriv ed with a message from the Governor of Ghurian telling them to stop work, as the place was claimed by the Afghans; at the same time a ' Mamur ” came to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk from Afghanistan with reference to this case and it was decided to refer the matter to Kabul and Teheran. The Shaukat-ul-Mulk recalled his working party. The Afghans, however, are report ed to have taken possession of the place, cleared the karezes and built houses there.M (d) Atashan is apprently an old village with a long karez ; this village and karez were destroyed some 160-150 years ago by the Turco mans, and have not since been repaired. (e) It is possible that the Afghans may claim the district of Yazdan, Kabuda and Atashan as having been given either with the wife of Sardar Mudad Khan or to the parents of the Kabuli lady, who was married to the khan of Durukhsh, aicte paragraph (a). I can find no other claim which they can put forward. (/) The frontier as claimed by the Persians apparently runs as fol lows :— It follows a stream or “ shelah ” which traverses the Tag-i-Nammad from north to south, thence to Yazdan, including Gulwarda* Shorao, Kabuda and Koh-i-Kabuda. Thence to the Namaksar, the East Bank of which is Afghan and the West Persian property. The villages or wells of Atashan and Zain-ul-abidin are also claimed by the Persians. They are near Yazdan and probably marked in Captain Keyes* map. It will be seen that this corresponds very nearly with Captain Keyes* line except as regards Shorao and Koh-i-Kabuda, which I believe he has placed on the Afghan side of the frontier. . Should Government desire me to go to Durukhsh and Yazdan, I could ascertain more about this question. Under i Secretai Oommitt Under Si SecretaryCopy IbS t&gt;4&lt;- /M') Confidential , No. 181.

The care with which the note and map illustrating it have been prepared is, I am te say, appreciated by the Govern ment of India. I am, however, to cenvey the f©Hewing remarks concerning the boundary shown ©n the map.:- (i) According t© General Maclean*s report on the demarcation, copies of which and ©f the accompanying may are forwarded for information, the frontier is net shown as having been demarcated as far as Rebat-i-Turk but up t© pillar 39. TheT^ie map accempanying y®ur report should therefore 'be altered aecordiagly. (ii) It is not understood why the boundary in the region of the llimaks&amp;r is described by a curved line, as it is well known that the Afghans collect salt from this lake and held possession right up to the eastern shore of it. Unless, therefore, you possess infermation t© justi fy the curved line abev© the Mmaksar, would it not be better te indicate the probable boundary towards pillar Be.39 or Pulang Ae as the case ray be by a straight line through the Bimaksar and thence up the S&amp;rg&amp;rdan stream leading past Busab&amp;d which was it is understood claimed as the boundary by the Afghans and is in their possession. The Kashif-ul-L:ulk, a Persian surveyor, who reported on the boundary in 1904 admitted Afghan possession te the limaksar, but claimed the Simtik-i-Zangilla© range as the boundary. 3. The map is accordingly returned for such modification as may be necessary in the light of the foregoing remarks. 4. It is important that the line showing the limits of actual eccupatien should be as accurate as possible and the papers new forwarded may, it is hoped, assist you inFrom—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department, Simla, To— Captain A.

They told me they had refused to pay revenue to the Shaukat-ul-Mulk until the question had been settled. • Between the Bandan valley and the Tag-i*Atashkhana there are several encampments of Bahluris and Duroh maldars, but, as they never graze on the Tag, they do not affect the question.

Neither the Customs sowars nor the inhabitants of Duroh, with the exception of a few families who have relations in Kila Kah, go beyond Chah Sagak. The Seistani-Baluch maldars, who emigrate in the late winter or early spring, claim much more than the inhabitants of the Kainat. They graze their way round the Hamun across the Farrah and Harut Buds, where they pay a toll of one sheep per encampment and 2 krans per black tent to a representative of the Hakim of Lash. They claim that the Harut Bud is the “ Sim-i-Maldar ” or “ flock-owners’ line,” and have the greatest contempt for the“Kajars,” while they are on very good terms with the Afghans. This spring there was one encampment of Seistani-Baluch on the west skirt of the Atashkhana range and one at Damdam, while there were two encampments of Afghans at the latter place. As far as I could ascertain there were no other khels of Afghans to the west of the Harut Bud. I was told in Duroh that Damdam -was the frontier, although the villagers did not go further than Chah Sagak. Damdam may, therefore, be taken as on the actual line observed. It does not follow from the Seistani-Baluch considering all the plain as far east as the Harut Bud as their grazing ground, that the whole of it should be included in Persian territory. On the contrary, the fact that they pay toll to the Afghans at the Harut Bud would lead to the conclusion that the eastern por tion should be considered as Afghan. The crest of the Atashkhana range forms a conspicuous natural boundary which would probably not be objected to by the Seistani-Baluch maldars if their privilege of emigrating round the Hamun through Afghan territory were secured to them as a right: it would also be more than the authorities of the Kainat would expect. The Afghans, too, would not be likely to object to it, as thev have never grazed to the west of the range, nor taken toll anywhere but on the ilarut Bud. If this were decided on, the line could be continued south to Koh-i-Chah Shur, and thence along the eastern skirt of the hills to Nar Ahu. In the accompanying map I have shown the line of actual possession about a farsakh to the east of Koh-i-Atashkhana, as this may be taken as the grazing radius of the Seistani-Baluch khel now encamped to'the east of the range. 4. A change for the better, from the Persian point of view, has taken place Second section of the frontier, f the Tag-i-Nammadi this year. The +* p Art, p Shaukat-ul-Mulk, alarmed at the construe- tion of Afgbaii posts along the frontier, has placed a small number of Bahluris under the command of Nazar Ah Khan, son of the Naib of Dastgird, on the Taa- i-Nammadi. In consequence the maldars of Lahnu and the Bahluris, who till this year had never ventured more than a farsaU away from the Kain hills, now graze as far as a ‘Shelah situated at about 16 miles from the hills. , Th « Seistani-Baluch formerly used to graze unmolested as far from the foot- 1s as they Wished, but, this year, owing to the plague in Seistan, none of tinir encampments has been allowed on the Tag. &gt; c This plain is shown on the Indian surveys as the Dasht-i-Naumed, which name was, I believe, first given m the reports of the Goldsmid Mission/and is even shown on some maps as the ‘ ‘ Desert of Despair. ’ ’ In reality there is excellent L a l° ng V' 11 1, Wat &lt;™g-Places at close intervals in the foot hills. It is known to all the different tribes of maldars and the people of Lahnu3 srtid 1)131011 as tlie Tag-i-Nammadi, from tlie resemblance in the winter of the small hushes with which it is covered to a felt carpet. This spring, owing to unusual rain, there were streams in all the nullahs, and the ground was covered with grass and flowers. It is said to be hotter in the summer than Seistan even, and, as early as April, heat haxes make survey work almost impossible. I was unfortunately, owing to lack of forage, unable to spare the time to fix the “ Shelah which is said to be observed as the frontier. This Shelah ” would seem to be eminently suitable for the frontier line, as it is about equi-distant from the maldars' watering-places on either side, and, unlike the streams in the Seistan delta, does not change its course. The “ Shelah ” runs into a small lake called the Dakk-i-Tundi. The parting between the Dakk-i-Tundi and the group of Dakks near Yazdan is situated just to the north of Gulwarda. 5. The third section, from Gulwarda to Yazdan, is about 36 miles. Abbas Third section of frontier. Khan Khan of Awaz, states that Gulwarda IS on the actual frontier, and the men of an Afghan khel, encamped about 8 miles north-east of Gulwarda, whose sheep were grazing to the west of the Gulwarda-Yazdan track, told me the same. These men had frightened away some Persian maldars who were encamped just to the cast of Gulwarda, At Shorao, the camping-place between Gulwatda and Yazdan, there were two khels of hiurzai Afghans, who naively told me the well was on Persian soil, but in Afghan possession. At Yazdan the fort and cultivation were in the possession of the Persians, but Afghans were encamped all round it. , The Sarhaddar, Zal, who, I believe, is the same as Zal Beg lihan, who was implicated in the murder of the Customs Mirza at Awaz, is a Yurzai. Afghan and lives with his sowars in the tents of his khel—who make no pretence of beino- Persian subjects—within a few yards of the Persian fort. 6 . From Yazdan to the western salient of General Maclean’s line near Fourth section &lt;of the frontier. PalaUg Ao» I considered it inadvisable to march to the east of the Namaksar, as the country was obviously in the possession of the Afghans. On my way to Galahaoz from Yazdan I saw the remains of the Afghan maldars winter sheep folds on the slopes of the Hamah Koh, while my surveyor was captured by some Afghans 'whose khel was within a few miles of the Namaksar. These men, whose sheep were grazing almost up to the Namaksar, told him that the lake was the acutal frontier: I was told the same by a Persian Sultan, the chief man of Niazabad. From Yazdan I sent a secret agent to try and get to Musabad via Kul Birin He reports that he was twice captured and beaten by Afghans, whom he found in possession of Musabad and Ayubi. He was also told that there was an Afghan khel at Palang Ao : this is confirmed from other sources. Zal, the Sarha ddar at Yazdan, told me that Kul Birinj was the end of his beat and belonged to Kain. I was informed that he never patrolled to the north of Yazdan, but even if his men did go as far as Kul Birinj it would not prove effec tive Persian occupation, as, though drawing Persian pay, they are Afghans living in an Afghan khel. Both Persians and Afghans at Yazdan give the same account of the situation, i.e., that Mir Alam Khan, the late Hashmat-ul-Mulk. obtained Yazdan from the Afghans by bribery 55 years ago. He opened 70 karezes —hence the name bv which it is usually known Haftad Karez—and placed a frontier garrison here. On his death the Shaukat-ul-Mulk neglected the post, the karezes fell in and the Afghans returned : they now let the Persian cultivate the land, but graze all round the fort and away to the west as far as the Hamah Koh ancf the Namaksar.i 4 I He ' 7. The task of finding a frontier line acceptable to both parties would be much more difficult on the third and fourth Claims on the third and fourth sections. sections than on the first and second. While the Kain authorities would probably only desire a line running from R ob at -i - Turk th e end of General Maclean's line—slightly to the east of Kul Birinj, Yazdan, Shorao, and Gulwarda to the “Shelah ” on the Tag-i-Nammadi,, the central Government would be more lihey to rely on the line shown cn the Indian surveys or on the line on the Persian map in the Karguzari at Meshed. On the latter map the line runs straight from Robat-i-Turk to Siah Koh. The Afghans have erected small posts, locally called “ chaunis,” at Chah Leilah and Atashkhun, the position of which is shown on the accompanying map, and are also reported to have built posts at Robat-i-Shah Baluch and Musabad, wlich are shown on the old maps. They would certainly claim a grazing radius of at least a farsalch to the west of these posts, 8 . Besides the above-mentioned posts, which are all on the third and fourth sections, the Afghans have also erected Afghan posts. posts at Naibasta, Sheb-i-Yak, Sehehahi, Imamzaid, Dahana-i-Doab and Godar-i-Gabrak in the second and third sections. The only posts in these sections of which the exact position is known are the first two, but all of them are well behind any line that is likely to be claimed by the Persians. 9 , The state of the third and fourth sections is extremely unsatisfactory, chiefly owing to the resentment shown by State of third and fourth sections. ^ a g a inst the Customs employes, and the habit of the local authorities anti the Customs Department of employing renegade Afghans and leaving them without supervision. The two principal cases which have occurred lately and which drew from the Director-General of Customs in Khorasan, his letter No. 5246 of the 8th March to His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General, forwarded by the latter to the Secre tary to the Government of India in the Foregin Department under cover of his No. 51 of the 16th March 1906, are instances in point. In an interview on April 27th, M. Molitor withdrew his contentions that the Afghans are entirely to blame for these murders, and admitted that, not only were vendettas common on this frontier, but were inevitable as long as renegade Afghans were placed in positions of responsibility with armed men under them. He^ also admitted that the lack of supervision of Customs posts had resulted in very serious exactions. M. Molitor’s change of position was chiefly due to a report which he had just received from M. Caesari, parts of which he read to me. M. Caesari’s accounts of the Awaz murder was as follows :— Saiyid Kashamsham Khan, a Kandahari refugee, the Customs Mirza’ for Bamrud and Awaz, had for some time been carrying on a feud with Ataullah Khan, Hakim of Anardarrah, and had succeeded, under cover of Customs woik, in accounting for seven of his men—two of them slain with his own hand. Ataullah Khan, finding himself unable to get the better of his enemy, offered Ghulam Rasul, Passport Officer of Kain, another Afghan refugee, 300 tomans to do the job for him. Ghulam Rasul had a small house specially constructed near Awaz for the purpose, and invited Saiyid Kashamsham Khan to stay with him there. He came accompanied by Mosbim Khan, another Customs employe from Birjand. The second night Ghulam Rasul’s hired assassins, led by Zal Beg Khan, Sarliaddar of Kain, broke in and shot the Saiyid dead. His companion recognized Zal who thereupon hacked him to pieces to destroy evidence. Another Mirza was sent to Awaz, but Ghulam Rasul frightened him away with stories of Afghan villanies, and then, with his three brothers, instituted a private Customs passport and quarantine service from Awaz to Raza. To impress the Afglans more Ghulam Rasul gave out that he was a servant of the British. This adventure brought the enterprising family an income cf seme 200 tomans monthly.As regards the second and more recent murder at Yazdan, M. Caesari advised M. Molitor to drop the case, as I could not have failed to secure evidence of exactions and absence of control very damaging to the Customs Department. M. Molitor was the more willing to do this as the murderers claim that they were on Afghan territoiy when they killed the Mirza, though they were within 20 yards of the fort; and he did not wish to raise a frontier question. 10 . M. Molitor was very outspoken about the manner in which M. Castaigne „ , , , had neslected this frontier, ard had caused Customs reforms. ,, w £ ^. the name ot the Customs Department to be dragged in the dirt by collecting such a set of scoundrels in his frontier posts. He read me portions of the draft of a report he was sending to his Ministry on the question. The essence of the report is as follows :— Turbat-i-Haidari and Yazdan are to be abolished as Customs posts. New Mirzas, Persian subjects, are to be sent to Karat, Sharakhs, and Awaz, these men will be inspected frequently by M. Caesari, and M. Molitor himself will make a tour of inspection in order to become acquainted with the countiy. A clear description of all Customs’ regulaticns, tariffs, admissible routes, etc., will be published on the frontier and sent to the local authorities and His Britannic Majesty’s Consul-General for communication to the Afghan authorities. M. Molitor is now of opinion that no incidents are wanted on this frontier, * and that the best way to avoid them is to put his house in order. Although he realizes that M. Caesari is in most things absolutely without scruple, he believes that he is loyal to him personally, and that he will do his utmost to help in keep ing the frontier quiet. Much of M. Caesari’s information is being suppressed as it would lead to awkward enquiries from Tehran. 11 . As the peace of the frontier in the immediate future depends so much on M. Caesari, a short account, which M. Caesan’s career. yj Molitor gave me of his career, may be of interest. After having been expelled from a Polytechnic Institute in Paris for insubordination he went to Russia, where he became a translator in the Second Section (Secret Police) of the Ministry of the Interior. Fearing that the authorities had discovered that he had been giving information to revolutionary societies, he fled to Persia and became a gun runner on the Turkestan frontier. On the arrival of M. Castaigne, Director-General of Customs, in Khorasan, he applied for a post in the Customs Department. M. Castaigne at first refused, but, on M. Caesari’s threatening to make things unpleasant on the Turkestan frontier, he gave him a post on 40 tomans a month. His adventures in Seistan and Persian Baluchistan, where he crossed into British territory and fired at one of our levies, are well known. On returning to Meshed he quarrelled with M. Castaigne over the disposal of some tiles he had looted from a madrasseh, and was dismissed on account of misappropriation of money when at Kuchan. He then went to Tehran, where he first convinced M. Naus that the charges against him were not proved, as the evidence was all given by Armenians from whom he had won large sums by gambling. When he had established his innocence he admitted that he had embezzled a large amount, as he thought the Customs Department would last no longer than the Tobacco Regie, but offered to repay it if he were again taken into the depart ment, which he promised to serve loyally now that he saw there was a head at the head of affairs ” and it was likely to last. M. Naus was so pleased at the compliment that he re-instated him and sent him to Kermanshah to serve under M. Auguste Molitor, now irec or enera in Meshed. 12 . If the Customs’ reforms above indicated are really earned out, and I think M. Molitor is in earnest, the chances of General considerations. a disturbance on this frontier will be greatly diminished, but there is no doubt that things might become serious any day. 5•if r It is extremely improbable that either the Governors of Khaf or Kain or the Russians will bring the state of affairs to the notice of the Persian Government unless the encroachments of the Afghans become much more serious than unorganised maldars are likely to attempt It must, however, be taken into consideration that to put off the question indefinitely is to give the Afghans occupancy rights which they would not easily render or the Persians admit. In all probability the authorities at Herat, though aware of the exact position of their posts, are ignorant of the extent to which their maldars have trespassed near Yazdan, and a warning given at the same time as an explanation of the position and rights of the Customs Department might have a good effect in restraining them. The occupation of Musabad and other points to the west of the demarcated frontier comes under a different head. 13. The success of Ghulam Rasul’s operations, and the idea prevalent on the frontier that the “Russ, ” as the Belgians Information on the frontier. are ca p ec ^ are our enemies, show that dissemination of information of the fight sort is almost as important as its collection. I would suggest Gazik as the most convenient place for an agent who could combine trading with the collection and distribution of information. Gazik is a large village commanding the Julga of Tabbas—the richest part of the Kainat—as well as the routes to Herat, Sabzawar and Anardarrah. A sum of about Rs. 500 down for stock and a small monthly allowance from the Seistan Secret Service allotment would probably be sufficient to secure the services of a good man, such as the petty traders on the Seistan frontier who have had an excellent effect on our relations with the Afghans in that part. If some similar arrangement is not made, the British Consul in Seistan will have to continue to rely for information on local men secured through the Native Agent in Birjand, such as the last incumbent of the office of news-writer on the Kain frontier, Ghulam Rasul, himself the worst firebrand in the countryside. 14.

I was arranging for the despatch from Meshed of a secret agent for this very purpose, which might be better plan. Mons. Cesari is being sent to the frontier shortly.

Macpherson, I.A., His Britannic Majesty's Consul for Seistan and Kain, To—The Secretary to the Government of India in the Foreign Department. I have the honour to forward, for your information, a Note by Lieutenant Keyes on the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan frontier from Siah Koh to Kobat-i-Turk. The information on which Lieutenant Keyes’ Note is based was largely collected by him on the spot during his tour to Meshed in the past summer. Note on the undemarcated portion of the Perso-Afghan frontier from Siah Koh to Eobat-i-Turk, 1st section .—From Siah Koh to the Duroh-Farrah track. Between Siah Koh and the Duroh-Farrah track there are now no points occupied by either Persians or Afghans. The nomad encampments divide up the valleys among themselves for the sate of the ganjak tress, but all the valleys which contain these trees are said to be on the Persian side of the border. Asperan, of the exact position of which I am uncertain, at present three years ago by a Persian of Durob. I sent a man there last August who reported it to be deserted. news-writer, to re-occupy it. Captain Smyth, who visited Asperan, had an idea that Mr. Miller had recommended its consideration as a point on the projected railway from Ashkabad to Seistan. As at that time his waggons had just come down by the most eastern of the three routes which they have attempted, and a continuation of this route to the Hamun via Asperan would avoid the Naspanda-Anjireh defile without adding to its length, there is some probability in this idea. Mr. Miller himself tried to visit Asperan some short time after this, but owing to inaccurate information he lost the way, and one of his men dying of thirst, he give up the attempt. CJiah Sagak.—^On the Duroh-Farrah track, which used to be a well known trade route, the Persians have a Customs outpost at Chah Sagak. I was told in Duroh that the Persians claim up to Damdam, a well with no habitations, or even up to the Harut Kud, but at the same time my informants admitted that the Afghans grazed up to Chah Sagak, while they themselves never dared to graze to the east of it. In the Kainat during the rule of the Shaukat-ul-Mulk Tabbas and Nehbandan were the only two buluks that were under the rule of separate Naib Governors with the title of Hakim. The remainder of the country was portioned out among Naibs, who were merely katkhudas of the larger villages with their attendant mazraat. “ Buluk ” in fact, from being an administrative division, has come to be merely a geographical term. The Naib of Duroh is a descendant of a holy man of Samarkand, the remaining Naibs of this portion of the frontier are Afghans. 2nd Section. —Duroh-Farrah track to Gulwarda Tag-i-Nammad. This tract of country which is entered on our maps as the Dasht-i-Naumed, is said to afford excellent grazing except in the summer months. It’s name is derived from the “ nammad ” grass with which it is covered. The chain of hills which forms its eastern boundary is not the straight well defined range which is shown in the maps, but is a tangle of small ranges. There are said to be several watering places along the eastern “ daman ” of these hills. The nomad tribes which graze on this plain have a regular system of dividing the grazing ground, something like the system in vogue among the consists of a fallen-in karez and a ruined hut; it was occupied up till about Mr. Miller is said to have tried to persuade the son of Ali Jan, his BunjarSyads of the Naizar. None of tbe Persian grazing boundaries are more than one farsakh from the foot hills. Raza is the only village actually among the hills, and is occupied by Persians. I was informed in Dastgird that the frontier was two farsakhs to the east of Raza. There is a Customs post here. Gulwarda is the most northern point of the Tag-i-Nammad ^ there are said to be Customs sowars at this well under the Mirza of Ahwaz. The Afghans are said to graze right up to Gulwarda: my informant, who was in the service of the farmer of Customs before the Belgian era, told me that the Persian Customs sowars never ventured further east. A track from Gazik and Ahwaz to Anardarrah in Afghanistan crosses the Tag-i-Nammad, a little to the south of Gulwarda. There is a well called Puzejanga on this track, about which neither side seems to trouble itself as it is one of a group of places visited by pilgrims from the immediate neighbour hood. The Imam Raza was said to have been defeated by the Kaffirs there, and one of his many brothers is buried at Garmab near Ahwaz, the well of which is said to derive healing properties from his sanctity. The Naib* of Gazik is the Sarhaddar of this portion of the frontier. He is an Afghan of the Khawanin of Dastgird and the Naibs of Dastgird and Mijnabad are his brothers. Gazik is an important village of some thousand houses; its trade with Afghanistan in dried fruits, hides, wool and ghi has at times been considerable, but at present, owing to the oppression of the Naib of Gazik and the Naib Karguzat of the Kainat, trade seems to have been diverted towards Turbat, where, since the establishment of a British Consulate, Afghans can obtain justice. 3rd section. —Gulwarda to Yazdan. I was informed that this portion of the frontier made a curve in the favour of Afghanistan, but that there was practically no coming and going and no grazing disputes. Yazdan or Eoftad Karez^ this group of karezes was seized from the Afghans by Mir. Alam Khan, the late Hashmat-ubMulk. All but two of the karezes are said to be out of repair. There is a Customs post under the Mirza of Bamrud. The last incumbent of the Bamrud post was murdered in the beginning of this winter. His murder had nothing to do with the severity with which he carried out his work, and of which he boasted to me last June. He was described then to me as “khundar,” and it is now reported that his murderers are the nephews of one of his victims. ith Section .—Yazdan to Robat-i-Turk, the first pillar on the demarcated portion of the frontier. I was unable to obtain any information about his section as I was marching to Meshed as fast as I could get my caravan along. The Bahluri tribe who graze over it enjoyed the special protection of the late Hashmat-ul- Mulk. I am told that some sections of the tribe live in Afghan territory and it is probable, therefore, that they observe no fixed frontier. In the accompanying sketch map the red chain dotted line shows the actual possession of the Afghans according to information collected from the inhabitants, while the blue chain dotted line is the frontier as shown on the Survey of India map of 1897. Customs posts are underlined in green. TERENCE KEYES, Lieutenant, E. B.
