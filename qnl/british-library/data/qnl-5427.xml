Date 5th October, 1937. page 3003-04 Radio Sets supplied to Political and Military Officers, 1008* M r. Sri Praka sa: (a) Will the Foreign Secretary state free if it is a fact that radio sets are supplied/bo some political and military officers? If so, what officers and how many have the privilege extended to them? (b) Do these officers utilise the radio sets for themselves or do their neighbours or members of the general public also benefit by them? (c) ^hat is the total amount so far spent on these radio sets andjunder what head has the expenditure been debited? Lieutena nt C olonel A.E.3.Parsons: (a) Radio sets have been supplied to the following officers of the External Affairs Department, the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf, the Consuls-General, Khorasan and Kashgar, the Political Agent, Gilgit, and the Ministers in Kabul and Nepal. Cb) The sets are intended for official use as it is necessary, that the above officers who live in isolated stations should have early news of world events for the efficient performance of their duties. (c) The total cost is Rs.4,600 which has been debited as ’’Contingencies” of the External Affairs Department. Mr. Sri Prakasa: With reference to part (a) of the question are we to understand that these officers cannot afford to have these radio sets themselves? Lieutenant-Colonel A. E.B. Parsons: No. M r. Sri Prakasa: Why are Government pa ticularly °'bliging/obliging them in this connection when they do not oblige other officers v/ho are also equally interested in having world news as soon as possible? Lieutenant Colonel A*^ . 3 . Parsons : It is only for these officers that Government think that provision of world news is necessary. Mr. Sri Pr akas a: With reference to part (B) may I know if Government will consider the desirability of recommending to these officers that they may make these radio sets available to the general public also who may be profited by the existence of such radio sets? Lieutenant Colonel A.E.3.Parsons: Perhaps the Honourable Member is not aware where some of these places are. Mr. Sri Prakasa: He has himself mentioned them: and I may be expected to know as much geography as the Honourable Member opposite. For information, W.T.Ottewill.

III Sir, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to refer to the charge which has been included in the Statement I .tv \* r vV *4^ of expenditure on D. and C'\ Services in Iran for 1934/35 in respect of an allowance of Rs.100 per mensem to a clerk in the Bushire Residency Office for the maintenance of the wireless set there for the poriod July 1933, to March 193&amp;. 2, In this connection I am to invite attention to the last paragraph of your letter of 10th December, 1932, No.F.232-N/32, to the Political Resident in the Persian Gulf (a copy of which was forwarded to this Office with your Weekly Letter No.176 of 15th December, 1932), and to enquire whether, in view of the fact that the Empire Broadcasting Service began on 19th December, 1932, a report as to the necessity for the continuance of this allowance has since been furnished to the Government of India. 3. It is anticipated that the Foreign Office (to whom a copy of your letter of 10th December, 1932, was will desire an explanation of the charge. v'gd.) M. J. CLAUSON i !Reference Paper. Accountant-General' s Department. G-. fcootior No. 1009/37 Rec. 193 . Referred to the Political Secretary 2nd day of February 1937. It will be seen from P.S.UO/33(attached) that the G-overnment of India, in notifying the Political Resident, Bushire, of the authority for the purchase of a wireless set stated that the question of the grant of an allowance to the clerk should be examined when the Empire Broadcasting Stations was in working order and a report furnished to the Government of India. The set appears to have been despatched in July 1933 and the cost of the set was included in the Indian D. &amp; C. accounts for 1933-34. The allowance of Rs.100 per mensem to the clerk was not included until 1934-35 (see page 5 of the attached statement) when a charge was raised for the period July 1933 - March 1935* * It would * appear, however, from the notes below that the Empire Broadcasting Service began on the 19th December 1932 and the Political Secretary may consider it desirable to draw the attention of the Government of India to the the continued payment of the allowance as it is likely that the Foreign Office will desire an explanation. accountant General.

Before completing the order, however, it is thought that you might prefer to peruse the accompanying copy of a pamphlet describing the 'Mullard* valves. It is observed that one item in the list of equipment required is 'three Marconi D.S.S valves'. These valves are of an obsolescent type, and It is therefore suggested that you should specify other valves from the enclosed booklet. Of the types given therein the P.M.6X type is regarded as a suitable one, but It should be pointed out that two volt valves are now as efficient as or more efficient than six volt valves. 3. The Department of Overseas Trade will, therefore, await your decision before ordering the valves, whilst proceeding with the remaining requirements, which can be obtained and despatched separately. 4. The valves decided on could then be sent subsequently either by the same route or by post. 5. The total cost of the equipment when subsequently provided/ Lieut. Colonel T.C.W.

We have examined the question in consultation with the Director-General, Posts and Telegraphs and recomLiend that Political Resident be provided with a good Broadcast receiver covering short as well as long wave lengths but not capable of recording telegraphic signals automatically and that he should secure the part time services of a clerk from the Bushire Wireless station who would be responsible for the maintenance of the apparatus and for receiving news trans mitted by Wireless. We are advised that a good receiving set of the type described could be obtained for ©bout £100/-, and we recommend that the clerk should receive an allowance of Rs. 100/- per mensem subject to a 10^ cut during the currency of the emergency cut in India* 3* As this expenditure is divisible in moieties between the Home and Indian Government, we request that steps may kindly be taken \2 ** taken to obtain the concurrence of the Treasury to the dehit of this moiety against Imperial Hevenues. 4* This installation would give the Political Resident access to the British official tireless as at present trans mitted by Rugby, the news bulletins issued from the experimental short wave station of the British Broadcasting Corporation at Chelmsford and l&amp;ter to the news transmitted by the Umpire Broadcasting Station when this comes into being. 5. Ve recommend that as proposed in paragraphs 5 and c - of his despatch under reference, the Political Resident be authorised to make his own arrangements for the purchase of tnc apparatus on the advice of the local representative of the Imperial and International Communications Limited, and to take up the question of engaging the part time services of a suitable clerk with the Manager of the Persian Gulf Section, Karachi. 6.

ENCLOSURE IN INDIA FOREIGN SECRETARY’S Lottor No M. i -Ivet' fSMY, 1932(P 749/196/150) CM Dear Clauson, ff With reference to India Office letter P.Z.1852/32 of March 24th enclosing a copy of a despatch from the British Residency in Bushire to the Government of India, it occurs to us that Colonel Biscoe may be under some misapprehension in referring to ,f Broadcast Reuter Service as supplied to ships”. The only news service intended for ships at sea is the one which is compiled by the Wireless Press Limited of 72, Fleet Street - a subsidiary of Messrs. Iliffes, the publishers. It is true that this service is mainly composed of items supplied by Reuters and the other agencies, but this news is provided by them to the Wireless Press only on the understanding that the service is not reproduced anywhere on land. It seems probable that it is this Wireless Press service which Colonel Biscoe has in mind, but he is not correct in suggesting that anyone possessing a wireless receiving-set is at X' M.J.Clauson. Esqliberty to take it in. There is little doubt that anyone who is not at sea and who has not paid the Wireless Press Company for the right to receive their service would be committing a technical breach of copyright, even though it were not published in the ordinary meaning of that word. As far as I know, the British Official Wireless Service is the only wireless news transmission from this country which is free from all copyright restrictions.

I realise that the cost of supplying the ordinary Reuter , s service would prove prohibitive. I would suggest, therefore, that the Government of India should sanction the purchase for this Residency of a wireless receiving set similar, but much less elaborate and costly than that supplied to the Consulate General at meshed, and the grant of an allowance o f Rs. 100 a month to one of the sscx clerks in the wireless office to take down and let me have copies of British Official Wireless and of the Broadcast Reuters Service as supplied to ships. 3. This would presumably not contravene any telegraph Convention nor could the Persian Government contend that they were being defrauded of their just dues. This news service is broadcast primarily for ships but any private individual who has a wireless receiving set can take it in and the Company wouldJ i /i S would not be using their ordinary public wireless apparatus; the apparatus used would belong to the Residency* and the position would be that the Company would allow one of its clerks to do some work for the Resident provided it did not interfere with his official duties. I understand from the Officer-in-Ch^rge of the local station that it would be quite easy for one of the clerks of the wireless station to do this without any interference to the local paid traffic. Copies of the news received would also be supplied to His Majesty's Consul at Shiraz. 4. I unde r stand that a suitable receiving set for this purpose, capable of receiving short and long wave complete with batteries, pick up, spare valves and coils, costs approximately &lt;£4 0, to which must be added at least £lQ for duty. If therefore the Government would be so kind as to sanction this arrangement the expenditure involved would be £ 50 for the purchase of the set and Rs. 1,200 allowance per annum to the clerk. Por this relatively small expenditure the Resident would receive an adequate news service and v/ould be kept in touch with the outer wo rid. 5. I would suggest that I should be authorised to purchase the set myself on the advice of the head of the Imperial and Interna- tional Communications Company's wireless office. If this is done I do not anticipate any difficulty with the Persian authorities• If however the set is purchased through the usual official channels, difficulties may occur with the customs, as occurred in the case of the Meshed set, which as the Government of India will remember was held up for three months at Duzdap. If imported in my own name and described as a 'radio concert' the Persian authorities will let it through but if imported on British Government account and described as a wireless set there iaay be all sorts of difficulties.5. I would further suggest that I should take up the matter of the allowance to the telegraphist with the hanager of the Persian Gulf Section at Karachi, or if the Government of India consider it preferable, the matter could be referred to London and taken up by the India Office direct with the Head Office of the Company the re.

X X X X Reuter’s send their news cables, at their town exp ense, to one centre. Their Indian representatives, working with the Associated Press, then repeat by inland telegrams to their various subscribers. The cost of these telegrams is presumably either added to, or allowed for in, the charges made to subscribers for the news service. The Government of India are subscribers, and the news service is supplied to various officials in India, apparently including local governments. We do not know whether the Government of India’s subscription is for one service delivered say at Delhi, or for several services telegraphed at Reuter’s expense to different places. That is, we do not know whether the news is repeated to various Government officials by Government telegrams, or whether the subscription covers, the cost of inland telegrams sent by Reuters to such- officials .. Apparently however, .judging from Mr.Simpson’s minutes, the service to Persia was not an additional subscriber service, so far as Reuter’s were concerned. The news telegrams received and paid for by the Govern ment of India (as subscribers) were apparently repeated to Persia by Government telegram, via. Karachi. The cost being divided between British (Foreign Office) and Indian revenues in the normal manner of Persian legation charges. X X x X X iI Vi f’Z 70 Minute Paper. Department. V*^ i: 5475 193 !

Can the Information Officer supplement in any-'| way the information in the paper below (P.Z. 4468/31) about Reuter’s Rugby TTr orld Service? I suppose this is quite distinct from Reuter’s service of messages to India? JUjcdCry) ' ‘-t I (J-^~ N&gt; • Minute Paper. ECONOMIC &amp;. OVERSEAS Department. Volume 598, page ’’Telegraphs 162'. i * An Agreement with Reuters (or rather a draft of it which was approved hy the Government of India and apparently also by Reuters 2 -'Agent and was presumably signed by both parties) is in P.W.Dept. Proceedings for February 1873. It contemplates the transmission to Government officers in India of such telegrams as were sent by Reuters to India for the use of newspapers in India. The telegrams were not intended to be published by Government officers either by circulating them or | posting them in any public place of resort or otherwise | howsoever. The Agreement contains no reference to the transmission of the telegrams to Persia. The Secretary of State was to pay a suosidy of Rs.600 a month for this service. As the telegrams are now ( and have been for many years) transmitted by the Government of India to Persia, some later agreement or agreements were presumably made between the Government of India (nominally the Secretary of State for India) and Reuters,providing for the supply of the telegrams to Government officers in Persia as well as in India, and possibly also providing for the supply by Government of the telegrams or news extracted from them to newspapers in Persia. I have not been able to find any record of such later agreements. The payment made for the transmission of the telegrams from India to Persia by the Indo-European Telegraph ■Department is a separate matter. Further information about Reuter's Rugby World Service is contained in the attached copy of a letter from/nz S/8/L IMPERIAL COLi£JNICATIONS ADVISORY COMMITTEE, QUEEN ANNE’S CHAMBERS, TOTHILL STREET, WESTMINSTER, S.W.l. 25th August 1931. Sir, In continuation of my letter No.S/8/1, of the 21st July, 1931, acknowledging receipt of your letter No.E.&amp; 0.5034/31, of the 18th July, regarding certain issues in connection with the Reuter news telegrams transmitted from the Rugby Wireless Station, I am directed to inform you that the matter has been before the Imperial Communications Advisory Comnittee and that the position in regard to this service is briefly as follows **For many years past messages have been despatched by the Rugby Station for simultaneous reception in a number of countries in all parts of the world. Some of them are official news message*, compiled and despatched by the Foreign Office, which may be picked up in any country and published without charge. Others are compiled and despatched by Reuters and may be picked up and published only by those who have subscribed to the service. This latter type of service is provided for in Article 70 (formerly Article 69) of the Service Regulations annexed to the International Telegraph Convention, which prescribes that the messages must consist solely of news or corrmercial information of a general, as distinct from a private, character. In the early part of this year a service of this The Under Secretary of State for India, character/ Economic &amp; Overseas Department, India Office, S.W.l.(73 1 character consisting of news messages in English was started from the Dutch Wireless Station at Kootwijk. This was stated by Reuters to be a determined attempt to establish Amsterdam as the chief centre in Europe for the dissemination of wireless news. In order to counter this move the Reuters service now in question was started from Rugby on the 2nd March last. The service consists of a series of four messages each weekday containing an aggregate of about 1200 words. Reuters have notified that the messages are at present intended for reception either wholly or in part in India, South Africa, Argentina, Batavia, Estonia, Greece, Albania and Turkey; and the Telegraph Administrations in those countries have been duly advised in accordance with the terms of Article 70. The British Post Office receives payment from Reuters for the transmission of the messages but has no responsibility for their reception. It is for each Telegraph Administration concerned to decide whether the messages may be picked up in its country for use by Reuters’ clients and, if so, on what terms. * Information is being sought regarding the arrange ments made in South Africa for the reception and delivery of this service and will be forwarded to you when received. I am to add that with regard to the possible effect of the service on the revenues of Imperial and International Conmunications Limited, in reply to an enquiry, the Company has stated that 'although the extension of Reuterian broadcast services must be considered to affect our own press services adversely, no evidence is yet forthcoming that the service referred to has adversely affected us'.

On the' point, raise cl i,, paragraph I of the Foreign Office letter 1 am inclined^to agree that it would be rather undignified that we should continue to take advantage of the absence of copyright law in Persia to intercept and distribute the Reuters service in return for payment, though I see no particular reason ^hy we should not tap it for the advantage of the Legation and of Consular Officers. The position is further complicated by the fact that it appears from the present correspondence'that there is now a Reuters wireless news service transmitted from Rugby.

P. 8522/30, on the question of the supply of Reuters news to the Tehran Legation after the withdrawal of the Indc- Furopean Telegraph Department, I am desired to refer to the demi- official letter from the Foreign Office, No. P 1415/211/150 of 15th July, of which copies were sent by j the air mail of 17th July, and to say that, with a view to enabling hid to reply to the foreign Office, the Secretary of State would be glad to receive the observations of the ^ Government of India on the points raised therein, and also on the question generally. From the foreign Office letter it appears that a Reuter news service is now transmitted by wireless from Rugby (see in this connection my letter of 9th Jany., 1931, No. P.Z. 140/3]).£15. i *“ of June 1st on the question of the extent to which the Tehran Legation is to utilise Reuters nev/s service transmitted by wireless from Rugby. We do not think that advantage should be taken of the absence of copyright law in Persia to intercept and distribute the Reuter’s Service. Nor do we think ft possible to justify to the Treasury the expenditure involved by subscribing fifteen pounds a month to the Reuter’s Service, when the British Official Wireless is available. Before, however, replying to this effect, we should be glad to know if you wish to offer any observations on the subject. As you will remember, it was once our hope that it would prove possible to arrange not only for the Legation at Tehran, but also for certain of our consulates in Persia, to continue to J. G. Laithwaite, Esq. 14i to receive Reuter’s after the withdrawal of the Indo- European Telegraph Department. I believe I am right in supposing that, before the department’s withdrawal on February 28th last, the Government of India used to pay a subscription to Reuter’s which was considered by Reuter’s sufficiently large to include Persia and the Persian Gulf. If by any chance the Government of India have not reduced their subscription, it may perhaps be considered reasonable that it should still be held sufficient to cover the reception of Reuter’s in places like Tehran and Meshed and the continuance of the arrangement previously in force whereby it was published in the Tehran press. The fact that it now reaches those posts by wireless instead of by land telegraph from Karachi would seem to make little difference to Reuter’s.

George has produced typed - ’Roneoed’ - copies of these two services, British Official and Reuters combined, under the title 'British Hews” without any acknowledgement to or mention of Reuter’s, and has distributed them to members of this Legation and to certain Consular Officers (by post) viz: Reaht, Kerrn&amp;nshah, Ramadan, Tabriz; to the Ministry of Education, the itshah, and five local newspapers, free of charge; and to foreign Legations, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and four British institutions against payment of a subscription. This distribution, at current rates of subscription, just /manages The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.F., The Foreign office. i- 2 - :3:0:0, £15:Os Q* manages to pay Ita way, with a modest surplus for Mr. George, whl^h is likely to be considerably reduced next year owing to the necessity of replenishing stocks of paper and other material. Present subscriptions cannot be raised; and as the Vrench and Oerrrmn r ©gatlona and the Russian Kmbaasy supply their wireless news to the local press gratis, no charge can be made to the local press for the British nows. (The income from this source would, in any case, not exceed some three po mda monthly). In these circumstances, there are no funds out of whleh to pay th® fifteen pound# monthly subscription now demanded by Reuters. And the same would be true even if they were willing to reduce the charge pro rata in consideration of the fact that only a part of their news is picked up. 2. There is in Persia no law of copyright; and, ao far &amp;• I am aware, the Courts could not intervene to prevent the publication of Reuters news in this country. That being so, Reuters would, I suppose, be powerless to enforce the payment of the subscription demanded. If, however, you do not wish rne to take advantage of this circumstance, it will be necessary to cease distributing Reuter 1 ® news to other recipients than members of His Majesty’s rogation and His Majesty’s Consular Officers. I consider that this would be a pity, since, though Reuters does in part duplicate the British Official news, it also provides items not included in the latter, and British proaganda will suffer to that extent in Persia. Before, therefore, I give directions to limit the distribution of Reuters in this way, I will await yourinstructions. 3. I observe t&gt;mt Reuter’s, in their letter, mention M Post office emission chs.rge«’ , # I am not aware whether Reuter’s do actually pay such charges in respect of Persia. If they do pay, it occurs to me that, should it be possible to remit such charges to the extent of the fifteen pounds monthly which Reuter’s demand of this legation, they could have no objection to the publication in Persia of their news. I should be glad to learn whether you consider such a solution feasible. I have the honour to be with the highest respect Rlr, Your most obedient, humble servant. (Signed) R. H.

The Secretary of Ctate hopes, however, that, v *hen the situa tion resulting from the department's withdrawal is less un settled, it will be pOFGiblb to propose some satisfactory arrangement to this end. ;•&gt;.

The Secretary to the Treasury.y 2. enabling the negation to counter-act the effect of the publication of the Russian and other foreign official wireless reports in the Tehran press. This can apparently be arranged without difficulty. The decretory of State understands, as a result of semiofficial discussion with the India Office, that the Indo-European Telegraph depart ment are prepared to hand over to His Majesty's uegation without charge the wireless receiving apparatus and batteries now in the possession of their Tehran office. It should therefore be possible to arrange for the recep tion of the British v-ire! jss news at His Majesty’s Legation at little cost beyond that of the salary of a trained operator. It will be seen, from the enclosed correspon dence, that Mr. Parr has requested telegraphic authority to employ th© present Armenian operator of the set at a salary not exceeding and probably somewhat less than. lips. 310 a month. 4. I am therefore to express the hope that Their Lordships may be moved to sanction this proposal ut a very early date, and to request their authority to bear as a charge on Imperial funds a moiety of the cost in volved, on th© understanding that the India Office agree that the remainder shall be borne as a charge on Indian funds. o.

Before we can reply to Parr we shall have to We J.Gr, Lai thwait e , Esq .We shall, therefore, be very much obliged to you if you will ascertain, as a matter of great urgency, what we can tell the Treasury on this point. 0 1*1 (\*S* CX*?o. 58* British Legation, ?ehran. 5th February, 1931 ^gO rt Sir, I have tne honour to acknowledge the reoeipt of your despatch Ho. 33 (ft 6882/8940/34) of January 16th, regarding the supply of Keuter^ Mews to HIa rajesty*# Legation and certain of His Majesty's Coneulatea in Persia after the withdrawal of the Indo-European Telegraph Department. 2. ?h© two principal objections to the substitution of the British Official Wireless Mews for Reuter^ are already known to you. They are, first, the general unsuitability of the former for Persian consumption and secondly, the fact that His Majesty’s consular Officers, who are in some ways in greater need of reliable British news than His Majesty’s Legation, will not be able to receive the Rugby wireless bulletins. I agree, however, that the expense of transmission over the Imperial and International OQ^unications company^ cables and the Persian land line from Bushire would probably prove prohibitive. There is, moreover, another consideration to be borne in mind: Reuter^ Mews received in this manner from Bushire would almost certainly arrive both late and badly mutilated and might. In addition, be occasionally censored before delivery. 3. In these circumstances. It seems essential to provide for the reception of the Rugby wireless after /March The Right Honourable Arthur Henderson, M.P., The Foreign Office~ 2 - Mar^h 1st, If only as a tarcporary expedient. It would be useless. In ray opinion, to approach the Persian tireless Telegraphy Station with a ^iew to receiving the British Official bulletins through that channel. At present, the Persian wireless is reiaarkable for Its inefficiency even in this country, and with the withdrawal of the Dermrtisent it is to be anticipated that it will be even less able to cope adequately with the increased traffic. That bt*ing so, it ?ill be necessary to instal the Departinent*a wireless telegraphy receiving apparatus in the legation. The Tehran Director informs roe that the set ia in good order, and he can supply enough batteries to last about a year, A trained operator is, however, essential, although the rate of transmission is, I believe, very slow from Rugby: no member of the rogation*s staff bus a auficlent technical competence or even a knowledge of the morse code, and atmospheric disturbances and occasional 'jamming* by Soviet stations greatly increase the difficulties of reception. As stated in my despatch No, 550 of November 18th, the present Armenian onerator oi the set receives a total salary of Rupees three hundred and ten a month. He will be discharged on fearch 1st, and I have therefore the honour to request that I may be authorised,by telegraph, to employ him after that date at the same wage, if necessary on a temporary contract admitting of cancellation at a month's notice. It is possible that the above salary may admit of some reduction as I understand that the operator will receive a pension after &amp;erch 1st. 4 * I should, perhaps, add that the French, German and Russian missions employ trained wireless telegraph operators for the same purpose; no objection /could.fco. 33 (*~'b82/8940/34) £ 3 52 l 9 3 l°iffl^QK omcs, s.w.i.

But Mr. Simpson tells me that he thinks the Persians are likely to stand out for their full rate (which might run to as much as 5d. a word) in respect of telegrams transmitted over the Persian landlines, and the expense of this would clearly be prohibitive.

It will be seen that the suggestion has been made to the Foreign Office that they should make certain enquiries of the Post Office in this connection, and if the suggestion is accepted by | * them, the result of their enquiries^; will be communicated in due course. Meanwhile, it is thought that the Government of India will wish to consider the problem as affecting at any rate the Consular posts maint ained by them in Persia^ r/wzhj, The Secretary of State would be glad to receive in due course any observations which the Government of India may wish to offer on the subject. L./.1'V Note by Director-in-Chief, Indo-European Telegraph Department, dated 15th December, 1930. There a.re two questions involved here, one is the payment to Reuters for the news and the other is the payment for its distribution. As regards the former, I understand that the Government of India pays a subsidy to Reuters for a daily nev/s service which permits of its dissemination to British officials in India, Persia and the Persian Gulf and so far, therefore, as Reuters is concerned the withdrawal of the I.E.T.D. need make no difference. For the transmission of the news telegrams the Indian Post and Telegraphs Department deliver a copy at Karachi at an annual cost of about Rs.2500 which is shared between the Foreign Office and the Political Department of the Government of India, and there is no reason why this should not continue. For the telegraphic distribution from Karachi to officials in Persia and the Persian Gulf the I.E.T.D. have charged a lump sum of £400 per annum which also is shared in the same way. When the I.E.T.D. ceases to operate special arrangements will have to be made with the Communications Company for transmission over the Gulf cables and with the Persian Government for transmission over the land lines in Persia. I may mention here that from the telegraph point of view the MOO hitherto charged is almost a nominal sum for the services rendered, and I fear that the charges demanded by the Communications Company and Persian Government will be such a.s to render the supply of Reuters news prohibitive. I am also very doubtful whether the transmission over the lines to be worked by Persia will prove at all satisfactory. I understand that Reuters now send out a news service by wireless through the Rugby station - this is additional to the/ , ^3the Foreign Office news service - and I suggest that enquiries might be made from the G-.P.O. about this service. It is possible that this service v/ould meet H.BJf.'s needs and be much cheaper than arranging to take the service Reuter supplies to India. This might solve the question for Teheran but wireless receivers would have to be supplied to other stations also.SI. n- FORBIGN OFFICE, S.W. 1. FOREIGN 8th December, 1930. My dear laithwaite, '' I enclose a copy of a despatch from Parr raising the question of supply of Reuter's news to the Tehran graph Department, I aim not at present clear what exactly is our position in the matter vis-^-vis Reuters and how the old arrangement with Reuters was come to, but I am trying to find out from our archives. Assuming that you and the Government of India and ourselves agree with Parr as to the desirability of the legation continuing to receive Reuters, the question arises whether we can simply go to Reuters here and ask them what arrangements they propose to make, or whether, as I suspect, Reuters news goes to Persia purely for governmental purposes, and we must draw up the necessary scheme and make arrangements with the Persian authorities for the continuance of its Xegation after the withdrawal of the Indo-European Tele You will presumably also be interested fromthe point of view of other posts in Persia and on the Gulf, I think it likely that Simpson knows all the baok history of the arrangement with Reuters and will be able to advise what our course should be, in the event of it being agreed that the service should be continued. So far as Tehran is concerned, it might be possible for Reuters news to go by the Imperial Communications Company's new wireless service, though I don't know how correctly the Persians would take it in. The question of the relative utility of Reuters and the official Rugby wireless was discussed with Tehran in 1927, and the Legation advised that for their purposes Reuters was definitely the better. You will see from paragraph 7 of Parr's despatch that he remains of that opinion. Anyway, I serd. you the despatch, so that you may consider it^while we are going further into the matter here^and in the hope that Simpson will be able to advise on the technical side of the question,^-the delivory ofg- afthe 'Cluse ilownrr Yours ever,MM u HO. 5b0. f ^' 4 4 * ,ish i(e ^ atipn » 3K vii 'W f 28 i'KW I960 J Dehrtiri, i:ove ovember 18th,1930* Sir, X have the honour to invite a reference to your despatch Ho. 3^2 (8.3261/2940/34) of June 26th last re^ardin^ the financial arrancement b in force for the supply of Keuter news up to torch next year. 2 .

It is still quite as essential now as it has been in the past that Reuters* news should continue to reach Tehran. The arguments in favour have been given in despatches of previous years and I will not repeat them except to say that so long us wireless news from French, German and HuesIan sources is reproduced in the local press, it seeraa nec&lt; a sBary that Reuters * should also continue to receive the publicity which has been reserved for it for many years. 4. /asuaing that Bis fajesty's Government will continue The Eight Honourable Arthur Henderson, The Foreign Office.
