P olitical D epartment. Lieutenant Colonel L ewis P elly, Acting Political Resident and Consul General in the Persian Gulf. T he C hief S ecretary to G overnment, In the Political Department, Bom B ushire, l8b&amp;. J submit some superficial remarks, based on personal observation and hearsay, concerning the tribes, trade, and resources, around the shore line of the Persian Gulf. 2. As you enter the Gulf, the town of Bunder Abbass, with its adjacent historic Island of Ormuz, lies on your right, and Cape Mussendom on your left. 3. As you leave the Gulf, after traversing its entire length North-Westward, and pass up the Shat-ul-Arab, or Busreh River, the town of Busreh is on your left, and the fort of Mahomera on your right. 4. All the Territory from Mahomera to Bunder Abbass, is directly or indi rectly under the Persian Government. And all the Territory from Cape Mussen dom to Busreh, is either directly or indirectly under Turkey; or else is held by independent Arab Chiefs. 5. A map is annexed, showing the several jurisdictions and their principal Ports, all round the Gulf: beginning at Mahomera, and ending at Busreh. 6. These jurisdictions may be classified, and their Ports named as follows: 1st. Territory owning the Sovereignty of the Shah of Persia, but administered by The Cliaab Arabs from tlie Karoon to the Hindeean, including Mahomera, Native Arab Dorack, Bunder Mashoor, Hindeean, and Zeitoon. PI * f . ^ ' Minor Arab settlements to the southward of the Hindeean, but which are in ^ ' SUDject, this report included under class II for specified reasons. llOWGVer, to Visi tation from the Finance Department of tlie Persian Prince Governor at Sinister. 2nd. Territory directly under the local Officers of the Shah; and of which the Customs and Bushire, Congoon, Asseeloo, Nabend, Nakheeloo, Cheroo, Khelat, Charrack, Revenues are Mogoo and Lingah. 'fli ^ ^ f ^ There are many other small Hamlets along this line; but they are unworthy ^ of particularization. lor by Mer Ma jesty's Gover nors, or accounted for, in detail, to the Persian Treasury. 3rd. Territory farmed by the Shah to the Sultan of Muscat, for a term of years, 1. Bunder Abbass with its adjacent district, northwards to a point near under a Treatv Lingah, and southwards to a tract whose political jurisdiction is not determined , rl * f 1 under Treaty entered into, and recognised by every body concerned. 2nd. Island into be- of Kishm and Dependencies. tween the late Imaum of Muscat and His Majesty, in 1856. 4th. Ternto - The Mussendom Promontory inclusive of Khoomzar, and Khussub. The Frontier ^ y ' % , i between Muscat and Ras-ul-khyma Territory, is near where the plain and mountains ry ^ 11 ecty un meet at Shaam. der the Sultan of Muscat./ 5tli. Territories lield by those independent Maritime Arab Chiefs, for- . merly the pirates of the Gulf; now partially Ramse, ^as-ul-khyma. Shargah and Fasht. commercial; and bound by the terms of Jazirath -ul-Hamra. Khan. a permanent iruce to keep the peace at Amulgavine. Debaye and Aboo- g ea : the English Resident in the Gulf, Ejmaun. tbabee. being mediator and quasi guarantee for the observation of this Truce, by all the subscribing Chiefs; more especially during the season of diving, on the Pearl Banks. 6th. Territories recognising the Suzereignty of the Turkish Govern ment ; but practically independent under Kateef or Nejd Territory, Koweit or Grane. t j ie j r own Chiefs. 7th. Territory di rectly under the Pashas of the Tur- Busreh Zobeir. Paon with intermediate small Ports along right bank of the Bnsreh Eiver. kish Government. 7. The largest territory falling under the first class, is that of the Chaab Arabs. It may be generally described as a vast. The Chaab Arabs. well-watered, and fertile plain, contained between the lines of the river Karoon to the north, and the Hindeean river to the south; and sloping imperceptibly from the lower spurs of the Khogiloo mountains, and that upper portion of Khuzistan, which lies along the Ram-Hormuz* and Shuster route. South-westward to the Huffar Cutting, and the Bamsheer river: to the Westward of which channels, the Chaab Territory further extends (under a sepa rate branch Tribe, at Mahomera) to the left bank of the Shat-ool-Arab. 8. The Chaab plain* is intersected in its entire length from the Eastward (northerly) to the head of the Persian Gulf, by one fine stream, which, receiving affluents from the mountains, at various points lying between Ram-Hormuz and Behbehan, flows through the Chaab Territory under the name of Jerahee; throw ing off numerous natural, improved, or wholly artificial water channels; more especi ally from its right or northern Bank. The Jerahee is navigable for boats of 4 or 5 Tons, throughout its length; until within some 12 miles of Ram-Hormuz. When it reaches nearly the latitude of Dorack (or Fellahiah), the chief town of this Territory, it supplies a broad canal, which, after flowing about 6 miles, passes through Dorack, throwing off several agricultural water courses, from both sides; or wasting itself in floods, until it is reduced to a small canoe channel, which opens on the Huffar or lower Karoon, and so communicates with Mahomera, and the main River.—Two ancient canals coming from the Karoon, cross the Dorack canal at right angles, and flow south towards the sea. They are named respectively, Mourad, and Sooleymanya. 9. After passing the point (called Kazenah or the sluices) whence the Dorack water is supplied; the Jerahee curves south, passing Zoobeea within one fursac of Dorack, there throws off several more broad offshoots; and then flows onward to the sea having its Port at Boozeah. Zoobeea is the point to which small sea going craft come up for the supply of Dorack; and goods are carried to and fro Zoobeea and Dorack, by land. 10. Tracking from the Huffar up the canoe channel towards Dorack, you can easily see the sails of boats passing up the Karoon. But on reaching Dorack, the Karoon is distant some nine fursacs. The Jerahee, at the sluices, and for the few miles I passed further up it, has a midchannel of 8 feet in depth; gently curving, and well defined banks, irregularly fringed with date trees; and showing on either hand, a well farmed breadth of land, with cattle and horses; the lower lands on the right bank over towards the Karoon line, are in rice. 11. Bunder Mashoor is a seaport of the Chaabs, and distant from Dorack from 30 to 40 miles in an E. S. E. direction. And an irregularly curved line, passing a little within Mashoor, through a point a little lower down the canoe canal than Dorack, and so rounding to the left bank of the Karoon, would, during the winter or inundatory season, trace the blending of the grassy plain with swamp or flooded land. Indeed, as you pass up the Dorack canoe channel, your horizon * Called in cotn- mon parlance Hor- muz. * A sketch of the Chaab plain, and of the coast line in general round the head of the Gulf, has now been very care fully prepared by Dr. Colvill, from our recent marches round that line. I suggest a reference to that sketch, which accompanies my report, No. 65 of this day, sent by this opportunity.is bounded by flooded land, whether you look towards the Karoon, or towards Mashoor and the Gulf line. It seems that the Towns, in fact, have been built on the margin of the flood; and it is needless to add that as the water subsides, these towns and the pasture lands so opened up to the wandering tribes, are poisoned by Malaria. 12. Still riding in a general E. S. E. direction, from Bunder Mashoor to Uindeean (being the sea town on the river of that name) you are on the same vast green plain; here rough with low brush wood, there dotted with the tents and flocks of the Arabs. This year, the rain being unusually scant, the grass was short ; fit indeed for sheep, but not for cattle. I was informed, however, that in ordinary seasons, the grass is above a horses knees. Barley was to be bought. But the straw of last year being exhausted, and that of this season not yet cut, I was hard pushed to find it anywhere in the Chaab country; and held myself fortunate to collect some of inferior quality at Dorack; and carry it not only to the Hindeean, but to Bunder Dill am. 13. Hindeean is one of two entrepots (the other being Dillum) for the Behbehan line of Trade. At the town of Hindeean the river is unfordable; I found no^ ferry-boat,^ and was lucky in getting my baggage across in a chance Bugla, lying in the river. The Hindeean is navigable for light boats and canoes to within a short distance of Behbehan. Zeitoon, formerly Zeidoon, is a central point higher up the stream, and distant 10 fursacs from Hindeean, where trade from Hindeean and Dillum converges. Goods go up by land, passing to Deh Moollah, then Arab, and then Zeitoon. These three marches are level;—but the fourth and last march of 5 or 6 fursacs, from Zeitoon to Behbehan, is stony; and through the lower spurs of the mountain range. 14 ^ The view looking inland from Behbehan is fine. The stream a hundred yards wide, deep, between high steep soil banks; a noble plain on either side. An old cedar tree or two and an old Tomb break the middle ground; backed by reddish, sulphurouslooking castellated, low ridge of hills; behind which a higher deep indigo range; and far in the distance, overlooking all, the snowy peaks of the Khogiloo Tribes. 15. Crossing the Hindeean, and moving South East, the grass plain, becomes barren; and covered with a saline efflorescence; then pierced by salt water creeks, round the heads of which are strewn the ruins of Guebre, or as the natives call them Hindoo Buildings. The plain then contracts, rugged spurs of the hills com ing finally down to within 3 or 4 miles of the sea., until you reach the narrowest neck, at the frontier village of Sheikh Abool Sheikh of the Cbaabs; or Shah Abool Shah of the Persians.* This village was the site of a Guebre, Temple, or other holy place. It is now, like so many of its fellows, an Imam Zadeh. The village possesses all the essentials of vileness, filth, and ruffianly rascality, viz., the congregation of a set of ill-conditioned semi-barbarians, on an ill-favored spot; for the guardianship of a Shrine, and exempted, on condition of such office from all taxation, supervision and law. 16- I subjoin a statement of the principal Chaab Tribes: but the numbers of their fighting men are I think overstated. Alboogbesh Chief Moraid 6,000 grown men Boozeeah their principal Town. Asarkeerah ,, Zair Kraidee ... 4,000 ,, Oushar near Boozeeah. Mukasebah ,, Saadoon 2,500 ,, Anayetee more S. &amp;. E. Albooalee ,,Saadoon 2,500 ,, On a creek no name. Sowayhat „ Showash 2,500 „ do. do. Aimukhndum,, Shureeb 4,500 ,, Khoot near Dorack. * N ote .—It is remarkable that those shrines which date from a period anterior to that of the Prophet, and which had previously been consecrated as Fire Temples, Lingam Knbbers, or Poojah places &amp;c., have since been confirmed as shrines or places of Pilgrimage by both Soonees and Sheeahs. W hereas those shrines which are now resorted to by only one of the two principal sects of Islamism, date from a time subsequent to that of the Prophet's birth. Again where a shrine had been resorted to by infidels, and subsequently seized by the Moslems, the country in which it was situate remaining the frontier between the two religions, such shrine continued to be resorted to by the old infidels, and by the Mahomedan invaders and their converts. /( 4 A1 Khanaferah Chief Hajee Hamdan 5,000 grown men On road to Dorack from Mahomerah. Bhawee „Akheel 8,000 On the Jerahee creek or mouth. Zoorgan ,,Jubbur 8,000 „ On pastoral grounds. Sherayfat „ Meer Muhanna. 10,000 „ Hindeean and Deh Moolla and on the plains. Amoor „ Shooheetee 10,000 „ Wandering and pastoral. Beni Khaled ,, Shadee 5,000 „ ditto ditto. These tribes are scattered throughout the pasturage during winter and sprino-; and concentrate at or near Fellahiah towards summer, for provisions and Trade. 17. It is interesting and necessary, when considering the Arabs, to distin guish between a series of grades towards civilization, in which they may, at present, be found. There is the Bedouin, wandering, pastoral, tent loving, disdaining to trade, yet avaricious, and willing to sell his ghee, his mutton, or his horse. But the Bedouin is always found in wide and open wastes, unpressed upon by adequate exterior power. Yet, even the Bedouin bends to circumstances. He accepts the region allotted for his pasture grounds. Plunder has its laws ; and vengeance its chivalry. If he will not trade, he has still wants; and suffers the presence of a Jew or Saleebah; * as the Afghan suffers that of the Hindoo. 18. A little higher in the scale you find, as with the Chaabs, the original wandering pastoral Arab, in a district, where, he is pressed upon from without ; and where boundless plunder and roaming are restrained by exterior force. The Arab then partly turns to agriculture, and for this he must in some degree settle. Society harmonizes to this level. Trade is possible. Corn is sold. Abbas are woven and exported. Dates are planted. The appetite for trade grows by what it feeds on. Huts of reeds replace tents; and one sees in their feeble efforts at reed ornamentation, and in their rough twisting of thick reed rope for their Bunds, the possible germ of some of the architectural efforts of our own savage ancestors. Man, at first accepts from nature, what she spontaneously affords; and feebly, through thousands of years, thinks towards artificial means. 19. let higher in the scale, you find the Arab flourishing, as an experienced and wealthy merchant in a town; or administering a well-ordered, and comfort able rural district. 20. What recurs to one in passing among these people, is, that, here, before you, is society, in the making; or in its transitional state towards civilization. It is probable that the Law under which human society now evolves, is that under which it has always evolved. The circumstances around you may then be data for the elucidation of a true theory. They are at least facts, fresh from nature. 21. As to the political condition of the Dorack Territory, it is really tribu tary to Persia; paying, I believe, a considerable sum into the Shuster Provincial Treasury. Its element of greatest commercial strength and military weakness, lies in its bountiful supply of water. It would be difficult to find a territory of equal extent, where, fresh water containing sufficient silt, is poured along the plain, in all directions, through channels, so numerous, and so easily manageable. But it was by damming the exits of this water towards the sea, that the Persians flooded the country, and reduced the Chaabs. 22. The district of Mahomera originally formed part of the Dorack Chief tainship. But the present Sheikh of Mahomera separated his clan; fostered the naturally excellent position of his Fort for commerce; and has since remained at * X ote —I saw some men of this tribe at Koweit, and elsewhere. They worship the cross (Saleb) and perform many ceremonies, more nearly allied to the corruptions of Asian Christianity than to Islamism. Men and women dance round a sort of May Pole. They wear a carter's smock, coming down to the feet, and which, like a boys' Pinafore, ties behind. They possess a beautiful breed of donkies, which they ride, without girths, upon a saddle made like a cottage wooden chair bottom. They squat on this seat, and twist their legs over a pummel peak; crossing them over the donkey's neck. They seem to prize their saddles, as an Arab does his mare; and would not sell them. They seemed a merry quick-witted, disreputable lot, with retrouse noses, and Irish features. There they stood, eyes twinkling (legs and hands always on the fidget) and pelted as with the peelings of their fun.feud witli his old Chief. When I Avas at Dorack, both Sheikhs had been called before the Prince Governor, for the settlement of their mutual grievances. 23. As to the commerce of the Chaabs, it is limited; and flows in different channels, according to the season of the year; some of it reaches Mahomera via the Huffar, and is mixed tip with the trade of that Port, which, in turn, is some times included under the general trade of the Shat-ool-Arab, or Busreh line. The wealth of Mahomera as of the Shat-ool-Arab in general, consisting, mainly, in dates. 24. Dorack itself exports some wool, and abbas (the Arab cloak). Of rice also, about 600 Karehs (each Kareh 100 Hashem, maunds of 124 lbs. each). It possesses fine reaches of dategroves along its streams. But these are wholly for home consumption. 25. The principal sea Ports of the Chaabs are Bunder Mashoor and Hindeean. And the total duty collected on the exports and imports at each of these open towns may be about 40,000 Krans, or something less than 20,000 Rupees, eventually paid into Shuster. 26. The exports from Bunder Mashoor may be approximately analyzed as follows:— Wool to the value of one lac of rupees shipped to Koweit or Busliire for ultimate transport to India. Grain, mainly wheat, and barley to the value of 22,000 rupees. Hice from the Jerahee and Eam Hormuz fields to the value of 10,000 rupees. Eogun to 5,000 rupees in value for Koweit and Busreh. Some 10,000 sheep per annum are shipped for Busreh and Koweit also. Grain pays an export duty of 32 Krans per Kareh Wool 32 Krans on the 1,000 lbs. weight. Eogun ^ Kran per Dubbeh. And each sheep ^ Kran. 27. The imports at Bunder Mashoor are, Piece goods to the value of 50,000 Krans, paying a duty of 2 Krans on an average of 10 yards piece per 20. Dates 10,000 Karelis paying 5 Krans per Kareh. 28. Hindeean imports. About 1,000 Karelis of dates from Busreli, eacli Kareli paying 5 Krans duty. And Piece goods to tlie value of 20,000 Krans. 29. The exports of Hindeean may be. Grain, mainly wheat and barley to the value of 2,00,000 Krans, coming down from the Behbehan and Hormuz lines, and paying a duty of ^ Kran per Hashem maund. 1,00,000 Krans worth of wool from the upper country. 10,000 Krans worth of Eogun. And some 10,000 sheep paying l Kran export duty each. 30. As to a possible development of trade in Chaab, I am of opinion that this will always be confined to the territory of Chaab itself, and to the Provinces of Shuster, and Behbehan. The passes leading into the plateau of Persia from these points, may possess strategic advantages, but they are not lines that trade could work to a profit, in competition with Bushire, Abbass, and Baghdad.—Rice, corn, ghee, and the products generally, of semi-pastoral and semi-agricultural tribes enjoying a rich soil and fine water command, are what might be expected from the territory contained between the Karoon river, the Bahktyari, and Kho- giloo mountains, the Hindeean, and the Bamsheer. Dates of course might form an item, and be grown, as might also be cotton, over a large area. 31. I consider the Chaab* territory by no means an easy one to traverse. * N ote —The Chaabs like some other Arab tribes, settled along the Persian Coast of the Gulf, have become Sheeahs. They are partly persianized also in costume and habits. An old Soonee observed to me with regret, that these Chaabs should wear a Syud's dark green Turban ; and fold angle with tea urns and uniforms. The aseel Arab of the other Eiver bank would never intermarry with a Chaab. But a Chaab would not only marry thence if he could, but accepts also a Persian in his bed. It is very amusing as you cross the head of the Gulf, to hear the Arab apologizing for some illhap, by saying that the offender is a Mogullee, a Slieeah ; while the Persian excuses all gaucherie by the nasal words, they are Arabs, goats. A young Sheikh who was hawking in the desert with me, explained a miss-flight, by saying that his bird was a Mogullee. Had he been bred a Soonee, he would never miss. I noticed, however, that the hawk dined hastily off his first Ooboura. This lad told me, also, the best way to hawk as to raid, was for two people to sit dos a dos on a camel: thus, as it were, giving the birds assurance of a man, looking before and after. 2My baggage animals were delayed nearly a fortnight at Maslioor, unable to reach Dorack. The direct road to Dorack from the Huffar was quite impassable when 1 dragged in a canoe from JVlahoinera to I^oiack. Ihere is a circuitous road going round near the Karoon, which leads from Dorack to the Huffar, but even that is almost impassable in the wet season. During the subsidence this territory would be fatal to horses and men whether from Masma, or the marsh insects. Grass is plentiful over boundless plain, in the spring of favorable years. But in drv years your horse may famish. For the old chopped straw of last year is out; the grass is too short for a horse to crop; and young corn is findable only in patches near the towns. 32. The water is brackish along the entire line, unless when drawn from the river: that of the Hindeean and Huffar is delicious. The water in the Dorack canal, through the marsh portion of it, is rough, and distasteful. It is reputed also unwholesome; especially during the summer months. 33. In former'times, a series of circles of Arab villages, lying alono- the coast to the southward of Hindeean, would have fallen under the class of territories which, though inferior in size and power to that of the Chaabs, were yet tributary to Persia, but administered by their native Chiefs or Sheikhs. 34. ^ At present, however, all these Settlements have fallen so much under the jurisdiction of Shiraz or Bushire, and are so intermingled with their affairs that it seems preferable to notice these Settlements under the heading of territory directly under the local Officers of the Shah. 35. I pass accordingly to the second class; of which the nearest Port to the Chaab Territory is that ofDeelum, situate a few miles below Shah Abool Shah, above alluded to. _ Bunder Deelum is under the Government of Bushire; and the constitution of this sea board provincial Government, is somewhat complex. Down to a period of recent date, Bushire was, like other Ports alono- the coast governed by its own Sheikhs. Eventually the Bushirees fell out with the nmh- bouring tribes of the Dashties and Tungistoonees. Persia availed herself of the dissension to press cm Bushire; establish a Government there, and reduce both pashties and Tungistoonees, together with some minor tribes, such as the Rohillas immediately around the Bushire creek, to a condition subordinate to Bushire. 36. At the present moment, the Government extends from Deelum on the JS orth to near Congoon on the South; embracing a series of petty tribes both Persian and Arabic, living in their own circles of villages, and interfered with bv t e. central Government very much in proportion to their several means of resistance. 37. Southward from Congoon toLingah, both inclusive, lies a chain of coast Milages or small I orts, whose revenues and affairs are subordinate to the Provin cial Government of lars at Shiraz; although the Governor of Bushire, in his capacity of High Admiral of the sea and Ports (Persia does not possess a vessel of War), has charge of their maritime interests. 38. rims then, after leaving the Hindeean, we find a coast line from Deelum to Lmgah, niore or less subordinate to Bushire; and of which, the Settlements and nbes, from Deelum to Congoon, may be approximately estimated at # Persians an 4 Aiabs, and those from Congoon to Lingah ,[ Persians and ^ Arabs. + . xw a S en eral rule, the Arab circles of villages are farmed and adminis- eiec )\ their own Sheikhs, who arrange their own civil disputes, and pay a lump sum o icvenue per annum. Murder would be compensated by blood money; but ae bjeivh would not send the murderer to Bushire for punishment. The Sheikh in urn w ou d levy rent on the farmers by the cow. A cow is supposed to plough land enough for 4 maunds of seed barley, and 4 maunds of seed wheat. A farmer as vs iis&gt; neighbour, for instance, how many cows he is sowing. The crop borne y a cow o and, pays f5 or so Krans per annum, in money; and one maund of vv iea., an one of barley, apparently for K urn eh, or expenses in collecting. 1 ' n c . ;lS0 , 0 ' a Persian circle of villages, or a Persian Port, (not like the Dashties sufficiently strong to defend itself), the Hakem or Sheikh, or Moollahwould be removed from his Government at the pleasure of the Bushire Governor. Criminals would be sent to Bushire; and revenue, if not punctually paid, would be levied by Mohussil, or failing this way, by force. 41. Reviewing the trade of this coast line as you pass along it from the North, Southward; the first Bort that comes under notice is that of Bunder Deelum. It is a small, busy, open town clustering round a square fort. It is , , 0 one of two points, the other being Hindeean already k e paragrap 1 o. remarked on, where sea borne trade lands, to follow the Behbehan line; Zeitoon, the point of general trade convergence on the Hindeean river, is distant from Deelum about 5^ fursacs. The stream is crossed by a raft, or in the low season at a ford, a mile or two before you reach Zeitoon. Formerly Zeitoon returned 9,000 Tomans customs, per annum, but now yeilds only 3,000 Tomans. This falling off, like that of both population and revenue along the entire coastline from Mashoor to Congoon, is attributed to the absence of attraction between the Government and the people; and to the consequent emigration, or idleness of the latter. Deelum, like all other Forts along this coast, is a mere entrepot; and the number of its resident inhabitants does not adequately represent the extent of its commerce. Zeitoon is a fine agricultural district. The trade of Deelum may be roughly stated as follows: Exports. Wheat and Barley to the value of. 30,000 Krans to Busreh, Koweit and Lingah. Wool ditto 1C0,000 ditto Bushire and Koweit for India. Bogun cherag ditto 10,000 ditto. Grapes and Baisins ditto 20,000 ditto to Koweit and Busreh. Bogun ditto 30,000 ditto. Imports. Piece goods 150,000 Krans value 1 Sugar 50,000 ditto &gt; From Bushire and Koweit. Tea 10,000 ditto J Dates 50,000 ditto Equal to 1,000 Karehs from Busreh. These imports go to Behbehan and also Bam Hormuz. The Customs receipts may be from 15,000 to 20,000 Krans per annum, on both exports and imports together. 42. Between Bunder Deelum and the next Port of Bunder Reegh lie the traces of the ruins of an ancient Fort; and of ancient cities of immense extent. This tract has been known as Genaweh from time immemorial. Its upper portion is a confused tumbling of low, grotesquely shaped, sand stone and earthy hills; in parts intersected with vertical lines of gypsum, cropping up like the jagged edges of broken plate glass, or strewn over the slopes, like pieces of ice. Leaving this rugged, confused region, you emerge on the beautiful plain of the ancient Geramha, the chief town of Genaweh, whose extensive ruins still hillock the soil for miles around. Some hindoo looking Temples still stand on the outskirts, towards the beach; with their acorn shaped domes of spiral brick or stone work, and with their invariable accom paniments of two or three Banyan trees, the only ones to be found in the country. The architecture of these temples, and of their neighbouring wells, seems still to tell of a time, when Kafirs, whether Hindoos (as tradition asserts) or others, flourished on this plain. Ferhaps, from that Fort of Grai, the wealth of the lowest layer of debris in yonder mounds, the earliest Geramha, was exchanged with that coming from Edom or Chaldea, through the earliest Geranhensis near the present Grane or Koweit. It has happened to me to wonder over the traces of many ancient cities. But no re-iteration of the scene ever mitigates the solemnity of its reflection or the gloom of its forebodings. Whatever may have been the histories of their rise and fall, one feels, in digging down these strata of silent homes, that they formed, not one city, but successive cities; each leaving a con glomerate of what it used, as its only record; each showing that man had come of age, ere history began; and one and all revealing as from the grave, the common doom of human power, on earth.8 43. To the South of the Geramha ruins, lies the bed of a once abundant river, the Kuleel. It passed close under the walls of the city, with Fort Teesko, seemingly an old citadel, on its northern side. A massive gateway stood on the southern bank. The channel of the Kvileel is now a saltwater creek. An earth- quake changed the course of the fresh water stream at its source. And its dry or salty bed still explains the cause of the ancient prosperity, and present com parative desolation of the Genaweh plain. I picked up some spirally grooved cylinders* of baked clay. Tradition says they were what the Kafirs hurled from leathern slings, when Geramha was attacked. It is possible, war may, as usual, have aided time and nature, in destroying art. The quickest destroyer of men, is man. 44. Bunder Reigh is very inferior in size and importance to Deelum. It imports only for its own wants; and'for those of its neighbourhood. It is not a port for any route to the interior. Its trade may be somewhat as below:— Exports. Wheat and Barley 20,000 Krans worth. 'W^ool 10,000 Ditto. Imports. 100 Karehs of Dates and Piece goods to the value of 10,000 Krans; also a few miscellaneous articles for home consumption. The gross of the Customs may be 10,000 Krans. 45. To the South of Bunder Reigh, and immediately North of Bushire creek, lies a flat, corn-growing circle of some ten Arab villages, known as liohilla indeed, it may be remarked that, coming southward from the Chaab territories, the plain, there wholly pastoral, becomes gradually patched with corn, until, towards Eohilla, large breadths are found under the plough. A fresh waterstream, fordable only in one or two places, runs through this district which, none the less, depends solely on rain. It is traditioned that, this Rood-hulla, or Hulla river, received a portion of the waters, turned by the earthquake, from the Kuleel river of Genaweh: the remainder of that stream having burst northward, towards Behbehan; and found exits in the Hindeean (Ah Sheereen); in an affluent ol that river meeting it near Zeitoon, and in the southermost tributary of the Gerahee. 46. Sheaf, a small Port on the northern shore of the Bushire creek, is a sea outlet for Rohilla produce; and is distant only some 3 miles from the nearest hamlet in this circle. The cornj of these districts, being dependent upon uncertain and scant rain fall, is sparely sown, broad cast; and carelessly ploughed in with the old scratch. But there is little doubt that, under proper management of water, and free of restriction and unequal taxation, the country around the Bushire creek, might export corn and cotton to a considerable quantity. 47. I come now to Bushire itself. And as this is the principal Port in the Gulf, I append the least erroneous, and most detailed statements I have been enabled to collect, of its export and import trade; drawn up with care and dili gence, by Mr. James Edwards, the Head Accountant in this Presidency. These statements^ may form a rough index to the general character of the trade of the | These districts rear a good half-bred diseription of horse, half Persian, half Arab. ^ They pass currently under the general name of the Chaab Arab horse. The principal defects of this half-breed are found in a small arm, and falling off of the hind quarter. They are better roadstirs than the pure Arab. But they lack his quietness, intelligence and endurance. By recrossing the Eohilla Chaab with a pure Arab it is found that a good looking and serviceable horse of large bone and height is obtained. But on the whole no cross is a satisfactory animal. And he is never so gentlemanly whether in manners or appearance as the real Hamadanee Saglair, Khaltan, or Anezee. 1 These Statements have been framed by taking the opinions and estimates of several Native traders, upon the details of trade at the Ports, and concerning the articles in which they were severally interested. These estimates have then been reviewed by an intelligent and experienced member of a long es tablished European Firm; and subsequently considered by the Head Accountant. I consider that though not exact, they are sufficiently near approximations to correctness to prove serviceable guides. * Called Gopals. They are picked up in other places along the Coast.9 remaining Ports in. these waters. But not only are similar statements not avail able for those other Ports, bnt it is probable that, if procured, their submission might only tend to mislead. For the articles which would appear as imports by large craft, at one Port, might again appear as exports from this same place, and as imports again at some other point. And the data do not exist for analyzing these complications, and presenting a complete statement of the trade in the Persian Gulf, considered as a whole. 48.

For the revenue system throughout is one of farming, the terms of the annual contracts remaining a constant quantity; while it is only the douceur that varies. 51. The revenues of the Bushire government then are farmed* for a gross amount of some 30,000 Tomans, of which 15,000 Tomans may represent the Cus toms ; and the balance octroi receipts, andlandand poletax from the tribes and villagers. 52. Suppose the Governor to clear 10,000 Tomans on the year, and 5,000 Tomans more to stick to the fingers of undeiiings. Take the low rate of 5 per cent (being that of the most favored Foreign nation) as an average custom due on both exports and imports; and the gross value of the entire trade of Bushire, so estimated, would amount to Tomans 900,000 or about £4,50,000 Sterling. 53. Trade reaches Bushire from Batavia, Mauritius and in part from India, in square rigged vessels. But perhaps the bulk of the Indian trade comes in native Craft, of from 100 to 200 and 300 Tons burthen. 54. A small portion of the Imports are subsequently re-exported to other Gulf Ports in a smaller class of seagoing native craft. But the large bulk of it, finds its way into the interior of Persia by mule caravan. After reaching Shiraz, it divides: a part passing to Yezd; and the remainder to Ispahan, with a sprin klin g round these cities. 55. A caravan shows large; but there may be a good deal of bell-tinkling under the pony's neck, without much wool or cotton on the mules' backs. It would take some 3,000 mules to carry off the cargo of a small vessel of 500 Tons. And it is probable that, a year's traffic, along a well frequented Persian road, might be stowed away in the shipping of an average London yard. The imaginative mind of Persia attributes to this her almost sole sea-port, an im- comparable commerce. But the commonplace sense of an Englishman weighs upon the facts of the terms of the farm from a Government not celebrated * N ote —One of the consequences of this system of farming is that the Agriculturalist is called on for a much larger rent than the State receives from him. e. g. A. farms a Governorship from the Shah, for an amount B + C the douceur. A in turn farms his circles of villages: of which D. takes one circle. D. again sublets a hamlet or one of his villages to E., who deputes F. to collect the rents. Each of course expects a profit on his contract. And consequently the Agriculturalist instead of having to pay the amount which benefits the State B., is called on for his share of B + C. ( + D + E's + P's profits). He cannot pay. P. complains to E. and E. to A., who is dunned for his contract sum from the capital. A gives to his sub-fanners permission to collect revenue by force. This is done. Next year some of the peasants are fled, some of the land is lying waste. The country, in brief, is revenued, as if the Government were to end, with the expiry of the Governors lease.11 for generosity; of the paucity of square rigged vessels in the roads, there is at this moment not one of the straggling in from time to time of a single Bombay Bngla, three parts in ballast, having dropped the bulk of her cargo at Abbass or Lingah; of the closing of the native craft trade with India, during the South-West Monsoon; of Bushire being a town containing some 10,000 inhabitants only; of the paucity of fodder and supplies along the Shiraz road; of the smallness of the caravans, numbering from 50 to 60 mules, and finally on the fact that when Bunder Abbass was blockaded a few years ago, and its trade thrown for the moment along the Bushire road, the price of carriage at Bushire to Sheraz, a distance of some 180 miles, rose from 15 or 17 Krans per mule to 80 Krans.* 56. The physical disadvantages of Bushire as a Port, are considerable. It is a roadstead, only partially protected against the prevailing winds from the north west. The anchorage is 4 miles from the landing place. Communication with shipping by boats is always slow, either to or from the Bunder; and is sometimes wholly cut off for days together, during a strong north-wester. 57. The Port enjoys a management differing from ours. Boats cannot go off after sunset, nor move to land cargo until the manifest has been seen by the Governor.f English trade is rated, under Treaty, in and out, at 5 per cent, with out further inland demand. But native trade loses on the import, as compared with ours; and, perhaps, in some articles, gains on the export; e. on exporta tion of corn. Twice, since I arrived in the Gulf, now four months ago, the export of corn has been interdicted, and an English Barque, for which corn had been stored, when no prohibition existed, and, which, for the lading of this corn, had foregone a cargo of dates a,t Busreh, was obliged, a few weeks past, to purchase stone ballast at Bushire, and proceed in ballast to England, owing to a sudden local interdict on corn. In one instance, the Governor relaxed the interdict, out of friendly feeling towards me. I am sensible of the kindness. But trade cannot thrive under considerations of personality or arbitrary interference. A British merchant assured me that the prosperity of English trade at Bushire, hinged much on the terms subsisting between the Resident and the Persian authorities. Again, a flight of locusts, or absence of rain is sufficient cause for a sudden Corn Law. Douceurs, &amp;c. are said to be almost essential to the conduct of trade at all. The Governments of countries are probably as good as the governed deserve. But it is none the less true, that, among the principal difficulties in the development of the Persian Gulf trade, must be numbered that resulting from the action of Go vernmental authority. It is just, however, to add that since the foregoing was written, the Shah has disapproved his Governor's interdict. 58. Some few years ago, 6 to 7 squarerigged vessels came from Mauritius annually, in ballast, and ran back, corn. This trade has ceased, or turned to wards Kurrachee: owing, as I am assured, to the vexations it suffered in the Gult. 59. The Cotton trade at Bushire has, as elsewhere, received a considerable impetus by the American Civil War. 60,000 Tabreez maunds (7^ Iks. each) have been shipped, and it is said that, during the coming season, ten times that quantity may be thrown on the market. Prices rose so high that it would have paid to bring Cotton from Tabreez some 12 or 13 hundred miles on mules, and export it at Bushire. Persia can grow Cotton from Tabreez West, to Meshed East, and southward to the Cotton fields of Reshire, four miles from Bushire. These latter * Note .—Of course carriage at Bushire being adjusted to its average trade, any sudden influx of extraneous goods would have temporarily raised the rates of carriage to an arbitrary maximum. ^ Still, the distance to Shiraz being so short, and the rise so enormous in rate, tend to show that the Bushire trade cannot bear those calls, which really large trade usually can sustain without ruinous effects. f The landing of goods and the embarkation of goods at Bushire are a monopoly in the hands of a man called a Hamal Bashee. He farms this business and no person other than he is allowed to land or embark goods. _ . . t&gt; t&gt; It is true that it would be open to an iMiglish mercha.nt to introduce his own cargo Boats. But then he must also have his own Boatmen; and these, not Persian subjects, otherwise they might bo interfered with. . In my opinion any steamer line in the Gulf Trade sliould render itself wholly independent O a the shore, for the landing and embarkation of its goods. /'Wr. 1 '-Mi i|i -—'4' 12 returned good crops, until changes in taxation, stopped the sowing, and the culti vators decreased in numbers. 60. The Sugar trade with Java has increased during the past 20 years from 5,000 Peculs (17 Tabreez maunds each) to 50,000 Peculs. This sugar drives those of Mysore, Bengal, Mauritius, and Siam, out of the market. The Refiners find that the Java sugar yields a larger quantity of loaf sugar per maund, than the other sugars. 61. A considerable trade in Opium has sprung up of late years with Yezd; and I believe also Ghayn. Their light yellow colored stick Opium, when unadul terated, is of excellent quality. Accounts ditFer as to the place it now occupies in the market: one of the China Journals asserting that excessive adulteration had destroyed its chance in that country. While, here, it is asserted that, large quantities still reach China, via Batavia, and Singapoor. 62. The export of wool to the quantity of 1,00,000 Tabreez maunds is, I think, inconsiderable, as compared with what might take place. Some of the wool is imported at Bushire, in the first instance, from other and minor Ports. But I surmise that, if a regular demand were made known round the Gulf, and payment duly secured, a great development might be given to this trade. 63. Saltpetre brought in small quantities from Lar does not pay. It would have a better chance perhaps if manufactured at Kishm or Ormuz, or some other point on the sea board. 64. As to the route from Bushire inland, it is rugged, stony, mountainous, Via the Dulikee Pass, Kazroon, to Shiraz; but less so along the plateau to Ispahan and thence to the point where and Tehran: a mule load of 340 lbs, or so may cost trade diverges, Shiraz. about 5 Tomans, or a little less, in carriage, from Bushire to Tehran. 65. Moving southward from Bushire you pass along a series of small coast Congoon, Asseeloo, Nabend, villages, or insignificant Ports lying amid a skirting of Kakheeloo, Cheroo, Khelat, Char- date trees, and immediately below a precipitous rack, and Mogoo. range of barren mountains, which seen from a vessel's deck, seem to rise sheer out of the water, untrodden by human foot. Among these villages, Congoon was, at one time, a busy little place; but the Dashtee tribe, whose sea frontage is near, wasted and ruined it. 66. At length you come to Lingah, the Port next in importance to Bushire, That is of Ports, ethnological- of the 2nd Class, as now considered. The general ly Arab; but considered under character of the commerce of these two Ports is simi- &lt; ~ !ass _ lar; that of Lingah, of course, being far less in extent, and smaller in variety. Its recent condition has been unusually prosperous. But the history of its rise is instructive. Comparatively a few years ago, it was almost unknown; and was farmed for 100 Tomans per annum, under the local Government of Lar. The farm subsequently rose to 200 Tomans. Presently the Sheikh of Lingah chanced to have a quarrel with the Sheikh of Abbass. The latter exposed the lightness of the demand made by government against Lingah, as compared with that made elsewhere. The trade of Lingah was enquired into; and the annual contract raised to 2,000 Tomans. The increase of trade then slackened. It may at present have a trade equivalent to about one* fourth that * I suspect its ot Bushire, The principal attractions of the place are that goods can be dropped trac ' e is more than there more quietly than at Bushire; and with less interference and cost. They one f ourt has large. can then sometimes find their way through the dilapidated walls of Shiraz without a second demand; while a caravan coming from Bushire, is 2;enerally advertized to the authorities at Shiraz, 67. But Lingah, in point of position and lines of road to the interior, is less favorably situated, perhaps, than any other Port. The route to Shiraz is arduous, ill-supplied, and unsafe. It is probable, its commerce, as compared with (hat of other Ports, would rather decrease than otherwise, under a thorough development of the Gulf trade. 68. Apart however from its landwards trade, Lingah enjoys a sea carrying3 1° o S trade.

I pass southward to the 3rd Class of territories; among these the Bunder Abbass with its adjacent districts northward to a P™cipal Port is Bunder Abbass. point near Lingah, and southwards to a tract, whose The trade of this Port is Vari- political jurisdiction is not determined under Treaty en- ouslv estimated All irhnit if r Isl ' d »» t&gt;i thriving.

T]ie means for collecting any detailed account of the trade of Bunder Ab jass aie not at my disposal: this Port being temporarily farmed bv Muscat and thus excluded the region of communication with this Pesidency. It is how- ever, the principal Port of entry for piece goods into Persia. It imports also coiree, tea, sugar, spices and miscellaneous goods. Among its exports are wool and fruit; the latter drawn from a fertile district a little inland. -P* ^J iav ? noticed that Bunder Abbass has been somewhat decried as a Port • but I am of opinion that it is the point where trade coming to and fro avast area of southern Central Asia, naturally meets the sea. At present its trade is said to be m a partially abnormal condition, owing to its following a route which if Bushire were less interfered with, would not fall to Abbass. For instance' Bunder Aboass, in some decree, supplies the Shiraz market; and this although the road thither is twice as long as from that Town to Bushire, besides being kss safe. In its normal condition, perhaps, the proper sphere of Bunder Abbass''trade would be along the lezd and Kerman routes to points found along a line extendina: from Furrah through Herat, Ghayn, Tong, Tubbus, Meshed Nishepoor, and so to 1 eheran. The Bunder Abbass trade should, in brief, be a central one; meetim- the iVurrachee trade via Candahar, on its eastern flank; the Russian trade of the Oxus and Caspian, on its north; and the Tabreez and Bushire trade on its western siae. -Uo doubt, a large area in the region thus described, is, at present, comparatively desert; while those portions of it known politically, such, for instance, as the States of Herat, Khion, and Bokhara are poor consum ers, btnl, tne total area to be supplied is so extensive, that even an infinitessimally small trade per 10 square miles would endow Bunder Abbass with a rich com merce. Moreover, some of the States referred to, were once comparatively ,u'a tii\ , and still contain the soil, the positions, and the men, for becoming so again, i ofiticai circumstances, and the slow permeation of thought through those regions, may, any day, give them an impulse, as welcome in the commercial, as it may prove startling in the political world. I chanced, some little time ago, to read the istory of (xenghis Khan, with an Heratee, who formerly administered the IIIvat districts of that principality. I asked him how it was no Genghis arose now, o leoeem his country? He replied, 'We possess too many of them. In old nnes men were beasts of burthen. A.

To return: as illustrative of the manner in which trade meets, competes, and finds its level at points along the line towards which that of Bunder Abbass naturally flows, I may mention that when I was at Herat in 1860-61,1 found piece goods from the Teheran and Candahar lines, bearing their respective English and Russian marks, competing on the same counter, in the Herat Bazaar; and their respective qualities severely criticized by the Traders. They seemed, on the whole, to prefer the Teheran goods, but those from India were cheaper. True, it was surmised that, the Teheran goods came originally, in greatest part, from England. Again, I found Russian brick tea, meeting tea from all other quarters; and commanding the highest price as the best in the Market. The retailers told me, Kurrachee tea was driving a hard bargain with others to maintain their ground; but the retailers added that some tea had. arrived from Kurrachee, during the preceding year, not in boxes like the Bombay tea, but in small packets, and that this latter was so execrable, as to have injured the general repute of Kurrachee borne teas. I was puzzled at the moment to distinguish the tea in question, but it was practically explained to me on subsequent arrival at Kurrachee, that tea was brought to Sind in packets, for the use of troops and others; that this tea, after being drunk by the Soldiers, was recollected, dried, and repacked, in the old packets, by the barrack boys; and then sold in the Kurrachee Bazar for a mere song, to be exported via the Candahar line. Again, I found some stick Opium of excellent quality from Ghayn, and on showing it at Bombay, attention was drawn to the circumstance via the Gulf, and a considerable trade from the Ghayn direction has since sprung up. I was struck all along the route of North Persia with the unvarying presence of the Russian lumbersome tea-urn (Samawar) brought from the great Fairs beyond the Caspian; would it not be possible to bring into competition with it a lighter, handier article ? 73. That Bunder Abbass is situate in a position, favorable for trade, is, in some degree to be inferred from the history of the neighbouring island of Ormuz. Xo island could possibly look more unpromising. It is, in brief, a confused looking mass of spongy earth mounds, and saline efflorescence. Yet, under European management, in times gone by, it was described as follows: 'Instamond in his history of the East Indies says:—At the mouth of the Strait of Mocandon, which leads into the Persian Gulf, lies the island of Gombroon. In the eleventh century an Arabian conqueror built upon this barren rock the city of Ormuz, which afterwards became the capital of an empire, comprehending a considerable portion of Arabia on one side, and of Persia on the other. Ormuz had two good harbours, and was large and well fortified; its riches, and strength were entirely owing to its situation. It was the centre of trade between Persia and the Indies, which was very considerable, if we remember that the Persians at that time caused the greatest part of the merchandize of Asia to be conveyed to Europe from the ports of Syria and Caffa. At the time of the arrival of the Foreign merchants, Ormuz afforded a more splendid and agreeable scene than any city in the East. Persons from all parts of the Globe exchanged their commodities, and transacted their business with an air of politeness and attention, which are seldom seen in other places of trade. u These manners were introduced by the merchants belonging to the ports, who induced Foreigners to imitate their affability. Their address, the regularity of their police, and the variety of entertainments which their city afforded, joined to the interests of commerce, invited merchants to make it a 'place of resort. Hie pavement of the streets was covered with mats, and in some places with carpets; and the linen awnings which were suspended from the tops of houses prevented any inconvenience from the heat of the sun. Indian cabinets orna mented with gilded vases, or China filled with flowering shrubs or aromatic plants, adorned their apartments; camels, laden with water, were stationed in the public squares; Persian wines, perfumes, and all the delicacies of the table were furnished in the greatest abundance; and thev had the music of the East in its15 highest perfection. In sliort, universal opulence and extensive commerce, a refined luxurv, politeness in the men, and gallantry in the women, united all their attractions to make this city the seat of pleasure. ' An English traveller, Ralph Filch, who visited this island, describes it thus:'— ' Ormuz is an island in circuit about five and twenty or thirty miles, and is the driest island in the World, for there is nothing growing on it, but only salt; for the water, wood, or victuals, and all things necessary, come out of Persia, which is about twelve miles from thence. All thereabout is very fruitful, from whence all kinds of victuals are sent into Ormuz. The Portuguese have a castle here which standeth near unto the sea, wherein there is a Captain for the king of Portugal, having under him a convenient number of soldiers, whereof some part remain in the castle, and some in the town. In this town are merchants of all nations, and many Moors and Gentiles. There is a very great trade of all sorts of spices, drugs, silk, cloth of silk, fine tapestry of Persia, great store of pearls, which come from the isle of Bahrein, and are the best pearls of all others, and many horses of Persia, which serve all India.' 74. That the island instead of the present Port, was, at that time, made the entrepot, was due probably to the circumstance that, a foreign settlement of merchants preferred to sustain the cost of a double landing-and shipment, rather than run the risk to property and person, incident to a residence on the main land. 75. When, however. Shah Abbas, a Sovereign, whose Serais for the accom modation of trade, are among the noblest and most enduring architectural struc tures in Persia, turned his keen commercial eye towards the Gulf; he put his finger on its entrance; preferred the mainland to the island; established a Port; and gave it his own name. It is possible we may have put a finger down too. 76. As to the Customs of Bunder Abbass, they are lumped in the farm with its inland revenues for 16,000 Tomans per annum; of which 10,000 may represent Customs. The farm has some thirteen years yet to run, and the terms of the Treaty including it, are hostile to the intrusion of foreigners; and afford Persia consiclerable room for interference. The Sultan of Muscat in turn farms both the Muscat and Abbass Customs to a Bunya for 95,000 Tomans; of which, perhaps, 20,000 Tomans may represent Abbass dues; but on the whole the trade of the Muscat State is in a partially transition condition, owing to the division of the Imaumship into the two separate Sultanuts of Zanzibar and Muscat, under the arbi- trement of the late Earl Canning. The web and woof of the home trade is, of course, for the moment, rent asunder; and commerce takes time to re-adjust itself along new groves, under altered circumstances. 77. The small town of Kishm, on the southern end of the island of that name, is another Port, farmed from Persia by Muscat. Its principal export is salt, which it sends eastwards. Its imports are mainly for consumption on the island. Perhaps a sulphur and saltpetre trade might succeed at Kishm. 78. The islet of Angaum, on the sea-side of Kishm, might be a convenient point for a coal depdt. The Sound is always calm on one side, with a channel of 6 or 7 fathoms; but it should be borne in mind that, this islet, like Kishm itself, may revert to Persia a few years hence; and that Persia is jealous of any footing whatsoever being gained on her territory by an European. 79. My suggestion is, that, in developing the trade of the Persian Gulf, we keep as free as may be convenient of dependence upon foreign States. I believe we can do so whether Ave regard our trade, our Telegraph, or our coal stations. 80. Before crossing to the other side of the Gulf, it may be well to turn a general glance over Persian trade, considered as a whole; and as it may be expec ted to develop. 81. The greatest consumers in Persia, area for area, are to be found within an obtuse angled triangle, of which a line drawn from Tabreez on the West, along the southern shore of the Caspian to Meshed on the East, would form the base ; and of which lines drawn from Meshed and Tabreez respectively, to Ispahan,* I 16 would form the other two sides. Now trade must reach these consumers nl one or more of the following routes: Isf. Via Turkish Armenia from Trebizond to Tahreez. 'Ind. Via the Russian Caucassian Provinces from Poti to Tabreez. ord. From the line of the Volga across the Caspian to Resht or Asterabad. Ath. From Kurrachee via the Candahar line to Furrah; and tlience either through Herat to Meshed, or through Ghayn to the Mshapoor portion of the Teheran road. bth. From Bunder Abbass through Yezd or Kerman. Qth. From Bushire via Shiraz; and thence through Ispahan or Yezd. 1th. From some Port on the Persian Gulf other than Bushire and Bunder Abbass, or. %th. Along some line between the head of the Gulf and Baghdad, and thence continuing either into the plateau of Persia via Kermanshah, or Sinister, or else keeping northward through the Kurds. 82. But trade coming by the first route has to meet the Turkish Custom Houses; to traverse 500 miles of mountainous country, sometimes impassable from snow, and oftener unsafe from plunderers until it reach Tabreez. It has then to meet the Persian Customs, anci n sent on to JLeheran to make another land journev of 700 miles; or if to Ispahan of 800 or more. If finally it go on to Meshed it has a further land route of 800 miles along a frontier road, scant of water and supplies, and broken in upon by the Turcomans of the Attruk and Goorgan. ^ 83.^ If trade come via Georgia, it has the Russian duties to pay; many difficulties '*' i ^ from Poti to Ivhoi; then to meet the Persian Customs at Tabrecz; and so on, as above detailed. Ii it debouche on the Caspian at Lenkeian, it has re-shipment, re-landing, and the tropical, unroaded provinces of Ghelan or Mazanderan to traverse, before it ascends the Ghats to Casween, or debouches on the Meshed road, at Bostan. 84. The Volga line, though enjoying lengthened water carriage, has also to bear a long landjourney to meet Custom houses; repeated re-shipments some times the cost of steam transit, and eventually to land at Resht or Asterabad, and proceed as above described. 85. If traue come from Kurrachee it must pass up either Sind or Beloochis- tan to the Afghan Frontier, near Shawl, a distance of some 500 miles; a road singularly rocky and mountainous if by Beloochistan, and involving the Bolan pass if by Sind. From Shawl it has a journey of 200 miles nearly to Candahar, and of 300 miles on to Furrah, subjected en route to Afghan interference and dues. At Furrah it must diverge either 200 miles to Herat or 400 or 500 miles to the Teheian load; and in either case to traverse a wild region, where the Borderers of lAisia, Seistan, Afghanistan, and Herat meet on their conterminous frontiers. Irom Herat to Meshed 200 miles it must travel along a Border tramped and desolated by the Saloor, Sarookh and Tekkee Turcomans of the Moorghab and Merve. These plunderers have already carried into slavery, the men, women, and children, of hundreds of villages along this line; and those villages still lie waste and tenantless. From Meshed and the Xeshapoor point the route is as before noticed. 86. For trade to proceed from any point on the Gulf other than Bushire or Bunder Abbass would involve the opening up of a new line, along a route more arduous, less safe, and not shorter; and the same remark would apply to the Sinister line. 87. As to Baghdad, it seems at first glance to possess some advantages in that trade could reach the triangle sought by shortening its land and leno-th- ening its water transit. But merchants object, that this route would involve sailing seagoing craft up to Busreh; of their running the gauntlet of the Turkish Custom houses; of changing to river craft; breaking bulk; and of eventually having to cross an unsafe tract between Baghdad and Kermanshah; there meeting the Persian duties. Hence, this line is not availed of unless for the trade of the A * The direct road to the Fort of Herat leaves the Fort cf Furrah to its left, and passes by Geianeh. $17 S * 1 went half way down the Moolla Pass, but I did not meet any traffic there.

But am ill-acquainted with tins line; although I find among my recollections a passing visit, that the walls of Baghdad appeared to have been built for a bigger city, and that there were few trading craft on the IVris. a - Similar remarks would apply with increased force to any route runnino- JNorth from Baghdad towards the Kurds. 0 89. If to the foregoing glance along these routes, I might add a fact or two, orawn from personal observation, I would remark that, I met comparatively little traffic between I rebezond and Tabreez; although Tabreez itself seemed a considerable commercial town, with well-cultivated environs. The road from iabreez to Teheran was as unfrequented, until one arrived at Casween, the nearest town of any importance to the Capital. Between Teheran and Meshed I met very few caravans; and they were principally engaged in carrying dead bodies, or pilgiims fiom Bokhara and Meshed to Kurbella, iN'cjd, and Mecca; or in carryino' pilgrims eastwards to the Shrine at Meshed. From Meshed to Herat and from Herat through Furrah to Ghiriskh on the Helmund, I did not meet a single Kafla; although I came on the track of one, which was utterly destroyed next morning ;near Laush Jowain, and although I met at the Kohi Doozdan on the Kash Eood, the Seistanees, who had a night or two before smitten the only Ivafla they had been able to fall in with. 90. Between Candahar, Quetta, Khelat, and the head of the Bolan, I met now and then a string of camels ;* but I found between Khozdar and Kurrachee, a larger bulk of goods on camels than I had met along the entire route from Meshed to Khozdar; I might perhaps add from even Teheran to Khozdar. I fling these facts out, without wishing to strain them into a theory, for determining the proportions of trade along any given distance. And it is possible, had I returned to ieheran, the facts might have been different. 91. I think, however, all circumstances considered that trade, if left free, or even if only moderately harrassed, should be able, when landed at Bunder Abbass, to command the markets of Kerman and Yezd—the latter one of the wealthiest and most enterprising towns in Persia*—that it should further be able to compete with trade coming along any of the lines above enumerated, to Ispahan, Peheran, and Mesned; and then that it should flow along the Tabreez line until overpowered by the conntercurrents of the Russian and Turkish Armenian lines. Bunder Abbass would naturally absorb also any little trade that might be needed for Western Mekran. 92. I think, secondly, that trade without smuggling at Lingah, should command the immediate neighbourhood ofLar, and the'adjacent coast line. 93. Thirdly, that trade landed at Bushire, should command those districts belovy the passes; and also the market of Shiraz and the province of Fars in general. It might compete with other routes as far North as Ispahan, but not I think, at Teheran. Finally it might be able to throw a sprinkling of goods towards Yezd. 94. The advantages of Bunder Abbass as a Port for the supply of the markets under notice, may be compared with those of Bushire, as follows 95. Bunder Abbass is less interfered with by authority. The dues are more moderate, and are levied without needless delay or injury to goods absence of octroi no subsequent governmental demand, unless at Yezd, where it is mo derate, readily levied, and whence trade moves on direct to the Capital; (while trade at Bushire sustains en route not only octroi, but a heavy demand and delay at Shiraz; and a third demand at Ispahan); an easier and more level road; an abundant supply of camels instead of a limited supply of mules: each camel carry- * The principal mercliants at Yezd are Guebres; also some Hindoos, and a few Ispahanees. The Hindoos are from Mooltan. It is remarkable that on the Herat and Bokhara line the Indian traders come^ from Shikarpoor principally. Then towards South Persia from Mooltan. At Zanzibar they arc principally from Kutch and that neighbourhood. At Bushire there is not a single Banyan. The fact is, a Banyan will stand any tyranny, any misery, any thing you please, except 'permanent loss of profits ; when this last calamity arrives, he goes away, as he has done from Bushire.ing 450 lbs. against a mule's 340 lbs, and costing one-third less; avoidance of delay and risk incident to seapassage up the Gulf against the prevailing Xor- Westers. 96. The disadvantages of Bunder Abbass are:— 1^.—That its town and road are considered less safe; but this objec tion is mitigated by the largeness of caravans. An Abbass Kafla may number from 1,000 to 2,000 camels. In Bushire, it is rare to see 100 mules in the same Kafla. 2nd. —That the distance from Bunder Abbass to Teheran Yezd, is longer than that of Bushire from Teheran via Ispahan and Shiraz; but then the Yezd road, as before mentioned, is easier, and less interfered with: hence less delayed. 97. Looking forward to the possible development of Persian and Central Asiatic trade from the Gulf line, I should say that, compared with its area, it must always be small; but that the area for the supply of which the Persian Gulf is the only continuous Ocean line, is so immense, that the trade, naturally seeking its waters would, if not stifled by authority, rapidly increase; and be very considerable, regarded as a whole. The Persian peasant is a frugal, avaricious, trade-seeking man. The climate over the entire area to be served necessitates clothing. I have never met a man without a hat or turban of some sort. The Persian Khula is an article of fashion, and may cost anything from 10 Shillings to £10. The Illyat wears a felt; the Persianized Arab, a holy turban. Every body carries a pair of shoes or sandals on his feet, or in his hands. Trowsers obtain in towns; but are wisely discarded in country, as an impediment to free walking. As to coats they are universal, of the length of the body, and of all colors and descriptions. The Persian usually carries all he possesses on his back; looks cool during his visit; and unpeels seven, eight, or a dozen outer garments, when he gets home. In chinaware, he is a connoisseur; and it is difficult to deceive him. Arms of all sorts are in request; but a double-barrelled over and under pistol, is wisely preferred to a revolver. It is remarkable how long the awkward match or flint-lock holds its ground; and I cannot but think that it is in some degree due to the want of a thorough trial of our modern rifles. They appreciate our fowling-pieces. All this means trade. 98. But the fact is, that in Central Asia as elsewhere if you want to trade especially in the retail or fancy line, you must study fashion. ' If you throw red broad-cloth into a Persian town; or stone-color, black, or sky-color, among the Bedouins, they may remain on hand. Exchange the bales across the Gulf, and they may sell off hand. When I was at Zanzibar, last year, an enterprising Hanseatic merchant hit upon the idea of imitating the famous Muscat turban. He found he could import from Hambro an equally good (in my view better) looking article at a reduced price; but the Arabs and Sowahailee men about town, decided the colors were a little too bright: the article was forthwith gos samer to a beaver. Another gentleman sampled a large pink bead. The only objection possible to it, was, that it did not sell in Uniamesi, among the mountains of the moon. Similar accidents happened in piece goods: a stripe too broad, or a line too little, was sufficient to make the conversative ladies of the Negro races doubt quality; and stick to the original Surat, Broach, or Bengal. 99. In the articles of ghee, cotton, madder-root, opium, and wool, there is room for indefinite extension. It might be possible to create a trade in horns, glue, hides, saltpetre and sulphur. Persia possesses great mineral wealth, and coals, and sooner or later these must come to market. The coal we used at the Teheran Legation was fetched some 10 or 12 miles from near Damawend. It was of good quality, and I am of opinion that similar coal is findable in the hills near Bushire at Gesakoon and Halila Hill. 100. But it is rash to foretell the future of trade, or to prefer one route to another, so long as the arbitrary interferences of authority may, by a stroke of the pen, ruin one line or force another.101. I cross the Gulf to Mussendom. It is on this deeply indented and fantastically outlined cape that the territory ' ass 0 ' • directly under the Sultan of Muscat, lies. A sin gular race of men inhabit the headland, and seem to be an early race, driven by stronger growths of humanity into this remotest corner. They appear as though they had paused here, only because precipiced over the sea. 102. As to the Ports of this Territory, they are of no present commercial value. But, as submitted more in detail, in my Koomzar Kliussub. letters now noted, I am of opinion that the neigh- „ , . , -.on t no™ bourhood of Khussub, at the outer entrance of the No. 1A dated 13th January 1863. t ,, , t i • . ,i No. 2 A dated 2nd February 1863. Elphmstone Inlet, is a convenient point for the No. 6 A dated 16th February 1863. immediate establishment of an English Free Port, under a clear, written, permanent, unquestionable, title to be obtained from our ancient Ally of Muscat; concentrating there our coal and telegraph main stations for the Gulf, together with our Political Residency. Politically and strategically considered, this point might be rendered the key of the Persian Gulf. As a coal depot it affords calm, and good anchorage, and would save colliers the risk, time, and cost of working up and down the Gulf As a Telegraph station, it is on the Elphinstone creek, whose head touches the neck of the promontory at its narrowest part; and after a land passage of some 400 yards, meets the head of a deep water inlet opening on the eastern side of the cape. A trading steamer taking in coal at Khussub, could run to Busreh or Koweit, and back, without filling up. The entrance of the Gulf is the natural terminus for your square-rigged vessels, and trade should be delivered round the Gulf, and up the Busreh river, or Koweit creeks, in suitable native Gulf craft, or steamers. A large bugla can run cheaper than a square-rig, ton for ton, under particular circumstances. For instance, between Bombay and East Africa, they run down with the North East, and return with the first breezes of the South West monsoons. But the argument fails to apply when the length of voyage and the variability of winds, and the intervening of heavy weather, impede, endanger or stop Pattimar sailing. 103. The case of Ormuz is a precedent for a like station. The interfer ences, incertitude, and want of accurate knowledge of the market all round the Gulf, point to the alleviation of these evils, by the creation of a general entrepot, at a convenient point, where all vessels passing near the Gulf, outside, would, if they pleased to call, find cargo ready; whereto all boats finding a favorable chance for exports from their several jurisdictions, could run a cargo, in a few days; and whereto all trade might converge, as circumstances admitted, from Ports sub jected to sudden, but not permanent arbitrary interference. 104. My respectful suggestion to Government is, that the formation of a Port, so concentrating all our interests, would do more to create, and to develop the trade of the Gulf and Busreh line, and would do more to keep the Govern ment accurately informed as to their relations, and the condition of commerce in the Gulf; and would, further, do more to keep the Maritime Arabs quiet, and to afford an issue for whatever capabilities of trade may be possessed by Arabia; than could all the Reports, all the figured Statements, and all the amicable interviews, of all the Residents, and all the Native authorities, that ever had, or may have place, round these waters. 105. But the Port must be really free, and all tribes and people must know and feel it to be free; and that once there, their goods and persons are secure, and unmolested. Let the authorities of the Port limit their functions to keeping the peace, removing obstacles, enforcing valid contracts, and punishing mercantile crime. For the rest, leave all to private enterprise; and leave trade free as the tide to flow in and out. I think that thus only can we practically test the commercial capabilities of the Gulf; perhaps, in no other manner, can trade attain its full and undeformed growth, all round the Globe. 106. The next class of territory to be noticed is that of the independent Maritime Arabs. These tribes yield a tithe to the Ruler of Nejd, whose capital.20 centred at Eias near Daryal i, has an advanced Fort Beymer, astride the North Eastern portion ot Arabia midway between Eas-ul-khyma and the Towns of Musnt And as the Ameer of'Nejd is, himself, a tributary of Turkey, it follows that all the Arab Maritime Chiefs are quasi sub-Feudatories of the Sultan, althouo-h they do not acknowledge his Suzerainty, unless, as on one or two occasions has been the case with Bahrein, it suits their convenience. Bahrein once hoisted in succes sion Turkish, 1 ersian and English flags. It is even added, she has been known to hoist all three at once. 107. These Maritime Tribes are located along the West Coast of the Gulf Eas-nl-Khyma. fiom Eas-ul-khymah to Bahrein, both inclusive. Shargah.

They export dried nsn;^ and import from Malabar, rice, and some teakwood; and from Africa, masts id their boats, (for which a capital kind of wood of great strength and pliability is found iip the Bangany river, on the hill-land of Tangaty, and, I believe further northward, in Usumbarah), cloves of which Zanzibar grows enough for the VVond s consumption; and rice, which was expelled the island of Zanzibar (to legieat improvement of its salubrity) to make room for cloves; but which is s i i giown of good quality on the opposite African mainland. It is worthy of lemark, however, that, although rice may be grown to a practically unlimited ex ent on portions of the Gulf districts, yet, that the Indian rice is imported, and is piefeiied to all others: the explanation seems to be that Indian rice is lighter an swells more in the boiling; hence it is more filling at the price, and takes longer 0 ! &lt; ^ e c S ', a efficiently nutritive substance being granted, the essentials of a poor man s ood are, tne greatest possible bulk, at a minimum cost. Cocoanuts are also roug it to some extent from Zanzibar and Bembeh; but the market for these, and there is a rapidly increasing one, is towards Marseilles and Hambro. It is possible indeed, that cocoanuts may soon replace the clove plantations. At present the rm eaves Zanzibar, m pulp, dried. It is obvious, however, that, if circumstances should favor the expression of the oil on the spot, a larger quantity of oil mi 'li t +i Q + aiov ! n int ° t l ie European markets, from a reduced tonnage. It is surmised that a salad and olive oil of good repute is refined from the Zanzibar cocoanuts. . ien 151 llca suspected the salt-fish trade with Arabia to be a ruse for run- imi^a return cargo of slaves; it is possible some of Her Majesty's Naval Officers still think so. The salt-fish trade is, however, a bonafide one; 'and not only so.21 but, it is, pearls alone excepted, the sole export of these Maritime Arabs. Men must export what tliey can produce and spare, or else they must go without Imports. If men situate like these Arabs do not export salt-fish and pearls, they must either turn pirates, or starve. 111. So long ago as 1823 Captain McLeod reporting on the Joasmee tribe (being then at Ras-ul-khyma and Shargah) described them as possessing ' no articles of export, since their pearls are generally purchased by merchants on the spot, and the produce of their country is not even sufficient for their maintenance. Iheir only employment is fishing, diving for pearls and importing dates, grain and other necessaries of life, which they purchase with the price of those pearls. 1 heir dates are chiefly brought from Bahrein and Busreh; grain and cloth from Muscat and the Persian Ports. They are very poor, and, perhaps can never find much employment in commerce unless in carrying for others, although it is said they at one time possessed a very extensive trade. The Joasmees procure all their materials for building, as well as their warlike stores from Muscat, Bahrein and the Persian Ports in the lower part of the Gulf.' 112. Colonel Kemball writing in 1845, remarked:— ' Upon the success of the Pearl fishing, and the profits of the carrying trade, which it brings into operation, must depend the means of obtaining the positive necessaries of life, and those trifling luxuries desirable to an Arab. It is needless to observe how materially their own condition, and by an easily deduced corollary, the safety of the Gulf, might be affected by the failure of a single season.' Hence ' the anxiety and care attended with great expense which has been devoted' by our Government ' to the maintenance of perfect tranquillity and security on the Pearl banks.' 113. The Maritime resources of the Arab (or Piratical) Ports are stated to be as follows:—■ Poets. Buglas engaged in the Indian and Afri can trades. Their ton nage in morahs.

The amount, too, fluctuates each season, at the will of the Sheikh. 114. The population varies in these towns; and the frequent convulsions sustained by society have precluded any permanent increase. The Ports of 6Abootliabee, Shargali and Ras-ul-ldiyma may contain 3,000 households. Those of Amulgavine, Ejman, Debaye 1200 or so; the lesser settlements at Khan, Heyrah, Fasht 600. I append for more detailed information, as to resources, a statement of the number of inhabitants, vessels, houses and datetrees of the Joasmees. 115. But the richest of the Maritime Arab States, is Bahrein; which island is, in part, fertile, and well watered. It is also singularly picturesque for this unfinished part of the world. The Sheikhs of Bahrein enjoy a revenue of some two lacs of rupees levied on the land, or on boats engaged in the Pearl fishery, whither this State may send some 1200 boats annually. The gross trade may be 28 lacs of rupees, dependant principally on pearls. ISTo Custom dues are levied; but society has suffered many convulsions to the retardment and even falling off of population. The principal exports are pearls, dried-fruits and dates. About 3,50,000 Crowns worth of pearls are annually collected by craft belonging to Bahrein; and something more than this quantity is brought from other part of the Gulf for sale. The imports are mainly from India: rice, cotton, piece-goods, and spices. Of these, one fourth may be consumed in Bahrein; and the remain der be re-exported to other Ports, in the Gulf. 116.

Forty miles to the northward of Bahrein commence the Ports of the 5th class namely, those acknowledging Suzerainty of Turkey; but practically independent. Kateef the first of these, is the Port of the Wahabee Ruler or more strictly of the Nejd Arabs, whose chief town of Rais, near Durayah, lies 11 days march westward, in the interior of Arabia. The present ruler of Neid is the Ameer rysul, highly reputed for his stern, effective, and just authority. Ivateef, however, is considered unhealthy; and is not frequented by the Arabs coming down for exchange towards the coast. These stop at Lahsa, distant some ten fursacs from Kateef, and rather inland. Lahsa itself is healthy, and produces a large quantity of dates, stated to be equal in quality with those of Busreh. Few dates, however, find their way to the sea; unless for a small portion sent to Bahrein, which is distant from Ojair the old, but now abandoned Port of Lahsa, only 14 miles. 118. It is this Nejd power, occupying the wide centre of Adnan Arabia, and composed of Komadie or only partially stationary Arab tribes; some now in revolt, and some now used for quelling revolt, that threatens or dominates all round the shore line from the back of the Euphrates and Shat-ul-Arab, down along the pirate coast above described, and thence round Cape Mussendom along Muscat, Oman, to Ras-ul-Had, on the Aden line. 119. It was a Cazee or Moollah of Busreh, named Wahab who, (or whose son) permeating these tribes with the metamorphic agency of a religious idea, fused them into an aggressive mass, which cropping out along the shore lines of Muscat, and the western coast of the Persian Gulf, compelled all these subdued tribes into plunder and piracy. Hence the once notorious appearance of the maritime Arabs as pirates; hence our expeditions to the West coast of the Gulf ;and hence the Ras-ul-khymas and Beni-Boo-Alis, blending with our colors. An Arab Sheikh endeavoured to explain to me the nature of this unenduring Wahabee power, by likening it to the agency of Lord Clive, in conquering India with a sepoy army. The leading tenets of Wahab's faith seem to have been those common to Prophets, to proclaim himself and the Unity of the Creator, and kill or plunder his immortal creatures. 120. I confess that during my recent journey to Koweit, I was much im pressed by the Arab character: I found in it, an applombe, sound sense, thought- Exports.

It is remark able, however, that in no country in the world is the brute creation so much the friend of man; in no country is there thatmutual confidence between man and beast; nowhere else that I have passed, does the horse, and even the greyhound seem so thoroughly to comprehend language addressed to them by man. 122. I crossed the desert, when it was in blossom; in the spring. The plain had recently been trampled by the feet of Bedouin Camps, where every man's hand is against his neighbour. Yet even the birds seemed to welcome me. The lark, rising trustfully, just in front of my bridle, startled the solemn silence of the desert with its happy song, and again breasting earth, all was still. Anon, a little lady of the Finch tribe, would trip along, beside me; evidently quite glad of a chance for prettily chirping the news: pity, I could not make out what she said. 123. Meeting these Arabs, you readily comprehend how they once stormed across the world; and you leave them, persuaded that they still possess qualities which may again render them renowned, should outward circumstances favor. I could well understand how the tragic pastoral of Job was written by an Arab. The originals of the Patriarchs were before you: their life; their manners and the results of these. I thought to myself these Pentateuch people carry out the prin ciple of simplicity in its integrity; yet I felt, also, that our present civilizations, may have to return? in part, to natural sources, before humanity can progress towards perfection. 124. I left the Arabs, impressed that, their vices and their virtues; their customs; their manners and their government have been, in a great degree, form ed by physical and accidental circumstances. A man who finds himself doomed to live in the Bedouin desert cannot render his life similar to that of a man born of the same original stock, who finds himself among the natural bounties of Arabia Felix. Perhaps the names of Adnan and Khaitan, of the earliest recorded times were only impersonations of the tribes who wandered for pasturage in the open, and of the tribes who had settled down to agriculture on some favored spot. Both would naturally trace their origin to some one Head; and this Head would receive a name, as well as Adam. On the whole, the Arabs, like most other people I have met, seem to cut their coat very much according to their cloth. Ubi homines sunt, modi sunt; and as soil is, so the mind of man. 125. I beg pardon for this seeming digression; but it is, I think, of importance, from a commercial point of view, to bear the character and country of these Arabs, in mind. A tract w T hose people can suddenly appear in force on the lines of the Red Sea, Persian Gulf and Euphrates, must be sufficiently numerous, and possess qualities to affect markets, along those lines for good or for ill. A country that possesses so many articles of commerce, unequalled in their kind, may create an increased demand and supply in the general markets under Euro pean management. The Arabian, and perhaps other portions of the Gulf coast line, may be capable of supplying at a profit, hides, horns, glue, saltpetre, wool.* 0 1T 126.

The next Port falling under the class of those recognising Turkish Suzerainty, but practically independent, is Koweit; and the history of this settle ment is, in my opinion, so illustrative of what may be done in the Gulf by common sense applied to the creation of trade, that I shall venture to occupy a moment of the Government time with a brief summary of its history, as jotted down in my24 Diary, during my recent journey, from tlie lips of the present Chief and other Sheikhs of Koweit. 128. The family of the present Sheikh, have ruled at Koweit, some five generations or about 250 years; for, as these men live to the good old age of 120 years, their generations are, of course, nearly double ours; or about 50 years each. Originally, the Sheikh's progenitors dwelt in a small Fort called Moom- gussur; situate at the head of the Kore Abdullah, near Bunder Zobier. They were the pirates of the North of the Persian Gulf and lower channels of the Shat-ul-Arab. But about 250 years ago, the Busreh authorities attacked and expelled them. The original Sheikh then came down the Boobian creek with his followers, and debouched on the bay, at present known as that of Koweit or Grane. Crossing the bay, he settled on its southern shore; and there erected a Fort or Khote: hence the name Khote, or Koweit. The term Grane, is rather applied to the shore line of the entire Bay; from its resemblance to the curve formed by two horns; Keor or Ghern, meaning horn. The settlement was subsequently increased by the son of the founder, who erected the longer portion of the present walls; which however, have since been again extended along the shore line, as the increase of population, from time to time, demanded. 129. Perhaps no conjuncture of circumstances could have seemed less favor able to the creation of a thriving commercial settlement, than the arrival of a band of Arab Pirates on a barren shore, with brackish water, and back grounded by a series of Bedouins. Yet what is the fact? Here is a clean, active town, with a broad and open main bazaar, and numerous solid stone dwelling houses, stretch ing along this strand, and containing some 20,000 inhabitants; attracting Arab and Persian merchants from all quarters by the equity of its rule, and by the freedom of its trade. It imports from Malabar and Bombay, some two lacs of rupees value, principally in longcloths, rice, coffee, planks and spices. It exports some 800 horses at an average value of 300 rupees each. 40,000 rupees worth in wool; 60,000 rupees of dates, and perhaps, 40,000 rupees worth in miscellanies, or say approximately nearly four lacs of rupees worth of exports against two and a half lacs. Imports. Of the horses some 600 are shipped direct from Koweit; the remaining 200 from Busreh. The horsedealers of Koweit have their agents among the Shemma Anizee and other ISTejd and miscellaneous tribes; collecting accurate detailed information as to all the pedigrees of horses, and as to all the foals coming These Agents, towards the commencement of the Bombay season, in July on. and August, bring down their purchased horses, overland to Koweit; preferring this tedious route, with its cost of protection by the way, to running the gauntlet of the Kiver Custom Houses, bad climate of Busreh, and other inconveniences. 130. The sailors of Koweit are highly reputed, and there may be some 4,000 of them afloat; but Koweit sends to Muskat for boat-builders, as they are esteemed superior workmen. Among a long row of native craft of all sizes, I observed two small boats made at Cochin. 131. Koweit* sends about 30 boats annually to Bombay, each boat on an aver age of 100 tons, containing 2,000 baskets of dates; worth, say, 1,000 French rials. Hence the date export of 30,000 rials or 60,000 rupees. The dates are received or shipped from the Shat-ul-Arab. Horse forage comes in part down the Boobian creek, from Bunder Zobeir. Mutton, which is good, and milk, butter &amp;c., they receive from the Bedouins, who flock to the town and are pitched in tents or huts all along the outside of its walls. These Bedouins are not allowed to enter the town armed; but they sell at the gate, where the Chief daily sits, and looks on. Koweit may boast of some 6,000 fighting men within its walls; but the policy has been to keep the peace internally, and with all its neighbours. It pays no tribute to the Ameer Fysul; but maintains friendly relations with him. It receives no tribute, customs or revenue from any valuable, and de mand rapidly in creased. The same re mark applies to Sessamum seed, at Lamoo. I found English saddles much esteemed among the Arabs at Koweit, and it occurred to me that if among the presents made by Government in this part of the world to the Native Chiefs, useful articles like a saddle were included, not only would the receivers benefit by them, but some want might be created, whose supply would involve subsequent trade.one; save small offerings at the gate, or from merchants, amounting perhaps to 20,000 Rials per annum, and a complimentary present of dates from Busreh, in token of Suzerainty; and for the supposed protection of the mouths of the Lusrch river. The Government is patriarchal; the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee the judicial Departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the Cazee s decision. Punishment is rarely inflicted. Indeed there seems little government interfeience anywhere; and little need for any. \\ 1 icii my father was nearly 120 years old, remarked the Sheikh to me, he called me and said 'I shall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money; but I have inade many and true friends; grapple them. While other States round the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or ill-government, mine has gone on increasing. Hold to my policy, and though you are surrounded by a desert, and pressed on by a once hostile and still wandering set of tribes you will flourish.' It is thus un der the fostering care of a succession of common sense Rulers, and by means of a policy wisely originated, and systematically pursued, that an Arab band of pirates appear as the masters of a thriving Port, the refuge of the oppressed, and the peaceful free home of all. I confess that I looked round with something like amazement at finding such a political and commercial structure, in such a region, and the work of such hands. 132. If Arahs can do all this in the remotest corner of the Persian Gulf, what might not we do if we held its key gained the confidence of our neighbours by justice, and forwarded their material interests by the exercise of those moral quali ties and that intellectual superiority, which the civilization of our country bestows on every English gentleman of common capacity, over an Asiatic? 133. No doubt, much of the prosperity of Koweit may be due to position, and to a comparatively healthy climate. It was in ancient days the point where the sea trade took to caravans, or river carriage. It still maintains its natural advantages; and, although I would not recommend the artificial forcing of trade from its present course, I would still keep an eye on Koweit, for future purposes. It is, in my opinion, by no means impossible that Koweit, under an effective de velopment of the Gulf trade, would become the terminus for our sea-going steam ers ; a coal station, and a telegraph station. The more you analyze the ques tion, the more you will probably be struck by the fact that the trade of the East and West has a marked tendency to resume its old lines under improved means of transit. Koweit appears to me a preferable Port to Busreh for the same reasons that Kurrachee is preferable to Tatta. The climate of Busreh is fatal; that of Koweit, comparatively good. The water of Koweit, it is true, is brackish; yet fever is unknown. Dysentery and ophthalmia are rare, and when men commence begetting new families at 80, and die at 120, the climate cannot be considered as prematurely exhausting. 134. The only remedies in use are firing, accompanied by doses of senna. If a man suffer from indigestion, he is fired in spots round the navel. If he have chest complaint, he is fired on the back, near the shoulder blade. The sores are kept open for months, as issues. And the efficacy of the treatment is much ap plauded. Their constitutions are strong, however. 135. The prevalent North-wester is tempered from the desert by blowing over ten miles of Bay; yet it does not, in that space, gain that muggy, relaxing character, with which it arrives on the opposite coast at Bushire. ^ Koweit is always approachable by ships; and affords good and ample harbourage. Busreh is 70 miles up a river. Koweit has a fine broad channel of creek water running from its Bay up to within 12 miles of the Busreh point of the river. I landed close alongside the Zobeir Bunder, in 4 fathoms; and this was the least water I found in a mid-channel of an average width of one mile, from the Koweit end of the creek up to its head, within sight of the date-trees on the Shat-ul-Arab, near Busreh. The cutting of a canal across these twelve miles of flat soil, would be a work of little cost and labor. 136. On the whole, and without endeavouring to change trade from any £2G present channel, I would bear Koweit in mind, as a convenient point for a telegraph station, for a coal depots for the meeting of sea-coins' and river ste^i in rrs and other craft; and as a possible future Port of importance. 137. I was a little surprised to find the Sheikhs at Koweit well informed as to distant politics. They took in an Oriental Paris Gazette. They admired the generosity of our policy towards Turkey, hut wondered we did not do as much for Christian Greece. They thought 90 millions sterling a heavy fee for the temporary restoration of an invalid friend. One white-heard said that with States as with individuals, when their hour strikes, it is of no use for man to alter the Clock. To hind a crumbling government, was like darning a Bedouin's coat. Too worn out to be mended, too rotten to be even washed, it would fall to pieces in spite of you. They considered our efforts against the slave trade more humane than successful; and they thought we might spend the money to better purpose on our own poor, with whose condition they were unfavorably impressed, as summarized in the ' Paris Gazette.'* 138. The chief Sheikh was a remarkable man in all respects, as he sat in the gate, his eyes undimmed by 80 years, and his patriarchal hands grasping a plated watch of the description, commonly known as warmino- pan, (I am now sending him a gold watch and chain). He never wears shoes; and Ins feet seem to have been the original of the Hercules at Florence. He has a voice like a trumpet; stopping every now and again, with a loud Hah, something between that of the Patriarch of the Flock, and the sudden b ast and pause in a favorite polka. His speech recalls the larffe utterance of the early gods. ^ He told me that among the heirlooms of his family was an injunction, still daily religiously observed, to relieve the stranger: a large dinner, in an allotted hall, is prepared every evening for all wanderers and stran gers who may wish to share it. The sole restriction is that arras must be left at the gate. Practices like this may perhaps account for much of the peace, good will and neighbourhood, and mercantile prosperity of this Town. Charity; attraction of sorrow; relief of actual want; these are sentiments little thouo-ht of Yet they are, perhaps, beyond all else, unless justice, the keys of personal power throughout the East. 1 r Sheikh said that his family had always been tributary to Turkey. But 1 learned from another source, that during some years, they had hoisted their T&gt; Wn , found, however, that the Customs levied on their exports to Ijom bay, were more inconvenient when levied against an unrecognized fla^, than when levied against a Turkish craft. Koweit, shrinking from this foreign pressure turned to her Sultan, and suddenly changed color. Truly, trade is sensitive as woman s modesty. . 140. Be the Suzerainty of the Sublime Porte, however, of old or recent date it is merely nominal; the Arabs acknowledge the Turks, as we do the 39 Articles' which all accept, and none remember. 141. The territory directly under Turkey is that of Busreh.

Yet the little creek that leads from the town steps to the main river, il unwholesome, was still very welcome. The apricot and almond, in full blossom, hanging bonnily over the hedges, called back the apple and the cherry- tree gladdening the orchard and greeting the road side, in a country where these objects were something more to us, than to the passing foreign employe. 144. I may perhaps be expected to offer a remark or two upon the prospects that any extension of the present steam communication through the Griilf would have. I infer that the present line pays well; and that the steamers runninw; from Busreh to Baghdad also pay. Having had occasion to visit Busreh with part of my establishment by the mail steamer, I found her first class accommoda tion all occupied, and was glad to be permitted sitting and dining room in the orlop deck forward, I calculated that the receipts for that upward trip of twelve days steaming from Bombay to Busreh, must have been 45,000 rupees; and from what J subsequently learned, that her return trip must have brought in 30,000 rupees. 145. I think that some descriptions of goods would readily avail themselves of steam communication along this line; such for instance, as bales of shawls and other costly packages; also copper and stores. I further presume that a consider able passenger traffic is waiting; and might be indefinitely increased by the sup ply of means. Merchants would gladly pay a higher passage-money to save their time, and be in advance of their coming goods. A wealthy and numerous class of Mahomedans seek Baghdad, Kurbella, and Xejd. for purposes of religion and pleasant residence. The numbers of this class would doubtless augment were the ease and rapidity of the journey to become known and appreciated. 146. But my suggestion to any merchants embarking in this enterprise would be to render their arrangements from the first public and definite, and as convenient as may be to all parties concerned. 147. Let them publish as early as practicable their probable dates of arrivals and departures; and then adhere to these. If it once becomes the general notion that the steamer will wait, Oriental traders will certainly dally; and then either the company must lose their cargo, or lose their time. 148. Be careful in the selection of agents, and see that they fulfil their duty. 149 If it be found that the cargo-boats from the shore cannot be depended on for punctuality or in a breeze, establish independent cargo-boats, and include this charge in the Bill of Lading. 150. Let the cargo brought, be delivered in good condition.* 151. If a promise be made to drop even the lowest class of passenger at a certain point, let the promise be fulfilled. It is better to lose a little time in anchoring, and to expend a few extra pounds of coal, rather than to allow a whisper of breach of contract to find its way into the interior. * Since writing this I have received an official complaint from the Governor of Bushire of the non delivery of goods, and of the departure of the steamer for Busreh carrying the Bushire goods on with it. A second complaint of the injury sustained by goods, while on board. A third complaint that the steamer gives no notice of departure, and last time left a passenger who had paid his passage-money. In my opinion there are faults on both sides.28 162. If a bertli be once regularly secured, never infringe its tenant's rights in favor of a more advantageous offer: stick to contract. 153. Adapt the accommodation of the vessels to the description of passengers frequenting the route. An upstart native will push anywhere; but there are many Mahomedan gentlemen whose families were old before England was born, and who yet, partly from modesty, partly from religious prejudice, and partly from a pardonable reserve, cannot bring themselves to intrude into the European Saloon. Let the best arrangement practicable be made to accommodate Orientals according to their class in some other part of the ship. 154. I would suggest to the Government to require from steamers carrying their mails, that punctuality and those rates of speed which are usually now required from similar steamers on other lines. At present the dates are named only for Kurrachee and Bombay. And the result is that if a mail steamer finds herself late at Busreh, she gives up all thought of reaching Kurrachee in time, loiters for cargo, thus detaining the Gulf, Baghdad and Teheran letters, and trusts to some other steamer taking her place at Kurrachee on the specified day. 155. It is not my duty to speculate on the general opening up of this route as a main artery of communication between England and India; but analyzing the map one spontaneously recalls the first lesson of Geometry that the shortest road between two points is a straight line. A line drawn from London to a point on the western coast of the Peninsula of India, traverses the Persian Gulf. Kur rachee seems to be pointed out by nature as the place where our English Tele graphic cable, should enter our Indian Empire. It would of course be an advan tage to have our Telegraph line identical with our line of trade, and post, and passengers. 156. In conclusion. His Excellency having directed me to report on the trade of the Persian Gulf, I have now woven a thread through these sheets; but I confess at the same time that I write on trade with much diffidence and some reluctance. The remarks of a non-trader must be superficial and theoretic. In trade as in other professions there can be no real school but experience, acting on original capacity. And all that an outsider can do of useful, is to bring a little grist to that mill. The principles of Political Economy mathematically true in the abstract, may be rendered by circumstances ruinous in detailed practice. The merchant knows there is no workable law of commerce but to watch the market, and mistrust general maxims. To costly experience he must add continued care and forethought. His combinations are not less comprehensive and complex than those of a General. Like him, too, he must first fight the campaign in his head; and when the time comes to leave strategy for tactics, fight it over again on the decisive field of competition. Ruin or Fortune hangs on a day. And when all is done that can be done, that day may still be adverse. A touch at the other side of the Globe may vibrate through the whole mass he is dealing with, and discon cert his combinations at the last hour; and this, I presume, is the reason why, the bast laid plans of merchants, as of mice, do still go oft awry.
