Arrangements are being made t.ith Messrs# Gray Mackenzie and Yusuf Kanoo f the only Shipping Agents in Bahraln 9 to take out Mr# Jelaluddin to such ships immediately cn arrival# (b) For tankers other than Banish and Norwegian I am arranging with the Bahrain Petroleum Company to deliver the order aboard and to obtain the receipt# (c) I understand from N.0#I.C# that efforts will be made at Jufeir to detect any infringement of this order f which would be followed by an armed guard being out aboard with instructions to be offensive# 'I2. For control of Danish and Norwegian ships the following arrangements are being made s- (i) The Agency launch is being sent to Jufair at once and one of the crew will be permanently aboard. It will have its own moorings. (ii) Whenever the launch is required a telephone call to the A.P.A. or, if he cannot be found, to myself will result in the crew being sent by taxi to Jufair ready for duty. I hope it will be possible to ensure that calls for the crew should generally be made before dark. (iii) It is understood that N.O.I.C. will visit all Danish and Norwegian ships immediately on arrival and will invite the Captains to confer with you ashore; that you will then decide whether or not an armed guard should be out aboard; and if required a requisition for a guard will be telephoned direct to the Fort. I propose to use armed guards of 1 N.C.O. and 10 men in each case, and sufficient police can be made available to provide guards for 10 ships at any one time. If these arrangements remain in force for a considerable period and we require more men we shall have to discuss the question of obtaining reinforcements. That however sterna highly improbable• (iv) Two armed policemen will be ready for duty at the Fort at all times to accompany N.O.I.C. on his visits to Danish and Norwegian ships. It is being arranged that he will telephone the Fort when he wants them and will then pick them up. (v) The Adviser to the Bahrain Government is supplying N.O.I.C. with a Verey pistol and I have given him 20 red cartridges. (vi) It is understood that if any Captain refuses to accompany him ashore a signal will be made by Verey light and Jufair will then requisition a guard from the Fort. The guard will then go out in the dhow Belle, the Agency launch having already been used by N.O.I.C. himself.ts - 3 - (!)

Since there are no qualifying words such as 'for information*, pr£suma;5.y they intended that we should act on it. Does this indicate that they have some lingering belief that Bahrain and Kuwait are Persian ports and that tae German negation can place embargoes on Norwegian or Danish ships in Bahrain ? And are they unaware that it has been held in hohdon that Bah rain (and I believe Kuwait) is legally at war with any country with which Great Britain is at war ? It might of course have been a warning to us to expect Norwegian ships here from Persian ports, but I think that if this is so would have the telegf&amp;m xxat been worded differently, 5# It may be very stupid on my part, but I cannot imagine what the purpose of asking you to pass the tele gram to Bahrain and Kuwait was and I should be immensely grateful for an elucidation.

( 2) e appreciate patriotic objections of Danes to transfer of ships to allied flag. Nevertheless it is essential for them to realise their position. (3) No vessel can trade independently under Danish flag for duration of tle war since only Danish Government is puppea of German Government. In view of German invasion Danish ships have legally become enemy tonnage and liable t° seizure and condemnation. German Government are issuing instructions to Danish ships and if latter remain under Danish flag German Government will either direct their subsequent employment or secure their immobilisation in neutral ports. It is therefore essential for allies to exercise legal rights of formal seizure in order to prevent ships from serving German interests. (4/ Choice there;.ore before Danish ships is (a) to remain in neutral ports and earn nothing with the risk of being embargoed by Dahish interests under pressure from Germany. Even if neutral Government does not i ecognise German controlled Danish Government Danish owners mignt enforce their title to control ships in local court. (b) to attempt trade under Danish flag in which case they will at once have to be seized by allies at sea and will oe entitled to no compensation.can only be done by submitting to formal seizure and transfer ? to allied flag. All Danish vessels which being on April 8th ax. sea on in neutral ports have come or come until further notice voluntarily to allied ports, will receive treatment not worse than British vessels subject to safeguards to prevent financial benefit to Germany and will be retransferred at the end of the war. (5) In no circumstances can we recognise transfer of any flag but British and French. As regards cargoes however arrangements will be made either to secure delivery or give other form of compensation subject .to usual contraband con siderations. Time charters must be broken but we realise in exceptional cases interests of charterers may merit special consideration. r&lt;uD ^ y. /V .o . P- &amp;7- hi. 0' (. C- .CONFIDENTIAL.
