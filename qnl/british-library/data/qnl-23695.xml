Traffic in opium from Persia to the Arabian Coast, Sir, With reference to your letter of 28th liay last No. P.125-N/29, I am directed by the Secretary of State for India to forward copy of correspondence with the Foreign Office and Home Office. The Secretary of State will be glad if the Grovernment of India will cause a draft regulation to be prepared and forv/arded to him so that he may obtain the concurrence of the Foreign Office and Home Office in its terms. This correspondence has hitherto related to opium; but the Home Office in their letter of nth August refer to drugs other than opium. There may be some evidence of a traffic in manufactured drugs in the Persian Gulf, e.g. at Debai; but until the facts are more fully established it will probably not be thought desirable to suggest to the Sheikhs that the scope of their proclamation should be extended.

I thank you for your D.O., No.ll^, of this date; and in reply would state that I concur with your opinion that such slight traffic as appears to exist in dangerous drugs smuggled into Bahrain is mainly in opium, which ie brought here in native sailing craft iron Persia. iiuch quantities as get ashore are believed to be smuggled in at night by rowing-boats into the neighbourhood of Nairn, or perhaps Hedd. There ie no Preventive Force operating in this State, I have never traced any attempt to smuggle cocaine* but I have heard unofficially that on a few occasions small quantities of hashish have been brought here frca India. e0/%yS- Captain C.S.Prior, I.A., H.B.M's Political Agent, BAHRAIN.C's.

So far no si^i of this traffic has come to my notice and the only drugs whose import has 'been traced has been Opium in small quantities and an instance two years ago of the import of a small quantity of Hashish. The Opium is invariably imported from the Persian Coast or Qatar and is usually smuggled ashore at night in rowing boats in small quantities. 3. Whenever cases are detected they are prosecuted and the possession of ^pium being an offence any person found possessing it is likewise prosecuted. 4. Since a large proportion of the Persian inhabitants of Bahrein are Opium addicts it would be very difficult,if not impossible to stamp out the trade entirely and small quantities will always continue to filter in.

You state ' there is a probability that the increasing pre-occupations of the post now caused by the « operations of oil drilling will render it impossible for him to take a particular case or cases.^ The putting into effect of the Bahrain Order in Council is one of the most important duties of the Political Agent, Bahrain, and whatever may be his other pre-occupations he must find time for this duty. 3. .Vith regard to the possibility - to which you allude - of the Political Agent being personally involved in a case. This would seem so unlikely that special legislation to cover it would hardly 'seem to be necessary. If such a case did occur the Political Resident himself,as the High Court, could deal with it. 4. The practical difficulties of the Secretary acting at all regularly as Additional District Magistrate and Additional ... ;/-N -2- Additional Sessiais Judge at Bahrain are formidable, r-e has ample work here and a tour to Bahrain and back by the slow mail - the only means of communication - together with the time taken up by a trial, would render his absence from Bushire a prolonged one» As therefore :iis services i O j . Bahrain could not be called for regularly, and as the exceptional case is provided for in paragraph 2 above, Llaj or TTowle personally is doubtful as to wiie tiier there is strong enough ground for him to approach the Government of India with your proposal.

Jj. Personally I am all against multiplying rules and regulations if this can be avoided. I have taken a cursory glance at the Act of 1925 v/hich, I suppose, is the one you mean. It looks a formidable and complicated document and if I were P.A.Bahrain, I should certainly prefer to do without it if I possibly could. $ The A.P.O.C. at Abadan employ a large number of British protected subjects, and in years gone., Ca^t. C. G.

Each British subject who took service with the Company, however, had - I under stand - a clause that any matter in dispute should be referred to the arbitration of the British Consul. .Then the latter had given his arbitral award, if the Company, say, did not act on it, the workman could apply for a decree to the Consul in his judicial capacity under the Capitulations, The Capitulations in Persia have disappeared^ but of course they still remain in force in Bahrain. ;7ould it not serve your purpose for a similar clause to be put into the agreement between the workman and the B.P.C.? In fact, the Protector of Emigrants in India will, I imagine, insist on tnis clause being put in before he allows Indians to • •.-3- to leave for Bahrain to take up employment with, the Company. In virtue of this clause you would arbitrate, and if the Company did not ooey your award, the workman could then apply to you in your judicial capacity, as defined under tne Ordei in Council, and you would issue a decree. This, it seems to me, would he a speedier arrangei'ie^t, and one involving less work on you, than what you proposed nrv-c.v&gt;. v ■ 5 DtCUNo: ^ 3 I J olilicai s BaJirain ,the 12th July 1931. 3 Dear Major, ^ Please refer to your D .O .letter lIo:1375 dated the 2nd July 1931# - 1 I quite agree that the extension of complicated acts to Balirain is to 'be avoided but the situation is more complicated than it appears, 2p If an employee has a proper agreement executed before the Protector of Emigrants he is sufficiently corered^but, uiiiorticiauely the Company have engaged many Indians,both locally and from ? iraq^wi tbout the execution of any agreemvjnt at all. These nen are in no way protected and I have no means of eiuorciiig claihis against them. Further certain Indians have already maxja^ed Lo secure visas for Bahrain with the intention of looking for work in the Bahrain Gil Compaaiy,aiid since the irotector of .'.migrants only functions when Indians proceed on engagement with firms and not when they travel on their own account, the number of unprotected employees v /ill increase.

I enclose for your information and return a copy of letter No:ir /l32 -N /31 dated the 30th September 1931 from the GoTernment of India to the India Office,wMch was enclosed with your abore -mentioned letter. You will notice that the middle portion of the second paragraph has no meaning and it appears that instead of 'purpose of registration of', 'purpose of registration dn' is meant. 3» The question of .British protected persons is not^howerer, so simple as it would appear. Who are meant by Hadhranautis A^c. ,whom it is considered unnecessary to register? A' reference to Chapter XX of the Consular Instructions and its Aunix as amended in June 1930 defines British protected status and has apparently not only includesfnadhrftmaut but also Bahrain.Kuwait, us cat and Oman and the Trucial ahaiididome. If those mentioned in o,4,5 and 6 of section (d) were to be registered the utmost confusion would ensue and,in the case of Bahrain subjects, ofcourse,it would be reductio ad absurdum. 4. j^ren if British Protectorates, as mentioned in Section ( a) are to be included great confusion would be caused as the limits of the Aden and Somaliland Protectorates are unknown here an,-* it would be quite impossible to check the statements of the hordes of Somalis who arrive in Bahrain without any papersc. • papers thair airing books, when they &amp;ay they are from Aden or Somali land.

Subject therefore tc any further chservaticns which the Secretary cf State fcr Foreign Affairs itay have tc offer, he proposes to authorise the issue cf instructions cn the lines which the G-cvernrient of India suggest, vi^: to register British Protected Perscas proper, such as subjects of Indian subjects, who reside, or make a prcicrimed otay in Bahrain. There would appear tc be little utility in registering at Bahrain the floating population, which apparently increases largely during tne pearling season, and is not regularly resident in Bahrain and it will oe observed that it is stated that the extra work involved would involve the entertainnent cf an additional clerk, which it is presumed, might for financial reasens oe cut cf the questicn at the present tiue.
